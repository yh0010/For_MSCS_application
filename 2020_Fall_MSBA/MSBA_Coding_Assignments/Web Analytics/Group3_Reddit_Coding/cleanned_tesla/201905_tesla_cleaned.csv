"
"""Over The Air updates are a revolution in the car industry, no matter how simple they are.
"
"
"
"Every other car I have ever bought, with super rare exceptions, didn't change after it rolled off the lot.  Even simple things like mirror angling....if it didn't have it when you paid for it, you weren't going to get it.
"
"
"
"But Tesla, for all their faults, is responsive enough to these small requests that people even post """"Suggestions"""" to them regularly - which really says something about their ability to keep changing.
"
"
"
"I'm floored that my 4 year old Model S gets some of the same updates that the brand new ones do.  It's simple, but very powerful.""
"
"""People are really missing the point of this request. Tesla‚Äôs already point the mirrors down in reverse. This is asking for a new feature for when the car is in Drive. I don‚Äôt know of any car that does this. 
"
"
"
"So if they added it, that would be impressive and demonstrate the power of over the air software update features. And, in the case of the 3, the dramatic reductions in physical buttons to rely on the center touch display. More features can be added for very zero marginal cost to each car over time. 
"
"
"
"So if BMW launches a great new feature, Tesla could (in theory) copy it in short order and deploy it to all existing cars over night. This eliminating the feature advantage from any competitors.""
"
"I know that the side mirror pointing down while backing up is standard feature on alot of BMW's. Isn't Tesla playing catchup here? Unless you're talking more about having a CEO that is more accessible and listens to his customers requests.
"
"It's actually the best thing about Tesla. Other manufacturers still rely on 3rd party for certain systems so they can't change or add features via software updates to pretty much anything in the car like Tesla can.
"
"""This is like saying Donald Trump is outpacing every president....

"Other manufacturers have been doing this for decades...
"
"Is there a way to make the mirror not tilt down as much? I tried to save the angle up higher but it never saves.
"
"""I thought this already existed, at least on the Model S.  Not to mention, sure, it would be great that it automatically does this on reverse, but...you could also just...well point your mirrors down to see the curb.""

"I find that Teslas have plenty of known UI limitations that are well known to the engineering team.  E.g. I find the inability to only apply child proof locks to only one rear door (not both) absurd. (Which makes my model 3 worse than my 20 year old Camry in this regard!)""

"This goes through concept feasibility stage and prioritised so that they have an idea what's coming in the next few phases.
"

"Justification is given for these features, some of which will be that X % of tweets reference this as well as feedback from various other sources.

"Once a decision has been made to move forward you wait for the next tweet about it, vet the person who made the tweet to make sure they are not a crazy and then the social media manager posts something like this.

"
"
"
"The biggest problems with self-driving are:
"
"
"
"* Cars drive within inches of each other on the highway.
"
"* Most cars are manually driven, poorly.
"
"* Roads are fairly non-standard in construction.
"
"* Cars are close to roads and vegetation which makes detection harder.
"
"* A pedestrian can pop out from behind an obstruction with almost no warning.
"
"
"
"Aircraft are a very different beast:
"
"
"
"* You can't legally fly without a ton of training.
"
"* Procedures of operation are fairly formal for the most part.  Even small planes are flown with far more regard to procedure than the typical car.
"
"* Planes generally stay FAR away from each other normally.
"
"* Planes stay far away from other objects including the ground, so radar can trivially detect them at great range.  
"
"* There are no kids playing around at 1000 feet altitude who might dart into your path.
"
"
"
"If flying cars ever became economical chances are the ONLY ones allowed in the air would be self-flying, and thus capable of coordination with other self-flying cars.

"
"As a result, I suspect that it would take less computational complexity to operate a self-flying plane, than a self-flying car.

"Those AMD Threadrippers are nice, but the fastest ones have only 32 cores, and I believe they can basically do about 16 multiplies per clock per core, or about 512 per clock total.  The AP3 hardware can do 10,000 multiplications per clock.

"Now, the threadrippers can do a ton of other things that the AP3 hardware can't do anywhere near as fast, as they're basically just built to multiply a LOT of numbers really fast.  Also, those figures for Ryzen are for floating point when AP3 is only doing 8-bit integer math, but that is all Tesla needs, apparently.

"- Infrastructure need to improve - I'm in Toronto, Ontario and I read a lot of minor fender benders are waiting between weeks to months before they get replacement parts. Sometimes accidents are out of your control and if its your only car, this can be a painful experience.
"
"
"
"- Infrastructure on Superchargers - more and more are being built and you can see which chargers are full, but what will happen when one day it is 80% EV and 20% ICE on the road, and everyone wants to do a road trip on the first summer day? (Maybe a needless worry right now)
"
"
"
"- Fires during idle - this is my paranoia here, I live in a townhouse and my garage is part of the house. I fear waking up in the middle of the night and my house is on fire because of the battery. I actually don't want to even write this point as I have almost no knowledge in this area but is a fear of mine.
"
"
"
"- Cost of ownership - from my calculations I will save $120/month vs gas by switching to EV, but my insurance will go up $40/month. And the gap will continue to close as insurance goes up as well as electricity rates. Yes, we can argue my ICE insurance and the gas rate will go up as well. Trying to justify to myself a Tesla will save money on ownership is out the window (new car vs paid off car)

"
"

"
"I have 3 year old twins in the back and never a problem space wise. Coming from an Audi Q5. Yes we don't have as much vertical storage in the trunk but capacity wise I'm not concerned at all. Stroller etc it's all easy to fit.

"
"
"
"2.) I've never really noticed it. Just did an 1700 mile road trip a few days ago and cruised at 80mph both ways and never once though wind noise was too loud. To be honest, I never thought about wind noise once during the whole drive.
"
"
"
"3.) It'll be fine charging at those temps, but range will certainly be heavily reduced. Like the other guy said, expect at least a 45% reduction in super cold, especially if you're taking frequent short stops (since the cabin gets warmed up, then cools, and then gets warmed up again over and over again) since heat is what uses the most energy. 
"
"
"
"What I do to mitigate this is I set the car to keep the climate control on after I leave the car. It wastes a little energy maintaining the temp, but far less than if it was constantly having to heat back up from 0 degrees. On longer trips the cold isn't that big of a deal, but you'll still see about a 25-30% reduction in range. So in my case I would be able to go about ~220 miles on a charge in winter. Still plenty far between stops when road tripping, but definitely noticeably less than what I can get in summer. 
"
"
"
"Note: I have the 19"""" wheels, so they're significantly less efficient the faster I go. For example, if I had the aero wheels I could do my entire commute on one charge in the winter. With 19"""" wheels I can't. But they look so much better that I can deal with it.""

Part of the delivery cost is fixed so you pay that regardless of the amount of electricity you  use.  Even if you used zero kWhs you will still get a fill for that fixed portion   Then part of the delivery is calculated per kWh you use.

"Good call.  Maybe a Tesla pickup will get you interested one day.
"
"The battery is covered by a 8 year warranty.  After the warranty period a battery replacement will be priced around $7k.  The maintenance schedule has been abandoned and it is now provided based on vehicle diagnostics and reported wear.  Many systems can receive a checkup remotely and a service technician can come out to fix the majority of issues at your home or work.  Certain components will require their technicians to diagnose and repair but their shop rate is pretty standard (at least in my area).

"

I actually think Tesla's have too much range since very few people travel 300 miles in a day, and those who do usually travel much further and would need to stop for hour long recharges. A 150 mile range seems much more appropriate for where electric cars are currently at as far as using them for daily commute and recharging overnight. I feel like hybrids are still better for long distance because they have many advantages electric cars have and also can refill in 5 minutes for another 400 miles. Hopefully Tesla puts out a super affordable, short range car at some point soon.""

"And I'd wager you'd still come out ahead even at your rates because not only is it just really cheap to drive (for you it's ~$13/full charge even accounting for charging losses), but you'd also have significantly reduced maintenance costs. I've put on 20k miles in 6 months and just did my first (very overdue) tire rotation last week. In oil changes alone I estimate I've saved $120-150 which isn't insignificant considering that amount of money is equivalent to how much it would cost to drive my car for 2.5 months.

"Keep in mind, though, that your question """"how far can you go on a full charge?"""" could be stuck in gas-powered thinking. With a gas car you really should fill up to full all the time but you don't have to do that with a Tesla. At first people think an EV is less convenient simply because it requires different thinking and habits than what you're used to. But depending on your situation (like mine) it may be totally the opposite. I drive about 140+ in a day when I commute to work including a quick drive at noon for lunch. I start the day at 90% and in the summer come home with about 30% remaining and mine's the mid-range battery rated at 264 miles if you go 100%-0%. So, if it's a bit colder or I've got a headwind I won't get quite that much but if it's warmer and no wind I can get more than that.

"But the future of the charging infrastructure doesn't look like that. It'll be a lot of L2 charging similar to what I have at home with my NEMA 14-50. Those are cheap to install and I think every business that currently provides parking will eventually see they need to provide L2 charging. That means your office parking lot as well as any parking garage, shopping center, grocery store, movie theater ...

If they were, why not accelerate into that free space and avoid being rear-ended altogether? It's not like getting pushed into the car in front would be worse than potentially putting the vehicle into more danger.
"
"
"
"After you've already been hit, it's quite dangerous for the system to take over autonomously. We would have seen other evasive steering moves well before this one. For example, how does the system know the cameras and sensors are still reliable and calibrated? Adding to that, if you skid from the rear impact, the wheel sensors wouldn't accurately know your position (and GPS is definitely not accurate enough). What if the rear tires were damaged?

"When I come up on stopped/slow traffic, I always check what is on my left, my right and behind. This way you have a way out and don't waste time, if a split-second reaction is needed. As far as following distance, to a degree, you can manage the following distance behind you, by increasing the following distance in front of you. In this situation, I would have kept larger following distance in front, since there were no vehicles immediately behind me, at the moment when I started slowing down. I would also turn on 4-way flashers, to increase my visibility behind. Will keep watching what is happening behind me (since speed differential would be largest from that direction) and if I see a vehicle not slowing down, I would speed up (get into the emergency lane, if necessary, to get out of the path of the vehicle behind). To exemplify - you can tell that the Ford, in front of the Tesla, was watching his/her rear view mirrors - it swerved to the emergency lane (right) when the Tesla got close (after the hit), then swerved back into the travel lane (left), when the Jeep appeared in the emergency lane behind it.

They had recently repaved the road, and they were doing the lines for that exit.  However, the painting stopped about halfway, so I *think* what happened is that about four cars ahead of me, someone slowed down heavily in the lane of traffic so they could move over.  (People around here have a really bad habit of slowing down in the lane of traffic and *then* moving over... even if there's plenty of room in the exit lane to slow down.)  All the cars back to and including me slowed down properly, but as I looked up in my rear-view mirror, I saw a car coming up on me far too fast.  WHAM!

There's no reason for this except to inflate the body repair cost. The purpose of crumple zones is to elongate the g-force spike.

"""I don‚Äôt have math for you but here are some of the ways you can save. Some may seem out there but they are more real than you may admit.
"
"
"
"1. Savings on basic maintenance... no oil changes, radiator, engine air filter, spark plugs, carburetor, etc.
"
"
"
"2. Savings on repairs... no gas-related engine components and other components to go bad like alternator, starter motor, timing belt, head gasket, etc.
"
"
"
"3. Tax savings (varies depending on region)
"
"
"
"4. Power company rebates (again, varies)
"
"
"
"5. Less likely to get in expensive auto accidents. Big one here is rear-end collisions in stop and go traffic... Teslas have a huge edge in being less likely to be at fault in a rear-end collision since auto pilot will virtually eliminate this.
"
"
"
"6. Less likely to get injured, crippled, or killed during any accidents that might occur for any reason.
"
"
"
"7. Less stress while driving. Spouse is relaxed and happy as auto pilot moderates follow distance. Improved relationships. Less likelihood of expensive divorce.
"
"
"
"8. Easier access to a larger variety of jobs due to easier less stressful commute, creating more career flexibility so you can change to a better job that earns more money, with less stress even if the commute is slightly longer.
"
"
"

And that was a 2008 Scion xD so it benefited from Toyota reliability but not a comfortable car for the long commute, either. Buying a new ICE and continuing to do that commute still made me nervous because over time that's a lot of wear on a gas engine.

"""There are so many Tesla owners you wouldn't be able to use a supercharger anyway if it were free. You'd be on a road trip and every 300 miles you'd have to get in an hour long line just because 20 people are trying to save $5 on their electric bill. Then everybody will be whining when they hit the limit and their charge rates are capped to protect their batteries, because it degrades your battery a tiny bit every time you plug into one.
"

"What perk are you concerned they might take away before you buy? Superchargers are physical infrastructure. They take up space and probably need occasional maintenance. They're always going to be scarce. They are always building more, but I'd rather see them along new routes so that I can get to more places, instead of spending that money building huge stations so that every Tesla owner in some city can make a detour on their way home from work...""

"""Yeah but if we factory in gas for a 12k 2016 Corolla (Yes you can find them this cheap with 25k miles) and a Model 3 (base model now for 72 month) you're stuck at 600 dollars per month for 72 months. With the 12K corolla 36 month at 300 a month you'd start saving 300 dollars a month after 3 years. If you commute is 100 miles per day the Corolla with the loan and gas equals about the same as a model 3 car payment for 72 month. I'm not for certain but I've read a while back that a EV will add about 100 dollars more to your electric bill so even now the model 3 is more expensive then the 12k Corolla. Add in the Higher insurance cost of the model 3 and the deprecation the corolla will come out ahead for a long time. Obliviously if we were to compare cost of a New gas car to a base Model 3, The Model 3 is the smarter buy. In the end though buy what make you happy.""

"""I don't think there are that many tesla owners near me. I'm not sure there are that many in general, though that information is as least potentially out there somewhere. There's a single tesla store within 2 and half hours or so of my home, so they might not be much of a commodity here.  I've literally seen a single one within an hour of my house in however long they've been out, and it was a 3. 
"
"

"I think most people realize that anything free is paid for somewhere in the line, tesla from my perspective seems to be one of the more pricier ev models a consumer could go with, and so having a nice perks built in, seems like a responsible business decision to me.

"""I doubt Tesla is all that concerned with the cost of the electricity. Their concern is with avoiding lines. Though, the electricity would add up when you get some person who has nothing better to do than get in line for two hours at the supercharger every day.

"I doubt Tesla makes much money on the chargers themselves. They help increase the value of the cars, because any EV either than a Tesla is much less practical for road trips.""

"""> That is why calling a volt a hybrid makes no sense. Hybrids are ICE cars with small electric motor assist to simply improve mpg by having a low power electric motor fill in when it can, they are slow and shitty. A prius in its fake EV mode accelerates in 0-60 in like 25s(estimated because ICE kicks on at 10mph). Slow enough to be dangerous on the road with normal traffic. Normal hybrids have normal ICE drivetrains with shitty transmissions and torque converters.

"
"
"
"There's two takes on this IMO.
"
"
"
"The first is the cynical take: the $35k 3 existed only to get reservation holders/suckers in the door, draw headlines, and juice up the preorder numbers and waitlist $$$. Under this view, Tesla delayed and obstructed deliveries of the standard range 3 to the point where essentially zero $35k vehicles were """"actually delivered"""".
"
"
"
"The second is the official party line - Tesla DID deliver the $35k 3 alongside a content-up """"standard range plus"""" model, and that the take rate for the SR+ was sufficiently high to make the de-contented """"standard range"""" model not worth producing. And while the SR was only available to order for a brief period on Tesla's site, it's still available as an """"off-menu"""" item for those that would like to place an order.
"
"
"
"The truth is probably somewhat between these extremes - we know that Tesla IS selling the 3 SR, but we also know that Tesla is singularly focused on gross margins. De-emphasizing the 3 SR and bundling a lower-feature Autopilot system into the SR+ at a $39500 price feeds into that focus.
"
"
"
"It's also worth noting that the cynical lens can also be turned on Tesla's """"entry-level premium"""" competitors - the otherwise-excellent Hyundai Kona and Kia Niro EV pair are only available in about a dozen states and Chevrolet has deep-sixed the Volt and the Bolt has become less attractive with the credit sunset. The Nissan LEAF e-Plus is a day late, has the wrong charging connector and still sits on the bones of the first generation model .. and VW will someday begin shipping EVs en masse.""

"""Yeah, a great marketing point that hobbled them as people kept holding out buying, although ironically the people who did buy complained when it finally came (however briefly/obscurely) and all the prices dropped dramatically.

"
"""The cells are not in house, which is what I specifically was referring to.  Elon Musk's comments regarding Panasonic sounded like a complaint that their extra capacity was theoretical and not sustainable, which is therefore inefficient.  If there's one thing Elon hates, it's an inefficient process.  If there's a second thing Elon hates, it's being constrained by a third party - whether that's shareholders, the SEC, seat makers, or any other part of the supply chain.  Not saying it'll happen, just that it wouldn't surprise me if he's thought about it.""
"
"The Maxwell closing time is determined by the SEC.  It's their job to approve it and they arent.  SEC can keep screwing with Tesla until someone makes them stop.
"
"""The 3 things I'm concerned about with EV trucks is regenerative braking, ability to speed, and off road capability. Without engine braking I cannot safely make my trip (I drive ~300 miles per day and use the brakes probably 10 times). If I had to use conventional brakes I would overheat them within a few seconds and possibly lose control. Regenerative braking must be strong enough to hold back all that weight at a safe speed while going down windy, steep grades. 
"
"
"
"
"
"The problem I have with faster acceleration is that itll be easier for driver to make mistakes. Just because you can be going 65mph doesn't mean you should... for instance it's easy for a driver on my route to forget about a 35mph turn coming up. Right now our best trucks can get to 45mph before this turn, so if an electric truck could hit 60mph a driver would have to decelerate much harder, which is very, very unsafe (towing multiple trailers makes the rear trailer very unstable sometimes). That being said going up hills would benefit greatly from the extra power. 
"
"
"
"My last concern is off road capability. I drive on ice, snow, and mud a lot. As I'm sure you know that requires a lot of forethought when it comes to throttle and brake control. Instant torque from electric motors scares me a lot, as right now my goal is to limit the amount of torque needed as much as possible. Sometimes, even with 4-6 sets of chains and full lockers, theres only a 60% chance that you'll not get stuck that day. Right now I rely on the sound of the motor to tell if I'm slipping or bogging down. Electric trucks would need an equivalent or better driving experience to work well in my field. 
"

"""1. Regenerative braking shouldn't be much of a concern because you are essentially running the motors in reverse giving you as much stopping power as you have acceleration before you even get to the """"real"""" brakes

"2. The traction control you get from independently controlled motors on each tire will be pretty amazing and should be much better than having to listen to the motor. You could even show something on one of the displays showing each tire and how much traction they are getting if that is necessary.
"
"3. As for speed I would imagine that being able to set corporate limits and polices for each road that a driver on will be easily achievable. Imagine having a """"governor"""" that limits you to the speed limit and maybe even forces you to slow down to a safe speed for curves eliminating that risk.""

"""I'm not a trucker or in the industry but I wanted to say those are great points I've never thought about.
"
"
"
"I would hope that Tesla is working closely with truckers/the trucking industry to ensure those concerns are met due to the differences with electric motors. Like sensors in the wheels to detect slipping etc
"
"
"
"Edit: On that note, since you clearly have your valid concerns, do you have any ideas on how Tesla could approach solving the problems you laid out?""
"
"""1: regen breaking is going to be way better for electric motors than engine breaking is. I don't want to guess, but your 600 horsepower motor probably doesn't generate half that with the breaks. Electric motors don't know which way they are spinning. A 300hp electric motor is a 300 hp electric generator.
"
"
"
"2: you are a Profesional driver on the roads with a bunch of amateurs.
"
"
"
"3: electric motors have amazing torque and the best possible traction control. They can handle mud and snow better than a diesel.""
"
"""Good eye! EXIF data says Georgetown, TX.""
"
"""Time will tell, anyways, afaik Tesla hasn't begun marketing towards oversized loads like we have. They will sell trucks to conventional, 80k lb max weight companies that will run them 1m+ miles. After a number of years I'm sure they will open up to different configuration, (3 drive axles, tag axles, etc), and the technology will be in its second or third generation. They will just need to prove that its reliable and safe. Also, our trucks run 24/7. They will need to be run 350 miles, pa.rked and charged within an hour. 
"
"
"
"I will say that on all of our trucks that I know of the electronic aids have been disabled because they either hinder our work or keep breaking. Stuff like traction control and lane departure warnings caused more problems than solved.  I don't think that had anything to do with peoples unwillingness to change, it's just it broke or didn't work right. If Tesla or any other competitor doesn't come out with a rock solid, reliable, and wholeheartedly safe truck the early adopters will probably turn off other potential buyers for years. 
"
"
"
"
"
"Cars are one thing, if you don't like it you get a new one. Semis are the lifeblood of businesses, one fault could easily kill dozens of people and destroy a small-medium sized trucking company with fines and litigations. The promise of an electric semi sounds too good to be true for us. I'm sure Tesla knows they have to get this 100% right the first time.""
"
"""I was more concerned about reliability and safety though. I know regenerative braking works great, but it takes a completely different level of engineering to stop all that weight. With a diesel engine we use a jake brake to slow thing down. That means that the engine is trying to compress 14+ liters of air pushed in at 35psi every rotation. Combine that with gears on the transmission and I can get down an 8 mile long, 6% grade without touching the brakes more than twice.  Does regenerative braking cause heat? How well would that heat hold up for that long? What would happen if something broke? 
"
"
"
"As for the off road bits, like I responded to someone else, relying on electronics is something we just don't do. They always break. There's a solid reason truckers buy glider kits, and that's because complexity creates more areas for problems. Out in the elements every day, things just break. Traction control never works, abs has problems regularly, any sort of optical device never works. I have a 2019 truck and even the lights decide not to work every 2 weeks or so. Resetting the computer fixes it. My truck is more trouble free than the next 4 newest trucks. 
"
"
"
"Like I said, Tesla or whomever else tries will have to prove their trucks work in these conditions at least equal to a diesel truck for a minimum of 5 years before a company like mine would adopt them. Even then they will need to be redesigned to be bigger than what Tesla has proposed so far. It can and will happen, but idk if anyone but walmart or other over the road companies will adopt them anytime soon.""

"Helps that I'm on my PC and not my phone :D
"
"""Yup, no electronics to be found in your rig.
"
"
"
"But for real, electronics are just basic physics like the gravity that you are competing with. A motor spinning backwards is going to create voltage. Not because it's programmed to, but because it does. Like a weight falls toward the earth.
"
"
"
"Traction control isn't amazing because the motor is smart, it's because the motor is lightweight. If you tell a diesel to move forward and they spin the tires then The tires will spin until you can calm the engine down. All 14 liters of moving parts. There is no time factor between telling the motor to spin a little, a little more, a little more. You can set the power to the wheels down to the watt.
"
"
"
"These motors aren't awesome because they are complicated. They are awesome because they are simple.

"Electric motors have siginificaly more torque than a combustion engine (that's what gives teslas their crazy acceleration). The only thing electric doesn't win on (until the roadster comes out) is top speed and high end torque starts to die out. In a tesla the top speed is only really limited because they have a single speed transmission and can't gear up for higher speeds and are therefor limited to how fast the motor can turn.
"
"""Yes and no.
"
"
"
"You get far more torque with a big battery electric car than in any gas car.  But the X is all-wheel drive, not 4 wheel drive.  It doesn't have a locking differential which is required for real off-roading.  A 3-way locking differential allows you to divert 100% of the torque that the engine can produce to a single wheel.  Locking differentials offer more than giving you the torque needed to climb rocks, it also prevents you from tire scuffing and getting stuck in mud.
"
"
"
"Assuming they didn't go all out and put a custom locking differential in it, this modded X won't be as good as a real off road car.
"
"
"
"There's also the risk that the battery isn't caged well enough to prevent punctures.  I doubt the X was designed to be able to drop on a big rock and keep the battery safe.  It was designed to protect the battery with different types of collisions.
"
"
"
"In general though, if you can protect the battery from damage and punctures and you add a locking diff, you could make an EV off roader that would perform significantly better than any gas car.
"
"
"
"An EV  designed to be an off roader would provide more torque, be less likely to roll, and even if you do, you would be less likely to damage the drivetrain.  If you puncture and expose the battery, it can catch fire something ugly and can take many hours to put out.""

"
"""Differential allows wheels to rotate at different speeds (when going round a corner the outside wheel covers a greater distance so needs to rotate faster). For off-road use, you don't want the wheels to rotate at different speeds because if one wheel significantly loses traction, all the power will go to that wheel and it'll just spin and you won't go anywhere. Locking the diff means power goes to each wheel 50/50 so if one slips you still have 50% of the power going to the wheel that has grip. Of course with a computer in the car it'll recognise that a wheel is slipping and won't send power to it anyway but still. Also this explanation is for 2 wheel drive and I'm talking about left/right wheels and not front/back but the concept is exactly the same for 4wd""

"Like all intelligent people, he must be taken to understand a reasonable proportion of what goes on in the world and how it works.
"
"
"
"If so, he will know that one of the problems of capitalist funding of commercial enterprises is that people in the inner circle can take advantage of the lack of knowledge (not intelligence, lack of knowledge) of the people in the outer circle, in order to make themselves better off.
"
"
"
"This is something that was long ago determined to be a bad thing. If your system relies on funding being provided by people buying shares in the enterprise - something which is some 500+ years old - then those share buyers must be afforded all the information that is available in order to make their decisions as to when and whether to buy and sell. 
"
"
"
"If you hide information from them in order to cash in on opportunities they don't see, or to avoid disasters they don't know about, then the entire system is undermined. It's also fundamentally unfair.
"
"
"
"It's really very difficult, if not impossible, to ensure by regulation that all shareholders have all the information they need. It is, however, possible to ensure that 'insiders' aren't allowed to take advantage of their inside information in order to tip the balance in their own favour.
"
"
"
"Therefore rules and regulations have been introduced in all developed countries which rely on such funding models making insider trading illegal. 
"
"
"
"There is ancillary regulation designed to ensure that significant figures don't act in ways which will prejudice the interests of ordinary shareholders in favour of the significant figures.

"
"We conclude that Elon Musk knows about all the foregoing. If he didn't when he sold PayPal, he does now.

"
"
"
"> I'll explain why driverless cars aren't happening anytime soon, certainly not in 2-3 years, as someone who works in the automotive field. 
"
"> 
"
"> 1. The tech isn't there yet. On a track or in specific settings, it can get pretty close, but there's one monumental hurdle. (See 2)
"
"> 
"
"> 2. Weather. There's a reason why self-driving taxis are being tested out in lowland Arizona. Reliable clear skies, very little rain, little to no fog. Cameras, lidar, whatever mix of the two you want to use are next to worthless in heavy rain and completely worthless in snow. The amount of technology needed to get around that is staggering.
"
"> 
"
"> 3. Cost. Say we reach the day when we have the all-weather tech ready to go. How much more will it cost than the current camera/lidar systems currently in cars? A fucking lot, at least at first. So once the issues with weather are solved, the cost of that tech needs to come down to where it's viable in an affordable car. That's going to take many additional years. I've seen features dumped from upcoming models because the cost for a single new part.
"
"> 
"
"> 4. Roads. Pay attention to the road markings on your commute. They're not going to be perfect, and might be completely missing in some spots. That's a problem because those are literally the most important feature that all semi-autonomous cars rely on. This is why any car offering those features only advises you to use them on highways with clear markings. No one is directing you to use these features on residential streets. What happens when there is road construction? Repavement? Lane repainting? Human intervention. Which brings me to the last point.
"
"> 
"
"> 5. New regulations. You're never going to ride in the backseat of a car driving itself because the system will never be foolproof. A driver will always be required to sit behind the wheel in case of an emergency, even if it's just a glitch of the car's system. When it comes to taxis, you're going to have to pay someone to be ready to jump in and save lives if needed. Driverless taxis are never going to happen.

Minus $100k, that's $400k. It'll take about 10 years to get that $400k out of the vehicle.

"So lets reverse this 12%. How much capital do I have to front in order to end up with a return of 12% per year and end up with 400k at the end of 10 years (this isn't compounding interest)? Turns out, it's $232,335.

"Let's pretend you buy one TSLA share today, and you value the company today based on your outlook for TSLA for the next 10 years: What has to be true for you to do so, today?
"
"
"
"For example, if you believe that TSLA can make $5,000 in profits, fully taxed, per car, in 10 years, and sell 1 million cars a year at that point, then we are talking about $5B in net income by 2029. Put a P/E multiple of 20x on that; that gets you to a $100B market cap in 10 years.  Is $5,000 reasonable? Assume a $50k ASP, and 10% net income margins. Are 10% reasonable? Well, it seems to be around 2x the margin of traditional automakers / ICE. In other words, perhaps a bit high, but not necessarily impossible given that TSLA doesn't have to put in a full ICE into their cars, and that battery costs will come down over time. You'd have to form your own opinion. 
"
"
"
"Let's assume the above net income figures are reasonable, and you believe in the end-state P/E multiple of 20x 10 years out (the market is at 17x today, so a bit of a premium) -- now your market cap in 10 years is estimated, at 20x$5B=$100B. Then, you would need to discount this market cap back to today, factoring in both the dilution and the expected return shareholders (i.e. you) would want for owning the shares. 
"
"
"
"Let's start with the dilution: Let's assume a 3% yearly dilution to TSLA's shares outstanding (half of the average of the last 5 years). That dilution increases TSLA's share count by 34% over the course of 10 years, which reduces your earnings (as an early shareholder) power by 25%, which is the same as saying that your portion of the market cap in 10 years is $75B. 
"
"
"
"Let's now discount the $75B back 10 years, to today: Let's assume TSLA's shareholders are extremely generous with their money and only expect  5% yearly returns, which is probably a couple of points too low, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt that investors will extend capital to them below market rates. 
"
"
"
"At 5% a year, this means we will discount approximately 40% off of the $75B to get it to today's time frame. This equates to roughly $45B in today's numbers, which is roughly equal to TSLA's current market cap. 
"
"
"
"In translation, if you believe TSLA will make 1M cars in 10 years, and make $5,000 on each car in profits, then buy TSLA shares today and expect your TSLA shares to appreciate by about 5% a year for 10 years. If you believe they can make 2M cars a year in 10 years, and make the same profits, without diluting themselves more in the process (or levering up more), then buy a lot more. If you believe they will make 1M cars in 10 years, but only make $2,500 a year in profits per car (by achieving the same average profitability as traditional automakers), then sell the stock. 
"
"
"
"If you believe the above base scenario seems reasonable (granted, some of the assumptions are quite generous), then another way to view it is that """"core"""" TSLA is already reflected in the current stock price, but that FSD would be upside to the stock. So maybe use this as a framework to play around with what needs to be true in order to value """"core"""" TSLA, and then you can think about how FSD would change this.

"I think the 5% discount rate is too low, lets make it 10%. Now, I think FSD will be available by EOY 2021, but I'll say 2023 to be conservative, while assuming Tesla is first to mass market. At that point, I would ask you-- if audi or bmw had a full self driving car on the market, how much do you think it would go for? I would expect somewhere on the order of $150-200k, but once again, to be conservative, I would say ASP goes up to $55,000 (extra $5000 cost for FSD, essentially all profit) and margin per vehicle is ~$10,000, in 2023. To adjust fir adoption/take rate of FSD, I'll bring that margin down to $7500 per vehicle, after tax. For the robotaxi network, which should be available at roughly the same time, I'll use these round numbers: weighting for ~25% of the fleet being wholly owned by Tesla, getting 30% of revenue for already-sold cars and 100% for wholly owned, that is an average of (1*.25 + .3*.75) 47.5% of total robotaxi revenue, at $.60/mile margin, and an average of 10,000 taxi miles drivin per car per year (low but accounting for non-participants) and a cumulative fleet if 3 million vehicles and annual sales of 750,000  per car in 2023 (quite conservative IMO). Now we have all the numbers, so:
"
"
"
"- Total after tax margin on sold vehicles: conservative case : 7500*750,000 = $5.625 billion; Bull case: 10,000*1,000,000 = $10 billion
"
"
"
"- Total robotaxi pretax profit: 10,000 miles * 3 million cars * $.60 per mile * 47.5% Tesla takeway: $8.55 billion -- aftertax (25%): $6.41 billion ; bull case: 12,000 miles/car, 4 million cars, $1/mile margin, same percentages (47.5% and 25%): after tax profit:$17.1 billion
"
"
"
"Not even factoring in the enormous opportunities they have in FSD semi trucks, solar power, and other things, which could double the profit numbers I listed above, the more realistic/conservative estimate I made was for ~ $12 billion in after tax earnings in 2023. In my bull case, they have ~ $27 billion in earnings. If they are successful in being first first to mass market with FSD, I expect earnings to be somewhere in between, like $15 billion. Also, since I laid out some of the enormous markets they would have the ability to expand into, I would guess a 25-30x earnings multiple, but here are a couple scenarios: 
"
"
"
"-20x earnings on $12 billion in earnings: $240 billion in market cap (which is sort of my worst case in this model), on $15 billion in earnings: $300 billion, on 27 billion in earnings: $540 billion
"
"
"
"-30x earnings on $12 billion: $360 billion, on $15 billion: $450 billion, on $27 billion: $780 billion

"As a """"most likely"""" scenario, how about $15 billion in earnings, 25x multiple: $375 billion market cap by EOY 2023. Discounting to today at 10% a year (5 years from today), you get $232 billion, which is a rough estimate for what I would guess Tesla should be worth in a market that recognizes their foreseeable solvency and FSD edge. After ~15%  dilution, that number is $200 billion.

Cities like San Francisco, Seattle, and Denver already don't respond to calls regarding homeless people taking a shit on the street, I don't expect they will respond to automated calls from robo-taxis saying there are non-paying passengers inside.

"The point is Tesla would be selling them for even higher. For example, your used Tesla with FSD that you bought in 2019 could sell for $200k, and a new Tesla with FSD could sell for $250k. The numbers could obviously vary, but the point is FSD would make the values of both used cars and new ones go way up.
"
"
"
"> If this is all true, then why are people not hedging their bets and buying them up all now, cheap?
"
"
"
"Because achieving FSD in the stated timeframe by itself is far from guaranteed. No one is going to buy an expensive car just on the chance that this happens.

Outright purchases still have merit in that you can have consumers finance expansion - consumers can pay for the car expenses in cash, up front, and Tesla makes an immediate profit.
"

"

"
"
"
"Legitimate complaint about the interior.  I think Tesla is overly optimistic about adoption and underestimates people 'not wanting their stuff messed up'.  Drivetrain-wise, Tesla thinks their drivetrains can last 1M miles.
"
"
"
"Everyone will have the same idea, and it's a race to the bottom. I'd love to see a realistic breakdown of how much a robotaxi may make. Maybe I'll put something together.
"
"
"
">Agreed it will be a race to the bottom but there's nobody else who can come close to Tesla's theoretical bottom yet, nor is there the volume to undercut the market.  Waymo can't beat the cost of the cars, nor has the volume of cars that Tesla has.  At best they're probably 3 years behind Tesla (if Tesla achieves FSD).  Uber/Lyft are nowhere close to competing in robotaxis.""

"""Hey! Beginning with the capex of deploying the wholly-owned fleet, luckily, they are already spending on it by taking back every leased car, so you can expect them to start accumulating an inventory of wholly-owned vehicles within 2 years with no additional capex/opex (anything sooner they'll probably just sell used I don't know). Either way, I would expect this fleet to be mostly composed of model 3s and Ys to start, which Tesla said during autonomy day already cost less than 35k to produce, and they are shooting for 25k within the next few years. But I do agree that projecting 750k to 1m wholly-owned Teslas is not reasonable if you assume FSD doesn't come until 2023. I let my personal belief that FSD will be available within 2 years get into my head, in which case I would expect Tesla to start putting all of their gross margin into a wholly-owned fleet starting late 2021. So, to the topic of gross margin...
"
"
"
"I said $7,500 average margin on an ASP of $55,000. Looking back, I might actually increase that, and this is why: Tesla has averaged 20% margins for the last year. The most recent quarter is more likely a representation of the margins we can expect in my scenario, which was 12%, but assuming some cost reductions and a return to normal X & S production, I'll say 15%. For that ASP of $55,000, I built in $2500 for FSD. I think this number will be higher, closer to $4000, and it will be pure profit. Still though, I had $52,500 per car ex-FSD, which at 15% margin would be $7875. Add that to FSD and you have margin of $1325 or $1425. Somehow, I find that way too optimistic so I'll stick with the $7500 per vehicle, which implies a gross margin, ex-FSD, of $10.5%. We'll see if they can keep that, but 550,000 cars in FY 2021, 700,000 in 2022, and 750,000 in 2023 (very conservative), that would generate $4.125, $5.25 billion, $5.625 in gross margin, respectively. Assuming they pump all of that back into cars for the fleet at a price of $36,000, $35,000, and $34,000, each year Tesla would add 114,000, 150,000, and 166,000 cars to their fleet, totaling 430,000 cars wholly owned. Say another 100,000 leases end in the meantime, and the fleet is 530,000. I know what you're thinking... they can't collect gross margin from those 500,000 or so vehicles produced each year while also setting 150k or so aside for the fleet. In the model I have outlined thus far, that is true, so they would need to raise capital and expand, which I think investors and Tesla would be very interested in once FSD is released and it is apparent they can make a ton of money. As I said before, I expect they dilute 5% a year, or so. Right now, that would only add ~ 2 billion in cash each year, but once FSD is released, I expect 5% dilution to raise closer to 4-5 billion, so that would be enough to greatly expand production.

"
"1.	Maintenance will be a bigger issue than Elon claims. Tires are expensive. Wheel bearings are expensive. Shocks are not cheap. These are not 1 million mile components. 
"
"2.	supercharger prices are rivaling gas in many places. So you aren‚Äôt winning the fuel price war there. You can fill at home cheaper, but then you lose revenues due to larger charge times. 
"
"3.	doing this for a few years with cars on the road now will result in the need for a new battery pack. Elon said 300-500k miles on current gen. That‚Äôs a pricey change out. I heard no mention of that. 
"
"4.	your paint will go to shit, your interior will get beat to shit. If you‚Äôre ok with that then ok. But miles are hard on exteriors. In and out of cars is tough on upholstery. Ask an Uber or Lyft driver who‚Äôs done it a while.

"""Financials can easily go awry even if the tech is ready. A lot of things are possible that people simply don't want to spend money on. So, I would not underestimate the importance of being able to view a company's books. A private company's goal is to offer initial investors a way to liquidate their assets, either through IPO or by acquisition. Neither of these deals guarantee that the buyer on the other end gets a company that will hold its value.""

"""Releasing FSD relatively soon is definitely a huge question mark, and it's why I'm not sinking all my money into TSLA shares and taking out loans for as many cars as I can get my hands on. Same for everyone else.
"
"
"
"But I think regardless of how many cars they have on the road, FSD would still massively increase prices. Just like there's not a substantial price difference in Toyota Camrys if 5,000,000 of them are on the road versus 1,000,000. There's still plenty either way, and they're still thousands of dollars just based on what they offer.
"
"
"
"Also, keep in mind the vast majority of people aren't buying the FSD option on their cars right now due to lack of features/reliability, so the number of FSD cars on the road could actually be quite small when the technology really starts to take off. And obviously the FSD software toggle will become super expensive when that happens.""

"""That I completely agree with.  Software 2.0 is somewhat of a misnomer in that way, but for that subset of problems it is far better than coding.

The technology boils down to a calculus problem but it also matters that the calculations can be expressed in  terms of linear algebra because matrix operations are what GPUs specialize in.""

"It doesn't tell you anything, because they could be fudging all of these numbers, as untold numbers of companies have done throughout history. That's why we have GAAP accounting standards, and even with those, companies like Enron managed to continue going for quite awhile without anyone realizing they were high-risk and shouldn't have been valued so highly.
"
"
"
"You're pretty green if you're taking SpaceX's statements at face value. Did you know Uber fares are discounted because of investor money? Every company is a risky investment, and you should never invest in an individual one without getting familiar with their finances unless you just don't care about losing the money. But if you're young, it makes a ton more sense to invest in an index 500 fund, as you're automatically hedged against a lot of risk, likely to get a good return, and you earn a lot more by investing early.""

"
"  
"
"The suspects are white and between 20 and 30 years old, according to the police department. One is around 5 feet 11 inches tall and 190 pounds while the other is believed to have been around 5 feet 9 inches tall and 170 pounds.  
"

"
"Both men were wearing black hats. The taller man was also wearing black sunglasses, a black shirt with """"Merica"""" written on the front, dark blue jeans and black flip-flops.

"""I used to rely on EPA ranges for rule of thumb estimates too, until I saw that Teslabjorn video with Tesla Model X being at exact same energy consumption as Jaguar i-Pace and only 10% ahead of Audi e-tron. That did not make any sense according to their EPA ranges \*or\* their WLTP ranges. That is when I started reading into what those range figures \*actually\* mean and how the testing is done. And what I found out (it's right there in the test protocol) is that they test range by driving the cars for 10-15 minutes at both low and high speeds with rapid accelerations and rapid slowdowns between them. That is nowhere near how people drive on long range highway journeys (where long range matters most). Those tests favour lighter cars due to that. And that is why you see in the real world Audi e-tron being \*far\* more frugal on long drives than their ratings would suggest it should be.
"
"
"
"When testing ICE cars EPA and WLTP give two consumption figures - urban and highway. For EVs that all gets mushed together somehow and reduced to one range figure. That is not realistic. An EV would have radically different range in city driving and on long range, stable highway driving. And different EVs produce different ratios between those values. This is the information that we need from EPA and WLTP, but that is not what they are providing. Their range value only tells you how much that car would drive in their torture scenario, but there is no way to relate that to how far your car will drive at 90km/h on highway or at 120km/h on highway or in city stop-and-go traffic. And that is why these ratings are useless, as in not serving their intended purpose.""
