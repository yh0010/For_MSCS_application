Let's round it up to 0.3m past the underside to allow for the wheel arch gaps. This means that the car in the vid is very close to floating. The ground clearance is about 15cm, add the 30cm from the underside of the car to make it float and you only need about 45cm of water for it to float. That's a mere foot and a half.

"For comparison, my old diesel LandCruiser weighs the same. But it doesn't have the flat bottom that the Model X has and it has more ground clearance.

"""My thoughts as well. And as far as i know most F1 drivers has no experience at Nurburgring, Nordschleife as it is not used as one of the race tracks on F1 as it is considered way too dangerous for Formula 1. So, Rosberg might have no enough experience on the track itself that it will require many practice lap to get to know it. Race Car Drivers like Lars Kern from Porsche that took the 991 GT2 RS around Nordschleife at 6:47 and 6:40 with a GT2 RS Manthey Racing is a kind of different story though it's very obvious that guy is very experienced at Nordschleife.
"
"
"
"Not saying that Rosberg is not a good driver, he certainly is, but very long old Nordschleife with lots of corners and long straights is unlike most other race tracks. It's famous for being very demanding and a established benchmark for most car manafacturers. And you definitely want a real very experienced race car driver at that certain track.""

"""F1 drivers, and especially F1 WDC winning drivers are a different calibre of driver.

"
"
"Yes I'm sure there are lots of good drivers that have driver the Nürburgring hundreds of times and know it better than anyone, but if you gave Nico the same amount of time to practice he would surely beat them hands down. 
"

"They are F1 drivers because they are literally the best drivers in the world. An advanced Nürburgring driver could **not** switch between driving there, and driving an F1 race, where vice versa is very common.

"Not gonna disagree with you on that. But look at the numbers:

"Tesla Model S P100D:\~4900lbs, 778hp 734tq, 0.24 drag coefficient, 2.3 0-60, 10.2s 0-100-0

"Porsche Taycan Turbo S: 5100lbs, 751hp, 774tq, 0.25 drag coefficient, 2.6s 0-60, 10.7s 0-100-0
"
"
"
"So the Model S is a lighter car with more hp, less drag, a faster 0-60, and a faster 0-100-0. The only thing the Porsche wins on is the torque.
"
"
"
"So, theoretically, if there's any single advantage the Porsche has, it's that that gearbox of theirs will give them an advantage at high speed. If all Tesla needs to do is put a bigger battery cooling unit on the Model S, then I've got bad news for Porsche.

"
"
"
"Take [this]( suspension diagram.
"
"
"
"On the Taycan and Model S, the coil spring is replaced with an adjustable air bag. The bar inside the spring is the shock absorber, which again on both Model S and Taycan has an actively adjustable damper. On both cars, the spring rate (air bag) and damping rate (shock) can be adjusted on the fly.
"
"
"
"If you've been keeping up with the Raven Model S, the adjustable dampers is what was introduced with it (It previously already had the airbags).
"
"
"
"Now direct your attention to the bar along the bottom, the sway bar, or anti-rollbar (ARB). 
"
"
"
">An anti-roll bar (roll bar, anti-sway bar, sway bar, stabilizer bar) is a part of many automobile suspensions that helps reduce the body roll of a vehicle during fast cornering or over road irregularities. It connects opposite (left/right) wheels together through short lever arms linked by a torsion spring. A sway bar increases the suspension's roll stiffness—its resistance to roll in turns, independent of its spring rate in the vertical direction.
"
"
"
"On the Model S, X, 3 and 99% of cars on the road, this is a solid piece of metal. Depending on the material the bar is made of, how thick it is, and how it's mounted changes the how the two wheels on the axle interact with each other. Thicker bars mean less roll, etc.
"
"
"
"On the Taycan, the sway bar is two pieces, and each side is attached to an electric 48-volt motor. Varying the amount of torque from the motor changes the effective stiffness of the rollbar. So, for example, you turn the steering wheel, it will automatically jack up the stiffness of the outside roll bars to counter the body roll, or to change front/rear stiffness to alter under/oversteer characteristics, etc.

Looking at the pictures, I don't see a silhouette of the center back seat and another side pic looked like a silhouette of a roll cage to stiffen the chassis. Like the Laguna Seca car, I think this is gutted. Why try so hard to hide the interior? Subie did a record attempt with their gutted STI RA and was almost a minute faster than their production car.

"
"""Using the Pagani Zonda R’s time of 6:47, this is still an achievement. But I’m not really interested in what an allegedly stripped model S can do with a drivetrain that may or may not be sold to the public on tires that certainly will not be sold to the public.

"Alternatively, run the plaid drivetrain as it will be sold to the public. But either way, adding new wheels and tires and stripping the interior beyond putting in a more bolstered bucket seat makes the numbers even less relevant to a consumer than a Nurburgring time already is.""

"""First of all I would like to say that I am impressed. driving 7:23 around the nordschleife is a truly impressive lap time, beating Porsche even more.
"
"
"
"But I would also like to add a few things that are a bit interesting.
"
"
"
"Porsche claims to have driven the lap in a customer spec Porsche Taycan. Except they put a racing seat in it and installed a rollcage. Other than that it was driven with the Porsche Taycan Prototype build within customer spec.
"
"
"
"I will be honest if I can say that Tesla is far off any customer car. They added a 3rd engine, and drove with racing tyres. The tyres alone will help the car achieve a far better time than with customer tyres, but it has to be said that I have no idea with what kind of tyre compound Porsche drove. Tesla also changed aerodynamics, wheelarches for even wider tyres and overall power (3rd engine). Sadly we haven't gotten any specifications on the power output of the Model S P100D+ but I would guess it makes somewhere around 600kw based on the 450kw P100D which would defeat the Porsche by 40kw when using overboost
"
"
"
"So yes, still impressive but with changes like that not really surprising.
"
"
"
"EDIT: I've read through a few sources regarding the third engine. Since they will most likely use the best engine possible they will give the car 3 Model 3 engines producing a combined power output of about 861hp (633kw) beating Porsche by over 70kw / 100hp (JUST ASSUMPTIONS - NOT CONFIRMED)
"
"
"
"EDIT 2: I also have to make corrections on the Porsche Taycan... 1st it only makes 560kw when in Launch control, and 2nd Porsche used the Taycan Turbo and not the Taycan turbo S. The Power output when driven remains the same between the two but both only give out 460kw (625 hp) tesla wouldn't outpower the porsche by 40 or 70 kw but by 173kw (235 hp)""
"
"So are we just not calling it the Nurburgring anymore? Is that passe?
"
"""I don't really want to believe in most leaked times. Because I kind of heard the same back with Porsche 919 Evo back then that it did sub 5 minutes lap time something like 4:50s or something but turned out that it was only 5:19. Still absolutely impressive still blew me away, but not really the same lap time as claimed by the third party sources. So, i will personally wait for the Official time. And also this lap time is probably measured on BTG Lap which is shorter than Full Track considering that isn't a official closed track lap time.""

"What does modified mean? Put a Tesla badge on a Ferrari?

"""Now do a wider, extra active winged, plaid Model X.

"Nope, that's wrong, the Porsche Taycan was heavily modified too, it was *not* a production car:
"

"- The Porsche Taycan pre-production prototype was first seen testing on the Nürburgring in May, the record was set in August, while the first production Taycan [rolled off the production lines last week on September 9](.
"
"- The Taycan was heavily modified, with interior ripped out presumably to reduce mass, literally: [see this photo evidence from Porsche's own video](.
"
"- The Taycan also had rear seats ripped out and a roll cage added, [see this photo evidence](.
"
"- The Taycan had non-production """"summer tires"""" according to Porsche's own press statement: """"production 21-inch wheels wrapped in summer tires"""". Porsche never specified the tires they used and how sticky they were.
"
"- The 7:42 Taycan Nürburgring lap time is not official, [according to Nürburgring officials](.

"Edit #2: to the Nürburgring truthers down-thread who are in denial about Tesla beating Porsche's racing performance: a 3-motor EV drive train with no transmission overhead and a ~10% larger battery pack made by the undisputed EV market leader is **technologically superior** to Porsche's 2-motor EV drive train with a 2-speed transmission, and the 7:23 Nürburgring time proves this. Now the ball is IMO in Porsche's court: will they upgrade the Taycan's drivetrain to a 3-motor design, will they upgrade the battery pack and will they throw out the unnecessary 2-speed transmission, to be able to keep up with Tesla's racing performance?

I won't deny it's possible they went fully permanent magnet, but I currently don't see a reason to assume they did just because of heat. Having both types allows them to play to the advantages of both motors and make the car more versital, especially important on a twisty track. IMO""

There's a small parking lot they go to and most businesses in the outlet actually welcome them. There's a shop for coffee for the morning, a restaurant for breakfast, a bank if someone decides to buy a car from the show, etc. It works well and it's one of the few places they haven't been asked to leave, despite asking for permission for each location.

"I'm not one to start internet shit, but to make a jab at a few comments above:
"
"
"
"It doesn't suck seeing the same cars everytime. Its not a contest of who can afford the most variety of cars. What I enjoy seeing is the same car but with something different about it each time. Ricky finally got those new wheels, they look great! Devon managed to get his Coyote swap he's been dying over. Rachel got a sick paint job with matching interior. But with all the same cars. Small car events I find are usually about showing off the project, not showing off the ego.
"
"
"
"Going back on to the main issue at hand, I think if someone were to ask for a spot most of these people would offer to move. I know if it were me, I would move and even ask them if they'd want to join. Like a few others have said, there's a lot of car people out there who enjoy Tesla too. We don't really see this problem where I live because Tesla isn't quite a bit thing here yet, but even still.

"It's not wrong to say that yeah,they shouldn't be in those spots, but perhaps they've been directed to be there and perhaps they would move if asked.

"
"
"
"It's a mistake, but the whole situation isn't known. Like it's been mentioned, maybe they were given permission or were told to park there, and it's just the writer or even viewers making it out to be a bad situation. It's not like it's saying that these people stood their ground and told off Tesla owners over the spots, no, it's just showing cars in spots. Perhaps some of these people would be nice and would move entirely, Perhaps some are the assholess of the group and wouldnt move.

"Yes.. although it doesn’t much help if the speed limit data is wrong to begin with (I hope they change to to using vision to read signs and falling back to map data when that’s not available).

"""Outside of driving on non-highway roads, my car doesn’t change speed based on current speed limit zone. I wish it did. Or is there a setting I’m missing?

"""I would also like it to start accelerating earlier. At least here in Finland the convention is you start accelerating when you see the speed sign, and when you reach it, you’re pretty much at that speed.
"
"
"
"If I let my Tesla do its thing, it’ll wait just long enough for the person behind me to get pissed off, and then when they try to pass me, it slams on the accelerator right at the sign, so they can’t pass after all. Very easy method to get road rage targeted at you!
"
"
"
"So a more gradual acceleration starting earlier would flow way better with traffic here.
"
"

"""My question: how can a regular human driver know in advanced to slow down before he/she sees the speed sign? Unless he drive the same road before and remember where the next speed sign is and what the speed limit is.
"
"
"
"I would say that law works like this is not reasonable, or intentional designed to trap drivers.""
"
"Tweet this to Elon
"
"""To add to this, it would be nice if Nav On Autopilot adjusted speeds based on your lane. Sometimes I’ll be cruising at 80 in the fast lane, but it will maintain 80 as it changes over closer to the exit. 
"
"
"
"It’s a hard problem to solve but on a 4-lane highway it should be dropping down 5mph each lane it moves toward the right.""
"
"""*(Note: I don't have a Tesla)*  I think having some way to trigger the slowdown ahead of time would be nice.  It would act as a notification that a change in speed limit is about to happen and the driver can at any time start to begin slowing down.  That gives the car the opportunity to determine at what rate it needs to slow down prior to reaching the sign.  If you like to slow down gradually, you can elect to begin the slowdown sooner than others.  If you don't choose to slow down it would wait until the last reasonable moment to *safely* slow down and initiate it for you.
"
"
"
"The programmer in me would then argue that this is a variable I should be able to set & forget somewhere without having to trigger it for each speed change.  Hmmm, maybe a simple, passive aggressive """"Are you an aggressive driver?"""" prompt when you first set it up? ;)""
"
"""This has been bugging me too, I’m sure it must be on their todo list to implement. Would be good to get it sooner rather than later!""
"
"""Completely understandable. This is how it should be in all countries. Maybe allow a few miles over at sign. If Denmark cops are dickheads, then need a cop dickhead factor adjustment (Cool, Uptight, Dickhead).""
"
"""Maybe it's different depending where you drive, but at least on my route it definitely slows down before the speed limit changes. The road I commute on goes from 55 to 40 mph for a brief segment. It slows down before I enter the 40 and doesn't speed up until I'm past the 55 mph sign.""
"
"""Just curious, in your case, do you set your TACC at exactly the speed limit, or do you want it to adjust with an offset? For example, are you driving at 90 and want it to slow down to 60 (10 over limit) before you reach the sign?""
"
"""I actually got a ticket once because of this very issue. It did start to slow down a couple seconds after passing the sign, but by then the cop was already behind me 😂""
"
"""Its called posted speed limit data, the issue is that it changes alot and would require constant upkeep. 
"
"
"
"Is it a problem worth solving? The ai is just doing what a human would do right? Re see adapt etc..""
"
"Tweet that at Elon
"
"I wish I could set my speed to be more than 5 over.  No one drives that slow where I live and I'm usually causing a problem doing 35 in a 30.
"
"""Make it optional, call it 'reasonable max mode'.""
"
"I think the car remembers your speed limit the last time you were at a specific location? I ask because when I merge into the interstate near me The speed limit is 65 miles an hour. For some reason when I pull onto the interstate the car and wants to go 25 miles an hour and a half to quickly adjust the speed to get up. I don’t know why it does that but I guess at one point I was going 25 miles an hour at that specific period?
"
"In the US the line would be flat and higher up.
"
"Someone tweet Elon!
"
"Does the ACC system rely on signage for the speed set point or GPS & map data? Because I rarely see speed signs indicating reduced limits ahead. I’m not sure how the system would react if it’s solely based on observed road signs.
"
"What a confusing Pic.
"
"Approved
"
"I don't understand this graphic at all. Can someone explain it for a non-owner?
"
"How many meters past the sign are they allowed to start setting up speed enforcement camera's? Usually it's quite a distance so even with the delay the car would be decelerating and be fine?
"
"""> at least here in Denmark...
"
"
"
"You mean """"at least, here on earth.""""  The Spaceman Roadster might not have a speed limit, but everywhere else, that few hundred feet to drop down to legal speed is often where police hang out. After all, it's all about enhancing revenue - especially in North America - not safety. 
"
"
"
"Plus for some reason when I select cruise control, it (usually, not always) insists on jumping up to 5kph over the limit - which would be OK if it was correct about the speed limit, but it's not unusual for it to miss a speed limit change and show the older limit, or sometimes not even drop down (or up) although it displays the correct limit. I haven't figured out the pattern for that behaviour.
"
"
"
"Cruise control should set to the speed you're at. If you want limit-plus-5, then tap the speed limit sign on the screen.""
"
"My guess is this comes from the engineers trying to mimic what human drivers do more closely. A person will only start slowing down when they see the sign. They are also attempting to not anger the other drivers by slowing down too early. Systems are always full of trade offs.
"
"""You should try the BMW ACC. They have this implemented, even connected to the driving mode (eco, sport) and it also reacts to round abouts or sharp corners.""
"
"In Utah at slowing down after a speed limit sign is legal for 500 feet. I would much rather have autopilot let me control the speed at any time and go more than 5mph over for places where it is wrong. I go though a 35mph time dependent school zone and it practically slams on the breaks every day.
"
"""Don't know about Danish law but in the Netherlands it's not allowed for police to fine you within reasonable distance after a speed limit decrease. This means you are fully allowed to drive 80 until passing the 50 sign and release the accelerator to slow down to the new limit. Conversely you are allowed to start speeding up in time to be up at 80 when passing the sign.
"
"
"
"There have also been well publicized cases of thousands of fines getting annulled because they were recorded too close after a speed limit change.""
"
"Well. Their cruise control do what I do. I slow down when I pass the sign. So I hope they won't change this.
"
"Plus I wish Tesla would allow you to bypass some of these.  In the UK when schools are closed at night I look like an idiot doing 20mph along a big wide free stretch of road!
"
"""This is something I've been concerned about when watching videos. I'm fortunate enough that my commute has no speed cameras on it but camera vans do like to lurk close to speed limit changes. This would be much better, exactly how I would expect it to react. Just make the car respond to speed limit changes earlier and with a more gradual (configurable) change in speed.""
"
"""Before that I think we need speed signs recognition... Right now if you have a construction zone (with lowered speed limit) the car will stick with the """"regular"""" speed limit. 
"
"
"
"Worse, the current logic for cruise control and AP is beyond absurd :
"
"
"
"Cruise control : Set the speed to current or posted, whichever is HIGHER. Should be """"whichever is LOWER""""
"
"
"
"AP : Set the speed to posted speed. Should be same as CC proposed above.
"
"
"
"
"
"Fix the TACC and AP speed logic, add speed signs recognition, then yes I agree the car should anticipate speed changes more.""
"
"Same problem in Sweden.
"
"""All these comments are why you have to pay attention and hold the wheel while using Autopiliot, I guess.""
"
"Would be great if AP adjust speed on highway as well. My model s only auto change speed on regular road. Why doesn’t it change from/to 120kmph and 100?
"
"""You'll find that most drivers opt for option 1 above.
"
"
"
"That is, if they slow down at all...
"
"
"
"But, yes, I agree that when the car is doing the driving it should do option 2, which is the legally correct way to do it.""
"
"""If y’all can afford a Tesla, y’all can afford a ticket.""
"
"""Most countries have a minimal distance between change of speed and radar traps e.g. (like 150 meters in most of germany), as allowing otherwise would be insanely stupid jurisdiction obviously, denmark no?""
"
"""considering how fast a tesla decelerates with its regenerative braking, the cop would have been a massive asshole if he still manages to catch you. That would mean that he was positioned about 10-20 meter after a change in speed limit sign. Dickmove. I think in the Netherlands police will never position themselves within 300 meters of a speed limit change.""
"
"""From the looks of this thread, I'm clearly in a minority, but I wish they wouldn't adjust my SET speed AT ALL until/unless I'm using real FSD.  IMO, if we're supposed to be driving, we should be choosing the SET speed, end of discussion.  Should it be intelligent/adaptive and slow down for slower vehicles?  Sure.  Should it run at a lower speed if auto-steer requires it for whatever reason?  Sure.  I'm just saying the speed I SET should NOT change, especially not with the current database, which is terrible.""
"
"How could I make a graphic like this?
"
"Worse is its total disregard to playground/school zones (at least here in Calgary).
"
"I mean this should probably just be the default with no option to change tbh
"
"Why don't we teach horses to drive?
"
"""In Norway you don't see changes from 80 to 50 too often; they are supposed to either have a reduction (usually it goes to 70) and then to 50, or at least a heads up sign indicating that the speed limit will drop to 50 in 200m. If you're speed trapped right after the 50 and there is no such warning you have good odds for getting away with it. (But don't take my word for it; follow the speed limits)""
"
"I'd rather it never change speeds on its own since it's just cruise control. It brakes rather aggressively and sometimes its outdated info cause they're not reading signs
"
"""Tweet this to Elon, might work!""
"
"No way. Lots of wrong speedlimits already. I wish it wouldn't react to limits at all.
"
"Maybe press on the brake pedal when you see the sign?
"
"And I wish it would speed up sooner in the reverse situation.
"
"""I think it assumes reasonable policing, cops are supposed to give you some distance to slow down veggie they stay enforcing. Still, I twice got ticketed for going above the speed limit a few hundred feet after a sign. I challenged the fine both times and they both got dropped (and the cop in one of the cases received a reprimand). 
"
"But it was certainly annoying you have to go through that.""
"
"""I think that’s ridiculous. When you see the sign, then you know the speed limit.""
"
"Drive the car yourself then
"
"""Not sure about Denmark but you would have to be a real asshole of a cop to post up right next to a speed limit sign. Haven’t come across a cop doing that here in Canada, yet.""
"
"""Not really possible unless it sees the sign a km ahead. Cops are dicks and stand right next to the sign. Even driving normally you can't slow down in time, especially at this speeds""
"
"""I like the diagram and the idea, but I think it's federal law that you can only be cited for a speed limit if you haven't *started decelerating* at the point where your car passes the speed limit sign. So as it's a good idea, I personally think it should be perfectly in between the first and the second diagram.""
"
"""Or Denmark should be more lax in speed regulations, that is they should place signs earlier than the capture device rather than expecting someone or something to hit 50 _exactly_ as they see or pass the sign. They should even revisit their speed limits in areas where it is clearly too low. For example one highway in my country has a 60 speed limit when 70 or 80 is a good pace. Most accidents are due to bad training, turning without looking and indicators, lane splitting, no headlights at night or low visibility conditions (effin idiots seriously) and hardly due to speeding alone albeit it is a factor as there is less time to react.
"
"
"
"But that's just me.""
"
"""Sorry to be the contrarion. While I love the diagram, this is contrary to how humans drive. Since others won't slow down until they see the sign, you will be creating a dangerous situation when no one is anticipating that you will slow down.""
"
"That's if it even sees the speed limit signage.
"
"I wouldn't have understood what they were talking about without it lol
"
"Elon should do this just because of the diagram. Nice work!
"
"""I agree, but label your axes! I thought that the car was going down a hill. :)""
"
"This guy UIs.

"""This feature should be called phil's cruise control, with this diagram explaining what the option does""

"What was used to make this?
"
"The diagram of getting rear-ended by common drivers
"
"""It does the same with upcoming merges. Once it gets to a specific part on the map it just does a sudden slowdown and marks a car in the merging lane to follow behind. They should make it more gradual.
"
"
"
"Another behavior is cars cutting into your lane - there should be an intermediate step where the car slows down a little bit if it looks like a car if coming in, but not a sharp braking reaction.""
"
"""Yup, it will happily head into a 70 zone doing 105 while showing you the allowed speed.
"
"
"
"That‘s not what I would call Autopilot.""
"
"""Or, oppositely, when the road is going from 30 to 50 — especially on town roads where people are very familiar with the change — it sucks to have the car delay (causing other drivers to tailgate).
"
"
"
"To make make the social matter worse, the car then punches the acceleration once in the new speed zone, making it appear like you’re saying, “haha! fuck you!” and aggressively racing away.
"
"
"
"... would be really nice if we had an opt-in to “preemptively change speed”.""

"""It reads the sign as it passes it, it can't depend on a database that can be out of date.""
"
"""Yes, absolutely""

"""Yes, this is especially bad when it's wrong about the speed limit reduction. Then you look like an idiot for slamming your brakes for no reason, and it's potentially dangerous.

"
"If it was more gradual at least you would have time to notice that it's reducing speed incorrectly and intervene.""

"
"""AP1 for sure is reading the signs. However, autopilot uses (google’s?) map database for automatically setting cruise control.

"
"""Well - as the AP is based on deep learning - and since most human drivers (also in Denmark) first slow down very close to or after the sign, i guess that could be the reason why. Whether Tesla has the ability to tweak on this specific measure I don't know ^^""

Several F1 cars, F40, F40 Le Mans, F50, La Ferrari, Scuderia, 333, 430, 360, 550, 575, 458, F12, Testarossa, Enzo, you name it.

"""I really don't think that Tesla ever cared much about vehicle dynamics. the MS was really a pioneer car, but also a 'Boat' to drive. The M3 is much better, but with a Benuzzi + Fedeli combo it could probably be much better, but I don't think Musk cares a bit beside the 0 to 60. I beleive it's a precise choice that I never understood. Remember the comical steering wheel of the MS or the horrible brakes of the first versions? They had great Brembos, but nobody really cared about optimizing them. On the other hand, we got AutoPilot and a lot of other things. To a classic automotive guy in the business it is still strange that Tesla does not fix dynamics that would be cheap and easy to make better. As far as I know, they do not have anyone amazing with the right pedigree that takes care of certain things. After all it's an American car and it never really mattered much if it has good handling, or proper brakes, etc. That's more an European thing / obsession.""

I personally don't think Lidar is required (due to HW3), but for the sake of argument, since we don't precisely know how much compute is required for object recognition / image processing to determine distance data, it's quite possible having a sensor that spits out distance data with no additional processing would lessen the compute burden to determine distance.  Sure it's a crutch, but technically, it could open up the bottleneck by reducing compute burden for distance determination.""

"Model x is designed to drive itself only for the most part. So towing adds a lot of drag. Semi's are designed for airflow to include the trailers
"
"""I think there is a simple solution, electrify the trailers. I doubt this will be done short term, but in the case of something like a model X towing, I think if what you were towing had its own batteries on board it would also be range extending, though it would add a few thousand to the cost of a trailer.
"
"
"
"The biggest loss is aerodynamic unless you are going uphill as well though. It is possible it isn't an issue for the semi as much since the cab is so aerodynamically integrated into the traditional cargo box.

"Personally, I am not that concerned about the semi. The larger the vehicle the more efficent it is to move per KG which is why it's cheaper to ship a lot of product on a single large vehicle than on many smaller ones.
"
"
"
"If you consider the model X without a trailer to be a transportation appliance and you look at its performance when fully loaded as a passenger vehicle (full passengers plus trunk and frunk cargo) and look at range loss that way, it will probably be similar for the semi.
"
"
"
"If the semi has something like 400 kwh pack and consumes 1kwh of output per mile on the highway, it's not really an issue. You would still have over 400 miles of range combined. I doubt the semi will consume that much, whereas 400 kwh of batteries is totally doable, as that comes out to about 2600 lbs of cell weight, and depending on packaging likely under 4,000 lbs gross weight, and that is still not a huge portion of a 75,000 lb gross vehicle weight. Even if electric trucks carry 10% less cargo, they will still be economically superior to a diesel powered vehicle because of fuel cost and maintenance savings. Simply put, you can have 10% more vehicles and still spend less on shipping.""

I calculated that I save about $100 per month in gas, so that's $8000 so far, and the car has a lot of life left.

"The interesting question is: How is the Supercharger itself powered?

"For example:
"
"
"
"Suppose the Supercharger is connected to the grid via a 22 kW connection (3 32 A phases, each at 230 V).

"
"
"Then by drawing 22 kW continuously (24/7) from the grid, it would be able to deliver 120 kW for (just over) 24h \* 22 kW / 120 kW = 4 hours every day.
"
"
"
"This would require about 500 kWh of storage capacity (since 22 kW \* 24 h = 530 kWh), depending on how spread out over the day the stalls would deliver power.
"
"
"
"&#x200B;
"
"

"PS. A 500 kWh battery delivering 100 kW (with another 20 kW taken directly from the grid) would be seeing a very gentle charge-rate of 100 kW / 500 kWh = 0.2/h.""

There is zero accounting for this in current proposals so huge users will stop shedding in peak periods so you again have balancing issues.

"* short range aircraft — reduced noise and operation cost make them the best option within their limited range

A back of the napkin calculation says you'd need about double the mass to have the same """"fuel"""" range – 400 tonnes rather than 200 tonnes – but that's easily solvable by splitting into multiple locomotives.

"But he just used it in a garage with no nearby cars.

"You think so? They should take it off the website then if they already know Canadian laws prevent it from being enabled here.

"Not necessarily. Enhanced Summon requires a continuous press. The law might just say that you have to have continuous press on.
