">Ice-nine is a fictional material appearing in Kurt Vonnegut's novel Cat's Cradle. Ice-nine is supposedly a polymorph of water more stable than common ice; instead of melting at 0 ¬∞C, it melts at 45.8 ¬∞C. When ice-nine comes into contact with liquid water below 45.8 ¬∞C, it acts as a seed crystal and causes the solidification of the entire body of water, which quickly crystallizes as more ice-nine. As people are mostly water, ice-nine kills nearly instantly when ingested or brought into contact with soft tissues exposed to the bloodstream, such as the eyes. In the story, it is developed by the Manhattan Project for use as a weapon, but abandoned when it becomes clear that any quantity of it would have the power to destroy all life on earth. A global catastrophe involving freezing the world's oceans with ice-nine is used as a plot device in Vonnegut's novel. Vonnegut came across the idea while working at General Electric:""

"
"
"
"1. This IS for replacement MCU. 
"
"
"
"2. Until a few days ago, the replacement MCU did have 4 year/50k mike warranty. 
"
"
"
"3. MCU 1 was prone to premature failure because the firmware was doing excessive logging to its eMMC memory causing memory wearout. 
"
"
"
"4. Failure could occur anywhere between 25k to 75k miles but generally speaking happened around 50k miles. 
"
"
"
"5. Tesla didn‚Äôt fix this software issue until last year so if the MCU ran any firmware before that, it had a shortened life already. 
"
"
"
"6. This change is happening right as reports are coming out that AP3 upgrade on the old MCU 1 computers is causing the UI to be very laggy and unresponsive presumably because AP3 is more taxing on the MCU and it maybe accelerating the eventual failure. 
"
"
"
"7. It‚Äôs also happening when a lot of owners are getting upgrades to the MCU2 (which also gets this lower warranty) or are paying out of Pocket for Tesla to give them refurbished MCU1. Owners generally didn‚Äôt care it was refurbished because before this, at least it had a 4 year warranty. Let‚Äôs also not forget about the NHTSA investigation into these premature failures.

"
"Logic struggles to upvote the bad news... (but I still did it)""
"
"Mcu?
"
"""I'm curious what people think of the following potential explanation for the 2 year warranty on replacement MCU1s:
"
"
"
"Perhaps Tesla is starting to reuse all the MCU1s that have had the flash issue. So units with typically 4+ years of usage, get new life with a new flash chip, and Tesla warranties the refurb MCU1 for 2 more years - effectively meaning they expected 4+2=6 years+ of life out of that MCU1. 6 year MINIMUM expected lifepsan seems somewhat reasonable for a piece of electronics (obviously not ideal, but reasonable)
"
"
"
"Plus, lets not ignore the fact that the flash chips with 4+ years of life were only that short because for a long part of their life, they were logging excessively, artificially shortening their life. With that situation now addressed, any new flash chips in refurb MCUs are likely to last MUCH longer - it could be quite possible for refurb MCUs to last upwards of 10 years (given they still do write more than they need to, which means they still have a countdown until failure). Of course, MCUs can fail for reasons other than the flash module, but since that's what the OP seems most focused on, its also the focus of the above conjecture.
"
"
"
"Thoughts?
"
"
"
"Edit: And question - the above assumes Tesla is using repaired and remanufactured MCU1s for replacement purposes. I admit to not knowing the regulations around this - can others please enlighten me, is there a law mandating Tesla only use brand new parts for repairs, or are they able to indeed use 'remanufactured' (ie flash replaced) MCU1s?""
"
"""I'm hung up on seeing the high-voltage battery only has a 4-year 50,000 mile warranty. Is that new for the model S? Sounds really crappy.""

"""I think the biggest money thing for them to supply is access to the supercharger network.  That's one of the biggest roadblocks to buying an EV that isn't a Tesla, is you have limited access to public chargers.  If they can lease/license them out to big automakers, then they've just increase revenues a ton.""
"
"If they really want to accelerate EV adoption they should be looking to support 3rd party vehicles with the Supercharger network.

"Cool!  However isn't Elon suing a number of competitors for stealing technology?!
"
"""Wasn‚Äôt it the plan all along tho? I mean, at some point it‚Äôll may be more profitable to do so: Tesla have a solid market share, but they can‚Äôt grab all of it, so just make money out of the rest thorough licensing and part sells.""
"
"""Willing to offer batteries and powertrains to other manufacturers yet my car is in a Tesla service centre coming up to a one year anniversary, it needs a replacement battery and powertrain and they still haven't carried out the work. They mishandle your car and then try and cover up their mistakes. Biggest bunch of fraudsters I've ever met.""
"
"""No large manufacturer will rely on a competitor for all their EV powertrains.
"
"
"
"Also, while I'd argue that Tesla is cutting edge on EV powertrain components, what makes a Tesla unique is there vehicles are built from the ground up as an EV, with Tesla having created many of their own purpose-built, highly efficient automotive EV components.  They don't rely on as many OEM providers (who are still working to transition) like other manufactures.  A lot of the efficiency and cost savings come from those components.""

"
"""Love it.  But this is a trojan horse from a business perspective.  
"
"
"
"Other auto makers who licenses from Tesla would not set aside development resource to compete with Tesla on those features.  Tesla will have less competitors.""
"
"Do they want to be like Microsoft and get 75% of the market share for OS.  Or like Apple which gets less than 10%.... tough choice!
"
"""I think this reply reveals more than Elon intended. To me it shows where Tesla are heading, **they want to be the main supplier of FSD software and BEV platform to the entire auto industry.** They must be sitting on some significant improvements in battery tech and manufacturing to have this confidence. I think in ten years Tesla will supply a significant proportion of the underpinnings of the worlds vehicles (and incidentally be the biggest most valuable corp in the world),  with the Chinese making up the rest. I would not be surprised if, at that point, you can no longer buy a car from Tesla; their entire output will be for their own robotaxi and delivery (using the Semi) fleets, Boring company rapid transit vehicles, and various sized skateboard platforms for other car makers.
"
"
"
"The skateboards could come in 3 sizes for production line standardization, with full FSD software/hardware package (sensors/cameras etc), just drop a body and interior on top, add your own software skin and boom, instant BEV.
"
"
"
"I wouldn't be surprised if negotiations for supply are already happening behind the scenes with some of the more desperate ICE makers. Covid 19 has changed the game, and some will not even survive this year, let alone in 5 years time without something like this. They have been caught out by the speed the market has changed, and Elon just threw them a lifeline.""
"
"the battery investor day can't come soon enough. Elon and VW's CEO already shared a stage and are bros. After the battery investor day if they showcase a way to remove battery bottleneck I see Tesla becoming VW's primary supplier for the MEB platform.

"It's just my wet dream, but I hate any connectors other than Tesla.""
"
"""Tesla doesn‚Äôt manufacture battery cells.  For example, 100% of their M3s in China contain LG cells in the cars batteries. My understanding is they have an NDL with their mysterious supplier for their American care and Powerwalls. *cough* LG again *cough*""

"I'm surprised there's no delivery vans yet. Would be a great fit for Amazon (and Jeff Who for all the SpaceX fans).
"
"""The operating system of Tesla is designed to work integrated with a very sophisticated specially designed electronic control centers of the vehicle manufactured by Tesla (see videos by Munro). Therefore, for a competitor, integrating Tesla's software will require integrating all of the vehicle's electronics as well, which they can only buy from Tesla at any price decided by Tesla, with no alternative (not a comfortable situation for a manufacturer).
"
"
"
"Tesla values its FSD software at tens of thousands of dollars. I don't see competitors willing to pay such amount of money to Tesla for a software licence, for each single car sold, even at a discount.
"
"
"
"Electric motors is the easy part, competitors can produce their own electric motors, or buy on the free market. Tesla motors are good and innovative, but will be pricey for competitors.
"
"
"
"Tesla battery cells can be sold to competitors as a commodity once they mass produce at a scale, but this won't happen for at least five years.
"
"
"
"Battery pack is the most expensive part of an EV, and in the Tesla vehicles, it is integrated with the cooling system of the vehicle and with the software. A competitor shall licence the entire package (battery pack + inverters + control software), and then they will produce only the chassis and interiors, and take profit of their brands. This is the most likly scenario for me, but only for small brands without capacity to develop their own system, and only once Tesla is not limited by the production capacity.""
"
"But willing to crush governments.

"I hate how some owners I meet while charging are still convinced that supercharging is a decent permanent solution because it's not at this time. You're causing slight irreparable damage to your battery each time you supercharge whether you want to believe it or not. Tesla themselves even agrees with my stance and doesn't recommend this. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.""

"""Infrastructure for EVs still has plenty of room to grow. But it's very, very, very far ahead of hydrogen. To the point where developing a hydrogen Infrastructure just doesn't make much sense because of so little benefit over BEV.

"And you're right about the portion of the population that don't have access to nightly charging. Though this is partially mitigated by the fact that a larger proportion of the people living in the  densely-populated areas don't own or drive vehicles.
"
"
"
"For most of the markets that Tesla has entered, the infrastructure is already sufficient. The benefit of EVs is that the extensiveness of the charging infrastructure needed is much lower because of the ability to charge at home and work. I ordered my first Tesla in 2012 and take my family on 5-7 road trips per year and have never had any problems. And it has greatly improved over the last 8 years at a very unexpected rate. I can imagine the long trips can be slightly less convenient for people that do speed runs without kids, but we have 3 kids, and the charging had never been the bottle neck. Helps that it's much much much cheaper than gas here in California.
"

As a car guy, I hated the minimalistic approach when I saw it for the first time. I thought the guys in tesla need to fire whoever came with that stupid decision of no gauge cluster. Fast forward to today and almost every cockpit of a people carrier (not something like the Huracan...) feels cluttered and cheap. I absolutely adore the minimalistic approach and it makes the 3 feels a lot more concise and futuristic, to me.

In a lot of ways I genuinely believe that my old X5M was about on par with the P3D in handling, even with the extra weight.

"I think maybe a lot of this comes down to choice of wording, so maybe I'm coming from a different place than a lot of people in here. I'll just say in MY vocabulary, """"handling"""" is referring to the precision and feel of the vehicle in corners and transitions, to changes in road pitch and camber... the way the vehicle engages with the ground and changes direction.  Miatas have terrific handling; they'd also get their ass thoroughly handed to them on a lot of open track lap time by a lot of cars that have terrible """"handling"""" for example.  The Lotus Elise turned almost exactly the same time around the Top Gear track as a Mercedes E55 AMG... I'd say the Elise is a better HANDLING vehicle by a long shot though.

"I don't think the P3D's handling is BAD - it's actually way better than I think anyone ever expected from an automaker with no motorsports heritage - but when it comes down to a fast canyon road or tight transitional section of track, it doesn't feel as good to me as cars that turn in """"similar"""" lap times, and it can demolish some very excellent handling cars by virtue of the fact that it has bottomless torque reserves and the ability to regulate delivery to all four wheels like no ICE / mechanical drivetrain can.   For that matter, even cruising at high-ish speed (say, 80-85mph) on the freeways around southern california there are spots where the pavement takes a quick drop or whoop where the P3D feels """"unsettled"""" where I've never noticed the same in any of our BMWs at the same speed.

It only had 109k miles on it, so I was planning on driving that thing until probably 2025. It was reasonably fuel efficient and paid off, so I never felt the need since maintenance was also pretty cheap compared to a car payment on anything new.

Flash cards are closer to eMMCs, they are a lower power optimized SSD with reduced feature set and usable space due to the form factor and pinout limitations.  If you look at the amount of data being rewritten over OS VMM swap files, you can see how important constant rewrite capabilities are for SSDs, compared to SD cards.  These are often random writes that require the re-read and rewrite of 8MB flash blocks even if only a small amount of data was written by the OS, whereas SD card usage is typically sequential, which has much less write multiplication.

"""This isn‚Äôt my first car.  I know that when purchasing a new car, regardless of the make or model, there is always someone buying the same car for less.   Typically those differences are the result of some negotiation and access to information about the sales of the vehicle in question.  I‚Äôm happy for anyone who will now get this great car for less with no negotiation required.  It‚Äôs also possible now to choose to get more car (wheels, colors, tow hitch, etc) for the same price I paid a month ago.  It‚Äôs great news if you want a Model Y. 
"
"
"
"I don‚Äôt think that means I can‚Äôt be disappointed.  This is a car that only started delivering in March and deliveries were interrupted for a month because of Corona.  It‚Äôs a car with an incredible amount of buzz and hype.  Tesla doesn‚Äôt provide much information about demand or sales.  I would say that they hint at very strong demand.  The quick and sudden price drop just seems unusual and arbitrary.  The car delivered to me had problems that shouldn‚Äôt get past quality control for any car and certainly not for $55k. In fact, I chose to accept delivery on their scheduled date despite one problem that they identified before delivery rather than get back in line for a later delivery with their promise to fix soon after delivery.  They‚Äôve mishandled that so far.

"Any car loses significant value the moment you leave the showroom.  Tesla just accelerated that loss for the people who have supported their launch of this critical product.

The 3 is a great car, and sooooo much better-looking than the bloated-jellybean design of the Y, but the Y is far more practical.

Once they have assigned you a safety rating, based on your driving behaviours the monthly rate might go up, might go down.   Elon said something similar during the Q2 results.""
"
"""I‚Äôve had Tesla insurance for 10 months now and they renewed it at the same initial rate after 6 months. Also, I doubt they are looking at driving habits just yet.""
"
"""We have multi-car, multi-policy (with our home) discounts with AAA. Tesla insurance came out cheaper by itself, but as a package AAA came out cheaper for us.""
"
"""In general, insurance has gone down overall and due to people driving much less. Call AAA and see what they will quote you for the year. If Telsa insurance goes up after 6 months, I'm sure you can shop around and find something cheaper.""
"
"""Do you use multi-car or multi-policy discounts with AAA? Tesla Insurance quote was cheaper than what I was getting from Liberty Mutual, but not having the Tesla on that policy would have eliminated a lot of discounts.""
"
"""You can shop as often as you want. The discount for being loyal is tiny.

"Here's a bit of my history, NJ, married, 3 cars, 1 accident not at fault.
"
"
"
"Geico used to be 890 per 6 months, wanted 1200 to switch a car to the tesla.
"
"Jumped to progressive for 825 per 6 months, after the first 6, they jacked the rate to 1300 because of some first time buyer, online buyer discount and something messed up on my homeowners discount as well.
"
"Requouted a bunch of places and went to Liberty mutual for $925 for 6 months, rate guarantee for 1 year with double the limits.
"
"
"
"It pays to shop around.""
"
"""Tesla was cheaper than adding it to AAA in my case. I got multi car/policy discount on AAA already. 
"
"
"
"Problem with AAA multipolicy is that they rate my 16 year old as the driver for the Tesla, and premium becomes insanity. Basically they put teenagers with no driving record on the most expensive cars, and the parents are just additional drivers.
"
"
"
"Tesla understands that I am the main driver of the Tesla.""
"
"""I've had it for my X for over a year, it just auto renewed for me""
"
"That‚Äôs interesting. Will shop around more.
"
"These rates makes me sad. Was paying 1700 every six month on my S now I‚Äôm doing 1200 on my 3. & I shopped around a lot. NYC rates are just astronomical.
"
"I've been with Progressive for years.  I still check other insurance companies and they are always higher.  I have never had any issue with Progressive when I had a claim.  Always paid with no issue.  I would check them out.
"
"""I can‚Äôt speak to working with Tesla Insurance, but as long as you‚Äôre not committing to anything more than the six months, either ditch Tesla Insurance after six months or negotiate with them based on what you can get elsewhere.
"
"
"
"It‚Äôs definitely sketchy that you can‚Äôt find out what the price is after six months.""
"
"I didn‚Äôt realize Tesla insurance is only available in California
"
"Progressive was 50 percent of what Geico quoted me. Shop around. Progressive was much cheaper through their website than same policy with them through an agent. I'm less than $50/month for two cars ... but I'm in Portland.
"
"Interesting
"
"Why wouldn‚Äôt they?
"
"That's bonkers. My rate through USAA is half that.
"
"""This is how all insurance works, at least in America.""
"
"Progressive is much cheaper in MD as well. I‚Äôve been with Geico for over 25 years and they could not do anything to match the Progressive quote. I‚Äôm getting better coverage for both my MY and M3 ($700/6months) covering me and my wife. Geico was around $1600/6months.
"
"My rates would have gone up if they were looking at the data ;)
"
"""Haha I guess you‚Äôre right. I was thinking of it in the context of some service with a promotional rate as OP was saying (like cable or something), but my car insurance renewal rate changes every six months.""
"
"Must be state by state differences. I‚Äôm in CA and Progressive quoted me almost 30% more than Tesla‚Äôs or Geico‚Äôs
"
"Return and buy a new one
"
"""Ive heard that the one-year penalty box is fairly easy to avoid. Create a new Tesla account with a different email, use a significant other to order, etc. FWIW, I‚Äôve also heard that the system isn‚Äôt that good at catching re-orders after canceling.""

"Had this same experience. I picked up my Y **on** Saturday and read about the pricing adjustment when I got home. I've been told nothing can be done.
"
"""Just curious if this would work.

"Return it.

"
"
"Ultimately, there‚Äôs enough hype around Tesla (or more importantly $TSLA) that is maybe making them a little more emboldened to do this stuff. I think they should be a little more careful. 
"

"If they feel the need to still rush out cars and pinch for as much money as possible (no retroactive discounts, FSD cost rises, etc.), maybe they aren‚Äôt that stable.""
"
"I‚Äôm 2 weeks out since delivery so just beyond the 7 day window. I tried seeing if there were any incentives with no luck. I guess I‚Äôve come to terms with it though. I‚Äôve really enjoyed my vehicle (even with its little QC issues). Hoping the poor service and unfortunate customer loyalty aspect of this company can become a minute part of my overall experience.
"
"Once you get it they‚Äôre done with you. I accepted my M3 LR two years ago with only 260 miles of range available. They said it‚Äôs nothing and it would work itself out in a few months. 22 months later and still 260 max while other LR friends of mine have 305-315 ranges. The Tesla shop still informs me all is well and there‚Äôs no problem. Other than my fiends can drive to Savannah from here are arrive with 18-20% charge and I roll into town sweating bullets at 4-5%. But once you get your car they say ‚Äúno take backs‚Äù!

"If you're that upset return the car and find a way around the 12 month repurchase hold or change the spec and put that money into a feature like the tow hitch.""
"
"I think tesla has shitty customer service. Their product is good and they rely on that. People who picked up within the last 30 days should get something. That‚Äôs just fair in my opinion.
"
"""Why would they? If you and your neighbor both bought F150s and he got a better deal are you marching down to the dealer to demand the same deal? They'll tell you to pound sand.

"""Dropping the price by 6% ($3k) on a $50k car so soon was a horrible move by Tesla. A slap on the face of those like us who got it just a couple of weeks ago.

"
"""Isn‚Äôt this exactly what would happen with any brand of vehicle? I‚Äôd love to see someone try and go negotiate money off a Ford, GM, Audi or any other vehicle because the price went down or a new deal appeared AFTER agreeing a price and taking delivery. Why should it be different with Tesla?""

"""To be fair we all agreed with the price when we ordered, but yeh, it doesn‚Äôt inspire a lot of loyalty when they take such a transactional approach.""

"""Do you have lemon laws in your state? IANAL (I am not a lawyer), but you might be able to force Tesla‚Äôs hand using a lemon law if this issue qualifies.""
