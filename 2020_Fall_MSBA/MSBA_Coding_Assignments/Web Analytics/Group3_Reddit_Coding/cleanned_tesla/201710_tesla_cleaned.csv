"""Both articles seem to point out that the aid in question is being distributed with political bias.
"
"
"
"So far I have only seen any mention of this on a very limited amount of notably right-leaning sites, all of which seem to take the same couple of quotes and run with it, and many of which actually use the exact same copy-paste style text, which is identical to the basic google translate of the quotes. My concern looking at this is that many of those quotes seem to simply insinuate that the """"suspicion"""" is coming from the general public, not the FBI or other agencies, and that they are simply investigating those reports as part of their day-to-day operations; *“So what we’re doing is looking into these allegations. That I can tell you is happening. Again, I cannot say that we have any ongoing investigation. We’re just corroborating these allegations.”*
"
"
"
"I don't doubt that there are some people that are misappropriating the aid. That happens on every single disaster, from Katrina to oil spills, etc - but I think it might be a bit overzealous to directly accuse specific individuals or specific mayors of this without anything to actually support that accusation as of yet.
"
"
"
"That said, I am certainly curious to hear the full story here - the Dailycaller references a WAPA radio interview, Do you have any links from major national news directly or primary source material? In this case, my concern is that Dailycaller is simply reporting on a report of a report - they didn't actually acquire any of this information, but are simply pointing out that another news agency found this information out - which in itself is not a problem, however at many points in the article, they seem to state things as facts despite them not being stated in the source articles. Either they did their own research and got that information, but failed to state from where, or they did not, and many such statements become questionable and invalid, and are simply added as a bias or to justify a position.
"
"
"
"I have no doubt that more information about this will come forward, and certainly view the articles you linked with interest as I had not seen them; which brings a pretty major point forward - I think many people see the T_D headlines that are written with such heavy bias and overzealousness that they don't appear to be reasonable, creating a skeptical disbelief in anything that might be related to those points. The """"meme"""" culture they use is directly contributing to the inability for the general public to take T_D seriously and actually consider/listen to points made. Combined with a general toxicity that many users from that community show, and it directly inhibits their ability to actually generate discussion over their points, compared to simply being ignored.

"Full Disclosure: I personally feel that Trump has done a poor job currently in his time in the white house and is leading the nation in a potentially very dangerous direction. I feel that as a whole the media does create massive political bias, which causes a very large divide in individual political leanings, to a point where the 2 """"sides"""" no longer even consider discussion, and individuals simply rely on their respective party position for every single facet of their discussions, to the point of many individuals being remiss to accept that the party they consider correct can have positions they don't agree with in specific things, but still be overall the better fit for their political leanings. People tend to simply assume that they should agree with their party 100% or not at all. In regards to the media, I do feel that as a whole, the """"right"""" media outlets tend to extend opinions as fact more often, and do so in a way that jeopardizes the validity of their articles, such as above. I think there are left leaning sites that do this as well, but that there are very few right-leaning sites that are directly fact-driven and avoid inserting opinion as fact. That said, I wish that people should research and form their own opinions on things being reported, but with less outlets having access to primary sources, this becomes difficult. The cries of """"fake news"""" tend to be nothing more than political bullshit most of the time, simply used to discredit something that those people do not agree with, rather than discredit it for having actual false information.""

The only surfaces that would affect the temp inside the cab are the pillars and connection points, maybe part of the door panels, all of which have plenty of aluminum/steel to conductively absorb any heat that makes it through the insulative base coat.
