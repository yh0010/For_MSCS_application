"
"
"
"Vinyl is much thinner. It is meant primarily as a form of cosmetic change. It offers minor protection, but that's not it's purpose. Comes in myriads of colors, including many that are not really achievable by paint like holographics. Lasts 2-5 years with care.""

"
"
"This is just a tradeoff for getting access to a market that is much larger than North America or Europe. Also, for Tesla the mission statement is to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. If they get copied the mission is still achieved.""

"""No, there is no way to completely protect IP. I've worked in high-tech industry for more than 10 years and there is no perfect way of IP protection unless you completely shutdown the human exchange from outside world. Keep in mind that people learn over time. They don't need to steal code, blueprints, design documents to """"steal"""" the IP. Given enough time and exposure to the tech, they'll get it. That's why tech companies in bay area don't bother to sue each other. Instead, they poach the talent from each other. I'm sure that's what the Chinese is going to do (and is doing). The only way to stay ahead of the competition is by running faster than the rest. That's exactly what Tesla is doing. Meanwhile, Chinese market is something Tesla can't live without. All things considered, it's a conscious decision to build cars there knowing that the IP could leak over time.""
"
"""In the past legal matters were not dealt with as they are here in the US. Recently you see a lot more patents issued which means they must have had some recourse. Ivanka has received several. Does not mean that the Government won't take them. That would be the bigger threat and something that was a problem in NAFTA. Even if the Mexican Government was okay with it the Cartels still ran things and they would kidnap executives a lot. The JVC Factory did not last.

"
"2. The market they are playing in is in it's infancy. The EV market is still tiny so competition doesn't necessarily stop Tesla from growing.
"
"
"
"3. Their goal is not to provide dividends to shareholders. Tesla wants to accelerate the transition to a renewable economy and more people making EV's only furthers this goal. That being said the share price is still important as this is Elon's only salary and how he plans to fund going to Mars but because of the above reasons people taking their IP is generally speaking not a major issue.""

"""Agreed this looks so efficient, amazing to think how much more efficient even the Model Y will be with the cast instead of stamped parts. Then Berlin with the next generation paint shop and likely new wiring harness, each gigafactory just keeps pushing the boundaries.""
"
"""Yes and no. Obviously Shanghai was designed using the lessons learned in Fremont, and with room for expansion (i.e. adding extra lines to increase production or future models). Fremont AFAIK was an existing factory and they needed a """"tent"""" to add a production line.

"But Fremont is making cars and profits and until it becomes a drag on profits, there's no reason to close it.  What there may be is an opportunity to close temporarily and upgrade the production line, or build elsewhere (I.e. not California) where real estate is cheaper... but then, you need to be where there are labour force too. (Notice in the video they need humans to close the trunks and frunks at the end of the assembly lines). :)

So not much to protect her. 3) software/controls this is what makes the robots/equipments move the way they do. This is pretty application specific, if you don't have the correct layout and correct equipment it is not super useful. Acceleration curves use in the robots are also extremely application sensitive so unless you are making an identical component you can't copy paste. TL;DR they have to try to protect their IP but even if the competition figures all three components out, it is not that useful or easy to copy.""

"What is also useful for them is seeing the assembly process and possible access to the control software for the robots. The robots are bought from elsewhere, so the software will be somewhat standard.  This factory got going so quickly because the same programming was debugged already in the first factory.

It can be poor design that just doesn't allow the panels to be that close, could be due to the space needed to fold in, the extension arm placing, etc etc. The other way is bad manufacturing.

"""That depends on a few factors. 
"

"Generally, high quality wrap vinyls such as 3M IJ2080 will last from 5-7 years with proper care and regular hand washing/touchless washing/waxing. Ideally the car would be parked indoors, away from the elements, bird droppings or tree sap. 
"
"
"
"Extreme weather conditions (heat, snow, salty sea air) may adversely effect the appearance of vinyl, such as color fading or inconsistency, but it does still protect the car very well as long as it remains in tact. This is because a wrap is essentially a big sticker which creates an airtight seal to your car's paint.

"That large panel gap on the old model. Holy crap!
"
"Which is weird because all the European Y's were going to be built in Giga-Berlin.
"
"They already had another tail light that was amber in the EU for the Model 3.  Are these not the same like the headlights between the 3/Y?
"
"""European Model Ys already had the amber flash, as do Model 3/S/X
"
"
"
"It may just be to simplify the supply chain - amber is allowed in the US, but red isn't allowed in the EU... so why have two different parts in your supply chain when you don't need to?""
"
"This is correct. One part for both markets.
"
"""I don't know a lot about their manufacturing process for these sorts of parts so I can be sure.
"
"
"
"How likely is it that the part is being standardised across all markets? Is it possible that the part is produced in a single location and then distributed to all other factories?
"
"
"
"If this is indeed the case, then it would make sense to have a single part instead of two variants, correct?""
"
"""Actually this is not at all EU compliant because EU requires the turn signal to be separate from the brake lights, but even though it is not shown, the brake light is in the same spot and Tesla is just using switchback LEDs to change them to amber when you turn on the turn signal. Unfortunately, this is still awful because you still lose brake light functionality on the side the turn signal is blinking on just like many cars with non-color changing combo taillights that share the functionality of a brake light and turn signal. This is NOT a safe design. The brake light and turn signal must be red and amber, respectively, and be two separate lights from each other""
"
"""Even worse, ive seen some american cars (usually old ones) where the turn signals arent just red, but they physically use the same exact light that the brakes use. Never understood why or how that is legal. Turn signals should be amber by law, it absolutely eliminates the chance for momentary confusion""
"
"Here (NZ) there are a few US imports kicking around (not Teslas) and their red flashing indicators are terrible. I don't know why we allow them on the road but I guess they get a special dispensation in the same way that they're allowed to have left hand drive. My Model 3 has the amber indicators since it is NZ new and though it is small it is bright and obvious.
"
"""But does the new directional on the Model Y in North America replace the brake light? E.g., It has a color-changing LED that can be either red or amber, depending on if the directional is activated.
"
"
"
"I think the Model X uses this system. It ultimately turns off the brake light and changes color to amber when the directional is turned on. Same method with a few FCA vehicles (Jeep Cherokee, Dodge RAM with LED tail lights).
"
"
"
"To me, this is only slightly better than having a red directional, as you only have two brake lights (the high-mounted stop lamp and whatever brake light is still on w/o the directional), or one brake light if you are braking with your hazards on.""

"""You can hardly call that a tail light/blinker. It's s√≥ small, it's hardly visible in normal traffic. Pretty dangerous.

"However, it's amber, which is a lot safer than having the same colour lights for braking, fog and turning.""

"Whenever any manufacturer can simplify a complex finished good aka a Tesla and can have one part serve in all markets they will for sure do it. So yes less variants less complexity better discounts by buying in more volume for that part

"
"That design choice pisses me off a lot.
"
"""I think I read somewhere that it started during the great depression or world war (*not sure*), some sort of crisis like that; and they started allowing cars to use the same lights for both brake and indicator lights because it saves resources/money. So it makes sense that it‚Äôs more commonly found on older cars, no idea why they haven‚Äôt changed it back after more money became available though.""
"
"""As an American, I am sorry. I really don't understand why red indicators are legal here, especially given how byzantine our lighting regulations otherwise are.""
"
"what happens when you're braking and signalling a turn simultaneously then? This sounds incredibly dangerous

"I think only some Toyota, Honda, and Lexus still keep amber.""
"
"It's not first evident when you see a red turn signal that it's not a tap of the brake light. The amber color makes this very clear immediately.
"
"Cars with red turn lights get into more accidents than ones with amber tail lights. The design is less safe to the point of being statistically noticeable. The US is practically the only country that doesn't require amber turn signals.
"
"[Here's a fantastic video]( breaking down all the reasons why amber is superior to red braking lights!
"
"Yep. I briefly entertained getting the Euro tails but the tiny amber marker light on those somehow seem less safe than the NA implementation.

"""Seemingly the opposite on my car (car delivered a week ago).  The hatch is mostly aligned, but the body mounted headlights stick out a lot on each side.  Car is in for service right now and they are quoting ~3 weeks to get it solved.

"""No, the hatch has nothing to do with it.  The inner and outer lenses are not parallel with each other, the gap grows towards the top.""

"""Because the U.S. government doesn't regulate it (unlike pretty much every other country around the world), and it's cheaper to build this way.

"Oh, and Canada often piggybacks off U.S. regulations, so I'm pretty sure Canadian Tesla cars are the same.""
"
"""Yes, but the amber turn signals on the Model X replace the brake light. E.g., when you turn on the left turn signal, the brake light's color changes to amber, and you only have the high-mounted brake light and the right brake light remaining.
"
"

"To me, this is only slightly better than having red turn signals because you're losing a whole brake light. Two brake lights gone if you have you have your hazards on.

"Can't win 'em all, I guess.""

"Model X has amber rear turn signals. I don‚Äôt think any of the others do in the US.

"Damn I knew I liked that color. Always wanted that matte black model 3 that they showed during the reveal but was worried it looked a little douchey
"
"""I saw that one too but I've seen many Teslas on the road and I know what's going on. That red light around the flashing turn signal seen on the rear is actually not the functional brake light. You just have the headlights turned on and that acts as the rear tail light that stays on for nighttime driving regardless of whether or not the brake is pressed. But that's different from the brake lights that turn on when you hit the brake pedal. That apparently uses the same space as the turn signal, using switchback LEDs. I know it sounds stupid to do that but that's apparently how Tesla does it. I appreciate Teslas but can't stand their lazy tail light setups in NA""

"If you're on a highway in stop and go traffic, and a car in the left lane in front of you has its signal go on, you may well only be able to see the right rear indicator. If its red, you don't know if its a brake light, or if he's signalling to pull in front of you.""

"""As I'm sure you already know, corporate-funded studies aren't quite as bad as you make them out to be. Yes some are definitely as bad as you describe, but some companies do great legit research - Microsoft has a handful of staff PhD's who publish on subjects that are relevant to Microsoft (which is basically everything these days), and their stuff is particularly good. Their study on consumer perception of privacy (via data obfuscation methods) is the one I most often cite, because it showed that - given the choice - consumers will choose bad obfuscation methods that are totally ineffective; even when the methods are fully explained to them. The researchers sat the participants down and showed them their personal tracking data, and explained the obfuscation methods in detail and how it would affect that data, and many still picked bad methods. Many also had contradictory data usage permission choices - for example many were fine with making the data available to public universities and research groups, but not to corporations. But there isn't a version of privacy or copyright that allows open public use while forbidding private use; if the data is open to the public for universities, it's also open for any company to grab. 
"
"
"
"Overall, I find that a lot of corporate-run research, if conducted by qualified experienced people, can be some of the most astute and practical research out there. It is particularly useful because it's often easier to read than the academic stuff, and the scope and target is usually better defined in the research paper. I rate readability as very important, because I love reading 3 clear papers in the time it would take me to read 1 poorly-written one, and it's too easy to misread a poorly written paper and get the wrong conclusion from it. This does depend greatly in the credibility and motives of the authors and funders, of course. Usually the motivation is to learn something for business purposes, so there is some bias towards accuracy rather than a particular result. For example if Ford, Tesla, and VW each released studies that analyzed the average trip length, and made a bell/whatever curve showing the portion of trips that are each length, I'd consider those to be pretty reliable, within the bounds and terms set for the studies (they may differ in that, Tesla may use 1-way trip distance whereas VW looks at the distence driven over the entire day). That's data that the companies want to know in order to size their batteries and fuel tanks, and it hurts sales if they get it wrong.

"
"I'd be interested in what Elon and his team consider """"normal""""? Every vehicle they design is very aerodynamic and it seems like part of the reason why the Cybertruck is shaped like it is compared to normal pickups is because of the aerodynamic benefits of the triangle like shape. Even with the modelY I was hoping for more of a straight rear window like the Volkswagon Tiguan or Landrover Discovery has to increase the height for cargo space but obviously Elon demands a super sloped rear windshield with everything Tesla designs due to aerodynamics. All that is fine but obviously you have to sacrifice aerodynamics with a traditional truck bed as they are. 
"
"
"
"Rivian went with a traditional pickup design and last I heard, they were saying 400 mile range but I'm not sure if that's for the $70K pricetag? At $70K, Cybertruck is saying 500+ so if true, we're talking a 100 mile range difference. I'm willing to bet a lot of that is due to better aerodynamics. Better software likely also plays a role. Still to keep the similar shape and still get 400 miles is impressive for Rivian.""

"Not if they made a cybertruck that was slightly more modular, it would sell incredibly well to all audiences. It would be useful to contractors because they could set it up however they want instead of being limited to what Tesla offers, it would sell great to companies and government services since it could be easily turned into a proper utility truck, tow truck, flatbed, etc., and it would probably sell better to the masses because the lack of a """"unibody"""" would make repairs much easier as the sides of the bed would no longer be a structural piece and could either just be welded or replaced like the front, doors, and basically every other part or the truck.

"
"

"
"
"
"Technically speaking full grain *is* a kind of top grain and *all leather is genuine*...it‚Äôs just that in the case of lower quality companies, they‚Äôll use the term with the highest perceived value they can get away with. There are exceptions: I can name some great products stamped ‚Äúgenuine leather‚Äù and some junk products labeled ‚Äúfull grain.‚Äù[Red Wing Heritage is a good example of a great company who uses the word """"genuinely."""" I own several pairs of their boots that have ‚Äúgenuine leather‚Äù stamped in the sole (neither the leather used in the uppers or the sole is low quality).](
"

"
"By it's legal definition (at least in the USA), """"Genuine"""" is not nor has it ever been a specific """"class/kind/type/grade"""" of low quality leather.

"
"The breakdown you tend see around the net ( Full Grain > Top Grain > Genuine/Split > Bonded ) isn‚Äôt an official grading scale (no government or leather trade group uses it), *just a general guide could use you when you can‚Äôt find more out about the leather or the brand.*

"
"
"
"[

"Additionally """"full grain"""" isn't a guarantee you're getting good leather, it just means they haven't sanded the hide, but there's so much more that goes into making good leather than just that one step.

"""A little advice.  If you remove the Aero covers you will need hub and nut covers. I bought aftermarket. Took 2 months and didn't save money. Also Tesla floor mats are made by Weathertech and good price.

"
"""Nice, now that you paid the down payment what are your monthly payments? /s... maybe :) I'm saving up to buy one (with a decent down payment) sometime next year although I don't know if I'll go the performance route. I know once I test drive one of those I'll never want a SR+ or LR (I've only tested a SR+ but loved it). Still, amazing performance and range out of all the model 3s for their price points...it's pretty wild and keeps getting better. Congratulations man and I love the color, I haven't seen any out in the wild here (smaller city though, \~130k peeps and no dealership).""

"""how tall are you? I am 6'8"""" and looking at Tesla for new daily commuter car at the moment. I am going to test drive a 3 and Y.""

"Who did you finance the car with? Currently looking to get a Model 3 or Y, but need suggestions on which financial institution to choose.""
"
"""Our cars are twins! I chrome-deleted and tinted it, and have achieved full 'drug dealer' mode. Lovin' it!""
"
"""Quick question, have you estimated if you really are getting the displayed range or is it lower than you expected like 200 miles or around there? I have a heavy foot that‚Äôs why""
"
"""Damn coulda put that money on Tesla calls like WSBs and got a Roadster instead. But seriously looks great with the new darker rims. Would look even cooler with a chrome delete (diy >$100 if you have the time and patience). That and nice fitting floor mats are all they need imo. Newer 3s have the wireless charger already so you saved there. Also probably a console wrap because it‚Äôs a fingerprint/scratch magnet. Oh and slap an ssd in there for dashcam and you‚Äôre good to go! 
"
"
"
"At a minimum ssd > console wrap > floor mats in that order. Everything else is personal preference..... maybe a screen protector too. though....that‚Äôs it I swear... unless you want to wrap your whole car and get some tints too....""

"
"""Oh it was 100% financed üòÅ Being 22, and living on my own, I wanted to make sure I had a full emergency fund in place, full down payment and taxes paid up front, and enough money for some fun modifications right after purchase.

"""When you're getting a Tesla let's go big or go home, right? üòÅ plan on keeping this beautiful vehicle forever, wanted to make sure that I would get the full experience!""
"
"""I took delivery last Monday and the only issue I found(that wouldn't have been fixed with a first wash) was a slight misalignment on the driver side rear door. Told service, fixed it within 10 minutes.""
"
"""Delivery was very smooth. Small paint chip on the passenger rear door, and some trim around the bottom of the car near the battery was not fully flush. Service was able to handle it within 5 minutes, and a general wipe down of the interior. Make sure you pay extra close attention to your paintwork. I had some scuffing and scratching of the clear coat near the front of the car that I wanted to make sure got handled by service center!""
"
"I‚Äôm excited for my delivery as well about same timeframe!

"I have rim savers coming later this week!! As of right now I park like a grandma. Extremely slowly and extremely far away from everyone else. ü§£

"""I unfortunately don't have power at my garage at my current living situation. This car is going to be majority public charging, and the occasional supercharger. I drive a lot with my job, so stopping at chargers for lunch will be no problem!! I'm looking to install solar on my garage as a solution though if it gets too annoying to have to constantly stop for juice.""
"
"""I'm 22! Wanted to still have an emergency fund after down payment. Enough to cover 3-6mo of expenses. Final payment to Tesla was $10,800~ this has left me with about 2 to 3 months of runway in my accounts to cover expenses and unforseen events. These next couple months are going to be super frugal to make up for the large expense. But, budgeting is everything!""
"
"Congratulations to you! It‚Äôs been fantastic so far.
"
"""I test drove a model why, I love the proportions from the exterior. due to the fact that they use a lot of parts from the model 3, the interior just felt a little off to me. It's hard to place it, but it feels like a car that's been stretched to an SUV. My dream car is still a model x. Going to be about 4 years until that one can happen!""
"
"""Trust me, I have my eyes on the road like a hawk. Looking out for even simple things like trash and cardboard. ü§£""

"""Great, I'm definitely looking for the Tesla floor mats, and roof rack! Hoping to pick them up soon.""
"
"""I may or may not still have a cyber truck reservation from the live stream release. üëÄ If I can swing it, I wouldn't mind keeping both!""
"
"""Definitely still keep a very close eye on the paint. Notice the chip on the door, and some scratches and scuffs in the clear coat at the front bumper. Also look out for the chrome trim, had some scratches near the driver window and on the rear passenger door as well. otherwise panel gaps are pretty decent, minor inconsistencies near the trunk but nothing that I'm worried about.""
"
"""Congratulations to you as well, fantastic cars!""
"
"""Absolutely, the monthly payments break down to $811 a month. Definitely not an inexpensive car, but not astronomical. I got a decent 3.5% interest rate for my age, and credit history. I'll still try and accelerate the payments to pay it down hopefully within 2-3 years. but personally I'm happy with the 3.5% interest! Best of luck to you in your Tesla endeavors, you are going to love it no matter which one you get!""
"
"""I'm actually not that tall, I'm only 5'11"""". Must have just been the angle. I'll tell you that the with all the seat adjustments, the model 3 should have enough room for you! when I test drove the Y the interior did not seem that much larger in terms of legroom. But that was from my experience during a short test drive.""
"
"""Don't worry, I ordered mine on July 19th. Just picked it up on Sunday. Tesla typically constructs vehicles for other regions such as Europe and Asia at the beginning of the quarter prior to US vehicles being built. It seems like they do performance deliveries first, then likely move on to long range. I'll tell you, the weeks seemed longer and longer everyday I waited for it!""
"
"Using Tesla finance I was able to get a loan through Wells Fargo auto for 3.5% APR. I also got approved with TD Auto at 4.09% but with $1200 less down. Hope this info helps.
"
"So awesome!! Send pictures! I'd love to see it! I'm waiting on Tesla service to make some repairs to my chrome trim then I can chrome delete it.
"
"""It definitely depends on your driving habits. If you have a heavy foot you're going to get far below the EPA rated 300 miles of range. I purposely drive like a grandma to get the maximum amount of miles, locking autopilot to a measly 68 mph on the freeway will get you maybe 10 to 20 extra miles out of the battery. Just a few 0 to 60 mph demos for some friends will drop your battery by almost 2 to 3 mi for that very short burst of power. Remember, electric vehicles use exponentially more energy the faster they go. Hope this helps!""
"
"""Oh you know it, I already have deliveries from RPM Tesla and tesbros. Chrome delete is happening today, installing it myself in my garage! USB for dash cam is coming tomorrow and front bumper PPF later this week. I'll have to look into some nice floor mats though. The stock floor mats aren't bad but I definitely want some WeatherTech for the front and trunk. I'll have to wait on the tint though, ceramic tinting isn't cheap!""

"You should check out Simple Bank üòÅ
"
"""Appreciate it, thank you brotha.""
"
"""Yeah, I can only imagine how stoked you are to jump in your car now, congratulations! Hopefully insurance isn't tooooo bad, that's the big unknown for me as I haven't looked into it but I've never had an accident in my 22+ years driving so hopefully they'd go easy (easier) on me (edit: easier than other male drivers with a history of tickets/accidents...last ticket was 10 years ago).""

"That‚Äôs pretty quick. And I guess me being in Florida has something to do with the delay.

But with my calculations, Model 3 performance without FSD comes out to $55k and taxes and fees comes out to $5800. So are you saying you only put 5k down?""
"
"""Dude that's an awesome price, I was worried of encountering rates north of $200/month for the LR. If I can get somewhere around $160 or lower per month when I do finally get close to pulling the trigger I'd be happy.""

"
"""Lmao yea, but compared to other states it‚Äôs not necessarily that bad is it?""
"
"""My numbers were a bit flip-flop, the taxes and fees and registration all depends on your city and state. Where I'm located at taxes around the lower end, I want to say low $5,000. my down payment was a little bit higher because of my age, and they were willing to give me a lower interest rate if I put down $1,200 more. But yes I put down more than 10% and paid the local tax rate of 7.75%""
"
"""My rate through progressive for the car was going to be about 260 or so!! Progressive was offering about $180 but both of these companies were offering way lower coverage. State minimums on everything, $5,000 deductible. Tesla insurance is amazing!""

"
"""Great, thank you for the advice. I'm in California, and it seems like they're beginning to get more lenient about it out here. Still would hate to get a fine over it. That's always the dilemma the go for the look or the legal?""
"
"Interesting. Okay I‚Äôm in LA county so that 5800 was accurate for me i didn‚Äôt know they differed by county/city. I plan to sell my car after i pay it off in December/January. Currently my car is worth around 22k if i sell to a dealer (more if 3rd party) i assume by end of year it‚Äôll be worth around 20. Which i intend to use to cover the taxes and the rest would go on downpayment.
"
"""I'll keep the Tesla insurance in mind when it gets to that point, thanks again!

"
"
"
"
"edit: and LOL on the 5k deductible - jerks""
"
"""Ha, thanks for answering my next question!""
"
"""Yea as of a few years ago they‚Äôve started checking tints during annual inspections so it sucks but luckily the tint shop referred me to a place. For me bright lights fuck me up after I got lasik so it‚Äôs helpful. I could possibly be exempt for the tints due to that. I actually don‚Äôt even drive at night because headlights and stop signs are like lasers in my eyes. But yea during the day cops don‚Äôt really bat an eye at the 35%. 
"
"
"
"Also some shops say they‚Äôll do the rear tint in 2 pieces. A lot of people on the sub say it‚Äôs the easy way and it looks bad but it was $100 less for me and you literally can‚Äôt see the lines where it overlaps unless you‚Äôre face is up against the glass. So yea if they recommend 2 piece rear and you have any worries I‚Äôd just ask them if they have any examples of previous work. I was lucky and there was a 3 being done when I came in for the quote.""
"
"That would be a nice hefty down payment to make your payments nice and low! The taxes for the car are based on the registration address. so if you have family that lives in a cheaper location and you don't mind registering your car at their address that may be something you can look into. Just understand I'm not a CPA or tax professional. üòÅ
"
"""Something that i can look into for sure. Thanks for the advice! But yea i feel like a hefty down is something that i kinda have to do. Even though my credit is okay, i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs considered an ‚Äúestablished‚Äù credit so more money would entice them to approve me somehow lmao""
"
"""Especially with covid, they have really locked down loans. I was surprised I got approved as well!""
"
"""Yea I‚Äôve heard of the same, With Tesla finance or your own loan arrangement?""
"
"""Wasn't able to get approved using my own loan arrangement, Tesla finance throws your application out to multiple places. And got approved through two separate lenders. TD Ameritrade Auto and Wells Fargo. I'm not the biggest fan of Wells Fargo, but they were offering a better rate!""
"
"yea i'm prob gonna do tesla financing and see if i can get a better offer from  CU and see if they would match.
"
"""Absolutely! Never hurts to get as many offers to weigh your options. It's a big purchase, I don't recommend rushing into anything! Make sure when you're ready to check for financing you do them all in close time proximity, sometimes this can result in less hard inquiries showing on your report.""

"
"""Yes, it is very easy to get understeer in corners coming in too hot. So much mass, so little tire. On the street my AWD wears out rear tires a lot faster but on the track that flips and it devastates the front tires.
"
"
"
"One thing I've found, keeping in mind this is with the D rather than the P in Track Mode as you're driving, but it probably still applies, is in certain types of corners you can get the car starting to rotate quicker earlier in the turn by hard accelerator lift followed fairly quickly with getting back on it very hard (pretty much mashing the pedal down). This puts you on your nose to dig in your \[turned\] front wheels and then the throwing back on the acceleration appears to start the car's mass rotating around center, slighltly ahead of what the wheels are tracking.
"
"
"
"Depending on track surface, and the state of your tires, you can even get a slight bit of 4-wheel drift on sweepers. I don't believe you can get the car's full acceleration potential during this, I'm pretty sure TC is modulating that, but then you probably don't want it there either. ;) As well in Track Mode caveat agitator applies, depending on how much you've dialed down TC/SC. ;)

"""I used to auto-x pretty seriously for a few years, DS 90 Civic Si, CS 94 Miata, DSP Fiat X-19, CSP 95 Miata, street mod turbo Miata (not serious with that  one). I haven't been out with my P3D, but it's a thought.
"
"
"
"Anyway, I think maybe driving/thinking/choosing lines a bit like a front driver might be good for the 3. In the Civic Si you had to take care in the turn entry to avoid a lot of understeer and then deliberately unwind the wheel at the exit to avoid hopeless inside wheelspin. So smooth driving paid off and slow in - fast out was the rule. Not as much fun as the Miata, but even in that it had so little power that getting wild was slower.
"
"
"
"I think with the weight and soft suspension on the Model 3 being really smooth to manage the body motion and avoid freaking out the stability control might be the way to avoid losing too much speed in turns until you can see a clear exit and pull the trigger.
"

"
"When I turbo'd the Miata it was great fun, coming out of turns crossed up and smoking the tires, wow! Never could match my CSP results even though the rest of the setup was almost the same.

"""Of course it can wear brakes more than driving on the street, however with track modes strong regen often I find my self not using the friction brakes too much, you can see in the video when I'm in regen vs friction brakes.  Negative Power is regen and the red brake bar is friction brakes.  AutoX is pretty low stress so even in 4 years of running my C6 Corvette and 4 years of my C7 Corvette I had never worn pads to the point they needed replaced.

"Oh I have no doubt drag is a factor.  Weight shouldn‚Äôt be much different.  But people are already so sold on these crossover suvs that are just fat hatchbacks (thanks BMW X6 / X4 / everyone else!) that all someone has to do is make a car a few inches taller and it‚Äôs an SUV now.

I bet the developers have that ability somewhat muted now until they're extremely confident in it making snap decisions.

"""Right now the max endurance they can get out of a small plane is 40 minutes. Realistically you need 2-3 hours to really be a replacement. With current technology the batteries are too heavy, even 50% lighter wouldn‚Äôt be good enough.

"
"Don't dox the guy.
"
"""As an aspiring pilot and occasional GA passenger, I'm genuinely curious about how it may go.  It's interesting because of all the 2nd and 3rd order effects of changing to electric.
"
"
"
"GA aircraft are so expensive as it is, and so much of that goes into powerplant design and maintenance, that there is room for disruption, not to mention the high marginal cost of an hour of flight.
"
"
"
"A new Lycoming 360 costs \~$85,000 and makes 180 HP.  The engine is about 270 lb and  a full load of fuel is about 700 lb.  A Model S motor is \~70 lb, and the 100KW battery \~1400 lb.  That is 50% more weight for 30-50% the energy.  The e-plane also has to carry the full battery through climb and flight, while the petrol plane gets lighter as it goes.  The e-plane can have  a high HP for climb and a super efficient cruise though, while the engine that gets the petrol plane to altitude is less efficient at cruise due to the inefficiencies of engines.
"
"
"
"The electric plane is o2 density agnostic, so higher altitudes are more achievable, which could help with efficiency, and the smaller motor may make for some more efficient designs.
"
"
"
"Much of the cost of GA is maintenance of the motor, which electric could reduce.  
"
"
"
"The quieter electric planes would reduce noise complaints.
"
"
"
"Charging is advancing so fast, and in the GA trips I've made, fuel stops take far longer than the time spent filling, so I don't think charge time has to be a huge drawback, but getting smaller airports to build the charging infrastructure may be the most impossible obstacle to overcome, especially since fuel sales may be (is?) the biggest profit for many (all?) FBOs.
"
"
"
"I think it'll hit the trainer market first.  The cost of entry to GA could be cut by a third if drilling holes through the sky wasn't so fuel dependent.  It'll move slow like all things aviation, but that only allows the technology to advance to the point of being irrefutable.  Time will tell, and it'll be interesting to watch.""
"
"And landing to recharge would be retarded when covering distance
"
"""The problem with electric aircraft is the battery. Batteries are very heavy, and they do heat up, and need to be cooled. If you remember when B787 first came out, they've had lithium ion batteries to run the cabin air conditioning to provide passengers with a never-seen-before AC experience. The aircraft was grounded due to multiple in-flight battery failures causing overheating batteries and battery fires. 
"
"
"
"As a pilot, the last thing I want and the worst possible thing I can have on board the aircraft is a fire. An in flight fire is the single most dangerous event that a pilot can face aside from structural failure that the airframe may suffer. (I've witnessned a plane crash which was caused by an in flight fire, pilot had no chance) on the other hand though, engine failures etc are not a concern to pilots as they are trained and know how to handle those.
"
"
"
"Back to my point, batteries in small aircraft will require cooling, a Tesla battery has its own way of cooling but you are talking about a car where we don't necessarily care about (we do but you know what I mean) how much the car weighs. In a small plane however, your useful load is important and every pound matters.  (Useful load is passengers, pilots, luggage, fuel) so your useful load in a normal Cessna somewhere between 700-900lbs and batteries will be too heavy for plane to have any useful carry capacity which is not practical. (Also a GA plane does not carry 700lbs of fuel, 350lbs is usually what they carry) 
"
"
"
"I do understand and acknowledge your statement about non-turbocharged, hence naturally aspirated engines and how they lose performance with loss of air pressure at higher altitudes, but we have to keep in mind that propellers and wings also lose performance with altitude. So an electric motor will not 100% mitigate performance loss with altitude, temp etc. 
"
"
"
"TDLR; battery powered aircraft would be too heavy, leaving very small useful load for owners to want to operate the aircraft. Why would I give up 2 seats so I can have an electric aircraft with smaller endurance (flight range) where I can have my 4-stroke avgas powered Cessna that I can carry 4 passengers and fly farther with. Not to mention I don't have to worry about my battery pack overheating and catching on fire mid flight.""
"
"It would have to be done with battery swaps
"
"""I agree...It's easily findable, and he knew that when he posted the pic.  A link to the DA-20 wikipedia page would have served the same point, and left his name and city from being posted.""
"
"""Time will tell.  I agree with a lot of what you said, and disagree with parts.  The biggest issue I have with your argument is your assumption that the status quo of battery characteristics is static, and you underestimate the weight of the engine in the base weight of the plane.
"
"
"
"So far as fires, the 787 debacle was 2011.  Cell phones were also famous for catching fire in people's pockets at the time.  The Galaxy Note 7 debacle was 2016.  Those problems seem to have been dealt with.  Batteries in recent  Tesla's seem to only be an issue in cases of severe damage, and throw 5 more years of development and I'm not sure that is the deciding factor.  If you've got major structural damage to your battery or your fuel tank, you are screwed either way.
"
"
"
"Drop the fuel cost of GA by 80%, and the maintenace cost by 75%, and all of a sudden it's a new dyamic.  Or it's a pipe dream.  We'll see.""
"
"Electric is great for cars but the current tech is a nightmare for airplanes. Like the fact that a gas airplane gets lighter during flight and this is actually accounted for when fueling commercial planes
"
"Indeed - most times large planes have a higher certificated takeoff weight than landing weight
"
"""It's really not, and a 747 can carry 22,000 pounds of fue and travel trans-continental.  That's not what we're discussing... For general aviation we're talking a thousand pounds (or less) differential between takeoff and landing.""
"
"Yup they gotta burn it off to land. And if they don‚Äôt they need a structural inspection
"
"And they need to get fuel a lot on a long flight and you can get fuel in like 20 minutes

"
"
"
"Why does this matter? Because I see FSD as a similar type of ‚Äúcommodity‚Äù. When you have the option to buy a car that can drive itself, potentially as a passive income rideshare service, it will be insanely valuable and in demand. This will only drive the price of full self-driving up, to who knows what cost.

"""Yeah. This is the flowchart. Battery tech is quite expensive today.  unless you have efficiency in battery tech you'll need to put more battery or just accept low range cars.

"
"
"
"Low range = cars will become cheaper but then you need to shine in other areas like comfort, software etc. People will be worried with low range cars. Plus your profit margin is lower so barrier to entry is high unless you're new like Rivian or Tesla who can  accept lower profit and reinvest those back or you're a large co like Ford or GM or Toyota or BMW who can recoup losses via ICEV sales. 
"
"
"
"Best option therefore is start at higher luxury range with a goal to crack back into mass market range. 
"
"
"
"If you want to stay only luxury like Lucid or Porsche then theres a problem because Tesla has already cornered it with S and X and fewer people are now available for next few years because the luxury people already have their cars for now and will come back only after several years. 
"
"
"
"If you want to be in $45k to $54k range then you potentially have a chance as more people exist here but your car must be kickass as Tesla is already dominating with the 3 and Y in this market. So you need efficient battery right away, great range, amazing build quality and comfort and branding and great software. Fail anywhere and you're doomed as Tesla is ahead on all (except build quality at present). The Nissan leaf and Chevy Bolt and Kia Nero and Hyundai Kona all exist just at the periphery of this with about $40k range to $45k range but are failing in a few aspects. They're selling but just not enough branding and traction.

"

"
"Additionally theres the Truck segment super huge in the US here and besides Tesla, no one really has any offering that people can consider non vaporware. Rivian is closest and theres likely others too in stealth mode but again they have to not fail in the EV rules (1. No goofy cars, 2. Good range of 350+ to 400+ mi for Truck 3. Charging network to remove range anxiety 4. Features and software ). Strangely Tesla failed rule 1 and bent it and emerged desirable, very likely result of no competition and high demand for Trucks and EV that people are good with it.

"It‚Äôs funny how in the past 8-10 years of me driving I can‚Äôt remember ever getting a flat. I buy my first brand new car and not even a week of having it I get a flat!!! I ran over a giant screw/nail in the second picture. Anyways... I had just gotten home, I was in no rush and in a safe location. I was weirdly somewhat excited to test out the Tesla mobile service and see what was about to happen next. 
"
"
"
"I schedule a roadside assistance request through the mobile app stating that I had a flat tire. Tesla already had my location through the app and knew where to send help. Cool. I get a call from Tesla asking if I was safe and they told me since unfortunately mobile service is not available in my area (I live only 30 mins away from a Tesla service center) they would instead send me a flatbed and take me to the nearest service center or any flat fix of my choice. It was almost 5pm and the service center closes at 6. They also told me the service center wasn‚Äôt available to take ‚Äútow ins‚Äù either so going to the nearest flat fix was my only option. 
"

The driver was kind enough to allow my wife and I to sit inside our car while on top of the flat bad and drove us to the flat fix.

"
"
"
"First red flag, I pull into the flat fix and the guy was ready to slide his jack under my car... not knowing it needed a jack pad. So I quickly stopped him and pulled out my handy jack pads I purchased from amazon. He takes the tire off and when he removes the rim from the tire he tells me because of the acoustic foam inside it‚Äôs a ‚Äúspecial tire‚Äù and he can‚Äôt fix it... ok so now what... the flat bed just left and now I‚Äôm stranded at this flat fix... 
"
"
"
"I call Tesla assistance again and explain to them my situation and they tell me unfortunately I am only covered for one tow per incident and that they can tow me to the nearest service center (which will be closed) but I can still tow it to their parking lot to be fixed in the morning for $288.... WHAT!? I was pretty pissed at this point and told her how upset I was with the options Tesla left me with. Having to pay dish out almost $300, leave my car overnight 45 minutes away from home and have to take a cab over in the morning to pick my car up is absolutely ridiculous... all for a simple flat. She apologized and said if I had triple A I can try them. 
"
"
"
"Thankfully I do have a AAA membership since Tesla‚Äôs solution pretty much made the entire situation worse and they were able to tow me to a flat fix. This time I called the flat fix ahead of time to make sure they knew how to jack up a Tesla and could fix the tire. They said yes bring it in, I told the AAA tow truck driver the address (who was awesome btw) and off we went enabling the full self driving flatbed mode.

"
"They patched the tire in under 5 minutes for me and our baby was back in business all thanks to AAA.

Even after I begged the lady that I was stranded in a random flat fix and I purchased the car only a week ago and this was my first time using the Tesla roadside assistance etc. In reality fixing a flat on a Tesla should be just like any other car. The fact that he wasn‚Äôt going to use a jack pad and didn‚Äôt know how to fix it tells me he didn‚Äôt know what he was doing anyway and so I kind of just wanted to get out of there. If there‚Äôs anything to learn from my experience, make sure you call the flat fix ahead of time and make sure they know how to fix a Tesla specifically.""
