After that he learned to cut logs with a chain  saw in Vancouver, British Columbia. The hardest job Musk took came after  a visit to the unemployment office. He inquired about the job with the  best wage, which turned out to be a gig cleaning the boiler room of a  lumber mill for eighteen dollars an hour. """"You have to put on this  hazmat suit and then shimmy through this little tunnel that you can  barely fit in,"""" Musk said. """"then you have a shovel and you take the sand  and good and other residue, which is still steaming hot, and you have  to shovel it through the same hole you came through. There is no escape.

"""We got one for my girlfriend a few weeks ago, and all I want to do is trade my car in and get one. I legitimately feel guilty driving my car now.""

"""Thank you Elon. You give this world hope. We're just normal folks. But most billionaires are just trying to make more money off of us normal folks at any cost. They will sell our kid's futures to make a buck. I've been asked to prove Elon is not like the rest of them. Not just in it for the money. Well, this is the proof. Elon risked everything back then. And he continues to lead. Sticking to the mission. Caring about the future of humanity. One of the few leaders actually trying.  This is why my wife and I gave up gas and bought 2 Teslas in the middle of Oklahoma. This is why we attend EV events on weekends, trying to spread the word.

Tesla egged the auto manufacturers into designing the very cars that'll edge tesla out of the market or into a buyout.

"In some respects I think many people did exactly this when purchasing a Model 3.

"""The Elon-jerking here is a bit misguided : he has actually borrowed against his TSLA stock to pay for several houses and his living expenses. This means that if TSLA drops below some some level, his broker will start selling his shares (""""margin call"""") and TSLA will drop like crazy.

Stop treating him like he's some kind of messiah, Elon is just another spoiled rich kid who could only do the things he did because he was born into wealth that he did nothing to earn. FFS, he claims to have mastered programming by the age of 10 at a time when a PC would have cost AT LEAST $4,000 in today's money. I'm sure plenty of poor kids around the world could have mastered it and sold their own game too if they're parents had $4K laying around for them to burn. Downvote me plebs.""

"
"The funds came in Xmas eve. I'm pretty sure he said he bought presents from the service station that year
"
"Yeah I remember he was down to his last dollars when he finally gets his companies to start rolling out profits. I read the biography and it was absolutely amazing. It is insanely how many times he almost lost it all but was able to stay determined and overcome it.

"
">Musk spent the next year working a series of odd jobs around Canada. He tended vegetables and shoveled out grain bins at a cousin's farm located in the tiny town of Waldeck. Musk celebrated his eighteenth birthday there, sharing a cake with the family he'd just met and a few strangers from the neighborhood.

The situation got so bad that Tesla had to shut down its factory.

Credibility is undermined most when people dismiss  the work it takes to  succeed as something that is just effortless and simple.

You undermine Musk's credibility by denying him his greatest asset:  The ability to succeed under the most dire situations.  He put literally everything into success, and if that meant selling the company to see it succeed without him he was willing to do it.  That's why he succeeds over and over again, he doesn't give any option to fail and will put success over his own personal well being if necessary.""

"
"
"
"As a commuter, it is second to none. My dad averaged 84 mpg driving from California to Kansas City, and I typically get 72-75 mpg highway. I get like 62 mpg city if I go with the flow of traffic. 54 mpg if I hoon it. 
"
"
"
"As a family car or to run errands, it is **horrible**. You would need two of them to transport 3 people, and that would be 31 mpg city, 42 mpg highway. There are plenty of other **much** faster cars, cars with acceleration that would blow it out of the water, and still return better mpg. Like the Prius.""
"
"""It‚Äôs a shame since the old 2000-2006 Insight gets better MPG then the new one, makes me wonder when we‚Äôll commonly get PHEVs or hybrids that commonly get what it does. I think it‚Äôs partially because nobody wants to own a car with 80hp and 106ft/lb in 2019.""

"As far as the polar moment of inertia, it's very much applicable to real-world situation, so I'll explain it. Take all weight on the car and compare it to distance from the center axis of the car (imagine z-axis in the middle of the car). The lowest polar moment means it has most of its weight about the center axis, with little on the edges. Imagine a figure skater doing a spin. When they put their arms out (high polar moment), they slow down. When they pull their arms in (low polar moment), they can spin very fast. Same with the car. ICE can't compete. EV will spin about its axis (i.e. corner) better than a car with a higher polar moment. So by physics, it naturally has better cornering ability, *all else being equal*. Hopefully Taycan prioritizes this too, but for now only Tesla has.
"
"
"
"&#x200B;
"
"
"
"I said, all else being equal, because other factors may work together to overcome that polar moment disparity. EV obviously wins in acceleration. Brakes it depends. Higher trims/options of 911 probably have ceramic brakes that would be better. The other variables are weight (higher means higher inertia), so 911 has 3 beaten there; and grip (stock Tesla tires prioritize long range over grip). Performance Model 3 Pilot Sport 4S are better, but still not as good as Pilot Sport Cup 2 on GT3 for example.""

It's almost put me into a wall twice, and has brake checked quite a few people because it gets scared of certain things. In the latest update it seems to want to unexpectedly slow down for any onramps or offramps that have lines delineating them, regardless if there is a merging car or not. I'd love for Tesla to provide the raw data. There's also a bit of inherit bias to that data as autopilot is more likely to be used on the highway than side roads, and there are a lot of accidents at side roads and stop lights. Tesla doesn't filter out that data when making their comparison which will skew the data in their favor.""

"
"
"And the last thing I'll point out is that physical controls doesn't even preclude evolution. Cars have been using rotary encodes instead of potentiometers for ages, and those are programmable by software (and indeed that's how they work). If Tesla came up with some awesome new idea for what they should do, it's easy as pie to make the software change their function. Cars like the Jag even have little screens on their controls that can programmatically change, so you can even change what's presented to the driver on them.

"""Honestly, I was feeling the same thing too when he rolled his eyes. Legacy automakers have become so complacent.""
"
"""That's completely true. The only competitor to the 2012 Model S is the e-tron SUV, since they're building a fast-charging network (slowly) and the design and style isn't bad. However nothing can really be onto a level of the 2019 Model S, or the 2020 Roadster (no other manufacture will hit 300 miles, let alone 621, while having a beautiful design, and have a top speed of 250+)""

"""He looks worn down, I understand why.""
"
"don't worry Elon I'm coming

"Damn this thread is being Astro turfed so hard by outsiders.
"
"I guess you could say they are on FIRE!
"
"He‚Äôs an alien.
"
"NIO ES8?? Rly Elon??
"
"""It‚Äôs pretty much due to lack of effort. No other company showed any ambition to make a fantastic electric motor. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no infrastructure etc etc‚Äù not thinking, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs innovate and make our own infrastructure for this and set the standard.‚Äù
"
"
"
"
"
"It‚Äôs why we had to bail out these companies in America and why we‚Äôll probably end up bailing them out again.""
"
"Elon Musk really is one smart person. I bet people will still talk about him in a few hundred years.
"
"That eye roll is meme worthy
"
"""In 2012 the Ford fusion had a nicer quality interior than a $90,000 Tesla. it's 7 years later and Tesla still can't make an actual luxury car interior. Poor fit and finish for a luxury car price. not to mention 7 years later and they still have the worst reliability ratings of any manufacturer even Fiat is more reliable. (See Consumer Reports)
"
"
"
"One of my clients is switching over to the Porsche Taycan because his car is in the shop more often than not and he's tired of driving Toyota Camry rental cars from Tesla.""
"
"""These presentations are always so awkward. I feel like Elon or other presenters expect an Apple product unveiling response to Tesla news or updates. 
"
"
"
"At times, it‚Äôs cringeworthy to watch. Love my car though... lol""
"
"""The internal combustion engine is complex and needs a industry to keep them running as they break down. Correct me if I am wrong but the electric motor on the Tesla is good for like 1,000,000 miles. This means if the whole auto industry shifts to electric and autonomous than professional drivers, professional mechanics, and dealerships will disappear. There probably all lobbying against ev and Auto pilot.

"""Might be a stupid question, but does Elon Musk make a profit? Or is his net worth going down? I thought his solar panels and Teslas haven't made a profit yet or something""
"
"It‚Äôs a good thing he has no competition. At least he can keep his focus on making those Cat girls and Dino girls.
"
"Why have almost all car manufacturers created some horrendously ugly electric/hybrid vehicles? Some say it‚Äôs a conspiracy to keep people consuming gas/oil. Tesla is fighting against the grain if this is true

"
"And Tesla is still losing money in this quarter...
"
"Volvo‚Äôs Polestar 2?
"
"""They arent even trying yet, the big automakers dont NEED to directly compete and are letting the transition to all electric happen more naturally, once they all work through all their own challenges and the price of the tech comes down and the infrastructure is more mature Toyota is going to eat Teslas lunch.
"
"
"
"That said even if future competition hurts Tesla or strangles its profits Tesla can always take credit for being the main driving force behind speeding up, this inevitable transition in automotive technology, so thank you Tesla.""
"
"Does he mean any car or any electric car?

"""I mean, for six of those seven years nobody even tried to build a car to compete with the Model S, so d'uh?""

"Weird flex but okay

"""Sorry, I need some explanation here, i seem to misunderstand something. If the whole purpose of Tesla was to accelerate the advent of electric vehicles, then why is Elon so proud of the fact, that other car manufacturers seem to have serious problems catching up. He even made Tesla patents public and still, they cant catch up? I understand, without Tesla always being better than others, there wouldnt be competition and the motivation for other manufacturers to catch up would be lacking. But 7 Years seems like the others are still pretty far behind and dont have any intend to produce electric vehicles, and he should rather hope for them that they produce good electric vehicles soon, otherwise the purpose of tesla is kind of not achieved?""

While we were standing there laughing, some broad rolls up in a Prius and rolls her window down a smidge, asking where the recharging stations are. We pointed to them right in front of us. She gave a lip-curl and a nose snort, and pulled back out onto the highway, ha, ha.
"

"In our town, the good Green fathers installed two FREE recharging stations at the park, and raised our property taxes to pay for it. Every day when I go to the park, I stop to see who is using them. No Teslas. Teslas don't go to parks. They go to Whole Foods, and COSTCO, and Starbucks, and their gated homes. They are convinced a 12x12 GMaps screen and rocket acceleration lane changes, are worth $85,000. And another $20,000 for the separate home charging station tie to the grid. And they haven't hit the 45,000-mile factory battery change wall yet, another $20,000.

"
"""The short answer is no, not really.
"
"
"
"The long answer is that Tesla has offered some of their patents under somewhat of an open licensing agreement (and I'm not even sure if it includes the SC patents; even if it did, that doesn't necessarily mean integration with the SC network would be possible and that's another similar discussion), but that the agreement is so ridiculous for an established company to accept that my personal theory is that Elon or Tesla wanted the good press of a bunch of """"Tesla is opening their patents"""" headlines (which judging from the people commenting about it, worked) without *actually* having to open their patents, so they *technically* opened them but included so many poison pills that an established company would have to be fairly insane to actually take them up on it.
"
"
"
"Analysis of the agreement at ast, such as:
"
"
"
"> First, the Pledge states that those acting in good faith will not assert any patent or intellectual property right against Tesla. Note that a company using Tesla‚Äôs patented technology is not only giving up the ability to bring an action against Tesla for patent infringement, but any form of intellectual property infringement. This includes trademark and copyright infringement, as well as trade secret misappropriation. Thus, for example, if Tesla copied a company‚Äôs source code line-for-line, that company would be required to forfeit the protection provided by the Pledge in order to enforce its rights.
"
"
"
"> Of potentially even greater consequence, the Pledge states that a company is not acting in good faith if it has asserted ‚Äúany patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment.‚Äù Therefore, before using technology from a Tesla patent, a company must determine whether it is willing to agree not to assert its own patents against any company operating in the electric vehicle market anywhere in the world.
"
"
"
"> The second restriction limits a company‚Äôs ability to challenge the validity of a Tesla patent. This is similar to language found in many intellectual property license agreements. However, there are a few things to note. First, this restriction applies to any Tesla patent, not only the one that the company is using. Second, the Pledge requires that the company not have any financial stake in a challenge to a Tesla patent. The term ‚Äúfinancial stake‚Äù could be quite far reaching. For example, Tesla could argue that a supplier has a financial stake in its customer‚Äôs challenge of a Tesla patent.

Second, the Pledge requires that the company not have any financial stake in a challenge to a Tesla patent. The term ‚Äúfinancial stake‚Äù could be quite far reaching.

"""If you like it that's what matters and I know where you're coming from being a car lover all my life- (I kind of half understand why you picked it) but if you are driving that much and money isn't really as much the issue, trust me on this one from someone who bought a second Model 3 three months after the first, (and I sat in the driver's seat and the rear seat of that Kia)- this is unlike any driving experience I ever had, on street, on highways and long trips. I can see you eventually giving the 3 a longer test drive. The idea that you can go into autopilot if you choose to (or not) and take full advantage of the breaks (that really truly only come at 250-275 mile intervals (and fast charging happens when you are below 100 miles)- who doesn't stop or want to stretch and take a rest for a half hour or more anyway- in highway miles that 4-5 hours of driving and it's much healthier!) These things become second nature- and I will admit now that we've spent a lot more time on road trips, we're seeing a lot more places than we would by taking the off ramps and country roads and checking in at different locations. It's making our journeys more like adventures. Now that we travel back and forth repetitively to a far distance also, we get to use a few different superchargers and know which ones work best for our route to get us in and out fast and with a cup of coffee and a stop at a rest station. You just work it into your lifestyle and it becomes seamless. Yes, some people never overcome range anxiety but it happens to everyone. It's kind of funny. I once had it with an ICE rental car in the middle of nowhere. I went 17 miles out of my way and found a gas station, then went 17 miles back.

Also worth pointing out that in practice and for a substantial time into the future, among released CCS cars only the e-tron has a reasonable charging speed, so the slow charge speeds of the Bolt, Kona, etc. un-mitigate that advantage.)

"
"I'm being a little unfair here because I'm not sure those are installed by Tesla specifically as opposed to just be listed, but on the flip side many of the destination chargers listed make 50 kW look positively amazing. (The vineyard one for example is 13 kW.)
"
"
"
"*That* is what the 50 kW EA chargers are for. They're not for people on trips, they're for people driving around town. I don't understand why that is so hard to understand.
"

"they're doing the same thing Tesla is.
"
"
"
"Number 2:
"
"
"
"You're focusing on the rare exception with your weird obsession on 50 kW. The vast vast majority of the chargers EA has installed are 150+ kW. You said you doubt they have more than a handful of high-power chargers installed; it's actually the *reverse*, only a handful are *50* kW.
"
"
"
"If I haven't gotten that fact into your dense skull with the citations yet I have little hope this will help, but [this press release]( Those sites have 1,388 chargers. 300 MW divided by 1,388 means an average of """"almost"""" 216 kW/charger. Pray tell how they are achieving that average with anything but a token number of 50 kW chargers?
"
"
"
"*Edit*: Actually it's possible to do some math. Suppose we round down the average per charger to 200 kW, and an assumption that there are an equal number of 350 kW chargers and 150 kW chargers. It's actually possible to compute how many there would be given that -- 520 each of 150 and 350 kW chargers, and 347 50 kW chargers, just a quarter of the total. Except that's actually too generous -- there are more 150 kW chargers than 350 kW chargers, and """"replacing"""" 350 with 150 means four fewer 50 kW chargers. So for example, if it were half and half than a site with six chargers would have three each of 150 and 350, but in reality I *think* those sites would usually have four 150 kW chargers and two 350 kW chargers. So that's replacing one. Let's say there are 25 or so such sites; that's probably low. That would mean that only *247* (less than 18%) of the chargers in that set could be 50 kW.

"Why is the comment a that far reaching?  Depending on the source of electricity used to charge it an EV can have a far smaller carbon/energy footprint then a gas powered car.   By far the biggest part of a gas cars lifetime footprint is made up not by building it but burning gas in operation.    So if you charge an EV from a clean gird or solar then your gas can make a significant dent.   Where I live the grid is very clean.   When you do the numbers you can build and run 6 EVs to end of life for the same footprint as one comparable gas powered car.   So while that might not be saving the world (and you would do better if you didn't have a car altogether) it can make a significant difference in your carbon footprint.

"""I remember that nervous feeling. We reserved the Model 3 the night of the unveiling and were planning on retiring in California half time but bought the house 2.5 years prior to retiring and rented it out and only used it a few weeks of the year those two years. It didn't seem prudent to own a car out there for so little time so we rented every time even at a few hundred a week and I kept dreaming about having the Model 3 every time we took a road trip in a crappy Hyundai. And besides, the wait was perfect, we kept saving up for the car the whole time.
"

"2.5 yrs later June 30 last year when AWD was available and free internet for life I had no more excuses to wait -late August, the exact month before I was to retire we got the call our car was ready. A few delivery hiccups notwithstanding. Hey, it's Tesla.

"
"""Ok, I used to detail cars. The basics are wash, clay bar, wax. There are tons of great videos on YouTube about that.  
"
"
"
" For the most part, black is tough. So, every year or so, you're going to want to get a professional detail. From a reputable place that wont leave swirls (very noticable in black paint).  
"
"
"
"You seem to have the right idea with micro fiber and being careful, though.  
"
"
"
" Always have a special sponge/cloth and bucket for wheels. Use the same soap for wheels that you will use on your car. A lot of people recommend acid or abrasive chemicals for brake dust, but that really isn't neccessary with regular cleaning. Id say every month or so, or every 1,000 miles should be enough (unless you drive on salty roads in the winter, in which case wash every other week).  
"
"
"
"Not much to it! As long ad you're careful, you will be fine. Soak the car. Soap the car. Rinse the car. Dry the car. A few times a year, go over it with a clay bar (right after washing) and then wash it again quick. But it's really easy! I learned all this when I was 20 and really loved my car. Kept it looking sweet for the 40,000 miles I owned it. 
"
"
"
" Wax is very important! 
"
"
"
" I use mothers carnauba wax, although any carnauba works great. You put it on two panels at a time. So apply to your driver side fender, then door. Rub off the fender. Apply to rear door. Rub off front door, then apply to rear quarter, etc. all the way around. You only **have** to do this a few times a year. Spray wax is great to rub on after every wash, but doesnt last as long. Think of wax as a really thin protectant that wheres away every time you wash it.  
"
"
"
"Any more questions feel free to ask!""
"
"I personally would look into xpel paint protection wrap for any new car I get.
"
"""Eat a few times burger King, McDonald's and pizza hut in the car. I promise, the smell will we gone! ü§£""
"
"Hmmmm... 9 months is quite a while. In my experience most cars started to fade within a few weeks. Have you had the windshield/glass roof replaced or any other repairs? New windshields also give off a smell as the adhesive cures.
"
"""Does soak the car mean actually leave it wet for a bit or just spray it down first? 
"
"
"
"Also, what‚Äôs the lazy man‚Äôs version of this? I live in a mild climate where it is rainy and drizzly pretty often. 
"
"
"
"What I usually do with cars is just take them through automated car washes about once a month in winter cause no matter what, you just end up getting rained on. Then in summer I wash the car by hand and get it back into as good of shape as I can inside and out and then do automated or hand washes every couple weeks while the weather is nice. I have never clayed or waxed. If you don‚Äôt do it the first year is it essentially too late? Is there one step up from my current way of doing things or is it really like stick with what I‚Äôm doing (which doesn‚Äôt look that great) or go all the way to the regular clay and waxing and hand wash only?""
"
"What color if not black?  White?
"
"So will your intestines!
"
"No repairs. The smell is slooowly going away but it‚Äôs still quite strong.
"
"""Taking it through the automated carwash is seriously underrated. The only thing you could do better is a nice quick spray wax (with a micro fiber cloth) right after. Like, before you leave the parking lot. The only thing those tend to miss is the wheels. A good hand wash every few months would be great. That way you could clay bar it and also use your special wheel brush (I know you'll get one) and get into the nitty gritty.  
"
"
"
"  By """"soaking"""" yes, I mean wet the car. Like, really wet it, if you're doing it by hand. Try to find a shady spot, or those DIY car washes that have the hanging hose.
"
"
"
"It's never to late to clay bar! In my detailing years, we did tons of cars with near 100,000 miles that probably NEVER had a clay bar. After that, a buff and wax, they looked awesome sitting on the dealers lot. Talk about pride in your work!  
"
"
"
"If you look up some videos on clay baring, and it seems like a lot of work, most decent places will do that, buff, wax, interior, windows, etc. for about $200. Depending where you live. That could easily be worth the money, unless you're a more hands on person, like myself.""
"
"Automated car washes are great and convenient but they will leave micro scratches in the paint because people go through those things with mud and all sorta stuff and that gets trapped in their scrubbers and rubs your paint the wrong way.
"
"Same! Swirls just arent quite as visible in lighter color paints. You have to look at them just right.
"
"I would recommend wiping down the interior plastics (except the dash) with optimum power clean to try and remove any film from off gassing products that have accumulated. The dash is easy to scratch when cleaning so I would recommend cleaning that with a fresh microfiber and Optimum No Rinse (ONR) with light pressure. The headliner can also be wiped down with a microfiber moistened with a little bit of power clean. That should help the smell.
"
"Thank you for the tips! I am a do-it-yourself type dude in many aspects of life but I really have to be in the mood for the car exterior stuff and unfortunately when it‚Äôs winter especially that mood doesn‚Äôt strike nearly as often as I need it to. I don‚Äôt really have anyone to impress anyways I just sometimes feel embarrassed to have something nice and have people look at me like I am too spoiled to take care of it. I will probably stick to the automated stuff mostly then and get a detail or do my own detail once a year when the nice weather is about to start! You have inspired me to try the clay and wax approach at some point soon!
"
"""Only use touchless car washes for this exact reason. They won't get everything, but it's a lot better than scratching your paint with dirty rollers""
"
"Yeah that makes sense. I think I am willing to live with it since the alternative for me is likely not doing enough exterior cleaning at all.
"
"It's a handful to keep up with for sure. Therapeutic though

"Just knowing how an engine works the fluids within the system are what cause fires. Regardless of how these fluids are released from the system it always ends with a fluid and an ignition source. The largest ignition source on a car is the exhaust, it follows the entire length of the vehicle. Engines do not light on fire by design.

"Table 4 shows categories of the factors contributing to the ignition of highway vehicle fires. Mechanical failure or malfunction was the leading contributing factor of highway vehicle fires (45 percent). These mechanical failures include a leak or break in a component of the vehicle, automatic or manual control failures, or the use of an improper type of fuel. An electrical failure or malfunction, such as a short circuit, was a contributing factor in 21 percent of highway vehicle fires. The misuse of a material or product, such as spilling flammable liquid or gas too close to the vehicle, was the third leading factor contributing to the ignition of the fires (13 percent). These three leading contributing factors played a role in 79 percent of highway vehicle fires.""

"
"* 618,128 vehicles according to Tesla Garage leak, 2019 Near end of Q1: /
"
"* 10,286,222,684 miles : see above

"* 16,641 miles per vehicle average 
"
"* 1 year 8 months average age per car (1,019,368 vehicle years / 618,128 vehicles) : See below for VY source
"
"* 10,085 average miles per year
"
"
"
"...  So the average Tesla on the road is 1 year and 8 months old and has only driven 16,641 miles.  This is the problem with going by the """"billions of miles driven"""" statistic.  Most of those billions were driven by hundreds of thousands of cars driving less than 20,000 miles.  
"
"
"
"CNN's stat was that there were 40 fires when Tesla only had 300,000 cars on the road.  It's double that now.  There have been two major Tesla fires in just the past week.  If that continues to be a trend that's 100 a year.
"
"
"
"Another factor to consider, low price gas cars like Kias & Hyundais with the garbage ‚ÄúTheta II‚Äù engines wreck the gas fire statistic because they are causing more fires than most other manufacturers combined.  Tesla's were up until 3 years ago a very high dollar car that is traditionally less likely to catch fire even in gas models (you pay for more safety).

"Then you are bad with statistics. There are more older cars on the road than younger cars.

"See the problem is you do not understand what an ignition source is. If a spark ignites something then the alternator is not the ignition source. The alternator can create a spark but the spark is the ignition source. To say the alternator is the ignition source full stop can only reasonably imply the surface of it, just like saying the exhaust is the ignition source means the heat from it not sparks created if it drags on the ground. Then the ignition source would be the sparks created. Words do matter.

"Anyway, the graph is pretty simple, and the very research in that article says that as safety standards became more strict car fires have lower incidence. (words are important, remember?) As time goes on, yes, the cars age, but you also start weeding out the old old cars, and they are replaced by newer tech older cars. This is why as time progresses fire incidence gets lower, and cars get safer. You can see the same curve with injuries in cars. Cars get safer over time, that leads to a decline in fatal injuries.

"That is 100% untrue. The beauty in normalizing data based on the number of cars on the road per model year is that you do not need to define what is """"old""""; the data speaks for itself.

I'd like to get the BMW X1 if money weren't an issue. SUV's are cool, stylish, and practical too. The hatch in the rear allows you to put stuff in the back. But even more importantly, for my sake, you can convert the back into a bed and sleep in it which is great for cheap travel.""
"
"is the best
"
"Wait until you see all the shortcut inputs :O
"
"""It all depends how you do it. The most common way to lower a car is through coil overs I think. Most people set them up to be slightly stiffer but it really improves handling. You can set them up to ride like stock but you risk bottoming out unless you go to a progressive spring rate which gets stiffer as it compresses. Usually slightly more expensive but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it. 
"
"
"
"There are a ton of ways to lift vehicles and it all depends on its suspension type. You can do a coil over lift where swap for longer coil overs if you can get coil overs for your vehicle. Most trucks have a solid rear axle so you can put lift blocks in. You don‚Äôt want to do lift blocks on the front so the coil over method works well. It also depends how high you want to go. The higher you want to go, the more customization you will need. I actually have a rav4 that if I were to lift it, I would put a 2-3 inch spacer between the stock coil and shocks in the front. In the rear I would either go to longer springs or do a spacer. I would need a longer aftermarket shock in the rear. My friend has a Tacoma and to do a 3 inch lift he‚Äôs doing spacers in the front like the rav4, and blocks in the rear. You don‚Äôt want to go to a massive block for safety reasons so higher then a few inches and you will need to 4 link it or use a similar method. 4 link suspension has a TON of advantages but isn‚Äôt cheap. I can‚Äôt explain it better than a google image search but it really helps control your axles movement. The method of lift and how far really determines the ride quality. A few inch spacer lift on stock springs would have minimal affect except it would lift the center of gravity a bit. A bigger lift let‚Äôs you customize the spring ratio so you can customize the ride. If you won‚Äôt be towing a lot, you can go softer and improve the ride a lot. Lifting your vehicle usually means bigger tires and worse aerodynamics meaning worse mpg. With big enough tires, you will need to re-gear the drivetrain as bigger tires change the affective gear ratio. 
"
"
"
"Whether you go up or down, you will need an alignment to get your suspension geometry back to where it should be. If you go too far up or down you will need aftermarket suspension parts to put your wheels back in alignment. 
"
"
"
"A common way to do adjustable height is airbags. You can use airbags to lift or lower, but they are more commonly used to lower. How they ride really depends on which company you use and you get what you pay for. I would use accuair but a good shop knows what‚Äôs best for your vehicle. You can deflate the airbags to sit lower or fully pump them up to go higher. Your usual driving height is usually somewhere in the middle and you get your alignment set to the height you intend to drive at. Air can also be used to assist a lift. It allows you to run soft springs and drive around with the airbags deflated, thus improving the ride. When you want to load up something heavy or tow something heavy, you inflate the bags to give you a stiffer affective spring rate.

"""
"
"""Certainly. First, and at the most basic level, Autopilot does a much better job of lane centering than other """"lane keep assist"""" systems on other cars. It doesn't just react to where you are in the lane at the moment; it maps out the road ahead and proactively steers in anticipation of upcoming directional changes. If it loses track of the lanes (because the lane markings disappear further down the road, or whatever) then it just follows the car ahead. In all of these respects it already beats out competing systems.
"
"
"
"Second, Autopilot reacts in a limited way to what's going on in neighboring lanes. No other """"lane keep assist"""" system on other cars does this. Even if you don't have FSD, Autopilot recognizes blinkers on other cars trying to merge into your lane, and yields to them (sometimes too permissively, in fact; I expect this will improve in a future update). If you do have Enhanced Autopilot (or FSD), then you can change lanes and take freeway on/off ramps on Autopilot. In the case of lane changing, Autopilot checks your blind spot, and then switches over. Newer versions of NoA proactively change lanes unassisted to get around slow cars. For on/off ramps, Autopilot modulates the vehicle speed as appropriate for the ramp. Other cars' adaptive cruise control systems don't do any of this.
"
"
"
"Third, and perhaps most importantly, Autopilot gets meaningfully better each day, for free, via OTA updates, without having to bring the car in for service or upgrades. No other car company does this. You can already find videos on Youtube of people showing off stoplight detection, which is far beyond what any other car has.""
