After that he learned to cut logs with a chain  saw in Vancouver, British Columbia. The hardest job Musk took came after  a visit to the unemployment office. He inquired about the job with the  best wage, which turned out to be a gig cleaning the boiler room of a  lumber mill for eighteen dollars an hour. """"You have to put on this  hazmat suit and then shimmy through this little tunnel that you can  barely fit in,"""" Musk said. """"then you have a shovel and you take the sand  and good and other residue, which is still steaming hot, and you have  to shovel it through the same hole you came through. There is no escape.  Someone else on the other side has to shovel it into a wheelbarrow. If  you stay in there for more than thirty minutes, you get too hot and  die.""""

"You don’t get Elon rich without rolling the dice.
"
"big risk big reward
"
"that's why I bought Tesla shares to support his vision/mission-we shouldn't standby and admire.
"
"Probably part of why Mark Cuban sings his praises. Cuban always applauds people on Shark Tank who say they're all in like that.
"
"""I did, certainly not as much as Elon but I put all of my retirement funds into tesla. I have sold off alot of that at a good time and have grown my retirement significantly from that profit. Tesla now is less than 20% of that fund.""

"
"""Wha'ts a """"now"""", and how would I enjoy it?""
"
"""Yes, I did, as soon as I could (and tried to get in pre-IPO but didn't have the right connections, rich get richer... :-/).  It went well.
"
"
"
"Of course I've since sold just about everything, since the company has been screwing up quite ridiculously in the last month or two especially.""
"
"""I wouldn't have. Elon is a damn good CEO, and businessman, and I'm not ready to be the type of CEO who gives away ALL their earnings for one or two companies.""
"
"""I gave all of life savings at the age of 21 to buy a Model 3 - basically the same thing, right?""
"
"""We got one for my girlfriend a few weeks ago, and all I want to do is trade my car in and get one. I legitimately feel guilty driving my car now.""
"
"Why not just invest 179.5 million and leave some for rent and food?
"
"Elon musk is my lord and savior
"
"Apostrophe S does not a plural make.
"
"""At the rate he's going to be charging for FSD, we all will be giving our savings to Tesla.""
"
"""If I got the same rewards as he did for Tesla being a success, I sure would.""
"
"And people attack this guy for being wealthy.
"
"Long live Elon Musk!!!
"
"""Thank you Elon. You give this world hope. We're just normal folks. But most billionaires are just trying to make more money off of us normal folks at any cost. They will sell our kid's futures to make a buck. I've been asked to prove Elon is not like the rest of them. Not just in it for the money. Well, this is the proof. Elon risked everything back then. And he continues to lead. Sticking to the mission. Caring about the future of humanity. One of the few leaders actually trying.  This is why my wife and I gave up gas and bought 2 Teslas in the middle of Oklahoma. This is why we attend EV events on weekends, trying to spread the word. This is why I believe we can make a difference. Again, thank you Elon!""
"
"USA rocks and Elon musk rocks
"
"We can enjoy Tesla's what?
"
"Along those lines: A lot of media and CEOs and pundits were clamoring about his compensation based on continual doubling of the stock price being a bad strategy for the company.  They're pretty silent on that now... What? Two years in?
"
"""He-Lon brought electric cars to the masses and challenged big automakers to shift to electric powertrains.  That said, Teslas designs are IMHO boring, and starting to get long in the tooth.  I like tactile interfaces... I recognize that touchscreens in cars are a thing now, I just don't want it to be the only thing. Tesla egged the auto manufacturers into designing the very cars that'll edge tesla out of the market or into a buyout.  My wife and I can afford a Polestar and have had Volvos for decades, so we'll wait for that. Hell... VW is claiming a $22k plug-in in 3 years.""

"Give and risk are different things

"Yo but he was actully never broke he investet the money or am i wrong ?
"
"""I am just happy that visionaries are so accessible today that whoever you are, you can possible get a reply within the hour from them. This is truly a great time.""
"
"""Hearing how he does business, I'm convinced his life is a ground hogs day scenario. I can't imagine having the balls to invest everything I have on something. Get it right, make a fortune, then do it again.""
"
"""Maybe if Tesla made a profit, he wouldn’t have to.""
"
"There's no other person I admire as much as Elon
"
"In some respects I think many people did exactly this when purchasing a Model 3.
"
"""The Elon-jerking here is a bit misguided : he has actually borrowed against his TSLA stock to pay for several houses and his living expenses. This means that if TSLA drops below some some level, his broker will start selling his shares (""""margin call"""") and TSLA will drop like crazy. Basically Elon has put the company at risk by borrowing against his share of the company, and this is a risk that's explicitly mentioned by the company in its SEC filings.""

"If things didn’t work out he always had his family’s South African diamond mine to fall back on.
"
"A reasonable decision would've been leaving atleast like 100k for himself  to survive on. This was poor judgement by Elon and shouldn't be seen as something to look up to lol

"thank u for trying to the world a better place
"
"Lol
"
"Why is this a good thing? He could have saved one of those millions and lived decadently.

"That's just bad money management. Looking at this as anything else just because it worked out for him is survivorship bias.

"How hard is it to invest $179 million and keep $1million to yourself until your investments started to make profits ?

His brother bragged in an inteview about them having so much money when they were kids, they couldn't even fit it into their safe. This guy grew up fucking rich and the only reason he was able to """"risk"""" anything is because he had it in the first place despite doing literally nothing for it.

Stop treating him like he's some kind of messiah, Elon is just another spoiled rich kid who could only do the things he did because he was born into wealth that he did nothing to earn. FFS, he claims to have mastered programming by the age of 10 at a time when a PC would have cost AT LEAST $4,000 in today's money. I'm sure plenty of poor kids around the world could have mastered it and sold their own game too if they're parents had $4K laying around for them to burn. Downvote me plebs.""
"
"Christ alive!
"
"Yea that month was rough ride for him if I remember correctly. With last of SpaceX about to be tried and was also on last leg for Tesla around same time wasn’t it?  Then suddenly things went right within small time frame.
"
"Is that the Ashley Vance bio?
"
"Also they were weeks from bankruptcy sorting out the model 3 production line
"
"Can I have a link to the biography? wouldn't mind a read.
"
"Tesla was already well on the way in what it was doing. He was going bank up either way
"
"It was NASA. Christmas Eve NASA calls him up telling him SpaceX got the  contract.
"
"""> (think it was Daimler?)
"
"
"
"Yep. Daimler injected $50M into Tesla in 2009. They cashed out in 2014 for a cool $730M in profit (nice!). Tesla and Daimler have had a good relationship since, and Elon recently expressed interest in partnering for a Tesla-powered Sprinter EV van.""
"
"The funds came in Xmas eve. I'm pretty sure he said he bought presents from the service station that year
"
"Yeah I remember he was down to his last dollars when he finally gets his companies to start rolling out profits. I read the biography and it was absolutely amazing. It is insanely how many times he almost lost it all but was able to stay determined and overcome it.
"
"""I'm a big Elon fan, but I'd also remember that this wasn't charity, he didn't """"give"""" it all to Tesla, he made a bet about the future. One that paid off billions of dollars to him (got hundreds of times back what he bet). It took a lot of guts!

"we need more of those, fuck this short term gain for share holders meanwhile destroying brand recognition and quality. everytime a decent company pops up they get bought and gutted by shitty new ceo's.""

"
"""My thoughts exactly. 
"

"His mind is always in the “why not?” and not in the “let’s play it safe”.
"
"
"
"Does that lend itself well to a publicly traded company?  That remains to be seen, but I can see the arguments on both sides.""
"
"Quite fitting that he runs A company called Tesla
"
"""I’m a relatively young stockholder made of nothing but time. I have about 5% of my net worth in TSLA stock. It’s harrowing but also feels good. Very rewarding to be a stakeholder and to cheer him on. He’s definitely a fucking moron sometimes. I feel that for Tesla Elon would be better suited in a 100% technical role. Just roaming around the factories zeroing in on shit. He works better as ceo of spacex because the science is a bigger piece of he company, no shareholders, no sec, no real competition (the exploratory nature vs. competition just makes people think diff about financing if”. Again huge Elon fan.""
"
"I don't know man. Ya he does stupid shit like smoke weed  and get caught but other then that the stock would drop like a stack of bricks without him. He is the Tony stark of our time.

"
"Here’s to the crazy ones!
"
"The man needs a Tim Cook.
"
"""I keep saying that Elon should be barely involved in running Tesla or Spacex now that they're doing their thing, he should hand over management of them completely and run off to try some new batshit crazy idea. That's where his talents lie.""
"
"""Take a minute to listen to any of his longer interviews and I think you’ll find him quite stable.
"
"
"
"They’re undergoing tremendous growth and are now producing a product in volume that no other manufacturer can even make- I don’t know of any parallel in the industry. He’s certainly made some un-sanitized statements that caused issues but I’ll take that over many of the politician CEOs we see today.

"
"
"Nope, the dude has some big kahunas, with vision, smarts and drive to match it. 
"
"
"
"I work for a large, global company with an absolutely beautiful stock, from a shareholder’s perspective. We manage dollars well, constantly acquire companies and our shareholders just love us. We also can’t keep talent, off-shored R&D and are going to get run over by a smaller company if we can’t acquire and kill them fast enough, which is what we do.""

"
"Your left out a whole lot of hard work. Success does not find a way. It hides from you and eludes you. You have to chase the mofo down and bag it. Lots of work
"
"""His most underrated skills IMHO: hiring the right people and getting his vision across clearly. I have no idea how he does it, despite reading about his interview questions etc. ...""
"
"I think he saw 'a way' to success and that was pretty much enough. Even tho there were 99 ways for it to no happen.
"
"""Elon was central in getting 3 startups to $1B, and two of them past $10B. That's not luck.""
"
"Can't be a lot of luck since he already did it like 4 times.

"""Above all, have a vision and a problem that your product/service will solve""

"
"""Yeah, it's cool and all but I don't think people realize how common this is with entrepreneurs and startups. It begins with a lot of risk and no profits.""
"
"No ragrets
"
"what are you doing there?
"
"I will post it there haha
"
"""But honestly, why didn't he save an emergency fund? He could have put 99% of his wealth into the companies and still had a cool $1.5 mil to live off for years while his companies took off.

"Or even just keep $100,000. That doesn't even put a dent in $180 mil and you could live frugally off $100,000 for 2-3 years easily.""
"
"Those are also the people that are proud of interest rates below inflation for wealth building.
"
"Everything is solved by an S&P 500 index fund in that place.

"""That's the catch-22 right?  Since not everyone is Elon Musk, most people will fail and probably a lot of them will get themselves into financial ruin, so I still that's still good advice about having a backup plan.

">Musk spent the next year working a series of odd jobs around Canada. He tended vegetables and shoveled out grain bins at a cousin's farm located in the tiny town of Waldeck. Musk celebrated his eighteenth birthday there, sharing a cake with the family he'd just met and a few strangers from the neighborhood. After that he learned to cut logs with a chain saw in Vancouver, British Columbia. The hardest job Musk took came after a visit to the unemployment office. He inquired about the job with the best wage, which turned out to be a gig cleaning the boiler room of a lumber mill for eighteen dollars an hour. """"You have to put on this hazmat suit and then shimmy through this little tunnel that you can barely fit in,"""" Musk said. """"then you have a shovel and you take the sand and good and other residue, which is still steaming hot, and you have to shovel it through the same hole you came through. There is no escape. Someone else on the other side has to shovel it into a wheelbarrow. If you stay in there for more than thirty minutes, you get too hot and die."""" Thirty people started out at the beginning of the week. By the third day, five people were left. At the end of the week, it was just Musk and two other men doing the work.

The situation got so bad that Tesla had to shut down its factory. Publicly, Tesla said it needed to conduct maintenance on the factory, which was technically true, although the company would have soldiered on had the orders been closing as expected.

"My memory is imperfect but perhaps you've believe the book itself.  Credibility is undermined most when people dismiss  the work it takes to  succeed as something that is just effortless and simple.  Musk succeeded because it was hard and he made it happen under great duress that others would not be able to overcome.  You undermine Musk's credibility by denying him his greatest asset:  The ability to succeed under the most dire situations.  He put literally everything into success, and if that meant selling the company to see it succeed without him he was willing to do it.  That's why he succeeds over and over again, he doesn't give any option to fail and will put success over his own personal well being if necessary.""

"As far as the polar moment of inertia, it's very much applicable to real-world situation, so I'll explain it. Take all weight on the car and compare it to distance from the center axis of the car (imagine z-axis in the middle of the car). The lowest polar moment means it has most of its weight about the center axis, with little on the edges. Imagine a figure skater doing a spin. When they put their arms out (high polar moment), they slow down. When they pull their arms in (low polar moment), they can spin very fast. Same with the car. ICE can't compete. EV will spin about its axis (i.e. corner) better than a car with a higher polar moment. So by physics, it naturally has better cornering ability, *all else being equal*. Hopefully Taycan prioritizes this too, but for now only Tesla has.
"

The other variables are weight (higher means higher inertia), so 911 has 3 beaten there; and grip (stock Tesla tires prioritize long range over grip). Performance Model 3 Pilot Sport 4S are better, but still not as good as Pilot Sport Cup 2 on GT3 for example.""

So putting the range of the cars next to each other allows you to see the difference between them both more quickly (perception) and precisely (understanding).

"As I said prior, why are you limiting this to the X when Tesla make other cars where handling matters (the 3 you keep bringing up) 
"
"
"
"That YouTube video of some random guys isn’t the kind of review I’m talking about either ...
"
"
"
"Edit : not to mention the geezer said the M2 drives better ...""
"
"""Lol ok.
"
"Since you've lost the plot, let me try and get you back on track.
"
"
"
"We are talking about the Model X because it's what the etron is being compared against. That's largely why I'm limiting it to that.
"
"
"
"Also, I never said handling doesn't matter at all, bar none. It largely doesn't if you're driving a people carrier. And for the vast majority of people, you drive in largely straight lines in a city under 50 MPH occasionally making right turns. So no, it's not something you can really use on a daily basis.
"
"
"
"Also, are you calling either of the guys in that video a geezer? They're both like maybe 30 max. Are you 12?
"
"
"
"The salient point from that video is that the 3 is more than competent against a dedicated track muncher. It's still a sedan with a big heavy battery, but it's very good and way better than any other electric option from anybody, probably for a long time to come given how crappy Audi's effort has been.""
"
"""I don’t know about you or where you live, but most cities aren’t built in straight lines (blocks) handling is quite important. 
"
"
"
"Ever done 40mph around a round about in a Model X  and felt the massive body roll ? Not something I got even in a much cheaper SUV more than half its price.
"
"
"
"I guess that doesn’t matter. If that’s the case and you’re just driving in straight lines under 50 why bother with a Tesla at all ? You can accomplish that with a much cheaper EV... 
"
"
"
"I’ve wasted far too much time discussing this with you, I still haven’t learned my lesson with it comes to logical discussion with Tesla enthusiasts""
"
"""Oh yes, you're an oracle of logic. It's the Tesla fans that are wrong, not you.
"
"
"
"What joy you must get from always being the most logical person in the room.""
"
"""Lad... First you argued that interior quality doesn’t matter in a premium car.
"
"
"
"Then that handling didn’t matter 
"
"
"
"Then that the model 3 handles better than the M2(and used a video that was actually against your claim)
"
"
"
"Yes you’re very very wrong on many counts
"
"
"
"I’ll reiterate my original point. I’m entirely sure that a lot of Tesla fans have never driven a premium vehicle or any car other than a cheap Asian import (American fans)""
"
"""Hahaha okay. Let's fix a few things.
"
"
"
"First two points are largely correct but intentionally missing the fact that the handling portion was about people carriers. You're dumb as hell if you buy a people carrier to have fun around the corners. And I bet the X is just as good, if not better than the etron.
"
"
"
"I didn't ever say the 3 handled better than an M2. I said it was competent. We are comparing an electric sedan to a car that was made for the track. So no claim to be against, but even if that claim had been made, the video doesn't contradict the idea that the 3 is a good handling car.
"
"
"
"I've driven a lot of cars. I've owned several. I was just as comfortable in my plastic Chevy Silverado as I was in my GTI or the Audi Q5 or the Infiniti G37 or the Toyota Camry. Material quality stops mattering when you get past the first date. As long as it's durable, it literally doesn't matter.""

"Beautiful photo. Well done.

"""Question: Is Autopilot availabel in situations like this that are not a """"highway""""?

"Do you get car sick when using auto pilot? I want a Tesla and the question came up yesterday. If I’m in the passenger seat I get car sick. Was curious if a similar thing would happen when the car was driving it self.

Don't care that you don't want a Tesla, but you're heavily misinformed if you believe anything that you mentioned.""
"
"""The short answer is no, not really.
"
"
"
"The long answer is that Tesla has offered some of their patents under somewhat of an open licensing agreement (and I'm not even sure if it includes the SC patents; even if it did, that doesn't necessarily mean integration with the SC network would be possible and that's another similar discussion), but that the agreement is so ridiculous for an established company to accept that my personal theory is that Elon or Tesla wanted the good press of a bunch of """"Tesla is opening their patents"""" headlines (which judging from the people commenting about it, worked) without *actually* having to open their patents, so they *technically* opened them but included so many poison pills that an established company would have to be fairly insane to actually take them up on it.
"
"
"
"Analysis of the agreement at ast, such as:
"
"
"
"> First, the Pledge states that those acting in good faith will not assert any patent or intellectual property right against Tesla. Note that a company using Tesla’s patented technology is not only giving up the ability to bring an action against Tesla for patent infringement, but any form of intellectual property infringement. This includes trademark and copyright infringement, as well as trade secret misappropriation. Thus, for example, if Tesla copied a company’s source code line-for-line, that company would be required to forfeit the protection provided by the Pledge in order to enforce its rights.
"
"
"
"> Of potentially even greater consequence, the Pledge states that a company is not acting in good faith if it has asserted “any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment.” Therefore, before using technology from a Tesla patent, a company must determine whether it is willing to agree not to assert its own patents against any company operating in the electric vehicle market anywhere in the world.
"
"
"
"> The second restriction limits a company’s ability to challenge the validity of a Tesla patent. This is similar to language found in many intellectual property license agreements. However, there are a few things to note. First, this restriction applies to any Tesla patent, not only the one that the company is using. Second, the Pledge requires that the company not have any financial stake in a challenge to a Tesla patent. The term “financial stake” could be quite far reaching. For example, Tesla could argue that a supplier has a financial stake in its customer’s challenge of a Tesla patent.

">    First, the Pledge states that those acting in good faith will not assert any patent or intellectual property right against Tesla. Note that a company using Tesla’s patented technology is not only giving up the ability to bring an action against Tesla for patent infringement, but any form of intellectual property infringement. This includes trademark and copyright infringement, as well as trade secret misappropriation. Thus, for example, if Tesla copied a company’s source code line-for-line, that company would be required to forfeit the protection provided by the Pledge in order to enforce its rights.
"
"
"
">    Of potentially even greater consequence, the Pledge states that a company is not acting in good faith if it has asserted “any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment.” Therefore, before using technology from a Tesla patent, a company must determine whether it is willing to agree not to assert its own patents against any company operating in the electric vehicle market anywhere in the world.
"
"
"
">    The second restriction limits a company’s ability to challenge the validity of a Tesla patent. This is similar to language found in many intellectual property license agreements. However, there are a few things to note. First, this restriction applies to any Tesla patent, not only the one that the company is using. Second, the Pledge requires that the company not have any financial stake in a challenge to a Tesla patent. The term “financial stake” could be quite far reaching. For example, Tesla could argue that a supplier has a financial stake in its customer’s challenge of a Tesla patent.

"
"
"
"[I can admit when I'm wrong](; you just seem to ignore the complete thrashing I've given your original statement that EA is installing only a token number of high-powered chargers in *whatever* interpretation you can reasonably give it. They've brought online probably around two hundred 350 kW chargers and have hundreds more in the construction process.
"
"
"
"> Tesla owners don't really need chargers at shopping centers or restaurants, they have superchargers. A destination charge at a hotel is the only thing that really has some value. 
"
"
"
"Lower-powered chargers have value for people who can't charge at home or work, which is why destination chargers are a thing at all. Higher powered chargers can actually be an *anti*-feature in some scenarios because of idle fees and higher costs (even higehr per-kWh fees can be reasonable because of demand charges).
"
"
"
"> The problem with these 50kw chargers being installed brand new is that 50kw has no point. 
"
"
"
"The problem with your argument is that for some reason you think the 50 kW chargers (again, a small minority of what they're installing anyway) are meant for travelers. That wasn't their plan, that's not their goal, it's now how they're marketing them.""

"
"""> First, the fact that you need to look at pictures on plugshare jut to figure out what kind of chargers they have is retarded.
"
"
"
"So we went from """"they're only installing a handful of 175 kW chargers"""" to """"their map is bad"""". Move the goalposts much?
"
"
"
"(And yes... I agreed with that at the outset.)
"
"
"
"> Second, they are still wasting cash installing more 50kw chargers than other chargers and it makes no sense. ... 50kw chargers are 100% useless for travel. 
"
"
"
"*Why do you keep talking about travel?* There is more public charging need than for road tripping.
"
"
"
"> Why waste the money on a 50kw charger when you could have had a 150kw charger in its place?
"
"
"
"Presumably because they're less expensive. So no, you *couldn't* have a 150 kW charger in its place, you could have had half a 150 kW charger in its place (or whatever).""

"""> That still stands, you only showed like 20 chargers over the entire US. I could call that a handful. 
"
"
"
"That was a sample of chargers from a sample of photos from a sample of sites that aren't even all complete. There are *waaaaaay* more of them unless I got *supppper* lucky.
"
"
"
"But furthermore...
"
"
"
"> We have no idea how many 150kw chargers they will install per stop, they claimed they will only do two of the 350kw(but these are really 175kw for 400v vehicles).

"The information they have released that I've seen doesn't have enough information to determine the mix between 150 and 350 kW chargers, but I *can* tell you a lot of information about how many chargers there of those two powers in aggregate, and compared to 50 kW. I cited the source showing that, as of February, they were averaging about 200 kW over 1,388 chargers at sites that were successfully permitted or at a later stage of construction or opening. That means that the *minimum* number of 150 and 350 kW chargers in aggregate is half that, 694. But that's only achievable if there are no 150 kW chargers, which is obviously false. If we assume that there are at least as many 150 kW chargers as 350 kW chargers, then the *minimum* number of 150 and 350 kW chargers in aggregate is 1,040. That's a damn large hand.
"
"
"
"That's all information and conclusions I've posted before.
"
"
"
"Based on the sense that I got from browsing PlugShare (using information about how often I saw different numbers of stalls at a site and what I could tell from typical power mixes), my guess would be that the mix is along the line of 650 150 kW chargers, 450 350 kW chargers, and 250 50 kW chargers, and very possibly more skewed toward the higher-powered chargers.
"
"
"
"But if you have a source for your claim that they're only installing a handful other than your Elon-fueled dreams, please feel free to share.
"
"
"
"> The main transformer outside the charger is the cost, not the charger.
"
"
"
"*/me rolls his eyes.* Fine, they are installing 50 kW chargers so they can install lower cost *transformers*. Lower cost on some sites still means more sites.
"
"
"
"(Also, my understanding is demand charges from the utility would likely be noticeably higher with higher-powered chargers, but this just what I've picked up from various comments.)
"
"
"
"*Edit*: Oh, I can also tell you a minimum number of 350 kW chargers, which *directly* addresses your original comment with no need to bend 175 kW down to 150 kW! That number is 347. And *that* is only achievable if there were no 50 kW chargers, which is counterfactual, which means that there must be more than 347.""
"
"You're so far removed from the reality of people that can't afford a Tesla its not even funny.
"

"
"
"
"I've *posted* the proof that there are hundreds of 350/175 kW chargers in progress or complete and hundreds more 150, you just seem intent on ignoring it.
"
"
"
"It's pretty clear that you don't intend to debate in good faith, so I'm out unless you're prepared to put up your own actual information (or have questions that I think are asked in good faith about the algebra 1 level math that I used to get the numbers in my last post, I can explain more).""
"
"🤫
"
"""> If I haven't gotten that fact into your dense skull with the citations yet I have little hope this will help, but [this press release]( Those sites have 1,388 chargers. 300 MW divided by 1,388 means an average of """"almost"""" 216 kW/charger. Pray tell how they are achieving that average with anything but a token number of 50 kW chargers?
"
"
"
"> *Edit*: Actually it's possible to do some math. Suppose we round down the average per charger to 200 kW, and an assumption that there are an equal number of 350 kW chargers and 150 kW chargers. It's actually possible to compute how many there would be given that -- 520 each of 150 and 350 kW chargers, and 347 50 kW chargers, just a quarter of the total. Except that's actually too generous -- there are more 150 kW chargers than 350 kW chargers, and """"replacing"""" 350 with 150 means four fewer 50 kW chargers. So for example, if it were half and half than a site with six chargers would have three each of 150 and 350, but in reality I *think* those sites would usually have four 150 kW chargers and two 350 kW chargers. So that's replacing one. Let's say there are 25 or so such sites; that's probably low. That would mean that only *247* (less than 18%) of the chargers in that set could be 50 kW. I was probably too extreme with """"vast vast"""" majority, but it *is* a *large* majority of chargers they've installed that are above 50 kW.

"Why is the comment a that far reaching?  Depending on the source of electricity used to charge it an EV can have a far smaller carbon/energy footprint then a gas powered car.   By far the biggest part of a gas cars lifetime footprint is made up not by building it but burning gas in operation.    So if you charge an EV from a clean gird or solar then your gas can make a significant dent.   Where I live the grid is very clean.   When you do the numbers you can build and run 6 EVs to end of life for the same footprint as one comparable gas powered car.   So while that might not be saving the world (and you would do better if you didn't have a car altogether) it can make a significant difference in your carbon footprint.

"""I remember that nervous feeling.

And besides, the wait was perfect, we kept saving up for the car the whole time.

"
"The new car smell is from the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that the plastics and adhesives in the interior give off as they cure. There isn’t really a way to “get rid of it” as you would a smoke odor. Tesla uses low VOC components to comply with California laws so the smell doesn’t last as long as some brands. Heat and time are what cause the VOCs to be emitted. Try leaving the car in the hot sun with the windows cracked a bit and some fans in it to circulate air.

"
"""Thanks. Car is 9 months in and still smelling strong. In my experience, most new cars are not smelling new by this time. Maybe because Tasla was factory to delivery in days and most other new cars sit on boats and lots for months before delivery.""
"
"""Ok, I used to detail cars. The basics are wash, clay bar, wax. There are tons of great videos on YouTube about that.  
"
"
"
" For the most part, black is tough. So, every year or so, you're going to want to get a professional detail. From a reputable place that wont leave swirls (very noticable in black paint).  
"
"
"
"You seem to have the right idea with micro fiber and being careful, though.  
"
"
"
" Always have a special sponge/cloth and bucket for wheels. Use the same soap for wheels that you will use on your car. A lot of people recommend acid or abrasive chemicals for brake dust, but that really isn't neccessary with regular cleaning. Id say every month or so, or every 1,000 miles should be enough (unless you drive on salty roads in the winter, in which case wash every other week).  
"
"
"
"Not much to it! As long ad you're careful, you will be fine. Soak the car. Soap the car. Rinse the car. Dry the car. A few times a year, go over it with a clay bar (right after washing) and then wash it again quick. But it's really easy! I learned all this when I was 20 and really loved my car. Kept it looking sweet for the 40,000 miles I owned it. 
"
"
"
" Wax is very important! 
"
"
"
" I use mothers carnauba wax, although any carnauba works great. You put it on two panels at a time. So apply to your driver side fender, then door. Rub off the fender. Apply to rear door. Rub off front door, then apply to rear quarter, etc. all the way around. You only **have** to do this a few times a year. Spray wax is great to rub on after every wash, but doesnt last as long. Think of wax as a really thin protectant that wheres away every time you wash it.  
"
"
"
"Any more questions feel free to ask!""
"
"I personally would look into xpel paint protection wrap for any new car I get.
"
"""Eat a few times burger King, McDonald's and pizza hut in the car. I promise, the smell will we gone! 🤣""
"
"Hmmmm... 9 months is quite a while. In my experience most cars started to fade within a few weeks. Have you had the windshield/glass roof replaced or any other repairs? New windshields also give off a smell as the adhesive cures.
"
"""Does soak the car mean actually leave it wet for a bit or just spray it down first? 
"
"
"
"Also, what’s the lazy man’s version of this? I live in a mild climate where it is rainy and drizzly pretty often. 
"
"
"
"What I usually do with cars is just take them through automated car washes about once a month in winter cause no matter what, you just end up getting rained on. Then in summer I wash the car by hand and get it back into as good of shape as I can inside and out and then do automated or hand washes every couple weeks while the weather is nice. I have never clayed or waxed. If you don’t do it the first year is it essentially too late? Is there one step up from my current way of doing things or is it really like stick with what I’m doing (which doesn’t look that great) or go all the way to the regular clay and waxing and hand wash only?""
"
"What color if not black?  White?
"
"So will your intestines!
"
"No repairs. The smell is slooowly going away but it’s still quite strong.
"
"""Taking it through the automated carwash is seriously underrated. The only thing you could do better is a nice quick spray wax (with a micro fiber cloth) right after. Like, before you leave the parking lot. The only thing those tend to miss is the wheels. A good hand wash every few months would be great. That way you could clay bar it and also use your special wheel brush (I know you'll get one) and get into the nitty gritty.  
"
"
"
"  By """"soaking"""" yes, I mean wet the car. Like, really wet it, if you're doing it by hand. Try to find a shady spot, or those DIY car washes that have the hanging hose.
"
"
"
"It's never to late to clay bar! In my detailing years, we did tons of cars with near 100,000 miles that probably NEVER had a clay bar. After that, a buff and wax, they looked awesome sitting on the dealers lot. Talk about pride in your work!  
"
"
"
"If you look up some videos on clay baring, and it seems like a lot of work, most decent places will do that, buff, wax, interior, windows, etc. for about $200. Depending where you live. That could easily be worth the money, unless you're a more hands on person, like myself.""
"
"Automated car washes are great and convenient but they will leave micro scratches in the paint because people go through those things with mud and all sorta stuff and that gets trapped in their scrubbers and rubs your paint the wrong way.
"
"Same! Swirls just arent quite as visible in lighter color paints. You have to look at them just right.
"
"I would recommend wiping down the interior plastics (except the dash) with optimum power clean to try and remove any film from off gassing products that have accumulated. The dash is easy to scratch when cleaning so I would recommend cleaning that with a fresh microfiber and Optimum No Rinse (ONR) with light pressure. The headliner can also be wiped down with a microfiber moistened with a little bit of power clean. That should help the smell.
"
"Thank you for the tips! I am a do-it-yourself type dude in many aspects of life but I really have to be in the mood for the car exterior stuff and unfortunately when it’s winter especially that mood doesn’t strike nearly as often as I need it to.

"To copy/paste something I posted elsewhere before:
"
"
"
"A while back I did some calculations : 
"
"
"
"These stats are accurate as of March 28th, 2019 with data that was available:
"
"
"
"* 618,128 vehicles according to Tesla Garage leak, 2019 Near end of Q1: /
"
"* 10,286,222,684 miles : see above
"
"* 16,641 miles per vehicle average 
"
"* 1 year 8 months average age per car (1,019,368 vehicle years / 618,128 vehicles) : See below for VY source
"
"* 10,085 average miles per year
"
"
"
"...  So the average Tesla on the road is 1 year and 8 months old and has only driven 16,641 miles.  This is the problem with going by the """"billions of miles driven"""" statistic.  Most of those billions were driven by hundreds of thousands of cars driving less than 20,000 miles.  
"
"
"
"CNN's stat was that there were 40 fires when Tesla only had 300,000 cars on the road.  It's double that now.  There have been two major Tesla fires in just the past week.  If that continues to be a trend that's 100 a year.
"
"
"
"Another factor to consider, low price gas cars like Kias & Hyundais with the garbage “Theta II” engines wreck the gas fire statistic because they are causing more fires than most other manufacturers combined.  Tesla's were up until 3 years ago a very high dollar car that is traditionally less likely to catch fire even in gas models (you pay for more safety).

"Ok, prove me to that a """"huge amount"""" of fires are due to this cause. This is anecdotal, and is no better than the statistic this whole post is around. I'm not a fan of fighting junk statistics with anecdotes. In the fema report insulation around wires starts on fire more often than the flammable liquids:
"
"
"
">Insulation around electrical wiring (29 percent) and flammable liquids in the engine area (18 percent) were the most common items first ignited in highway vehicle fires.
"
"
"
"In the flammable liquids (26% of the fires) category gasoline, not oil, is the primary contributor.
"
"
"
">The second leading category of items first ignited was “liquids, piping, filters” (26 percent). This category primarily includes fuel in various locations in the vehicle. Due to its combustibility, fuel from the engine area was the leading specific item first ignited within this category and was the second most common specific item first ignited in highway vehicle fires overall (18 percent)
"
"
"
"So to my point, no, oil dripping on the exhaust is not a """"huge amount"""" of fires. If it were, it would have been called out, instead fuel was.
"
"
"
">But looking at only the ICE specific components there are incredibly few possibilities of fire other than fluids leaking on something hot, or something faulty in the exhaust itself. 
"
"
"
"Other areas get hot enough to generate fires, without fluids. Failures of catalytic converter heat shields can cause cars to ignite when parked on grass. Clogged converters can also get hot enough to start the insulation of cabins on fire.""
"

"
"
"
"Then you are bad with statistics. There are more older cars on the road than younger cars. So to actually be able to use data you would need to be able to accurately determine that the number of older cars having problems is greater than simply the greater proportion of older to younger cars. You need to normalize by the number of cars or else the data is meaningless.

">Show me where I said that it had to be residual heat from the device? You said ignition sources. I listed them.
"
"
"
"See the problem is you do not understand what an ignition source is. If a spark ignites something then the alternator is not the ignition source. The alternator can create a spark but the spark is the ignition source. To say the alternator is the ignition source full stop can only reasonably imply the surface of it, just like saying the exhaust is the ignition source means the heat from it not sparks created if it drags on the ground. Then the ignition source would be the sparks created. Words do matter.

">Alternators get hot and could probably start a fire on their own

"They would not get hot enough to ignite gas like you implied. They do not hit 536F, even if they are faulty. Alternators typically work around the 200F range and will stop working well before 500F.""

"
"
"
"Anyway, the graph is pretty simple, and the very research in that article says that as safety standards became more strict car fires have lower incidence. (words are important, remember?) As time goes on, yes, the cars age, but you also start weeding out the old old cars, and they are replaced by newer tech older cars. This is why as time progresses fire incidence gets lower, and cars get safer. You can see the same curve with injuries in cars. Cars get safer over time, that leads to a decline in fatal injuries.

"

"
"That is 100% untrue. The beauty in normalizing data based on the number of cars on the road per model year is that you do not need to define what is """"old""""; the data speaks for itself. You just simply do not group cars in multiple year groups, you show your data per model year normalized by the number of vehicles of that year on the road.

"
"Wait until you see all the shortcut inputs :O
"
"""It all depends how you do it. The most common way to lower a car is through coil overs I think. Most people set them up to be slightly stiffer but it really improves handling. You can set them up to ride like stock but you risk bottoming out unless you go to a progressive spring rate which gets stiffer as it compresses. Usually slightly more expensive but I’d say it’s worth it. 
"
"
"
"There are a ton of ways to lift vehicles and it all depends on its suspension type. You can do a coil over lift where swap for longer coil overs if you can get coil overs for your vehicle. Most trucks have a solid rear axle so you can put lift blocks in. You don’t want to do lift blocks on the front so the coil over method works well. It also depends how high you want to go. The higher you want to go, the more customization you will need. I actually have a rav4 that if I were to lift it, I would put a 2-3 inch spacer between the stock coil and shocks in the front. In the rear I would either go to longer springs or do a spacer. I would need a longer aftermarket shock in the rear. My friend has a Tacoma and to do a 3 inch lift he’s doing spacers in the front like the rav4, and blocks in the rear. You don’t want to go to a massive block for safety reasons so higher then a few inches and you will need to 4 link it or use a similar method. 4 link suspension has a TON of advantages but isn’t cheap. I can’t explain it better than a google image search but it really helps control your axles movement. The method of lift and how far really determines the ride quality. A few inch spacer lift on stock springs would have minimal affect except it would lift the center of gravity a bit. A bigger lift let’s you customize the spring ratio so you can customize the ride. If you won’t be towing a lot, you can go softer and improve the ride a lot. Lifting your vehicle usually means bigger tires and worse aerodynamics meaning worse mpg. With big enough tires, you will need to re-gear the drivetrain as bigger tires change the affective gear ratio. 
"
"
"
"Whether you go up or down, you will need an alignment to get your suspension geometry back to where it should be. If you go too far up or down you will need aftermarket suspension parts to put your wheels back in alignment. 
"
"
"
"A common way to do adjustable height is airbags. You can use airbags to lift or lower, but they are more commonly used to lower. How they ride really depends on which company you use and you get what you pay for. I would use accuair but a good shop knows what’s best for your vehicle. You can deflate the airbags to sit lower or fully pump them up to go higher. Your usual driving height is usually somewhere in the middle and you get your alignment set to the height you intend to drive at. Air can also be used to assist a lift. It allows you to run soft springs and drive around with the airbags deflated, thus improving the ride. When you want to load up something heavy or tow something heavy, you inflate the bags to give you a stiffer affective spring rate.

"""This image is, to me, the paragon of the future. 
"
"
"
"This image represents all that is good in the future, all that mankind has to look forward to. I see great beauty in its forward juxtaposition of sleek technology on the nature-rich, scenic as-if-painted-by-hand backdrop. Left alone. Respected by us, finally, in spite of the destruction we have wrought upon her.
"
"
"
"Intentionally or not, the photographer perfectly captured all that a company like Tesla symbolizes, and by greater extension, technology itself: Man, or rather Man’s artifice, having surpassed even nature, sits in the foreground. The structure, the supercharger, is a minimal one; not only resource-efficient, but respectful to the environment in both a figurative and literal sense - it takes up less of the picture, it takes less from our beautiful world so that we can more leisurely bask in her unadulterated splendor. A future that leaves the environment ‘s beauty in tact, the structure - a window into that brave future’s horizon. Past it are mountains: oh, there will be challenges. There will be grave strife! But we will pass those mountains! We will drive headfirst into the Sun herself.
"
"
"
"The car underneath - sleek, attractive, luxuriant, ideal. It represents hope and ideology. Hope for mankind’s artificial world, one that will alleviate suffering (car accidents and environmental destruction), and replace it with beauty. An ideology of purification, correcting the wrongs of our past.
"
"
"
"Even better, the vehicle connects to the structure, as if to say “My fate, my future, is tethered to this ideal that we have laid the groundwork for. When my ship sets sail, you shall be on it. We are one - I, representing your ideology, and you, my progenitor.”

"Now the Tesla fleet size is different so maybe the factor is more like 10,000 times more often for gas cars but the headline problem still remains.

"
"""
"
"""Certainly. First, and at the most basic level, Autopilot does a much better job of lane centering than other """"lane keep assist"""" systems on other cars. It doesn't just react to where you are in the lane at the moment; it maps out the road ahead and proactively steers in anticipation of upcoming directional changes. If it loses track of the lanes (because the lane markings disappear further down the road, or whatever) then it just follows the car ahead. In all of these respects it already beats out competing systems.
"
"
"
"Second, Autopilot reacts in a limited way to what's going on in neighboring lanes. No other """"lane keep assist"""" system on other cars does this. Even if you don't have FSD, Autopilot recognizes blinkers on other cars trying to merge into your lane, and yields to them (sometimes too permissively, in fact; I expect this will improve in a future update). If you do have Enhanced Autopilot (or FSD), then you can change lanes and take freeway on/off ramps on Autopilot. In the case of lane changing, Autopilot checks your blind spot, and then switches over. Newer versions of NoA proactively change lanes unassisted to get around slow cars. For on/off ramps, Autopilot modulates the vehicle speed as appropriate for the ramp. Other cars' adaptive cruise control systems don't do any of this.
"
"
"
"Third, and perhaps most importantly, Autopilot gets meaningfully better each day, for free, via OTA updates, without having to bring the car in for service or upgrades. No other car company does this. You can already find videos on Youtube of people showing off stoplight detection, which is far beyond what any other car has.""

"sure. it was printed here: [

"Haha. Didn't mean it to be.
"
"Not sure but I know this was taken with her iPhone 8 after a rainy day in LA.
"
"it was printed here. [

"it's a shame :( it's such a neat effect

"Could we get a discount for us Tesla reddit family members? ;)
"
"Ok nice

"""Driving it is just the beginning. Once you live with it and drive it day to day, all ICE vehicles will be ruined for you. 
"
"
"
"The acceleration, the technology, over the air updates, having an extremely low center of gravity, the knowledge that you will always have instant power whenever you need it. 
"
"
"
"The biggest downside to owning a Tesla is realizing how difficult it will be to own anything else.""
"
"Sigh - I test drove a P3D.   And now I’m going to pick it up next week.
"
"Yep! Getting back in your ICE vehicle after driving one is like going back to a horse and buggy.
"
"Drove my Jeep a relatively long distance yesterday and was annoyed that it didn’t have autopilot.  Driving your car is exhausting.

"kidding aside. Yep. I bought my Model 3 without test driving. Was a little nervous. But after the first 5 seconds I was convinced. THIS IS THE FUTURE.""
"
"""This exactly..... I have a 2019 insight and I’m moving, so I’ve decided to get a model 3 for California. The little loss (money) is worth it to me!""
"
"I had the same experience. #mindblown!
"
"I have that exact car. Totally worth hit!!!
"
"my appointment is tomorrow/today at 3!

"""A good buddy of mine who's owned a Porsche Carrera GT, 911 GT3, Ferrari 458 now wants a Tesla M3-Here's the kicker, just wants a dual motor.  """"I don't need the P3D acceleration"""".

"
"The Model 3 is that good!""
"
"Driving is believing
"
"It’s a nice car. I enjoy driving it. I also still love driving my 1994 Honda Accord w 145k miles on it.
"
"Just wait until you own one.  Then you will really know what the hype is about!
"
"you guys are a cult lmao. but I'm cool with joining as long as there's no Kool aid involved
"
"Yes all that is true. Driving it once you see why it’s so crazy. But driving it EVERYDAY is epic for a huge range of special points. The hype is real.
"
"""Not only ICEs will be ruined, EVs too. Mostly, because you will switch windshield wipers instead of putting car in reverse.""
"
"It's really really hard not to look like an asshole driving it because it's so easy to forget that you can leap from stoplight to stoplight with minimal effort. It just dominates nearly any idiot stupid enough to Rev their engine at a stop....im 8 months into my P3D and the beast just doesn't get old.
"
"Barbaric.
"
"Yes this. First time I test drove a BMW i3 and got back in my Civic I felt like a caveman
"
"""Just drove 6 hours in wife’s car to the beach, the whole ride I was hating life. I felt like a Neanderthal having to steer and listen to XM radio. Just gross.""

"""I bought mind without a test drive, arrives Tuesday. Most I have done is sat in one at the store. Even more fun is I went with the white interior and I haven't even seen that in person.

"The really funny part is you don't realize how ruined other cars are until you drive one and it just feel *wrong*.
"
"""Nah, we drink Flavor Aid (shhh! Don’t anybody tell him!).""
"
"We got the best Kool Aid... Electro Cooler.
"
"You would think that before owning but you get it afterward. The 3 has ruined cars for me. Once you get used to the single gear pure torque drivetrain you just dread being in anything else.

"Just promise you won't change your name to Jim Jones

"""All other release notes from Sentry Mode down appear to be the same as 2019.8.3 (and possibly 2019.8.4, but I didn't receive that update to confirm).
