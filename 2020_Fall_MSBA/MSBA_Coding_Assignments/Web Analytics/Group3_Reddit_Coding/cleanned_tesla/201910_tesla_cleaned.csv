I know they since raised the price a bit but many short sellers were attracted to the idea the Tesla was burning money in each sale which it was. But they have since increased production and raised the price slightly. So they have very small margins but it’s fairly sustainable. If I was an investor I would want a little bit higher margins so that they could reinvest in itself. They could also manufacture some of its cars in a third world country to cut down cost and release it for 35,000. Of all musk ventures spacex is his most successful. Then Tesla and PayPal.

He knew the potentially most likely spot for the kids and their coach to have reached 'safety' - and he turned out to be correct. The local thai rescue divers were unable to reach that spot, and Unsworth then further helped by contacting Stanton and Volanthen - the actual *British cave divers* who found the kids. So Unsworth's contribution was incredibly important. However - he was *not* a diver or part of the 'active' rescue team. Many, many articles about this incident make it sound like Musk made the accusation against one of the actual divers. Not so - Musk was in fact in constant contact with the *actual* divers, and they were the ones that provided him the dimensions for the 'sub', as well as *explicitly asked him to continue working on it* when he asked if it was still 'needed', since the pumping effort had made the 'original plan' work very well, and kids were already being brought out. So Unsworth's comments about the sub, and telling Musk to 'shove it up his ass' were really, really uncalled for. If Musk had simply called him an *asshole* he'd have been completely justified. But instead, he went and committed some really *serious* libel, so *poof* goes the high ground. And then he doubled down.

"
"""It’s like any other loan: you pay interest, but the interest changes with current valuation. So having those shares borrowed costs you progressively more as the stock increases value. At some point the value exceeds your credit limit with whoever lent you the shares and you have to start returning them, i.e. buying them at the current price and returning them to the lender. Borrowing in stock transactions is called margin, and margin call is when the lender wants their shares/money back. 
"

"And you borrow the shares not to hold them, but to sell them. That’s what short selling is: you sell what you borrowed. It’s a risky move because the losses are unlimited until the lender decides to rein you in. When you buy stock to hold, worst you lose is what you paid for it. Say you’d lose $100 per share if you bought them at that price and held until the company went bust. But you sold the shares short, and now they are worth $1000, and you have to return that much when the margin call comes. Your loss is $900 plus interest you paid while the shares were outstanding.""

"
"That's what happens when people don't have the generator isolation switches that are required now. The old fashioned way was to just shut off your main breaker to disconnect your house from the grid and hooking up a generator to your dryer outlet and backfeeding power into your electrical panel. It's safer for your system to use switches that are actually meant for that purpose and it's illegal because people couldn't be trusted to remember to isolate their house from the grid. The powerwall and panels are essentially functioning as a backup generator setup and with the right isolation switches it should work fine. I don't think just any old solar panel setup could be used this way because the solar panel is outputting X Watts and your appliances are drawing Y Watts and that mismatch is handled by the grid connection with systems that don't have a powerwall. In the generator analogy this is not really a problem because generators have a throttle that adjusts up or down based on the demand on the generator.

Drawing less power than your panels are producing wouldn't be a problem but With 0 system power storage you can't exceed the solar panel's output for even a fraction of a second. so it would only kinda work if you have like 4x the panels needed to offset your house's usage and you had a special expensive type of off grid inverter. Lets say you have a 4kW  solar panel setup and it generates enough to offset your entire house's usage. its noon and sunny and its currently capable of 4kW. your appliances don't have the ability to store power and spread their draw out, though. They're always switching on and off, your solar system is going net positive/net negative. your AC compressor draws 6kW but it turns on 15 minutes every hour, and when it turns on there's an inrush power spike of 12kW for a second or two. but with absolutely 0 storage capacity the inverter will either have to let the voltage or frequency it outputs drop, which fries your electronics or itself, or the inverter will have to shut off when the draw hits 4.01kW, which means it will cycle on and off extremely fast, frying your electronics or itself, or it would handle this gracefully and just refuse to work at all until the load on it is below your panel's output 100% of the time.""

"he talks about the new protocol required for these grid tied solar inverters. Its required now that the homeowner solar panel inverters adjust their own output based on the frequency of the grid, so as there's too much power being generated, the frequency rises up to 61 Hz and that triggers all the homeowner solar inverters to gradually shut down, as the frequency drops back down to 60 Hz they come back online. How this is all really beneficial to the power companies who now can essentially control all the connected homeowner solar systems by modulating the grid frequency. This basically allows the utility to continue selling the electricity to the homeowner during peak solar periods, and prevents the homeowner from selling electricity to the grid, unless the grid is actually in need of the electricity. It allows the utility to operate the homeowner panels as peaker plants, as a buffer, basically in a manner thats most profitable for the utility, as opposed to a system where homeowners benefit the most, i.e. actually capturing 100% of the solar energy available from their panels and being able to resell the extra.

Using this frequency-watt function, now built into the microinverters they can take your 30 or 40 or 50 thousand dollar investment, which now not only doesn't even provide power in an emergency, it also doesn't even provide power most of the time. Its kind of like cutting off the power to prevent a forest fire. And so why would you want to spend that kind of money when it doesn't even reduce your utility bill. And instead acts as a peaker plant or in kind of an inverted sense a battery for the grid. A buffer, where sudden increases of load can be provided, at least during sunny periods of the day, when industries using electricity, it will automatically buffer demands. A little bit of increase in load will cause a sag in frequency and that will automatically ramp up 8,000 MW of rooftop solar in california, anyway, to increase their output, and as the frequency goes back up and the load bump is over, it'll go right back down, and what you'll be paid or offset on your bill will be trivialized to the point where your rooftop solar investment is essentially worthless and that will be a huge disincentive, then for anyone in the future to do this, cause it's not gonna save them any money.

Let’s say you buy the average ICE car new at $30k and depreciate it over 12 years, that’s $2500/year in straight line depreciation plus another $1200 or so in gas alone. And the car doesn’t produce a return like solar panels.

Assuming he drives 15k miles a year (fairly average) and gets 25 mpg (average across US fleet) then he’s using 600 gallons a year. That’s $1500 a year at the US average of $2.5/gal. That’s more in variable costs than fixed cost depreciation.

"
"Assume a $30k car over 12 years, then depreciation is a larger cost center at $2500, but that’s assuming gas costs hold. If gas goes up just a dollar average, then you’re at $2100/year. Then gas is almost as much as depreciation.

"Previously in the same Video they complain about the Build Quality (conveniently forgetting that the Porsche is almost twice as expensive). But honestly, that's what German Quality is known for. Would be sad if it was anything else. You would really need to compare the Tesla to the Cayenne which is equally expensive to be drive this point home.

"

"*Guess what, my 2016 Citroen Cactus has also shoddier build quality than a Mercedes GLA, even though the latter just costs double the listing price.

Meanwhile, the Viper has an engine that has been around for 30 years, a manual transmission, RWD with a regular LSD, a big wing, and driven by a random driver.

"Honestly, I think a big part of it has to do with drivers. The Z06 and Viper lap times were not factory efforts. The Z06 lap was done by a magazine driver and the Viper lap was done by a less experienced driver. Meanwhile all of the other manufacturers have whole teams of engineers with factory test pilots to set the laps. For example, Porsche's official time for the GT2 RS was 6:40.33. But when tested by Sport Auto (the same magazine that set the Z06 lap) they only did 6:58. Hence why I chose VIR as most of the lap times are posted by one very experienced driver. Many of the lap times were even done in the same day. To me, it's just a better way of eliminating many variables.

In addition, it isn't even clear if both those peaks can occur simultaneously - if they can't, peak power is even lower than that. Pessimistically, if that's input power to the motors and not shaft power, if they're 90% efficient, and if the front motor and rear motor power peaks are misaligned, that could mean that actual wheel horsepower is all the way down at 600 or so (though I expect it's actually a bit above this, given the performance).""

I think they might be very close on power numbers, (porsche wanted to beat the model S) with the german getting some advantage from bigger tyres and the gearing on the very top end.

""">Tesla's new Solar Roof costs less than a new roof plus solar panels, aims for install rate of 1K per week
"
"October 25, 2019, 3:16 PM PDT
"
"
"
">Tesla has launched the third iteration of its solar roof tile for residential home use, which it officially detailed in a blog post on Friday and in a call with media. Tesla CEO Elon Musk kicked off the call with some explanatory remarks on the V3 Solar Roof, and then took a number of questions. The company says it'll begin installations in the coming weeks (Musk says some installations have already begun) and that it hopes to ramp production to as many as 1,000 new roofs per week.
"
"
"
">Tesla's solar roof tiles — which are designed to look just like normal roof tiles when installed on a house, while doubling as solar panels to generate power — are something of a work-in-progress. The company is still tinkering with the product three years after announcing the concept, having done trial installations with two different iterations so far. """"Versions one and two we were still figuring things out,"""" said Elon Musk on an earnings call earlier this week, adding that he thinks """"version three is finally ready for the big time.""""
"
"
"
">Tesla's Solar Roof website now includes a pricing estimator, which lists $42,500 as the total price for the average 2,000 square-foot home, with 10kW solar panels. It also lists $33,950 as the price after an $8,550 federal tax incentive. You can also enter your address and get an updated estimate that takes into account local costs and incentives, and add on any Powerwalls (with three as the default for a 2,000 square-foot roof).
"
"
"
">""""The solarglass roof is not going to make financial sense for somebody who has a relatively new roof, because this is itself a roof, that has integrated solar power generation,"""" Musk explained. He went on to note that Tesla has managed with this version three product to achieve a price point that is """"less than what the average roof costs, plus the solar panels"""" that you would add on top of said roof.
"
"
"
">""""Figuring out how to install it effectively is very non-trivial. And we're actually going to have [...] 'installathons,' """" Musk said, which will pit two teams against each other to see who can roof one of two similar-sized/designed roofs faster. Musk reiterated later that there's """"quite a bit of R&D just in the installation process itself.""""
"
"
"
">Musk also said that while it's hiring and training specialized installers at first, the plan is to ultimately expand installations to any third-party contractors as well. On the call, he and the Tesla team discussed how they focused on getting the installation time down to where it's faster than installing traditional shingles, plus solar panels on top of that. Musk added that his ultimate goal is to install the solar glass tiles even faster than comparative shingles. This is a significant change from version two of the solar roof, Musk later said.
"
"
"
">""""We're doing installations as fast as we possibly can, starting in the next few weeks,"""" Musk said about September availability, adding that the goal is to """"get to 1,000 roofs per week"""" sometime in """"the next several months.""""
"
"
"
">A report from CNBC from  2018 found that Tesla still hadn't performed many actual installations of its solar roof tile, despite the two-year gap between announcement and the date of their investigation, and a January announcement about the initiation of solar roof tile production at Tesla's Buffalo-based Gigafactory. During the company's annual general shareholder meeting in June, Musk said that the third iteration of the tile was being worked on, and while he didn't detail the actual number of installations, he did say that they were in progress in eight different states across the U.S. at that point.
"
"
"
">Musk addressed some of the production delays to date, addressing the installation complexity of previous generations, but also citing the Tesla Model 3 production ramp, which he said """"really stripped resources from solar for a year or a year-and-a-half."""" Now that Model 3 production is in a good place, Musk said that that has unblocked significantly some of the company's ability to focus on this challenge.
"
"
"
">The total addressable market that Musk sees for this product is somewhere on the order of 100 million houses worldwide, and Musk stressed that the company does indeed intend to make this available worldwide.
"
"
"
">While at launch there will be only one available look for the Solar Roof, the Tesla CEO also said that the company will roll out additional variants as quickly as it can, including tiles that resemble clay and other alternatives.
"
"
"
">The tiles and roof installation carry a warranty of 25 years, which includes their protective weatherization (including 130 MPH wind resistance) and their power generation capability. On balance, the Solar Roof provides more energy generation than a similarly sized roof retrofitted with traditional tiles, though individually, the tile's power-gathering cells themselves are less energy-efficient than a traditional solar cell. The Solar Roof is better performing, however, because it covers more surface area of a home.""

Meanwhile the average lifetime of a 3-tab asphalt shingle roof in places such as Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and the like are more like 5-10 years. This is mostly due to a lack of proper attic ventilation which overheats the attic space and in turn the shingles, causing blisters, thermal cracking, etc. the other reason they don’t last as long is due to increased environmental hazards like hail, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.

"My standpoint on this being in the construction industry leads me to steer people into the direction of putting solar on their homes in the event they have storm damages that totals out the roof and requires a new one. Doing it that way means that your 30% federal tax credit gets applied to the entire job. Storm damage events happen pretty regularly in Texas so many people have the ability to wait a year or two for hail to wreck their roof. Typically that is the time they upgrade from asphalt shingles to something like stone coated steel, or a polymer slate/wood shake, get the solar system installed, and get double the money back come tax season.
"

"So if your insurance company says it’s going to cost $30,000 to replace your roof and the solar system you’re wanting installed is an additional $30,000, your tax credit gets applied to both, so you get 30% back on $60,000 vs. $30,000 for only the solar system.""

"""TBH, it suggests we're going to see something suffering Aztec syndrome.""

"Blade runner spinners were friont bumper to roofline in the same angled wedge.  He was talking about something like that, not that 90s Dodge-Toyota looking render.""
"
"""I wouldn't. Have you seen [the teaser image](? It looks like it'll be the opposite of the soft, curvy Tesla sedans and be rugged but futuristic. Size and overall design is speculation but atleast we have the headlights and vague idea of the front end. From what I can gather:
"
"
"
"- Front end will be rectangular and sharp with a smooth surface rather than a grille similar to the Tesla X.
"
"
"
" Headlights will be like the Rivian but thinner and more like something from Cyberpunk 2077
"
"
"
" Size may be similar to a mid 90s C1500 with a slightly longer hood similar to a car from the 80s. Without a size comparison or measurements it is hard to know just how big everything is, but the long hood with an incline makes me think it's a mix of the 90s and 80s. If so then it will be smaller in height than a new pickup but longer and much more sleek than a giant brick with massive headlights.
"
"
"
"Edit: E for Electric has suggested the image is slightly off and that the """"hood"""" is actually a windshield starting at the headlights and ending over the front seat. Not sure if that's the case but I just wanted to throw that out there as another possibility. IMO, that would be too radical of a design but we'll have to wait and see.""
"
"""My version of this story: Upcoming Tesla pickup which has been described as blade runner-esque will be EVEN MORE blade runner-esque than wildly inaccurate fan rendering that is not remotely blade runner-esque, which Joe Rogan thought was real, despite bearing no resemblence to the only teaser Tesla actually has released.

" (FWIW if anybody cares-the Odyssey's adaptive makes you take over when you get down to around 20-25 mph.  Most of the bigger vehicles make you take over around the 15-25 mph range.  The full range adaptive vehicles like the Camry, Accord, Rogue, Subaru of course go to zero like the Tesla but they typically won't resume after zero without you pressing resume button or tapping the gas.  Also if anyone cares the \*quality of the adaptive and lane keep assist out of those vehicles by far Toyota is best (Camry even more than the Sienna since it's a newer version).  Toyota is pretty smooth, not as good as Tesla but very smooth.  Surprisingly Honda was a very distant last.  Their tech is absolutely awful.  I thought they'd be up there with Toyota.  They apparently use laser rather than radar/camera for adaptive and you can constantly feel is locking on and losing the car in front.  Also it hardly works if it's raining. )

"
"
"
"In the Olden Days, car distribution was hard, so manufacturers really did need third parties that understood their local markets to handle logistics and ordering, as well as to provide service, so the dealership concept was born. During the Great Depression, no one was buying cars, but because dealerships were divorced from car manufacturers, manufacturers decided they could keep forcing dealerships to buy anyways to keep sales and profit numbers up, by threatening not to sell to them in the future if they didn't buy now. Dealerships obviously couldn't deal with that, so they lobbied for protections from manufacturers, including a provision that manufacturers couldn't sell to anyone *besides* a dealership (to prevent them making good on their threats). And thus, dealership protection laws were born, and over time it's remained as it was thanks to a strong dealer lobby.""
"
"""The reason it exists is to prevent showrooming. Without the law you could go down to the local dealership, test drive some cars, talk with the sales staff, then go home and order a car direct from the manufacturer for far less since they don't have the overhead of running a dealership. Without the law nobody would ever have opened a dealership, so the manufacturers agreed to provide this protection. So it sort of makes sense, but it does not make sense to apply a poorly written law to a manufacturer with no dealerships.""
"
"""When you research you'll find that in the early days the manufacturers very much needed the dealerships in order to survive, but it seems that model has outgrown its usefulness at this point.""
"
"""> But now that I think about it, if I am a car manufacturer, why would I want these dishonest sleezeballs being the gatekeepers to the public of a product I've worked so hard on?
"
"
"
"Manufacturers created the franchise model to isolate themselves from recessions and logistics. That way they can focus on the cars. Not every dealership is sleazy. If Tesla went franchise it doesn't have to be slimey and dishonest, they can outline the terms very easily in their franchise agreement. You can keep the """"no haggle"""" pricing, you can keep the """"no bs"""" shtick they are known for. It would give them the benefit of minimizing their logistics, minimizing capital expenditure on facilities, and let them focus on building good cars. Franchises don't have to be a shit show. In fact, that vast majority of your luxury dealerships (I mean you consider Tesla luxury, right?) are not like that.""

"Same here.  I had absolutely no idea about this stuff until my recent Tesla experience.

He then gave me the 'scoop' on everything.  He thought the adaptive cruise was fine but he admitted he had never tried it in any other non-Honda vehicle. However he said the adaptive is terrible in the rain and constantly goes out.  That same uncle ended up buying an Accord from that guy.

You can turn on ACC from 0 (it auto sets to 25 mph if you’re below it) it’ll smoothly come to a full stop in traffic or at stop lights (if another car is in front). If it comes to complete stop for more than a couple seconds I need to press the cruise button again or tap the gas to get it going but it gives me a little beep when it thinks it can move. Usually in stop and go traffic the traffic moves even that I don’t need to hit the button often even if the car comes to a full stop.

They gave me an Accord (still a 2018 I believe) to drive for the day and I thought maybe my opinion would change about the adaptive since I was now so used to the Camry and so aware of its strengths and weaknesses.  It didn't.  I still hated the Accord's adaptive and it made me nauseous.

"""Another thing that's different (at least comparing to the non-Tesla vehicles I've driven) is the 'adaptive only' portion of my Model 3 does more than the adaptive portions of other cars regarding slowing down for curves (typically prior to the curve).  Again requires an explanation...
"
"
"
"&#x200B;
"
"
"
"If in my Camry I have adaptive cruise set at 60 mph and there's a sharp curve approaching the Camry will not slow down at all for the curve until you're actually strongly turning and it detects heavy turning of the wheel at too high of a speed.  There's some formula where when x degree of turn at x speed or more kicks in safety slow down  and the vehicle will slow down to whatever degree that formula dictates.
"
"
"
"&#x200B;
"
"
"
"Now the Tesla does that as well but does more.  Say the Tesla is in 'regular adaptive mode'(not AutoPilot) and is set at 60 mph and approaching the same sharp curve as the Camry above.  The Tesla will slow down prior to/entering that curve the same as it would if it were in AutoPilot (using the cameras and/or gps knowing there's a sharp curve coming.)  So it's basically AutoPilot but without the automatic steering.  This is really fun when you're in really windy mountain roads and you can steer and blaze through curves with minimal to no gassing or braking.  (This mechanism, like when in AutoPilot, is not perfect in really sharp curves but it's very good most of the time.)

"One of the issues is that driving a car, especially one that may be doing a lot to driving itself, is that sometimes, drivers of such cars are not paying as much attention to what is going on around them.

None of this happened on this video, however it may have been a factor prior to the mirror incident.

">the difference is however gasoline must reach a certain mixture with air and also be combusted in order to catch fire. gasoline by itself has no ability to ignite it must reach the correct circumstances. electricity on the other hand produces heat whenever it encounters resistance. if there was no resistance then the electricity would just flow through it such as electrocuting someone. but if there is resistance it begins to produce heat and will build it up until the flow stops. Which means that if an isolation issue occurs(very common) there is not only risk of electrocution but of a fire.

Because of how Galloway arrives at his predictions, he didn’t properly account for this (IMO).

"When you short a stock, you are basically saying  that you will sell stock that you don't own at today's price, and promise to return back the same amount of stock (shares, not dollars) at a future date (option expiry). You pay a fee to set up the option, and essentially borrow money to play in the market by selling stock that you don't own.
"
"
"
"So, if you say you are shorting TSLA say with an expiry 3 months down the road with a price of $200, and the stock is trading at $250, you are immediately getting access to $50 from thin air (i.e, borrowed money) for a fee (let's say around $5.00). If the stock falls below $200, then that $50 is yours to keep, since there's enough money to buy back that 1 share. Assuming interest for borrowing money is $5, you basically made $45 off a $5 fee. Basically made $40. That's a huge ROI in 3 months.
"
"
"
"On the flip side, if you are betting on such a short, and the stock jumps up to 300, now you have to return the $50 you initially got, pay interest on the $50 = $5, plus the additional $50 to cover purchasing the stock back. So, you basically lost $50 to cover + $5 + $5 fee. Essentially, you lost $60.

It's often linear and is probably resulting in 20% of Tesla's increase in automotive margins each quarter.

Also cyclists don't have very many blind spots and are traveling relatively slowly so can make judgments about if it's safe to proceed without stopping. There are some bad apples but they are few just like there are bad drivers. Most cyclist just want to get home to their families safely.

"""Well, there are not two categories of vehicles on the roads. You don't have to be a """"car"""" or a """"pedestrian."""" For example, many jurisdictions treat motorcycles differently than cars (allowing lane splitting, etc). Many have specific rules about what trucks can and cannot do. So there's no reason why there can't be a separate set of rules for cyclists. What needs to be clear, though, is who has the right of way in various conflicting encounters. As a cyclist, I think there's a two basic problems: 1) there is not sufficient traffic enforcement against drivers. 2) There aren't penalties (at least where I live) specific to cyclists. Applying the same penalty for someone driving a car, which is significantly more dangerous, doesn't make sense. As a result, there is not sufficient traffic enforcement against cyclists either. In other words, its just the wild west out there. Also, since there's little enforcement against drivers, the cyclists who are particularly active tend to skew more towards being assholes, since you need really thick skin (and a high risk tolerance) to ride a bike in most cities in the US. My solution is serious enforcement on everyone, but drivers (and their representatives, such as Mid-Atlantic AAA where I live) vehemently oppose that, even if it would mean that cyclists would be policed also. So, we get the status quo which I don't think is good for anyone.""

"""Re. F) In Norway there are rules about cyclists being part of traffic laws and which are part of the theoretical test curriculum. Not sure about the term “drivers manual”. You’ll typically buy a book that’s like 130-150 pages that’ll cover the rules of the road and necessary theory about vehicles. If you read the book and understand everything you should know how to theoretically act in any scenario. Since 2005 there’s also a mandatory class that you need to take before you are allowed to start practice driving with a parent/guardian or taking lessons with an instructor. Norwegian drivers ed is quite comprehensive these days and I think it’s nearly impossible to get a license for less than $2,500. In my opinion this is in part because driving schools have been part of the groups shaping the legislation and they’ve been making sure that there now is several mandatory levels that everyone need to go through in addition to the mandatory courses; long distance, overtaking, skid pad (winter/ice training), and night driving.

"""I could still gloat but I think the guy blocked me. His account is still around and he's active. Back in August of 2014 I made this prediction:
"
"
"
"> Barring stock splits, I predict that their stock value will still be at or above $250 in three years (August 2017)--if there is a stock split, then obviously that would have to be factored into its price. What do you predict?
"
"
"
"His prediction in reply was:
"
"
"
"> Within 5 years they will be gone.
"
"
"
"> Not hard to predict. Once there is saturation into the used market they are going to lose sales. Once they go beyond that golden number where the carbon credits keep them profitable then they go under water and there is no way back up. Insane maintenance costs to honor existing warranties will prevent anyone else from wanting to take over the company.

That and their huge amount of Capex to buy and build NUMMI and the Gigafactory; once all thats paid off you're looking at massive profitability.""

Tesla obviously offers very good value, but if I compare it with some other companies in the same neighborhood (in terms of share price and products/services offered), Tesla's share price just feels overinflated. Just my opinion.

"Smart money continues to be that Tesla is going to fail. But they continue to defy gravity and prove the smart money wrong.

"
"
"So many people don't understand that a company can be successful without necessarily being profitable in the beginning. It just means a company is leveraging capital for continued growth. That stage might go on for 1 year or it might go on for decades like Amazon. The point is that once they reach full maturity, they'll be raking in enormous profits and they spent all that early time laying the foundation for long-term success. That's why unprofitable companies sometimes have huge stock price growth long-term.""

"
"
"
"Of course, that's expected as Tesla is not a traditional car manufacturer. But since their revenue growth isn't any greater than Ford's right now, and their profit is significantly smaller, yet Tesla has a much larger market cap, there's no way you can say that Tesla is cheap.

A large portion of that time was spent in R&D phase, and another several years they were without any sort of mass-market vehicle. The Model 3, which is the first Tesla vehicle that has and will continue to lead them toward sustainable profit began shipping in the 2nd quarter of 2018, with full production only recently being achieved. Tesla is selling high-margin vehicles as quickly as they can manufacture them. The lack of consistent profit to this point is not an indicator of any sort of flaw or failure in their business.

Things aren't as rosy as they seem. If you ever get a chance to look at Tesla with a clear mind, maybe you will see how it's much worse than you imagine. The numbers don't lie, and this small profit on a single quarter doesn't really change anything.""

I just disagree with your perception that Tesla is in any sort of trouble or has flashed any indication whatsoever that it doesn't have a long-term future. I've spoken to others who have shared the same opinions as you, but in my experience the justification has been mostly hyperbolic similar to what you've shared here (no offense intended). I hear a lot of """"they have so many problems"""" and """"Musk always over-promises and under-delivers,"""" etc. At the end of the day, though, money talks. Tesla turned a profit this quarter, and I understand a lot of folks don't want to eat crow just yet, but only time will prove you right or wrong. 
"
"
"
"For what it's worth, I think the major piece you're missing here is how much the technology has changed since Tesla was founded and how much it continues to change. You keep saying a 16-year old company ought to have been profitable by now, but we're not talking about a department store, here, or a music streaming company. Tesla had to create a mass-market all-electric vehicle that people wanted to buy and that they could make high margins on. That's never been done before, especially not by a startup. 
"
"
"
"I'm not sure if you've driven or ridden in one of these cars, but I anticipate that the more of these Model 3's that get shipped across the world, the higher the demand will become. I live in a medium sized city that is 3+ hours away from the nearest Tesla store. In the two months since I have owned this car, I have gotten several people every week inquiring about it and/or wanting to drive it/ride in it. At least two have told me they definitely will purchase a Tesla when they are ready for a new vehicle (and both people have the means to do so).

"""I think the biggest evidence to support that there is actual legitimate concern for the future of the company is the financials. As I have already said, they are a 16 year old company who can't seem to make a stable profit. This small profit this one quarter barely made a dent in their losses for this year. An occasional one step forward means nothing when you go two steps back. Maybe Tesla will turn that around, personally I don't see it happening.

"I have actually ridden in model 3 a lot, a friend of mine bought one. He even let me drive it once. I would never buy it unless they made a lot of changes. I honestly hate the ipad on a stick interior, just too plain. I've seen how dangerous AP can be, and how you really need to pay attention and look out for potential issues so you can take over before that point. Luckily my friend was smart enough to look out for those spots and he took over before the problem arose. When I drove the car, AP decided to cancel a lane change mid change, while I was going like 85mph, I swear the front wheels lost traction for a little bit there as I fought against AP to finish the lane change.

"I am not convinced traditional advertising will help them that much, mainly because I don't think most of the population is ready to transition to an EV, and the price of a decent range Tesla is just way too expensive for the mass market.

"
"""Can you support your claim that """"there is a good chance they won't?"""" Because you haven't. 
"
"
"
"Your main beef is that Tesla has a $900 million loss on the year as of Q3. You've ignored the fact that they've turned a profit in 3 of the last 5 quarters, and that the majority of their losses in 2019 are attributable to Q1, and those losses can easily be explained by the fact that the company was struggling with logistics of getting the cars delivered to worldwide markets (particularly with the Model 3, which had 10,600 cars still in-transit for delivery at the end of the quarter) which has clearly been improved when you look at delivery numbers in Q2 and Q3. 
"
"
"
"Go look at it for yourself. Form 8-K that was filed 10/23, pages 7 and 9. Model S/X deliveries dropped from 27,607 in Q4 2018 to just 12,091 Q1 2019 (since having rebounded to 17,483 in Q3 2019). Model 3 deliveries dropped from 63,359 to just 50,928 while rebounding to 77,634 in Q2 and 79,703 in Q3. In Q1 their global inventory (days of sales) was 30, whereas it stood in Q3 at 17. Nearly half. 
"
"
"
"We'll ignore the fact that they've increased store and service locations by 18% YOY and mobile service fleet 93% YOY, or 32% more supercharger connectors YOY. We'll also ignore the 150,000 annual capacity that's awaiting approval for production in Shanghai that will drastically reduce cost and increase deliveries in Asia or the fact that they've got several other upcoming production facilities listed on page 10. 
"
"
"
"Let us also ignore the $178 million in operating expenses that have been cut YOY while delivering 13,400 more vehicles than a year ago. Or the fact that automotive gross profit hit 22.8% this quarter, within spitting distance of the 25% that most analysts have been hoping they would hit by... I believe 2024.... in order to have long-term success.

"

"Can you open up their 8-k and point me to something in support of your contentions?""
"
"""I think the fact that they are a 16 year old company who has constantly lost money even after they promised all profits going forward is good evidence to suggest they won't make it. A company can't stay alive forever constantly losing money.
"
"
"
"I'm not ignoring the fact that they've turned a profit in 3 of the last 5 quarters at at all, but since you brought it up let's look at the data from these last 5 quarters. Those 3 profits were so small and 2 losses so big that they lost money (surprise surprise). In the 3 profit quarters they made about 593M, in the two quarters they lost money the lost about 1.11B. Thats a $517M loss over the last 5 quarters. Again, its 1 step forward two steps back, which isn't good.
"

"
"Increased locations means increased cost, something Tesla seems to be struggling with. Also, the China prices were just announced, they cost more than US cars! There is also much more competition in China, and Tesla's make less sense over in Europe because of the smaller roads and typically shorter distances travelled.
"
"
"
"Again, Tesla has reduced costs for a single quarter before when they wanted to show profit. This could be exactly the same tactic we have seen them do before; reduce costs to an unsustainable level for one quarter to show a profit, and go right back to losing money the next. Only time will tell.
"
"
"
"Part (or all) of the increased gross profit margin was due to realizing years worth of smart summon/FSD orders in a single quarter. That is a temporary boost to margins that is not sustainable. That is why it magically jumped 4% this quarter. They have more unrealized money there, so they will surely use this tactic to their advantage until that pool runs dry.

"
"
"
"You're also correct that realizing some of the reserved FSD revenue due to Smart Summon is a temporary boost, but it also means that they can now recognize more of the $7,000 FSD purchases on an ongoing basis. I believe that would show up under the gross auto margin, which as I said before is an important number. 
"

"
"While Musk's claims are always to be taken with a huge grain of salt, his claim that FSD is going to hit the EAP users late this year (which is within 65 days of today, so not a far off projection) with hands-off ability being released next year would allow for another enormous boost in GAAP revenue recognition.

"""No, before V.10 it drives betwen the line right in the middle and it is predictable.    A motorist comig up can judge properly.  Sure, you are not gonna get the little wave for making extra room, but it is consistent and stable.  After V.10, AP will now move about between the line base on condition of the car/truck/18wheerler next to you.  A bike will split lane often between the innermost and 2nd lane from inside. If you drive on the 2nd from inside (which is where I like it since it is generally fast and you dont have to change lane wiht AP, so simple lane keep/TACC), you have line splitter on your left and 18 wheeler on yoru right.  so as you move about from passing 1 18 wheeler to another, your car will go from center of lane to left of the lane and back, this make it hard for a lane splitter to judge as it can appear that you are moving left to block them because AP see the 18wheeler easily, but not the bike a way back moving faster than traffic.  This is dangerous.  I am hopeful that if the timing is really wrong, basic avoidance will still stop the car from moving left into a moving bike, never the less, the appearance is your Tesla is moving to the left seemingly to blcok the bike if not purposely swing left at the last second to cause them harm.

"
"""I did plasti dip, reasons: very low cost, easy to apply and remove at home. It only lasts two years or so but for the price and ease who cares? Vinyl wraps will last 5 years or so but at that point will be very difficult to remove. And all in plasti dip cost $50 bucks with supplies. It’s a no brainer if you have a garage and patience.""

"I’d say 6 years. Longer if the robotaxi becomes a thing. But I don’t think longer range model 3’s will be coming for a while. But Elon’s said 1 million mile batteries are on the horizon. But that will be a swappable pack. I feel like the car is future proof.

"If I had returned it I'd still be paying for a car I don't have until they refund my money to me and the bank. I'd also not have a car because I did trade-in. And I'd also have to wait even longer for my dream car. I'd say it's worth it but I've been such a longtime Tesla follower and I was hoping for a better Tesla experience. Right now it's more of a privilege to give them my money for the car.

"""I did mine all satin so the handle pops out a bit from the body and match the other chrome deleted parts. However, I’m sure it will look good with a glossy black too. And if you don’t like it, you can always peel it off and buy the door handle parts and re do it. The door is very easy to do.""

"
"Yeah you get all 4 but I’ve been hearing for all of them the back sits slightly lower than the front..
"
"Does it look larger? maybe because it's brighter as I lit it with flash and the contrast shows less of the tires? lol I like the Aero Cap as well but looks definitely sportier with out it but adds a bit more wind noise. enjoy~
"
"""Plastidip~! I think it's the best solution. To be honest, I didn't go black on it I got anthracite grey which gives a bit contrast instead of the logo almost disappearing into the car. Very easy to use and you get no thin edges on the emblem~

"The irony of this is fantastic. People key Teslas because of their owners’ supposed I-think-I’m-better-than-you moral superiority (conservatives are super sensitive about this). Then the act of getting keyed causes said owners to react by saying “guess they were jealous”.

"I propose that the friction between these groups contributes to animosity towards Tesla, and sometimes manifests itself in aggression (“rolling coal”, keying cars, ICEing supercharger spots, etc.).

"CA = California or Canada?   I'm in Arizona and we are definitely not as liberal and open minded as California.   I always park away from the crowds.  I abhor when people allow their shopping carts or car doors to hit another car.  It's easily preventable if you take precautions and treat others property with respect.
