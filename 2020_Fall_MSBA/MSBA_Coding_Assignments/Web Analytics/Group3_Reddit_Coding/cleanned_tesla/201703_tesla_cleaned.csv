"""If I'm not mistaken, isn't that how electric vehicles work?""
"
"I did a shorter version of the same thing (Miami to NYC) last month. It's all about [the efficiency of your driving]( and keeping an eye on nearby superchargers at outset. I can post further details of how I did my research if anyone is interested.
"
"How many times did you have to recharge?
"
"But can a tesla even use a drop of gas?
"
"""Blade Runner-like photo! Only more optimistic, with electric mobility and not some still smoke-engulfed cites because of ICEs...""
"
"And now back?
"
"""Okay so I'm trying to do the math. Any bros feel free to help if I've fucked up anywhere. 
"
"
"
"First off, definitions for the uninitiated. CO2e means """"carbon dioxide equivalent"""" and is used to standardise emissions calculations. For instance, methane is 21x more potent than co2, so the math can get pretty tricky when you're trying to work out exactly how much a  certain thing (e.g. fuel which emits many different greenhouse gasses) actually pollutes the environment. Converting them all to a single unit is seriously helpful. One unit of methane = 21 units of CO2e.
"
"
"
"Now on to the actual math.
"
"Using google, I found a resource that told me for 100km (~62 miles, sorry americans), a tesla (model S i think?) will use 18kWh. Electricity from the grid in my state has an emissions factor of 0.79,  which means it produces 0.79kg (1.74lb) of CO2e per kWh. 
"
"**Therefore, driving a tesla model S for 100km emits 0.01422 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.**
"
"
"
"**Using regular gasoline, the calculation is a bit more complex but I ended up with a figure of 0.01671 tonnes CO2e when assuming a car uses 7 litres (1.8492 gallons) per 100km.**
"
"
"
"tl;dr these calculations show Tesla Model S emits ~85.1% what a regular car would, reducing emissions by 14.9%.
"
"
"
"Depending on your expectations, this may or may not be a surprise for you. 
"
"There are some issues, most likely associated with the fuel efficiency of a gasoline car, as well as the kWh usage for the tesla. Also, CO2e emissions from grid electricity vary greatly, even from state to state here in Australia. It would undoubtedly be as variant or more in other countries.
"
"
"
"Didn't plan this comment out at all. Willing to elaborate on any points etc if people are interested.
"
"
"
"EDIT: Seems a lot of people are misinterpreting me. I'm definitely not being critical in any way, of electric cars. I was just interested to see, based on some ballpark figures I could easily grab, what the comparison would be basically between my current car and a Model S in my home state. As a lot of people have pointed out, the electricity grid most likely has a far greater capacity to reduce its emissions intensity/increase its efficiency, compared to combustion engine technology for diesel or gasoline. ""
"
"""The future is here, glad to see that there are super charging stations all over the place, definitely want to own a Tesla some day""
"
"Congratulations. Looking forward to your detailed report! :D
"
"""I am really surprised by their batteries. So big distance, cool guys!""
"
"The only reason I want a house is so I can own a Tesla. 
"
"Wish I could afford a Tesla. It's my goal car. maybe before I'm 70.

"Awesome!
"
"Cool! 
"
"Hell ya! What percentage of your trip were you using Autopilot?
"
"I'm staying in Times Square this week! When do you head back? I'd love to meet up and check out your X and talk about your trip!
"
"How long did it take? 
"
"I've done that trip myself in a P85D absolutely amazing. It's nice that their are multiple routes available now
"
"Actually you did. Most of our electricity comes from coal and natural gas right? Or no? 
"
"Amazing. I plan on doing something similar in the near future. 
"
"""Congratulation! Haters going to hate. Title could use work , but hope the trip was great! I'm getting a car as I type this and maaaan do I wish I was a tesla but that never be within my ability to purchase ""
"
"This sounds like my dream.
"
"""I've become a fast fan of the Model X.  It took a test drive to sell me.
"
"
"
"I want one some day.  And I will have it.""
"
"How long did it take and what was the average speed when driving? 
"
"""Wow some idiots in the comments, its a nice trip and i love the photo. Good to see the supercharger network is placed as needed to make it possible. ""
"
"""I want to know how long it took, how many times you had to stop to recharge, and how long it takes to recharge.   
"
"
"
"Edit: the numbers
"
"
"
"On a full charge, the Model X can average around ~250 miles on electric only.  It's 2900 miles from San Francisco to NYC.  So OP would have to stop to charge 12 times.  If OP had super charge stations along the entire drive, Tesla says that you can get 170 miles with a 30 minute super charge, so let's say an hour for a full charge.  This means that OP would spend a minimum of 12 hours of his trip just recharging. If OP didn't have any quick charge stations, it would take 5 hours of charging through a plain old outlet.  Now the time spent recharging would be 60 hours!  
"
"
"
"Using Google's estimate of the amount of time it would take for the drive of 43 hours, add the minimum 12 hours of charging, and it would have taken a minimum of 55 hours of being on the road.  On the slow side of things, it would have taken OP 103 hours!
"
"
"
"Now let's compare to a regular gasoline car. Let's use a typica, base Honda Civic that costs $20,000 and gets 42 mpg on the highway.  If we get the EPA estimated 42 mpg, we would burn through just over 69 gallons of gasoline.  The Civic has a 12.4 gallon tank.  This equates to us having to stop only 6 times to refuel (half the number of the Tesla).  Let's average a refuel time for a 12.4 gallon tank to 10 minutes.  The total time spent refueling would only be one hour for the civic.  Meaning you could get to NY 11 hours earlier at minimum. 
"
"
"
"Factoring in the time savings from not having to recharge, the Civic costing $65,000 LESS, being able to refuel anywhere, and having a long range, it's no wonder than the internal combustion engine car is hard to beat. 
"
"
"
"Edit: I know I didn't factor in rest stops and sleep.  It varies by person on how much they can/want to drive. ""

From a quick look Gulf Power has a program called Energy Select that gives you time of use pricing.    Most people charge their electric cars in the middle of the night and that is usually when electricity will be the cheapest.  So if you get an EV and apply for this program your cost to charge the car would be quite a bit lower.   It looks like the low rate is 7.8 cents per kWh.   So this could lower your cost per mile quite a bit.

"Some updates: last year the Greenbushes operation alone produced 65,000 t of LCE (Lithium carbonate equivalent) which was about 1/3rd of global supply.
"
"
"
"Already this year, 2 new mines have opened in Australia - Mt Cattlin ~30,000 t LCE and Mt Marion ~50,000 t LCE. 
"
"
"
"So """"currently"""" most lithium supply globally is from Australian hard rock.
"
"
"
"By the end of 2017, two more mines will be producing, Bald Hill ~30,000 t LCE, and Earl Grey 50-60,000 t LCE.
"
"
"
"In early 2018 there are 3 more (Pilgangoora, Pilgangoora East and Wodgina) with another ~100,000 t LCE. Also in 2018, Greenbushes is to double is production to 130,000 t LCE with a new LiOH refinery built in Australia.
"
"
"
"From a global production of 180,000 t in 2016 to an Australian only production of ~400,000 t in 2019.
"
"
"
"Here's the thing. That link you provided missed a few things. 
"
"
"
"1. Hard rock mines require very low capital expenditure. Brine operations are very high capital expenditure.
"
"2. Hard rock mines are very fast to production. Brine operations, after a very long construction period require 2 years of evaporation before any production can actually commence.
"
"3. The costs is cites only includes the operating cost (waiting for the sun to do its work) and ignores the capital cost, and the accumulated interest on that capital.
"
"4. If a hard rock and brine operation were both to commence construction today, the hard rock would have moved into positive Net Present Value before the brine operation has even finished evaporating.
"
"5. The metallurgy they cite for processing spodumene is dated. Different hydrometallurgy and electrolysis methods have been developed. It is only old refineries that use the method they cite.
"
"
"
"In addition: previously, lithium containing minerals like mica were uneconomic due to the nature of the silicates. New hydrometallurgy has been developed that means they are now economic. And by economic, I mean the *byproduct production pays for the whole process and the LiCO3 is produced essentially for free*. Previously, mica was separated out and sent to tails dams. All these tails dams are now economic to reprocess, and the LCE production will be cost free due to tin, tantalum, cesium, rubidium and fertiliser byproducts.

"""A typical air conditioner is what's called a """"heat pump."""" It does what the name says: it pumps heat from one location to another.
"
"
"
"Imagine a situation where it's hot inside and cold outside, and you want to cool the inside without opening a window. You could set up a pipe containing some sort of fluid and circulate it around. When it passes through the inside, the fluid would heat up, absorbing some of the heat from the inside. When it goes outside, the fluid would cool off, passing the heat to the outside. You spend no energy other than what it takes to move the fluid.
"
"
"
"Of course, this simple approach stops working when the outside is warmer than the inside, but you can get fancier. Instead of just circulating the fluid, you compress it as you move it outside, and expand it as you move it inside. When you compress a fluid, it gets hotter. You raise its temperature above the outside temperature, which allows it to cool off and pass heat to the outside. Then when you expand a fluid, it gets colder. This cools it off below the inside temperature and allows it to absorb heat from the interior.
"
"
"
"Usually the fluid is chosen to be something that can be compressed into a liquid and expanded into a gas, as the phase change absorbs *much* more heat.
"
"
"
"So basically, the AC cycle looks like:
"
"
"
"1. Cold gas in a pipe absorbs heat and cools the interior.
"
"2. Compress that gas and make it hot.
"
"3. Move the hot gas outside. Cool it with outside air until it condenses into a liquid.
"
"4. Expand the liquid and move it back inside. This makes it into a cold gas.
"
"5. Go to step 1.
"
"
"
"Note that you can swap inside and outside to get a heat pump that warms the interior rather than cooling it. This is the sort of device they're talking about if you see a """"heat pump"""" mentioned in a hardware store. This can give you more efficient heating too.
"
"
"
"As far as efficiency goes, the only energy you have to put into this process comes in step 2. As long as the difference between the inside and outside temperatures isn't too large (and the ~40F difference you might have on a really hot day isn't all that large for this) then the energy needed to compress the gas can be much smaller than the amount of heat being moved outside by the system as a whole.

"No it can directly drive the wheels by attaching itself to the ring gear through a series of hydraulic clutches.

If more power is needed then the motor and the engine can be directly coupled through the ring and planetary gears.

"""You literally did accuse that: """"So you're sneaking up to houses and businesses and stealing their electricity?"""" I proved you wrong because 120v outlets are everywhere. And 120v is if you're overnight somewhere and have no l2 or higher charging. It's a last resort, but to agree that there are more gas stations than there are outlets is wrong, and then to accuse me of going around and stealing a few cents of electricity is also stupid.""

"""I mean I'm sure you'd get the odd person that says no, but If you show up in a Tesla, and explain the situation, I find it hard to think someone would care about a few cents of electricity. And it's not like you'd be there for super long, just enough to get you to the next L2 or supercharger.""

"""Him being arrested is probably an American thing, he would probably just have been fined in The Netherlands as well. But I just wanted to point out that it should definitely be treated as theft, even though it's just 5 cents worth of electricity.""

"""Nope. And no hope for having one built, either. Local HOA wouldn't allow for it. Sucks.""

"""I honestly don't think it's a big deal, if it was something he was doing on a continuous basis fine, but once while waiting for his kid, I don't think so.""

"""Who said free? Do you go to a gas station and get free gas? I said there are more outlets than gas stations. Period, and that's a fact. Stop trying to twist the argument so you can come out right. And I'm sure if you ask politely no business or even someone at their house would say no to a few cents of electricity if you're in a bind. Hell that's why lots of businesses install L2 charging, which draws way more electricity and costs much more than a 120v is to bring in electric drivers. You have no idea what you're talking about.""
"
"""Again, you're trying to twist the argument into something different. The argument was there are more outlets than gas stations. End of story. You're wrong. Grow up and accept it.

"Now to address your stupid comment Any business or person would be glad to have a Tesla charge at their place. Everyone that sees my car always is super interested and wants to know more, so If I tell them, hey do you mind if I charge here, they would probably say Yes. That's why people put their L2 chargers on Plugshare. The entire premise of Plugshare disputes your dumb comments. Especially since most businesses don't even pay electricity as it's bundled into their lease. Might want to know your shit before just flailing your fingers on the keyboard. H=""

"""That's funny, have you tried, or are you making assumptions? Because most businesses don't even pay their electricity, so the 30 cents you use if you ask them, they won't care. And businesses set up L2 chargers to attract people and they are free, so L1 charging isn't something they'd say no to.""
