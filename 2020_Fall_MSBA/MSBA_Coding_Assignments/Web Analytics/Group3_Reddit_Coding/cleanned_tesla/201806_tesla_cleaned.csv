I love Tesla to death, but I'm fully aware that the *only* reason it hasn't died *several* times now is because Elon either bailed it out with his own money, his ability to raise capital (because it's Elon), or his refusal to stop working until things improve.  The list of would-be electric car companies is loooong, and includes the likes of Fisker and Faraday Future.  Tesla is definitely the exception, and not the rule.

"""And yet other countries that don’t have anywhere near the level of ag subsidies we do don’t seem to have this problem. Hm.

"Currently we spend billions (trillions?) subsidizing corn (which is a mostly useless crop that is actually harmful when processed into HFCS), and many more billions paying farmers to not farm so as to keep grocery prices artificially high. I’m not sure how removing such inefficient subsidies will be harmful to the consumer. ""
"
"""And private investors, who actually have an incentive to pick the most promising technologies, should be the ones to fill that gap. You have to look at the incentives: the government has an incentive to cater to whoever can best line its employees’ pockets in the short term, regardless of what may happen in the long term, because ultimately the players are not spending their own money, thus creating a moral hazard. But a private individual who *is* spending his own money has an incentive to increase his own wealth as much as possible in the long term, in accordance with his tolerance for risk. 
"
"
"
"So in light of this, the best option is for the government to stay out of the business of picking winners and losers, and rather stick to the goal of creating a level playing field for all parties. That way there’s no clashing incentives. ""
"
"""But you’re not seeing the full picture. Let’s say we throw all our weight behind EVs, but there’s a better technology out there. Then what? First of all it may not even be developed, since there’s no incentive to develop it next to artificially cheap EV prices (as was the case with earlier EVs; electric has been a viable technology since before the 80s, but wasn’t economically viable until recently thanks to oil and gas subsidies). And even if it is developed, it may not be able to compete for the same reason, which is a shame because if it truly is a better technology, it should be able to stand on its own. Providing subsidies is also a good way to pick accidental losers while stalling progress on winners. Look at the Bush-era subsidies for hydrogen, and how far that got us. All it did was postpone development on battery-operated wall-charged EVs, which are the more viable technology (at least at the time, up through now).

I'd rather all technologies stand on their own, on a government-leveled playing field, and private investors can research and support the technologies that seem most promising as their incentives are better aligned than the government's.""

I mean if (for a simple example) a gas car costs $15000 to produce and an electric car costs $20000, then assuming the same supply and demand elasticities for both products, there is a subsidy amount somewhere a bit north of $5k that, when applied to electric cars, would have the same effect of the same dollar amount being applied to gas cars, but as a tax.

The most likely scenario in AP vehicle recognition today is that it’s primarily, if not solely, based on the front radar. In these circumstances, AP just knows there is a vehicle in front and to sit the designated distance behind it.  All vehicles in front are now shown on IC and rendered as cars, most likely because vision isn’t being used in the production code to identify that a vehicle is there and radar cannot differentiate [accurately or at all]. We can expect this to change at some point of course. The implied suggestion here is that AP1 with MobileEye differentiated. We know that MobileEye computer vision was used more in AP1 generally and would have to have been used for vehicle differentiation.

Just imagine when cars start having instant communication between each other! At any intersection all cameras involved could tell a car crossing a green light that there's a car not stopping at red. Even if it doesn't stop the wrecks, the algorithms will think waaaay faster than a human reaction. It could learn to make an inevitable crash a small crash vs a fatal crash.

They also tend to be of a much larger displacement to get the same power, and also they have a lower RPM range as well. For example, that bike has twin cylinder 1170cc boxer layout with a 8500rpm redline to produce 110hp. My liquid cooled bike is 937cc  90 degree L-twin and a 10500 max rpm making 113hp. Though it should be noted that the air cooled bike from that example isn't a true air cooled design, it is using oil cooling for some effect while still maintaining air cooled sound.
"

"So the general characteristic sound of a liquid cooled bike it a much smoother sound, they sound a bit more muffled, some of them sound quite a bit like sewing machines at idle (mine idles at around 1000rpm once it's warmed up). Maybe the water jacket muffles and distorts things a bit?

The AZ trip made me add water injection, too - it didn't mind 20psi boost in spite of all the heat... I hacked on the megasquirt firmware for it for a long time, too. There was nothing wrong with it. Everything worked great. I just didn't want to work on it anymore I guess. I put in a lot of hours into it, starting with not knowing anything about cars, other than general engineering knowledge.

"Actually keeping my eye out for the same thing. I’m really curious what the used Tesla market is gonna do over the next 3 years. The loss of the tax credit might inflate used prices while competition might help bring them down. Also the Model 3 becoming common place might reduce the perceived value of a Tesla. Also electric cars age differently from ICE so the used market might behave differently than what we’re used to.

You're basically looking at people in financial services, doctors, that sort of thing, people earning well into 6 figures. I'm really pushing my limits even considering a Model 3 but it will be half the price of the Model S so will be the most expensive car I've ever bought but with running costs over a period of 10 years it should even out at about what I would pay to run an ICEV for the same period.""

"""No the values will only increase.  Your thought process is wrong and only supports your desire to get a used tesla on the cheap - not happening!  ICE vehicles will drop quicker than usual, evs will hold up and high quality ones like Tesla will barely drop.  Its already happened with the S, X will holdup even better.  Teslas cost a lot bc they are the best by far, prices wont suddenly drop iust bc you want them to.  Tax credit doesnt matter, thats already the case for used Ss so what are you talking about?  The X will have free supercharging & EAP most likely, so value will stay high with updates.

Tesla on the other hand makes the car better with each software update. I'll give them some slack and see how the service is. Compared with how much my BMW MINI costs me every time something goes wrong I don't think Tesla's costs are outrageous and they've specifically said that they don't consider servicing to be a profit making operation whereas other car company's dealers will do everything they can to bump the price up so they can make more green.""

"
">I was dismayed to learn this weekend about a Tesla employee who had conducted quite extensive and damaging sabotage to our operations. This included making direct code changes to the Tesla Manufacturing Operating System under false usernames and exporting large amounts of highly sensitive Tesla data to unknown third parties.
"
">
"
">The full extent of his actions are not yet clear, but what he has admitted to so far is pretty bad. His stated motivation is that he wanted a promotion that he did not receive. In light of these actions, not promoting him was definitely the right move.
"
">
"
">However, there may be considerably more to this situation than meets the eye, so the investigation will continue in depth this week. We need to figure out if he was acting alone or with others at Tesla and if he was working with any outside organizations.
"
">
"
">As you know, there are a long list of organizations that want Tesla to die. These include Wall Street short-sellers, who have already lost billions of dollars and stand to lose a lot more. Then there are the oil & gas companies, the wealthiest industry in the world — they don't love the idea of Tesla advancing the progress of solar power & electric cars. Don't want to blow your mind, but rumor has it that those companies are sometimes not super nice. Then there are the multitude of big gas/diesel car company competitors. If they're willing to cheat so much about emissions, maybe they're willing to cheat in other ways?
"
">
"
">Most of the time, when there is theft of goods, leaking of confidential information, dereliction of duty or outright sabotage, the reason really is something simple like wanting to get back at someone within the company or at the company as a whole. Occasionally, it is much more serious.
"
">
"
">Please be extremely vigilant, particularly over the next few weeks as we ramp up the production rate to 5k/week. This is when outside forces have the strongest motivation to stop us.
"
">
"
">If you know of, see or suspect anything suspicious, please send a note to *******@tesla.com with as much info as possible. This can be done in your name, which will be kept confidential, or completely anonymously.
"
">
"
">Looking forward to having a great week with you as we charge up the super exciting ramp to 5000 Model 3 cars per week!
"
">
"
">Will follow this up with emails every few days describing the progress and challenges of the Model 3 ramp.

">Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful,

"""First thing they teach you about incident response and handling is that you only involve the authorities when need be. Gather evidence first. This is first and foremost an internal company matter. If Tesla decides to press charges, then they can involve law enforcement. The incident response team would need to determine if contacting law enforcement is necessary. The investigation most likely would also be handled internally, by qualified and expert incident handlers to prepare evidence for court. 
"
"
"
"NIST has this recommendation:
"
"
"
"One reason that many security-related incidents do not result in convictions is that some organizations do not properly contact law enforcement. Several levels of law enforcement are available to investigate incidents: for example, within the United States, Federal investigatory agencies (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] and the U.S. Secret Service), district attorney offices, state law enforcement, and local (e.g., county) law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies in other countries may also be involved, such as for attacks launched from or directed at locations outside the US. In addition, agencies have an Office of Inspector General (OIG) for investigation of violation of the law within each agency. **The incident response team should become acquainted with its various law enforcement representatives before an incident occurs to discuss conditions under which incidents should be reported to them, how the reporting should be performed, what evidence should be collected, and how it should be collected.**
"
"
"
"**Law enforcement should be contacted through designated individuals in a manner consistent with the requirements of the law and the organization’s procedures. Many organizations prefer to appoint one incident response team member as the primary POC with law enforcement. This person should be familiar with the reporting procedures for all relevant law enforcement agencies and well prepared to recommend which agency, if any, should be contacted. ** Note that the organization typically should not contact multiple agencies because doing so might result in jurisdictional conflicts. The incident response team should understand what the potential jurisdictional issues are (e.g., physical location—an organization based in one state has a server located in a second state attacked from a system in a third state, being used remotely by an attacker in a fourth state).

"

"
"* Start by splitting the company 50/50 into A and B branches.  
"
"

"* If one variant of the email leaks, put all everyone from the non-leaked variant in the C branch, and split the others equally into A and B.  If both branches leak, re-split the A and B groups and repeat the step above.

"Any retail manager would send cashiers to the floor to help tidy up the store and put things back, but under a union those cashiers can't. It's not their job to do that. So, those cashiers would have to sit on their hands while they wait for a customer to come through their line.

"So, it's not that he poured a pint on a tour, it's that growing and sorting hops are other jobs. Which, under a union, would (likely) need 2 other employees to do. Which is what argues\_to\_much was saying. Rev-777 sounds like a union worker because he didn't grow and sort hops on the tour, that would have been another tours experience.""

"""Reading this sub it would not surprise me if even the email people are backlogged and overworked, hehe.""
"
"""yeah, figured as much. I mean, it's still a kick ass thing to be able to do. ""

"""and they made _me_ pay for it!

"""Worked for two different unions in Canadoot.  This is absolutely not true.  We trade jobs all day long to reduce fatigue we also leave our job to help each other out if someone is behind.  However, if management tried to make someone with a bid go and do something else they have the right to go tell them to fuck off.  Even then everyone will just listen to management if their request is reasonable.  Don’t know where this lazy union workers myth comes from.  We work hard as fuck and are pretty flexible in getting the job done.""
"
"""Yeah, probably. Maybe the email people even have to work shifts on assembly ;)""
"
"""People just hating on unions, anti capitalist union pigs /s""
"
"""Canadian union worker here. I agree. Our union works really well with management, and there is a really high standard of work getting done. Perhaps it’s more of a US union stereotype, I don’t know. ""
"
"""Good to know! It’s what I was always told about unions and the comments above that I referenced reinforced my understanding. 
"
"
"
"I’ve never worked in a union but I’ll definitely look into it now that I’ve been informed that isn’t how they work. Could it be that some unions are more lax than others in this?""
"
"""Also Canadian union worker, ironically. Our union also works really well with management, and there is also a very high standard.
"
"
"
"US union stereotype, indeed?""
"
"Absolutely. I once worked on a software project for USPS for their point of sale terminals. I implemented a feature that would use the receipt printer to print the return address on a form (the data was in the system) to speed up the time spent at the counter. The postal union filed a grievance against the feature because filling out that form was not the postal worker’s job - it was the customer’s job to hand write the return address even though the system could do it with one click in under a second. Never mind the legibility of the return address (reducing lost mail) and the speed of the transaction were significantly improved. Logic prevailed and the grievance was overturned - but you see the mindset.
"
"""Possibly.

"
"My profession absolutely requires a union to represent our group, otherwise the company would run amuck. Fact.""
