"There are electrically driven flywheels that do nothing but condition power. On one side, the city power run a motor to spin a shaft with a weight, which is also directly attached to a generator. 
"
"
"
"In normal use, the flywheel spins at a constant speed, and the motor draws power to keep it there. The building (skyscraper) has its load on the generator, which adds magnetic friction to the system as it powers the building. 
"
"
"
"A lot of work and expense, plus ~10% increase in energy usage. Why? The flywheel spins constantly, as efficient as can be (literally, 10% ain‚Äôt cheap), which generates power without as much noise or ripples as the mains. It also handles brownouts and even short outages cleanly, transparently. 
"

"For business, hospitals, data centers where power spikes or drops and brown/blackouts can have significant cost, they pay for the assurances it can provide. But it‚Äôs never free. ""
"
"""You seem to be a little confused on how a generator works.
"
"
"
"It's not simply the rotation that generates the electrical current. The generator extracts energy from the driveshaft, reducing its speed. It magnetically drags on the shaft, that energy that it leeches away is what generates the current.
"
"
"
"Your scenario where you amplify the RPM is a red herring. What you're pulling from the driveshaft is kinetic energy, not RPM's. So when you use a transfer case to boost your RPM you've simultaneously decreased the torque (thus maintaining the total amount of energy available, minus losses to things like friction).
"
"
"
"Any time you have a thought like this all you have to do to check it is look at the laws of thermodynamics. Here we're interested in conservation of energy, that """"energy can neither be created nor destroyed; energy can only be transferred or changed from one form to another"""".

I also want to add that there's no reason to assume I'm referring to it's competitors because unlike you I'm not fighting for a brand. So among ALL cars I believe that a 4 door hatchback that weighs 2.5 tons, has worse lateral acceleration that an s class, (from your comment) very active traction control that can't be defeated, and can't be tracked due to it being prone to overheating itsnt *really* sporty.

"
"
"
"- Tesla delivered 286,000 cars by 2017 December 31, according to their Q4 statement
"
"- Tesla manufactured 300,000 cars by 2018 January 23, according to the proxy statement in Elon's proposed compensation plan.
"
"- Excluding inventory effects this gives an estimated total manufacturing rate of  14,000 cars over these 3 weeks, or ~4,650/week.
"
"- Projecting Q4 existing Model S/X/R/3 manufacturing rates gives a year-end manufacturing rate of about ~30,000/quarter, or ~2,500/week
"
"
"
"Assuming that the Tesla S/X/R manufacturing has not changed significantly over the first 3 weeks of 2018, this suggests a Model 3 manufacturing rate of about 2,150/week, for the first 3 weeks of 2018.
"
"
"
"Further assuming that on such a short 6 weeks timescale the increase in manufacturing can be approximated linearly, **Model 3 manufacturing rate could have possibly increased from about 1,000/week at the end of 2017 to 2,150/week as of 2018 January 23**.
"
"
"
"Caveats:
"
"
"
"- These numbers are necessarily estimates, and they are noisy as well
"
"- The inventory effect is unknown, but if Tesla has an inventory of 1,000 manufactured but not yet delivered cars it would reduce the current Model 3 manufacturing rate by about 7%, from 2,150/week to 2,000/week. If the inventory at the end of 2017 was smaller or larger then this then this reduction is smaller or larger. Arguably year end inventory tends to be lower at the end of quarters.
"
"- Beyond the noisiness of the data and the inventory effect I could also be wrong in any of these estimates, as I already was inaccurate in the first version of this post.

"
"Very strange to put 3s on a ship unless going to Asia. It would be way too cost prohibitive to sail through the Panama canal to a destination on the East Coast or Europe. My guess is they are just using the lot for storage. 
"
"""No idea where the 3s are going. But the San Francisco port would imply they are going to Asia. Which confuses me, because I wouldn't think any 3s are going to Asia at this point. But I also don't think Tesla is planning any Canadian deliveries yet, so your guess is as good as mine.
"
"
"
"What I can tell you for sure is it's much cheaper/quicker to send cars to Canada via train/truck.""
"
"""Yes.  Put it this way, if Amazon increased their profits by 30% per year for each of the next 10 years (even starting using this year's profit, which was hugely inflated by a one time tax benefit), they would make less profit in 2028 than Apple made in 2014.  At the start of 2015 (when its 2014 results were released), Apple was valued at ~$625 billion.  Amazon is valued at ~$725 billion today.  So Amazon's valuation today basically assumes greater than 30% compounded profit growth for the next decade, even with no discounting due to the time value of money.  
"
"
"
"Now, what would that 30% annual growth look like?  Well, if we assume that their profit margin does not improve, that would mean that their revenue would also have to increase 30% annually.  Of course, that would result in annual revenue of over $2.3 trillion, or almost the current GDP of the United Kingdom.  That does not seem plausible.  Alternatively, Amazon could try increasing their margins.  Now, this would be possible if they stopped investing their profits in new growth ventures.  But there are a number of issues they face in increasing margins significantly.  First, their customers are price sensitive.  People buy stuff on Amazon because it is cheap.  If Walmart sells something for less money people will buy it at Walmart.  Second, they are facing increasing competition in their higher-margin businesses.  Microsoft, Google and Apple are all pushing aggressively in offering cloud and web-hosting services. 
"
" That will force Amazon to either cede market share or reduce pricing. 
"
" Right now they are giving up market share since they are still growing so much anyway, but that will not be the case for too long. 
"
" Eventually they will need to compete on price as well.  Finally, if you stop growing your revenue by investing in new ventures, you need to increase your margins even more to make up for that lost growth.  Which is tough because of points one and two.""

"""My biggest gripe is that it auto loads nearly everything.  So it‚Äôs costing me data to see stuff I don‚Äôt care about.
