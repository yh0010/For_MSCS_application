"My guess is that the Tesla semi is going to have a range of around 1000km (600 miles), based on what your average truck driver will cover on a good day. Assuming a similar efficiency to the Nikola One, this means a battery pack of at least 1.2 MWh if you want to go without charging. 
"
"
"
"This seems like quite a large battery. Presumably, however, the idea is that you can also charge the battery during rest breaks. Assuming two 45 minute breaks per day, this amounts to 1.5 hours of charging. Current Superchargers can do 120 kW, which would mean that you only really need a (roughly) 1 MWh battery pack. It's interesting however to note Tesla's plans for a 350 kW Version 3 Supercharger. This could mean that you'd only need a 0.75 ~~kWh~~MWh battery pack to get through the day. ""

"Tesla is the biggest pyramid scheme on earth right now. Huge projections based on doing - ready for it - absolutely nothing. They've done nothing new - their electric cars are barely better than the GM EV1 that was mass produced 2 decades ago, their space technology is only cutting edge because they're a private company and is still largely on paper. They've done an incredibly successful PR job of making the American public believe that they're innovators by re-releasing technology with the media buzz needed to succeed. Think about it. All that Tesla has done that you can actually economically consume is their small range of cars, which offer only marginally better performance than anything else for 2-3x the price. They'll have a truck, they'll release it, they'll show you it works, reddit will jizz all over the screen, and then 4 years later when only the richest trucking companies have bought a single model to show off, everyone will be blaming """"the lethargic and outdated trucking industry"""" for not getting with the times. When the truck is released it will have only marginally better specs than what can currently be produced, Tesla will claim revolution, and the public will fail to comprehend how useless the model is to truckers. Just like the Model S and X - jizz all over it, ignore that in Canada you can't even go visit your closest relatives on a charge, ignore that the heater reduces range by 10% or more (lmao wtf) and ignore that it's useless as a fleet vehicle as it can only drive for 1/3 of a shift.

"Tesla is in PR and marketing. They will never make it to the moon, and trucks are at least 10 years away. It's one thing to sell a car to a rich guy who can afford to not use it for roadtrips and plan his life around a charge. Meanwhile, in the trucking world, US carriers are still tremendously upset and trying to work around adding Urea to their diesel fuel. They're so upset about it that they're rebuilding old track chassis with refurbished engines to run trucks under pre-emission regulation tags. But yeah, they're going to jump on board with limited-range, limited-payload vehicles.

The other part of 11/14 rule means that the car must be stationary for at least 10 (24-14) hours of the day while the driver rests. A Supercharger can fill a 100kWh pack in 75 minutes. 75/60*8 is exactly 10 hours. Even just from a single socket the semi will be fully charged when the driver is rested.

Trailers of that size are also the same price as a house in some places costing upwards of $200,000 and then the cost of the tow vehicle which can be $50,000-$150,000 depending on the make, model and outfitting of the cab (basic work truck all the way up to limo-level luxury).

"""The trouble is it's the trailer you're trying to get to the destination, not the truck""
"
"""The specific trailer is important because it's carrying the goods. You can't just pick up another trailer with a fresh battery and abandon your cargo. That also makes trailers more expensive and heavy. Even if they had a battery swap system for the trailer, the extra weight probably wouldn't be worth the few stops it would remove. Remember, the rocket equation does apply somewhat to terrestrial vehicles. The more energy you pack on board, the more energy you spend to move whatever mass that energy is stored in. With vehicles that consume the storage mass, you drop mass as you go, so packing in extra can be worth it. With electric vehicles, the weight strays constant. Given the mass of a single battery cell, the frictional losses in the bearings and tires of the vehicle (increased by mass) and the cost/benefit of battery size and time spent swapping batteries, I'm pretty sure you could come up with an exact equation for how large the battery would ideally be. My guess is that that equation is has been answered by Tesla and the answer is a battery that can fit inside the truck. There might be a small specialty shipping market for rapid emergency shipping without using a plane. f the mass of a battery large enough to cross the country without stopping doesn't decrease the speed of the vehicle enough to make a regular Tesla truck the better option, then maybe their could be a small market for trucks that have an extra power input socket that allows them to connect to special long-distance trailers with built in batteries. It's also totally possible that if a cross-country battery isn't efficient enough, a half-country, swappable trailer battery would be since it would significantly drop the weight of the battery in exchange for just one stop. In a way, you can think of each stop as your """"depleting mass"""" equivalent for liquid vehicles. Every stop you add divides the necessary size of your battery by one more number, assuming the stops are equidistant. The more stops, the more efficient your vehicle is because the battery can be lighter can cause less friction in the drive train. At some point though, you spend more time and waste more money by chilling at stopping points. I'm sure there's some balanced number of stops and battery mass that provides the most efficient system, and that's the equation I talked about earlier. Of course, some cargo runs value time more than others like the small market I also mentioned earlier, so there might be some situations where spending more money on a less efficient vehicle is worth it because of the money you make by getting it there faster; in other words, for different situations the value of the time to deliver is different so the equations changes.

"
"""They generally travel slower because of a few reasons that I'll list and how I think electric autonomy will improve those disadvantages.
"
"
"
"1- Aerodynamics-
"
"
"
"Problem- There isn't only so aerodynamic you can make what's is essentially a rectangle pulling a longer rectangle. Current designs place the driver either behind or on top and forward in regards to engine placement. 
"
"Solution- Electric motors and batteries can be mounted in many different ways that Gasoline or Diesel engines could not be. A motor and transmission couldn't be fitted to each wheel allowing for true all wheel drive and much better traction control systems mounted lower in the chassis allowing for a smaller overall towing vehicle.
"
"
"
"2-Braking distance- 
"
"
"
"Problem- Semi trucks regularly carry between 60,000-100,000 pounds, that's a lot of momentum to stop at high speeds with current air brake and hydraulic systems. Uneven braking conditions/ traction at each wheel can cause loss of control as well as jack knifing and poor stopping distances.
"
"Solution- combining traditional braking methods as well as the ability to control exact tire speeds at each wheel will lead to better anti-lock brakes as well as two types of braking. Traditional fiction brakes as well as """"engine brakes"""" which would reduce the wheel speed by controlling the amount of power to each wheel.
"
"
"
"3- Driver reaction times-
"
"
"
"Problem- Humans are relatively slow to process and act in response to stimulus with each person having a different response time. This is not ideal when traveling at a high rate of speed and weighing a metric ass-ton of weight among other vehicles of similar and smaller size for obvious reasons.
"
"Solution- Automation, computer systems are much quicker at processing things then we are, and are also able to react identically in a repeatable scenario. This kind of goes into my next point.
"
"
"
"4- Driver skill/Experience-
"
"
"
"Problem- Every driver on the road has a different level of skill and experience behind the wheel. This leads to situations where an inexperienced driver can make a mistake and cause or fail to avoid an accident that a more experienced driver would have prevented. Humans are also unpredictable, where a single driver makinggn 50 identical stops in an identical truck will stop at a different rate each time they're will also perform the same way in any other similar test.
"
"Solution- An Artificial Intelligence operating the vehicle will perform in a predictable manner under set circumstances every time. Each vehicle will also have the sameness """"driver skill/ experience level"""" because at least as far as Tesla goes they will be running an identical system in each truck.
"
"
"
"5- Knowledge of road and truck condition-
"
"Problem- A human driver only has so many senses to use to determine how to drive their vehicle in given conditions. We are limited to a few gauges that display basic truck diagnostics and are limited to visual observations of our surroundings to decide the best way to react.
"
"Solution- Computers are much better equipped to monitor dozens to thousands of vehicle sensors to help monitor performance, safety and maintenance of the vehicle. Computers are also not limited to visual sight to navigate. AI could make use of many techniques for monitoring road conditions that's would be impossible for a human, Infrared imaging, laser measuring devices of knowing exact distances, sensors implanted in the roadway to directly communicate temperature and mositure reading, radar, information from other vehicles on the road ahead so you know approximate conditions anywhere from a few feet away to many miles.
"
"
"
"6- Power, RPM, Weight and Speed-
"
"Problem- Diesel engines currently used in semi trucks have a fairly limited maximum RPM and power curve. A Caterpiller C15 is a 927.56 cubic inch (15.2l) supercharged and intercooled inline-6 diesel engine found in many semi trucks in the States, it weighs 3239 pounds, is approximately 54"""" long, 36"""" wide and 48"""" tall. The C15 produces 440-595 horsepower between 1800-2100 RPMs and between 1550-2050 lb-ft of torque at 1200 RPM. This very narrow powerband necessitates that it is followed by an extremely complex transmission. One example, an Eaton-Fuller TRDR0800 is an 18 forward and 4 speed reverse model that consists of a 5-speed front and a 4-speed auxiliary section and a splitter gear and without and additional transfer case will only power a single rear axle, to have two rear powered axles your first axle would also have to be a heavier and more complex carrier axle that allows for and input and output shaft to drive an additional axle, and to get all of those tires attached to those axles to spin you would need to install lockers in the axles adding more weight and complexity. 
"
"Solution- instead of a single large power plant of let's say 600hp and many complex and heavy gearing assemblies to power a true AWD use small (~100hp) hub mounted electric motors/transmissions. This setup with a centralized and modular battery pack would allow for much greater flexibility then the large Diesel engines and transmission would while also lowering the center of gravity. They would also allow for an """"on demand"""" active AWD with less parasitic drag on the system. These smaller modular wheel mounted drive motors would also allow for greater ease of maintenance if produced in a modular fashion especially if all 6 drive motor/tires are interchangeable. I'm not sure on the total weight of the system as compared to a diesel but I believe that the system I'm trying to deceive wouldn't allow for better weight distribution and a smaller overall vehicle. Using this type of system would also allow for the possibility of adding features drive motors to the trailer as well as the tractor allowing for for even better traction, even going so far as to giveback each wheel the ability to steer given its modular design.
"
"
"
"Conclusion- I know I went a bit off tangent in regards to the post originally being about speed but when I thought about it those were the pros that came to mind in regards to an AI controlled Electric cargo vehicle since I don't even know if a """"semi"""" would be the correct term at that point. 
"
"
"
"Lastly I don't think that cargo trucks should be entirely AI controlled. There are going to be instances where a driver will be needed to take over from the computer. Be that because of an error with the autopilot function, a mechanical problem of some sort , conditions outside of the experience or operating range of the system or in areas where the infrastructure for autopilot hasn't been implemented. I think the biggest breakthrough with this will be the electric powerplant and batteries/ charging technology, all of this being made said, I'm a diesel mechanic who works on anything from a diesel F-350 up to a CAT excavator. Diesel is what's our past was fueled by, electricity will power our future for years to come.

"""Coal causes more mercury and heavy metal pollution than batteries ever will, even besides co2.  I have a bit more detailed comment [here](.  What specifically do you take issue with?
"

"
"No technology is perfect but batteries are definitely better than any of the alternatives.  Fuel cells require materials to produce and for electrolysis and use 3-5x more electricity to provide the same power to cars.  It's the same problem as biofuels, it's just a fundamentally less efficient process.  Even if hydrogen isn't produced through steam cracking it requires a ton of hydroxides and nickel electrodes just like batteries, and all of the more efficient technologies aren't any better.  Fuel cells use catalysts, graphite and plastics in similar amounts to batteries. 
"
"
"
"Supercapacitors have all kinds of different chemistries but regardless of how they're made they're gonna create more pollution than batteries.  Supercapacitors are defined by having less energy storage than batteries (they have ion transport just like batteries do).  They're a middle ground between batteries and capacitors so for the same storage you'll always need more material and mass.  Given how fast batteries charge already it's way more preferable to take a 20 minute stop every 4 hours than to stop for 5 minutes every two hours.  Pulling over and stopping is a hassle, and it's virtually impossible that supercapacitors will reach half the capacity of batteries.  They have a damn hard time breaking 10%.

"Cobalt can be nasty stuff but on the grand scale of nastiness it's still only around a 3-4.  We use way nastier stuff in ten thousand times larger quantities, like sulfuric acid or acrylate.

"Lithium on the other hand is just about the perfect thing we could make batteries out of.  It's one of the top five most abundant materials, it's easily accessible and as environmentally friendly to mine as possible, and we need a very small amount of it.  Refining lithium is more environmentally friendly than splitting water for hydrogen- that's how good it is.  Alkaline water electrolysis (the simplest, cheapest and most common method for electrolysis) uses sodium (caustic soda) or potassium hydroxide (caustic potash) as an electrolyte, and then the electrolyte has to be scrubbed from the hydrogen and oxygen, the water needs to be filtered, plus it uses a huge amount of wasted electricity.  Refining lithium requires calcium hydroxide (caustic lime) and produces chalk.  Like is very low toxicity; soda ash and potash cause burns and are quite toxic.  Hell, it takes less energy to separate lithium ore from gangue than it does to filter water in preparation for electrolysis.  There's a reason purifying seawater is so expensive.  The last thing we need to be doing is burning our freshwater for fuel.""
