"
"""I mean, don't take this too literally.  Every Tesla motor has those T shapes the other way around, pointing *inward*- the type of motor in the OP is an """"outrunner"""", where the outside part is the rotor.  All Tesla motors have rotors on the inside, which is more efficient[1] but slightly larger.
"
"
"
"The biggest stylization of the T is that in all motors the thickness of the tooth stem does not decrease.  It stays the same width the whole way up and down, otherwise the narrow part would constrict the magnetic flux.  The indent at the top and the hooks at the [shoe]( to guess that they'd be the next step.
"
"
"
"The motor in the OP image would be a very expensive space heater because it's fully short circuited.  The Ts form loops on the very inside of the motor; flux needs to be forced across the air gap between the stator and rotor to develop torque.  It does look [a little like a squirrel cage rotor](, but it would still only be a space heater if the white spaces were filled with copper or aluminum- the outer rim is too thick and there's no return path on the other side of the conductors.
"
"
"
"[1]: The magnetic fields in a motor form [these big loops](.  It happens to work out that with all motor types, it's more efficient to reduce the other stuff.  With permanent magnet motors, the magnets can be made much more powerful than the field in the motors, so it's easy to just do that to compensate.  With induction motors the path current takes is longer in the rotor than the stator, so it's actually beneficial for the rotor to be slightly smaller.
"

"
"This is also one reason that motor designs are more efficient as you scale them up.  The farther you are from the center (while keeping the same size tooth), the closer the inside and outside are to being the same size.""

"All of you smoothbrains complaining about this are missing the whole point.  When you buy the car it's for the current stats listed on the website and you will get exactly what you pay for.  Tesla is offering people the option to upgrade to a car that is better than the one they originally purchased for some extra money.  If you don't think it's worth the cost don't pay for it.  You are never going to be able to sideload custom car OS software onto a Tesla because of the safety and liability nightmares it would cause.  You would be lucky to get even get a fraction of the free software and performance updates from a different automaker that Tesla has already provided owners after purchase.  This business model allows Tesla to price their cars slightly cheaper knowing that a percentage of owners will opt for paid software upgrades which would then improve their margins and in effect subsidize the cost for everyone else.  If you feel another automaker offers a better value you should buy their car.

It has things like the most advanced 4 wheel steering ever in a car, a 3d drivers display which no other car maker offers, An augmented reality HUD which is absolutely incredible and also not offered by any other car maker, the best adaptive suspension which reads the road ahead and adapts the suspension to it available, the most high tech light in any car, which is more precise at cutting out things than any other car and can actually display things on the street like crosswalks for people crossing the road or lines how wide the car is if you drive through something narrow and a lot more, the best infotainment system which you can find in a car today, best voice control system, great autonomous driving and parking capabilities and a ton of small luxury features which are just nice to have and make driving the car a very pleasant thing. And additionally to that its absolutely super comfortable, super quiet inside and just a nicer place to be than any livingroom. None of the articles above even took a look on all these top of the notch tech features and just trashed it for being a luxury sedan.

So consumers would decide to wait a couple years until the price on the awesome BEV version comes down. And that would kill existing ICE sales until a magical cheap BEV that only Tesla has can be produced. 
"

Another 6c/mile for maintenance (factoring in my own time, because any servicing that wasn't warranty, except the one thing the $100 item needed specialized equipment for turning the front brake rotors, I did DIY).

The problem is we don't have this data for all the cars and temperatures obviously vary a lot between his tests even in winter or summer. Also the 120 km/h test is missing from a lot of the tesla cars so how can we compare them to the test he recently did? For instance the tesla M3 AWD LR (which is the current version), has a WLTP range of 560 km in Bjorns test on 90 km/h it also got 560 km, so the WLTP test is dead on.

That just assumes the correct socket type, as there are 2 or 3 that are common, but you can get portable-enough chargers for each of them. 
"
"
"
"A lot of the J1772 portable chargers say that they can plug into a 240V outlet even though they have the US 120V plug. So the internal electronics are probably made to handle both 120V and 240V so those parts can be shared for both US and EU markets, and only the wall plug is different. So, you can (against all electrical codes) wire a 120V outlet to actually be 240V and charge about twice as fast (the amperage stays the same). 
"
"
"
"But I suggest against that. Some electronics will handle it, some won't. 
"
"
"
"The world should have standardized voltage, either at 120v or 240v. That would have made things so much easier.""
"
"""I somewhat agree. Especially for the wall charger, that thing is just for aesthetics and is overkill for most people. But the thing to consider cost wise is that efficiency of charging on a standard outlet is like 67% IIRC, while a 220v charger is something like 95% efficient. The efficiency loss comes from having to run the on board converter, cooling, and the computer and all that, which takes up 33% of the energy coming from a 110v but only 5% of a fast charge. So you're actually saving quite a bit of money over a ten year period by switching to a fast charge. If you're charging say 2000 kWh a year at 10 cents that's $200, times 25% for efficiency loss, you're wasting $50 a year. So after ten years it pays for itself to at least install a NEMA 14-50 plug, depending on the cable length and electrician rate. Plus it is more convenient if you really need it one day after a long trip, which is worth something.""

"But most of SA doesn't have the size-limiting issues present in Europe or Asia (narrow roads, limited space, high taxes of large vehicles) so if a very efficient truck was available it would sell, even if it is hughe (in fact, especially if it is, as hinted be the fact that in many countries, before fuel prices went up in the 80s, the most common truck was the Ford F100, which was fairly large for the time).

Totally understand that Tesla needs to make money and the bundle is a great way to do that. As someone with FSD I can attest to what Ben mentioned below. Summon is still just a party trick for most. Auto park is a party trick with a little more use if you struggle to parallel  park. Too many stories about it curbing rims in this sub to fully trust it at this point. NoA is just not good enough yet to provide value for a lot of people. Driving with regular auto pilot is still significantly better in my experience and use it 100% of the time over NoA.

But, I’ve heard plenty of stories about poor delivery experiences with ICE vehicles, e.g. surprise fees, financing hurdles, make-ready schedules, “sorry, your vehicle with beige trim was our mistake”, etc. These resulted in hours of inconvenience.

I noticed the suspension was very very bumpy at first, like the whole car was shaking uncontrollably, I almost turned around and brought it back, but it stopped after a while so I think it just takes a little time to settle (could have also been that particular stretch of highway I was on).

Happy to report this is giving me back the feelings I had first test driving the 3. It makes the car a whole lot more fun to drive. Sure, it's totally unnecessary, but I'm someone who had a Model Y Performance with Induction wheels on order (when that was still an option).

"
"
"
"1.) I assumed the boost was eventually going to come to the mode Y for only $2,000. 
"
"
"
"2.) performance price put me over the MSRP that made me ineligible for a 2,000 tax incentive. So in reality performance would have costed me an extra $10,000.
"
"
"
"3.) the Uber turbine rims are easily scratched, give a rough ride and are not good for winter. So I would have had to spend another $2,500 buying new wheels and rims.""

"""This is actually why I changed my preorder in June to a LR, I assumed they would add an acceleration boost. I’m super happy by this!""

"You know how much money and time ICE car guys spend to get >10% improvement in acceleration?   Don’t get it off you don’t want it.   I code not to get it on my 3 because I think the base is quite fast enough. To each their own
"
"Not sure 2k is a money grab. It’s actually pretty good performance for price. I used to have an Audi turbo. I spent 800$ to chip it and then 1500$ on exhaust. Combined it gave less power then this upgrade. I won’t even mention the waste of money I spent on my old non turbo cars. You couldn’t make them move without major upgrades. It’s actually a solid upgrade for those that want a car with slightly more power out of the non perf Tesla’s.
"
"""It’s the same price as on the 3, for a similar boost?

"If you think it’s a rip off, you’re not the target audience. People pay more for less with ICE upgrades.""

In addition to the fact that they cover the extra strain under warranty, you're paying them for the R&D they did and continue to do to make the motor capable of going that fast. There's a reason why you can't make a Nissan Leaf go this fast with a software update. They sold better motors to everyone without raising the price, then pay for it by charging specifically the people who want it. As a consumer, it allows people who don't want the performance to get a cheaper car and those that want it to be able to add it whenever they want it.

"I wouldn't even know where to begin to get back to the actual brake calipers...""
"
"""I think there are a few videos out there, I found some posts on reddit/tesla motor club of people who did it. Basically, you take your wheels off, put plastic bags around a the calipers, use painters tape to cover the small gaps in/around the calipers and then apply 3 coats of the VHT high temperature caliper spray paint (10 min apart). You can then apply the Tesla caliper decals and then spray some VHT clear gloss to finish it off. The key is preparing the calipers and covering areas around it to avoid overspray. You can also have this done at a shop, but the quotes I got were $600-900, whereas I spent less than $50 in materials to do it myself.""

"""Wanted to share a positive delivery story. Picked up today at the Brooklyn, NY service center. 
"
"
"
"Red / black / Non-perf, no FSD, induction wheels. VIN 42,XXX
"
"
"
"We had an absurd hiccup with insurance and middle names not exactly matching licenses and it taking esurance 2 hours to fix and send over new cards - so although we didn’t plan on fine tooth combing, we wound up being forced to have the time to.   Not Tesla’s fault, but they did everything they could and were extremely apologetic it took so long. 
"
"
"
"So finally - the car! 
"
"The paint is perfect condition, and everything worked exactly as it should. Panel gaps are great with a small exception of one rear door and the frunk, which I’m fine with doing a service appointment for, and the SC documented for me. Everything besides those two small things was perfect. 
"
"
"
"I was so nervous, but couldn’t have asked for a better experience from the Tesla end - my advisor nailed it. Hope this helps all of the nervous folks out there picking up this month.

"Let me know if you have any questions, happy to answer!""

"Been quoting insurances and Geico came out ahead for me.""

"""It didn’t, and it looked so much better! The front plate bracket they put on uses double sided tape, and there’s no drilling into the bumper. I figured double sided tape was better than being pulled over or getting a ticket on the street.""
"
"I hope you get a good car. I have been trying to schedule a front trunk alignment for 2 months with them now. Tesla Brooklyn had me wait almost 3 weeks for the next available service appointment only to cancel it last minute and pass the job over to a random Tesla authorized body shop
"
"Good luck!! The wait was the worst part!
"
"""Congrats! I didn’t wind up printing and bringing a checklist, but I reviewed a bunch that I had found on this sub. Most all seemed to be the same. I just went around the car slowly inside and out and made sure to use my hands a lot to follow the panels to check for gaps. The SC seems to be very used to people bringing checklists and taking their time, they were very cool about giving everyone who was there time to inspect and document. For insurance - crazy, I had Geico for 5 years prior and they wound up being the most expensive for the Y - I wound up going with esurance, who was by far the cheapest, but quickly found out you get what you pay for with their customer service unfortunately. Good luck!!""

Every time I see one in person my first reaction is """"that looks great!"""" and then a second later """"oh geez, that doesn't match.""""
"
"
"
"Sure I could pay $1300 CAD, or $2600 CAD for red, just to have the car match. But that seems silly when I like the white.""
"
"""I felt the same walking around the car. Generally it felt okay, but once I was taking everything in and adding it up, it didn't feel fair to have to compromise on so many things. The bumper color was definitely noticeable (even at sunset, when the picture was taken) and probably would continue to bother me every time I saw it. And I think you're right, some poor soul will likely inspect it next. Just didn't expect it was scheduled to be me next Tuesday 😂""
"
"Yes it was Buena Park :(
"
"""I'm not entirely sure, but symmetry on gaps would have felt more acceptable. I think seeing one side with almost no gap and then a large gap on another side makes things feel worse.""
"
"I asked this same question to my service center and they said they have some panel gap measuring tools coming in from Fremont. It sounds like everything has it's own spec.
"
"yeah he has via tweets and knows its an issue but seems like its low on their priority list to fix since ppl are still buying em and idiots who dont quality check are ignoring issues
"
"""Hi thankful that the employee was extremely nice, I'm Dad👨""
"
"Of course there are.
"
"""Damnit, that’s where I’ll have to pick up my Model Y.""
"
"""Hi not entirely sure, but symmetry on gaps would have felt more acceptable, I'm Dad👨""
"
"""I think after staring at my hatch is what is getting me.. I'm not sure if it is """"too large"""" of a gap (I can stick my pinky finger in the gap at the top between the hatch and the panoramic glass) or if it's just me reading to many horror stories.
"
"The rest of the gaps look very symmetrical though which is why I'm hesitant.""
"
"""I think if you do your research, know what you're looking for and what you will allow in terms of misalignments and flaws, you should be fine! Aside from their bad customer service, Tesla's are really exciting and fun to drive!  
"
"
"
"
"
"I had a few misalignments with the tail lights and the charging port but they were able to fix those quickly. They will fix almost everything for free, so long as you schedule an appointment with the service center.""
"
"Good bot?
"
"I'm dad.
"
"""yikes that is awful, did Tesla agree to fix the side fender issue?""
"
"""Congrats! Where did you take delivery, if you don’t mind me asking? I had the same configuration with a 41xxx vin in SoCal, but it was unmatched because I couldn’t take delivery within the 3-day window at the end of August. 
"
"
"
"The car looks fantastic. I’m happy with the choice of MSM. I can’t wait to finally take delivery.""
"
"Updoot for Gantu
"
"""both fender and bumper have paint issues along edges- it looks like touch up paint was applied very liberally to cover for scratched off edges when panels and the headlight abraded.. to properly repair these would require fully repainting the entire bumper and fender, a good paint shop will tell you that spot repair painting , which Tesla often does in their service lots will never look right""
"
"Where did you get that little piece that divides the front cup holders?
"
"Inductions looks nice!!
"
"They did... now to find out how long it will take them. :o
"
"Nashville!
"
"Yep this looks really bad hope they can take it off and sand and fix it without repaiting whole thing
"
"Abstract Ocean
"
"That is a beautiful car! I'm not sure if it's just the reflection but it looks like the hood to the left of the T might be a bit dented?
"
"""I literally gasped when that photo loaded and said """"Oh my God, that's sexy as fuck""""
"
"
"
"Looks like the exact options I chose for mine. Gray, white interrier, non-bumpy wheels...
"
"
"
"When did you order yours?""
"
"""Im on the 51xxx (lower end) MSM, black, gemini. SoCal. I don't have a delivery date but hoping its on its truck down here soon. Thanks for the heads up. Ill be looking for those things too.
"
"
"
"I ordered mine 8/23/20.""
"
"Dent fixed via paintless repair at the SC (no charge).  A few other minor issues fixed up as well.  Pretty painless.
"
"""You know what, I think you're right!!!  Arghhhh!  I added it to my service list.""
"
"""I actually ordered mine on Jan. 19th!!  I had a VIN # assigned at the end of last quarter but based on all the delivery horror stories at the time, decided to wait another quarter (we didn't urgently need the car).
"
"
"
"It's funny, I don't seem to see many photos of MSM with white, but I think it's a great combo!!!""
"
"👍
"
"Glad to hear it!!
"
"Yes! It’s underrated but that’s my favorite MY color combo too.
"
"Seeing the induction wheels make me regret not picking them. I guess I’ll know for sure when I pick mine up.
"
"""This picture and color on the car look great. Normally I don't go for the blue, but :wowowowow:""
"
"""It feels kind of weird planning road trips with overnight charging in mind, like """"*living for the car we bought*"""" rather than choosing what destination makes sense for our trip. But it totally works and we've stayed at some really interesting places we wouldn't have seen otherwise. Some have been """"Tesla Destination"""" and some have been J1772. Either way, leaving with a full charge is a nice perk.""
"
"They both look good imo. I don’t think you’ll have any regrets either way
"
"Thank you!
"
"Thats what my wife keeps telling me. I’ve heard the inductions have a range decease as well?
"
"Probably 5-10 miles
"
"Oh that’s nothing
"
"""But they are serious curb rash magnets. I'm trying to decide... I actually think the Gemini look really good on Blue. But on white I might get inductions. 
"
"
"
"Not a loss either way. You can get great looking wheels from tsportline that are cheaper than induction.""
