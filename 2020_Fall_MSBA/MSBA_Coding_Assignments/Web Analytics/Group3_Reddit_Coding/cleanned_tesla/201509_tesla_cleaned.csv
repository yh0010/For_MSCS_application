"Reminds me of the [Peugeot 907](.
"
"Buy good sunglasses.
"
"""I wonder if bird droppings will be easy to see, because the windshield wipers can't get to them.""
"
"I am bald. I will have to drive this car upside down. 
"
"I look at this as a bad thing.  I'm sure I'm not alone.
"
"""this and the doors are gonna get so. much. attention.  Awesome.
"
"
"
"altho, now im wondering how this impacts its safety ratings. like, if a tree falls or a rock flies from a semi truck in front, would it protect you AS WELL as if it had been frame, not glass?""
"
"""so, why are we seeing an opel? this car will not pass the """"safety"""" standards in the u.s. hence, why so many great cars will not come here.""
"
"Damn that's one sexy car.
"
"Looks somewhat like a 599.
"
"It's heavily tinted like sunglasses already
"
"It will probably be tinted. The sunroof in the Model S blocks sun and heat very well.
"
"""Yeah, the sun is going to be a huge problem. Not just the light, but the heat.""
"
"""The NTHSA will do a roof strength test that will measure the entire roof's weight capacity. This is really to test rollover strength, not tree falling on your roof strength. 
"
"
"
"A tree falling head on to the car will cause more damage than in a normal car with a pillar at the top of the windshield. If it fell perpendicular to the car, the roof will have more strength like a normal vehicle. 
"
"
"
"I don't see how a rock picked up from a truck will be much different other than there being an extra inch or two of glass to collide with. Rocks don't often impact the roof from the road. 
"
"
"
"Glass replacement repairs will be expensive, though. Fortunately insurance typically covers this, but it could mean higher insurance premiums for the X relative to the S. ""
"
"""You obviously don't have experience with the sun roof on the Model S. No glare and almost all heat is blocked (98% I think). If those problems don't exist on the Model S sunroof, they definitely won't exist on the Model X windshield.""
"
"""In cooler climates, this can be quite nice. I owned an -88 Corvette with tranparent roof panel and the feeling of openness and space was great. ""
"
"Because it has a similar windshield idea so we can get an idea of what it'll be like.  Obviously.
"
"""Yes, not electric unfortunately (6.0-litre V12) but indeed sexy. GÃ©rard Welter and Jean-Christophe Bolle-Reddat created it for the 2004 Paris Motor Show to display then new design techniques. That  arching windscreen/roof part was one of the things that had impressed me.""
"
"""Yes, it very much does, if I correctly assume that you mean the Ferrari 599 GTB (Gran Turismo Berlinetta) '*Fiorano*'. Of course, since the Ferrari 599 showed up (2006 Geneva Motor Show) a couple of years after the Peugeot 907 (2004 Paris Motor Show), one could say that it's the illustrious  Pininfarina 599 design that *looks like* the 907's. :)
"
"
"
"edit: [Ferrari 599 GTB](""
"
"""It's not a problem with the Model S sunroof, which blocks a lot of light and almost all heat, so why would it be a problem with the Model X windshield?""
"
"""I'm sure it's heavily tinted. 
"
"""
"
""">Not just the light, but the heat.
"
"
"
"Alright, someone calculate the added solar insolation, the amount of AC needed to offset it, and how much battery this consumes.
"
"
"
"Actually it'd be amazing if the windows turned opaque when parked to help keep the car cool in parking lots.""
"
"Never enought heat during winter tho.
"
"""yep, insurance is one of the 'hidden costs' that too many ppl who think about TCOO don't consider.
"
"
"
"i really hope the base model 3 is truly no frills, no gimmicks, in stark contrast to the X and S.  Just make it not look like a weirdmobile, that's all i ask, elon.""
"
"And you obviously don't have experience dealing with the intense sunshine at high altitude.
"
"Hm. You're actually right.
"
"I'm not prepared to leave out the possibility that the windshield may be electro-static. lass
"
"""How exactly do you distinguish a """"gimmick"""" from reimagining a boring feature in most cars, that most car companies have not sought to improve or change in quite some time?  
"
"
"
"""
"
"""It's heavily tinted, it'll be fine.  ""
"
"Oh man if it is.. they'd have done it. 
"
"""i look at it this way: how is the cost & benefit value equation of a particular feature? and is the particular feature pretty attention grabbing?
"
"
"
"if the answer is """"Pretty dubious, or worse"""" and """"very much"""" then you are veering into gimmick territory.  And this is not just for cars.
"
"
"
"See also: Fire Phone.  For shame, bezos.""
"
"""Better have a zero deductible on windshield for auto insurance, that's a six thousand dollar windshield to be sure.""
"
"""> Oh man if it is.. they'd have done it.
"
"
"
"Well, you're not wrong.""
"
"""I think that's a fairly good description of how to differentiate between the two, I would argue it is a bit too early to know if this will fall in the gimmick category.""
"
"It'll be fine.  California is a hot ass place I'm sure they've thought of this.   Air conditioned seats and modern vents go a LONG way
"
"Nothing new really.  The rear glass on my 1984 Camaro was outrageous expensive also as it was a stressed member of the unibody.  But...you could literally hit it with a baseball bat and it wouldn't break.
"
"""Ahh yes, the 1984 Camaro. That rear glass was designed to withstand the anger of a cheated significant other when escaping from your trailer home. Chevy really did their homework.""
