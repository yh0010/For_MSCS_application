"
"

"
"
"There were a lot of things we couldn’t do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment. It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn’t match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: November Charlie 175, I’m showing you at ninety knots on the ground. Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the “ HoustonCentervoice.” I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country’s space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houstoncontrollers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that… and that they basically did. And it didn’t matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios. Just moments after the Cessna’s inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his groundspeed. Twin Beach, I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed. Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check Before Center could reply, I’m thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol’ Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He’s the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground. And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done – in mere seconds we’ll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check? There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground. I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: Ah, Center, much thanks, We’re showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money. For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the HoustonCentervoice, when L.A.came back with: Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one. It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day’s work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.""

We'll ID it, tell you about risks and about what changes you can make so it won't happen again. Also under some circumstances we will retrieve the bat.

"PS: as long as the bat isn't shivering on the ground it probably doesnt have rabies. The yolo bat foundation (out by sac) just had their bat talks last weekend. 10% of all grounded freetail bats tested positive for rabies but represented less than 1% of 1% of the bat population. ""

"""When I was a child my mother and I were playing with my baby sister on the living room floor. Suddenly my sister looked up and exclaimed, """"oooo look, a birdie!"""" My mother smilingly looked up and said, """"where?"""" And then screamed in terror. It was a bat. She dragged me under the dining room table and scurried to the phone to call our neighbor, who was a tough old farm wife. Our neighbor was no help. """"I don't know, I'm terrified of the things,"""" she said. """"Chase it with a broom."""" So my mother opened the doors and windows, but chasing it with a broom was more than she could bear, so we huddled under the dining room table for what seemed like hours until it found its way out, only to set up its home under the eaves of our house.

After a few seconds I realized it was a bat. I turned on the light and used my sheet as a net to snare it. Took me three tries to get it.

"White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging disease in North American bats which by 2012 was associated with at least 5-7 million bat deaths. The condition is named for a distinctive fungal growth around the muzzles and on the wings of hibernating bats and was first identified from a February 2006 photo taken in a cave in Schoharie County, New York. It has rapidly spread. By 2016, the fungus had been found in caves and mines of 29 states throughout the Northeastern US and 5 eastern Canadian provinces.

"Special edition paint you mean? I'm not sure. I don't think it's a color option for bmw individual cars. I know the individual program has a satin white but I haven't seen this blue. I think I'm the only one in Canada with it. I don't really know if you can ask for it to order. Bmw makes a select amount of special cars like this every year and forces them at random on dealerships. A few years back there was a satin black m3 and last year was this satin blue m6. I was lucky enough to see it at the dealership and didn't actually order it myself.
"

Most passengers will travel across relatively short distances making multiple connections that include some time spent in private transport and some time spent in public transport. The """"last mile"""" connections will transport passengers to and from their homes using smaller vehicles sometimes as a private transport, but also sometimes shared. Passengers will then travel in larger capacity vehicles between hubs. The fares will become so ridiculously inexpensive, compared to car ownership, that most people will opt out of owning private vehicles.

There's some CO2 produced by reducing the silica (SO2) into silicon metal as well, but that's very small- grams of CO2 per solar panel.

"
"All the armchair body engineers are ready!
"
"""Welcome to the way my hobby has been operating for the past twenty years.  It's called the Pre-Order system, and it works perfectly.
"
"
"
"Instead of having inventory sitting around waiting for customers, you list a product and take orders, and then only deliver what has been ordered.  End result, there are no extras sitting around, and customers cannot sit around and haggle over the price. Those who want to haggle are essentially cut out of the market altogether.
"
"
"
"Further, by limiting the market, the pre-order system can even make some models worth far more on the resale market, which means it becomes lucrative for investors to buy a couple and then flip them for a higher price after all sales are closed.  Those models produced enjoy a lower rate of depreciation because there are fewer replacements for them.

"""No, absolutely not.  If anything, the stock has been so strong based on generally positive speculation for the Model 3.  The price of the car has been well known for a long time, so not sure what that would have to do with this week's drop.  Tesla is (was?) trading with the largest market cap of any automobile maker and its largely based on the demand for the Model 3 and generally positive speculation for its release... not so much on current sales (other than indicators re: delivery and if they are in front or behind schedule, etc).
"

"
"As long as the Model 3 isn't a total disaster, it's already a giant success.  At 400,000 reservations, that's already $15,000,000,000 in potential sales, relatively conservatively... with no real advertising campaign(!), and a less risk averse roll-out than the Model X, not to mention its impact on their stock price, etc.

Or more similarly to topic at hand, my brother joined a startup and was made co-founder ostensibly despite being potentially/ostensibly well after original incorporation date IIRC, so (as the various quora, stackexchange, or whatnot articles note) in cases of varying similarity, the definition is generally not so cut and dry, all I can concur on is that from some perspectives Tesla's founder situation may be a non-romanticized-quintessential-stereotypical case but not that uncommon (or unprecedented for that matter) either (e.g., changing founder designation, bickering, Founder-CEO getting swapped prior to IPO, active vs passive VC).  Just as there are myths and stereotypes with the quintessential VC ( the Founder status is a lot more ambiguous and the harder the standard the more potentially absurdity-inducing exceptions you'll generally find is my guess.  I'm sympathetic to your cause but at same time I imagine it is futile or at least challenging in concept to me to formulate a personally satisfactory universal Founder criteria if I were to concurrently adhere to my admittedly underdeveloped nebulous idea of spirit or intent WRT to Founder status.[1]

"
"My A3 was only on for long periods of time after I killed my turbo at 230,000 miles - and I wasn't about to drop $5k on a new turbo for a 15yr old car with that many miles - so I drove it with a bad turbo for another 20k until I dumped it. Surprisingly unless you knew there was a bad turbo - it was hard to tell. 
"
"
"
"And the check engine light in VAG comes on for all kinds of things so it's not a false positive when it comes on - something is indeed wrong. Of the things I know that cause it to light:
"
"- gas cap
"
"- MAS
"
"- O2 sensor
"
"- turbo
"
"- waste gate
"
"- thermostat 
"
"- some airflow diverter valve/flap - related to MAS
"
"- air leaks anywhere in the turbo
"

"
"And I'm sure there are more. VAG just has very small tolerances so small variances trip the light. Surprisingly it will reset itself many times, but I've only had it come on when something was wrong. So if you're driving one with it on most of the time - it's because you didn't fix whatever was causing the issue.  
"

"FWIW: Subi is actually partly owned by Toyota - which probably explains why there is only the BRZ coupe and WRX/STI sedan - since they want you you go buy a Lexus instead.

Red cars accounted for 14 percent of the local vehicle population and about 16 percent of the citations for speeding, which is not a significant difference. Surprisingly, his informal study did reveal certain statistically significant differences, but they had to do with other colors of vehicle.

"White cars, which accounted for 25 percent of the local vehicle population, received only 19 percent of the tickets, which meant such jalopies were cited for their transgressions less often than they should have been. This raises a new hypothesis: Rather than red attracting the unwelcome attentions of the highway patrol, perhaps instead it is the case that police tend not to notice white vehicles that are breaking the law.
"
"
"
"Gray cars were the ones that gained a greater share of the speeding tickets than they statistically should have: while they accounted for only 6 percent of cars on the road, they pulled down 10 percent of the tickets issued. On the flip side, silver cars got only 5 percent of the tickets, yet they represented 10 percent of the car population.""""

"""Making gas cars isn't really friendly either, nor is mining oil. Hell even getting the materials to make small aspects like speakers isn't friendly. No car as of today is 100% without some sort of environmental consequence. That's why Tesla exists, to lessen that consequence. In the article you linked they even say """"While green technologies might be better for the environment, none is completely clean yet."""" which is entirely true. The closer Tesla gets to making gasoline cars a weekend thing or hobby the closer we get to making things like mining equipment electric too.""

"""I'm a fan like others here, but eventually we have to stop making excuses for every possible flaw in a Tesla. ""

"""I did like the black and think it looks sharp.  One of my few hesitations is that I've heard from so many people about how it shows dirt so distinctly.  Of the release candidates we'd seen previously, blue was at the top of my list, followed closely by black.  Sig red piqued my interest, but not sure I like it enough.

"While I think I'm sold on this color, it may be worth a trip to the local retail store to look at the paint samples once the official color list is announced...""
"
"Agreed. I like the contrast of the silver wheels with the darker paint. Also I think these wheels look really good and they're easier to see silver.
"
"Could you try a darker version of the original wheels and leave the tint and chrome delete?
"
"""I'd say it looks good, but I think I'd have to go for another colour too though, a dark car would be like getting into an oven over here during the summer, although pre-conditioning could solve that... and realistically any car turns into a mobile sauna regardless of the colour. ""

"Wheels TBD (probably whatever is cheapest) but Midnight Silver for the color based on what we've seen so far.

"I think the tint on my previous car (a 4-door sedan), for all the windows except the windshield, was around $400-600, but I may be mixing stuff up, since it was about six years ago.
