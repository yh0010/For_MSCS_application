I would go even farther and point out that the common pop culture image of a long term drug user who has suffered physical deterioration because of their drug use (think """"meth mouth"""" and scabs on junkies) is largely because of habbits adjacent to their drug use, and not the drugs themselves. Meth mouth is caused by poor oral hygiene over long periods of time, along with dry mouth caused by dehydration, and not by the drug itself. Sunken features and bad skin is caused by poor eating habbits and dehydration. Scabs on junkies is caused by needle reuse and poor hygiene.

"I don’t. I just think it should be faster than an SUV in a straight line. Dragsters take the “fastest thing in a straight line” category, super cars if we are talking “production”. I do that that a sports car should be FASTER than an SUV. Notice how I used the word “faster” not “fastest”. Because a sports car should be faster than a SUV, not the fastest thing out there. I mean I would assume an SUV is faster than a fully loaded 18 wheeler, but I don’t think that an SUV is the fastest thing out there. Does that now make the 18 wheeler faster because the SUV isn’t the fastest thing around? That’s what your logic sounds like.

"""The focus of a sports car is handling. SUVs cannot surpass the handling capabilities of sports cars. Teslas cannot go around a track without overheating, so it cannot even be quantified how much slower a Model X is around the Nurburgring (a track with **turns**) compared to a 911.

"
"
"The fact that a vehicle with a totally different type of power plant can output more energy and thus accelerate itself faster is completely irrelevant to the 911's performance as a sports car, just as a hamburger's inferiority as a blunt weapon compared to a brick is a moot point in regards to the hamburger's purpose.

"Five teens injured in Maroon Creek Road accident
"
"Andre Salvail, Aspen Daily News Staff Writer

"Shaun’s Towing removes a 2017 Tesla SUV from an accident scene Thursday near Maroon Creek Road. The driver and four passengers all were injured. The vehicle was believed to have been moving at a high rate of speed when it ran off the road, went airborne and rolled down a steep embankment, according to Colorado State Patrol.

"
"A vehicle moving at an excessive speed ran off Maroon Creek Road on Wednesday evening and went airborne, striking a tree and rolling several times down a steep embankment, according to Colorado State Patrol.
"
"
"
"All five passengers were injured, three of them seriously, according to Capt. Richard Duran of the CSP’s Glenwood Springs office.
"
"
"
"The accident occurred about 3.5 miles from Highway 82 just before 8 p.m., Duran said. The vehicle, a 2017 Tesla SUV, was moving northbound when it swerved off the road at a curve. The location is near the T-Lazy-7 Ranch.
"
"
"
"Craig Turpin/Aspen Daily News ▲
"
"The driver, Joseph Lipsey, 18, of Aspen, suffered serious injuries and was transported to Aspen Valley Hospital, according to Duran. Lipsey will be cited for careless driving causing injury and for driving without a valid driver’s license, Duran said.
"
"
"
"The passengers included three other 18-year-olds and one 17-year-old. All four passengers also were taken to Aspen Valley Hospital for treatment. Two of the passengers sustained serious injuries while one of the riders had moderate injuries. Another passenger’s injuries were reportedly minor, Duran said.
"
"
"
"He added that alcohol and drugs were not an apparent factor in the accident. All five passengers were wearing seat belts, and no one was ejected. The vehicle came to a stop right side up with its wheels in the creek, more than 200 feet from the road, Duran said, citing a trooper’s report.
"
"
"
"Duran cautioned motorists to obey speed limits and to exercise caution while driving on roads and highways without lighting.

"""I've run the numbers on the ICE I own vs what I will spend on the Model 3 that's on the way. This is done using online calculators that allow you to put in actual maintenance costs from records if you have it (I do), or estimate if you don't, as well as enter zip code so it can do a direct comparison of local energy, using the actual cost of gas over the maintenance record and actual cost of electricity where you live. (It's not a small amount of effort, but I'm just adding context to make the point that I expect these numbers are pretty accurate.)
"
"
"
"Taking into account all costs of ownership \*except\* non-routine (accidents), optional (washes and other things like that), retail cost, and depreciation, the ICE vehicle cost me $4300/year to own. Over that same time period, if I'd had the Model 3 instead, it would have cost me $500/year to own.
"
"
"
"Most of those costs are gas for the ICE, and tires + electricity for the Model 3. Also, this picture is skewed quite a lot against the Model 3 because I have solar panels, so I factored in the cost of electricity on my current plan, when I should have factored it in based on the savings I will have from being on the special electric vehicle rate plan my provider offers (and that's assuming my panels don't generate all I need, which I think they will, so really electricity costs are very likely to be $0 for me).
"
"
"
"So my net savings per year owning the Model 3 is likely to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $4K per year.
"
"
"
"I'm also going to be taking tax rebates and credits from federal, state, and my power company in the amount of $10,800.
"
"
"
"Let's say I buy two cars on the same day, a Model 3 and an ICE, both at the exact same price, and let's say they both depreciate 50% over that time. After 5 years, using the above math…
"
"
"
"    Model 3
"
"    - 55,000 (purchase price)
"
"    + 10,800 (tax rebates & credits)
"
"    - 2,500 (annual maintenance + energy of $500 for five years)
"
"    + 22,500 (sold price)
"
"    ————————
"
"    - 24,200 (net cost for five years)
"
"    - 4,840 (net annual cost)
"
"
"
"    ICE
"
"    - 55,000 (purchase price)
"
"    - 21,500 (annual maintenance + gas of $4300 for five years)
"
"    + 22,500 (sold price)
"
"    ————————
"
"    - 54,000 (net cost for five years)
"
"    - 10,800 (net annual cost)
"
"
"
"So owning the Model 3 in place of an equivalently priced ICE nets a savings of $6K per year.
"
"
"
"Or, another way to compare would be to work out how much ICE I could buy if I could only afford to spend what the Model 3 costs. Let's drop the annual costs from $4300 to $3500 to reflect the higher gas mileage a cheaper car is likely to get.
"
"
"
"    Cheap ICE
"
"    - 15,000 (purchase price)
"
"    - 17,500 (annual maintenance + gas of $3500 for five years)
"
"    + 7,500 (sold price)
"
"    ————————
"
"    - 25,000 (net cost for five years)
"
"    - 5,000 (net annual cost)
"
"
"
"Now these are about equal in cost.
"
"
"
"In these comparisons I've not included the cost of installing a HPWC, but it should be clear that that's not going to change the math very much, especially considering it's a one time cost and it's very likely that most houses are going to need this kind of upgrade at some point in the future.""

After including the relatively small amount of maintenance I have done since 2012 it still puts me at close to $20,000CAD in total gas and maintenance expenses since 2012. Also maintenance is cheap and always done by myself. I feel if you went to the mechanic/dealership with my vehicle for routine maintenance, the 1 belt, 2 alternators, a battery, regular oil/filter changes and a couple other things I probably can’t remember you would be over $30,000CAD.

Tesla has one of the lowest per capita, so they are usually cheaper to insure. The reason being, that if insurance has to pay for your injuries and for your disabilities for the next 10-20 years because you were in a car with bad safety, it would be more than any super car or exotic car.

Very interesting videos that go into some of the Gen 3 concepts around battery packs.   There are a variety of other articles that have referenced that the Model 3 has the highest amount of custom Tesla EV parts over their previous models (which leveraged industry available parts more).  Sandy Monroe might have had a few comments about this (and suspension design) and I have seen it in a few articles.  Try again with your Google Fu.  General concept is that previous models provided a lot of lessons learned to build a more EV centric car from the ground up with the Model 3.    More custom Tesla parts and design, less broader industry parts incorporated.  This will be progression that continues with each model release IMO.""

"""So the Performance 3 is roughly the same acceleration as my P85D. The time differences are not detectable without a Dragy or Vbox. However, the P85D had a bit more of a violent launch. The Performance 3 feels software limited at immediate launch.

"
"Range is generally better on a Model 3 because it uses less energy per mile. The Model S 100D is very comparable *but* the Model 3 charges at more miles per hour at the same power/amperage. Again, because it’s more efficient.

"
"So power and range are surely not a downgrade. The only exception being a P100D which is roughly twice the price of a Performance 3. 
"
"
"
"Also, the 3 isn’t as small as one would think. It’s almost deceiving. With the exception of the hatch height, the actual cargo dimensions are only inches different. I believe it even has more headroom in the rear than the S, albeit a little less width (about 3 inches). 
"
"
"
"Meanwhile, the 3 has arguably better headlights, a more efficient UI (in my opinion), more advanced vents, and a cleaner interior design. Not everyone loves it, but I do. The phone docks are in a better place. I like not having an instrument cluster because the view of the road ahead is less obstructed. This is akin to the silence of the motor. Some people like the rumble, but others appreciate the enhanced connection to the road without distractions. I like not needing a keyfob anymore. I have no issues with it working and using a keyfob feels like a step back to me. Why does the Model S still have that open cubby below the screen, for example? I like how AP controls are part of the drive stalk. It makes sense.

"I was considering another S or X and took an overnight test drive last month. Great cars but I couldn’t pull the trigger until they catch up to everything on the 3. And before anyone thinks this is crazy, remember the 3 had lighted vanity mirrors, faster computer/better display, interior camera (for future use) before the Model S. It’s still playing catch-up. Leaked interior images suggest a refreshed interior may take design cues from the 3. I know this is controversial, but I think the 3 interior would some upgraded materials and luxury would go along way on the Model S. Alacantara (hah?), heated/cooled seats with more adjustments and active bolsters, bass shakers in the seat, higher quality stitching, higher quality wood in dash, a better method for attention monitoring (capacitive touch, vision?). Heck, give it a basic HUD. Let me kick under the trunk and frunk to open them. Give the S self-presenting doors.

"
"Keep in mind this is in no way the same as using solar for the day and batteries at night. That isn't what this battery is used for. It's a short term emergency source and a source of frequency control. That is the only reason why the cost is good and as such every country could benefit from a few of them. On the other hand the cost of storing power and supplying all night with a bunch of these tiny 100mw batteries would be extreme. 
"
"""I have some information on the state of the Australian power grid and the Tesla Battery from a """"good source"""".  Here you go.
"
"
"
"The Wind and Solar are """"unscheduled"""" generation they harvest what they can, then pump it into the grid. They bid in at -$1,000 per MWh, meaning that they get first place in the delivery schedule.
"
"The rest of the market has to bid in their capacity for whatever they are prepared to wear price wise, covering the cost of generation, overheads and the like. The market had two peaks, morning and evening like all of them do, and a quite high demand through the day. Solar changed that and started to depress the midday load (the so called """"duck curve""""...see the time of use pricing in Ca and Hawaii for a future prediction...no off peak power at night, cheapest at midday.
"
"The renewables only generate 25-35% of the time (thermal can do it nearly 100%...a unit in my state did 96.4% of it nameplate rating for the entire month of September...wind or solar can only do a third of that.
"
"So as the cheap wind and solar comes in and is bid at -$1,000, South Australia has more than enough green generation that they can, and have covered the entire state load on certain days...bid in at -$1,000. The coal power in that state went first, they couldn't earn enough in the average 24 hour period to remain viable...reneweconomy mag hailed that as their first slain dragon.
"
"Other parts of the requirement for a stable grid are inertia (big spinny things that don't want to slow down when the frequency drops), and governor response, followed by control system response...if a unit trips, or an interconnector goes down, the traditional generation ramps up to keep the frequency stable...he market operator maintained enough spinning reserve to absorb a trip (N-1 contingency), or two (N-2)...in the last few years, we've lost 10 units from the grid. Another 4 go in the next 5 years. In those events, the wind solar just keep doing what they do, oblivious until they reach their frequency limit, then they fall off...aka South Australia Blackout)…
"
"That stuff is FCAS (Frequency Control and Ancilliary Services), and was worth nothing, as the governors of the thermals just did it...we didn't even cover the fuel costs for those MW, as the issue was that the machine would do it automatically, it was for the stability of the grid, so you may as well harvest a few bucks...as the number of schedulable generators dropped, the price for that stability went up. New CCGTs, and the new electronic governors that some stations retrofitted enabled them to turn governor droop off, which they did when they weren't getting paid for it.
"
"SO FCAS prices rose...as they would under market forces.
"
"After the blackout, South Australia installed the """"big battery"""" for an undisclosed sum, for a non transparent pricing mechanism.
"
"
"
"Per “xxxx”  post, it's 100MW, and South Australia is usually around the 1,300MW demand level...it's 130MWh so is about 7-1/2% for an hour and 12 minutes. (*)
"
"It's being bid into the FCAS market as a """"sniper"""", to harvest the initial response, the 6 second market.
"
"The 6 second market has been made so much more important due to the lack of inertia in the system...it rarely exceeded 0.05Hz, now 0.15Hz is extremely regular...frequency and magnitude made it more expensive.
"
"The Tesla Battery is sniping those periods by contributing up to 7MW into those periods.
"
"(*) the battery people are trying to get (and have won) getting the settlement period for bulk power changed from 30 minutes to 5 minutes...the units are dispatched over 5 minute dispatch intervals, and you are paid for the average load at the average price...in a disturbance, the first 5 minutes is the most crucial, as everything re-establishes the new """"norm"""" (power is the epitome of just in time...flick on a light, and the grid responds)...thus they want to be paid for the 5 mins at $14,000/Mwh, and not for the half hour average.
"
"The bit that I underlined...
"
"South Australia is connected to """"dirty brown coalers"""" at the other end of a few interconnectors, has more than enough wind power at their end, which is asynchronous, and unschedulable, to cover the state's bulk power on many days of the year, and are tripling that capacity.

"In order to manage that, the AEMO (market operator) referenced in the article has to make sure that another blackout doesn't occur, so it has to force the gas plants into service to maintain sufficient spinning reserve to stop a frequency crash if the wind stops, big clouds come over, or an interconnector trips.

"
"“Now it seems that AEMO is satisfied that the presence of the Tesla big battery, along with its new system strength rules to ensure a minimum amount of gas generation at any one time, means that it no longer needs to impose the market constraint.”
"
"When it does that, it has to suspend the electricity market for that state, direct the wind farms to shut down (curtail), force the gas plants to operate at below cost. Then it kicks in a 100 day process of modelling what the market would have done if there was no constraint, what the wind generator WOULD have got if they weren't curtailed, what the price would have been IF they didn't have to intervene, and what the gas generator is entitled to in compensation for being forced to operate.

"And the batteries require a gross margin of $250/MWh to amortise their costs over each cycle...(25c/KWh round trip...plus my modelling of the Tesla is that it's losses are around 20%)...S.A. is having a cloudy not very windy day and is sucking 220MW from Victorias brown coalers meaning that their prices are around $100/MWh wholesale on a Saturday morning, with a demand of just under 1,000MW for the state.

"Speaking to an analyst on the cycling of the Tesla barttery, it looks like it's life could be well less than 10 years on that duty cycle.

"Also there is a difference in ROI and Payback period. 4 years is not the ROI, its the payback period to get the entire investment back. These are very different terms and have very different implications. Honestly, the payback period does not tell you much because you have no idea how much you end up making off the investment. For instance, lets assume the payback period for any investment (not just the battery) is 4 years but the assets life itself is 5 years. So if you invested 100 bucks and get 25 each year, you get 100 back in 4 years and a total of 125 on investing 100. That's suddenly not a great investment is it.

"
"No, RenewEconomy hailed the end of the *gas generators* ability to game the FCAS market as the battery's first slain dragon. Generators were contracted by the National Energy Market to reserve 35 MW of reserve capacity for the FCAS market. They agreed to reserve 34 MW with the final 1 MW being auctioned. Whenever that 1 MW was called on, the gas generators would immediately bid the price up to $14,000, a price which then set the price for whole 35 MW. The battery was able to bid in and shut that perfectly legal market manipulation down.

"> the battery people are trying to get (and have won) getting the settlement period for bulk power changed from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
"

"No, that change occurred prior to there being any batteries on the NEM. Proponents for the change to a 5 minute billing settlement period have been working on it for years - in fact long before Tesla even announced the Powerwall and Powerpack product lines. The battery people had nothing to do with the change - if anything, the change doesn't go far enough. Its also worth noting that while the change to 5 minutes has been agreed to, it isn't enforced yet. The market is still on 30 minutes because the poor old legacy generators reckon they need at least 3 years to write new software.

"I still think that there is room for ancillary energy services more than 6 minute and 30 minute reserves. Sub millisecond supply / shedding / load could contribute a lot to stability particularly when so much of the grid load could be smart & responsive with no user impact. 
"
"
"
"There could also be an amount of onus on the non schedulable generation to provide there own storage & stability. Currently there is little penalty if as a generator you drop off the grid, this has real cost to the grid to provide for the contingency. Yet they can still sell their power for the lowest cleared bid. Should their unschedulable power be a different energy product?
"
"
"
"I also see a problem where without a large spinning reserve the grid frequency could be an unreliable measure of grid under/over supply. You could end up in a situation where under over frequency oscillations happen if you have too much ultra fast response.

"""So to maintain an emergency supply for the grid typically a coal or natural gas plant would sit ready to supply. That is a whole plant with a bunch of people doing nothing. When you replace all of that with a tiny battery like this there is a savings. That isn't the same as replacing a continuously operating plant. Let's say you wanted to replace a 100 mw coal plant with solar and batteries. You would just need a 100 mw solar plant right? No of course not. Most solar has a capacity around 30 percent so you would need 3 to 4 100 mw solar plants to replace one coal plant. This actually isn't too bad of a deal when considered in a mw for mw way but now we need a battery to cover the night. So we build 100 mw batteries. How many? Well at bare minimum we have to cover the 70 percent of time that solar isn't active. That is about 16 hours and since we want to produce 100 mw every hour we would need 16 of these tesla batteries. I keep hearing different numbers for how much they cost but it's somewhere between 50 and 90 million each. So we took a situation where the solar cost is breaking even with coal and we added over a billion in cost. That is why these situations are in no way the same. Every time this gets posted people think that it means batteries are financially feasible but that isn't yet the case except in emergency and frequency control situations where the amount of energy stored and supplied is less important than the speed at which it is supplied.

The Tesla battery allows the wind power at Hornsdale to also play in the """"fill in the gap"""" market faster then the gas generators can react which allows them to control that portion of the market too so the gas generators don't get to price gouge because they can't even compete.

"That's what I keep saying!!!!
"
"Seems to be a pretty common thing (someone already pointing it out earlier).
"
"""We own the only one in town, with the next closest being 100kms away. It’s so rare we see another one that we get super excited! ""
"
""">  he once got to 30, which was as high as he could count at the time.
"
"
"
"aww that's so sweet""
"
"""You wouldn't say it was crazy if it was Toyota or Honda though. It's not actually crazy, rather it is progress. Crazy is how many Tesla's are in Norway. Every other car there is a Tesla. Even in the US if 50% of all cars were Toyotas it would be pretty weird too. Even in Japan it's not 50% because there are plenty of domestic brands that sell in volume there (obviously).""
"
"yeah just drive with one hand up around 11 o'clock and raise a couple of fingers at the other car.  motorcycle riders have been doing this for decades
"
"""Dallas here, I see one on every trip at least. Once you start visiting the superchargers you will see how common they are becoming.""
"
"Houston - I see about 3/4 on my commute and I live outside the city. 
"
"""Yup!  Mostly older jeeps right?  Like, i dont see people in renegades or liberties doing this?""
"
"it still is a thing for motorcycles in most areas. I see it all the time.
"
"I know my man will see this and he will deliver 
"
"""Yes, but he also makes a different reddit for every AMA so I'm guessing hes lurking with a different account. ""
"
"not if it's daytime lights!
"
"There's an apptermarket for that. 
"
"""Personally drive a Grand Cherokee, but XJs and Wranglers are the only ones who wave back. Occasionally I'll get a trailhawk of any type to waive, but most of the time peopke just think I'm crazy.""
"
"That comment is not-so fire
"
"Right? I see more CJ7s than teslas where I live. 
"
"""Again, I drive a Jeep. And I definitely see quite a few on longer drives. But in 2-3 years if tesla continues to ramp like they are they’re gonna pass wranglers on the streets in no time""
"
"It isn’t a anything but wrangler thing. Even S/X owners have said they rarely get waves anymore
"
"""Yeah, it's bittersweet. I'm sad that people don't wave anymore. But it also means that Tesla's vision, as a whole, is becoming more and more successful. ""
"
"Go in a double date with a friend who owns a Tesla. Ask them to let your wife sit in the passenger seat. Will be head over heels for one after you show all of the convenience features.
"
"""Stories like these feel so unreal. I can’t go for a drive without meeting at least one Tesla (and that would have to be like 1-2 km max). Obviously I live in Norway outside of Oslo, where the Tesla density is unreal, but even when I visit my parents which live about 600km away (375 miles) there’s plenty. 
"
"
"
"My brother-in-law had a visit from someone he knew from the US. I don’t remember which state they lived in, but apparently they had never seen a Tesla before they got here. ""
"
"""I don’t know, it’s pretty crazy. The average price of a Toyota isn’t north of $80k. 
"
"
"
"In Norway they’re cheaper than their gas competitors. There it makes sense. ""
"
"""You most commonly see it with Wranglers, but [the jeep community encourages all jeep owners to wave](.""
"
"Honestly if you page him on Twitter he’s likely to respond
"
"""FYI, your username works out to about 1/5 the power of your average commercial nuclear reactor. ""
"
"I'd be first in our friends group to make the transformation. I've gone by the dealer a few times cause I work near one and I've test driven them a few times. The dealer offered to let me do an overnight but I'd be buying a used one and I'm nervous to have such an expensive car I can't afford in my driveway haha. I need to drag her to the dealership. I'm about a year out from my next car so I've got time to work on her.
"
"""Never said it was?
"
"
"
"Just not sure why you linked to a Tesla forum post from 2017 about it lol.
"
"
"
"A text post with a story would have made more sense I guess.""
"
"""If anyone comes up to us and asks about the car (especially when our five kids pile out of the falcon doors), we’ll talk to them as long as possible, show them around the car, and if appropriate give them a drive then around. Share the “Tesla love”.  ;)

"""I always thought it was funny that the nominal output of Limerick Nuclear was almost exactly 1.21 Gigawatts, which Doc Brown needed to power his time machine in Back to the Future. ""
"
"""Wrong industry, but yeah. I’m way too sensitive. ""
"
"""I'm no back to the future expert but I wonder if they based that number on the reactor. Or if they chose it because it had a good ring to it.

"
"
"One way or another his pronunciation confused me for *years*. I always thought his """"jiggawatts"""" was a made up unit. ""

"I doubt there was any connection. Just used to amuse me that my dad would show me daily logs listing the output of Limerick at like 1.217 GW or 1.223 GW or whatever.
