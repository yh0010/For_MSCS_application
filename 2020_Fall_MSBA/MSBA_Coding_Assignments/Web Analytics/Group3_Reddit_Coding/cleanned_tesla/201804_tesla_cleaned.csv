"
"""There are no hard rules about anything in personal finance because everything depends on the what you're paying in terms of interest and what you're making on your investments.
"
"
"
"As far as your mortgage interest goes, depending on your exact situation and other writeoffs, it may or may not make sense to pay it off. With the new tax laws chances are that you're not able to actually fully take advantage of your mortgage interest deduction much anyways, so it becomes more beneficial to pay it off than it used to be. But as others point out it may still make sense to max out retirement accounts first if you believe that these accounts will gain more than the interest on your home. With the tax law changes this may not be the case actually, since the standard deduction will go up considerably so very few people are likely to be paying enough mortgage interest to benefit significantly (since your benefit is the difference between the standard deduction and the itemized amount-chances are that it's going to be a small difference). So if you're paying 4% or something right now it may actually be hard to gain enough in your retirement accounts on an annualized basis to make up for this, especially since a dollar saved tends to be more valuable than a dollar earned due to taxation. 
"
"
"
"Of course I personally break a lot of these rules, I never max out my work related tax deferred retirement accounts (though I do still put a significant amount [about 14K] to obtain the maximum match from my workplace). Primarily this is because I want to invest the money more flexibly and in relatively exotic ways and plan on needing to access it for a much earlier for retirement than most of these plans allow. I do put money into a backdoor Roth IRA on an annual basis, however and I do recommend that everyone stash money in one as well-it can be helpful if you come across a high return investment that you're very confident about due to the lack of taxes on the back end. I also still keep debt around that I could pay off just to give myself more liquidity to work with. And I invested a lot of the money I did have in what normal people considered to be rather insane things-high risk businesses as well as cryptocurrency but obviously the crypto bet has paid off many, many, times over. Of course, I could afford to take these bets since I knew I could bounce back even from a complete loss on all these investments pretty easily. I wouldn't suggest that anybody take the same risks unless they were pretty certain a loss wouldn't be devastating. But half my family are high level investment professionals and doing complex and bizarre investment strategies is essentially a genetic trait in my family, so this kind of thing is really only for lunatics like us.""

"
"
"
"PR has a peak demand of [3,685 MW and an annual generation of 19.43 TWh](.  Battery systems obviously don't have to match full grid output; at the very most they only need to handle peak power of ~50% and average power of ~30%, assuming you had a grid powered entirely by solar and wind.  To avoid problems like PR's cascade failure today, you just need to shift load enough to keep the generation stable.  5-10% is more than enough for most disasters- brownouts can start happening at under 1% of instability, so you really don't need a crazy amount of storage to make huge differences in people's lives.  A grid battery can hold off a blackout long enough to do a lot of good.
"
"
"
"Each powerpack can peak at 50 kW, so 1-10% load handling is 737 to 7370 powerpacks, for ~60 million to 600 million USD.  That's also 155 to 1,550 MWh of storage, enough to bring power to tens of thousands of people for an extra day or two.  That's chump change compared to the cost of rebuilding the island.  Hell, the disgustingly corrupt contracts with [Whitefish and Mammoth Energy Services](.  It's graft at its most blatant- the company is named after Zinke's hometown.""

They quickly started shipping Powerwalls, their home energy storage solution, and we reported that they started shipping Powerpacks, their bigger commercial and utility-scale battery packs.

"

"
"
"
"> musk/status/986746909153869824
"
"
"
"> As we previously reported, some of those locations include very critical services.
"
"
"
"> For example, Tesla deployed a series of Powerpack systems on the Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra for a sanitary sewer treatment plant, the Arcadia water pumping station, the Ciudad Dorada elderly community, the Susan Centeno hospital, and the Boys and Girls Club of Vieques.
"
"
"
"> Furthermore, the automaker’s energy division also deployed a solar+battery system at a hospital in Puerto Rico.
"
"
"
"> Tesla shipped a few hundred more Powerwalls to Puerto Rico and sent technicians from all over the US to install them.
"
"
"
"> According to Musk, the effort resulted in 662 projects and there are more underway.
"
"
"
"I wasn't asking about *microgrids*, which appear to be in the planning phase:
"
"
"
"> Electrek’s Take
"
"
"
"> It’s fun to see energy storage at work to respond to emergency situations like this one, but it’s now clear that Puerto Rico needs a better long-term solution to their energy grid problems.
"
"
"
"> It was also reported that the Puerto Rican government was considering Tesla’s plan for a series of microgrids to help bring back power on a larger scale. The government has confirmed that they “presented several projects in remote areas that would allow entire communities to be more independent” and they also “presented a proposal to the Authority for Public-Private Partnerships for the deployment of a large-scale battery system designed to help stabilize the entire Puerto Rico electricity network.”

One point I was making is that the element of luck affects our potential other Musks. It was not pre-ordained that Musk's ventures would pay off when they did. If one venture failed, Musk would learn from it and build something else, and then something else. He wouldn't stop, but if it took him until his 60's to build his fortune, then things today would be very different. That's sub-optimal and presumably it is happening right now to another potential Elon Musk.

I'm not even really talking about Musk himself (let alone impugning him) I'm talking about obstacles to our best that we maybe should want to diminish. Some people see success despite the vagaries of the market as a valuable filter of merit, but judging the people I've met ranging from paupers to billionaires, I just don't see it as particularly effective in that role.

"
"""I'm seeing some comments asking why this happens, so I'm copying and slightly editing my comment from when one of these kind of photos was posted a month or so ago.
"
"
"
"Basically, Tesla is putting a coating on their glass roofs that reflects IR to reduce heat inside (maybe UV too?), but lets through visible light. This is called a [dielectric mirror](, or dichroic filter, or interference filter. It's made up of a number of thin, alternating layers of 2 materials with different refractive indices. You can tune the wavelengths that they reflect and transmit by changing the materials and thus their refractive indices as well as by changing the layer thicknesses.
"
"
"
"Normally, you can't really tell that there is a coating on the glass, as it is reflecting wavelengths outside our visible range which you can't see, so it just looks like normal glass. However, when water (or some other liquid) is sitting on the surface of the glass, water has a different refractive index than air so it changes the optical properties of the coating and will then start to reflect different wavelengths.
"
"
"
"If I remember correctly, water should shift it to shorter wavelengths, and thus a coating that was reflecting IR will now be reflecting in the visible. In addition, dielectric mirrors have an angle dependence to them, so you will see different colors at different angles and thus the rainbow type effect. This is the same principle that makes those color shift pigments/paints work that you sometimes see on cars, printed on currency, etc.
"
"
"
"Hope this makes sense, let me know if I can clarify anything.
"
"
"
"TLDR: optical coating on the glass roof that reflects infrared to reduce heat gets changed by water on the surface, starts reflecting visible light instead""
