"
"
"
"Also, to further help you make the distinction between """"Marketing"""" and """"Advertising"""":
"
"
"
"**Marketing** refers to the activities of a company associated with buying and selling a product or service. It includes advertising, selling and ***delivering products*** to people.
"
"
"
"**Advertising** is a marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, non-personal message to ***promote or sell a product, service or idea.*** Sponsors of advertising are typically businesses wishing to promote their products or services.
"
"
"
"As you can see, advertising falls under marketing. Most importantly, the logistics cost of the insane number of Model 3 deliveries fall under marketing costs as well. I suspect that alone is a significant portion of the $65.5M on the 10-K filing.
"
"
"
"To be fair, I can see how Elon's tweet can be confusing. It should've read:
"

"\> Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no **advertising**, no paid endorsements & no discounts. Competitors spent billions on **advertising**. Model 3 was product alone.

"
"\> Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no **advertising**, no paid endorsements & no discounts. Competitors spent billions on **marketing**. Model 3 was product alone.

"The tweet is still technically correct since advertising is a subcategory of marketing. Elon is a smart guy and probably assumed most people will know the difference. I mean, a quick Google search should inform people the difference between the two.""
"
"""Actually they stopped taking new reservations in July. So a good chunk of the Q3 sales were new orders based on word of mouth from people who got their cars through reservations. And that word of mouth will continue to spread as more and more people get their hands on Teslas and their friends see how awesome they are.
"
"
"
"Will that translate to as many sales in Q3 2019 as it did in Q3 2018? Who knows, but I'd bet it'll be a good sight better than most of Wall Street seems to think.""
"
"""Agreed, but I think this actually speaks to the desirability of the car. People waited 2+ years to get the car after putting down a deposit. Then, after delivery, virtually nobody has any major issues with the car and most absolutely love it. More to your point, it's also important to recognize that these sales were only for about 7\12 months ish. I imagine with the 35k model plus the fact that it's just basically the best car you can buy, future sales will be relatively similar. ""
"
"""As they said in the Q3 call with standard range variant and word of mouth etc. they expect rather reasonable that current sales rate will continue for just NA marked only meaning Asia orders will not likely ship in 2019 unless they can do significant work from giga 3 in China. 
"
"
"
"Orders might actually still be more than capacity when they start delivery in Europe given the long outlook for a giga in Europe that can do more than just maybe save a little assembly. Think current plant in Holland to get around import fee's to EU actually adds a little work at US producing sites. Considering EU marked as they state are about twice the size than US/NA there is going to be a lot of demand despite we are more price sensitive in most countries (except Norwegian olie baronesses) and have local brand loyalty to local or EU products. Marked size here makes sense due to we don't have pickups and consider the model 3 a large car - S being too large for most. VW Up!, VW Golf, Volvo stationcar, BMW3 series or a Nissan QASHQAI is where its at here. Y size hatch back is really what most of us Euro's want but we can't wait. Model 3 trade in to Y could be a big deal.""

"Hardly a paid advertisement. 
"
"Yeah. I wonder when someone will offer one.

That's the value that's lost when you buy it.

Now, you need to also pay for marketing materials like pamphlets and booklets to hand out at events, the color coordinated table cloths with the napkins and flowers at an event the company is hosting.

"What does Tesla do that's marketing and not advertising? That's a good question but I've never seen a Tesla ad on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TV, browsing online, or at the bus stop.

However, Marketing would be responsible for how those Instagram posts are worded, perhaps even how the images are ordered in a single post.

"""What's to stop Tesla from doing the same thing. Using an example of a time that the system broke as a reason is, frankly, rhetoric at best. What happens if Tesla has some problem that gets out to the public that they have no idea how to deal with? 
"
"
"
"Saying that the dealership system is broken because the manufacturer made a fuck-up and told everyone something different as to what to do and didn't bother giving out any official procedure is like when news said electric cars caught fire easily after they tested the Chevy Volt for crashes and let it sit out in the rain without disconnecting batteries for weeks on end. 
"
"
"
"And, if I am completely honest, I doubt that Tesla would have any clue how to deal with a major hardware recall, especially as long as Musk stays CEO. Musk is wonderful as a visionary, as someone who overworks his employees into Innovation. But I doubt that he has the experience necessary to deal with a major recall of a physical product. 
"
"
"
"What if it turns out there was a bad weld on one of the columns in the Model 3? This has happened for other major car companies post shipping. But since post shipping they went to a dealership, the car company could have the dealership deal with the weld and fix it. But if it goes direct to consumer it would be a logistical nightmare, as that process would take several hours to complete, and the cars are unsafe to drive until such a point.
"

"Basically, the dealership is a safety net, and I think it's exactly what someone who has no experience with working with mass market physical products needs if there ever is a problem.

It's the reason I have a Bolt now. I'd love a model 3, but if there's something majorly wrong with them, something that can't be fixed with a software patch, which is entirely possible for a large volume manufacturer, especially one buying 3rd party components for things like airbags, I have no confidence in my ability to get it fixed.""

"
""">Do you know why cars lose so much value the minute you drive them off the lot? They actually don't, they just lose the dealer's markup and revert to a value just below the manufacturer's value. When you go to a dealership and see a car worth $60,000, the true manufacturer's value of the car may only be $50,000, but the dealership tagged on an extra $10,000 so they can make a profit. That's the value that's lost when you buy it.
"
"
"
"There's a bit more to it than that, let's hope that's not true. Because with Tesla's having a 20%+ profit margin, let's hope it doesn't depreciate 20% just driving off the lot.
"

">Dealers have to add on a lot of extra money because they're insular (separate administrative and financial structures) and they have a very small market of people they can reach.

"
"
"
"What? lol 
"
"
"
">Contrast that with Tesla, who's able to streamline a lot of the leadership overhead. Not to mention that a more-successful store can help make up for a less-successful store, and prices can be more stable and standard across the country.
"
"
"
"The difference with Tesla is you are ALWAYS\* paying MSRP, which has a 20%+ profit margin, if Tesla reporting is to be believed. What """"leadership overhead"""" are you referring to? If Tesla has unsuccessful stores I would expect them to shut them down, not keep them open, just like in a traditional model. There is nothing to gain by letting your winning dealerships offset your losing.
"
"
"
"\* Unless you strike a deal on a demo or get incentivized like some others on an S or X.
"
"
"
">And finally there's the online store (I'm actually not sure if the physical stores even sell anything directly, I've always heard they direct customers to the online site), and now you can reach people around the world with minimal added cost. 
"
"
"
"You can order online with many manufacturers. You still end up doing paperwork through a dealership, but it can all be done via email and mailed documents, much like Tesla does. I've bought a couple cars this way. There ARE a few more documents than when buying a Tesla remotely, but it's not nearly as painful as people make it out to be. 
"
"
"
">And finally, Tesla's markup will be much more similar to a regular manufacturer's markup above the actual cost of the raw materials (or however they buy them). Again this is because of a unified, streamlined leadership and administrative infrastructure, as well as having the ability to balance out gains and losses across large areas.
"
"
"
"That's just not true. Tesla proudly boasts it's profit margin (markup) being 20%+ on their cars. Traditional manufacturer margins are much lower. Again, Tesla proudly boasts this. 
"
"
"
"> So when you drive a Tesla off the lot, it still loses some of its value, but not nearly as much as one bought from a 3rd-party dealership would. That's essential to allowing Tesla to be competitive and still grow.
"
"
"
"That's not why. Tesla's retain value currently because of supply and demand. The 3 is still a relatively hard car to get, so prices will be higher than if there were a million of them on the road. As Tesla increases volume you will see that curve adjust. You can see similar deprecation curves on other hard-to-get vehicles that aren't Teslas.

A group of dealerships owned by disparate people\entities is a monopoly, but bunch of """"sales centers"""" owned by a single person\entity is NOT a monopoly? lol Talk about Mental Gymnastics.
"
" 
"
" The laws were put in place to prevent manufacturers from putting 3rd party dealerships out of business by competing directly with them and undermining them because they can cut cost more effectively. Tesla isn't the first manufacturer who has wanted to do manufacturer owned dealerships. Dealerships were originally created to take on the risk of actually selling inventory. Ford wanted to produce cars, and during hard times if they did it direct, they were on the hook for EVERYTHING. If they created franchises, they could force dealers to buy from them, and then the risk of sale was on the franchise, not Ford. The dealership model insulates the manufacturer from a lot of the sales risk.

"""There are pros and cons. From a consumer perspective, multiple independent dealerships vastly increases competition compared to dealing directly with the manufacturer. That means each dealer has incentive to have better customer service, lower margins, etc. in order to pull market share from their competitors. On the other hand, there is a second layer of profit to consider, so the potential is there for getting worse prices than you might from the manufacturer (this assumes that the manufacturer sells cars at wholesale rates to dealers that leave dealers with room to make their own profit). I tend to think that Tesla is selling cars at what would be the retail price, rather than the wholesale price, and just taking more profit per unit. 
"
"
"
"From a manufacturer perspective, selling to dealers means that you have much less volatility in sales. The dealers need to have about 60 days’ worth of inventory on hand at all times, which means the number of cars the manufacturer is getting paid for each month is relatively constant, despite any fluctuations in consumer purchasing. In a direct sale model, the manufacturer bears that risk. Which means when Tesla sells over 9000 cars in December 2017 and only 3400 cars in January 2018, its cashflows suffer. 
"
"
"
"Related is the issue of leasing. A manufacturer that sells to dealers doesn’t have to deal with off-lease vehicles, since that’s the dealer’s problem. Tesla has an ever-growing number of used cars that are coming back from lease as seriously depreciated assets. Plus, given the speed at which improvements are made in electric vehicles in general and Tesla’s practice of continual improvement rather than model-year improvement, a used Tesla is outdated that much quicker.

"LOL yeah what is this guy on about? EVs don't need maintenance? They still have everything a regular gas-powered vehicle has except the engine.
"
"""> Curious, how is this different from Tesla's current model? 
"
"
"
"Unlike every other manufacturer, Tesla doesn't sell their cars to dealerships, who them go on to sell them to owners. They sell directly to owners, cutting out the middleman.
"
"
"
"Traditional manufacturer make *their* profit from the sale to the dealership, and then the dealership has to make a profit. A small amount of that dealership profit comes from the sale of the vehicle, and a much much larger amount of that profit comes from maintenance. So dealerships don't want to sell EVs, because they see a much smaller profit-per-car than they see from ICE cars.
"
"
"
"Tesla makes ~30% net profit on each sale of Model S and X (something like $30,000+ per car), and then charges (I believe) around $800 per [maintenance visit](. They don't earn $800 on each visit, though, since they need to pay the staff and buy/make any replacement parts, so I'm not sure what the margins are.
"
"
"
"> Proof of that (low EV maintenance cost)? I hear this over and over again. Oil changes, etc.
"
"
"
"EVs' advantage in terms of maintenance aren't just from lack of oil changes. The electric drivetrain is just vastly less prone to wear and tear than the ICE drivetrain. The entire reason that ICE cars need scheduled maintenance every 6 months is because they break down over time due to all those explosions in the engine, all the air pollutants getting into the engine from the outside, and the complex undercarriage mechanisms necessary to drive the wheels from the engine that's up front.
"
"
"
"EVs, though, place the motor directly between the wheels, vastly simplifying the drivetrain. They also don't need to be aspirated, so air contaminants don't get into the mechanisms and gum them up over time (air flows over the battery pack to help cool it, but it doesn't get *into* the battery pack or drivetrain). They don't have explosions going off inside them all the time, so the hardware doesn't break down at anywhere near the same speed as an ICE car.
"
"
"
"As an example, Tesla recently finished a 1,000,000 mile test for their Model 3 drivetrain. The motor and gearing system finished that test looking essentially brand new. No ICE car could possibly pull that off.
"
"
"
"Now, on to the real killer stat for why the Model 3 is so much cheaper to own than an equivalent ICE car: the maintenance schedule. The Owner's Manual says you need to do only 3 things to maintain your Model 3:
"
"
"
"1. Rotate the tires every 6250 miles. Approximately once every six months, though many people do it at 12500, instead. This costs between $25-50 depending on where you get it done. All cars are supposed to do this, so it's a wash in price comparison.
"
"
"
"2. Replace the break fluid every 2 years or 25,000 miles. Price unknown, as almost no one's done it yet.
"
"
"
"3. Replace the battery coolant every 4 years or 50,000 miles. Price unknown.
"
"
"
"That's IT. Scheduled maintenance happens only once every **2 years**, and only requires fluid replacement. They don't expect the Model 3's mechanisms to break down over time at all, because they're all sealed inside the system and not susceptible to pollutant ingress or explosion fatigue.
"
"
"
"> The type of maintenance will change, but it's not like service departments will go bankrupt.
"
"
"
"Who said anything about service departments going bankrupt? I just said they'll make less money from EVs, which discourages dealerships from selling them.
"
"
"
"> If this were the case there wouldn't be queues to get into service at Tesla.
"
"
"
"The lines to get into service at Tesla are not primarily for scheduled maintenance. Tesla still has issues with reliability, so a lot of the work their service centers are doing are for correcting fit-and-finish and doing other warranty work, as opposed to maintenance (which isn't covered under warranties).

"""Companies can and should be able to sell their own products. A cartel of third party sellers banding together to affect laws to ensure someone in their market can't sell directly or not sell through them, isn't good. Sorry. Anti-trust laws aren't meant only to stop single entities from dominating or controlling an industry or area of competiton, but also groups that are toxicly affecting such, by broadly ensuring any competition or other methodology literally just isn't even allowed or possible. Obviously I'm speaking generally, and not every dealership is actively pushing this sort of thing. But do they actively benefit from them, and there are those that do actively push that kind of agenda. That's why there are laws in states that basically make it illegal to sell any other way. Which is ridiculous, and in no way merely provides protections to these third party dealers, but instead actively ensures literally no other competition is viable. You see similar things occuring with stuff like Taxis and communications networks and the like, where laws aren't often just strict, but actively prohibitively punitive not merely to ensure competition and safety, but instead to ensure a certain entrenched group or interest can't receive any fresh competition.

I guess you didn't read that post. I'm curious though. What service do ICE cars need every 6 months?  Also front engine fwd cars require no """"complex undercarriage mechanisms"""" just a flywheel clutch\torque converter, transmission, and axles. Many of which are SHARED by Teslas. Front-rear cars have very moderately higher complexity in that they have driveshafts. It's a rod with two u-joints. Nothing massively complex there. 
"
"
"
"You don't think Tesla has anything complex in it's cars? You vastly underestimate the engineering and systems that have to work perfectly for your car to drive. They have less parts on a piece of paper, they aren't less complex. Big difference.

"You said Tesla has a 30% margin on their car. They could sacrifice 6% of that and offload a LOT of risk on to dealers if they went traditional. They'd take a 24% margin and get rid of a lot of risk. I don't understand how a dealer will have any less of a margin on an EV vs an ICE if Teslas margins are supposedly highest in the industry. It makes 0 sense. Margins on ICE car sales are much lower than what Tesla gets.

"Regarding service profit. To replace a door handle on a model s costs $1k. It's MAYBE $25 in parts, and an hour labor. Tell me there isn't profit baked in. Elon has already said there is.

""""Air contaminants"""" into the engine of ICE vehicles are caught by the filter, if gets past the filter it's burned up.

"
">They don't have explosions going off inside them all the time, so the hardware doesn't break down at anywhere near the same speed as an ICE car.

"
"
"
"No disagreement there. Here's the thing though, when you setup a franchise you are making certain promises, and shucking certain risks onto third parties. I fully understand why 3rd party dealers are pissed Tesla can come in without a franchise model. I also understand why Tesla wants the right to do direct to consumer sales. There are real people tied to these policies, it's not a simple matter. 
"
"
"
">A cartel of third party sellers banding together to affect laws to ensure someone in their market can't sell directly or not sell through them, isn't good.
"
"
"
"Oh they are a """"cartel"""" now, we moved from a anthropomorhized super-monopoly to a cartel of thousands of independent owners. How is Tesla pushing their weight around any different than the """"cartels"""" protecting what they've built over the years?

"
"
">Sorry. Anti-trust laws aren't meant only to stop single entities from dominating or controlling an industry or area of competiton, but also groups that are toxicly affecting such, by broadly ensuring any competition or other methodology literally just isn't even allowed or possible.
"
"
"
"It's antitrust. I'm struggling to figure out how a group of owners of 3rd party dealerships who COMPETE against eachother for sales daily is worthy of labeling as """"anti-trust"""" in your words. No one is telling Tesla they can't sell cars, or making it supremely difficult. Tesla could EASILY sell cars in all 50 states, they just don't like how the laws that are on the books. There is nothing illegal with what is happening.
"
"
"
"> Obviously I'm speaking generally, and not every dealership is actively pushing this sort of thing.
"
"
"
"Not just generally, incorrectly.
"
"
"
">That's why there are laws in states that basically make it illegal to sell any other way. 
"
"
"
"It was for protection of the franchisees. Franchise law isn't exclusive to auto, either.
"
"
"
">You see similar things occuring with stuff like Taxis and communications networks and the like, where laws aren't often just strict, but actively prohibitively punitive not merely to ensure competition and safety, but instead to ensure a certain entrenched group or interest can't receive any fresh competition.
"
"
"
"I think there are side effects, but you over simplify the reason for the creation of these laws. 
"
"
"
"> There's nothing capitalistic, fair, or reasonably competitive about that. It's just blocking reasonable legitimate competition and other methods, and stagnates an industry.
"
"
"
"If they are abiding by the law, it's legal. Pretty simple. If anyone was doing anything illegal to force Tesla to not sell cars, it'd have been settled by now. If you want Tesla to sell cars without franchises, then you have to change the law. The fact those who are protected are contesting that is no surprise, that's democracy.
"
"
"
">Also, I'm not the the one anthropomorphizing these companies? You, literally are, right after accusing me of that? 
"
"
"
"You called dealerships a monopoly. The only way you can do that is by anthropomorphizing them.
"

"
"

"
"

"
"

"It's not even arguable, it's completely beside the point. Even if I DID have a stake (I don't) doesn't mean that what I say is worth any less. Tesla has a stake in allowing direct to consumer sales, should we discount what they have to say too?""

But once again, Tesla can't settle for impressive, it has to be the best ever, regardless of the truth of it.  It's awfully hard to like Tesla when they keep pulling this crap.  It's a lot of borderline true or technically true statements that are specifically designed to mislead people who don't know better.
"
"
"
"Right off the bat, they lead with [this chart.](  I'm not aware of any retests of the Model S, so why has the probability of injury changed?  Even assuming all the data is accurate, the scaling is incredibly misleading.  It starts at 5% and tops out at 8% to exaggerate the difference as much as possible.  According to Tesla, 10% is considered 5 stars by the NHTSA.  The only reason to stop the scaling at 8% is to try and exaggerate the difference as much as possible.
"
"
"
"Then on to the usual list of big terms that laymen don't know that sound super impressive:
"
"
"
">In addition to its near 50/50 weight distribution, Model 3 was also designed with an extremely low polar moment of inertia, which means that its heaviest components are located closer to the car’s center of gravity. Even though Model 3 has no engine, its performance is similar to what’s described as a “mid-engine car” due to its centered battery pack (the heaviest component of the car) and the fact that Model 3’s rear motor is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather than behind it. Not only does this architecture add to the overall agility and handling of the car, it also improves the capability of stability control by minimizing rotational kinetic energy.
"
"
"
"50/50 weight distribution isn't uncommon.  Describing the Model 3's polar moment of inertia as """"extremely low"""" is exaggerating, to say the least.  Some [napkin math]( will show you that Tesla wildly exaggerates how low the polar moment of inertia is compared to competitors.  It's nowhere near a mid-engine car.  Although it sure does sound impressive when they say it minimizes rotational kinetic energy, just repeat that to your friends and you'll sound super smart!  And then possibly my favorite part:
"
"
"
">Here, you can see how the orange internal combustion engine block is thrust towards the cabin during a frontal impact test:
"
"
"
"That's not the engine.  That's the transmission.
"
"
"
"Then onto more listing fairly standard features.  Pretensioners and load limiters, specially shaped airbags, collapsible steering column, knee airbags, etc, before another of my favorite parts:
"
"
"
">These structures continue to be effective even when a front motor is added for Model 3 Dual-Motor All-Wheel Drive, due to the fact that the subframe is designed to pull the nose of the motor down and out of the way.
"
"
"
"That's exactly what the subframe is designed to do on every modern ICE car.  You can even see it in action on the A4 in the clip Tesla included.
"
"
"
"And last but not least, rollovers.  Rollovers are a serious problem, despite making up just 2% of crashes, they make up 35% of fatalities.  However, of those fatalities, [70% weren't wearing seatbelts](  That's not to say rollovers aren't a problem, but if you're wearing your seatbelt in a modern car with a good rollover rating, you have other things to worry about.
"
"
"
"As far as the actual numbers they give, they put a whole lot of emphasis on being able to hold four times its own weight.  That's around the same value as the Model S which was touted as """"breaking the testing machine"""".  It's also not a very impressive figure if you compare it to competitors instead of the baseline requirements.  The A4 manages more than five times its own weight, and the C-class manages seven times its own weight.  The IIHS results will be very interesting, to say the least.  I'm sticking with what I said before: knocks NHTSA tests out of the park, but can't get Top Safety Pick with the IIHS.
"
"
"
"And last but certainly not least:
"
"
"
">Many companies try to build cars that perform well in crash tests, and every car company claims their vehicles are safe. But when a crash happens in real life, these test results show that if you are driving a Tesla, you have the best chance of avoiding serious injury.
"
"
"
"This is the kind of sanctimonious bullshit that makes people hate Tesla.  Especially because of the blatant hypocrisy.  Tesla built the Model S to perform well in the NHTSA tests, and the IIHS and Euro NCAP results show that.  When the IIHS raised the issue of small overlap crashes, and even *gave Tesla a redo*, Tesla responded by trying to smear them as biased.  If you really gave a shit about real-world safety, you wouldn't be trying to smear a group dedicated to improving real-world safety because they didn't just give you the score you wanted.
"
"
"
"These test results don't show you have the safest cars.  They just show that you built another car around this one specific test so you can brag about it and get some more attention.""
"
"I should be able to afford one by the year 2048 or so. haha

"Can't wait for the Euro NCAP numbers.

"By not having an engine way out front and a gas tank way out back, and by having so much weight right in the middle of the car, the momentum of losing control (twisting) is much easier for the stability control to counteract.  This means it is much harder to oversteer/spin out, lose control and have an accident in the first place.  This is not captured by the NHTSA safety ratings directly, but shows that Tesla is engineering for safety even if they won't get direct credit for it with stars in a crash test.  There are likely dozens of other small/minor design decisions that improve safety that are hard to capture in a press release.  It shows where Tesla has its priorities - safety is first.

Rigidity means the energy from deceleration is entirely transferred to the occupants and their internal organs may be ripped apart.
"
"
"
"In the Volvo XC90, the car's sides also have a crumple zone. To facilitate that with the limited width available (as defined by traffic lane constraints), the seats have a kind of forced sliding mechanism. In case of sideways crash the seats are dragged inwards so the pax may collide with each other, but flash is soft so injuries won't be grave. The space thus vacated at the chassis' side is sacrificed in a pre-arranged crumple pattern to dissipate energy.

"> You all know about the Darwin Awards – it's the annual honor given to the person who did the gene pool the biggest service by killing themselves in the most extraordinarily stupid way. Last year's winner was the fellow who was killed by a Coke machine which toppled over on top of him as he was attempting to tip a free soda out of it.
"
"> 
"
"> And this year's nominee is:

"
"> The Arizona Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex of a curve. the wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The lab finally figured out what it was and what had happened.
"
"> 
"
"> It seems that a guy had somehow gotten hold of a JATO unit (Jet Assisted Take Off – actually a solid fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy military transport planes an extra 'push' for taking off from short airfields. He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert and found a long, straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed and fired off the JATO!
"
"> 
"
"> The facts, as best could be determined, are that the operator of the 1967 Impala hit JATO ignition at a distance of approximately 3.0 miles from the crash site. This was established by the prominent scorched and melted asphalt at that location. The JATO, if operating properly, would have reached maximum thrust within five seconds, causing the Chevy to reach speeds well in excess of 350 MPH, continuing at full power for an additional 20–25 seconds. The driver, soon to be pilot, most likely would have experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting F-14 jocks under full afterburners, basically causing him to become insignificant for the remainder of the event. However, the automobile remained on the straight highway for about 2.5 miles (15–20 seconds) before the driver applied and completely melted the brakes, blowing the tires and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface, then becoming airborne for an additional 1.4 miles and impacting the cliff face at a height of 125 feet, leaving a blackened crater 3 feet deep in the rock.
"
"> 
"
"> Most of the driver's remains were not recoverable; however, small fragments of bone, teeth and hair were extracted from the crater, and fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris believed to be a portion of the steering wheel.""

ICE manufacturers do better the more miles people drive in their ICE cars, and that's **always** going to be partly a function of how cheap gas is. When the petroleum industry is raking it in because of high oil prices, ICE car makers suffer from it. If they could make a magic fuel injection system that got 200mpg, or were able to build a magical carburetor that makes an ICE car run on tap water, any ICE manufacturer would fucking **jump** on that shit, patent it, and simultaneous flip the bird to both the petroleum industry *and* the other ICE manufacturers and light their cigars with $100 bills as the money rolls in.

BMW had to spend $100M on the I3 production line just to get the QA rejection rate down from *over 50%*, and this on a little novelty car with a production rate of like 500 a month.

"
"
"
"The main issue between being able to “see” a stop sign / red light as opposed to seeing the car in front of you, at least when it comes to Tesla, is sensor fusion. For a Tesla to see a car in front, it is using both camera and radar in parallel. They both give confidence levels many times per second and additional machine learning models are used to make sense of the combined data. For example, the ml model for finding car in front via camera may have low confidence at times depending on conditions, but radar confidence is high that car is in fact where camera thinks it is. On the flip side, radar may think there is a semi truck in front because it is amplified back by aluminum can on the road, camera  models on the other hand have high confidence that large object is not in front of car.
"

"When you remove this sensor fusion, you amplify the difficulty a lot. Tesla can only use cameras to detect red light / stop sign as of now.

Thoroughly applying both paint sealants and wax, as well as knowing where a car is likely going to start rusting and preemptively applying oil or some other hydrophobic coating in those spots will greatly reduce the chance of rust occurring. Though you need to keep applying new coatings to keep it protected. Generally applying a light layer of oil to the rolled steel edges near the wheels and bottom of the doors will prevent the visible surfaces from rusting in the usual spots, but for cars that have less undercarriage protection than the Model 3, preventing undercarriage rusting is very difficult.

Comparing 2.0 L but differing transmissions is an even bigger gain.) The 2008 burns 25% more fuel than the 2018 on the combined rating.

"A Mazda3 sees a similar difference -- about 20% greater fuel consumption in 2008. An F-150 used 38% more fuel in 2008. (That last one I'm not so sure about how fair that is. There are a ton of models and I wasn't sure what best to compare like to like; I went with the highest non-diesel MPG in each year.)
"
"
"
"Going back to the Civic, at 14,000 miles/year, a 2008 would burn about 483 gallons and a 2018 about 389. That's 1,880 lb of CO2 extra that the 2008 would burn relative to 2018. If I read [this report]( right, the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that production of an ICE car is in the ballpark of 9 tons of CO2. That means that about ten years in the break even point -- as long as that 2018 Civic is likely to last ten years, it is actually beneficial to scrap a 2008 in favor of it.

"""My work as an Automotive Durability Engineer, with a focus on the NVH aspects of durability, tells me you're quite mistaken in a few ways:
"
"
"
">We have things called motor and transmission mounts, frame bars, and other supporting structures which transfer almost the entirety of the """"explosive force"""" of an engine to the chassis.
"
"
"
"Motor and transmission mounts, etc. *react* the engine vibration and driveline torque into the body, but Newton's Third Law tells us that those *reactions* are counteracted through another path, the driveline. So for any cyclic forces occurring during combustion, there are cyclic forces through the transmission. We can smooth the forces (flywheel) or damp them (harmonic balancer), but there is a point of diminishing returns when the flywheel mass required to effectively smooth the pulses causes other drivability issues (waste of energy, slow response).
"
"
"
"Cyclic torque causes cyclic loading of the drivetrain, and cyclic loading causes fatigue. This is fairly fundamental. ICE vehicles have made efforts to reduce cyclic torque in the drivetrain, including dual-mass flywheels, but components like these increase complexity and create their own failure points, as well as their own resonances and critical speeds.
"
"
"
">Even more stupid of what you said, is when an engine fires, it is balanced. There's no sputtering """"explosion"""" rocking the engine and transmission back and forth like a seesaw. When one cylinder fires, the opposite cylinder fires almost instantly after it, ensuring a rough balance of forces.
"
"
"
"There absolutely is rocking. There are forces and moments on multiple axes due to combustion forces, inertial forces, etc. A 4-cylinder engine has one combustion every 180 degrees of crank rotation. A V6, 60 degrees, and so forth. There is no """"opposing"""" cylinder that fires off immediately after another unless you definition of """"immediately"""" is at least 90 degrees of cank rotation in most cases. In the four-cylinder example, after cylinder 1 fires, cylinder 3 fires next. However, not only is there 180 degrees of crank rotation in between, but we also need to account for the fact that cylinder 3 has a shorter moment arm than cylinder 1. This causes a rigid-body pitching reaction of the engine/transmission assembly, which causes vibration that can be felt in the cabin, as well as wear and tear on the engine mounts, body hard points, etc. Beyond that, we still need to account for inertial forces of the crank, connecting rods and pistons, inertial forces of the valvetrain, torque pulses caused by the alternator, oil pump, water pump, and so on.
"
"
"
"Now, EV drivetrains come with their own set of durability challenges, including their higher torque production as well at the fact that their torque is also not exactly smooth with respect to rotor angle (due to cogging torque, etc.), but that's not really my area. What I can tell you is that the cyclic torque pulses of ICE engines create a significant challenge that manufactures are still spending tens of millions, if not more, to attempt to mitigate.""

If you have this much degradation, internal resistances formed by decomposition products of lithium and the electrolyte produce a high overpotential an therefore degradation accelerates.

What's considered the final failure is is up to the owner of the vehicle really. Short of the frame itself being significantly damaged, pretty much everything else is a component that can be replaced.

Exhaust-air heat exchanger failure had exhaust coming into the vehicle and me pulling the tubing out by the side of the road. Ignition switch failure meant I was using a push-button, installed in parallel to the key switch, for years.
"

"
"What bothers me about modern cars is that there are so many more of these non-engine systems. E.g. even the Model 3's frunk release is an electronic relay thing - and there are already reports of it failing on the 'net. My push-button on the back hatch is now 50 years old and still works perfectly! I really don't have much faith that a modern car will be able to last as long. Hopefully I'm wrong ey?""
"
"""I think that’s extremely rare. My first and last ICE car was well maintained and engine would knock when cold at 136k and transmission was starting to go out. It would probably last till 200k, but no way with out a rebuild to 300+. ""

"3800?
"
"""So, the more likely fact is that Tesla engineers are dumb and it never crossed their mind to test the motors in real world conditions. It's not like they guaranteed 1 million miles for the semi. But probably they will sell the semi to be used only in the lab.""
"
"""I'm not sure who you are quoting... So at any rate your back tracking, now your only talking about """"modern"""" cars, not all the cars above are from 1990s some are early 2000s. But here is the thing with 1st or 6th impressions (lol), Ford and Chrysler lost my patronage to a point where any cars by them don't even enter my mind as valid car options at this point if I ever buy a 7th car from them, and something goes wrong, I have only my self to blame for being dumb enough to buy one.

"
"
"
"But I think your again mission the point of my original comment, what I mean is it looks like Tesla is actually trying to make cars that will last and they are not trying to make money of maintenance, etc... Where others, most if not all, the whole thing is build for manufactures/dealers to make money one the cars not working.""
"
"so you downvote? lol
"
"""Yeah, I knew the torque converter buffers the torque (but forgot about it in this discussion) and that's mainly why automatic transmissions are less efficient compared to manual transmissions. Did not know they could lock up, that's interesting, but makes sense.""
"
"I might have to finally change my brake pads after 15 years too. Damn maintenance costs
"
"""Yes, I meant in a refresh cycle.  Updating the interior at the same time would be reasonable too, no?""
"
"For a million miles?
"
"""There's also a feature perspective. Even at twice the annual mileage, a million mile car will be 33 years old.

"I have teetered on the edge of buying a new car several times over the last four years to replace my *'02*, and it's really only the fact that I only drive about 6K mi/year that has held me back, and half of that is done in a rental nowadays. But even with *that* car, *half* that age:
"
"
"
"* I have no side or curtain airbags. (If I drove more than I do, this *alone* would have been enough to get me to buy a replacement years ago.) I'm pretty sure most 30-year-old cars would lack *any* airbags.
"
"* I have no traction control or ESC
"
"* It lacks collision avoidance/mitigation features (though *warnings* could be easily retrofitted)
"
"* I'm not sure if it has LATCH child seat restraints; it's right on the borderline of where that'd be required.
"
"* It lacks a backup camera, though that could be pretty easily retrofitted I think
"
"* It lacks adaptive cruise control
"
"* It lacks navigation, android auto, or a screen
"
"* I've *already* replaced the stereo system once, and *that* is now outdated because it lacks bluetooth
"
"* The paint has clearcoat damage
"
"* It's got some rust
"
"* 30-year old cars wouldn't have an OBD-II port

"
"Yessir
"
"""I am quoting myself, literally above your last message... Think what ever you want, but cars getting more reliable was a product of this type of testing. All manufacturers do it, I am glad they do, and they should. A vehicle should be designed to last around 10 years of average driving without any serious issues with only normal service, and thankfully we are really close or maybe even at  that number now.""

"My wife was driving our '00 Insight about 4 years ago.  One of my friends asked why I would let her drive such a small car that would be absolutely obliterated in a bad accident.  For it's time it was ok.  But in this decade?  He was right, I didn't want her to drive that thing.  It's one thing to put me in it.  So I sold it.

"""Sounds like you've had some impressively rotten luck.  That's rough.  But like I said:

"
"Time and weather.  An alternator or starter failure on a four-year-old car that has 80,000 miles on it would be surprising.  The same failure at the same mileage but on a twelve-year-old car isn't really surprising.  Age is the worst thing for a car, far worse than any amount of mileage you could reasonably put on it.
"
"
"
"So just to put it in perspective here, the oldest Model S that could still be on the road today is 6 years old.  Half the cars you're talking about are twice as old.  That makes a huge difference.""
"
"""I doubt they would couple an interior and drive train update - that causes increased supply chain change dependencies - especially considering he just said that tesla doesn't do """"model years""""""
"
"""What are you talking about, this is from when cars were cars and didn't just fall apart when they got hit.  Clearly the driver in the Malibu would have been extremely satisfied that his hardy, heavy car would have held up so well and obliterated his soft body.""

"
"""The new drivetrain is ready, and the current interior is expensive to make.  They will take ideas from the Model 3 interior to lower costs of both.""
"
"You're saying they have a warehouse full of new model-S drive trains just sitting around that they aren't using because they want to wait for the interior?
"
"""No, I’m saying timing makes sense for both.  Pictures of the interior refresh have been out for a while.""
