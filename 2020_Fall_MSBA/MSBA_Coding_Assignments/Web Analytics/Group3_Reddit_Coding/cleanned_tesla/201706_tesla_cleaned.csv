The Boxster/Cayman tends to be the more capable platform by virtue of being mid-engined, but Porsche doesn't want it stepping on the 911's toes, so they tend to gimp it.

"Just to give you an idea of how absurd it gets, the 996 (generation) 911 introduced water cooling in 1998.  It's a fairly good looking car that won design awards for six years, is faster than the previous 993 in any measurable aspect, considerably more reliable, with a better interior, and introduced huge features like active aerodynamics, an integrated dry sump system, and variable valve timing.  The convertible version even introduced a drastically improved roof system that could raise or lower it in under 20 seconds.  But to this day, it is ridiculed by some as the worst 911 and is one of the cheapest 911s you can get, relatively speaking.

"Regardless, you're correct about service centers being moneymakers. EVs have far fewer mechanical parts that can be repaired at the service center. Reduced brake wear (due to regen), simple single-speed gearbox (infrequent transmission fluid changes) and zero oil/filter changes mean that EV service plans do far less than an ICE and should be priced accordingly. It's also the reason why Tesla can offer an unlimited mile powertrain warranty without much worry. The greatest price/mile wearable on a typical EV, by far, are the tires- which can be changed by any mechanic, not just the dealer.

"
"""Well statistically speaking, more costs come from fixing cars after accidents than fixing people after accidents.  So while you're right in the sense that it's better to have $100k in car damage than $50k in car damage and $250k in person damage, statistically you'd have like six of those crashes with $100k in car damage for each of those crashes with $50k in car damage and $250k in person damage (obviously that's not exactly how it goes, but it's in the range of $2 spent on auto damage for each $1 spent on person damage).

"
"The other part of it might be Tesla did a bunch of grandstanding when the Model S NHTSA results came out, but once other testing agencies tested the Model S, they found it didn't perform nearly as well in their tests.

"
"""Not all insurance plans cover medical bills actually (it varies by state whether it is required). And the *amount* that the insurance company will cover up for medical bills also varies (and the amount required varies). The cost of vehicle insurance, however, is going to be based on the car/driver/cost of repairs/etc.
"
"
"
"Chances are the medical portion is calculated separately by insurance companies. Ideally you would be able to get medical benefits cheaper if you had a safer car (but I don't know how much this works in practice because I don't know enough about insurance). But """"medical coverage"""" might cover just you, it might cover anyone else injured, it might only covered only people injured if *you* are found to be at fault. There are a lot of variables here and the answer to your question will partially rely on those I suspect.

"""That's correct. Most accidents results in auto damage, not personal injury. The safer cars get, the less person injury occurs. However, what makes that happen - all the safety measures, etc. - is what costs more to repair. Average repair costs of new vehicles is rising dramatically. Now add to that all the external sensors for autopilot, lane-drift alerts, etc. and you can see where the added repair costs come from. That's what's driving up insurance costs. *Eventually* they will come down due to accident avoidance, but not until a preponderance of cars on the road have all those features to reduce occurrence of accidents. Source - I work in insurance, though personal lines are not my specialty, I listen to our quarterly and annual reports.""
"
"There's $2 in property damage costs for every $1 in medical costs paid out by car insurers. The repair costs are a bigger part of the premium calculation as a result.

"""Keep in mind insurance rates are going to go up on almost all vehicles soon if not quite yet.

"The Forbes article is in error.  It's 315% of industry avg. rate or 215% *more* losses; The baseline is average of entire passenger fleet (including econoboxes.)  Same error made elsewhere:
"
"
"
"> Combine both frequency and severity, and overall losses on the Model S equate to “more than 3 times ~~higher than~~[1] average, *in line with other high performance luxury cars from Audi, BMW and Maserati, which also get into a lot of crashes and are costly to repair*,” an IIHS spokesman explaining the methodology pointed out. ( [emph. mine]
"
"
"
"Incidentally, premature/preliminary data suggests Model-X *might* be high (vs all passenger cars) as well, but it only has 1 year data.  IIHS has noted in the past that it omits vehicles with less than 3 years data (to minimize impact of outlier data is my guess.)  Maybe we'll see something in '19 (when '16-18' #s are collected.)[ibid]
"
"
"
"> So does that mean that in an accident they are safer for occupants and perhaps pedestrians?
"
"
"
"> """"For pedestrians, we don’t know the answer to that,"""" says Russ Rader, spokesperson for the IIHS, """"For occupants of other vehicles the losses are about average, **but for sure the Tesla Model S has much lower than average injury claims for its own occupants.**""""
"
"
"
"> **The data shows that the Model S has the lowest relative medical payment claim frequency of luxury brands.** And that makes sense, explains Radar. """"The Tesla is a large, heavy vehicle, and heavy vehicles are more protective of their own occupants in crashes than small, lightweight vehicles.""""

Since g-force accelerations indirectly produce weight, any g-force can be described as a """"weight per unit mass"""" (see the synonym specific weight). When the g-force acceleration is produced by the surface of one object being pushed by the surface of another object, the reaction-force to this push produces an equal and opposite weight for every unit of an object's mass.

The best chance to get a favorable response is to document all relevant details factually and stay away from making immature or derogatory comments. You've done well for yourself here.""

Got annoying very quickly.  Lasted for weeks and really set the tone for the next 9-10 months of ownership, haha.  We can laugh about it now, it was an experience.

"Thankfully we were in a part of the US where a number of friends and co-workers hopped on the early adopter band wagon with us and received Model Xs at various times throughout 2016.  It was very evident that the issues we experienced (and got corrected), didn't even occur once on deliveries around that time going forward.  The Model X should not have shipped when it did, quality suffered, but the entire company rose to the occasion and corrected course.  I think Elon stated he was sleeping at the factory at one point until they could manufacture a Model X without any rework.  It paid off!

The family loves it, it's exactly what Tesla originally intended to deliver.  I hope you will give them a second chance and get a replacement Model X – especially if you travel a lot for road trips with the family.

"I would certainly not remove a door from a Tesla, but no state would care if I did so long as the car was equipped with proper seat belts. From the point of view of laws that are as old as 70 years old in some cases, doors are seen as a comfort device and not for safety. IE: In Virginia you could chop down a car to only the windscreen and it would be legal...so long as it still possessed the required lighting, seat belts, and other safety components. This is a state with annual safety inspections at that. If this Tesla's door problem happened almost from the date of delivery or across thousands of cars I could see the state taking issue with that. I really just don't see the state triggering lemon laws over a single car having door issues several years down the road.

"""All li-ion batteries have to do it.  It's somewhat like breaking in a car or clothing (like boots).  The battery works best if it's worn in a certain way.  The technical explanation is a little complicated: The first ~40 cycles are used to build up the Solid Electrolyte Layer (SEI), which is a really complex chemical aggregate that grows on the graphite side of the battery.  Its both good and bad for the battery- in the end growth of the SEI is what makes it stop working, as lithium starts getting trapped in the SEI and can't be recharged, so capacity shrinks.  However the SEI also acts like a sort of chemical insulation for the graphite/electrolyte: ionic lithium is *extremely* reactive and would destroy the battery quickly otherwise.  If you grow the SEI properly it extends the lifetime of the battery by 20-50 times.  That process is very proprietary but usually involves slow, deep charge/discharge cycles, just like my girlfriend.

"1) You are claiming to be able to recognize a change in efficiency of less than 4% in uncontrolled environments.  Lets extrapolate that to a real world situation...  Lets arbitrarily pretend adding 200 pounds decreases efficiency by 2%.  That means the 300 Wh/mi you """"know"""" you get on a certain stretch of road is now 294 Wh/mi.  Compare that with the impact of a 5mph speed increase which is a decrease of 25 Wh/mi, so that 300 just became 275 because of a miniscule 5mph speed change. A 2mph change?  That's a 12 Wh/mi change.  A 1mph change? 6 Wh/mi impact.  [Source.](  This is the same as having a 1mph head or tail wind, or having a vehicle driving in front of you breaking up the air a little bit.  See why I keep bringing up uncontrolled environments?
"
"
"
"2) You are claiming to see a larger than 4% change in efficiency (all you said is 4% weight != 4% decrease in efficiency), which could potentially be noticeable.  It's not supported by any available research on weight and vehicle efficiency, however.
"
"
"
"3) Research bias - this is most likely what's occurring.  When you consider the placebo effect alone has a 30% success rate (sugar pills treating medical conditions!), it's not hard to imagine you are potentially wanting to see something that isn't as obvious as you think it is.
"
"
"
"Research has been done on weight and impact on vehicle efficiency.  The EPA says between 1 and 2% improvement in fuel economy (efficiency) for each 100 pounds removed from a vehicle, with larger gains on lighter vehicles and smaller gains on heavier vehicles.  [Here's research showing weight decreases on efficiency gains]( - see slides 29 & 31, as the Model S weighs between the two weights of those vehicles, which averages to a 1.5% increase in efficiency for a 5% weight reduction.
