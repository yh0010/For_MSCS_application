I think that's probably actually true -- they're leveraging more-expensive LiDAR tech while Tesla is trying to avoid it.. so Tesla is playing catchup with just its cameras+radar. All the major manufacturers are working on it. MobilEye is huge and Intel has bought them. Uber knows they're going to need it - since there won't be drivers anymore, the cars are going to be doing the driving.. so they'd better have the cars or they're done. If the US stops its development of AI, China and Russia will be happy to beat everyone to the punch (leaders of both China and Russia have stated that AI is a gigantic strategic priority and they are investing in it heavily). Self-driving is coming - It's a race. No one (e.g. Elon Musk) is going to be able to prevent it simply by avoiding the field. It's a prize worth heaps of money and strategic/military power and it's up for grabs.

Whoever's got the best has the best brain, and it will be better than yours. I don't expect my phone to beat Google and China (and what the heck - Bloomberg.. they do finance I suppose).

However, as I said, the rest of the world is going to do it anyway -- so perhaps it wouldn't be wise to stall AI efforts in the US (i.e. cede superiority to China+Russia+Europe, etc. and potentially have even less money+power to work with). I agree that it's all screwed up and a lot of people are in for a world of hurt. Truck drivers will be some of the first to get hit badly. If it's any consolation, I expect a lot of financial analyst types to also get rocked by the new AI tech, and then a lot more people.. so there will soon be a lot of powerful allies to try and work something out. There are going to have to be political/market changes -- they can't just decide not to develop the tech and to hope for the best.

Looking across Musk's companies.. Oil interests (comparing to Tesla) and other defense contractors (comparing to SpaceX) have received, and continue to receive, far more investment from the government than any of Musk's stuff. In the case of oil, there's great strategic interest in that just as there also is with modern electric grid+battery+car tech.. and for space, there's of course great strategic interest in rocketry and the ability to get things into space. To a certain extent, investment in these things is a relatively cheap way to do its job -- while a lot of the money is of course pork. In terms of cost, everything Elon Musk has done thusfar is small potatoes in comparison to oil companies + ULA. If you want to know what's really going on, you've got to consider that a lot of Elon Musk's projects are a thorn in the side to a lot of powerful entrenched interests -- so why would the government choose to upset those interests, and instead give everything to him?

"Of the [five levels of autonomy]( """"Full autonomy"""", level 5, is defined as ...
"
"> the full-time performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver.
"
"
"
"In aviation human pilots monitoring a flight management system, autopilot, and automated landing system would be doing so at level 2, 3 or 4 (depending on the tech).
"

"Tesla is aiming at level 5: """"Full autonomy"""". That includes off-highway driving.
"
"
"
"Tesla """"Autopilot"""" is currently at level 2.
"
"
"
"However, you do mention  some tasks that aren't necessarily handled even with level 5 full autonomy (and that was some of the detail I was hoping to learn): ...
"
"
"
"*  load/unload the truck. 
"
"* Monitor that the load is secure. 
"
"* Chain it up in mud/snow.
"
"* Deal with repair issues on the road. 
"
"* Pre-trip and inspect the truck before it goes out.
"
"
"
"... but there seems plenty of scope for the industry to reorganise itself, and so help you reorganise your business, to take car of those tasks.
"
"
"
"For example, in a world of fully autonomous trucks it seems there could emerge a """"truckers assistance"""" service (and presumably this already exists in some form). 
"
"
"
"So your folk, in your company, could load the truck and pre-trip and inspect the truck before it goes out: as normal. At the other end you've outsourced unloading to another company (who have folk at or near your destination).
"
"
"
"En route you have cameras pointing at the load. Someone sitting in your office could be reviewing multiple trucks simultaneously through those cameras. Potentially this could be complemented with automated systems that warn of a bad load, in the same way there exists systems that monitor pool drownings: 8
"
"
"
"Chain it up in mud/snow. This seems like an obvious (albeit quite challenging) automation problem for Tesla to solve. Moveable spikes? Complementing wheels with lowerable tank tracks? In the interim I see no great impediment to outsourcing this too.

"E.g. a contracted supervisor gets on well before the expectation of snow and well after and chains in up/off as required ... I don't live in the snow so you might be able say why this is unworkable. Such supervisors could serve particular regions.

"Edit: Since people are moaning below about me being misleading about the reason the battery manager throttles range, let me be more clear.  There are three reasons Musk artificially throttles the range of the cheaper 60D battery.  First is because he wants to collect real world battery degradation data, teasing out the independent variable of frequent 100% charging.  After all the 60D's complete their lifecycle, he has valuable data of whether the battery manager preventing full charges extends battery life by stopping lithium dendrite formation, and by how much.  The second reason is financial, because standard market pricing strategies give consumers choice, customers love choices, the cheaper limited model collects information about what Tesla buyers care about most that can be used to perfect the product.  The third reason is because Tesla is a definitely-for-profit company, he's not running a charity or philanthropic foundation.  You want to tap as much of the market as possible, while not giving away the cars at a loss, and keeping things fair.  We'll give away the car at the cost of materials and labor if you let us throttle the battery for purpose of R&D on battery technology.  Musk is playing 4D chess here, you always got to be thinking 10 or 12 steps ahead.

"Everybody wins, people who can't afford a Tesla can afford a cheaper model.   Tesla stands a chance to break even or possibly even turn a profit on the Model-S by continuing to sell the 75 at the necessary profit margin to recoup development costs. 
"
"
"
"Small profits are better than no profits, but if Tesla sold all the 75s at the cost of 60s they would definitely lose money.   They already are having an incredibly difficult time turning a profit at the 75 price. If they dropped the price 10% their 0.1% profit would turn into a 10% loss across the board.   The 60 increases their bottom line slight, helps them spread the dev expenses to more units sold while not cannibalizing the sales they need to turn a profit. Which in turn drops the price of the 75 by reducing the profit they need to make on every 75.   
"

"So 75 customers get a lower price thanks to 60 customers spreading out dev expenses.  60 customers get a heavily discounted vehicle and the option to later upgrade without having to sell their vehicle and pay taxes on a new one.   Tesla is more likely to turn a profit.   Win-Win-Win.

But they also need to sell at a higher volume to pay for the fab equipment. It is also the reason why it took to long for AMD to come up with a competitive product. Without the higher margin of the high end they have to sacrifice a lot just to have enough money to develop the ryzen processor.

"
"
"
"So, in the hours I spent creeping along I had several ICE vehicles in front or around me die and block the road even more. Why? Out of gas from all of the idling and creeping with no where to go. Me? I used some power while creeping along running the A/C.......... a whopping 2%/5 miles more than I would have had there been no 3+ hour traffic jam. Even with the A/C running I made no appreciable dent in range, yet over a dozen ICE vehicles had run out of gas. At first I thought people were just stopping to rest, until people were getting out to push their cars out of the way after they had died, plus as I pass I usually asked if they were OK and usually got a brief explanation. Several others had overheated from the hours of idling in the car-packed area, presumably with inadequate cooling as evident by plumes of steam from the front of the cars.
"
"
"
"Then, when I finally got off of the exit there was a relatively large gas station (30+ pumps) just at the end of the ramp on the right. Turns out a big holdup to getting going off this ramp was a blockage from a line of dozens of ICE vehicles trying to get into this gas station for a fill. Every pump stall was in use, with a line of cars waiting all the way back to the highway off-ramp! ICE folks frantically trying to recover the gobs of fuel wasted over the past few hours. Still no where to go really, so, had to wait a bit to get past that, then as soon as possible I turned off in the direction opposite to where everyone else was going (didn't care where it went) and got moving again.

Customers and Tesla were afraid that this would remove the cheapest option, the 60kWh battery, but maintaining production lines for three battery variations, plus the hardware for each of them would cost Tesla more then selling the 75 as an artificially limited 60. They can’t sell all of the 75s at the 60 price, but some. The idea was to have a cheap base model, and customers could upgrade later if necessary / wanted. It turned out that the 60 wasn’t all that popular and Tesla decided to discontinue it, and if I recall correctly the 75 base model reduced in price as well.

"Ty for informing me
"
"Not according to the supercharger status.
"
""">So, yesterday I was making my journey back to my home in NC from NJ. All was well, ended up arriving at the Burlington, NC supercharger around 9:30PM. Charged there for about 30 minutes to get enough to get home plus a pretty decent buffer (~50 miles since there was a storm in between), like normal, for the last leg of the trip.
"
"
"
">I set the GPS even though I know where I'm going (~125 miles) and the GPS was giving me some ridiculous route using all crazy back roads and adding 45 minutes to the route. I just assumed it was crazy and turned it off. Not the first time it would have given me some off-the-wall directions. I usually just use it as a progress meter anyway.
"
"
"
">Well... I should have listened to it. 5 miles down the interstate, dead stop. Check the map (had traffic overlay off for some reason)... red for miles, then nothing/no data for miles meaning the highway was closed ahead. Checked Waze, confirmed there was a major accident ~6 miles ahead. Entire westbound side of the highway shutdown. Nearest exit? About 4 miles west. Checked satellite view for any turnarounds or other escapes. Nope. Concrete barrier all the way to the next exit. """"F***."""" Looks like I should have listened to the GPS and saved several hours. Next time I'll take the nav more seriously...
"
"
"
">Creeping along for hours. Was 85F outside (hot night for this time of year IMO), so I was running the A/C the whole time at about 70F. The exit was no saving grace either, since the 1-lane road detour was also backed up for miles as the 4-lanes of interstate tried to funnel into it.
"
"
"
">So, in the hours I spent creeping along I had several ICE vehicles in front or around me die and block the road even more. Why? Out of gas from all of the idling and creeping with no where to go. Me? I used some power while creeping along running the A/C.......... a whopping 2%/5 miles more than I would have had there been no 3+ hour traffic jam. Even with the A/C running I made no appreciable dent in range, yet over a dozen ICE vehicles had run out of gas. At first I thought people were just stopping to rest, until people were getting out to push their cars out of the way after they had died, plus as I pass I usually asked if they were OK and usually got a brief explanation. Several others had overheated from the hours of idling in the car-packed area, presumably with inadequate cooling as evident by plumes of steam from the front of the cars.
"
"
"
">Then, when I finally got off of the exit there was a relatively large gas station (30+ pumps) just at the end of the ramp on the right. Turns out a big holdup to getting going off this ramp was a blockage from a line of dozens of ICE vehicles trying to get into this gas station for a fill. Every pump stall was in use, with a line of cars waiting all the way back to the highway off-ramp! ICE folks frantically trying to recover the gobs of fuel wasted over the past few hours. Still no where to go really, so, had to wait a bit to get past that, then as soon as possible I turned off in the direction opposite to where everyone else was going (didn't care where it went) and got moving again.
"
"
"
">Used my 17"""" map to come up with my own traffic-free detour (the one everyone was taking was backed up for at least another 90 minutes and included several additional accidents according to Waze). Found a decent route that added about 15 miles to my original route. No biggie. Got back on track within ~20 minutes and drove the remaining 2 hours home.
"
"
"
">So, long story short... I'm glad I drive a Model S. I was chuckling a little at the unfortunate ICE vehicles that ran out of fuel with no where to go or do except be stuck while I had used virtually no fuel for the entire jam up.

"""Well, the 60 has been phased out (you cannot buy it anymore), but the current price to software update the battery is about $2000. When they were for sale, the price difference between the 60 and the 75 was about $9000.
"
"
"
"rade-2000/""
"
"""Not necessarily.  Let's say the 75 was being sold at a profit of $7,500.  Tesla hears the demand for a cheaper vehicle with less range and looks at the logistics of offering a 60 variant with a smaller battery.  However, since a separate line is needed to build this variant the final cost to make the 60 ends up being very close to the price of of the 75. 
"
"
"
"So now Tesla is stuck. They have potential customers looking for a cheaper shorter range vehicle, but can't make one at a profit.  So they come up with an alternative of software limiting the 75 to the range a 60 would have and price it $5,000 less. 
"
"
"
"While they could just lower the 75 by $5,000 since that would still allow them to make a profit, you have to keep in mind the cost of producing the vehicle is more than just the cost of the materials and manufacturing it.  There is also all the R&D that was put into designing the vehicle and to design future vehicles.  If Tesla's margins are too low the company will not be able to sustain future development.
"
"
"
"So by making a 60 version that is a software limited 75 this allows them to continue selling the 75 at a price needed to sustain future development of the company while also being able to offer a lower priced vehicle to bring in more potential customers who were unable to afford the higher priced 75.   While they are not making much profit on the 60 version, its better than losing a sale and making no profit because their entry level price for the vehicle was too high. 
"
"
"
"Also, since the 60 does have a 75 battery in it, you throw in the option that if the customer wants they can always pay to upgrade to the larger battery any time in the future.  Many customers may actually like having this option since this allows them to go to the 75 range version if they realize the range of the 60 is not enough for them after purchasing the vehicle. 
"
"
"
"I understand how it can be annoying owning something and not being able to use it because of software restrictions, but this was the only economical way for Tesla to offer this cheaper version. Honestly, I am not even sure Tesla was making a profit on the 60 version since they only offered it for a few months before getting rid of it. ""
"
"""> But I can't shake the feeling of comparing this to on disc DLC for video games.
"
"
"
"If it helps the 75kwh model came first, and they later offered the 60kwh version to reach a part of the market they were missing out on. 
"
"
"
"So it's more like how Rainbow 6: Siege came out as a $60 complete game, and then later offered a $20 version that took more in game currency to unlock new characters so they could get more players without dropping the cost of the full game.
"
"
"
"The part about it that makes it unlike video game DLC is that video games are a subjective experience you have to play to evaluate. You can't know understand what experiences the DLC has omitted until you've played the game.
"
"
"
"Cars are much more objective, you can define them via somewhat simple specs. Moreover, the 60 and 75kwh models have identical performance, trim, literally everything except battery life. So a buyer can be educated on the difference rather quickly, and make an informed decision. """"This car goes 180 miles on a charge, this other one costs $5k more and goes 210"""", simple numerical comparison.
"
"
"
"You can't make a comparison like that on a video game, they're complex and each player has a unique experience with them based on innumerable factors. """"50 hour campaign, 70 hours with DLC"""" means nothing without understanding what those 50/70 hours will entail. ""

"
"I'm sorry, I was unclear here. The true 60kwh is the inferior product. The false 60kwh, truly a limited 75kwh battery, performs better than a 60kwh does. It has a longer lifespan as it never fully recharges.
