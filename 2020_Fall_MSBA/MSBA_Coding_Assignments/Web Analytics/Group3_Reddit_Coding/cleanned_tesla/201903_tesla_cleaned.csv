"1) When taking freeway interchanges or off ramps using Navigate on Autopilot (NoA), it will often have some kind of issue initiating it. Literally on my way to work this morning, it just didn't engage to take the exit like it usually does. I think this was because it always detects construction on that exit (rightly so), and because I relied on Autopilot's (AP's) slow lane changing, it just didn't have enough time to put everything together.

"3) Once, I was on a hill pointed upwards (I was ascending), and it came to a stoplight that I was going to turn right through on a red. There was a car in front of me. The turn, once made, basically becomes a blind corner. While sitting at the light I'd engaged autopilot just to move the car a bit once the guy in front of me moved so I don't fail to pay attention and miss it. I do this all the time. It has always worked perfectly before and since. But, this one time, once the car in front of me made the turn just a bit, the car slammed on the accelerator and I almost hit the guy in front of me. So... would I have hit that car if I hadn't slammed on the brake? Maybe not. AP """"probably"""" would have caught that. But it still scared the shit out of me.

">Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an email to employees on Thursday night explaining the company's decision to reduce headcount in its sales and marketing divisions.
"
"
"
" 
"
"
"
">Last month, I noted in my email that the fundamental issue Tesla must overcome is that our products remain too expensive for most people. We know there are many people who want to buy Model 3, but simply can't afford to do so.  
"
">  
"
">That is why we're excited to announce today that we are now offering the standard Model 3 at $35,000. This is a significant milestone for Tesla, the culmination of years of hard work by employees across the company, and something of which you should all be very proud. You can read the details of the announcement on our blog: LINK HERE  
"
">  
"
">In addition, we are also making the decision to shift all sales worldwide to online only.  
"
">  
"
">Last year, 78% of all Model 3 orders were placed online, rather than in a store, and 82% of customers bought their Model 3 without ever having taken a test drive. Customers can now buy a Tesla in North America via their phone in about 1 minute, and that capability will soon be extended worldwide. We are also making it much easier to try out and return a Tesla without a test drive. You can now return a car within 7 days or 1,000 miles for a full refund. Customers are becoming increasingly comfortable making purchases online, and that is especially true for Tesla — which is a testament to the products we make.  
"
">  
"
">As a result, over the next few months, we will be winding down many of our stores and significantly reducing our spend on sales and marketing, which will help make the price changes we've announced today possible. Shifting all sales online combined with other ongoing cost efficiency will enable us to lower all vehicle prices by about 6% on average, allowing us to achieve the $35,000 Model 3 price point.  
"
">  
"
">A small number of stores in high-traffic locations will remain as galleries, showcases and Tesla information centers. At the same time, we will be increasing our investment in the Tesla service system and manufacturing, and I expect that headcount to grow next year.  
"
">  
"
">Unfortunately, this means that some jobs will be impacted or transitioned to other areas of the business. This is a hard decision, but it necessary to make our cars more affordable. Our sales team has fought on the front lines of advancing our mission and has been our connection to hundreds of thousands of customers along the way. I want to express my sincere gratitude for all that you've done.  
"
">  
"
">Kn the coming weeks, we will be evaluating all of our sales and marketing organization to understand where there are operation efficiencies, and how best to support the transition to online sales while also continuing to deliver a truly awesome and education Tesla buying experience.  
"
">  
"
">We'll be sharing more information on this transition soon.

"""Most of the unreliability reports are based on those things you mentioned. One thing to keep in mind is that Tesla only started producing the Model S in 2012. Since then there have been huge improvements in both production and quality. I'm not going to say something might break, but in terms of the drivetrain the cars are bulletproof. Your Quora fact about the cars is based on the fact that the motors of the cars cause quite a bit less friction and wear down more slowly, they also are less prone to failure the way an internal combustion engine does. The batteries are really the limiting factor of lifespan. The good news though is that even the early Model S cars are showing only a slow degradation of the batteries and are likely to last over 15 years before you see much of a change in your range. Some cars have already been proven in high milage use by a company called Tesloop that uses the cars as a taxi service around the southwest. While the claim that they could last 100 years is definitely speculation, it can be said that the drivetrain is much simpler and less likely to have major failures.

I looked at the link and it turned out there was an event that very same day not more than 3 miles from my house.  Jumped in my car, ran over there and drove it the same afternoon.  That was my first EV driving experience, and I fell immediately in love.  I've put over 125k miles on leased EV's since June 2013.  I've collected $10k from CVRP over the years and never had a downpayment on any of the leases, and the monthly payments were never more than $300/mo on any of them.  I've saved so much money and time going all EV on my 80 mile per day commute.

The only condition in which front fog lights are helpful are when you're going 20 mph because the fog or rain is so heavy you can't go any faster.

The article you linked is still a good one.  Notice that it focuses only on used cars.  I would go further and say that in general, any loan on a used car is a bad idea.  The rates are too high.

"Building a model of 8% taxes, $100/mo fuel, $100/mo insurance and 15% annual depreciation and assuming $0 maintenance, you have $11,500 in depreciation, $2,400 in taxes, $3,600 in fuel and $3,600 in insurance after 3 years on a $30K car.  That's a $21,100 TCO.  Adjust these variables as you want, but as long as you stay within reason, the claimed $18K TCO for a $30K car isn't crazy, it's accurate.

"When you consider that so far, EVs have depreciated less than ICE vehicles, fuel costs are lower, and substantial state and federal rebates still exist, you don't have to tweak this model much to show a $45K EV can legitimately match up favorably against the $30K ICE car in TCO after 3 years.""

It doesn't change the overall cost, which is what the actuaries are going to consider.  However, there's also nothing preventing you from taking your car to a non-certified shop for repair, either, and I know a number of people who have gotten great results from non-certified shops.  I think over time the costs will stabilize a bit, as more shops either get certified or prove themselves capable of good work with them, or Tesla builds out their own body repair to compete.""

Since then import taxes has not gone much, but after liberalization (and ironically, with the entry of foreign marques and capital), the automobile industry flourished.

We need that capacity now, and as such have to scramble to get it. 
"
"
"
"For example, a new signalling system for the 2 oldest lines was planned way back in 1998, which would allow more trains to run at faster speeds with less distance between them, allowing for an increase in capacity. That CEO, Saw Phaik Hwa, cancelled it in favour of her shop plan. After she “left” in 2012, the plan was finally put in place, but due to the increased age of the system, there were several problems with it, causing increased breakdowns and reduced speed, right at the time where more capacity was sorely needed. A lot of pain could have been avoided, had this system been installed back in the early 2000s, when demand was still marginally under capacity.""

It’s much less sensitive about vehicles in front of me (in the destination lane) than behind, so I frequently request the lane change while someone is passing me, and let Autosteer decide when it feels comfortable getting over behind them. It shows the red lane divider on the touchscreen while the other vehicle is alongside me, then switches to blue and moves me over once they’re a safe distance ahead. Never had a misstep with that, although it’s always easy to feel the steering wheel start to make any change and if Autosteer tried to move me when it shouldn’t, it would take very little force to hold the wheel straight, causing it to relinquish control instantly.

"However from a business perspective I understand the strategy.  EAP and FSD are both sunk fixed costs, in background development that will be happening regardless of public demand and in hardware that all cars get regardless of ordering options.  Each new purchase of EAP or FSD is almost pure profit to Tesla and therefore there is huge incentive to push these products to aid company financials.  They already know that the old pricing wasn’t enough to entice these buyers so they are offering a new discounted price to see how many existing customers will cross over.  Getting an existing customer on the EAP/FSD bandwagon probably makes them more net cash than a new customer buying a base model 3.

"I’m the kind of person who was going to gladly pay the original price for FSD once it was released and active, but I wasn’t going to loan Tesla my money for the development phase.

""">First off, the console gaming industry is a lot different than the car industry. The idea behind getting the systems out fast, and sometimes even at a loss, is that most of the profits are game and accessory sales. The systems also weren't supply constraint for long, and they knew that was going to happen once the launch week rush was over.
"
"
"
"There are of course differences in the strategy but the desired outcome is the same. Growth. 
"
"
"
"Consoles planned to make the money back with software sales and eventually bring the price of the console down by economies of scale. Tesla is very likely not selling the Black Model 3 at a loss but close to it. Also Tesla's payback from the price reduction is increased production capacity for future larger profits, not software sales.
"
"
"
">This argument doesn't really work for a car company. How does selling the same amount of product for less money make you grow faster?
"
"
"
"Have you seen the Bloomberg Tesla tracker? Tesla is not selling the same volume of cars for less. They will sell many more cars for less, thus growing faster.
"
"
"
"
"
">Lean growth? That's a new one. 
"
"
"
"A new one for you obviously.
"
"
"
">Fast growing companies need more employees, not less.
"
"
"
"NO. Fast growing companies need to create more value than before. Value creation is often done with more employees but it can be done with the same amount of people doing more ( or more efficient) work or more automation.
"
"
"
"You are confusing the value created by employees with value in general.
"
"
"
">You know how Tesla could have grown even faster? By reducing the costs by closing stores while not changing the prices.
"
"
"
"The only thing that will grow if they do that is the bank account. Money in the bank is money not growing.
"
"
"
">They do if they are trying to outrun the problems they are having. **The conservative approach is to close I down factories, Tesla is doubling down.** I think now the problems have caught up to them, which is why they are reducing costs to increase the lowering demand.
"
"
"
"Tesla is doubling down on growth when they should take it easy like all other companies. I agree with that. It is scary and exhausting to think about growing faster after the mad growth they had last year. 
"
"
"
"Any sane company would be taking it easy now. That's why Tesla is winning.
"
"
"
">How is selling the same amount of cars for less money make them grow faster? You claim they are supply constraint, right? If they can make 7k cars a week and sell all of them, how is selling them for less going to help at all?
"
"
"
"Again, they are selling more cars for a bit less. That's growth anyway you cut it. You insist, in fact, you put words in my mouth to imply that they are selling the same amount of cars for less. That is not what is happening. They are selling cars in record numbers (worldwide) and the records will keep increasing. The price drop will only make it increase faster.
"
"
"
">Oh, so they aren't supply constraint anymore then? They are making more cars then they can sell, so they had to reduce the prices? That's the bear's theory, not the bull's theory.
"
"
"
"Sort of true. If they didn't offer the 35k they would be demand constrained in the US. But they did offer the 35k and lowered prices increasing demand. So they are back at supply constrained.
"
"
"
"They are creating growth. 
"
"
"
">I believe Tesla said they are closing the stores to make that price possible. That to me means the margins on the base model right now are either very slight or even negative.
"
"
"
"On the Black Model 3, yes, the margins must be really thin. But as soon as they slap paint and AP on them the margins become very comfortable. 
"
"
"
">The real question is, is it still going skiing just fine after this recent announcement?
"
"
"
"Yep, we will see. Don't expect it to be easy, that's why most corps don't do stuff like this, but this is Tesla. If they want to be a trillion dollar company they must show elasticity.
"
"
"
">How do they expect to let the car sell itself when you have to buy it before your can sit in or test drive one?

"""This would work well for anyone. If you can take the software when you total the car why wouldn’t you be able to take the software when you sold it?  Does Tesla immediately start sell cars at two prices? One with software and one without?  If they did they will eventually have far more customers who owned the cars previously so that isn’t going to look good for their bottom line.  And that’s before you get in to a discussion of how do you separate the software install from the car and track it just with the individual?
"
"
"
"This is bad for new customers coming to tesla as well. Especially if someone is buying used. Surprise! You have to contact Tesla and pay $5 - $8k to unlock features. 
"
"
"
"
"
"And honestly this represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how insurance works. The payout on a totaled car is is based on market value. Creating a lower priced market just gives the insurance company a reason to give you less money. Premiums are the other hand are based on risk factors. For example my Model S is so much safer than the VW Jetta that my premiums went down. The insurance company isn’t worried about the replacement value of the car, they are worried about injuries because those bills will run far beyond whatever the value of the car is. 
"
"
"
"In other words the insurance would love to pay you less but there’s no way they are lowering premiums. 
"
"""
"
"I would much rather have free upgrades for the life of the car than have Tesla share liability for the cost of owning and operating my car. I can see no reason why they should take on a financial liability related to whether I’m a safe or unsafe driver. Now... if Tesla included insurance in the price of the car as they talked about doing for a while then this would be a different conversation. 
"
"""We will pay like 97 bucks a month in Denmark for a FSD, AWD model 3. We pay like 60% of that on a Mazda model so cheap it's not sold in NA (2008 model 2) and thats like a really great Up! older cousin so shop around is a big deal.""
"
"""The only problem is that it generally takes a _ton_ of work to port software to a new hardware platform. It's definitely not free.
"
"
"
"The impact that the software cost has on insurance, on the other hand, is really interesting... I had never thought about it that way. Why insure digital bits that can just be reflashed for free?""
"
"or they could move to a subscription.  (screw that)
"
"""FYI, this is why software as a service is a thing. 
"
"I’m sure Tesla will eventually get to a model where you pay monthly for the services.  In the beginning, however, the company has debt needs cash flow, and therefore they will sell you a larger lifetime license. 
"
"It’s basic strategy, I’ll be quite surprised if this doesn’t become a  thing.""
"
"Honestly insurance on this car is not that bad. I have another car that cost a little bit less new and it's like $100 more for six months for the Tesla for the same coverage. If people complaining about that amount of money perhaps they should look at other cars.
"
"But isn't part of the cost actually about the hardware needed to run the software? 
"
"The tweet should get as many likes & retweets as it has upvotes. Gets it more visibility.
"
"Couldn’t Tesla adopt the Apple Care approach? That would bring in additional revenue to Tesla and potentially costing owners less to replace. 
"
"How long until Tesla shifts to SaaS monthly subscription payments for autopilot? The idea of having a user base of paying subscribers would seem irresistible as Tesla eventually (next 5 years) taps out new car sales opportunities in markets like the US or Western Europe. 
"
"""Insurance for a Tesla should be the cheapest on the market since the car is hundreds of times safer than every other vehicle on the road. The autonomous driving features make it even safer. Also, sensors, cameras, and software should be an even bigger discount as the insurance company, police, and courts can easily detect the cause of any accident. There are insurance companies giving discounts for giving them access to your data on braking. When the technology upgrades to the degree it needs to be changed, the entire panel comes out and is exchanged. There are fewer parts and so fewer things that can wear out on a Tesla. I can easily see people buying one and driving it a very long time, which means less trash in landfills. Everything can be recycled. You might get a truck and a family car.

"""iMovie is essentially a stock app, even if they listed with price. You just cant use it on any other hardware platforms, and all apple platforms are able to get it for free. 
"
"
"
"Just like when u already paid for your EAP/FSD, when you get your replacement, the cost of it has already factored it in. But the only difference in iphone is, there’s no option to buy a non-imovie iphone, which technically should be cheaper. Tesla has the option is this sense.
"
"
"
"Now u’re saying that bcus of the previous phone i owned has free iMovie, my replacement phone should be cheaper because i’ve already paid for iMovie license. AFAIK, no phone or products with exclusive hardware+software operate this way. ""
"
"""“I don’t want to pay $11,000 I want to pay $200 because I don’t always use it.”  It’s like buying an AMG kit for a Mercedes and asking them to only charge you a % of the cost based on how often you actually drive the car fast. There are serious costs involved with making this software- they aren’t going to just “unsell” a chunk of it because someone wants to drive normally for a few weeks.
"
"
"
"Apart from this being borderline r/choosingbeggars territory, there are probably liability issues when it comes to providing the self-driving software as a “service”, compared to selling it as a “tool”.""
"
"""No iMovie has to be paid for. It’s not a free app, it’s costs like $5 if I remember correctly. But when you do buy, you get to use it on your next iPhone and the next iPhone...""
"
"""They could, in theory, make more than 11k off of some people with this model. I'm thinking about rental car fleets making tons this way. ""
"
"Also your beggars comparison is flat out stupid. I haven't paid for for AP and probably won't on the current pricing scheme. Not worth it to me. I'm hoping they'll give me a way to pay for something in a way I'm more comfortable with. This is me hoping to give them money they won't otherwise get. What exactly am I begging for?
"
"""Nope it’s free on my iphone and mac too.  Just google it and u’ll find out. It is a free app, period.""
"
"""Fair enough they changed it, it used to be a paid for app in earlier OS’s.
"
"
"
"Regardless of that fact, it’s not like I can buy an iPhone with less of an iOS. I do t have the option to buy an iPhone with more Apple software.
"
"
"
"So no matter what, happen is replacing phones with the exact same stock hardware and software provided the use gets the same device. Zero extra margin.
"
"
"
"Tesla is still getting to pocket extra coin for no extra materials out.

"And BTW, this particular thread started by saying Tesla would go out of business because transferring licenses would make them go bankrupt.... how many cars do you expect to get totaled?!? ""

"""I guess u still missed the point. 
"
"
"
"EAP is not the iOS, it’s imovie. It’s an optional software, but the hardware part of EAP is in-built and co-share with other functionalities of the car like its basic safety features and AP.
"
"
"
"Yes, the implementation of EAP/FSD software on another car does not add cost to them, but it needs to recoup the hardware cost too. For cars which dont purchase EAP but has still some functionality of the hardware for its basic safety features, the company is losing out on maximising the return of the hardware cost. This is also why imovie is a free app now, bcus by add the cost into the phone price, they get to recoup both the software/hardware of imovie. 
"
"
"
"Could Tesla follow apple’s software model now? Yes they could, but the price of the car could not reach 35k and be affordable for more. But by segregating EAP/FSD, more ppl can buy but Tesla loses out a lot of recouping the hardware cost of EAP/FSD. 
"
"
"
"Peeps think tt since software distribution has zero cost, why don’t they distribute it for free and benefit their customers? Because software runs on hardware, and Tesla builds both of them in this case.  For replacement cars on totalled cars with EAP/FSD, u’re paying both software AND hardware. 
"
" 
"
"Third party apps, on the other hand, bears no cost of the hardware, so they don’t care if the users installed it n times, as long as they monetize by ads/subscription from usage, which also explains why the most popular apps are free to download.

"That said, even the higher engine options aren’t really all that fast in comparison to a lot of very common cars. Camaros and Mustangs are faster and handle better. STIs too.

"He’s wrong about that too in most cases so it’s good that you edited. A lot of police vehicles sold aren’t the top engine option because many departments don’t need the extra upfront, fuel, or maintenance cost when they have radios and numbers. And even the top engine options aren’t especially fast when you’ve got things like Mustangs, Camaros, STIs, Scat Pack and up Chargers/Challengers etc all over the place. A Charger interceptor for example is equivalent to a Charger R/T with extra weight added by all the gear and partition. So, their performance is about on par with WRX, V6 Camry, 2.0t Accord Touring, or the slowest vehicle Tesla produces the Model X 75D. Oh, and now Ford Explorers are becoming a popular police vehicle and those are terrible in a pursuit.

"The reverse is actually true: an electric motor's power curve is much flatter, and the ratio of usable RPM range (top RPM at which power falls to, say, 10% below max _divided by_ bottom RPM at which power rises to within 10% of top) is much greater for an electric motor. So much so that the electric car dispenses with the gearbox.
"

A low center of gravity helps, but it's not all that you need for corning. Heavy cars have to start braking sooner, and suffer a loss of momentum through the corner. An EV will make it up in straight line acceleration, but they will still suffer through corners. This is of course seen in ICE cars as well.

"You’re right technically speaking, most cars on the road are slower than the top tier police cruisers. But most police interceptors aren’t the top engine option, and there are a suprising amount of cars on the road on par with that performance (mid tier) level these days. Having said that, there are still a significant number of vehciles that are on par or faster than the top tier engines too. As I mentioned, there are multiple trims of Chargers faster than the V8 Charger interceptor. The slowest car Tesla makes is on par with the top trim police interceptors from Dodge and Ford. A significant amount of luxury cars (BMW, Audi, Merc, some Lincolns’, and Lexus’ too) outside of the base engines are on par or faster than the top trim PIs. And as we’ve both mentioned, some top trim economy cars are there too, and that’s not to mention the performance oriented cars and modified ones.
"
"
"
"So when I said “you’d be surprised”, I was more meaning that most people don’t realize the substantial amount of vehciles that wouldn’t be out run by police cars, and that was really my point. A lot of people think that cops cars are high performing beasts (if that’s not what you were saying, fine) but in reality the true advantages the police have in chases are oftentimes not related to the cars themselves. To reiterate, you’re technically correct, most (>50%)of cars on the road aren’t as fast as police cars. But there is a very substantial amount that are. 
"
"
"
"As far as the modifications you mentioned. When you brought them up, I took it as meaning they were something special that set them apart from the civilian versions. It’s a commonly held belief that police vehciles get some “special sauce” that makes them faster, and that’s just not true. I’ve seen it too often on the SHO boards where someone comes in claiming their newly bought decommissioned PI has a special tune or bigger turbos etc that set it apart from a SHO because it’s a PI. When in reality, it’s mechanically and functionally identical. I think you pointing to “Pursuit mode” as being different than “sport mode” is really what gave me that idea, and then your “guaranty” solidified it. So I still maintain you were mistaken there.

"Both vehicles would run out of their respective fuel, you can't get more same than that...

"
"
"No ... If they ran the roadster in limp mode then that might be a fair comparison. Why is the Ford's track performance related to the roadster running out of fuel? You are comparing apples and oranges here.
"
"
"
"> if you asked people in 2009 what was the biggest reason for not wanting an electric car, they would cite rage mostly. faking an inconvenience related to range is a big deal.  
"
"
"
"Range and the time it takes to get more range. They didn't fake anything, they recreated a very easy to reproduce scenario in the interest of time and money. If that makes the car look bad, it would look just as bad as if they actually did it, the outcome is the same. Maybe range and recharge time are actually valid concerns that should be talked about.
"
"
"
"> you're trying to say that just because they COULD have run it out of fuel that it's not a lie, but that's both wrong on a technical level (which is all the original point I was trying to make), but also not the biggest problem. the problem is that they had no problem driving the car around without getting stranded, but the lied and said they did
"
"
"
"And again ask you, if they ran the car out of juice on the track would you have a problem? Maybe they wanted to drive more than 50 miles around a track, would them running out of juice and having to change it have changed anything? This is TV, they were paying a film crew and the main cast for their time, if they can get the same footage quicker and for less money, then can you really blame then for going that route? Running the car to empty would have resulted in the same footage while costing a lot more, that's just dumb.
"
"
"
"> that sort of statement of showing needing to be pushed into the garage makes the magnitude of the lie huge, as it's REALLY bad PR. like I said, that would be the equivalent of testing out some hyper-car and lying and saying it was actually slower than a bunch of other cars; they're lying about a featured that is a major make-or-break for sales. 
"
"
"
"If they pushed in a truly dead car, would that have changed your opinion of the show, even though the footage would be identical? This is nothing like running a hyper cart in limp mode, you are trying to compare two completely different things ( charge time and track performance) and saying they are there comparable. I think track performance is comparable to track performance, and refueling is comparable to recharging, since both are getting more if their respective power sources. Your comparison of recharge time and track performance makes zero sense.""

What makes most of us place thousands of dollars into a car purchase isn't the temporal intellectual aloofness of 'placing the planet above caveman emotion'... it's that very emotion, the feel of hard acceleration or throwing your car into a corner, having a car that can (almost) drive itself and one that feels so luxurious to drive you want to take it out on a spring day and experience the world. The feeling of relaxation and security that comes from reliability and safety, and the feeling of freedom that comes from being able to go anywhere, anytime. Those 'caveman' feelings are exactly what make people say """"fuck money, this is worth it"""" enough to buy a rapidly depreciating asset like a car.

"The Bolt (in contrast to Volt) is referred to an LG car by some rather than GM.""
"
"Feels like the Cold War of Reddit
"
"""> That's absolutely not true.
"
"> 
"
"> GM could have spent some money improving the (relatively new back then) lithium batteries.
"
"> 
"
"> EV1 was killed in 1999. Starting around 1995 and especially between 2000 and 2004 Lithium batteries saw huge improvements and if someone like GM had decided to invest in them like Tesla did a decade later things would have been way different today.
"
"
"
"
"
"I think this is true. There's parts of cars like the ICE, transmission, and brakes which are largely driven by car company R&D, simply because a huge share of their use is in cars. On the other hand, batteries have a huge base in everything from flashlights to laptops to aircraft, and there's lots of incentive in those industries to improve the capacity and chemistry. 
"
"
"
"Even if GM invested large resources into battery development, I think at best they'd manage to get things done a year or so earlier. This is borne out by the fact that there's been no crazy increase in the pace of battery development, even though pretty much every major car manufacturer (and Tesla) is investing billions into EVs. ""
"
"""> I don't believe for a minute that GM would have built the Volt were it not for 1.) Tesla 2.) Prius 3.) gas price increases 4.) bailout.
"
"
"
"That's sort of circular, you can also say that Tesla wouldn't have been a thing if it wasn't for the EV1. Of course companies will build something different depending on the market and actually having the resources. 
"
"
"
"> The Bolt (in contrast to Volt) is referred to an LG car by some rather than GM.
"
"
"
"I don't think that's a fair way of putting it, just because it has some LG parts. You don't call a Boeing plane a Rolls Royce just because the engines are made by them, or a Mitsubishi because they make the wings. Having outsourced parts is a part of the design process, even for Tesla. At the end of the day, GM designed and built the car. ""
