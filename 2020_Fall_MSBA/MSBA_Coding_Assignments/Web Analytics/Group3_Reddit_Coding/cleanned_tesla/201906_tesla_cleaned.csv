"""So I never saw the car until he speed past me.  He tried to use the merge lane to pass on the right.  After the accident I didn't go near his car and stayed with the guy who took the initial hit (he was shaken up).  
"
"
"
"When the cops arrived I just told the cop(s) that I had a video when he needed it and was let go (the cops didn't want us to stay for fear of another accident).  When the police called me I had this clip ready (I only noticed the White Model 3 getting hit when I pulled the video).  Cop told me the Durango driver claimed he was swerving to avoid a speeding car behind him when the accident occurred and none of the other drivers knew what happened. Luckily I was able to prove he was a liar and I am a formal witness to the accident with my footage attached to the report.  
"
"
"
"The Cop did ask how I was able to provide all the footage so I told him its standard on Teslas.
"
"
"
"Update/additional information since I am seeing the same questions. 
"
"
"
"Filming capabilities: What I showed is a standard option* on all Model 3s. You have to set up the ability to record using a formatted USB drive (FAT32) and a folder on the drive called TeslaCam. YouTube has many tutorials on setting it up. Other Tesla did not have dash cam set up. He had 7,500 miles on his car (2k more than mine) hadn’t looked into dash-cam yet. 
"
"
"
"Retrieving the film:  Once set up the car constantly saves 60 1 minutes videos of each camera (3 total) and after 60 minutes writes over the oldest. When the accident occurred and I pulled over safely I hit the save button which takes the last 10 minutes and permanently saved it in another folder on the USB Thumb drive. I got home within a hour of the accident so I had the accident any any footage leading up to it and after (no value I checked). 
"
"
"
"Location: It was on Route 50 Eastbound (Maryland) right before the Wawa (Exit 28?). 
"
"
"
"Injuries: I did not hear of serious injuries however some of the people did need to be checked out at the hospital due to airbags not deploying. 
"
"
"
"Snitching: If you feel I was in the wrong to provide evidence of a moron endangering lives on the road can you please take a moment and reflect on that. Threatening to take out the snitch too is a moronic statement and if you had been hit I know you would love a open and shut case on who was at fault. 
"
"
"
"If I see more questions that are constantly asked I will post answers here.

"Please be safe on the roads.

Yes, but maybe it was because they had their kid bleeding out in the back seat from a gun shot wound and they were rushing to the hospital in one of the worst and most emotionally clouded times of their life. I know that wasnt the case here, but if you implement a blanket policy those circumstances no longer matter. It takes the human aspect out of it.
"
"
"
"Second, to your point about the original driver defending themself. No they wouldnt ram the other car, that's nuts. Zero tolerance simply doesnt account for fault. Most car accidents are partially the fault of more than one drivers. Many times, the at fault party is not even in the accident. You could contrive so many ridiculous scenerios that would end up with people losing their license unfairly. The ability to use the roads for personal transport in the US is so important to an individual's pursuit of happiness, that I dont think we should be glib about licensing or delicensing people. 
"
"
"
"Using my original example, if you get in a fight at school, both parties are suspended or expelled. No examination of who is at fault. I'm not saying take the license away of both people, but even if one driver was neglient in their actions, most cases are not black and white and most cases dont have clear recordings of the incident. He said, she said ensues. If youre fighting for your freedom to drive for the rest of your life, that becomea a hedty fight. Zero tolerance means no tolerance under *any* circumstance. It means there is no room for further investigation. As soon as you can show negligence leading up to an incident, you're out. 
"
"
"
"The third thing is that it's permanent. There's no road to redemption. You text and drive, tap someones bumper, you're out for life. You are 16, screwing around with friends, you're out for life. You might not be mature enough at that point in your life to handle the responsibility of operating a vehicle in traffic, but in 15 or twenty years, or after additional classes, or other rehabilitative exercises, you might be. 
"
"
"
"So in conclusion, zero tolerance means no further investigation beyond proving negligence, it doesnt matter how you got there, just what happened. It means making it a blanket policy for everyone under all circumstances. And it means taking extreme, permanent, and  punitive measures without further or follow up examination. That just doesnt sound like justice to me. And that is why I dont generally agree with zero tolerance policies.""

Carbon ceramics are not good brakes, and nobody should get them unless their car is track only, and will never drive on the street, because the braking is bad if they are not at temperature, and that range is fairly narrow, and requires a professional driver on a racetrack to keep at temperatures, so steel brakes are where it is at for both street and all but the most dedicated of racecars, on BMW, Porsche, and Ferrari its a marketing gimmick.

If that instantly-vented gas has oxygen and a spark or flame present - there will be an explosion. A very, very large and powerful one. Imagine aerating an entire tank of methanol at 10k psi and sparking it. That's a fraction of the force the hydrogen burst would cause. I've been present first-hand for a small shockwave from a hydrogen ignition (they don't mention the full capacity of H2 in the tank but I'd take a wild stab at guessing 1/5000 or less for my fun amount) and it was strong enough to knock test materials off the table 15 feet away.

"But I was helping a friend car shopping a month ago, and she settled on a pretty good new Chevy - it wouldn't have been my first choice, but it fit her needs better than anything else and was half the price of the model X.

"Liquid hydrogen tanks are stored under a bit more pressure
"
"""Wait, are you seriously detouring this into gun control? Like there's plenty of arguments for it but this one is pretty contrived. 
"
"
"
"First off, a person is unlikely to be able to actually hit the pressure vessel. They'd be outside the vehicle, firing from some distance. The vessel would be buried somewhere in the car, out of sight. The car would probably be moving. I don't know if you've ever gone shooting, but hitting a small moving target from a distance is *hard*. 
"
"
"
"Second, the actual collateral damage from this is minimal. It's one explosion, but it doesn't necessarily have the shrapnel to actually be lethal to anything that's not right next to it. 
"
"
"
"Third, there are *so many better ways* someone could try to wreak havoc. Like shooting at a fuel tanker or a car with bottles of regular compressed flammable gas on it. That's just one example, and that one does not require a large and expensive rifle. You could shoot out the tires of a moving semi with much smaller armament in an attempt to cause a pileup. Like, this is probably in the bottom 10% of risk-to-reward terrorism bullshit. 
"
"
"
"Fourth, despite there being so many better ways someone could do terrorist things with a gun and explosive gas, *nobody does*. Because that entire avenue is just not worth it. 
"
"

"""Hydrogen is tiny, and leaks easily. Its also an engineering problem to design seals. The things you learn from rocket science.""

"
"""it's a separate issue, and a valid point I bring. I appreciate you wanting to dive into that, but lets get back to the topic. Collateral damage from 10,000psi of an rapidly aerated explosive agent in close proximity of its target being """"minimal"""" - I think you've already lost any chance of a valid argument. 
"
"
"
"I'd gladly argue that an equal amount of hydrogen as compared to gasoline or diesel in a tanker truck would be an unfair comparison: the hydrogen would be exponentially more force with zero warning. 
"
"
"
"You've definitely never lit gasoline or diesel on fire. It's not like the movies. Diesel burns about as slow and as hot as lantern fuel - unremarkable heat and a sooty fire. Not rapid, not explosive. Gasoline burns hot but doesn't burn as fast as you're trying to make it. Simply put it's just not like you think it is. 
"
"
"
"On your terrorism approach: You're definitely not a terrorist, because causing a 40 car pileup makes the 6 o clock news but is hardly world-news-worthy. Exploding a high-pressure tank in a crowded traffic-stuck freeway is actually terror inducing. 
"
"
"
"I can appreciate your amateur outlook on each of these issues and limited point of view, but do consider there is actual reasoning there is not hydrogen compressed tanks used en masse already, and """"shooting the tires of a movie semi"""" is not considered a worthwhile activity by shaheed. I can also appreciate your made-up statistics of risk to reward. 
"
"
"
"What I can't seem to grasp is how you're trying to say these activities are of any use from your perceived authoritative stance.""
"
"...Im out.
"
"""Yes hydrogen explosions are worse than gasoline fires from an equivalent vehicle. But how much worse are they than LPG explosions? Because we've seen plenty of LPG explosions. And those have a pretty limited range of *actual* death. The car, a few surrounding it. Maybe another car length away from that. That is not, in my opinion, a """"mass terrorism"""" level of damage. Those are explosions that look flashy. 
"
"
"
"If you want to really convince me that this idea has any merit, tell me why nobody is already doing this with LPG fueled vehicles, which are also a compressed flammable gas and which are being used on roads all the time. 
"
"
"
"Incidentally, I have lit fuels on fire, I know how they burn. Yes gasoline doesn't violently explode if they're not aerated. Yes it will violently explode if it is given time to aerate. But the reason tanker trucks are still an issue is because then the survivors are surrounded by huge walls or sections of flame. 
"
"
"
"If we're talking about laughable here, I still find your claim to be that. That someone will buy an expensive and hard to smuggle gun, take it out to a freeway area (with crowded traffic? So they'd have to find a good elevated sight line), shoot a *tiny* target from a long distance away, for LPG levels of collateral damage?
"
"
"
"Why not just get a tank of compressed flammable gas and rig it as an explosive and use it where there are actually crowds of people? Why not do literally anything else that has a higher likelihood of success or a higher body count?
"
"
"
"You're focusing on some incredibly niche hypothetical here, and you're ignoring how many dangerous and risky things we have around us all the time, and how many proven and successful ways that terrorists have operated in the past. There are poisonous things in our cupboards, chlorine gas can be made *by accident*. Explosives can be made from a hardware store. And nobody does even that. Why? Because terrorism is a hugely overblown threat *in the first place*, and when it's not, they take avenues like mass shootings and driving cars into groups of people. Not some movie bank heist level of precision plan.""

"""The S/X battery isn't changed, their improvements came from a front  motor like the Model 3's rear.  Old efficiency was 3 miles per kwh, the permanent magnet allows higher efficiency while the less efficient large rear motor can torque sleep (completely off).  This is why the dual motors got more range than rwd cars years ago too, they just improved the efficiency gains of torque sleep.   2170 cells may allow more kwh at a lighter weight for more range later.""
"
"I agree with you on lighter packs and that’s what they should be focusing on. For me I am not sure getting to 600 will help for now (atleast I don’t need that kind of range because I will never drive non stop that long) but that’s just me

"""> mirror ... I believe it’s legal in many EU countries

"In the EU even streetcars now have cameras instead of rear-view mirrors and railway safety authorities are super conservative bodies.

"Yet.

"
"Elon is talking 400 mile range Model S to come in a year or so. More details likely to come on battery investors day.""
"
"I think 600 miles is ideal because in the winter you realistically get 400 and this is perfect for road trips. People will charge less and this will effectively triple the charging network capacity. Also will a pack like this you can get 250kW sustainable charge for 3 times longer.

"
"black and aero
"
"> 2170 cells may allow more kwh at a lighter weight for more range later.

"
"""I believe given time that will fade away.

"""Do you drive non stop 500-700 miles a day? I stop after 3 hrs of driving. Even on a plane I stretch after 4 hrs. I don’t get this 700-800 mile car mentality. Sure it’s a good to have but we don’t need that right now. We need more tesla superchargers so that one can stop and in 15 mins get 200 miles added to their car which is enough to go 3 hrs non stop again.

"Tesla needs to make their cars more affordable and not build a 600 mile EV.

"( Let the downvotes begin )""
"
"I think it would be better to keep the same range and reduce the battery capacity to make the car cheaper.
"
"They \*are\* under pressure. People need to stop thinking Tesla's competition is other EVs. They are the ones trying to compete with Tesla. Tesla is competing with all vehicles ICE or EV.
"
"""But,  it's a lot more efficient resource wise to not haul a gigantic battery around all the time when normal use will only use 1/10 of its capacity.""
"
"""One time on a trip back from Cincinnati (Mason) to Minneapolis, we got in my Mazda 3 in the morning and didn't stop until we absolutely needed gas -- 8 hours, just shy of 500 miles and outside of Madison.  Stopped for 15 minutes and were back on the road.""
"
"""I like the forced rest stops just because they are supposedly healthy, and harken to the olden days when you’d stop to change horses, lol. But there are times when I want to get into the car, stop once to pee, and be somewhere in 8 hours of driving non-stop otherwise. The pee stop can have some charging as long as the restroom is within 300ft of the charger, so as not to waste time walking/running around, and I’m a sprinter kind of dude and can’t stand long-distance running :) I love long-distance, focused driving though.""
"
"You are right but still they will be different opinions=requirements and marketing is a numbers race although those may be not the important thing. Once you get to 600 miles the EV case becomes impregnable.
"
"This doesn't help us people that get extremely cold weather. We need the large batteries due to reduced efficiency in the winter.
"
"""Currently they have no need to make a pack that goes 600 miles and they should not focus on that atleast in short term. Make the vehicle lighter, and bring the cost down instead of making a 600 mile vehicle. As stated before nobody drives that far non stop even with 400 miles that close to 6 hrs non stop highway driving.""
"
"""Isn't that why they offer the model 3 standard range and long range?
"
"
"
" If I remember one of the Japanese entries has a 38 kilowatt hour battery.
"
"
"
"
"
" My understanding with current lithium technology The life of the battery is dependent upon the cycles, how many times it's been recharged.  Is it resource wise to have a car with a 150 Kwh battery last for 30 to 40 years? Vs a car  With a 38 Kwh battery lasting 9 to 14 years?
"
"

"
"
" So the reason I like cars with small batteries is that it helps get more electric cars into the market which is important at the beginning of the transition.""

"Long term say the neural network identifies bikes can be expected to go forward, the worst edge case I can imagine is the possible angles the bike *could* travel based on it's momentum vector and it's directional vector would align in such a way that the bike may be regarded as potentially about to pass the vehicle it's attached to on the left.
"
"
"
"Now, consider all of the possible cases cars could spin, flip, fly, and get towed in reverse. Why do we need to account for the phsyical direction any vehicle is moving when instead we can just model it's current momentum and the range of acceleration any typical vehicle can make from that vector. Now you have a general model that works the same for all vehicle shaped objects that doesn't care which direction they face which is why your car operated to spec around this strange sighting (for the Tesla).

Because you need to understand both in case a cyclist is on the street. This here is training the CV to say if you see a bike in this position on the back of a car don’t look at it as two object but one. This is a very simple problem to solve.

A pickup shouldn't have a sleek low profile design, it needs to be large and boxy, if there's no need for a large engine in the front, then replace all that space with storage and batteries.

You can make new lines by breeding bulldogs with terriers preventing the inbreeding issues common to pure breeds. On the specific issues of their bulldog parentage; Bostons are worth recommending over pure bulldogs for exactly the reasons you mention. Some Bostons naturally take after one side of the family more than the other ( my mom had 2 dogs from the same parents if not the same litter that had sharply different degree of appearance re: bull/terrier) however given their broader more sustainable genetics neither one had any of the familial issues common to their bull or terrier lines.

The expected price of Model 3 LR RWD in Croatia will be around 50k€ which is a lot more than $45k in the US. Combine this with a lower living standard and fewer superchargers and you’ll get why we won’t see a lot Teslas here for a while. The EU Gigafactory would change a lot of thing. Even if the price drops 10-15% that would be a huge increase in Teslas on the road.

How about the second fifty? 20 to 40 saves twenty-five. What about 20 to 100? That saves forty gallons. 20 to 200? That's forty-five. Close but not quite there. All right, fine, we install a Mr. Fusion nuclear drive and go from 20 to 1000MPG? That's forty-nine gallons saved. Close but no cigar.

"""I think this is the biggest problem for home owners going solar.  If you financed the purchase with a secured loan (like a home equity loan or home equity line of credit), you will have to pay off the remaining balance of the solar panel system before you sell the home. This is because your property is used as collateral for the loan. In most cases, secured loans don’t have prepayment penalties, so there’s no disadvantage to paying the system off early.   Now if you financed the solar panels with an unsecured loan you can sell the house and then pay the balance of the panels after you move out since the loan isn't tied to the property.  
"
"
"
"What most people do is tack on the value of the panels to the price of the home.  The downside is that you might find a buyer that loves the house but doesn't want to keep the solar panels, which can put you into a pinch because it'll require that they are removed and the seller is still liable for paying them off or moving them to their new home.""

I'm hoping to keep this house as a rental long term though, so I figure it's just another selling point for my property. We've been here for 8 years already and expect to stay another 7-8 years. The system should have paid for itself by then anyway.""

"""It’s a 1500 sqft house in central TX with no shading, so that’s not doing me any favors. And it was built in the 80s and presumably has original insulation. The only things I can think of that work in my favor:
"
"
"
"1. I like it hot. I leave the thermostat at 80-82 while home, and turn down to 78 at night. I leave it off when away. I do leave the ceiling fans on constantly when I’m home, but they use very little energy. 
"
"
"
"2. I have gas for heat, water heat, cooking, and the dryer. That bill was $27 last month, but was $60-71 in winter since I refuse to go below 71 while home. 
"
"
"
"3. My fridge is fairly new, and is a more efficient single door design. I do not use the ice maker. 
"
"
"
"4. Standard stuff like using LED bulbs, lights off when away, display on the microwave is off, no exterior lights at night, etc. 
"
"
"
"5. When I travel, I unplug everything and put the water heater on Vacation mode. I don’t travel often though, only a couple days a month on average. 
"
"
"
"6. I cover the windows when I’m gone, and only uncover the windows the sun *isn’t* directed at when I’m home. Not blackout or anything, just a nice curtain. 
"
"
"
"That’s honestly about it. I still use power tools, garage doors, the oven when it’s summer (so AC has to work harder), insist on a less-efficient projector over a TV, SMB-grade networking gear, a server, electric lawn mower, ebike, etc.. It just doesn’t add up to much.

"""net metering is not all good. most utilities power rates you are only paid for power used but not for the utilities cost to """"Deliver power"""" this cost covers their power lines and transformers and the cost of Maintain/Installing them. the utility charges you based on whats sent over these since they Own them. think of it as a use cost. depending on your Utility you dont get this rate when you send power through it.
"
"
"
"in fact you usually need to generate 1.25 to 1.5x the amount of power you use to break Even.  sending back 20-40% of power you use through the day back onto the grid.

"
"also net metering 2.0 active in most western states is no longer a 1-1 system. its time of Use.  given back at a lower rate. Covering what you use no longer gets you money saved you need to over produce during high rates and sip power the rest of the day till 10pm or you need to have a Battery

"You are describing TOU rates, which is the main way of achieving battery """"payback""""""
"
"""By the same token, just exporting to the grid instead of charging a battery allows you to power your neighbor's houses with solar energy when you have a surplus, and you get credit for that. If you're chasing """"100% renewable"""" you also need to account for the embedded energy in the battery and pay that off before the system is truly renewable. As far as I know, making batteries involves lots of strip mining in poor countries. 
"
"
"
"Most normal grid-tied PV systems without batteries pay themselves off financially *and* in terms of embedded energy within the first 10 years of their life (conservatively). A battery that doesn't add financial value is just going to increase the cash outlay and embedded energy of the system. 
"
"
"
"But of course it is hard to quantify the value of backup power, and I would probably value it at somewhere on the order of $1000/day of backup, considering we have a fridge and freezer full of food and our plumbing would freeze in the winter without electricity. But again, reliable backup can be achieved with a generator for much less money. It's not renewable, but considering you might not even EVER need to use it, it's still the most cost-effective solution for backup IMO. 
"

"Don't get me wrong, Powerwall is a cool product, but after installing and maintaining them for customers I know they aren't problem-free and a lot of customers were actually confused about why they were getting them installed in the first place.""
"
"""I'm not even talking about the tiny overproduction payment they give you. I mean the time of use arbitrage. If you have an EV, you can produce at a higher rate during the day and pay less for the electricity at night. You still have to pay non-bypassable charges, but those are small compared to the rate difference. I'm a net positive user in terms of kWh for the year, but have several hundred dollars in credit, which I won't be paid back.

"""I see your frustration with the logic but how about this:  
"
"
"
"
"
"by installing a battery I reduce the load on the grid when Peaker plants are running and reduce the CO2 Emitted from inefficient high Emission plants.  in addition to that I reduce the surplus on the grid during low use by charging my battery which means Commercial solar keeps running and that extra Green power does not have to shut down.   
"
"
"
"
"
"as solar gets more and more prolific this problem is only going to get worse. And utilities are going to insulate themselves from this cost while installing Gird Storage themselves. Passing that cost onto you, the end user ANYWAY.   
"
"Finally Grid work to be done? no worries, Grid down for 4 hours? Okay no problem, transformer blows out down the line due to high winds? (happen last year to us) sure, my house ends up the only one with uninterrupted power and internet. its not Common. but since my entire house is Electric beside my water heater (and its tank-less so it needs power)  it makes sense. and i'm not saying from a cost point that its going to work in ALL areas but even in places with low power costs and dirty power plants Like west Virginia. it makes sense from a green Stand point.""
"
"""Net metering 1.0 still has Generation charges and Distro charges that are based on usage, even with older """"spin back meter's"""" but those are on the way out if not already out. Tiered and TOU plans you still only get the KWH for generation. if you have one of those older meters? in that case of course don't get a Battery system as you only need to account for 1-1 usage.

"it looks real.     in California they'd be paying 50$ a year for this joke.
"
"This is the only vanity plate I can get behind
"
"Can someone explain this?
"
"""Funny. Since it is my own province’s license plate design, the region of the plate didn’t even register as something to make note of.
"
"
"
"I actually had a “wait a sec, what state was that in!?” moment after swiping out. Upon returning realized it was from my good ol’ home of Alberta.
"
"
"
"Also: when did they start putting that logo on the plates? Sure, that has been the government’s logo since 2009 ... but my 8 month old plate still has the ancient 1972 logo.
"
"
"
"Finally: I’ve seen a “LOL OIL” plate on one Tesla here. A co-worker told me a Tesla recently parked downtown had “COAL POWERD” (or something like that) as the car’s plate.""
"
"PAiNaLGAPe?
"
"HHAHA
"
"I love it!!!
"
"MUAHAHA now we another M3 parked next to it with the plate NPROUD
"
"Meta
"
"😂
"
"Canadians. No wonder the orange guy picks on them!
"
"This made my day LMAO
"
"Everyone I see a black and yellow license plate I'm like damn... Is that worth $50/yr
"
"Teslas are known for their misaligned gaps between the panels of their cars.
"
"I saw the LOL OIL one in south Commons a few months ago.
"
"This one looks like it is at a Costco.  Saw CoalPwrd at the Tesla store.
"
"HA HA   HA
"
"yes.
"
"I almost chose LOL OPEC for mine but chickened out.
"
"very tacky
"
"Airport Costco
"
"HAHA
"
"I agree. It looks great.
"
"Screw the car LOOK AT THAT GORGEOUS HOUSE
"
"""Looking good!  Dang, there's still snow up there right now at the end up June???  Any of the resorts still open?""
"
"I expected horns on the hood. I am disappoint.
"
"""WOW!  Great car.  Great House!
"
"
"
"You have a bed and breakfast?  I'm there!""
"
"""Hooray, welcome to the family. I imagine it’s tough to leave your beautiful Montana home, but we are happy to have you in MN!""
"
"""The house is gorgeous, as is the car.  I love Montana.""
"
"""You have a power grid there?!? 
"
"Learn something new every day!""
"
"Sorry about the whole Montana thing
"
"""Aw shucks everyone, thanks! A labor of love but I just sold the place as I’m moving to Minnesota. Not any warmer unfortunately....""
"
"this \^\^ Absolutely love that house!  Needs to be further south though with a lot less snow lol
"
"""Nah, earlier pic. I only just discovered this most awesome group so a little late to the party.""
"
"Hahah. That’s on the Model X!
"
"""Thank you! Yes. But new beginnings for our family. Plus, we look forward to better internet.""
"
"We have a great Tesla club in MN!!
"
"You built it?!
"
"Sweet! Moving to Rochester. So happy to have better access to a dealership.
"
"not a fan of the conversion myself but impressed by it nonetheless. Curious about the efficiency with the lumber rack and lights up working against the aerodynamics.
"
"""When I saw this, I thought it was the new Tesla truck and I was fucking horrified at the size of my position in the company""
"
"""I always love her work. 
"
"The behind the scenes of this work was incredible too. Kv_N0IDS2A
"
"
"
"I hope Elon responds, maybe even give her one of the first pickups off the production line, or a prototype.""
"
"is she the goofy inventor girl that had that ted talk?   like the alarm clock that slaps her in the face
"
"Simone is great.
"
"""What a fun project! Not my cup of tea, but she's clearly thrilled with the results and I guess that's all that matters.  
"
"
"
"
"
"Nice job on the commercial too!""
"
"""This is cool, but I'm pretty concerned that this will compromise the integrity of the hull in case of a car accident.""
"
"How to destroy the integrity of the safest car in the world....
"
"That's ugly as all hell but damnit that is some dedication and good craftsmanship. She is a legend.
"
"Actually seeing the 3 without a bulbous rear end further makes me wish they offered a coupe...  that rear passenger space ruins the lines of the vehicle.
"
"That girl got hit with the fugly stick
"
"All the best car mods do. My bumper bar is totally still in place on my Miata in case anyone asks btw. I totally didn’t replace it with a massive intercooler...
"
"Doesn't look like she did much of the actual work....
"
"""I’m in the opposite boat. I love the rear end of the 3 and feel the front drops off into duck lips. So for me, I was sad to see the rear end removed, but it’s a homemade truck, and I love Simone, so I can support her even tho I don’t enjoy the looks.""
"
"This guy got hit with the moron stick
"
"""I thought you were referring to the model 3 conversion being ugly but no, your only comment was about the girl's looks. I think that says more about you than anything.""
"
"""wow, what a jackass you are. Must feel like a big man insulting someone who has probably done 100x in their life what you have while at the same time battling cancer""
"
"Yo momma
"
"For someone who’s obsessed with teenage mutant ninja turtle toys he sure is judgmental of others.
"
"She’s a looker!
"
"#BLUECREW UNITE!
"
"Congrats!  That’s a garage made for summon.
"
"Nice! Where are you shipping it to?
"
"Congrats! You will love supervising her fantastic driving habits!
"
"What does 16.3 indicate?
"
"Congrats!!! You are going to love it.
"
"""Picking mine up on Thursday (hopefully), same spec as yours. Can't wait!
"
"
"
"Congratulations on the car!""
"
"""As an Australian not provided with this desirable configuration, you may have one jealousy upvote.""
"
"🚀
"
"Tessa Tesla 👍🏻
"
"Love the Tessa name! Same as ours 😁
"
"Congrats - game changer!
"
"Congrats!!
"
"""FSD - check
"
"
"
"AWD - check
"
"
"
"LR battery - check
"
"
"
"Pearl White inside and out - well you can't have everything!
"
"
"
"You pass with flying colors!""
"
"A summonworthy garage. Nice.
"
"Omg all I did was watch YouTube tesla vids before getting my car lol. Must have seen Doug demuros video like 10 times
"
"congrats! she's beautiful.
"
"Getting all the ladies for me!
"
"Thanks and Definitely! tho the pic makes it looks a but smaller that it is. I'm lucky to get a garage at my apartment complex so can't complain!
"
"My garage is similar and summon will never work in it. The thing goes nuts on me with alarms and warnings every time I pull in or out :-(
"
"Lol that's my apartment garage
"
"She tends to drive me wild!
"
"Software version?
"
"Software version
"
"Already do!
"
"Thanks and you'll love it!
"
"I wanted a Tesla from I first saw it in 2011 so I understand what you're feeling.
"
"Lots of Tessa's but this one is mines!
"
"No such thing as failing once you own a Tesla 😁
"
"then I have everything plus 19'
"
"Actually never used summon in the garage.
"
"Lol all YouTube recommend to me is Tesla videos now.
"
"Thank you.
"
"I debated getting blue but I’ve been a silver and or gray car so long I just don’t seem to know how to break the cycle.
"
"""Whoa there Rico Suave!  Save some pussy for the rest of us!
"
"
"
"All joking aside, I'm a little jealous.  I was so on the fence about getting the metallic blue.  Opted for the pearl white for practicality.  Still love my LR AWD 3, though.  The only thing I'd change on it is to drop in an air suspension.""
"
"Does it come with an electric outlet?
"
"""you can use summon, just set the tolerances to minimal, and it will work fine.""
"
"Oh I don't doubt it! I've already set aside the weekend for just driving!
"
"""Yeah, even the base model is better than any ICE""
"
"It’s a pretty rad feature.
"
"Same here. Lol.
"
"Well am coming from a blue BMW so it was easier for me plus all the colors are great so can't go wrong with either!
"
"""Same here, but we broke the silver/grey cycle a few months earlier with a blue SUV and we couldn't go two blue cars so Grey it was.  I think the Tesla Blue looks much better than the Infinity Hermosa blue but what can I say, mistakes were made.""
"
"""The Pearl white is awesome! And done worry, you can have them when I'm done.
"
" Air suspension would definitely be nice.""
"
"Yes it does. 120v 15a. Charges at ~5m/hr which is plenty enough for my daily needs rn. I submitted an request to the head office asking if I could upgrade it to at least 240v 20a as that would save a lot of money as I could use the same wiring that's already there.
"
"At least any ICE that's under $200k.
"
"I've used it before but just never to go in or out the garage.
"
"I wonder how many of us Tesla people are coming from BMW’s? Seems pretty many.
"
"""Yeah, at least as an option. The springs do lend to a sportier more connected to the road feel. Sometimes it just gets old over LA's more poorly maintained side streets. 
"
"
"
"And naw, let's leave the sloppy seconds for the poor souls still driving Bimmers.""
"
"That's awesome!  I wish I had the same at my complex.
"
"Yeah. Saw a article once that BMW's is one of the top trade ins.
"
"+1 here
"
"Came from a 335d myself.  Never going back.  My last one caught on fire.
"
"""I know what you mean. Roads here in Connecticut is awful. 
"
"
"
"I was once one of those poor souls but no more!""
"
"How do you charge you car?
"
"\+2
"
"We have L2 charging stations @ work that I usually charge at for about $1.10/hr (comes out to about $0.18/Kwh).  Also my buddy manages a Nissan dealership a block from my house and allows me to use their chargers after hours if I need it.
"
"That's not bad. Probably cheaper than what i'm paying because I have to rent my garage.
"
"""Yeah, not bad at all seeing that it comes out to about 4 cents/mi vs 17 cents/mile on my last car that got 25mpg combined.""
"
"That's not bad. I use to get 20mpg!
"
"""Ouch!  Feels good not giving that money to Saudi princes anymore, doesn't it?""
"
"It does. I haven't even use any of my free 5k miles of supercharging yet.
"
"If I had waited ONE MORE DAY to place my order I would've gotten that 5K supercharging promotion.  FML.
"
"""Bummer, I feel your pain.""
"
"""For those curious, the lock confirmation sound is one honk. Unlock has two honks.""
"
"Finally! Been relying on mirror auto fold as lock confirmation so far. Looking forward to this update!
"
"Same!
