"To all of those saying “keep the software team in a different state than the manufacturing team” remember Tesla’s history of keeping both departments working in the exact same building.

"
"""Wow, a lot of haters in this thread.  A few points to remember, especially as this is the tesla subreddit . . .
"
"
"
"1.  Elon Musk has worked tirelessly for years to advance electric cars.  He's proved he's not in this for the lavish lifestyle money can buy.  He's a true believer.  Saying he's trying to increase his net worth implies a total and unexplained shift in motivation for him.
"
"
"
"2.  Coronavirus and Covid-19 have, in fact, proven far less dangerous than originally feared.  Elon saw this play out already in China, where Tesla employs 7000 people and not one died.  That isn't Chinese inflated numbers--it's direct data from Tesla payroll.  Stateside, we're seeing that unless you're in a nursing home already or health compromised, you have a very low chance of succumbing to the disease.  When 1.5 million a year die in car accidents and less than 100,000 elderly have died from this mild pandemic, does it really make sense to stay closed indefinitely?
"
"
"
"3.  California governor and Freemont mayor support Tesla reopening.  County guidelines state energy storage is essential . . . yet Tesla has been singled out to stay closed.  Under those facts, should Elon fight for his company and his employees, or just fold his hands and wait?
"
"
"
"4.  The only two ways through this are a vaccine or herd immunity.  The fastest a vaccine has ever been developed in this country is 4 years, with an average closer to 10.  When young healthy people are at very low risk, does it make more sense to re-open with safe practices, or stay closed and hide until there is a vaccine some number of years down the road?
"
"
"
"5.  Elon's position on closures has been that nothing should be forced.  If you're 80 years old and have diabetes, or are obese, you may choose to isolate at home.  But if you're healthy and in your 20s, 30s, or 40s, and really need your income to keep your home and feed your family, does a government mandated total closure really make sense?  The authorities have already demonstrated they don't have the tools to handle this crisis, and have lost our trust.
"
"
"
"I honestly don't get the criticism.  Elon has accomplished so much, and to see this subreddit turn against him because he's studied the issue and has decided to keep moving forward is strange.  I side with Elon.  I side with continuing to move forward.""
"
"Elon Musk is the stupidest smart person in the land.

"Alameda county is never gonna financially recover from this

"""I don’t understand why he keep tweeting like a maniac, just do whatever you want to do without this drama . Because at best you sound like you have a mental breakdown.""

"

"[""
"
"""And when Texas and Nevada don’t bend to Elon, where will he move? And when will he end up just making all his cars by robotics?""
"
"""On the one hand I do see where he's coming from. Tesla runs on slim margins and needs this. It's situations like this that policy makers can truly earn their public-funded pay. Keeping Tesla in Alameda keeps jobs there. That should be important enough that Elon throwing tantrums should result in the policy makers coming up with a plan with him to reopen. Which I'm sure he's open to.
"
"
"
"Just straight up saying no is not the right move and is frankly lazy on the policy makers part. There's no reason not to set up proper measures, introduce a temporary oversight committee to ensure measures are being carried out by Tesla, and justify these means because in the end you'd keep jobs in Alameda. They should be able to do this. CA residents sure as hell pay the taxes for it and run the state on a surplus for this. Not for measures that can be carried out by anyone.""

Tesla isn't really something you think of as a big presence or job maker in the region - it's a factory you point out to visitors to the area. I've met people working for nearly every major American (and Korean and Japanese) tech company I could think of - except Tesla. If anything, this will be small change compared to the immense number of other companies in the area that will inevitably lay off and tighten belts and the start ups and suppliers that will go belly up in this crisis, not to mention that the housing market will probably be flooded with foreclosures and our notoriously high housing prices will drop. But Tesla? I don't think that will have a huge impact and I think even if their HQ is moved, they'll have to have a satellite campus here just for the tech worker job pool.On the other hand, I can't be certain as to how many companies play a role in supplying Tesla that will face issues and leave the Bay Area because of this. And the Bay Area's been waiting for an exodus for a while because of the high cost of living and presence of good climate and resources elsewhere (cough Austin cough). However, I don't think Elon poses much of a threat on his own to the Bay Area's economy, unles he starts a trend of companies leaving.

"Edit: I'm not sure what he means by """"last carmaker left in CA"""" because in terms of carmakers headquartered in CA, there haven't been a whole lot of major ones ever afaik. But if he meant """"last carmaker manufacturing in CA"""" he's kinda wrong. Even though it is true that almost all car factories that used to be in CA have closed, Toyota still has some kind of manufacturing plant in Long Beach. So I'm not really sure what he means by """"last carmaker in CA"""" as a threat; carmaking hasn't been a major thing in California for a while as far as I know.At any rate, I think a lot of people were expecting for Tesla to move anyways. My dad used to commute past their factory and always commented that he can't understand how it is practical for them to do their manufacturing here when they could do it cheaper in some other old car manufacturing plant somewhere else in the country. He still remembers when that Tesla plant was a Toyota/GM plant and said there's a reason why Toyota and GM ditched it. Perhaps the factory's in Fremont to be close to R&D, but that seems less and less necessary.

"* China is back to full operation and doing fine according to Telsa's 7000 employees their - and zero have died according to payroll. He also believes the virus traveled around the world faster than we believe considering 100,000 people travel to and from Wuhan daily.

Some of you have quoted that the [Supreme Court ruled in 1824]( States have the power to enforce quarantines and limit personal freedoms for public health emergencies. In this case it is a county.
"
"* Another statement he made surrounded the economy - that it can't function without society working to build it. Stating something along the lines that he believes some people just think the economy / wall street pull wealth from thin air and don't take into account the entire supply chain that is not working - producers, co-packers, distribution centers, truckers, stores...
"
"* After stating that the initial prediction were a factor of 10x to 50x off, and looking at the actual numbers coming in - He also ask why there isn't an uproar about obesity deaths (300,000 per year -  National Institutes of Health ) or smoking deaths (nearing 500,000 / year). Yes, one can argue you do both of these to yourself and covid is contagious without showing symptom (though secondhand smoke kills 41,000 per year according to the CDC), but im just passing along the info they talked about.

"- China is back to full operation.  Let's be clear.  This is because the citizens followed health orders completely, and eradicated the virus. The US growth rate _with lockdown_ is still R > 1.  Thanks to idiots like Elon Musk.  If the US could just follow the rules, it would be R<0, they would eliminate it, and then quarantines could fully re-open the country.

People are compelled to leave their place of work if there is a fire.  Or if there is a terrorist threat.  Or any other public safety issue.   
"
"- After stating that the initial prediction were a factor of 10x to 50x off, and looking at the actual numbers coming in - He also ask why there isn't an uproar about obesity deaths (300,000 per year - National Institutes of Health ) or smoking deaths (nearing 500,000 / year).   It is very important to note that the predictions didn't change.  The IFR has always been assessed as 0.3% to 0.9%.  This window merely narrowed from 0.1% to 1.5%.  That means, if 80% of the US gets it, 2M people likely die.  The reason they have not YET, is because of the distancing measures.  This is ridiculously more urgent than obesity.""

HOWEVER, if Musk claims a violation of constitutional rights then the courts can review it, at least to the degree it allegedly violates the constitution, without deferring to the legislature, since the courts CAN review on their own whether the constitution is being infringed.

"
"Warren Buffet speaks very openly about whether he thinks Berkshire is undervalued or overvalued. And he communicates clearly that if/when the stock is undervalued he will buyback stock.""
"
"""Elon is 100% right about the share price being too high, I mean they haven’t produced anything in the USA in weeks (which also supplies some parts to the China factory), there isn’t a firm date set for production resuming in the USA, demand will have no doubt dropped off a cliff, and doesn’t look likely to pick up anytime soon with the economy in tatters, around the world. 
"
"
"
"If he surprised if demand is 1/4 of what it was for the first 6 months after production resumes. Way too many people around the world are losing their jobs, way too many people are on reduced workloads, and with all this quantitative easing going on around the world, surely the knock on affect is increased prices (as well as the fact that they aren’t likely to resume production on the same scale).

I'm obviously speculating here but I think being stuck inside triggered another episode like when he was cooped up in the factory. Mind you this is a very generous theory because I respect the man. I think he underestimates the potential mental health risks of his social media use because he believes he's inoculated due to his intellect. That's obviously not the case. He needs to take a break. For everyone's sake at this point. My main long term investment is stock in his company. He's doing me real damage by not taking care of himself.

People won't invest in the ecosystem and they wont be able to sustain the first-party principles that relied on people purchasing multiple products at a premium. Their product line is getting more and more fragmented also, totally against their ethos. In their demos they do more of and more of the """"list of features"""" types of promotions that they used to shun.

By contrast, things like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad were all revolutionary products that seemingly created a new market out of thin air.

[Here is an example of the weekly updates Alameda county produces for residents]( in Alameda county, has been outstanding in addressing this issue with the public. FWIW she specializes in pediatric infectious diseases, so when it comes to viral spreads, her judgement carries more weight than a billionaire who struck it rich on selling PayPal.

"That Elon has gotten into a tantrum with one of the few bright spots in the governance hierarchy, is not a good look for him among folks in the Bay Area. Regardless of whether the order is from the State or the County, *any* one persons demands are meaningless in a public health crisis. Alameda County is making the right call to keep things closed. Again, I live here, Elon doesnt. He lives in Bel Air, probably next door to the Fresh Prince. His concern is about P/L statements, not the health of his workers or their families.
"
"
"
" Elon has no standing to make this case in the midst of this public health crisis. His personal battle here does harm to his brand in a way that no one else can. Will people stop buying Teslas? no. Will the brand suffer as its helmed by someone clearly uninterested in anything but profit? Likely.

"I completely understand that people will be negatively impacted by a lockdown. I have friends out of jobs, and I know it can be touch on people's mental health. But what I haven't seen is any data at all that says just how many people are negatively impacted in a serious way (beyond just boredom. I'm talking things like suicide attempts, lack of food, losing utilities, etc.). Because so far Covid has killed over 80,000 people, and sent countless others to the hospital.. not to mention all the people that get sick and don't go to the hospital. So if the economic impacts would get that bad, then sure, open things up. But if not, then I think it's better to save more lives.
"
"
"
"I think the solution is simply just more 'stimulus' payments to everyone. $2k/month for everyone, and we're pretty much set. Not a perfect solution, but wayyyy better than just sending people to work in an unsafe environment.
"
"
"
"&#x200B;
"
"
"
"The other part of this that's often overlooked is that most people aren't being given the 'option' to go back to work, they're being forced to go back to work when things re-open. If you don't go back to work when you job comes back, you lose your job to someone that's more willing to risk their health/life (or the health/lives of others) for that paycheck.
"
"
"
"Another often overlooked piece of the puzzle is that until there's a vaccine, people at higher risk just can't go out at all. They can't ride a train because it could be crowded, they can't go grocery shopping if they're not 100% sure that they can socially distance (like cashiers wearing masks, for example). I have a family member in this situation. She's a medical professional (runs a department in a hospital), and she told me that without a vaccine, we either have enough cases to get herd immunity (which means a LOT of people getting a serious illness that could have been mitigated), or there's a vaccine, but the vaccine won't be widely available for quite awhile.
"
"
"
"And lastly, people are STILL not wearing masks at crowded places like grocery stores, because they think that the beginning of a phased re-opening (in my state, at least) means that things are good now and we're safe. But the number of cases is just beginning to plateau, it hasn't really even gone down yet. So the faster we re-open, the more we'll have idiots walking around acting like everything's fine, while spreading Covid to TONS of other people. Then it spreads like wildfire in round two, and we have to start from scratch.
"
"
"
"&#x200B;
"
"
"
"So again, the best solution, in my opinion, is lock things down, test like crazy until we can get the vast majority of the cases isolated until they're healthy again, pay people enough to eat until then, then re-open much more quickly instead of a multi-month phased re-opening.""

Some People are acting like this is so cut and dry and that the County can't possibly be taking the wrong actions here.

Even the Alameda County Government classifies Tesla as an essential business (and therefore should be allowed to reopen). Hell even one of the County supervisors said that he though Tesla had done really well at outlining how they were going to open safely, and that HE THOUGHT they could have potentially agreed to open by May 18th (problem is that date wasn't certain, it was just """"likely""""). Tesla has manufacturing operational in a neighboring county, has an entire factory fully operational IN CHINA (without any employees dying), and Elon has SpaceX in LA (and Texas/Washington) which has been 100% operational this entire time because they are an essential business providing access to Space (Launching Astronauts to the ISS from the US on May 27th for first time in nearly a decade!!!)... So the point is Elon has a lot of data on this about his companies being operational and keeping his employees safe. Every other Auto Manufacturer (including in areas hit MUCH worse than Alameda, like Michigan and the South) has the green-light to restart their manufacturing.

The store shelves missing rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer also serves as evidence. To add insult to injury, hoarders needed to be shutdown for creating shortages so they could price gouge while reselling online, making matters that much worse.

If Alex Jones told me that the earth is round because they put chemicals in the air that turned it from a disc into a sphere, he would be wrong and crazy, but his agreement with me that the earth is round would not make me doubt my own position.

"""6. More stimulus will help temporarily, but there will also be consequences of that.  Do you know where the money comes from? We have to reimburse the source. That also won't cure our shortage problem.  We need supplies. If we can't sterilize, we can't really rid ourselves of the virus. If we can't boost our immune systems, we can't truly rid ourselves of the virus.  We don't have the resources to maintain the quarantine through mid-summer, let alone through the end of the year. People are already choosing between paying their rent and feeding their families.  The stimulus packages will cost trillions of dollars by the year's end. If we don't have workers for tax revenue, we LITERALLY can't pay for it. If for no other reason, the people need to work to at least have healthcare.  We need medical staff on the job, not sitting at home.

"
"
"

"
"8. People at higher risk don't have to go out.  This is why it's important to report illnesses and disabilities.  There are already protections in place for that with your employment rights.  If there is significant risk of death caused by the pandemic due to your health predisposition, the employer can't legally force you to return to work.  You can just as easily report that infraction and even she for it. If you have heart disease, they can't force you back to work. If you're a senior citizen, they can't force you back to work.  If you have AIDs or a documented weak immune system, they can't force you back to work, etc. These are protected by labor laws around age prejudice and people with disabilities. You would only need the documentation and to pay attention, prepared to argue that you remain capable of doing the work but the situation doesn't allow for you to return to the environment yet.

"A whole lot of people don't need to wait for a vaccine because they can handle the virus just fine.  Putting a chokehold on the entire country for the minority who do isn't a very good strategy.

If Arizona doesn't release my unemployment or the stimulus payment isn't approved and I receive it right away, I have to starve for the next three weeks as I await my first post furlough paycheck.  My immune system will do SERIOUS damage to my body during that time and the lack of food will spike my seizure activity. I've gone status before, just two weeks ago as well, and I'll go status again without food. The likelihood of recovering from status without immediate medical attention is low.  If I go status in my sleep again, no one will know. I'm likely to literally die a casualty to the fallout from the disease and not the disease itself, while being cooperative. How is that fair? It's okay for people like me to die just because most of America is afraid of the POTENTIAL of not feeling well for a week or two?

"9. No, they're not wearing masks because of the crazy prices and the shortages.  They can't afford more and they've run out. Maybe some believe that, however, I assure you the majority just don't have access to them anymore.  Also, immunology is a good reason to go without the mask if you can handle it. Be clean, eat healthily, take supplements for what you're deficient in, drink plenty of water, see the doctor when sick, and just get it over with.  You'll have the antibodies you need to combat it after that. Covid-19 is not the first Coronavirus. We are exposed to them and successfully fight them off every day. Mishandling is why this one got as bad as it did. This isn't like what happened with H1N1, and we stamped out the previous SARS quickly and with relative ease.  Don't hide from the problem, FIX the problem.
"
"
"
"
"
"There are studies about the flattening of the curve.  There's a very strong correlation with the occurrence happening as the virus runs its course.  This has been happening regardless of quarantining. That means that herd immunity is working.
"
"
"
"
"
"10. I disagree.  What should have happened was international travel should have been suspended (because fleeing tourists spread the disease globally), only the hotspots should've been quarantined (no one in or out), those at risk should've been sequestered, those who were in anyway sick should have been under stricter quarantine (stay at home orders), buying limits should have been imposed to prevent hoarding and panic buying, supplies should have been administered evenly to everyone, medical facilities should've been funded, the healthy should've been allowed to work, those unable to work should've received stimulus money and unemployment benefits, and there should've been a heavy focus on public health in the way of cleanliness.  Enforcing the quarantine has caused loads of officers to be infected and that itself is keeping the virus actively spreading. A much smaller quarantine and smaller details would actually protect more people from becoming infected. Just look at Indonesia. That's what they did.

"I will refute a few of your points though. One is that it seems like you're conflating herd immunity with generally healthy immune systems. Herd immunity means you had so many people already get the virus, that it doesn't really spread anymore because there aren't nearly as many people to spread it to. That requires that you have a pretty significant portion of the population get it. It also requires a virus where getting it means you're immune to it for a period of time that's long enough to have it die down pretty much completely in the general population. At this point, we just don't know how long immunity will last after you've contracted it (this is according to a family friend in the medical field that's currently working on ventilator technology, so he's done his homework).
"
"
"
"I think you're conflating that with peoples' immune systems in general. Yes, they'll suffer because we're not in constant contact with other people's germs. But I honestly don't know how quickly your immune system drops in quarantine, and how long it takes before quarantine makes you significantly more likely to contract it when coming into a person that's currently infected. As for getting vitamin D, I don't think any of the quarantines should enforce staying literally inside all day. Go out for a walk and don't walk near anyone. Sit on your porch, sit at a park, just stay away from people. Easy way to get some sun without going back to work.

You could post on social media asking if anyone has an extra, and you'll get plenty of responses. And yet, even at a reasonably-upscale grocery store (i.e. not an Aldi/Food Lion/whatever), most people today were not wearing a mask.

"""A tool for sure.  I think everyone, myself certainly included, acts without rationality at least 95% of the time, some 100%.  Our default mode is to go with instinct and emotion, and even when we do reason, it’s often just to create a post hoc rationalization to sell the merits of our actions and desires to others so that we maintain our social reputation, which itself is an emotional imperative based on our insecurity of our ability to acquire resources on our own over a long period of time.  So reason is a powerful tool but it’s often just the amoral servant of our ulterior motives.  In order to set reason free, it’s important to turn it against ourselves whenever appropriate, and to make our base impulses and ego subservient to reason.  This is way easier said than done, but by carefully parsing things out and aiming for the truth (not that we can ever really get to it with certainty, but it’s a great thing to aim for), we can occasionally have lucid moments where we can look around and see things like partisan groupthink and general hysteria.  In that state of mind, we see ourselves for the chimps that we are, and this reinforces the beauty and necessity of following reason.  We are so lucky to have this ability, should we choose to use it.  
"
"
"
"All that said, I think reason is just a tool.  Life is mostly instinct and emotion and survival.  I’ve looked for fulfillment in reason alone and I haven’t  yet found it.  So we can’t ask too much of this tool, and it’s not the kind of thing to put excessive amounts of faith in.  But of course, it’s senseless to live without reason.""

"""Nah, I'm not conflating it with that.  Those are the mechanics of it.  A huge part of herd immunity is the healthy immune system.  Most of the herd is outside of the bracket, so those people would benefit from returning to normal life, the virus will end up with no where to go, and it'll stop propagating.  On the other hand, coronavirus can survive hours on copper, a day on cardboard, and several days on plastic and steel.  Hiding indoors with weakening immune systems is just going to enable the virus to keep recycling through the communities.  You have to go out eventually, you'll have to touch stuff, and there will be mistakes and accidents.  It's better to have an immune system that's prepared for it than it is not to.
"
"
"
"In the stay at home model, everyone's immune systems are weakening.  When anyone becomes infected and symptomatic, they go out for supplies or care, they spread it anyway.  Others who have to be out there, like cops, then pick it up.  Those people come in contact with other people who have weakened immune systems due to the shelter in place order and the cycle repeats.  More people are worse off that way.
"
"
"
"Conversely, getting the necessary exposure while healthy and getting it over with is better for those outside of the bracket.  Their immune systems are strong, they come in contact, defeat the virus, and others who are out there are doing the same when they're exposed.  One is a much shorter path to herd immunity.  Interestingly, the people imposing the national quarantines are the people violating the policy the most.  It's because they know how it really works and, for some reason, don't want to admit that they got this wrong.
"
"
"
"We can't afford to be afraid of the duration of immunity.  Even if immunity is only good for a year, that's better than sitting at home with zero immunity and helping the virus survive by introducing new hosts for it to gain strength in.  People are failing to see the big picture here.  We need to extinguish this thing quickly so that people in the bracket can return to normal lives and aren't at increased risk of being killed by it.  The longer we draw this out, the worse off they'll be.  They're immune systems are being hampered by this policy too.  If they couldn't fight it off before, they're going to be in even more trouble the longer this big quarantine lasts.
"
"
"
"Nah, you're going to come into contact with others and the virus at some point, which is a source of a lot of tension regarding this.  For instance, the at least 6ft policy is ineffective.  Coronavirus can survive in air for up to 3 hours.  That's a long time and hundreds - thousands of people can walk through that affected zone in that time.  All it takes is one misdirected sneeze into the open air for a bunch of other passersby to pick up and carry the disease.  Air is always moving, so the aerosol droplets carrying the virus don't always quickly settle on the ground.  The government isn't delivering supplies to our doorsteps.  The services offering it become expensive quite quickly.  That quick toilet paper run you make to your nearby shop is all it takes.  You're exposed.  You had to come in contact with someone or the virus at some point along the way.

"It's not apathy.  The shortage was caused by hoarders, panic buyers, and price fixing manufacturers.  It's not that the people don't care, it's that the crisis profiteers and the panickers have made a mess of everything.  You can look at any Covid-19 buying frenzy fight video and see that apathy isn't the issue.  They're not fighting because they don't care, they're fighting because they do, and that's why they're so afraid.  You can go on Amazon right now and find short supplies of surgical masks that are way overpriced.  Can you afford to pay $26 for only a 50 pack of masks every 2 - 4 weeks?  If over 4 million people can't afford to pay their rent, they'll surely be hard-pressed to pay that much for masks too.  And of the sellers providing the masks for that price, most of them are shipping overseas, so the product won't even show up for a month or more.

"Staff are supplied those things by their employer.  It's easier for them to have gloves and mask when the establishment they work for can afford to pay the high costs for it.  You can't fairly assume people are just refusing in mass based on you seeing employees being compliant.  The anti-quarantine movement is still small.  They're the minority.  There hasn't been a large uptick in numbers since they started protesting, it's just been bandwagoners giving hot takes on the internet to make those people look bad because someone turned out to be infected.  But those people were likely already infected while they were compliant with the quarantine.

"Studies are showing evidence that Covid-19 got out of China and into other parts of the world as early as November.  In just the US, we had confirmed Covid-19 deaths as early as the first week of February, which means the virus was spreading in this country at least since January: ht-now-what/

">  Coronavirus isn’t some plague. It’s very bad cold with similar death numbers to flu. 
"
"
"
"This is where you're clearly, demonstrably wrong. Coronavirus is a PANDEMIC. No, it's not a plague because it's not bacterial, but that just means that we can't use antibiotics to cure ourselves. Coronavirus is NOT a very bad cold, it's influenza, and the death numbers are SIGNIFICANTLY worse. The death rate right now is around .06% globally, whereas the seasonal flu is around .01%. Last year's flu season (October through May) killed around 61,000 people, whereas Coronavirus has killed almost 300,000 people.. in the last TWO MONTHS.
"
"
"
"It's not just a bad cold. For the young and healthy, sure, it may seem like just another flu. But for people with all kinds of medical issues or risks, it can be so much worse. Just looking at the death rate doesn't tell you everything. A lot of people are hospitalized.

Who has more incentive to lie, the people making money off the economy re-opening early, or the people whose job it is to save the lives of all the people dying?""

If we all return to normal life, everyone will get it rapidly, and it'll then quickly get passed on to those at-risk people that can't just stay at home and wait. Then many of those people will die or get very sick, and that's not what we want, right?

"
"
"
"> People are failing to see the big picture here. We need to extinguish this thing quickly so that people in the bracket can return to normal lives and aren't at increased risk of being killed by it. 
"
"
"
"I think the big picture is that if everyone that had even a reasonable chance of coming into contact with a carrier were to just avoid contact as much as possible for a month, the virus would die out in the population pretty much completely, then everyone could start getting back to normal much quickly. We wouldn't need full herd immunity because there wouldn't be more cases of coronavirus we needed to protect ourselves from (other than maybe international travel), but that could be dealt with through testing or other methods).
"
"
"
"Instead, we're doing these half-assed lockdowns where people aren't taking it seriously because the president of the US won't even wear a mask and called the whole thing a hoax. This 'hoax' that has killed 80k+ Americans. Just because we flubbed the response initially doesn't mean we should just give up now and let it get to the rest of the population instead of trying to contain it.
"
"
"
"> You can't fairly assume people are just refusing in mass based on you seeing employees being compliant.  
"
"
"
"That's the opposite of the point I was making. I'm saying that EVEN THE EMPLOYEES aren't being compliant, when the masks are free and *mandated* by their employer. So if I see 25% of the employees not wearing masks when both the CDC and their employer say they should wear masks, then OF COURSE the 'general public' is also just not wearing masks because they don't want to. If 25% of the Home Depot and grocery store employees aren't wearing masks at work, that means those same people are also not wearing masks when they go shopping at other stores. Availability is clearly not the big problem with masks. You can get cheap re-usable masks on Amazon that work just fine for the majority of people. You can get a bandana, or just put your face in the neck of your shirt. You can rip up an old t-shirt, which is still way better than nothing.
"
"
"
">  Yeah, we could do those other things but fat chance of making the leadership actually do it. 
"
"
"
"Well yeah, that's a huge part of the problem. The white house admin did almost nothing to prevent this thing in the very beginning, the president himself doesn't wear a mask because he cares more about his political image than the health and safety of the entire US. They're not going to do the right thing no matter what, because they do whatever they think will help them stay in power (for their own personal gain). 
"
"
"
"As for not being able to afford to grow the debt, we could easily afford it if we switched to single-payer healthcare, taxed the billionaires more (whether that's through a wealth tax, higher capital gains taxes, higher inheritance taxes, etc.), and trimmed down things like the military budget. Jeff Bezos is worth as much as $483 per person in the United states. The top 1% in the US are worth \~$30 trillion dollars. The US could easily afford to feed and house everyone if we actually wanted to make that happen. But we don't, because we don't want to infringe on a hundred-millionaire's right to earn unlimited income while still being taxed the same amount on income as someone making $200k/year.
"
"
"
"I completely understand that people making minimum wage at a fast-food restaurant can't afford to be at home forever. But if the government is able to send out a $1200 check on fairly short notice, they can send out a few more of those without destroying the country.
"
"
"
"And if that helps everyone stay safe from coronavirus for long enough to avoid the hospitals being overcrowded and running out of PPE, that saves a lot of lives, and ultimately helps the economy because people would be able to go back to normal much quicker if we fix this completely first, instead of trying to act like everything is normal for the next 6 months, while still practicing social distancing everywhere (which ends up costing businesses a ton of money). 
"
"
"
"&#x200B;
"
"
"
"Another piece of the puzzle is testing. It takes time to develop accurate tests. Accurate testing lets you know who's still healthy and who's already had the virus, which means you can track people who have been in close contact with the virus and isolate them so they don't spread it. If we can hold down the number of cases for longer, that gives us more time to develop and mass-produce fast, accurate tests. Once we can test everyone quickly and accurately, we can reduce the spread much more easily. But in the beginning we have really no way of knowing whether or not people are carriers for the first couple days after they contract it. So if nothing else, social distancing helps us get close to the point where testing is widely available, without a million more people dying to get to herd immunity.""

The CDC had just spent months trying to find a way to blame us for EVALI when they knew from the start it was vitamin e acetate added to THC cartridges by illegal drug dealers. Completely unrelated to us. The funny part is it was Cuomo's NY health department that went public with that information first, yet he continued to blame us for EVALI as he tried and failed to ban vaping, then he ended up ramming it through attached to the COVID response bill. We would officially be an illegal product as of a few days ago in fact, if not for the virus getting the courts to grant an extension to September.

"In fact, that """"bullshit moral panic"""" about vaping is a large part of why we failed to respond to COVID-19.

The CDC was still desperately trying to blame us for EVAIL even though they knew since August it was not true. The FDA was busy putting together a flavor ban in response to all that moral panic.

As to my opinion of the autosteer feature in general - personally, I don’t believe Tesla should allow drivers to use it where the manual says it should not be used. They choose to shift the responsibility onto the driver, and it results in potentially dangerous situations.
"
"

"""Pretty much totally agree with you. Autopilot is extremely unreliable on city streets, although it works fine like 95% of the time. The other 5% is merging into the oncoming left turn lane at big intersections, ignoring mail trucks that are mostly off the road at mailboxes, and slamming on the brakes going under overpasses and large signs.
"
"

A is a direct instruction not to use the feature. B talks about a different feature that may come on if you violate A. To me, it’s pretty clear which one describes where the manufacturer did not intend the feature to work. You do you, though.""

"""Until it is updated, it means just one thing: Tesla is not comfortable enough to remove the ban. If you think you know the limitations better than they do, you are being naive and endangering yourself and others.""
"
"""Yes but you said outright that Tesla does not intend for Autosteer to function on city streets, the fact that Tesla releases a feature to respond to stop signs (which only exist on city streets) and then explicitly said in the description that said feature can be used on Autosteer, implies that Tesla does indeed expect you to use Autosteer on city streets. Otherwise they never would allow city driving features to be used on Autosteer, let alone describe it explicitly in the manual. You are trying really hard to be right, but I think it’s clear to the rest of us that you’re splitting hairs that don’t matter.

"""Tesla knows Autopilots limitations very well, but they obviously are very conservative in their official statements. I don’t know if you uses autopilot on city streets, but it works pretty good, and the update improves navigation through intersections significantly.

We both have wanted a Tesla for a while and finally crunched the numbers and it became doable to get one.  You can have just as much fun in a standard range RWD Model 3 for almost half the price.

"

"Also, does the mulching work well?  My current gas mower is a mulching mower, but it always develops a large amount of clippings that sit on the top of the rear rubber flap (like the clippings are escaping from under the mower), it's pretty annoying.""

"
"Me three! Got an Ego electric mower. Now I just need an electric snow blower for the winter and I can toss the oil and gas from my garage entirely.
"
"""This comment is underrated.  
"
"My Tesla Substitute has been an Electric Scooter.""
"
"Or having to deal with gas or oil.  Literally the machine just works. I left the battery in over winter and as I walked by it my jacket caught the green handle. The mower jumped forward scaring the crap out of me.  I mow the entire yard on the charge left from the previous season.  Normally with my gas mower I would have fought to get it working.
"
"Incredible power!
"
"""When we let the grass get high the mower really can't cover our whole yard with a single battery on a single charge, and our yard really isn't particularly large.
"
"
"
"But there are significant differences between mowing with an electric unit and an ICE unit:
"
"
"
"* It always Just Works. No gas to run out of, no oil to change, no engine to foul with water or who knows what else, no spark plug to change. Mowing is already tedious; anything that gets in the way means it probably gets skipped this week. And maybe next, too.
"
"* It's really quiet. You don't need hearing protection.
"
"* There's barely any setup or cleanup. Just drop the battery before you start and return it to the charger when your finished.
"
"* Your hands won't feel like you've developed nerve damage from the vibration after you've finished.
"
"
"
"Taken all together, these factors make mowing dramatically more pleasant and therefore dramatically more likely to occur. My wife will just pop outside and mow part of the yard for ten minutes at a time few times a week. (She LOVES this mower.) So, we're not really limited by the battery. And the battery recharges in about 45 minutes, anyway.""
"
"""I have an Ego mower, this is my second season with it, it is the previous model than the one linked above.  It takes me about 45 min to cut my grass, and I have never seen the warning light come on that indicates less than 15% remaining.  As for mulching, I do not use the bag, and always mulch, it does about as well as my old sears craftsman did, but that's not saying much.  If you stay on top of your cutting you won't have an issue mulching.  When I let the grass go for a bit it will get clogged up and leave some clipping piles.  It is very quiet, but not so much for the user, people 20 feet away think it's quiet enough for them to talk to you, but it is too loud for the person using it to hear.  I try to explain that to my neighbors lol.""
"
"So what you should do is buy the mower that comes with a 5 amp hour battery than the weed eater that has a 2.5 amp hour.  The batteries are interchangeable md charge fast.  Mulching is as good as my old gas mower.  I can mow my lawn about three Times on a charge.
"
"Not sure how anyone could ever complain my wife can’t even hear the mower in out house.  The mower is quieter than most air conditioning units.  The electric blower I used to blow out the car and get the water off after I was it.
"
"""I want an electric snow blower so bad too, but the ego scares me because it’s only a single stage.""
"
"Hated fighting with a gas mower getting it going again after winter. No mas!
"
"""Yeah, I’m not sure about it either. I just really hate my gas one. It’s big and heavy... and it needs gas and oil. It’s overkill and a pain for anything but a very heavy snowfall.""
"
"""I hate trying to get it up and running at the start of eveey winter. I know I need to be better at maintaining it, or just get electric where you dint have to!""
"
"""Exactly. Anything that runs on gas is just an archaic pain in the ass. Mowed my lawn for the first time this summer last week. No worries, just works.""

Also realize that teslas customer service, their repair service, and their diagnostic abilities are not at the level of refinement of the dealerships who have been at this for a hundred years.  If they don't know the answer, they just wing an explanation that sounds like it might work.  If you are going to own these cars, you just kind of know that this comes with the territory.  Just like the panel gaps and all kinds of fit and finish issues.  But overall, it's going to be the best car you have probably ever owned for a lot of reasons.

At the time I followed slightly different advice of dropping below 20% and charging to 100% (but 90% seems to be the advice now). We went back up to 309 after doing this just once. We are “back down” to 303 miles but haven’t bothered to do this again. Partly because I figure we would expect to have some degradation after 2 years.""

"Yes I was told same thing by Tesla.  So I modified my charging habits.  I have the obdii adapter and scan my Tesla.   So I can see what the BMS thinks is the usable capacity of the pack.  At its worse my pack cavity was 67.7 kWh.  New it should have been around 75.   Since I have changed my charging habits it has gone up to 69.9.   They said this is something that will slowly change over time as the BMS needs lots of data points.   So you can’t just do one calibration and it fixes it.

"""Not so much burying your head in the sand as switching to the thing that is actually being measured.  The miles range is just a best guess by the BMS that is often quite inaccurate.  Even if the car says 288 miles if you charged to 100% and then took the vehicle out and drove it gently on country roads at or around 50 MPH you would probably figure out the estimate is complete nonsense somewhere around the 375 mile mark when the battery would actually be getting low under those usage conditions.
"
"
"
"% on the other hand is a much more consistent because it is much closer to the only real thing being measured by the BMS: battery voltage.  Capacity is just a guess based on changing voltage and a measurement of how much energy the battery has released or absorbed.  Also the battery voltage can vary by temperature, load, and a dozen other things which can throw off the estimate.  The battery is not like a fuel tank where you can easily measure the capacity, you can only know how full it is at any given time and use that to make a rough extrapolation of how much it holds.""

In terms of the rear seat, I have the same issue and I hear a rattle from that mid alignment, pretty sure it’s the right rear passenger seat rubbing against the middle seat.

"""because they want to deliver the product as soon as possible to claim capital expenses on their returns. The sooner it's delivered to production, the sooner they recoup money back on the books for tax benefits. Since other manufacturers have tons of existing models to generate revenue, they have the benefit of taking a lot longer to develop a better process before going to market. In the beginning other manufacturers went through the same thing, they have just been around for 100 years by now so their process is archaic but better QA process.""

"I was quoted $6200 - $6500 for full body Xpel stealth at two different shops. I think I am just going to go with a partial gloss wrap on the front area for around $2000. Still seems like a lot since my first car was $4000.

"It's not hard, it's just tedious & time-consuming.  I did a comparison with my buddy:

"1. I had mine done professionally (Opticoat & Glassparency)
"
"2. My buddy did his own
"
"
"
"Mine is going on 2 years now & all I have to do is wash it off with water.  I spent so much time in the past doing washes & waxes, and now a simple weekly rinse is all I need to keep it looking incredible.  Previously, I would do a 3-day wax job with a couple coats of carnauba paste & a third coat of liquid synthetic with 24-hour cures inbetween.I had no idea ceramic even existed prior to getting mine, but man, it's just stupid good & ultra low-maintenance.  My car looks *amazing* with it on:
"
"
"
"* [
"
"
"
"*However*...they both (pro & DIY) came out equally amazing.  Buuuuuuut my buddy paid 1/10th the price I did, because he provided the labor himself.  The keys for going the DIY route are patience, time, and following a solid procedure to do the job right.  His Model 3 (black) looks absolutely *incredible* with ceramic.  100% worth the effort, if you are interested in DIY!
"
"
"
"There are a lot of great vendors on the market these days; most of them have kits available for under $200 & a lot of them are under $100.  Scott H's channel has a great long-term shootout here:
"
"
"
"* [
"
"
"
"If I were to do it again, I would go the DIY route & use the following:
"
"
"
"* Adam's UV Ceramic Paint Coating Kit with Light ($130)
"
"* Rain-X 2-in-1 glass cleaner & rain repellent
"
"
"
"Adam's basically dummy-proofs it with the UV light system, which is sheer genius.  I would suggest doing the wheels as well, it makes keeping the rims spotless super duper easy.  The Rain-X is pretty much equal to the Glassparency in terms of performance; it simply has to be applied more often, which is an easy job.
"
"
"
"**Bonus notes:**
"
"
"
"1. If you have access to a hose at home, I'd suggest getting a Brush Hero for the rims, as it makes cleaning them super easy.  Also, if you can do a wheels-off ceramic coat job, that's the ideal route.  I had that done on my car & it has made overall maintenance *incredibly* simple.
"
"2. Adam's kit gives you enough do coat 2 cars; if you have the patience, I'd recommend double-coating your car just to make sure you don't have any thin spots (the UV light will help make sure you didn't miss any spots)
"
"3. On the windows side of things, I got ceramic window tint (3M).  It was very expensive; I'm on the fence about it.  I didn't go dark; I went for heat & glare reduction.  I have a black leather interior & it gets VERY hot in the summer sitting outside; the ceramic took the edge off the heat.  Still hot, but not over-the-top hot.  The glare reduction helps, as I'm in traffic up to 2 hours a day (pre-COVID, at least!).  I can't say it's like, super amazing or anything, but it is nice.  Would have been nicer for 1/4 of what I paid to have it installed.
"
"4. The Glassparency ceramic window coating did a good job, but seems to have worn down over time.  My buddy's Rain-X has to be re-applied every so often, but it's an easy wipe-on wipe-off job, and the results appear to be equal to Glassparency.  The first year I had the Glassparency on, it did do fantastic in the winter with all of the crud that would get on my windows while driving.  Also, Rain-X has anti-fogging spray for inside the windows, if you run into that issue where you love.  You can also upgrade your wipers to PIAA silicone blades for extra brownie points if you want to get really serious about your windows.  I also have a secret homemade glass-cleaning formula (for inside & out) if you want it, as Windex sure ain't streak-free!  Magic formula + paper towels = super-clear windows!
"
"5. I use a compact Swiffer duster inside the car for the dash & whatnot.  Works like magic!
"
"6. I have a Shark IONFlex 2X cordless vacuum cleaner for the house, which has attachments for vacuuming out your car (and is battery-powered!).
"
"7. I have a microfiber glove for hand-washing (Chemical Guys lime green microfiber wash mitt, $7 on Amazon).  The simple trick is to keep the hose running over it, otherwise it will pick up dirt & that dirt will act like sandpaper.  Pop the glove on, hold the hose over the top, and wipe the car down, while rinsing the glove off between wipes.  Easy peasy.  I use a microfiber towel to dry it up, to avoid water spots (Meguiar's X2020 Supreme Shine Microfiber Towels, 3-pack of yellow towels, $10 on Amazon).
"
"
"
"So my weekly car maintenance ritual is pretty simple:
"
"
"
"1. Hose off the outside & dry it off
"
"2. Spin-clean the rims
"
"3. Wash the windows
"
"4. Dust the inside
"
"5. Vacuum the inside
"
"
"
"Takes all of 15 minutes, once a week.  I'll never go back to non-ceramic lol.  Also - remember to let the ceramic cure for a couple weeks before washing it!  And congrats on the new whip!!""

"
"""We did drive the Model 3 a few months ago as our first Tesla introduction. That made it more comfortable testing the Model Y since we had already experienced some of the major differences before (regenerative braking, etc.)
"
"
"
"The Model Y things that stand out for me from the Model 3 are:
"
"
"
"* Seat height - we're in our 50's and it is much easier to get in and out.
"
"* View over the hood - seems better here but there's still that invisible last bit you can't see that will take getting use to to avoid things. The distance sensors on the screen, in inches, is a huge help in this area.
"
"* Rear seat comfort - higher seats, more leg room, reclining seats are all great improvements.
"
"* Rear storage - access to the area via the hatchback is an obvious advantage. The under floor storage is also really big and will be used to hide things from view like purses, laptop bags, etc. 
"
"* Cornering - obviously there's a big difference between the performance and AWD versions here. Both cornered more than flat enough for our use. On a racetrack I'm sure you'd notice the difference between the Model 3 more but on normal roads I didn't feel like there was any significant tilting or feeling like a roll was initiating. 
"
"* Ride comfort - you can really feel the difference between the Performance and the AWD here. Both seem comparable to the Model 3. The Performance version has a hypersensitive feel and every pavement wobble or defect is felt. The AWD version we drove was the 20"""" wheels and it was noticeably more comfortable but still firm. We're looking forward to the 19"""" wheels we ordered since comfort > handling for us and we want extra sidewall for bad roads around here. 
"
"* Fan noise - we did hear the fans going from the heat pump and it was about 80 degrees out. It's noticeable only because there's no other engine noise. It's audible but I wouldn't expect complete silence on a hot day.""
"
"""Yes, you need a mask to meet and get setup. Then they let you drive alone.""

"""No, still waiting on delivery notification. When they called I got super excited thinking it was the day, but having it be a test drive invitation was a nice consolation prize ;)""

Love our 3 and hopeful our son will buy it so we can keep it in the family...I’ll buy it back from him when his Cybertruck arrives in ~2023! Maybe I can reach a human tmrw for a Y AWD test drive. We’re awaiting our RWD Y.
"
"""Damn, its going to be hard to resist now. Thanks :)""
"
"So they are offering test drives for people who have ordered MY?
"
"""Since they asked me after the test drive if I have an order, I'd guess it's not exclusive to people who ordered.""

"1.	Driver side rear lights are definitely not aligned. Then I walked down the lot and looked at all the model y cars and they were all the same.   
"
"2.	there is a dent on the front windshield interior liner.  It’s obvious and bums me out a bit.

"""We were in the Tesla Factory parking lot, not in the Tesla Delivery Center. Basically the overflow location. There were a few people that looked like maybe security, or employees walking back to their car, or on a break, but nobody came close to the car or even paid much interest in us. Delivery Center may be different.
"
"
"
"I think you can reject it by leaving it there and have your partner drive you back home. You can look at the Tesla from the outside as long as you want. Then go to the web site and accept delivery, and then you can open the car from the app (seconds later). Look at the car from the inside as long as you want. It was hot on the lot. Drive it for an hour (I think there is a 100 miles limit). The car contains paperwork that you have to sign and Fedex (paid envelope) back in 24h. We took it home, and I inspected it in great detail in my own driveway. Another test drive to calibrate autopilot (takes about 20 miles) and then test a few of those features. I also spent half an hour checking every light at night (e.g. ambiance lights are hard to see during the day). I'll sign the paperwork tomorrow.

"What I dislike most about the car so far is the limited rear view from the driver seat. The small rear view mirror shows mostly car pillars and truck. FSD may make this a moot point, but that won't happen for a while. It doesn't help that the side mirrors are tiny, too.
