"> Power electronics is something that is really something quite core to Tesla. And something we see as a really strong competency of ours –most people don’t realize it but Tesla is one of the biggest manufacturers of power electronics in the world. If you look at all the charging equipment in the cars, the inverters that run the motors in the cars. Something we see a lot potential  – we see an interesting and lucrative opportunity if we can more aggressively innovate and integrate that with storage.
"
"
"
"
"
"Tesla uses AC induction motors for their cars.  The batteries are DC, so an inverter must be used to drive the motor.  Tesla is under pressure to use the most efficient inverter, because even a 1% efficiency gain increases the mileage of the car significantly.  Solar panels and batteries are becoming a big deal, and inverters are also used to connect them to AC power.
"
"
"
"Inverters have been around for a while, and there is room for improvement (or so I've read) and now with the rush for solar, batteries, and electric cars there is high demand for the best possible inverter.  [In 2016 Google gave away  a  $1,000,000 prize for inverter tech - Wired.com.](
"
"
"
"See also: [On building a Tesla Solar inverter/hub: ‘we are probably the best in the world on advanced inverter technologies’ – Elon Musk - Electrik.co](
"
"
"
"
"
"TLDR: Inverters are required for the new energy economy.  Our current inverter tech can be improved, possibly significantly.  Some smart people at Tesla have realized how integral inverters are and Tesla is making their own.  They will probably be very good, and maybe give Tesla a competitive advantage.  The competitive advantage: maybe all of their products are more efficient, that they save on the cost of this crucial component, that they control a key technology.""

"Vehicles are terrible investments in the first place. You don't buy a Model S to be fiscally responsible. It's a luxury item. And while Teslas depreciate at a much slower rate than typical ICE vehicles, they still depreciate significantly more than any other place you could sink that money. If OP spent $120k on a fully loaded S and decided to sell it, he would certainly lose money. Maybe he could get $100k back (for the sake of the argument.) Now he goes and drops $60k on a fully loaded Model 3. That puts $40k back in his pocket to invest and grow rather than depreciate. In this scenario, after five years he will have a depreciated Model 3 worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $35k, plus that $40k he invested in low risk mutual funds is now worth over $60k. That leaves him with just under $100k in assets from this transaction.
