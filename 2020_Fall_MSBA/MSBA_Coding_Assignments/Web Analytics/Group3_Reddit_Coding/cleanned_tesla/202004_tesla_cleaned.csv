"""Piped O2 in hospitals is supplied at 4 bar ( ~400kPa), so yes you could argue there is some ‘residual’ pressure which could be harnessed, and indeed typically ventilators often borrow some of that pressure to drive the ventilation bellows. However to do so results in the loss of pressurised oxygen (circa 5l/min on a GE anaesthetic machine). 
"
"
"
"As I previously stated oxygen supply is the most limited thing, both in terms of litres per day used and the flow rates at which it can be delivered. A good supply rate at modern medium sized hospital might be 10,000 litres/min, many would be less than this. A hospital in the middle of a COVID wave will have many patients on oxygen (flow rates varying between 1 and 15 litres/min) in addition to those on ventilators (depending on the model and configuration flow rates 0.5-10 litres/min). As you can see a hospital with just 100 COVID patients might be using 1000 litres/min to oxygenate their patients, if 20 are ventilated (ICU rates 20-25% in COVID) using oxygen as the driving gas for the ventilator would waste another 100 litres/min - a 10% increase. In the bad situations where a hospital has many more than 100 COIVD patients, a 10% difference in oxygen demand might be the difference between success and failure.
"
"
"
"The solution? Use pressurised air to drive your ventilators because it’s a lot easy to acquire, store and deliver than oxygen.

What they are doing is building fleet-data sourced speeds and objects in a 3D environment.  So, on the actual map they have a 2 D road, but the fleet dats is a rendered pointcloud, almost like an ultra low fidelity  video game environment, that shows how much higher or lower the road goes beyond 2D.  It also has speed data (what they are primarily adding and changing for light and recognition) so the neural net has baked-in """"clues"""" that most teslas slow down around X coordinate, so start looking for lights or signs.

"If I turned on fleet data a year ago, my car would slow down for every stoplight regardless of color - but I only have AP1 so it never had any recognition hardware.  Now that AP3 is looking for color, it can take that data as a hint be be more aware of reasons to slow down, and if it sees green light eventually overrride the slowdown.  I've had my car come to a complete stop at a few stop signs, for example, with this on - but it's totally unreliable which is probably why they weren't talking about it before.

Obviously anybody providing data doesn't want you just copying it over time as you scrape it to steal their data, so they'll have language in their contracts around that.  If they can't legally firewall the creation of their own data I could see how this might bar them from working with some newer 3rd party data sets.

"Their map data isn't terrible.  It is mainly the speed limits that are broken.  And that sort of makes sense.  They have GPS logging data on the cars themselves so if 300 cars all drive through an area that is marked as being dirt chances are there is a road there, and if nobody ever drives over a segment of road chances are there isn't really a road.  On the other hand nobody drives exactly the speed limit so at best they could flag an area as being marked as 35mph but everybody is driving 70 and that looks odd, but whether the limit is 55 vs 65 vs 50 would probably require capturing camera footage or something (which is something they could do - they could have a queue distributed to each car of GPS coords where they want photos saved and uploaded if they happen to drive by, and then look for which cars regularly go near each area of interest).""

"""Part of the standard involves authentication and authorization.  The most basic way to secure it is by ensuring that all sensors that feed into the ECU that will broadcast data have their raw data digitally signed by including TPMs (trusted platform modules) integrated into the sensor hardware in such a way that attempting to tamper with the sensor would destroy it, and then you couldn't just replace the sensor with an off the shelf module as the ECU would no longer accept the data. Similarly you would use TPMs to sign the data being broadcasted.  The signature could be checked against known root certificates, sort of like how TLS works.
"
"
"
"The reason one would use TPMs instead of just certificates and keys stored in flash is that TPMs are able to perform cryptographic activities in a way that doesn't divulge the keys, and they can be locked after programming so that even debuggers attached to it can't get the key, and they are also built in a tamper-resistant way, so that if a really determined person attempted to carefully etch or file away the surface of the package to expose the bare chip and connect traces inside to attempt to bypass security features and extract the key, they would almost certainly destroy the chip in the process.
"
"
"
"By pairing and locking the TPMs' secure segments at the factory this would provide good security.  If someone could still manage to crack the system, then you would additionally want to use crowdsourced verification/trust.  Basically, that means that if the receiving vehicles around the """"hacked"""" car compare the data it's broadcasting to what the the recieiver is measuring about the source vehicle (e.g., consider a car transmitting its speed: if I'm behind it and have front radar, I can calculate its speed independently and compare.  I could do the same with acceleration) and the values differ significantly, the receiver could upload or broadcast a  """"don't trust this transmitter"""" signal and if enough vehicles agree the data could be ignored. This method is also useful for when sensors malfunction in a way that the car doesn't notice, although there should be redundant sensors to overcome this issue in those cases ĺe.g., if I have three MEMS accelerometers I can compare the output and if two out of three agree but the third doesn't, then that's a good indication that the third sensor is bad).
"
"
"
"If you've ever used Waze, you can see how crowdsourcing works in real-time as well.  If someone who has reported multiple verified things in the past, like speed traps or an accident, that broadcaster is given more weight.  On the other hand, many cops try to trick the system by reporting speed traps where there aren't any.  If many other people pass the area where it's been reported and tell Waze that there is no speed trap, then future reports from that original reporter (the cop) are given less weight and require additional verification before showing up.""

"
"Yep loose ends just tucked inside. Wood was fully secured :)
"
"""Yeah, but how OP wrapped it around the load itself is wrong.

"
"
"If the load shifts it can cause the cross-section to be smaller causing the tension to reduce, losing friction.
"
"
"
"Nothing in this prevents the load from shifting to the sides.
"
"
"
"I was not entirely correct in saying you should never do friction loading.  Semi-trucks do it.  But they use high tension straps and you strap to the bed with several tons of pressure.
"
"
"
"Never ever do friction securing by wrapping the straps under the load itself.
"
"
"
"As mentioned you're basically applying friction by cross-sectional area and if that cross-sectional area changes suddenly the tension changes.  On a semi-truck you tie it to the bed so the cross-sectional area can never change.
"
"
"
"edit: To illustrate here's a picture of the problem part.
"
"
"
"
"
"
"
"Those two top boards are mis-aligned if they shift to the right the cross-sectional area is reduced and all the tension disappears.  That's why friction loading is dangerous.

"If you were in an aeroplane, you could fly a ballistic trajectory to achieve zero g in the cockpit. Under this circumstance, the string would become loose, indicating that the acceleration vector was undefined.

"When I was a teenager learning to fly, one of the things I used to do in boring non-aerobatic aeroplanes was the map catching game, in which the map was placed on the dashboard, and the objective was pull up into a fairly steep climb, bunt to zero g and catch it in one's mouth before the dive angle became excessive. Perhaps not the best thing for the engine oil system, but the duration was pretty short & the instructor didn't seem to care.
"
"
"
"Of course, the other thing which you can do is a barrel roll, in which positive g is maintained all the way round. This is pretty easy if the aeroplane is properly trimmed and can be performed [in almost any aeroplane](. If you look below the cup holder, you will see a ball on a string.

The problem is for a given weight of car, once the vehicle has enough power that it is power limited, the coefficient of friction between the tires and the road becomes the limiting factor.

"> An order of magnitude is an approximation of the logarithm of a value relative to some contextually understood reference value, usually ten, interpreted as the base of the logarithm ...  When the reference value is ten, the order of magnitude can be understood as the number of digits in the base-10 representation of the value. ... Differences in order of magnitude can be measured on a base-10 logarithmic scale in “decades” (i.e., factors of ten).
"
"
"
"Firstly let's differentiate between, using the common base10 scale, the """"number resulting from an order of magnitude x""""; and """"the order of magnitude x"""" simpliciter.
"
"
"
"One area for confusion is that sometimes """"order of magnitude"""" equivocates between the first and second reference. Knowing which is the referent is a matter of context.
"
"
"
"We have, using the common base 10 scale, the following order of magnitude tiers:
"
"
"
"* 10^1 =10. Here the """"order of magnitude"""" is """"one"""" ( log10(10) ); and the number resulting from this order of magnitude is """"ten""""
"
"* 10^2 =100.  Here the """"order of magnitude"""" is """"two""""  ( log10(100) ); and the number resulting from this order of magnitude is """"one hundred""""
"
"* ...
"
"* 10^4 =10,000.  Here the """"order of magnitude"""" is """"four"""" ( log10(10,000) ); and the number resulting from this order of magnitude is """"ten thousand""""

"* 10^5 =100,000.  Here the """"order of magnitude"""" is """"five"""" ( log10(100,000) ) ; and the number resulting from this order of magnitude is """"one hundred thousand"""".

"If car has a price in the 10s of thousands its price is a number, on the common base10 scale, resulting from four orders of magnitude. If you increase the car's price by an order of magnitude to you push it into the next order of magnitude tier, having five orders of magnitude. That is, into the 100s of thousands.
"

"
"E.g. A $42,000 car with an order of magnitude increase becomes $420,000. That is,

"There’s 3 sources of noises in a car: engine/motor noise, wind noise, and road noise.
"
"
"
"During acceleration, the motors of a EV will produce a small high pitched noise. You can only really hear this on perfect pavement, because most times the road noise will cancel this noise out.
"
"
"
"A ICE car will have engine noise. When cruising on a freeway, road noise will again cancel this out. But when accelerating, you can hear a lot of this. Mercedes luxury cars might try to mute this noise as much as possible, but Porsche engines are hilariously loud, but that’s the point. Porsche engines are very very loud when accelerating This is undeniable.
"
"
"
"Model 3 is meant to be a cheap mass produced car, but the battery and motor tech is very expensive. And to get the performance it gets, efficiency is kind of thrown out the window. If the model 3 used weaker motors it would get more range, like a Kia or a Hyundai. But performance is a big factor in a Tesla, so other weight savings need to be made. This weight savings comes from using thin single pane and thinner metal panels.
"
"
"
"Wind noise is a hit or miss, as model 3 can have better wind noise isolation if sealed properly, but that isn’t always the case. This is more of a manufacturing issue than design flaw. Having more seals allows more acceptable points of failure.
"
"
"
"But where the model 3 fails at is road noise. German cars use 3 elements to block out outside noise and road noise, thicker dual pane glass, thicker metal panels on the door, and heavy sound deafening materials. Unfortunately the model 3 has none of that.
"
"
"
"Being on the autobahn will create a shit ton of road noise in any car, this is not Tesla specific. The difference is that a luxury car is built to block this out as much as it can within its price class. Model 3 was not designed with this in mind, so all of that insane road noise makes it into the cabin. It’s so loud that the mic has to turn down the gain to make sure it doesn’t blow itself out, you can tell this is the case because you can hear the Porsche accelerating, but what’s supposed to be a loud loud engine noise comes out muffled. Yet you can still hear very loud muffled road noise in the model 3 cam, this means the road noise of the model 3 is far louder than what the Porsche engine can produce.""

"
"
"Tow weight rating has **a lot** to do with drive stability.  It's not just about what the vehicle can physically pull, it's what it can pull safely.
"
"
"
"* Vehicles with larger physical size have a greater wheelbase and therefore more stable driving at high speeds.
"
"* ICE vehicles can often get away with a shorter wheelbase due to the fact that the engine is in the front, counterbalancing the trailer weight at the rear. (Subaru Ascent can tow 5,000lb, but has identical wheelbase as the Y and is about the same weight.)
"
"* Additionally, to pull more than 5,000lb you need significantly more stopping power which means bigger brakes, bigger tires, and a center of gravity in line with the towed load.  
"
"
"
"So ultimately, the Model Y is dimensionally not a very large vehicle and the battery's center of gravity doesn't help....  which means it's actual geometry is likely not suited for pulling heavier loads safely down the highway.    Is this really that surprising as the Model X can only tow 5,000lb?

The GVWR for the Model Y is the total weight allowed on both axles. That number is 5302 pounds. The Model Y weighs 4416 pounds itself, so you only have 886 pounds of headroom. Best practice while towing is to have around 10% of your trailer weight on the hitch, otherwise your trailer and car may become unstable while driving. 10% of 3500 lbs is 350 lbs, so now you only have 536 pounds for payload in the Model Y before you exceed the GVWR.

"Isopropyl alcohol

"A credit card or plastic card. Preferably a piece of plastic with rounded edges.
"
"Hair dryer or heat gun(heat gun might be too hot)
"
"
"
"
"
"Clean surface with alcohol
"
"Once dried cut a rough piece of vinyl bigger than surface
"
"Apply vinyl starting with one edge and slowly working to the other edge with your fingers at first. Try to avoid bubbles and don't be afraid to peel it back up if need be. Do not over stretch the material as it will cause it to peel. 
"
"
"
"Once the piece is layed down, go over it with the credit card/piece of plastic. This will make sure the vinyl is well applied. 
"
"Now you should have vinyl hanging over the edges. 
"
"
"
"Use your knife/exacto to cut away excess material. Try cut away a little at a time. Take your time during this step.
"
"
"
" If you want to wrap more than the surface, you'll need the hair dryer to wrap around edges. Hair dryer will soften the material allowing you to wrap the edges easily. Do not keep the hairdryer on the material too long as it might melt and ruin the wrap. 
"
"
"
"If little imperfections such as folds or little bumps appear on the surface, just peel back and apply a little heat and start over. Most vinyls will go back to the original shape when you apply a bit of heat.

"
"""This is actually my first wrap with a roll. Using an already cut piece doesn't leave much room for error. It would really suck to be off by a tiny bit and have to remove and reapply. I used a dbrand cut out for my laptop and it did go well. I had to reapply twice almost ruining the wrap.

Don’t take my word on the research I did, since it’s not scientifically tested. The wheels are lighter than the oem 19’s, but are wider. I’m running 245s all around as opposed to the stocks at 235. In terms of height, that according to the spring manufacturer’s site, it does have a slight improvement? I purchased the acceleration boost upgrade so my range isn’t as efficient as it’s supposed to be. 😅""

If you want optimum quality, coil overs are the way to go, but for me I don’t track or anything and my commute is 5-10 minutes to work so I don’t see it justify to spend $2500 for some. To be honest, the only thing I worry about is/are dips and big speed bumps, especially with a full ride with passengers. I did to do an alignment and the the guy that did it said he was able to align it properly without sacrificing any uneven tire wear, meaning no negative camber, which I noticed. My Michelin’s have worn out just right and have been lasting. Hope this info helps.""

"
"""Yes, in Feb. this year I bought a 2016 Model X directly from Tesla on their website. I had to pay in full before I could see it in person. I had the cat on my phone 5 min after I saw it and checked everything. It was as like new. After a short introduction I drove off the Tesla compound and I’m happy since. Everything worked as it should. 
"
"When I compare the price I paid with other Model X on the market, I think I got it cheaper then at a used car dealer. Tesla reduces the price every 3 or 4 days and I waited until it seemed to be cheaper than comparable offers. The benefit of buying used from Tesla is that they know the car (don’t tell you something the car doesn’t have, it has all updates and they don’t push you to buy. Perfect buying experience. 
"
"What else do you want to know?""
"
"""I tried.  They offered me $10000 less than what I owed on my model 3.  Tried to get them to come down $10000 on the price of the model x but they wouldn’t.  
"
"In the end I got my deposit back, which took way too long and cancelled the deal.
"
"It seems so sketchy anyways, Pay $85000 for a car that you can’t drive or nothing before you sign away $1000/month payments for the next 8 years.
"
"I am going to wait and get a model y this fall.
"
"They won’t be here in Canada until then.  That is, if Fremont starts building cars again""
"
"I bought a 2018 model x and yeah it was worth it
"
"I re leased a Tesla Model X from Swapalease a year ago. Not a days problem. Best car ever. Would highly recommend.
"
"I bought one but not from Tesla. What do you want to know?
"
"I bought a 2016MX P90DL used from tesla last year. What’s your questions?
"
"I placed my order last week. Waiting for it to be shipped across the country.
"
"Just spoke with Tesla sales. There will be a large number of used Model Xs hitting the site over the next month since production at the CA plant starts back up this week. Thinking the prices may go down as well due to the increase. Any thoughts or insight would be much appreciated.
"
"My used model X will arrive in Atlanta from California (bought from Tesla) on Friday! Super excited.
"
"How much mileage was it? How’s your experience so far with it?
"
"""How do you know what options and features comes with the model X? If I want to ensure that it has HW2.0 vs 2.5, free supercharging for life etc? Thank you! My wife an I are about 3m away from purchase date.""
"
"How long did it take to arrive from order to pick up
"
"""Went to pick up the car from Tesla, the sales rep was bad, seemed bothered to answer questions, left to go around and put temp tags on other cars, etc.  Bad mouthed the model X, all while we were signing.  About to leave with the car, and charging threw an error.  The sales guy said it was normal....we said no it is not, another guy came over, and he was helpful. They took it to service and the charge port was bad.  So instead of getting the car on Thursday, we got it on Saturday.  After getting the car and the car on the Tesla app, I got a notification that AP3.0 was available for a complimentary upgrade and how to submit a service request.  Was able to schedule the work at my home with the mobile unit, only to have it canceled and rescheduled at a service center an hour away.  Two parts were ordered, but one was on back order.
"
"
"
"Saturday was great, different sales guy, and completely different experience.  On Tesla's website it said we had full self driving capability, but we actually have full self driving.  Also, a bonus was bio hazard mode.  Didn't think we had that, no mention on the website.  Car was built in 11/2016.  It has MCU1 and after this week, AP3.0.  
"
"
"
"Car had 25,000 miles.  It did have a front fender scrape that couldn't been seen in the photos.  Decided it was ok since the car was otherwise in incredible shape.  The first and only owner took good care of it.  
"
"
"
"One week in, we traveled out of state with it.  In short, on the way home, had trouble with the driver seat belt (the car didn't realize it was hooked, and wouldnt allow autopilot to work). The front safety system failed as well.  Also the driver window would not roll up.  The trio of uh oh.  Got the window up finally, it was 100 degrees outside.  Couldn't drive with autopilot for four hours, but we got home.  
"
"
"
"Scheduled service within the app, and took it in at 9am on Monday.  
"
"
"
"Was there all day, thinking it was going to be a couple hours, ultimately went home at 5pm in a loaner.  In short, new window motor was replaced, new seat belt, and new driver seat was installed.  The sensor that tells the car someone is in the driver seat had failed, and the techs tried to fix it, but wound up replacing with a completely new seat.  As the only visible sign of wear in the car was a small place on the driver seat, this was an ok outcome.  
"
"
"
"Picked up the car on Thursday, everything was fixed and working, also, they had received the parts for AP3.0 and the retrofit kit while waiting for the new seat to arrive, so picked up the car with new autopilot.  
"
"
"
"AP3.0 definitely made AP work more smooth, as we were going back and forth within the lane with AP1.  
"
"
"
"Few early thoughts on the experience, other looking for three months, coast to coast for a specific car type....
"
"
"
"Wanted an X with Ludicrous or Insane+.  Wanted black with white seats.  Wanted low miles.  Wanted FSD ability, didn't have to have it installed. Wanted premium audio.  Wanted 22 inch rims.   Called auto dealers from Chicago down to Miami and every city in between.  
"
"
"
"If you buy a used Tesla, ensure you get one manufactured in November 2016 or later.  They can be upgraded to AP3.0.  
"
"
"
"Non-tesla dealers have zero idea what is in the car.  We had to do facetimes with them and go screen by screen. Also the sticker on the inside driver door will tell you the manufacturing date. It will show as MM/YY. This was a key and MASSIVE key piece of info.  
"
"
"
"Lots happened in the first two weeks.  Would buy the car again.  It is pretty incredible.  Wife loves it, kids love it.  Drives like a charm and the acceleration is unreal, not in the level of a model S going 2.4 seconds, but the X at 3.4 seconds is incredible at 5,000 pounds.  
"
"
"
"Very glad we bought from Tesla.  Thought they were a few thousand higher than most, but the warranty extension will more than pay for it. Also, the service crew has been incredible.  It is cool to see the car being worked on on the app, even seeing which doors are open.  
"
"
"
"One last thing, we had to have the car shipped from California to Atlanta.  During the time period, we would get random texts from Tesla that it had shipped, then a random pickup day, then it was confirmed after the destination place received it.  Would have loved to have some sort of tracking like a package.  Took 2-3 weeks from order.  Handed them a cashier's check after inspection, they were fine with that.  That was weird having to inspect the car that we had only seen online.   
"
"
"
"In summary, with all the good and bad, zero buyer's remorse, glad to be part of the Tesla family.  Think it will be first of many. 
"
"
"
"Thinking about buying the cyber truck now. Will put $100 down soon.""
"
"""It had 44t mi and only some very little chips on the frunk. Otherwise clean and like new. The car was on my phone immediately. Everything works as it should. Have free supercharging and I’m very satisfied with the car. In the first month I drove more than 3t mi and had (still have) so much fun with that car. My wife is happy with it as well because I run her errands. I would not buy a used Tesla from a non-Tesla-dealer because they don’t know the car and will tell you anything, you’re not getting free Supercharger and it takes a long time until the Tesla is sync with your phone.""
"
"""I actually had a to take a bit of a risk on some of that. In theory you can call Tesla and they should tell you though sometimes they are not very helpful. Luckily mine did turn out to have free unlimited supercharging but no one can still tell me if fsd was paid for over a year later...
"
"
"
"My screen always says 'no recent supercharging' in the charging menu where other cars without free supercharging should have the cost of their last supercharging trip. HW 2.5 is just a date threshold I think, but I'm not sure what date.""

"""Does your Model X have AP 1.0 or 2.0? Have you used autopilot on it, if so how is it?""

"Thank you!

"I think it’s 2.0 and I’ll upgrade it ASAP. I use Autopilot 80% of the time. Safest driving and so relaxing.

"
"1) Have your falcon wing doors been reliable? (Since you have an late 2016 model)

"2) Is it possible to upgrade to from HW2.0 to 3.0? (I thought it was only 2.5 to 3.0 that was possible. 
"
"
"
"I plan to upgrade the MCU1 to MCU2 when I purchase my Model X.""
"
"""No problem. 1 answer: I don’t know the answers. 
"
"2. Since I have the MX I never had problems with the Falcons. But that’s one reason why I didn’t want a new MX. I read that the MXs have problems with it and I thought that the first owner had it fixed. And not only with the doors but with other problems as well. So far I’m well off. Everything works perfectly fine. 
"
"3. What I read was that it is possible to upgrade from 2 to ? at the cost of around $2,500. I’ll do that as soon as I’ll get the email from Tesla, that I am eligible for it and what I read is that I can expect the email end of April.

"In my opinion, the steering wheel and seat adjustments are the most generous of any big car I’ve driven so far.

"""Shit. They delivered my model Y on 3/31 with no hub caps. The guy told me they were in the mail and I’ve just been thinking it’s been a pretty long while with no hub caps.  He didn’t give me any documentation for that, and I trusted him. Am I screwed?""
"
"""You can’t really trust anyone at Tesla who interacts with customers to know what they are talking about. When I ordered my car, I configured it with FSD and 19” wheels. I then switched to 20” induction wheels after my loan was approved and was told that I’d need to apply for a new loan in 48 hours which I understood and was no problem with me. Instead, I get a call the next day for delivery using my original terms but higher down payment. Delivery was either the next day (Sunday) or nothing. Since I needed a few days to come up with the extra cash I asked them if I dropped FSD from the order, could I upgrade to it after delivery for the $6000 pre-order price instead of the new price of $7000 and they said I could. Delivery happened Sunday after a 4 hour delay and two different vins being assigned. That night I checked the app for FSD upgrade and it was, surprise surprise, $7000. So I called the next day, Monday, and the person I spoke to said I would have to pay the current higher price despite what I was told before.

"I’d like to think that the people I’ve talked to are just poorly trained and that Tesla doesn’t have a culture of making false promises but I have my doubts.

"And they changed their policy so that you can't get the buy the same trim level for some amount of time maybe a year after a return.

"""As with all legal contracts, I wonder if doing so prior to signing is best though...""

"Don't be crazy. A $60k or $1mn car or $20k will all have some imperfections. Ignore the minor ones. Really. Who gives a shit.

"""I really like to think Tesla is not so sinister (for lack of a better word, it's early and I'm tired at work). But if I could do things a little different the next time. I'd inspect the vehicle prior to delivery/signing papers, and any major issues I see I would say I'm not signing any paperwork/taking delivery until the items are adjusted/repaired.
"
"
