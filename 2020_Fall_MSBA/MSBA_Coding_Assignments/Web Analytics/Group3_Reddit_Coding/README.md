In this folder you can see a complete coding analysis along with all the output files.

This part of the project completed by myself independently. I performed reddit comments crawling, utilized local postgres database for file management, applied vader sentiment analysis package to get the polarity scores, then used seaborn + matplotlib to create linear barplot and used wordcloud package to create a wordcloud.

Our group project includes other parts of the analysis which done by other group members, the other parts include: twitter crawling&analysis, google trend data analysis, linear regression model and business model analysis. If you are interested to learn more about the whole group project, please see the youtube video for our final presentation recording:
