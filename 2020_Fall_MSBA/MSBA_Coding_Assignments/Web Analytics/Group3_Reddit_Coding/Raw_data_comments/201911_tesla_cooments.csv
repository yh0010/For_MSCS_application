Happy cybertruck turkey
"We had a few people who tried to post this before, apologies for flip flopping. Cheers and happy t-giving."
Turkatron!
elon musk's jaw and that turkey look like they come from minecraft
Genetically engineered for the harsh environment of Mars.
What great PS skills! Very decent work!
spachcock is the most efficient way to cook a turkey. Makes sense that’s what Tesla does.
I like how this meme implies cars have a natural shape
Low poly turkey
Looks like an asset from the original half life
Elon liked this.
So I have to cut the areas near the window to get inside?
The bed has to be full of stuffing 😂

Happy Thanksgiving
Yes!
That looks like something from a TFC or CS1.6 map
That isn't a turkey! That's a piece of toast!
I for one welcome the coming of our cyber turkey overlords
It's weird I haven't seen any comparisons to Star Fox yet.
Template?
Isn't the top one his pot smoking face?

That's funny
Does that mean regular cars are shaped like turkey?
Are there any pics of the Tesla Turkey when it was still alive?
This is the best thing I have ever seen
you win the internets for today!
I’d eat a Tesla turkey zero to poop in 1.9second with no emissions.
I'm weak.
You clever gurl.🦖

This is exactly how I was feeling.
He is one of the ugliest men alive.
"Yup, the skin can get roasted brown and crispy over its whole surface and there are no underdone bits in the bird because the heat couldnt reach some part from the inside."
"No, just pelt some steel bearings at it."
I’d say the sea of brake lights.
"It's not a whistleblower when you are just sharing private company info, not sharing something illegal, with the press. He was trying to say Tesla wasn't being efficient, which like it or not, he's not allowed to share.

Piling on stuff like, he smoked a joint on Joe Rogan, and trying to act like that is awful, is stupid. The tweet about 420 he paid a 20 million dollar fine for. He's not a perfect person by any means but this article is a hit piece."
We saw this when the allegations were first made. Let the courts sort it out as they are privy to much more information than we are. No need to bring up old shit that didn't go anywhere.
The fact that you edited your comment with a number of downvotes pretty much confirms you're not here to discuss anything but rather here to troll.
"Lol, his lawyer dropped him. That should let you know how legit he is. He’s not a whistle blower. He is pissed he got rightfully fired. I guess you don’t keep up to date, you just read one headline and run with it."
thanks!
Skin is the best part anyway.

"You got me, I'm using Top Gears five roll minimum speed to slow down the Tesla Turkey."
Let the record show this man left his date at the Tesla CyberTruck afterparty like 20 minutes after it started!
We clearly haven't met
Him smoking a joint on Joe Rogan for shock effect and to feign being down-to-earth *is* awful.  His preferred drug of choice is speed.
"I like how this comment just completely ignores the worst allegation in the article. And I'm not sure where you got the idea that whisteblowing is only whisteblowing when it exposes something illegal. 

And the point of bringing up the Rogan stuff wasn't to say that being on the show and smoking a joint itself as bad- it's pointing out how PR moves like that cause people to view his actions differently. Like you. If bezos did this shit itd be front page immediately. But Because elon's PR team has him participating in memes, reddit loves him. It's really that easy. 

Overall, poor comment my friend. I hope you'll do better on the next one."
His lawyer dropped him. He’s a joke of a guy that got pissed he got fired.
"How ridiculous.  “Let the courts sort it out.”  No, I can pretty easily see that OJ killed that Brown woman."
"Didn't go anywhere? They fucking falsely accused him of planning a mass shooting. Tracked employee's private comms. There's more than enough info from this article alone to know tesla is up to no good. If you cant see it it's because you don't want to and that makes me kinda sad ngl.

You really don't need to wait years for a court ruling to see this is obviously fucked up. The info is right there man. Literally right in front of your face."
"I read the whole article. You apparently didn't. You read one reddit comment saying this was debunked and that was good enough for you. God, fanboys of billionaires are insufferable. 

The court proceedings are ongoing. And the article proves that someone accused this guy of threatening to shoot up Tesla. Weird that that would happen after he blew the whistle huh? Ah well, none of that must have happened since his lawyer dropped him. Fucking idiot. This Thanksgiving, I hope elon was thankful for bootlickers like you."
I’m just eating the skin so the turkeys up for grabs.
[removed]
You weren’t putting out.
Is there an inside joke here?
Is there an inside joke here?
You both have clearly not met me either.
How do you know it was for shock effect? I'm not sure his motivation but he lives in a legal state.
"> And I'm not sure where you got the idea that whisteblowing is only whisteblowing when it exposes something illegal.

Whistleblowing is for illegal activities. I cant just share any internal company secreta and cl it whistleblowing are you joking? I cant just give out super out of context information in an attempt to damage the stock price if I am under NDA to not do so. If the company is doing something illegal you have rights around it."
Sounds good.
"When your lawyer drops you, that’s speaks volumes. Also if it’s an ongoing case, why the hell are you tell us we’re bootlickers, but you’re just a white knight? You can’t have it both ways. If you’re saying it’s an on going case, then you shouldn’t have an opinion, if you’re going to have an opinion, base it on facts like the lawyer dropping their client as a good indicator of how serious his grievance is. But this wouldn’t fit your bullshit narrative. You make all the negative assumptions, and ignore the facts at hand, and call everyone else boot lockers. This thanksgiving I’m thankful I have critical thinking skills.

P.S. you should update your downvote and refutations count. It’s way out of date. Also your username fits your narrative here."
TWO pizzas!!!
u/kushari said you and him are still exclusive together

"Oo, a self burn. Those are rare."
"You could have just googled the fucking definition of whistleblower. Instead you just decided decided to argue.

A whistleblower (also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower)[1] is a person who exposes secretive information or activity that is deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct within a private or public organization

You're an idiot. Reflect for a minute. Why  would you be so confident in your intelligence that you wouldn't even bother to spend the 1 minute needed to actually look up the definition? Ignorance."
"Sometimes, the truth is totally different than someone's persona. Sometimes it's someone you really admire. Doesn't make it less true."
We decided to make our relationship poly.
He’s just jelly
Exsqueeze me! I was there too!
still f!@#$ clueless
You literally just proved his point. You should take a minute and read the definition that you posted lol. Exposes activity that is deemed illegal.
"Wait, how was what he was exposing unethical? From what I had read it was that Tesla wasn't making efficient use of resources, not that it was unethical use of resources."
This chain made me happier than it should.
"Should have made it polygonal, like the truck! :D"
That's his jam.
">illegal, unethical, or not correct

Dude are you illiterate? Like seriously. You can whistleblow unethical behavior too. According to the definition you said I didn't read. You may be one of the most ignorant people I've argued with on this app, and I do a lot of arguing here."
"No, I think you are. Doesn’t matter, you can’t take your ex employer to court for something that isn’t illegal. Lol, you’re really trying hard. So even if it’s unethical, it’s doesn’t mean illegal. They are in court, so it’s on the assumption they committed something illegal."
Lol nice backpedal after missing the mark trying to call out my definition
"That’s not a backpedal, you’re just not very bright. I see you have an agenda, and won’t stop pushing it, so I’ll just block you. But normal people will read and figure your intelligence level right away."
"And what will they think of the intelligence level of the guy who tried to call someone out for a definition that was literally right in front of their face, then dropped the point entirely when called out?"
That thing is definitely not fitting in my garage
"This is not going to fit in my garage.

Good thing it's hail proof."
Do one with F150 and X please!
Are we sure? That thing is huge
"Excluding the custom ordered $35,000 model 3 these have the same starting price. I didn’t like the Cybertruck initially and now I love it. It’s designed for maximum utility at the cheapest price which is why it looks so different. It’s super cheap to produce and the fact they can make a practically bulletproof truck with a longer range and cheaper than a model s is amazing."
I wonder if it's going to be an issue sharing superchargers with it
Model X please.
"My garage is gonna fit inside the Cybertruck, not the other way around"
"Man, I'd love a cybertruck, but don't really need a truck, and that HUGE size would make it a pain in a lot of places, especially with parking and such.  This is the first time in my life I've actually kind of wanted a truck though."
The more I look at it the more I need it
"I paid more for my mid-range Model 3 this year than the base model CT that's coming out 2 years from now.  Holy hell, Tesla is going HAM.  (Still love my Model 3, and I'm never giving it up.)"
Never have i wanted to own a vehicle more than the cyber truck.
Shit. At least I have three years to find a new place to live.
"Holy shit, I’m actually kinda sad after seeing this. There’s no way this thing is practical on UK roads."
"Holy shit, it's huge. My wife is definitely in for a shocker."

The lack of a paint job. No need to worry in regards to clear coat or paint oxidation.
Looks like another car who's low beams will completely blind sedan drivers.
ITT: people who have apparently never seen a full-size pickup truck.
This won’t even fit in my driveway
"hahah OMFG! When I first saw the Cybertruck, my first thought was ""I think they need larger tires, so it looks nice, like 22's"" LOL! Little did I know the actual size of the tires is over 30."
I laugh at people who think they’ll have fun daily driving and parking that thing in a city
Gonna need to buy a new house
Jesus that is huge

Appears that with the lift gate down it will easily handle 4x8 sheets of drywall or wood
Only matters vs trucks. F150 IS THE BENCHMARK
"I hated it so much. And now it is growing on me. WTf? Like a DeLorean knocked up a Pontiac Aztec. But kinda awesome. He doesn't even care about these on Earth. These are going to Mars, aren't they?"
You won’t be able to park this anywhere in Europe basically...
"Pretty much my only issue. If there was a smaller option, I'd totally preorder. 4 seater, not as wide, shorter vault.  Weekend warrior family version please Elon!"
I will make it fit in my garage.
You are the best! This is the shot I needed to let me know it was the right purchase.
Yes! This is exactly what I’ve been looking for!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
It's the same size as an F150
Why are people surprised a truck is big...
Need banana for scale.
Feel like auto park is gonna have to be standard on all models
"Is this a guess or are there measurements floating around somewhere that I'm not aware of? Looks off to me.

Edit, after rewatching the F150 pull video: shit, maybe it is that huge. Still would like to know the actual length though"
Comparison with a humvee please?
Someone please mock up a model 3 in Cybertruck style K thanks
"It would be neat to see the Cyber length compared to other trucks. Tesla is a foot shorter than a Supercrew with a 6.5 bed. 


Cybertruck length: 231.7

Ford F150 Super crew, 6.5 feet bed: 243.7

Ford F150 Super crew, 5.5 feet bed: 231.9 

Ford F150 Regular cab, 6.5 feet bed: 209.3"
Watch it not even fit in standard parking spots 😶
"For $40,000 it's fucking tempting"
"They need an urban/European version.
 Cut out the entire back seat (non crew cab  version): Bang  a whole new market.

 Many People in Europe and urban areas often don't have families anyway or they can fit their one child up front.

And another version with an 8-foot bed for the contractors."
I still can’t get over how surreal it will be to see this thing on the street in the real world.
That’s no moon.
"I wonder if it will take standard gooseneck, 5th wheel and others due to up slope angle?"
"Ah, so it's idiotically massive, then."
I will get it only if I can get it charged at work. My garage is just right for my Model 3. The Cybertruck would have to park outside. I'm not spending another $20k or whatever a bigger garage would be just to house it.
That thing is so big I just cancelled my order. Sucks I really like it but damn that's way too big
I'm gonna build my house on the cybertruck
It’s a tank. It doesn’t need a garage
I would consider Cybertruck *if* it would be smaller. F-150 is also too big for me.
"These seem much more like fleet trucks, like a company is going to buy a bunch of them for their business than people are going to buy then for daily drivers"
"Thinking a crew cab short box F150 compared a BMW 3 series. I think Musk should offer smaller Cypertruck in future to eat Tacoma, Ranger, and Colorado/Canyon market or offer a 2-door double cap Cypertruck."
I hated the look at first but now it's really starting to grow on me.
Sure looks like there should be room for something in front of the driver like a frunk.  Wonder what they're doing with that space.
"Late to the party, but I didn't notice it mentioned... Here's Truckla being eclipsed by the Cybertruck: https://twitter.com/SimoneGiertz/status/1197782075807420417"
Me vs the guy she told you not to worry about.
They're gonna need a bigger tent.
"Idk why there are so many jokes, I really love the design!"
OK....now I want one
[Me when I try to back my new Cybertruck into my garage](https://youtu.be/x3LwHhDD6TY)
Good job making this 😋🙏👍♥️
ITT people with tiny garages. It isnt any bigger than an f-150 /expedition and my expedition fits in my small garage with room to walk behind it with the garage door closed.
I **need** a cyber truck
Thanks mods for keeping this post up. It's almost the only way the Reddit front page gets to hear about Tesla!
No such thing as not enough room in the garage.  Just drive it in until the garage door shuts.  The truck won't be damaged.  It will make all the room it needs on it's own.
People around here obviously were not familiar with trucks if they think this is huge.  This truck is almost exactly the same size as a GMC 2500 HD double cab (smaller back seat option).  The Cybertruck actually about 1.3 inches more narrow and 4 inches shorter than the GMC truck.  It's definitely not a big truck by today's standard.  Gotta chill with comparing it to smaller mid sized sedans and saying it looks like Godzilla.
I think europe would love a cyberturck about 80% the size of this
lol gonna need a bigger garage... haha
How do you park this thing at the supermarket?
"Calling MAJOR BS on this, unless Elon is 8' tall. I'm about 6' and my shoulders are just above the roof of my 3,

Added Elon from the presentation for scale. This composite it's clear the original is not to scale. The Cybertruck in the composite also isn't exactly same as the one presented and Elon is basically a couple feet from the CT. While the height of the truck in both is the same the length is different by a bit and both appear taken straight-on...

[https://imgur.com/a/PZG80TA](https://imgur.com/a/PZG80TA)"
That's a big truck actually
"Dang, it's actually pretty long."
Two door mini Cybertruck please!
😲
Christ. It's massive
Now do the S and X
"231.7 inches long, 79.8 inches wide and 75 inches tall with a 6.5-foot bed for those who are wondering."
Interesting from the side view. Plan and front view would be cool too
It looks like Delorean.
"I'm infatuated with the CyberTruck, but I've always hated huge cars. My Model 3 is the perfect size to navigate parking lots and other urban situations. CyberTruck (500 mile range!) would be an amazing highway cruiser though!"
I find this genuinely hard to believe
Holy shit i want it even more now
"One looks like a car, one looks like a LEGO futuristic set from the 1990’s."
"Personally, I think the thing is kinda hideous, but if they fire up the Tesla Mobility network with a bunch of these unmistakeable vehicles out on the road with the taller body that makes it easier for people to climb into, I think from a branding optics perspective, these things will end up being iconic. There's a reason why taxis are usually yellow. You want them to stand out, and if there's one thing this design does is stand out."
This is why I’m keeping my Model 3 for Most driving and will take the Cybertruck for road trips outside of cities and into nature. That thing won’t like the streets of European cities.
How do crumple zones work with this thing?  I want it badly.
Y'all see the video with the cyber truck pulling the Ford pickup?
I’m not sure who exactly is going to fit in the back seat of this thing. I’d be interested in seeing a 6’ person get in there and compare for headroom.
"I lived in the Canadian boonies. If it can handle the cold, this is a seriously attractive option ( 4x4 though )"
Thanks OP.  That seals it for me. I will not put a deposit.
I’m curious to see what happens when you drive it through a creek...
Holy mother of what the actual bloody f#£k...
 https://twitter.com/SimoneGiertz/status/1197782075807420417
Damn... I may not buy a cybertruck. But I m definitely not spending $45k for a base Model Y
"in Europe, if the car is over 3,5 ton, you have to have driver license for trucks. I wonder where this fits"
This truck is really starting to grow on me.
Haha oh shit
Can you add a bannana in for scale also?
My model 3 barely fits in my apartment parking spot 🤭🤭🤭 luckily in 3 years hoping to not live in the same place
So basically if it hits you head on you are cyberfucked
He wasn't kidding that it was a APC lmao
"good news is, now i can haul approximately 4.5 times the mulch / compost!"
I heard a lot of people worried about crumple zones. What does the cybertruck do to protect its passengers in the event of a collision instead?
"Absolute Unit! Yeah this is honestly a problem. My charger is built into the garage and I love being able to keep my car safe from the elements and comparatively warm. This is about 6"" longer than the length of my garage and that would mean keeping it outside and running the cord under the door. That... Kind of really sucks and this is a fairly large 2 car garage in the suburbs my guess is most garages won't be able to contain it. I think they made it too long by about a foot."
"Would be awsome if the model s, x and y where in the picture aswell"
I’ve never been so disappointed as I was when they revealed the truck
Wow but how does this compare to other comparable heavy duty trucks ? Comparing the truck to a compact car doesn’t seem fair
"So I feel like the death wagon could probably take out 2-3 normal cars if you get it up to speed. No crumble zones means twice the points.

I truly do not understand this monstrosity"
i still can't believe this is really happening?!?
"Looks like one of the ""trucks"" in the original Total Recall with Arnold"
Imagine driving this truck in the streets of San Francisco.
They should do a remake of Back to the Future where the time machine is built into a CyberTruck instead of a Delorian.
Wow. They are differnt vehicles
That makes a lot more sense. I’d get this if I weren’t so broke.
Cant believe that when seing [this picture](https://external-preview.redd.it/OigPyqdSptIT_j2pjat0i8MW3WX9NUOR9yeujkgruxo.jpg?auto=webp&s=11bcf8151f76aa052bc2185670f43db22bbd86fa)
Put it next to a f150

I'd like that car a lot more if it was just a little curved
"I feel like the designer on the truck was just crunched for time, drew some lines and was like ""it's abstract"""
"Can't wait to see first time truck owners figuring out the garage situation.

Generally not too bad to extend the garage a bit!

Do we know where the charging port is located? Back left side?"
Got a frontal/width comparison?
Holy Shit it's a fucking Tank
Who needs to buy a house when you can but a cyber truck
"I ordered 10 for my business (2 x 4) and one 3 motor for me. I can not wait. Will pair perfectly with my last ICE vehicle ever, a diesel gladiator rubicon"
Wow that thing is huge
Can't wait!!! Hurry up and build mine
Yeah that isn't going to fit in my garage...
"Daaaaang. Ok, I totally hated it at first. Then it started growing on me. Then I loved it. Then I ordered it. 

Damn you Elon!!!"
That thing is an absolute UNIT.
Why would you want to garage it?
Is the suspension in high mode or low mode?
Cybertruck / my new media room. Its like an instant addition to my house!
Is there a truck bed in that thing? It looks like a large car.
Paging Simone Giertz
Does anyone have a the dimensions? I want to measure my garage.
"Im sure it’s capable but it just seems too large for not commercial use, and it’s not pleasing on the eyes. I hope there are some serious cosmetic changes before release."
"Any chance someone could do this with an F-150 or another popular truck? This is a really interesting perspective and I'd love to see how the beds compare. I'm 6'4 and I can't imagine being able to look into that cybertruck bed, but I have no idea how tall this thing is"
Oh wow... what did I sign up for?!?!? Haha
That's actually useful and something that would be good to have on their web site. You don't get any clue for the size and scale of the vehicle with what they show. It's a lot more monstrous in size than the pictures on their web site would suggest.
Nobody actually thinks this thing is pretty do they? I mean I love teslas and all but that is one god awful half-ass DeLorean looking monster.
I'm convinced that this is a hoax
just need to square out the back half and make it a SUV and im sold.
This is why I doubt I'll see many of them in Europe where are roads are smaller.
It can't. Most garages can't. But F-150s don't need to be plugged in. The logistics are a bit of a headache.
Time to figure out where to install a driveway charger...
That’s a tank...
Is it really 20ft long and 15 feet wide ??? This is a monster
what did i do
Builders should be hung for the microscopic garages they build now.
Good luck fitting that in your garage. You need a barn.
Can someone do that with a Model X?
Tesla should ask SpaceX to help with the trucks windows.
I'm going to need a overlay comparison between the CyberTruck and bananas
How is it a truck?
Absolute unit
I would be more interested in a comparison between the truck and the model x. I know trucks are bigger than sedans
But only one of these is capable of defeating the Decepticons.
"Not going to gamble on it, but I hope the Cybertruck sets a design trend."
Waiting for it to finish rendering
Love that techno design
"Whats the payload on this? No sense in making a huge truck if all it can haul is groceries. The main thing I see about it is that it looks too ""nice"" to really use it as a truck. That deck lid, whatever thing it is is going to get jammed with debris pretty easily.

Still looks cool though"
Can you make the front comparison ?
Damn that's a huge death trap
CYBERTRUCKMA
Absolutely the coolest truck not yet on the market. Hope they add RGB inside.
"So what youre saying, is that a truck is bigger than a car??"
*Transformers* Robots barely in disguise
"That's huge, I know a model 3 is fairly roomy"
"I’m worried about going on a long cross-country trip with a camper/trailer. With the mid range, having to supercharge every 300 miles means removing the trailer every time too; which you don’t have to do with a ICE truck.

Unfortunately the super chargers aren’t built for that right now, at least the ones I’ve been to with my 3.

Anyone else have thoughts on that?"
"So I guess there won't be many Cybertrucks in Europe. 3 is small car for US, but it's decently sized sedan in Europe. S and X are big cars in Europe, but Cybertruck... I don't think I could find parking spot that it would fit into"
its a BIG BOI
Bit big for europe. Good news is elon said smaller cybertruck in the future. Bad news is that is easily a 2025 job.
I’m gonna move to Kansas and open a ranch after buying this thing
"you put down a $100 deposit, why on earth do you have the ct as your flair? lol yikes"
Just makes the model 3 look even better
What a beast
It’s crazy that these are both relatively the same price too
I wonder what it costs to insure. What happens after a collision? What do replacement parts cost and how availible will they be?
That's a huge bitch!
T H I C C
Anyone who made fun of the Pontiac Aztec who likes this vehicle needs to take a good long look at themselves.
Haha Jesus. Good thing model 3 has a great safety rating.
I just ordered a Model 3 just so I can trade it in when the cyber truck comes out.
How the hell is it supposed to fit in _any_ parking spot?
Do it for the S
... Oh. Damn.
Wow that is dramatic
Need a bigger garage!

Can u do this for truck vs model s?
Holy shit
What about the Y? :)
"God damn, that things wheels must turn at pretty insane angles to “corner like it’s on rails” with that wheelbase. As it is Model 3 doesn’t really have that impressive of a turning radius for its size."
A B S O L U T E      U N I T
Just imagine this UNIT on European Roads
Duuuhhh it's a truck
"omg, this thing is enormous"
Will it be possible to park this monster outside US in a normal parking spot? I already have some trouble with a minibus sometimes but this is even worst. There are still some huge pickup here from time to time but I don't know how they manage to park it in a mall parking lot or in a city parking? What will happens to the poor model 3 parked between to Cybertruck at the supercharger?
This can't be accurate. If it is then I'm guessing a lot of people just cancelled their pre-orders. That's way too long.
Truck still ugly no matter what size
"Cyber 3. I think I know what he meant now, saying Model 3 ""won't look like other cars"". Initially there were 2 versions of Model 3 planned."
"Don't get me wrong, i like the cyber truck, but the model 3 has something every other vehicle on the road has, that the cyber truck does not.

Side view mirrors.  

I drive a pickup, and am interested in this vehicle, but when i'm towing a load, i'm used to using my TOW MIRRORS.

This truck doesn't seem to have any, so i have to ask, will tow mirrors be included in the production unit, do i have order them through tesla, or do i go through a 3rd party to get them attached to where i need them?

Does anybody know about this or do i write to tesla directly and ask?"
"Who the fuck cares no one's buying that eyesore.

Oh wait people are retarded, they totally will."
Need to plan for driving lessons with large pickups before I take my delivery.
This thing is huge. I can already see some problems driving one in the city and trying to parallel park it.
I woudn't buy the cyber truck because one I can't afford it but more importantly I would be afriad of the rain smashing the windows.

"This car so ugly, I hope it drives on mars"
"This is neat and all, but why does everything in america have to be so unnecessarily large?  It’s going to be funny to watch this thing negotiate the small sized streets where I live."
Imagine getting run over by a lego brick
That won't fit into ANY garage. Wtf
I really wish it was different
"Why does a car need to be bullet proof, is what I want to ask"
I can't wait for the era of rich people absolutely obliterating poor people when they crash. The solid steel construction makes sure the poors won't survive.
Ugly as F...
Just texted this to the wife that it won’t fit in our garage
"Nice thing about this truck, I won’t need to keep it in the garage"
I just measured mine. She’ll be tight.
The truck I wanted didn't fit in my garage and the wife insists on having all our vehicles in the garage. I now have one more truck and one fewer walls.
That thing IS a garage!
"I have two years to convince my wife we need to move closer to my son’s school.

I may need to kick my wife’s car out of the garage and park diagonally."
"Probably won’t fit in our garage either. No worries though, we’re gonna get the solar option and leave it in the driveway. Hoping to never have to plug it in."
That was also the first thing I thought when looking at this. Made me laugh to see it as the top comment
I guess 146k people already think it'll fit in theirs.
"For once I see the benefit of not having a garage.  Well that combined with the solar option.  Even then, it’s gonna be a tight fit in my driveway.  I figure I have about five inches clearance on either side of my car from my house to my neighbor’s car, so that’s nice."
Same.  Then again with how indestructible the thing is do we need a garage?
Maybe it'll lower down to fit by using the air suspension.
Cyber truck don't need no stinking garage! Cybertruck Is garage!
This was my thought too. Guess that preorder isn’t gonna get filled :(
I already measured mine.  No way.  Still plan on getting one.  I'll figure something out because this purchase is going to happen.
Will this thing fit in anyone’s garage? Good lord! My model 3 has little room as it is and I have a standard three car garage!
"its pretty sturdy, just push it in."
That thing isn't fitting in the average european city.
It's not fitting in my whole house
[deleted]
Need a new house to go with the truck!
"I guess that means you need to buy another house. No other solution to this problem, that I can see.￼"
"230"" length barely fits in our garage"
You have 2-3 years to get a new house then.
Or any city street parking
"Looks like we all just came to the realization with this pic.  Such a shame, now I have to get my charger wired to the outside.  I'm sure that'll cost a pretty penny."
Just lower the suspension bitch boi
Maybe with the adaptive suspension you could lower it to 'highway' mode to make it fit? Or maybe thats just wishful thinking
Parking that inside defeats the point anyway
Do we have an actual length?
"But it’s only 6 feet, 1/4 inch tall, with a lowering suspension"
"It’s not going in our garage, NonautonomousJob. It’s going in our living room."
Measured it. Won’t fit in mine. Fuck!
That thing is definitely not fitting on our streets
Just keep driving forward a few feet and I’m sure it will!
"Garages are for wimpy trucks!

This baby is built to rough it.

Although... a garage does sound like a convenient place to charge it... 🤔"
"WHEN you have the garage

*cries in loans*"
Time for a Tesla Solar Garage.
You will have to add on the CyberGarage
I live in a 1959 house.  It is definitely not fitting in my garage.  I hope the ICErs don't egg it or worse.  Going to need security cameras out there.  I'm kind of worried about it.
"man, that probably won't fit in most people's driveway ... especially in LA  

My buddy's pick up which has an extended bed still hits part of the sidewalk at his place when he parks"
"Haven’t gotten an answer to this:

How is anyone going to realistically drive this? Doesn’t look like it even fits into a generously sized parking spot, garage or human sized driveway. 

Who is this for?"
"I just checked, my wife would not fit in this ...."
Garage?  It won't fit in our parking lot!
I just measured.  It will fit in mine with about 3 feet to spare.
The whole point of that truck is to park it outside and drive your neighbors insanely jealous
It's made of stainless steel why do you need to put it in the garage
"I feel bad for y'all. Recently moved and I can fit 5 of these in my garages, and have space to park 12 outside to gather solar power without any of them being blocked in by each other.

Of course now I am house poor and can't actually afford a cybertruck (Okay, yes I can, but only one)."
That's what she said... ;)
"This won't even fit on our roads, let alone garages/parking garages/public parking spots. Completely useless over here, although I do understand it's marketed for North Americans.

Source: am Dutch."
[deleted]
That’s only the first time
Unless it's hailing 1kg steel balls
"Was starting to worry, measured my garage and I basically have just 1 ft of extra space to work with. Might end up closing my garage door on it a couple times but I think it can handle it."
And rust proof!
Wrong! It will only “not fit” once....
Is the Tesla charger weatherproof or something? How do people charge with no garage lol
"I mean, if this won't then most pickups won't anyways, even bare bones F150. Maybe an early 00's Ranger would haha."
"""Don't worry, Honey ... that hail can't do any damage.""  

\[Crack\]  

""Oh My F------ God!"""
"there's also a version with solar panel that generates ~15 miles per day, so there's no point of keeping her in a garage"
You can’t fit a truck in your garage?
"Please, and maybe a Tacoma."
[Here's with F-150](https://twitter.com/DetroitBORG/status/1198296259745984517?s=19)
"According to Elon at the presentation, it fits within the same dimensions as a F150, so I assume they'd be the same length-wise. The F150 is probably taller since it sits on a frame instead of the cab being the frame - not to mention the need for a lower center of gravity to maintain high-speed performance."
[here's the X](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e199jk/size_comparison_between_model_3_and_cybertruck/f8nrcgd?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Haha that's why I made this - it doesn't seem real but it is absolutely huge. I've written up a short summary of my methodology [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e199jk/size_comparison_between_model_3_and_cybertruck/f8nsb5m?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).
"Trucks are big, my guy"
"Trust me I saw this in person the night of the event, it’s absolutely unbelievably massive. It has so much road presence it’s unreal. Just look at this: https://imgur.com/a/TS5jTNF/"
Same dimensions as an F-150.
"It’s not small.  

That said though, the model 3 is actually a pretty small car that lives close to the ground...pretty much the opposite of the CyberTruck."
It's massive: https://i.imgur.com/UmVFvMk.png
"https://imgur.com/6BcHoqU - put it in cad, looks good"
For youu
It's the same size as a F-150 with crew cab. About six inches longer than a GMC Yukon XL.
Isn’t it pretty much the same size as every full size truck?
Did you see the test drive videos?  It's massive.
This is the way
I want a Cyber S. Stripped down battle sedan
“First Principles” at work.
Yes I want a cyber 3 with the same economics.
"It's so ugly, it's got sharp edges and everything"
The 500+ mile version will take quite a while to top up.
Probably why the charge port is behind the wheel well instead of higher up
"The charging port location might be a problem. Cables are way too short to reach. Already have to park within a foot to get them to reach the far corner of a Model 3 in my experience, and this looks to be a much greater distance."
*Give me the charger or I'll crush your 3 into a pancake*
"OK here is the size comparison with the Model X:

"On it, one minute"

Model X vs Cybertruck!"
Thing is bigger than my apartment
IT's how big trucks are. Cyber Truck is essentially the same as F-150 in length and width. Very minor differences.
"I figure I'll just stop going anywhere it won't fit. Why would I need to go places, anyway? I'll have my Cybertruck.

Plus, I'll be too broke to go anywhere."
Elon said it's a possibility they will launch a smaller version with similar design.
Move up to norther MN. Big trucks outnumber just about anything else.  My little model 3 is dwarfed by them. :-)
Pretty sure it parks itself that tech is old even in ice cars.
Agreed. I think people should make lots of noise that they want it slightly smaller. The width is the main issue. The size of it has me wavering.
"Cybertruck is definitely waaay too large for European streets, but I too think ""damn, I hate trucks, but I want a cybertruck."""
It will probably be able to park itself lol
"Me before the premiere: I don't know what the excitement is all about. Who even needs a pickup truck?

Me after the premiere: I do."
"Right? It just looks so awesome. It’s also strangely cheap. Like, i have no need for a huge truck, but what the hell, at under 40k I might as well get it over a 3 or Y, right? 6 seats plus huge storage space"
"The design is jarring for sure, but it grew on me. Once I learned the reason for the design choices i was more on board with them. I would love at least one more angle so the roof is flat and it would look a lot more normal without the hat point on top. Granted it will probably have bit of sculpting done for regulation sakes in the next year. Would love the rugged do anything finish on it and not worrying about damaging it. They definitely did a lot of research on it and want to see more of that laid out."
Lmao me too! The need is strong with this one
Same for me. The more I look at this picture the more I need my model 3
Wonder if that means model 3 will eventually get a big price cut
ham?
"Visited there from the US last year. It will be fine on your motorways.

Those other things you have over there are not “roads”. Those are paved sheep paths and no cars should be allowed on them."
✌🏼🤟🏼🤘🏼
look at it next to F150. It’s not huge at all . It’s the same size as the most popular vehicles in the US.
"Nah, she's met me. 



(Couldn't help myself)"
Giggity.
Like how it’s the case with 90% of the trucks here in the US that share the road with my 3?
"> they won't even be able to see inside the truck's cabin.

Welcome to Texas."
Have you seen a full-size pickup truck before?
"Standard pickup truck height, yes."
"Hmm. Bench seat. Auto-pilot. Female companionship. Bad ass truck. Good they can't see in, that's private."
They better offer it in a powdercoated black.
"That reminds me, why the duck are side mirrors in S so limited and can't be set properly wtf. Even set completely outside I can still see half of my trunk in them. And that means blinding me from all big trucks"
"Don't worry, there's only one beam and I'll be way above our heads."
Bout time I get my revenge.
"I'm floored by the amount of people posting like the size of the Cybertruck is some outlandish surprise. 

Like. It's a truck."
For real. So many ‘OMG no way this fits in my garage’. They must just live in small apartments with tiny garages. Every single garage on the Midwest will fit this vehicle. If it fits a truck then it’ll fit the cybertruck
"While it may be the same dimensions as a full-size pickup, it looks much bigger because of the shape: [https://www.google.com/search?biw=1378&bih=1049&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=bDfcXd2IGJPt-gSjv6GgCQ&q=cybertruck+vs+f-150&oq=cybertruck+vs+f-150&gs\_l=img.3...4439.6391..6574...1.0..0.91.1087.14......0....1..gws-wiz-img.......0i8i7i30.LIherHjGXJ8&ved=0ahUKEwjd7sbll4bmAhWTtp4KHaNfCJQQ4dUDCAc&uact=5#imgrc=2L-PfAgw5fW7BM:](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1378&bih=1049&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=bDfcXd2IGJPt-gSjv6GgCQ&q=cybertruck+vs+f-150&oq=cybertruck+vs+f-150&gs_l=img.3...4439.6391..6574...1.0..0.91.1087.14......0....1..gws-wiz-img.......0i8i7i30.LIherHjGXJ8&ved=0ahUKEwjd7sbll4bmAhWTtp4KHaNfCJQQ4dUDCAc&uact=5#imgrc=2L-PfAgw5fW7BM:)

So even if you've seen a full-size pickup, this still looks huge, because it looks like a car with truck dimensions, which no one is used to."
"My drive will fit it, I sized it for a light truck because I thought I might get a bigger boat than I got"
"35"""
Parking is easier when it can't dent...
It’s the size of an f150 so it really isn’t that big.
you will be laughing at me. manhattan.
Tesla should have the best auto park
"It's fun watching people who know nothing about trucks acting like this will be just another sedan/crossover. It's a completely different ballgame haha. As someone who routinely has to park his F150 in downtown areas, have fun!"
Good thing the deposit is $100
"Just like Hummers, they will be popular for a few years until the driver realizes it can’t fit through a common drive thru or park anywhere conveniently."
In downtown Montreal an F150 is too big for a standard parking spot. Both too wide and too long
"But in theory, you just get out and it parks itself.

In theory."
"I have a Ford f350 dually, I can parallel park that thing better than most drivers of a Toyota prius. This thing will be nothing."
auto park gonna be clutch now
Definately big for Europe.
I wonder if it will ever be sold in Europe? Will be nearly impossible to fit a car like that pretty much anywhere. I’ve seen a few F-150s in Sweden but iirc they aren’t officially sold in Europe.
I'm sure it will park itself 🙂
"I live in a spread out midwestern city. 1/3 of the vehicles here are bigger ford and Chevy trucks. I can tell a few areas I would have trouble driving this beast, but not many."
"I remember taking my 2010 explorer to downtown houston and i hated my life trying to park in a parking garage, i cleared the ceiling by a little over 2 inches and couldnt go down certain areas due to pipes hanging too low. That was fun."

"I have a lifted Jeep that is also on 35s, it actually sits a little higher than the Cybertruck and I have zero issues. You're one of those people that think ""hur dur dur trucks dont fit"" aren't you?"
Is that a common f150 configuration? I think most crew cab buyers opt for a slight shorter bed. For other comparisons the Cybertruck is about a foot longer than something like a Suburban or a Gladiator.
Yep. It does look deceptively large though.
I think the width is more comparable to a Raptor though. Which is quite a bit wider.
[deleted]
Would be really nice if there was some way to naturally secure the sheets in without straps every time though. Like if that ramp could flip up too and lock in a 90° position
Have we definitely heard that the bed is 4' wide?
And still 98% of pick up truck drivers will never transport anything meaningful with it...
I think a lot of people who don’t care about trucks are ordering this for the aesthetics alone. I needed the reality check! This thing is far too big for the UK!
"And it's pretty much the exact size of the F150. Same length, the cabin is slightly smaller because of the slanted roof."
"It's like a DeLorean ATE A CAN OF SPINACH AND THEN knocked up a Pontiac Aztec. And yes, every Cybertruck will eventualy end up on Mars ;)."
"I mean it's not unlike a big van. Not fun to park, but it's possible. You shouldn't daily drive this truck in an European city anyway imo, it doesn't make much sense."
"Just for comparison, the Model S can *barely* fit in the largest parking spots I've found here in Sweden, and even that is solely because only the wheels are required to be inside the lines."
"Maybe in private property, but it's basically a mini bus."
Right? Screw the garage. And the garage door.
You intending to buy one?
"I’m not super knowledgeable. But F150s come in different varieties. Lots of them are 2 doors for instance, and some of them have shorter beds. 

This is 4 doors + 6.5 feet bed... this is likely longer than most F150s"
I think it’s bigger than most F150s
https://boingboing.net/2019/11/23/na-na-na-na-bananaman.html
This is the same size as normal 1500 series pickup trucks.
"Why? It's not that big. If you can't park this, perhaps you shouldn't buy one."
"The methodology is fairly straightforward.

The dimensions for the truck came straight from the initial launch presentation: [https://i.postimg.cc/bvbTwF3q/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/bvbTwF3q/image.png)

Also confirmed on wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\_Cybertruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Cybertruck)

The dimensions compare as follows:

||Length|Width|Height|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Model 3|184.8 inches (4.69m)|72.8 inches (1.85m)|56.8 inches (1.44m)|
|Cybertruck|231.7 inches (5.89m)|79.8 inches (2.03m)|75 inches (1.91m)|
|**(Model 3 / Cybertruck) \* 100 (%)**|**79.76% (value used for scaling image)**|91.23%|75.73%|

Scaling the length of the Model 3 into the image, it is pretty much exactly 4/5th's the length of the truck."
Which pull video?
Doug Demuro has a Humvee and made a video on it. They’re surprisingly small compared to modern full size SUVs.
"Elon did reply on twitter that, longer term, a smaller version would be considered."
">they can fit their one child up front.

Once the kid is out of a booster seat"
"They can't really, because it's a unibody. That means a redesign for every model. 

All the other truck mfgrs do body on frame in large part because they can offer various bed and cab options on the same platform, even share it with SUVs. 

But, I agree, a small EV truck would be awesome."
As long as you go on a straight line.
[deleted]
"Yes. And despite the fact that I hate people who drive vehicles this large, when the majority of them genuinely don't need to, I want it."
"No.

It's the same size as any other full size work pickup."
"I mean, my Model 3 lives outside and it's perfectly fine. The truck won't catch fever or anything."
Why does it need to park inside? Stainless and glass will be fine outside.
But micro fractures ...
"My hope is to get one for pulling my boat and using when my partner has the other car

Not a daily driver, weekends, heavy jobs, once a week into town"
"It has a frunk.


https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e06x83/images_of_cybertruck_frunk_and_side_storage_bins/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
80% this size would still be too large for most of the EU.
Would still be way too large. You'd be considered being selfish and desperate for attention if you'd drive this thing in any European city by a lot of people I'd think (rightfully so imho)
"In the back corner, far from the entry, on days when the carpark isn't full"
"On top of two cars, like how other trucks park at supermarkets."
It's the same size as any other full size pickup such as the Ford F150.
Agree
"I mean, calling “MAJOR BS” is a tad unfair. The dimensions I’ve used in the composite are [based exactly on the ones Tesla has provided for both vehicles in an official capacity](https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e199jk/_/f8nsb5m/?context=1).

I’m not dismissing your point, if you can provide more accurate figures to work with for the sake of a demonstrative then please do (genuinely).

The cybertruck is so large for the UK that I’d be happier if it was actually smaller than this."
"I really wanted to do that but couldn’t find any images of just the front of the cybertruck- they were always angled. 

If you can find me an image of the cybertruck front I can edit and scale it properly."
At 3 tons
Probably the same thing every other vehicle does. A ton of airbags lol.
Crush cores. That's how they create crumple zones. Imagine getting into a fender bender and only replacing $50-$100 in honeycomb crush cores. The panels are still fine. Same energy gets absorbed.
https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e0ixoh/sizeshape_comparison_tesla_cybertruck_vs_ford_f150/
"Just looking at the pictures, you think it's going to be huge, but it's far from the biggest vehicle on the road. In fact, it's the same size and weight as a F-150, the most sold vehicle in the US."
"Yep, I had the same reaction when I saw it.

Then I read about it sitting 6 comfortably, about the 500 mile range, the 3 sec 0-60, the fact that it can power my house for 3 days during a blackout and about the 3mm stainless steel exterior that won't scratch.

I put a deposit on it last night - one cannot be too prepared for a zombie apocalypse after all."
It's the same size as a F150 pickup truck.
15 feet wide? It’s 80” wide. Just an inch wider than a Model X.
"Tesla only showed one figure for payload, so I infer it applies to all variants.

Base model: 3500 lbs payload, 7500+ lbs towing
AWD: 3500 lbs payload, 10,000+ lbs towing
Tri-motor: 3500 lbs payload, 14,000+ lbs towing"
"Why are people downvoting this. This is funny. Its not like the cybertruck is a conventional design anyways. I like it, and it to totally makes sense why someone wouldn't like it. Its brutalist for sure. 

I think it's way cooler than the Aztec though"
So will the truck or I'll eat my dick
The same way you park an F150. It's really not that hard. Now the big HD trucks are tough to park.
"Smartpark / summon will be much more refined in 2 years...

Drop you off in front of the store, truck goes and parks on top of some cars."
"I could park an extended cab 1 ton dually in most spots, this is smaller."
"Obviously by raising the suspensions to the max ; the average car height isn't that high, the truck should be able to drive on them, rendering available literally *any* parking space you want"
"""M3"" is most certainly NOT referring to the BMW performance sedan in this thread. It's **Model 3**."
"it's not bigger than a f-150 and I've seen some on European Roads, they do just fine"
It'll be fine in Australia
"Heh, my Model 3 is the absolute biggest thing I can fit in my garage."
"Yeah I was thinking it was more mid-size, not Noah's Ark sized. I think we need some truth here."
This is a concept car. Production model will have sideview mirrors
"Mirrors are required by law right now. Some automag websites posted that the headlights and tail lights aren't within regs either. Basically, it's a concept vehicle. We'll see a final design in a year or two, and then a year or two before production."
"Well, it is a full-sized truck, not a city car. It’s even slightly smaller than a crew cab f-150 with a 6.5’ bed."
r/ihadastroke
This is going after the full size truck market. A lot of these guys park outside. Or they have barn sized garages.
America
"It'll have terrible ratings in vehicle/pedestrian impacts, but that's no different to other similar sized vehicles"
"Time for a new house obviously

That’s what she said.
Good thing I don't have a garage!
Not with that attitude.
Thanks. What’d she say?
"Plenty of people have trucks that wont fit I  the garage, ever seen an F350"
"No paint to fade, but the trees near me drip goop, leaving windscreens spotty like glue dew. I'm in the ""vague thinking about it"" phase of building a house; the cybertruck now provides a definite requirement"
Battery still won't like freezing temperatures.
"Stainless can still rust, and the exterior will need to be cared for. But it'll be better than paint, especially in conditions where you'd get lots of paint chips."
It is a garage....
I will have to run the second charger out to the side of the house I guess.
"It's just so much nicer having a car that isn't covered in frost on winter mornings or scorching hot in the summer afternoon or getting out into the rain on rainy days. My double cab long bed tacoma fits. Even though this is only six inches longer, I'm not sure it would fit."
"My trucks will be on Tesla Network 24X7, except the one I drive daily."
Insert terrible ‘she’ joke here.
Almost upvoted you but you are at 69 and it's so perfect.
Are the measurements available online?
Measured with door up or down? Don't wanna ruin your garage :)
What are the official measurements?  My garage has an extra space where perhaps the back could fit into giving me an extra 1.5-2 feet.
And one less wife
"That's why they made it bullet proof, scratch proof and sledgehammer proof. There's no paint job to protect. Why would it need to be in a garage?"
Only for a cyberquad ATV
Does it fit my model 3?
"If all else fails, kick the wife out."
Just convince her you also need a pole barn
It would probably be cheaper to use that extra money to put more solar panels on your roof.
"Good luck with that! Unless you intend on only using it every few months, this will never happen!"
[deleted]
Same here saw the pic and 1st thing I thought was fak my 3 barely has any room the trucks not gonna fit.. It's ok it's SS it won't rust can leave it outside hehe
I don't intend to put it in the garage.
200k now ...
200k
Or have not told their wives.  :-)
If I had this I would be looking forward to hailstorms
"I park in my driveway, I'm more worried about it fitting in any normal city parking spot. I drive a big suv (4runner) already and the cybertruck is 41"" longer."
"I'm betting a lot of people just haven't thought that far ahead yet. Unless they already own trucks, they may not realize that trucks don't fit in most garages. Worst case though, it's not that hard to drill a hole through the garage wall and run wiring through to an outdoor outlet."
$100 refundable deposit is a long way from an actual sale. Or 146K people accept that they will be parking it outside.
I don't have a garage! problem solved. 🤷‍♂️
"146k reservations for $100 is nothing, the number that will actually go through with it will likely be 1/4 of that"
"Pretty sure it won't fit in mine, but I'd think I can get HOA ok to put a HPWC on the outside of the house and run the hose/cord to it."
"at $100 down, id be more than a little skeptical as to how many of those people end up buying one."
"True, I personally like having my driveway clear but I think I'll survive"
"I feel like the length is going to be more of a problem than the height. And also potentially the width if your garage has single-bay doors.

I live in a neighborhood where most of the garages have 3 single doors and everyone seems to park their trucks outside."
How low can it go?
Who am I kidding? no need for a house when you have that behemoth
No problem. Use a tennis ball on a string hanging from the ceiling. Adjust the length of the string so that as soon as the windshield makes contact with the ball you know you’re in the perfect position. Easy and 100% accuracy.
231.7 inches
"Length, I've got 3 inches to spare, too close for comfort"
Does that say something about our current society that the same size F150 is the most popular vehicle?
"Exactly, didn't need that closet"
"External dimensions are equal to or smaller than a crew cab F150, so Americans?"
Have you honestly not seen a pickup truck?
One smaller than the car
One that is shorter in length than this truck and most others.
"Well the length (10” longer than a Chevy Suburban) wouldn’t allow it to fit in a lot of normal garages, and once they add mirrors to an already wide truck it would be very tight for a standard 8’ door"
"At best my garage is 235 inches from front to back. So yeah if I leave 1.6 inches on either side I could fit it. Any realistic scenario, no."
"I can fit Model 3 in my garage or Model S, but then I need to open it to walk around the car"
"Some of my neighbors didn't opt for the tankless water heaters, the Model X doesn't even fit in their garage. Fits fine in mine though."
Too soon
The windows are 1kg-steel-ball-proof UNLESS you're on tv.
Preparing for the apocalypse I see. With hail like that you'd be dead no matter what.
Is that the confirmed weight of the ball?
Acquire aloe.
Would a garage help if that was the case? Haha. That'd be scary as shit.
Or it gets hit on the side panel 1st.
If its hailing 1kg pieces of anything I think I'd be terrified
Honestly decent sized hail is going to hit harder than some dainty throws from a few feet away
"Better be careful, it might dent or scratch your garage door."
1ft is plenty. My current garage has ~ 1 ft and is stress free parking. Last house was maybe 3-4 inches to spare and i would often push the truck the last few inches by hand.
We stuck some bits of wood on the garage floor so all you did was reverse till you hit them and then you know you're in the right spot
My tacoma only had about 1 ft of clearance. After a while you learn it. Took maybe a week. I would always turn my headlights on and use those as a guide for how close I was to the front wall
"When I bought my CCLB Canyon, on the test drive I drove home and parked it in the garage to make sure it fit. Probably 2 foot to spare."
Try this trick that the father of a childhood friend of mine did. Hang a piece of string from the ceiling or rafters of the garage at the farthest point forward that the most forward part of the vehicle can park. Give yourself some leeway for human error in case you go a little too far forward. Make sure the string is long enough to hit that part. Hang a small light weight at the end that won't damage the vehicle. As you slowly move forward when you see the string move you've moved forward enough. You could even tie some reflective ribbon in a few places on the string to make it easier to see when it moves.
And acorn proof! My model 3 already has 2 small dents from acorns!
I charge outside all the time. Not an issue.
"The wall connector is what they use as destination chargers, and a lot of those are outside all the time."
"Most of the EV charging stations in my town are outdoors and uncovered (they're not suber chargers, mostly level 2, and a DC fast charger that I know of)."
Do you only supercharge indoors?
"Yes, I have one in my garage and one outside on a post for when i'm too lazy to park inside the garage. :)"
just run a cord?
Then a Miata!
I second the Tacoma.
And a Ford Raptor
Tacoma I second this
Lol. The comment about waking him up when it has a 500 mile range. It already has.
Not sure I believe that one.  In the towing the f150 video it looks substantially bigger longer and taller
"Something in that picture that I notice is that with  the angular roof design, the rear passengers are probably going to be hitting their head on the roof"
Thank you

How big are those tires? Does Costco have those in stock?
"If they hadn't shown the dimensions, you could always use one standard Elon length for scaling."
Can you do the width of model 3 vs truck?
"Lol exactly. 

The wheelbase is about the same as an F150, I'm not sure why people are confused or surprised about its size."
"Exactly, living in Houston, this thing is going to fit right in with all the other road monsters."
That last photo with the red car on the right makes the point. Ouch. I won't cancel though until I see a production spec. It may be hilariously huge instead of just otherworldly huge.
Isn’t it the same dimensions as a F150? Do You consider those “unbelievably massive”
But Elon was the same height as it. Is only the length and width a concern?

Is it really as big as an F150? It looks much bigger"

"Ha thanks, definitely too big for me then."
I think if your going for ultimate utility it's going to have to be stainless battlewagon.
"I regret getting my model 3 performance now. Nah, I’ll just sell it when the truck comes out lol. I can’t believe 500miles of range! This will be a road trip beast. It also has the same ground clearance (16”) as a hummer h1 that cost over $100,000. The H2 only has a ground clearance of 10”. This truck is going to be a beast off road, on road, and will lead the market in tech."
"Some would say it’s a sharp looking truck, very on point really."
That version should be able to maintain 250 kW charging for quite a while though.
"Wouldn't it be fairly expensive (in EV terms) to charge up all the way?

Edit for clarification: specifically supercharging"
"Without knowing the pack capacity, there's no way to know for sure... I bet it's 20% longer than a P100 model X."
I want to see Tesla show range while towing various weights and trailers. Towing is a huge hit to range of a truck as well so it would be both difficult and annoying to charge up with a trailer. Probably need to have some sort of extension cable for some spots.
I wouldn’t think so.  They are improving charge times.  I think that we will get to the point where this thing can be fully charged from a dead battery in no time at all.  We will someday get to the point where fully charging electric vehicles happens faster than filling the tank on an ICE engine.
"You won't worry backing it up like you worry about your 3. When it goes ""thunk"" you're close enough to plug in."
"It definitely needs a charge port on both ends, or at least an option for it."
Charger ICEd? Drag it clear
Thank you very much!
Hmm are you sure that's accurate?  The cybertruck is almost a full foot taller than the x
Gods work. Appreciate ya.
That's not too big of a difference actually. It's still huge tho.
That's the more interesting comparison.
Thanks! Have been looking for this. Would be great to see a rear view comparison as well...
Thanks!
"Yeah, I have pretty little truck experience, although I've driven a late 90's Dodge Ram 1500 a handful of times a while back (I think that's the same size as the F150?) and that thing felt HUGE.  It certainly handled snow storms better than the similar year camaro I owned at the time, but yeah, I'm used to and tend to prefer smaller vehicles.  The Model 3 AWD would probably be the best fit for my out of the current lineup, although a Model Y might not be bad either."
"I think the width is more comparable with the F150 Raptor, which is a lot wider than a standard F150.  That said, I've driven a Raptor before and it was a PITA to park. I suspect that the Cybertruck is going to need all of its cameras to get in a parking space."
"Yeah, I think I found a way I might be able to afford it.  I just don't pay rent, don't try to buy a house, and just live in the cyber truck instead."
Plenty of space on Mars.
Like a Subaru Baja size. That’d be great!
Hope it works for my current reservation
"I'm in PA, so there are tons of rural areas with trucks everywhere, and trucks are pretty common here in general.  But there are still some cities and whatnot, and I don't currently have a legitimate need for a truck at the moment....but the Cyber truck has been making me try to come up with some."
"I mean, if the parking spot is physically large enough in the first place. With city street parking it isn't always."
Width is actually narrower than the Model S if you include its side mirrors.
"Me on first seeing it: I want it.

Me after finding out more about it: It's how big? That's ridiculously impractical and unnecessary for me.

Me three seconds later: I want it anyway."
"Unveil: uhhh - hmm.

5mins later: yeah ok it’s pretty fucking neat

1 day later: so babe I uh, preordered the most ridiculous truck...thing...that has ever been"
Right? Like I’m not even a fan of pickup trucks and have no use for one but this is just so damn amazing with the specs and features
"Me before: please don't be bigger than a full size pickup

Me after: please get approved in my country"
Who even needs a pickup truck?!?!
"It would seem very likely.  Just wouldn't make sense otherwise.  But the challenge for Tesla is meeting demand and manufacturing.  They'll have to keep building more assembly lines.  Make more batteries.  And there's the Y, the Roadster, and the Semi to account for as well.  Tesla would be absolutely slaying if they had all the infrastructure in place to make all these vehicles."
"My guess is the entire lineup is going to get massive improvements to range, performance, and luxury elements in that timeframe."
More likely they won’t actually be able to build the CT this cheap. Or it’ll be so costly that they barley make any single motor models or even cancel it altogether.
Probably not. It's the manufacturing method + lack of paint that makes it cheap.

"Haha yes it would be fine on the motorway but I'd say that the majority of people don't drive on motorways daily, it's not like the US with lots of big wide open roads everywhere."
Everyone in here is acting like they have never seen a truck before. This size is normal..
"CUVs are the most popular segment in the US, by far, but you are right that it is simply “truck sized”."
Yeah this is an every day occurrence for me lol
[deleted]
I want it in forest green but shiny. Idk if it would look amazing but its a pretty nice color.
Elon even pointed out in the presentation that it's the same size as an F150.
"Knowing nothing, and just seeing a few pictures over the past couple of days, it was quite surprising. There wasn't anything to scale in any media I saw, so it looked almost small.

Fucking love that it's an actual truck."
Not my midwestern garage — it’s over 100 years old and used to be a stable. Even the model 3 is a tight fit.
This sub makes me feel poor... er
Yes it can.
"A F150 is humongous for a city car. Around where I live even the Model 3 is a tight fit for some spots.

This will be fine in the mid-west suburbs... California Bay Area or places like LA and Seattle? Yeah not so much..."
"F150s are dumbass vehicles to city-drive and park, and I wish people realized that."
Cries in European
And I can say from experience driving and parking an F150 in a city is not fun
*laughs in European*
Says an American. Same when they talk about engines: “It’s only a 4 liter V8”
"Why in god’s name would you even own a car, let alone a truck, in Manhattan?"
But actually it’s garbage
You're rare. Most idiots with their large trucks can't park for shit and that's coming from a semi driver
"Had one parked in the two back to back parallel spots at Costco. Thank goodness it was my prius in one of those, because the F350 ate up a huge chunk of my spot."
And what “city” would this be?
No good at all in medieval town centres
"They do sell them in Sweden, but note that they are significantly smaller than the ones sold in the US. 

The largest F-150 Raptor you can buy in Sweden is 5.36x2.02. That's about a full meter shorter than the US version (250.5in ≈ 6.36m)."
I like that we’re finally getting a full size electric truck
that's a really good idea. you should tweet it to elon
Oh man I hadn’t even thought of that; that’s be amazing.
Like the last 2-3 pieces being able to fold up? I like that idea as long as it doesn't add significant cost or weakness.
"Or even just lift-up pegs which are spaced for 4'x8' sheets. No sliding around, and nice and secure for any sheet goods."
"I would think a tensioned bar of some sort that rotates or pops out of the top edge of the tailgate would be simple enough to implement.   Racheting teeth or strap.

But that would only secure the tail end.  Front end would need like an old school doctors height ruler that folds out of the weight scale."
"It's not 4' wide, it's 56"" wide."
5 foot wide
"They'll get talked into helping a friend move, or picking up some oversized thing for someone

Everyone you have ever met hears when you get a vehicle that can carry and tow"
Only two feet/60 cm longer than a Toyota Hiace :) That's in minibus territory...
It's going to sink the UK!
"Yeah .. not the kind of vehicle to drive into the city. But to buy a lot of stuff, get stuff from IKEA (with charged parking in front of it), drive towards a vacation home it might just do the job."
Cabin is bigger because no engine
"It's actually quite a bit larger than a European mini bus. 

The Cybertruck is 5.9m long. The VW Sharan Mini bus is 4.6m. The outright gigantic [Mercedes ""Extra Long"" V-Class](https://www.mercedes-benz.se/vans/sv/v-klass/v-klass/body-variants/image-group/extralong-normal/_jcr_content/parsysmeta/meta/image.mq6.jpg/1552483542000.jpg) is 5.37m."

"good job, put it in cad to double check - https://imgur.com/6BcHoqU"

"During the presentation they played a video of a tug-of-war between cybertruck and an F150

Spoiler: it went better than the window demo"
"The tweet for others:
https://i.imgur.com/2HfxdWD.jpg"
"Thanks, I saw that tweet just after I posted. That's awesome.

On another note I've said that Elon tweets too much, but maybe it also gives him some useful feedback, and it's definitely a great marketing tool for him"
"Why? It has similar geometry to any other truck, better engine braking, plenty of mass. It's rated to pull quite a bit"
"There’s plenty of gooseneck and fifth-wheel trailers under 14,000 lbs. It’s a legitimate question."
Tow heavy?
I can use it to carry my whole house
I have no driveway though. My garage door faces an alley and I can't just park behind it because I would obstruct others. So that leaves street parking with no access to my 240V outlet.
"Give it ten years, your model 3 will have peeling clear coat

Cybertruck will be just as grey as the day it was born"
"Charging. I have a 14-50 outlet in the garage, but if I can't fit the truck in there I have no way of charging at home. I can't block the alley behind my garage and use an extension cord either."
"Ok, maybe BS was misplaced. But it's not accurate. I think you should have used Elon as the reference. I'm not sure how you normalized both to unified scale."

Ah it's alright. I was just curious. It's 2-3 years away so plenty of time to see different versions 😉
Just look for a front F150 shot. The cybertruck is 0.1 inches narrower.
"Tru tru. The funny part was that most of the people saying it were saying ""we need crumple zones to protect pedestrians from collisions"" like no Sharon they're for occupants"
Thank you
It looks massive like double a model 3
"Yep. Payload is governed by chassis and suspension. Since the difference between the models is battery packs and motors, nothing else, bed payload wont be any different. That being said, 3500lb payload is quite impressive for a non heavy duty truck.."
"Hahah yeah i went and looked it up after i posted. Pretty impressive actually. I still think the bed is weird, but it does look kind of cool"
Calm down McAfee

"Never been to Australia but I guess it's fine regarding all the space you have, maybe only in city center it might be a problem, thus big truck shouldn't be uncommon there.

But in most European countries and some Asia, I can clearly see it as a problem, imagine parking this in Tokyo? Or in London? I'm not even sure I can take the turn to enter the parking garage in my building, if I get one I'll have to rent a large spot outside.

I have at least a couple of year to figure this out, it's my major concern with this car, otherwise I'm really interested and did reserve one."
"Yep, it will be fine in there, as GM and Ford has sold their full-size truck in there."
"Thank you.

I thought it was production model, not a concept one. This makes sense now.

Thanks."
"Thank you.

I thought this was not a concept, but a production prototype.

My bad."
"The ultra-hard body might not pass regs, esp. EU regs. They regulate the radius of bodylines. Sharp edges not allowed."
Just live in the Cybertruck?
Time to tell Elon we need a cyberhouse.
"Guys, my husband called last night and said “we need a new house.” I said “why.” 
He said “1. We can’t charge the car and truck a the same time... 2. I don’t think the truck can fit in our garage.” 

🤣"
"Actually good timing, moved from a house to an apartment, now a new criteria for garage space on the next house, high enough for the Model X Falcon Wings and long enough for Cybertruck"
Or new garage.  One of the reasons my wife argued against it but later relented... we would have to build a new garage to house it!
A CyberHouse!
"This is hilarious, however...

I’ve always wondered what “/s” meant, can you help me out? 😅"
I was coming here to say that...
"Ha. Didn’t see windshield wipers on any of the renderings/reveal, so..."
"Ahh yes, that could be problematic! 


Can you remove the trees and replace them with solar panels?? 😅"
"I'm assuming it will be painted, no? The naked steel look seems like more of a cool reveal concept but I;d guess it'll come in black, white, or red."
Stihl can solve that problem for about $200-300 ;)
Just buy some Ladybugs to eat the aphids. The honeydew  you see all over your car is basically aphid poop.

"Keep shit (tree gunk, bird droppings) from getting on it that you still then have to clean off?  Keep it from baking in the Phoenix sun?  No, pre-cool isn't good enough.  Not have to walk outside in the freezing cold and blowing snow in Green Bay?  I could go on, there's many, many reasons."
Don't forget the son too!
"Probably, but there is a huge coolness factor to having a sun fueled vehicle. My wife *loves* that concept, so it is beyond economics for us."
Would the solar panels generate enough current to even make a dent in the discharged batteries?
"It will be our second car. Historically we only drive our second car few thousand miles a year. Particularly if Tesla does the solar wing thing, 30-40 miles a day of charge makes never plugging in a slam dunk."
This is bullshit astroturfing from oil companies. In reality it would be capable of collecting 15 miles of range per day! I personally would only need to charge about once a month.
"Well then we won’t be taking the truck. 

That is the singularly most important feature for us. IAC, since the deposit is only $100, we aren’t really out anything to get in the queue.

Bottom line: If the solar option shows up, we get it, no solar option, no purchase."
....yet
I haven’t told mine yet but I expressed that I REALLY wanted one...
OMG this is going to trigger some busybody HOA members!
We all now girth is the one stat that matters.
"vague memory from my subconscious which might be inaccurate has the cybertruck ground clearance adjustable from 6"" to 16"".

But I can't find a source for the lower number. Maybe I dreamed it.

edit: apparently the correct range is 8"" to 16"""
Way too close for comfort!
I've never seen an F150. Nobody wants them here.
"> didn't opt for the tankless water heaters

That's a fail."
"Let's be honest: after the infamy of that test, everyone's going to be throwing stuff at Cybertruck windows. It'd be ironic if Cybertrucks ended up being *more* likely to have smashed windows than other trucks, just because of this."
Oh my fucking god
Observing the glass changes its armored state.
"It’s like with Apple, the STRONGEST glass on an iPhone EVER. Still shatters."
I think so
Exactly what I was thinking. A 100g ball of ice travelling at 150 km/h is going to hit with a lot more force than a 1kg steel ball lobbed at 10 km/h.
What if I replace my garage door with 30x cold-rolled steel?
But I don’t think your garage door can handle the pounding.
"That's already what happens with you close a garage door on a car.  Car fine, door crumpled.  My old neighbor had a habit of doing that to his truck.  Never scratches the truck."
"Yea, even if it's 1 inch I'll figure a way to make it work. At this point I'm just hoping their measurements are correct and will hold up through to production. The video of it pulling an F-150 makes it look way bigger than what they're saying."
I think elon has a few 1 kg steel balls that he can spare if you need weights.
And axe proof!
One dropped on my TM3's roof today. Dreading to see the damage. Hoping and keeping my fingers crossed. Wonder if Tesla can make a gorilla glass replacement.
Is the charger waterproof?
And then a smart car!
And then back to the F150
Oh man I don’t even wanna see this thing next to a poor Miata
"Depends on what F150 you're up against though. Is it extended cab or crew cab? What bed length did they choose? There's not just one type of F150, they very based on the package you choose"
"I thought so too but it’s actually pretty similar on paper. Look up the dimensions Elon puts up vs an f-150. The ford is longer or shorter depending on the trim but the width is the interesting part. The cybertruck is actually slightly less wide BUT the cybertruck has no mirrors. The Ford width include fairly large mirrors. So in actuality the cybertruck should look/feel wider since the body is significantly wider. As for squeezing by or fitting into a garage is essentially the same. I do wish the cybertruck were a bit smaller. It’s my biggest concern with it.

EDIT: I’ll also add that the f-150 is not as wide as other full size trucks like the ram, Chevy/gm, and Tundra. That’s part of its appeal to me honestly, I don’t want to go bigger than the f-150."
"Let's see, I thought the tesla looks bigger because of its angular roof design"
"Here's the cybertruck pulling the F-150 uphill if that'll help you.

https://electrek.co/2019/11/25/tesla-cybertruck-tug-war-against-ford-f150-size-comparison/"
"The overlaid F-150 is the crew cab short bed configuration which is more than a foot shorter. Good idea, but it needs to be done on a longer configuration."
Nope. Watch the videos of youtubers riding. They said the back was spacious
"Possible, but there looks to be room (per the videos) the interior is likely (just a guess) set lower in the truck compared to the F-150 as there is no drive shaft to cover."
That's true. It's a problem on all coupe like cars
"Consider that the Cybertruck is not a body sitting on a frame, so the seats probably are located much lower in the vehicle as a result."
Yeah cause I want to give credit to OP and not pretend like I made it
A few youtubers were saying 35”. Not sure Costco carries them in stock but you may be able to order them.
"Costco didn’t stock and couldn’t order 21” for my Audi... I tried several stores and they said they didn’t have the equipment to install tires that large. 20” was the largest I could get. Sams on the other hand could, and Discount Tire price matched them."
Pretty much no one will keep these in stock. Not like that matters though they can ship it in.
Musk even pointed out that the size is very similar to the F150 (crew cab) in the presentation.
Same in the Midwest. I see more raptors a day than Mazdas
Look at the Ford Explorer on the left
Just look at how it dwarfs the license plate lmao
I think that red car might be Simone Giertz’s Truckla. I saw that she was there with it in MKBHD’s recent [video](https://youtu.be/oTZ84U-K_5k?t=6m15s) .
"After that reveal, size would be the deal-breaker? Are you joking? It’s a truck..."
If you saw it in person you’d understand.
I could maybe like it if it didn't have those flat wheel arches and the horrible rims

Assuming a 200 kWh battery and 0.15¢ per kWh it’s $30.00 USD.
"My night time rate is $0.12 per kWh. 200 x .12 = $24 for 500 miles. 

12,000 miles per year = $576 for a year's worth of energy. Insane."
"If we take the estimated battery capacity of 200 kWh (pure speculation at this point) and do a 10% - 90% charge, 160 kWh of electricity at 24p/kWh would be just shy of £40, and would take about 1hr 20m on a 150kW supercharger (assuming standard peak power distribution). Not sure what that would be in USD I'm afraid"
How much does it cost to charge a 250-300 mile version?
Rivian gets 400 miles out of a 180kWh pack.
"It's a big, heavy EV with 500 mile range, everbody knows that it will take quite a while to top up. The truck needs minimum 200kWh capacity."
"I think trailers will have their own battery packs tie back into the truck for extra power and drive time, if not its own drive train/battery pack that helps drive the vehicle together with the truck"
Tri motor will have so much torque available that a light trailer should be negligible. I'm sure they'll release a table though.
Plug em both in at the same time!
"I am indeed.

The [length of the X is 198.3 inches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X) and the [length of the Cybertruck is 231.7 inches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Cybertruck). That makes the length of the X \~85.5% of the Cybertruck.

I re-downloaded the image and re-compared the lengths with exact pixels so show what this looks like: [https://i.postimg.cc/ZnYXGy6t/size-copy.png](https://i.postimg.cc/ZnYXGy6t/size-copy.png)

The other dimensions are visually inferred from this, as the aspect ratio of both images are maintained."
air suspension?
The peak has to be super tall to give headspace for the rear passengers.
"Maybe his pic is with the X all the way up, but the CT all the way down?  That would account for about 6"" delta in vertical."
Odds are that a late 90s pickup is significantly smaller than a new F150. Pickup truck size inflation is a real thing.

"This is definitely where I’m at.  I live in a condo and park in a garage at work, I have absolutely no use for a pickup truck and it would be wildly impractical.

Still putting down a deposit on Friday."
"I told my wife about it the day after I put my money down. I told her before I got my Tacoma 2 years back that if Tesla ever came out with an electric truck that I was going to buy it. I wasn't expecting it to originally look the way it does, but after the initial shock it's really growing on me. The production of the tri motor lines up almost perfectly with when my current truck will be paid off. With Tacomas being the vehicle with the highest resale value, I should have a nice down payment to use for the cybertruck.

Also after she saw the pictures of it she sent me puking gifs but that's ok. I will love it for its personality."

"I rented an F150 recently, first time actually driving one. Didn't have much trouble driving and parking it in Portland, a city not known for its expansive parking spaces and wide streets. When I went back to model 3 though i felt like i was in a gocart."
"have CUVs finally come out on top? I keep hearing how the truck is the ""best selling car"""
Yee haw.
"I also thought the truck looked kind of small during the reveal, but then when he said the actual dimensions I understood what size it actually was. 

And I would personally prefer a smaller Ford ranger size of truck, but I'm perfectly okay with the current cyber truck."
I drive a f250 longbed in a city and I do just fine.
"Big SUVs and full size pickups all over SF all day every day. Same with LA.

Personally I’d go smaller, but it’s a non-issue.

I’m more curious about the super old cities in the northeast. Never been to most of them.

This thing would suck in every Italian city I’ve been to."
"This will be 100% fine in bay area. Unless you must street park in SF or Oakland all the time, this car will fit in basically any garage or parking lot. 

Just think of it this way. Are there F150s all over in any of your listed cities? I see them everywhere here in bay area."
And they'll be showing up early all over SFBA so I'm sure we'll get pictures of them in the wild.
"Own a Model 3, work downtown and park in a garage.

Every now and then I borrow my girlfriend’s crew cab 6.5’ bed ram 1500. It’s about 8” longer than Cybertruck and she leaves a hitch ball mount in.

Parking it in the garage usually means going four levels down and trying to find an end space where it won’t block anyone else.

8” shorter (maybe 12” shorter without hitch) will help a little but it’s still going to be a pain."
Bay Area would be ok (in most places) if you’re not in San Francisco.
My brother drove my dads F150 for a few weeks and lived in the Bay Area at the time. It wasn’t an issue. If you daily a truck you know how to drive it.
"I drove my f150 all over LA many days a week for the past 18 months until I got my model 3. It’s completely doable. It’s really not hard at all. Once in a while you park further away from something than you might otherwise, but I do that with my model 3 too."
"Bay Area would be fine. It would just be tough inner city SF. Rest of the Bay is really not that compact. I use to drive a land yacht LS400 fine, can’t be that much longer, probably wider."

Driving a truck in LA actually just gives you leverage on the freeway
I haven’t had any trouble with an f250 in the city.

"If it is uncommon, then yes! However, when I lived in Florida, so many people had pick-up trucks (including myself).

Even then it would have been much cheaper to just rent a U-Haul trailer / truck and to buy a more efficient vehicle for everyday driving."
"So what? I'll just ""SmartSend"" it to them and then then can send me some satoshi in return."
And width?
"Maybe I dunno, I was thinking about this. It’s too big for the city but it’s also far too big for the countryside so I’m just not sure where that leaves it."
Cabin is smaller because sloped roof and frunk
"I definitely have no reason to get one, holy shit that thing is a tank without barrel"
"It's also 2,02m wide; that's more than a VW T6 Bus, haha. And that's without side view mirrors."

"I have driven in Italy, and in towns that pre-date cars anything that comfortably seats four is too big

But yes, Australia has space outside the biggest cities. You would have a bit of difficulty parking in Sydney or Melbourne, but in Canberra (where I live) I could park a cybertruck within a 10 minute walk of the city centre"
"Musk essentially pushed it that way, and usually companies don’t take deposits on prototypes. It’s kind of a strange rollout. And the $100 deposit is weird, too. Even at $1000, many get cancelled, but at least then the deposit is an indication of a serious buyer."

So uhhh instead of paying rent I’ll start making car payments on something I’ll actually own! And live in my cyber truck down by the cyber river."

"So yeah, if you never drive it you’ll never have to charge it."
"Don’t know why you are getting downvoted on a personal preference. Solar on vehicles is the future, especially as the panels get more efficient. 

For those of us with garages, solar doesn’t make much sense. Also, we have the easiest time charging at home. For those parking outside on the street or driveway, solar makes a lot of sense."

You have a couple of years to ease her into the idea.  :-)
I have been trying to figure that out. That's why I asked. Would it not be crazy if it could go as low to the ground as a normal sedan. It would really give great highway driving.
"I found it, it should be 8 to 16 inches. They advertised 16 inches max clearance, and the cybertruck website advertises that it can adjust 4 inches in either direction."

"Not entirely pure speculation.

Rivian only gets 400 miles out of their 180kWh battery pack.

So my guess is the Tesla having a 225kWh pack.

Which means that Tesla has made or is about to make a huge jump in kWh/dollar. So the model 3 should become quite a bit cheaper."

"I'm not doubting it's ability to pull a trailer in the least, I'm sure from a stop it'll feel like nothing is hooked up behind you.

Sexy time
Hmm interesting thanks for the info.  Didn't realize the x was quite that tall looking.
"I wonder if those #s are accurate. I can’t recall where, but when I was first researching the model 3 I found a source (I think the Tesla website) that led me to believe it was significantly wider than my car at the time (Acura TLX). I was afraid it wouldn’t fit in my garage. 

It turns out it’s actually narrower than my Acura, and either I misread the numbers, or the numbers were wrong. Idk, maybe the same thing is happening in here, because that truck looks crazily too big."

I often have to pass up on smaller spots sedans could get in because I wouldn't even have the clearance needed to back in. Let's be real here lol"
How many millions of people live in that city?
"The funny thing is that giant trucks are most common where the roads are the smallest. Country backroads can be super narrow. I had to drive extended cabs for work in Texas and seeing duallies all the time was kinda stressful since there’s not much room between us passing each other 😂

but parking is abundant in those parts 🤠"
"Lol. I don’t see anyone in San Francisco driving a personal F150. Contractors and other commercial drivers drive them, but I don’t see any personal vehicles. 

A F150 will certainly run into a lot of problems parking both on the street and in residential garages in San Francisco."
"What are you even talking about? I rarely see any F150 in Bay Area other than near construction sites, unlike most of the US it’s not a top selling vehicle here in California.

Parking lots here are so narrow that even compact SUVs have problem parking, so I really don’t know what you are talking about.

Compare here to say... Dallas where every third vehicle is a pickup."

A BMW X7 is 78.74 inches wide and 202.79 inches long.
And the CT is 79.80 inches wide and 231 inches long.

Of course the X7 is huge too, but considered a ""normal"" large car.
Height wise it's not a big difference. Width is neither. 

The length is the only big difference, but of course it is, with a full

Will it fit in normal european city parking spaces. No. But there are a number of
RAM truck drivers, even here in my little town, and they don't have 
issues going to e.g ALDI. 

That said, I rather tow a trailer for the few times a year I need it or put

pickup trucks are not quite such a big deal in Europe."

Dear God. Those are some expensive tires you'll be chewing through. Hopefully there's a smaller option but too much smaller will look weird.
"You realize that 315 and 325 is the width of the tire in mm right? They were referring to 35” diameter. The metric tire size is very silly, 325/75r19 for example is a 19” rim plus the 75 is the ratio of sidewall height to width. So the smaller the middle number the lower the profile."

I admit my desire also comes from the same part of me that wants my home to become a solar powered fortress in case of a nuclear or zombie apocalypse. Do I need it? Odds are very high that I don’t, but I still do want it and think about it. As the solar panels get better, less extreme use cases become more relevant."
"I have spoken.

Edit: the solar panels are on the roof. I don’t get much road grit on my roof. Do you? Also, easy to clean. More so than a home roof. Finally, this allows one freedom from the grid in a more radical way than previously possible. Even if it charges just 15 miles a day. You could camp somewhere for a week, use it to power your lights and tools, then drive 50 miles to the next campground, and repeat indefinitely."
Any idea how high that is?
"Same in my current car. If the proximity sensor isn't red and flashing I'm not close enough. The orange/red line is the sweet spot, but full red is comfortable for giving a few inches."
I thought car pools were supposed to be encouraged
"Yoy can park there, just don’t charge."
Ah shit I gotta go move my car
"I should’ve noted: the solution I came up with that worked for me was spraying WD-40 in the connector latch area a few times before charging. 

It wouldn’t get stuck in the morning after I did that. 

I just don’t know if that’s Tesla sanctioned."
I have spoken.
And then a 1932 Schwerer Gustov railway cannon!
And my bow!
"Same, I lifted my F150 to fit 33"". The MPG took a big enough hit to not make me want to increase to 35"", especially given I'd have to do even more work on the suspension for clearance"
"I know I'm probably preaching to the choir, but is that with a BMC chop on your 4runner? Though FJs can easily clear 35s, my 2010 had 315/75R16s."
Lol. What?
"True, but that is a thing truck owners deal with already... There should absolutely be a ""tire saving"" option that reduces the tire loads."
The 75 is an aspect ratio actually. [how to read a sidewall](https://www.continentaltire.com/news/how-read-tire-sidewall)
I had 315/75r16s that were true 35” tires on my last car. They were Goodyear MTR kevlars. But yeah tire sizes are counter intuitive.
Last I checked in a survival situation the power goes out which means gas pumps don’t work as well as plug-in cars. Thankfully the truck can have a solar power to generate limited range everyday. As far as durability I don’t think you watched the reveal if you think it’s not as durable as a regular truck. Your used to viewing teslas as wonderfully engineered sports cars and not a massive work horse that doesn’t take shit from anyone.
"In the US gas taxes are generally less than 15%, which is close to the taxes on electricity in most areas."
"Alberta Canada, they charge “distribution fees” here so although the cost of the electricity is low the overall bill is comparable to places where the rate is $0.10+. Which gives a huge advantage to anyone with an electric car. I finally bought a place with a garage so an EV is finally possible for me. Alberta is an oil province it’s comical how many people don’t understand how cheap an EV in this province would be."
My parking spot at work is dead north south with no blockages. My commute 11 miles. That should add up decently fast.

"They look liked a stretched sedan from the back, it creeps me out"
Maybe they are measuring length with the tailgate down.
"Houston is also spread out for MILES lol, hardly the standard crowded, condensed city."
Best part? No worry about door-dings in parking spots.
Keep in mind that Texas is a lot bigger state and the cities are a lot newer than a lot of cities in the northeast and there were planned to be less dense as cars were a thing for a majority of their growth

"500 mile range isn't crazy. 

I get 460 on my Tucson. Sure, I pay for gas. But I can stop anywhere to top off. And it cost me 18,000 for the vehicle. 

I drive 80 miles per day for work. I fill up once a week. I park outside. I don want to have to charge every other day. 

This truck is a city truck, but crazy expensive for one. You can go on a trip across Ohio, let alone Texas or one of the plains states. Or into the hills, where you can't recharge deep in the woods."
"15 miles per day, not too bad if you commute short distance. And if you're single no kids and don't go out too often on the weekends, that's a free 30 miles back in your car"
Insert Metalball
"I only drive about 10 a day with a few big trips a year to get my total miles to 5,000-6,000. I still get to enjoy the car almost every day with only a “few” thousand miles."
Exactly! Am I the only one who thinks these posts are prime targets for astroturfing?

"Iv watched the reveal, sure it's durable, but so are work horses that are 1/4 of the price


And I'm talking, you can take a diesel or petrol car anywhere in the world and find fuel, and do you know how long it would take to charge that battery off solar?  It takes ages even on 250kw, Which you won't be getting anywhere near on a solar panels that small

Range anxiety afflicts only people who don't own an EV.
"You can absolutely go across Ohio or Texas or any of the plains states. People have done it tons of times. I think you greatly underestimate the charging network in this country, much less Tesla's network. 500 miles is a ton of range. I've never owned a gas vehicle that went much over 400. Besides, have you ever actually driven 400+ miles workout a break? Even with no traffic that's going to be 5.5 hours."
Haha. Keep you sweet sweet Tucson then.

Please explain astroturfing. My google is broken.
"Personally I’m kind of annoyed with how short the episodes are, but that may be me just not being familiar with movie quality in less than 30 minutes. 

I sit down and feel like I’m watching a movie, then it ends. I think they could definitely speed up the story line a bit, but other than that I am anxiously awaiting episode 4."
This is acceptable.
"4R’s and Tacos can usually fit 33’s with a little plastic trim and sometimes a CMC. 35’s generally require the CMC, a lot of plastic trimming, and pulling the wheel well liners."
"The solar panel can do 15miles a day which considering it’d mainly be used to power electronics would be perfect for camping. You can find fuel for electric cars at every petrol station and house in America. Your issue is you can find high speed chargers to which I don’t care because I charge overnight at my house and don’t need a supercharger 99% of the time. One the once a year I do a road trip then I guess I’m at a slight disadvantage because I have to stop to charge, but it isn’t that bad. I’ve timed it on my gas car and in my model 3 and I literally spent the same amount of time traveling on a 14hr trip."
"Sorry, I misread your point as ""gas is expressive because of taxes"", I now see what you mean. Anyway, the number I quoted is the average in taxes across the US.  Diesel is a bit higher, but that is the average gas tax across the US, including federal and state taxes, not including sales tax. In my state (WA) electricity taxes are WAY lower than gas taxes, but it's not the case in other states.

In WA, I pay 10c per KWh, of which 3.873% is taxes, and there is no sales tax on electricity. I use 250Wh/mi, so that is 2.5 cents per mile. In the last ICE car I had (excluding my truck) I did 25mpg average, and at $3.2/gal, that is 13c per mile. Electricity would have to be taxed at 400% for it to be even close to gas.

On the other hand, while gas taxes are higher and that helps pay for infrastructure, gas is also subsidized massively through military expenditure (I'm not cynical but out is reasonable to assume that we would spend much less on the Middle East if there was no oil there). And that is such a high annoying of money that it dwarves all gas taxes.
About market prices, I don't think it is fair to single pour the price of gas as artificial when all high margin goods have an artificial price. Gas prices will likely go down as demand does down, but electricity prices, which are based on cost, will go down as production costs go down (so far renewables have been catching up in price to coal, but we are at the crossover point and there is no reason to believe costs will stop going down just now)."
Economically sure. If you’re out camping it may be a better deal for you. Some people will value it just for the extra range it can give.

"That makes zero sense. 

I can fill up in five minutes just about every 20 miles from Lake Erie to the Southern tip of Florida. Or down to the border with Mexico. 

The only charging stations I know of in Ohio are in the major cities and not actually near a gas station. 

I get I don't have the map. But do you need a map to find a gas station?

And I also understand we are I the early days of charging in the wild. I know it will get better. It's just not yet where it needs to be."
"We drove across country this past summer (Gas vehicle. Will be dropping the hammer on a model 3 soon) and was surprised to see superchargers in some of the most bumf#ck parts of the country. We took the northern route from Michigan to Washington and The only state we didn’t see Superchargers was North Dakota. Granted they weren’t as abundant as gas stations, but still they were definitely less than 400 miles apart."
"I have driven through a full tank many times. 

Tank ranges from 25gal @ 21mpg, to 27gal at 27mpg. And 17gal at 36mpg. 

Driving from Ohio to Florida is a good example. And having to stop every 300 miles over a 1200 mile one way would suck."

Exxon or Ford could have paid someone to write negative or needlessly questioning comments to sow dissent.
"Yeah, I’ve just watched episode 1 and 2. I enjoyed episode 1’s length (38 minutes) way more, compared to the second. But I don’t think Chapter 2 had enough story elements to justify a longer duration, it would have been pretty boring.

But still, I hope they’ll stick to a 35/40-minute length for future episodes. I gotta say I watched all 121 Clone Wars episodes, and they all were 22 minutes long, so I may be more used to shorter durations than others. I hope they’ll make good use of the eight episodes of the first season to build a strong and engaging storyline."
That's why I drive pajeros/monteros.  33's stock all day baby.

"Tesla’s trip computers will literally tell you when and where to charge to reach 99% of destinations. Stop at nearest charging station to you destination. Go into the woods, come out and charge on your way out. It’s rarely an issue as many customers have proven time and time again. 

Also you don’t have to inconvenience yourself charging as often as you think if you just let your car charge while you sleep. 

It’s really a non issue."
"> That makes zero sense.

I own both BEV and ICEV.. I have more range anxiety with my gas vehicle. Makes zero sense, I know!

But hear this out.. I keep my BEV plugged in and so its always a full tank when I need it. My ICEV, I run that thing down low on gas because I hate filling.. its expensive, inconvenient and filthy, so when I need my truck its always nearing empty, giving me anxiety. 

Anyway.. thats my reality. Range anxiety is real for all vehicles and people, and doesn’t just apply to BEV’s."
"Just this weekend I needed to use google maps to find gas stations several times. If I had an electric car I would have been able to charge at the cabin we were staying at and not used a gas station at all. 

I'm also very familiar with driving through Texas as I have done N-S and E-W a couple times each. The range I think you need is 400 mi to be efficient. After 400 miles of driving you need food and a break. I'm not one to say you need to get out of the car and stretch after a 2 hr drive, but after 400 miles you will want to get out for a bit."
"If you look at Plugshare, you can see just how many there really are, especially when you factor in destination chargers and J1772 chargers (typically somewhere between 15-40 miles/hr depending on the particular charger)."
">Tank ranges from 25gal @ 21mpg, to 27gal at 27mpg. And 17gal at 36mpg.

Eeek, drink more liquids my dude, no way you are staying hydrated. Your kidneys will thank me! 

> Driving from Ohio to Florida is a good example. And having to stop every 300 miles over a 1200 mile one way would suck. 

It would take you an extra 1.5-2 hours, and your party would be able to take a pee break, grab a snack, and stretch their legs. Doesnt seem so bad to me. Ive done a similar but not quite as far drive, Northern Indiana to Georgia, and I would not want to do it without stopping again. 

All of that to say, its obviously doable, and you are only looking at extreme edge cases. Maybe you make that type of trip a few times a year, which would be more than most, but it costs you just a few extra hours. You also save a lot of that not filling up throughout the rest of the year."
Into the receptacle.
"3rd gen? I also have 33's (255/80/17) on my '13 and probably could have gotten away with only losing the mudflaps but what little rubbing I had was driving me nuts so I snipped a little plastic. I know some of the guys with 285's have had to trim a bit more and do a CMC, but those dudes are also running their trucks pretty hard so I don't know. Feels like every truck/tire/suspension combo has it's own problem areas."
"Agree, I come from one of those countries. And in some states (e.g. some counties in WA) EVs are already taxed that way (as part of the cars yearly licensing, not per weight though). I think it is premature since we should strongly inventivize the move to EVs, but once End are the default, taxing EVs instead of electricity will make sense (of course, people that use the car very little will complain that they are being asked to subsidize the test, but no option will make everyone happy)."

"Ha, I grew up in the 70's where we only stopped if the station wagon (30 gal tank but only got 15mpg) needed gas. 

I drink plenty of fluids while driving too. Thanks though."
"Yeah, its a 3rd gen. 285 wide too so they must have moved the cab mount cause I'm nowhere near it. All I did was lose the mudflap and the only time it rubs is if I compress the suspension at full steering lock. Not bad but it would be sweet to get factory 35's with no rubbing!"
From what I understand the third gens have a lil more room in the wheel well to work with than the 2nd gens. I love my 2nd gen but if 4th gen Taco's come out someday and can fit 35's from the factory I'd be mighty tempted to sell everything and start my build over.
I'd like to thank the early adopters who made this all possible.  <3
Also Cuphead.
+9001% more stainless steel
I wouldn't jump the gun until we see what they're offering in '22 when the Cybertruck is released. I suspect a tri-motor Model S/X (or even 3/Y) with newer battery tech by that time. They can't announce new features on current models 2 years before launch.
"Autopilot is also standard now, not an option, which it would have been had it been a thing. 

Also I could be wrong, but I think supercharging was an upgrade way back when. (not sure if it was a hardware-there-software-off thing like they do things now, or if they fundamentally couldn't.)"
"This mostly indication an update in battery technology and other models will follow soon.... Perhaps, as early as battery Investors day!!!!"
on pace for 13 seats by the year 2039
I am insanely jealous of the price Americans pay for these vehicles.
99.9% less curves
But the model S is 187% prettier
And yet...nobody else out there can beat the specs on the 2012 S
...but the Cybertruck isn't real at this point
The most awesome thing is that some cars from 2019 and even some cars that are just announced are not close to the tesla specs. A car from 2012. That just tells how good tesla is and that they're the leader in EV's. Maybe not the price but definitely everything else
Think it was only 90kW charging at first.
It's cool how much Tesla has evolved!
‘22 sounds so futuristic
Um what? This is apple and orange. A 2012 S should be compared to a 2020 S.
They still have to deliver.
But early model S had 7 seats
"The bed is useless as designed. To side load, you have to lift whatever it is about 5.5ft up to clear the stupid bed rails.

The interior is also the most overwhelmingly Spartan exercise in brutalist design since the at&t long lines building. It looks extraordinarily cheap and uncomfortable compared to even a fleet spec ram.

Not to mention that these things will be build either in the tent or in the parking lot by criminally underpaid and overworked workers. Don't expect much"
"Afraid of so much power? Problem solved!

#Roof Rack + Y

Thank me later. And us off-roaders can have our Cybertruck =D"
"Shit, it's faster, bigger, heavier **and** ***more*** **efficient** than the OG model S?? Magic I tell ya"
"lol, FSD dropped in at the end there as if it's a minor feature"
"The charge rate gap is even wider than that now.  A few older 85s can still peak at triple digit kW but most can't any more, and all have been throttled to taper dramatically.  Mine was throttled to 40kW charging and the capacity was downgraded to 60kWh with a volt cap (not degradation!) so the old to new comparison looks much better comparing NOW specs instead of just original specs."
Nice comparison
Model S from 2012 still worth it used? Honestly that is probably the only way I could afford one.

"One of them is 100% designed on something I drew in second grade, honestly I hate the look of the truck, but it's still an amazing accomplishment."
So what’s the used car market like for that old model...
what does the part where it says 7.2miles/$1K cost mean?
Not so fast on the FSD
Only trade off is that it looks like an 8 year old with access to his dads cad software designed it

Wait that half/half photo actually looks pretty dope. Tesla Cyber S coming 2024
Looking forward to the next generation of model S comparison!
"Also this is a massive pickup truck, compared to a 4 door sedan. Makes the improvement even more impressive."
"If you're a long term short seller of Tesla, give your brain a check. You need it."
Imagine how many seats we'll be up to in the next 20 years if progress keeps accelerating... 10 seats? 13 seats?!
When I was watching the event live I thought for sure the top spec model would be well over 100k and thought who the hell would spend that much. Jaw dropped when the prices were shown.
And way more sexy
Now I just wish they'd be the same price in CAD PepeHands
"I thought it looked odd initially, but it’s really grown on me over the last week. Elon told us it was going to be something straight out of bladerunner, and that’s exactly what it was. All the free advertising with the memes is such a win too."
I wonder how much of the savings is due to supply chain efficiencies alone?
When was the last time we saw the ICE market compete on PURE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT instead of nicer interiors. Tesla is going to force the rest of the auto industry to get off its ass and compete on technology not marketing.
"I must say, I’ve never wanted a truck before, but I LOVE having a car that’s different than everything else out there, so I kind of want a Cybertruck..."
"I mean, it might have the hardware for full self driving, but it's not gonna be working for another ten years"
"So... what's a ""Tri Motor""?"

"And we haven't even looked at towing lol

Also no adjustable suspension and not armored...

I can't wait to see what we have 10 years later"
Hoping FSD is ready by then.
Can I buy the Cybertruck with the Model S rear? Kinda like the look of that...
"Seems like this is the perfect design to turn into a self driving taxi, don't you think?"
What about energy consumption per mile and per mile per unit of weight?
So when are we gonna get a sub 30k Tesla with 250mi+ range?

"I don’t really see how all these are improvements because of 10 years time. 

The cargo is dumb because it’s a truck they always have cargo space. Same with the seats they usually have 6 seats. The range is always a funny one to me that’s only important because it’s electric. A gas car can go thousands of miles without extended breaks."
Where is my 35k base tesla 3?
Especially considering old auto barely caught up to the 2012 Model S specs.
I hope they have a she redesign by 22
"I'm seeing used Model S vehicles from 2013 for about $25-35k. That wouldn't be too bad, if you could actually keep it running..

Motor, battery and probably charger should probably be covered under an extended drivetrain warranty, for some sort of flat monthly fee. CPOs are sold with only 4 years? Or is that added to the remainder of the initial 8 years? So what happens after 5 years?"
I'm just here to say that the model s can be a seven seater
1000% less pretty
"It's kinda unfair to compare storage space. One is a sedan, the other a truck."
This is amazing
I've always wanted the sedan model
Osborne?
Amazing.
Original 40kwh model s
I got X75D in December 2017 pain 90K. Now X with 100+ more miles cost less or the same if you get FSD. I ordered a truck but it’s scary how much better it could be if I wait another year.

A return to brutalism must be worth something as well.
Is the price adjusted for inflation? If not add that as well.
"That's comparing apple to oranges, should do Model S 2012 v Model S 2019, I'm still impressed but you can't compare a truck with a sedan. Good specs improvements though."
Also 20% longer (making it nigh impossible to own in a European town)
•futuristic look •average look •looks cooler
Nice price
These are false stats wtf
"So like I don't have a license yet but I have a good job, is it irresponsible to preorder the cybertruck"
What was the model S original announcement price? I really don’t think the truck will be that price when it hits production
I though these trucks were supposed to be much cheaper?
"Not a comparison of apples to apples, though I get OP’s point."
"Wasn’t the cybertruck $39,900?"
+20 size
The 280% more storage is a bit of a dumb point to make. It's a pickup truck vs a sedan. It had better have more storage. Apples to oranges that doesn't have anything to do with tech.
Tony Stark doing big things!
Why is there nothing on mileage/kWh?

"I’ve been looking to see this cleanly laid out!

As a related note, comparing even the 2012 S to today’s offerings shows how far ahead Tesla is.

You know Musk has never hit a deadline he's set right?
I too like to make up numbers and call it progress! Look at me I can run 74% faster
"This image sold me on trading in my model 3.

I don't care so much for looks, but the truck is more practical in every way than a model 3, and it's cheaper than my performance 3."
And ugly as fuck!

"I really hope they re-design the look of the truck at some point. It would be pretty cool to have an electric truck, but i need it for truck things, not an art project."

"Typical gamer move: reduce graphics settings for higher performance.

But seriously, these specs could be beat by competition before launch. And that's not a bad thing."
The crazy thing is that most other car companies are still trying to make a car that can compete with the 2012 model S
"I’m dumb, can anyone ELI5 the ‘miles/$1k’ meaning? I can’t work it out in my head, xoxo."
"Actually, the charging rate is 208% not 108% higher...a typo most probably :D"
100% sensationalist bullshit
Haha
"You're forgetting the bunch of poligons they removed and angles they added to the CyberTruck, those weren't available in the original Tesla model S!

Perhaps the S was for smooth. It's like, a special kind of tesla. Every other tesla vehicle will come in low poly"
"This is what scares me. Just like the iPhone moved the cell phone industry so fast that your phone was obsolete in two years, I fear the same thing happening with cars...

My neighbor has a pre-raven model S performance. He paid twice what I paid for my model 3.

I mean, it's still a much worse scenario any day to buy an ICE car, but..."
😊😊
"How many % if comparing sizes? Cybertruck is HUGE, too huge for European roads."
"The model 3 needs to get down to at least 20K, they’ve come a long way. But in order for it to properly compete, it’s just too expensive"
Still looks like a minecraft piece of shit.
"I feel like it slid backwards in aesthetic appeal. The boxy, straight lines just reminds me of old pick-ups. 1970-1988 ish"
100% uglier
"I mean, we are comparing a car that’s out for 10 years, and another vehicle that is still in its prototype phase. We don’t know how many miles / performance Cybertruck will end up having."
"Call me stupid but I don’t want to see how fast a truck does 0-60 or it’s quarter mile time. It’s a truck. That’s not it’s purpose

Nor do I want to see a 3 ton metal box flying that fast on a public road. Physics is physics, stopping that much mass quickly will be hard. Imo Tesla should NOT have made it so quick. Cap it 4-5 secs 0-60 at most but keep the torque because at the end of the day the Torque serves a purpose for a truck. 0-60 does not"
"And 1,000,000,000% uglier"
"Pro tip, that should say 189% range increase. ""89% more"" makes no sense."
"If Tesla just released a normal pickup truck, a ton of people would buy it.

Unfortunately they completely lack the funds to produce said truck people want. So instead, they have essentially a limited edition retarded looking Cyber Truck no one wants to buy."
"I listened to this episode, and this comparison is super misleading. Rob meant it as an indication for the future and this is absolutely not a trend that will continue"
"Can't tell if this is serious. Truck form factor is listed as having 280% more space than a sedan. AWD vehicle is listed as having AWD. 6 seater is listed as having 1 more seat than a 5 seater.

Duh?"
9000% dumber looking.
Electric cars don't age well atm. On the up side at some point even older electric cars will have sufficient enough hardware for many years to come. Compare it to modern PC cpus where you don't feel much difference between a new and a 5-10 year old PC unless you are doing really heavy work .
Let the CJ commence
This is actually pointless and stupid. They are completely different. It is like saying SMART CAR vs Prius.
It costs 1 thousand to charge a tesla???
$1K for every 7.2 miles? I've never had to pay that much on gas for 7 miles.
Can you guys please read about the tesla whistleblower and stop supporting this trash company
"With advancements this quick, it’s almost as if you’re better to wait 10 years with gas and then buy one."
Now compare it to the latest Model 3.
"I paid $72k for my P3D, does that count?"
"This really can't be said enough. Tesla is still in it's infant stage when it comes to manufacturing. They consistently change materials and suppliers in an effort to improve every car coming off the line - and not waiting for the next model-year. Even though I've ridden in several Teslas I continue to congratulate new Tesla owners because I know they are funding a better car for others (including me).  So, yea, thanks you guys- Tesla owes you big!"
"Actually I'd like to bring to attention that this isnt factoring in inflation which is another 19% discount.

Edit: I see some confusion.  Inflation means that dollars today are worth less than dollars ten years ago.  After accounting for compounding inflation etc etc, that means we can expect dollars in 2022 to be worth about 20% less than a dollar in 2012.  Another way of putting it is that one dollar in 2012 is worth about 1.2 dollars in 2022. 

 So an apples to apples comparison is 92.4 in 2012 dollars is worth about 110.8k 2022 dollars.  So its really 69.9k v 110.8k so its about 37% cheaper once you account for inflation."
No need. We enjoyed every minute.
::sigh:: you’re welcome?
"yes, this.  Thank you.  It wouldn’t be possible without you rich people, thank you for taking 

 a “chance” with Tesla.  Btw, I love you."
Thanks the tax payers and US gov for giving tesla millions of dollars on that free market baby
Obviously the make it or break it for most car purchases.   Cuphead is the new cup holder.
Only level 1 :(
Can you explain this joke?
What’s that
"Games would be great in the cybertruck, just jump to the middle seat with a controller."
-- 500% graphic. But I really like the design tho.
"I think the new plaid MS will have trimotor and a big battery upgrade, coming next year I think."
"Completely agree, but I think this more about the progress over the last 10 years. So a new Model S would only enforce the level a progress
edit: spelling"
That would only reinforce the point that Teslas are improving rapidly.
"I had a family member say these will be ""**garbage**"" because of the ""exoskeleton"" which means the cab is fixed. For true off-roading, you need the cab area to be separate from the frame, so that it can move independently from the frame like most other trucks.

How true is this, and how much of a difference does it make to have the cab not be able to move independently of the frame for ""**true off-roading**"" ? How would you respond?"
"Was free, not an add-on...

The Roadster on the other hand is restricted to L2 charging."
Autopilot is a $7k add-on for the cybertruck
"I think the truck will still have the best value. 

The cars and SUVs are sold as luxury cars while the truck is about capability and value."
"There’s a question buried in here - battery size/efficiency.  Gut read is ~double the batteries at half the efficiency due to weight (evidence: twice the charging rate, roughly same range, heavier vehicle)  If it is less than double, great - investor day cheers..."
CyberBus confirmed?!
"But the price is... Without taxes, perhaps?"
Maybe model s w/ new grill. The old grill looks like some kind of bottom feeder fish.
"True. Model S is the sexiest thing on the road. Still. I get a half chub when I see one. Conversely, the first time I saw the Cybertruck, I actually got inverted, you know, an “inny,” but I must admit with time and two beers, its growing on me."
"Hm, I disagree. I think the cybertruck looks significantly better than a 2012 Model S."
"you've misplaced that decimal point, it's not 187.00%, it's 18700% prettier"
the Model S also exists.  odds are the truck details change significantly between launch and today.
"Yeah I know the point of this thread is to show how far they've come in ten years, but mostly I was extremely impressed in realizing what Tesla accomplished all the way back in 2012."
Seems like Tesla is lapping the competition at this point.
"Seriously, when I was looking at other car maker's EV's and they are just sad spec's compared to the 2012, and are still priced pretty high."
Rugby World Cup. 1995. Japan vs New Zealand.
The Ford Mach-e does a pretty good of competing job at both performance and price.
Yeah you really can't beat the no parking sensors premium car...
that's my same thought
But it's real in my ❤️
"> Maybe not the price but definitely everything else

I need a car I can afford, not one that can do 0-60 sub 5 seconds."
"Not really. The Mach E is running at the same range with a quicker 0-60 and quarter mile time while being a lot cheaper than it. And it’s Fords first try. And they Taycan just blows all other EVs that are not hypercars out the water in terms of performance, on its first try. You are going to see GM follow and other manufacturers. Literally in 2-3 years, Tesla will be surpassed. You can mark my words on that."
"When I think '20s, I still think of the 1920s first"
Umm... Why can't fruits be compared?
"I think it makes it even more impressive that 
a large utility vehicle that is somehow considerably cheaper and a better performance vehicle than the older performance car"
The battery and technology is what has evolved.  The exterior is irrelevant.
The point is to measure how far the technology has come since the beginning
Or a 2023 S.
Why can’t apples and oranges be compared?
I think it’s basically just showing a comparison about the offerings based on the years.
"Yeah, this is stupid and mesaures very little. If the Model S was a massive triangular tank, then the comparison would make sense."
"I think you've missed the point.

This comparison is showing that after 10 years, Tesla has released a vehicle that tops every criteria for a significantly lower price."
Came here to mention the optional 2 rear-facing seats in the trunk... surprised how far I had to scroll through the comments to see someone else say it.
On paper.
How do you figure 'more efficient'? We don't know the size of the battery pack in the truck.
"I’ll believe it when I see it. I paid for it, but my car doesn’t FSD yet and they don’t even seem to be pretending it’s right around the corner at this point."
Stop acting like it’s a major feature until it’s actually a thing.
"Wow, i have read about the 40kW charging cap before, but didnt know they capped the capacity to just 60kWh too. That sucks. :/ Were you warned about it somehow or just happened overnight with a new update?

And adding to that, A-type battery packs for S from 2012 were capped to 90kW new. B-type could charge at 120kW rate, but unsure when they were starting to roll off the line."
"Avoid the first few years if you can, there were a bunch of issues that got sorted out later, e.g. battery life, self presenting door handles, motors, etc. If you need a car *now* and a 2012 is the only thing you can afford, then it's not a bad choice, but if you can hold off for a year then do that and buy a 2014."
In 20 years we’ll all have one and it will feel so good to get a nice electric fancy future car. Be patient my friend
There's a reason the pyramids in Egypt are still standing today. Triangles are built to last and they are built tough.
"7.2 miles of range per $1,000 cost of the vehicle. Sorry, that could have been clearer. So 500mi/$69.9k = 7.2mi/$1k cost."
">Didn't Tesla claim the windows were impenetrable

no. no they didn't."
agree on looks
Don't stop the circlejerk! I love Tesla but the echo chamber of this sub can be obnoxious.
Also that the revealed cybertruck is a concept car since the current model breaks several regulations that make it not street legal
"I mean, they built the dual motor version, which we know will sell for $49,900. I'd say that qualifies as ""being built"" and ""knowing the price""."
Thanks for listening!
"Well, you see it had one more motor than the dual motor and 2 more motors than the single!"
"2 on the heine, 1 up front"
Noooo
"500 miles of range / $69.9k cost = 7.2 miles of range per $1,000 spent on the car. I did it in thousands because 500 / $69,900 = .0072 miles of range per dollar spent, which I thought was more confusing. The point is the cost of electric vehicle range has declined significantly."
"Tesla has done a great job improving the value over the years. $92,400 was the original price for the Performance Model S. They actually raised it by $2,500 heading into 2013, too.

[https://www.tesla.com/blog/2013-model-s-price-increase](https://www.tesla.com/blog/2013-model-s-price-increase)"
(500-265)/265 = 89%
"It’s not, but 2012 to 2019 was about 12%. Cybertruck then 32% cheaper."
The single motor is supposed to start at $39.9k. This is the tri-motor version.
"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
We don’t know the Cybertruck pack sizes yet
"Approx Miles per $1000 of the cost of the vehicle. 

Approx...(500 ÷ $70k)*1000"
"Nah, a 100% increase is a doubling. You need to subtract 1 from your math or use (250-120)/120."
"Interesting. How big is the regular truck in Europe? Much smaller than US truck, like F150?"
Wait for the used market
"I think you are conflating quickness (acceleration) for speed (velocity).

Point being, this truck can merge into highway traffic with no problems."
Im not a physicist but isn't 0-60 tied to torque? As in the reason it can accelerate that fast is due to the torque
"You're not stupid, but what does acceleration have to do with speed?  A crash with a truck at 60 mph or more is going to suck, it doesn't matter how quickly it accelerated."
60 mph isn't that fast. It's barely highway speed.
is that you mom?
89% ‘of’ something is much different than saying 89% ‘more’ of something.
TIL .25 million people = no one
"I meant this as a recognition of the incredible progress Tesla has made, and also mentioned that it's exciting to think about what Tesla will achieve over the next decade. I didn't intend to imply that this same trend would continue as there will be diminishing returns over time. But there is still a heck of a lot to be excited about for the next ten years and probably a lot of things we aren't thinking about today."
The point is how far Tesla has come!
It’s describing the ratio of cost of the car versus range of the car.
"Yes! You took one for the planet, my friend."
"I paid 74k for a P3D- 
Do I also count?"
How much was the tax rebate when you paid that?
Right there with you. I did get $5k back though because it was a P3D-
Minus $5k 😉
Yes! You are a hero!
"Haha! Same! Oh well, I might feel salty about the dramatic MSRP drop if it weren’t for the fact that I’m so goddamn in love with this car and this company."
"Wouldn’t inflation make it so they paid 19% more than today’s dollars, though."
Unlike all the subsidies and tax breaks the legacy brands are still getting?
THERE’S LEVELS?
"Tesla cars come with ""Tesla Arcade"" now, which is just a collection of games that can be played on the console using the steering wheel. Most of them are kinda garbage that was thrown together just for the car, but one of the games is ""Cuphead"" which is a (very difficult and fairly critically-acclaimed) platforming game that was originally made for Microsoft platforms but which was licensed for Tesla Arcade.

They're joking that ""Cuphead"" is an additional selling point for Tesla vehicles (the joke being that it is obviously a very minor addition in the context of the price of a car)."
side scrolling hell platformer.
I'm warming to it.
"It makes sense because of the ""Dual Motor"" badging. Consider the Roadster and CyberTruck have a ""Tri-Motor"" design, it means they'll have the key hardware and software functionality worked out. A Tri-Motor Model S/X could do amazing things for power and handling. It just makes sense, especially if they're using the 3/Y ""Raven"" motors to streamline production.

They only reason for pause is that the S/X are ""niche"" and they might not want to put so much effort into them with the Y and CyberTruck on the horizon. It'll come down to priorities."
Plaid model S?? I want polka dots
How close will a Tri Motor model S come to a Roadster?  Especially if they modify other parts of the car too.

"What the hell is true off roading? It sounds like something people made up to specifically say you can’t do it in a cybertruck. In ICE trucks, there is only one frame so I don’t see the distinction.

The main reason is probably so you can just pop on whichever size bed you want during manufacturing. It’s much easier and cheaper to make the cab bodies all the same rather than have to make 3 different cabs and bed altogether. 

But the other reason is to allow for flex under heavy loads."
"Even though ""exoskeleton"" is a cool term, it's really another name for ""unibody."" (EDIT: More specifically a monocoque per /u/StumbleNOLA below.) This is in comparison to ""body-on-frame."" A body-on-frame has two components, a body and a ladder frame. The ladder is there to resist deforming on a typical unibody. A unibody is generally believed to have better handling, more efficiency, and is safer in crashes. It's hardly ""garbage,"" as many excellent vehicles, including the Ford Explorer, are unibody.  There *are* people who believe a body-on-frame is better for hauling and off-roading.

But here's the big difference: The Cybertruck is using a *really* tough stainless-steel alloy for the body. Because of this, Telsa is suggesting *14,000 pounds* of towing capability, which is the highest in its class. How can that be garbage? That's in the range of a Ford F-250, exceeding every F-150 configuration. (I believe the F-150 tops out at 13,200 pounds.)

So, the Cybertruck could have all the handling, efficiency, and safety benefits of a unibody--driving more like a car--while also having the strength for substantial towing. We won't know until its released, but the towing numbers suggest it has the structural integrity to handle ""true off-roading."" It's only a matter of time before more manufacturers move their trucks to unibodies.

EDIT: Just to add, the Cybertruck's body is 3mm thick compared to a typical 1mm, and it has has a design for stiffness that other vehicles can't match. That's why it's so angular.  Basically, they figured out a way to do a pickup in unibody before anyone else. Almost every other car made is a unibody except for pickups. Here's a little more about the subject from Jalopnik:  [https://jalopnik.com/mid-size-trucks-dont-need-frames-1785674405](https://jalopnik.com/mid-size-trucks-dont-need-frames-1785674405) Note how the Cybertruck's design incorporates ""[sail pillars](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/oh5nhch8mwhxneyoeplc.png)"" for rigidity."
"The fact is, it’s too big for “true off roading” eg rock crawling and the like. The wheelbase is too long and I imagine it is too wide. It’ll take rough forest roads and the like with aplomb, though. Note that we are seeing some semi capable off road cars (again, not rock crawling but “overland” appropriate perhaps) that are uni-bodies, like the Land Rover discovery and defender (both of which also have air suspension at least as an option). The fact is, you can customize a body on frame truck a lot easier, and they may theoretically be more rugged, but I expect the cybertruck will be fairly capable within its limits."
"The best way to respond is this: 

Think of the best, highest performing offroad vehicles. They are tube framed, large articulation vehicles, but the articulation is in the suspension only, and the frame is nearly perfectly rigid. The Cybertruck body, is much like this tube frame, but it's edges of flat sheets meeting instead of tubes that form the theoretical bounds of the polyhedron of the body.

Heres a wireframe of the cybertruck to show them so that it clicks better.

https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tesla-cybertruck-657e71b3e2ad468196668e9c9df708fb

A good buggy has way better articulation of course, don't make it seem like you're trying to say the cybertruck is as good as a buggy. It's also worth noting that some buggies actually go for a solid rear axle because it's often easier to accomplish more suspension travel and more articulation in a solid rear axle, but not more ground clearance (well live composite axles with portal hubs are kinda a work around to have high clearance and not have the issue of the independent suspension... but the point is)

The cybertruck will have limited corner to corner articulation. It will also have a bad breakover. It's not ideal for some kinds of offroading, but it's gonna be pretty solid out the door if lockers are an option (Elon said he would try on twitter).

It's still a truck with insane torque, 35"" tires, 16"" clearance, and tuneable suspension, better center of mass, better front/rear weight distribution. 

In some ways it's gonna be fucking great. In some ways it's gonna be limited, and you'll never be able to fix those flaws in this truck.

If Elon wants to shit on every Jeep/Rover/Landcruiser, he could make a shorter SUV optimized for shorter wheel base and even more articulation, but I don't think he'll bother."
"There was a $2,000 charge for supercharging for a while for the S, though I don't know if it applied to this specific car."
"Autopilot is included. FSD is $7,000"
"I think they said autopilot standard, fsd +$7k. Autopilot will give you the essentials on highway, I believe, but I may be wrong.

This goes with their goal of making it the safest car."
The truck is also about badassery. Anyone that thinks they are a baddass will be compelled to order one....   with the steel ball accessory.
"Yes..... so Models S, 3, X for years 2020/2021 could be over 500+ miles!!! While, other car companies are coming out with cars in the 250+ mile range!!!!"
I would think that it needs more batteries for greater continuous current demand for towing etc and other things that nobody will actually do with this car
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EKHc7vrXUAEwLaX?format=jpg
"Yes, not including taxes"
Still vastly cheaper to what we pay.
nurse shark fer sure

"""It's like a little bit like Cheese Louise had a child with a DeLorean. She fucked a DeLorean, and out came the Cybertruck""

"It's a good looking car but I wouldn't go that far, it looks like a pretty standard high end sedan"
I cant wait to see that massive truck looking like an alien space craft and it's whisper quiet.
Agreed.
Well remember the cybertruck doesn't really exist yet
Hopefully they learn how to make money before they go bankrupt
It's so ugly though.
Anything is possible when you draw comparisons between a real product and a concept
CyberWhere?
2012 Tesla’s will be surpassed? I hope so.
"Top end Tesla model s is very comparable to top end taycan, except for price, where it is very much less expensive. Not to mention fsd. Plus, no other company is even going to come close to where Tesla will be in terms of self driving in 2 to 3 years. Other manufacturers will start to catch up, which is good, but Tesla will at least stay a dominant player for a long time imo."
"Car manufacturers know how to make cars, and electronic tech can't stay proprietary forever. Easy enough for Ford to combine its carmaking  skills with tech first perfected by others."
Bitch that phrase don't make no sense why can't fruit be compared?
And [rated](https://www.skytopia.com/project/fruit/fruit.html).
Because a watermelon is guaranteed to have more juice than a cherry.
"look at any technology company, do you think their product from 2012 or 2020 will be better?"
"Part of the reason why it's cheaper is because it has virtually no interior. I can see how some people will buy it for its performance aspect alone, similar to the first WRX that had a very basic interior. I still can't see too many businesses using this for purposes that they would otherwise need a ute/pickup for. I'm happy to be proved wrong on that though."
It’s not meaningful to compare two different classes of vehicle. Compare a truck to a truck or a car to a car.
"I don't understand what it is you don't feel this measures. Curves cost 22 grand?

Pretending we can't see the march of progress here just because one is a pointy truck is silly af."
"Point is, the massive triangular tank is cheaper and has better performance than the sleek sedan that came out just a few years ago. Imagine what they could do with an all-new sleek sedan."
Are they lying? Both these specs are on paper
"Oops, I misread the stat."
It's a thing
Not sure what you guys are referring to... you're saying old tesla systems are being downgraded via update? Wat?

Link or DM to Podcast ?! I would love to sub.
Why?
"Oh ok, i was comparing it to my 6.9 klm per litre $1.52 (Australia) and thinking thats the most expensive car to run, 
My mistake. I'm onto the podcast now, Thanks."
Thank you! That's what I thought I heard
Thanks dude
europeans don't really have pickup trucks. they just use vans
[us in Europe drive these things](https://images.app.goo.gl/pmAZigCksbAKwBcp7)
"Power. Torque is how hard the wheels turn, power is that times the rate they’re turning. 

You could have tons of torque with slow moving wheels and have a slow 0-60 time."
"The hardware allows it due to torque, but with the software, they were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."
"Because if people have the option, it only takes 1 imbecile to keep doing launches until they lose control. Just like with 18 wheelers, if 1 of those drivers drive like an idiot, the government mandates new law changes against all 18 wheel drivers such as the case here in Australia. 

The massive weight and size of those vehicles means just 1 accident can cause massive damage therefore you have to be more responsible and even err on the safe side as a company. 

I totally understand this is a very unpopular opinion as it essentially is advocating a cap on the acceleration ability of prospective owners and that feels like you’re being to what to do and what not to do, but I say this only out of concern for safety"
"""89% of"" makes sense. A percent ""more"" makes no sense it if is less than 100% of the number in question. If the first range was 100 km, doing the math you would say 100 km * 1.89 = 189 km, a 189% increase. 100 * .89 is only 89%."
"That’s not super impressive. Those aren’t purchased vehicles, those are pre-orders. The Model 3 had more pre-orders and the deposit was $1,000 at the time. Cybertruck has a $100 refundable deposit. There’s really no commitment and I’m sure people will cancel. Really should only count it as a success when there are hard sales numbers."
" Who the fuck says .25 Million?

You mean 250,000?

Might as well be no one. Thats a complete and utter failure for a product launch like a vehicle."
an additional seat! great how far they come.
"That makes no sense

Edit: I'm dumb, it kinda makes sense"
"Yup, saving the world over here through his conspicuous consumption"
"You didn't really pay that though.  I ""paid"" $76,000 for my P3D, but I also got $12,500 back, so I really paid $63,500 (plus a bit of tax) despite what the MVPA said."
"I got my car during the 7500 tax *credit*, but I wasn’t able to take advantage of it at all because I didn’t owe $7500 in taxes :/"
I didn't get the  $5k rebate. Believe me I wish I had gotten the P3D- I originally ordered. $67k otd and then AP/FSD for $5k more later.
"No, that 90k on the model S would be ~100,000 somthing in today's dollars."
Nothing unlike it. Glad to see you agree its fucked up.
Only island 1 is included.
Thank you Peter
Hell is an understatement
You guys are insane. It’s butt ugly
"Like you said, they've probably got the tech just laying around, not doing anything atm, why not just cram it into the S and see what happens.
   
Even though it will never be as popular as it once was."
"They are only niche because of the cost. If they redesign to streamline manufacturing like in the 3 and use less exclusive battery tech, they could shave $10-20K off the price, making it only $10K above the comparable Model 3/Y. At that point they stop being niche.
It's just priorities that prevent them from doing it now, but once they have the new platform, FSD is out and the Y is in full swing, that is the next big thing for them. I'd say two or three years."
"Keep in mind that Elon is vocally against large batteries that are unnecessary. He's cell starved pretty much permanently until there is some massive revolution in battery production, likely that he's responsible for, and as soon as he has more cells, there's a shit load of things he can put cells in that he's probably not telling us about because he doesn't have cells for the ideas.

He's outright said he wont go much higher on the S and X, it might be only related to the current models, and he'll change that when the trimotors hit, but the S already goes nearly 400 miles, why would he go significantly beyond that?

Putting a 200kwh+ battery pack in the truck is not unnecessary though, because it needs to have the ability to sac 2/3 of the range and still get to super chargers, and also have the amperage in the pack that allows it to charge at half a Megawatt so that people can give up the shitty argument that the reason they need to burn fuel is that they can't spend 1/4 of the time charging a vehicle on the rare occasion they actually engage in long distance towing. Same with the Roadster, it's partially the need for bravado and it's partially the amperage capacity.

"Well you have some correct conclusions but you are fundamentally wrong. The Cybertruck is not a unibody it is a monocoque. About as different from a unibody as a unibody is from a ladder and frame. 

To the best of my knowledge the only vehicles that have used this type of construction so far have been a few F1 race cars and some military armored personal carriers. So at this point there just isn’t enough information to really know how it will respond. 

I don’t think anything will ever beat a ladder for pure towing capability. Because it centers all the strength at the tow hitch, but for anything other than 30,000lbs towing it may not matter."
"This is a valid point. It's more a function of the size than the structural integrity that OP's family seems to be mocking. They seem to think a unibody can't be as rigid, but I believe the design and materials of the CyberTruck have made it possible."

The only variable being if i trade the diesel in inside 10 years for a jeep style vehicle that’s all electric.  the cybertruck really couldn’t need much but a battery swap before I’m too old to care about driving and I turn 40 next year."

Vs the Cybertruck?
exactly.
A Taycan is a Porsche first and an EV second. A Tesla interior looks like a 3rd grader designed it compared to an eTron/Taycan.
Chevy’s self driving LIDAR system is already more developed and reliable than Teslas FSD system. The FSD is not even capable with its current hardware. Other manufacturers are serious players. They will quickly optimize their batteries. EV drive systems are a lot simpler than ICE systems.  2-3 years other manufacturers will pass Tesla.
The thing is Electric Tech is everywhere. Tesla doesn’t even develop their own batteries but rely on 3rd party for development and supply. The battery is the main challenge. Tesla has an efficient motor that they make in house. That’s their advantage. This can be surpassed when auto manufacturers start investing time in their R&D space to better improve on their efficiency.

"No, 89% of 100 km means 100km * 0.89 = 89 km, 89% increase means 100km * (1.00+0.89) = 189 km. ""Increase"" includes the 100% already present in the multiplication, ""of"" does not. Therefore OP was right to say 500+ is 89% more than 265, because 265 * 1.89 = 500+. A 189% increase would mean 265 * (1.00 + 1.89) = 765.85.

Simply put, the 265 km from before increased by 235 km, which is 89% of 265 km, therefore the range increased by 89%."

> To the best of my knowledge the only vehicles that have used this type of construction so far have been a few F1 race cars and some military armored personal carriers. So at this point there

Not that it was a real vehicle in terms of actually being produced and all, but I think the Aptera was kinda a monocoque with metal tube frame and composite skin. I mean I guess it's a semimonocoque in that case, wheras the Cybertruck is a true mono?

This design is actually much better for towing. You want rigidity for towing, and you can't get more rigid than this. You also want a low center of mass, and you want the center to be between the two wheels nice and squarely. The Cybertruck will be superior as a bumper pull rig compare to a similarly weighted steel frame truck... maybe the aluminum frame in the new F series will do a lot better with rigidity, but it's gonna suffer real hard in terms of long term structural integrity, cause aluminum builds up microfractures, and I'm pretty sure 301 ain't gonna the same way.

If you didn't care about the aero loss, you could make a monocoque that would accept a 5th wheel with full turning radius, but you'd be better off modifying the trailer to fit the truck than modifying the truck to match the trailer shape. You just need to have a higher bit above the bed, and you need to slope upwards from the hitch towards the side, so that when you turn 100 to 110 degrees, you don't have a truck trailer impact.

Pretty sure if you're looking at a 7500 pound truck with a gvwr of 10500, like an F350 diesel towing package would be, even a dually, the ideal shape is going to basically be a cybertruck, just flare out the ass for the dually axle. You get more rigidity and more durability and better force distribution for the weight every single time. That's why all the offroad tube frames look more or less like the vertexes of the cybertruck would look rendered into tubes. This will never not be ture. Any improvement in materials that lets you make a traditional truck frame that performs as well as the monocoque does, would be better put to use in a monocoque, or at least a semi monocoque."
"Yeah, I thought I was clearer that the exterior was the reason for the structural stiffness, specifically calling out the stainless steel alloy and 3mm thickness. Correct me if I'm mistaken, but isn't a monocoque is basically a type of unibody that relies on the outer skin for structural integrity? For the sake of this discussion, I was addressing the common belief is that (possibly until now), heavy pickups required a cab-on-frame."
"Because the hardware necessary to supercharger wasn't standard, it was extra."
"I recently looked up the comparison because my mother got a model x and wasn’t sure about FSD or not.  Autopilot has all of the active safety features you might be thinking of.  Lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, front impact automatic braking, etc.  The kind of stuff that makes a ton of sense to just include in base mode cars, as these are major safety improvements.

FSD has a few other features now, like summoning the car.  Also the “navigate on autopilot” which is currently in beta but in years to come would be the point to point self driving system.

Autopilot is basically Tesla’s fantastic version of all the driver assist safety tools like in other automakers.  Comes standard now (Toyota does this too).  FSD is taking it to the next level where the car starts actively driving itself, with more features promised in the future."
"Within a few years of FSD availability, I predict it will no longer make financial sense to own a personal vehicle unless you live in a remote location.  Cars (and trucks) today spend over 90% of their lives parked.  When that changes, we’ll have more vehicles than we know what to do with."

"That's incorrect. A 189% increase means beside the original 100%, there is an additional 89 units on top. The working definition of percent means it doesn't make sense to say a less value than 100 % more. 89% more is incorrect."
"You can think I'm dumb all you want. ""89% more"" doesn't make any mathematical sense. If the range was 100km, but now it's 189km, that's an increase of 189%, because you're multiplying the original figure by 1 (itself) .89 (the additional range). The range is an increase on top of what it already was. That's how percent works."

I get less “cyber” vibes than “shed” vibes from it. I dunno... I would expect something called the Cybertruck to be a little more space age looking. This to me looks more like a soapbox racer!
You sure that opinion will last 2 years?
"Yeah. Thinking this car actually looks good is a shit opinion.
I’m honestly wondering if the people that say they like it are just joking..."
"A unibody uses an internal skeleton to which the body is attached as an aerodynamic shell. The individual ‘bones’ are glued bolted and welded together but they are designed to be light weight. 

A pure monocoque doesn’t have internal framing at all. Everything inside the shell is empty space. We use them a lot in small boats where you desperately need as much internal volume as you can scavenge. 

It can provide a lot of general stiffness, but not as much strength. Which is why when towing massive loads a ladder will always be king. For truly big loads you can almost ignore the rest of the vehicle loads. Because if stuff if beefy enough to handle the tow load it almost necessarily will meet the general loads (I’m not a vehicle designer but we have a number of these rules in marine engineering). 

There are downsides, like if you want complicated shapes it can cost a fortune. And the skins add a lot of weight because you can’t modify plate thickness to match loads, you are stuck with the same thickness everywhere."
"Thanks for the info. Sounds pretty sweet, though sounds like a bit of a gamble. Fully autonomous in two years? Do you get a refund if it's not working yet?"
"I planned for this actually. I bought a sizable piece of rugged land in San Diego county on which I’ll be building a shipping container home on.   Probably end of next year. The well has already been tapped. Water capture, grey water discharge, incredibly well insulated, all electric appliances etc plus enough enough solar and storage to never bring the grid to that location.   I checked into it just in case and I’ll save $70k by staying off grid plus i lower the risk of fire danger to my property and I’ll never have to pay any grid “connection fees” for (hopefully) 30+ years. Two car chargers in the mix.  

I’ve got a good friend that has made it over three years in Tuscon, AZ on just water capture alone so i know it can happen. Goats chickens etc plus a myriad of wildlife.  just far enough away from light pollution to really see the stars and just close enough to catch the sunset over the water for part of the year.

for my particular use case I likely couldn’t pull it off without owning my own transportation. the road the land is on requires high clearance and whenever it does rain, requires good four wheel drive. It’s also just high enough that a small dusting of snow once or twice a year isn’t out of the question.  I’m not sure I’d ever trust an autopilot anything to come scoop me up haha"
We kinda already have more vehicles than we know what to do with.
The problem with that theory is that those same 90% of vehicles are going to work at the same time.
"Well, if you’re trying to minimize degradation by keeping SoC between 20% and 80% then you’re left with 60% of the range on an everyday basis."
"There are so many major factors that hinder range below the official rating. 

* degradation - I’m already at 215 max with 2k miles total; *edit: now 213, this seems to change by the day*
* daily recommended limit to stay between 10%-90%, that brings down 215 to 172. 
* speed, like you said. Yes, I speed, and yes, I use climate control. I also have 19” wheels.  My 55 mile round trip freeway commute averages about “80 miles” in used range. That’s about another 30% penalty, bringing 172 down to 130. 
* if I use sentry mode that’s another 10 miles a day
* when it’s cold out later this winter, things get even worse 

I love the car, and it does handle my commute great, but let’s not pretend the range estimate is anywhere close to reality. Gas cars suffer practically none of the range hits Teslas do —you can use the heat all you want without penalty."
"Yeah but it still looks like a 4 year olds drawing. The fact that it doesn’t try to look good doesn’t make it magically look different. If I had to drive one, performance, price, and interior equal (which it isn’t), I’m picking the E. The only problem with the E is the Mustang badging."

Great question btw and one I’ve already asked myself. It’s not growing on me at all but you never know. All I can think is Aztec when I look at it.
"That’s.. not what I meant...

Opinions exist. And they’re subjective for a reason. I believe it is like nothing out there that exists and it looks really good for what they were going for. It’s nothing like what is out there now. It isn’t supposed to look normal. And I like it. Not joking. Now I wouldn’t get it most likely, but that is because I prefer more Model 3 style and sized cars."
"I appreciate the insight. Do we know if the CyberTruck is 100% monocoque, though? I’m curious if all of the structural strength is truly the skin or if it has any internal ‘bones.’

What would you call it if it derived strength from both an internal frame and external skin?"
"It’s a gamble for sure.  You do not get a refund.  You’re basically paying a cheaper price now for hopefully getting features later.  I don’t personally think it’s worth it, especially because you can pay to upgrade at any time.  But to each his own."
Word.
"> you can use the heat all you want without penalty.

Not true though. It's gotten a lot better in recent years but using the heater requires a little bit of power and basically takes heat from your engine bay and gives it to your cabin. Cooling the air takes a lot more energy, because most cars have an A/C compressor which usually is connected directly to the engine through a belt. Running the A/C in my 94 Corolla used to drop me from about 35 mpg to just over 30 mpg."
"* The daily recommended limit doesn't bring down your max range. If you need maximum range, you use maximum range.
* Speed, climate control, and 19"" wheels also all reduce ICE range. Try getting EPA mileage with those factors in place.
* You get to use a Sentry mode which doesn't even exist in other cars.

Winter and degradation? Fine. But that's all painting a picture that isn't comparing apples to apples in terms of real-world range compared to combustion engine vehicles."
"Yikes, that's more recent than i thought.

So it seems like consumer sentiment is that this wasn't an appropriate/legitimate response.

My take from the article it seems like a good thing,  then again it had no affect on me."
"""Percent increase"" is a bad way of putting it, because the working definition of percent is per 100, or of 100. All you need to do is say, if profits were normally $1000, but now they're $2000, then profits are at 200%. I have a feeling this came from math people not understanding the use of english in this case."
Haha negative. Prior military
If you live off a Roth IRA there is no tax.  Military personnel can also get a substantial amount of their income tax free
Get a good accountant you’d be amazed how little you actually have to pay if a professional actually looks at your case. My boss told me due to his accountant he pays taxes equivalent to three months a year. And I make little enough I pay none. In fact last year they gave me a credit for 1000 more than I payed in. Didn’t understand it when they explained it to me but they found me money somewhere. Something with making low enough money and taking college classes while working the government gives me more than I payed.
"Aside from Roth income which was mentioned, another way around federal taxes is capital gains.  You can get around $40-50k/yr in tax-free income using long term capital gains plus deductions/etc if you're single, and more if you're married.  After that the tax rate goes up to 10-15% or whatever it is these days.

Granted, a lot of people who live off of investment income spend a LOT more money and thus pay a ton of taxes.  However, if you save a lot of money but spend it frugally you can pay very little in taxes.

Indeed, if you keep your income in that general range you can get near-free ACA insurance premiums as well..."

Republicans don’t have to pay tax remember
I don’t think Maury Povich works that way.
" I was so repulsed by it when I first saw it, I was like ""OK so it's a joke, where's the fucking real truck, and then when I realized he was serious, I was like mad at him. ""Elon you mother fucker, why did you shit on this opportunity with a fucking JOKE?"" I'm like still unsure about it from a visual aesthetics angle... but from an engineering perspective... the more I look into detail, the more I look into choices they made, the more I'm convinced it's perfect.

I'm kinda resentful of the visual side still, but you could hardly change a single thing on this truck without getting a massive hit in optimization."
Do you really want a self driving EV for it's looks?
"I can’t think of anything that is a pure monocoque. It’s just too tempting to add a reinforcing bar somewhere and other than a welding bead it doesn’t cost much. 

Obviously no one outside Tesla knows what we are talking about here, and trying to extrapolate detail from a short presentation is fraught with inaccuracies, but I suspect there are between 2 and 4 reinforcing bars buried under the skin. But I also am willing to bet they are of secondary importance. 

The easiest to predict is a bar running under the skin across the roof peak. It’s a heavily loaded area, with lots of racking loads, and while 3mm plate is pretty strong, adding a 1”x1” triangle to the underside would add an order of magnitude (I did not run the numbers) more stiffness for 160” of weld bead and probably $20 in parts."
"I consider my daily limit very relevant to my daily usage. I’m not going to max charge every day, I’m talking about my commute here. 

And the impact of speed is very legitimate, much more so for ev than ICE. Again, this is my commute, freeway cruising along with traffic, not racing.  My last ice car got significantly better highway mileage than the overall EPA average. All ICE cars do. My last car cruised at 35mpg, and my Tesla cruises —well it’s much better than 35mpge, but still at a 30% penalty to the stated range. It’s just the nature of EVs. They do worse on the freeway than their stated overall mileage, and the opposite is true for ICE.  ICE cars get their best mileage on the freeway, and Tesla’s don’t. 

Factor in the very significant effects of both winter and degradation and I could be approaching a time in the future where 55 miles is more than my car can handle on a daily basis, which is amazing. All those factors adding up to make a 220 mile car struggle to go 55."
"It's not just consumer sentiment.  It's federally illegal on many levels.  The NHTSA fines will be in the hundreds of millions, and t he repair bills will be tens of thousands per car.  They can't legally downgrade anyone, so all downgraded cars either get the caps removed or get new batteries if it is not safe to remove the cap.  And if it's not safe, that adds to the criminal fines.

It would have been a good thing if this had been part of a declared safety recall process.  Tesla had 5 days to notify the NHTSA - it's going on 7 months overdue, and an  investigation into criminal conspiracy to conceal the recall has already started.  This is extraordinarily bad now.  Hopefully nobody dies in a car that wasn't updated (because now updates are seen as bad,  they cripple cars and should be avoided and thousands of cars are intentionally not updating) before an actual recall is sent out."
Quit throwing around numbers like the you've ever been able to do math
"You're confusing percent change with total. If profits are normally $1000 but are now $2000, that's a 100% increase in profit. A 200% increase would be $3000 etc. The equation for % change is ((NN-ON)/ON)*100.  So ((2000-1000)/1000)*100 = 100%. If I sold 36 units last year of a widget and 54 this year, that's an increase of 50% or 1.5 times more. In this case you'd say that's 150%, but it's still a 50% increase."

"You literally pay tax on a Roth IRA, that's the first thing you pay since the contributions are post tax."
In which state can one get near-free ACA premiums with a $40-50k/yr income?
"My wife, who knew I was going to get one, lol’ed when I showed her the picture and literally thought it was a joke. When I told her it wasn’t she said “well I guess your not getting that one”. 

I’m pretty convinced that a bunch of the pre-orders are people doing it just to say they did it. It’s a 100 bucks which is basically nothing. 

I agree with the engineering but I can’t get past it being ugly as hell. It looks freaking ridiculous."
I do. I enjoy the aesthetics of a vehicle. I want the full package.
">All those factors adding up to make a 220 mile car struggle to go 55.

This is very misleading and really just plain incorrect. You could get 55 miles to a charge if you drive 100+mph with the heat on in subzero temperatures straight uphill... but that isn't fair at all, is it? I could get 50 miles to a gas tank in a car by doing that too."
Maybe you should reconsider your use of words before trying to insult me with them. lol
"K but I'm saying, like you just said, ""...or 1.5 times more"" - that ""1.5"" = 150%. Decimals and percent are related in that way."
"To caveat off this, they're typically 9 months these days."
"Roth distributions are not taxed though, nor are any capital gains from them."
"The cap on subsidies is 400% of the FPL.  For 1 person that is about $48k/yr.  It goes up if you have dependents.  I believe this applies in all states.  As I understand it there is a benefits cliff at 400% so anybody doing this needs to exercise care not to incur additional taxable income (which could be from anything from bank interest or some kind of misc payment or even a hobby).

I forget if this is AGI or gross income.  If you can apply the standard deduction that obviously gets you more headroom.

Most of this stuff can be found on Financial Independence / Early Retirement (FI/RE) forums/etc.  If you can be satisfied with a modest passive income there are a lot of ways to greatly minimize your taxes by controlling when income is realized."
"It sho do.

I think it will grow on people. When you first see it, you are gonna have to  recoil. Like no way you can't recoil from how fucking awful it is. but once it's been all around you for a while, you're gonna get desensitized and then you're gonna want the utility value, and then like Stockholm syndrome..."
"And really, the other Tesla vehicles look pretty sleek, model Y is not my favorite though."
"The point you’re missing is that 55 should never be remotely anywhere close to my daily limit. 

But it might be, in my real future, when all the following not-extreme scenarios align:

* after 10 years of degradation 
* on a cold day
* if I want to stay between 10-90%
* driving mostly freeway speed with normal climate control

That’s not misleading, that is the truth."
"Says the guy who was clearly held back numerous times, or more likely, homeschooled by an equally stupid parent"
I said YOU would say it's 150%. It's not. It's a 50% increase. 1.5 times more IS a 50% increase.
"Only the Army. Navy runs longer, doesn't it? Even more so if you're one of those poor sardines on a sub.  Or is it only the submariners who get fuckered on time?"
Are they down to nine months? Most were a year plus when I was still active. Marines and navy had shortest deployments at 7.
"Thank you for explaining that, I sure needed it."
They do. And one concept I saw of the truck I was like hell yeah!  Not this thing though.
What? I went to public school and got nearly straight As.
1.5 times more is a 150% increase. A 50% increase is an oxymoron. 50% = half. A half increase? 150% is a one-and-a-half increase.
It’s the tube boys that get fucked. When I was active all my deployments were seven. I was navy stationed with marines and 7 was the norm. Some more some less. But 7 was standard.
"I know with few exceptions, since around 13ish it's been 9mo. I did 12ish in OEF11/12"
Yeah many of the concepts had a better look
No need to lie
Dude. You just need to accept that you don't understand the concept here and move along. A 50% increase is an increase of 50% of the original amount. In the case of 36 widgets  that would be 18 units for a total of 54. A 150% increase of $1000 would be $2500.
Makes sense then. I’ve been out since ‘11. Guess I’ll take my foot out of my mouth now.
"No thanks, I'll defend my position. It's not like we're fighting, or angry, right? If you disagree you can feel free to move along. I'm just saying. 1.5 = 150%. It's the original whole (1) plus an additional amount. An increase of half (50%) doesn't make sense."
It must really drive you crazy when a company like Walmart reports a 1.5% or 1.63% earnings increase for a quarter then. They would love to have a 101.5% increase.
"This is a clear violation of Rule 1, but we're going to let slide. Please don't take this as some kind of precedent and flood the sub with sentry videos."

This is the Tesla sub. What did you expect? Some people are weird.
"Here's what happens when we allow sentry mode videos:

Someone posts one, then the reddit brigade shows up and says a lot of extremely hateful, racist, political or other nasty things and we have to ban a bunch of people for Rule 4. It happens Every Single Time. It's a lot of mod effort, it gets a lot of people in trouble and it accomplishes absolutely nothing. It almost immediately turns into a downward spiral, so we have found it is better for everyone if we leave the prosecuting of criminals to the police instead of letting redditors play hate roulette or form their own Scooby Doo gang to track down the perpetrator. 

It's a ""dumb rule"" that we spent months discussing and debating to try to find the best balance for. We don't make this stuff up for nothing."

A religion IS a successful cult. Just think how they shun you or even legitimise your murder if you leave it. Think how children are brainwashed into believing it and most of them never leave. Most religious people didn't choose their religion and didn't study other religions.
"Cult plus time equals religion.

All of them religions were cults at some point.

"I fully agree with that. If I'd saw it on some other subs, I would think the same. This is just a dude sharing a video of someone doing something weird on their dashcam. I have no reason to think this is a ad in any way. The account is active on multiple subs, albeit most of his comments are about Tesla, but he isn't always positive. I scrolled back a random amount of Tesla posts, and found this from him: https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cqkalt/8_battery_degradation_since_june_awd_model_3/ewx68qt?context=3

"Actually, that's exactly the rule over at r/TeslaLounge

It's not that you can't post it, it's that you can't post it here."
"I feel like this is more harsh than it should be.  He's just being more direct about the general approach.  We obviously have to be careful how we 'do business' so to speak, and I know from working with him for years that he means no ill will.  We have a lot of insight into how users handle different threads (even beyond what you see) and he's just being straight with you.  I personally put on a more 'official' look at times, [example](https://nm.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dug6i2/yet_another_road_rage_incident/f77v2fz/), where I take emotion out of the equation, but I can tell you he cares about making this place better overall.  So, I felt it was important to speak up.

I agree, maybe we could be more specific about which videos are allowed and which aren't, but we also have to be careful about being impartial, because we *will* be accused of something one way or another, and I think it's important to have a bit of empathy while we continually to make this place awesome.  I think his comment was stark, but I honestly feel like it's not a good representation of who he is, and I feel it's important to make that clear from me."
"It's a lot less about attitude and more about the track record of every previous sentry video post. People get mean and start breaking rules and so on. Nobody's ""calling"" you anything, we're just direction that kind of traffic toward more appropriate places.

"It's two-fold. 

More users get banned per-thread for hate speech in a Teslacam thread than any other. Every time a car keying sentry video was posted we'd end up banning several people for saying some horrible things that don't belong in civilized discourse (See Rule 4) or offering to attempt to hunt down and injure that person. We didn't want that kind of behavior on our conscience. If someone wound up hurt or killed and I could have prevented it by clicking ""Delete"" one time, I'd feel awful.

Also, r/TeslaCam exists and r/Dashcam exists and those videos are not against the rules in r/TeslaLounge (unless they contain evidence of a crime.) With those three options available, we felt that there were other avenues people could use to see that kind of content if that's what they're into.

With both of those factors in play, we all agreed (after hours of discussion) that it was best to rule out that kind of content from this sub to make our jobs easier, to keep from having to ban people and to keep content sorted into more appropriate subdivisions so people can find what they're most interested  in on a given day."

The sad thing about the glass demo is they didn't have to do it.  The off-truck ball drop made the point.  Should have quit while they were ahead.  Then Elon had to finish his talk in front of shattered glass.  I felt so bad for him.
this is in response to everyone keying teslas
when you’re in the audience for these events please shut the fuck up
He ha to do this whole thing with the windows broken behind him.  Every picture tomorrow will have these broken windows.  This is a serious fuck up
Lmao is the entire crowd mic'd
"Fuck it, we’ll do it live - Elon, probably"
"Much much more optimistic and in depth write-up from Motortrend [With pre-reveal information](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/cybertruck/2021/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info/) , on road photos, and information from pre-production from Tesla themselves.

Shows close-up high res photos of [Bed light, rear storage box etc.](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/cybertruck/2021/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info/)


Edit: More info on powertrain-


“What would be running was turning out to be quite interesting: A motor at each axle, Tesla's new Raven permanent-magnet drive units, to be precise. Up front sat a Model 3 Performance's rear motor; in back, a well-protected Model S Performance's rear motor.
Tesla doesn't publish horsepower figures anymore, but we estimate up to 690 hp and 824 lb-ft of torque combined from the twin motors in the Raven powertrain. 

The future three-motor Plaid powertrain will certainly find its way into the Cybertruck, and it could put out an estimated 800 hp and 1000 lb-ft of torque. Like all Teslas, the Cybertruck's motors are backed by a one-speed automatic. Feeding the motors is Tesla's ""latest"" battery technology, of which the company has shared little. The standard battery pack is mounted underneath the cab, just forward of the roll-up tonneau cover's storage compartment (beneath the pickup bed floor), and offers up about 300 miles of claimed range. A new, double-stacked battery will give the Cybertruck up to 450 miles of range, Tesla says. Construction of the prototype is ""unibody-on-frame"" in the same vein as the new Land Rover Defender, but the production Cybertruck will be pure unibody.”"
The media is gonna love this broken glass demonstration.
"Elon was happy at the start.

Then the windows broke and you can tell his mood immediately went sour with his obvious awkwardness and lost of enthusiasm in the presentation.

And you can feel the crowd trying to cheer him up and cut through the tense atmosphere for him."
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
"Ok so if the glass is that strong, how the hell are you supposed to escape in a freak accident like rising water?  Someone leaves a kid in the car? Emergency personnel need to extract an injured person quickly?"
[Maintenance crew seen carrying replacement windows to fix broken glass on cybertruck](https://twitter.com/Abstract_Ocean/status/1197741547090935810)
"Elon be like... we got Starlink, rockets that land and.... A FUCKING ISOSCELES TRIANGLE ON WHEELS"
"It’s already grown on me since the reveal, but I do worry it will be too polarizing to be mainstream, which is what you need the truck to be. 

Ah fuck it. I welcome our cybertruck overlord."
The audience at Tesla events is always next level cringy.
The worst part of this is that all of the press shots are going to show Elon in front of a ~~truck~~ pile of sheet metal with two broken windows.
"Test Ride video:  
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKX7mwWnygE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKX7mwWnygE)"
THEY FAILED THE GLASS TEST TWICE
That tailgate looked heavy as hell to lift up for that guy.
"Everyone seems mad about it, but this is exactly what he said it would be."
"Elon just learned how clamping forces change natural frequencies. You'll notice looking back, the stage hands were reclamping the glass sample after each demonstration. The windows just aren't supported as well in the door frames.

I think he was so upset he cut it short. We never got to see the interior."
"Not the first Windows to break during a launch presentation. 

https://youtu.be/IW7Rqwwth84"
"Man, I gotta give Tesla props for truly risking something with this design. It certainly is not something that any other automaker on the planet would have attempted! The specs are all pretty much perfect and where they should be, very interesting price range too!

But man, the looks... I gotta say that I am not sure if this one will grow on me over time, but the first impression is a big yikes. Although it does look futuristic and like it has been ripped out of a sci-fi movie and that alone gives it a certain coolness I guess. I am kind of torn on this.

That being said, I want to emphasize again how awesome it is that a company actually risks something with their design and doesn´t play it safe. That alone has to be respected.

IF I had to choose between this and the Rivian though, it´s not even a question. It´s Rivian all the way. Overall I personally would have preferred a more ""classic"" Tesla design with some beefy offroad elements.

Quite curious how the market will react to this though! Unfortunately I can´t see this one being sold in great numbers, it´s just too extravagant for that or maybe too far ahead of its time."
Tesla created a stainless steel Pontiac Aztek. For shits sake.
“Oh my fucking god”
"I can't believe it. Even if you like the truck, the window thing was just unbelievable."
One hour left! One hour until we get to stop seeing the horrible concepts!
"There's morse code hidden in the teaser image that Tesla just emailed out for the livestream!

https://imgur.com/a/dCTi45p

I typed those dots and dashes into a morse code translator and whaddya know, I got this:

ENHANCE"
That glass being broke is still so awkward
"Me be like: good luck keying this one, you motherf***ers"
Haha last night I didn’t understand what Elon mumbled when Fran broke the glass. Just replayed it and he mumbled Oh my fucking god haha
OMG the cracked windows. Wtf lol
#Harrison Ford spotted at the event!
"They REALLY need to get better at presentations.

1. Don’t break windows on stage. We had that experience 20 years ago.


2. Don’t hit the car with stuff. Show videos if you must. 


3. Silence the crowd."

Public Speaking is my #1 fear.  Watching Elon Present is my #1 nightmare
Elon’s really presenting a car with shattered windows. Oh god. Make it stop.
This is the first vehicle that actually looks futuristic. Im not a truck guy so I know most folks hate it BUT I FCKING LOVE IT
Bro what is going on
"Weird thing, I hate it and I love it."
HOW MUCH IS THE ATV?

"1- appearance is, weird, I can’t even say if I like it or not. But more toward don’t like it. Definitely manly though, but I don’t know if it will appeal to regular truck crowd. 

2- was expecting a bigger space under the bed cover, perhaps a full sized SUV variant but this doesn’t work well

3- no side mirrors, I thought that was illegal in the  US or did that change ?

4- armored outside is interesting, really cool if you are hard on your truck. 

5- range 500+ is a big win in my opinion. But should have mentioned the range with towing load as well. It could be a big weak point if that is much lower 

6- would liked to have seen better interior description

7- Armored exterior is cool, but does it allow for crumple zones?  That is an important safety feature

Edit: am I the only one who thinks this look a Lamborghini/Humvee hybrid . I still feel weird about the look, but I think it is starting to sink in."
I need more details on this ATV lol
"“Yeah instead of having it tow something to the stage we gotta throw steel balls at it”

Someone at Tesla probably"
"I went up extra early (5 am in Sweden) to see a futuristic truck drop of a couple of matrix-dressed villains, one holding a sledgehammer. I wasn't sure if i was still in a dream."
"I want to see two of these run into each other, head on, at 70mph. I just feel like that would answer a lot of my questions."
I love that the timer just jumped from 4 to 8 minutes. We're running on Elon time already.
Why would you want unbreakable side glass? That's like one of the most important emergency exits...
"I'm severely conflicted about this thing.  On paper, it beats everything--*everything*--currently in production.  By a lot.

It's also one of the ugliest vehicles I've ever seen.

_Ever._"
"A tesla coil, check. Delorean, check. Blade runner everywhere, check. Beer in hand, check."
ULA snipers replaced the windows with normal glass ones
"There is something interesting about it. The first view is a real shock, but it's because there just is nothing like it. With the ATV in back, it actually looked badass."
"As a kid in the 80's imagining the vehicle to take me through a post nuclear apocalyptic hellscape future, this would be it. I love it and I wish I could order it with some form of plasma rifle."
"Elon, there are these things called “rehearsals...”"
[Motor trend got early access](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info)
HOLY SHIT THEY ACCIDENTALLY BROKE IT FOR REAL OMG
"Looks like a Delorian Banged a Tacoma, and they may have been cousins.

Great stats, the window was pretty embarrassing"
did it just add 4 minutes to the timer?
"Maybe there's a ""cost of manufacturing"" edge associated with the big flat panels.  I'd guess the machinery to produce those is much easier/cheaper than machinery to produce curved/molded panels.

Also, no side visibility for the signals... tells me there will definitely be some updates to the look before release.  

One thing I was thinking... I was hoping to buy an electric truck to drive around a hunting ranch... stainless steel, definitely durable to stand up to driving through brush/mesquite/tree branches w/o showing scratches or damage.

The tailgate idea is cool, but probably a waste on most, as most won't be putting ATVs in the back.  Maybe there will be options there.

OMG the glass!  That was hilarious.  Not once, but TWICE!  Definitely saw the sweat running down his forehead after that!"
[deleted]
"The real question here is how much is that ATV? Elon don’t you walk off that stage, I need answers damn it."
[Lets go camping](https://i.imgur.com/OHqYlN7.png)

Lol they just broke the fucking glass wtf is this launch
"I mean this pitch was cringey and odd from the get-go, but I don't think he's every recovered from those windows breaking lol."
"Media are having a field day right now with the ""Made tough"" and the broken glass."
Elon said “oh my fucking god” when the glass broke.
"Idk the more you look at it the more it grows on you... plus... for under $50k it tows as much as some of the diesels, its awd, power outlets, built in air compressor, sledge hammer proof, and roomy? Take my money $$$"
Elon lost focus on his speech after those glass shattered
[deleted]
I WANT THE ATV. PLEASE BE FOR SALE.
Our boy Elon is selling Mars rovers to us Earthlings
"you know why they gave it all that armor?

If you think haters hate the current Teslas, they're really going to hate the truck. But you won't have to worry about damage to your truck!"
"I'm curious about the crash rating. Cars (and trucks) are supposed to fold in on themselves in a front end crash. The [crumple zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crumple_zone) allows the time of the crash to be lengthened so that the change in speed happens over a longer period of time. If the car doesn't crumple, the passengers are very likely to get whiplash. Any ideas?

UPDATE: Woah I got my first gold, how’s this work?"
I like all the people talking about how terrible of a presentation it was. Pretty much on par with every other Elon presentation. He's always awkward.
did elon just say oh my fucking god? lol

Placed order. Card got charged but next page crashed. What happens now?
"Honestly, I have this feeling that the idea was to let the design speak for itself, and to let the riduclous performance and features sink it. It just destroyed most trucks in every category, and at the same time, cockily glossed over most of the details.

I think in the same way Tesla doesnt market, they will let all the bloggers, reviewers, and youtubers do their thing and spread the word. They will do the drives, show the back bed mechanism, the interior etc. Im surprised nobody is realizing thats probably the strategy.

I view it more as a ""Here's the truck"" mic drop kinda moment. The glass breaking sucked though, feel bad for the guy

Disclaimer, model 3 owner"
"You could see Musk's sadness when the windows broke.
Someone most likely will have a talk with musk..."
Cool. Can't wait to be in traffic with the warthog from halo
Looks like the Halo warthog.
"Rumors going around that this thing has a boat mode. 

Thats the most Elon thing possible which means it must be true."
We are living in a meme
#WHAT'S THE INTERIOR LOOK LIKE?
[Rendering of Interior](https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/09_Desktop.jpg)
"Yo guys if you are reading this people are actuallying liking the truck

I mean the ordering page is down 

It looks sleek but where are the side mirrors yo?"
Ordered. Now how about that ATV?
"I like it.  I drive a truck and have for most of my life.  I need to be able to put a small rack on top for SUP boards and kayaks, ladders, and longer lumber.  Looks like the bed is wide enough for a sheet of ply.

I like the 120/240VAC power and compressed air - don't need to drag around generators or compressors.

I hope the seats have storage under and behind.  Seating for six is nice, but a center console with storage and cup holders is kinda' a necessity."
"When the glass broke, so did Elon and that was just sad to watch :("
Reminds me of Lara Croft's tits from tomb raider 1
"""This truck is going to be unlike everything you've ever seen. And super weird and have a future vibe"" - Elon (paraphrasing here)

[unveils a super weird looking future looking truck]

""OZMG AHHHHH IT'S SO WEIRD. WHY DIDN'T HE DESIGN A NORMAL TRUCK."" - this thread

How is anyone surprised by this?"
And... that's the sound of Ford and all the other truck makers breath a collective sigh of relief....
"Alright unpopular opinion: this thing is fucking cool.

Like he said, 100 years of the same, this looks like something straight out of sci-fi, and it works. I was skeptical at first but when they showed the bed opening up I instantly thought it looked like a spaceship. Nobody is pushing design boundaries these days, every SUV looks the same, and hell most trucks are very similar. There's no individuality in design and that's a gripe I've had for years. This is really cool, not just because it's Tesla. Finally some injection of interesting design into the market.

It'll grow on people, mark my words."
"So either everyone is going to want one and car design turns tonight, or this will be a PT Cruiser part II

Will be interesting to see how it plays out."
"Overall, I like it. Currently paying $500/mo for my truck and $200 at least in gas so I will probably lease it depending on lease costs for 17k miles a year. I do 70 miles a day for work commute alone"
Seeing that glass break wrecked him.
The broken glass was embarrassing. They should have tested on car before doing it live.
"I wonder if they intentionally didn't put much effort into finalizing the details of this prototype knowing the risk was high that they'd have to change the design?

&#x200B;

I get the feeling that they aren't very confident in their own design. For starters, there are many details missing, such as side view mirrors (or even cameras), autopilot cameras, windshield wipers...and including that steering wheel, it's the most ""prototype"" vehicle they've ever unveiled.

Also during the presentation it seemed Elon and Franz were both unsure of how it'd be accepted, and nobody (them nor the crowd) really knew what to think.

Lastly, I recall a tweet from Elon a while back saying if it wasn't received well, they'd make a conventional looking truck."
It's like they needed a rover for SpaceX and decided to kill two birds with one stone.
[serious] is this what it actually looks like or is this a marketing stunt?
"Ok Lets see how many people liked it,

"All of a sudden, the speculation render looks 1000x times better."
HAhahahahahahWTF IS THAT
"As soon as that glass smashed, I could only think that this is definitely a joke."

I guess at least they had it on hand?"
"Scrolling down this thread it seems like around 50% hate the design, 25% can't decide/in the middle, and 25% love it. Obviously most people in this thread are Tesla fans, but Elon was sure right about you either like it or you don't."

I need that ATV right nowwwww
I think they could’ve pulled this event off if those fuckin windows didn’t break.

He’s pissed at that broken glass.
Jesus christ the memes from this are going to last through 2050
"I drive a Ram 1500 that seemingly spends more time at the dealer’s service center than at my house. I’ve been anxiously awaiting this day. I’m so torn. For $100 I made a deposit, but I don’t know. This is edgy af - I haven’t decided if that’s good yet. I’m half expecting him to release the real design later. But honestly just looking at data: can tow about 5,000 more than mine, haul about twice as much, and goes 0-60 like 3 times as fast..."
"So many great features for a pickup truck. Adaptive air suspension, bullet proof stainless steel skin, built in air and power sources, full ramp tailgate, crazy torque and towing capacity, sports car speed, amazing price.

All totally overshadowed by the fact that it’s shaped like a triangle and the windows broke"
I love watching a countdown finally get to zero and then getting to watch “please stand by”.
Ok but really they can’t be serious. BOTH the windows broke ??! Jesus Christ almighty please Elon roll out the real truck let this be fake
I laughed when it rolled out. And pre-ordered even after the glass break.
"This thread at 8:30
“Haha nice gag”

8:40
“It’s a joke right”

8:50
“The ACTUAL truck is going to smash through this at any second”

“Guys, this event was a fakeout! The real truck isn’t coming until some other time lol”

2021
“Guys the trucks you’re seeing on the road aren’t the final ones! We’ll still be getting the actual truck soon”"
WHAT. THE FUCK
can those dumb fcks in the audience keep quiet please
Someone’s getting fired for that embarrassment lmao
I actually fucking love that bed
I'm about 96% sure that CyberTruck fought David Hasselhoff and KITT back in 1987.
That hurt at the beginning.. and the glass omg.  I think I like the truck though.
"Someone’s getting fired over the glass thing, that was unfortunate"
"Franz: “Should I break another one?” Elon:”Sure, why not?”"
Ok serious question: why can I get a big ass truck from tesla for 39k but I can’t get a model 3 for like 30. Tesla. Make it happen! Lower those prices
"Old cars use to be built like tanks but they stopped because crashes were way more deadly w/o crush zones.

How is this not the most aggressive form of that old design?"
"Everyone salty about the windows and I'm over here like ""Um, how's EMS dragging my ass out when I flip it showing it off?!"""
"Truckla vs Cybertruck, on road.

"I just noticed. ​Long Range Model S is 373mi and 0-60 in 3.7 secs while Top End Tri-motor Cybertruck is 500mi and 0-60 in 2.9 secs and cost $69,900 while Long Range Model S is $ 79,990. That's a $10k difference and makes the Cybertruck the best bang for the buck for range. Of course, we have until 2022 so Tesla can improve their range/0-60 for Model S with the Plaid Long Range model"
I want to know the price for the ATV.
Looks like a 2007 drawing of a 2020 concept
"Dude that thing wrapped in black would be epic!

Im loving the air suspension and the bed cover.

It keeps growing lol"
Love it my dream vehicle like a lambo truck Mars Rover shit
I see Elon’s taking us back to the low-poly days
[deleted]
"Well i dont hate it, but I am sure 100% of the market for a truck will hate it. It's futuristic and cool and way different then I thought. All tho the people driving trucks likes them for totally different reasons."
"Aesthetics aside, I'm amazed the base price is $39k."
"To those saying this is not a work truck:

1) One of the biggest pains on my line of work is hauling a generator everywhere...with the Cybertruck I don’t have to, and I’m not a fan of breathing fumes while I do my job

2) Air suspension = Air compressor
If Tesla does it right and I get enough PSAs to run 2 framing nailers, that is another big advantage for me.

3) Towing capacity
If true, that means I can haul more brick, steel and tools in my trailer

4) Closed bed and security 
Knowing Tesla, the Cybertruck will have a good security system...All them cameras could be used along with the radars to be a nice security system. 
If they fix the window issue, a thief will go for the traditional truck before he messes with the Cybertruck 

5) Truck bed
If the body can take a sledge hammer, I’d like to think the bed might not even need liner

6) F150 now has an aluminum frame...the purists bitched and moaned about how steel was so much better and stronger...now there is a truck with a better steel frame and body...

7) Self Driving 
Not having to deal with driving after a days hard work sounds good to me

Anyways, I put in my deposit...I want this truck for work, not to be a poser or look good..."
Elon Musk has lost his god damn mind. OMG
"Ok the glass breaking cringe and the truck being ugly is one thing. But the presentation sucked. Like they didn’t show off anything it could do. They didn’t show the bed well. No inside shots. 

I feel like they rushed everything to hit Nov 21"
"I will likely never need to own a truck. But I am HYPE right now.

I mean, I guess I will never need to own a semi either but I was also super hype for that event and then the roadster happened, so it’s totally worth it."
This is painful to watch
[deleted]
I can’t watch any more. Once the glass broke it became far too awkward.
"39,900. Wow"
Elon is fucking furious right now. Damn.
https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck website is up
Holy balls we just witnessed history
It doesn't have side mirrors...
"Presentation was not good - I suspect hitting the doors right before attempting the glass test was what made the demo go wrong, and then that just killed the mood 100%. That said, the specs are absolutely insane if you actually use your truck to do stuff, and it'll probably get a bunch of people who want the WTF factor."
Utility and price: hard to beat.
"I mean, at least that _was_ epic"
Did anyone else notice that there aren’t side mirrors?
That thing is fugly as hell and I LOVE it
"These n64 graphics are hella neat 😎 
/s"
"How is the whole exoskeleton going to work when it's in crashes? You need crumple zones these days, and how much of a pain will it be to fix? Also when does the rick roll stop and we get to see the real version?"
At least you won't need to be worried about someone keying your truck.
Wrap shops are gonna stay busy.
"**I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched Cybertruck unveils near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like  tears in rain.**"
"""Homyfuckinggod.......yeah try on the back window"""
I find this vehicle incredibly exciting and rugged. Not a huge fan of the huge windshield. Im interested in how they’ll make a profit at all with prices like that. They will be available in about 2-3 yrs so I’m sure Tesla will listen to feedback and make changes here and there. Very functional impressive range and quirky looks. I’m a fan.

"The more I think about Blade Runner, one of my all-time favorite movies, the more I like this truck, and that's without consideration to a bulletproof body, up to 500 miles of range, 0-60 in 2.9 secs, the air suspension, that cool tailgate and bed cover, 110 and 220 outlets. Holy fuck."
i like it. we need more cars like this. i hate the rounded look every new car has.

"Probably an unpopular opinion, but I fucking love the look of this thing."
I’m about to lose No Nut November because of this reveal.
Oh fuck. I’ve never cringe so hard. I can’t turn away.
"Lmao, the broken glass as a backdrop is the perfect image to sum up this unveil."
Remember in the 80s how we thought vehicles would look in the future? This is one of those drawings come to life and now we don’t want it for some reason.
waiting for elon to say just kidding and roll out the real truck
"We just witnessed Elon Musk roll out a polygon on wheels, break the windows, and babble on until the stream ended. What the hell was that presentation?"
"Damnit it just updated from 4 mins to 8 mins.

I hope it isn't too delayed, not sure if I can keep myself up past 4am much longer 😂"
This can’t be real. Is it not rendered properly?
this feels like a parody. this has to be a parody. please tell me we’re being pranked.
"This is cool.

Now, where's the real one that will sell because it's actually useful?"
"Unconventional looks aside, the characteristics they're describing seem really promising so far."
Where are the side mirrors?  Where are the side cameras for AP?
Did the livestream just cut out for anyone else?
"An ATV! This is the best day ever!!!

Edit; slight dampened enthusiasm, it's a 2wd chain drive. Womp womp."
I wish Elon was more prepared for his presentations. Seems like there's a bunch of stuff to talk about. They're like last minute high school projects.
"The price is great,  the features are really interesting and so is the performance. but they didn't talk about the about the range while towing, weight of the vehicle, or the drive train. No release date either. Im honestly blown away that it looks like that."
The website just crashed. How many of you are ordering this jesus
"motherfucker looks like it could take an RPG hit or two

perfect for suburbia"
this was my first time watching a Tesla announcement and it was pure entertainment. loved it. laughed throughout it too!!
100% guaranteed that this truck is in a Rock movie this summer the auto pilot will drive while The Rock shoots at bad guys from the bed and chases the main villain on the ATV before the final showdown.
"It'll be fine. We knew going in it was going to be a weird ass design. Looks like it comfortably seats at least 6. The covered bed makes it look odd, but probably majorly improves the aerodynamics.

A lot of people will hate it, but I get the feeling that the specs and price will shift opinion."
Can someone make a render of it with a matte black finish?
"I was telling a friend earlier today that Musk is a Kojima-like figure. This truck proves it.  
Few question:  
How do I change the tires? Inflate them? Does it come with a spare?  
Where are the mirrors?  
Can I see out the back? (Rear-view?)  
Trunk bed looked heavy as fuck. No powered lift?  
Where are the windshield wipers?  
Stop light bar is on a moving piece?  
How does the truck crumple?

Edit: Just watched a video of someone's ride inside the truck. While you need the cover up to see out the back(Not as much of an issue as I initially thought looking at the truck), the ""FOV"" looks pretty legit.
[Video for anyone interested.](https://youtu.be/BTDztHFa0_Q)"
"If it was a motorcycle instead of a four wheeler, I would have bought one without knowing anything about it."
"Possibility of owning a warthog is kind of sweet.

Also. I want the details on the ATV. Speed, range, and obviously price."
[deleted]
"It looks like a metallic cheese wedge

Honestly id be worried about rear visibility. Does it use a camera system to help see out the back?"
How about that rivian truck?
[Brazzer be like:](https://i.imgur.com/Gx6U9ua.png)
Oh no. It's too weird.
"Gotta be honest. Everyone told be it was going to look ugly and I defended Tesla saying it won’t be. 

I was wrong."
I think I drew this kinda car in the second grade.......
Love that they just shattered both the windows... Great look
"This is exactly why you don’t do live demos at your product introduction. Obviously the performance is pretty impressive, and you can even get over the total weirdness of the design, BUT YOU CANNOT BRAG ABOUT HOW SOMETHING IS UNBREAKABLE AND THEN BREAK IT ON STAGE"
"Just placed my order, got a picture of a cyber owl."
"This makes no sense

CyberTruck: $70k, 500mile+ range, Tri-motor, 2.9s 0-60

Model X LR: $85k, 328mile range, dual-motor, 4.4s 0-60

So...Can I have the power unit of the CyberTruck but on a Model X body?"
I can't wait to see these on the street and see the collective wtf on people's faces. Preordered!
mods won't even turn the sub back on because of the shit show they're about to deal with lmao
"I guess this would be an unpopular opinion, but I totally love the design. This thing is mean!"
"What the fuck? Every time I look at it, it looks slightly better and grows on me a bit. Lets see if I feel the same tomorrow https://i.imgur.com/sZ9N7df.jpg"
"Test Ride Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKX7mwWnygE

Looks like they fixed the windows for the test rides. Or a different prototype."
"As a truck guy and as a construction and maintenance guy- I am so excited about not having to haul generators and air compressors around muddy and uneven job sites. Granted the body style is weird, but I kinda love it. Not to mention for $66,000 CAD I can outhaul our old ford 550! Deposit down"
When will it finish rendering?
They’re missing out on a massive opportunity to make a normal looking truck normal people would actually buy.
Holy shit hahaha this gotta be a joke
Im literally dying lmao
pls no
Is this a joke?
this is a joke right? lmao
he must be trolling
"Ugh. I was excited for a truck, not a 3D kids drawing."
"Sorry, but that’s ugly as sin."
This isn't a joke?
Please don’t let this be real
Please let this be a joke. Please. Please. That is so unbearably ugly. Wow Tesla.
This has to be a joke
Please god tell me this is a joke
I dont want a stainless steel stealth tank   sorry dude I'll buy rivian    no one will buy this in the midwest    no one
"""To test this armor glass, we left one in the Bay Area and the thieves couldn't break into it to look in the trunk!"""
"If this is real, it's one of the worst new product presentations I've ever seen."
Omg it’s not a joke..
"The glass breaking, the awkwardness. Amazing. I mean I love my X but good lord Elon."
Big fucking yikes. This unveil has been really fucking awkward so far.
"Has to be a joke he's going to slowly break every piece till it reveals the real truck. 
I hope."
Omg the glass broke. How embarassing lol
Good lord like wtf am I watching here?
"I love Elon, but this is actually painful"
The point was made with the ball drop demo!  There was no need to try it on the vehicle!  And then TWICE!!
Respect for the 0-60 but this is ugly as fuck
Oh no. He's gotta stand in front of those broken windows the rest of the presentation. Lol
surely they have an extra truck to roll in just so we didnt have to stare at the broken glass hahaha
Did he practice this speech or is he just winging it?
"Good specs, but ugly ass truck. Why?!!!!"
"I only started watching when they threw the ball at the window, so maybe I missed him talking about it earlier.

Normally car windows are tempered glass. Shouldn't you want the car door windows to be tempered glass so they shatter easily for a safe and quick escape in an emergency where you can't open the door?"
ok the bed actually looks sweet
"That was not what I was expecting, however I would still probably buy it"
[Elon after he reads the twitter reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usl7tEgc31M)
https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck is now live (it wasn't when Elon first mentioned it).
"Isn't Elon always dumping on other automakers for making weird looking electric vehicles, saying that's why people don't buy them? He forget his own cardinal rule and why he made Tesla's look ""S3XY""."
"I have a DeLorean and a Model 3. I have been lamenting the fact that I don't need two cars, but loathe to get rid of my childhood dream car. This is like they had a child together. I'll trade them both in for one.

Although it does look pretty ridiculous :D"
Aaaaand the site is down.  From all the people saying it's so ugly... but can't stop looking.
Looks like there will be a pressurised version for Mars.
"With this thing being made with stainless steel, we better see some serious shit when this sucker hits 88mph."
All of the people who still drive hummers are going to upgrade to this
It looks like Lara Croft's boobs
"Yeah, the glass has cracks after you throw a huge metal ball at it with full force. How often will something like that happen in your everyday life?"
"This truck looks like something out of a video game.

Maybe something on the Atari.

Or a low poly version of the warthog from Halo.

It's sultry shape reminds me of a woman: specifically, Lara Croft from Tomb Raider."
"I'm kinda bowled over by the design. I was not expecting something with such strange (over?) simplicity. Just wish it had some curves to complement the jaggies.

One thing's for sure. Tesla's got guts for releasing this."
‘member when people were bitching about the 3’s nose/grille design?! XD
"Going unibody for Cybertruck was the biggest misstep.  Ensures any pending redesign will be much more time consuming, and completely negates any chance this thing had as a vocational truck (flatbed, conversion, etc.)."

Also when the light hits it the stainless looks nice."
"“Going to look different.”

It’s only 2019 and we already have the understatement of the century. The more accurate statement is, “unnecessarily different.”"
But does it show up on radar??
"I love the design, but I definitely can see why people will hate it.  It does have a bit of a novelty look to it, which I’m digging.  It doesn’t look practical for people who actually use their trucks for work related things."
"I dont need it, its crazy, who needs an armoured car but damn it, I want it."
"After a lot of thinking about the design, I’ve concluded this is a Tesla G Wagon."
"Worst case scenario, they just destroyed car design for the next 25 years"

"The option to install  ""Boring Company"" flamethrowers is missing."
I was going to buy one before the reveal..... I’m going to check out the competition now.
"""Love the car, Elon!"" I scream as I burn to death in my CYBRTRK while first responders try to break the bulletproof glass."
"This is the most hideous thing I have ever laid eyes on, and I want one."
"So I haven't gotten a new car in 20 years, literally, and I instantly placed an order. Just loved it immediately."
"Gee guys, really?  This is the coolest fucking thing ever."
"You can add -stream after reddit in this thread's url to view this thread as more of a chat room that auto refreshes.  Or click here:  https://reddit-stream.com/comments/dzuegh/

Fashionably late as usual.
If it weren’t for the little wisps of smoke around the headlight I’d think this link was dead.
Is that Grimes?
Elon's digital waifu confirmed
Damn that's pretty ugly
I was not expecting that shape to come out
This is a joke. I know it. Real cybertruck any second now.
Looks like an F-117 Nighthawk with that ATV in the back
Say sike.
Elon didn't seem prepared at all. At least it's got good specs.
You made a time machine...Out of a Cyber Truck?
How to buy ATV. I am ready. Or cmon. Make me a small model X golf cart ! $5000
"I love it, I think it takes some getting used to"
"Its god damn fugly, but im so getting one !"
Did they only have 1 truck? Why wouldn't they test the metal ball throw before bringing it on stage?
[Interior](https://i.redd.it/qze8u7sd36041.png) photo
"As a huge bladerunner fan, I am strongly considering this over the model Y"
Maybe it wasn't a good idea to test the glass on a prototype.
I ordered two. Just to make sure.
Did anyone see any Tesla logo's on the truck?
"Hey Elon, stay weird."
Looks like something from an 80s action movie. Freaking love it
So far every guys wife/gf  I talk to does not like it lol.
"I see Elon is getting as hyped as I am for 
 2077,"
Did they forget to install graphics card drivers?
It reminds me of the Dunder Mifflin Sabre pyramid tablet. Lol.
I see Delorean got a new gig.
I just want to know where to get the 4 wheeler.
Wtf time jumped back lol I should prob be asleep anyway 😎
i feel like this is going on way too long to be a joke...
"Elon:

*chuckles*

I'm in danger"
"I honestly thought ok, this is limited edition like $100k per truck. Special thing. The price makes it seem like TEsla plans to mass produce these. Not sure what to do think. I think Rivian has little to fear here."
How did Franz go from Model 3 and Roadster 2 to this monstrosity?
"I wanna believe that someone was like, ""no. for safety and emergent car egress, the side windows will be standard car glass. So, remember, THROW THE BALL AT THE WINDSCREEN."" 

Later that evening...

""Fuck, they forgot"""
I think Elon cut this short. There was so much to show and he kept stopping and looking back at the two smashed windows. I think he was pissed. It was embarrassing.
"""We may have to do a more normal looking truck.""

Yes.  Yes you will."
Ppl who made fun of the renders wish it looked like them rn lol
This pickup is 100% designed for the military. This is like the H1 Hummer.
Didn’t Elon say EVs looked weird so he made some that look normal and now he puts out this door holder wedge looking truck
"I expected extreme angularity, due to the teaser images and logo used for the vehicle.

But I did not expect the motorized retracting cargo cover, ramp built in the tailgate, onboard 120/220 volt charger, Active Air Suspension, Pneumatic Tool Source or Stainless Steel construction, a la DeLorian.

Glass likely got pre-stressed in rehearsals and finally gave during the unveiling.  No big.

Want to see more..."
I figured out what it reminds me of.... [Lara Croft](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fthe-void.co.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F06%2Ftomb-raider-lara-croft-original.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)
"Honestly I suspect to see these get tricked out by rappers and young money types. They'll be the new Hummer/G-Wagon status symbols. And once that happens, everyone is going to want one.

It was a terrible reveal, but I don't think they are going to have any trouble selling this."
This thing looks like the kind of truck RoboCop fucks in... And I like it.
"Just imagine pulling up next to some BMW, Mercedes, etc. turning heads then launching 0-60 in 2.9 sec."
"If Tesla can make a vehicle this much more capable than the Model 3 for practically the same base price, this gives me hope they can release a cheaper car in the future. Imagine how much a $30k Tesla would eat into sales of Camrys and Civics."
"100% there will be decals for the windows that mimic the broken windows from the reveal.

&#x200B;

Edit: Wait, that's my idea.  No one steal it. I'm gonna be rich."
"The good

- range claims were met with 500 miles/800 km top version;

- price is way under expectations ranging from the cheapest to the most expensive, the starting prices if met are incredible;

- the toughness of it both body panels and windows could mean a lot to many people who want to off road it or otherwise use it in difficult conditions;

- the top specification performance for 1/4 mile was better than expected at 10.8s and just under 3s for 0 to 60miles, though it will end up around 3.1s for 0 to 100 kph.

The bad

- base version seems inadequate in terms of range and they're stretching it just to hit a lower price, when towing it will look anemic next to a Nissan Leaf;

- the style resembles a Delorean which for some might actually be a good thing, the similarities being no doubt due to the use of strainless steel and sharp corners.

The ugly

- what the fuck were they thinking with that roof line? By far the worst looking Tesla ever. The front is fine but the top of the truck from the profile is so off putting.

Edit

The only thing that might make people love the truck despite having the looks that only its creator would like, would be if the claimed ranges are while towing and the charging speeds are all ~1MW and they played us not revealing the battery pack capacities which are barely cut down versions of the 300 miles range (at max towing capacity) class 8 semi truck. But given the prices and size (compared to the concept from the semi truck unveil), that's impossible for a profit and current battery technology, if at least they all cost double then it would make sense $80000 = 500 miles EPA, 250 miles while towing, $100000 = 600 miles EPA, 300 miles while towing, $120000 = 1000 miles EPA, 500 miles while towing. Pretty crazy but could have happened as mini versions of the larger truck."
"Cheaper starting price than the average truck sold in the US with better specs. 

“People don’t know what they want until you give it to them” — Elon"
I love it
"A few thoughts:

1) With the rear of the truck lowered, the top of the bed came up to Elon's shoulders. He's 6'2"". I wonder how that compares to the bed height of an F150? If you were to lower the entire truck to it's lowest, would the top of the bed at the tallest point be that much higher than on a F150?

2) For a 2018 Ford F-150, the maximum load capacity I'm seeing is 3270, and that's with the heavy tow package and big 5.0L V8. That Tesla is pulling off 3400 seems pretty dang impressive, especially at the price point.

3) The 2020 Ford F-150s have a 5.5', 6.5' and 8' options for bed length. The 6.5' Cybertruck bed length being smack dab in the middle is likely the most popular length for F-150s?

4) Cybertruck has nearly 7"" extra ground clearance over an F150. For reference, Model 3 Ground Clearance is 5.5"" total.

5) Configuring a 2020 F150 to meet the base spec of the Cybertruck runs me $56,000 (assuming 6 seats, tech packages, 4x2, max payload/towing capacity, power outlets for power tools)

If people can get past the styling, this truck will sell like crazy. Had been planning on replacing our Forester with a Model Y when the time came. This exceeds my expectations, and I can deal with the styling."
"I'm at the event and honestly it looks a lot cooler in person, still weird, but cool."
"I'm sorry, I love Tesla and my model 3, but the design looks like complete garbage."
"""Oh and one more thing, this is all bullshit."" *starts actual reveal*"
"So, is this even road legal?  Where are the bumpers?  Where is the crumple zone for pedestrians?"
Love it or hate it god bless Tesla for pushing the boundary of people’s idea of normal
"So 1 hour after the unveil of this thing an alarming number of Tesla fans (of which I am one) are hoping this is a joke.  What do you think the general public, who don’t stay up late and jump on a Tesla reddit, will think of it? I find that thought, combined with Elon’s desire to compete with the “top 3 selling automobiles in America”, well..... scary."
Back to 8 1/2 minutes
Timer changed?
Did they just push back the time 5 minutes?
Idiots in audience - please quiet down so dad can talk.
THE MAD MAN HE ACTUALLY DID IT
Welp. That's hideous
messing with us?
I'm sitting here laughing hysterically at this... I can't even.
"Is this an ad for the miltary? lol 

Elon making military vehicles?"
This has to be a joke
LOL both windows broke. RIP demo
Omfg that's awkward
This cannot be real... like actually are we being bamboozled??
I don’t like this. At all
Uhhhh this is so weird
This thing is comically bad. I can't believe it. It just doesn't fit with \*\*anything\*\* else in Tesla's lineup.
"This is Tesla’s version of a blue screen of death issue, if anyone else is old enough to remember Microsoft’s rather embarrassing Windows presentation back in the day."
*Insert Homer backing up into bush meme*
I prefer the Ford immensely when they’re side by side hooooly
This truck is great! I haven't laughed this hard in weeks!
I had to pause the video. I felt the cringe I felt when watching Season 1 of The Office for the first time.
Those angles.. and 500+ mile range? That's nuts. Truly intrigued for off-roading now...
Do Tesla designers not own trucks? Is this for Mars?
OK the bed opening was sick.
If the truck doesn't sell the ATV will lol
WHAT THE FUCK
When do they release the 32-bit renderings?
Honestly if they hadn't called it a truck...

JUST PRE ORDERED!

That was very Elon of Elon to do
That would look so badass in real life. Holy cow
I think it's perfect for a drug dealer if they make the windows more bulletproof
ITT: “He said it was gonna look different than other trucks. No complaining allowed!”
"They are doing test drives anyone live streaming getting into one yet? Wanna see the interior, performance and stuff."
"I was shocked at how volumetrically large it is. In the tug of war with the F-150, and the drag race with the 911, it showed just how BIG the overall envelope is."
Thank God they didn't test the bullet proof claims
"The design will surely be talked (and meme'd) about for the foreseeable future. But looking past that I do think they have something interesting here that combines clean energy with durability, performance, and affordability that other truck manufacturers envy. 

I'm thinking the angular design was necessary to achieve the kind of toughness they're showing off."
This looks like a truck made for tesla die hards and people who bought humvees.
Here it is. The first vehicle designed for two planets
"So, how do windshield wipers work on a thing like this?

I love it. I ducking love it. But then I was like... hmm... can’t make out wipers anywhere"
"here's a demo of the glass on the semi:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwN39LWnzG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwN39LWnzG4) 

considering how long they've been using it, it's really crazy that it failed not once, but twice on stage. Wonder what happened?"
Reminds me of the Halo Warthog

"As some others have said, this looks more like for people who want something for outdoorsing/off-roading, not for anybody looking to use it for work.

Not sure if that's the right approach."
"This is the dumbest fucking thing, I love it so much.

First reaction is definitely ""oh noes baby, wut r u's doin'"", but the absurdity really does have a certain charm to it. I definitely would not be opposed to driving this thing."
We gonna have Mars rovers on Earth now?
Looks like its designed to avoid being caught by radar guns
"I really don't know what to make of this... Between the design and the botched glass demonstration, I'm still not sure if this is all real."
"Heres my thought on it

"haha. as a Tesla lover, this thing is ugggggly and that failed glass test was pathetic :("
I choose a bad day to quit drinking.
"I really love it.

I know it’s weird and certainly not to everyone’s taste, but what on earth were all the shocked people here expecting after Musk said ‘Blade Runner Cybertruck’? Because this looks exactly like what you’d expect of that."
This is like when they made the triangle-shaped ipad on The Office.
"So I'm thinking... is it ugly to most of us because it's objectively ugly (no such thing, I know), or because we are so used to (""brainwashed"" in a way) to a certain design direction that it cannot appeal to us anything radically different? But to a human who has never been exposed to modern trends, this would be good looking perhaps."
HOLY SHIT THE ‘ohmyfuckinggod’ from Elon when the glass broke.
Well this glass thing is sure to go viral.
"What in the absolute fuck did I just watch?

That can't be real. No way. It looks ridiculous.

I'm not convinced this isn't some elaborate joke. The Semi reveal was actually legit and the truck itself was practically designed and legit. This thing is like a sketch from a bar napkin."
"You wouldn't think it's possible because the bar is so low, but somehow it feels like the more practice Tesla/Elon have at these reveals the worse they go.

Like I get Elon is too busy to practice the event in the mirror for a week, but it plays out like he's having everything he's going to do and say unveiled to him at the exact same moment."
SOOOO mixed. I was SO scared it would be hideous. And for the average consumer OMG it is. But for me personally I totally dig it. I am a fucking super Back To The Future nerd and this has DeLorean written all over it. I have never had a truck and never desired a truck. I want this Truck more than any other Tesla.
I hate it.... But for some reason I want to own and drive it.
"As long as it has a “Not a Flamethrower” compartment, I’m sold."
"Did the countdown just add time? It was at 7 minutes, refreshed 4 minutes later, was at 7 again. I expected it to start on Tesla time but didn't think they'd mess with the counter, lol

"So a lot of people here are not fans, ill go ahead and throw my contrasting opinion in the ring. I think it looks pretty neat overall."
I seriously think this is for Mars.
"I was so excited for a functional work truck from Tesla. Like, credit card out and ready to go before the steam went live. I'm pretty disappointed. I have a lot of concerns that need to be addressed before I buy one.

1. Body on frame construction is still popular because you can repair minor body damage cheaply or live with cosmetic damage. How expensive is fixing those load bearing stainless body panels? How much damage can the panels take before the car is unsafe? Also, this means no Tesla trucks with dump beds because you can't remove the existing bed and mount aftermarket parts to a frame. Doesn't impact me, but it limits the addressable market.
2. I dislike the mandatory air suspension. It is a failure point I don't ever want to deal with, and I'm probably paying a lot for it. I love love love the integrated 220v AC power, but I never see myself needing the air compressor.
3. Bed access looks terrible from the sides, and there doesn't appear to be good hardpoints for a roof rack. 

When I heard ""radical design,"" I figured Tesla was making a cabover pickup because it is a superior truck configuration only held back by the need to fit a bulky, noisy gas engine under the seats. I imagined a truck with crew cab and extended bed that was no longer than a Toyota Tacoma.

I might warm up to this design. The 50k price point is compelling. Maybe I'll get a Rivian or Model Y instead."

Quick! Someone call Simone Giertz to make this into a pickup truck.

Reserves Rivian...
I’m waiting to hear Elon say “it’s just a prank bro”
"this is going on for too long, bring the real truck out. please."
Elon let Homer design that thing.
Elon Musk has lost his damn mind.
What in the absolute fuck is this demo
LOLOLOL THE GLASS BROKE
Someone in Europe woke up really early for this
Bring in the real truck now?
And they broke the glass
"Its a joke, it must be..."
This is really really bad
I don’t see any AP cameras in the pillars. This ain’t the truck. Right? Please?
SHOOOOOOOT IT
"Saying omfg on a live stream, this is painful to watch"
Holy shit this is even harder to watch than normal.
This HAS to be a joke.....
Elon looks like he's about to cry lol...
Does Elon seem...more nervous that normal?
the corners are way too sharp
did they run out of stamping machines at the factory? Just people straight up welding flat sheet metal together?
I don't get it I thought he'd start cracking jokes when the glass broke but he's still serious
I’m starting to think it’s not a joke
My god. This can’t be real
ight imma head out.
Wow it actually looks like an ATV. And that ramp is slick
How do I order the ATV?
Dude broke the windows!!!  Oops
I'm in for the ATV
Reservation website is down
"How is a stainless exoskeleton going to fare in crash safety testing? Hmm.

EDIT: Yes I know it's just a unibody truck (see: Honda Ridgeline). I'm specifically wondering because stainless is a lot harder than what is normally used, and crumple is used to absorb impact for safety normally."
If the ATV is included with the purchase of the truck then maybe I'll consider it.
Only question which model do you get? Dual or tri motor? Obviously want the tri but an extra year 🤷‍♂️ 500 miles would be great tho
What an absolute unit
I want to know more about the locker storage and more about the bed (they’re calling it the vault) and the cover (they have pics online) but he didn’t even touch on those.
"I'm gonna say it. . .I don't entire hate the design.  Its probably grown on me a little bit, but. . .there is a reason why trucks are built on frames and usually aren't unibody construction.  Maybe this all steel design works around that.  What I'm more interested in is how does payload or towing affect those ranges?"
Looks like a drawing I made in first grade
"It's a reimagined truck.  

How do I put ladder racks on this?"
"I feel like the Cybertruck would be better marketed as an off-roading vehicle, comparable to a jeep, rather than a truck."
BUILT TOUGH.
As someone more in the 80s hilux camp of truck design this thing is my dream ev
The console/screen layout looks awesome.
Looks more Bladerunner DeLorean than Bladerunner APC to me...
Kind of surprised they didn't include any video of off-road capabilities -- which should be impressive. Seems like they missed an opportunity there.
"""what? That is not a Tesla!!"" 
My daughter's reaction when she (6 years old) sees the cybertruck :)"
It looks like a delorean in a blade runner 2049 universe - turned truck.
DeLorean vibes
Will an exoskeleton design be a problem from crash point of view? No crumple zones.
"Beginning of presentation: hahahah, cook joke.
As presentation progressed: ok, weird flex...."
"I dont know about this. Trucks all look the same for a reason. Maybe I'd get one if they toned it down a bit, it gets really good reviews, and still gets good range while towing."
"No more alcohol on lunch time guys, switch to fruit juice or water."
"Will it fit a 4x8 sheet of plywood?

Because my Honda Odyssey does.  

Elon, is your CybrTrk better than my 2008 Odyssey??

Hummmmm??"
This is quite the change to vehicle design in general. The car itself is a beast and the aesthetic is something we’ve never seen before. The car will definitely turn heads when out in the wild. Interested to see how the public will react to this vehicle.
Is Elon Trolling us?
"First reaction: ""oh god, no..""

After reading the specs: ""well, maybe.""

The more I read about this, the more I think this isn't what it's really going to look like. Mostly just based on how terrible the presentation was.

Please, don't let it look like that, please keep at least those specs."
Does this come with a free copy of cyberpunk 2077?
RIP to drivers who meet one on the road when it's all polished up and the sun is just right.
Looks like a combo between a Delorean and a Warthog from Halo
"Design... Not a fan but specs, holy Moses 500+ range and 0 to 60 in 2.9 WOW"
Well if DeLorean had ever made an SUV we now know what it would have looked like...
Is this Elon’s Lisa?
I... I don't think this is a joke my friends
"This presentation really went off of the rails. But a $40,000 truck with these specs is nice. They need to go back to the design room and give it a decent exterior. Also where is the interior?"
You might not like the truck but that atv was slick as hell
"The more I look at the video - I think this design may have ended up being a necessity and not a choice.

Considering how hard the material is - I don't think there's a single metal stamp press in the world that could actually make panels out of that stuff at the moment."
"I love this design, this is the type of stuff I see in video games"
"The glass test was odd because side windows typically  are supposed to shatter out for safety ( car doors jammed from accident, submerged, etc..) so I'm not sure super strong windows on side are even a good idea."
"The all flat angular design IMO is to keep price down and make production easy. Super simple stamping from stainless sheet and that’s basically it. Flat glass is cheaper too. I don’t like it, but I get it. No paint is cheaper too"
[deleted]
"Am I the only one that thinks it looks really cool? Sure it doesnt look like your typical truck, but that's what I like about it. 

I'd drive the shit out of it ."
"Maybe the ""one more thing"" will be a nice looking truck"
"First Game of Thrones and now this, I'm never getting my hopes up again."
"Pre-ordered.  2 others I know pre-ordered.  Sorry, I don't like ""normal"", boring, typical design.  The backend could use a bit of tweaking, but it's quickly growing on me already.  I mean, it doesn't even have side mirrors on this version, so obviously a bit of tweaking and detail adjustments are to come."
"I believe that this was a good move for Tesla.  Other companies are starting to build vehicles that look like theirs.  Others are getting faster.  It was time to shake things up to show they can still have crazy ideas.  

Plus they are reusing tech to build it.  Steel and glass from their shuttles. Batteries from multiple projects, most likely a similar interior to model 3, and the same software on the other vehicles.  It’s a win/win.  In the end, I do believe they will refine it a bit, but it’s really cool."
It’s low poly. Someone forgot to turn up the resolution.
"Ummm.... 

This is a joke right?"
"I’ve got to say...this is more exciting than Apple’s events. 

Now stop doing them so late for us East Coasters!!! 🤣"
That’s not the actual truck right?
"Wow, that is ugly"
The glass breaking totally threw him off. He keeps looking at it because he can’t get over it. He is more awkward than normal.
Damnit.  Thought for a second he'd bring out the real truck.  Sigh
[deleted]
The fact is at this price point it's going to sell.
The Aztek had a lot of features too...
"When the glass broke, I could feel Elon's shame for the rest of the presentation."
For $40k.. you can't flex any harder.
It’s like the Aztec and DeLorean had a baby
"Could someone please edit together a video where they break the glass, then the music from Curb Your Enthusiasm starts playing?"
"I can see why people wont like the looks, but as for me, a lover of sci fi movies i am thrilled! I think it looks badass!

I love how for once a company made a design that literally looks futuristic. So many car companies release these cool futuristic concepts and never do shit about it. 

Like it or not this truck is making history..."
"The design keeps growing on me... you have to admit the specs are BADASS.

The design may be like the first time you drank a beer.. Tastes like shit.. But now It feels so good when it hits the lips.

But where are the mirrors!?!?"
"Best way to describe this:

It's the new Hummer.

It's for people who would want a Hummer, but they'll buy this instead.

(And I don't mean that as a criticism, it's just that those are the types of people I see this appealing to)."
What the actual fuck
It’s nice to see something finally knocked the Aztek off  its throne.
I love how it looks. It’s a truck for people who don’t need a truck and that’s me.
HYPED AF OVER HERE!!! How bout you guys?
"I can't be the only one who is excited as hell, right? CYBER TRUCK!"
The time went back
Elon certainly has a thing for theatrics
“Hi dad” LMAO
Oh my god can these screamers shut the fuck up?
ew
What. The. Fuck.
What the what?!
Lol. So that's a no from me dawg
o god this is bad
Cyber truck hasn’t fully rendered for me.
damn this is pretty ugly. Pretty much looks like a billionaire spending money just to spend it.
I STAYED UP FOR THIS?!?!?!
I thought this was a fake and a real one will come behind
"This is so awkward. So much second hand cringe. Tesla, Franz... what have you done?"
Now I understand why it's supposed to go on Mars. Please use it only there lol
"Welp he was right, I fucking hate it"
"I mean, this looks cool, but that ain't a pickup truck...

it's a tank"
This has to be a joke. Transparent metal glass? WTF? Why does a truck need to be indestrictable? I don't even understand this presentation. Did they practice??
LMAO.
this is fake 100%
"Oh no, Franz...  oh no."
Trainwreck
WHAT IN THE FUCK IS GOING ON?
O O F
That was epic lol
"Please, for the love of god tell me this is a joke. He's going to present the real one in a minute, right? right guys?"
"""And this is the version that will go to Mars. Now for the Earth version..."""
WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW!?!
What is going on??? Someone help me.
Oh no... so embarrassing. The look that will immediately alienate massive chunks of the truck market and breaking both glass live on stage in first 10 min... probably will still buy but dam that was cringy.
say sike right now
"*anything happens*

Elon: ""yeah"""
Elon has got to be meming on everyone right now
[deleted]
$40k for starting price is pretty good.
This is so brutal. Musk could not look less interested to be there.
i can't stop cringing
"What are the chances this could be one of those ""Sonic moments"" and Tesla decides to change things up a bit? Maybe get some feedback on design??"
can someone please go back and find all the pencil drawings posted on here? they are so fucking accurate.
Wow ok the ATV is really classy looking. Charging in the bed of the car is awesome!
Oh my god
Production in late 2021 and 2022 for Tri motor 😩
I was watching it (not live) and it just ended before the video is gone.  Does anyone have a the video link?  I didn't get to finish.
Anyone else more exicted about the ATV than the truck?
Looks like something Walter White would be driving around.
"someone once said,  Glass is Glass. And glass breaks."
Can RADAR detect this thing? I think not!
[deleted]
He was going for a blade runner design but came out looking like Tron
"I can’t imagine that the glass test was unplanned. 

But I also can’t imagine that they wouldn’t have tested it on *that* truck before the event if it was planned..."
The interior of that windshield is going to be a bitch to clean.
"I hate it, which makes me know in 2 weeks I'll be thinking why don't other trucks look like this?"
Where’s the mirrors?
The retractable bed cover looks like it's solar panels maybe?
Is it invisible to radars ?
I guess they aren't selling the ATV lol :(
When your 3D modeling workstation only has a [Super FX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_FX) chip installed
I think Elon got to excited by the glass demo and forgot to not test it on the actual truck lol Even Hanz was like are you sure? lol I knew it wasn't going to work when Hanz hit the door with the hammer and the whole door jiggled lmao
It looks like if DeLorean made a truck.
Just when I thought all the drama was over.
"lol when the glass broke, smh they had to have tested that couple of times. I wonder what went wrong"
I think out of the 3 models the duel motor AWD version is probably the best bang for your buck.
"I seriously love the 18"" of ground clearance, with the ability to drop down into high speed cruise mode."
Looks like that bulldozer the guy welded all the steel panels on so he could drive it around and terrorize the towns-people.
This is the Mars edition
No wheel well indents in the bed. That’s pretty awesome for carrying loads. Also can wheel stuff right on to the bed instead of lifting.
Holy shit I want the new UI for the screen in my model 3!!!!
I just want the ATV.
Selling an actual pyramid
"“It’s closer to an armored personnel Carrier from the future”

“If you’re driving it down a road, this will look like it came out of a sci-fi movie” 

Really hammering the point that it’s futuristic. Regardless, looking forward to the event."
"The body on frame on my F-150 is super impractical to actually use the truck bed. I have the 6.5’ box and it’s stupidly high up. Would love the option of the truck squatting down when I open the back. The built in ramp is super smart. I would use it all the time. 

The thing I don’t understand is the rear visibility. Is the tonneau cover glass? Can you see through it? I saw there was a back window but when the tonneau cover is closed you couldn’t see behind you."
If this was a CGI render it would have 5-6 polygons haha
It's a jacked up Delorean!
It looks like the socialist buildings in my country....
I feel like it has been designed to work on mars as well
"It looks like a Ridgeline got ran over by a real truck

I hate it aesthetically but if it’s specs are accurate they’re impressive.  

But I think the bed rails are way too high and impractical.  Almost impossible to access the bed from anywhere but the tailgate.  I don’t want to have to climb up into the bed to access the front tie downs.  Or when I’m trying to toss bags of mulch or something into the bed I can’t just go over the side but can only do it from the rear."
[deleted]
This would make a better armored car than a pickup truck.
I really like the look. I have been a sci-fi fan forever and it is about damn time we got a vehicle that looks like the futuristic vehicles we see in the movies. I can not afford it but I would drive it every day proudly.
"Elon - Okay, we're going to fire all of our designers and replace them with this staff of origami teachers.  It's gonna be great!"
Elon should have just marketed this vehicle as a personal tank that is as fast as a Porsche to build hype for the Tesla brand...after making a more “standard“ pick up truck.
I think it will sell well because of it being relatively inexpensive but with a delivery time of two years I’m almost positive 50% of those early birds get buyers remorse
“Is this some out-of-season April Fool’s joke?”
"Tesla had an opportunity to create a vehicle that could compete in the best selling consumer vehicle category and accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. 

Instead they built this monument to a 13 year old’s cyberpunk dreams."
I noticed if you hit refresh the headlights flash across the screen!!!
"Omg, it looks even worse than I feared..."
This all looks like a really bad joke...
"Awesome truck, not so great presentation lol I wanted to see the interior and all the storage areas!

Edit: I noticed they skipped through those slides, damn lol so jumbled"
"The damn glass, kinda stumbled Elon."
I feel like this presentation lacked a lot.
"Interior:  [https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/09\_Desktop.jpg](https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/09_Desktop.jpg)

>You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in late 2021. Tri Motor AWD production is expected to begin in late 2022.

$100 preorder"
"I don't hate the design, I just expected more from Tesla this just feels like a step back compared to the rest of the Tesla fleet."
I’m a little nervous to show up at work tomorrow in my Tesla among all of my truck-owning coworkers 😅
Looks like an April's fool joke. I ordered one anyways.
I'm more interested in the ATV. Any info?
"Look, they took a risk and focused on making a truck that is actually rugged. It resulted in some tough design decisions because it’s all flat sides and glass. Will not be everyone’s cup of tea.  Let’s see what it looks like in a couple years and how it functions."
[deleted]
This truck appears to appeal to the Minecraft community
"Can we unlock submissions now? The front page of the sub, nor this OP, have any pictures or info about the Cybertruck."
"Look, I was saving to buy a model 3 performance next year but now I will save for another year and buy this thing and I never tought of buying a truck my entire life. 

I’m so in love with this."
"tesla's instagram now says

""automotive, aircraft & boat"" 

must check app to see it, that tagline doesn't show on desktop."
"The windows staying smashed for the whole presentation is kinda hilarious.


I don’t know man... some things impress me, but I’m a pickup driver who’s been waiting for this, I use my truck a lot, and as much as they want to do something new I feel like they really forgot who they were marketing to; pickup drivers.


If I could have gone down to my local Ford dealership last spring and picked out the exact same truck I did and then just chose the fully electric version instead of gas, that’s what I’d have done. This Mad Max monstrosity isn’t targeted at me."
Pre-orders may prove me wrong but as a shareholder I think I might need a drink.
"Seriously though...the more I look at the, the more I’m starting to like it."
"When he said one more thing I was convinced he was going to show us the ""real"" truck"
CNBC headline tomorrow: “Tesla on verge of collapse as it desperately releases futuristic truck that no one likes”
"I wanted 3 things;

Affordable

Can it tow

Next level out of the box future design.

I'm so stoked right now."
Rivian HQ popping the champagne after watching that presentation.
"Aluminum exoskeleton.  110/220 outlets.  Air compressor.  Adaptive air suspension.  16"" ground clearance (Ford Raptor has 11.2"").  3,500 lbs Payload (F-150 is 2,300 lbs).  14,000 lbs towing (F-150 is 8,000).  3 motors.  0-60 in 2.9.  

If you want pretty buy a Ford.  If you want a real truck, this blows away anything stock on the market today."
Fire the truck design team now
"The main con with this design is that it excludes throwing stuff on the roof. Plumbing conduit, long wooden beams, a kayak, etc ...

Which repeats the same con as with the model X.

Edit: Added missing ""with"" in second paragraph."
"This reminds me when Powell motors unveiled the Homer.

The only thing he didn't do is collapse on the floor and yell ""I'm ruined!"""
"Checks a bunch of boxes for me.  


So I pre-ordered :D"
"1.5 million pickup trucks sold per year. Maybe 5% of the buyers would consider switching to this. For people who want us off fossil fuels, this is an absolute disaster."
"I think people are missing the point with the design. Tesla knew the design was going to be polorizing, the audience they were after were the people who buy trucks for function, and not necessarly for looks. It pulls more than a ford f150, it's faster than a porche 911, it has a built in air compressor. All the people that buy trucks for the love of trucks, will have to give this a good look, because it excels in almost every category. And 500 miles! That's freaking nuts"
"So, I guess the shittiest fan renders won?"
"This looks amazing and I want one

That being said, the window breaking was the most cringe/awkward thing I’ve ever seen"
"Elon musk just sold me a $40,000 [warthog](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yRWuyQaq37s/maxresdefault.jpg)!"
"Taking bets on how late it's going to start, closest guess gets a worthless prize like Reddit gold (from me).

Did the countdown just jump and add more minutes?
Elon quit messing with time!!!!
Timer went from 3 mins to 7 mins. Seems Elon is behind
And now the T-30 minute timer begins
Is this thing announcing a truck or did I accidentally click on the XBox E3 stream?
jesus is that grimes?
Elon's got a waifu
What the actual fuck???
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS
WHAT THE F IS THAT Monster
those are some sharp edges...
It looks like a bad prop from a 1980s sci-fi... Eww.
"Um, that's different all right."
"I get the feeling this is a joke, but knowing Elon... it's probably not"
It’s looks like a Concept Car...is this an out of season April Fools Joke?
The crowd went silent pretty quickly.
Oh my Tesla stock.
"Wait... that's not it, right?

I mean I'm only 90% sure he's kidding now, down 10% in the last 2 mins."
"Honestly it looks perfect for Mars.

Earth? Hmm..."
I still can’t tell if this is fake.
no it's not real... unless?
He said they’d go back to the drawing board if people didn’t like it. I think they’ll have to redesign
"Wait, there's no open bed? This isn't a pickup......its an angled tank."
This has to be a joke...
I hope he destroys the truck with that hit
[deleted]
"At this point I'm hoping they'll attach crane hooks to it, and underneath is a product someone will actually buy."
"Ugliest thing I’ve ever seen, what the hell"
I still think he’s joking.
"I love Elon, but Jesus Christ is he the worst presenter in the world."
How is this presentation so fucking awkward? This feels like a bad E3 presentation
This is absolutely horrible
"Sometimes I love the random stuff Tesla adds to their vehicles, but they can’t honestly think most people are worried about sledgehammer attacks and the bulletproofness of their windows, can they? People want to know the range and capabilities for everyday life, not how it would actually function in a blade runner dystopia."
This has to be fake right?
rip glass
OOOOOFFFFF
Oh my gosh they are failing the demonstration 🤦‍♂️
"Ugh, what a failure."
[deleted]
Elon is flustered lol
I just tuned into the event... is this the truck? That's... interesting.
Truckla for the win so far.
"This still seems like a joke, but when the glass broke I half expected it to self repair after Elon made some comment, I forget what it was now."
I dont watch these live Tesla events are they usually this awkward?
Oh no this is real
Looks like my Pinewood Derby car after it fell off the track a few times.
Sub 3 second 0-60 how in tf
"This feels like a senior design presentation lol

That thing looks like it’s made out of cardboard and spray paint."
Homer's car
why is this going on so long.. wheres the real truck
Goddamn that is cheap
Waiting for the real reveal....
So can we buy the ATV too?
why is the deposit only $100 refundable...
"https://twitter.com/NealsResume/status/1197734594151358464

The memes have begun."
It looks like a delorean blown out by a car bomb
This thing is a tank.
[deleted]
"DUE TODAY
$100
Fully refundable. You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in late 2021. Tri Motor AWD production is expected to begin in late 2022."
Absolute madlad! He really did it this time!
Maybe we will get use to the look. It really juked all expectations
"I will say though, it looks better in the photos on the website than it did in the reveal."
Did they not test the glass before the presentation? It honestly looked planned.
I'm actually more interested in the atv
What does the interior look like?!
They’re definitely going to have to answer the mirror question.
This truck chunks haven’t loaded in yet
"FYI: According to the design website, expect late 2021 for RWD and Dual Motor AWD, late 2022 for Tri Motor AWD"
Designed for the apocalypse ...
I was expecting Master Chief to pop out of that bad boy
"I preordered because no way this is final, but from what I’ve seen this is different enough. If I wanted a standard truck I’d get an F150."
How long until Tesla announces that it’s buying Rivian??
[deleted]
"Imo, ""pure"" Side view is the worst looking one, but front view is pretty good looking"
This is either **love it** or hate it.
"So it looks like the dual motor is end of 2021 and the TRI is end of 2022. Big performance difference between the two, the end of 2021 is going to be the most truest test of adulthood for me. Waiting that year for the ""beast"" version while seeing the first batch of dual motors on the road is going to be really hard."
"Well, it certainly bucks the trend of “looks very aerodynamic and smooth.”

I don’t think it’ll win over the F150 crowd. Lotta money to be made pulling them into all-electric.

Also is that a faux marble dashboard on the website?!?!! Elon.... everyone has moved to quartz"
I can't decide if I love it or hate it.
Any info on how rust resistant this is?  Important for us that live in places where salt is poured all over
But where can I get the ATV?
I love it!
It looks like the APC from Aliens!
No wheel wells in the bed!
I like but...I sadly doubt that....the kinda people that buy trucks....are not going to be into this.
[deleted]
Looks like some shit from Total Recall
What if i want it another color not looking like a apv or tenk?
It looks like it's got plenty blindspots.
So that’s why Elon had a chat with the military.
When did Musk become a game designer for the PS1?
"Is this car safe? Like, isn’t there a reason that cars have crumple zones and aren’t hard as rocks?"
This redesign will cost more then Sonic’s!
The broken windows are an integral part of the Judge Dredd/Robocop dystopian future look they are going for.
My first thought when I saw the truck is that Elon made this vehicle for Mars.
"""Oh my fu--ing god"" see how everybody is talking about it!? PR stunt for sure. They even had the extra glass ready for the fix. On the other hand mybe it wasnt because Elon started to sweat 😂"
Bruh that’s a Halo warthog
"Does it still have sufficient crumple zones? Since it’s so tough, I wonder if it’s like old cars that didn’t break, but you broke when you crashed them"
I want one. I'm gonna have one.
"I think it might have served them better to introduce this as a new class of vehicle as opposed to a ""pick-up truck."" Imagine people didn't know what to expect and then saw the bed cover roll-up. It's cool looking and could draw in customers with those specs. I'm also certain the appearance will grow on all of us. However, thinking of it as a ""pickup truck"" is going to be jarring for a while.

The other possible issue is that it doesn't feel like it's part of the Tesla design family. All the other cars have a common DNA. I think people were looking for a pickup truck with all the benefits of a Tesla that felt like a cousin to a Model S. This feels like it was made by a different company.  


EDIT: The more I think about it, the more I think they could've presented it as a hybrid of the Humvee/Pickup/Jeep market. As I note below, something like a TUV (Truck Utility Vehicle). In fact, I think it will naturally pull people from all three. I'm only speaking of marketing and expectations."
"I’m actually really surprised by everyone’s negative reactions, I think it’s cool as hell and immediately reserved one after the presentation. Sure the presentation was a dumpster fire but Elon has always been horrible at speaking publicly, the windows thing was hilarious. I currently own an F-150 and Ford is making an all-electric F-150, if I wanted an electric pickup that looked exactly like my current truck I’d just wait for that, this thing is completely different than anything else and that is awesome.

Edit: I get that it might just be my personal preferences, but for what it’s worth I do live in middle America and am a truck owner. On the other hand, I live in a modern house, built a [custom 1985 BMW K100](https://imgur.com/gallery/La9Mm) and made it look as futuristic as possible, I loved the concept Husqvarna Vitpilen the moment I laid eyes on it, so I’m very much unto modern design + bleeding edge futuristic concept stuff. My jaw dropped in a good way when that truck rolled onto the stage."
I hope it seats 35
He’s such a bad public speaker I can’t tell if he’s fking around or not. His other presentations where so much better.
"So now all the pics tomorrow are him standing in front of cracked windows too.

On the plus side it doesn't look worse with busted windows."
This feels like an episode of Silicon Valley
I have no idea what I'm watching
how shit that trunk bed action was so fucking sick
The atv looks video game as fuck. In a good way
“Cybertruck order now” yeah right
They’re going to sell 10s of these!
WHAT. JUST. HAPPENED????
"HEPA filters, drives through fire, 220V power.  Dint proof and maybe smash proof windows. Perfect for California."
Love the design. Presentation was horrible. The motortrend article has way more info and presents the product way better.
"They better hire someone to design their presentations. I, like Elon, am not a good speaker, but I would pay someone to design a good presentation. Also, do the glass test offline and show a video, don’t do it live."
"I honestly think they will do some redesigns before the launch. Elon will see the shitstorm of hate from this (and a probable drop in stock price) and do some modifications. Obviously will need to add airbags, safety, side mirrors, etc."
Looks like a result of OpenGL 101 tutorial from 90s: how to create simple 3D figures from triangles.
"This thing wouldn't look out of place on Borderlands. It's a ballsy move, I like it!"
"Honestly, I think we're being trolled."
I fucking *love* it.
"I like it! It’s about time we moved away from this bubbly, rounded look, and back to a more sleek, angular styling.

And even if the photos we’ve seen of it are before rounding it off (a la ultra low polygon count), I still think it looks better than most of the trucks out here these days. And a few of the 2000s ones for that matter."

Please be fake...
"This hurts, make it stop please."
Now the question is how long I’m gonna sit here waiting for the feed to start with the real unveil?
Those door windows not being tempered glass and easily shatterable seems like a pretty major safety concern for emergency exits.
I actually kind of like it.
Some balls on this guy to shit talk the styling of the square-body trucks then immediately rolls out a fuckin' speed square on wheels.
"Remember when Elon used to say the problem with EV's was they were always ""wierd-mobiles?""... well... This is some alice in wonderland weird shit..."
"I remember when I thought the headlights on the Rivian looked pretty weird.

Boy, those were some fun times, right guys?"
"He did say it wasn't for everyone, in my opinion it looks cool as fuck."
"https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/d4tw20/concept_design_for_tesla_cyberpunk_bladerunner/

Didn’t think it would turn out worse than this...."
I think a huge issue is that it just didn't look finished. To me I thought it looked like a cardboard shell. They should have had it painted and the fit and finish at least somewhat presentable. The truck they have in the pre-recorded videos and renders actually looks really cool.
Tesla finally realized their paint jobs are so bad that they're just gonna stop painting cars :p
"I was pretty shocked when I first saw it, it looked strange, but after seeing videos and different angles, I think this thing is going to look bad ass on the road, especially the front angles."
So I heard you key Teslas? Bet you feel fucking stupid now...
"Bruh my glutes gonna look so good hopping out of this thing with nothing but an assless kilt, thong, and biker boots on. 

When the rivers dry up and all the trees of the world die I'm just gonna haul toilet paper between dying cities in this bad boy. They won't even hear me coming because this shit will drive silent. And with it's AWD, speed, and range I'll be able to out run motorcycling highwaymen pretty easily. 

The reason so many people hate this is because they don't see it for what it is: a vehicle for the climate apocalypse. This truck isn't made to haul kids to soccer practice it's made to haul straps to lesbian outposts across the wasteland. It's made to haul boxes of condoms so cisgendered lovers don't have to worry about creating an extra mouth to feed while fucking away the pain of our collective loss. 

This truck is for nihilists. It's for those of us who dream of life after the fall. It's for me."
"People are so focused on the design that I think a lot of important features are being glossed over. 

The ground clearance on this thing is incredible. 16” is more than many modded Jeeps. The flat, armored floor is going to be a huge improvement over current designs, especially for something so long. There are no driveshafts or transfer case to get caught up on rocks. On board air and electric are huge, especially for people who are actually going to use this for real work and not mall crawling. The bed has no wheel well intrusions, which is going to make loading and unloading wide loads massively easier. The presentation said that Autopilot could be used for trailer maneuvering. How cool would it be to have the truck back your boat in by itself, then park itself? Not using paint is going to make production faster and completely negates the toxins and hassles of painting, not to mention no more warranty problems with mismatched color or scratches before delivery. 

There’s some seriously cool, even revolutionary stuff here."
So this is a joke...right?
"I think this looks amazing and has awe inspiring performance.  I understand why some people may hate it, but I think Elon is dragging people into the future.

Does the 2020 F-150 inspire anyone?  As a kid, this would inspire the fuck out of me and it inspires me now.  Makes me exited to be alive, and Ill probably crash first time I see one of these on the road."
"The theory that this is just a publicity stunt is interesting. The truck doesn't even have mirrors and he didn't show the inside. If you're doing an unveiling with this much hype, and you cut it short without showing the interior of the car... what? I've seen concept cars that are closer to production. It's also possible that there was a lot more to this demo and Elon Musk was too flustered after the window shattered so he cut it all short."
"The unveiling summed up: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW63KKSUyU4"
"Cyber look is fine by me, I just hope they make a more utility version of it. I was hoping for:




50' retractable extension cord that can power tools and recharge the truck.



50' air hose for powering tools.



Built in wench that could be quick swapped front or rear with remote control from your phone.



Full size cargo bed that can fit a full 4x8 sheet of plywood.




Cargo bed sides that can fold under the bed, converting it into a flatbed.




Super bright work lights that cover 360 around the truck.



Side access to cargo bed.



Integrated cargo net to automatically secure cargo.



Under tailgate tool drawer.



Interior that is waterproof, with the ability to pressure wash the inside to clean out dirt.



Removable interior back seats, that has enough space to sleep in.



Detachable wireless taillights that are magnetic to attach to trailers.



Red interior lights so that you can read and not loose your night sight.




I like the look, definitely futuristic. The stainless steel is awesome, don't have to worry about paint. I'm sure the windows are an improvement. The specs are over the top and the price is unbelievable, way lower than I thought. I just don't like the bed, if you throw a tool bag in the back, you have to crawl into the bed to get them out. How are you supposed to stack hay in that bed."

"not sure why anybody is surprised or upset about this


he said it was going to look cyberpunk


it looks cyberpunk as fuck


the specs are fucking insane and the price pre-incentive compared to other trucks is unbelievable"
Elon has to be fucking trolling. This truck looks like hot garbage. Rivian sales gonna go through the roof now.
WTF HES TALKING AND ITS BROKEN BEHIND HIM
tfw an atv looks better than your actual truck
"oh shit.  $40 is RWD, $50k is AWD and $70k is plaid tri motor"
"The capability is going to sell some people, but man, you drink with your eyes first and this is going to take some getting used to. People are going to be so off put by the design its not going to be a big seller."
That was painful. The ATV was cool at least. I’ll take four.
The truck is amazing but that presentation was crap. And I am stunned that he did not talk about the plans to use this truck on Mars.
"This thing isn’t going to be well received.... at first.  

But he built the damn thing so durable it will eventually pull interest."
LOL! The pre order website crashed
"It's quickly growing on me. It looks like a 21st-century DeLorean, and it isn't as gaudy (large) as a modern truck."
"Couple of thoughts:

Regarding the glass breaking, is it possible that when the prototype was built they installed the glass backwards (breakable on outside and unbreakable on inside?) I mean isn't it a safety precaution to be able to break the glass and get out?

Also, for how unyielding the door panel was, if the rest of the truck is like that what does that mean for crumple zones and crash safety?

And lastly, what % of people can fit this into a garage to charge it? Our garage can barely fit our minivan that is a bit over 202 inches, this is 3 feet longer than that."
"Welp, I guess it definitely wasn’t a joke. It’s the roof that comes to that weird sharp point and that’s really throwing me off. The more angles I see of it the less I hate it but wow, this is going to take some getting used to. Price is actually incredibly reasonable all things considered but I’m not sure it’s enough to attract enough buyers to make this profitable. I know Elon said he doesn’t care if this truck makes money but he is running a company with shareholders who expect profit, we’ll see though. All together a very strange event, the atv was unexpected and almost felt like a strange afterthought but nice I guess. An X and S refresh announcement would’ve been ideal to smooth things over a bit with the trucks controversial design but oh well"
I love it. I’m preordering it. But it’s definitely not a truck. It’s like a wrangler or a hummer. I think that’s what’s really pissing people off: they were promised a truck and were basically given an off road vehicle.
"And I couldn't help but feel he cut it short because he was visibly upset over the glass. It felt so unfinished, he must have gone off script and wanted to just get off the stage."
Elon didn't do anything wrong trying to improve weak wimpy windows. He just finally realized his balls were one size too big...
It’s kinda weird how the car has no Tesla logos. At least I haven’t seen any.

"WTF I love it.

Am I understanding correctly that it comes with compressed air supply for running tools?

I'm hoping the photos mean some of the matching product concepts get made. I like the camper ideas, the quad bike, all of it really.

The aesthetic works because they went all the way, no half measure."

"The longer I look at it the more I love it. I'm very sorry but that's my new dream car. I *always wanted to feel like an astronaut whenever I go to buy toilet paper.

And I'm not ashamed of that."
"Does anyone else think this is more of a failure of branding than a failure of design?

By setting it up as an F150-killer, Elon set certain expectations in our mind.  And when it didn't meet traditional pickup truck expectations, a lot of people balked.

HOWEVER, if he didn't set it up to compete against something it's not (trad truck) it would stand on it's own really well.  Specs are mad great.

For example: Imagine if the branding was **""We are going to start selling the Mars UAV, nonpressurized edition.  Preorders open Thursday.""** When he revealed it, people would have freaked out to get to own a Mars rover and drive it on earth.

As an F150 competitor, it falls pretty flat.  But as the only Mars Rover on the market, it's out of this world."

I don’t know if it’s so ugly it’s cute of just plain awful.
"I personally like the design, but totally totally understand how it would be really off putting to others. That ATV was sexy though."
[deleted]
I think it's dope
did they take down the live stream? I cannot watch it anymore
I'm thinking they might have used a simple geometry for the body to reduce production costs with this new material.
"The site is showing overload on orders as two ""too many requests"" popped up. Finally got my money in. 

Total game changer!"
It’s pre-production and probably their first working prototype. Definitely rushed to unveil it in “November 2019.” I can’t see it looking so square in production lmao. I will buy that ATV in a heartbeat though.
"The cybertruck is... odd? I was unsure of what to really think of it. I came to the conclusion that I like it and gives me rugged overlander vibes.

I feel that for hunters and such this rig could be amazing. Its completely silent obviously no engine, and it has good range. Add the fact in you can probably fit it with solar panels and such and the storage it has plus it being so bullet proof (just not the windows haha) it will handle well in outdoors terrains and will probably be succesful as a multiday camper even.

It seats six people and I assume the inside is very minimalistic and similair to some GMC trucks where you can flip the inside center console into another seat by the front.

The ATV at the end caught me off guard and I think it's amazing. It reinforces the hunting style to me because of the noise levels of such transportation. Obviously the fact that all this instant torque will make it fun to drive both the truck and the ATV the fact is, I kept thinking to hunting over how good this system will be. Capable, hopefully comfortable and quite.

Still unsure how I feel on the triangular design and how much room the back passengers will have because of the slope. I'm guessing it will be similair to a gle coupe or bmw x6 which felt comfortable to me, being 6ft

If I could afford one I would buy one."
Model 3 interior so still no screen behind steering wheel
"Also on the ball drop test, when the dude was at the highest point, the glass was not held down by the clamps... the 2 quickly clamped it down."

I thought the truck was going to be able to swim underwater!!! Damnit Elon!
Was there any mention of when it will be  available?

"Ok, so directly from the side (the main angle of the presentation lol) it looks fukkin weird. But looking at the other angles it’s starting to grow on me. 

Looks very cool from the front, the back is cool too, I don’t like the peak right in the middle though from the side."
So we can't post until this megathread discussion is over?
"it honestly looks like what I imagine a pick up truck would look like if it were designed by Lamborghini. I don't know how to feel. The worst is definitely the huge lift gate in the rear, it's just a lot. How will you ever see behind you?

They mention offering vinyl wrap if you want colours? Alright sure. 

It's edgy, it's different. I feel like the design team said well, if we make a truck that looks like all other trucks neither the EV crowd will like it and truck diehards will never change their mind no matter what it looks like because it's EV. I don't know what had to happen after that, though."
That was the actual truck. I doubt there’s an “actual” truck to be revealed because after the livestream on their website there was an “Order Now” button.
Is there a recorded version of the livestream already? I missed the live one
I really think a rounded top would really help this thing
"Honestly, I love it but would never buy it. On paper, it’s a ton of value compared to anything else, including the Rivian."
Take a drink every time he says “yeah”
where are the side mirrors?
"Well, this was the prototype. I wish and hope things change before delivery. I was ready to trade in my S for the truck but now not so much. I love the specs, the quad everything other than the design. So I hope this stays as the prototype. Maybe make a handful of them to appease the loyal followers. Then make a practical, daily driver. The head lights are awesome, the ramp built into the tail gate is awesome. The sliding roof/bed cover, I could see some problems in a Canadian winter.

Elon, I like the concept, and I’ll be buying a Tesla truck, just maybe not the cyber truck."
What is the wading depth of the car?  I live in a city that floods and the glass roof is ideal for an amphibious vehicle side hustle.
"As a Canadian, my reservation was through the link re-direction after the live stream.  
It's the US site.  Does that matter?"
"I doubt this is indicative of anything but the pre-order agreement does say ""You understand that Tesla may not have completed the development of Cybertruck or begun manufacturing Cybertruck at the time you entered into this Agreement"" so I wonder if the truck will be slightly different from the prototype?"
What about the atv?
What happened to the side mirrors?  Turned into some camera/screen inside?
Looks like something 007 would have to place a tracking beacon on to finish secret agent mode on N64. Dear god...
"I'm glad that there's not much fuss over what happened with the glass here. Yeah, it didn't go to plan. But at best, they'll work to improve durability before shipping, at worst it'll still be more durable than that of other vehicles on the road whilst offering a lot of other benefits (price + performance etc).

My only concern with the glass is on the other end of the scale. Where making it more durable poses problems for emergency services who sometimes smash windows to recover crash victims or to gain optimal access to fire hydrants when vehicles are illegally parked.

Otherwise, I think it's a great vehicle and I would buy one if I had that kind of cash!"

This truck pulling an Airstream trailer is the ultimate design oxymoron.

This reminds me of one of the vehicles they built in Top gear. The exterior is just a pile of sheet metal.
"Is this an out of season april fools joke? I feel like theres a real truck design they will release in about a week, theres no way they can be serious about this. And the glass shattering? Come on, they would have to have tried that beforehand"

Why did they break with Tesla’s design language like that? They could’ve made an amazing looking truck...
"General consensus is it’s ugly. Okay, couldn’t agree more. 

-	Now it’s also mighty strong
-	Has the largest charging infrastructure 
-	highest ground clearance
-	mighty range(even compared to other EV trucks)
-	Beats current and future prices for ICE and EV trucks 
-	Has features very convenient to truck owners(no need for a generator and an inbuilt loading ramp)
-	Comes with what is the most promising and actually existing commercially available autopilot system 
-	A superb lighting system, including bed lighting as well"
Probably the coolest looking truck ever. It'll grow on the disbelievers.
Huh. I must be the only one who thinks it looks awesome? Incredible
This explains why there were no leaks -- all the employees were horrified at these designs getting out!
"Dammit, the ugly bish's design is growing on me.  The hell?"
You know every rappers gonna be flexing these in music videos. Every celeb will have one. All the top tech execs will get one. It’s gonna work out for Tesla.
Hey I drew this when I was 6!
"Elon was clearly having a panic attack after the windows shattered. ""ohmyfuckinggod"" lol"
"That design is going to get scrapped or massively overhauled. It's just too much.

The price point is incredible so it may still sell okay as is, but they are shooting themselves in the foot if they don't put out a non goofy looking version with the same specs."
"On paper it's pretty good. 

But trucks are all about the little things. 

* Can it do a rack?

* Can it do a camper?

* Can you change the wheel torque (to mimic a differential)?

* What's the range while towing?

* How do you access the back of the bed?

* Depth perception in vehicle?

* How does it do with an RV, horses and boats?

* Is it safe?

* Roll over potential?"
[deleted]
"By the time this hits the road the opinions on the looks of this truck will change big time, this exact same thing happened with the ford Sierra which is the last time we saw such a change from the norm."
"I immediately put down a deposit. 

UTILITY: People are complaining about “utility”. I think there’s a tremendous amount of it. I dirt bike, surf, camp, go off roading, mountain bike etc... That corrugated sliding bed cover door is brilliant. I can’t lock valuables in the bed of a truck without a camper shell or tonneau cover. I can’t use the bed for dirt biking or other bulky items without removing the camper/cover (which is a huge pain in the ass). The integrated tailgate ramp and adaptive air suspension are also totally awesome. Way easier to get the bike or other heavy items in the back. You can air back up the tires on the truck or your toys with ease. 

OFF ROAD: From a serious off roading perspective, I’m guessing this thing is going to absolutely blow the doors off every full sized truck in the category (including the raptor, but there’s no word on suspension travel or damping quality yet) and other best in class off roaders like the wrangler and 4Runner. The ground clearance is insane with the 4 wheel independent suspension. You can’t get close to 16” of GC with a straight rear axel. I think this is close to the same clearance the H1 had which is a huge part of what made it phenomenally capable.  The approach and departure angles are also amazing. The break over angle (primarily driven by the wheelbase) might not be stellar. A note on some of the feedback I’ve seen regarding the “long wheelbase”; because there’s not a clearly delineated cab and bed, the wheelbase probably looks a lot longer than it actually is. I’m guessing this truck has nearly the same wheelbase as other full size crew cab short bed truck in the market. “Tiny bed” also not a fact. 6’ +/- 6” is the industry standard, unless you get a long bed option (which they don’t even offer in half ton crew cab trucks, and is not too common in heavy duty). Gobs of torque applied to specific wheels with the most traction though what I’m sure will be highly advanced vectoring software and sensors will also make this thing in all likelihood the best off-the-shelf full size off roader by a large margin. They’ll start doing comparison tests with this thing and other market leaders and it will put them to shame, I guarantee it. The specs and math are there. 

LOOKS: The model S and 3 are just similar very well designed versions of other cars in their respective categories. As the model 3 becomes even more ubiquitous (I live in costal CA), it will become the next Prius. Nothing special. I think Tesla recognized this and wanted to do something truly innovative in exterior design to maintain that innovative brand identity as tons of well designed all electric vehicles in lots of categories are coming from most major automakers in the near future. This was Elon saying “I scared you into going electric, now I’m going to scare you into taking real design risk”. There was a post a while back that where someone photoshopped different brand badges on other cars (e.g. Honda badges on an E Class Mercedes and it looked like an accord). Not going to happen here. Current full size truck design is truly uninspired. In the late 90’s Ford started making trucks look like cars. Everyone love it. There was a pendulum swing to “tougher looking trucks” which is really just been ford and GM designing huge boxy derpy front clips. It’s lame. I’m guessing if/when these things show up on the streets, people will think “holy shit, that’s insane”, which is what the full size truck (especially HD) is trying to achieve now. 

LUXURY / COMFORT: Its a Tesla. It’s going to have tons of rad tech bells and whistles, drive itself and be really nice and minimalistic on the inside. Get in any other high end trim full size and you feel like you’re at the controls of a commercial airliner. Too many buttons. 

Well I’m super late to this post, and I doubt anyone reads it. Probably just a cathartic exercise to justify my desire for the most off the wall vehicle to sniff mass production in decades."

I feel like Elon should have just stopped the presentation when the glass broke and asked for the sledge hammer and beat the shit out of the truck and made it part of the show
"All a sudden, rivian trucks look very gender-neutral to me. Idk if it's good or bad."
"On the absolute cringefest that was this unveiling:

Most people wont see most of it.  Everyone will see the broken window fuck up  yes, but beyond that, people will learn about the truck from pictures and articles.  So while it seems super weird that they didn't show the truck more, the pictures do that."
"god damn.

""You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in late 2021. Tri Motor AWD production is expected to begin in late 2022.""

that's a fucking long ways away"
Looks like a video game truck that didn’t finish rendering
Initially I didn't like the design but the more I looked at it the more it grew on me. I put the $100 deposit on the entry level one but hopefully they work out the kinks with the glass.  The utility seems amazing and a variation of this truck is supposed be on Mars so that's pretty frickin cool.
"If they just got rid of the triangle and straightened out the top, it would already do wonders for it's aesthetics."
You can have any color as long as it's stainless steel.

How are you supposed to be able to reach anything in the bed???
"I've never used or wanted a pickup truck and was mostly watching out of curiosity. Can someone who actually uses pickup trucks answer this? How important is it to be able to access the bed from the sides? Is the unusual shape of the cybertruck bed with the tall angled side panels going to be a problem?

I really wish the presentation would have shown more of the functionality of the bed."
just want to remind everyone elon said he knew it was going to be most likely to edgy for the majority of people and they were going to make a mainstream one later
[deleted]
"You know what looks wrong? The downslope of the bed. Cut it, put it flat like a regular truck you're gold."
Waiting for my alarm to wake me up from this nightmare.
It would look a lot better if they removed the angled part on the back and just make it stick straight out like a normal truck bed.
"Love it, looks like a late 80s lambo."
"Unfortunately Elons presentations have been pretty bad lately... The semi one was awesome, the model y was ok (his presenting skills were great) though lacking in details, but the most recent starship update and the truck inveil were short, awkward, and poorly prepared for."
"Never thought I be excited for a truck, I guess it helps that this does not look boring."
"It's definitely a Pontiac Aztek-esque design, but it also looks like something I'd expect to see in Prometheus. I'm not a fan of the weird triangular shape in the middle, but it overall does look like something from Blade Runner.

The specs and technology in it are pretty incredible, though. I'm a fan of the variable suspension, that's clever to lower it during highway-speeds and towing to improve stability. I expected it would have high mileage because it's gigantic, but I was still surprised by the 500+ mile range, albeit it costs $70,000 and won't come out for almost three years.

Weird as it looks, at least Tesla is doing something different and bringing new ideas (besides the design) to the auto-market."
"At least you can't key it!

Amazing how polarizing the design is."
do they have any hopes of selling this in Europe? i'm pretty sure it would be impossible to conform to pedestrian safety regulations with all those acute angles and sharp und pointy bits.
"The truck look is growing on me. The hardest part to accept is the rear sloping roofline that extends so far out. I think they should have started with the rear of the car and showed the fact that it's a rear door that opens up to unveil the truck bed. Makes clear that this is there for a purpose.


Besides the strange roofline, the presentation really was at best a bit akward to watch. It seemed like it wasn't rehearsed, Elon was missing points, people were dressed cyberpunk but it felt a little out of place. It wasn't very cohesive either. Things could have a gone a lot better on the presentation, it didn't hit home on being informative, nor did it home on it's CYBERTRUCK show.

That said I love the features of the truck and the more shots I see of it from different angles the more I am liking it."
Its fucking sick placed the order oh my god
"Normal vehicle manufacturers: *We can't make cars look too sci-fi, otherwise no one will buy them. Its too risky.*
Elon Musk: *Hold my super-juice in my no-grav coffee mug.*"
LOVE how dystopian it looks.
Looks like the biggest advantage to owning one is you don't have to look at it when you're inside of it.
"I kept waiting for them to pull away the fake outside cover of the truck so that you could see the real truck underneath.

This looks like it was designed by Homer Simpson."
"Dear lord I’m starting to understand why most Cars and trucks all look so fucking bland, you guys are ridiculous. 

This truck is sexy af I’ve been hoping for a vehicle that looks like this since before I could drive...I can’t afford this but man this is my dream car."
Finally a good match for Autopilot. This thing should go through medians and semis no problem.
I am beyond excited! I'm gonna have a beer while watching this 😉
Will it be streaming on YouTube?
Official YT Stream: https://youtu.be/NcROXiN_cdE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcROXiN_cdE here is a direct link to the livestream.
t-30 min
no sound for me....lights look sick though
"YouTube shows 122,000 people watching, and climbing rapidly.

Edit: 134k

Lighting already better than model y reveal
Fr Elon is a Daddy
LMFAOOO
You gotta be kidding. Really??
Looks right out of tomb raider
"OMG, we're dead. That's a cyber TANK!"
lol why
Please tell me this is a joke LMAO
This is fake
no way lmao
SHIT. WTF
lol... has to be a joke..
Is that really what it is going to look like?
Oh no no no no...
Did they make this using PS1 polygons?
That thing is UUUUUGLY!!!!!
How long is he going to keep this up...please no
A face only a mother could love.
Man elon...why......
Looks like a 2 year old’s drawing come to life
I'm not sure this is going to sell as well as he thinks it will sell
Is this a joke and they are gonna bring the real truck out soon?
Wait please be a joke
Wtf is that? Lmfao. This is a joke for sure.
I feel like a shell is going to come off to show the actual truck
Elon has finally lost it.
"Haha I thought I was going to hate it for all the reasons you all thought you were going to love it, and I love it for all the reasons you hate it."
It’s hideous. I’m so glad I prepared myself for this looking terrible.
They fked this up so hard lol
I stayed up for that? That has to be a joke.
If you’re gonna build a time machine you might as well build it with some style
LMAO $HORT T$LA. That shit is ugly af
Without a bed it doesn’t do the things a truck needs to do..
Fuck
Elon is terrible at this
[deleted]
He fell in love with stainless steel and it's gone to his head.
"Ok, down from 90% to 66%. 

I still think 2:1 that he's kidding. But I think that might be the actual truck."
I think he is joking....
"I'm going to sleep. This cybertruck is shit. It's gonna be a giant fail unless there's some realistic changes. 

No one in their right mind will want to buy or drive that. Visibility is probably not that good, rear sight is probably shit as well. 

Everything about it is cringey as fuck and too ridiculous to even bother anymore."
At least it's built San Francisco Tough™
"Well, oops"
oops...
LMFAO
# I CAN'T WATCH THIS ANYMORE
AWKWARRD\~!
Lmfao was that not part of the plan. Oh man
"Ok, not quite hail proof lol."
I stayed awake for this? Lol.
Cancel this shit show rn lmaooooo
"Well, at least it'll be pretty hard to key it....?"
Somebody didn't get the message to put the armor glass on the demo lol
"ok this is definitely a joke at this point, they will roll out the real one at some point after they have a few more ""fails."""
"Nice glass demo LMAO, can't even market materials some other company developed, this is like a middle school presentation"
IS THIS AN SNL SKIT?
Did they just want to meet the November 2019 deadline cuz this is sad
It’s very different in looks. It looks a lot like a Star Trek Shuttle.
oh man now he's sweating
Oh no... Trucks are the fastest selling thing in the US. You didn't need to go this route with it. Maybe different angles might change my mind but this thing is very odd
Can Tesla pull a Sonic the Hedgehog and fix it after the feedback?
SELL SELL SELL
This is hard to watch lol
You can tell he's rattled about the broken windows
"Oh my god, this is insane"
Oh god it’s the real truck
"Impressive af specs, I expected no less. I definitely expected them to give a shit about the design though"
This is rough lol
I think Franz might have used the bigger of the two balls
Can you make 500+ miles an options for all the cars?
"Cool, he really did listen to the tip one guy suggested on Twitter to be able to use the truck as an air compressor."
Okay. That price is pretty tits.
What in the goddamn...
where are the autopilot cameras? This thing gotta be fake.
those fucking windows lmao
Canyonarooooo!
It looks like a lego piece

Weird how they’re not gonna show the inside of the truck...
How much is the ATV? I’ll buy that
"https://mobile.twitter.com/TESLAcharts isn't even tweeting right now

Kind of disappointed"
Absolute mad lad
"You guys, please no! DEAR GOD NO!"
Oh my god look at the suspension...
I'm....not sure what to think...
updated Hummer
"Well, this thing'll definitely be a head-turner!"
I want one. Really want to see the interior.
It looks more like a Hummer than a truck.
Great for mowing down zombies... they'll fly right over the windshield.
This will be perfect for my Cyberpunk LARP group.
The Cybertruck page crashed from so much traffic
Quick! Someone photoshop the cybertruck to look like the back to the future time machine!
I actually kind of like the design. I'd have it painted/wrapped like the Mako.
The specs are fantastic
Any test drive videos?
I wonder what the excuse for the broken windows will be.
*Turns on Blade Runner
"What was the deposit required on Model Y? Doesn’t $100 seem super low for this thing to be legit?

I actually think the design is neat but I’d prefer less of a wedge shape. I put in the preorder for the tri motor but this all feels odd."
"I'm not really the target market, but if you can get by with seating for 6 this is actually a way better value for what it delivers than the Model X."
"thing looks insane, in a good way"
"The design immediately reminded me of the FSB truck car thingy, ZIL Punisher. [This thing.](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F86%2F68%2Fc0%2F8668c00cdb4ee523d9954166d0f4b88f.jpg&f=1&nofb=1) From [the side.](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fkresy.pl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F02%2F0a0227e8ecb94b278579ff16c4b4cbc0.-1030x579.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)"
this is the 2020 version of a hummer
Why they got the Kobe 2s on the stage?
Anyone want to guess how the markets are going to react tomm?
"I have a question about the stainless steel body...will we be able to get other colors? Also, if it just the plane stainless steel, how will that take a keying that we see happen all the time to the 3s? Does it show up?"
"Was wanting an F250/2500 competitor, not a F150/1500 competitor. Mainly for towing. And I’m hoping the look grows on me over 3 years. 
As someone who does about 50k miles a year in our work trucks, things I want are:
Step-bar, center console for paperwork, cup holders, etc., easier access to the bed to reach tools/gas cans/etc.
What I’m excited about and wanted:
Adjustable suspension, air compressor(can fix flat trailer tires on the side of the road now). 
Still pre-ordered"
It looks like a perfect fit for a low poly world
I made a reservation with Apple Pay but never got an email and didn’t note down the reservation number myself. How do I check on my reservation?
At least we won't have to listen to people talking about how radical the Rivian headlights are.  Cybertruck is going to run cover for all future radical product designs.
I remember this GTA 1 Mod
Is there a link to actually watch it?
The design is an early adopter filter to keep scaling capital costs down ;)
Personally I love the 80s sci-fi look and theme he went with. I’m a Diesel Colorado owner and this truck is super tempting to me especially given its tow rating along with its performance. I am curious about the ability to put a gooseneck hitch in the bed though.
"I see that it can parallel park with 360 cameras and use of sonar as well, but does this mean that autopilot and enhanced will be an allowed feature?"
Where can I find a replay of the live even that isn't a super choppy mess?  Every youtube replay is a choppy mess...as was the live feed.
"-Big Tesla fan. 
-Future owner. 
-Not a fan of the styling of this truck, maybe if/when I see it in person it could change, but should’ve gone more traditional"
"Towing capacity of 300,000lbs? Jesus fucking Christ Elon."
"I might try to do a render with a roll bar in the back. Something that can mount a ladder (or other long equipment or lumber) even with the top of the cabin. Pipe construction, mounted in four places. 

I think it will *greatly improve the aesthetics of the truck with some added functionality. It just seems like something is missing in the back of the truck."
"There’s been a trend in truck design to make them “stand out” from the other trucks over the years. This maybe goes further than a lot of truck drivers will want, but given Tesla’s production capacities compared to Ford, they still won’t have a problem meeting demand."
Looks like something from the original Total Recall
I want to see a render of it with cooler wheels
How can they sell this so cheap while a similarly performing Model X is 2x the cost? The battery cost alone doesn't make sense
"There's an old saying in Tennessee I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee that says, shatter me once shame on - shame on you. Shatter me - you can't get shattered again 🤡"
"Putting aside the looks, are there technical problems with the way this truck looks?
Anything that would hinder its ability to haul cargo?
I mean this is a car with a purpose. Not just to looking pretty. 
Never drove a truck so I’m asking."
There was a sale on stainless steel and Elon couldn't refuse.
Pretty sure I used to draw that car as a kid all the time.
How is this three motor configuration going to work? One drive motor for each rear wheel and another for the front axle?
Just caught myself up on this - apparently Elon and FRanz broke the bullet proof glass?  Anyone hav ea good video on that?  LOL
"Looks dope. 

How to firefighters extract you after you've had an accident though? Or do you never crash?"
Ooof stocks down almost 7% today.
"I asked my three year old son if he likes this truck. After thinking for a minute, he kind of laughed and said, ""It's too pointy."" Haha.

I'm split on it. I like that they did something different and the concept behind it. I'm not sure I like this specific design."
"I'm picturing my femoral artery getting sliced open the first time I walk around the bed while the tailgate is down...

[https://i.imgur.com/vOr9qSC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vOr9qSC.jpg)"
"This can't be the real thing, can it? I mean, who was asking for a mass market ""armored"" electric truck? Don't get me wrong, I love the specs and price points, but ""sledgehammer resistant"" doors and ""unbreakable windows that break during the demo"" is not something I was looking for in my daily driver."
"I like the idea of a vehicle with a cyberpunk-esque design language. However, this is a very poor version of it. That being said, I can see the potential and with some tweaks in the design, this'll look pretty cool. But for now, it's a fail for me purely from an aesthetic point of view."
"Oof. This is a very polarizing design for sure. I personally hate it. But hey, design is subjective."
It's either a wedge designed from the 80s or a pinewood derby car a father made for his son.
Looks like a jacked up delorean. I'm sure it would be great in a new back to the future movie.
It looks like the spawn of a Delorean and an Aztek!
"Quick question for anyone still lurking. 

With a reinforced metal that doesn't dent or bend at all, in the case of a car crash wouldn't the person take all that energy and the car wouldn't take any? Isn't that why the other Tesla cars are nice, because instead of a full front filled with an engine and whatnot, it's empty and a huge crumple zone? 

Thanks"
pontiac aztec: truck edition
Tesla works because it takes a radically new powertrain and makes it look like a regular car. No regular consumer in the market for a pick up is going to buy this and drive it to work
"How the hell do you even reach anything in the bed of the truck with that weird ass angle on the body, especially something up against the cab?"
Will every person that gets into an accident with a Cybrtrk just like die?
How can this be a forward thinking/futuristic design when it was designed to look like it's from an 80s movie?
I would drive the shit out of that. Its definitely polarizing but damn people would notice that truck driving around.
[seems like a vulnerability](https://youtu.be/w3Ue3ZD-6vo)
"I like that they're trying to redefine what a truck can be, but god, it looks awful lol"
"Watched with excitement last night.

Was stunned when this thing pulled out.  

It looks like a crazy prototype from an international car show that would either never see the real road or would be changed dramatically for production.  The design is simply unpalatable.  All other aspects regarding range, function, and price were home runs."
The new Aztek is even uglier than the old one.
"I’m disappointed. As a truck (F-150) owner, I was looking forward to a competitive design that would give internal combustion trucks some serious competition. However, this design is far too different to attract existing truck owners to consider a Tesla. I doubt that many Ford/Dodge/GM/Chevy/Toyota/Nissan truck owners would add this truck to their list when considering their next purchase."
That's so ugly it should be illegal
Wait....this is actually real? Cmon man. CMON
"I like the design but im also a huge scifi nerd, looks like a truck for your space ship, the cringe was def entertaining until the glass then it hurt"
He has to be joking right? This thing is atrocious and the entire presentation was so campy.
What the fuck just happened?
The styling would almost be acceptable if they dropped the roof line below the window in the back to form the truck bed. This triangle thing isn't working.
"The order site is a bunch of half assed renders

Seems like they weren't ready for this at all"
If they can push this out for under 40k I’m sure we could get something in the car family sub-35k within the next 10 years.
"From a truck stand point, it’s incredible. But it’s just so... ugly"
"I just wanted an all electric pickup, that takes advantage of that fact. This definitely does the second part, but I don't know if I can get behind the way it looks. I guess I will wait and see what Ford does with the electric F-150"
"I applaud Tesla for their originality but I don't mind the design because I'm a sci-fi fan. To be honest, if people don't like sci-fi, don't use their pickup as a truck, and don't want to stray from the norm then I don't see them ever liking the truck. Those who want a real truck will probably be willing to overlook the design and cyberpunk fans will love it even if they don't need a truck.

Genuinely do wish I could drive this thing through a dystopia though."
"Not only am I pissed I stayed up to watch that, but now I won't be able to sleep because that thing will haunt my dreams."
"We live in an age of RTX Titans and Ryzen Threadrippers, surely we can load a couple more polygons on to the cybertruck...."
I’m a fan. Looks futuristic and rugged.
"Check the pics and vid here look better then presentation and more pics of camper trailer and tent back
https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck"
"I personally think it's extremely cool that he went for the DeLorean stainless steal and premium tough materials but I don't understand how he can possibly sell this profitably at $40-50k.

Also the glass was always going to be an iffy gimmick, not surprised that it failed today."
Design is wacky but the specs are decent. Shame the windows broke but actual bulletproof glass exists so they'll have something tougher on the real thing. The bigger issue is the PR nightmare but they have 2 years to fix that before it goes on general sale.
The design was jarring but its growing on me. I am sure there will be more refinements done. All those weird af drawings and renderings that people laughed  at were pretty close lol
"$100 down, $49,800 more to go... Can’t wait to see how this thing changes over the next few years."
"I don t need a truck but I see totally the reasons for the design. I am more interested in the crash results. If the frame is ultra solid, what happens in a head on or back or side collision when the metal doesn t bend? Those Newtons of force have to go somewhere."
I actually don't mind the front or even side profile. It's the back that is just horrendous. I think it's because there's so much blank space.
"Now I'll just wait for Doug DeMuro to show me all its ""quirks and features""."
what the cinnamon toast fuck
"Oh, so we’re going with THAT aesthetic for the future here in the darkest timeline."
"Great Specs, design barf."
JFC This is an ugly vehicle. Who is the target demo? This seems to be marketed more towards weebs than bluecollar customers.
that thing is hideous...
"Oh my, this is going to break /r/cringe."
Holy shit. This is going to be everywhere tomorrow. He spent all that time talking so much shit about other trucks... this is textbook cringe AHHHH what a disaster
"When you stop thinking of is as a pickup truck and rather a beast of a utility vehicle, it's pretty cool."
Is this a joke? I kept waiting for Elon to pull the dummy cover off the truck. It is absolutely hideous. No way I'd consider buying this.

"The price is insane for a pickup, can't beat it. Good luck selling that style though. It's like he's trying to revive the fucking Delorean for Master Chief. Personally I'm terrified thinking about having to share the road with this thing... and even worse, the parking lot. Imagine getting your door dinged by some 30x rolled steel."
Am I the only one who was extremely uncomfortable when the glass broke? Then they did it again. I was embarrassed for them. Will be interesting to see what they do to recover from that fail.
I love the way it looks and I want one real bad.
My first impression was this thing is fugly!! But by the end of the presentation i was really digging it. I plopped down my $100. I love the price. Tesla is a great company. I want this beast in my house now!
"I love Tesla, but what the hell is this? _/ \_"
"Sorry everyone 

This is the ugliest damn thing I've ever seen in the automotive world."
"Looks aside, this truck poses no threat whatsoever to the established players as far as being an actual utility vehicle. My thoughts:

The sloped bed rails make it impossible to fit a 5th wheel trailer. Those need to be ahead of the rear axle, and in this instance you would need to put it right on the tail end to have turning clearance. Also, 5th wheel hitches are attached to the frame, which brings my next point:

Unibody (er, exoskeleton) design sucks for trucks. As Musk said, on a regular truck the bed is ""just bolted on cargo"", and he's right. That's the point. Because if I want a flatbed, I just bolt it on. I want a cube, a tilt bed, convert to a tow truck, a cherry picker, utility box, whatever, just bolt it on. It's built for it. Trucks are work vehicles, meant to be converted, and the Cybertruck cannot do any of these things.

Further to this, even with the 3500lb bed capacity, if you took your Cybertruck to the landscape supply store to get some gravel and that loader hits your bed rails denting them, the repair costs skyrocket, even possibly making the vehicle a write-off because the ""stressed skin"" is integral to the structure. Granted it is tough-as-hell skin, but if it gets hit hard enough... A traditional truck, you replace the bed, or ignore it, whatever it's not a critical part. Also, if a load is dropped unevenly, the bed will twist and deflect that force from your frame. Wrecked box, driveable truck. Twist the bed of the Cybertruck and that's a write-off.

Now, I'm not saying that there is no market for this truck. People like me who want a big truck and are fully aware they have no need for a truck but don't want to consume generations of dinosaurs just to do it will think this is great. But, if I were forced to buy a truck today, I'd consider a unibody Honda Ridgeline, which isn't even a blip on the truck sales radar compared to the Big 3.

If anything, Ford is thrilled at this announcement because it will have zero impact whatsoever on their existing ICE sales, and their electric F150 is more capable as a work truck than this."
no one is buying that
Still waiting for this to be a joke. This is a joke right??
This is a nightmare. Nightmare. Nightmare. RIP all our calls
I thought he was trolling but I think this is actually it.
Please tell me this an extremely elaborate joke
"That unveil was terrible. BUT....go on the website and it looks a lot more appealing.

But that's an ugly truck. But holy shit it looks like it has some functionality, and people could get very creative with how to use it."
Elon let his long lost brother come in a design the Cyber Truck?!? I have seen this plot before...
Tesla Design Team: https://ibb.co/chS2Y5L
It's hilarious how everyone was talking about how truck buyers only care about functionality leading up to the event...
"Everyone should check out tesla.com/cybertruck before coming down too hard on this truck, it does look better there than the poorly finished one they had on stage.  Check out the trailer and the camping setup too.  I'm still pretty damn skeptical, but it's not quite as bad as it seems.  The low quality presentation is hurting quite a bit."
Did this really just happen? Musk has lost his freakin mind!
"Honestly fuck what it looks like, if it outperforms everything for cheaper idgaf

^^^plus ^^^I ^^^think ^^^it ^^^looks ^^^cool"
HOW IS IT MORE UGLY THAN THE CONCEPTS
"Shocking to see so many people in a Tesla community that can't handle change. This is drastic fucking change and I love it. The interior shots look really cool, the glass roof is damn sexy as hell. I love this and will be selling my S to get a TRI motor for sure.   


I assume there will only be one color due to the material?"
"Elon has to be the worst presenter of any major company. Seriously, get Franz or just anybody else out there. And tell the idiots in the audience to shut up for 10 seconds."
"Funny reading the comments where people are talking about weirdness of the looks of Cybertruck and the event.

Weren't these guys listening to what Elon and Tesla had being saying since the first time it was announced. It's going to be crazy. Not for everyone's liking but something that will stand out. Also, yes it's a goddamn Cybertruck. Inspired by Blade runner. If nothing else, the date should have been a giveaway."
"Laughing at all the comments saying it's ugly and a failure. Does the market need another ""normal"" truck? Do typical Tesla owners want a truck at all? Musk isn't trying to out-Ford the Ford F-150, he's exploring a new niche, and he'll find plenty of buyers there. We can already see that there is a substantial demographic of people who find this concept cool and are bored with old-school trucks."
I like it... but clearly I’m in the minority here.
I think that all electric F-150 is gonna do just fine on the market now.
I wasn’t online when this came out and was surprised to show up and everyone really disliking it.  I think it looks like the future.  We knew it was going to be unexpected looking
Well at least Aztec owners won't own the ugliest car anymore.
"Fucking Ford, GM, Ram breathe a loud sigh of relief."
"Not sure why everyone is crying. I love it.  Ever since it was teased, I pictured something out of a sci fi film. This hit it perfectly.. angles and striped lighting.. hard cold material colours.  Mmm."
[deleted]
I'm cancelling my order for my 3.  People are going to start shooting at Teslas now.
The truck looks like a video game truck with the graphics settings turned all the way down
Reserved. Never wanted something so ugly in my whole life.
"The stats are amazing, which make this all the more infuriating. If they had even made a basic af F150 lookalike with those stats they would've decimated Ford's hold on the truck market

idk what this is gonna do"
"I fucking love the look of this thing, can't wait to buy one"
"That presentation was an absolute train wreck.  This would have been so much better from a marketing standpoint it it were a typical F-150/Ram\etc. commercial format with it towing crazy things up steep inclines, showing off it’s customizable suspension, putting up comparative stats, etc.  Does the average consumer know off the top of their head how the Cybertruck’s towing capacity measures up to other popular trucks?? How about the acceleration?  Or ANY of the other facts?  Not any of the people I know, who would ALREADY be skeptical based on it’s comically outrageous appearance.  Also... Did NO ONE practice the window stunt??? What was Elon thinking?? How ridiculous was the visual of the smashed windows through the rest of the presentation?  Every photo/screenshot taken after that point is an advertising nightmare...

I’m sorry, but I feel completely embarrassed for Tesla Motors.  I think the Cybertruck is a fascinating piece of engineering... but I want every vehicle to be electric.  And that will take much longer to happen with ridiculous stunts like this that cannot possibly have been planned by anyone who knows anything about marketing to the average consumer. 

I mean, correct me if I’m wrong, but shouldn’t mainstreaming and mass appeal be the goal at this point?"
"* You're not going to be able to spray rhinoliner or put a stock plastic liner in the bed.
* There are no post holes for tie-downs or post-hole-compatible add-ons.
* There aren't really any bed rails at all.
* The shape of the sides of the bed make it shit for dumping material like mulch, dirt, etc. into.
* Sides of the bed additionally make it pretty shit for putting shit in or taking shit out.
* Sides of the bed constrain ability to haul things slightly wider than the bed.
* Looks like you're pretty screwed for putting a plow on the front of it or a standard-configuration salt box.
* Can't fit a rail-riding toolbox, welder, or gas tank in there (the gas tanks are typically for fueling other equipment.
* Bed  is a part of the truck body, so you can't switch it out for a flat bed,  presumably can't cut it apart to incorporate a fifth wheel hitch.
* Because  the bed is a part of the truck body, if you dump something in there too  hard and too fast, you'll damage the truck body from twisting.

Sure,  it can tow 14,000 lbs. but the people that do that regularly already  drive F-350+ or 3500+ trucks with fifth-wheels which you can't  (presumably) put on the cybertruck. People who use a truck on a jobsite  day to day would have a hell of a time trying to do their jobs. Look at  the Honda Ridgeline as an example. People didn't just ignore it because  it looked weird and had a short bed. It was incapable of doing anything  but hauling people and coolers. This is the big electric Honda  Ridgeline.

"I made this comment before the design was released, but I think it’s **more** relevant now that we have seen it:



I get the concern about the “futuristic” style of the truck.


But if there’s one thing I’ve learned about art, it’s that only things that are totally “new” stand out from the crowd, and go down in history. Because people like seeing things they’ve never, ever seen before.


Chuck berry did it. Star Wars did it. The iPhone did it.

And there have been a million spinoffs of each ever since. 


The truth is, it would be easy to recreate an f150 and make it electric. 


It’s difficult to conjure something totally new into existence. 

Maybe this truck will be one of those iconic things. 


Maybe not. 


But no matter what, tonight, we are likely to see something that we’ve never, ever seen before.


And I’m excited as hell about it."
"[fixed it](https://i.imgur.com/WFGj5pX.jpg)  
edit: this is a really shitty photoshop that I made in 5 minutes to calm myself down, yes the proportions could use work but the concept of flat surfaces can be applied to a truck shape without restructuring it into a pentagon."
this is the biggest confused boner i've ever had lol
Soooo it wasn't a joke. wow
Why is everyone so shocked it looks so weird? Elon has said multiple times he thinks many people won’t like the design because of how futuristic it looks.
"I'm excited ... To buy some cheap Tesla stock either tomorrow or in a couple days.

Honestly, Elon did say this was like a pet project and he didn't really expect anyone to like it.  I like the idea.  And it's not that ugly.  It's cyber punk.  Everything in cyber punk is kinda ugly.  The demo execution was kinda meh.  I think Franz was supposed to use the smallest ball.  Not the biggest one.  Lmao."
"Ok that was the fastest event ever honestly... after those windows broke he was ready to get the hell off that stage. I don’t even know what to think, I don’t know what I expected but this.... certainly didn’t come to mind. Maybe it will grow on me but wow, what a disastrous event"
"My wife: ""It looks like a 14 year old boy designed it."""
Ordered!
"It's ugly to me at first view at least, and the whole window thing was bad, bad, bad.  
But that price and specs....wow"
...Does this thing have crumple zones? Like at all? I'm really worried about its safety ratings
This looks like what happens after a DeLorean fucks a hippo.
I’m just waiting for him to pull back the covers and it doesn’t look like shit. This is sooo hilarious lol.
"The truck is bad on its own but what is the female presenter wearing? Vulture feathers? 

OH GOD THE WINDOWS BROKE THIS IS GOLD"
"That's impressive tow capacity, but I wouldn't expect any less from a fucking military rover"
NGL I like the design.
This is so awkward
This is horrible
Elon got quiet and a little awkward after 😭
Hope you like silver stainless steel. The wide range of color choices reminds me of the Deloreon.
"The Delorean truck, man what a weird presentation that was.  I don't see too many Texans trading in their Fords for this thing though."
"you know, the renders arn't so bad now LOL"
https://twitter.com/killthenoise/status/1197737968326234112
"i’m all for the power train, that looks absolutely perfect, but the body needs major work."
"I really can see this truck as my working vehicle, the price is not bad, all stainless steel is super nice!"
"https://imgur.com/a/WmMYHjP

Steering wheel is the same as the roadster"
Maybe this is just filling a defence contract we don't know about and they can sell to the public as a bonus???
I don’t completely understand it but the toughness was really attractive to my truck driving brother.

the delorean of trucks... lets hope it doesnt have the same fate
Waiting for the bumper sticker that says pretty trucks are for girls
[deleted]
 How do you not do that glass test BEFORE the unveiling?
"Did they not stop and think that driver and passenger windows are DESIGNED to shatter in case of emergency?
Regardless of the fail presentation, what happens when first responders cant open your door or get through the window to save you from a crash or fire?
Also, Mirrors? Airbags? I genuinely think this is not even close to the finalized production and they will completely 180 the design. Or else this will be Teslas first huge flop."
Another great thing about this truck: It should be beast for plowing through zombies. A small snow plow and you're ready for the zombie apocalypse.
lmao he's straight up trolling at this point
I am a fan
"Y'know... That huuuge slab of completely-flat nicely-angled surface all the way down the rear two-thirds of the truck is almost perfectly designed to collect maybe 2kWh of solar in a day. That's potentially several miles.

Solar panels are always going to be cheaper and more effective when installed on a house than on a car, but when the zombie apocalypse happens there's no getting around the fact that we're just gonna have to slap solar panels on that sucker and try to make it across the wasteland. It's the only way. :D

^(Update:) [^(waaaat?!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e02m56/havent_seen_this_tweet_posted_yet_i_actually/)"
Whatever happened to the original idea of it being a smaller version of the semi? It was supposed to be able to out haul anything and fit another pickup in the bed.
I just appreciate any car manufacturer designing and not repeating.
"""This is what you get when you let Silicon Valley boys design a truck"" - Bloomberg"
Looks like there was an argument within Tesla as to whether or not they could make a car uglier than a Porsche Panamera.
"We’ve seen the ability to redesign sedans and suvs by Tesla. This is not how it’s done, everybody is saying “oh it just doesn’t look like your precious American truck” it doesn’t/didn’t have too, this thing is not even functional, how am I gonna easily grab my tools? It could look nothing like a truck if it was more, or even just as functional for a laborer. It would be acceptable but this thing is nothing"
"Also this is not a futuristic looking vehicle

It looks like a prototype used in movies from the 80s"
"I work in the auto industry (Toyota).  Never fails-Whenever there is a restyle on a model everyone hates it.   Complaints on the look of it.  Even a minor refresh like changing the grill.  I don't know if it's because you get used to something.

I was one of the first to get a 2004 Scion xB (Box).  It would stop traffic where people wanted to see it.  After awhile it was only another car on the road & blended into traffic.

So the Cybertruck is different.  I congratulate Tesla on being innovative with a new design.  Tired of the same old pick-up truck design.  Once it's out for awhile I know it'll be different."
"oh no, the joke truck is actually functional?"
Wow very disappointed and just horrible presentation!
S E X Y Cybertruck ATV Roadster? SEXYCAR?
I think it looks dope AF.
"Impressions:

1.	More like CyberTank.
2.	Delorean on steroids.
3.	Super futuristic
4.	Target market: military, oil money, armored vehicle market, Humvee/G-Wagon drivers. High dollar spenders. 
5.	Low dollar cost, $39.9k.
6.	Would hate to be in a motor vehicle accident with CYBRTRK."
"All he had to do was make an electric truck at that price, range, and suspension and it would have sold like crazy. Why Elon?!?"
"Price and specs are very good. 

As someone who is looking at purchasing a truck within the next few years, the exterior is ""I will not buy this thing under any circumstances"" bad."
"Is it a joke? I thought it was a joke. But I guess it's not a joke? Oh dear.

I am a big fan of Tesla, but that thing? I don't know if I could love it. 

Musk did say years ago when he was talking about making a truck that he was going to make the truck he wanted to make and everyone be damned...so... I'll be damned."
"Were it *obviously* a great design, one of the boring legacy automakers would have already built it. Instead, the aesthetic is futuristic, unconventional, disruptive. And it's all built around *function*. First principles thinking at its best. I personally love it and am 100% certain they'll easily sell everything they can produce."
**Hyped**
East coast time!! I want to be special again... What's next PST??! Are you going to take new years away too? 😭
so how long do we expect them to be late
U.K. checking in... 4am... 🥳😴😴😴
Is there a YouTube link to the Livestream.
Is there a YouTube version of the live stream? I'd like to watch it on my tv
I'm watching this on the Bart. It's going to start as soon as I enter the tunnel :(

THEM CYBERPUNKS LIGHTS
This is out of control lol
Tesla cyber truck to be introduced with Keanu Reeves and confirmed to be in cyberpunk 2077
I guarantee you Elon Musk has fucked that girl
Whoa...
Oh no..
is that allowed
Are we sure we're not in the year 3019?
lol
what in the holy flames of hell
nooooo
Looks like something from a 90s scify movie
Where is the bed
What the fuck
There’s no way that’s actually it right?! It’s awful
Wait.. what??
The crowd wasnt sure it was real
Welp stock is tanking tomorrow. F.
The press is gonna freak about this and not in a good way. ☹️ worried how the stock market will react probably negatively
"lol this is going to be memed so hard. I’m not going to immediately discount it on looks, but dang it is weird."
This has to be a joke. The reveal was very quick from the start of the stream. It looks fake too.
W I D E  S T A N C E
"Hold up guys the draw distance needs adjusting, low poly model is showing."
"This is bad, bad."
welp. i'm done watching
This is gotta be a joke.
That back is disgusting lmao
This has to be a joke
Omg from the back it’s even worse
"This is a joke, right? I am not a fan."
Thats ugly lol
someone teach Hans how to use a sledge hammer please.
I'm calling it -- This is not going to be the final design
this is a joke..
Please stop
It doesn’t even have a truck bed....
Fucking show me on the damn truck Elon.
Yeah I'm pretty sure this is a joke lol.
I must be crazy because I fucking love this truck.  I'll have to hold off on buying a vehicle until this comes out.
I want the armor glass on my Model 3.  Fucking rock already got me.

Did they just unveil a pickup truck without a fuckng BED?
WHERE IS THE REAL TRUCK?
is this meant for driving on the moon or something
"Ok we get it, its tough. SHOW US THE INSIDE AND WHY ITS A TRUCK"
LMAO IT BROKE
This is a trainwreck
this glass LOL
Do cringe
"it's gonna be the F-150 killer they said, it'll be sick they said lol"
Wtf is happening this has to be a joke
How are they going to address the blind spots? Any predictions?
"I haven't laughed this hard in a long, long time"
No autopilot sensors on the side....I think it's definitely fake
Holy shit I think he’s serious
[deleted]
I like it but DANG ELON WORK ON YOUR PRESENTING
Honestly. I’m talking all this shit but it’s going to be the best truck on the road.
this looks like a wedge of steel cheese on wheels
The stats are good
Wow $40k
Was the window breaking stage
500 miles ?!?!
N64-lookin-ass
PLEASE GET PICS OF THE INTERIOR
webpage isn't up
This presentation went totally haywire lmaoooo
"If Musk is actually able to compete with Ford with this thing, he's the greatest salesman in history"
He's charging the ATV from the truck
NOOOOOO
*Shocked Pikachu face*
Is there any headroom in the back at all?
Elon pls
yea ok that was a pretty underwhelming presentation
$100 deposit?
"Hey Franz, hold my beer..."
What's the production date on it? I dig  it
"If you've got the money:
Buy the truck with the broken windows.
Get space in a warehouse
Wait
Wait
Profit"
"Alright Tesla. I was disgusted by the looks of it at first, but I would be interested to see an actual car with that kind of design instead. I’ll wait."
"I tuned in late and I keep hearing people mention something about a glass break. Could someone fill me in?

Edit. Holy shit lol"
"If it is going to be a work truck, I would like to see it with a lumber rack.

I was hoping for at least a 7 foot bed..."
I like it. I probably won’t buy it because I’m not in the truck market but I would definitely be open to buying it in the future
It looks like something that you would see in Star Fox for Super Nintendo...
at least they didn't do a live bullet demo. whew! lol
Now everyone’s gonna hate Franz
"Anyone else thing this was just a science experiment? It seems like they developed a lot of new technology that can eventually work its way into other cars and thats the value of the truck; Things like the exoskeleton, air ride, glass, etc. I can see the exoskeleton working its way into a model S type vehicle for police; 
I dont think this will sell that well as a truck, (though 40k is pretty damn cheap); but might find a niche market and might have technology that can be reused."
I imagine Dan Bilzerian being first in line for this.
“Complete with an advanced 17” touchscreen with an all-new customized user interface.”
[deleted]
Do you think I could mount a snow plow on the front of it?
Where’s the rear firing side cameras for self-driving?
"So not a fan of the style... but for me the silver lining is that I’m really excited about a vehicle that size with a 500 mile range.  

Makes me wonder if they have had an evolution in battery cost reduction."
"Elon brought us back to the 80s.

WOO!"
Anyone who placed a reservation - did you get an email or does it show up in your Tesla account? I placed one right away before the site crashed and have no email or reservation in my account. Just making sure it went through.
"If they can put air suspension in the truck at that price why not in the model 3.

It’s not for me, but I can’t wait to see them on the road."
"Blearily checking news before bed...

""Elon Musk reveals new Tes--...""

Adrenaline dump commence."
Looks is quite different. I like cyberpunk stuff tho I wouldn't mind paying 70k for 500+ Mile electric truck. Hope it goes well
Yall got any more of them angles?
You don't patent a name. That was probably a registered trademark.
Anyone notice it doesn’t have mirrors?
I was hoping for a Halo warthog or an Aliens APC. This reminds me of something from Total Recall
Where are the side mirrors?
"Looks like something from Command & Conquer, or Avatar, or Pitch Black."
Is anybody else ... a little bit scared about Musks personal red queen?
I think his long lost younger brother designed this truck
Thank God no more keying videos caught on camera with this baby. I'm putting a reservation down!
So how does this preorder system works. I see you put down 100 bucks
"Cyberpunk El Camino to kick off the 2020s? Not exactly where I thought I'd be, but I'll take it."
Can you imagine all the people that will key that car?
"Reminded me of Firehawk from tv show Viper

https://youtu.be/2-OqIjXOrwM"
Why isn't anyone talking about the side view mirrors or lack there-of?  Are there just monitors on the side now?  Also where are all the sensors and cameras on the exterior?
"I think the strange design may have to do with manufacturing to some extent. Same thing with the ""exoskeleton"" design. They probably want to fold the steel sheets into shape and save on fabrication."
".. This is New Mars Rover ? .. 

(This looks like good design to Mars)

(Not the best looking car but practicall and looks ez to repair or hard to destroy main parts on Mars)"
Cyber Truck 2077
"We proudly present you ""The Elon"" --> https://youtu.be/WPc-VEqBPHI?t=216"
I made this same thing when I signed up for the Boy Scott’s Derby Car race when I was 10.
wtf lol
"I love it haha, looks fricken cool. If i had the money id buy one for sure"
Makes me think of The Homer debacle  https://giphy.com/gifs/3orieQNUM7jbV2mN6U/html5
"The interior, you can setup a gaming rig in there."
Blew my effin mind
"..anyone have specs on that ATV?...cuz that's a game changer, and I pray that it lights a fire under Honda,Polaris,Yamaha,asses!"
This will leave a Pedestrian Pie if someone gets hit by it .
"I hated it when I saw it. I immediately thought it was going to be a flop.

Then I woke up to two of my friends each telling me that they had placed reservations. And these are NOT Tesla people, they're truck guys. So now I have no idea what to think. Maybe he's on to something."
This is right up there with the car Homer Simpson designed.
Definitely not my taste but it will be very interesting to see these on the road in the future lol
"Serious question, but who is this marketed towards? Most people I know who own trucks either live in the countryside (where there aren’t many charging stations) or are wannabe-rednecks in cities (who have very strong brand loyalty to Ford/Chevy and seem to be anti-Tesla)."
Why would Elon design a truck so controversial yet so brave
"The hood of the bed retracts, it's fucking sick

Wow this could not have gone worse. That thing is ugly as fuck.
I love Tesla. This is cringe.
I like it
[deleted]
Aight for the sake of TSLA plz pretend non of this happened until further notice.
I pre ordered one. I figured they'll have to make some design tweaks between now and then. Like adding mirrors and hopefully soften those edges and reduce that polygon look.
Your everyday contractor ain't driving this. What a misfired opportunity.
"Watching Bladerunner 2049 in honor of the Cybertruck. Honestly, I think it looks great. Super futuristic, but if its popular, I see a paradigm shift in truck design."
"I think the main problem with this is that that kind of design is not the design most people who own a truck or who are looking to own a truck look for. Of course (almost) everyone who like EV will praise this futuristic look, but I doubt my farmer uncle will want this kind of truck. I personally like it, but I don't think it will sell well. I sure hope they prove me wrong tho!"
yeah…that's a hard no for me on The CyberCoffin…I mean wtf?!?
"I love it. I want one.

It's like they took ""Ok boomer"" and made it a truck."
"So, I hear everyone that that went horrible. 

Think about it this way: on a regular truck, if you smashed that metal ball through the window, it would have shattered and hit you. (Yes, it was a bad idea to test out the metal ball on the window for the first time on stage. I was worried it would bounce off and hit the audience. I’m kind of glad it didn’t)
Tesla-1, others-0

If someone accidentally hit your truck (fender bender) a regular truck would dent much more easily than the cyber truck. 
Tesla-2, others-0

Specs are amazing: towing capability, acceleration, that trunk bed though!
Tesla-5, others-0

Design... personally, it’s not my style, and I feel like a lot of other people don’t like it either. Possibly because it’s new and SO different than what we have seen. Maybe we just need time to get used to it? Either way, Tesla takes the loss here.
Tesla-5, others-1

Interior pics look good, and the inside looks ore roomier than your average pick-up trick.
Tesla-6, others-1

I feel like I am a little biased. Someone help come up with other points to compare. (FYI I don’t drive a Tesla, but I am a fan)"
it's.... hideous lol
HAHAHAHAHAHA the fucking windows. Why does it look like an untextured truck from a ps1 game with half the polygons?
Holy mother of god that thing is hideous. I never thought I’d think the rivian would be better looking than a Tesla.
"Why didn’t they build a truck that was good at the main reason for a truck, hauling stuff? I was hoping for at least a large (7 ft+) bed. The rear window is almost non functional at that angle. The interior also seems to lack the creature comforts of other trucks. 

A lot of the other comments are saying at least this truck is utilitarian or it’s strictly function over form. I don’t get it. Can someone explain how this would be good at everyday truck stuff?"
All trucks are ugly.  Might as well be radically ugly.
Rivian are probably relieved now
Everyone googling “how to buy Rivian calls” rn
2nd time Tesla dropped the ball tonight.
"Spin the truck around guys. You took a chance, it didnt work, but ya gotta make the best of it."

Who on god’s green earth would ever buy this
"It's hitting all the right points. On board outlets, air compressor, it's fast, long range, durable (mostly) but it's fucking hideous! I could see the front and sides growing on me, but the rear is absolutely horrendous"
Guys I think he’s serious
I don't think the ATV is supposed to overshadow the truck...but here we are.
Ok where’s the real one Elon
"LoL that window fail was monumental !

Good job Franz the Tankz !"
Can the ATV be for sale?
Order now server dead
"6ft bed #disappointed

I have to have an 8ft bed :("
franz about to cut his wrist..
Hate it but I kinda like it.
It's what I expected.  Futuristic.
The design is iffy. If it were it black it might remind me of the Tumbler in Batman. The stainless steel and strong exoskeleton really sold me however. You can basically park this outside anywhere any not worry about hail damage.
[deleted]
"honestly, I feel like the design would be much better if they just took off the sail panels. They make it look like an Aztec and make the bed impossible to access from the side. Anyone know if they’re removable?"
Maybe Elon did this whole thing in order to buy up some cheap $TSLA
HK is going to have a lot of these soon lol
"I thought it was a joke when they first brought it out, but by the end it started to grow on me. Definitely would turn some heads, and the specs are amazing. Didn’t see anywhere on preorder to get the ATV, that would be a nice add on option."
"“If you want a color besides the polished silver of stainless steel, the Cybertruck can be vinyl-wrapped—which lowers environmental impact and costs of a paint shop. “ - https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info"
"Tesla ATV was the best thing today. Shame Tesla will not release electric bikes... 

I'm not fan with the design. Bed is too short and the design is too much pyramid for my taste."
Love it already. Hated trucks thus far. But I can see myself in this. Lugging around soccer gear for my kids' teams. LOL
"This takes me back to the Bill Gates bluescreen of '98. Look, Elon even has the same pose : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfNQOOr9aR8"
ICE trucks are fucking ugly. Have you ever stopped and really looked at them? Fucking monstrosities.
"Have a look at the silly bumpers they had to put on the Bugatti Chiron to make it road legal in California, and now look at this...

It's an early April fool's joke."
I honestly think it looks badass. From the videos it looks like it’s massive in person. I bet it is a blast to drive and honesty I want one haha. Even if that was the most awkward unveiling of all time 😂
"Difficult to reach over the bed and also seems it would be difficult reach and apply straps to cargo if needed. Other than that, it’s freaking cool. The negative points can be improved and fixed. 

Cool stuff. Tesla and Elon deliver something new and unique. If you all were expecting or hoping for a Ford 250 with a Tesla badge in front, that option is already available to you. Minus the Tesla badge, of course. 

Standard, normal pickups are a dime a dozen. Is it so bad to see something unique?"
CD Projekt Red needs to add this to Cyberpunk 2077! : ))
Literally PS1
Did Homer Simpson design that monstrosity?
"Good lord, this is ugly."
"I get that they were going for different, I think it’s ugly but I don’t care.  What I think is ridiculous is the fairings on the sides of the bed. I wouldn’t want to climb in and out of the bed to get shit out, and this throws the opportunity for a camper shell, tonneau cover, bed rails, and utility racks out the window as well.  

I mean it’s like they thought modern trucks copied each other only for looks, there’s a reason the flat and rectangular bed shape exists."
It looks like what folks in the 70s thought we'd be driving in the year 2000.
"""Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the car for the average man... THE HOMER!!!!"""

"I felt the need to pitch in being a Truck owner and someone who genuinely understands them having used trucks my whole life for livelihood and play.

I seriously thought this was a joke at first and they were gonna say that was a prototype. 

Tesla's PR/Marketing people did a terrible job setting up a presentation that was supposed to speak to truck people. I honestly believe I could of done better and I'm a nobody on the internet. 

The entire thing really highlighted how disconnected Tesla is with truck people.

 I can't imagine they actually got focus groups in from rural America and went through with this design approach and marketing style. 

Down to Earth would be a great place to start!"
Damn half the people out here crying about the design and I’m over here thinking it’s great. I’d take it as in that raw metal since it looks like a fuckin tank. What are people going off road or through rough terrain trying to show off their trucks?
"Honestly, it boils down to a very bad demo. 

I’m in software sales, and a good demo can make or break your product and the way your buyer view utility. It’s not about features and how you built something cool. It’s about the impact all of the design makes to the end consumer. 

Spend more time talking about the market you’re after (clearly this is meant for the construction market or the corporate fleet vehicles for folks in blue collar workforce, defense). How does it change things for them and bring practicality that the big 3 don’t provide today?

Towing capacity, less $ on gasoline (my old f150 was $80 to fill up), on board generator to run power tools, air suspension for payload management and increased efficiency, tailgate that extends all the way to the floor for easy loading and unloading, off-roading capabilities that the truck affords, etc. All of these things could have been highlighted to detract from design, but Elon doesn’t really understand this market. The design is meant to be the way it is to maximize efficiency. 

If he would have come out and said “the design is aggressive with several straight lines, but this is how you get the maximum efficiency on $15 of electric. Existing truck makers build bulky trucks that aren’t aerodynamic which costs you money every time at the pump and doesn’t allow for quicker acceleration” I think people would understand. 

This is an adventurer’ vehicle. I see it more as a competitor to a Jeep Wrangler than an F150 in its current state. 

Truck people are truck people because of the utility of owning a pickup. Maybe they’d be able to get past design if the utility is there, but this was not about utility. This was about trying to change the truck game. Ain’t going to happen. This is a totally different market where EV’s are not seen as not capable of doing what a good old fashioned 4 ton ICE pickup can do. 

On the other hand, I would absolutely buy an electric ATV.  That looked pretty slick!"
Truly shocked how much criticism the truck is getting for not being more normal looking. We legit had like a year plus of warnings it wouldnt look anything like a normal truck.
What the fuck
"Nailed every aspect except for the looks. Wouldn't be caught dead driving that thing. What a shame.

On a side note, does Tesla have a design language? Why is this so vastly different from their lineup?"
Love the look and dig the specs! Seems most hate the design but I love it! Anybody get a confirmation email for the $100 reservation?
Even if it's not your style I want to live in a world where cars that look like that are on our roads.
"I have no problem with them doing a truck that looks this radical.  Go different! There is a market for it. BUT. They need to release a truck that looks more normal and can get a majority of people behind it with the same specs.  If they do, that's a game changer. If you want to push people away from gas and start an electric revolution, you have to appeal to the masses. You just do.  If they do that, the company will thrive, and way more people will move to electric. Maybe that is the plan? Reveal the out of this world truck tonight and then later a more ""mass appeal"" one. I really hope so."
I was completely weirded out by the design when it first came out but it quickly grew on me. Especially when up against the F150. Then Elon started explaining everything else and now I just want one lol.
"If you remove the bed cover it actually honestly looks pretty cool:

Please bring out the real one Elon
"This has to be a joke.

No one in the market for a truck is going to buy this.  No one that uses a truck for a living is going to buy this.  

Dead on arrival."
"$39,900?? I don't care how ugly it is. Jeeez"
I guess it really wasn't a joke.
\*confused blinking*
"I was planning to order tonight, but I think I'll wait for the second generation. First, I don't like how much overhang there is between the rear wheels and where the trailer ball/socket will sit, that tends to take a lot of weight off the front axle while towing (imagine a fat kid on a seesaw). Also, I don't like the high side rails, that makes loading, unloading, and tying down cargo a PITA. I'd prefer an eight foot bed as well, but 6.5 feet ain't bad. I like the first 40% of the profile, up until the peak on the roof, after that I'd prefer if it looked more like a miniature Class 8 truck with a bed. And for Christ's sake, use a video if you're going to have a presentation where someone tries to smash a door or window so you won't have \*that\* happen on stage. Honestly I hope that they get enough negative feedback that they adjust the design prior to production -- they are close to having a winner but it needs some tweaks IMO."
"I've hated on this truck for a bit tonight, but I will say, I just looked at Tesla's website, and a weird thing happened. The Model 3 actually looked kinda off to me. Like it was TOO curvy. Idk if I'm just super tired or not, but maybe this insane triangle idea will pay off. Probably not tbh though, still feel it's just too triangular. There's a good rendering I saw earlier where it had a regular truck bed but the front was the same and it looked kind of compelling. Hope they move towards that."
"I legit love it. I think most modern car designs are so boring and dull, most people just have to warm up to a new design over time."
It’s gonna be funny when all these comments read like one of those “the iPhone won’t last a year without a stylus or keyboard” comments from 2006 lol
"I love the design. I know a lot of people are calling it ugly, but take one look at this thing and it is the most futuristic pickup truck I could ever imagine. Tesla knows what they were doing, and they know some people aren't going to like the design. The more I look at it the more I love it. To the people who say its ugly: I emplore you to look at it again and rethink. This is a sexy truck."
This thing is sick as fuck. But it’s so damn ugly.
Oh god. My first thought is 'rip tesla stock' tomorrow. But maybe I'm way off... hope I am.
So... how bout that Mustang Mach-E?
"Wow this thread is a shit show. As a person who hates trucks, I’m getting this one. Looks awesome!"
"I'm sorry, did I miss something? This has to be a fucking joke, right?"
"Haters: model S and model X looks so outdated!

Tesla: *brakes the 100 years trend and make a new truck design.*

Haters: it looks nothing like Ford or my grandpa’s old truck! No one wants it."
Rivian reservations just doubled.
"So I have mixed feelings.  


I like modern looking cars...but this thing...is not good or modern or even futuristic looking.  It is a steel tank, it looks like a microwave, not a vehicle.  The aesthetic he was going for was made in the 80's to look like what they thought the 2020's would look like.  it still looks very 80's ""futuristic"" not ""modern"". It is like making appliances now that looked like the fancy ""home of the future"" movies from the 50s.  


It has all the guts people will want for a truck, but I don't feel like it will sway current truck (ford/gmc/ dodge etc) users (not just suburban drivers) to switch over.  I don't like straight stainless steel, while sturdy, its ugly and is going to blind anyone on the road around it. it didn't work for DeLoriens, I don't see it working here either. The angles of it all is...ugly.  Its a truck for people who have no need for a truck but want the brand name and the stats....like people driving Escalades.  


I am sad his window thing went wrong, watching the flat glass demo your could see that they ""as seen on tv""d the clamps. and you could tell he was pissed about it afterwards.  the ATV roll out could have been so much more if he hadn't lost his composure.  


I like trucks, I'm not a boomer, I think current trucks are ugly. but this is not going to be a truck that can expand into service vehicle markets and that is truly where we need EV's. yes the semi is in the works, but smaller delivery trucks to fit where semi's cant are needed too.  


I'm kind of feeling lackluster over the whole thing. I was excited during the superloop presentation, I was excited during the semi presentation, this left me...feeling like the upward swing in ideas and actions the company was taking, just fell off a cliff. I am left feeling a little sad really, and it had nothing to do with the glass."
"Tesla: We will unveil a strange, exotic, non-mass production truck that will look very strange and sell in low volumes. 

Tesla: *does*

Everyone: Wtf is this a joke 😡😱"
Today is the day we find out who is a Tesla worshipper and who isnt.
I kept complaining about the shitty renders. Can we have the renders back please?
Is it wrong that I’d rather drive a 2005 Pontiac Aztek? Holy hell that thing is ugly.
Let's just never speak of this again.
A lot of ppl at Rivian are extremely relived rn...
wait so they demonstrated how tough it was by hitting it with a sledge hammer... does that mean that you'll be less safe in a collision? Cars are meant to collapse so they absorb the impact instead of your fleshy body. Does the Tesla truck just pass the kinetic energy onto you?
"Elon rushed the shit out of this release. He wasn’t prepared at all, the window fiasco was a joke. They didn’t even show the interior or show pictures. This was so bizarre"
Pre-Ordered!
"Honestly this was the chance to break into one of the biggest markets across the world. Presentation gaffs aside this could've been another watershed moment for Tesla. Solidifying their market offerings from small cars, family vehicles, SUV’s and trucks. Pushing the envelope towards a quicker adoption of electric vehicles. 

We got this. It’s a yikes from me. 

I can see Ford implementing everything they’ve learnt from the Mach-E and basically porting it into the F-style bodies and bang, profit. Huge swing and a miss from me to be honest."
"I think the folks at Rivian are resting easy. 

I sort of want one, but my wife definitely won't let me buy one if it looks like that. Holy Fuck."
Lol all the ugly fan renders looked better than this.
When I was 5 I used to draw cars that looked like this truck. I’m suing.
"This is like the Apple G4 Cube.  Terrible design from an otherwise good company.  Will be remembered as a quirky bizarre vehicle.  Will eventually be replaced with a more conventional looking truck in another five years.  In twenty years, this truck will be worth millions since they will be super rare collector’s items and barely anyone got one."
I’m hoping this goes through the Sonic phase and they come back with a more pleasing design.
"Such a strong start with the lasers and droid chick ... thought they were about to blow the lid off LA...

... but then they shit out the CyberTruck"
[Looking better now?](https://imgur.com/a/09oCAys)
I am over here just fucking laughing. I can’t believe this is real. Can someone mock up the homer-mobile clip from the Simpsons but put the cybertruck in it?
"I think people are fixating too much on the look instead of the function of this vehicle. Some people will be put off by it's aesthetic sure, but if you want a tough as fuck truck that is better than every other truck out there, then you'd get this. People who actually use a truck for work will get this.

Pros: Tough as nails. Bigger load and towing capacity. Better acceleration. Power supply for tools. Air compressor. Dynamic suspension for optimum off roading & highways. Bullet proof. And it's much cheaper.

I know I am in the minority but I quite like this design and I think this is going to redefine what a truck should look like. I predict you'll see other companies try to copy this design. Other trucks look old fashioned and stupid in comparison after seeing this."
"I so wanted this to be a good looking vehicle. I love the model 3, and dream of owning the S someday. Electrics are necessary, and superior in so many ways, to ICE cars. But for now I will stick with a 3 for my inevitable purchase, despite having more need of a truck. That thing is too ugly for consideration. I want to haul tools, not look like one."
"You know i like Tesla, i really so.  And i love how all the previous cars look, but that is the single fucking ugliest car I've ever seen."
I'm sorry this thing looks awful.
"Lol. WTF is this. 

Game over Tesla. Rivian is probably gonna take tomorrow off for laughing day.

Tesla made a HUGE mistake"
"Prediction: They're going for the Sonic The hedgehog Marketing Strategy. Let people shit all over it non stop for 6 months, then they'll unveil an updated on that looks decent and everyone will praise it and line up to buy. Right?

Edit: the preorder part was wrong, but I stand by the rest."
what the hell did I just watch lmao
Maybe they can redesign it before they start production lol
"No one: I want a truck with super strong glass!
Tesla: Heres a truck with .. whoops."
How in the world did Simone Giertz make a more appealing truck than Elon Musk
stock is down 3.33%
"The slopes on the side of the bed are pure idiocy. How are you going to load/unload from that? There is a reason truck bends have flat side all the way and it's not for looks.

Elon, there is a reason that pretty much all ""containers"" in the world have flat edges. Bathtubs have flat edges, drawers have flat edges, everything meant to ""hold stuff"" has a flat edge. It's so you can actually load/unload them easily. Imagine if your bathtub could only be entered from the front, or if your silverware drawer had a super high edge in front of the spoons.

Ridiculous."
"Dreams were, ahem, shattered, tonight."
"I don't need a pickup truck but I would buy this if I did.  I really don't mind the design.  Everything new takes some getting used to and the incredible specs certainly supersede any concerns I might have about form.  It's hugely superior as a truck.  I'm practical.  It's a much better, less expensive truck."
[I mean](https://i.imgur.com/8Y78Rtx.png)
Didn’t rigid paneled passenger cars stop being made because of safety issues? When the exoskeleton “can’t be crushed” all of the energy from a collision goes through the body to the passengers. I think it either won’t pass safety standard tests or Tesla is largely misleading consumers about the integrity of the subframe.
Lifted crossover lambo
The anti electric car crowd will be very confused over this vehicle.   Some won't know whether to hug it or key it.
"I think this would have been cool as one of those futuristic concept vehicles shown at the LA Auto show, or the likes.  I don't mind how the front end of the cab looks, I dig futuristic design overall, but the triangle shape has gotta go.  People buy trucks for their utility.  Renaming the bed to the 'vault' isn't going to cut it.  You need that pickup bed to be accessible from three sides.  You need to provide MULTIPLE bed size options: 5.5 foot, 6.5 foot and 8 foot.  You need to   provide different cab sizes.  This is why body on frame trucks are superior to unibody designs.  You can configure the truck to the customer's EXACT needs."
I was ready to line up for the 3 but this is more exciting.
"A bad drawing made into a truck?

Anyone else reminded of this? [https://www.booooooom.com/2016/05/09/bicycles-built-based-on-peoples-attempts-to-draw-them-from-memory/](https://www.booooooom.com/2016/05/09/bicycles-built-based-on-peoples-attempts-to-draw-them-from-memory/)"
"At first I was like  Canyoneroooooooooooo, but then I realized this is exactly the design I want for roaming the world across broken highways with rigged up solar panels and Mad Max defenses against whatever is left of humanity.  I'm into it, but am not in the demographic."
Did you feel that? It was as if millions of middle aged sociopaths all instinctively began sharpening their car keys at once
https://i.imgur.com/8uCAKso.mp4
Elon standard time 😴
Will Tesla stock drop tomorrow?
This presentation is so strange
this truck is the exact design of all those idiot pencil drawings we saw and said it would look nothing like.
"I was eagerly awaiting this reveal to replace an aging GMC. He's touting a ton of features nobody needs, in a package that looks terrible.

His very first comments about needing to suceed in this market were spot on.......So far, this misses about every singly mark.

And using the ""bang on the door with a hammer"" test? saturn did that back in the 90's didn't they?"
this has to be a joke
Why wont he show us the bed of the truck lol
THIS ISN’T YOUR EVERYDAY UGLY. THIS IS... ADVANCED UGLY.
I regret watching this....going to cringe all night. Won't be able to sleep
"Honestly, every single thing about this truck is fantastic except the design. What the fuck is this design?"
Can't wait for the F-150 bodywork retrofit kits.
I want this truck to replace my working van.
meh.  seems like the harsh lines would increase drag.  I was expecting something more aerodynamic for increased efficiency.
This is gonna be controversial...not to mention the glass oh noo poor Tesla.
"3 years away for the Tri... dang... Definitely trying to avoid Elon time. 

I don’t hate the look. Obviously a lot of people will. 

Part of me: That looks really cool. I might like one someday. 
Other part of me: It won’t garner the mass appeal it should. Pending an abrupt design shift in automobiles, it will be such a unique vehicle that you’re limiting yourself to wealthier people looking for a cool toy.

Tesla had a chance to make something that completely turned over the truck market. They are CLEARLY capable given all of the awesome specs and solid price points.

I don’t see big construction companies upgrading their fleet to this truck. I don’t see blue collar folks in the south giving this a try. It’s capable, but they’d be ostracized.

I really wish they keyed in on all of the features and capabilities. It has a lot of cool stuff, but it just gets buried by everything else."
I don't think I can ride this in my community without some one calling the cops
"Also, was there any kind of crumple zone? The force of a collision is going to go somewhere. Doesn't bode well that they advertised the body as indestructible."
I think this is not that great looking. It's a bit too future. I hope it grows on me. Thst being said I still preordered because the specs are insane. It's like the ugly thing you just gotta settle for and after 50 years you know you did good.
Okay but where's the ATV
This is straight out from Blade Runner car designs.
I think we being pushed into the future with this design.
I feel like this truck needs a photoshop battle for improvements.
dont worry everyone with all the backlash elon will tweak it andor design a 2nd more serene truck. markets too big to alienate
Ordered. Shut up and take my money Elon!!
Looks like a truck from a N64 game.
"I want one! Looks well suited for road trips, the 'Vault' looks like its long enough to lie down in (\~2m):

 [https://imgur.com/a/w8Ge5pv](https://imgur.com/a/w8Ge5pv)   


Can probably only afford up the medium range model though."
It looks like the bastard child of Iron Man and a Honda Ridgeline. I want it.
This will take a while to get used to looking at.
"I think it’s a step in the right direction. An electric truck that can tow 14,000 lbs is impressive. But at that price point, you can buy a much more capable truck. A lot of premium dual-ys cost around 70k and can tow anywhere from 20,000-30,000 lbs. Most people who spend this much on a truck will need more than what Tesla is offering. That being said, I’m excited for gen 2 and gen 3."
Okay this is the first one I don’t like. What the heck was he thinking?
"I hated it last night, I like it now. I appreciate how they’re trying to make a different looking vehicle, and the renders look great in the different colors. I think the grey metal color together with the dark room at the announcement event didn’t do it any favors, it seemed like a cardboard cutout."
"I have an ICE truck so I was really interested in this. At first I was like ""nope"". But the more I look at it the more its growing on me.  Loving the bed cover . The tailgate is really awesome with the built in ramps. The interior is also great...except for the steering wheel. It needs one similar to the Model 3. The onboard compressed air is a great feature."
"When it first came out on stage and how Elon was acting, just his normal self, I thought it was a joke. I kept thinking this isn’t  real, they can’t think any truck buyer would want this. How do they expect this design will outsell a Ford F-150? It never will. They really missed the chance to change the segment and get the one group of automobile drivers that have a distaste of electric vehicles to switch. They dropped the ball, pun intended, in my opinion. Every other vehicle the company has made looks good, this is plain butt ugly. The price point and capabilities are so intriguing, the design is off putting."
"In the market for a pickup, was excited about this reveal but not so much anymore. It’s new, it’s futuristic, but I was hoping for some hints of normal. I know it was supposed to really different but this is a whole other level of different. Driving it would be like if you wore one of those super fashion forward outfits you only see on runways, but everyday in public. It absolutely screams “I want attention” which to some people might be great but to me it is a big negative. It’s the Hummer of the 2020s; large military-esque hunk of metal, sticks out in any environment and the drivers will likely immediately be labeled as the largest <insult> on earth. My sensibility is forced to be superficial here. I can’t imagine myself ever working up the courage to be /seen/ driving this, and that sucks."
This may be the first time I’ve ever been disappointed by Tesla and Elon. Months of hype for a 25 minute shit show.
Detroit is laughing uproariously and getting dead drunk tonight.
"When does production start?

What's the range while towing?

Why doesn't it have mirrors?

What does the interior look like?

Can it pull a 5th wheel?

So many unanswered questions. Musk has never been Steve Jobs but that has to go down as one of the worst presentations he's ever given."
Maybe we can have the team who fixed Sonic the Hedgehog look into this one too.
"Ya know, at first I hated it. But as time goes by, the more I look at it, I hate it even more."
"Many, people are sick of cars and trucks looking nearly the same since the 70s. It's always the same minor changes: change a tail light, change a headlight, change a couple angles, revamp interior, minor changes to mechanics, and then pump out 500,000 units of the same hideous, plain Jane bullshit as always with cheesy commercials and catch phrases. ""FEATURING THE ALL NEW BLAHBLAHFUCKINGBLAH"", and it's never new.

This *is* new. This *is* beautiful. It is a concoction of minimalistic, functional, aggressive, futuristic angles and and edges. WE ARE APPROACHING THE YEAR 2020. We *are* living in the future. The age of the beginning of advanced AI, industry-wide automation, societal-level space presence, self driving and piloting vehicles of all kinds, genetic engineering of human beings, bionic limbs and organs, 3d printing, electric vehicles, renewable energy, advanced robots of all kinds (Atlas, anyone?), virtual reality, life-like CGI, brain implants (Neuralink;) I can go on and on.

We need aesthetics in the world around us that reflect the reality of the age we are living in. That reality is massive and nearly incomprehensible change as a result of our species embracing science and technology. 
The Tesla CYBRTRK fearlessly and beautifully reflects that wonderful reality."
Event badges do not have a number on the back like they usually do. So it's unclear if test drives will happen...
How about a wagon ? That would look sick
"If you try to go to [teslamotors.com/cybrtrk](https://teslamotors.com/cybrtrk) it redirects to /cybertruck but gives you a non-standard, Starman 404 page."
bumped to 8mins
5 minutes!!!!
LETS GET READY TO RUMBLEEEEEE!!!!
It’s like New Years!!!!
https://youtu.be/NcROXiN_cdE
I AM STANDING BY
I love how 0 people are surprised it's late already hahaha
It is so weird we haven't seen a teaser or a camo'd version or anything of this truck. We really are going into this knowing nothing
[deleted]
Getting serious terminator vibes from the soundeffects and soundtrack
Is this cringy to anyone else?
Can Grimes and Elon just get married or coupled or whatever robots do already?
Love the Blade Runner sound effects in the background.
today we are all cybrgrls
We have lasers and holograms. This is the future
Is that Grimes? Lol
Elon has big dick energy today
Gaaaah
Holy Mars rover
Holy fuck
OH MY GODDDDDDD
"Ummm how is that practical,,?"
What the fuck is that
Wait that’s illegal
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
please say sike
"Eh, I’m not a fan, not gonna lie"
LMAO. Hes joking. Right?
He can't be serious. That looks dreadful.
AWKWARD
lol no way that’s it.
And I thought Ford was out of pocket with calling their vehicle Mustang.
He's GOT to be kidding. I do not believe he would do this.
THIS HAS TO BE A JOKE
what a disaster
Is it stealth?
Please let him reach back and smack that and all the angled shit falls off.
Lmaoooooo he's on the verge of losing it himself
Wow... um... I'm at a loss for words
This looks so fucking weird lmao
Drag coefficient of 500
smash that thing
God help us all.
"Not that into the triangle look. First miss for me in terms of design coming from Tesla. I was hoping for a more ATV kind of look based on some of the guesses people have made from the teaser images. Very curious to hear about the stats, though."
This is badass. It looks ridiculous. But it’s badass.
the crowd is legit shocked at how ugly it is
This thing ugly
Is this reality
"After the sledgehammer, the skin better come off revealing something way better looking. good god."
Franz got guns tho
First I was like.. oh no.. I'm already getting used to it. :)
This truck designed by Homer Simpson
Rip that guy on wallstreetbets
Well I guess I'm out
I stayed up for this?
CyberCanyonero
"this gotta be the mars version lol, no way this thing gets mass produced, the interior does look huge though, not sure about the bed"
I LOVE IT!!
You gotta unleash the power of the pyramid!
I fucking love it
Do they even prepare for these things? It makes me not really want a model 3 anymore.
This is hilarious.  I love the presentation. The costumes crack me up.
Does anyone not believe bullet proof glass is a thing?  Why do they need to show us this?
Wtf am I watching?
Oh shit
OOOOF
Oh fuck
omg what the fuck hahahahha
this is awkward
F
"Lmao that one girl going ""Yaaasss"" at everything Elon says"
Pls no this is so bad
So in Elon time does he think it's April 1st?
I’ve been laughing for 10min straight. I really can’t!!!!!!!!!! This is absolute gold.
oops
This demo. OMG.
"""Take my money"""
Lmaoooo had that F150 squeeeealin lmaoo
Road legal? Blindspot huge
500+ Miles! Game over.
It’s ugly as fuck but its specs are good
This thing looks like it should be in Halo
Elon buddy no
No way so cheap
Anyone remember when the Chevy Avalanche came along and looked ugly AF?
Where's the mirror?
Make it stahhhhhp.
Where are the autopilot cameras?
Did he say what the bed width is? I saw 6.5 feet long.
please no
link not working lol
Elon PLEASE say sike...
haha website doesn't work. This is not real.
Real truck coming!!!!
YOU WHAT
OH SHIT AN ATV
ONE MORE THING OMG AN ATV OMG OMG OMG
I rather get the atv.
ATV THATS SICK
We also made an ATV. Hahaha
holy fuck i need the ATV
"Well at least they did one thing right tonight, atv!"
ATV?!!? WHAT?
I'm so confused
what is even happening right now
Wow that's a lot of suspension travel
That is a badass ATV
lol a fuckin atv
im dying
Can any of you post a couple screenshots for us losers who couldn’t get the stream? Ty
Should have thrown the small ball!   I still want one.
If you go in to order you can see all the inside and stuff
Late 2021
Does it have side mirrors? And what about the ATV?
"Any details on how Tri motors work?

Is it two on the rear axle? Why?"
"Aight, fellas, I'm ready."
I dont know how much I love the design but I think if the truck came in that matte black finish like the ATV did then it would look super dope.
I thought it was against US regulation to not have at least a portion of the tail lights on an immovable body panel?
"Well Musk definitely made sure to eclipse Rivians stats on their truck. Now the question is, will they sell enough based on the radical design or will people go to Rivian or Ford"
https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/cybertruck
"Oh man, if they made a box van in this same style it would look way better than the truck."
Did they mention what the payload is?
Site is hella swamped.
"I wonder if the pre-order choice even matters, I'm sure when the time comes they will be flexible in the option you choose."
"Little question here:

When they talk about ""configuration"""", will I be able to decide Dual Motor or RWD  later down the road or did the configuration I chose while pre-ordering be the one I am ""stuck"" with?

Also unfortunate, I kept getting errors but the transactions worked every time. I guess Ill need to investigate for refunds once I get the email"
"I see they have a custom trailer on the Cybertruck photo section. Wonder if they will sell a Tesla Trailer. I would get one since it looks pretty clean/simple along with the grills, but I believe there will be many aftermarket stuff for Rivian/Tesla trucks"
"oh, so Franz designed it and smashed the window? hm"
"What's the overall length, so I can see if it will fit in my garage."
Did you get an email acknowledging your Cybetruck order?
"Does anyone know if you can change reservation options after the initial reservation? I didn't opt for FSD because of the price, but having second thoughts about it now since it might cost even more down the line!"
I hope it has vehicle to grid capability
What's the benefit of preordering?
[deleted]
Am I suppose to get something thru email or do I just screenshot the reservation code?
"Missed the live stream, is there a link to the recorded event?"
"Anybody put deposit down and it didn’t ask for any info? My email or anything? 100 seems too low for deposit. 11pm pst is when I put my deposit down and my buddy said I’m 500,000 on the list. Possible he’s seeing what the interest is and then build out from there?"
Looks like a really butched up DeLorean. I guess Marty McFly can get rid of that Toyota.
"[Here is a link for the stream](https://youtu.be/gEwtrXGOW_o?t=33760). For some reason, Tesla deleted theirs. Production starts late 2021 so don't expect one until 2022. I personally think they will modify the design before production and I'm curious to see what the final design will look like."
A truck rendered on PS1. Reminds me of the PS1 tomb raider vs PS4 tomb raider memes lol. https://media0dk-a.akamaihd.net/18/25/fa503a828eb00ad1abda112d4e38210b.jpeg
https://youtu.be/Pw9gaEiQAxY
It looks like a futuristic moon rover.
Is there any relevance to this reveal being very shortly after the BladeRunner moive was actually set?
"this looks straight out of ""test drive 3"" game"
This looks ready for the dystopian nightmare we’re all headed for.
"I am curious about if it has a camera security system and mounting locations for laptops front and back with wifi capabilities, and of course a starlink connection. I may as well ask for a heads up display and possibly infrared adons. Foggy nights can be dangerous to drive, and looking down at a display panel takes your eyes off the road."
[deleted]
"Minecraft, totally with the times."
Love it!  Kick out the polygonal jamz!
"My worry is how visibility is going to be in the cabin, it looks like it has a roof slope of a Lamborghini. We'll see"
"Everyone saying how bad it is that the windows broke.
At the same time, this is the biggest free marketing ever. Everyone will now see the cybertruck vs only the ones really interested in cars.
This is a big win marketing wise"
[deleted]
"For those who rode in it, how quiet was it?"
I wonder if they will do a motorhome next.  [IMG](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bJFJRQ7CDms/TaRh3HDVhUI/AAAAAAAAGro/Vss3N1n3-cI/s1600/damnation8.jpg)
Well... It’s got brave styling.
The design looks like it's meant for Mars.  Could SpaceX be Tesla's biggest customer for Cybertruck?  A way to shuffle money from one company to another?
I like angular cars but this kinda seems like a low-tendered truck in a video game and I don’t find it attractive. It’s angular in a non-sexy way.
Designed in Minecraft
"[What have I done? I mean, the zoo was fun, but... I'm ruined!](https://imgur.com/a/Ea4q0o3)

I actually like the design, but couldn't help but think of this."
"I feel like it get worse as you go front to back. The nose is kind of cool, the linear headlight is cool, then as you go back its just more and more boxy until you get to the rear view and its just a big bulky rectangle, like they ran out of time designing it or the render stopped halfway through"
Not liking the design that much but i'd buy it just because is so different. I'm sick of the same boring car design that everyone is doing.
Looks like a high poly PS1 game truck straight outta GTA 3 lmao
But where are the mirrors?
Elon should make SUV version too
That is one of the ugliest cars ive seen in my entire life. I LOVE my model 3. But it looks like im sticking with it.
"I've been at closed-to-the-public auto industry reveals and even for those, every detail is rehearsed over and over, triple checked, again and again. How this got away from them tonight is baffling, and troubling."
"I seriously thought it was a joke or like a special edition version and then he was going to bring out a more traditional style pick-up.  When the glass broke, the crowd and Elon got depressed and the whole thing went downhill. Now the price and the specs will make it a big seller. I loved how the bed cover rolled up into the frame. That was sweet. Still unsure I would ever buy one, but who knows. Hate the all metal look. I would definitely hope it comes in paint. Haha."
"Can't think of anything witty for points...God, that's ugly as sin."
"The last time I was let down by a car reveal was the Y, it was just a slightly taller copy of the 3, I wanted something different. Now they went overboard with that idea. I would be embarrassed to drive this and i’m not sure who outside of Tesla fans would buy this, it certainly isn’t going to cut into F150s sales."
"Wow, I'm legit surprised by the negative reactions. I personally think this is the coolest fucking car ever! I would sell my p3d- literally right now if this was available"
[deleted]
rivian just thanked the lord
"When people were shouting shoot it, I was hoping someone would have yelled ""put it out of it's misery."" My poor poor stock."
Here's a recording of the unveiling if anyone missed it:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCSNCs7bwCw&feature=youtu.be&t=324](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCSNCs7bwCw&feature=youtu.be&t=324)
Truck looked badass you know these are going to be everywhere In 2 years
"the cyber truck is a tool, like a hammer — it’s %100 functional. the overall shape has lower drag and the boxiness makes it cheaper to manufacture. *but* lots of folks especially in los angeles will eat this up. it’s like a hummer but with more bravado. 

and there will be lots of small businesses that will use it because it will be cheaper to operate, boots-and-cowboy-hat crowd be damned."
"Does anyone else feel like this is all part of a bigger plan to create vehicles that will work on mars etc trying to get the R&D subsidized by selling them as consumer vehicles?  Like if you look at boring company for digging and creating underground shielded habitats and this this all terrain ‘truck’ that just happens to be made if the same metal as starship.- it feels cohesive. We’ll need vehicles to move and create on other planets. I dunno it all fits in the overarching ethos. 

ATV would even make sense in that world, although that could have been something to let the jr designers work on the devils future skills."
"Well, I'm glad to see my drawing from 1st grade made it production.

&#x200B;

Seriously though, Musk needs to focus on actually bringing in new customers to the company. This thing looks horrible, especially when compared to that mustang SUV which made me lust for it. Hope to god they change the design and add a lot more curves as only loyal tesla fanboys will buy this thing as is."
"https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/11_Desktop_Video.mp4

Man there's some haters in here, I think it looks dope af in motion"

"Ford and Rivian just had a huge sigh of relief.

You can tell the people who designed it do not use trucks. You can't reach down in the bed of that thing. The bed is almost totally useless."
"Everyone that is saying 'I'd buy it', 'I like the design', 'This is what trucks need to be' aren't the people who a truck should be targeted for. Contractors don't sit on Reddit all day swooning over a truck launch. They use it to get work done, pay the bills and make their life easier. The design isn't practical and I don't think it's going to work. They've got to carry lumber, tools to get their work done. Sure, there's features that are great, but that's worth nothing if it doesn't satisfy basic needs. I'll admit I could be wrong but I just don't see this being widely adopted, especially when traditional manufacturers have options on the horizon. 

Like I said, I could be wrong. It's a cool truck, but it's just not going to smash it out of the park for blue collar workers in my opinion."
[deleted]
"I mean, the ATV is cool, the features are sweet and the price is great. But goddamn is that thing hideous."
"No shot of the interior as well. The price point is good, the specs are good but jesus christ do they think your average construction worker will switch from their ford/ram/whatever truck to this ugly thing?"
It doesn't have side mirrors????
I like it...
the delorean for a new generation
My expeditions were not that high....but damn did that thing disappoint.
Press F to pay respects
"Interior looks good.

https://i.imgur.com/1X50qgH.jpg"
Everybody being hypocrites. No duh it looks different that's THE WHOLE POINT!
I didn't think there'd be an uglier EV than the first generation Leaf but here we are.
"So, uh, does it come in colors?"
"I hope they pull a Sonic on this and revamp the thing to look like a pickup people will want to buy, too much opportunity to waste it like this..."
"The price makes up for the design tbh. But more than anything I wish tesla would invest in a better stage production team like damn, the awkward pauses of Elon waiting for someone to hit play on the video, the hecklers shouting memes, the cringy performers, it all takes away from what's happening on stage. I dont know if I like the design or not but the performance and price is really all that matters when it comes to a truck, and it definitely doesnt look like the other clones on the street.

This most definitely will be used by police and military, with the standard bullet proofing couple with the price these will definitely be cyberpunk law enforcement vehicles in the near future."
"The glass thing I am not surprised. You need to have the glass being held very strongly to not break, it can t move a millimeter. This is why on the table the glass was tightly held by vices that were checked at every drop. If there is no wiggle room the glass will not break. If there is the slight space and there is one when it is above a door for the mechanism to make it go up and down then you will likely break it.

The point is that this is still armored glass than almost nothing will go through. I m surprised that Elon did not see that coming. Unless the glass for that model was different."
The perfect balding middle aged IT man vehicle
"I love how ""non-tesla"" it looks. I love tesla design language, but they were all starting to look like amorphous blobs to me. This is the opposite of a blob."
"I personally love the look of this thing, it’s like a blade runner car, and a halo warthog mashed up, and I’m definitely for it, I’m definitely going to be saving up to get myself one."
"I am a huge Kobe Bryant fan

I owned a pair of the Kobe 2s from Addidas when they came out. 

I didn’t think they were ugly because I was a huge Kobe Bryant Fan

This truck reminds me of those shoes"
That thing is badass. Remember how ugly electric cars were just like 10 years ago
I am the only one who likes this thing
"I was putting off my car buy until this truck. I can’t buy this though. It’s way too ugly. The rest sounds awesome but I’m also not sure why it would need bullet resistant glass. Also, I’m 6’8” and finding a truck that fits is impossible"
It’s obviously the ugliest car ever created. Only question is if it’s the ugliest thing humans have ever created.
I personally think it looks awesome. If I had the money I would order one now.
"Who else was yelling ""What is that?!!"" for 30 seconds when they brought it out?"
Seriously though. What did we just watch.
I love the design. It's Cyberpunky.
so the specs are great but the looks are terrible
[Don't let your memes be dreams. Cybertruck secured.](https://i.imgur.com/2BeCjVs.png)
"It looks like something an elementary school student would draw if you asked them to draw a ""cool truck"". No gooseneck or 5th wheel capabilities, no side-bed loading or unloading, no color options.

I was so hyped for ""my next truck""....now I'm just sad. I guess it's an electric F150 after all.  :(

Hey Elon, there's several reasons Delorean went out of business and you touched on a couple of them here too. I guess you were right when you said ""it will turn a lot of people off""."
"For $40K, I can easily see a bunch of my coworkers buying it as a toy to play around with and having something different/unique."
"Oh I can't wait!!!!

&#x200B;

HOLY FUKK IT""S HIDEOUS!!!!"
They bout to give the Sonic Movie treatment to this car
"I don't know what others where expecting but this is exactly what I was expecting based on the renders. Its designed for function. Just as other Tesla are.designed for range/speed.  
  

- its clearly strong
- it can charge vehicles
- it has a large protected bed
- it has a long range

And the price is very low for all the functiknality. It even has pneumatic connection so you can use a nailgun as your postapocalypse weapon!  
  
The presentation could do with some work but honestly every presentation so far has been a work in progress. See: Y presentation"
I just wish they made a normal truck first and then went on to sell this crazy future truck.
[deleted]
This totally Lacked professional execution. I’m all in for the general direction of the design but come on. It needs small details that says this was pulled off by professional designers not a mockup by college seniors. Obviously no one told Elon that the ballistic glass was not in this early mockup. On the plus side very impressive specs and price point.
"Man I was afraid it was going to be ugly. And its so much worse than I thought it could be. Does anyone want to drive this?

Edit: To answer all of you. Everyone who replied seems to like it so I stand corrected. Guess I'm the odd man out in here. Curious to how well it will sell though."
Anyone else kind of amazed that most people find it ugly? [It's drop dead gorgeous IMO.](https://www.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2019/11/Tesla-Cybertruck-Electric-Pickup-Truck-Front-3-4-View-in-Hanger-2.jpg?fit=around%7C875:492)
"What annoys me most about this truck is it isn't practical as a truck. It is more of a Honda Ridgeline type deal, not a real truck. When Elon says ""truck design hasn't changed in 100 years and we want to change that"", well why exactly? The regular truck bed design is great. Having a 6' bed where you can't access the front 3' of it without climbing into the truck bed is a terrible idea."
"oh believe me, we are standing by very very hard

^^^that ^^^may ^^^have ^^^come ^^^out ^^^wrong"
Uhhhhhhhhhh what
This is the most retarded shit I have ever seen
"Help us all. This is horrid. WTF are they thinking? No one will buy this. I wanted a Tesla Truck, not something from Blade Runner, I mean really."
"This is a fucking joke, it’s the ugliest car I’ve ever seen."
This is a truck for somebody who visits Home Depot for lulz and IG posts. Good lord it's beyond hideous and not practical.
This cant be the real truck lmao
wait is this a joke or not?
"This has gotta be a concept, right? It doesn't align _at all_ with the brand"
How are you supposed to look out the back?
This thing has so much going for it... just not the looks
I like the ATV more
I feel weak.
"damn the truck actually looks pretty slick on the website ngl. Still, wtf"
[Broken window video](https://youtu.be/UBhzenID9LQ?t=1512)
That guy that broke the windows is going to be infamous now!
No way this is real.
Looks like it was rendered on an N64.
So... Where do the windshield wipers go?
[the tent back is giving me hardcore Aztek vibes](https://images.cdn.circlesix.co/image/2/900/600/5/uploads/articles/az-556d57ee3de9f.jpg)
Leave the angular design. What's with the door handles? Looks like a bad carpenter's work on some table.
"Man I'm really torn between two places with this truck. This design is almost nostalgic for me, it reminds me of being a little kid imagining what the future would look like this is that. On the other hand I look at this now and look back what Tesla has done before and just can’t help but feel it’s a terrible design by Tesla."
"It looks like a cross between a stealth bomber, a Delorean, and a Baja racer. The Xtreme sports crowd will love it. It will probably show up in a lot of music videos too. 

I wonder why the glass cracked though. Not that any one cares if their truck has stronger glass. I wonder if, when they dropped the ball on the real glass, it spread glass particles on the floor. It looked like he dropped the ball before he went over to the truck and maybe it picked up debris on it. Like how you can shatter glass with a small piece of hard ceramic from a spark plug."
"I think i got a confirmation window and my cc was charged, but i never got an e-mail. anyone else?"
Is it possible that someone coated the armoured glass with a regular glass to get the tinted look?  And Elon/Franz didn't know?
Electrek live streamed a ride in it.
"I made a quick basic poll because the comments seem all over the place. 


[Poll](https://linkto.run/p/7Z92YWQP)"
I love it!!!
Finally got a confirmation email.
curious about crumple zone crash safety too. sure the safety is first class as usual. my god the design team of this company is amazing.
Getting [Lady Gaga circa 2011](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-x8VYo2ejWk0/TdMpGvu4veI/AAAAAAAAFww/Nq8aTOKaB8o/s1600/Lady+Gaga+Black+Sequin+Dress.jpg) vibes
I dig the design tbh
Love it. I want to know more about the quad bike!!
Holy crap! WHO DA FUCK DESIGNED THIS SHIT? lol
"I’m not a traditional truck guy, I typically drive sedans (but I’m an above average height). I kind of like the look of this vehicle. My next vehicle purchase was gonna be a Tesla (probably the next 2-6 years before that happens). I might just consider this truck as the next move for me, to be honest."
"When you actually like the futuristic look of the car and assume others do, but then you start reading the comments..."
I see the Tesla team sprung for the N64 rendering engine
"Ok I've kept an open mind, i still think it's ugly"
[deleted]
I legitimately think they should consider having someone else besides Elon do the majority of the speaking at these events.
Some of you are delusional. This is uglier than a Pontiac Aztek. This is a truly awful vehicle
[deleted]
Rivian is  popping champagne corks right niw
"Theory: They turned off the wifi in the hanger when they cut the stream, and they are actually unveiling the real truck now.

At least that's the only positive theory I can think of."
Rivian is having one hell of a party tonight.
"Kinda surprised by the negative reactions to the design. I may be in the minority, but the current Tesla models are boring and not very good looking. Mostly safe and look like every other car. 

I dig how far out there is one is."
[deleted]
I was really excited about this for years. I honestly think it’s a devastating mistake. That thing looks like a complete mess. It looks like a billionaire toddler designed it. The original Honda Ridgeline seems like a step up
That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen.
Damn this looks like shit lmao fuck 🤣🤣🤣
"Everyone for months: ""People will likely be shocked and consider the design weird at first being so shockingly different""

Everyone now: ""EWW SO WEIRD"""
"My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined."
"I need to go to bed, can he stop fooling around"
"Oh no, Rivian stock shot up when that glass broke."
He is PANICKING
Fitting that this comes out in Los Angeles in November of 2019
"wtf it's real, the website is up now. It's real. holy shit tesla."
I am legit disappointed
Sucks to be on the east coast and waited up for that
"Damn... as a model S owner, i wanted this to be awesome. I dont understand how they made it look so bad, this is fine for a sci-fi show.. but damn, i dont see this being very popular. The rivian looks way better, despite the ugly headlight design.

I expected a model X with a bed.."
These negative comments remind me when the model 3 interior was revealed. The future doesn’t seem relatable at first but over time the designs will grow on you.
I liked people's rendered guesses better lol
They already made the live stream private lol
What happened to 300K towing
"I just think people went into this expecting a Tesla version of a consumer truck, and this just does not look right for that. I could see it for military or industrial use, and the look isn’t too bad for what’s supposed to be rugged. I just feel the material and overall shape feels too rough for consumer use. If they planned on a later consumer-focused redesign and wanted this event to be the unveiling of the industrial version of their truck, I still think that was a mistake."
"They went for the full 80's ""we really really really want to be futuristic but we don't quite know how yet"" aesthetic."
That price is nice but it’s so ugly. I wonder what the production version will look like.
"Hotrod.com has interior pics up

https://www.hotrod.com/articles/tesla_cybertruck_800_hp_tows_7500/?sm_id=organic_fb_social_HRN_191121_sf224283667&sf224283667=1&fbclid=IwAR2-u_PVM9b2LnsBi0l-i8yS3-Rca5Xpg23twZmaKYUTaHPu99-VY1X6gF4"
I personally think it’s quite cool. I also think they will be releasing a more traditional looking truck in the future for the people that want it.
idk why but i think this thing is so fucking cool
"I noticed how people are talking about its durability and its armored exterior, but I cant be the only one who thinks that the hammer swings had significantly different power put into them. The demonstrator slammed that demo door like it killed his mother and wanted the door to bleed blood, and then swings the hammer hard enough for it to tap the cybertruck. That, plus the glasses, and the very unconventional design...

On a serious note though: how is anyone supposed to ignore those giant blindspots made by both A pillar and the C pillar?

EDIT: spelling"
"The more I think about it, the more I think this will take a bite out of Ford and Dodge. Not the F-150 though. I think we’re looking at America’s next police cruiser.

The starting price is the same as a Ford Explorer Interceptor. It’s bulletproof, rust proof, all terrain and supercar fast. It doesn’t need gas, doesn’t sit idling for hours wastefully. It can seat 6, mount computers inside easily, and already has light bars. 

Why would a local police force choose an Explorer over this? They don’t care about looks."
"This thing is dope, ESPECIALLY the camper layout. I. Want."
Most of the fan renders are far more appealing
"This is the mars truck and they are selling to civilians. Think about it- it’s all armored with good off road capabilities, on board air compressor, etc."
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
"Once the window broke, it's kind of all you can look at."
"I was hoping that Tesla was going to target the industrial market instead of the luxury market, Rivian is arguably offering a better vehicle than the Cyber truck when it comes to soft pickups. With their unveiling of the semi I figured that's the market they would be aiming for, it makes sense since a lot of specialized fleet vehicles are based on the most popular pickups sold in America. Tesla could have easily taken the thunder from Bolinger and Rivian with a what could have been as simple as a box on on a skateboard just like pickups are now. 

The phrase ""don't fix what ain't broke"" comes to mind. The F150 isn't the best selling pickup because of its looks or speed or towing capacity, it's the versatility that sells it. Having the cab separate from the chassis is what makes pickups so popular, companies can completely strip the bed and replace it with whatever specialized equipment they need. Tesla is completely missing a huge portion of the pickup purchasing audience by making their platform too bespoke. 

Unless Tesla demonstrates that the Cybertruck has some kind of more advanced modularity to it I can see this being their first real flop as a company. They may have really missed the mark here."
Looks like fucking shit. Looks like a pain in the ass to load or unload anything from the sides or to tie down anything close to the cab. Fucking awful.
I feel like a lot of someones are going to not have jobs tomorrow...
"SAY SIKE ELON, PLEASE"
"As performance art goes, this was memorable."
"HUGE case of design over function. How are you ever gonna grab something out of it from the sides? + I am still thinking this is joke reveal to generate more hype.

Tesla fans will like this, but truck fans definitely will see the downsides from the regular truck design. This is actually a huge win for Rivian (https://rivian.com/r1t/), with their much more authentic, efficient and functional looking truck design. (I sound like a salesperson... ;)"
Tesla jumped the shark with this one. It's simply too radical in its aesthetics. WTF was Elon smoking
Elon needs to get some sleep. He's delusional. Can't string 3 words together. This is really awkward. The crowd just wants the joke to be over so they can go home.
First the thing was hideous. Then the windows smashed.
Oh no. It's over. It's not a joke. Oh boy. I'm a big fan of Tesla but that truck design is not good. Reasonable price though. Any boring design and that price with those specs would have made us all really happy.
"I'm actually dumbfounded that this is the ""final"" design. Here's hoping that they can add a few more polygons before it ships, ESPECIALLY the roof. As big of a fan I am for Blade Runner, this design shouldn't exist irl. Specs are amazing though, as always."
Soooo. All those mock up pictures actually ended up looking way better huh?
"Game changer- No more dents or door dings. No more rust . I like the design, so sick of bubble trucks with separate bed . its going to look sick covered in mud or at a construction site. This thing will be a stock beast off road at a better price than Raptor. 

I bet you can drive it underwater so this will be a popular mud truck

>fake tough

calling out ford.

Hes forcing ford , chev, toyota to commit to durability. Brilliant."
Well that was a dumpster fire of a presentation. It is possible to do a futuristic design that doesn’t make it look like it was designed by a coked out Ridley Scott.
Who the hell designed that? An intern?
"A few minutes ago I was like: ""I love the Roadster I want a Roadster!"" Now i'm like ""I want a Cyber Truck! I Love the Cyber Truck!!!"""
[deleted]
Did he ask an unskilled 5 year old to design it?
"Everyone: car companies are too conservative, all cars look the same, cars were cool back in the 1930s-1970s when designers were daring

Also everyone: wah wah, this is not a perfect copy of a generic Ford truck, I hate it, burn it, I will never buy it, Tesla is dead to me"
"Did he seriously just break the windows on this thing. What the fuck just happened. This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

What an awful plan lol"
tbh I hated the design when I first saw it but it's already growing on me
"Look... Here's the thing.

1. You buy the skateboard - it has the motor options, it has the battery options, it has the standard/long range/performance models etc.

2. Then you choose your body - you can just choose among thousands of body types. You can choose the interior comforts, the various styles. Truck, Car, SUV, etc. Some bodies are incompatible with some skateboards.

That way you can choose the psycho-truck, or a more sleek truck, or a very similar truck to the standard ones."
is this real? Looks like some shit I drew in first grade learning how to use a ruler.
"Looks cool.  Very capable.  Hauls lots of people and dogs, which is what most folks put in their truck, and covers the bed where tools and junk are stored.

Very powerful.  Reasonably affordable.  Looks like it'll off-road well.

Misses - most work trucks I see have racks for lumber and pipe.  Not sure how that's gonna work.  You can do a trailer, but trailers are bulky and inconvenient."
It'll be even uglier once they add mirrors to get it street legal.
People bashed the audacious look for the Hummer as well and it ended up selling like hot cakes to a niche market at a MUCH higher price than this with piss poor mileage and features...
Can I get an F in the chat
It’s going to do exactly what they want. Stir up attention and have the whole world talking about it. Anyone who sees that on the road is going to want to know what it is.
Omg it’s ugly.
As a city slicker - this is what I want! Bad ass wheels heading out of town and good enough plowing through snow in VT. ( And some mud in NH ). 500+ mile range is a game changer - off road specs appear exceptional! Take my $100.
"The amount of people talking about how ""ugly"" it looks shows how badly Elon screwed up the presentation.

Elon should have focused on how this truck will change the game for people who actually USE their trucks for what they are intended for. And he should have ended with a video showing it being lowered from a Starship on Mars."
I think they broke the windows on purpose. It's hilarious because now every news site has Elon standing in front of this broken ass truck. It's making me laugh out loud.
"I get the point, but the business side of me can only think, ""why?""

Tesla really could have dealt a deathblow before other entrants even tried to enter the electric truck market and squandered it."
My browser won’t load.  Showing 16-bit pixel outline of a truck like my old SNES

So fugly
"I really like the look of it. I hear people bitch and moan all the time that cars all have the same look now (smooth curves, generic body types) and then when something is advertised as a cyber truck they are disappointed when it actually looks like something from a cyberpunk movie... Shame."
It’s awesome to see someone do something different with designs when all the current cars look the same as each other.
hope there is some room to put some 33s on and maybe get like 12+ inch of clearance as well 🤞
Cybertruck coming with a flux capacitor confirmed.
It’s like a fugly ass back to the future car
Oh god Tesla just made a huge flop
"Is this real? It looks fucking retarded.

IT LOOKS LIKE A FRIDGE ON WHEELS"
SHOOT IT ELON ARE YOU NUTS
"Damn it Elon, start this thing."
"This looks like a ""future"" truck in a low budget, strsight to video sci-fi movie where they just stick a bunch of plywood on a golf cart and spray paint it matte silver."
He's lost his mind . What world does he live in . Rivian fir the win
Truly the greatest timeline
That's not a good look.
Elon definitely did not go over these slides much before this
"Tow 14,000 lbs? He claimed 200,000."
"Lmao glass is glass, just don’t go too further, that was cringe af"
"It looks like a [2007 Honda Ridgeline](https://www.cstatic-images.com/car-pictures/xl/CAB70HOT011B0101.png) that was rendered on a PS1 for Twisted Metal.

I know Mars is probably Elon's endgoal, but I think all they had to do was not go for a pointed top and this would be so much better received."
"it's just too much.  ""Neat"" for sure, but an F150 killer?  Not when Ford is going to have an electric F150!"
No. Just no.
The atv looks cool at least
Tesla truck is sickk hahah
I was expecting some space smooth circle thing. Initially was shocked but the more I look at it would totally buy. $40 or 50k? Done.
yo that atv look thicc as hell
"Were y’all really expecting something like this?? LOLLLL

I tried to preorder to give me time to decide or wait for a trim in round rather than that polygon they got going on there but the site immediately crashed. So I guess a lot of people are preordering.
where are the mirrors
"Y'all clearly don't understand that the key market is active warzones, I mean just look at that sloped armor!"
As great as this truck is looks is definitely not on the list. Did they make this car for people or for the army?
"Serious question, does the CyberTruck come with an AI holographic girl like the one that introduced it (since she/it explicitly said, and here's the man who created me) and is there a Catgirl version that you can upgrade to...you know for the memes?"
I paid my $100...but first delivery in late 2022! That is forever.
This is Tesla’s Deloreon

"Is the tray detachable?
The main feature of Pickups which classify them as trucks is that the tray is detachable. They used to also be known as a Brake.

This means that the tray can be replaced with any sort of cargo unit; typically a flat bed tray, canopy tray or custom storage unit.

If the tray is attached to the body, it is a Utility. (Typically Coupé Utility, or Ute)

That said, vehicle classification changes over time, while I would call the CyberTruck a 4-door Coupé Utility, some may define it as a Shooting Brake.

20 years ago, there was no such thing as a 4-door coupé. Ironically, a shooting brake was traditionally a truck with an estate passenger compartment in lieu of a cargo tray, now it means a 5-door fast-back estate wagon."
I enjoy the faux marble dash :X.  This thing is stupid
"Someone seriously tweet at Elon to change the roof, the rest can stay, but make it look like a truck roof instead of low poly rocks from ye olden games."
"I, for one is glad that this doesn't look traditional. There is so far and between new designs. I would however say, that a cybertruck could have taken different directions. But who is to predict how the future looks. This is an idea or concept on how the future will be in this segment.

At least it looks easy to hose down."
"The more I follow Elon and his brands, the more I think this is all a joke. God dammit, please raise your bar to the fucking Mars, Elon!"
"I didn't notice this until I rewatched (probably because I watched on my phone), after the ATV is driven onto the back of the truck the driver plugs it into the truck to charge."
The atv is the star of the show imo. I think some nasty atv and utvs would be very popular.
I think the profile is hideous. The front looks *okay*
Soooo is this gonna be a youtube link? So I can watch on my 4K TV?
"Wireless charging capabilities, eventually."
this is really hard to watch
It's growing on me
"I think the Delorean aluminum looks dull, put a good wrap in a different color, even camo and the thing is lit"
"I'm very torn in that the utility and performance numbers seem amazing, the price is incredibly reasonable but oh my god it is the ugliest truck I have ever seen."
I made a toolbox in 7th grade shop class that looked just like that.
Reserved mine. Counting the days...
"The $100 is refundable right? If yes, I'll just place an order for the sake of it."
Was there supposed to be an adaptive air suspension demo that failed too?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnsiZOJjfUg
"My only justification is a Tesla truck is coming and will be built in the same platform and extremely similar parts. Only way they will have volume to hit those prices

The cybrtrk will just be a botique"
"I pre ordered the tri motor. The design is different to say the least,  but I’m more intrigued with the performance, that’s insane stats for $70k!"
Looks like something I'd have drawn in 1st grade if a teacher had asked me to imagine a futuristic automobile.
"I love this thing - sort of looks like Lamborghini does pickup.  Of course, its not going to ever be an actual work truck.

One question I have though is what happens when you get in an accident with that shell? Do you liquefy ?"
"I kinda **like it**, but I think it should be improved **inside and outside**. I like the shape and the design language, but the real thing looks a little  distinctive from their renders they have on the website. Which are beautiful.

I need to sleep on it."
It looks like traffic in a 1990s racegame
Design is god awful imo
I actually like this thing. Like he said all trucks look the same and this is very different. I dig it
"I slept on it. Watched the reveal again, I'm starting to like it *shrugs*"
"When I was in elementary school we had some computer ""game"" where you could shape the profile of a car and put it in a wind chamber to see how fast it could go. This is the same shape that broke the game, so clearly Musk played the same shit and this vehicle will likely go 999mph."

I actually like this thing
Ugliest truck I've literally ever seen
He's gonna crash the stock then bring out real truck to crush the shorts
So should I buy stock tomorrow after it takes a deep dive?
"Dear god it is astonishingly ugly.

It looks like something the villain from a low budget 80s sci-fi would drive."
"Why is Elon trying to make the future based on what the past thought it would look like? The Semi nails the future aesthetic perfectly, why does this fail so badly?"
Black Friday sale on Tesla stock tomorrow.
"It actually looks good. The presentation was so hyped and so disappointing. Although to fresh set of eyes, it's super duper unique. An eye catching vehicle no matter what. It's like looking at a Lamborghini for the first time ever ever. Just so different. So futuristic. So sleek.

[Here look at this](https://imgur.com/a/9UQerjQ)

Edit: updated link to include reactions. Presentation was horrible yes and tesla fans had it so hyped. Show the pictures to someone who hasn't seen the presentation and isn't a fan boy."
get in here boys  [https://www.reddit.com/r/cybertruckmemes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybertruckmemes/)
AAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ELON WHAT THE FUCK 😂😂😂
"That bed looks unuseable. Honda Ridgeline used to have a similar bed side that angled up to the roof of the cab as well, but they ditched it because it makes accessing the bed from the side significantly more difficult. 

I'm not opposed to the general design language of the truck, but they need to work close with actual truck owners to refine it for actual use. 

Oh, and the glass breaking was awkward as fuck. You can tell Elon was pissed and embarrassed. 

Prediction: Stock drops $30 at open tomorrow."
"I believe in Elon's vision for nearly everything...

But this is the Pontiac Aztek of 2020."
As a Tesla owner and mega fan...this is terrible
The Rivian truck looks so classy compared to this.
[deleted]
For the haters:  This is Tesla pioneering the future of trucks and I'm all in.
"I have a feeling most of you will come around eventually.  I cannot wait to get this, it’s so bad ass."
"I feel like people are missing some really basic points of this presentation that make the thing seem fake.

Stainless steel skin? Stainless is both harder and heavier than steel - at a time when aluminum skin is becoming popular for its maleability and light weight, harder and heavier is the opposite of what you want for efficiency and safety.

Bullet proof glass? In the US it's legally required for mass-produced cars to have safety glass all around. Bullet proof glass is only permissible for low-production boutique vehicles. In fact, the prototype was equipped with standard safety glass.

The bumpers neither protrude nor are surrounded by plastic body panels which means they aren't street legal. You'll notice that Rivian takes the same approach as the Honda Ridgeline to bumper integration - a car-like plastic bumper cover integrated into the design.

No mirrors? The Semi was shown with both working cameras and mirrors, considering cameras aren't legal in the US yet.

Mechanically this seems to be a working prototype but design-wise it's pretty ridiculous and impractical as if it is a proof-of-concept prototype cobbled together as OEMs often do. The tires are just off-the-shelf mud tires with weird wheel covers on them.

There's just a lot about this thing that seems like either a proof-of-concept or a joke to me."
"Go home Elon, you’re ~~drunk~~ wasted."
"Honestly, I like the fan renders people did more than this one. This looks like how I drew trucks when I was ten years old."
Fixed it  [https://i.imgur.com/Pfvb6Kx.png](https://i.imgur.com/Pfvb6Kx.png)
"It looks like one of those prepackaged Landshire ham and cheese sandwiches that you can buy at the gas station, next to the forties and the milk."
"Tesla wins on price, Rivian wins on design and practicality."
I guess it's a truck for someone that doesn't need truck but liked to be seen as tough independent working guy by driving one yet cares about environment so he choose electric.
It's so ugly lmao
Frankly I'm going to be disappointed if it isn't the underwater car from the opening scene of Spy Kids.

So the truck should sell well in Latin American countries...?
Great more annoying LED lightbars in my mirrors. Definitely pushing for a lunar/mars rover contract.
I bet his truck drives out on top of it
Going after the inner city gangster market?
The more I look at it the more I think it would look OK if it weren't for the steel slope at the very back. If the frame just ended with a vertical break at the back of the rear window it would be OK.

Ooooooooooof
Why is this happening

"It must be April fools.   
Make the truck unique but I can't see anyone but the military wanting this design."
"The body of this truck is too wobbly, it HAS to be a shell of the real"
It's angular because forming curves out of that insane steel alloy is extremely difficult.
Imagine seeing this thing hogging the HOV lane on 101 lololol
"Also no renders on the presentation, Elon always does renders"
Elon brought out a tank
"It’s real!!!,! Bahahaha"

Wtf am I reading? Why is that Truck so quick?
Aerodynamicists hate him
"Man, the rear slope is the only thing making it look janky AF. Maybe it'll grow on us, maybe not."
I hope it looks better with paint.
I'm pretty sure I would drive this to drill an oil well.  Ok. for $40k I think I need one.
$40k
"That price, wow."
wow the truck industry is about to be in some turmoil
"those specs, that price, what. screw that it looks like a crazy bladerunner fuelled design-porn, the stats are pretty bonkers across the board"
70k!
ATV!!!
"LOL, oh yeah, we also made an ATV"
"So that's why they had the DeLorean out front, early attempt at the steel frames that this is now doing"
An ATV!
"We didn’t see the pick up bed at all....

Edit: foot in mouth"
ATV!
I never knew I needed an electric 4-wheeler until now.
Weird thing is they already went through this w/Model X. Did they not learn their lesson?
Reminds me of an F-117 with that ATV loaded in the bed like that.
Error 429 Too Many Requests
I’m trying to rewatch it - the feed isn’t showing up.  Working for anyone else?
Dual Motor or Tri-Motor?
I would buy one if I wasn’t... poor
I think the features are cool as always but I think that with the design they just wanted too badly to be different on the design front from everyone else and thats how we ended up with what we got
No interior shots yet?
Why is Tri-Motor AWD going to take a full year longer to be produced?
"Anyone got a stream mirror?

So will it come in other colors? Can you paint monochrome stainless steel? Or powder coat? Something?
I pre-ordered. Card got charged website errored out and now no email confirmation. Should I call them tomorrow?
"Did anyone see renders that were close to this? 

We shouldn't be surprised the truck's lines are sharp. The roadster 2 is much sharper than models that came before it."
All I want to know is if you can hookup a snow plow to this truck.
Is this a concept or will the production model be very similar to this?
will there be paint options? I'm confused
"I think what I dont like is the points on the upper rear tail gate, those should taper in, not protrude out.  And that there are no color or paint options.  If they fixed those two design points I could see the visual appeal doubling.  

Also maybe break up the door space a little so it doesn’t look like flat metal.  They do that on the other model."
"I missed the original live stream dude to work (live in Australia), is there somewhere I can watch the whole thing?

The tesla.com link just takes you to an ordering site now."
"If I order a single motor, can I upgrade to dual motor later? Or am I stuck with single motor and have to cancel it and start all over again?"
I drive something similar in Death Stranding. Can confirm good against BTs.
Is there a VOD of the unveiling
Is there a youtube link or any other means to watch - I can't wath it on tesla website - it's disabled now ;(

Also, if the glass isn’t supposed to break and the outer body isn’t supposed to dent, how do you get someone out that may be stuck or needs to be cut out with the jaws of life after an accident?"
"I wonder what the drag coefficient is.

Given that steel isn't light, especially in thick gauges, does the relatively low price & long range imply an improvement in battery technology?"
Is the design trying too hard or not enough?
It looks like they took the gable end on a house and used that as the profile for the truck. I think it looks terrible right now.

"With all those straight lines and flat panels and bare steel, I imagine you could wrap it in any color you chose pretty easily."
Overall I think the design is okay. But the rear is terrible. Boxy and plain
Warthog Ridgeline.
"Considering the tonneau cover obstructs the rear view, I wonder if the rearview mirror is actually a screen"
"Don’t cars usually have a space between the body and the frame that crushes intentionally to protect the driver, so if the car doesn’t do this then won’t it be dangerous in a crash.

EDIT: cars not care"
Anyone know the bed dimensions?  6.5 ft Length but what about width?
"

Most working trucks are 3/4 or 1 tons and I could see this maybe evoving into something larger that could also serve that role as an even more function built fleet vehicle step or two down from the Semi."
I would get it if they made it into an SUV
And the perestrian impact ratimg was?

"This is what happens when you stay in the Bay Area too long

This isn't what the truck market wants"
"There is no way that will be the final design. Here's the thing...

The features were spot-fucking on. Tough design. Tough glass. 120/240v power plug. Bed ramp. Huge battery. 500 mile range. 2.9s 0-60mph. Built-in air compressor. The features were almost perfect. (I personally think there needs to be a way to move very long things like pipes and wood and whatnot going all the way through the car since there's no engine or drive shafts to get in the way - but that's neither here nor there)

The design was a-fucking-bysmal. Nobody would be caught dead driving that thing. ESPECIALLY no died-in-the-wool, red-state, rural-livin working man. You drop all those features into the standard F150 cab, and you might dent the market. But with that design, you could make it Fucking FLY and nobody would drive it - let alone buy it."
Can't believe I stayed up for that..
"Ugh. Such a missed opportunity.

They really needed to show off the truck bed. No showing of the inside. Also I thought it was gonna have a battery for running tools. So many critical aspects that truck people want to see. 

And how do you go and break the glass on the thing. My mind is blown lol like what the actual fuck.

I wonder how far the stock will fall tmrw"
That was the worst presentation i've ever seen.
"cRight before the unveil I told myself.. ""I hope it's ugly as fuck, so I won't want one, and I can just pull the trigger on a Model 3."" I got my wish.... jesus fucking christ, what a train wreck! Is Elon off of his meds?"
Ok so no one's gonna mention the motorized bed cover?
[deleted]
"This is going to be the coolest, most desirable daily driver truck on the market in 6 months. Edit: yes, this won't be available for sale in 6 months. But it will still be the most desirable truck.

Here's why:

Fantastic approach/departure angles will lead to adoption by the off-road crowd. That will increase the influence and brand appeal.

Range exceeding 500 miles will attract rural commuters (like myself) who need both a truck and long range, but tire of spending on gasoline.

Better towing than f-150 at the price range. Much better performance in nearly all categories than the Tacoma - also in the same price range.

Top of the line Tesla costs just $1k more than top of the line f-150 (before incentives) and starts at $8k less than top of the line Tacoma. Average selling price of an f-150 according to kbb is about 8k more than the base Tesla.

I think the design looks great. It looks like a Baja truck crossed with a delorean, although I wish the sides of the bed were lower. Someone will make a flatbed with a gooseneck hitch for it anyways eventually.

The towing capacity is lower than I was expecting. I wonder if that's limited by drivetrain (Regen braking) or chassis. Unibodys are not regarded as being as strong for towing as body on frame. Of course, these specs will all be improved upon by release. TESLA generally unerpromises and overdelivers on specs."
"I don't understand how they went from the curvy Model S, 3, X, and the semi, to this fucking angular abomination."
"Waaaaahhhh, it is not an F150 with an electric motor. Waaaaaaaah."
Has to be one of the ugliest things to come out of the automotive sector in history. And people get paid top dollars to design this stuff lol
That dudes never swung a hammer in his life.
Has Rivian paid for this?
Real truck now pls
"At the price tag shown, I'd buy it."
What in the actual fuck was that
Cybertruck branding makes sense now. We all just got cyberpunked.
That thing is a f\*ck you to middle America. Not sure that's going to work out for them.
"bruh wht is that LMAOOO

keepin an open mind since i hated the design of the model 3 at first but later came to love it, hope the same happens here."
I remember when people mocked Apple when they unveiled the iPad... look how that played out.
RIP to the guy who insisted on throwing the ball again at the other window.
anyone canceling a y for this beast?
"My step-dad, a big pick up guy, has always been tempted by Tesla. This will put over the edge. I foresee him being an early adopter."
This is the closest I'll get to an electric Delorean... Move over Model 3/Y I'm in love!
"people are missing the big point:  


* it's not competing with the F150. it's competing with the jeep wrangler. it's a weekend toy truck, not a day-to-day work truck."
"There once was an odd looking truck,

With bulletproof windows - with luck!

His mate broke the glass,

What a pain in the ass,

There's no armour there, what the fuck?!"
"First I thought they must be joking, but then I see it is true design, it is like the last season of GoT, some might like it, but it is a joke."
This thing looks horrible.
Anyone else gonna buy this cheap Tesla stock tomorrow when it drops to $5?
It's ugly af

Tesla shareholders aren't going to be able to sleep tonight...
Can Elon explain how this is supposed to be road legal? If it's practically indestructible I would hate to get hit by one.

"No fake chrome grills. No plastic bumpers. No facade hiding an ugly chassis. This is just a pure, unapologetic tank of a truck. What's there not to love about it?"
"I have my 4th Tesla on order, but I've got to say, I thought his ""one more thing"" was going to be the real truck. This one looks like a movie prop. Very slick in a sci-fi movie way, but I think it's trying too hard. One of the great things about previous Teslas versus other manufacturers was that they made EVs that were also gorgeous, approachable vehicles. This feels a little like the i3 in that it's trying to go so futuristic that it's not approachable enough for the typical truck driver.   


I mean, people complain about the interior of the Model 3 being ""too different."" I happen to love it and disagree, but that's hardly as jarring. I suspect they severely underestimated the reluctance of people wanting that much change from the three top-selling cars in America.  


I'm not a truck owner, so I hope I'm wrong. I'd love to hear what F-150 owners think of it."
Take the weed away from elon

Price is the only saving grace lol
God the people in the crowd are so annoying. What's it like to be worshipped Elon?
Man you know Tesla’s Social Media team is losing their shit since they see the reactions first. This is so dumb lol.
Looks better with the ATV in than by itself but still this is way out've left field. Fingers crossed for Tesla on this one.

"I'm not ready to accept that we live in Blade Runner society.

Also, I feel like investing in a body kit company would be wise..."
So during the unveil I heard it will come with full self drive.  Checking the ordering page I see to add it for $7k.  Anyone else observe the same?
He made it out of stainless because he wants hollywood to use it in the back to the future remake.
"I love the design, as long as it doesn't affect the drivability. The glass shattering was unfortunate - that does seem like a *vulnerability*. Were people really expecting a run of the mill standard tesla truck ?"

>Tesla doesn't publish horsepower figures anymore, but we estimate up to **690 hp and 824 lb-ft of torque** combined from the twin motors in the Raven powertrain. The future **three-motor** Plaid powertrain will certainly find its way into the Cybertruck, and it could put out an **estimated 800 hp and 1000 lb-ft of torque**."

The dual motor AWD is going into production in late 2022 which realistically means you'll get one in late 2023 if you're lucky. They have a long time to get it production ready and I really hope they improve the performance and the looks.
This guy is really showing us the future and giving it piece by piece.
What if the broken glass is actually a stunt to get more media coverage for the new weird looking truck... all attention is good attention
[r/trucks reax](https://np.reddit.com/r/Trucks/comments/dzvqhx/tesla_truck/)
It's beautiful :)
"I dont think it is ugly, but it is shocking in a good way? I dont know how it will look like in 2-3 years  but knowing Tesla they will stick closely to the unveiled car with changes like maybe conventional skin panels, rear lights, mirrors, steering wheel etc.

There is definitely a huge space in the market for nothing other than an electric F-150, but there is space for this thing too. People love to be noticed and if this actually roams around on the streets you will get more attention than a Lamborghini. Hell it looks like some Baja Countach. Its a niche that has not been explored yet.

The great thing about Musk is, he does not need to follow any rules. No corporate look, no fitting with the rest of the in-house brands. Car design also needs to break out a bit. Every generation is getting less futuristic and more conventional. Especially in the pickup business where every new model seems to competing to see who can have more lights, bigger grille and chrome.

When the Model 3 clean interior look came out, I was similarly shocked. When Model S came out with a giant TV in the middle everyone thought that this some concept car nonsense.

Considering that this is Tesla, nobody needs to worry about the specs and pricepoint. What is announced is more or less what will be available in the real world. If this was shown by a Rivian (no offense to them, I love the R1T) or a Bollinger or a Ford, I would have been skeptical. But in case of Tesla, all people need to worry/concentrate about is the looks.

What needs to be seen is, will it be as successful as Tesla thinks it will be, or will they need a more conventional model sold alongside to balance this one out."
I’m sorry but is anyone gonna talk about the absence of rear view mirrors
This is what the Honda Ridgeline could have been.
"Someone check inside the tires! 

&#x200B;

Seriously though, the production is still a year out, it's only 100 to reserve and this is refundable. I suspect that this truck will go through a few more design phases. Which begs the question, why show it off now? Why tout super strong and likely thick stainless steel if it will be designed out because of weight? Or, the low flat front changed because of regulations and impact testing? Or the tailgate which seemed a little too heavy? Or that to use the bed you have to enter into it?"
Not sure I love it and being a huge Tesla fan I felt embarrassed for the Tesla team when the glass broke....twice.
"i love the angular design, i just wish it wasnt so low poly"
"PLEASE can somebody explain to me the benefit of having unbreakable side windows? They’re deliberately made to be more brittle than the windscreen for safety in the event of a crash or other emergency.

Doesn’t this just mean we can no longer save overheating babies from cars, ourselves from burning wreckages, etc?"
"If it's supposed to be unbreakable windows, what're fire crews supposed to do if you get trapped or if you're stuck in a car fire?"
Powers train sounds great. The box they put it in is underwhelming

"I thought it looked weird... then I remembered Elon's thing is to take us to Mars and beyond

totally a Mars truck design

Boldness is respectable. Go Elon and his thousands of brilliant engineers."
"And thus, a meme was born"
When you hire a low poly designer.
"I realize I'm in the minority here, but I like it. One thing I would definitely change though is the slanted angles on the bed. I think a reason a lot of people hate the design is because it honestly doesn't look like a truck because the bed is hidden with the two angled sides on top of the bed. If it were me I would hope there could be an option to have those side covers or not. And yes, while the rail for the cover is on top of those angled sides, you could easily just put them on a flat bed, which is already a thing."
At first I thought WTF! Now it’s grown on me. I actually really like it. It’s different! Would definitely love to give one a drive.
If you set out to intentionally design the ugliest vehicle that you possibly could I still think it would fall short if this. I challenge people to try to draw a worse looking vehicle.
First truck I actually like /  want.
I drew that when I was 4 years old.
"Is this an Apple thread? I really don't get all the negative reactions, I think it looks fucking cool."
"~~Elon had an opportunity to capitalize on a huge demographic begging for an electric pickup, then he shows us that? A wedge that looks like it was crafted by a blind guy in a garage? What a slap in the face.~~

~~I was waiting for him to say it was a joke, I mean that thing is just horrible. The ATV is the only product of value to come out of this.~~

I dunno I think I want one now."
"“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”"
"How anyone is surprised says more about you than the truck. This is exactly what everyone that paid any attention thought it would look. Elon literally said what it will look like and *shocker* that's what it looks like.

He's also said it won't appeal to everyone.

For me, I like it. I wasn't sure at first, but after looking at it more, it grew on me quick, a lot like the Model 3."
Huge Tesla fan but holy shit is that thing ugly
I've been holding off on a new truck for some time now in anticipation of this vehicle to replace my f150. Now I don't know what I'm going to do because I would never own this thing. Wtf were you thinking Tesla? The model 3 was beautiful. This is garbage! I almost thought it was a fucking joke.
LETSS GOOOO FUCK THE SHORTSSS DADDY ELON TAKE US TO MARSSSS
This was fake right?
"I predict people will be hesitant to preorder, but once they start popping up on roads, people will want them."
"I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS, ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT IT'S ALL REAL. Elon is our universe's John Connor."
I feel like this ain't real. This breaks Tesla's design language. I honestly thought this was going to be a smaller version of the Tesla Semi.
Does it look any more ridiculous than a Hummer?
"Between this and the starship exploding, Elons having a bad 48 hours"
"the truth is most people wanted the design to look different, but in their own way that they really couldn’t even describe if they tried. I like it. I don’t love it. I think the specs are crazy. I’d order right now if I could."
"I absolutely hated it, at first, but I have looked at more pictures and from the windows down it looks pretty normal. The “vault” is a cool way to get functionality of a truck with weather protection of SUV if transporting something. 

I am considering a preorder of the dual motor. Sweet spot for range and price.  My big concern is production is so far out, other companies are going to put out EV trucks with similar specs, features, and price. Most importantly they will do it with a “normal” design.  They have time to match Cybertruck stats and create a design that appeals to everyone.  They don’t have to hit 39k they can go for 45k if it looks normal and they will hold a large share of truck buyers.

The thought of rolling up to family Thanksgiving in this is actually pretty cool.


I’m tempted, but I’m going to sleep on it."
"Elon: makes e-car, looks like a car, sells like a car
Also Elon: makes e-truck, doesn't look like a truck, will not sell like a truck"
"since the Model S, everything has gotten progressively uglier. this thing is a monstrosity that will not appeal to the Ram or F150 crowd. Huge missed opportunity."
"This just in. Due to cost cutting measures, Tesla could not afford their CAD licenses any longer and will be designing all future vehicles in Minecraft. Love my model S but I just don’t see it on this one."
Who designed this truck a 10 year old drinking red bull?.The presentation was even worst.Rivian looks lot better and I understand Toyota is bring out a EV truck in 2020.if the F150 goes full EV and gets at least 500km it be a top seller.The torque itself should convince some ICE owners to switch over.
Here’s my prediction-this will be the first vehicle Tesla has to completely redesign before release because of wholesale rejection by the public and all but the most true-believing Elon worshipers. He lost his damn mind with this thing and I can’t believe better minds didn’t prevail in the design. Everything is fucking great except how it looks. Jesus Christ. I should’ve sold all my shares when it hit $360 today. It’s gonna fuckin tank tomorrow.
"This is bad.  I need to see better video of it, but this looks terrible."
"Theory time:

SpaceX has tons of stainless steel leftover from Starship.

Tesla's new motor is not fast enough for Roaster 2020 yet but got hella range.

Slap together there is CyberTruck"
"Is the bed a solar panel? We did not get any info on this truck. Someone explain the camper photo. Why is the dash so deep. Is there a frunk? Where are the side mirrors? This looks like a rushed project. Even the design was all like...hey Franz pass me a ruler...(4 seconds later)....THERE, a truck."
I cant help but hope Elon says JK heres the real truck tomorrow.
[deleted]
"I feel as though I’m the only person to really love this design. I don’t know how to put it any way else other than: it’s the best looking vehicle I have ever seen, I can’t even think of a close second. It sounds weird to say that..."
WT actual fuck? That thing is hideous and I owned a Ridgeline.
Expected filet mignon; got a diarrhea casserole.
That is one of the most hideous vehicles I've ever seen.
"I was hoping the ""oh wait"" was going to be a cheaper model 3, preferably under 30k, just to make other companies shit their pants"
"I’m not mad, just disappointed."
Look our glass is bulletproof. Broken glass everywhere!
"Does anyone actually think that what Elon had behind him is the actual and final design? 

The Model X was hideous back when it was a prototype. It looked like this: http://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/10/vueg833n_1fpyqnu7lqtityajk4cup7a6be6phhsbcq-1.jpg

Now look at the Model X now (design hasn’t changed much)"
"The guts of this thing are awesome. But 95% of current truck owners will never buy this thing. 100% of truck owners who actually use their truck for heavy work/towing will never buy this thing. Man I hope they change it up a bit before it actually goes into production. This does not fit the model of ""sell a billion of them"" this truck should be going for."
"The breaking of the glass was not a failure - the METAL BALL would have gone through the regular glass. They should have used the cracking as a selling point, not a failure."
Awww its the ugly truckling :(
Looks like the Rivian will be the Truck for me then.. this Robocop look I just can’t take..
"You know, it’s irrational but I’m kind of angry. No, not because I’m so let down by a Pontiac Aztek / DeLorean abomination, but because the company wasted so many resources on this and I want them to be successful."
"Listen, I'm a fan of Tesla and all... But holy hell this truck is fucking ugly."
"LMAO wtf is this shit? You’ll be laughed off the job site!

Edit: to all of the serious “ok boomer” replies let it be known that I am squarely a millennial. I just think this 16-bit, daft punk-looking ass truck is fucking hideous."
All y’all trashing this would 10/10 drive down the road in it feeling like the ultimate boss.
I'm disappointed lol
"We all imagined that it would be a beautiful truck, but it's not... It's really pretty ugly. But god damn if it isn't durable."
F
"This feels like it will end up as the Tesla equivalent of a Hummer. Practical for hardcore use, but not really that good for civilian use."
The point was that it looks different but functional. I think it's dope. Take my money!
"I don’t know who he is, I just know he fucked up"
"I'm goin with it being.. the niche market, he wanted to have fun with cyberpunk, initial production before the mass market 'more' standard looking truck after model Y production is stabilized. Possibly had to get something out to meet ""some sort of' truck promise to satisfy investors, but would not be suprised if this is a mock reveal too, or part of a mission plan to get other automakers jazzed to easily win the truck market, thus tricking them to help transition to EVs faster while Tesla stays focused on taking the sedan market.. haha so strange.. I'm polarized between hideous and actually uniquely rad"
Hey sometimes it takes brave Companies to do innovative things like this in order for us to progress into the future.
"Meh, I don't mind the aesthetic. My main objection is the slanted bed walls - I can't strap loads on those, and any kind of roof rack is going to need a fair bit of custom work to mount. Everything else - power, range, towing capacity - seems fairly reasonable."
Tbf why would you want shatter proof windows? Seems like a massive safety hazard
"thee cybertruck is like traps - you might hate it at first but sometime in the future you might get... a tingly feeling that you *sorta* like it

haha jkjk

unless...?"
"Why does it look like it never fully rendered, lol? I thought the cybertruck was a photoshop meme the first time I saw a picture🤣"
Guy's guy's guy's...  Elon's just trolling us.  The real truck will be presented to us this weekend sometime.  Relax.
"We expected this: https://d3lp4xedbqa8a5.cloudfront.net/s3/digital-cougar-assets/whichcar/2019/09/10/-1/tesla-pickup-truck-4.jpg

Literally make this truck.  Nothing different."
Oh god. They fucked it up. Time to short Tesla. Lol
He actually fucking did it.  He made Tesla jump the shark by building the ugliest truck ever.  That absolute mad man.
Huge let down for me :(   I was expecting cab-forward with a central driving position for optimal utility. Not a bunch of triangles with the Delorean treatment.
"Check out the website, it... actually looks not bad?.. idk"
"The only thing more cringey than that event is the font they're using.

(I still preordered one)"
Elon just built the [Homer](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw9gaEiQAxY) .
God it’s ugly. Rivian isn’t great but damn if they didn’t do worse than this
This is a fake reveal
"""Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the car for the average man... THE HOMER!!!!"""
Apple needs to hurry up and enter the EV market. Bring back curves.
Of all the skills Elon has—they are considerable—presenting in front of an audience isn't one of them. He's so bad at it that I get a case of *fremdschamen* and literally have to stop watching.
That is ugly as SHIT
"This announcement was like watching a train crash in slow motion.  
That guy with a sledgehammer obviously not hitting the car with full strength was pure cringe, did he think it's not noticeable?  

Is it designed to fail for some reason? Not enough battery production capacity?

edit: it's growing on me"
"I think you all are crazy. That truck looks great. My teens watching with me thought it looks awesome too. This will sale great. Maybe not to those why buy work trucks, but to anyone else. 

I want more videos!!"
"Soooooooo disappointed.  Waited over a year for this moment.  First words uttered after the unveiling... ""What the fuck is that?""  He warned us that it was Blade Runner esque, too 'futuristic' for most, etc.  I don't know what I was expecting but certainly not this."
That’s ugly as fuck🤦🏻‍♂️😂
"$39,900 is about $39,000 too much for this heap..."
"I think some of you may be missing the fact that this is going to be driven around in mars, this exact truck. They’re going to be mounted nose to tail back to back (96) inside the Starship"
"the exoskeleton is a bad idea.

especially in combination with the insane acceleration. this thing is murderous."
"Couple of thoughts...  


* I don't see any Tesla badges on it
* When it raced the 911 did you notice how far the rear suspension compressed?
* Even if you accept the design is functional due to the exoskeleton why make the wheels so damn ugly?  


Its a very early prototype, or a joke, surely???"
"Mostly cool, but I'd be more interested if they offered an option with a small cab and 8 foot bed, got rid of the sliding bed cover and folding tailgate, and made it less fucking hideous."
This looks like absolute garbage. What the fuck was the design team thinking
Yikes... and shipping late 2022.  Maybe they’ll have a design rework by then?
"No thanks, I'll wait on the electric f150"
[deleted]
"The TROLLS are out in force tonight...

The truck is dope!!!!

I am going to reserve!"
"Surely it can't be real, its so, so, so FUGLY!"
"I own a tesla car, solar panels, power wall. But wtf was up with the design. it was ugly as f-. it looks a bastard child between a hummer and a delorean. like a rejected concept car design."
That went from 100 to 0 real quick
This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen
Tesla threw out all the design decisions that made them popular in the first place.  This is a serious step back in electric vehicle design.  It literally belongs in the 80s and 90s where they all failed because they look like this garbage.
"Wow. I thought this thing was sick... and then I came here. A lot of unexpected and, IMO, undeserved hate for a car that looks like the fucking Batmobile. This thing is awesome!!"
"No way to put it lightly. 
It’s a straight up dud. 

First off, let’s discuss the opening monologue. To replace the market for the top three trucks with electric vehicles. 

Not going to happen. 

Build quality. Broken window(s), and jiggly doors. It’s a prototype, but still a huge letdown. 

Price is decent. 75% price increase for 500m range + tri-motor isn’t worth it. 

No real spec comparisons illustrated. 


This thing is ugly. I’m a huge Tesla fan, I point each one out on every drive I’m on. I am also a licensed contractor in a state that really needs rugged vehicles that also are capable of construction use. This truck will never be thought about for contractors, agricultural workers, or anybody for that matter. 

Here is my personal take on it from a professional perspective. 

I can’t access the bed of it from any angle other than crawling in the back. No lie, if this was a test out of a score of 100, this alone marks off 90 points. If I can’t get my tools out of the back without crawling in there each time, consider this truck dead. Now, can it take all of my crew to the job site? With seating for six, I can’t complain there. Air compressor, on-board electrical access are great. My ‘16 Sierra Denali has the onboard electrical, which can power my porter cable air compressor. Having it built in is a plus, but not a selling point. Can it haul lumber, standard length of 8 feet? With a bed of 6 1/2’, it’s possible but no. Long box is the only route for serious contractors. 8 foot bed is critical. 

Personal, non-professional perspective:

Holy shit, no. I wanted this to be better so bad, I am truly devastated. No amount of acceleration factor will curve my attitude. It’s ugly, for one thing. I’m not even talking about preference on looks, it’s just ugly. I’ve seen three phineas and ferb memes about this truck already. The electric F150 was shown to pull a million+ pound train. This can tow 14,000 pounds. Bwahahahahaha!!! Fuckin’ joke. My Denali can tow more. 

My Denali has heated seats and wheel. Leather. 8’ box. A bed I can reach from all sides. Middle storage. 

Here’s my hot take on the Cybertruck.

It’s a joke. No, seriously, I am legitimately still thinking that Tesla did this as an actual prank. In no way can they be serious about this being a viable option for ANY REPLACEMENT of ICE trucks. I can’t use this truck for anything other that the ‘cool’ factor, which I can’t even do anyways because it isn’t cool. It’s cyber, sure...it looks like it belongs in a video game. Cyberpunk. 


Their opening statement on replacing trucks? Every thing the trucks they are trying to replace can do, this truck actually can’t. 




Ending statement: I, amongst many others, implore Elon to rethink this vehicle in it’s entirety. Franz needs to be fired immediately. In no way should a Tesla truck be designed by someone who designs super cars. Trucks aren’t super cars. Period. A truck’s lifeblood is it’s ability to be utilitarian in any way possible. Ironically, this truck has limits so low that to be completely honest, the Drywallers that show up to my job site with sheets of drywall in the back of their Dodge Magnum (hey C!) (C knows my Reddit name, he’s gonna get a kick out of this) are more useful. 

Elon, swallow the pride and redraw the whole design. Eat the money wasted. Rethink it in it’s entirety. Trust not only me, but everyone who actually wants to replace our trucks with yours, because if this is it—then we’re not going to. 

My father’s purchase of ANY Tesla after his Yukon lease comes up this February was dependent on how Tesla handled their truck. I’ve spent three years trying to get him to go to the electric side. Never will he own a Tesla now. This unveiling was devastating."

probably not coming for few years at least.
I don’t think I can stay up another two hours to see the truck
"I literally just finished installing my NEMA 14-50 outlet, took me all day long... now I just need a Tesla"
Omg the back is even worse...
Barf. Sorry it's the ugliest production vehicle ive seen...
This thing is awesome
Low key it’s growing on me
I am really starting to like it
"Honestly, I love it. I want one."
Why are we getting this instead a proper s and x redesign
This is annoying. Just get to the actual truck.
He's gonna say sike soon right?
"it's... pure utility. overengineered to the last inch, but incredibly practical for very specific purposes. but good god it looks so weird. and elon has turned up his cringyness up to 11 tonight"
"That light setup doesn’t look street legal, looks fake"
It’s so ugly
I turned the stream off 5 seconds after the truck popped on stage. I wish I’d bought Tesla puts today.
"Okay, the ability to plug in things to the car and an on board air compressor is very cool. And the price?  Holy crap. That’s good. Just change the look."
He's gonna bring out the real truck at the end
How much has tsla dropped in after hours ?
Ok ill buy the fuck out of that
"So uh tesla.com/cybertruck actually doesn't seem to work...

nvm works now"
That was it?!?
Wait until this show up on Top Gear.
"Don’t get me wrong, I adore Tesla, but does anyone else think it looks like Elon got his hands on a Lamborghini and had his way with it? Also a song comes to mind... how does it go... “Anything you can do, I can do better”... is that it?"
I want to see it in white and red

"Tesla Cybertruck - The Delorean of our times!

"**Since the last poll is getting traction, I made another poll, go vote again- https://youpoll.me/24605/**"
What's the range under load? Not 500. I didn't see it anywhere.
Those huge panels are like a blank canvas to place my huge collection of decals. LOL
Anyone make a gif of the glass breaking yet?
How good is Tesla about figuring out multiple reservations under one person and refunding inadvertent duplicate reservations (oops...)? I can totally see them canceling the wrong one and the reservation being lost when production begins
"I hear the steering wheel detaches and drivers seats turns around so you can just drive in it reverse full time.   Jk, but prove me wrong."
I want one with a topper. https://i.imgur.com/big5uXh.jpg
Numerous people including myself and my roommate put a down payment to reserve a slot for an order.
"So far Rivian has my money, until I see the f-150 anyway. Forget the looks, the design and purpose of a truck is not there. I cant access the bed from the sides, tie down points in the front will be nearly unreachable. And are these ranges with a full payload or empty. I need to know how far I can travel with a full payload"
"Elon Musk looks like shit. Overworked of course but, damn, he didn't look healthy. Can't just be the meltdown he has during the presentation."
Rivian has similar base price. They also have marketed it for camping and off roading. Tesla had a pic with a tent on the bed of pickup but doesn't look like they put much thought how it should be.
"It's bold. I'll give it that.

Given that almost everything in 1980s cyberpunk has come true, we may as well adopt the aesthetic. Now all we need is mirror shades and some Rastafarians in high Earth orbit."
"I can see how it would be cost-efficient with flat windows etc, but it looks like it to. Not a big fan"
"For the base price, it really isn't bad. So much hate for a prototype truck, lay off and let them fix the kinks out. So what the windows smashed, did you expect them to make the perfect truck on the first try?"
"The future is here, and apparently it is ugly as hell. 

Also, it seems there are no gay truck designers at Tesla."
"I just imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger from the Predator saying ""You're one ugly mother fu@ker"" as it's unveiled."
TSLA stock down 6% because of this monstrosity
"Its that damn ugly the only way they could sell the look was by doubling down, calling it ""cybertruck""."
I have a feeling Tesla stock might be on sale tomorrow! Time to buy more!
"Congrats to Toyota for somehow having the ability to pass on the torch of the most controversial (in my opinion, buttfuck ugly) design of a modern car! Big weight off the Prius shoulder."
“How to buy Rivian calls” gonna be the top question on WSB tomorrow lol
"Is this a joke? 

I mean at first I thought, oh that's cool, because I've seen so many concept vehicles. Then I realised, they expect people to buy this? 

There are a couple of things I like. The lights and the wheels."
Cheers to Elon and the Tesla team for setting the standard once again. The 2020s will be another exciting decade of tech innovations.
"When the ATV looks better than the Truck.

Ai...Elon you are decades too early with that design."

Why is the sub on lockdown? Damage control order by the higher ups at Tesla?
I hope the Tesla Cybertruck is doing a Sonic movie first trailer...
"Hated how it looked, saw the price, impact demo and that ramp, hit order immediately. Need to update my flair. 
I’m now loving the fact that is is not conventional. You can see those straight panels will be doing a lot to reduce the production costs, especially with straight glass.
I’m in the UK and have no real need for a truck these days, (I’m currently transporting 3m wood panels and timber in a Corolla)but towing and storage is always handy, and I really want to go camping from this."
"With how much media coverage this truck is getting, it will become a legend. Actors, rappers, influencers will buy one and then the people will follow because of how affordable it will be. This is one of those things that people will have to get used to because their brains can't even comprehend this design. Conventional designs have gotten so stale and boring. Let's bring on creativity and innovation."

"I'm a child of the 80s. I remember StarFox and the F-117 stealth plane being the neatest stuff ever. The old lambo countache with the faceted shape that was almost starwars-y and was the coolest thing on wheels.

So this polygonal look is targeting my demo.

That is the goddamned ugliest vehicle I've ever seen."

"To break the mold you gotta break the mold.  This thing is perfect.  No huge grill, and blows the competition out of the water"
I hope they come out with a more normal looking truck in a couple weeks... really really hoping
im just so sad... and nauseous
"The reactions remind me almost exactly of when Dodge released their new grille style.  Some people loved it, most people thought they were out of their minds and trucks weren't supposed to look like that."
"Ok, WTF is this and why do i love it so much?"
"The front pillars that connect the roof to the hood are going to create massive blind spots if a person is driving.  It looks like a prop from a low budget sci-fi tv show from the 90's.  There is more to design than visuals, it has to [work](https://www.amazon.ca/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/ref=sr_1_1?crid=20G9CH0Y6FH47&keywords=design+of+everyday+things&qid=1574429790&sprefix=design+of+very%2Caps%2C157&sr=8-1) too."
"Still looks better than the PT Cruiser
 Change my mind"
"joggle1, standing by."
"Good for him. Performance and price it could destroy the competition. Might as well go big on your design

It’s a truck. It’s about functionality"
Seems like an unpopular opinion but I like the way it looks. Wish I had the money to buy one.
Elon say sike rn
I want one and my roommate ordered the tri-motor + self-drive.
"How can they even sell a solid steel truck?  I thought modern vehicle safety was due to government mandated crumple zones.  

It seems like if you are in a car and get in an accident with one of these things, it's guaranteed death."
That cybergirl shoulda done the whole presentation. “So.... yeah.”
It's cool and all... But it's a tad bit novelty to replace the f150 or Dodge Ram
"I’m really not a Tesla apologist, I think the fawning over Musk can be exhausting. I really dig the truck though, it’s a fun and insane design."
"Why do Tesla/Elon fans always talk like they're imitating Elon? Like as if they're on stage trying to convince you what you want and if you don't like it then it isn't for you. Maybe, just maybe, they came out with a bad product?"
I seriously can't tell if this is some sort of convoluted joke or if they're actually making this thing to be sold to the public.
[deleted]
"My question is this Elon: if your goal is to jumpstart EV use around the world, why release such a controversial looking EV? I would think you’d want a design that the most common consumers of pickups would like, so the most people would buy it. 

This pickup is so weird that I couldn’t consider it. Even if it looks pretty cool, has impressive stats, is priced reasonably and is bulletproof for some reason, I could never picture myself driving this around everyday. I just want a normal truck, ya know?  

Maybe I’m behind the times, maybe I’m close minded, maybe I’m just in the minority of thinkers, but what the hell does some suburban person who’s gonna commute to work and haul mulch on the weekends need this for?

Edit: I just saw a render of the truck in black at a different angle and I loved it. I would consider buying it in a different color or wrapping it or something."
The more I look at it the better it looks
Just preordered the awd version! I can’t wait!!
"That's the worst looking ""truck"" I've ever seen in my life, good lord lol"
This truck looks amazing
"To everyone saying the design is ""ahead of its time"" or ""modern"" or ""futuristic""...

No, it isn't any of those things.

This is the ""look of the future"" by 1980's standards, not today's standards. It looks like it rolled off the set of Blade Runner, Robocop, Total Recall, or Mad Max."
"Honestly, it's an ugly design. They got the power, price, except the design. Rivian is far good looking than this. Bit disappointing!!"
"Did they go with CybrTrk because Aztek was already taken?


On the plus side for Ford, the Mach-E is no longer the wearing the crown of *Abomination of the Year*... so they've got that going for them, which is nice."
Rivian truck looks WAYYY better. And for 19k more you get a better truck too.
The designer of this needs to hand in their designer card and do something else with their life.
"He jumped the Shark, no respectable plumber or farmer will be caught dead riding this space mobile. People buy pickup trucks because they are functional, not cool."
I just bought 10 SHORT puts for tomorrow. Stock is gonna tank
Please tell me I am fucking dreaming?! This was a completely terrible product launch of a terrible product!
Tesla lost lots of current owners tonight. I don’t think they understood the truck demographic.  I’ll have to wait till the rivin truck comes out.
"I think someone should open a subreddit for people who like the truck. It seems expressing any positive thoughts on it subjects the person to a witch-hunt and death threats.

Edit: A worrying amount of replies to this seem to not have a grasp of the concept of hyperbole."
So many people laughing about the glass breaking. You do realize that any normal vehicle would have been obliterated from the same sledge hammer treatment. This thing is almost roit police certified... For 40k.... Let's that sink in.
"If all the cars on the road looked like DeLoreans, the cybertruck would be an appropriately futuristic and cool design, just ahead of the curve enough to be exciting but conventional enough to not be terrible.
Unfortunately for tesla we don’t live in that world. 

The truck flies in the face of all current vehicle design, and not in a good way. Previous Tesla vehicles have been futuristic but still keep the same general shape and concept of the alternatives already on the road. It prevented them from looking like hideous concept cars"
"No mirrors to use while backing your trailer. Truck is unable to accept tool box, back rack, fifth wheel hitch. No way to mount snow plow.... This was supposed to compete with the F-150? Dumbest thing I have ever heard in my life. Elon never should have said a word about the F-150, that was a mistake."
Is this an early April Fool's joke?
He said if this didn’t sell he would do a conventional truck. Get busy elon.
This thing is way sicker than I could have imagined. Gonna be the best selling car in the country.
The Rivian looks way better/nicer/more useful/practical. Huge missed opportunity.
"I was going to buy a new Jeep.  I started to read about the cybertruck... ok, I can wait.  I’d spend about $50k on the Jeep, your move Tesla.  I was all in, just watched that live!

I’m into it! Weird looking but cool. Looks better with a human for scale. Faster than the 70k model 3... I want one.
"Didn't we have steel cars in the 70's that ended up killing passengers in accidents because the steel was too rigid?, and the vehicle having no crumple zones meant that the entire impact force was transferred completely to the passengers inside upon impact."

This looks fucking amazing. I dont care how many people disagree. Mark my words this will set a trend for future car designs. Elon is out here changing the status quo.

Stop joking around Elon!
wow that looks horrible
I could be wrong but I don’t think that this is gonna sell. Not a fan 👎🏽
Elon's lack of sleep is finally starting to a toll on him apparently.
this has to be fake.
HOLY SHIT LOOK AT THAT.
That’s a dead blow hammer not an actual sledge.

What's the range going to be from this while towing at capacity?
Can’t they turn it around?
All right here it comes!

ok the electric stealth atv is FREAKIN DOPE

will they drive it in?
Wow nice ATV!
What is the trimotor for $70k?

Do you think the estimated range is without a payload? how cool would it be if it had that much range fully loaded
What were the dimensions?
The specs look amazing from the site though
Are they gonna paint it??
Easy cop
This will look great once they figure out how to produce anti-gravity pods.
Stainless steel like a DeLorean.
Reminds me of the assault van in Tango & Cash
"how many seats for each configuration. Unfortunately the tri-motor one with 500m range will be available only in 2022 end. That is  eons away :-(

&#x200B;

Time to finally buy a Model 3?
I'm wondering if a KC light bar on the roof just in front of the high point of the roof would help smooth out the sharp angle?
Dr. Emmett called....
:kappa
Where are the side mirrors?
"I’m kinda liking the “simple PlayStation1 graphics” type design on this truck, it’s a little different and looks appealing. Efficiency/performance wise, I feel like there’s one of the most common issues which I’ve already seen being the size of the bed and the inability to grab something from the angle of the frame,  

..no side mirrors.

I feel like if you want something that looks different from everything else out there, while still having a little bit more space for passengers and storage than a basic Tesla, get this. If you want a better-use truck, with a larger bed, better storage/compartments and a less “complicated” design, you should hold out and wait for something better to come out. This is still just the beginning of Electric trucks, and with how innovative Tesla and other companies are getting, I don’t see designs slowing down for a while."
"Is the size worrying anyone else?

In comparison with the f150, the cyber truck seems to be at least a foot longer."
Does anyone have video of the second window breaking lol
It’s called the warthog!
so when is the cyberquad coming out?
Now the sandcrawler meme makes more sense.

"Not sure if it's been mentioned yet, but do you think the military might be interested in this?"
"I love it but hate it at the same time, if paint doesn't peel it would make a great Canadian truck to receive rock on highway and all"
"I like it, but after seeing tons of first ride videos, I have to say the rear 3/4ths are not its best angle. The triangle roof also in real lighting conditions does not look good. And the finishing of the truck really looks like it is a placeholder/test mule of some other chassis. Light from the front light bar was seeping out through other panels."
The hubcaps make the entire wheels look hexagonal.
"After seeing it, my three year old said ""and I think it goes under the sea, too."""
Love it.  GM will go great with my Diesel Gladiator Rubicon

"Honestly, im so stoked for this. I'm not yet able to afford a tesla, but seeing all the advancements being made in the electric car industry, is great."
I just want the quad. Any info on that?
I agree but when he started by making a claim like “transparent metal” I sincerely envisioned it like a metal. Till it shattered like glass.
Does anyone know approximate height or tire size?
"Anyone know how a crash would go with this? Given that the steel won’t crumble, wouldn’t that cause more force to be exerted on a driver since there is nothing dampening it?"
"Where can I get a scale model of it? Be cool if Tesla released a scale model, maybe with a metal body."
SELL SELL SELL SELL 📉
Who tf in Tesla thought any of this was a good idea?
I kept waiting for him to reveal the ***actual*** vehicle...
"All function, zero form. Somewhere someone should have stood up to Elon and said this is a terrible design."
This shit ugly
How are we supposed to believe the specs and price if it’s due out 2-3 years from now? $100 deposit is a dead giveaway that this thing will never see the light of day in its current form.

"I feel this was a good time for Tesla to win over more of middle America with an EV truck, but this definitely won’t do that. The event seemed like it was focused for consumers, so either they actually meant for this to focus on industry/military use, or just did not design this truck well."
I’d love to have this truck. Takes a dump on ford dodge and Chevy
I hope they will change the looks of it. At this point it similar to drawings done by 4yo... C'mon tesla you can do better.
A truck for people who don't actually want the functionality of a truck. At least they know their demographic.
Saw a bunch of “normal” trucks on the road this morning. I think this CyberTruck is going to sell like hot cakes.
Did their stock already crash? What an ugly thing...
"I've had some time to digest and although its incredibly different, I can't help but think todays launch was an absolute disaster. 

Ever since the launch of the model 3, I've been disappointed with the launches. 

Also I sincerely doubt that Franz had much input into this car and honestly it shows. The design as cyberpunk as it is,  looks really unpleasant to the eye.  I think there will be a small population of customers but I think they've wasted a lot of development money on this project. If they sell 20,000 cybertrucks a year I would be amazed. 

Personally they should have released this as a concept car at a car show to get a sense of the public interest. You get the impression that am echo chamber formed around the design team due to all the secrecy and as a result they built this.  Using this car as a launch car is going to damage the brand. You want every product that you make and sell to have massive market appeal, something they have achieved for every car except this one. 

As a shareholder and a model 3 owner this was the first time I questioned my investment in Tesla."
"Its not real, right.  


I also see the reservation fee is $100.

  
I mean, its a joke, isn't it???  


ZOMG my stock..."
" This design is for Mars, not for Earth. I hope Elon realizes that this is a big mistake, and orders a full redesign. The design should appeal to the masses for profitability and electrification of the fleet."
Tesla will be over 1k tomorrow this is insane.  Ford is done!
"I like the design.

Reminds me of the Warthog from Halo 1."
"If I had the money I would buy one, I’ve always wanted a true stainless steel car. I was so disappointed when I found out that the DeLorean was mostly fiberglass with stainless sheets on top."
"Do we wait till april fools day for the real truck? I mean, no way is this it...no way....help....please, ...wake me up."
[deleted]
"Yikes, Musk, are you joking us ? This would push more people order Rivian"
How is the truck design even street legal?
I love it actually. Something so simple and perfectly utilitarian about it.
This looks like a failed rocket league car add-on pack that they have to throw the word Tesla on 1000 times to get people who are fans of Tesla to even consider buying it. I'm sure it shoots a silver stream that says tesla out of it's tail pipe and it's reving engine just sounds like a dialup modem.
It’s ugly
"I'll throw my vote into the ring: I hate it.

This is not the way to win over the public.  I'm actually a little ashamed I own the same brand as this thing."
Telsa blew it.  Very very few people will buy this.  The truck crowd will be sticking to their trucks.  Actually disappointed in this unveiling.  I was hoping the real truck was under a facade but that was just the rolled steel design.  Guess in the future if I need an EV truck I'll look toward Rivian or Ford.  Elon did keep dropping hints that if this didn't sell they would build a more conventional truck...better start that Plan B.  Or better yet get that Semi Truck going to save real emissions.
You'd have to pay me 40k to drive this thing
"Christ. This and the new Ford EV being a 4 door CUV ""Mustang"". Real bad week for EVs."
Spectacularly underwhelming.
How do you guys not see the marketing ploy?
I hope they take all of their cars in this direction with the design refreshes. The old models look nice but they are boring.
"Welp   my next truck is this   

https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/rivian-r1t-test-mule.jpg"
Feels like April
This shit looks like a decepticons shoe horn.. smh... Here take my money . The specs are amazing
That truck is cyber ugly
"It looks cool but paint the damn thing. Showing me it’s bulletproof is good enough for me. I don’t need to see you hit it with a sledgehammer...

And what benefit does metal glass give you? Doesn’t seem like a great value add. And it destroyed the presentation.

RWD at $40k is a bummer. No way anyone orders that version and it will disappear like every other single motor model.

250 mile range for something meant to carry load and tow isn’t enough.

God knows what the interior looks like or what other features are included. How do the doors work? They look automatic but they didn’t even open them.

This was a bummer. Rip my shares."
In other news.... tesla stock on clearance tomorrow
The futuristic design is really good looking. I don't know why people don't like it
Hideous
"This will sell zero units to the current buyers of trucks. Flimsy interior you can't use with gloves on. No ties downs, not office center console, odd windshield angle has bad vis on job sites. Steering wheel is shit for driving because you can let the wheel correct. No step sides, not enough cup holders the list is pages long. It really is like they took every metric I've ever heard used to sell a truck and said fuck that."
ITT: a bunch of boomers who still want the truck designs from their childhood.
"I’m convinced, and I’m not kidding, that this Tesla truck is a joke. The $100 fully refundable deposit is a way for them to gauge demand. No Tesla logo in any of the pictures of this thing. No way this is the real design. Plus no mirrors. Too suspect, and I am a huge Tesla bull."
Live stream of people entering the event: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptyN89O7T1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptyN89O7T1M)
"The guys from Tesla Time News made an interesting observation about the contrast between Tesla events and ones like the LA Auto Show. Tesla events have this really chaotic, don't fully know what they're doing feel. But the LA Auto Show was ""like clockwork."" I don't know. It makes the Tesla event sound just all that much more exciting. It's all about the tech and the product with minimal time to polish a presentation."
holy shit this is all so amazing
Self-driving is an additional $7000
"I missed the event, is there a mirror somewhere? I can't find anything on their youtube channel and stream is private."
I'd just like to direct your attention to the new home of Cybertruck memes: /r/cybertruckmemes/
"There's still time to take it back, Elon. Do the right thing."
Sorry but I love curves...
This car looks amazing. If I wanted a new car again I'd definitely be interested.
Did he put a fucking hatchback on a truck?
What model did they use for the tug off vs the 150? If they used the tri-motor one then they should have at least done it against a 250 with a diesel. Torque vs torque.
"I was really hoping that this would be able to to convince some of the people down here in Mississippi to shift over to electric; unfortunately, it looks like that wasn't exactly their goal. If the made it look more traditional and focused more on a high towing capacity, I could see at least some people picking it over a f350, but definitely not as it is now."
I surprised no one is talking about the steering yoke.  Yoke's work on airplanes because full deflection of the ailerons can be had in 270 degrees of rotation.  A yoke has no place on a car where it takes multiple complete revolutions for a tight corner - doing switchbacks up a mountain for example.
"Functionally this looks terrible and I was looking forward to an electric truck hitting the market and trading in my frontier. I mean how the hell are you supposed to get stuff from the front of the truck bed without climbing in? The ground clearance on the back looks awful, how much worse is it going to get with drywall panels in the back or a 4 wheeler. Jeez I hope this is a joke"
"The guy was not swinging as hard on the Tesla, and the panels were flopping all over the place. Lots of smoke and (shattered) mirrors."
"I’m sorry but this truck looks like someone brought a 6 year old’s drawing of a truck to life. Terrible, hideous design and I agree with whoever it was that suggested it’s a joke because it looks absolutely ridiculous."
"How did you get the formula right up to this point just to fuck it up with the ""truck""?"
"It looks like the creation of a lazy kid in a Pinewood Derby. The ones that would make one cut to the block and turn it into a triangle. I mean I'm sure people will buy it because it's like a Picasso and stands out, and that's like a majority of Tesla owners. Like being vegan telling everyone they're vegan or paying $400 dollars for an extra $10 camera with an iPhone upgrade. It'll be another symbol of smugness and people will buy it just so everyone knows.

That is just ridiculous for a ""truck"" and most everyone in this thread is saying it."
"If you are a 'truck guy' and this is a no-go for you because of how it looks, you aren't really a truck guy."
"Wait are y’all really melting down or is this all trolls?

Wtf were you expecting??"
what an ugly piece of shit
"It's the fucking worst thing I've ever seen. And he mocks the shapes of all trucks but the reason they are all the same shape with a square bed is because people like to reach over into the bed, and it's convenient. Elon knows nothing about trucks I swear to God. I'm buying a rivian to go with my model 3. Fuck."
I wish it didn't look like shit lol
"looks like george lucas syndrome.  when he has all the creative control, it turns into some crappy fantasy."
All of the renders that people had done looked way better.
"https://twitter.com/yadeer_/status/1197736994589175809?s=21

Ooooooof."
"Bleh, that bed design... This is definitely not going to be on the list of anyone who needs a truck for work."
"This can't be real. Seriously I must be dreaming. I know I'll probably wake up in the morning, load up Tesla's website, not see the CyberTruck listed, and have a good laugh."
I like it.
Man. Bummed.  Was set to order one immediately.  Hope there will be a less radical looking version with the same specs.  Just not for me.
[deleted]
They're pulling a Sonic the Hedgehog. They will rework it and unveil something dope at a later date.
Does anyone else believe this is a big fake stunt; aka “War of the Worlds”.  I think Tesla is better.  This thing is f@cking @wful.
The truck looks badass to me!
"So admittedly I'm an outsider here, could someone explain the armored truck market segment to me? approximately how many armored trucks are currently on the road, and how is tesla going to compete in this sector?"
"The single only thing, in my opinion, that they keep (no pun intended) missing the ball on, is the fact they have not combined any sort of solar panels on these vehicles. ESPECIALLY with a truck. Most people buying a truck intend to take it places cars can't go, ergo places without power most of the time. Sure, the truck has 120/220v plugs, but Elon made the statement ""you don't need a generator, this IS the generator"". Um no it's not... Hook up a few things to the truck and you'll be stranded in a short amount of time. ALL they need to do, for all their vehicles, is include solar charging somehow. If people could get stranded and just wait in the sun for a few hours to get them back on the road, SO MANY MORE PEOPLE would be willing to buy these vehicles! But right now it's just so ahead of its time, yet not far *enough* ahead, that it's a borderline unintelligent purchase. I really thought this truck was going to be the future in that aspect. Now it's just a low-poly Halo Warthog and included Mongoose. Awesome, don't get me wrong, but I want awesom*er,* Elon!"
I don’t understand the hate... I really like it. It’s supercool tbh

"I like it. It'll be interesting to see how it competes with Rivian for the electric truck space. Rivian already has the advantage of being first to market next fall, Tesla looks like they won't start rolling them out until late 2021."
Is this just for the new game? Or is this an actual production car
The car that Homer built.
"The funniest thing is that once the glass broke early on in the presentation, the busted windows stayed in frame the rest of the night. All the pictures people want to take, and Elon had to break the glass so that every photo taken would have those massive welts in the background"
The specs and guts check out.  A redesign of the look and bed design fixes it.
"Is an automobile allowed to have that kind of pointy corners?   I'm just afraid of people injuring themselves by just accidentally hitting that pointy corner.

Also in case of accident involving pedestrian or cyclist, wouldn't that corner possibly cause much more damage to a person than rounded corner of any other automobiles?"
Say sike right now.
"The truck looks so ugly. Like you set the graphics settings in a game to the lowest, and so the game renders it with low poly count.

Not to mention that painful to watch presentation. I can't imagine this will sell well at all. Why not make an actual pickup truck?"
This is something Elon should have custom built for himself to bomb around in the hills near Gigafactory 1. This is not a production vehicle that people will buy.
"I'm a huge nerd, big into cyberpunk, love Blade Runner and its sequel, big Tesla fan...but this truck is just ugly. And as far as I can understand, this is meant to be aimed at people like me.

I'm interested to see if the Tesla fanbase can keep this truck profitable and if people will Emperor's New Clothes themselves into thinking it's awesome but I really don't think this truck is going to be successful."
"I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing.

I bought a Model S because it's a premium-looking sedan that stands out without being obnoxious, unlike every other electric car that has to look like a shitbox. The S is cool. It's fast. It's unique but it still fits the mold of a large, sporty sedan.

I bought a Model X because the S so thoroughly won me over on the electric drivetrain. The X is a bit more out there but I was willing to go with it for an electric SUV.

This Cybertruck? No. This is ridiculous. This tells me that Tesla is not very serious about competing in the single biggest segment of auto sales in the US. This does not realistically compete with the F150 or Ram. This is stupid.

If I'm a shareholder I'm starting to think Elon really needs to quit the car business to go play with his spaceships if this is the nonsense he wants to spend his time on. Tesla has a real opportunity to continue to revolutionize the automobile market, but it's not going to happen with goofy concept pickup trucks that won't scratch the surface of market share. Big miss and a bad sign."
"Welp, I thought I wanted one, but nope... That thing is ugly AF."
"I was giggling the whole way through the presentation. I kept thinking give it up Elon, we know you're punking us. It looked like something my crazy ex neighbor hacked together in his garage...while drunk....did i mention crazy?...and drunk?"
"I love Tesla but... Jesus. That design is just hideous. 

I was right. The automotive world is already tearing Tesla a new one for the odd looking Cybertruck. Outside the Tesla bubble, it's a mean, unforgiving world. 

What was Elon thinking? I had very high expectations for this vehicle and we ended up with a Johnnycab."
"It looks like a first grader traced a Tangram piece and gave it wheels. Barf. 

Seriously, why can't electric vehicles look normal, instead of something out of a late '90s future movie? I was actually really excited about this one, but it looks like I'm gonna keep burning gas..."
I was excited... Not anymore... That is one ugly vehicle. Good performance or not I won't be driving one...
This thing is disgusting lmao
"Not only is this thing hideous, it’s a total death trap. Who was the genius that decided to remove the crumple zone?"
It looks like a pinewood derby car.  Terrible design. So disappointed.
"They were very specific to call this the cybertruck, maybe the actual pickup for the general consumer is still coming later"
Is Elon trolling us with that design?

"Placed at least 3 orders, kept getting timeouts on payment processing. So far 3 pending on my CC, but I tried 5-6 times so might have more coming....

"You know that there is a point where something is so ugly that it loops around and becomes affectionately homely.  Think cabbage patch dolls and croc shoes.  I wonder if this made it?  It is so boldly hideous that people may buy it just for the ""ug"" factor.  If it performs very well and is priced affordably it may sell in spite of its looks.  Some will want to own something so anti-establishment for the rebel tag they'll earn."
If you need a real electric truck I would suggest www.bollingermotors.com
There more i look at the design the more I start liking it. Its very unique and i like that.
It's ugly..
Woke up this morning to find it’s still ugly. Darn
Stock is down by -6% already now. Still a brilliant move?
"Serious truck owners don't care how it looks like as long as it's utilitarian af, this hits all those check boxes."
"What a pathetic excuse for design.  The sad part is, the Tesla fanboys will actually make this a success."
All the people saying it's ugly are going to say they loved the design since the beginning once these hit the roads
"This thing looks like absolute shit, wtf lmao"
"This is a joke right?  I thought Tesla wasn't trying to make stupid looking electric cars.  Oh, I guess this isn't a car, it's a stupid looking truck.

So we have *normal* looking electric cars, a *normal* looking SUV and now very weird boxy electric vehicle that looks like it came from the fucking 80s that only a handful of people will buy.  Seriously, it looks awful."
"I gotta be honest, that's the ugliest design I've seen in the last 15 years."
Y’all are screaming shout busted windows but literally any other vehicle’s window would’ve have broken and fallen apart
Now theres a Tesla for assholes too!
It looks like a 3rd grader drew a 2D model of a truck right after they discovered you could make straight lines with a ruler.
"**TDTJTS** - The Day Tesla Jumped The Shark  

IMO The bigger lesson here is that Tesla is now corporate zombieville...Because apparently NO ONE had the balls to stand up and say ""Elon...this thing is fucking hideous"""
Rivian is laughing all the way to the bank...Elon ran out of polygons with the previous models!
tesla legimately combined a hummer and a ridgeline and thought people would like it
It looks like something a kid made with legos. I'd guess the only people that will buy this will be the Tesla fan boys.
A lot of blind fanboys in here. That shit was ugly af. Nobody in the target demographic is going to replace their current truck for that monstrosity.
[If only](https://i.imgur.com/XKP48a5.jpg)
There is no way this is real. That was a total disaster
This absolutely has to be a joke. No mirrors? What about crumple zones? There's no way this thing is going to pass any sort of safety testing.
This is the ugliest truck ever designed .. I was excited but not anymore
Wtf did they just cut the live stream? I love Elon and Tesla but this was a total failure I feel for him :(
And I thought the 3rd-party renders looked bad.
[I still don't like it but this is my idea that helps a bit](https://i.imgur.com/fdfdVaA.png). It looks like it could be easy?
Can we preorder the 4 wheeler? It looks nice at least.
Can someone good at photoshop change it to have one more angle/line on the roof? I think it would look so much better if the roof had a small flat section between the front wedge and the rear wedge
https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/11/22/tesla-cybertruck-is-ugly-as-sin-there-i-said-it/
I can see the ambien is finally getting to Elon musk
"Nobody would be caught dead driving this thing. The features were awesome. To say the design was stupid is offensive to truly stupid shit. With that design, even if he made it a 100% safe anti-gravity flying car nobody would be caught dead flying it, let alone buying it."
"So disappointed. We were fully ready to become a two-Tesla family.  But now that I’ve seen it, no fucking way.  Ugh.

This actually annoys me as a stockholder.  Granted, it’s less than 100 shares ... but still ... wow ... even most of the crazy renders were better than this thing."
This feels like an epic prank. It looks like shit and they pulled a Napoleon dynamite when they smashed the windows lmao.
Elon... you fucked up. If you want to sell to the masses don't design a shitty 80s futuristic movie
Y'all are wildin' if you think that was the play. Congrats Rivian on winning the EV truck market segment.
OMG  TSLA call holders are crying right now
Bed time.  This was a waste
Wtf?
That looks like how the 1980s envisioned trucks would look like early 2000. Sorry but no. The ATV yes please
Its like that ugly friend that you love anyway
/r/awfuleverything based on looks
It’s a steampunk truck.
"So, you can’t see out the back without cameras?"
It looks like the personification of a Vox article.
This will be the new Hummer

"LOL

Unveiling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuNa58eN1ks"
"Take this mechanical asshole, and get it off my fuckin street!"
Yikes. At least the Rivian and Ford will exist to fill the gaps for people that like trucks.
That's a tiny bed. Hope they hsve varying bed lengths.
This thing seems aerodynamic as fuck.
"I like Elon and Tesla for what they want to achieve in the world.  
I think this design is too weird and futuristic.

It's cool, sure, but for the nerds, you know?  
I don't know, man. I think maybe, this design is too far!  
The Nerds(me) will love it, but what of the common man???  
YOU'VE GONE TO FAR! (I have not gone far enough!)  
The question becomes, then.. Is there still time to redesign the concept? Have the Eminent Elon sunk too much into this design to just say ""Fuck it!, it doesn't work! Back to the drawing board!""  
Or is the design set in stone, from a sunk-cost perspective?  


IDK, man. I just want Tesla and the Musk to succeed.  
I love that Nerdy guy <3"
"I'm very surprised at the price ranges $39,900 - 69,900 (+$7,000 with optional self-driving). It makes it affordable for anyone with a middle class job. This isn't me (yet) unfortunately. I'm not into cars, never have been and i cant even tell you how to guage the oil in a car or how often to put water in it, but if i had the money i would buy one of those babies. It's not a car, it's the future."
Too lazy to read the articles. Does loading the bed with material (say bags of concrete) drastically reduce the mileage on the battery?
"Pass, that thing is butt ugly"
"Still not convinced that this is the real product, but if it is, oh boy. This thing is a disaster.

I'm disappointed because Tesla actually had a real shot at grabbing a large portion of the truck market."
"This is going to flop. They tacked a mass market pricetag on a niche market vehicle. There are some great bones here, like utilizing unibody construction vs B on F, and the adaptive suspension, and even the front end of the vehicle, but they went too far. I'm shocked that Franz is putting his name on this."
"Welp, Rivian just won electric pickups. But also that's fine."
Either this is a bad joke or Elon has finally lost it
"Its beautiful. We are entering the 20’s. 
This is the future of automotive design."
are the hate comments serious? This is the most forward design I’ve seen in a long time. So sick
This can't be street legal. There are no side view mirrors. No side markers.
"300,000lb towing capacity lmao okay Elon"
"Graphic artists do ya thang

Modify the cybertruck we were presented to look more palatable."
"I remember the sheer amount of hate the original Tesla received, exactly the same scenario. This will skyrocket; I'm ordering one just to upset everyone who thinks it's an abomination."
This thing is hideous. Why would I want a truck with less cargo-space that looks like Robocop when GM and Ford are coming out with EV versions of their normal truck lines? Rivian looks better than this and THAT thing looks like a reject from the Bladerunner collection...
"Specs are fantastic, but I won't buy it because it's ugly as hell. Maybe Rivian and Ford will own the EV truck market because Tesla isn't getting it done with this."
"ugly af, but this can open up the doors on a whole new era in vehicle design."
"This isn’t a truck lol

It’s ugly as fuck gg Tesla"
Wtf is that shit? Maybe they should talk to The Pentagon for a contract on their next APC.
"If the Model 3 is like the iPhone, this thing is like the Star Wars prequels. Musk may have just gone full George Lucas."
This is what happens when people's minds are blown. They cannot comprehend how awesome this thing looks. Give it time.
I’m so disappointed in the design - what is the point? You lose so many potential customers by making it like that. You’re already fighting an uphill battle to get them to adopt an electric truck and now the design is just another hurdle.
Remember when elon smoked pot? Yea he's still high
Uglyest thing ever.
Typical Elon fashion.....he's late. At least Ford Mustang EV was on time.....Urgh. 11pm is already late enough Elon
 Alright boys we’re good after seing those prices
"Wow, for $40k I might actually buy one. That's $35k after the Colorado EV incentive."
W.T.F.
"To me, Tesla is synonymous with beauty and that truck falls very short of the standard it has set."
"Why would they make something so ugly, does Elon hate money?"
Damn I really like the Tesla white cars with white interiors.   This thing is too much.....   specs are awesome but fucking thing will never look good pulling my boat    damn shame     I dont give a shit about hardness of the door
"On the order form it has an option for FSD, but there's clearly no place for any cameras on the exterior. If this is it, it seems like they should have put more time into the development before sharing this."
The body design is too much for me
"I see a lot of people complaining about it’s design etc, all I know is that about 3 of my friends and myself have preordered it and 2021 can’t come soon enough."
"It's beautiful - ""Le beau est toujours bizarre"" (what is beautiful is always odd) - Charles Baudelaire - It's also logical and physics/ material and design  state of the art,  I like!

PS. Capitalizes on super hard steel and design from Space X, big moat for competition. Also has the effect of making all newish EV trucks look dated too. So, good move!  And I suppose there will be great OEM or after market rubber gizmos to soften or customize the (maybe too) angular looks/ parts."
Looks like the B Team at Tesla designed this.  Lol.
"I was expecting the hype to hurt the unveiling, but my first reaction was 'That thing is ugly as sin!'."
"To put it simply, It's a monstrosity. I'll stick with the Model 3."
Ugliest car I’ve ever seen
are you people serious? i’m seeing multiple posts saying they like the design? you’ve gotta be kidding lmao
Elon is 100% playing everyone. There's no way this is it
"Just my opinion but I think there are many signs pointing to this being a hoax announcement.

1.)  Steel is a terrible material to use for body panels and the website touts 30x pressed stainless steel.  There any many more modern materials and manufacturing processes that would be much lighter weight (some up to 75% lighter), less likely to permanently deform on impact, more likely to crumple and absorb energy from impacts, higher weight to strength ratios, etc.  Aluminum, Fiberglass, Carbon Fiber, etc are all proven to be much better alternatives.

2.)  The aerodynamics of the body shape and ride height look like they would induce a terrible amount of drag and lift.  Electric motors or not, propelling this vehicle through the air would be highly inefficient and potentially unsafe?

3.)  Not sure how the three motor setup would work for AWD?  1 for rear axle makes sense.  2 for awd on two axles makes sense.  4 for independent corner propulsion makes sense.  3?  Does the third motor just independently shift power between axles somehow?  Is it some kind of powered differential?  Maybe an engineer can provide insight on why you’d want a 3 engine config?

4.)  I mean... look at it..."
"Holy shit boys. I 100% apologize for making fun of the Mach E. This is so bad, what were they thinking???"
Reminds me of homer simpson’s design in terms of ugliness.
I love it. Fucking cool car.
Love it. Looks like it's from the future.
I was worried Tesla would make another truck that is just a fancy car like everyone else but instead they actually made a truck-truck!
"The truck looks cool in the sense that it's futuristic and unique but the design simply isn't practical. There's a reason that the flat roof and standard bed design has been around for a while because it's useful. Trucks are for utility, carrying heavy stuff in the bed, towing, going places that regular cars can't, etc. While the cyber truck achieves towing and off-roading, the design doesn't allow someone that will use a truck for its intended purpose a lot of flexibility (especially since the bed looks a little short). The specs are amazing so I think that if they designed a standard truck with their own tesla flair then they'd have no competition but for now I'm assuming many people that are truck users wouldn't want that design."
[deleted]
imagine having no taste and hating this
They are out of their MINDS! It looks like it was designed by Homer Simpson!!!! BWHAHAAHAHAHAHA!!! Absolutley fucking HIDEOUS!
Maybe update the interior of the S/X instead of wasting time on the ATV.
"So where’s the 300,000 lbs towing capability?"
"""better sports car than 911""

No, absolutely never. Handling is the most important part of a sports car and a 2 meter tall 3 ton pick up truck is never going to go around a corner as well as a Porsche."
"So for the actual “truck” version, it’s $70000

The car that looks like a low polygon ps1 with 2wd is $39000. Can’t paint it cause paint is hard for Tesla, if you scratch it or dent it, I can’t imagine the cost for repair, the (super strong glass) isn’t strong. 

Still liking rivian more in the truck department of EVs.

I’m sure some people will buy it, but those who actually need the full “truck” capabilities are better off with rivian. If you want a big looking car, the $39000 is for you."
Whoa...they literally just raised the price from $100 to $150 to order LOL!
"I dont get how this is going to be functional at all beyond towing and even then the range is a big damper. Hope anyone buys this will enjoy being able to get at any cargo exclusively from the rear of the laughably small truck bed. Was hoping to replace my commuter car with this but not only is it hideous, I couldn't do half of the things that I would need it for except maybe getting to work in inclement road conditions and pulling a trailer."
"So many people suggesting the market is contractors and work sites.

where I live, most truck owners use them for daily drivers, to haul the boat to the beach, and to go Home Depot on the weekend.  The Tesla is absolutely a fit for that use.

I own a truck, and it’s never seen a job site."
Welp looks like sales wont be that great based off looks alone.
"Nobody: “Elon, what would it look like if John DeLorean designed the El Camino?”

Elon: “I got you.”

So we are back to shitty designed electric vehicles now huh? 

Missing the sexy."
"Breaking news!

Tesla stock on sale November 22, 2019! Get it while the anger over cybertruck lasts!"
People saying it looks ugly were just expecting another lookalike of Ford F-150.
"That design is hideous and doesn't look like the trucks of today!

Ok boomer"
So out of touch with reality
"ITT: status quo bias. JFC 

This thing slaps. F all y'all 😊"
I am struggling to understand why a $69k electric pickup truck can not tow more than a $34k petrol 2500HD
"If Tesla can capture 3% of the market that's hiding out in their basement collecting canned food and planning for the Zombie apocalypse ... they might sell three of these. I really want to know the market for futuristic armor trucks although if you were going to design something... this might be better imho:  


 [https://www.designboom.com/technology/karlmann-king-ground-stealth-fighter-armored-suv-03-15-2018/](https://www.designboom.com/technology/karlmann-king-ground-stealth-fighter-armored-suv-03-15-2018/)   


Seriously I don't know what to think. I know people put down $100 and we will see but the lack of colors and customization choices, seem like it will be a limited market."
Aaaaaaand ima buy a Ford because they don’t look like dogshit
looks like ass
"This wasn't a fun Truck unveiling, it was more like me watching my stocks plummet. Thanks Elon."
Looks so fucking dumb.
"that's the worst looking car i've ever seen

the designer needs to lay off the weed and video games"
"Yuck that's the worst designed vehicle I have ever ever seen in my entire life. What 5 year old did they hire to draw this thing in crayons with? That's not futuristic that's a block of metal with wheels. I don't care how fast it is , how far it can go, or how much it can tow if it looks like that. Tesla has always designed gorgeous luxurious looking vehicles and this looks so terrible. I just want to crush every single one they made light them on fire and leave them to rust somewhere they would never see the light of day."
"I totally see why they chose that design. Some people will go for it. We all know that the bigger the truck the smaller the penis. With this one I am not sure what it says. I would much rather see this than the a-holes with giant wheels and custom crap that don t need a truck at all but think it makes them look cool to the ladies.

If you are the only person with one in your area you will get a lot of envious looks. The F150 guys will laugh only to realize later that they were wrong and in 2 years claim that they liked it at first but could not buy it at the time.

This is innovation for design. Something that doesn t dent is great compared to anything that can t even take a small bump and when you use your truck all day you are bound to quickly damage the exterior.

I suspect the triangular top is because of the structural strength. If it was rounded it would look better but would not have the same strength I guess."

It reminds me of some of the concepts Bertone would think up in the late 70s/early 80s...and of course the yachts from Wally. The nicest thing I could say is that it looks interesting.

Lol that moment when Franz throws the ball bearing at the window. Ooops
Truckla
Wait is that the new Minecraft car I keep seeing memes about?
Only beats the F150in towing? Damn. Hoping for a 350.
The tech is incredible but the outside styling looks like it is made for the next Troy movie.
A new vehicle for a new generation of chads
I could see this maybe cutting into the ranger/colorado market but definitely not the full size truck market. The towing battle/porsche race/ glass demonstration also didnt prove much to me. We have already seen the model X acceleration video with a trailer so nothing new here really.
I bet you thought your dream of an affordable Tesla was alive. Or your dream of a revolutionary EV technology was alive. Or your dream of a well designed EV truck was alive. Nope. They're dead. They were taxidermized by Truck Tesla.
So many people bothered about looks is why humans will continue full speed to the cliff.
BRB pre-ordering a Rivian...
"How is this street legal? I see no airbags, no side mirrors, exterior doesn't crumple apparently. This thing is a death trap."

"Man, I sure hope nobody bought stock today."

"The ATV really saved this presentation.

I'm fucking dying.
"It looks different for sure. Would take some getting used to, but the specs are insane!

Unfortunately the trimotor model (which the range is the biggest buying point for me) is out of my price range by a good bit. :(

the ones that are affordable do not have a range that makes it worth it."
So even online (while placing an order) you can’t see the inside unless I’m missing something.
Looks like all those fan renders were not too off after all...
Does anybody have a gif or vid of the glass moment
"Off the first picture and the ""armored car"" comment i expected this to be a 6 person cab forward with standard size bed. Ditching the frunk is the only way to get 6 people and a standard piece of plywood into standard truck dimensions.

I dont see this as a truck person, or workers truck, this is a yuppie truck...you know the ones down in new port and laguna that have 100k in work and not a speck of mud or a scratch on it."
I dont think I could sit into the back seat all the roof line is just silly
"I think that the general consensus is, ""Man that thing is uniq- ugly. Come on, its pretty ugly."" I have this love hate relationship with the design thus far and I'm really not sure if its due to my love for Tesla. Honestly though, it almost seems way more relevant for commercial use. Maybe if they showed it like a compliment to the semi, it would make more sense considering how cost effective it can be with that pricing and those specs. The on-board outlets for using tools and everything - totally construction, durability and off roadability - totally construction, and overall seems like it could be great for that. 

Granted, it would be great for consumers too if it wasn't so, ahem, paralyzingly ugly."
"Game over man, game over."
"Maybe [relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inrI2qvps58https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inrI2qvps58)?

This thing is hideous. I hope it will grow on me. I wonder if they tested it with focus groups to see if people in the market for a truck actually like this design? What about the massive blind spots?
"k thanks i hate it. kinda really disappointed.

hopefully, another company that takes trucks seriously releases a electric truck. Why tesla you gotta do this to me :("

Like I said, I have been anti car all my life and this is the first one that just makes sense to me. I dont want to marry my car like everyone else, it could look even worse and I wouldnt give a shit."
5 minutes added to the countdown...
Wtf wtf wtf
He is trolling you all. Obvious this isn’t the finished truck.
All this thing needs now is a Flux Capacitor then Elon can go back to 1955 and try to get his dad to not to be a nerd.
"Just woke up to see this.  


Overall, the tech and performance is all there and even more than I hoped for. I would prefer a more conventional aesthetic and I think the unconventional looks may hamper the popular appeal of the truck. But....I'd still get one since I like tech and performance.   


Are there any performance categories in which it won't be ""best in class""?"

"As a vehicle engineering employee, I am sure this car will not be released to the road like this.. You will never get a type approval..."
The thing to keep in mind here is that it’s not meant to be exclusively a utilitarian truck. It leans more towards a “lifestyle” side of the spectrum when compared to the F150
[deleted]
I think this is so ugly. Looks like they'll work on Mars. Reminds me of the DeLorean. At least he's keeping the price point decent.
This thing will sell really poorly and be discontinued in two years.

Oh holy hell
"""You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in late 2021"""
website dead..
So if he turns it into a work van.....
does anyone remember the L W H dimensions elon had up on the screen during the presentation? they aren’t on the website.
Awww man.  I thought the first response said late 2020. Im kind of upset now.
Good point but side impacts are pretty common as well
[deleted]
"He dreams big

I dream big too, but he realizes them."
But where's my tailgate
Auntie Entity needs a new ride! Thanks Elon!
"I don't follow Tesla closely or anything but I was curious about this truck, but I'm not seeing a price tag. Anyone know approximately how much this will cost?"
when / where can we rewatch the livestream?
"This reminds me of the minimalist cars at the Peterson Museum. Maybe it was designed by Kolhaas?

https://www.designboom.com/design/design-disruptors-rem-d-koolhaas-joey-ruiter-car-design-petersen-automotive-museum-07-07-2019/"
Does this have a box?
"My reaction when I saw this thing:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1UtRnGn5hc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1UtRnGn5hc)"
How bad is it if you shared a pic of your order screen and it has the tracking number?
"So how does the Tri-Motor work? I'm trying to imagine the engine configuration for this. I can understand dial motors, since that allows for AWD. But where would a third motor even go?"
"Is it just me, or does this fit into any cyberpunk setting?"
"Does anyone know what ""pulls ∞"" means?"
So who won?
"Even with all the challenging features, the one that probably needs to change the most is a superficial one: The finish.  Something bothered me when I first saw Cybertruck - the dull metal looks haphazard.  If they prettied up the metal finish even a little bit, it would look way more actually futuristic and less ""toy"" like.

Otherwise, I'm actually starting to warm to the idea of Cybertruck, having seen videos of its movement and interior."
"https://youtu.be/K-s4gu3gVx8
skip to 2:30"
"I just want to know if the single motor $39,000 model will have 4WD capabilities or if it will be an option to get 4WD for it."
Does anyone know that if you pre order and its your turn in the queue can you move backwards if your not ready to buy yet?
"Can someone please explain the 300,000lb towing capacity? Thats like 160 metric tons."
That spray paint job was doing the look of the truck no favors.
"Like this guy’s concept was actually pretty close!

https://youtu.be/5Yt4xN4qWD4"
"Pre-ordered with Apple Pay, 2 cards both said failed, but my statements say they have been charged. And no confirmations :( 

What do I do?"
"Bulletproof. Where does he think we live? Iraq?

The only place I've actually needed a bulletproof vehicle was in combat zones."
Extremely ugly. Back to the drawing board.
April Fools?

"Elon musk is happy for ford making the Mach E.
Then roast the hell out of Ford with the Cyber truck."

Honestly it’s dope. Imagine cruising up to a party in this thing. Everyone would love it and wanna hop in.

[This is what I was expecting](https://insideevs.com/news/383249/tesla-truck-vs-f-150-ram-silverado/). Instead we got the Homer Simpson version with broken windows. I was planning on buying this but now I don't know.
Ugly. They need to do a normal truck first
"I thought it would be a new design, not a El Camino from the future? 

https://imgur.com/xJiZtIT

Really thou, what a turd. He could have done almost ANY of the designs that were predictions, and they all looked better... even that stupid one based on the mars rover. Instead he shit on everyone who needs a truck, and wants electric."
It is not a truck. At best it is a Subaru Brat with larger tires. I was interested in a Tesla truck for my next vehicle. Maybe one day they will google what a truck looks like.
"[Elon unveils the Cybertruck, circa 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw9gaEiQAxY)"
That thing is an abomination!
This looks like the future as a perspective on the 60s. Ugly as ugly gets. Good pricing  though.
Pontiac Aztek designers are loving this...
It doesn't actually look like that...?
Ehh it grows on you .
This think is a tank! love it
I'm pretty sure elon is just trolling. Look at all the free publicity and debates he's going to get.
"Why is the URL under a directory called Model 3 when you view the background image in studio?

`https://static-assets.tesla.com/share/tesla_design_studio_assets/MODEL3/NVRPx9o6kxjwvf.png`"
"2 days after the events of blade runner took place, this shit gets revealed."
[deleted]
I think it’s ugly but I was never a buyer in the first place so my opinion doesn’t truly matter.
You've all been punked. The real reveal is still coming.
I wish the model 3 had that design
"I dig it, very futuristic!"
People disappointed it doesn’t look like a truck haven’t yet realized it’s a personal tank.
I love it
"Wow, that is one ugly vehicle. I don't know that Tesla is going to win over the ICE truck owners with that. I also wonder if the truck bed is big enough compared to a full sized conventional pickup truck. It looks more like a small pickup car. It's one thing to think outside of the box for an electric pickup truck in it's design. It's a whole other thing to make it so weird and/or ugly looking that you keep people from buying it. I would have thought that even taking the look of the Tesla semi and scaling it down would have been a better option."
LOL at the window shattering. What a failure this is going to be
[deleted]
"They will never be able to make this for anywhere near 40k

Also prob wont look like this anyway, there weren't even side mirrors"
I know it’s “Ugly” by today’s Standards but it actually looks kinda badass too me like we’re in the future.
Its so fucking cool!
.
Do you think they cliniced this thing even once?
Is that solar PV panels on top ?
"It immediately reminded me of the Pontiac Aztek, but uglier."
Did Homer Simpson design this truck?
"Also, if someone is out to buy an electric truck, this is the one. It is apples to oranges with a lot of the comparisons"
cool
Guess this means Rivian finally has a competitor
titty fucking christ that design is... something.
"Yawn.  Seen it before. The Simpsons designed a futuristic car with features nobody wants back in the 90s with ""The Homer.""  And Ford did it as far back as 1957 with The Edsel.  

Seriously why the fuck is it armored?  It seems like they had a 9 year old boy do a dream board and never talked to any actual truck owners."
"Look, if this is legit it's a future classic for sure! Imagine the crazy value surge for the original model after all this controversy."
Finally! A vehicle that middle class American moms can use to transport their kids to public schools and also avoid the gunfire in the parking lot!
"What’s also so disappointing is that some of the speculative artistic renders looked so good. I was fucking hyped for this. Christ Elon, ever heard of a focus group?

I guess every company made a flop at some point right?"
Just went live! This thing is amazing! [https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck)
"The glass break was planned. Free advertising, who cares about bullet proof glass."
"I love it. Based on the design it looks like it has focused more on comfort , day to day basic needs ( no need for generator) &  safety. It looks like a truck made to take damage and not harm the car or the person"
"No 4WD? Ouch.

edit: Well I guess everyone thinks AWD is the same thing as 4WD, lol. I know from reading the specs that Cybertruck has AWD, but I am disappointed they aren't offering this truck with 4WD. That's kind of a huge selling point for many truck owners."
[deleted]
tesla.com/cybrtrk forwards to tesla.com/cybertruck now! This is new!
I’m planning on them starting at 8:20 or so.
This is it boys 10 secs!
Bets they just come out with the truck first thing and bypass the fluff?
Yes!!! I love it!
"I mean, have to give it credit for the durability"
What a beast
That’ll Buff Out
This is the worst unveil to date. You can tell the crowd doesn’t like it.
I can already see the r/SPACEXMASTERRACE memes
Welp.
Elon musk is a terrible presenter. He's so cringy
see the back of that thing? rear ending it would be the end of most cars.
"""BUILT TOUGH"" 

LOL shots fired!"
Man it looks so much weirder from the front
yeh..yeh..yeh
Okay that price is nuts
Hmmm no side view mirrors...
"The stats are good, but that look. I liked it slightly more from a distance, but still can’t get over that triangle."
People keep mentioning how it looks like it came from Back to the Future and DeLorean but those are like 40 years old!
Noooooooooooooooo
[deleted]
Anyone want to guess how many miles it can actually haul 14k lb trailer?
what sort of cargo capacity will this have?
What will the total length of the vehicle be? I'd like to be able to fit it in my 20' garage since this thing is gonna get vandalized or stolen in seconds if I leave it parked overnight in the driveway.
would you buy a wedge model 3?
"I just want a Onewheel and an electric, 4WD, flat deck wagon that can [haul a few sheets of plywood](https://www.reddit.com/r/onewheel/comments/dzypq7/cybertruck_alternative/)."
[deleted]
I really want this...
"I was actually super impressed by the vision and features of this thing.  Glass faux pas aside, it’s impressive if a bit 1980s sci-fi.  I was bummed that the tailgate and ramp weren’t powered though.  The opening and ramp deployment looked really clunky relative to the rest of the aesthetic and features."
"I think you overestimate the amount of guys  that use a truck as a tall car

Besides think this knockoff Delorean design will appeal to them?"
"Okay, I kind of feel at fault for this.  I said if he put certain features and went angular itd do better than a stylized california el-camino made by a designer.

*facepalm*

I was thinking more like the aftermarket bumpers.

Now - that truck does have alot of features, and it's likely a beast of a truck.  I need a few days to think about things before I judge it.

But I think the windows and the body shape detailing are the two misgivings.


But... the purpose of a truck is to be a monster of a machine that works like a bitch and does what you need no matter what.  It's to be durable, strong, and resilient.  Something you'd ride off in during the apocalypse, or build your kids' houses with.  It's a tool, not a fucking fashion statement.

In some ways, this might actually be exactly the point.  And in that way it's starting to grow on me."
"I see many people complain about access to the bed from the side being problematic on the cubertruck. 
Any chance someone can make a composite image of the cybrtruck on top of the f150 at same scale?"
"I just want to know if I can open the rear window, crawl in the truck bed and wake up at my destination. ... I would leave at 9PM and just wake up ready to play in a new city."
"After placing a deposit, are you supposed to receive an e-mail confirmation?"
"$49,000 max? Interesting"
Looks super impractical for anything but towing. Real question is how much does it weigh?
"What everyone is forgetting is, this might have been built for military and spacex use.  Civilian sales are just the bonus."
That is a fuckugly minivan.
Swing and a miss. I hope the production model looks better.
[deleted]
"Elon  Musk has taste up his ass.

The truck looks like it fell out of the 1980s version of Tron."
$100 deposit still doesn't entice me.  It's terrible.
"HAHAHAHAH THIS BETTER BE A JOKE

WTF ELON"
Looks like the offspring of an El Camino and a Delorean.  $70k to get the towing capacity I'd want and the bed is useless.
Would never consider buying that. What a gimmick.

He's screaming at the intern who broke the glass aws
"Wow, I had to go google Audi AI:Trail just to wash away the ugliness of this shit."
"Built in air compressor? What do they do with the water that forms when compressing air? I live in Michigan, would rather my air suspension didn't freeze and explode in the winter.

Edit: Hey guys whoa, I'm not hating on Tesla. In fact I already put my deposit down on the Cybertruck. I'm just curious if this is something that has been thought of. No one here knows the answer unless you were at the event and specifically asked this question. Let's chill out with the instant defensive responses and downvoting. We're all interested in learning more about this car and I think we all see EVs as the future.

My question isn't related to having air suspension, it's related to having an air compressor that feeds the air suspension."
Love it... I think it will be a best seller among trucks in its price range.

This has put me off buying my model 3 sadly as I'm worried about the future of the company
"If you don't like the truck, no need to come on here and post about it.  It's pathetic and unnecessary.  

This is going to sell like crazy, mainly because it screams ""look at me"" while also being incredibly functional.  I'd buy it in a heart beat if I could afford it."
Just wondering @elonmusk as someone in New England how would the cheapest i.e RWD version fare in the snow with FSD?
"Did anyone see all these renders?

Edit: nvm, they are on tesla website, just not where I was looking."
The new car looks awesome 👍

"Stock is still in the green after hours!!

Edit : here is the /s for my friends below."
"Elon is trolling everyone. This is hilarious. Is everyone really that gullible? Fanboys are already blindly jumping to the defense of this thing. 

The specs and features that he talked about are all real, but the design isn’t done yet (it comes out in 2021!) and with it being the time that Blade Runner takes place he wanted to do something fun. 

Everyone take a deep breath and laugh. We’ll get the real design when it’s ready."
This is Tesla’s response to the Ford Mach-E Mustang which looks so much cooler. Tesla for the first time has felt challenged in their vision and are responding hastily and with poor planning.
I just sold all my stocks. Elon is 2 years away from being kicked out

"This is terrible. I had low expectations, and am still disappointed"
Something tells me that one of Elon’s kids designed this Hot Wheels truck from the 70’s.
"How much cheaper is a P3D- than a P3D+

Is the P3D- any cheaper to insure?"
">They hated the fact there was no instrument cluster. They hated the door handles. They hated the look of the front end. 

   I still hate these things, even though I love the model 3 (and every Tesla for that matter) overall. The instrument cluster missing is my biggest qualm for sure"
First we get shitty VR Half Life Alyx and now we get a super ugly ass Tesla Truck....
[deleted]
Where the fuck am I going to fit a toolbox/air compressor on that thing? Goose neck hitch? I'm never going back to bumper pull trailers
"It’s ugly and impractical for people who actually use trucks, what a shame, I’ve lost all faith in musk"
Imagine liking that ugly ass rivian😂 it looks like you attached the front of a mini cooper to a 2007 chevy
The low pre order is indicative of how long it will take to produce this truck!!!

"Tesla's Pickup report card (dual motor AWD):

0-60 faster than a 911 (3.0-4.2):  4.5 sec - FAIL (still great for a truck)

Carry an F-150 in the bed: Carries ATV - FAIL (not important IRL)

Tows 300,000 lbs: 10,000 lbs - FAIL (Comparable to an F-150)

Powers tools and has an air compressor: Yes - PASS 

Range over 400 miles: 300+ Miles - FAIL (plenty of range for most)

Price under $50,000: $49,900 - PASS (Without incentives)

Futuristic design - EPIC FAIL (It's just a box with a peaked roof in the middle)

[What it should have been](https://insideevs.com/news/383249/tesla-truck-vs-f-150-ram-silverado/). Please change the design and I'll buy it."
"Uh... can I play ‘conspiracy bill’ for a second?  

Tesla is currently being sued for the SCTY deal, and specifically the fact that they sold the deal on the premise of the ‘roof tile’ solar cell product that did not exist (and still doesn’t).

So is Elon just presenting an intentionally bullshit product to prove (to the courts) that he can legally introduce bullshit products that don’t exist - not just in the context of closing a deal - and have it be taken seriously, but not seriously, as a defense to the legal claim against the company?

The fiasco with the window is what sold it for me... surely they KNEW that would happen."
Tesla once again showing us that they have no idea about their target market. Total fail.
"The webpage they’re promoting isn’t even live. Jesus Christ guys.

It's cool and all... But it's a tad bit novelty to replace the f150 or Dodge Ram

"Doubt Tesla will be able to compete with Ford given their massive leg up in terms of manufacturing expertise, market share, and their vast distribution network."
"I believe 90% of truck owners only use their truck one or two days a year. I don’t have any facts to back this statement up but it’s merely based on observation. How do you plan on selling people who tend to think they can drink gasoline these trucks? What’s the market look like?

Edit: This caught some wind. I mean using a truck bed. Most people do not use their truck beds, and use them strictly to commute. I’m going to do a brief statistical survey on this and get back to you guys."

Battery sticker!!! 😂
"Wait, I'm not being trolled?"
How wide is the goddamn bed? Can I fit the width of a sheet of plywood. None of the other electric truck mfgs seem to provide this info.
"WHWERE ARE THE SIDE MIRRORS IS THIS EVEN LEGAL

its carrying capacity is I think f-250"
"Moon or Mars adaptation packages, such as metal mesh tires, pressurized cabin, special infrared radiators, et cetera.  -- Yours truly, /r/SpaceXLounge"
Bed measurements please! At least length but everything if it's non-standard
Does the rear window before the bed roll down or move in anyway?
"I really want to know about bed accessories, specifically a tonneau cover and roof rack that would attach to the bed. I want to be able to cover my tools and material and also put pipe on the roof (I am a plumber). Alternatively, I wonder if there will be some sort of long-material pass through... Like a channel through the middle of the truck."
How many potato wedges can I fit in the trunk?
"Exterior intel requests:

* Vice slot (rectangular slot somewhere meant for a vice)
* Winch?
* 120V ""normal wall plug"" power to replace a generator, charge tools, power tools, etc?
* Tool box frunk?
* 4x8 box capable of handling standard sheeting?
* Ratchet strap attachment rings or bars?"
Pay attention afterwards for any possible Easter Eggs since we all blew it at the Model Y Reveal!
Heated or cooled seating/steering wheel options.
Charge port if possible.
Access to bed from side? Seems hard to access the back of the bed from even standing on the tires. Fifth wheel gooseneck hitch is an important one :)
"That looks like a solar panel on the back. Is it? And if it is, how long does it take to charge? 

External armour sounds good, but it's a departure from the standard approach of crumple zones. How does it deal with that in practice?"
"Can it take a standard RPG-7 granade hit?
Thanks."
"I’d like to know the water fording depth and what the frunk looks like
Edit: and if the back row can come out and you can get straight into the bed"
Will this pass pedestrian collision regulations in the EU?
Not a fan of the aesthetic though.
Will it fit in Tesla showrooms?
Nice to meet you dude!
Can it work as a stand-alone Powerwall or additional Powerwall when plugged in at home?
"Does anyone know how WIDE the truck bed is?

Can I put a 4x8 sheet of plywood in there and drive home?"
How do they get rid of the water buildup in the on-board air compressor? Will my air suspension freeze and explode in the winter?
F150..Target Destroyed..
Can you ask about the A/c regarding filtration/positive pressure?
I don't know. The problem with using a heavy sphere is that it makes contact with basically a very small point on the surface. It's like using an extremely heavy spear.
It's a great advertising trick. People will be talking about how the windows broke
Honestly the whole thing was a bit of a disaster
well it guarantees a lot of people will be hearing about it
I think it was on purpose for publicity.  Watch it again and see how calmly that dude suggests trying it on another window.
is that like.... faux granite??
"Is that...

#MARBLE?

Also, horizontal screens are the future of Tesla. Sorry, S/X owners."
"Can't wait to slam my head into what looks like a metal dash?

Also, super uncomfortable looking."
"What the fuck is Elon doing? 

Bullshit steering wheels like that were the exact reason people weren't interested in Teslas competitors back before Tesla started making *normal fucking cars that happened to be electric*..

He's making the same mistakes all the other manufacturers were."
"Very sci-fi. I like it. 

I also like how radical the design is in general. Most people are complaining about how futuristic it looks, but it will still sell like hotcakes simply due to the price + the performance and utility.

And not only will the design gradually grow on people, but it will probably set the trend for all cars in the future."
Where's the storage?
"“Cool” is what I wish I could say. But the carpet matches the drapes, and I ain’t buyin."
They have lost their mind. sharp edges not cool.. looks interesting as a concept at best.
That steering wheel looks sexy!
[deleted]
"As a tall guy that drives a truck because I fit in it, interior looks a little small."
"I kinda like the steering ""wheel"""
Didn't it say it seats 6?
So... absolutely no rear visibility? How's that going to work exactly...?
Is it steer by wire?
There is even a rear facing 'mirror' that displays what's going on behind you with a camera.
Interior: yes
That looks like such a sad interior.
I wish the outside was as cool as the inside. Can I have that interior in a different truck please?
That looks like a rendition of what alleged UFO abductees describe as being the inside of the ship.
"Ok, what is it with Tesla and not embedding the screen into the dash?  I loved the design on the S and X, but the 3 and this have a screen that looks like an after thought ,like they forgot they needed that and put it there .

also no dash instruments in front of the driver, I do like being able to see my speedometer and other stuff in front of me while driving and not having to look at the center."
Looks fucking awesome IMO
"Does it have airbags?

Also why does the dash look like a counter top in a bathroom"
Tesla keeping true to having the worlds most boring interior.
Are there more pics?
"Damn...
That actually looks cool as fuck.

And if u want everyone to know ur a cyberpunk redneck there isn’t really a better to go about it tbh."
That looks fucking horrible. Like they teleported a caveman to give input on design and then killed him.
Ah perfect.  An unuseable rear seat for adults as well.
"If they can make an ATV they can make a dirt bike, or street bike maybe! Cmon..... I want it..."
I too am more interested in the ATV than the truck right now.
Same. I want that ATV
"It's a reskinned Yamaha. Just 3D print the panels yourself. 

https://twitter.com/QLDPyrrhonist/status/1197803946460336134"
Me too!
There was an ATV?? Jesus christ.
IQ 500
why is that?
"“If other companies use LIDAR, *driving this truck will kill you.*”"
"Oh wow, that's a really good theory. I think its more for aerodynamics."
"You mean 100% absorbing lidar, since it works by reading how things bounce back :)

Edit: nvm misread"
That wasn't supposed to happen.
Nobody bothered to tell him that the prototype didn’t have the same glass as the demo rig.
Boy the fact they did that demo early killed the whole presentation. Such a debacle. You could see it in the background for the rest of the whole thing.
The best thing was that he had to continue the presentation standing in front of those shattered windows for the next 10 minutes.... LOLOLOLOLOLOL

"https://images.app.goo.gl/kFEEkNXAuE8oHnF26

Get one of these window stickers, but paint the ball silver."
"I watched alone on my iPad from an airport bar and was cry-laughing. Jesus, that was amazing."
"I'm going to take a wild guess, but i'm thinking only the windshield is made of the stronger glass/Alon as it retains the primary risk for impacts, while the door glass is standard to permit breakage by emergency responders. Thinking the staff forgot to remind Elon and the stage crew. Just an assumption..."
"I literally muted the stream because I was so nervous it was going to happen  lmao, and then it actually happened."
Anyone got a video of the breaking and response?
I was thinking the same thing that he said.
Tri motor is late 2022 fyi
"That's what I've noticed.  And it's a large car, this makes it obvious that there's room for improvements in the 3 and S, at lower prices.  Honestly that's what the company should be doing instead."
"They haven't even released the Model Y what makes you think they'll have this truck ready in two years. All the spec numbers are just numbers at this point, they have yet to released a production version"
2 years...Elon Time....so
"I just checked Rivians website.  Their truck isn’t spec’d as well but it’s still pretty damn good, 400 miles, 11k towing, 0-60 in 3 seconds.  Plus the added benefit of not being pug fugly. I’d definitely go with the rivian over that thing even if it is a Tesla."
"late 2022, plus elon time, if that model gets here before Q2 2023 i'll be impressed"
"Imagine if this was a cool design with no broken windows with those specs.

People would be clawing to get a preorder."
">within the next two years

you say that as if it's not a long time (it is), and as if they're going to stick to the schedule"
"And if they throw out the design, they might sell a few"
"As cool as that sounds, I feel my trailer's coupler will explode if I accidentally floor it. But imagine being able to boondock in complete comfort for several days on end..."
You'll need to chew for a long time...Cuz that design pretty hard to swallow!
"Yeah that's insane, because thats with 3500lbs towing. They definitely have some new battery tech."
Ya it's dope.  I love the way it looks and that it's steel.  However I need a truck to tow a 10k lb toy hauler to get to and from the track.  Don't have the time to stop for a charge.  I doubt it does 500 miles towing.  Would be cool as hell if you could retrofit a battery pack into a toy hauler though...
"Mmmmm, tasty."
"yea I feel like the 500 miles of range upgrade should be a big talking point (after the glass thing). I remember when people were asking for 400 mile vehicles from Tesla, they skipped that and went to 500. If you're just using it to drive around like a lot of people do with other trucks, this would be a no brainer because of gas savings."
the 70k truck doesn't even go into production until 3 years from now. chew on that for a sec
"That's not design, that's what a six year old scribbles on paper and calls a twuk."
bigger battery = more miles?
It's truly weird. it feels like a joke. but it's real. They could always produce a stainless truck with more traditional styling. It might sell better but if you want Elon you have to accept some weird sometime. The board had to have signed off on this. Just amazing really that this is going to get made. It's so weird I had to order it.
"They must be so confused right now... this looks like such a kids design, but Tesla has such a track record of knocking it out of the park and disrupting entrenched market segments... I think there is gonna be a lot of Tums eaten tonight."
They all collectively sighed tonight
"Elon: ""I am fucking serious.""

Those CEO's probably shit themselves because their vehicles have exactly 0 advantages over the Cybertruck"
"They always think that, but don't say it anymore..."
He did?! Lmao I didn’t catch that
3rd time watching it. Confirmed
"I thought he broke it on purpose then would be like fuck this one here's the real truck ..but nope, that's the finished product..."
OMFG!
Instant classic.
Elon doesn’t sound like a basic bro
No the thrower said that line
"They did take a sledgehammer to the doors as well.

I'm wondering if they really did test that installed glass in exactly the same circumstances before the demo"
The guy threw the big ball probably was supposed to throw the small one oh well ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
"Especially to do it at the very beginning, so if anything goes wrong he has to stand in front of a smashed truck while trying to present it.

At least do the live demo at the very end when the presentation is done."
I think Elon was just excited.
https://youtu.be/yspf3dtA034
"Except when Lenovo drops a laptop off of a lift, that always seems to go fine for some reason"
Umm just maybe that guy was Elon?
I don’t get why that was even a thing? I don’t think anyone expects their car windows to be unbreakable.
"Man, their boss, all livid, screaming “what is this garbage? How long was I paying you to spy on them? At what point did you realize you were a fucking fool?”"
"This is a real possibility to be honest :D 

Or they thought some startup with some crappy design was testing something... ahahahahah...

But I like the design now though."
"Safe to say in this case that wasn't the worst part... 

But yes normally I agree"
"I don’t know. If it wasn’t controversial, we wouldn’t be discussing it.

I wonder what some of history’s most seen/mist unheralded reveals were like.

I’m sure on paper “Delorean with extra chromosomes” made perfect sense."
"Hardcore Elon Musk fanboys and fangirls are the worst. Most of them are social media ""influencers"" and think they are techno geeks or whatever. You should see the videos of the rides they got in the truck, bunch of woo girls and guys."
Those are his fanboys. They're an integral to the illusion.
That's why I was so sure that wasn't the real truck. I really thought they were rushing through the fake one with the broken glass and the terrible presentation. Then the entire but wait there's more... and then it just ended! wtf.
They probably cut it short because of the window thing
It looked like he had a couple welders slap this together out back the day before the presentation
"He kind of explained that it didn't make sense to have the bed of the truck be in the L shape design.

The windshield/front honestly doesn't seem that extreme to me, it's the combo with the trunk that makes the design so different."
"It felt so unorganized. Non of the slides were in order. The glossed thru a lot of stuff trying to get to the info Elon was talking about. 

Maybe like they had a few versions and they never got the updated PowerPoint. 

I wonder if either Elon went off script or he didn’t have a teleprompter and couldn’t remember which order it was supposed to be in."
"Yes an no details on certain things. 
How many kilowatts are the batteries?
How much power and air can the outlets provide?
How many horsepower is the truck?"
"Exactly! You could see the photos flashing by in the background with really cool features that he didn’t even touch on. The camping setup, the side toolbox’s, the 240v outlet you can plug your welder into. Talk about!"
Elon is the absolute worst at presentation. He needs to work on it. Or let someone else do the presentation.. like Ford did with Edris.
"Fewer bends and corners, makes the panels more ridged so they can be made stronger more easily, is my guess...."
"There's a reason for the conventional designs, the aerodynamics of the car. Did any one see anything as to how this effects those properties and like you asked why this design."
"I was very underwhelmed and baffled with this thing. This is what you get when you let somebody that has never used a truck go ahead and try to get inspiration from sharp angles and anime or something to design this abomination. The range is great, but that thing is ugly as all fuck and so many things would make it really bad to use in the real world. On the bright side, I no longer have to go to the gym because I can just get a workout with trying to lift the 300lb tailgate over and over."
"The reason why is simple: he knows it has zero chance against the big 3 truck makers in terms of sales to traditional truck owners. There are maybe 5 people who are going to switch from a Ram, F150 or Silverado for a Tesla truck, regardless of what it looks like. His thinking seems to be that he might as well go all in and make it as edgy as possible so that when it fails he can just blame the ""unconventional design""."
I actually thought that the ball was going to bounce off the glass and hit someone in the front row. The glass breaking was probably the worse outcome though. That's all everyone will be talking about tomorrow.
[deleted]
Someone on Elon's team must have told him it would be okay to throw a ball at it. That person is probably getting their ass shredded by Elon right now.
All the photos in the media tomorrow are going to be him in front of that.
So much Ambien tonight
Could have done it last as well
"Having to complete the presentation with a smashed-up truck is not a good look.

I wonder if they even tested that glass as installed."
I don't think the true glass was installed. Or was installed just as the windshield. Elon must have not gotten the memo or just assumed it was ready. The ball was not even thrown that hard.
"It’s also a weird feature to have, let alone focus on. 

Dent proof body panels? That’s neat if it’s a work truck, but this is *not* a work truck. This is a consumer vehicle for men who want a truck (just like most other trucks, tbh). They really don’t need tougher windows, and they didn’t need to insert such a risky demo in the reveal."
"Like, pretend the on-stage demonstrations actually go as planned, are they really that much better than a video? Ok you can't fake it on stage but a video will look 100x cooler and there is zero risk. Even the ball drops were kinda weird. I get demos for acceleration like with the roadster, or parking or towing or whatever, but wasn't this the ONE REASON why you shouldn't test your glass on stage?"
That was embarrassing
100% right. they were doing fine up to this point. now the talking points will be about how bad the glass shattering moment was.
Have you ever seen that trick where a drinking cup made of glass can break a ceramic tile?  It was like that but in reverse.
And they didn't twice. Why did they try it again? They should have quit while they were behind.
We heard your concerns about iffy paint jobs so we just removed the paint
"lol, I could imagine someone trying to key it so bad that their key actually bends or breaks fucking up their ability to use their car."
This one is unkeyable
Next trend. Angle grinder on Tesla.
"elon should have used his ""not a flamethrower"" on the thing during the presentation. people working on industrial construction sites and firefighters would be all over this."
Seriously people are obnoxious
"So many self absorbed youtubers who want a few seconds of notoriety. He shouldn't acknowledge them, it makes it worse."
These are the same people that woo in movie theaters at marvel movies. The worst kind of people.
"“We love you Elon”

“Take my money”"
"They know that Elon will react to them, and it gets worse with every presentation. Homeboy needs some more media training."
I think they put mics facing the crowd on purpose. It’s kinda part of their whole schtick. His lav mic would not pick up those people that clearly.
The comments were almost as cringe worthy as the window tests.
"Elon really needs someone else to host these things. Him out there being Elon along with the crowd and his inability to interact with them well is just a wet blanket on the whole ""exciting"" reveal."
ONE MORE THING! LOL! SHOOT IT! DO IT! LOL ELLOOOONNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"WE LOVE YOU ELON
.
.
.
WE LOVE YOU ELON!!"
"I think people get too caught up in the moment, their passion and enthusiasm boils over."
I like it . . . Party!!!
*waves cane* stop having so much fun!!
Neckbeard Fanboys
That’s what she said.
Stock buying opportunity tomorrow.
"The real serious fuck-up was starting the presentation flatout attacking every truck on the market. It's like they don't understand who their target audience is with this thing. You know who buys a lot of trucks. Conservatives. People that are stuck in their ways. If it aint broke, don't fix it kind of people. A lot of truck people hate the idea of electric vehicles to begin with. Now they have even more reason, and starting your marketing pitch with an attack on current truck owners. Who the fuck thought any of this presentation was a good idea. 

On the plus side. 70k for a 500-mile range electric vehicle."
"Have a spare truck! The iPhone reveal demo glossed over the fact that the phone crashed 10 times, but Jobs had a whole rack of spares and just kept working through them."
"I don't get it. Why did they even make a point about the windows? Who cares? Talk about the truck parts of the truck. And if you _have_ to start throwing stuff at it, at least do it toward the end of the presentation."
The windows breaking is the least of Tesla's worries. That thing is hideous.
And so avoidable. Why are they spending time and money on unbreakable glass? It's just gimmicks that only jack up the price.
Or maybe it was a viral marketing tactic. The picture of this car will be everywhere now.
"I get they’re excited, but come on. Stop yelling at Elon"
The crowd is talking more than Elon is lol
The most accurate description of this event.
Wow. Only a clay model 6 weeks ago and a prototype 2 weeks ago? Am I reading that right?
"Upvoted.

I was taken aback by its look from the side, but seeing more and reading about it in this article it grows on me.

I think it looks much better in broad daylight."
Those in-person photos look so much better than the view of the truck at the presentation and the website renders. Looks awesome. I wouldn’t call it a truck though. More like a futuristic suv with an extended truck lol
"The whole sledgehammer and bullet proof thing was useless cringe. They spent most of their time talking about shit nobody needs and very little touting the truck's meaningful capabilities, and they didn't even try to relate the supposed strength in real world terms.

No talk about the job site, loose gravel, incidents with tools, etc.

This is a truck for the ruined, crime riddled inner city streets of a science fiction world that doesn't exist."
I missed it! Is there video of it somewhere?!
"Not if they're too busy shitting on the design.

Nah but forreal that glass test was good to me. Do that to a normal car and you have no window."
Viral marketing at its best
All publicity is good publicity. This gets people talkin'.
They just need to come up with an angle for how it’s offensive
"Yeah, that was awkward, and he didn’t recover."
Why wouldn't they test that off stage beforehand...
Is this why the stream went dead?
"He was sweating buckets too. I felt really bad for him, he's a showman. He just became really flustered after that happened."
Unpopular opinion: Elon is not a good public speaker.
He has a base level of awkwardness when presenting but that didn’t help. You could see him thinking how bad this was going to look.
Equal to: https://youtu.be/IW7Rqwwth84
Oh he was awkward waaaaay before the windows  broke
They need to rehearse once or twice. There are so many people watching this. It’s not fun to see someone of high profile come to stage and stammer. No sync with slides and what he says. Sometimes slides already shows before he announces and sometimes it’s the opposite. And the glass break was cringe to say the least.
"for what its worth, in my opinion he seemed to take it fairly well other than the immediate 'oh fuck' that he said or whatever 

could have gone a lot worse than that, and he was able to keep the show going anyway even though they were kinda slow on the prompts some times when he said he was ready for a slide or for a video to play"
Elon is definitely the guy that beats himself up over every single tiny mistake.. this kills the Elon.
Remember that time Homer made that car?
Yes
Throw a metal ball at it.
Each truck will come with an emergency steel ball
Just throw a metal ball at it.
With a large metal ball.
Those hammers for breaking glass are surprisingly strong. They can break through armored glass.
"The truck is a boat, remember?"
THIS SHOULD BE TOP POST LOL
"""I forgot - it transforms into a boat!"" - Elon, probably."
Clearly it isn't that stronk ha
"Someone made a comment that the reason the windows broke is that, that glass is normal.  Maybe Elon forgot, or for demo purposes it was supposed to be the tough glass and something got messed up.  But yea. You need the door glass to be breakable"
"Windows in cars are designed to break more easily from the inside. See: [guy trying to scare a cat](https://www.reddit.com/r/instant_regret/comments/ab1uvw/breaking_your_windshield_in_order_to_scare_a_cat/).

Emergency personnel probably carry that pointy tool you smack on the corner that shatters the whole thing."
It becomes a boat
"Exactly, I’m not buying that fucking coffin"
Wow didn’t think of that🤔🤔🤔🤔
"Maybe I'm just weird but shouldn't they have more demo trucks on hand just in case? But, hopefully this means that the sideglass is easy to replace in the production model."
Fixing it in post..
Damn it you made me laugh. lol
LOWER THE POLY COUNT MOOOORE
Goddam that’s good....:-)
It is a scalene triangle.
Yup. I’m looking at it and liking it now
I'm getting MAJOR deja vu from this comment. I feel like someone said exactly the same thing about the Y. Maybe I'm crazy.
"I think all the talk about how popular pickup sales are in America. How Tesla is coming. How Tesla wants a piece of the pickup market. How this will be HUGE for Tesla. All that aside, this is kind of disappointing. Elon warned us and said, ""this truck isn't for everybody"". He was right. People in their heads were drawing up something like this when they thought ""cyberpunk"" but secretly they were hoping for another Rivian. 

I think the market will speak. If there is a demand... cool. I do hope Elon shelves this as a fun little novelty and limited edition run but I don't think that is his intentions. 

The cost makes me think he hopes to MASS produce this to scale it like the 3. BUT I just don't can't see these on every corner. Again, I could very well be wrong but only time will tell."
They really are
Well so are the comments here lol
Everything is cringey to you nerds.
I was thinking the same thing. Im thinking they rushed through it and cut it short. All those lasers and production for 20 mins of ummms and ahhhhs and cringe worthy content
"Absolutely. Truly horrible imagery. Although, the truck itself is so distractingly hideous it might not matter!!"

"That yoke steering wheel is terrible. Unless it's just the guy steering weirdly.

https://i.imgur.com/hb3FQEB.jpg"
The screen interface looks completely different. Is that the next version after v10?
The UI looks great.
What about the side mirrors/side cameras?
That steering wheel sure is something.
"Man this guy was a dumbass. ""How many miles have you put on this""  it's a prototype. Theres a reason no one has seen this thing yet."
yoke steering wheel
Absolutely hate that steering wheel. Why would anyone think that’s a good idea to have?
LOL And I was afraid it would bounce off and hit him in the head...
Did they not test this before the show?
"Keep in mind, that would’ve flown through a F150 window.   The metal glass absorbed the impact instead of giving way.   Difference between glass embedding in your face/eyes and you driving away."
Ouch lol.
Embarrassing for sure. Got years to work it out.
"Didn’t they test it first? How, I don’t understand!"
BUILT TOUGH.
"Lol they really broke one window and then said ""you know what? Let's break the other one!"""
The built-in ramp was cool though
How has nobody mentioned the fricken topper that magically slid away? That was amazing
"Dude looked nervous as could be. ""Oh God don't fuck this up any worse than it already is.."""
"Pre-production.  It will have a torsion bar for easy lifting by release, at minimum."
I was thinking the same thing. You'd expect hydraulic assist
Let’s be honest the whole thing looked jacked together
Is there a demo of this? The livestream cut off :(
Alpha Male tailgate
That thing is just a prop at this point.
"It looked lower than the average full size truck today though. bed heights are like 36"" these days, its at the point where its kind of inconveniently high."
I thought it would close automatically using electric power with the press of a button.
yep
"Yeah, not really. He said it would be different, but it's possible to look different & crazy in a good way, not a bad way. This is just aesthetically displeasing.

It looks nothing like a blade runner truck, either. The shape is sort of right for blade runner, but it's far too plain."
I agree he almost did not show the bed.... the most important part of a truck!  He is hard on himself so I am sure he is having a bit of a meltdown right now.
"I noticed the clamping.  To me looked like they were loosening it so that the glass could ""shake"".  You saw it shake on that last hit.  I'm a huge Tesla fan and I drive a Model 3.  I think the truck will grow on people as it's about practicality.  You won't get the fully loaded people looking for this truck, doubt they'd actually be doing anything with their trucks."

Someone in chat was saying the guy was supposed to throw the smaller sphere instead of the larger one at the windows. If so, oops."
Can’t show the interior after that with shattered glass inside!
"My thoughts exactly. They never did that ball test on the glass as installed.

I hope they learned a lesson about testing before holding live presentations."
"Ahh very true, also very sad. He said they threw things at the actual truck i thought though"
I think we've all been there before. Being extremely excited about something then losing all enthusiasm in a matter of seconds.
"That's his fault. He did not test things before the presentation and made an ass out of himself because of it. 

It would have been so much better had he let a team present it in character."
I would shit my pants
"Totally with you about the Rivian, however it IS like twice the cost. I mean, the base Cybertruck is the same cost as a Model 3, and the whole lines pricing is similar as well. The specs can't be ignored.... just like it's love it/hate it looks."
Completely agree here. They've got massive chops for this design aesthetic. It looks right out of the original Total Recall or Blade Runner. I will be curious to see if this is the final design.
"Rivian looks like some type of Range Rover with a truck bed and goofy headlights.

I'm in with Tesla because it's different, when the reveal happened I said WHAT THE FUCK..but in a good way."
"As Jerry Seinfeld said...cars these days are so beige, they all look the same and nothing stands out like cars did from 50-80's. This will stand out and I love it."
I despise the Rivian. Literally just looks like a Nissan truck.
"Up until now it always seemed like other companies wanted their hybrids/electrics to look weird, while Tesla wanted their cars to simply look beautiful.

Now it feels like Tesla is hopping on the electric=weird bandwagon.  It's risky, but I don't think it's the good kind of risk.

https://i.imgur.com/qsHJVja.jpg"
"There's plenty of car companies of the past that have gone bankrupt and disappeared due to 1 single bad release. That's why they don't take these kinds of risks, and this risk might actually destroy Tesla. Time will tell, I'm getting my popcorn for this one."
"They swung for the fences.  The look...is ugly as hell.  But the wow factor is huge.  They didn't make a pick up truck.  They made an electric armored off load truck from the 80's comic book.

I don't usually consider buying a pick up truck as I am very much white color Urban yuppy...  But man I am seriously considering putting money down on this.  Something about this makes the little kid in me go ""I want that!"" In a way that nothing else has done in a long while.  Before this I was leaning towards Model Y which would be the obvious choice for my demo (I got kids)."
Plenty of carmakers have adopted designs that have failed and are ridiculed to this day .
I feel like that's an insult to the Aztek
Oo god. Cant unsee
It's going to fail.
Walter White would buy this
HAHAHA
I noticed that too. Poor guy. I would’ve had a heart attack and drilled dead on stage. Boom.
At least it didn’t go through.
"to be fair, it's going to be the same results with other trucks. or even probably worse."
"I missed that part, what happened?"
I'm wondering if it's not just creating a media hype train.
Yeah I thought it was a bit at first and they were going to reveal the real truck afterwards. Oh well...
Can we go back to the concepts pls
"Oh thank cawd. My eyes cannot bear another concept.

Edit: oh please cawd bring back the concept vehicles."
Quick! Make a few more before it's too late!
My body is ready.
"Amen, bro."
Well... it's different for sure
I think I’m ready to start looking at the concepts again...
Oof
Concepts were so much better than the truth...
Can’t unsee the real thing. *cringe*
This comment did not age well
[It's happening!](https://i.imgur.com/vwMin.gif)
This comment did NOT age well.
I'd take those ugly concepts over this thing every day of the week
"Deep down, I still hope he’s trolling....."
"I prefer the concepts to this, lol."
Damn Tesla's social media game is on point.
LMAO
"Nice find, You should post this as a thread, it's gonna get lost."
"Pan 45 left, pull out"

That’s what’s awkward?

"... if it's always natural metal.  If it's ever painted, that'll still get damaged.  Perhaps it'd be a paint-only repair... but a key cutting is substantially different than impact resistance so who knows."

Now he has to talk in front of a broken truck for the rest of the event... Crazy town
*Harrison Tesla
"Gonna need a source, and it does not necessarily mean he will be speaking, so keep your expectations in check people."

No way
WHATTTTTTT
Is that supposed to be a pun?
Was he cringing like the rest of us?
HE SAY YOU BRADE RUNNAH!
Pre recorded videos alone would have solved soooo many issues with this presentation hahahaha
"> Silence the crowd.

Can't describe how annoying the random yelling is."
The crowd is the worst thing about Elon presentations. It’s like being at Comicon with nerds wanting to get attention in front of a crowd
Tesla and Elon almost always wing it during reveals. I don’t know why they can’t hire someone from Apple marketing to teach them how to present something to millions of people.
Who gives a shit. Perfectly rehearsed and scripted presentations are phoney. This feels a lot more human and genuine.
Also Elon is about as awkward as people get at public speaking. Tesla need a smooth spokesperson and just have Elon stand there as back up
"thats a very boomer mentality. you think they didn't think about this long and hard? This is intentional. its the opposite of normal, its the whole theme of the car. They're marketing it to people that want a cyberpunk WTF truck. if you want regular get a model Y."
"Meme the streets oh my god

Thank you. That's exactly the kind term I was trying to conjure up when my friends asked me why I put a deposit on one."

lmao
Exactly. Is it good looking? Uh...depends? Is it fucking rad? Absolutely. Would be hilarious to cruise this around.
That price is gonna give other truck companies nightmares! If tesla brings out some funky custom skins or something they'll sell like addy during finals week!
You are the type of person I don't want to hang out with.
"We all did, buddy..."
We all did.... I was like yo they broke the glass twice so it mustn’t be it. Roll out the real truck
You and me and literally everyone else were hoping that. Dear God.

Well at least there's an ATV LOL. What a shitshow...
same
"""Transparent metal."""
BUILT TOUGH.
They can hire presenters.  Wtf
He should have a part of the presentation but have someone at Tesla who I great at public speaking lead the event.
"Go and watch Apple presentations, then.

I LOVE watching Elon precisely because he is so ad hoc and awkward."
Please...
"The ironic thing is that standard trucks are all ugly and have *always* been ugly. But since they've been part of (particularly North American) society for so many decades, people have just grown up with them and accepted their (ugly,) shape as normal.  

This truly is different and future-facing. Hence the strong reactions. Not because it's ""ugly"" but because it breaks the mould if what truck users expect a thing called a ""truck"" to look like.  

Give it time and people will get accustomed to it as being a truck.  

Having said that, I think between now and release it will get refined ( happened with the S and the X too).   

The presentation would have been better if Elon had actually talked up the *practical* qualities that a potential buyer wants to know about - i.e, what it can do for the owner. Not  telling the potential owner how great Tesla is to make this thing."
It looks actually like one of those futuristic concept cars that you know never make it to production. And this one will! The wheel wells actually look ridiculous. As if they lowered the poly count too much
"I've been openly critical of Tesla designs in the past - I think they were way too conservative for what an electric vehicle allows them to do, and I didn't actually find them attractive either.

This is the first Tesla design that I really like.  But I also think that this was a poor choice of first vehicle to introduce this design language (or at least to such an extreme extent) - trucks are a vehicle that need to be practical first and foremost.  The total lack of horizontal surfaces for racks, no side access to the bed, questionable repairability of such large flat panels (even high strength steel will get damaged), and other form over function choices* will limit it as a working vehicle for a lot of people.

I'd love to see this design language applied to a car.  That, and a few actual hardware buttons inside, and I could definitely see myself ordering a Tesla.

The other option of course is that this design is refined over the years between now and launch to address those shortcomings, while retaining the core design language.

_____

*For example, an immediate area of concern for me is the rear corners, which are commonly damaged on trucks when loading, etc.  With a big heavy truck moving around, and other big heavy things moving around it, even high strength steel panels will be bent.  On a normal truck they put the lights there, and wrap the sides underneath.  So if the corner gets hit, you either have a dent under the lights, or a cheapish light unit to replace, but the key thing is that the damage is kept away from the tailgate edge.  On the Cybertruck it's where the massive side panel meets the massive tailgate panel, so not only is it now 2 large panels that can be damaged, but the damage could easily interfere with the tailgate opening and closing.

The bed is one of the bits of a truck which isn't fundamentally altered by moving to electric, so it doesn't need to be reinvented in the same way as other areas.  Today's designs have been refined by decades of use, so it makes sense to take those lessons learned and use them where appropriate.  Fix what needs fixing, and take advantage of the new opportunities that electric opens up, but not just change for change's sake."
Same here!!
2020 memes in the making
"100% chance it's a love or hate it thing. No one is going to look at it have not have an opinion, lol."
"Love the features.

DETEST the design."
I hate it. I must have it.
Let me know if you figure out where to buy this thing
"This is nice, why didn't they show this in the presentation??"
Is that a metal dash or just faux?
I fucking hate the steering wheel.
It’s kinda dull. Very spartan. More screens for passengers? Something?
Is that a marble dash?
"Damn, those windows are shattered too."
Do you have the one of the truck pulling the f-150
That is not a bad video.  Design is growing on me... slowly.
"Oh my God it's even more hideous in motion.

And it's bulletproof, so you can't even shoot it to put it out of its misery..."
It looks a bit nicer out in the daylight. Maybe I'm just desperately trying to see the upside though.
Looks a tad better while driving. But still
I kinda like that it looks simulated in all the media haha
"Interior pics on the website

Can't wait for stainless steel shell trucks to park next to me and dent my shit in the parking lot

Good catch about the side mirrors.  Not even cameras for it either, including ones for AP it's supposed to be compatible with.  No radar dots either"
Needs a spark tire and windshield wipers too
Lamborghini already made a Humvee hybrid with the same engine as the Countach. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_LM002
Other cars will be the crumple zone
"> 7- Armored exterior is cool, but does it allow for crumple zones? That is an important safety feature

of course. there's no engine in the front so it's all crumple zone. the skin is still mostly weak, and only slightly adds to the structural rigidity."
Right!? That looked like a sweet 4-wheeler.
Same. Even my friend at Tesla didn't know they were doing that and doesn't have any info on it.
i have the feeling they will learn the towing ability getting dragged for the failed window demo.
We all hope you are dreaming.  We hope we are dreaming.
matrix-dressed ~~villains~~ engineering interns with bad posture
You bring up what I was thinking when he was going on about the body. Things crumple to absorb energy. If the body is tough wouldn’t that fuck up crash testing/be more dangerous for pax?
"Polygon collision, huh?"
He will walk out (or step out of the truck) at precisely 00:00:00 and we'll reset as many times as we have to!
We've been bamboozled.
"Oh yeah, never thought about that."
"Stainless steel also has terrible impact properties...it would fail basically every crash test. You think car manufacturers have never thought of using it?

I'm convinced this is a joke."
"That was my second thought; first was “fuck that thing can take anything” then second was “fuck, if I’m in a crash it makes a great unbreakable coffin”"
"Someone said it’s a death trap and honestly... I see what they mean. It’s not like replacing windows is even that expensive, it happens all the time."
"Sovereign citizens.

Check. Mate."
I was going to say that maybe they made it unbreakable on the outside and breakable on the inside. But then I remembered that someone might be unconscious  in a car wreck and they wouldn’t be able to break the glass from the inside.
You're not in a warzone?
"It's still going to be breakable with glass breaking devices.

Is it even possible to break glass of a side window while on the inside without tools?"
The side view is it’s worst view. Look at the video on the Tesla site and its much better. Then go look at the Revian and how plain it makes that truck look.
"The two broken windows didn't help things much, either."
"Right? It's great that the die hard Tesla fan's are loving it, awesome. This is not going to budge Joe the construction worker from parting with his F-150 though. He would be laughed off the site."
It makes a rivian truck look reserved.
"I know right? Make a truck that looks like every other fucking truck with *those* stats for *that* price? Ford can kiss their asses goodbye. But this?

I want to like it, but *good god* is that ugly."
Who knew they could make something uglier than the Aztec
It has some super awesome features but the second it came out we all went eeeewwwww
Luckily they can change the design as they did with the model 3. However the fact that it's a unibody makes this harder. Unibody was a bad choice in my opinion.
How do you like it after looking at it in motion and from other angles?  It's really grown on me.
What does coil mean?
"So maybe if they make a van, it can be called the Tesla Coil...."
Damn you bory truno!
this is my outlook as well. i like how its unique and futuristic
"Don't know about plasma, but you've got a good shot a getting a flame thrower."
"I think it's possible the guy was supposed to use the first, smaller ball and used the larger one instead."
That dude cannot present. It seems like he struggles in every single presentation.
Of course they did :P
It’s what the Pontiac Aztec didn’t have gumption to become.
">Looks like a Delorian Banged a ~~Tacoma~~ Aztek

It's like a Delorean on Goldeneye 64 with DK mode turned on.
yes
Someone forgot to put the armored glass in the prototype or it was installed on the passenger side
"Motortrend says manufacturing cost is indeed an [advantage](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-engineering-manufacturing):

> The plusses for a folded stainless steel, origami truck are compelling: no paint shop and no expensive tooling. No Godzilla-scale stamping machines stomping it with multiple strikes. Without all that, the capital and environmental costs of using stainless steel body panels are small. And big attractions for a company that's sensitive to both types of green—cash and environmentalism. Just groove the steel where it's supposed to fold (avoiding cracks) and bend it on simple, cheap machines (like I was actually doing last week with my garage vise!)

That drives the rest of the design:

> Unlike the strength-to-weight efficiency of compound curves (feathery eggshells are the epitome), the flat-ish planes between the Cybertruck's simple bends require greater thickness to resist buckling compression loads or wrinkling oil-canning. Adding weight.

> To counter this? Ditch the heavy, traditional, body-on-frame, and rethink the structure as weight-efficient trussed bridge in its simplest load-spreading configuration: a triangle set on its hypotenuse. One side is the Cybertruck's wedgy cab, the other, its tapered, sail-sided bed, their meeting point at the truck's tall peak resulting in a huge cross-sectional area for maximum stiffness."
"So do I, but not like this..."
My thoughts exactly
"No kidding. I just tried searching everything I could think of [www.tesla.com/atv](https://www.tesla.com/atv). Looking in the shop (like when the surfboard showed up), and searching the tesla site via for the word ""ATV"" and nothing yet. I want one. I'm guessing it might be a later release date."
These fuckers are fast.
"I personally don't mind this look if they keep the back, but make the top collapsible. In fact I might consider getting one as a camper. 

The field of vision on the front looks horrible, though. Even if I don't really mind the look I'm not sure it is entirely safe. Especially with all the sharp corner. What if someone get hit?"
You already made this??
I’m okay with this
actually looks dope
And now you've made me want to get it and get it painted green... Why do you do this
Okay you changed my mind now
Twice....
"> I mean this pitch was cringey and odd from the get-go

That's how I felt, his heart just wasn't in it... even before the windows. The dude is trying to sell the ugliest cow in the barn."
Yup..
Yup. That could not have gone worse
The glass breaking was such a disaster. And then he had to do the rest of the talk in front of the broken windows... mortifying
Well it didn't break. Do it on another pickup.
To be fair if they planned on doing that on stage they should have tested that aspect better.
"Then ""sure"" when he asked if they should do it again on the back window. Oops."
OH MY FAHIGA
What is this referencing?
You’re fucked in a steel ball storm though.
7500lb on the $40k model.
This.
Yeah but it’s pretty obvious ol Franz there has never swung a sledgehammer in his entire life.    Dude hit that ford door three times and rolled his fucking wrists over every time.
I thought he was trolling for a solid minute but you make some good points.
Fully optioned it tows as much as an F250 or 2500 which I'm assuming you're comparing it to which is 70k.
"Ya, towing range is my main concern.  I don't have time to stop for more than 15 minutes at pit stops.  Current superchargers aren't built in a way that would allow you to charge without unhooking first.  Would be cool if you could retrofit a battery pack into a toy hauler though.  Im a huge fan of the looks though."
He's probably pissed. Someone fucked up.
I feel like he was already losing focus with all the hecklers right when he got on the stage
DeLorean combined with the Top Gear homemade electric car.
Probably the most accurate description.
Except the windows 😂
Unless they bump the windows.
Right? Key this!
Curious about this too
"Also, if the glass isn’t supposed to break and the outer body isn’t supposed to dent, how do you get someone out that may be stuck or needs to be cut out with the jaws of life after an accident?"
"Probably by letting the whole cab slide along the drivetrain; same way school buses do. 

Probably put some level of crumple zone on the front, sides and rear made out of things more malleable than Cold rolled Stainless steel.

It will probably only be a little better than other trucks out there at the crash test but not by too much.

It should have great roof crush protection, though."
"It's not him being awkward. It was the glass breaking. That was so bad. I don't like the look, but hey credit for being different. But when the glass broke. That's it. That's all people will talk about. Every picture of the truck will be of it with broken glass.  It was bad"
"It wasn't Elon that made the presentation bad. It was the way the entire thing went. No interferior presentation, totally glossed over the ""powering things from the bed"" feature and the awesome bed opening, the glass breaking should definitely never have happened. And do people even care that much about the toughness of the materials?"
But the others had a good looking vehicle
"this one was terrible though. Even worse than the Y. The 3 presentation was quite nice. at least there was enough information. but this one, it almost felt like not enough was talked about. 

Now we have to scramble bits of information from his twitter in the coming days to put together a decent spec sheet for people whoa are actually interested in the truck."
Very true.
"Nah, others he's talked more and his passion showed. This was a ""show this stat"" ""ok now show this stat"" event."
Elon isn't the greatest speaker but I really felt him sweating bullets and panicking after the windows shattered.
myeah
He did pretty good at the Starship presentation recently. I was optimistic that he was improving. This was a train wreck.
It’s the design of the truck that is terrible
Elon is trash at presentations. How can someone who spends so much time in media be so bad at it? even I could've done a better presentation. the bar is so low.
"This was way worse. They went way too far out with the lasers, cgi entry, CRAZY looking car, and the demoing the glass successfully off car, and then failed twice on car. Didn’t need to demo on car. They didn’t even show the interior or touch on a single design element of what it looks the way it does"
Plottwist: This prototype still uses normal glass.
Yeah car windows are easily breakable for a reason though.  It’s so you don’t get trapped in your car in an accident especially an accident involving water.
"That steering wheel tells me that the interior is not done at all and this thing is pretty far off still (further than the late 2021 that the website claims, imo)"
...why does it look like a marble dashboard
Holy shit that steering “wheel”. No way that makes it into the final release...right?
Is that fucking marble? This is so completely out of touch
"A terrible steering wheel and a marble dash, nice."
 No round steering wheel?!!!
Now you wait till 2021.
Same
"Same.  I’ve got a long wait until late 2022, anyway.  I’m sure they’ll get my charge sorted in the next 3 years."
"Me too, then I did it again and again, each time said timed out. Just saw I've been charged 3 times."
You think god that providence saw to save your money?
same
I definitely can't wait to get my groceries in the Mako from Mass Effect
Omg this. This gave me a good laugh too
Except the warthog actually looks cool. This thing is like a doorstop with wheels. Way too many sharp edges for me personally.
"Elon Musk tweeted that it was inspired by the car from The Spy Who Loved Me, which could turn into a submarine.

That is likely where the boat rumors came from."
Add in a built-in flamethrower and I'm sold!
"Jeremy Clarkson and the OG Top Gear team approve  of boat mode, makes crossing the channel easier."
"Considering [Elon's tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1197638937109336066?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) I would be surprised if it doesn't happen as it would make the tweet rather misleading, and given history.. Plus the pressurized Mars version. Edit:Nope"

"go to the tesla dot com slash cybertruck, there is a pic of the interior there"
It has chunks of glass everywhere
It's up on the website.
"Holy hell, is that a *granite* dash? I loved the wooden dash of the Model 3, but that’s abaolutely balls-to-the-wall crazy... and I unironically love it.

Also, steering wheels? Who needs those?"
Someone photoshop the broken glass lmao
Is that a fucking marble countertop?
they forgot to add the broken glass
Is the dashboard marble?
"I'm sorry, but no one is going to buy that with an interior like that. Have y'all seen what a contractor's/construction worker's car looks like? It's dirty, full of gear, paper, etc... 

I'm sad to say this, but I think Tesla completely missed the mark on this one. Rivian looks much more suited for what a truck driver wants. 

What the fuck."
I was so focused on the broken glass that I didn't even notice the mirrors!
I feel like they badly design with side mirrors. They’ll add them later as needed.
"I hope it’s a free gift for the first 1000.  

They missed an opportunity for the ATV to load itself into the truck."
"The second row has underseat storage. https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck has a lot more info. 

It's a stainless steel body, so just weld your kayak/ladder/lumber mounting points to the body."
Kinda looks to me like the center seat could fold down and has a console on the back? Otherwise I don’t really know what you would do with a phone or drinks
">Seating for six is nice, but a center console with storage and cup holders is kinda' a necessity.

He looked doubly shattered
Legit
That’s funny
Don't do this to me in No Nut November.
"We’re not surprised, we’re just aware of the market this is going to enter and how the truck looks matters. People will be swayed by its specs and then turned away by its looks."
"We expected a cool looking version of that, not a wedge with wheels."
"THANK YOU! Like it or hate it, how can you be surprised?"
"I was expecting it to be different but not this different. I'm so disappointed, I really wanted this to be my next pickup."
"
>How is anyone surprised by this?

Um because we expected future vibe and not 80s vision of future vibe."
We figured that Elon had a plan?
"I actually dig it because it's so absurdly over the top. It's obviously too polarizing to sell to your old school traditional truck buyer, but I think it'll actually have a pretty reasonable audience for it.

Also seriously, at $40K this is an insane value. Even if the windows aren't shatterproof, lol."
They will bring out a normal pick up as well. Pretty much the same specs but normal design.
Not with those specs. Aesthetics are questionable but it's a monster.
"There's a reason why trucks look the same: because that design works. All other Tesla cars look more or less like normal cars, and that's part of the reason people like them. They're not outlandish.

The Cybertruck is different for the sake of being different."
The problem is it's what people in the 80's thought the future would look like.
Agreed. It’s unconventional but cool.
"But this needs to be marketable to pickup drivers, and imo it's not. This isn't how you convert a mass market to electric. If you want to make a car like this go ahead, but don't expect the market to buy it."
"I like the profile of it, I just think the sharp lines and unpainted body is to aggressive. It screams 80s and looks like a DeLorean truck.

If he took the profile but rounded the edges like the existing Tesla DNA I think it would have been totally different but still good to look at. I think this was to aggressive, but I’m sure the constraints of making the frame the body means you can’t get beautiful lines. 

Rounded, painted but same profile would have done it for me. Rivian looks more like a tesla truck than this (minus the front of it)"
"Ya I don’t get it. 


If it’s supposed to be a paradigm shift in automobiles, why shouldn’t it look like it?"
I preordered.  I fucking love it.
"I'll admit it's growing on me the more I look at it. But I'm also way more open minded than a typical pickup truck buyer. They will all laugh at their buddy who buys this thing.  


However the function might be so good that they'll stop laughing when said buddy is using plug in electric tools and a built in air compressor on the go and smoking them off the line."
I bet Pontiac said the same thing about the Aztec.
"I agree.

When it first rolled out, I laughed at the ridiculousness of the design.

10 minutes later I was convinced this would be my next vehicle.

The design is out there, but it grew on me and the functionality of that machine is phenomenal."
"Honestly, trying to put $100 reservation down, but the server can’t handle it."
exactly
But why do cars keep losing curves? I miss 50s and 60s curves.
The problem is that the f-150 audience wouldn't touch this with a ten foot pole.
"It grew on me in like 5 seconds, I love it.. The retracting lid is freaking sick and they never even mentioned it"
"Reminds me of the Airpods situation, when they first came out everyone hated them but now about 35million+ people have it. Don't trust people's kneejerk reactions. Obviously this isn't exactly the same scenario, and there are many different variables as well, but my point still remains."
"New designs take a bit of time for people to like them, doug mentioned that recently [https://youtu.be/Ft7q36XsTbw?t=494](https://youtu.be/Ft7q36XsTbw?t=494)"
Drastic redesigns for the sake of looks makes little sense. If they have actual functional reason for such an abomination then maybe it makes sense to replace a proven design.
[deleted]
"As others have said, utility and price. That $40k is a nice sweet spot. I'd drive this."
The ramp coming out with the active suspension kneeling down was the moment that got me.
"You are absolutely correct, it is and it will."
+1
This reminds me of when the TVR Tuscan was revealed.
Agreed! Looks straight out of Batman Begins or something... love it. Preordered right away.
I’m honestly in love.
It’s already growing on me lol
"Yes, but there are so many ways they could have pushed the boundaries and still make it look *good*. Most of the crazy fan renders looked a lot better than the actual thing."
I love it but then again it’s my cup of tea. Hate these round sedans with no identity.
"By ""design"" you mean not as functional as an actual pickup truck? Lol that bed is hilarious"
"I agree. While I think the truck is butt ugly, I know it'll grow on people. I do love different, no matter the extremity."
I like it. I'm not getting all the hate on here at all.
Not sure if this will be able to be sold in US. But in Europe it wont be able to sell. Pretty much violates every car design and engineering regulation put by EU.
This.
"> Like he said, 100 years of the same, this looks like something straight out of sci-fi, and it works.

No one says it's not unique. Just...ugly a bit. I don't know what it is exactly, it looks kinda cool in 3D models but on the stream it kinda look made out of paper."
"An interesting take but I would play devil's advocate to suggest that the wow factor of unboxing such an unconventional design will fade very quickly. Especially in the auto world, things go out of style and manufacturers all exist because aesthetics are constantly being updated and people want the newest model.

> this looks like something straight out of sci-fi   
>  
> looked like a spaceship   
>  
> every SUV looks the same 

There are major issues with equating style with design and judging something as utilitarian as car/truck based on a novel aesthetic alone. I haven't watched the reveal or seen many pictures but this approach to consumer goods is imo ruining and over-saturating the market with useless stuff, simply because it is novel. 

That being said, the cybertruck may in fact prove to be very innovative in its utility but if it's just meh, the novelty of the aesthetic will not carry this vehicle to commercial success. Looking back on the S, I believe it has been very successful because it did follow many conventions in automotive aesthetics but improved little things that were novel in their utility. It seems as though the design team or Elon wanted to go big or go home which is very risky. Time will tell."
"I like futuristic designs as much as the next guy, but I don't think I'd ever buy a vehicle that just looks half finished.

99% of the truck market won't either.

This will be bought by a very specific market segment (motorcycle dudes) and that's it.

I hope Elon isn't betting on selling a lot of these because Tesla can't sustain the extra pressure from a failed project."
"This is the first truly innovative 'daring' thing I've seen a car company do in my 28 years of life to date. Even including previous EVs.


This shit is wild as hell and I'm tempted to change my car fund from a Model 3 to this thing just because it's so fuckin' cool."
I don't disagree with what you said but that shit is hella ugly LOL. I'm sure they'll refine it further though.
"This is the same as other EVs that were made before Tesla... They were ugly as hell because they thought the EVs needed to be a different car for the future, Tesla noticed that and said no, let's make a stylish car that looks stylish yet common and people are going to buy it. Then they do the same shit the others did in a pick up truck, wtf Tesla."
"Exactly! Elon could've said he's gonna fix the window thing and could've continued on with the presentation. The reason it broke I guess was because the window was clamped tight by the frame whereas the normal glass panes' clamps were loosened before dropping the sphere. Nonetheless it's a super cool looking truck and a little skeptism as first is but normal, all new, groundbreaking and revolutionary things go through that at first."
"If someone photoshopped this on the moon with a bunch of NASA stickers on it, no one would flinch."
I'm with you. It's the awesome thing from sci-fi movies that car companies would never ship! I fucking want it!
You mean you decided it's cool since it's a Tesla?

"Honest question, why do you own a truck if you're driving 70 miles to work?"
"Not to defend then to much but throwing is super inconsistent. They probably did try it a bunch of times. The drop test was impressive tho, should have stopped there."
I’m pretty sure they would have tested that before going live. Sometimes that’s just the way demos go. And Franz will now have to fight off the minor league recruiters with a stick
Honestly made the car look more cyberpunk though. And they did test it.
[https://tenor.com/6YWD.gif](https://tenor.com/6YWD.gif)
Intentional. Franz did it. He broke design theory. Meta bro. Think Elon. Think Franz. It was genius
"He said they tested it and it didn’t break, but for it not to go through is something. If a rock that big comes flying on the windshield. I would be happy with a broken windshield rather than a broken face"
Source on the tweet?
"I found the side cameras (which could double as mirrors if regulations change in time). They are in the front fender arches behind a small tinted piece of glass.

They certainly killed that thing with a stone.
Angled shapes aren't certainly the best option for pressurized interiors.

I love you.
"Lol, delusion people who didn’t vote “this is the worst unveiling ever”."
Chrome is the answer?
"It's pretty 50/50 on the new truck. Low price nice features, weird design."
No one remembers Diablo mobile smh
Certainly it can’t be the *worst* product launch *ever*...
"Part of the poll should have been “do you or have you ever owned a truck as your daily driver?”. I think for people that regularly use their trucks for work, this thing is laughable. There is a question asking “if you preferred trucks” but you aren’t able to skip it."

I wish they would buy someone’s rendering and change it.
"Yeah no, those renders are still pure garbage lol"
I don't understand what the fuck is happening. It has to be a joke but it somehow is not.
I was thinking that from the moment we saw it.  Good god...dammit tesla!
Sabotaged I am thinking
"I want to turn this off, it’s cringe worthy."

"I genuinely thought it was a joke. It looks awful and know id never get one...then I saw a picture of old school halo warthog and instantly fell in love with it. Once I made the connection, it all clicked for me. Fuckin love it. I want one. And the price is 100% affordable which is nice!"
"It’s very different from current Tesla car design, it’ll probably attract new Tesla fans that don’t like the S3XY designs but think this is the most beautiful car ever designed for non military usage."
"I think it mostly has to do with expectations. If some random company made a vehicle like this and you saw it going down the road and had no expectations I think most people would be in awe that something like that even exists, but being pre-colored with Tesla and their other designs people are shocked by this. In reality it's a different type of vehicle that serves the same purpose as a truck, but in my opinion a refreshing take on that concept. It's by far the most bad ass thing you can legally drive... and for the price of a boring old F150. I have absolutely no need for and would never buy a truck, but I am definitely getting this just because of how ridiculous it is."
1 out of 4 people “loving” the look of this truck on a Tesla subreddit is actually really bad.
"I didn't liked it that much at first, but as I learned about all the features it grew on me. The interior looks sick, and I know the body is stainless steel, but I hope that it comes in matte black or gunmetal. And that ATV better be real because I want it 😂."
Literally looks like Mad Max but wealthy
Sneaking up in me huh? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
In me? Nah not really
For the people who just *have* to drive a Warthog / Mako when they grow up
I'm a little confused. Is Tesla going to produce the ATV as well? You don't appear to be able to order it right now.
How the fuck didn’t they test that beforehand?
Big if
"it seemed like the breaking was intentional the way Elon and Franz handled it, or maybe the awkward was just dialed up to 11."
Suddenly the 150 looks like something from the 1920’s
"Yikes, No headroom in the rear?!"
I really hope my street doesn't get plugged up with tools driving and parking this behemoth.
"Next generation of cars? What are you, from '50s?"
"LOL Franz saw it coming too. ""...are you sure?"""
He is irate
Yeah. That was embarrassing
Someone just got fired for sure
Funding secured!
"I think we'll get used to the design *fast*, I already am a little. It won't come out tomorrow, so you still have time to decide ;)

Edit: maybe more angles help with getting used to it, [in this article there are 40 images from Motortrend](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info)"
The Ram 1500 starts at $32k but the model of Cybertruck that achieves those stats would cost you over twice as much. And isn't available for another 3 years.
"Late 2021 is officially the future though, it’ll be fine by then ;)"
"The Model 3 looked like an ugly potato compared to the S at first. I'm not worried about looks, it's a bit outlandish today, but by late 2021 I'm pretty sure we're gonna see it as awesome."
Yeah specs are nice but I want to know the range under load.
I feel like the backlash might make Tesla add some polygons. They still have 2 years to add a few lines lol
"I could tell the window break was coming. franz looked and sounded very hesitant to do it like he knew ""Elon no these are the prototype windows, they will break"" or something like that. I'm sure in actual normal conditions like rocks/pebbles flying up off the road, those windows would be near impenetrable. But throwing a steel ball at it... They rolled with it as best they could though but it was pretty cringe/awkward and anti-Tesla media is going to have a field day with the window break clips. 

EDIT: To their credit though, like Elon said, at least it didn't completely shatter. Regular glass would have basically turned to dust at the hands of a steel ball being thrown at it. it ended up functioning like bullet proof glass. It's meant to still crack/dent when shot because it being able to ""give"" without shattering is to slow down the bullets momentum so it doesn't actually pass through."
"> bullet proof stainless steel skin

perfect for their Syria market, or America market"
Both windows broke. Lol. Guess they needed someone inside tightening the red clamps
">bullet proof stainless steel skin

Perfect for the US market"
"I mean. You can bring me the best car in the world. But if it looks like a penis, I probably won't drive it.

  


This thing is literally too ugly to be seen in. So it better be fast. Cause it makes me want to gag. Does it come with a paper bag so I don't have to be seen behind the wheel?

Bring on the downvotes feckless fanboys."
The longer it goes the more scared I am that it's not a joke....
"Same here dude, I admit it looks goofy as fuck from most angles but it's absolutely insane what you're getting for the price."
I laughed too and the more and more I watched the more and more amazed I was
How rich are y'all?
It’ll have a HUD!
Elon?
"This looks like pure Elon, like nobody told him no. Tesla needs to do market research."
They'll be lucky if their head is still attached to the rest of their body lol
And also unnecessary.
"Totally self induced too, what a shitty idea, like why risk it this way?"
"If only Elon could fire himself, and maybe replace himself with a new self."
"if you think that wasn't 100% planned, i have a bridge to sell you. it's an obvious marketing tactic. When they were  dropping the balls on the glass you could see them unfasten the sheet of glass, allowing it to bounce. That's the only way to get it to not crack. They clearly knew the rigid glass on the car was going to shatter simply based on how big the last ball was."
Evidence he was pissed
"This reaction is why I'm still convinced something is going on..  surely your reaction would be, no, better not try and break another one!"
I almost want to bet they had a early version of the glass or something stupid on this prototype.
"It's all the money they saved on the body design, they're passing that savings onto the customer!"
I imagine they are getting good pricing on the steel by bulk buying along with SpaceX as one reason?
Production starts late 2021. By then model 3 will be 30k.
My guess is no paint and the body is both the body and frame so you get some huge reduced costs. Also curved body panels are expensive to make. I assume these flat panels are dirt cheap comparatively.
That was my thought as well...
"30k Model 3 would be the dream. This is scheduled to launch in like 2022 I think, so maybe they can get the 3's price down by then?"
These are late 2021 projected prices. Model 3 might be 30k by then.
This is a good question. They should have talked about things like this at the event
"Yeah... I'm wondering the same thing. We'll see what the safety rating ends up being, but I don't have high hopes... unless they drop the bulletproof steel thing."
"My firefighter brother said the same thing when they were talking about the windows. ""That's gonna make extrication a whole lot harder""."
You won't flip it because Teslas always land on their feet.
"Right?! And what about the other vehicle in an accident? Modern cars have crumple zones for a reason, does this thing??"
"If it’s like the other teslas then most the weight will be near the bottom where the battery is. So at least it’ll be hard to flip and favor wheels down when rolling. 

Still gonna be an issue if it flips, but at least there’s that."
[deleted]
[Reminds me of this](https://media0.giphy.com/media/koyWkwccCnTVK/giphy.gif)
This truck is way cheaper than I anticipated.
"The 500 mile Model comes out LATE 2022.

Why can't the long-range model s in LATE 2022 have 500m plus by then?"
"Probably a lot more comfortable and earlier to get in and out too, we want an X but I think the truck would be a better fit and more affordable 

Edit:by earlier I mean easier."
It's about tree fiddy
"More like late ‘70s version of 2020.

It’s like a delorean, Lamborghini countach, and a humvee had a love child."
Oddly well put
Yep.  A truck is a tool and if it works better than another tool i keep it
"Ticks off all the capabilities I wanted to see except 8 foot bed.  But, oof she’s hard to look at.  That exoskeleton make me think it will be impossible to repair and super high cost to insure.  Worse than my three already is."
Let's not get too excited. They could still Model 3 it and not release the low cost version.
Don't forget the front trunk. No need for a box in the back or to climb up the side to get tools.
"I guess I'm not thrilled with a lot of the features. 

Yeah great power but generators can go anywhere and I don't want to park next to where I'm working or run tons of extension cords. 

It depends on storage capability and pressure I guess. It just seems like a gimmick and thing to break and you're stuck waiting for spare parts. 

And not self driving not yet at least"
I liked it. Except for a broken window or two. If I would be looking for a truck then I'd buy that Tesla truck primarily for the performance and features. And why not have a car that looks like it was built by terminators from the future. That's just cool imho.
"That's how he operates. 

Tesla wasn't a sane business proposition. But here we are. I don't like the truck design, but I'm not counting it out yet."
I mean look at that thing. I thought he was joking when the truck came out. That is not CYBERPUNK. That is just a terrible design.
"Yeah until they opened it for the ATV, I figured it was just unfinished under the skin.  Since it clearly wasn't they should have showed that a lot more.  Hopefully they have more polished materials to publish quickly."
"Yeah, that's true. They didn't pull anything to show off the truck's power (except that silly tug of war), we didn't see anything on the inside, they fucked up the glass break test on the actual truck. That was really not well presented."
They always do this in their events. They show it off and end it. Usually the articles start coming the next few days and then the hype hits.
This is how all reveals go
"I mean they said it's 6.5 feet long and it fit that atv, so we got a glimpse of the bed"
This was the most uncomfortable live presentation I have ever seen. It is like watching a high school student give a presentation in front of the class. The slides didn’t match his topics. It is like he waited till the last minute and worked on his presentation in the back seat on the way to school
OOF
I guess it'll be a good chance to buy...?
Yeah same I'm done
Well...
Well thats because you cant see out of the side windows anymore.
Best part is the price.
He only hit the front door. The back was fine. It was a failure.
The doors looked fine. I think Franz just threw the ball at a bad angle.
"Hideousness, hard to accept"
"Right? This is closer to a G-wagon or the OG land rover or Jeep. All those were function first, form second and people thought they were super ugly at first. Elon should have explained it, but I strongly suspect the angular shape is because there is only so much forming you can do to that stainless body."
Yes the glass broke twice on stage haha
technically correct
lol
They do that with almost all prototypes.  Makes the lines look better
"some concepts don’t have them, but i’m hoping that confirms it’s not real. it also looked very poorly put together, so who knows"
Yes! And that's one nasty blind spot
I don't think the semi had mirrors during the reveal either.
DO A BARREL ROLL
"When it does get in a bad accident, they won't be able to open the doors or break the windows. They will cook inside the battery fire like a metal oven."
Exactly my thought too...
"It really doesn't make sense.

&#x200B;

I really can't believe that is what was presented.  If Rivian delivers on their promises with Ford this truck is gonna get destroyed."
"You might have to worry about somebody pitching giant ball bearings at the windows, though."
That was definitely on my mind when he did the sledgehammer demo
There will be a new wave of *prank* videos of people durability testing these in parking lots
Most underrated comment of the week
"I don’t think you can paint stainless, which kinda sucks."
For the 10 people who buy this fugly thing?
Your comment sent me to the floor but i still ordered two hahahaha
All that stainless steel is gonna be really really cheap
Until you drive at night and are blinded by the light
[removed]
"Haha, Not even close."
private
How come no one ever mentions Bollinger B1? It's a higher premium sure but what a quality design!
It fucking grows on you.
I’m with ya
"It’s freaking intimidating as hell!  In a good way!

Just want to pull up to the job site with one...."
"I think it's the stupidest looking Tekken ass vehicle I've ever seen. 

And I fucking want one."
Just imagine the faces when you park this thing and walk out. The look it grows on you.
"I think this is about to be a culture icon. Hip/hop, movies, come on! Go ahead and set your remind me for 2 years from now. I'll happily take cash bets that this moves more than just the needle. Our man knows how to bet the pot and he just bet BIG."
"I think this is the idea. It's like walking around with a mohawk. A lot of people will hate it but a few people will love it. 

That's my 2 cents anyway."
YES
"Same, I'm eyeing this bowl of almonds fiercely"
Were you satisfied?
So did u lose
Is that an actual thing and why?
I’m feeling physical pain.
I can. I did. Somebody please save me
I had to turn the size off for a minute or two after the glass shattered. That was way too awkward for me. Jesus...
It was a disaster. I was laughing the whole time!
I like the look of it
Because we have evolved past the 80s
Because we're not 12 years old anymore.
I’ve always said this.  We don’t want what we say we want.
"Quick, go through your Hot Wheels collection, I’m sure this was one of their designs from the 80’s"
PLEASE
"This is the shittiest truck I’ve ever seen before.  Please be a joke.

Edit: holy fuck it’s not a joke... welp, Rivian wins.  What a fucking mess."
"""Just fucking with you guys!  We had the set designer for 1990s Total Recall whip this up.   Here comes the real truck."""
Very much me. Had my $1000 deposit ready. Might be getting a Rivian now...
[deleted]
"They really need to work on their presentations. I mostly enjoy them, but Elon doesn't really understand how to keep the energy going.

The broken glass probably took the wind out of his sails a bit."
"It was god damn glorious is what it was, so much better than that pre-planned fake surprise BS from Ford Mach E launch"
Not enough polygons
"Nope, this is it"
"I sure hope so, otherwise I think I went to a bizzaro-land alternative universe"
"Maybe..............the real truck is later....nope, this is fucking real."
It’s going to be an interesting experiment of form vs function.
Good catch
Sometime between now and 2022 they will show up
"Side mirrors are made from mirrored steel that they haven’t invented yet...coming soon.  Side cameras are quantum cameras so they are invisible to the human eye.

Just kidding, but that is no less crazy than what we just saw."
It’s a preproduction piece of garbage. That’s why you didn’t see the interior and that’s why there’s no side mirrors.
Yeah it’s out for me. Says thanks for watching.
"Yes, because the event has finished."
yes
its over
Yes it did for me I want to see the ATV.
"Yeah, was wondering the same thing..."
its done
Yeah too bad the truck doesnt look as cool as the atv
He's busy changing the world.
"I think he cut it short. He kept looking back at the smashed windows in disbelief and he was probably embarrassed and pissed and wanted to get that ""truck"" off the stage as soon as possible."
"order page says production starts late 2021, deliveries in 2022."
Sounds like we won't get trucks until early 2022...just when my lease runs out on my Tacoma.  Sorry Toyota.
They’re grabbing the pics for memes
I sure hope when you get into a crash the Cybertruck doesn't just laugh it off while turning the occupants into a bunch of red paste and broken bones.
Kevin Hart will be screaming annoyingly somewhere in the scene as well
Best comment. If it comes true you get gold. I’ll even give you till next summer too.
Rationalizations kicking in already!
Painting stainless steel is very tricky.
I think that would look SO much better
I would like that too. It will look way too cool with a black finish.
Your bottom question is what has me thinking it's a sick joke. There is no way it does well in crash tests.
Looks like it crumples whatever it runs into ...
">	Trunk bed looked heavy as fuck. No powered lift?

I was curious about the bed the entire time and the ATV portion resolved some of it. The cover is essentially a tonneau cover that retracts upwards towards the roof and seems to be powered.

Idk the material so idk if you can see through it or not.

>	Stop light bar is on a moving piece?

Instantly stood out too me as well. I did also notice during the ATV part that the light extends beyond the tailgate so there are stationary lights on both sides. They seemed small though.

Beyond that I have no answers. I have tons of questions myself."
"> Can I see out the back? (Rear-view?)

You can see out the back when the bed cover is retracted (watch when they load the ATV)."
Lots of things will be added in the release version because of DOT requirements.
"> Stop light bar is on a moving piece?

Yes, which is why there are also lights inside the jamb of the gate."
"I don't think they've had side mirrors on any unveil. If it wasn't illegal, every auto manufacturer would have cameras instead of mirrors immediately. Law may change soon though, so who knows. It helps a lot with aerodynamics to get rid of them.

None of their vehicles have come with a spare, doubt this will be any different. 

You obviously won't be able to see out the rear when the cover is on. This cover is a pretty big design element though, as it is pretty important for range. But there 100% was a rear glass to see into the bed. So if you have the cover down, you can.

Powerlift is standard on the Model Y, but not the Model 3. So Who knows. That is also something that can easily be added later as the design gets more finalized. 

Stop light is on the back of the tailgate. However when the tailgate is down it reveals that there is also a stop light on each side where the tailgate meets the side wall...

I imagine the truck will crumple just fine if hit in the front. The sides look like they'll be stronger than a normal truck and the back will probably be the same.

EDIT: On the test drives, the rear view mirror is a screen showing the rear view camera...So looks like they solved for the bed cover covering the rear glass."
Check out Zero motorcycles. Literally that but with 2 wheels.
I’m the opposite. Can’t wait for more info in that four wheeler.
I love the lack of borders and the subtle fade from the map to the rest of the screen
"It does. If you go watch some of the test drive videos, it shows the rear view mirror is a bit like the new high trim chevys that use a camera to show everything behind them like you’d see normally"
Worried about rear visibility—have you driven a Model 3?
You were wrong.
"Not everyone will love it, was always promised. Fortunately, I do."
I did the same.  I was trying to draw a Lambo.
"Yup, now it just gonna stay like that for the rest of the presentation

""UH, IN ADDITION, THE CAR HAS AN ADAPTIVE AIR SUSPENSION?"" lol"
"wait I stopped watching, he broke the window himself?"
Yup same. 50 grand is a freaking steal IMO. It looks crazy af but I kind of like it. Reminds me a lot of the delorean.
Seriously. My three year old Model X just gasped a WTF at the price per specs
"Yeah, this thing outperform the Y too as a people mover. I’m very confused right now."
They can't sell it for that price today. I'm sure they've got a long way to go...
That's the discount for the ugly
They’ll probably do it as soon as they develop the motor. That version doesn’t go in to production until late 2022 so it is all hypothetical at this point.
"Cybertruck price is probably fleet ready. Companies that would utilize a truck like this can't justify the higher dollar. I'm sure there were a ton of studies to come to that number.

Edit: Also consider how much cheaper the body is to manufacture with all the flat surfaces and straight edges."
Model X is an old model that is in desperate need of a refresh. It’s like trying to cram all of the new tech in the body of an iPhone 3G.
"Model X is the most beautiful Tesla. I was hoping the truck wouldn’t be called cyber truck, and would look like model x."
Probably in the future
"The Roadster 2020 is also a tri-motor, so I suspect we'll see that configuration on the S/X. Note how the rear badge is ""Dual Motor"" now. I think they're getting us ready for ""Triple Motor"" or ""Tri-Motor."""
yeah in 2022
Oh...you thought the next years Model X was gonna have the same specs? 😂 Have you heard of this amazing engineer named Elon🤔? You might wanna read up on him. He builds rockets and stuff.
"It even makes less sense comparing it to a Model 3. The AWD version of both are $1k apart but the truck has adaptive air suspension, shatterproof glass, etc. and is just as fast and goes as far on a charge."
"I think it's just lighter than the X, so has better acceleration."
"I suspect the reason why the truck is so inexpensive is no paint, no weird doors, super simple construction, several years of motor and battery tech advances."
That’s because there’s something hinky going on here
"Thing is gonna turn heads, that's for sure. I think it looks fucking badass."
There’s going to be a lot of hate
So fucking metal.
I also love all of it!
"It's growing on me. They did open the presentation on how all trucks look the same, theirs definitely looks different."
I feel the same way. The image of it towing against the F-150 completely won me over.
they could have accomplished all of that without it being ugly as fuck
That bed is massive!
"edit: Not a fan of the racing steering, don't uninvent the wheel.

Mass Effect ~~Nomad~~ Mako vibes *for sure*"
Awesome that's it's got a front center seat
I hope (and assume) there are settings for the steering wheel's sensitivity because that looked awkward af
And of course it has a light bar above the cab.
Congratulations! That’s exciting!
"Lolol should have had some straight-line, slightly pixelated mountains in the background."
Yup. They just fucking blew it. Ford is going to release a semi-decent electric F-150 that looks normal and is going to sell.
"I’ll get downvoted for saying this but I actually like it in a weird kind of way. If they made a regular truck it would just blend. It would be what we expected. They’ll come out with another more conventional version a few years down but I think this will get a ton of news coverage. It’ll turn heads more than a Ferrari. Elon even said “it’s not for everyone”

If I worked in construction I would be so excited to get mine delivered."
They're never going to convert those F-150 owners. They just blew it.
"On the other hand, how many can they actually make anyway? The controversial design may keep the sales low enough for them to keep up with demand."
"Tesla got their big start by making a normal looking sports car, that was electric.. That was their entire thing.. That was their entire selling point, and what made them popular. 

What the fuck is Elon doing?

Just make a normal looking truck, with those specs, and you're good.


The reason the first Tesla's did so well was because every other company was churning out ugly shit like this when it came to their electric range."
"Fuck that. This thing looks ridiculous and that's why I want one. I'm dreaming of all the cool paint jobs you could put on this thing. Halo, Back To the Future, Tron...."
Literally. They could've dominated a good portion of the truck enthusiasts. But noooo
"I have a landscaping business and I was seriously ready to order a truck from Tesla. This is just too out there for me. I was expecting a *different* design but uh. 

No shots of the interior either?"
I think right now they’re aware they don’t have capacity to build a truck with crazy demand
What a massive lost opertunity. Rivian is going to take thar business.
Literally the entire (and only) market for this thing is YouTubers looking for crazy thumbnails...
100% agree
Not with my normal salary I’m not
But Homer Simpson designed Cybertruck so...
"I vowed I wouldn’t replace my 15 year old Tacoma until there was an affordable fully eclectic truck on the market. I was really looking forward to this reveal but my god is it ugly. 

I value utility and function over styling but I also don’t like to draw attention to myself."
"No, they don’t care about that. They are trying to change the game to make cares like that obsolete. It’s called a hail mary, if they change design standards so that this becomes ‘hot’ they will be ahead of everyone. If it flops, and their competitors continue to dominate sales, they just pull it and try again."
"Yeah, Tesla Motors, ""we love normal mediocrity, come to us if you want the same shit that car companies have been slinging for the last few decades.""

That's their motto, right?"
This is the real kicker for me. I don’t own a Tesla but was ready to put a deposit tonight if I liked what I saw. Time to go look at the Rivian...
"If you thought it was going to be remotely normal looking you weren't paying attention. We were warned several times it would look like a movie prop, be polarizing, and be unconventional."
"Starting at $40k with very low running costs, there will be no shortage of douchebag bros lining up to buy this."
I was afraid this was going to be the result. He’s gone against the grain I guess. That’s for sure.
"Yeah, it’s gotta be"
At least they didn't try it a second time... Oh God they broke another window 🤦
That's a decision they should never have made. It's way too risky. Don't do live demonstrations of stuff that could go wrong.
I straight up bailed on watching it because of how awkward that was. Omega oof.
He sucks at public speaking.
He wings it.
Think he’s still shook from the windows breaking
it seems to me like this is the first time he's actually seen the truck in person and it's having the same reaction as the rest of us. Except he has to sell it. That's the only way I can explain the way he's acting right now.
you new? lol elon always does this
"He's getting ahead of the presentation, presumably because people aren't hooting and cheering."
5 dollars he is high af rn.
Hoping the internet can work their magic like they did with the Sonic movie.
The specs might be as good as the glass specs...
"The alloy. I'm telling you, it is really hard to form that steel."
The glass was demoed before and didn‘t shatter. Then they tried it on the actual truck and the glass broke.
"Yes, I think by law you need to be able to shatter the windows for fire rescue or if you drive it into a lake."
"Saying the glass should shatter so that you can break through it and escape in the event you cannot open the door is like the equivalent of saying police should shoot criminals in the leg to simply incapacitate them instead of killing them.

Utterly unrealistic scenarios that exist in people's minds that just don't simply happen in reality.  I would even go as far as to say the number of times someone shattered the window in their own car to escape a situation where they couldn't open the door has essentially never happened. Maybe 1 instance per year if that.

Did you know there's never been a documented instance in human history where two submarines have fought each other underwater shooting torpedos at each other like in the movies?  Look it up.  Kinda like that."
"It looks amazing, people just have no taste."
"I actually like the aggressively straight lines.  The X and Y actually bug me a bit because when you make big vehicles sleek and curvy, they just look bloated and fat.  This is weird, and initially makes me think Pontiac Aztek, but I think the design actually succeeds in ways that much-maligned crossover didn't.  No idea if people will buy it."
"After watching the event, i got the impression that this was a Spacex engineered truck for mars that has been marketed by Tesla."
No he was dumping on other carmakers for making vehicles for mass appeal instead of what inspired them.
"Looks were not a consideration in this design.

It’s pure function over form."
It does look ridiculous. I love it! I love how weird it is.
Eeeeexactly
They're trying to see all the stuff that Musk left out of the presentation for some reason.
I admire your unbridled optimism
We're not going to Mars
both of em? ha
"I was waiting for it to finish rendering, but this is exactly what I thought when it unveiled lol"
Being sensible doesn't allow for good memes lol
"I mean, hammers and stuff do get flung around job sites and dropped off of things on occasion. Not that it really matters since the glass will be different in two years anyways."
Everyday if you’re Batman
this is the 2020 version of a hummer
Truck windows break a lot in the working world. My company fleet vehicle have 2 of 22 with broken windows right now.
"Im pretty sure the lug nut i got hit with last year would have been fine, but a steel bearing the size of a baseball is a lot for any glass. even the bulletproof stuff cracks."
The original 64 bit Lara with pointy boobs?
"Not atari, but ps1."
Low polygon titties!
oh yeah what was that polygon tank game?
That was a thing? That's one of my favorite aspects of the car!
"they still do. Most people I know think teslas are exciting but look ugly. 

And people also bitched about the lack of a instrument cluster and most people are now saying that they still miss it or that they got used to it, which means they also still miss it."
Unless they've setup the molds it should be too difficult to tweak the design. I'm more worried about what happens if you get into a wreck that results in a slightly damaged exoskeleton. Would they just total the car? Bring the shape back into spec would seem like a near impossible task.
Tesla won’t make variations of any of there cars. Tesla only serves as a disruptor
Looks great from the inside.
"everything is on the screen in the middle, that looks like a big old distraction from driving.  also those headlights look like a nightmare to drive against."
The accurate statement is actually: it’s the first vehicle using the 2020’s decade design language.
"I made a practical version:

https://i.imgur.com/VtDQn1n.png

Edit: No, it's not a standard looking pickup. I tried to maintain the design elements from the truck while making it bigger and maybe like less of a triangle.

The point of the design is that the rear end is really a topper. I.e. it comes off.

It's a quick sketch, not a criticism of the vehicle. Literally a more practical version for people who need to haul more shit or go overlanding."
Ordered one. Cancelled my y.
G Wagon at least looks utilitarian. This looks like a kid’s idea of a DeLorean.
S 3 G X Y
going to get a sphere car next year then maybe some abstract Picasso car after
Lol
I've been watching the Rivian truck.
Workhorse electric truck should fit the current market much better.
just break it with a small metal ball. no dramas.
"They will just saw through the hardened steel exterior. You'll^1 be out in mere days.

1 the still smoking husk of carbon that is your corpse, anyway."
"Exactly how I feel, I’m form follows function person.  Love the steel and the $40k starting price"
I feel exactly the same way.
This explains what I am feeling very accurately as well
That thing is so ugly I wouldn't even park next to it
"I'm picturing an AirPods-esque situation for this thing. ""No fucking way I'd wear those"", to a status symbol. Only a matter of time."
Nice thank you
Good point.
Yeah it was
"Lol, I hope so..."
F-117 is by now a really antiquated design and a result of insufficient computing power when it was designed. The latest stealth design isn't angular like that and performs better.
I think the whole broken window thing messed up his mental state
I don't think I've seen him speak publicly where he seems prepared
he never does.
We have plenty of elon time to get use to it.
Why wouldn't they (insert plethora of questions here)
"Or like, don’t do it? A lot of time spent on glass strength - no one asked for that or cares. That, and the awful timing of supporting visuals ruined the magic of the demo."
"if the glove don't fit you must acquit....

Never do something live that you are not 110% sure of the results. 

Oh well...it’s Elon."
They obviously would have tested it. I’m guessing franz (the dude throwing) grabbed the wrong size ball from the drop test shown just before.
"Not even a steering wheel...

Everything about this screams a nope"
[deleted]
"Beautiful interior. Somehow, the design of the truck is growing on me greatly. Utility of this with 500 mile range would be enormous."
Oh for fucks sake... he couldn’t even give it a normal steering wheel?!?
Two so you can test metal balls on even more windows?
I ordered one too...do they send an email with acknowledgement?
No you didn’t
"Yeah, I love it and my wife gave said we could get one. I have a feeling I am going to have to start the negotiations from the beginning when she wakes up and see it... atleast its 10k cheaper?"
Even the font is the same lmao. Watch this truck be in the game
They turned down the settings so it would go faster
"It reminds me of the Walrus ATV from Carrier Command. I suppose that's what happens when the primary design constraint is the polygon count.

Asking the real question here
"Hoping it comes with it. Volkswagen was like, ""so in our latest concept, you can see here we have a couple electric skateboards for zipping around town after you park."" and Elon was like, ""BITCH, HERE'S AN ATV!"""
"If you go to the web site you can configure 3 different models, the 2 higher end models are AWD."
Life is too short
"Yeah, where is the real truck?  This is embarrassing for the company."
"stock -100 tomorrow, off of a niche vehicle that is going to fail."
[deleted]
Elon.
No shit. We had faith in him. We was wrong.
This seems probable
I hope so. that was so sad.
"this went through my mind immediately: unbreakable glass could turn this thing into a deathtrap. It could be the safest car in the world in a wreck, but if you get physically pinned in, how do you get out??"
"It was also cut short by the fact he skimmed over sections accidentally. Really, really bad presentation"
Yeah... the windows... that’s it
Did he say that?
All the renders has shitty short beds
"No idea why anyone made fun of the renders. They looked great.

Can’t find a supercharger in the middle of Fallujah Iraq tho....
Just the fact that the military wouldn't need to stockpile fuel for them would be a reason to go electric
I thought it was going to be the military model and then they’d role out a civilian model lol
"Well.. TBH SpaceX does have military contracts. See: Starlink, SpaceX. Long history of American manufacturers taking advantage of fat military contracts when it serves the bottom line and ultimate goal.. colonization of Mars before 2030. 😉"
"Just....no

Not enough graft involved."
"its like modern art, once Rothko and Pollock proved they could paint well traditionally, they started making weird shit and breaking rules, and that's why they are famous. if nothing else, this car will be remembered for how WTF it is"
Or... Musk lied about testing it before hand and the only reason the test glass didn't break was because it wasn't as firmly attached.
Or the prototype on stage had regular glass and not the super fancy glass
Prestressed in rehearsals. Lol.
Uncanny
Take your upvote.
interesting idea but I wonder if itll be expensive enough to be a money symbol. it's definitely eye catching so the same type of people will like it for the attention
"I agree, great for cashed up types, useless for blue collar workers that actually use trucks to get work done."
Hell ya
this is a rare comment to actually make me audibly laugh. this is the true reason to by the truck
I can't wait to see what lap time this thing gets on the Nürburgring.
Well keep imagining because nobody will be getting their hands on one that fast until 2023 and by then BMW and Merc will lively have electric SUVs that accelerate quickly too
You're more likely to see them sold at the same price but with more range.
What they really need is a $20 - $25000 car.  Even if it only does 0-60 in 7-8 seconds and has a 200 mile range I don't think anybody will ever buy a Corolla or Civic again. The Camrys and Accords are already mostly the same price as the Model 3 when you get into the higher trims.
Imagine how much of the Truck market share they could get if they didn't make the most hideous car I have ever seen.
"I suspect pretty much all of the cost savings come from the new exoskeleton construction and lack of paint. I'm sure projected battery cost savings are baked in too, since this thing isn't coming out for at least 2 years."
Would you buy a cheaper 3 if it had a simple and cheap body like that?
[deleted]
"It should have been more ""cab forward"". This would allow a small flat on the roof and drastically improve the looks.

Some other observations:
- Major body roll/shifting in the 911 race video. Air suspension might still be in development. 
- Is the dashboard granite??
- No mention of exterior mirrors.
- No mention of frunk features. 
- No pass thru bed? 
- Tires have custom sidewalls. I doubt this will make it to production. 
- Tires protrude. Legally I believe they connot protrude more than 1""...looks close.
- Was hoping to hear more about features such as bed tie-down options, interior materials, suspension/drivetrain design, lighting technology, off-road technologies, water fording ability, etc."
"The point at the top is strange.  Also, the range information needs to include the effects of large payloads and trailers"
Exactly my thoughts. I so want to like this thing but the look of it is killing me.
"Parallels Ford, probably intentionally ""If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”"
"Funny, just watched the Chance the Rapper on Hot Ones today and Sean brings up a similar quote.

https://youtu.be/SB98eQE4KkU?t=436

> Fans, they don't know what they fucking want. No one wanted Jimi Hendrix before he came along. No one wanted Oasis till we came along. No one wanted The Sex Pistols. They don't know what they want until you give it to them.

In Walter Issacson's biography of Steve Jobs, he quotes Job as saying ""because customers don't know what they want until we've shown them"" back in 1982.

I don't know that this is going to be THE truck, but I love the boldness of it all. The design is definitely growing on me. The poor presentation did it no favors, whereas the Motortrend articles actually got me a bit hyped."
What if they give it back?
"All the other companies will have boring designs that will look like ICE counterparts. CybrTrk is radical in looks, practical with great specs.  My hunch is that 80% will not like it, but the other 20% would be open to it.  That is a big enough market for Tesla (like Windows/macOS or Android/iOS).  I didn't care much about the demo, but Elon should have avoided the glass test:-) Give credit to him, the guy is genuine, he is pushing the envelope.  I put the deposit and unhappy that I can't get CybrTrk in a year."
"1. Probably not, but you'd have to lower the truck all the time if it won't ride in that configuration. Additionally, due to the slanted bedrails, it will be a pain in the ass putting things over the side regardless of height. 
2. Unless you're moving rocks or wet soil regularly, you're not often hauling 1.5+ tons in the bed of any pickup. 3,400 lb capacity is nice, but the people who are moving weight like that are often using fifth wheel hitches which the cybertruck seems incapable of since you'd have to cut through the bed which is attached to the rest of the truck body.
3. You can get a stock 6.5' bed 2020 F-150 for $28k
4. If you go offroading ground clearance is great, yes. Anyone who uses a truck for work really doesn't care about this as long as it's good enough for driving on/off a jobsite. 
5. A max configured F-150 is good for hauling your boat a few times a year, anyone looking to tow heavy and often is going to get a less fancy F-250/350. Most work done with an F-150 is not towing, but working from the bed."
"I've been in the market for an F150 for a few months so I am familiar: the cybertruck is the equivalent of the crew cab on the Ford which on comes with a 5.5ft bed, the supercab version (which is just an extended cab with jump seats and limited legroom) is the one with a 6.5ft bed. So for them to do a full crew cab with a 6.5ft bed they had to push the cab forward, and that's not a problem because there's not some huge engine in front of the passengers.

My problem with the ""cab forward"" design is what I call the ""caliber effect"". I rented a Dodge Caliber for a trip once and it was one of the worst driving experiences I've ever had. Was on Pacific Coast Hi-way and the stupid A-pillar was in the way around every left hand turn."
"Good breakdown. I tried comparing but found Ford's pricing and number of options a bit overwhelming.

I also wonder if lowering the truck will make side-access any easier."
I can imagine them making a conventional looking truck with the same specs. Will sell like hot cakes. Personally I would prefer the cyber truck.
What do you think of the interior
"Model 3 is a great looking car, congratulations. This is just awful. I think they took ""built like a tank"" and ""cyberpunk"" too serious."
"I thought it looked awesome.  Weird, head turning, WTF awesome.  But I also like weird shit."
Slap some matte olive green in there and it might be purdy
lol yeah tesla is going to manuf. a non road legal vehicle
Hell ya
"Half of you don't care for it, half of you do. Such will be the case for the rest of the public. Many people will see the design as stunning, revolutionary, and finally a major car manufacturer making an amazing design that reflects on our current society. Others won't care for it. That controversy will only fuel it's sales."
I think the truck and the event will be laughed at in the media unfortunately.
"It’s incoherent with the mission. They have to sell trucks to help lower emissions, but made a polarizing weirdmobile. Truck buyers in the heartland won’t get laid if they drive this thing!"
Looks wise it's exactly what I was expecting. Ridiculous. As long as it functions I'm good with it.  Especially at that price. I definitely think it could bomb in public opinion though.
"Honestly it doesn't matter. Either they get flooded with pre-orders or they don't. If they do it'll be a success, if they don't it'll be a niche product and they'll move on to other things."
Yeah I was like what the...????

Thanks! Was disappointed they made the official vid private

I think the test proved it ain’t bulletproof.
The only thing that we can be sure of rn is that the windows are in fact NOT bullet proof lol

"Franz, can you step into the driver's seat please?"
"Bullet-resistant glass will do the same (it creates visible cratering on the surface layer, dissipating the energy around the surface rather than penetrating through. Still looks bad on the outside, but the occupants inside are okay.

The glass is plenty tough by the looks of it. And it may be strong enough to deflect lower caliber rounds at shallow angles. That metal ball would've just passed through normal safety glass, shattering the whole thing."
They could have had those specs and a conventional design. Don’t overthink it
You dropped a T my g
In the cyber world rain textures are bitmap so are the wipers.
It doesn’t even have rear view mirrors yet
"I'm beginning to feel this thing is so early in the development cycle, that necessities like that simply haven't been addressed yet.

Then again, with how terrible Tesla's auto wipers are, maybe it's better to not have them, and regularly reapply Rain-X."
"Honestly when the first one broke I was expecting them to say ""lol jk that was normal glass the other window is the real one"""
"They probably didn't test the glass installed in that location. The way the glass is held in doors is way more loose then a front windshield, this will cause vibration and make it much easier to crack the glass."
Someone's getting fired

Possible the installed glass wasn't the production glass.
the speed was different.

Well first we had ludicrous speed... would not be surprised if we get Death Blossom at some point
Wow it’s extremely split. Following this
C) don't give a f*** how it looks if it will do all that and doesn't cost the GDP of a2nd world nation! I thought this was a joke at first.
"Currently at 26% amazing.... I’m in that group.

I absolutely want to pull one onto a job site!

In 2 years, all manufacturers will have a truck that takes the design cues from this."
"When I clicked the link, the post was behind a ""this image may contain erotic content. Continue?"" Flag and I laughed"
"Covered bed, built in ramp, outlet, works for me"
"When you say ""for work"" - how do workers use their trucks in ways that this won't suit them? Most trucks sold today are purchased by businesses."
Could it be that they can’t bend the metal or something?
"Was the glass demonstration botched? Ballistic glass is designed to not let objects through.

Look at any ballistic glass demonstration and the glass always “breaks” but doesn’t allow the projectile through. 

The fact that it repealed the projectile makes it a successful demonstration; unless the steel ball went through? it was difficult to tell on one of those throws."
I hope not. This car is styled as a nostolgic novelty. Not really something people buy cars based on. At least not me. This truck is aimed towards people who though John Delorean was really onto something (he wasn't)
based and truthpilled.
Lol jesus dude im dying
You can do it! Hang in there bud
Why did I stay up for this
It’s the ugliest fucking thing I’ve ever seen and I can’t wait to get one. I’m going to feel like Batman driving that thing.
He said the Model 3 would be an alien spaceship and we got “Tesla design language with slight evolution”.  So I expected Tesla design language with some blade runner design queues.
I was thinking ‘blade runner inspired’ not like an actual prop from the movie Blade Runner.
Lowest point of the show
Unleash the power of the pickup truck!
Omg 😂
THE POWER.. SQUARED!
"The entire point of Tesla is to change of conversation of the car industry.  The idea isn’t to win, sell the most cars, or beat the other guys.  We just saw this happen with Ford releasing their all electric car and Elon applauding them.  I love the concept of changing what we think a truck should be.  Every Ford, GMC, Chevy, etc looks 95% the same.  This changes the conversation and gives freedom to what a “truck” is.  I love it.  This is what Tesla is."
"it reminds of ""future"" cars from the 80's and 90's movies where everything was still boxy like there normal cars.  Unfortunately people seem to enjoy some more curve in there designs now adays and that trend has really only continued, even on trucks which are far less boxy then they were in the 70's-90's."
did you call my baby ugly?
Too bad literally everyone buying a car is a human that's been exposed to modern trends.
"I suspect they did the research and expect the look shouldn't effect sales too much, but who knows. 

I personally think once it's in the showrooms and on the road, sales will increase slowly, but exponentially. It takes time for people's preference to change, but eventually they do. That's why we have the saying ""it grew on me"""
It looks like a 3 year old designed it dude
"As someone who uses a truck daily, this thing doesn't look functional at all. Long angled windows make it hard to see out of and get an idea of where your truck is. That's why have tall almost perpendicular windows all around. Truck bed area looks terrible too. That tailgate didn't look easy to use."

Yo it's ugly. There's no subjectivity involved.
For the first 15 seconds I was pretty sure he was punking us and was going to unveil the real truck.   Still hoping it is a long play punk and the new truck will be unveiled later tonight.
It looks like it was made from a folded bar napkin
I'm a little jelly I didn't hold off from buying my 3 to get this behemoth. They're the same price!
Back to the Future is practically eligible to be on the Turner Classic Channel. The same for DeLorean. Taking design cues from those means your looking ***back*** almost 40 years.
You want something no one else has that will grab a lot of attention
Yeah. I am mad at it for this reason.
"I wanted an electric delorean anyway, so I'd love to strap a Mr. Fusion on that ugly beast... but I don't think that was the intention."
Yeah I hate the flying buttress bed . That design has been proven to be a problem on pick up trucks . But I want one tomorrow. Elon did say if enough people hated it they would redesign it . So they're is still hope
yes. it added 5 minutes. GGRRRRR
Yes
Mine did.
I’m so confused!
im high and idk whats going on
I'm starting to think this isn't a joke.
"they probably hit it a few times to test it is good before the main event and caused mini cracks which shattered. 

That was something. I guess after Bill Gates BSOD this is the new thing to remember. 

""fuck it, we'll do it live"" is a bad idea here. Totally backfired."
"Yeah, didn’t they, like, *test* that beforehand??"
Do the other one.
"> Elon unveils the Cybertruck, circa 2019

""But it didn't go through"""
Holy shit imagine being anyone who was involved with that presentation and the glass whatsoever.
"Looks like its running the course on American Gladiator, circa 1991."
Eh the fat ass back didn’t look great either.. does it have a good angle? The entire thing is just weird angles.. it’s like looking at a car designed by Picasso
I didn't know my 6 year old nephew worked in Tesla Design
Haha
It looks dopey tbh. There’s no frame of reference.
It looks like a metal Mario goomba
At first my jaw hit the floor.  Then after a minute I was digging on it.  Then the spec list... I'm sold
Yeh.
I’d really like to see it next to a regular truck to get a sense of scale
or the really dark side of the moon
One of the few level headed and reasonable responses on here lol.
After seeing this reveal... rivian is going to make a killing... I’d be going to rivian for a ev truck at this point
this is the real answer.    hes selling pickups for those that take their truck to lowes on the weekend only.
No you won't warm up to it.  It's design is useless as a pickup and wasn't designed for the typical truck market.  I too am looking elsewhere.
Repair of the exoskeleton is going to be interesting to hear about.
I think you make good points about the body damage issues and abilities of changing the bed but it's a 150 class nobody does that to a 150. I personally think it's overbuilt for the majority of 150 class buyers and just shy of the majority of heavy duty class buyers. I love it but I need an 8 ft box and higher payload for towing heavy equipment like my superduty.
"I'm definitely going to modify the design.

I can picture something in my head that I want really badly which wouldn't cost any more than the current version of the truck.

I'd raise the rear slope, have a section of the roof actually relatively flat.

Can't wait to get started on it. I want to design an integrated topper design. So, the option to have a lower side.

I was definitely picturing something more militaristic looking since he said ""armored personnel carrier.""

I keep having visuals of something I really want out of what already looks pretty cool but not quite there for me."
Tesla hasn't yet started making the last 3 vehicles they unveiled. Put the credit card away re-examine in 2022 if they're even close to production at that point.
"Air suspension is mandatory for both 16"" of ground clearance and any meaningful highway range."
You don't take over markets by making weird mobiles. As proven by s3x .
Exactly. People are just angry their imagination was wrong.
Cybertruck is going to eat all their lunches as soon as people realize this is a much better product for cheaper.
I prefer Truckla
Honestly this is way better.
actually looks a lot better!
And here's another view I quickly edited showing the difference it makes.  Really all they need to do is make the aerodynamic back removable like the aero wheels on the 3 and it's good to go for me. https://imgur.com/a/DnztkrI
Actually helps some
Honestly... that looks way better.
"Looks nice, but you just ruined the aero, and dropped the range by 25 - 50% :/"
That's better   flood it white
Exactly what I was thinking. Much better
Smooth that angular roof a bit and you have me sold.
Woah nicely done.
1000% Better
I thought I was going nuts. Glad it’s not just me.

Did he have his damn mind in the first place?
"""I shouldn't watch this high... Am I high? I don't remember taking drugs... That's probably the drugs."""
Or stayed up in my case. And I don‘t even have a driver’s license.
"Not good, I suspect they don’t have the final glass in the prototype"
Right?!?!?
"Agreed. I feel like their unveils always make me cringe a little, but this is terrible."
"Not going to lie... This is beeing hard to watch.

And some people are actually liking the design... He could present anything and people will still praise him."
"Yes, the glass breaking really threw him off."
Yeah big time. Probably from the failed glass stunt.
The windows *actually* breaking definitely threw him off. No way they meant for that to happen. And that's on top of the design being extremely unpopular.
I think the glass caught him by surprise.
It’s a massive disaster of a reveal. They literally broke the window after saying it couldn’t be broken.
This is how awkward he always is; did you watch the other unveils?
Dude is probably beyond pissed lol
It's for the greater good
Technically all unibody cars are exoskeletons.
Unibody cars are not new...
"""Poorly"" is my first thought but you could probably design the underlying structure to only crumple once a certain load is exceeded.  In theory that could get you the best of both worlds."
"I would imagine they've already tested that, but maybe not"
I expect it will live up to the same standards as the Model S and 3
I was 100% expecting the guy was going to crash trying to ride the ATV onto the pickup bed. Elon must have bought a cursed monkey paw before he did this demo.
100% on the ATV. I was hoping they were going to throw that in.
The ATV actually improved the look of the truck.
I thought he was going to throw that in at the end. Too bad.
I'm hoping many more supercharger locations will be up by then to make the 300 mile range worth it for people like myself who go way into the backcountry
"An extra year and an extra $20k... I get that it will have a much bigger battery, but 20k?!"
What Franz ?   Yeah he should have 'pulled' that throw a little !
"I think the breaking glass really shook him, threw off the entire presentation."
Right! The main actual important features were completely glossed over. That was the most disappointing.
"> What I'm more interested in is how does payload or towing affect those ranges?

Towing, IIRC, essentially halves range, due to extra weight, and much increased drag.

Payload under the aero bed cover - will be more of an issue in stop/start driving - though electric vehicles are more efficient there anyway, but won't be much of an issue at highway speeds, unless speeding up and slowing down a lot. Payload that is irregular shapes, and not under the aero bed cover will be very draggy, and impact range more."
"Ridgeline is unibody and it does alright. This does beat that by a fair margin, though.You won't even be able to fit a 5th wheel in that bed, so this is definitely in Ridgeline territory. None of the HD stuff."
"Body on frame is cheaper and tougher but not as safe as unibodies (as unibodies have crumple zones). And I say tougher as they can reinforce the frame to deal with towing forces (primarily against torsion) .   

But the main reason everyone loves body on frames in the truck/off-road space is that everything is pretty much replaceable and moddable. (Think about specialized trucks with cranes and welders etc...)"
If it’s a steel exoskeleton as described you can just weld stuff to it wherever you want
Too long of wheel base probably.  It’d high center too much
"The whole presentation was terrible, they never even showed pictures of the interior."
">:)

:)"
"Yeah my 10yr old son loves the S,3, &X but hates the cybrtrk"
But 1/4 as beautiful
The other car will crumple twice as hard to compensate
"Yea, since it's so strong and rigid, wouldn't it actually cause the other car to crumple even more or if  the crash is into a solid object such as a tree or pole, wouldn't the force go to the occupants?"
"Yes, with the tailgate up, over the edge, like most trucks"
Asking the important questions!
Yes
Not quite. 6.5ft bed.

This.  Elon mentioned the body was constructed in an exoskeleton manor for strength
"Nobody forced them to use stainless. 
Pretty sure titanium is more of a pita to work with.  SR-71 turned out quite nice."
From the 80s with terrible graphics?
It's a frickin badass head turner. Love it
"This thing has literally no crumple zones. The car will survive a crash, but the passengers inside will be jelly."

"Yes, standard automotive safety glass is legally required all around. Not sure what the point of that glass presentation was."
I bet they were supposed to do the demo on the windshield.
That’s a really great point.
The presidents limousine glass windows don’t break and he’s pretty safe. It is safer in some instances to have bulletproof glass. Maybe not for the normal person
"Someone brought up a key point though, which I haven’t seen answered:

If the “exoskeleton” is load bearing, wtf do you do if you’re in a fender bender?"
"There's a reason cars are more rounded than angular... Most people use trucks for work, but also for every day driving. So I don't get it. Would be another matter if it was a huge monster truck not made for regular roads and only for work... but this.."
This what the US auto makers did in the 80's and 90's and they were able to cost save the vehicles to the point no one wanted them anymore. I don't want this either.
Definitely more practical that way. Maybe they should make it like that of you don’t pick the auto sliding bed cover in the back.
I was hoping to see this somehow! I like it
A single angle at the start of the windshield would be 10/10
"You turned a well designed car into a hot wheels car, good job."
Reminds me of Mass Effect.
I love it. I'm so tired of the same old vehicle shapes.
I like it too...
Love it! I don't even need a truck but after seeing it I placed the preorder on the spot.
"I like it a lot too, you can definitely see how it's influences played a big role. This thing will definitely stand out."
hahahahaha
Had a feeling it would be hideous. Guess i’ll wait for the f150 electric.
Hot garbage
I placed an order as well
"My feelings exactly, if I wanted a regular truck I’d get and F-150 or Silverado but I hate that design. This looks so much more different and the design already is warming to me. Need to see what it looks like with different colors etc."

Brilliant plan by Tesla no company will copy the cyber truck design!
"> Other companies are starting to build vehicles that look like theirs. 

who lol"
"> Other companies are starting to build vehicles that look like theirs.

Other companies have been making cars that look like Tesla S & 3 before Tesla was making them.

While their lines are nice, and arguably better in a somewhat subtle way, they're hardly revolutionary, at least on the exterior. They're selling well because they *don't* look that different."
Best comment so far. And Happy Cake Day!
Elon said people wouldn't like the design
Wym?
"I mean this is comparatively much larger than anything Apple has announced in a long time (which isn't a dig at Apple, it's just the nature of new product lines). It's also probably gonna be a very long time before we get another product launch this big from Tesla"
Well its a nightmare
"yeah, should have just stuck to the drop demo lol"
"yeah, i thought it was a joke at first too..  and even more so when the glass broke."
"Feel like we just watched The Homer Car from early Simpsons get revealed on stage. 

""How much is this monstrosity""? 

$69,000 for the tri-motor version..  this monstrosity is $69,000.  I'm ruined, completely ruined."
The only market for this car is the oil rich sheiks in the middle east and crazy billionaires like elon.
"Not for anyone who wants a pickup. $40k gets you a damn nice gently used top of the line gasser from any of the big three. Just bought one last year myself. 

I won't get strange looks when I pull up on the construction site either."
This is the most condemning comment in the thread.
I think azteks are cool now though
Finally someone made a vehicle uglier than the Aztec
The AzLorean
With a plug for your fusion blender
An ugly baby
"First attempt

This!
"Too right. This will upend the entire industry. It is 2020. Embrace cyber dystopia, god damnit!"
"\+1 I don't think this is good looking, but it's not really designed to. It's supposed to cause people to talk about it. But fuck if I don't feel some serious ""not too distant future"" sci-fi film vibes from this. Could totally see this blacked out as a cyberpunk cop car, lights flashing, cop ninjas jumping out at the scene of a riot.  


Not sure if that's a good or bad thing though...  


I just wonder if it's aerodynamic. If it is, then I can see it has function over form, and the sorta shit they've wanted to do from the start. Otherwise it's just different to be different, which isn't the best option in most cases."
Not final!!!..... They will need to make more changes to make it legal!!!
Or coffee.
"Dude, same here. I've been talking to my friends about this for months that don't ""get"" Tesla's. When it rolled out I jumped on our group chat saying it was a miss but now after the MotorTrend pictures and article and the test drive videos...it's growing on me too. Pre-order is in. I can change my mind later. The specs are unreal. Maybe I wrap it in black or something."

*truck
Looks like a 3 year old With a Crayon box is their chief of design
Aztek 2: Elon's Electric Boogaloo!
Tbh that’s most people with trucks
Agreed. It looks like low-poly model come to reality.
Then buy a car or a SUV. Don't encourage Tesla to make this shit.
I'm not sure I'm actually ready
I'm verklempt.
I'm unfathomably excited
Hell no! I took a day off tomorrow because I'm an old man and 10PM is too late for me!
thought i was going crazy
Did the time go back for you too?!?
Welcome to Elon Time.
Time travel option package confirmed.
Yeah. The problem is that nobody is going to buy it... Nobody would be caught dead driving it I think.
I still think the whike thing is a joke it cant be real
lol this is the same guy who gave us the Roadster 2.0 design. Then does this truck. Like what the heck.
"Made for high end people presidents etc probably idek if this is real tho. Because the price of this thing is looking like 300,000"
This is bad.
oh i hope
"I""m watching through the cracks of my fingers."
"Because it's Elon. Everything he does is like this. Everything feels awkward and cringe, but the tech behind the awkward presentation is usually impressive."
Good god that’s cheaper than my Model 3.
"Op is right, Elon smoke the bad shit"
It seems like every other presentation he's in the zone; this was not one of those presentations. IIRC one of the Model 3 ones it seemed like he should have had a cup of coffee before he got there.
He has said he'd come out with a second truck using more traditional stylings if this one fails.
"Not high. They could, but Elon doesn't like listening to feedback.

I can see the blog headlines now... Truck presentation massive failure.. Elon smashes truck glass.. Looks like a giant crooked kleenex box... Elon has gone senile/insane..."
"Doesn’t look good for his shareholders though, might be long con where people sell, and he buys it cheap and then the redesigned truck comes out"
Perfect I'm going to start pinching my pennies now
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcROXiN_cdE it should have the full recap now.

Edit: Video got made private sorry folks. This one works https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZbVixSkgu0"
Go to bed man. You'll hear all about it in the morning lol
It should be posted to their YouTube account after a while.
the ATV was eh IMO. I loved the truck though!
I think 99% of people are.
I’m more excited about literally anything other than the truck.
Yes lol and they forgot to tell us anything about it.
Apparently it was sapphire I think
That's why most people don't throw steel at it.
Ha! I wish he would have said that on stage.
As long as someone doesn't throw a metal ball at your window.
Don't need a crumple zone if you can simply drive through anything that gets in your way.
I was thinking more Total Recall
Looks more like a grade schooler drawing
>but came out looking like ~~Tron~~ Turd
I am sure it uses cameras instead.
I doubt it’s a production unit so probably just aren’t there
They would have said that in the demo.
You mean the tonneau cover?
I thought that about the ramp. Could park with the ramp unfolded to the south for maximum  exposure to the sun while camping and whatnot.
Can they just make it invisible to human sight?
That would be cool.
It's so ugly I wish it's invisible to human eyes.
yeah that thing looks super cool
I wish they were. I might’ve thought about buying that.
">aren't selling the ATV

yet.

they'll sell a lot of those."
"Good point. He tried to warn him. 

But then Hanz decided to double down lol"
They used two differently sized metal balls in the drop test on the glass. I feel like they probably tested throwing the smaller of the two at the windows but then someone accidentally handed Franz the bigger ball to throw at the truck
My guess is that they tested with the smaller metal ball but Franz actually picked up the big one.
Probably that they tested it a bunch of times.
"Maybe they weakened the glass when they hit the doors with the sledgehammer?

I mean, I’m sure they tested this many times before and it worked but perhaps never after first whacking the side with a sledgehammer like they did this time around."
I’m gonna guess that hitting the doors with a sledgehammer first weakened the glass.
Well now it will mean they have to make the glass even tougher for release.
"Either the glass on the vehicle isn't the same glass that was tested next to it, or the environment of the glass they tested next to it was too controlled. If you go back and watch the demonstration, the two assistants unclamp the glass to allow it to flex after impact, that allows the energy to dissipate through the flex, as opposed to cracking or breaking. Now think of the door, or any car door/window for that matter. The glass is essentially ""clamped"" by the frame of the door, not allowing it to flex, hence why it cracked. 

To those suggesting the size of the ball had anything to do with it, did you not see them drop the ball from what seemed like 4-5 meters? Velocity is a lot more important than mass in this case, because the difference in mass is likely not significant enough and at a 4-5 m drop the velocity of the ball is around 8.85-9.89 m/s, which I'm sure is way more than the velocity of the ball thrown at the car window, especially the second throw, I know I would hold back after the first one broke."
Duel motor? The entire truck is ready for duels
"Yeah, I don't love everything about the design but it seems great with regard to ground clearance, approach angle and off-road capability."
KILLDOZER!!

Why?? Looks glitchy as f
where can I find pictures?
I'm wondering if that was just a mock up or a tease. Please god be a tease.
"Rearview mirror is an lcd screen. Interior video:
https://youtu.be/WFTdDLiLYgk?t=1107"
In a test drive I heard a mention that you have a monitor showing the back camera instead of the regular mirror. At least I think I heard that.
In a video of a test ride it the driver states it's a camera so that you can see behind you even with the bed loaded.
"In soviet russia, cyber trucks drive you."
WTF I love Tesla now
I wouldn't be the least surprised if Tesla will bring out a derived rover design.
"Not if you are wearing a baulky breathing suit, this thing is just horrendous."
Needs to have steps that fold out from the side
There’s a large trailer for it on the Tesla website.
Trailer looks great! Well done...
unless they aim for the windows
Well that's exactly what he said it would look like. He wants it to be the go to vehicle on Mars.
It wont
"I'm conflicted. I always liked the DeLorean in a weird way, but I think the rear end looks god awful on this truck. I also was hoping for a sexy tesla truck... I'm just so sick of them making electric cars look goofy, you know?

It's not bad, but I'm honestly not excited for this truck anymore."
[deleted]
"I agree with this 100%.  This should have been the “other” truck after unveiling something more functional, first.  The market on this is ridiculously narrow.  I don’t get it."
That was my first reaction too. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I like it though!
“Do you guys not watch Bladerunner?”
"Fuck yeah

-Elon"
Complete with ATV.
So uhhhh like when do they make the next one
Seems like a miss.  Can’t imagine a 50yr old dude rolling around in one of these.
This is rather disappointing. I honestly expected something closer to the renders.
"Priced to compete with the mid-tier and premium F150 models, way faster and towing capacity of the F350. And you’re upset about the aesthetics?"
"I don't like the look of it, but for the money it's unlikely I'd buy any other truck. Well, except for the Rivian.

After tonight I see why Ford and Amazon invested in Rivian. I think Elon might be losing his mind."
It looks like a truck you'd see in a crappy PS1 game.
"Woah, nice find!"
Just noticed that too.
"Good catch, I just thought my monitor tore or something"
at least it didn't go through
I think Elon stumbled Elon
It was super thin..
Alright that camping set up looks pretty dope. Why did they show off that kind of stuff in the reveal?? How many more versions are there of the configuration?
"that camping render doesn't look right. Do you think theres going to be an option to ""lock"" the tailgate so its parallel to the ground?"
These are the two photos that caught my eye when looking at the website. No idea why you wouldn't include these in the presentation.
"Lol, that steering wheel is NOT going into prod. Nor is the lack of side mirrors."
Their cybertruck page is dead. Not sure why.
It looks like it’s made from cardboard by a third grader.
lol same
They got there $100 and can sit on it for years. That’s all they want
The truck page mentions the name Cyberquad. There will probably be more info to come in the future 🤷🏼‍♂️
>most likely going to be limited and not a mass production item
"Kinda sad the livestream cut off suddenly like that, don't know if that was supposed to happen."
Exactly what my wife said LOL. We were probably going to put a deposit down on the Truck until it was presented. Way too ugly for our tastes.
"Same, that thing looks SICK! 

I just really hope they don't only sell them in 1000-off quantity, sold out within minutes."
Most reasonable comment in this thread.
 But you can’t start taking preorders and dramatically change the design.
"you being serious? They'd have to change so much, maybe start from scratch"
Haha...came here to say this.
"So, 10-year-olds?"
"The submissions will just be everyone who posted a comment here posting it as a text post. It’s just going to be a flood of 

“HeRe’S mY tWo CenTS oN tHe CyBeRtRUCk”. 

It’ll be fucking annoying."

Another 2-3 years
"Ahh, the old Joe Biden slip up.

""I'm leaving the Cybertrk reveal now. I hope I made you proud out there and I hope I made it clear to the world why making boats now is so important."""
That's the category on the account. Are we sure it didn't say that previously?
"Business account category, not a user description (which is why it doesn't show on instagram.com)."
You’re kidding me?
Thats weird.  Thats actually the business category they picked for their facebook business page according to an article I just read about that tag.  Has it changed or was it always like that?
It really looks like a truck ripped out of a ps1 or original xbox game.
Tesla like Rivian isn't targeting you but hipsters who want to take this thing camping. Elon forgot the pain point of EVs which is ugly looks. By going against his S3XY ideology this will alienate his fan base.
I literally said out loud...WTF is that. Rivian it is!
Electric F150 coming soon
"They aren't targeting you, they are targetting cyber punks duh. Way bigger market"
"Is it purely looks for you? What else does your truck have that this doesn’t?
Asking honestly, not hostile"
The price is 10k less than people expected.
"Remember this is the first unveil when they don't bet the company on it.

Also I couldn't place an order for 10 min because the site is down with too many requests error. I think people are excited."
We good. They can only make 20-50k per year and they’ll definitely sell that many.
pass the fucking whiskey
buy more stock tomorrow then?
When that glass broke Elon heard the ice falling in your glass
I'll join you in that.
"Me too. It's a shock at first glance, but actually grows on you a bit with repeated viewings.

It REALLY did not help that the thing sat there with two broken windows for half the presentation, though."
Same here.
Join our panel of senior citizens as they decide which feature they hate the most.
enough people liked it to crash the preorder link
On the upside you won't care if it gets keyed and shit....
check check and check my friend - I don't think you're alone either
For sure. I never thought an uglier than the Pontiac Aztec could ever be made
"They can pop the champagne when even one of their cars is on the friggin road. Don’t underestimate Tesla. We’ve heard the same negative reactions from people after the S, X and to a lesser extent, the Model 3...and look how those have turned out."
Ford too. All we want is an F-150 with the Cybertank's specs.
"Cold-rolled steel body, not aluminum."
BuT iT DoEsNt LoOk LikE OthEr TrUcKs!
"Yes, that's my view. This strips away the artifice of the toughness of other trucks. They are terrible to drive, they get awful gas mileage, and they get banged / dented up. The fact that this is a ""real"" tool I think will be compelling. It would probably be more compelling if it had slightly more traditional styling, but for the price this thing is way better than the Rivian in terms of performance. I think it's remarkable. I could be wrong but I think it will do fine."
Stainless steel exoskeleton.
"The bed is useless, which is the primary purpose of a truck. It barely fit an ATV in there. I've frequently seen trucks with 2 ATVs in their bed. And as someone else mentioned, you can't easily reach over the side into the bed. It's like they've never actually used a truck before. The stats are amazing, but the bed and the looks are going to kill it."
I dont want aluminum... I hope your wrong.
"A base ‘19 3.5L f150 has a max tow of 13,500."
"Yeah too bad you aren't parking it in the garage. This thing is a joke. This isn't a real truck, it's a toy. If you want a real truck, buy a Ford - it's also going to be all electric."
"On a comparable F150 towing is 9000 to almost 12000, this thing is ugly and doesn't best ICE trucks for the price. Of course I'll be shit on for saying this but oh well."
It was just Grimes
Don't let them anywhere near the model S & X refresh/redesign.
I mean.... its Elon.
"This is the first real functional critique I've seen, that does seem like a valid problem."
😂
I kinda feel like the audience in that episode.
LOL
"What!? You're years away! You crazy, but enjoy. Looks badass."
Saying 5% is a massive stretch with a design this hideous
"Yea, agreed. We needed this to be ""accessible"" to those 1.5m buyers. Instead, it just alienates them. I really wanted to point to this and tell my truck-loving extended family that it's better than a regular truck in every way. And bust up the oil culture from the inside. That's not going to happen with this truck. :/"
"Elon said he doesn't really care if anyone orders it. They're going to build the radical design, and if orders suck, they'll make a conservative one for the following year. There is always a ramp anyway for the first year, so they can't sell that many in the first year even if there are a ton of orders."
I was really hoping for a electric truck in 5 years.  Guess I'll wait another 10
"Yes. The very first thing they said was trucks looked the same for a century. This is a new look. Can't say I love it, but they were not under the impression this would have mass appeal based on aesthetics. Its strong. Its fast. Its autonomous. It's cool in its own way."
"So they decided to make it ugly just because? That makes no sense, yes it performs well like other Teslas but this is not going to sell well."
What are the specs on the air compressor?
[deleted]
"Ford is coming out with an actual e-""truck"" around the same time this starts production if not before that.  I don't think anyone in America lives in a war zone in order to need that FMJ resistant exterior"
"> All the people that buy trucks for the love of trucks

They could have gone after those people without making it fugly. This thing is priced like it should be mass market, but visually designed like it's targeting a tiny niche."
Who buys a truck for function?
"It doesn't really pull much more than an F150.  12,000 is their max"
That's all great. But is should look good as well. This doesn't. The guess renders beat this by a mile. All edges and no curves.
"Of. All. The. Fan. Renders.

They could’ve just picked ANY of those."
yea im so surprised people made shitty fan based models based on the teaser and they were spot on. even this looks better https://electrek.co/2019/07/20/tesla-pickup-truck-blade-runner-design/

Needed to take another hit backstage
yes
It really looks like a joke.

The back will lift up I bet.
"This isn't even a truck

Just like the Y isn't really a SUV"
"It's like a high schooler who thought really hard about what he was going to say for his presentation, but didn't practice or write anything down. 

Lots of half thoughts, barely a full sentence."
OMG and they need a bed. Pickup trucks need a bed
I almost hope it's not. I'm dying laughing over here
What is? This truck is a beast
it hurts
It is terrible.  No one cars if it can pull an F150.
Lol dude has any car reveal smashed their own windows out in the history of car reveals
"No, that’s why I think he might still be joking."
Yep.
They’re always this awkward. The vehicles are typically MUCH more attractive though so it’s been worth it.
Not *that* awkward.
Yes
Yes
https://youtu.be/WPc-VEqBPHI
Grabs a lot more people who think they’ll be able to afford it come 2021/2022.
so they can brag tomorrow that they got 100000 suckers to put $100 on a doorstop with wheels
"That is standard for all Teslas [CURRENTLY IN PRODUCTION] now, but it's ~~usually~~ not refundable [FOR THE OTHER MODELS YOU CAN ORDER THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PRODUCTION].

Edited so I don’t get attacked by the pedantic “ackshully” autists of Reddit"
Reminds of something Top Gear guys would make
That's why the deposit is only $100.
I absolutely love it! If I needed a truck in my life this would be my choice. Why go with the same thing everyone has/does? (as long as the vehicle is actually good/safe/reliable of course)
The lighting did not do it any favors.
I suspect that the reveal is more indicative of what it will look like in person
I am thinking sabotaged
https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/09_Desktop.jpg
It's on their site. Normal seats but the dashboard has kind of a marble look.
it sits 6 people. (said on one of the slides)
"There are pics on the site. Some have shared the, here."
Have you ever seen a prototype car before? They never have mirrors
2023 Elon Time
Designed for Mars really
Robins has absolutely nothing on Tesla now lmaoo
"They might want to wait until the factory is running first, and then re-evaluate."
they can't. For and amazon have 5% shares in Vivian each. (I think. please someone correct me)
"I neither love it nor hate it.

What I need to know is can I replace my off road vehicle with this, and based on the presentation, I don't have the answer to that yet."
But mostly hate it
I think it's going to take a while for people to like it.
Think of all the problems you won't have.
That thing is an abomination
You hate it
Stainless steel tends to be pretty darn rust resistant.
Stainless Steel there wont bei any problems
"Assuming their use of ""30X stainless"" means 300 series stainless steel(s), then corrosion resistance will be very good."
VERY good question I have not seen yet
[https://www.hotrod.com/articles/tesla\_cybertruck\_800\_hp\_tows\_7500/?sm\_id=organic\_fb\_social\_HRN\_191121\_sf224283667&sf224283667=1&fbclid=IwAR2-u\_PVM9b2LnsBi0l-i8yS3-Rca5Xpg23twZmaKYUTaHPu99-VY1X6gF4](https://www.hotrod.com/articles/tesla_cybertruck_800_hp_tows_7500/?sm_id=organic_fb_social_HRN_191121_sf224283667&sf224283667=1&fbclid=IwAR2-u_PVM9b2LnsBi0l-i8yS3-Rca5Xpg23twZmaKYUTaHPu99-VY1X6gF4)
Stainless steel is advised as the metal of choice in maritime safety equipment due to how aluminum rusts. It's probably good to go.
"Stainless is pretty rust-resistant.

It's also harder and heavier than steel and unlikely to pass crash tests. Don't hold your breath, this thing is suspect as hell."
"Same, I want the ATV!"
True😂
I thought it looked like a truck that murdered a Lamborghini and is now wearing it Buffalo Bill style
Nuke the truck from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
"From what they’ve been saying all along, that was never the plan."
Marauder?

"I was thinking Bladerunner. Really has that Phillip K Dick vibe.

You have to wrap it I guess.
I think they should've did this in a really glossy black or white
Wrap it in matte black for the F117 look.
[deleted]
You mean Nintendo 64?
You definitely came up with that on your own.
Yeah! And with the windows I feel like they should be able to be smashed and opened. Most cars allow you to do this in case of emergencies
"A obvious question to ask, but also an obvious answer to give is that it would be safe. No way Tesla releases this without getting 5 stars on EuroNCap"
"Guarantee it will be safe, Tesla makes the safest car being sold right now. You can see there crash test videos on YouTube."
Not really
The steel folding etc makes sense for that.
Isn’t an unveiling literally a PR stunt? What else would it be?
The glass breaking was 100% planned. It got people talking for sure. Elon is too smart for that to be an accident.
"elon either knew the glass was gonna absorb the impact and break, or they got really lucky. because the alternative was the glass not breaking and a heavy ball of metal bouncing back into elon's face or hurting someone in the crowd.

knowing elon, i'm betting on this being a well rehearsed PR stunt."
"Thought the same thing when that ddue was like ""should we try the other one"""
Looks like a Puma to me
"No, a Warthog needs a large gun in the back! Just ask Sarge!"
Came here to say this. All well and good having the structure on the outside. What happens if you crash it - re the repair costs and if you hit some poor soul.
It's so ugly I kinda like it
Well said
"Fast back Utility Vehicle?

SSUV (Super Sport Utility Vehicle)?

UV (Utility Vehicle)?

UAV (Urban Assault Vehicle)?

I think you're correct, but I don't know what to call it..."
I’m hoping the stock tanks tomorrow so I can buy the shit out of that too and then wait for everyone's surprise when they announce the pre-order numbers. This thing is probably selling to people who don’t even typically buy trucks on top of people who buy trucks and like the utility it offers. It might not show up much on a construction site or in a fleet but at that price point I think it’s going to be super compelling to a lot of people.
"Yea but how many other truck owners share that sentiment? 

I have a hard time believing people in Middle America would buy this.  Huge fail."
An edgy truck for an edgy man
"If the goal is to convert current truck owners, this is a flop.  I don't mind futuristic concepts, but trucks are supposed to be designed for utility, and this isn't it."
"Do you need new tires or is the tread supposed to look like that?

Great looking bike btw!"

"He says in his biography he doesn’t have time to practice presentations, but agree this is worse than usual"
"He tells us what to expect and people expect more. That is the problem. lol  


He said the Y would be 20% (maybe 30% bigger than the 3)... weight, same idea. He was pretty much saying it's the 3 on steroids and it was. A lot of people saw it and were like, ""that's it"".   


Here he said, ""it's a CYBERPUNK trunk (not for everybody)"" and that it certainly is. I think it's cool but not sure he it would look in my driveway. Will be interesting to see what the market is."

"Nah, I'd rather have a raw & very imperfect presentation from someone who helped design the product from the beginning than some salesman trying to make things flashy"
How does a billionaire not have a speech writer. This actually hurt me to watch.
"The focus will be on the preorders, not what people who didn't pay attention to what Blade Runner inspired means. Plus the production version is not coming out until 2 years from now."
That is a very good point.
"I really hope so, I was so excited for this truck and after seeing the body and just general other flaws, I'm really disappointed and I don't want to let go of the last bit of hope I have for this amazing truck. I really really hope they change the body, just a few simple changes to make it not look like a $20 1950's scifi cardboard prop."
"Lmao. It will stay exactly the same, as it should. Tesla sees all the traditionalist dinosaurs like yourself as controversy generators, and nothing advertises a company more than controversy. 
Oh, and the thing about controversy, it's *disagreement*.
You don't like it, and many other people don't either. However, many people *do* like the CYBRTRK."
"That was my first thought too.  

If we aren’t being trolled, then it has to have been designed by people that have never owned or used a pickup in their entire life."
"With the window shattering and such, I think you may be right. I recon it's a cover up for something better"
God I hope... it's a steaming pile of stainless...
Well tastes are all personal. But to me it looks like it’s been designed by a child who only had a pencil and a ruler.

If that doesn't actually happen I am going to have a heart attack.
You mean the ATV ? :P
Still waiting
I’m hoping for the same.. no way that was it
It’s already done man
I mean they kind of shattered ...
This is his excuse tmr morn. “I missed the safety update from engineering-we can’t legally make the windows break proof.”
That’s an excellent point
"Think you're right, Tesla will definitely still be working on improving the glass between now and the actual product launch."
They just need to sell it with those metal balls in the glove compartment
"Yeah same. Was preparing for the worst, but I kinda dig it"
"Honestly, once I kind of got used to it, I didn’t hate it as much as when it first came out."
For the sake of my shares I'm glad someone does.

Fucking lol. Speed square.

We were so young and foolish
"It is my dream dystopian truck!

*Right after he fixes the windows."
When he said that I was blown away. I thought the whole point was to grab huge market share from the big 3. Wtf.  Who IS it for?
"I like it a lot too ! ... people always complain when things are new or different. 

Think about all the anger directed even towards simple things like the Model-3 not having an instrument cluster. And now ?"
that render looks awesome
">https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/d4tw20/concept\_design\_for\_tesla\_cyberpunk\_bladerunner/

Is that design inspired by a shopping cart?

Yet it still looks better than this thing."
That was my thought too. I thought they had only had a prototype on stage and that's why the glass broke too.
You’re missing the point - there is no “paint”.   It’s intended to be rugged.  The website keeps crashing so I get the sense that they’ll have adequate preorders.
It looks like the Pontiac Aztek...
There won’t be any paint. And the truck in the videos was the EXACT truck that was on stage lmao he said that.
Did you see the door handles bounce when Franz whacked it?
Until those who key Teslas start carrying heavy metal balls around for this occasion...
"Model S is still the most beautiful car on the road, to me. Model 3 looks amazing, though it has better angles than others. Model X is a good looking car with some weird angles, and sick falcon wing doors that were controversial when first released.

I still love tesla, even if this truck (which they said would be weird) looks weird. The success of Tesla hardly rests on the shoulders of the truck. Model 3 is more than enough to sustain, and further growth will rise on Model Y, slated for next year, while this truck has no release date.

I still love tesla, but this truck is probably not for me, at least. Here's hoping tk the success of Rivian. If only they could bring down their prices..."
I was gonna post this but you beat me to it.
Mad max will be real in like 10 years.
ya for the apocalypse im gonna want a truck with a remote kill switch owned by an eccentric billionaire for sure dude for sure.
what.
Also hail-proof
"They are \_great\_ features but if they are going to be selling this to consumers, they're asking a lot to have them overlook the design.

&#x200B;

My take is they talked to a bunch of truck owners and asked them ""what would you change about your truck?"", took all of the answers and put them into a computer model and took the first thing it spit out."
RIGHT?
nope
I wish it was...
You’re not wrong.
Raptor is pretty dope
wut
"> Does the 2020 F-150 inspire anyone? 

Apparently, yes because it's the best selling car in America."
It’s also weird that it didn’t have the Tesla logo on it. I’m so bamboozled.
They're taking pre orders though
"Most prototypes don’t have mirrors. 

They were going to give rides in it, so there’s going to be a visible interior."
"They're going to be giving attendees demo rides on the Cybertruck for hours tonight, there will probably be plenty of images of it from all angles."
They rarely have mirrors when showing off new cars. Makes it look better. Elon mentioned this during an interview one time (not sure which one)
"https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-price-features/

Some renders of the interior and it in action"
"Also:

"> Built in **wench** that could be quick swapped front or rear with remote control from your phone.

Now, there's a marketable concept."
">Built in wench that could be quick swapped front or rear

Let me know when you find one of these."
Is this satire? Or you just wanted a hyper specialized truck that would cost out the ass.
This guy trucks.
"Dang, those are some cool features, we'll see how much ends up getting changed/revealed in the following year I guess..."
Lose your night sight. Not loose. That means to make something less tight.
What were the stated cargo bed dimensions?
The bed cover rolled up? They put an ATV in the back...
"I was hoping for a mini version of the Tesla semi. The semi is different looking, sleek, and futuristic but not polygonal."
[deleted]
I like it. Function above all else. Looks like it's designed for a jobsite.
Because it's a fucking triangle
">he said it was going to look cyberpunk

Was expecting good cyberpunk, not bad cyberpunk"
Yeah how the hell are they going to fit 3 battery packs in there for that price.
"Yeah, the Cyberpunk like the role-playing game that came out in... 1988."
"""Why doesn't this cybertruck look more like the F-150!?!
And get me more photos of that nuisance Spider-Man!!"""
And perfect for Mars
Yea who tf drew this design up? Elon's youngest kid?
It’s a massive PR disaster.
I was hoping to see more of it's features and interior. Super cool truck though!
"You can definitely tell he is frazzled after the windows get broken, and it just goes like a snowball in hell from there."
"I can't see it being a genuine competitor in the pickup market like he wants it to be with that design. A different design is fine in itself, but that thing is just ugly, doesn't even fit Teslas own design philosophies at all. ATV looks nice though"
The windows shattered. People don’t want tanks.
Uh. It’s not a small truck.
"I had the same reaction. At first I was like ""WTF"" then I was like ""eh, it looks kinda cool.""

I'm SOOOO going to modify the design and post it here though. Teaching myself industrial design/concept art at the moment so this will be excellent for my perspective construction techniques.

Basically I'm going to make it a little bigger, give the passenger area some portion where it's flat topped and then make the rear slope less aggressive."
It’s larger than most trucks...
"If you're gonna build a future into a truck,  why not do it with some style?"
"your second point is what I was wondering


also just read the material isn't bendable which is why it's so angular"
Didn’t he say it has the same footprint as an F-150?
"Who needs crumple zones if you can never crash? 
But for real though, that will be an issue"
Stainless steel construction should be relatively cheap.
"I think F-150 had a huge relief from this. All they have to do is focus on making a nice and smooth presentation for an electric F-150 in the next year and they got it in the bag. 

This presentation was Elon's worst, he's gotta shake it off and learn from this.

Fortunately Tesla will still sell plenty of Model 3's and Y's to keep the company going. They should have prepared this event better."
"[https://imgur.com/a/Qdfw6xY](https://imgur.com/a/Qdfw6xY) (2 pics, both edited to be less pointy)

How's that?

Nope.. Doesn't really save it.."
"The back opens and it's like a normal truck, what are you talking about?"
The whole presentation felt like he just saw the truck for the first time about an hour before go time.
"My thoughts exactly. He almost forgot about the ATV and didn’t even go over pricing, specs or anything. Just weird!"
"> visibly upset over the glass.

That was standard automotive safety glass. It's legally required for all mass-produced street legal vehicles."
I think that was scripted.
They might have been on the windows :(
Yeah it's going to be easy to mix it up with other trucks.
Bc they put it together 5 min before
"Tesla logos are branding, this is self branded. Everyone is going to know what that car is when it hits the road. People who don't will be fishing to find out what car that is."
"Yeah, I agree. It's strange, especially since the foggy teaser image clearly had the Tesla logo above the front lights"
It’ll be an option +65$
When your car is a fucking badass cybertruck people already know what time it is.
"They have time to add one if they think it’s necessary. 
Everyone will know what this looks like. I don’t think a logo will be necessary."
That's what I want to see too. Assuming they didn't cancel due to the glass...
"Haven't been any test drives yet, they were swapping the broken glass. (Per Sean O'kane on Twitter)"
"Try this, some people just took off for a test ride.

"Initially i thought Space Invaders but felt that wasnt right, you nailed it!"
Yes includes a compressor and winch.
The compressor likely does not have near the capacity needed to run any tools unfortunately.
"Can you name the truck with four wheel drive, smells like a steak and seats thirty-five"
Its good to know I'm not the only one who pretends to 'space dock' with the online grocery pickup.
"I know where you are coming from, but I disagree. Elon explicitly mentioned how it is vital to create a pickup truck to make sustainable energy/vehicle a reality because top 3 selling vehicles are pickup trucks. So Tesla wants to compete against them.

I had similar thoughts earlier which I tried to capture here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e05151/is\_tesla\_saying\_failure\_is\_an\_option\_now\_it\_may/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e05151/is_tesla_saying_failure_is_an_option_now_it_may/)"
"Yes, this is the correct answer. From business school, you learn that the best thing to do is to create a new product category. Tesla would have the monopoly on the category of Mars Rover, and this new product would have been a very cool thing. Oh well."
Yeah I don't think it'll be the F-150 killer but I'm sure down the line they will design something that is more brand-able in that sense.
"I agree that branding is bad, but I disagree that this doesn't compete with a F-150. Looking past appearances, seems like the Cybertruck performs all of the same functions as the F-150, and more. I'm still on the fence about the design, but I'm certain that they will change things for the better before the production version rolls out."
"Model 3 launch was pretty freaking awesome, but agree the mystery of this is sweet. I hope it looks absolutely ridiculous futuristic."
Why does it want my email? :(
Holy crap you are so right.
"That's an amazing, underrated, untalked about album"
I'm expecting it to pull a trailer full of model y's and him to say they're actually employee cars and delivery starts now.

Gotta fix the glass in post.
"If they know what's good for them, they took down the livestream, built a time machine, stopped the live stream from ever happening, and then drove the prototype into a river."
"This is probably why. Also probably why the glasses are all flat. to make it easier to use the ballistic glass. 

In one slide it said transparent metal. that was just marketing BS right?"
There is absolutely nothing new about cold-rolled stainless steel.
I think you dont understand. This was not presented as a concept car. This is full production intent. Thats the body.
Will be very interesting to see how this evolves.
Is that bad?
They tightened them after every drop
It was clamped down. The bounce of the ball popped the clamps. Those two re-tightened the clamps after each drop.

I'm gonna guess the plan is to have a rear camera"
"ICE drivers would change for specs. Towing, Payload, accessibility, price, maybe acceleration for fun"
Why would a truck that looks more like normal trucks upset the EV market? The reason we like Tesla is because they don’t try to look INSANELY different. They just make clean good looking designs that are efficient. Making it look different intentionally is what Tesla people HATE. Thats what ugly ass cars like the Prius did.
"Yeah. Pretty much how I feel. It’s a bold design, but the market for this strikes me as wealthy city people who want a weird third or forth vehicle. I can’t really see it making even a minor dent in the work-truck market. 

But maybe also some buyers who want in on the EV market at $40k. 

I think the lack of rear visibility will turn off a lot of buyers. People who want a “vault” can buy a solid bed cover or bed boxes and still have rear glass."
"They made the video private, and the videos available online were quickly taken down (likely copyright claims by Tesla)"

Electric car + decent seal = tesla S as a temporary boat. 

&#x200B;

Tho, with a heavier truck, you might be piloting more of a sub than a boat, but I'd bet it's more ""amphibious"" than any other off-roader on the market."
If you drive an EV into standing water you deserve what happens...
It’s mean there’s no side mirrors even so I’d say that’s a pretty good assumption.
"I'm guessing mirrors, potentially handles will not be self presenting etc. The main bones of the truck won't be different unless the preorders don't go to plan."
I think this was the underrated star of the show.
I saw someone reference Tomb Raider. Both work in this case
"Really good point. It's like chess, sometimes locking everything out is really just locking yourself in. Wouldn't want to flip and catch fire in a car that EMS can't breach."
"Wait, what happened? Did'nt have time to watch the event yet."
"Damn you're right, those safety hammers exist for a reason. If the door is jammed, or you are upside down, you can at least crawl/break through the window."
omg this is a horrifying thought
"On the contrary, car crashes are about a billion times more frequent than getting trapped underwater, and you do NOT want a shattered window in a crash."
"Good question, actually."
"Out of curiosity, I want to see this thing in a crash test. I wonder about the safety of a stainless body and bullet proof windows. I’m sure Tesla has thought about that but I’m still curious."
Came here to say this. Stainless steel and all. Tesla has Jumped the Shark.
Exactly my first thought
"I mean... technically it didn't go through. 

Bulletproof glass breaks and cracks too. But it stops the bullet as it does. 

https://youtu.be/J8i5d5toEDk"
This one crumples the *other* car
Crumpling safely dissipates energy instead of transferring the energy to the occupants. Less energy transferred to the occupants = less severe injury
Most cars yes. But if you want to offraod you want something solid that won't warp when put under stress.
"Hey I like DeLoreans, thats a low blow"
yeah bitch!
i cant wait to see the nuts hanging off the back
"My initial thought too, they should’ve called it a puma. Or chupacabra."
Many people at the event have reported that they threw the metal ball at the windows 50-something odd times before the demo and it didn't break. That is why it was such a shock when it did.
Can regular sheet metal resist being hit by a sledgehammer?
Ok boomer
"Honestly that is the most plausible explanation

I mean this design is an economical suicide for Tesla, it's never gonna sell"
"I suspect this design will quickly grown on people. I thought it was hideous last night... Looked at it again this morning, and now I dig it. 

I am disappointed that the form factor isn't more groundbreaking. The Rivian looks more like a regular pickup truck, yet seems to provide more utility, and probably better visibility. I was hoping the Tesla truck would be more creative in terms of storage/cargo. Instead it has a traditional bed. Bummer."
Not what I was expecting and it is shocking. Will the be the next Aztek? Time will tell.
"I think it's fine, and I think the echo chamber in here might be responsible for some of the reactions.    Some folks just want to jump on the hate bandwagon.   Remember the reaction to the Model 3 front?

If I needed a pickup I guess I'd consider it, but I'd be worried about _treating_ it like a pickup.   How well will the stainless remain stainless after getting beat-up?   Stainless appliances in my kitchen look like shit after a few years."
"Ordered as well.  Lot of people here that weren’t expecting this, but anyone who’s been paying attention shouldn’t be surprised.  I think it looks great, but there are also going to be plenty of people convinced by the utility and price.  Regardless of how any other truck looks, this will outperform them all and is actually tough.

Hate that the demo went poorly, though."
Same
"I'm not a truck guy but I'm also disappointed cause I love tesla car design. 

In the end I think that this is the cybertruck... And he wants to sell this futuristic idea, but it's definitely not for everyone. It looks like mad max.

Just weird to me.

We have to wait for a normal truck I guess lol"
For real. Just when Tesla was starting to get respected in the industry.
"Seriously. I was expecting that they would do the same thing as they did with the Semi, but this looks like an alternate design by [Bollinger](https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/DHsm9Jq1LjNH58I03S3JHVQPucA=/1092x0/2018/10/11/7b3d5d8f-26cd-4c27-9cbf-96dd97bdf278/b1-1-full-res.jpg)"
It’s as if it’s a utility vehicle with zero compromises for the sake of utility.
Looks cool to me.
That OEM bed lighting is dope. Hopefully more rugged than a Fronz-tossed window...
"It’s absolutely good, but I hope the body can be modernized and refined more."
Tesla fanboys coming out and will defend anything LMAO
"Rivian has all of those things and doesn't look like a door wedge.

Hard pass."
this is like when you're the slow kid in class and the teacher tells your parents how nice you are.

"all correct, if it was not so ugly it might actually be good for them."
"Yeah, I started with ""WTF"" and by the end I was like ""This thing is cool as shit."" 

My wife isn't a fan, so I guess we'll see."
I laughed at the start and by the end it grew on me. Going to sleep on it and decide tomorrow
"No, what'll happen is that other companies will make better looking trucks and people will buy those instead"
Yea everyone hates it but I think it looks pretty cool except the back could use some work
"Nope, totes with you.  I’m amazed.  Can’t wait"
"I know right, this thing is cool as fuck.  I will GLADLY take a stainless steel post-apocalyptic beefhammer of a truck.  It feels like something straight out of a cool 80's dystopian sci-fi movie... and I get to buy it for 40k?  Fuck yes."
"Yeah, I kind of love this. Along with the specs, I find myself wanting a truck for the first time ever.   


But I also adore everything about Blade Runner"
I think it looks awesome too but I don’t want a truck and it seems like a big assumption that people who need a truck will want this...
I'm with you on how it looks.  It is definitely unique and an eye grabber on the road.  Easy to spot too in parking lots.  No color options as of yet though.
"They obviously looked at the old Hard Drivin’ arcade game for inspiration. 


https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0lLI28PfyZU/hqdefault.jpg

It’s been 30 years, though - they could’ve at least added a texture map."
"They thought it was a trap to catch them leaking

And they got the obviously fake one"
oh this should be upvoted to the top
Or they all thought it was a fake version so didn’t leak it.
"It's the same for me. When it came out, my heart stopped in a bad way, but as I look at it more, it's actually fucking cool looking lol, and I don't think the angles they gave it on stage were that great, or maybe the lighting, I dunno. I wish the bed was bigger though."
Same! Idk why but it’s getting better every minute
Growing on me as well. Starting to like it after looking at it for a while.
I know right. Had to take 11 different looks and slowly but surely i'm starting to understand it.
They need to do away with the angled panels on the sides of the bed. They serve no function and actually inhibit the functionality. My main issue
"Its tight man, I can already see myself in this thing lol"
Just look at it from behind...ugh.
"Right?! 

Once I saw the side by side of the cyber truck and the old school halo warthog, I was sold."
Yep. Average joes will scoff and then it will become a status symbol and then the Average Joe will NEED one.
That's exactly what I've been thinking. It will become iconic.
so no one who actually needs a truck
still not the play.
I really hope so
Good for you!  Here’s your cookie 🍪
Wow very original joke
... do the other one.
"LOL, he did, didn't he?  Forgot he let that loose.  So much for bible belt sales, I guess.  Gosh durn 'lectric satan wedge."
If I remember correctly Elon already stated that they would make a more conventional truck later.
The best sales point would be if they sold the skateboard and let aftermarket people add their own body design.
Roll over?? It's potential is pretty much zero
[Camper](https://i.imgur.com/OHqYlN7.png)
https://i.imgur.com/S0FN0Cx.png
"Yeah, I was expecting more on all this."
"Safety and roll over potential are non-worries.

Electric vehicles will always be better in that regard because of the extra crumple zones in front, and all the weight of the batteries being in the bottom."
">Can it do a camper?

Yes https://i.imgur.com/OHqYlN7.png"
He showed the ranges with 3500lbs towing
"1) I bet it can do a rack. But it'll be like the Model 3 where there is a low weight limit of like 150lbs. 

2) Yes they have the image on the design page.

3) hopefully

4) Range towing will be 2/3rd to Half depending on the load

????"
I wonder how safety testing works with so significantly adjustable suspensions
Yeah no safety talk... Very unlike Tesla. That's usually priority#1
The doors could withstand a bullet. Nobody mentioned the windows.
"Blasphemy to call Franz an ""assistant""."
"That sentence is fucked up. “He said it could withstand a bullet, but when an assistant lobbed a metal ball through the window it immediately cracked”

1. It can withstand a bullet.
2. Why are they comparing the bullet part to the glass part?"
"hah, diversion!"
Franz. An assistant”. Lolz
"Franz is an “assistant”
Lolz"
"Funny thing about ""bulletproof glass""- they would also crack if you pull this kind of stunt."
"Mm no. 

Trucks are not becoming trapezoids. This is not just a case of being ahead of its time, it's a hard left at any semblance of acceptable car design."
And when does this thing hits the road? He didn't talk about the timeline at all.
"I appreciate what you said about the looks of the truck. I get frustrated when people’s initial reaction is to shit on a design that is different than what they’re used to. I also had the initial reaction of wtf, but I love that they’re trying something new - I hope it works out otherwise other car manufacturers will use it as a case study for why they should keep making VW Golf looking cars. 

Also, I think part of the reason for the super straight lines is due to the material of the truck. They took a sledge hammer to it and didn’t make a dent. If there’s functionality behind why it’s so straight, that makes it even easier for me to get behind."
"Nailed it. I live out here in C.A as well and have similar hobbies. This truck is the perfect adventure vehicle especially if you like off-roading, camping or have dirtbikes/ATVs. I also love the retractable (is it?) bed cover. I know they will change a few things about it but overall this is what I want. I don't want them to design something similar to what we have out on the market right now. Then it would just be another truck but with a Tesla badge on it."
"I don't understand two things.

1. Why is the cargo space intentionally limited? If the back were not angled but horizontal to the floor, wouldn't it give much more space?
2. Why the weird steering-wheel? When you drive long distance wouldn't this be particularly inconvenient? Conventional wisdom isn't always a bad thing; why fix what's not broken?"
Well the good news is that ugly is easy to fix.
I think we'll get used to it pretty quickly..
oh nooooooo :(
I'm waiting for the punchline lol
Someone is getting fired.
Hey! The homer  was better at least it was a functional car

"They look pedestrian and derivative. Granted this thing is Uber-weird, but the price point was $10k better than I was expecting."
"The window smashing was what I expected. They should've not done it, but it did its job.

Armored glass still chips if you hammer away at it- but it doesn't easily allow penetration. Compare this ""fuckup"" to throwing a weighted metal ball through normal automotive safety glass, and you'd have pieces of glass everywhere, and a ball breaking shit inside the cabin (like the center screen)."
Model Y and Europe gigafactories gonna take priority by far
Cool with me. That’s when I’m gonna be ready for a new truck.
A year longer than I thought it would be.
So 2023 is when I'll get mine if I'm lucky. Fuck that.
On an N64
"I think its just a case of ""stop through bearings at it.""  Just a stupid demo."
I will draw you a better looking truck for only $200.00.
And let you put a fuckin roof rack on it.
Agreed. It has to play into structural rigidity or something.
I'm wondering if a KC light bar on the roof just in front of the high point of the roof would help smooth out the sharp angle?
Don’t worry I got you covered on color changes.
At least wrapping those big flat panels with be super easy.
I think it’s awesome! Was disappointed by all the hate.

a couple people over here drew something very very similar to this some weeks ago
Right.. I want that!!!
I'm still in shock.
you must be joking
"They should buy the brand from GM. Pontiac, by Tesla."
"It's definitely high-concept pickup truck.

And it makes me think, which is a great sign. We love seeing outlandish, furutistic designs in our science fiction, in our futuristic art — and this pickup actually takes a meaningful step in moving that direction and providing features that fit it as some sort of retrofit to the design.

For that alone, even if I'm more a Roadster guy than a Cybertruck guy, I kind of love it."
I love it
"Imagine your housing contractor rolling up in this.

Oh wait, you can't. It's not going to appeal to Joe Sixpack in the slightest because he's not going to get laughed at by his coworkers for the rest of his life for rolling up in this algebra textbook clipart."
"Sorry dude, you're wrong"
Light strip across the entire front under the frunk
And light straight across the top.
"The Model 3 unveiling was just them circling around it with a camera, then saying ""OK THANKS BYE"""
"Shitshow is an understatement, especially considering it is an amazing truck with fantastic specs at shocking price"
100%.  WTF were they thinking?  This is going to be an embarrassing mark on the company.
Can't think of when they have shown the interior at one of these things. Wait for the ride videos to hit YouTube.
The cars in blade runner look more like cars. And they could fly
"Well he didn't lie, but I've been a huge part of the truck community and trust me this will not sell well with them / us. I love Musk still but damn, he didn't consult with anyone in the truck game to find out what could be improved upon? Air suspension? In the RAM. 14k lbs? Ok but for how far a distance? They pulled that f150 while it was in 2wd not 4wd like the Cybertruck (this is always a joke of a test anyway but come on, every truck guy is going to call this out as fancy exec marketing bs and yet the fan boys in the crowd went nuts... CRINGE). I can see this catching on with city boys who want to be edgy and forward thinking but I feel like it's gonna be douche bags driving these. I was shocked by the design...but it's not even aesthetic from a design perspective. Again still love Elon but this is the first time I'm saying this, it will fail to take much of the truck market, it's geared towards some pretty specific type of men and I wish it was a bit more appealing to the rest of us. You had the opportunity to steal huge numbers from the existing truck segment and you missed the ball 😞"
"Me too, like cool 4-wheeler, Elon...it looks like all the rest of them, unlike your truck which wholly broke the Tesla mold. That thing is ugly as sin. I can’t think of a single red voting Chevy/GMC/Dodge/Ford owner that would buy one of these, even for less than they pay for their bank busting Sierra. It’ll never happen."
I totally thought this was a first prototype too and they were gonna roll out the production model.
"The way the undercarriage was sealed and the wheels were sealed and the bed was sealed, I thought the truck would for sure be submergible."
I was just sure of it.
I thought it was maybe a joke at first....
"No, he said ""Oh my fucking god"""
Did he really?
omg I just was like wtf are they doing! are they for real. i thought they were going to be at the end of the demo- be like now here is the real truck!
Truck sales are from contracts. Government contracts and civilian corporate contracts. The numbers are really skewed because of it. I've never seen figures on private owner purchases for trucks.
I drive a 11mpg truck and was fully prepared to buy this Tesla Truck until I saw what it looked like.
The hardcore truck nuts weren't going to change anyways. Future truck buyers will definitely consider the Cybertruck.
"The hardcore diesel truck guys wouldn't give a damn if the tri-motor cost $20k and had 1000mi of range because their personalities are built around rolling the biggest clouds of coal.

This truck isn't for those people. I could see it being a  huge hit for contractors, people who tow trailers, dictators in 3rd world countries, people who like to go camping, law enforcement, and light duty truck fleet sales."
"Wait, you mean we’re going back to 1984?"
"ENJOY BRO. To think, the little one will think all of this is 'normal' one day."
"Same boat brother! Let’s
Do this"
"Way past cutoff time lol, I love it

Stay strong"
"little dude is sleeping here, prob gonna start stirring at 8:03PST"
Just open the door and roll down the windows.
"I feel like this was a spontaneous idea of Elon, because hey, it's unbreakable."
"As awkward as Gates was, he made a joke and recovered.  Elon, not so much."
I agree
The truck demographic will be pissed they can't key this car
"They're not even starting production till late 2021, late 2022 for the tri-motor model"
"oh shit, memories i didn't know i had"
Be over 6' you leprachaun.
"Lower the truck, climb in it, use the ramp, jump, etc"
That's my biggest complaint with this. It has first gen Honda Ridgeline syndrome.
Adaptive suspension. The truck can go low to the ground. Looks crazy af
I put a rack on my trucks to haul material... Not sure how that would work.
"Like 60% of the time you're loading stuff from the back. But occasionally, people like to throw shit over from the sides - lunch pails, tools, etc. So yea kinda of a dumb design."
People with trucks greatly appreciate being able to reach over and grab items out of the bed. The tailgate also looked like a hundred pounds. They didn’t show the bed that much because they knew it was a shortcoming
"Agreed on wanting to see more about the bed.  Also interior.

Seems to have crazy value and functionality.  Not sure on the look yet but it's still compelling to me."
"If you are loading something heavy it can be nice to do it from the side. Like, buy a new washer or dryer, fridge or maybe a large cube of lead. 
Folding the side down would give it the advantage of a flatbed truck. 
This means you can drive the forklift and pallet right to the side, place it exactly where you want it and then tie it down there. Conventional truck you have to now push it yourself to the front of the bed. 

It's definitely a handy thing, assuming you are using the bed to haul things ever."
"There are other trucks that have small obstructions to the bed from the side (the older Honda Ridgeline and I believe the Chevy avalanche at one point) but I feel like that was a mistake and they have moved away from that. It's definitely an issue, and it's not surprising that they didn't include much information about the bed. They did mention that it has a 6.5' bed, but many trucks offer an 8' bed."
The Honda Ridgeline and the Escalade truck have similar issues.  The tailgate ramp probably offsets the side approach issue.  It's also not too high for most drivers.
"I'm torn on it. I've had to use pickups for work quite a bit, and while access from the side is nice, it's not entirely necessary... All the time. There are times when it's super handy, especially while tying down awkwardly large loads."
It's the worst thing about the 2007 era honda ridgelines which this totally reminds me of and something I dislike about lifted pickups. I find it extremely use to be able to reach over to grab stuff or climb over the sides in a work situation.
"From personal use, yes that design makes using the bed a huge pain the the ass. For example, how do you get to an object that has rolled to the front of the bed? You can’t go over the side so you have to step into or crawl into the bed to reach it. It’s inconvenient at best. For a few items it’s doable, but every day for the entirety of you owning the vehicle, huge pain. Just my thoughts from personal experience!"
">How important is it to be able to access the bed from the sides?

It can be easier to load wood, pipes, or other long stuff that will be propped on the tailgate as well as grab stuff that can be easily picked up like buckets rather than Lowe the tailgate and climb in. The compartments on the edge is also very useful because you can store tools, camping supplies, emergency supplies, and anything of value without worrying about someone stealing it or it bouncing around the bed.

>Is the unusual shape of the cybertruck bed with the tall angled side panels going to be a problem?

You can stand on the tire. Have to go back and get a good look at the side but like any truck you can just use the tire as a makeshift ladder, it won't hurt anything. Plenty of people lift their trucks so this is a tried and true method. Elon also mentioned the suspension was adjustable so the owner might can just lower the bed if it's too high for some reason."
"To anyone who actually uses a truck, it's very important. It's very telling that he spent basically no time discussing the bed. It appears to be an afterthought. This seems to be a situation where they were so focused on being different that they lost sight of what they were actually building. The semi-snarky approach of showing how trucks haven't changed in 100 years came off as a mis-step. Yes, trucks have largely gone unchanged... Wonder why, Elon? Perhaps function over form? 

As an owner of a fuel thirsty diesel dually, I was pulling for Tesla on this one. His opening statements were correct. We need a good electric truck if we are ever going to break away from fossil fuels. This thing is not it. This will sell to devotees who think outrunning a Porsche is a cool thing for a ""truck"" to do. Unfortunately, his vehicle will never fly with those who need a truck to be functional."
It's really important. The bed is the heart of a truck and its most important feature. They totally blew it on that. No camper. But the roll out ramp was pretty cool.
I have a tacoma and constantly reach from the sides.
Source on him saying they are making a mainstream one later?
I was wondering if they'd forgotten all about crumple zones and crash protection but I guess it's going to have to be tested and get a rating at some point.
You think it’ll just bounce off the testing equipment? That’d be fucking funny
"Perhaps might not want to be inside it either if there's too much ultra-strong steel for proper crumpling. Early vehicles made of solid steel survived accidents well, but their squishy occupants tended to fare less well."
there is reason cars have a crumple zone and are meant to have shatterable glass. Have glass be almost indestructible is more dangerous- it can displace and puncture passengers with collisions. also a heavy and thick stainless exterior weighs down the car and sacrifices range. There is a reason why their other cars dont need this exterior bullet proof material. most users dont care for this. they aren't going to be shot at. most drivers want a longer lasting battery pack with better range.
You should be a designer for Tesla.
"That would seem fairly obvious to you and I, but what do we know about truck design..."
I'm guessing aero
"yeah, looks like a relic from the late 80's :("
he never was a good presenter. he always stuttered and partially forgot stuff
"Yeah, it looks fucking awful."
It's the epitome of bad design.
"I like the idea of a electric vehicle that will get me into the mountains 4wheeling camping etc. but the design may be just a too over the top for many.  

In terms of suspension it sounds like what Land Rover has been doing for years.  Even back to the lr3, the air suspension would drop at highway speed and to load bags in the back and auto level with trailers hooked up. Off road it would raise and  even push air into individual air bags of the  wheels that needed a little extra help staying  in  contact with ground."
"Which makes it a totally not Aztek design.

Everyone hated the Aztec, it was awful. This is... you can still hate this. It's so easy to see the hate. But at the same time, yeah it does look like it's straight out of some sci-fi movie or game. Which kinda makes you like it at the same time? I mean... fuck. What?"
I don't think that it's polarizing. Most would agree that it's ugly.
You're from Germany by any chance?
I spy a German? :-)
The issue is it felt as if Elon was taking the piss and was about the unveil the real truck during the whole presentation....
...would you order one for me? I will pay you back...never :(
lol no way you're serious that thing is ugly
Dystopian? You mean fucking shit? It looks like the car i have been drawing when i was 5.
It's the same concept as making your FPS character look goofy as hell because you're in first person and will never see it.
"Elons version of ""The Homer""!"
Or my 8yr old.
"Yeah thought it was an outer shell just for laughs, but nope truly was blade runner"
"Agreed!  

All the beautiful concept sketches that auto designers do in school and then at their first job as a designer slowly get bashed out of them when the company waters the design down till it looks like every other car out on the road.   There's no watering down here!  It's about f'n time!"
Congrats on your tastes not changing since middle school I guess.
This is the comment of the evening.
Something tells me sentry mode will be a bit more intimidating in this thing!
Do you think it comes with spider-mans instant kill?
"Remember that scene from Dark Knight when the Batmobile wedged underneath a car or two?  Yeah, I want this."
Roads? Where we’re going we don’t need roads...

Already started.  This is a celebration!

Thank you. I can play it directly on my Apple TV now 😊
It has a 6.5 foot bed...
Yeah I'm confused about what's going on back there
It has a bed. Just watch. It was mentioned on the screen
What if the truck bed is inside us all along?
I think the ship has sailed
It looks like a turd
The 90's Next Generation Shuttle. Yuck
How are you still watching it? I had turn it off when he was talking about shooting it.
"He’s fucking rattled, more so than usual"
"Yeah, I drew better trucks when I was a child, and I sucked at drawing."
Change your perspective. It's a beast that looks like a beast.
Probably after battery day
Yeah. No kidding. And for only $70k.
No side mirrors either
Can you access it? It’s not loading for me
[https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck)
Heads will definitely turn in the opposite direction
"Or, someone threw a silver ball at the ""unbreakable"" server..."
"ahahaha, it does look like the mako, doesn't it?"
Probably never tested it on the actual truck. Or the sledge hammer before
"My guess was that for full impact resistance the windows need to be completely closed, seated into the trim all the way around. (You can see them readjusting the clamps after each impact on the drop test). When the passengers got out after driving it onto the stage maybe the windows didn't close all the way? (I don't remember if there's doorframes or if it's like the S/3 where the glass retracts a little, then the door opens)."
My bet will be wrong glass.
Same.
"All Tesla’s, not just the truck, now have a $100 non-refundable order fee. The order fees on previous cars were higher but they were refundable."
All of the vehicles only require 100$ now so..
I'm having a really hard time believing this is real and that $100 deposit isn't helping
They switched from $1000 refundable to $100 non refundable
They changed the reservation hold from a refundable $2500 to a non-refundable $100 reservation so it could be more affordable to the everyday person.
The front center seat is a little jump-seatish.
Those look far better IMO.
You're the 2020 version of a Hummer full of gas and useless
"Not well, he broke out the windows"
"I imagine a lot of people are googling ""how to short a stock"" right about now."
sell lol
You should be able to just rub it out with some steel wool I would imagine
"No, aftermarket wraps only"
"Isn't the 14,000 lb towing capacity more in line with an F250?"
The center seat appears to fold down for cupholders / armrest.
Battery life is the current issue with towing. That 500 mile range towing even 7k lbs is going drop down to around 150 miles.
Cybertruck: Minecraft Edition ?
I got a screenshot of mine but no email. I’m sure it will come in the morning when there site load eases up
"Same, I submitted two reservations with two different cards. Both transactions went through, but no confirmation information."
"You know, yea, people can say how terrible it it but at least it ain’t Rivian lights."
https://youtu.be/SwvDOdBHYBw
"
So that means I will or won't get the kick-ass looking Robocop  car?"
Is that because flat pieces are easier to assemble/produce?
"I also own a duramax Colorado. Told my wife yesterday that it has been the best vehicle I’ve ever owned.

However, I am 100 percent going to check this out in person and buy it if it does everything I need to do better than my duramax."
Not with those sails
[Here](https://youtu.be/gEwtrXGOW_o?t=33760).
Live feed wasn’t choppy for me at all. iPhone 11 pro max on Chrome
300k on an airport tarmac more likely. This seems more like a fancy 3/4 ton crew cab with a shortish bed.
"Don't worry mate, none of these will ever see a ladder or timber onboard. The design is next to useless for any serious work..."
I thought so too! You should definitely do something like that
That would block the rear deck cover.
[deleted]
The saved money by keeping the polygon count low
Ease of manufacturing. No paint line to deal with and they’re bending large panels instead of stamping them.
It's 2 years away so battery tech is probably becoming cheaper with over head already paid for mostly.... I'm guessing
"By the time is comes out, production costs will likely have come down considerably. Also, perhaps they're banking on self-subsidizing it with the rest of the S3XYR line-up?"
Stainless exoskeleton made of mostly flat panels.
Theyre selling them at a loss probably.
God I miss Bush.
"Some people have mentioned that the slopes on either side of the bed will make side loading a bit of a pain, but there are several other truck models with similar issues, just not to the same extent. 

Otherwise, it seems functionally well designed. Most people I know load from the back anyway, and I live in Texas. I know A LOT of people with trucks."
The high bed walls do reduce the usable space on the bed. In a typical truck you can place stuff that goes over your bed wall. One example I see a lot is the [bed toolbox like this one](https://carpassionate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/best-truck-tool-boxes.jpg). I don't think that would work in the cybertruvk
He used the spares from the starship
Probably or it's possible a large motor for two backs and singles ( smaller/lighter) for the fronts.
"Yup, that's the plaid powertrain arrangement this appears to use."
Did you find the video? It's hilarious.
"Not bulletproof glass, ballproof glass. The ball didn’t go through, it just cracked the glass and bounced off."
With a metal ball evidently.. ;-)
"Ah, the ultimate question. We don’t know if using the jaws of life on this vehicle will result in jaws of strife…"
same way they do now.. jaws of life
"> Or do you never crash?

That's right, you dont. It's the future, baby!"
Nah. The truck uses it's perfected pedestrian avoidance system to make sure that can never happen. Remember it's the future.
people who live in the bay area will appreciate those things
Yeah that's some weird focus. That must add a lot of mass for something most people will never need. And you really want electric car to be as light as possible.
"It was my understanding that people who buy trucks are either using the truck bed regularly for things that you could easily accidentally dent something, like construction. Or they have the delusion that they might use it regularly for these things. I can see the usefulness of dent protection if you actually use it at construction sites."
"For off roading the strong paintless body panels would be really nice. I always buy used trucks with a few dents in them because I know I'm going to dent them more. Even just cruising random Forest Service and BLM roads that are heavily grown in by alder brush and trees leaves ""Montana Pin Stripes"" on your paint. This thing would never get scratched and if the stainless grade is high enough it wouldn't rust either.    
    
On another note the active suspension and relatively tiny overhangs make this even more exciting for the offroad market. I'm really curious to find out what the weight is, if it's diesel truck heavy that will be a few points off when it comes to actual offroading but won't matter for USFS roads."
Well considering cyberpunk often depicts a dystopian future rather than a good one I think it fits in with a cyberpunk aesthetic.
This sucker's electric
Truly horrifying.
"That was my exact thought after seeing the reveal. My mind goes back to a YouTube video showing the hard thick ""tough"" old cars of days past vs modern vehicles with safety systems and crumple zones. Not saying this is that primative but I'm curious to see how it fares in a crash test. I'm sure the engineers thought of those things during the design but I'm still curious."
"It would absolutely dent and bend in an accident, the forces of a car accident are exponentially higher than someone hitting it with a sledge hammer."
The website says the glass is designed to act as the crumple zone and absorb the impact energy.
So glad I'm not the only one who remembers this catastrophe.
No regular consumer. Just the special ones.
"Yea it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out because it does seem radically more rugged, useful, and cost effective"
"Ah yes, the Honda Ridgeline Syndrome"
He didn’t mention any practical aspects of using the bed which seems to me that it was an afterthought. I mean getting the ATV was literally an afterthought during the presentation.
It's not practical except for a few use cases.
I think the idea is to put smaller stuff in the two side panels that fold up and/or the frunk so that you don’t ever have to reach into the main bed from the side like current trucks...
"That's a good point. Climb all the way in, I guess. Not ideal for how I currently use my truck."
I think the whole presentation was an accident. I died.
That goes both ways. Crumple zones are there to protect both vehicles passengers. The people inside this truck are going to be stopping WAY more abruptly than in a normal vehicle designed to crumple.
"80s movies = Future

Future = Now

Therefore,

80s movies = Now"
Also seems like the angular stuff would be really bad for drag coefficient.

imagine using cybertruck sentry mode to catch a video of someone trying to key it
https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/11_Desktop_Video.mp4
Man people are fast.
"Lol, agreed this is ugliest car I have ever seen... Not good for Tesla at all IMO."
Isn’t designing the look of the car supposed to be easier the creating technology behind the vehicle anyways?
I'm glad I'm not the only one who saw the similarities.
Have a Tacoma I’ll be handing down to my son in five years. Was 100% sure this is what I’d be getting. No way in hell that’s happening unless the production version looks materially different. That Rivian looks pretty nice and has great numbers though.
"2011 F-150 XLT Crewcab Owner here..just put my money down, will be selling my truck  after getting this incredible machine.  No more oil changes, spark plugs, coils, gaskets, coolant changes.."
"I really like it. I own a 2017 Silvarado z71 and I just dropped the hundo on the pre-order. I may not get rid of my actual truck, but this is like a mix between a delorean and H2. I like it."
"Like Elon said, every other truck looks basically the exact same, haven't ever really changed design. If I can get a stronger, faster, cheaper truck (with fucking autopilot!) then I'm interested.

Just don't throw metal balls at the window."
"You are so wrong! As fat as I am concerned the whole industry took a nose dive when they stopped using steel bumpers, and all the tech in this truck is staggering."
Less efficient that way.
"Seems like they didn't market test the design, lol  (even though I like it)"
Which makes no sense. They already have 3 legit vehicles people want to buy that are revealed but waiting to start production... why rush a 4th?
This feels suspicious. I feel like I’m having a bad dream I can’t wake up from. It’s the least marketable design I’ve ever seen for a car.
[deleted]
We just need triangle cars
"Rivian?  GM said they are doing one too, now..."
Ford is just swaping ICE with the BEV components. Don't expect any major refresh in the looks of the vehicle.
lol I’m in the same boat. I’m all stressed out because the window broke. Why didn’t they just drive another one out????!!!!
in order to go forward we must go back
Underrated comment right here.
Tri-motor expected late 2022... the wait begins
"With that 3/4 view, it looks cool, but from the side it just looks weird."
There's sharp corners all over this thing. No way this is street legal
#CYBRTRCKZFGLY
"bullet proof glass is way too thick to put it in that thing, and the outer layer would also shatter a bit, so it wouldn't work for that either"
"Someone asked about matte black above.  I know it's hard to paint stainless and you'd lose some functionality in the process, but I think it would look worlds better."
"Yeah, I'm curious myself too. I trust Tesla with collision tests, they haven't failed me before. But that sledge hammer impact didn't make it look bendable...

Personally I'm torn on the design, it's probably my least favorite Tesla to-date. After seeing such beautiful bodies for Teslas for so many years, this really has let me down a bit, but that's just because of the extremely high bar Tesla has set. I'd still prefer this over any other modern truck."
"Right. 

What they didn’t y’all about. They’re new Tesla ultra-absorbent gel. Since the body is one piece, so is the cab. And it’s set in their new proprietary gel that absorbs the impact.  /s

But really. I really am curious about crash results."
Into the other vehicle. Obliterated.
"If i remember correctly, Tesla’s do very well in crashes and rollover tests because the battery packs are in the floor and have such mass and rigidity that all the energy goes through the floor and doesn’t really translate into the cabin. But that is what i read on the model S many years ago."
Most likely they go into the other cat on the crash~ This has been the unfortunate truth of Tesla crashes for a long time and will be worse with this one. Against a solid wall it would crumble and I imagine a bulk of force will be absorbed by vibrations in the frame
Curious about that as well. Guessing the front and rear crumples
Tend to agree front and side grow on you. The back is fugly
"This was my first thought.  I’m like “damn, if this is his idea of a utility truck, what ELSE does Elon know that he’s not telling us”"
It looks like Elon’s shitty version of a DeLorean
I hope it has 3 horns. I can never find a horn when I'm mad.
I really liked the design but I'm a week so this just proves you right :(
"It was possibly the cringe I have ever seen, this was horrific to watch. I feel terrible for him."
I’m still cringing and it’s over...
"It's awesome dawg, I cans ee why it's weird to some people but I find it much cooler than a normal (boring) pickup"
This. I was waiting for the car to be a joke. Wrong. Then I was waiting for the windows breaking to be a joke. Wrong.
"Dude I said ""He's going to rip those panels off and show the real truck"" and then sat with a stupid look on my face as I realized that was actually the truck."

"Same.  The first thing I said was, ""I don't like it"".  It's already growing on me.  I like the way the bed cover opens.  I like the specs.  I like the # of passengers.  Love the price tag.  The look is still going to take a bit."
"Same. My thoughts:

""Don't suck, don't suck, don't suck......awwwww...""  
.  
""Eh""  
.  
""Oh?""  
.  
""Yup"""
Wasnt it the other way around

Ordering my stainless steel balls now
Elon was clearly uncomfortable.
"That, summer child, is the essence of cringe you are experiencing. Embrace it."
I thought it was a setup to reveal the actual truck
"I liked how it was very much like, 'oh well, we have time to fix the issue and we will.'"
Somebody’s getting fired!   I’m sure they installed regular glass in the prototype.  The engineer was screaming NOOOOOOOOO inside when he picked up that metal ball!
"Not really. Just like doors that don't dent, I don't care about bulletproof glass.  
It can shatter for all I care; it doesn't change how I feel about the truck.

What I do care about is aesthetics. And capability in the day-to-day.  
It's early days yet, but from this presentation I'm getting a strong sense that Tesla doesn't really know what ""truck people"" want."
I ordered one.  Thing is amazing!
"Me, too. The design is polarizing and I'm on the side of it looks badass and incredible."
Same not sure what everyone’s talking about ugly? The truck is sweet !! I can’t wait I ordered one hopefully I can afford it by 2021
"I am in total agreement. At first, I was just laughing like wtf......by the end of the presentation I was drooling. This thing is sick. It's the most radical design of any car I've ever seen. Comparable only to a lambo or Ferrari. This is the first Tesla I've ever actually wanted."
"It ships at the end of 2021, so now will have to be two years from now.  But congrats on the pre-order!"

What you get if you cross a Honda pickup with a DeLorean?
I agree. They missed the mark with this one.
Don’t be sorry.  It is not for everyone.  I on the other hand love what I am seeing.

As well.  
It's not like Super Duty turbo diesel owners are going to line up to buy it anyway."
"do trucks need to be ""pretty""? This thing is just pure function, and in a weird ugly way, it will turn heads.  Same reason why something like this would be used in a movie set in the future."
"The market for this truck isn't as a work utility vehicle,  it's a city driving daily commuter,  that someone can use to haul furniture, and drywall to their house.

It's a light electric truck, designed for city use

I have a truck, and I love the ability to be able to move a load I can't fit in a suv, and tow a light trailer.  While I could haul a heavy trailer with the 1500 i have I don't ever really plan on it.

Most of the time I drive it to work and back. and up to the cabin on weekends."
This is spot on. It's an electric truck for non-truck people.
Excellent comprehensive analysis. Very good points.
"i feel like you probably don't understand how the cybertruck actually works. everything you said sounds like deal breakers and i have a hard time believing tesla would design a truck like that. this was designed as a work truck. they wouldnt sell a truck for people who just want trucks to drive around. that would be really stupid because that market couldnt support this product. truth is, we both dont know that much about this truck. we just heard about some features. what i do know is that tesla designers are very careful about their use cases and they wouldnt design something with so many design flaws. the fact that they went with a triangle shape leaving the car ugly as fuck tells me they are willing to put utility above aesthetics. so if they were to make the cybertruck as you said, that would be the dumbest shit ever.

however, what you said about changing out the back portion, well, most people who buy f150s arent buying it so they can put something else back there."
"I'm a die hard Blue team Ford fan.... Daily drive a big ole F-350 diesel.... of which A new XLT moderately optioned sits around 55-60k new. 

With added cost of an ever more complex I.C.E., oil changes, $2.80+ per Gal. Diesel and DEF fluid. IMO, for those that can afford it, It would be well worth it to shuck out 70k for a Tesla truck over the 'big 3' 1 ton trucks.

But this is apparently not a truck... more performance off-road vehicle

I can understand wanting to do something different, but as the old JP saying goes “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.”"
This guy trucks
It's an electric hummer.
"Ah, but what if this isn’t a utility truck? Pickup trucks are the largest segment of the automotive market. At least half of the trucks I see on the road likely haven’t been used to transport anything that wouldn’t fit in a small SUV. A lot of people buy a pickup truck just because it’s cool right now, and they’ve been getting efficient enough that they don’t cost a fortune to run."
">Honda Ridgeline

It's amazing to me that today cars like this and Rivian aren't considered ugly as fuck. I haven't liked car models since early 2000's. They've all gotten so damn ugly and look more and more like tupperware containers.

That being said, those are some excellent cases you made for truck owners."
I'd buy it if I needed a truck. Tho Rivian has a nicer interior
Bold statement
"I'm starting to think it's not, lol..."
"When he said ""Oh, one more thing..."" I started maniacally laughing, hoping he was setting us up for ""This isnt the real truck, here it is!""  


I'm not laughing any more"
"Eh, I used to consider the Jeep redesigns to be the absolute pinnacle of fugly, but they eventually grew on me until I considered them about average. 

This, while initially shocking, looks pretty inoffensive to me, and I’m sure I’ll find it more attractive over time.

That price *especially* is attractive. Woof.

Just... Franz, please don’t attack the windows anymore. Please."
Do you have a link to where it is on the site?
"Definitely has a lot of potential for a work truck. Don't need to worry about door dings, leaving tools in the bed (they tend to wander off) and you could recharge tools while at a work site that doesn't have electricity. Should also be really cheap to operate.

But for your typical recreational truck owner I think it'll take a while. It reminds me of when the F-117 was introduced to the public. Pretty much everyone in aviation thought it was the ugliest thing that ever flew. Even decades later many still feel that way but there's a niche that it's grown on.

And if it's not in demand on the recreation side at least you wouldn't have to worry about anyone trying to steal it, lol."

"But, shit man, coming out with that is like saying we're going to a [Creed concert and it's fucking Jamie ~~What'shisname~~ Kennedy](https://youtu.be/bolpVVs2kmM) the rather lame comedian with an acoustic guitar..."
"Anyone who thought this is on drugs. Performance and functionality matter, that doesn’t mean you can throw out a horrid design. If Tesla played it safe and designed a less “edgy” truck they’d be printing money. This thing is an abomination."
This doesn't function well as a truck though. The bed has one point of entry. That's why I hate it.
"The more angles I see it from, the worse it looks."
"Thinking about the camping setup.  Most parks and sites have a damn outlet so you definitely could travel out, hook up, camp, and return."
"The design has some issues relative to Rivian and Bollinger.  While I like some aspects it doesn’t take advantage of the possibilities that an EV platform provides, like the side tunnel on the Rivian, or pass thru of the Bollinger (16 foot long lumber with tailgate up). I was really hoping for a cab over with a pass through and ability to load at least 8 foot long sheet goods flat in the bed.  I think the market overall will reject it."
Went to the site.  It is just as bad.
There’s no way this is real wtf
yeah this shit is crazy
"Tesla's worst enemy is gross mismanagement. A bunch of idiots with 0 clue could quickly ruin Tesla and run it aground. 

I think they need to bring in some outside established management asap. EV is a 30-50 year game. You have a hit with Model S, X, 3 and Y. 
And hopefully the Semi. But this truck is a key segment too but they're going to cede it to Rivian or someone like Ford easily. 

And oil industry will choke it and control it again... via these old fossil fuel cos."
I like it more than all the fan renders.
"The last concept that hit the web looked more realistic, actually most of them did look better or would've been better to present.  Such a waste of Design Team, money, and talent"

I agree with you it is shocking to see so many people on this sub so closed minded about it. I am a Ford diesel owner and have been for almost 20 years. I was going to buy the new aluminum superduty but now I want this beast. Only gripe I have is that it is built for the 150 class.
I can't wait to get one!
"Very much like the delorean, it's straight metal."
"I think you're right. The specs rock and at that price plenty of people will take a flutter at it. I've casually dusted plenty of F150s in my Model 3, I don't think those guys like it too much. I have a feeling plenty of casual truck drivers will go for one.

And at that price a $2-3k wrap will get you any color you want, and you'll still be way ahead."
It can be vinyl wrapped. You can have exactly the color you want.
The purpose of this isn't to appeal to the Tesla community. If he wants your average truck owner to transition to this they have to at least make it attractive.
I would argue Franz’s part extra ruined the entire event.
"Elon has done good in the past, though. He is a huge part of tesla, and although his presenting skills are rough he makes up for it in his genuineness. 

But holy shit this one was terrible. I don't know what happened, maybe he just choked, i'm really not sure. The glass part probably unsettled him, but even before that..."
"I would have loved to hear Franz talk about the design philosophy around the vehicle, but of course, there must be a pecking order."
"LOL I thought I was loosing my mind for a second. Thank god, someone who has paid an ounce of attention in the last fuckin year and a half."
I now think Tesla should offer two trucks. The “Cyber Truck” and the “Boring Truck”.
"When did he say that? If they didnt make it ugly it might've been literally THE BEST ev out there with 500 miles of range, being ferrari fast and practical for family amd work, they just decided to make it look like a pyramid."
"Truck buyers are a different breed. Name one who wants to look like a bitch in an ugly electric truck. These people still call stuff they don't like ""gay"" and they think their truck is a personality."
"It doesn’t need a normal truck but it also doesn’t need something ugly as fuck.

Edit: ok something weird is happening. I’m seeing videos of it driving and I’m hating it less. What is going on? Some call 911"
"May want to go read up on Delorean's history...


And he literally said he was trying to out F-150 the F-150. So many Tesla fans think Elon is infallible and will follow him blindly off a cliff, just as we're seeing here."
"How the fuck does a humans head fit in the point of a triangle?

Like, my head isn’t touching the liner in my car, but the roofline is the same height so it’s not claustrophobic..."
"But he's clearly targeting the Ford truck buyers. He just thinks the car is dope. I doubt it'll sell well, and he'll have to make a more conventional looking truck, but I'd love to be proved wrong. There are a lot of features that Ford and GMC trucks have that people utilize, and I don't know if this cybertruck has those features."
"i see 1 buyer for this. Dan Belzerian. When guys buy trucks, they want to be able to haul a fukin fridge in it, or a bucket of mulch, take it to a job site, or run it in the mud. this fucking thing makes NO sense whats so ever."
How progressive of you.
"Give it a week, people will come around. It looks awesome. Ugly, but awesome. And it's obviously capable of anything any ""truck driver"" could possibly need. Well I mean except spewing black smoke"
"I like it too. It looks like a DeLorean if it's a truck.

I'm more confused about the benefit of its exoskeleton structure. I thought he's going to show something beyond just how strong it is, like do you get a roomier interior? But it kind of just got glossed over.

I'm sure the flat and angular design is constrained by the harder material they are working with. You can't form it the way you can with softer material. I think more people will come around on the form over time if Tesla can sell the benefits. The knee jerk reaction to anything different that challenges the norm is almost always negative. Everyone has an opinion on aesthetics because it require no knowledge or insight to back up. That's why all the snap judgements are focused on the look instead of features and functionalities."
I think more people will warm to it over time.  Some won’t of course.
Genuinely love it. Looks absurdly cool to me.
I'm with you. This baddie is hot
I’m with you !
And whoever else crashed the order site...  I'm with you though!  Brothers in arms... just like the rollout music.
And the rivian...
"Even more than it looks like the future, everything else next to it looks super dated. Like antique dated."
"I’d say it’s a lot like an apple product, most people don’t like the design until sales beat new records."
The 80s is the future now?
Unexpected does not excuse shit.
and Rivian
Because they don't love it.  Pretty obvious
"Because it's not practical as a pickup truck. Maybe for a sci-fi movie, but not as a day to day work horse of transporting materials. It's ridiculous really, because their cars were designed to look like cars. But their trucks are designed to look like triangles."
Mimicking some stupid idea of what sci-fi is supposed to look like is just fucking lame and childish.

You nailed it.  The truck is amazing.  This presentation (not just the glass fiasco) was a complete train wreck.
"They already basically achieved their goal, with three other companies entering the electric pickup space (Rivian, Ford, and GM) desperate to announce before they did.  I don't think Tesla could compete against brand loyalty if they made a product that was at all similar."
"You summed up my thoughts exactly. One other point: people w/ trucks like to do ""truck stuff"" it's gotta be rugged, it's gotta haul, it's gotta be a simple tool for people. I'm not seeing current truck owners interested in this.

Ford needs to accelerate it's plans for electric F150 and rivian partnership and bring those to market asap. Big opportunity here left wide open. No way this sells in volume."
"Wholeheartedly agree. I've been a Tesla fan since day 1. I've spent countless hours defending them, many hours debating the naysayers, etc. Tonight I had a very scary thought for the first time ever:  


Maybe the short sellers ARE right."
"I'm a truck guy, and you hit the nail on the head as a non-truck guy.

Truth is, GM's ""real people"" commericals with the new Silverado towing could have been recreated here with much success to show actual capability.  Elon showed ZERO increased capabilty over my '15 GMC. He wrote some numbers on a screen, but every single demonstration was useless for the 1.5+ million people that purchased a new truck this year. No to the stainless steel, No to the glass (that went horribly sideways on him), and no to the look/feel of the machine in general.

The ""tug of war"" is a laughable example of capability, and anyone drag racing a pickup against a 911 is clearly NOT the demographic he should be targeting here.

Mainstreaming should very much be the goal here. Elon eluded to that in the beginning of the presentation himself. 1.5+Mil sold, JUST THIS YEAR. Then he rolls this thing on stage that is about as polarizing as it can possibly be. What a colossal missed opportunity for Tesla. Shame really."
He's doing the opposite of what Telsa was built for. Tesla made the first electric vehicles that looked NORMAL. Now he's making a truck like all the other other manufacturers made their EVs. Niche and weird.
"product looks like it isn't thought through, but just a rough sketch of tesla's interpretation of an electric pickup truck. Really unusual compared to how well they handle many other parts of the company and their strategic approach. Whatever win-win either you like a new truck or you buy more stocks"
No millenial cares about marketing. This will actually receive more attention now.
"two windows breaking in a presentation is going to delay the onset of electric cars? jesus, relax"
This guy trucks. Hard.
"Have ridgeline, totally agree."
"This isn't a chassis cab type truck designed for bed customization, it's a general pickup truck, and it's just a prototype, i'm sure they will add details like tie strap anchor points etc...

I also don't see why you wouldn't be able to spray a liner."
"They pretty much removed everything that makes it capable of a truck’s intended purpose. I was raised/worked on ranches; and this will never be looked at over the offerings from the Detroit 3. The lack of a gooseneck alone breaks the deal, hauling heavy equipment on a bumper tow is a pain in the ass. 

And I see some people like the design, I personally do not at all. So far I haven’t seen anything that would convince me as a consumer to purchase this over a Rivian T1."
I wish he included more useful info. I was expecting something similar to the semi unveil.
"I assume now that the truck is released. Elon will get lots of good feedback like this, and will probably fix most of it."
it's clearly more of a play-truck than a work-truck. think of it as a jeep competitor more than a pickup competitor.
"If you want a 350, go buy a 350. It doesn't have a ramp in the tailgate or a 240v plugin.

Early days man, it'll come as people request things."
Were you there?
"I’ve worked a lot of manual labor jobs that needed a pickup for moving people and coolers to work sites, then equipment and supplies — say, a pallet of shingles or a stack of plywood, around the work site that the cybertruck would totally work for."
"I was appalled at the design. I scrolled down and read your comment. Now I look back at all the other designs that were being thrown around. Each one of them is just another truck. I look at those and they're all actually disappointing to see. 

What was shown tonight is kind of ridiculous but it is entirely unique.  This will absolutely start new trends and I fucking love that."
Well said mate
">Chuck berry did it. Star Wars did it. The iPhone did it.

I don't agree with you but upvote for making a solid argument.
"oh please this is just pretentious and dumb as fuck.

it's a fucking truck. not art.

iphones weren't ugly as fuck like this is."
what are you smoking
"> Because people like seeing things they’ve never, ever seen before.

This is not the only criteria for success...

Aesthetics is largely innate"
Take my money now.
Now it just looks like an edgy truck.
"Man, this would sell so hard."
"Ok that is SO much better. Tesla should have gone with this style of approach, their design is waaaay out of left field"
That's like 1000x times uglier.
"This looks good. But people need to forget what traditional pickups look like and consider this something new. Pickups are meant to be utility vehicles, and it seems that this is going to have much more utility function than any other pickup on the market."
This is so much better
This is what I was expecting. Much better
That’s.... really good.
That just makes it more like traditional trucks. Might as well put a blue oval on it too.
"I think something about the exoskeleton basically mandates that the design be, more or less, a triangle. It being the strongest shape and all that. Just a guess though"
That's actually not terrible. Tweet it @Elon!
Now that I would buy.
"This seems immediately more palatable for the masses, I am open to change and the new design comes welcome, but the amount of criticism that will come with it may be difficult to seed into the current worker community. ask anyone on any construction site, they will likely tell you that the truck looks too different for them."
That’s even worse
Loved it in Total Recall
"Ain’t futuristic, shit look like a triangle fucked a hummer"

"It doesn't look futuristic, it looks like a 5 year old got bored."
"It doesn't look weird, it looks fucking stupid."
I like that Elon went with a somewhat risky idea in order to innovate. Most companies play it safe. The front looks great
"If the Aztec can sell, this can sell. I’m pretty sold on it, should be really nice, and I’m sure it’ll be interesting driving it around in Texas"
Elon was super thrown off after that happened.  Cut it early I'm sure.  Probably had some amphibious capabilities to show off but I don't think anyone wanted a vehicle with busted windows be on display.  That was an absolute disaster.
I wasn't watching till the end. How did the windows break? did someone throw something?
*EXACTLY*
"""Fuck yeah!"""
More like an 8 year old....
Elon Musk designed it himself using only a 12 pack of Crayola crayons
Yes yes yes
How does one order?
"Stupid, yes... Who really cares about the windows though? Why didn't we spend any time talking about the part that makes it a truck?"
crumple isn't in its vocabulary
Crumple zones are only found on the cars it collides with.
Its crumple zone is the other car's crumple zone.
Elon has said they build their cars with safety first in mind. All of their cars have the highest of safety ratings. Do you really think they would drop the ball for this and not make it on par with their other vehicles in terms of safety?
I thought the same thing
I was asking myself the same thing
Are you serious?
"I was thinking more Bladerunner DeLorean, but yeah."
This is easily my favorite comment of all time
Agreed. And her friend dropping the balls down the tube was channeling that old MTV show with the weird sex “expert” dude with the unnecessary fashion goggles and trench coat. What and why and what?
[deleted]
Yes.
"Yeah, that really took the wind(ow) out of his sails 😕"
Ik I feel a little secondhand embarrassment for him. :(
Immediately after the glass broke they talked about chucking wrenches at it. It was definitely a hiccup in his presentation.
You can have it in any colour. As long as you want it in silver stainless steel.
Imagine if Tesla actually made a Deloreon though....^^I ^^would ^^love ^^it.
Tesla fans who’ve never had the need for a truck or driven one in their life will prob order for the sake of ordering lol
It’s a real shame. Price and specs and features are a hit. The body though.
Concept. That won’t pass in the US. Some other car companies did the same design and got shot down for street.
not to mention the fact that it body panels cant rust.
Was that before or after he shattered the windows by accident?
Maybe Elon was on coke when he made it? Would explain some..
"Ha.  Yeah, I remember being severely conflicted between loving the functionality and the hating the lack of tactile feedback in a touchscreen."
I know. Or maybe had two on stage in case that happens and then pull the one with shattered glass off so it wasn’t so distracting. Dang it! That really killed the momentum!
"You thought the iPhone v1 was pointless? Man I remember being in awe of that phone when it was announced. All the features and sensors that never existed in phones before. Blew me away. Was also an apple hater until recently, but remember being truly in awe of the iPhone v1."
"I was relieved when the window broke, otherwise the ball would have likely bounced into the audience and hurt someone. The drop test was more than good enough."
From my understanding they did. Even threw the kitchen sink at it literally.
[deleted]
Stress testing it probably weakened it
"Someone above had a good point about needing passenger and driver side windows to shatter in case of emergency. I wonder if the front windshield is made with the powerful glass (which would make sense, as that is what you don't want to shatter ever and is where you are likely to take a rock or something similar)."
They’ll be fine as long as they’re carrying ball bearings.
Not including mirrors in prototype releases is pretty common.
"The Motortrend exclusive article repeatedly mentions the bulletproof windshield, but makes no such claims about the passenger windows. It's either a hilarious forgetful moment or a ridiculous marketing scheme. Makes for great memes either way lol."
"Yeah, all you need is an emergency metal sphere to smash it! They're actually stored behind the rear speaker covers!"
As long as the zombies don’t have steel balls
"The joke is when its so cheap he forces companies to make people that both hate tesla and this truck drive them as a company work truck, lol.  Well played"
"I'm with you 100%. Drum up media attention like Ford did with the Mustang moniker to their Mach-E and then slam dunk the actual design at the media hype peak.

Swing and a freaking miss if this is legit."
"The average is 3.5 miles/kWh

So pulling in 2kWh through solar would get you 7 miles, it’s not nothing, but it’s not a whole lot.

Crazy how much energy it takes to move a vehicle. 2kWh will charge your cellphone for a whole year, or move your car 7 miles."
"A 2m*2*m area could pull 1kw if pointed at the sun on a good day.

The car could use more than that running the ac"
"I mean, they're not wrong"
"That’s not their market, they know people won’t buy it for a work truck, still they could have at least let u reach over the side of the bed to get shit..."
Customers will decide in the end.
I believe I saw this truck in the 1982 film Megaforce.
This ⬆️
I have to agree with you. DeLorean did it first almost 40 years ago.
It looks like a metal trashcan on wheels.
"A lot of cars are still universally hated, they just have a ""cool"" following. The scion xb, the nissan cube, the   
 nissan juke, the honda element, the pontiac aztec (before breaking bad). I mean it also depends on the market also, as most of the cars mentioned do great in other markets (other than aztek). I see this being that way, low numbers, but the people who buy them REALLY love it."
#FUCK
Elon always does horrible presentations but this was pretty bad. At least practice a few times.
"It's really getting unacceptable how bad Tesla presentations are.  Take it seriously and rehearse, and hire someone who knows what they're doing to fix what falls flat.  Y's presentation was terrible, this was much worse.  Is that the first time you threw a damn ball at the window?  CRINGEWORTHY!"
"I wonder if Tesla realized it. If not, you're a genius."
The headlights are sooo sexy

I was just thinking that it would be like getting hit by a tank if you were to crash into this...
This is basically the Pontiac Aztec Part II. Almost everything that the people could have wanted it one no-so-attractive package.
If that’s the target market they should be charging more because the people have it
"I mean, if you hit it head on, it's just a ramp. You'll get some sick air.

*Stunt jump failed.*"
"Exactly this. I was SO excited for both the Model Y and Truck. Ready to order a Y for my wife and a truck for me. Neither will grace our driveway, because the Y left the U out of SUV and the Truck... well, I'm not getting ready for the zombie apocalypse.   


Sadly, I told a friend tonight ""If it has 300 mile towing range and is under $50k, I'm in. End of story""... Boy did I speak too soon (although I highly doubt the range will be anywhere near 300 miles with 14k lbs behind it)."
Totally agree. Design and name are nothing like current models. This has to be a joke.
It's quite possibly the biggest fail in automotive history
"Based on what they showed, you can’t reach the bed from the side of the truck. How is that functional?"
"Sorry, but it is not built around function. The aero is bad, the windscreen angle is unnecessary, the visibility could be better, the access to the bed is trash (basically impassible to hoist stuff over the side into the bed) and I don't care what you say, but having structural bodywork on a heavy duty truck is not a good idea. The only thing that is good is the approach and departure angles."
"Function? How big is that bed? And how you plan on grabbing that toolbox that’s up toward the front of it? Granted, I don’t own or use a truck... but is a truck for people that don’t use a truck."

Best I have found so far [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDQ3UnPA\_E8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDQ3UnPA_E8)
I think once the stream starts it’ll be a YouTube link.
"Unfortunately it will be next to impossible to find one that doesnt add there stupid extra ""content"" in on top of it."
I got you one bettee. I’m on a plane on the wifi and we are crossing the Rockies. I expect it to die just as it starts :)
Sitting in my 3 watching it while I charge
Tesla Cybertruck has tires - confirmed.
Tires confirmed!
You totally can I see two
Have you thought about becoming a CIA data analyst?
Good call are the light on the side of the body?
Agree.. this looks sleak!!! 8-)
"that girl is actually his girlfriend, no joke"
It literally is from blade runner
Itll be 2 years at least. Preorder now for $100
Im hoping this is just a prototype!
It has a 6.5 foot bed.
He'll pull a lever and all the panels will fall off to reveal the real truck.
Looks like it's for Iraq
It has to be for Mars. This can’t be for the road it doesn’t make sense
He did tweet earlier that it's for mars with a pressurized cabin change.
oh my god so cringy
My god I hope so...wtf?!?
You sure?
"me too, damn."
Did you not see it goes to 0 to 60 in 2 seconds
He’s never been that great at presenting
And the ugliest thing on the road
It would be if anybody would actually buy it.
Too bad it looks like shit
Nope. He said “we tried that earlier and it didn’t break so I don’t know what’s going on”
"When the new truck was doing g the tug of war with the F150,  I thought the F150 looked suddenly looked like a relic of the past.

I think he will sell more of these than the audience in this thread thinks so, but only time will tell."
Late 2021
Late 2021 for the single/dual motor. Late 2022 for the tri
Late 2021
The website says “You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in late 2021. Tri Motor AWD production is expected to begin in late 2022.”

They threw a freaking steel ball at it after saying it was indestructible and the glass shattered.
"They talked about how tough their glass was, they demoed a glass panel taking abuse, got cocky and tried to test the truck windows and they broke"
"Seconds after Elon mentioned nothing will break the glass they broke the glass on the truck Twice. Elon even said, ""Oh my fucking god"" after the first break. Just hope next time they do an event they can prove it's more durable by using a bat and see if it doesn't shatter into pieces like most cars...."
"They had a whole bit about how the glass was unbreakable, and then Franz threw a metal ball at the glass and it broke. Then Elon said ""try the other one"" and he broke that one too. Really awkward."
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBhzenID9LQ&feature=youtu.be&t=1512](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBhzenID9LQ&feature=youtu.be&t=1512)
"Glass was supposed to be pretty much shatter proof, guy threw metal ball at glass, glass shattered"
they threw huge steel balls at the glass window... and it broke lol. then they did it a second time! lmao
They were talking about how strong the glass was and threw a metal ball at the window and it broke. Then again when they did it on the rear window
"they wanted to show how tough the glass is. Franz threw a steel ball at the driver's window. it broke. he then threw it at the rear window driver side. that broke too. it was really sad. 

Elon then joked: ""We will fix this in post""."
"They did a demo dropping a ball on tesla glass, it didn't break. But when they threw the metal ball at the truck... the window broke. Then they did it again... and it broke again."
"The displayed the glass vs. regular glass and showed a ball falling and not breaking on the Tesla glass. But then they brought out a guy to throw an object at the truck window and the window shattered. Didn’t go through, but still shattered. Then they did it again to the back window and the same thing happened.

Then Elon mentioned they’d fix it in post.

Here’s the second one. 

https://twitter.com/mashable/status/1197733154674446337/photo/1‬"
They went to show off how strong the glass was and it broke. Twice.
"They did a dropping ball test that worked just fine. Showed standard windshield panel cracking from a ball dropping at like 5 feet. Showed Tesla windshield withstanding bigger ball from like 20 feet not cracking.

Then they had someone lightly toss a ball at the actual truck's window and it cracked bigtime."
Elon decided to have one of the stage performers to throw a steel ball at the window. The window shattered but the ball didn't go through the window.
The glass broke when they threw a steel ball at it
"They failed a live demo, where Franz broke the unbreakable glass."
"They are using what he calls ""transparent metal"". It is strong glass and they had a large square sample that took impact way more without breaking than typical auto glass, but then they had the dude throw a metal ball at the window of the truck and it broke. (driver side and rear window too on second try). Elon kinda looked surprised. He looked a little coked up, or just his awkward self, hard to tell. I don't think the glass breaking was expected. I think reviews of the reveal will focus on this of course, but it is still a bad ass truck, especially for the price tags noted as a part of the larger lineup. Steel frame is noteworthy."
"They demonstrated the glass resiliency on a single plane on the stage, and then used a metal ball on the actual truck and ended up breaking the windows on the truck. Elon looked a little upset about that tbh"
I'd give up the third row of a seating for an at least 8 foot bed in a heartbeat.
It's not meant for that
It's not meant for that
"Put my $100 down on the extendo range version. I don't really care man, I don't actually have to look at it when I'm in it. The Model S looks nice, it can be my show car"
His name is Franz...
It felt like a tech demo for some excellent tech until the glass broke on the model
Air suspension ain't exactly new.
No. Just a RN number with low poly owl.
Nope not yet.
No email but pending CC charge and a reservation number
[deleted]
Can I ask what exactly went thru your mind when you saw it and decided you'd buy this monstrosity?
"Yep, got it.  
Not an email, but a confirmation number on the screen."
Just the confirmation page. Waiting for the email.
I'd say that might help the appearance.
[deleted]
"Makes me wonder why they don't put 500-mile range on the Model S. Not a priority, I guess. This was much more important."
no email for me yet.
Neither for me
"Nothing for me either, I’m sure they’re bogged down and it will sort itself out in time. I have a charge on my card."
"I was charged, but saw the error page for what I would imagine is the confirmation page. I do not see anything in my account and didn’t received an email."
Same issue here. Not sure yet. Could just be backed up.
"My order went through (credit card was charged).  No email though, and it is NOT showing in my Tesla account.

Edit: Still no email... but it is now showing up in my Tesla account."
"I got a reservation number on the splash page, but no email or in my account."
I do not have either.
It's prolly not available (atleast the dynamic ) in the 40k ver
"Don’t have a link but go to motor trends website. They have tons 

Just realized you are probably making a joke lol"
All of them wasn't enough?
"roadster doesn't have mirrors either. Elon was joking(?) about the roadster mirrors if they have to, they put them on but in  a way you can easly take them off at home."
It most probably will unless US DOT (?) changes their requirements 🤷🏻‍♂️
It will
"Yep, I've been wondering about that too."
I just told my wife it looks like a Johnny Cab https://images.app.goo.gl/eZiHM3kPzryu9PsC7
"Roadster and Model X reveals didn't have side mirrors either. They'll either add them in production or NHTSA will change the rules and allow cameras. It has a rear camera that will apparently always be displayed ~~on the 17"" screen.~~

EDIT: The rear camera displays on a smaller screen where a rearview mirror would normally go.

https://media.giphy.com/media/IaW2iyND3X7PLt5SSz/giphy.gif"
You look at that heap and that’s the question that pops to mind?
Replaced with side-view cameras is my guess.
This
"> red queen

Define that?"
"His *other* younger brother has been hyping it all month, so it's possible."
Well it's actually quite simple.  You put down $100
[deleted]
It'll buff out. And 5 days later they'll be turning themselves in after being publicly shamed in local media.
"They will try, but it's harden steel."
"It will scratch/grind their keys instead. The hardness of the stainless steel alloy they claim to use should be higher than any key I know of, like trying to scratch a diamond with a stick and also no paint."
The model 3 was unveiled without mirrors too. I think it's Elon's intent to show that's where they're heading as the sensors and cameras you mentioned can perform the same function.
Likely to be added later
Might be using cameras. The rear view mirror is a screen now.
Damn game has been delayed so long one wonders if the truck will have the same fate.
Thanks for the memories and yet another confirmation “The Simpson’s did it first!” Haha.
Ive talked to about 10 people on site today about it. The only person that likes it is one of the laborers.
Hipsters in a post apocalyptic future? MadMax kid hauler?
Police!
"I wrote out this whole long thing, talking about social markets and whats the current trend and age when buying vehicles, but i erased it to just get to the point.

people who buy mercedes g wagons. That's who their target audience is."
"In theory it’ll be cheaper to run than a gas pickup, making the target audience actual construction workers and people who use their trucks. Decent amount of contractors give their guys priuses and stuff for non hauling because it saves money, now they can use electric The only problem is it might look too ridiculous for them lol"
"I could see surfer dudes in California and the like buying this.

But mostly it will be people who have no real need for a truck except for that yearly camping trip.

What they don't realize is that by buying a truck, even one that looks cool in their eyes, they are setting themselves up to be the ""moving friend"", or the ""help me out"" friend. People who've never owned a truck in their lives are in for a rude awakening."
"> Most people I know who own trucks either live in the countryside (where there aren’t many charging stations) 

I don\`t understand this complaint. Anyone buying this truck will install an appropriate charging station/NEMA outlet where they park the truck for the night and have the vehicle always fully charged in the morning. Much better than having to periodically drive to the closest gas station, that might be miles away, right? I'm missing something?"
It's literally an electric car with an open trunk and higher clearance; so the market is wide open.
He ranched it up
"Because he can. Seriously, ordinary car design and looks are a bunch of compromises that arise from countless  corp meetings. Tesla designs and looks comes from an ""emperor"". Totalitarian regimes sometimes work much more efficiently."
Yah it's just a normal roll-away bed cover.  You can buy one for pretty much any truck today for a few hundred bucks.
"I don't think that will survive too long on the construction site. 

Watch a show like Yukon Gold. That's what trucks are for."
They make this for trucks now.
"Everything was great but the look. I don’t see this appealing to the general market. Tesla fans, sure. And even some of those won’t like it. It’s so ugly. I just don’t understand."
I was like that's not it.  I like the ATV tho.
totally agree
Have you been reading the thread?
I think it's epic
"1/1,000,000"
"I look at it as an amazing utility machine. But if I'm in the market for a pickup, I don't think I'd want this. You can't load stuff over the sides of the bed."
"I do, too! It grew on me"
Yes. But quickly growing on me
The edges are probably what makes it cheap to manufacture.
I don’t think you can tweak this truck lol.
Same. It'll tweak. People freaking out like this is exactly what's rolling off the production line. It'll change and land somewhere closer to normalcy.
You’re doing the lords work
"Contractor here, bullshit. I drive a super duty diesel and I'd trade it right now for that truck. Everything I wish was different about my truck is fixed by that truck. Literally the only thing I would change is build one that is in the class of the superduty and make it have different bed options."
"Exactly.  The price is great, people would buy it if it looked even CLOSE to a modern truck!!!  I was one of them, but I’m not going to but that.  They dropped the ball."
Seriously. I'd be embarrassed to show up at a job site in this thing. Tesla should have designed a fleet vehicle instead of this disgusting thing.
"This was a Huge opportunity to take off the road some of the most polluting vehicles. I don’t know what Elon is thinking treating this segment as a project to be avant gard 

We need normal looking electric vehicles"
I don’t think “...everyone who likes EVs will praise this futuristic look.” Far from it.
That would be the conventional wisdom but I’m someone with virtually no interest in buying a truck who is now inclined to do so.. cause why not? 70k model 3 performance or a 70k pickup that’s a bit faster and has tons of additional capabilities? Why not?
Utility will win over Form. Trucks are boring AF these days anyways.
"This is a specific target audience. Like the, ""I own a Lamborghini countach AND a DeLorean but I like to go to Home Depot and buy a robellini once a year"" target audience. 

Almost certainly not the truck audience."
I think it's an unmitigated disaster. They'll quickly find this out with the lack of reservations. No one's going to buy it.
"seems convenient to hop in, open up your app, and close the cover to catch some z's..."
"I absolutely love it.  It’s halo 1.  Start simple and leave space for improvement.  But I have a real respect for the simple, yet very different design.  God, I want a Tesla and this is the one I’d want.  Unfortunately, I have to wait for used Tesla’s.  Unless Tesla wants a rep in my area!"
"I’ve noted it before and I’ll state it again: I think the window shattered because they threw the metal ball at it AFTER they did that sledgehammer-to-the-doors test.  That was impressive, certainly, that the truck did not sustain any damage but I suspect the vibrations might have caused the windows to develop cracks which produced the subsequent shattering.

Having said that: I don’t love the look of the truck but neither do I hate it.  In fact, each time I look at it, I like it a little more.

Having said that (redux) I’m not really their target audience.  I’ve been driving since 1981/82 and in all that time never once needed a pickup truck and still don’t.

It is curious, however, how the truck is growing on me in terms of its looks!"
"On your point of this not denting as easily, I'm curious to see if it would hold up to NHTSA safety standards. The main reason why new vehicles buckle so easily in small crashes is due to engineered crumple zones to help mitigate energy during a crash. If the tesla truck doesn't crumple, all of that energy gets transfered into the driver/passengers. That's not good."
Yeah but they claimed that it wouldn't smash like that. They set expectations and failed miserably in their demonstration.
You know the first thing I look for when I buy a vehicle is shatterproof windows and bulletproofing. I will give it to Musk he knows how market. I consider him the PT Barnum of my generation.
"How is towing capability and acceleration a win for Tesla? I’m not trying to be a giant dick but Tesla’s truck from a truck stand point. Kind of sucks. I mean it’s not that bad I guess? But the top of the line model is rated to tow 14,000 pounds and go 500 miles and costs 70,000$. My truck from 2005 is rated for like 16,500 pound towing capacity, can go like 400 miles and I got it for 18,000$. 

I get what Elon Musk is doing and trying to get away from fossil fuels and what not. That’s awesome. But comparing his truck to another truck, it just doesn’t compare. Will it in the future? Probably but for now? Nah"

">If someone accidentally hit your truck (fender bender) a regular truck would dent much more easily than the cyber truck. Tesla-2, others-0

 * Honestly this isn't the best design for a working truck, you want a body on frame design because it allows the body to flex and take damage while keeping the frame straight. 


>that trunk bed though! Tesla-5, others-0

* Again, I don't see this as a win, the unibody design won't allow for mix-and-match bed configurations (box, flatbed, tow, 5th wheel, etc) there's no way with those slopped sides along the bed that a proper 5th wheel can be attached. And what happens when your load slams down on one side of the bed, and instead of the truck bed flexing and twisting to take the load and leave the frame straight, it's possible that one wrong unloading and the whole frame gets twisted on the cyber truck. Again, this is just speculation.

I'm really at a love/hate stance right now with this truck. But ultimately I see it as a ""city persons"" truck. Use it about once a month to tow some mulch from the hardware store or some new furniture and feel good that you're not polluting the environment while you drive a ""truck"". But anyone that needs a real work truck or wants to go off-roading will not be interested in getting this IMO."
I'm like 50% it's a fakeout
Omg I came here to say the same exact thing lmao
They have pics of the interior on the website
Scroll down on tesla.com/cybertruck. There’s one interior shot.
F-117T Stealth Truck
it looks more like a truck . that's about it.
You and me both.  Jesus H Christ on a log.
and damn that rivian truck is ugly... but this is in another level lol
"This would be a terrible option for any paver, landscaper, mason, painter, or roofer. You have one point of entry into the bed, which is fucking stupid. It's like the first gen Honda Ridgeline. I don't get it. It's awful. 

I mean, if I needed a vehicle to blast through the desert with, this would be sick. But if I'm a small business owner, this does not help me outside of fuel savings. 

Military and police will want variants of this, and I bet it'd be a beast of a plow truck."
[deleted]
[deleted]
"This was my biggest gripe (although I love everything else about it). I regularly have to haul full 4ftx8ft sheets of plywood, and a full size bed is super important."
98% of the trucks I see everyday have absolutely nothing in the box and aren't towing anything so......
W
Elon's really lost his mind on this one
it's been going on for too long. bring the truck out
It’s very much not
I wish
RemindMe! 1 Year
Please no what the fuck
"I mean, I doubt they made on not to sell."
Not on Tesla.com....yet. I'd definitely be curious
I just hope the spikey ends aren't actually stainless steel.
"Probably only real shocker honestly. I thought it was going to be a working man's truck, but I just don't see it from that angle. 

I thought it was going to be ugly but beat every other truck in every metric, but with such a non-standard bed I wonder how many people can actually utilize it for their job/business."
Buy two
Just throw a custom rack on it...somehow.
"I went from a two-door long-bed to a four-door short-bed when we had kids and it's not that big of a deal.  I just drop the gate and tie everything down nice and tight.

The Cybertruck is not suited to having some long-beds, some short-beds, some utility sides, etc. like box on frame set-ups.  I can foresee a rugged SUV version of it, though."
">It would be ""futuristic"" if it was released in the 80's... the future of where car design and technology is going now looks nothing like that truck."
You may still need to replace a few windows.
And no more getting your car keyed...
Except if hail hits any glass ;-)
"You saw the windows shatter, right? (Only kind of joking)"
"Well... Maybe except on those windows, right... ;) :/"
hey im here to fix your windows.         from 2090
If it makes sense financially by not having to buy generators and fuel savings they might have a small number for each job.
Not without leather jacket and shades
Orale Orale
I believe the panels open for storage.
"I'd imagine it's probably for aerodynamics/range. I'm no engineer, but low side panels induce a ton of turbulence/drag."
Most truck beds are hard to access from the side these days due to how high they sit and how high they design the belt line. It's the main reason I can't stand any new truck.
"It said on their web site that the sails are removable, but it doesn’t actually show them being removed. At a guess, the prototype’s can’t, but the production models will be able to."
[deleted]
"I’ve had a roller coaster of emotions this past hour. i went from ""is this a fucking joke"" to ""fuck i hate that thing"" to ""fuck the specs are good, but looks like crap"" to ""fuck i like it"""
This it grows on you.
"Similar reaction for me as well. The initial 10 seconds was ""ohhh......"" and then it quickly grew on me."
"Man, that's a classic."
Have I ever... what? (I know what it’s supposed to say but it took me a second!)
> stoppedntonrwallynlook
"It's the length of an average Ford F-150 (well, a long bed crew cab F-150 is 250 inches, so almost 20"" longer than this), so I'm willing to bet that in person, that roofline is low and really, really problematic... Especially for the rear passengers. Yikes. Think Acura ZDX on steroids."
"Precisely.  This was a gamble for Tesla, however.  I respect the cybertruck team for having the balls to present such a bold design.  America is a truck country and Americans, especially the ones who love trucks (Midwest), are typically traditional. This will definitely be polarizing for the market Tesla is attacking here.  But the specs don’t lie. It’s superior to the F150 in every relevant metric.  A construction-worker/contractor would vastly prefer this over the competitors on durability and reliability alone.  But they might get hung up on the looks.  Just depends if you’ve seen blade runner I guess lol."
"If you're going to change the game, you should at least make it better."
I’m not even surprised if they have something worked out lol
Ngl that was a pretty funny episode.
">I mean it’s like they thought modern trucks copied each other only for looks, there’s a reason the flat and rectangular bed shape exists.

that's my main gripe with it. I want to be able to have a camper shell on the back! WTF"
"They have a pic of camper concept.

But yeah having loaded really heavy shit in and out of pickups I would not welcome the fairings either. Honda tried that with the Ridgeline. Sometimes form has to follow function."
[deleted]
Why only a 6.5' bed too? I mean if you're trying to be badass make it badass.
"'80s and 2020, but yeah."
Please don't insult the Homer like that
They got a focus group from Hollywood’s sci-fi department
Tesla doesn’t care about designing for “Truck People”.  They make their own rules.
"I think even Zuckerberg understands rural American better, and that's a low fucking bar"
"Yep, exactly my thoughts. I understand that a Tesla should stand out with unique design and technology, but if you really want to entice buyers it needs some familiarity and practicality."
"Agreed. He really only needed to preview that to some Wisconsin truck owners and he would have realized it’s gonna be a hard no from existing truck owners. Even if some truck owners do like it, they will never buy it due to teasing from their friends."
hit the nail on the head... not really sure what they're thinking.. this might lose some people
I disagree with you. I’m sold and I own a truck. I’m actually a Jeep guy (I have 2) but I use my truck for work.
"Yes!  And Elon kept referring to it as a car, as well.  They are coming at this from the wrong direction if they want to sell to those of us who only want trucks."
Elon literally said a lot of people wont like the design and they are all shocked that it looks weird.
"A certain cadre of people are going to absolutely love this thing forever, just like the DeLorean it resembles. 

No guarantee of commercial success, in the case of the DeLorean, but that car had other problems. We’ll see when it comes to the Cybertruck.

If nothing else, I love how daring it is."
"I dont think people understand the whole cyberpunk part it looks wacky in comparison sure but its mental and i love it, i wish they went into more deatil though pretty short stream"
They all shorts hoping they don't lose their pants on the stock...which they will!
"I agree but then again both of us know there's a lot of pavement princess out there and even less are into sci-fi/cyberpunk themes. Got some serious futuristic military vibe when looking at the side and back which is a good thing, IMO."
"Honestly, this thing is a tank. Why **wouldn't** you want to own a street legal tank?"
"We all know the current fan base will likely dig the look (overall) but I'm sorry to keep saying this in my posts but I don't get how their research and marketing team thought the general truck public, rural, working class who spend 50k on a nice f150 (or similar) thinks that they would feel the same as us.  It's highly polarizing and there's a reason all the trucks look pretty similar - the market wants them to look like that... but I guess we will see."
No more pinstriping on overgrown tracks. You bet I would take it in raw stainless!
"14k+ towing capacity, 500+ mi range, amazing acceleration, built-in compressor, power outlets for all tour tools, built-in bed cover, built-in ramp, super-rugged body, great off-road capability, competitive price...

Aside from the unconventional looks, this is something contractors would die for. 

It’s a fast, car-generator-compressor capable of surviving 2x6 raining down upon it - this thing would do great on a construction site."
Elon typically presents like that. He wings it. I don’t think it matters. People can relate to a guy up there winging it when the product is sick af. Too many smooth talking sales people are pitching shit these days that’s totally scripted. I deal with them constantly.
"It's the exact opposite. Honestly, it boils down to a very ugly truck.

Futuristic or not, if the truck actually looked good, the rest of the demo wouldn't really matter."
"> I see it more as a competitor to a Jeep Wrangler than an F150 in its current state.


How did you come to that conclusion?  It's huge, with massive approach and departure angles.  It is completely different than a Wrangler."
"I didnt thik it would look like a normal truck, but I also didnt think it would look like the unholy love child of a Delorean and Kufu’s pyramid"
There's not looking like a normal truck then there's looking like someone built it in a shed with mixed up giugiaro designs.
It's literally in the name
"Because it's a fucking monstrosity and looks to be a design some moron thought up in the 80s.

If this is the new designs they decide to take with the S, X, 3, I'll no longer be a fan.  They'll be like every past electric vehicle company from the 80s and 90s."
"Fuck that, it is a BEAST.  I love it!"
Franz actually stated in a recent interview that Tesla does not have any design language and has no plans to implement one.
I was very surprised by the price points.
Nope. I didn’t get it the first time so I did it again and just realized I got charged twice. Guess I’ll just have to buy two 🤷🏻‍♂️
i really don't.
"Your comment made this all click for me. Elon is smart and okay’d this design. 


They don’t want to mass produce their first truck. Do you remember the nightmare of the model 3 ramp up? Start with something edgy with a small market, work the kinks, then once you have everything worked out, release a product that appeals to the masses. 


Yes, from a business perspective it looks bad because sales will be low for it...but from a learning, engineering perspective, I’d say it’s pretty clever."
"Agreed. I dig it. But I'm also enough of a realist and know enough truck guys to know that it was gonna be a hard enough sell anyways. Even with a relatively normal body styling. The 2nd gen Raptor still gets a lot of hate because they went from a 6.2 v8 to a twin turbo v6, even tho it made a good deal more power and a lot more torque. Anything in a truck that isn't diesel and/or a v8 gets truck guys panties in a twist. And the 2nd gen is a much better truck. So this is gonna be hard for Tesla to convert folks with. Even the Rivian is gonna have hard time."
That’s what I don’t understand. The whole reason they succeeded in the first place was because they made attractive EVs when the rest of the EV market looked outlandish compared to normal cars. For some reason the did a 180 on their strategy and made a car that looks like nothing else on the road
You probably cant get those same specs with a conventional design.  Its pretty freaking aerodynamic.  The whole point of the stainless weight bearing skin is that its lighter than a frame and conventional body panels.
Ford is releasing an electric F150... if you want an electric truck that looks like a normal truck then just buy that. Tesla has never been about appeasing the status quo.
The f150 Bev pulled 1 million pounds. Tesla trying to compete with a base 25k ICE f150 is lame
This is not real
"That's 10000x better with a useable bed where you can access it from the sides. 

Plus it might take a rack which makes it useful for contractors"
Is that an actually picture or one somebody edited?
That point just really ruins it for me.... they couldn’t just have even a slight flat part there or something? Especially for mounting something?
Nope. Still looks like dog shit.
 The rolling tanneau is actually one of it's more redeeming features for me
"That is significantly better, but still very bad. The front is still killing it."
Nothing a hack saw cant fix. Also id increase the rear headroom height.
"Looks more like a truck, at least.  Not sure it's even an option to truncate those features, considering the apparent construction."
That looks way better!!!
I've also read on another big thread where they apparently did 5 test throws behind the scenes yet still did one on stage.
And I like it!
Not being able to reach into the bed from the side  to grab that tool or bag of nails is a PITA..
"The rear overhang seems shorter than most.  
I agree on the side rails if they're fixed in place, but I think I saw an image of the side rails dropping down somehow (I hope so). I don't know if anyone else can confirm.  
It's a prototype, I'm sure some details will get refined before production."
The renders on the website and at motor trend look way better than the live event imho
"Same. Gives me major Blade Runner vibes, and I love it.

I also almost feel like part of the design was a middle-finger to that weird subset of people who for no apparent reason hate electric cars, and drive big gas-hungry pickups just to over-compensate. 

Because now the biggest boldest looking pickup *is* an electric car."
"> most people just have to warm up to a new design over time.

I think the same.

I like it as well."
"Yup, generally people have no sense of taste, they love what they know. In a few years they’ll come around saying they love the new polygonal design trend."
"It's the same as what people said about the Model 3 ""never gonna sell with that interior""."
lmfao is that what people said about iphone launch?
"Yeah, without a doubt it looks whacky, but it doesn't look *that* bad. I can see it growing on people when they see it more. I guess we just gotta wait. The pre-order site was just down so I would guess a good handful of people are preordering one."
"Exactly my thought. It also annoys me how people care so much about how a car looks, rather than what it does."
"This is very different dude, rivian has it right"
yeah but nobody comments on the apple pippin
"it’s 80s sci-fi, but I love it! It’s ugly and beautiful at the same time"
[deleted]
It is ugly! I love it!
"Agree 100%. Initial impression was bad, but now that I look at it more and more and forget what I think a truck should look like, I freaking love it!!"
You're kidding right?
Its not futuristic its ancient. Futuristic design from the 60s
Futuristic and impractical. It won’t hit the market for people who want trucks
"It's not for people with conservative taste.


I love it. I think opinions are going to change once people see it in person."
"The low price will be a big boon. only 10k more than a ford f150 and you save probably 10k in Gas over the next 2 years, lol"
"I have 1/3 of my portfolio in TSLA.. I'm about to get hammered.

EDIT: I sold as soon as the pre-market opened and my portfolio only lost about 1% overall. I'm still wanting shares, but when it *really* drops (sometime around mid day I think the market will reveal it's true opinion of the situation) l'll buy back in. Musk is the kind of guy to come back from this with actual bulletproof windows, and a body designed by Pininfarina."
Nope. Really wishing I trusted my instincts and sold today
Absolutely not worth it
"I was considering a Model Y, but now I'm wondering if I should wait an extra year or two. The dual motor looks appealing. Seats 6 adults and has 100 m^3 of cargo space. I don't really need a pickup, but I suddenly need this."
"That's the problem. The truck isn't actually a truck. It's some weird doorstop looking space vehicle. For people who wanted an actual truck, it's a huge disappointment. Also it's just hella ugly."
Just don't try throwing a rock through the window to impress your buddies
why? it's awsome
My jaws still on the floor
"Most people here have this same reaction, but i can't believe that there are idiots defending this piece of shit....."
"Haha yeah, everyone's a hater! Did you miss that 99% of the replies don't like it?"
No one has ever said teslas looked outdated. Ever.
I doubt if. This is almost half as cheap. 69 for the same old boring pickup. Or 39 for a TANK
"4D chess - make the Rivian look so good in comparison, every one buys it, and accelerates the adoption of clean transportation... :D"
"Yeah this feels like something a person would Make as a project for themselves, not for mass purchase. 

Fuck it though, Who knows? We will know if a few years if it shifts perceptions or if it bombs. I don’t see it being an f150 killer though."
I don’t think the ATV would have been more if he had his composure. Clearly that was just an add on announcement with no information provided for it. But man what a letdown of an event.
">this is not going to be a truck that can expand into service vehicle markets

Exactly, while I love this design - I'm sure it will only be able to entice a subset of the truck market - the one that wants trucks because they look masculine / menacing. Tesla may have to design a normal looking truck after all for everyone who buys truck for its utility and doesn't want to stand out too much."
"I get the 80s retro future vibe too. But honestly I think the design is less of a fashion choice and likely more of a design factor. I suspect the team was told, start from scratch, build a design that allows, low price, great range, and powerful specs and that the outward design is what comes when you drive toward those goals."
"I mean, if that’s what it looks like, doesn’t that make the 80’s right about what cars would look like in 2020?"
"Re: ""as seen on tv"" comment.  It's like none of the people had ever used a Destaco clamp before.  And they are some of the most intuitive devices ever made.  A real face-palm moment."
"After seeing the specs and the price, because you don’t like the appearance, you think the company’s direction is falling off a cliff? Lol Elon literally said it wouldn’t be for everyone which is definitely true as there’s nothing that even comes close to remotely close to looking like this, but dang that seems harsh. To each their own though. Get a Rivian I guess! I just put my deposit on this bad boy though 😎"
"It doesn't need to sway F150 buyers, those people aren't going to buy an electric, much less the California soccer mom truck anyway. This is a new type of vehicle. The closest thing I can think of is the H1 Hummer, the audience for this are people that want something new and different, just like an electric car was 8 years ago, and there isn't a shortage of those type of people."
">Its a truck for people who have no need for a truck but want the brand name and the stats....like people driving Escalades.

You dont think people will be using it like other trucks?"
why say the most sold cars are trucks then aim to be low volume?
"Except he never said ""Looks very ugly and bad"""
"They never said anything about it being low volume or non-mass, trucks are the best selling vehicle class currently and this is their entry into that. It's supposed to be their largest volume product."
"I love Tesla and everything they do. I saw this thing and thought, that cant be it surely? It looks like a 5yo drew it.

The crowd at the launch were off to. They were waiting for a joke/setup.

God what a debacle."
That's true. What a total dumbfuck car to make.
Get out the flux capacitor.
I would sooner drive a Ford Pinto with exploding gas tank.
"You don’t care about anything but looks, that’s okay. You’re just a shallow person."
Of what
Honestly and floor
Oh... good question. (I have nothing to add)
"I have the same questions, but given Tesla’s track record with safety, I’m sure they’ve developed a solution. Very curious as to what it is though."
It means everybody will constantly be taking shots at your truck when you park it in a public place overnight.
I'm sure Tesla Engineers have accounted for this...
"The kinetic energy flows through the super strong skin and blasts out the other side. It’s like black panther armor. It’ll smoke a school bus of kids in the process, but hey, it’s the future."
"I was wondering the same, but it is possible to have crumble joint where the pieces join."
"Crumple zones are intended to crumple under the impact of a vehicle collision, not a sledgehammer. If you were in your car and someone hit it with a sledgehammer, you aren't going to get hurt regardless."
"Having a high yield strength (and bending strength) doesn't mean it wont collapse in an accident, potentially it could be even better. it just means it will take more force to start the initial collapse before it crumples."
yeah no interior either. Good point. And they didn't explain basically \*why\* they chose to design it that way. Such a bad presentation.
"Concur. The launch was a massive failure. It will be a joke for years to come. Think iPhone launch when they couldn’t get on the Internet. 

He literally claimed it was unbreakable glass and then broke it - twice."
Plus $100 reservation fee.
"For real. He's trying to compete with the top 3 selling vehicles in the country, and he spent no time talking about its real capabilities."
I want to know what they’re doing about the lack of mirrors.
"I'm starting to believe some of the shorts rumors about Tesla financials

Why else rush this out"
Did you get any kind of confirmation? Website crashed when I submitted but payment went through. but no email confirmation.
No way....
Ford has already announced an electric F-150 to be released in 2022
Well said.
It just doesn’t really seem to have the soul and aesthetic maturity of a Tesla.
"Why? Just the design? That's very subjective isn't it? 

Did this miss anything else?"
Nah
Most truck owners aren’t ready to go electric and breaking into this market wasn’t going to be  easy. If Musk sells a few of these trucks but gets everybody to completely reimagine the future of electric transport then this reveal was a success. It’s all about focusing on S3XY right now.
"Ford is already a big investor in Rivian, which is rumored to be licensing/manufacturing the ""sled"" for a prototype electric F150 that's been spotted testing. I agree with your assessment, huge miss."
We’ll see. People said the same thing for Model 3
"Ford will likely make a regular looking truck, it will also probably cost more and do less. It's a silly way to think of it. We are used to seeing trucks built the way they are becuase the form follows function. If a different form improves the function than that becomes the new normal."
$100 deposit to think about it for a couple of years.
The reason no pictures leaked is because no-one even took any.
"Solid grounds. Prior art.

Can I include my son in the Class Action? I've seen his drawings and can confirm they also look remarkably similar."
"He said if people don't like the design they'll make a more conventional one

skip to 58 minutes"
NO
Not really. Looks like a space rover
"Yes actually, much better"
"with some more refinement, yes."
much better
No?
Wow.. yes.
"No.  Looks worse, and would no doubt get far worse range.  This thing is a function of physical realities.  If pushing a brick through the air made no difference, Tesla would have designed a standard cab and bed."
Yes I think this delete would be great. Would it mess with the aerodynamics enough to affect range?
No
Much better.  I wish they had gone this route with the design... I guess it's not too late.
"Haha, perfect!"
If someone brings a steel ball your done for.
"I agree. I mean its ugly, but imo most trucks are ugly and all in the same way.  At least this one is different. But if people want the biggest, toughest, most functional truck that will also stand out like fuck ... then this is the only game in town there.

This is basically like a tank on wheels"
"Eh, if you tow you probably have a superduty 350 or 250, which have around twice the tow capability of the cyber truck. If you're hauling, the bed design just doesn't work.

I think it's basically an electric raptor. Pretty cool, but weird that he is saying it's a work truck competitor."
Wait...you are joking right? Please explain to me how you would describe “people who actually use a truck for work”.
"For me it's the single fucking most awesome car I've ever seen. See how that works? By daring to be exciting, they will repel plenty of customers while getting lots of customers who won't even consider an alternative."
"Model Y is ugliest, I like this one, just cus it's not following the current boring trend."
Fucking awful
"Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed and disappointed by Model 3, I think even Elantra looks better. But this is just very embarrassing.

It looks OK, and looks kinda cool, it just... doesn't look very good."
I fucking hope so
"They kinda did it with the Model 3 (widened the trunk area and made the nose less stubby post-unveil), but I have a feeling they're going to stick with this angular design for the most part."
[deleted]
Hopefully
If they start taking orders now they can't really change the look.
Uhhhh pre-orders seem to already be up on the website...
That works for movies but not cars where people are preordering and putting down big down payments
Pre orders are open now.
Preorders are open...
Considering pre-orders are open now I'm going to go with no.
Pre-orders opened by the end of his presentation.  So....(x) doubt
I think they’ll have to
They always do tweak designs before production
The Sonic movie did it.
You can’t even break it! Oh shit
I mean normal glass would shatter
Right?
thats nothing tbf
[deleted]
"I think one thing missing is that it's got an adjustable suspension, you could lower this to a point where you could roll on/roll off cargo. And reaching in the bed would be easy if it weren't at full lifted truck height when you needed it.

I agree that sloped edges are annoying, see the old Ridgeline for an example of that ... But I think I'd be willing to forgive this truck if I could wheel an appliance dolly up the tailgate without an extra ramp or extra set of hands.

Also that 6.5ft bed... There's no wheel wells to cut your bed space, no transfer case or oil pan to puncture on shit on the job site."
Well Said!
"That is how I see it, this was all about functionality for a price and the aesthetics came a distant 2nd.. 

I think Elon sometimes over hypes these events, and people get naturally disappointed..

I will say I hope they can improve the aesthetics slightly....

Some one who genuinely wants  it for work but not be too fussy about the look, specs are great and good value for money..."
The only big thing with me with the truck is you can reach anything inside the bed from the sides. No one wants to climb into the bed just to reach something.
"https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/03_Desktop.jpg

That whole frunk area can be designed to be as strong or as weak as they want it to be.  It can have crumple zones just like any other car."
I think anything that crashes into this will either end up under it or being sent over it like a ramp.
"Yeah, interesting to see how it plays out... I don't want to speak to soon but I have a strong feeling it's not gonna love up to Tesla safety standards"
Can the front and bad bumper still have crumple zone? I think the side being stiff shouldn’t be an issue
Good point. 50's Buicks were this strong on the outside too but the meat inside was the crumple zone.
"I thought of that.  Hopefully there's some kind of workaround.  Offhand, I can't imagine how though."
89 countache
lambo mach-c
"The real reason he made it indestructible, key-proof."
"Thank god it has no paint, keying it is impossible."
This guy gets it!
At some point the futuristic concept needs to actually be built
Obv not work trucks. I don't think Tesla cares about that market segment...they want to force electrification to help mitigate climate change. They're not out to replace all the F-150s of the world. Only the gas-powered ones.
Thanks for reminding me of this! I love it.
Love it lmaoooo
Simpsons did it
Mad Magazine did this back in the 1960s: http://thatsmyskull.blogspot.com/2005/12/mad-magazine-if-kids-designed-their.html
The better Simpsons reference seems to be Homer's car
The next level after level 5 autonomy is a KITT-like AI warning suspect individuals to back off and roasting them with a bult-in not a flamethrower turret if they try to scratch the car.
Gonna wake some Balrogs up....
yes
I’m betting it’ll hit $280
"People always talk about if a new vehicle will have a market for aftermarket mods, a full body mod would make this thing perfect!"
"My guess is that the “armor glass” can only be made in flat plates, and that dictated the design."
Its how it gets up to 500+ miles
I was thinking the same thing. There was no mention of drag coefficient.
They threw a steel ball at it and it just bounced off. Bullet proof glass cracks but doesn’t break. I know they expected it not to crack but even so that’s still great.
The fuel savings alone will make construction companies switch. Not to mention charging stuff.
"In what way would Tesla coming out with a Rivian r1t turn over the truck market? big construction companies are very slow to adopt any new technologies, they will probably not be buying fleets of Rivians either. Blue collar folks in the south are not going to be buying any Tesla vehicle anyway."
"I could see some groups making the switch because gas costs are pretty massive on construction and lawn crews, etc. Biggest issue is lack of extended bed option in my opinion."
On the other hand the video of people trying to key it will be amusing.
They might think you are the cops
"Until we see some collision tests, it’s probably not outlandish to assume the other vehicle is CYBRTRKs crumple zone."
"Super curious about that. I thought old cars were made similarly but they stopped b/c lack of crumple zone means you absorb the energy not the frame. Also the interior (which 100% will get redesigned) looks like it just has a granite counter top lmao

**This should have been a concept, not an actual form**"
I am very interested to see the crash script for this vehicle.
"Yeah, the force will be transferred to the opposing car... you’ll go right through it."
Your body is the crumple zone.
"Asking the real questions. I guess we’ll see once it gets some safety testing done. Can’t imagine there’s been too much of that yet, seeing how well the window demo went."
"It's not future, maybe back to the Future styling. Looks like a bad prototype from the 80's"
This. That truck is ugly. But I NEED a pair of those ATVs.
Please. I want to see what it would look like if they made the triangle a trapezoid.
"Totally agree. Tin foil hat here...what if this design is just a troll. Drum up media attention for a few weeks and then slam dunk the actually design.

No one in there right mind thinks this is an F-150 killer....right?"
Bat mobile
"I think he was trying to make it a bit of everything. Dually’s are great at towing, but not at much else. Off road truck are great at just that. This has double the the towing capacity of a Ford Raptor for example. Not saying that’s a good idea, just that I think that’s what he was going for."
"Personally, I'm more excited about the $40k low price. That puts it in the ""considerable"" range when I start looking for a new car."
"A fully loaded Silverado 1500 is 59,000 and will get 15mpg.  So add 15,000 to 20,000 in gas for 100,000 miles, and it can only tow 9800 pounds.  The Ford f150 is basically the same. Together they sell almost 2 million units a year."
you have link to color renders?
"I completely agree with you, and I’m a big fan of Tesla, solar, electric cars etc.  I’m also in the targeted demographic: middle/class/age male contractor/carpenter.
Elon, please please please, just tweak the body shape a bit.
Lose the overly pointy bits, dystopian bulletproof yadayadayada...
Sincerely, a guy who really wanted to make this his last truck."
"A ton of my friends work in the construction/contracting business--a major demographic for trucks like the F-150, which... I guess should be directly competing with this truck? One of my buddies gets roasted all the time just because he has a topper on his truck (which is literally just a convenient play in that industry, especially in Florida where it rains a lot).  
  
If he showed up to work with this he would get absolutely fucking roasted. This seems like the type of truck that rich LA kids get their parents to buy for them because it looks futuristic and Hollywood. My point being, I would wager the majority of truck buyers in the US would never buy this in a million years, just because they'd be embarrassed to be seen in it."
"I am still waiting for the real truck to be revealed.!! 

All joking aside, this truck will not be delivered till the fall of 2021, spring of 2022?? if so by then, Ford, GM and Dodge will have presented their offerings. I am not sure many people will want to be 'Noticed"" so much that this will be The Truck to have by then. 

I kept waiting to see the added features that make this truck the 'one to have'. Storage compartments, Charge points, Torque vectoring steering, ability to 'kneel' for loads, alas, only one in bed charger.

P.S. bullet Proof glass does shatter, just doesn't allow penetration"
The problem with the hummer is gone though (poor gas mileage and environmental outlook). That’s what ultimately led to its failure and end of the company in the late 2000s
"Your opinion is the majority. As a Tesla owner, if I am ever in the market for a truck, it's going to be a Ford EV or a Rivian."
Learn to appreciate perhaps?
">Can it pull a 5th wheel?

I'll answer that now. No.  The bed design doesn't allow it since its shaped like a damn triangle."
"Production in late 2021 for single and dual motor models, and late 2022 for triple motor AWD. That part is on the webpage.

Interior pics will be posted by the reporters, interior didn’t seem to be like something they wanted to showcase in the presentation.

The presentation was short and sweet, and I don’t mind that at all, as I can just look up the details on the webpage.

Mirrors and windshield wipers are a whole other thing."
Wait why is no one talking about the no side mirrors... I just realized this because of your comment
Late 2022 according to the site.  Don't know about the rest.
"Opposite for me!

First glance was a downer, now I can’t get over how cool it is!"
"I have driven a lot of japanese mini trucks, mostly for camping, snowboarding, and rough logging roads. 91' Isuzu trooper, 86' Toyota 4runner, 92' Suzuki samurai, 85' Nissan 720. The Cybertruck just looks like a aerodynamic version of the common ""box in the wind"" style trucks from those generations. I love the Cybertruck's look. Practical but futuristic."
Are people really tired of the same truck designs? Trucks are the hottest selling segment right now. Guess not?
Well said and username checks out.

"My least favorite part of Tesla reveal events, and they're usually borderline disasters on every level, is the crowd that thinks we're all wanting to hear them.

Usually there's at least one guy who seems to think Elon is having a personal conversation with him."
Hey guys remember the last year of the Avalanche? It was ugly af right?
They don’t bother with mirrors in the reveal. They’re hoping the government will make it legal not to have them bc of rear view cameras.
yep
Please!!!!
Sike!
How did he forget the GD ATV?!?
> www.tesla.com/cybertruck
https://imgur.com/a/eWB0WFq/ this is from the website
They'll probably use cameras as side mirrors
I think the NHSTA is looking into revising those regulation so that cameras can be used instead.
Scratch proof. You just muscle every other car off the road. Optional turrets if they get fiesty.
"Production will.

I don't know no mention of it online"
"In a 4wd car you want the ability for one tire to receive more power than another tire.

In traditional ICE cars this is achieved with complicated gearing and breaking.

With an electric car it's possible to place the source of power directly on the wheel (no driveshaft), which has some significant advantages for off road performance."
"probably two on rear. 

why: rear axel will bear more load when carrying stuff in the bed and during hard acceleration."
"Yes, two in the rear axel. It gives you much more power to the rear wheels. Rivian's truck actually has quad-motor, with two in both axels."
"2 in the rear. The new roadster will have this, as well as the plaid S and X"
Has he ever unveiled a joke
It won’t. No paint is better for the environment. Get it vinyl wrapped
If you go on the website you’ll see that portion of it is on an immovable part
This will outset the rivian. Not f150 though because this won’t appeal to core work crowd.
Rivian?? It's not cool enough and they haven't sold a single car yet
"It looks a LITTLE nicer there because it looks taller.

It does look cool. but the coolness does not offset the ugly. Should be cool and good-looking instead."
No CAD price:/
"That's the CANADA link...

https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck"
"Agreed, only thing I feel looks weird is the pointy pyramid. It would probably look nice with a topper or SUV rear. Maybe less aero though."
"I think 3500 lbs, and 7k to 14k towing depending if single, double or tri motor"
3500 lbs
3500lb
"3,500 lbs"
3500 lbs
"3,500 pounds"
"&#x200B;

yeah 7500# or like 14000# depending on the trim is how much it can tow"
14000 lbs with true motor
"Almost certainly, but helps them gauge initial interest maybe?"
"Based on past launches, you can change it later."
"I mean if you want to shove more money at their faces I’m sure they won’t have too many problems. 

In all likelihood it’s going to be similar to the 3 where this busts places you in a queue and you get to do a final build out later. They just want an initial poll."
"I'm sure it won't be a problem to upgrade later. I mean, you're offering to give them more money.

My brother bought a base Model 3 but upgraded to the long-range version in order to jump the queue and it was no problem at all."
On the website it shows a trailer
They also show the bed turned into a camping tent. I'm curious to see if that will be a real available feature or if it's just a mockup.
How about a trailer with it's own battery... imagine the range :o
"No longer than an F-150.

AKA, pretty long."
232 Inches. So over 19'.
231 inches I believe they said
"I measured the ratio between the bed length and the overall truck length from the specs page, the overall length works out to be about 18.7 ft or 5.7 meters"
I did not. They took my money though! I'll give them a day or two to sort it out. What version did you sign up for?
"Nope sir, but got a number after 5 other charges that went through even though I had errors 😅 Hopefully it wont be too hard to refund those"
nope.
"Nope, just a welcome to Tesla email to create password."
I screen shot the order confirmation number. Waiting for my email.
"No, glad im not the only one. If you have the page still in your history, the end of the URL is your confirmation number in case you didnt catch it."
Not yet...
In the past they've never had an issue with upgrading reservations.
"You can change the configuration later, I’m sure if you want to give them more money they won’t mind :)"
What might cost more?
You get your truck sooner-ish. Elon time sooner-ish tho
"So you can join the threads of people saying ""Yes I preordered"" and posting a pic of the reservation page. 

Seriously though, you'll get it a little sooner but that's about it."
"Conversation starter at work the next day. Tesla is getting paid to have their product advertised, because most people will brag about something they bought."
Your in front of the que to get the truck.
"Get in line earlier, so you'll get an earlier build.  Also presents an unrealistic view of demand, which in this case could delay a redesign."
you get to pay more.
DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIRONMENTS!
"I didn't get an email, and I'm a bit worried I typed it wrong. hopefully just delay in sending out"
look at theverge for a shorter version
It’s the price to get on the waiting list more than a deposit.
They will tweak it for sure but it will look 99% the same. Don’t pay for it expecting a redesign between now and then.
It was on purpose
With less pixels
"Starlink requires a fairly large dish similar in size to a satellite TV dish and movement of the vehicle would likely not work while trying to pick up a signal. 

Last year I wondered if starlink could be used for Tesla cars in the future with an antenna upgrade and the information above was the conclusion of that armchair research. I'm coming from an Internet comment so take it with a grain of salt I found in the armchair cushions."
Front plate completely ruins the look of Model 3. I don't think bigger cars like Model X are affected as much. A truck with sharp corners and flat front will look just fine.
It's my understanding in most states that require a front plate it's only required if the vehicle manufacture had a spot for it.
Except of course for the lunar rover.

Elon freestyles it on stage. I cannot believe for the life of me that any of the words that came out of his mouth today were rehearsed. The presentation was horrible!!!
"PowerPoint seemed out of order. Or maybe something wasn’t working and he had to wing it. 
I agree this was a pretty sloppy presentation"
Take the additional cost that a paint job would cost and get it wrapped to the color of your liking.
No paint
Except it outperforms the Ford in nearly every possible way. So if you can get past the first iteration aesthetics then you have a better product.
With you there!
For the sake of my stocks I’m glad at least several people liked it.
"Already had friends placing their orders, ones previously on the fence about Tesla. I would order but I'm waiting for the roadster for my next car anyway. But I can see my self getting this truck in ~5 years."
"> ds placing their orders, ones previously on the fence about Tesla. I would order but I'm waiting for the roadster for my ne

I like it too.  That being said, I get why some people dont.  It is a very different design, very retro sci-fi 80s in look, which does not seem elegant, but I think is a very cool design.

This is a very polarizing design, which is not shocking since it is so outside the norm.  Love it or hate it.

But I remember the Model 3 getting quite a bit of negative reception too, with many people saying it was ugly as well, especially the interior."
"Seriously?  Would you also buy the electric vehicles back in the 80s and 90s that were also boxy and *sharp* to make themselves look futuristic?  There's a reason Tesla made their electric vehicles look like they do, no one wants stupid looking box cars."
"Cool, you have an opinion and others have opinions."
"https://media.wired.com/photos/593252a1edfced5820d0fa07/master/w_660,c_limit/the-homer-inline4.jpg"
Did you make that up yourself !
I lold hard
Rivian looks like a toy now.
They really did. Not even remotely the same buyers...
"If you were expecting something more traditional looking and was thinking your stock could take a hit on something crazier looking, you should not have owned it. He gave numerous warnings that it wasn't going to look traditional"
"Lol, I hear you...my poor stock too."
That looks better than the real thing
"If you think this will get built in 2-years, you're crazy. They haven't even started building the 2 vehicles they introduced in 2017 and likely won't until at least 2021 (optimistically)."
"I think you'll see appreciation for this truck trickle into the redder areas as well. People appreciate a good tool, as long as it's right for the job."
Maybe but how do you load it up with tools and lumber? Side access looks difficult.  Lumber rack for 16’ lengths?  Not sure this is a construction worker’s truck
I completely agree. Solar power too
Elon said the truck will be used on Mars
No. That's absurd
"Mars vehicle was the first thing that went through my mind. Well, right after *cringe*"
Elon already said a pressurized version of this would be for Mars.
100% you don't want to send an untested vehicle to Mars. This is the perfect QA program ever invented.
That SUV should not have a mustang logo on it...
"100% into it, damn it looks like the future"
"I think it was just so damned unexpected.  I'm sure it looks better in person and will grow on people, but the initial shock of it all expecting it to be more conventional.  I think I get why concept cars are a thing now - gives the manufacturer a chance to gauge public impression before a larger commitment.

That said, I think I'd rather we have things coming to market that aren't focus grouped the fuck into blandness."
We like cars that look good even when they aren’t moving
"This car looks good if it was a movie, and only then"
"Hopefully, but the entry price for this truck is much lower than expected."
Yes no kidding
Doesn't the stock go down after every announcement?
What? With the suspension lowered you can definitely reach into it.
Nope. This is priced right and will sell well. It will have significant appeal. Not to work folks but to adventurous people and those who just want a sport truck.
The tailgate ramp is the only good thing.
What do you mean?
Why can’t you?
"Tesla can't produce 1m+ trucks per year anytime soon. With the truck, It doesn't need a huge market share to be successful."
"No, you're right on the money. I don't see this appealing to the folks of Houston and Dallas who drive their F-150s to the office, the job site, and date night. This truck is just way to polarizing.

Ford has done a great job with the F-series because their trucks can do everything. An F-150 Lariat looks right at home on a construction site and at a nice restaurant downtown. 

Cybertruck looks like it belongs on Mars. And I don't think that's a good thing."
"Doesn’t it have similar bed size, space and a low operating cost? It would seem to be ideal if you need a truck for business and the “Tesla” features seem to only add to that."
What basic needs do you feel like it couldn’t satisfy?
"What are you talking about?

The truck is strictly better specs than all the competition at a better price. Built in generator that runs off of electricity which is cheaper than gas. Lower cost of ownership. 

It’s you who has bought into strictly the hype when the trucks specs alone make it the best on the market to actually get shit done. 

This can even be used as a military style vehicle and will likely be used as a transport for celebrities and politicians."
"This would be awful if you were a paver, mason, or landscaping guy. You have one point of entry into the bed. You can't load and unload from all angles. It's stupid and doesn't fulfil the first ask of a pickup truck."
"Nah, you've misjudged the market. 60% of all truck sales are urban cowboys who *might* have a boat. People use trucks as luxury commuter status symbols right now, and this is a Hummer tier status symbol."
This is for those who work tech jobs and buy a Tacoma for camping and their 10 mile work commute
"There are work trucks, and then there are lifestyle trucks. It’s obvious Tesla is going for a lifestyle truck here."
"I honestly don't think many people will be picking it up for any kind of utility, at least not any more than they could get out of any SUV with decent trunk space."
"It can haul 3500 lbs. that’s almost 2 tons of lumber, tools, etc... it has a ramp built in. And a roll up tonneau. A built in air compressor and 110/220v outlets. 

For contractors, It’s dripping with practical functionality. But it’s still ugly af tho."
[deleted]
"yeah but it has tools and utilities that will get the job done, and contractors may also not care that the design is edgy, they might even like it because it's eye catching.. and super fast"
"One of the replies here was from a builder and contractor says he likes it. The bed is big and you can probably load long things(like studs)  to lay against the roof. 

I am reserving my judgment till I get to see it in person. I think the weird appearance is throwing people of the actual dimensions."
"They don’t have to buy it? 

They’ll have enough demand to constantly be busy. 
."
I don’t expect we will see it on a lot of job sites.
"It's not going to appeal. It's too weird. 

I'm going to redesign the motherfucker this weekend, it's my new project.

I did pretty good in an industrial design competition without many a year ago... Gonna give my new and improved fundamentals a shot.

I can see in my head of what the truck needs to be. They need to take the design language of the truck and put it into a new Tesla car and make it this city-dwellers vehicle.

My solution to making the truck look futuristic and making the truck of appeal to blue collar workers is to make it militaristic. Many blue collar people are also former military and also tend to appreciate military aesthetics.

Definitely going to design something, it will be based off of what they have, but I will give it a square topper that is built in, retractable and which can angle itself down, but it will not be so steep of an angle. The top will also be a bit flat. The front windshield won't extend so far and I'm going to take the nose up a few inches to a foot higher to make it look meaner."
Wtf is this monster?  Not even a good monster?
Seriously. They went full DeLorean in 2019
It’s on the website
"Motortrend has photos of interior. 

 [https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/cybertruck/2021/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info/](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/cybertruck/2021/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info/)"
Great point. “Truck guys” will not buy this. It’s not going to replace the classic truck.
Have you seen a ford lately?  They lost any sense of style 30 years ago.
None of the cars ever do. They are added on when production starts. Tesla wants to eventually go mirrorless
That my big question. Doesn't every car need side mirrors by US law?
"None of the concept cars do. Since the law requires them, the real thing will"
"I was wondering why the triangle by the A-pillar existed... it has to be cameras to replace side mirrors. There were also no noticeable cameras on the body. Also probably part of the reason the truck looks a bit off (aside from the very obvious), vehicles look odd without mirrors."
"it's growing on me, but just like batman I need it in black."
My thoughts 100%
expeditions?
F
F
where'd you get the image?
Probably alcantara...
Those seats look miserable for any real period of time
So indestructible it doesn’t even need seatbelts 😂😂
"But it can't look this different. MAYA= Most advanced, yet acceptable. This is not acceptable for many because it's too ""advanced"" looking- especially for most pickup buyers."
You can make something look different AND look good though.
Maybe anodized colors?
Nope. Just steel
Nope. This or vinyl wraps.
dat price
Even more cringey they all dressed like cyberpunks
"Honestly I thnk its the complete opposite.  Watch them when they take the ball up high.  They actually open the clamps on the glass.  This lets it bounce which dissipates a lot of the energy.

-Actually nevermind. I watched again.  They are just retightening them every time."
"Makes sense since after seeing a test ride video, the are sticking with frameless windows."
"Yeah, I don't see why you'd want unbreakable side glass anyway. How do you get people out when the door is jammed in an accident? Only the windshield needs to be indestructible."
I was thinking rappers are going to flock to this shit
"I described it as a Delorian and a hummer bumped uglies.

I personally love it, and if this raise goes through, I may order one."
I feel like those who like this truck may never have actually needed to use a truck before...or at least the truck bed.  Are you primarily looking for a truck for towing purposes?
Definitely heading toward Ark II territory [https://live.staticflickr.com/3248/2880700973\_5d25f866ce\_z.jpg](https://live.staticflickr.com/3248/2880700973_5d25f866ce_z.jpg)
This truck would be like those shoes if those shoes were still in the box.
I love it. Gives me that PlayStation 1 background cars still loading feel. Lol
"Not alone!! Already pre-ordered, lol"
"Only shell is bulletproof, not the glass (from what I understand)"
"You don’t fit in an F-150? I’m 6’3” and I feel small in the cab of full size Fords. Super Duty’s even more so. Can’t speak to your body type...I’m relatively slender, so that obviously impacts my experience."
"I think Hummers are ugly, but they are the right kind of ugly. This will be the futuristic, eco-friendly Hummer of 2020 and beyond."
"Well you may not need resistance against bullets, but you may not ever get cracks in the windows from flying rocks on the highway."
It's so damn gross
God it's sooo bad. How did this happen?
"Your mom created you, so no"
That weird Jeep truck combo is easily the ugliest truck in the history of humans.
"I thought the 3 was going to be my next car, but this is very likely a better option for me, I don't need more than the base level."
It’s $100 to order
It’s only $100 deposit
"I was going to get the Model Y, but seeing the real life photos from motortrend sold me. This thing looks awesome"
I legitimately thought it was a joke and they were going to roll on the real truck. Fugly.
This
Sounds like a keeper
Is there a pun I'm not getting with that owl?
May the odds be in your favor
Look at the rivian. That shit is dope and futuristic but some fifth element funky future look
Lack of 5th wheel capability kills it for me.
"No 4-wheel drive either, so it would be worthless, if not dangerous, where I live. I guess it’s for people who want a truck but have no actual use for one. Very disappointing."
If this had a normal body it would be a huge seller. The specs are seriously impressive. But they had to ruin it with the crazy look.
It’s a disaster
Sike!
LOL!
Underrated comment
One can hope
Here’s hoping. I was legit ready to spend ~65k. My truck is not what I want and I thought this would be good. But no.
As someone who actually works in construction they would use the utility function of a truck like this.... not having an 8’ bed for full sheets is kind of a nonstarter.  At least have some flip up posts when the beds down to hold 10-20 of the sheets in or something.
That bed is not functional. Remove the angled side panels
could have done literally all of that without being ugly as ever loving fuck
It's priced to sell. This is a great opportunity for Rivian/Ford to become players in electric market.  Maybe it wouldn't be so off putting if it was in all black or all white.  They should be putting something mass market to kick Chevy and Ford in the balls.
What if the crazy future truck is the new normal? 95% of trucks I see everyday have nothing in the box or a cover/topper and aren't towing a damn thing.
My exact thoughts. This is like the dessert. They need to do a normal truck first
Yea the whole point of tesla and elons vision is a compelling electric car people want that's not a weird retro future concept. And this.. is a weird retro fiture concept no one wants.
"It looks like this:

https://flashbak.com/the-1980-citroen-karin-reimagines-the-car-as-futuristic-sci-fi-masterpiece-407047/"
Halo's warthog if it were rendered on a Super Nintendo.
As a college senior my exact thoughts. This looks like our foam core models at the end of a design semester 😂
They blew their whole budget with the cyber punk shit
It was very hard to watch.
"Totally. Wife says it’s amazing, kids seem to love it too, so let’s send er bud"
"Yeah. After reading all the shitposts in this thread, thinking about ordering it now instead of waiting. I don't need a truck now, but I kind of want it."
I actually do
"I kept waiting for him to end the joke and reveal the real actual truck, but the joke never ended."
I currently drive a model3 and would switch to this one instantly! It feels straight out of a sci-fi movie. Love it!
"i just want the ATV, in a street legal design."
I would definitely drive this thing
People are stuck to the status quo. Imagine thinking this truck is uglier than a Toyota mini van...
"Yeah I liked it.  It’s new and different.  People are always afraid of new things.  It’s always been that way. Always will be.  I like it but I don’t really care about design. I’m looking for price, reliability, durability and functionality.  It checks all those boxes for me."
The presentation had the worst possible angle for the entry video
"Yeah it really makes me wonder...  I preordered though, that's all I can do."
"the side profile and back are kind of ugly to me, but I like the front"
Relevant username
"That's a super realistic render, even the windows look cracked."
I love the fact that they used PlayStation One’s to render it.
I could live with the design if it fixed the access to the bed from the side. Everything else looks good to me.
"Exactly. If Elon wants to bring sustainability to the pickup truck market, he should build an actual pickup truck."
100% agreed. The bed screams Ridgeline.
"That was my first thought too, the 1st gen ridgeline is a good vehicle, but simply doesn’t cut it as a truck. This will be the same way. Can’t reach a cooler, or mount a 5th wheel hitch."
But it has a frunk.. won't that compasate for the 3' bed wall
"To be fair, this is exactly what Tesla have been telling everyone it would be like since day one"
"We haven't seen enough of it to decide on it's practicality, but I think we've seen enough to decide it's butt ugly :\"

I don’t see it on the website. Link?
Glass is glass and glass does break...
"Around 25 minutes in. My god that sank my heart. 

Looks like tesla stock will be on sale tomorrow"
He's the lead designer at Tesla. He's already infamous lol
Someone needs to post it on /r/cringe
That’s Franz lol
"""that guy"" is their chief of design"
That guy is Franz von Holzhausen lmao I think he’ll be alright
He made sure that Elon actually wanted him to throw it. Perhaps he knew that something was wrong or knew the demo truck had regular windows?
"Franz? Yeah, he designed the Roadster.. and this?"
Fucking Hans
"I expected him to stop halfway and say ""Just kidding"" and bust out the actual truck."
"And exterior mirrors, autopilot cameras, tail lights"
You don’t need them if the glass breaks
Aztec was ahead of its time.  I think it’d do better today with slightly enhanced styling.
" [https://imgur.com/a/oRxsfkc](https://imgur.com/a/oRxsfkc) 

From the website"
"I think it’s because how they had the glass mounted on the demonstration.  I noticed the clamps weren’t clamped down on the glass, allowing it to flex and deflect the energy back. Sort of like bouncing the ball back, whereas on the truck the window was rigid and took the whole force, causing it to break."
"The demo glass that they dropped the ball onto was a big sheet that could flex a lot, and was just held with clamps. I think the window glass broke because it was smaller, and probably more rigid based on how it was installed on the truck door, so it had a lot less flex."
I kind of feel like that’s what happened. The glass needs to still be easy to break for safety reasons (in case you’re trapped).
"In the height demo, they release clamps for the higher drops so the pane can flex freely and doesn’t stress the glass as much. The whole pane bounces a bit too. For the truck, the window frame reflects that energy back into the glass and the stress is concentrated."
"> It looked like he dropped the ball 

He dropped the ball alright"
Same. Hope you screenshot your order #!
I haven’t gotten one either. Hoping I see a yes somewhere.
"Same here, got charged 3 times for one order too."
Ford did it!
"Unlikely that they did something like that without Elon or the lead designer knowing when it clearly was the only truck they brought that night, and might be the only one they have ever made."
Possible but highly unlikely...I just don’t think this presentation went well really. You could tell Elon was disappointed after the glass broke. Twice.
"I'm confused about mentioning ""metal glass"" and then the normal looking way that shattered.  I'd expect something different, but maybe that's just a bad assumption."
"I’m pretty sure the demo was supposed to be done in the windshield, not the side glass. Don’t know how they could screw up one thing so simple but it’s the most logical explanation."
link?
"I didn't vote because I'm on the fence about it. It struck me as really ugly at first glance, but I do like the bravery of putting a design like that out there, and it's grown on me a little. It may grow on me more."
"the design is a wide question. I like the specs, the dynamic ride height, the stainless steel. I don't like the long, slanted front end and the inability to connect the bed to the cabin. I don't mind it being angular, I just don't want the long windshield"
"Roughly half and half. 

I liked it but don’t see it practical for a big city. I don’t know who the target consumer is. Who wants an indestructible tank? I would but in a city it wouldn’t work."
"Great idea of a poll, just keep in mind what subreddit you are in...   these numbers shouldn't be taken to reflect the population as a whole"
How long did it take? Still haven’t gotten mine and payment went through 3 times cause the mobile site was whack
"Brilliant designers.  And like new design, hated by many"
"Yeah, as someone who loves the whole Cyberpunk aesthetic in games/movies/comics this truck is really edging that side of me."
Me roo
"This won’t come out , they will redo the design and push it back 3 more years"
"Idk what other people are saying, I really love the design and want to get one"
"I like it a lot, I'm going to try to convince my parents to get it for themselves as their in need of a new vehicle and want a Tesla. The price is surprisingly good."
It's exactly this! It's so bad.
He works when they don't test things that fail in front of everyone to see.  He didn't even know how to act after that glass shattered.  Probably most other presenters won't know how to act either.  That's a really bad look.
It's been working out for them all the other times.
Have one of the engineering leads talk about some of the specs. Or... something
Then Tesla would just be another boring auto company.
"Never really heard a presentation from him before. That being said I know he has done many and I can easily say, he has not improved. If he has, dear lord."
I 100% agree
This looks like a low graphics render of the original warthog from Halo in 2001
Looks like it was designed by Homer Simpson
Was hyped for this and am shocked it is worse than the renderings. Why in the heck is this?
"Agreed. There is some basic shape choice that was committed to early on in the process, which has broken the uncanny valley of what we expect for a truck aesthetic. The this is uncomfortable to look at. Like something the Grand Tour would weld together as a gag gift for Enzo Ferrari’s 50th wedding anniversary."
dont buy it then
Ok it’s ugly but that’s just mean
"""I don't like drastic changes in design!!!""

-you"
Ok boomer
I was a kid at the time but I always liked the look of the aztek except for the rear bumper part. I know I’m in the extreme minority lol.
I loved it. Just like blade runner
I thought it was interesting. It didn’t last long enough to be cringey
[deleted]
Pure Elon. This is the shit that gets other CEOs fired
"Holy shit, everyone forgot about that. I agree 100%"
So much gestures
The glass breaking was the cringiest. I love Elon though
I thought it was Grimes?
Yep lol I was like “this shit better be good”
Grimes sure did a number on Elon.
I wondered for a minute if that was his way of giving his girlfriend a job. Or some promotion. But I don't know if he is still dating the singer? Girl.
Really? It's half the price of the rivian and shits on the specs.
"I would definitely buy this over Rivian if looks is the main thing. I can get over the dorky Rivian headlights, Its headlights remind me with toy trucks. 

But on functionality it beats Rivian on many levels. But I see why would some people prefer Rivian over this."
please god
Haha.  Probably.  They definitely will get a lot of buyers who are turned off by the design.  The tesla is riskier. Maybe it pays off.
You think it's actually coming out.... lol
"Yeah, I think this sub is mostly car owners, and people with Tesla stock. Not your average cyberpunk-appreciating crowd. It's okay, they don't get it."
There are plenty of ways to make “cool” cyber vehicles. This looks like the 0.3 beta version of the prototype of the actual release.  Not only does the design look off it looks like it isn’t even complete.
"while the other tesla cars don't stand out to other cars, I think most people find their design pleasing,

I also thought that the truck design will grow on people, however this design isn't thought through imo. Looks like an early version instead of the final product. Could've made a great product with a similar design but this one won't sell well"
"It’s way far out there, which is about what I expected. 


I’ve hated all the renders, but I somehow like it?"
I would have bought it if it looked more normal. Specs are nice but it looks dumb.
No. Fuck all the trucks out there. They all look the same. Elon is right on the money. This truck will stand out. It will turn heads. Who wants a boring ass truck when it can look bad ass?  Only time will tell. But people hated the model s with no grill. The model 3 with no dash. And now they love all that. People will become accustomed to it and other trucks will look incredibly bland and old by comparison.
"I’m feeling all the same things. I wish it had the same mainstream appeal that the rest of their cars do. Small innovations sure, but this is so radical, I worry about them investing too much into something that won’t sell.
What do I know though, my wife loves it somehow."
"Exactly what I was thinking. Design is way too striking and not in a good way. Tesla's other cars look (mostly) like what you'd expect cars in the future to look like. This truck looks like what movies in the 80's and 90's thought cars were gonna look like in the future.

I could be totally wrong but I have a feeling this one's gonna be a flop."
"I agree, the design has a hint of the DeLorean about it and not in a good way, let’s hope it doesn’t reach the same fate."
Yeah! you tell em. Tesla should go ahead and scrap this whole project.
"Hey! I drive an '05 Ridgeline, and even it isn't as angular as the CyberTruck..."
[I thought of this right away.](https://images.app.goo.gl/pY6BnAYsBiGv6Giy8)
"I dunno, I love the aesthetic."
This is genuinely ugly though...Looks like something from back to the future. All of Tesla's cars have sexy curves...this is a box.
"I literally don't want to buy a Tesla anymore. 

Edit: I'm being downvoted and called  a peasant, but honestly after watching this ""unveiling"" I've lost a ton of respect for Elon Musk. And can't see myself buying from a company that approved this. 1"
It's super ugly but the specs are there. I'm torn
"As much as I dislike Rivian's headlight design, their products are really elegant compared to Cybertruck."
All they had to do was copy the Rivian in Tesla styling. Would have been so easy
The Cybertruck doesn't have that super useful Corpse-Hatch that the Rivian has.  I love that.   So many corpses to haul and never a good place to keep 'em.
HAHAHAHAHA
"Same.  This one was the best IMO.

"You can’t safely stop with that much weight behind you.


Towing isn’t about pulling, it’s about stopping."
"He said that before he actually had considered what tow rating means.  It's mostly driven by braking power, because you need to be able to stop safely in a reasonable distance."
I love the price and would totally put down $100 for the stats on that triple motor. The look? Nope nope nope. Ford raptor for me.
Those are from tesla.com/cybertruck and they’re renders
So does the website.
It's the same exact picture as the one on tesla.com/cybertruck
All of those are from the main site: https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck
"For their sake, I hope so."
As another user remarked it has sick DeLorean vibes.
One has to go back to the future to realize this.
One has to go back to the future to realize this.
"I hate all new modern vehicles because they all have ridiculous blind spots that they just try to compensate for with cameras. I'm used to being able to turn my head and being able to see 360 degrees with a reasonable amount of unobstruction. I barely trust my mirrors because of the blind spots that they inherently have as well, I always drive with my head on a swivel and therefore hate restricted vision."
I wonder how people will get out in case of accident when the doors are stuck or it’s on fire or drowning. Jaws of life might have a problem with it too
Cameras
why do you have to put hashtag there?
"But how would they hide in plain sight with this? In my hometown, which is fairly small, the police have ford SUV's and pickups that are black with hidden lights and the police identification on the cars is a dark gray on black paint."
Doesn’t sit Idlying for hours except when you’re back from patrol and it needs to charge for 6 hours.
"> I think we’re looking at America’s next police cruise

It'd sure as heck make it easier to recognize unmarked vehicles"
If the shatterproof glass demo is indicative of the bulletproof claims then I would be worried.  Also cops do tend to sit in their vehicles idling a lot and if you added all the extra electronics I would be curious what the battery/range really would be under those conditions.
"Rust proof?  AFAIK it's just the body that is stainless, not the chassis or suspension components."
"I think this is the most sensible option. Similar to how JEEP was originally a military vehicle. 


Like there's no way this is marketed towards regular truck owners. It looks ridiculous.. but in an industrial kinda unique way? 

It even looks like a God damn space rover. Like cmon"
"It’s clearly not capable of being pressurized.

This is just a step too far."
I feel so bad
The smaller semi will have the flexibility you are looking for. It would make a great RV.
What percentage of F150 owners do this. 1%?
"Are you kidding me? The Cybertruck is the ultimate vehicle of versatility.... built with the durability of a tank, able to haul more than an F-150, can beat a Porshe on the race track, can go off-roading better than probably any typical vehicle and possibly off-roading vehicles as well with that adaptive air suspension (that generates power), built in ramp for loading, built in bed shell, multiple built in light bars.... I mean what vehicle has more promise to LEAD in so many areas than the Cybertruck? This thing is versatile, my dude.  


edit: oh yeah, you're right.. it also seems pretty luxurious in the cab. I also forgot to mention camping uses... you get the point."
"The sides are removable, there was a picture showing it during the presentation. Same functionality as a traditional truck but better aero."
Just the glass guy.
On stage demos are never good.

Have you tried to grab something from the sides of a raptor or new ram? That's already impossible for anyone except basketball players.
"I hate to break it to you, but most people can't reach over a full size pickup bed."
"By authentic, you simply mean “comfort zone”? The Rivian literally looks like every pick up out there, but designed by Volvo."
"> How are you ever gonna grab something out of it from the sides?

I'm not someone who needs a truck to constantly grab tools from; however that's obviously the chief reason ~~for by~~ to buy such a truck, in general. So you are spot on about this being a flaw. 

But I think you mean to say this is a case of ""aesthetics over function"" ... for design is something you do to take in both aesthetics and function.

Anyway we could think of any number of design alternatives that would make access to tools far easier (while still having quite a deep tray)."
Obviously this isn't a working person's truck. The sloped bed rails are super inconvenient for many things trucks are used for. You can't even replace the bed with a flatbed.
You hang out with Joe Rogan ONE time...
Expensive weed
Agreed
That’s normal for Elon ...like watching the nervous kid in class give a presentation
Is this your first reveal? He sounds the same as he always sounds.
"Agreed. Bought a $40k gently used pickup last year. Give me an eveny remotely familiar form factor in this segment and I would have plunked down money on my next truck to be a Tesla.

Knew I should've bought Rivian stock before this reveal.....dangit."
"Yeah, that's gonna be a ""No"" from me, dawg"
I probably wouldn't hate it if the roof at least had 1-2 more angles.
You know it’s bad when literally any one of the fan renders turns out to look so much better
Crumbling is important for passenger safety though
"> No more rust .

How do you figure? The whole thing is steel."
Did not know they were interning 10 year olds
Doubt it was Franz
A monkey with a ruler?
A PlayStation 1.
"Same, reserved it since I can actually afford the cybertruck (plus it would be a work car)"
"Right, because you went from $250K vehicle to $50K vehicle.... okkk buddy..."
"This, 100% 😂😂"
Keep looking at it. My first thought was WTF. But the more I look at the pictures I start to go hmmmm
Some of the best trucks ever made are ugly.
">	It's fucking ugly, man.

I’m going to start here because I agree... I think... idk how I feel but it’s certainly not pleasing for me.

>	It would be the responsible decision. It wouldn't be my favourite toy, it would just be an excellent tool.

I think this is a bit premature. It can beat a Porsche isn’t what I care as a truck owner. What I care is capability and that really wasn’t shown. Can it four wheel? It has reasonable towing but can it handle hills? Can it take a goose neck or fifth wheel of any size since it lacks frame rails? How’s it handle mud?

All of that can fall into the tool category too but if it’s a well performing truck I think it could certainly be a top notch toy even if I’m still not sure about its styling."
"Not sure how many times he’s had to say people probably won’t like the futuristic look, but I’m ready for this kind of forward thinking and some change."
I just wanted a bed that allows me to load stuff in over the sides. I feel like that's pickup 101.
"While the design is more extreme than I was expecting, I can't understand why so many people hate it."
"Just because people want something different, doesn’t people people want something they don’t like. Don’t know why this is hard to understand"
I’m with you. Also a truck that won’t scratch or sent & has six seats.
It's objectively ugly man.
Sounds like Tesla could have dragged a pile of actual shit on stage and you’d still defend it.
Sure but it still looks terrible.
Me too! When it first drove out I was like WTF is this!? But by the end of the stream I was thinking it might not be as bad as I thought
Same. And it’s so functional ...
I have to imagine another truck design is underway as well
EXACTLY what I said to my wife when that thing roled on the screen. I said I drew that in 1st grade. I was honestly waiting for Elon to say....GOTCHA
"Racks will surely be made for it. This will be something contractors buy, if they care more about utility than aesthetics."
Very true!
"He fired shots at the F-150. I’d say that’s the bar, not hummer."
"Because it looked **MANLY**, i doubt it's comparable (not that I like Hummer)"
F
F
F
"I don’t care about specs. If I don’t enjoy how my vehicles aesthetics, i’m not driving it"
People who actually use their truck will not buy this because they need is not functional
"Definitely wasn't intentional, the look on Elon's face said so. He was pissed off."
"I thought that is when he was going to say ""bring the real car"""
"Worried that Franz broke them intentionally but Elon wasn't expecting it. Think he said ""Oh my fucking God"" when they broke the first time and then just seemed uncomfortable when Franz kept asking to try the other window too"
"They are not entering this market early. In fact, they will probably be very late."
i've got some bad news
Ditto
"It definitely doesn't look good,  but it's clear to anyone with a brain that this thing can do everything a regular pickup can and then some"
"I use to be the one cutting the lumber to size, can confirm."
"Uggs were fugly too. But once a celebrity is seen wearing these, lots of other people started buying one too."
[deleted]
"it is ugly as hell when i first saw it but when i realized the engineering considerations behind the shape, i think they must've thought very carefully about. to them, this might be a paradigm shift in car manufacturing. let's see if it pans out."
"> all the current cars look the same

Nah, they really don't, except SUVs in Volkswagen AG."
Let me put 35 KO2s on and I might just die
And some low range axles
I believe Elon said 16 inch clearance
"You don't think that'll be standard at a minimum? My Raptor rolls on 34s with slightly over 11"" of clearance."
It drove onto the stage
"If I recall correctly he once claimed 300,000"
[deleted]
They did say ages ago it was going to be controversial and was not intended to be a traditional mass market pickup but more of an experiment. I remember elon tweeting that if this version doesn't get all that popular they will do a more traditional one in the future.
Come on...
"yeah, i agree - initially I was shocked at the design.

But I think that's just because it's a new design. It's unlike anything we've ever seen. The more I look at it the more I like it."
"Well, yeah. That I would look into buying. Now I wish I had bought Rivian stock. I'm sure the hollywood elites and saudi princes will buy one, but my first impression is really not good."
Truckla looks way better imo
I was expecting a mini version of their Tractor.
I was expecting something like model x.
Cameras
This is going to sell very well in America definitely
lol. What was that?!!!
Pretty sure that was Elons real girlfriend.
Yea I originally had the tri-motor ordered but switched it to the dual-motor not wanting to wait another year (or more) for it. Figure I can get a couple years out of the dual before upgrading if I still feel the need to.
Wait what?  How did you find that out?  I got a reservation number but no email confirmation or any delivery date info and I keep hitting refresh haha
Other than the resemblance?
Which leaves the question what was the delorean release like?
[deleted]
"Don’t believe so. This is going to be a unibody with no frame. The angle in the back down the bed is a buttress for structural purposes. See the first gen Honda Ridgeline and Chevy Avalanche, those funny looking sides are structurally important to the chassis. If you look at the launch of the second gen Honda Ridgeline there is a ton of press how they went through a ton of engineering to make it look like a normal truck bed."
"> Is the tray detachable?

There is no tray. It's not a body bolted to a frame. It's an exoskeleton so the outer frame is load bearing structure."
"Yeah, I mean as someone who's driven a tundra for a decade I honestly really do like the design.

However, they're missing out on a HUGE sector of the population that truly use trucks for their utility. Campers, workstations, cargo beds, etc in place of the tray... those are literally their own sizeable sub-industries.

Hopefully this is the ""sexy wow"" vehicle that's going for shock value and publicity and then they'll roll out a more basic truck to serve the needs of tradespeople and campers."
I agree
Ye olden games lol. Nailed it. Yakima and Thule engineers are as we speak cracking open text books to figure out how tf to build a roof rack.
"From a practical standpoint, thous would be useless for any joiner or plumber or anyone else that needs to put long stuff that doesn't fit in the bed somewhere - usually, you'd put it on the roof. Tesla seems to hate roof racks for some reason (aero, probably, but at least make it possible!)"
First gen Lara Croft boobies
I’m hoping we can reserve the cyberquad
Electric affordable ATVs and utvs actually low key sounds like an untapped niche but very exuberant market
"Yeah, it’s super cyber punk butt fugly. It’s a Delorean with better guts. Please don’t trickle this look down through the rest of the line."
Where did you get the photos if you're getting cozy at home?
Can probably chromecast it no matter what
Doesn't spacex use youtube for live streams?  I wouldn't be surprised if they use one for this.
Just a 6' diameter Qi charger in the garage
Tesla avoids wireless solutions due to it conflicting with their company policy of maximizing efficiency.

"It’s sad too.  I know some people don’t like apple, but their presentations are polished and it made for good TV to watch after work.  This presentation is so terrible, the product is so terrible, that clearly they haven’t learned to have some level of discipline.

This truck is a shit show unless it’s all an elaborate joke."
"Modern digital cammo wrap. Maybe black, grey, white"
"This is what I'm saying. wait until we see the new renders with paint jobs and actual, nice wheels, back racks  etc. He basically said this is the basic basic model. Like, no options at all"
"Those flat surfaces would be easy to wrap, too. Except, the panels are all stainless steel. Wrap material is designed to adhere to painted surfaces, not anything with texture, and CR SS likely has enough texture to cause problems."
"Wait you were actually able to complete the reservation?    


I had serious doubts about this being real.  The Cybertrk page looks way less professional than the rest of the website.  But if they took your money...... Jesus."
"It is not. The $2,500 down payment was before, but not the $100 order."
"yes, same thing, i had already preordered the rivian but went ahead and got in line incase i change my mind"
No it’s not actually
Well just checked the pre order agreement. It says it is fully refundable.
"Why the hell js the Y still $2,500? Lol"
"Yes it's refundable, says so in the order page."
[deleted]
Nope it worked when the ATV drove up
Looks like it
Felt like it.
Thank you for this.
"That’s what I paid for a loaded Model 3 Performance, and it’s faster than that and has 200 miles more range. The specs alone on the truck are phenomenal! I think the front and back look sweet, but it’s the side that gets me."
"yeah, least you'll be able to get off the job site in under 5 seconds so you don't hear your friends laughing.

Just kidding :)"
I pre-ordered the RWD version. Think there's a way to upgrade the reservation to tri-motor?
This got old fast. People please stop repeating the same boring joke 4000 times.
Elon's approach to pedestrian safety: Liquefy Them.
But they specifically want this to be an F-150 killer. It has to be a work truck to so that...
">	Of course, its not going to ever be an actual work truck.

Why do you think that?  I know a guy that does construction in his $65,000 ford.  Trucks can get expensive.  Especially when you need to tow big items, and need room for others.

Maybe you weren’t referencing the cost though."
I don't it's too flat and slopes in the back
Because it’s ugly
Oof. Dude I want whatever you are smoking.
He’s not going to have any capital to develop a real truck if that’s the plan
"I hope you’re right. Maybe the window breaking was staged... It’d be easier to accept if it was.

I hope Elon doesn’t kill himself tonight. God knows I would if I had to stand next to that window the whole presentation."
"Oh, it’s going to crater."
"It's up a ton recently after the earnings report, & could've been had at around $215 not too long ago."
"For sure, I’ve bought low a couple times now and it’s because Tesla stock dips so much based on Elon doing a poor job communicating, he shouldn’t even be the presenter, obviously.

They have some great products like the model 3 and y that are the bread and butter, the factories are taking off and due to that they should continue to grow and sale some models well."
"I’m not sure how to answer that right now. This might have lost them the lead for a while. 

They had the momentum!!"
My thoughts exactly. Lay off the weed elon.
"haha thinking the same. Is this the moment to invest $20,000"
"Love it or hate it, its function over form.  THe panels and glass are all flat.  That means simple and cheap to produce.  Thats how it starts at $40k."
"This is a niche product in the lineup, although Elon went way to hard with ""we need a truck"" at the beginning.  If this was an electric F150 that would have made sense."
"I’ll buy. This is a military contract. 

The military will order millions"
Tesla needs a presentation team without Elon sadly.
"I like it. I'm usually harsh on new designs but this is perfectly avant garde for a groundbreaking vehicle. Once the memes die off and this thing gets released, rich kids everywhere will be dying to be seen with one."
"Yes but it's not a lamborghini. Its a truck. They really needed to put something out that appeals to the masses. Not a select few. I'm a huge Tesla guy and shareholder, but if this is the truck that rolls of the line, the design is a huge swing and a miss."
"If you squint your eyes hard, it still looks ugly"
"Dude I'm a huge tesla fan but this looks horrible not gonna lie

Like, horrible horrible"
🔥🔥🔥
Minecraft playing designers smoking really good pot?
hahahaha best comment
As a stock holder I feel $30 drop is a very positive assumption
"Didn't even think about that, but that's a pretty good point."

[deleted]
Like the lady robot in wall-e.
The interior shots on the site sold it for me. Trucks have some of the worst cockpits of any vehicle. It just looks so damn clean.
just because you like the ugly ass truck doesn't mean you're not the same level of armchair automotive designer as they are.
"https://www.techbyte.sk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/tesla-pickup-696x431.jpg

This is infinitely better looking.  Anyone caught driving this joke will cause wrecks from people laughing at how ridiculous it is."
It looks awful and belongs in the 80s and 90s where electric vehicles failed.
"In black it would look like a stealth bomber. That would be sweet. 

I can totally see why people think it's hideous. I dig it though"
"This isn't the future of trucks, this is an Elon midlife crisis. Rivian has a much better truck that this."
"Bro from one of the biggest Tesla fans, from back in 2012...this is the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen. Like it’s comparable to the Nissan Juke in terms of how fucking ugly and unbalanced the design is."
😂😂😂😂
I'm glad they made a truck...but you will not see some midwestern redneck driving this thing.  I grew up in NE and can vouch for that.
Rivian is doing a much better job of that rn
"The bed is unusable for actual utility, angled side walls are the stupidest shit ever on a truck."
I love it and reserved already also!
I agree!
"Your opinion is bad and you should feel bad /s

But are you really going to put down a day 1 deposit?

Nevermind. It's $100. Feel free to get your name on the list.

There are advantages to having a unique vehicle!"
[deleted]
"I agree, this overall negative reaction is change shock. That truck is amazing. It’s evolutionary. I can’t wait to see how owners customize them."
"Its literally a civilian APC, fucking awesome"
Same I laughed at first but by the end It grew on me. Gonna sleep on it and see tomorrow
Steering wheel is also illegal in the US. This design will clearly be changing a bit between now and when its being delivered.
[deleted]
They never said the glass was bulletproof.
"Man, I love a good conspiracy theory...

But, they’re taking pre-orders."
"They are accepting payment for it, right now, online. It’s real."
"I hope you’re right, but they’re running out of time to say it’s a joke.  Stock market opens tomorrow morning and I’d expect a shitton of shorting."
"You know he’s making a giant rocket with stainless steel, right?  Whoosh."
"The new roadster didn’t have mirrors either.  I think this is the fine line that they are walking...  Manufacturers are required to install mirrors.  Owners are not necessarily required to keep them.  The idea is that owners can remove them after the fact....

But I wouldn’t take the mirrors off.  44 years of muscle memory is hard to over come.  I’d always be checking the mirror location."
There is ZERO chance this is fake as they are accepting deposits.
"Yeah, and I thought the renders were bad. WTF"
"If you want traditional I'm sure you can find that at Ford, Dodge, or Chevy..."
Looks worse...
Nope. Didn’t fix it
i like this
"...

.....

..........Did you tho?"
That makes it look about a hundred times better.
Haha.
"i hate to agree with you on this, but trucks are a working market, not a style market, and this truck will never be bought by delivery companies that need smaller trucks to fit where semi's don't.  


Its an 80's nerds mid life crisis truck."
"But what’s the price?  Tesla will probably do the model 3 thing of announcing a low price, then when it comes out say “well yeah, but we are only going to sell the high end specs first and those are 65k”"
"> Rivian

Tesla also wins on, ""who is Rivian,"" ... oh, god they're all ugly!"
How do you even go on a road trip in a Rivain without superchargers?
"> I guess it's a truck for someone that doesn't need truck

So most people that own a truck then?"
"Serious question: Why do you say that?

It was designed as a direct competitor to the F150 and can match or beat every spec. 

It also looks like the offroad capabilities will be amazing. 

What does it not have that you would want other than maybe an extended bed? (And let's face it for *most* people a 6.5 ft bed is enough)"
Its gonna sell like hotcakes
I very convienient 2PM here in Australia.
Just got up early to prepare the party at work ;)
The first 90 minutes are just Elon doing karaoke to Operation: Mind Crime with Harrison Ford watching disdainfully.
"Tesla should post their own. If memory serves, they switched to Youtube streams starting with the Y unveil."
Tesla official Twitter has a link to the official stream
Id just wait and see if the official one is youtube once they post it.
"It won't have a 300,000 pound towing capacity. It will just be able to pull at least that much. Ford pulled a million pounds with their electric pickup, and humans have pulled airplanes. It's just one of those eye-popping things that sounds neat."
Passenger/utility pickup.  The Semi was unveiled a few years ago.
Passenger pickup
"Consumer pickup.

Thats pulling capacity which is one element of towing capacity.  The other is being able to control and stop the load.  Its towing capacity will not be 300,000 lbs."
This is suppose to compete with the F-150s of the world but this is Tesla’s first time building a truck. It’ll most likely be expensive.
"Pickup truck but possibly on the large end of pickup trucks. They already have a Semi truck announced.

&#x200B;

300,000lb actual towing capacity is very unlikely. Even if it can pull that much, that doesn't mean it can handle or stop that much weight going down the road."
"Hoping for the semi platform w a truck bed. 

And the same towing capacity, 80k lbs total weight."
sometimes before
Just put anything
Anything
not checked
"It does more than just basic email format validation, probably through a deliverability check many email services provide."
Anything
anything
It would have been quicker for you to just try a made up email and find out it works than to comment here and wait for me to tell you it does.
I think anything. It went straight to the stream.
That was 5 mins ago.

"It needs to be fast to get out of view of everyone, because, well, look at it."

Why would you ruin the stainless steel aesthetic with paint?

Welcome to the club buddy
https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/09_Desktop.jpg
There’s some on the Tesla.com/cybertruck website
There is on their website.
"check out the website ([tesla.com/cybertruck](https://tesla.com/cybertruck)) for interior shots (it's halfway down, there's a mini gallery, right above the section that says Versatile Utility)"
In the webzone
On the website
"Just one photo of the interior on the website, and a mention of a 17 inch screen."
"Development of drivetrains and power management programs, and setting up the assembly of variants? thats my best guess."
Save yourself the pain and don’t watch.
It's on Youtube
"20-40 affluent, professional on the week days burner on the weekend types? Absolutely"
Zombie apocalypse
"You'll be able to wrap it, naturally."
"[To quote from Motortrend](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info), who apparently were shown the truck in advance and have published several articles just now: ""If you want a color besides the polished silver of stainless steel, the Cybertruck can be vinyl-wrapped—which lowers environmental impact and costs of a paint shop."""
At least people won't be complaining about the paint job? (Rollsafe.jpg)
"Vinyl wrap, maybe?"
There's no confirmation email
You’ll be fine.  Give it a week...
You could cut yourself on those lines.
They call me Mr. Plow
"They didn't say anything about PTO, how would you even move it without physical controls?"
Production
"Yeah. Here's your options.  


1. This
2. Fuck you."
"Sure, as long as it’s stainless steel colored"
Motor Trend said no but it can be vinyl wrapped.
"All stainless steel, no need for paint"
Wrap only according to MotorTrend.
"On motor trend they wrote that if you want a color, they are going to do a wrap instead of paint it. Painting stainless steel is not possible."
Doubt it
"you can get colored steel or wrap it. You'll have to wait a year or so before Tesla will tell you what the factory color options are.

https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck shows an example of a gold colored one in the camping shot.

https://www.gasparini.com/en/blog/electrochemical-chemical-finishes-stainless-steel/ shows you what colored steel looks like."
Can you vinyl wrap steel?
"This skips the first few minutes leading up to and the initial unveil but captures a lot of it. This was the best I could find:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwvDOdBHYBw"
Same as with other cars before. If you change anything you go to the back of the line.
It'll be the car of choice for couriers everywhere

"Yeah, I would love to see a aerodynamics simulation of a model of this.  It looks like a bad movie prop."
Glass breaks easy watch the reveal
"Assuming “cold rolled steel” for the chassis, there’s probably not much of a crumple zone. Maybe the engineers worked around the original problem suffered by the old American and Mercedes Benz vehicles? 

We will find out once we get the NHTSA reports/rating. 

As for the jaws of life, doesn’t this attack the area between the front and back doors?  (FD]|[BD) - the | is the area I am referring to"
Crumple zone.....Ha it looks like it launches the oncoming car into the fleet of vehicles behind you. At least you get to put them out of their misery so they no longer have to look at this hot piece of trash
It's the Schrodinger design.
">Boxy 

It's more like a triangle than a box."
I think it looks like puma.
"It is, MKBHD pointed it out."
"Yea. And that is the case.

Given Tesla’s stellar safety ratings, I’m very doubtful they didn’t consider the repercussions of doing away with the crumple zones."
5.7 ft according to Motortrend
Well to be fair outside US there is no market for anything bigger so like E and Y they are going the right way around that. We use vans a lot and [box]trailers with a SUV\4*4 or simply order to site with Semi size. I think a lot of people how like me think even the E is edging too big so some even waited for that despite being able to do S. Towing permanently a bed around simply isn't a good idea compared to a van or the optimality of trailers :-)
"Dude, it is an SUV as well. Seats 6 people. Hell, it's an SUV and a truck in that it has a bed for loading anything on it!"
Same as a Dodge Ram or an F350 with bull bars. Get hit with either and you're fucked.
"No truck is really capable of having a good one. There's almost no difference between getting creamed by a proper Volvo truck and a Ford pickup. None of them are going to be soft or prone to notice you breaking apart on its front bumper.

It's not like either will lose any relevant amount of momentum from hitting you."
Not to mention I can't think of a reason the windows would ever be tested to the point of several 1kg balls will be thrown against it. Unless your the leader of a country under revolt.
Gas cars have just as much software and more electric parts but less moving parts which are directly correlated with unreliability  mechanical devices.
"Cars, airplanes, banks, hospitals, the world runs on highly reliable computers. Since the introduction of computers, cars have become more reliable. Not that correlation equals causation in this case."
I was really hoping this truck would bring a whole new crowd to the EV market but I think they missed with the design alone..
"lol the dismay of the truckfaggots is too sweet, the truck market is already getting what it wants buy a rivian bro"
"Meh, it won't capture the old fucks that can't handle change even if it's for the better, but it'll definitely capture the younger crowd and most people looking to go from cars to trucks but were waiting for the right EV."
Elon promised Blade Runner and delivered Timecop
"Elon said they were building a product they loved. They weren't targeting any one group. Looks aside, it tows, hauls, it hauls ass, it's got range, it's pretty cheap. It's a win if you happen to like the look or close your eyes."
It’s exactly everything the truck market wants and more. It just look too weird for most people but I personally feel like I could warm up to it especially for that price!
I will buy it. I actually like the design a lot. It is totally different and practical.
"I’m in Texas and I’m buying it. Just can’t decide on dual or tri motor. I don’t know if I want to wait two years or three 

Also this will be my first EV"
I would
I’ll buy it. Looks awesome!
"Agreed on the hauling aspect, Bollinger  nailed it with their pass through capable of hauling 16 foot long lumber.

https://www.tfltruck.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bollinger-b1-sut-pass-through.jpg"
"Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. 

Can't think of one positive thing about the design of the truck itself. Wheel covers are nice.

Also, no weird door handles on a truck, for god's sake."
"I worked construction years ago, and guys who drove Japanese trucks never heard the end of it. 

you would need to go into witness protection if you pulled it to a job site in this truck."
"I don't know. It doesn't have the ""dorky"" look that some of the speculative photos had. It's definitely a huge aesthetic departure... but it's doing it in a way that is reminiscent of brutalist architecture. It's bold, it's agressive. Which is *exactly* what pickup trucks are sold on these days. It's different, yes, but it still has the core desire of the market at heart, so I think the way it's different is not a killer."
"I don’t know, I might buy it."
"I'm going to buy it, so I would say nobody."
But would they fly it? I might fly it.
I hope you're right.
"> There is no way that will be the final design.

People said the same thing about the Model 3 interior.  It was pretty damn close."
">There is no way that will be the final design. Here's the thing...

It may change slightly, but the truck you saw tonight...that's the truck unfortunately.

All the specs were downright amazing, this truck had everything need to disrupt the pickup market.  But that design will not be sold in masses."
It does.  They said it will have 110 and 220 outlets.
It has 110V and 220V outlets and an air compressor for tools?
You can plug in 120/220... but still.
"I don’t work with tools so I don’t know what their power requirement is, but the roll out did say it would have 110v/220v outlets"
"Uhhh, they did show the bed, and it looked frigging cool. They plugged the ATV into the power source in the bed, too."
"> battery for running tools

Didn't they do exactly that, opening up a panel in the bed to charge the ATV? And he said 110v/220v power, and an air compressor."
"It has outlets, 110 and 220"
"It was a bad, bad demo."
The 3 is up there
Nah. I think it was pretty damn good. Minimal words. Live visual examples and presentation. Solid short introduction
Wii music ain't got shit on this
"I agree.  I like the truck but my kids do better practicing for presentations at school.  

Should have had the PowerPoint and music ready synchronized.  

Should have had a turntable for the truck once it stopped.  

The ATV loading into the truck and charging was cool, but was almost an afterthought.  

Is there a frunk?  

Why not show the interior?

Where is the charging port?

The sledge hammer was ok, but they should have keyed it and hit it with a shopping cart.

No Tesla logo on front or tailgate?

Where are the reverse lights?  Do they work with the gate down?

Us the wall between bed and rear seats solid or can it fold down for longer items?

They show a pop-up tent on the website and should have shown a slide of that too."
I actually like it. Totally different. My next vehicle will be Cybertruck.
He took the word cybertruck a bit to serious.
He told us exactly what the company was going to give.
it's fking awesome! I am sure it's an option to have it covered or not.. have it uncovered makes the vehicle look a little normal
Does it matter?
That was sweet. Wish the ramp was motorised too
The S and 3 are some of the ugliest cars at their price point.
It’s not going to be on the market for another 2+ years
"In 6 months? Honey, Tesla's site says late 2021, so we're probably looking at mid 2022 at the earliest."
"Can't make a flatbed for something with unibody construction.

Also, low and mid-range models due late 2021.  Trimotor late 2022."
You sir are delusional 🤣

Have you ever seen a curvy Tank? Also need to keep a low radar profile.

What does this even mean lol

I can see myself driving something that looks like the Rivian more than the cybertruck TBH
"The more I looked at it the more I really started to love it. Will admit, I thought it was a joke at first"
I'm imagining a similar scenario here.
People also mocked the Zune... look how that played out.
Remember how people mocked the 100s of failed products?
"""the guy"" 

You mean Tesla's lead designer?"
That guy is [Franz von Holzhausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Holzhausen) is in charge of design at Tesla.
"That is Franz, snowballs chance in hell."
I can’t believe the price. It’s actually cheaper than the Y.
"I did reserve. It was only $100. I hate the truck, and for some reason ordered it."
"I am considering it. Will have to ask the wife tomorrow, but I'm not sure she would be on board."
"I foresee your stepdad laughing in the Tesla salespersons face if they showed him this, especially after seeing other options"
"No it won't.  No way in hell a ""pick-up"" will like this.  It's completely non-functional."
Then why did he position it against work trucks?
The point is that it’s too ugly to pay a dime for.
They are joking.
oh yeah.
"We'll see, ill be watching closely"
"It is truly ugly.

There's some charm to that, even some appeal, but no one can deny how fucking ugly it is."
It is ugly as fuck

"Apple may have some videos as part of their presentation, but that's just a small part. Their presentations are highly polished and the presenters are actually familiar with the material that they are presenting. Elon looks like each slide is something that he's seeing for the first time, and yet he's somehow driving the whole show."
what site?  I've been on [tesla.com](https://tesla.com) and i cannot find it  anyone have a link?
"If you dont have the side sails, you cant shut the roof!.This would murder the range.  The range is with the bed topper shut.  This allows the back to be more like a prius than an F150.  An open bed is a big lower pressure drag suck."
"Literally all they had to do, was not build a fucking triangle! I would consider buying it if it looked like this"
"Thanks for confirming what I was thinking in my head, figured if it had a normal-looking bed it'd look badass. I think the triangle will grow on me though."
Eww.
Honestly I think this looks like a good middle ground between the future design and current trucks. I'm hoping before launch they make it so the tailgate cover can do something like this.
Thank you
make the top of the bed parallel with the ground and you have a deal
So simple yet so much more palatable
Brokeback Trucktain
I still want to think it's a joke. Waiting for the actual truck.
"Why not, it's weird as hell but at that price it'll sell."
I ordered. It's so strange looking it almost doesn't seem real but for $50k it can do everything and I'll never worry about another door ding.
And that’s exactly what he  had always said about this truck
"Exactly my thought. It might be cool if you are role playing or something, but this design will not be popular. Looks like a joke tbh"
">seems like more a brainchild...

Brainfart

FTFY"
The price is pretty good.
Tesla will have everyone talking about them with this beast and it's exactly what they want. The thing has an electric ATV that plugs into it.
"Big opportunity miss, but if it goes on heavy sale it's just more opportunity to add on."
"Yeah.  I mean, I don’t even have 100 shares ... but for what I do have, this really pisses me off."
Right? I mean crumple zones exist for a reason.
I am a truck driver and want this thing
I like it. I would drive the shit out of this tank.
"Expected a truck, got an APC"
"I couldn't stop thinking about how it looked like a lifted lambo,.just wish the roof wasn't pointy"
Reminds me of the DeLorean with the angles and stainless steel
I’d say more delorean of this generation.

"I think the truck is hideous, but truck drivers in the south aren’t gonna be driving an EV regardless of how it looked."
"Eh,"
in another vehicle would you break the windows? or they’d already be broken?
"Have you never seen a Tesla rollover test video? It's about impossible to rollover without dropping of the side of a cliff.

How about a real time tesla crash to fire in the camera video?

Totally agree with you.
"> ""Everyone"" hated model s redesign and model 3 and ate their shoes months later.

it looks like a truck designed by someone who has never used one before"
"> Always hated trucks, now I want a truck

> They must've done something right

(lol)"
It's missing an edge somewhere.
Dang. I saw a post on r/wallstreetbets where someone put everything on Tesla booming today.
"No, stop!"
"This looks better than the Aztek.

Even so, I’ve developed a soft spot for the Aztek, so I probably shouldn’t have a say in this."
the fact that it looks like something a toddler would draw
Maybe the fact that it's super freaking ugly.
"I agree, this is what a truck looks like if you strip away all the useless bling that just ends up broken or falling off anyway. 

It’s the kind of ugly military vehicles are, aka functional beauty."
The whole aesthetic.
There is a form follows function purity to it.
"The basic shape of the truck is aesthetically unpleasing. It looks like a bad drawing of a strange trapezoid.

If it were truck-shaped, and had normal headlights, I still wouldn't love it, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as bad. Can't polish a turd, though, so there's no point.

I think I might be done with Tesla, for now. Model S was their last truly great product. Model X was a step down in looks and functionality. Giant cramped prius with bad doors and door handles. Model 3 looks like a tiny, stubby Chinese Corolla with plasticky door handles.

Thank god, the world doesn't begin and end with Tesla. Now we've got the BMW i8, Audi E-tron GT, Mercedes EQS Sedan. All I want is an electric Ford Fusion."
I own a diesel long bed F-250 and I got in my deposit before the order site went down. This checks all the boxes I need for my truck and a few extra. The fact that it looks like a delorean hasn't really been decided in my head as positive or negative.
"I’m an F150 owner. It’s my grocery getter, around towner, and kid hauler. I got it cuz I hate 3 row SUVs and need to go 3 across in the back seat. 

This thing is ugly as fuck and absolutely ridiculous looking.  But, if it does what he says it can do, and it costs what he says it will cost, then sign me the fuck up.  Looks fun. I can’t get a model 3 cuz I can’t fit 3 kids in it without really struggling. The bed cover looked cool as shit as it retracted."
"F-150 owner here.  I was hoping Tesla would come through on a better version of the pickup truck.   I need towing & performance but I also don't want to be the center of attention everywhere I go.  And the Cybertruck may have superior performance metrics than any other truck but it's at the expense of comfort.  It looks...you're right, it's a movie prop, not an everyday driver."
"Keep in mind that Elon said a long time ago that this was weird and if it wasn't successful... they'd just make a normal truck too.  I fully expect they'll do that, it just might be a bit further away now."
Its design is shaped by physics. Triangular for structural integrity (body serves as frame)
You got it right. It sucks. Hard. And the glass break...What a spectacular failure
Seriously?
We'll never know cuz literally nobody will ever buy that truck.
welp.
"No. The aesthetic is the only flaw so far, everything else is amazing"
You think anyone involved in this truck isn't aware of the reaction it would get? It was clear Tesla was not going to make a conventional looking truck. We knew this for a while.
Shattered expectations
The thing could have 12 motors and I still wouldn't even stand next to it. It's gross. That's the only way I can describe it.
Kinda disappointed since the Rivian has 4 motors.
"Trimotor is ""late 2022"" :("
Lol how exactly would you modify it?  It's literally the frame and body all in one.
He said autopilot standard.  Same as model 3.  FSD is extra
He didn’t say full self drive.  He said autopilot
No he said autopilot was standard.  That's separate from FSD
I was confused by that as well.
Yeah he said it was standard but I'm seeing it as you have to pay 7k
"comes with ""autopilot"" which is not the same as full self driving"
He said autopilot was standard.
Umm no. It comes with Autopilot. FSD is always an additional buy.
"No it was just available on the unveil, not included. Otherwise it'd be cheaper than a Model 3."
He said it would come with autopilot standard not FSD
Yep
Yes.

"No, that's tri motor AWD."
Nope that’s the tri motor. Dual motor starts in 2021.
Probably wouldn't have broke the 2nd one if that was the case
The immediate reaction of “Oh holy fucking shit” was pretty candid. I don’t think it was supposed to break.
I think that was a stunt to drop his stock price. Like his tweets!
Highly doubt it. Occam's razor etc...
On average they’re more positive than here. 🤔
Yeah they can make a normal one and then this thing. This would be like a special edition or tank edition.
"I'm sure they'll be watching pre-orders closely, and Tesla have been OK at responding to criticism previously - I'd imagine the no-flat-part on the roof is the most controversial part that might get addressed"
It’s a prototype. It’s not DoT approved. The final version will have them.
Ugly?

Seriously. I thought I updated my graphics drivers. Why can't I render this truck at higher resolutions?
So you can avoid being mugged while your car is stopped for the upcoming climate crisis
This might be something that doesn't make it to production. I do think the windshield should be made from that glass though. I could see someone using it as a ramp to do a skateboarding trick.
"Former First responder, now mental health worker.  Yeah, the thought of having to do an extrication on a vehicle I can't just boop the windows with a screw driver or glass tool gives me anxiety and I haven't had to saw a car apart in almost 20 years.    


You really need to be able to remove the vehicle from around someone in a timely manner when you have any serious spinal injury.   That and doors get stuck all the time when someone gets rear-ended.    


Don't love or hate the rest of the design, but FFS, ditch the glass."

They just saw through the hardened steel exoskeleton... Oh.
"Me too! I love the futuristic cyberpunk design. I don’t understand why people hate it so much. Tesla is doing so well with the 3, they can afford to be a little risky here. Once the general populace sees this on the road, they’ll notice how different it is and want one."
This is what a truck designed by an engineer looks like. Tesla needs to higher an actual designer this truck is beyond ugly

"If you had asked people what they didn't want, they'd say an electric Pontiac Aztek."
Ok
It's awesome looking.
"When I first saw it, I literally thought it was a joke. I had to check another source to make sure it was a real thing."
You're gonna change your mind. It grows on you. Styles change but the raw numbers on this thing are objectively amazing.
"I honestly thought that when he did the ""one more thing"" for the ATV, he was going to roll in the real truck, and the whole polygon, broken windows disaster was just a joke intro."
Just buy a rivian then lol
"Yeah, never before have I thought that Musk’s time might be up at Tesla. That changed in two seconds last night.

I guess I wait for the electric F150 now. Yes, it’s not bulletproof but that wasn’t exactly a criteria I thought was important. I hope to God this thing doesn’t make it to production and Tesla can salvage some of the work they’ve done.

If not, it’s time for Elon to go because either people are afraid and lying to him about the prospects of this thing or he just doesn’t care."
This truck is hot as hell. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder I suppose
Agreed
"> ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT IT'S ALL REAL.

Huh? No bumpers, no mirrors. It's not street legal."
Which would sell. I’d buy that semi pickup render that’s been floating around for a while.
"Franz already said before that Tesla doesn't have a design language, they just went for the same design throughout the Model series."

I honestly don’t think I’ve seen a car or truck that looks worse than this
You must be a replicant
"""Looks normal"" is overrated. I am sick of the same old shit with zero innovation year after year. At least someone is pushing design language forwards. 

And who are we kidding. Other manufacturers have had years to match Tesla but no one is even able to compete with a Model S today that was released almost half a decade ago."
self driveing tho too... 7k
"Good news is there likely isn’t much overlap between the kind of people wanting a normal looking truck and this. The stainless steel body(unpainted? Looks unpainted to me!) has me way more excited than it should. My work cars tend to look like the moons surface after a couple years, once the paints gone because I **lightly** touched some boulder the ugly rust spreads the pain peels ..."
I put down a reservation for a 3 at the unveil and I'm never doing that shit again.
Rivian must be like- yes. Tesla literally bombed their presentation and showed a very different version of what they thought should be a futuristic pickup. they remind me of the simpson episode where Homer built his dream car. it was a futuristic mess. Rivian has a decent looking pickup with similar specs and more functionality with its camping and hauling features. I am really hyped now for Rivian. I just wish they had a better charging infrastructure.
">The “vault” is a cool way to get functionality of a truck with weather protection of SUV if transporting something.

It's a tonneau cover. We've only had them for decades.

Thought it sort of reminds me of the [Raptor Fastback](https://i1.wp.com/www.ford-trucks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/F-150-Fastback-e1548792470642.jpeg?ssl=1) that was doing the rounds a while ago."
"Personally as a current Ram owner, I can not wait to get this. It’s about time a company has done something different with how trucks look."
"I remember a time the london 2012 olympics logo ([https://www.sessions.edu/notes-on-design/london-2012-olympic-games-a-logo-in-controversy/](https://www.sessions.edu/notes-on-design/london-2012-olympic-games-a-logo-in-controversy/)) was unveiled and it was seen as a true monstrosity. Looking back on it now, it looks absolutely perfect for the time."
"Elon Musk teased a ""cyber punk inspired truck"" this is what people who like cyberpunk wanted to see. I like it, I think it's gonna take some getting used to but it's just not for older people who want more classic designs. I'm sure there are some engineering benefits too."

"Not sure if 'tank' is a deliberate pun, but it definitely works."
"Im sure this has been said already, but this is the sonic the hedgehog movie redesign of cars."
"Keep holding, it’ll get back up there, especially when they release pre-order #s.

"I understand it's going to look different, but it looks like a game on super low graphics... Like they drew like 4 polygons and called it a day. I guess that's one way to keep prices down. Just make it a block."
"If you were smart, you buy a bunch more when it tanks. This truck is going to sell. I preordered mine and I'm not even a truck person."

It look like it will sell adequate numbers for the time being.

I think you are right a more conventional design may be coming 3-5 years down the track.

If they want the specs and price in a conventional design that is how long it may take.. meantime others will make more conventional EV trucks with worse specs at higher prices...

Perhaps I am wrong and they can do a more conventional mass market truck earlier, but I think no exoskeleton means significantly heavier or weaker."
"Lol, a badly designed cyber truck won’t take away Tesla’s profitability as a company. The cyber truck will share a platform with a normal pick up truck. Same specs and price."
https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/11_Desktop_Video.mp4
"Elon's been saying the truck will look ""cyberpunk"" for over a year."
Looked like there was a frunk in one of the presentation slides.
"Teslas past success has partly been that their electric vehicles look like normal vehicles, nice ones at that.  In this case Tesla our Prius'd the Prius.  I'm sure some people will buy it, but do you think truck guys will buy the thing?"
You’re not alone. I love the design!
I actually love it but its probably cause im into sci-fi
I love it too! It’s fun and why the heck not? The specs and starting price are insane. I bet it looks and feels way more better in person.
Lol
"I’m actively working on mentally coming around to the design. My active theory is I feel this way because it does not look like how a car/truck is supposed to look. My brain doesn’t register it as a vehicle. I feel like the could have worked around the by putting a small flat angle at the top of the triangle, bring down the eccentricity a little bit"
Dont eat it then
Glad someone finally said it
"Technically the material it's made of is bulletproof, not the windows."
"They never said the glass was bulletproof, that was the steel they were talking about."
at least it didn't go through !
"It didn't break, it just cracked."
And I don't think the model x design got nearly as much hate as the truck will. Fingers crossed they change it. Im sure they'll do some market analysis that shows they need a resign or it'll never sell.
"I mean, he tweeted a while back that if everyone hates it, they will just make something more traditional looking. Seeing as Tesla won't be building this anytime soon, I'm guessing they have plenty of time to realize no one wants to be seen in that."
I sure hope so? I am a trying to be a fan. I have a Model 3 already and I was waiting for this announcement... the looks of the car is really disappointing.
"Exactly, I didn't remember that. Model X is way more beautiful than what was showed first."
That looked like an actual vehicle though
"I would have put a deposit down on the fully loaded version tonight if it didn't look so terrible, it's right in my price range (I currently have a 2019 GMC Sierra Denali 2500 diesel that was $75k) and is as capable as I was hoping for. I'm so disappointed."
Care to explain why you think that?
I own a 2019 ram 1500 and I don’t think it’s ugly. Need to see it in person of course.
"Maybe if that were the goal they should have had the ball go through the regular glass in the drop test demo and had the ""Tesla Armor Glass"" crack in the drop test demo.

Seems like they were setting expectations it was going to bounce off without cracking."
"Agreed. 

At least in the western world, 9 times out of 10, its emergency services breaking a window for an extraction."
"Had they set it up that way it could have worked.  No way to spin it once it happened, though."
"It was a failure. Because that was regular glass. Obviously a tougher version of regular glass but it was not the same glass they did the drop test with. No way.

My guess? The ""Transparent Metal"" was not ready in the shape yet for the demo truck or its not legal to have that type of glass as the side windows. (They have to be able to be safely broken in case emergency crew need to get someone out and they can't open the door) And Elon did not bother to check before the presentation."
"Rivian is beautiful. Just out of my price zone is all.

The cybertruck is beautiful in a different way."
And the fact that this just literally fed the stereotype that all the F-150 owners had. Tesla is incredibly out of touch here.
"That was exactly my thought as well. I just said this in another post, but my first thought about the truck wasn't ""Holy shit that thing is ugly"", it was ""Maybe the Short Sellers are right"". I was instantly concerned about how unfathomably stupid this is from the perspective of Tesla becoming a mainstream car company that's fiscally viable."
"This.  These resources should be building the next F150, Lexus, etc.  Cars that will sell.  This is embarrassing for the company."
Has Tesla failed a vehicle launch so far? It's too early to say how this one will go.
It’s hilarious that because you work a blue collar job all these people automatically assume your a boomer
"I am with you. I work in Alberta and I will see exactly 0 of these vehicles. 

For the record like one in three vehicles in Alberta are pickups."
"They might get the first laugh, but you’ll get the last laugh."
Get with the times old man
This attracts harassment from truck owners. lol
That's sort of the point.
Definitely this. Seems like it would appeal more to the Land Rover / Hummer crowd than the f150 crowd
"When he says that trucks are the number one selling vehicle, I believe that most of the volume is commercial vehicles. He's appealing to the largest target buying audience with a lot of the functional choices. The form of it will change over the next couple years. It will likely be softer on the edges, is my guess."
"Maybe, sure, but the only reason Hummers are impractical are they're huge and a nightmare to park (while this fits inside the F150 footprint) and get horrible gas mileage. I really thing this checks a lot of boxes as far as utility and will be a head-turner driving around the suburb."
How so? The design looks crazy but as someone currently looking at buying a truck the functionality and price point are solid.
"They don't have the time or the cash to do temporary vehicles. If Tesla doesn't go broke before it's launched, this is the truck we are getting."
"I thought Tesla built EVs that looked like regular cars.  That was their whole thing.  BMW, GM, etc. all built EVs that looked like some futuristic nonsense that no one wanted, while Tesla built EVs that looked like pretty nice normal cars.  This truck is going to sell like the i3, not the F150."
"I'm sure the specifications are magnificent, but imagine getting hit by one of these things! It's a horrendous design for so many reasons, we just need to accept that Elon and co f\*\*cked up big time on the design. The first of his cars I can safely say I would never be seen dead in haha."
"There was a picture in the presentation that showed you can remove the top part of the slanted bed walls to make them straight and traditional to strap stuff to it.


They thought about everything."
The aftermarket will take care of that..... Honestly though I haven't seen many bike/cargo racks on the TESLA's
"It would appear that they are in fact *not* ""shatter proof""."
good point.  if there batteries are burning and the door mechanism is not working.  its a death trap.
Traps?
"During the event, I kept waiting for him to bring the real truck out..."
The world doesn't have enough VRAM.
The first place I saw a photo was on a joke subreddit. I thought it was a joke.

It's been a week and this is still the real truck
🤞🏻
"Yep. I would have already put a deposit down for that.

This hideous monster revealed tonight?  No fucking way."
I like elons a lot better
Then i guess Rivian is for you people that were expecting that. Nobody reasonable would expect it from Elon's tweets...
"Seriously, that looks a million times better."
"Ford, GM, and others are lining up to do so. Probably smarter for Tesla to let them take care of that."
Hahahah
Yea i LOLd when it came it. It's kind of growing on me.. Interior looks pretty good to.
There’s only one pic?
If it is then the shareholders are going to destroy him.
Tesla never expected Cybertruck to appeal to the average man.
"Apple would only give you one power outlet, and it would be their own proprietary outlet so you need an adapter for all your power tools."
He is surprisingly bad at presentations
"I mean he is terrible, but it kind of works for him though. Kind of shy nerd.  Like when they smashed the glass, he handled that pretty good, self deprecating and funny. The fix it in post joke was a zinger. 

Compared to when Steve jobs had a demo fail, he seemed really angry and irritable, super awkward"
"It's strange because his primary purpose and skill in his businesses is to market their products, yet he is pretty crap at talking to an audience and in most interviews."
That was his first hit. The 2nd one was more normal.
I think he was just a wimp. He couldn’t get a good hit on the f150 door either. The hammer was twisting around when it made contact. I thought he was going to put a hole in that thing and then he did the limp wrist thing.
"The full-thrust following the soft tap on the door had me like ""okay...?"""
"The sad thing is this thing sounds like a really awesome work truck.  Amazing cargo capacity and towing power, great clearance, the air tools, power outlets, the ramp...everything about it begs to be slammed into the work force.  But it won't be, 'cause yeeehaw."
agreed....The truck looks amazing!! The future is finally here!!
The people who buy work trucks are the people who would buy this.  The utility of being a generator and the ridiculous specs and the gas savings AND the incredibly competitive price greatly outweigh the unorthodox look.
"I thought it was extremely ugly and a joke at first, but the design grew on me really fast. Maybe others will feel the same."
"Well he was right. Judging by all the concerned shareholders in this thread, it’s too futuristic. I still really want one though."
"This isn't futuristic though, it's just hard angles and flat like a low polygon first 3D model. I was convinced the whole thing was a joke, but it just kept going. I'm just mystified."
Sounds like you were expecting a Ford F-150

Is the flat segmented roofline designed that way specifically so that the profile shape can form a tessellation?
Those windows might need some work before going to mars
And it’s going to look stupid as fuck driving on the freeway
I don't think anyone cares at all.
"imo, this is what I LOVE about this car.  

He should of talked about this more..."
"I was thinking this as well, car is way ahead of its time."
Unfortunately the market for trucks on Mars is much smaller than the market for trucks on Earth currently.
Why so?  Sincerlely curious if there's a physics element i'm missing.
I’m seeing all positives
Exactly what I thought.  Almost seems like it would be inherently not street legal.
"They are accepting payment for them, right now, online. It is real."
I thought the wheels looked dope af
They don't want people to know it's a Tesla
"They were thinking ""what will get us in the news yet be close enough to what we will actually sell?"""
I think it looks bad ass. It'll grow on you I'm sure once you're used to seeing it.
"Personally I don't love the design, but I definitely don't hate it"
"I like it. If I had a need for a truck and had a ludicrous amount of money, I'd buy one."
this is a puppet account. look at his post history.
That’s the triple motor. All other models are 2021.
"Elon said if people hate it, they'll redesign to something more conventional. That and they still need to ship 3 other (more normal looking) vehicles first."
They have to. It doesn’t even have mirrors!! This is a move to get people to put down money on a concept car that may never see the light of day.
"Honestly I think this truck looks retarded, but I can guarantee the f150 will be a piece of shit compared to this bulletproof trapezoid. You won’t get anywhere near the amount of tech and range as this thing for the price."
My girlfriend said it looks like he unveiled it about 50 years too early
"I agree, it looks terrible"
my first thought as well. By by the end I was in love! This is the fastest a design has ever grew on me! LOL! what was that. 5 minutes?
"Yeah, 99% of commenters are trolls today. Are you insane?"
LMAO
[deleted]
He said it would be weird. Also let's not forget this is an early version. I'm sure some things will be tweaked
Then you've never seen the Pontiac Aztek
"Right!? That was the whole point of the roadster and S, it was the first electric car that looked like a normal fucking nice car. This is exactly the mistake all the previous electric cars made!"
"Versatility, cost savings, & aerodynamics > design"
Right looks like a DeLorean truck.
mazda clones are much better.
"As much as it kills me to say it, I have to agree."
The point was to look like it was from Blade Runner so of course it's retro-future.
it looks like a videogame car from 2004 that hasn't finished rendering
"This truck is trash. Tesla just handed one of the biggest market segments in North America to Ford and Rivian. This truck was made for Californians, not for job sites. I own a Tesla and I manage a construction equipment dealership. I was very much looking forward to converting construction ppl over to Tesla... That will not happen now. When my company needs trucks, I suppose we'll have to look to Ford as well. Very disappointed."
Someone post a picture of the Batmobile and this thing side by side lol. One has sexy lines and curves and one looks like a brick of aluminum. It looks more like that cube the hamsters drive in that commercial than a batmobile.
"I was thinking it looks just like the Warthog from Halo. I bet Microsoft and Bungee are talking to their lawyers, or should be."
"I think you have some valid points, but you’d probably be putting a lot of your tools in the frunk/pillars, not in the bed. There’s way more storage (locked and protected from the elements) in this than in your typical truck.

Also, the slide basically said it has infinite pulling capacity (which is what you’re talking about with the F150)...that’s very different from it’s rated towing capacity.

I do agree about the bed length though, was expecting it to be extendable or something. And yea, doesn’t seem like this was designed as a work truck but I’m okay with that."
"Given how much time they spent with truck drivers in designing the semi, I'm surprised they didn't put the same effort into talking to contractors to find out what they would want in order to replace their existing vehicles. Elon has scrapped entire plans ignoring sunk costs (e.g. carbon composites at spacex) but it seems he thinks he has a winner. I'm glad other companies are entering the market, but I hope Tesla survives long enough that other car companies wouldn't bother switching back to gas."
"During a podcast Elon was on he mentioned the design might be so unpopular that they would have to scrap it and come out with a more normal design. Not sure which podcast so I don't have a link, sorry.

I don't know if it was a prank, but I do know this is not the final design. This has already received so much bad PR that internally they must be considering plan B.

But, uhhh, can't agree with you on the tow vs pull numbers. here's the F150 tow specs: [~~https://www.ford.com/cmslibs/content/dam/brand\_ford/en\_us/brand/resources/general/pdf/guides/19Towing\_Ford\_F150\_Oct25.pdf~~](https://www.ford.com/cmslibs/content/dam/brand_ford/en_us/brand/resources/general/pdf/guides/19Towing_Ford_F150_Oct25.pdf) ~~13,000 pounds, not a million~~ Woops forgot that was the Electric F150, not gas powered. I'm sticking to my original theory tho, the F150 electric still can not tow a million pounds. So, uh, with low enough friction, nearly anything can ""pull"" a million pounds. I've always found Engineering Explained youtube videos a good mix of math depth and high level description, here he is explaining why the million+ pound pull was dumb and meant nothing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au3U72CX74I&t=603s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au3U72CX74I&t=603s)

I'm still on your side tho. This unveiling was bad. 2 failed demos (Broken glass, and he awkwardly paused waiting for a suspension demo that never happened..), unpopular design. I'm still waiting on the real design they come up with before this releases."
The whole million pound train that Ford pulled isn't that impressive when you do the math.
"What is the meladramatic bs?!  

Even if you don't like the looks the specs blow it out of the water. Tell him to enjoy his Yukon and see if he can't calm his neurotic son a bit!"
"I’ve been trying to get my dad in an electric car for a year since I got mine. I convinced my mom to get a Model 3 and she loves it. My dad drives it on the days he doesn’t need to carry a lot of stuff to and from our different businesses, and he can see the advantage in gas savings alone. Had this looked like the Rivian at this price point, he would have been in. He pointed out the short bed right away too. Oh well, not going to hurt the company in any way, just a little disappointing."
"Great write up. They need to take this drivetrain and suspension and make a normal truck, that people actually use.  This is an embarrassment to the company. I'm glad I didn't hype this ""truck"" to my family that need trucks as they would be laughing at me."

"It's not a prank dude. You are still in the denial phase!

Couple comments here

1. Truck design is a super-dud, no way around it, start from scratch. Or just buy an electric F-150 
2. For $39,900, I'd MUUUUCH RATHER have a 250-mile RWD Model S. Now that we know it's possible."
amen!
I could've sworn in one of his warnings about people might not like it here mentioned possibility of following up with another truck. If their goal is to displace the top along ice trucks then I hope they do that. Leave this truck as their answer to the Hummer crowd. Design a truck like some of the more useful looking renders we've seen for those who just need a truck that is utilitarian.
"I was reading some articles that under a quarter of truck owners actually use their truck for work purposes and instead purchase trucks to “present a tough image, stand out in a crowd, and out perform other vehicles”."
75% of the people buying trucks today are not using them for any of the purposes you’ve described here.
im too lazy to type out a rebuttal tbh. But you genuinely come off as dumb
No the people who like this design wish the iPhone turned out like that
what
The difference is that the iPhone exceeded design expectations. This doesn't.
It’s possible to care about both.
"Toughness in terms of a truck doesn't mean you buy the truck you can throw the most rocks at. It means reliable on or off the job.

The problem is Tesla built a truck for 80s 'futuristic' culture / sci-fi fanatics. The cross section of that group and your average truck owners is a bit small."
"Toughness to a point. This is absurdly over the top for anyone buying a $40k pickup.....er $40k  stainless steel crossover

We want it look sharp. Like turn around and glance back as you walk away sharp. Do that, and make it tough as nails, and I'll get in line.  Do that and make it look like something my 8yr old was drawing 4 years ago, and I'll take a hard pass, thanks."
It’s not that it’s just not pretty enough. It’s that it’s goddamn hideous.  I made the same design for my Boy Scouts Pinewood Derby car.
"> valued toughness over aesthetics

They care about the appearance of being tough."
"I mean it looks bad imo. Not really a truck guy myself, but all the people that i know that actually use their trucks for their intended purpose dont care how tough the body panels are, or how good the paint looks. When they mean tough, they mean you can use and abuse it and it will keep working"
I know right?
"You think that Ford, Ram, Chevy, and GMC don't compete with each other and sell due to their aesthetics?"
"It’ll be on YouTube for sure, posted by dozens of different channels"
[deleted]
Maybe YouTube?
"I think Tesla has shown with GF3 how quickly they're able to build a factory. They likely won't produce a million of them per year soon, but I the first batches being late 2020 seems reasonable."
That would be terrible. It needs to be in production in ~1 year imho.
15 minutes.
Soon
"You got this.  Come on, rally!!!"
Same.. it's very new design language.. but wow.. this is something else.
It's probably got a lot of practicality to it but the design is sooo hard to get over..
Do you want an S and X redesign after seeing this?
"Yeah for the fking us military...

Not a farmer lool."

Looks like a hearse
But it won’t sell. You don’t make a truck for 5% of the populace if you want to make money.
Thought the side panels were removable
"The side panels are apparently removable.

I don't know why they showed it with the panels on if that's the case though."
I wouldn’t call it a meltdown
I'll bet Rivian had their biggest day ever for preorders last night.
"I just checked and the Rivian R1t starts at $69k. However it comes with a greater battery range, quad motor, and what I think is a more conservative design."
[deleted]
So buy now and earn some cash with the inevitable bounce back within 24 hours.
Hey! As a Prius owner I resent being compared to that thing!
Rivian is a private company.
I hope not. This is a flop.
"God I hope not. I want to be driving around in spheres by 2023, not triangles."
"Decades too late, dude. This looks like a concept car from the 1960s World Expo."
Ouch
That's *harsh*.
Lol. This is awesome. 🤓
"I agree that the market for this isn’t going to be big based on looks.

With that said, if I had the money (and I don’t now or for the foreseeable future) I would get it. I actually like the look, but I am a sci-fi junkie, and for an all electric truck. I think it’d be worth it. One of the reasons I don’t have a truck is the cost of gas.

Plus the interior looks nicer than any truck I’ve been in."
I honestly thought that’s what was happening at the very end
"Starting at $39,900*..."
Not the target market anyways. Elon wants to change the way the world works not continue to play into it for profit alone.
Agreed - the Mach-E reveal blew this out of the water.
At least they didn't spend 40 minute talking about shit nobody cared about and got straight to the point.
"Can I ask why exactly?  What exactly *does* this for you?

When you look back to the 80s and 90s electric vehicle designs, do you wish for their return?"

"#**PLEASE ~~GOD~~ ELON, DO THIS**"
"This looks bigger than most American trucks from Ford/GM/RAM etc. You’re gonna have a really tough time driving this on the UKs comparatively tiny roads, and forget about driving it into public car parks"
"we need new flairs to add things on, ive got a 3 at the moment and like you ive reserved the truck and i know theyre going to sting me for that fucking quad too if they ever make it :/"
"Tesla made a truck for people that don’t need a truck. 

Great job elon!"
"> This is one of those things that people will have to get used to because their brains can't even comprehend this design. 

Hm. That might be true. It is a design that is completely unmoored from any automotive design language we're familiar with outside of 80s Sci Fi movies like [Damnation Alley](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bJFJRQ7CDms/TaRh3HDVhUI/AAAAAAAAGro/Vss3N1n3-cI/s1600/damnation8.jpg)"
50k for a truck is not affordable. And it looks like a bad PS1 graphics truck
This is not design.  This looks like a high school project.
I hope you're kidding. It's design is laughable in this market...
"This will be a historic meme truck. 


I love Elon but anyone who didn’t expect this to be a meme truck is literally retarded. Elon said it was based on cyberpunk months ago."
"Honestly I think this is a marketing ploy for people to talk about it. Every other model in the Tesla lineup doesn’t look like, well... this.

I don’t understand how Elon thinks a wide ass pentagon on wheels is marketable (especially with the roof). So, hopefully this is a marketing ploy and he comes to his senses"
"Lol as if the majority of people would be able to afford one ? Obviously this truck was going to be for a specific demographic even before the design came out, 
oh wow too bad what are 32 year old moms going to drive now ?? A raptor ?"
"Yeah if you want to compete with current trucks, maybe go with a more moderate look. I mean you’re not gonna steal a lot of current truck drivers who were considering buying one with this body design, which is a shame cause the specs are amazing."
Warthog from halo looked a lot better
I wish they showed more features
"It's different. 

But I think it's growing on me."
"I'm crying on the inside, thanks for the laugh lol"
I assure you there won’t be a line. You’ll probably get #1

"Neither did the Roadster, Semi, or the Model X unveil."
Neither did the roadster
Cameras dude. Even though I'm hoping it's a joke.
"They will. Even if it’s a reaction to the stock movement, they’ll have something."
Normal meaning a big long nose?  If it dosent need a long nose why have one.
Hardly the same
I think you meant 2020 Silverado Grill lol
"True, but this time THE ENTIRE TRUCK is the problem"
There won’t be any blind spots. They are planning on using outward facing cameras to project what’s beyond those pillars onto the inside of the pillars.
forget about autopilot?
"I took a shit this morning that looked better than the other cruiser, fuck I take a shit every morning that does"
Everything looks better than a PT Cruiser. And drives better. I was on vacation once and the only car they had to rent was one. It was awful. My daughter and I still shudder at the memory.
Dreadful wait..
Jay911 standing by!
"Ehhhh...idk. I come from truck country, and I just don’t see this making any inroads. 

What’s the market segment for this thing?"
"Rest assured, people who buy trucks for that level of performance care about how it looks."
Form follows function...
I like everything but the rear profile... but I like everything else enough that I'd still want one.
"I honestly didn’t pay attention to the options, I just wanted to submit as quickly as possible. I don’t think the options matter right now."
"The sides have no crumple zone, front + back probably do."
"Companies sell armored vehicles so there should be a legislative loophole. As for crash protection, trust me that thing will bend at the weight of the truck being pushed into a pole. I wouldn't worry about safety for passengers, more for pedestrians or other vehicles it steamrolls into."
Just think of the size Musk's balls must be to actually follow through with that design.
Other than the aesthetics which is clearly the polarizing subject...what else makes this truck a bad product?
You just answered yourself haha. “If you don’t like it then it isn’t for you *shrugs*”
Why not both?
"Its more for the classic gaming crowd.

What's the price tag on this baby
Everyone’s talking about it.
"It looks cool, is reasonably priced, and has impressive stats. Why does it looking cool mean that a suburban person can’t have it?"
"Yeah, I’m digging it."
"I'm having the same experience. When I first saw it I just laughed and thought this must be a joke, it's terrible. Then I look at it more and it seem a little bad. Maybe one day I'll like the looks. Feature wise I'd at least very strongly consider a used version of the 500 mi range variety."
"Same here, when I saw it behind that F150 truck I digged the design"
"Agreed.

When I first saw it, I didn’t love it but neither did I hate it.

Now, in the cold light of morning and looking at the pictures some more, I have to admit it’s grown on me.  I probably would still qualify it as a don’t love/don’t hate feeling, but less on the hate side.

I’m curious to see it fully developed."
There's a 2wd version?
Me too!
"Yeah... I've been a fan of nearly everything to come out of Tesla, but this, this is just ugly. 

Aztek status."
It's retrofuturistic.
"reminds me of the Landmaster from ""Damnation Alley"":   
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmaster)"
"It is called the cyber truck, but i'm not a fan. Wish they had more normal design too."
"Even earlier than that, check out Italian concept cars of 70’s like lancia stratos zero, Ferrari modulo and so on, needless to mention DeLorian"
Rivian is also almost twice the price
"Disagree, I like the look a lot better than I thought it would. I think it actually looks awesome."
There is nothing wrong with the Mach E except calling it a Mustang.
"Lmfao yeah , only 20k more"
Yes that's how the world works. Better things are more expensive and 20k is a huge gap.
">And for 19k more you get a better truck too.

how is it better?"
19k is a lot of money though
Rivian looks like bad imo. Like the Honda ridgeline. At least this looks different. Why does a truck have to look like a truck?
"Or, it’s meant to be outlandish and the designer actually executed exceptionally well."
He should join the original sonic movie designer
I don't know about that because this is definitely what I'm getting next!
But I like it.
Have you been to the USA?
False
"Most pickup trucks are garage queens and are rarely off pavement. Some are functional (and this truck is hella functional) but lots are status symbols.

It’s not a typical truck, but smart buyers will buy it for the cost savings and lower TCO.

Had a Tundra, bought a Model S, would buy this truck. It’s not for everyone, I readily admit that."
">	People buy pickup trucks because they are functional, not cool.

You had me until this. Not true, have you seen Ford Reptor? 9 out of 10 Raptor drivers don’t even use the truck bed"
"That’s not completely true. I’ve met a lot of truck owners who are more interested in the comfort and tech than the utility of it. A lot rarely use the bed. I’ve only seen people *really* use a truck when it’s 8+ years old.

But I agree, I could never see an average plumber/farmer/etc buying one of these. They would get laughed off of the work site."
Do you think Tesla is going for the farmer sale?
"And this isn’t functional?  I also cannot really see farmer john parking this next to the tractor, but when he needs to pull the broke ass thing into the barn this truck might do it."
I can see police departments buying a lot of these
"> are functional, not cool.

Well, good, because this is definitely not cool."

Congrats you lucky s.o.b

"Down for sure, but I doubt a full tanking"
Terrible? It's the best truck specs by far.
"Yeah seriously. The fuck is that thing.

I guess it’ll be a good test of how many folks fall into the “fuck you give me your money” fan boy category."
"Does this mean you think people are going to go sell their existing Tesla because of the look of the truck or the quality of the demo? Because that seems silly to me. My model S is great and the horrific truck with the ""parable of the broken window"" demo does not affect that."
"I don’t like the truck but it’s important to know that the truck demo isn’t jumping outta their yeehaws to go electric. A lot drive gas guzzlers because they just want to at this point. It’s like trying to convince steak lovers to try a beyond burger. They think it makes em less of a man, soft, or some other wild shit like that. 

EV trucks are a brand new market. Probably going to get people into trucks not switch their truck."
"Your opinion/thoughts of their understanding of the truck demographic *really* matters when you spell Rivian as ""Rivin""...."
"> It seems expressing any positive thoughts on it subjects the person to a witch-hunt and death threats.

You are always safe at /r/elonmuskcirclejerk
">It seems expressing any positive thoughts on it subjects the person to a witch-hunt and death threats.

lol no one is getting death threats."
"> So many people laughing about the glass breaking.

Well it was hilarious with Elon's ohmyfuckinggod and Franz trying again and shattering the other window"
"Of course, but most people just see a glass break. It's not a flattering look. Beside what's the point? If it breaks it needs to be replaced anyway. Don't see the benefit for contractors for example."
My thoughts exactly.
Do you like how cars look with broken out windows?
Hong Kong is ordering all of them.
"I think the criticism/ridicule is justified since they advertised it as basically indestructible, only to have it break on stage. They could have easily just shown the drop test and moved on."
"If it's as rigid as they make it out to be, you're going to absorb all of the impact not the vehicle."
"> almost roit police certified...

What's your point? Mass produced vehicles have to pass crash safety tests. They are also required to use laminated safety glass all around which is what this prototype was equipped with."
"Pretty sure side windows aren’t intended to be super strong, I bet it’s just the windshield. They were supposed to demo on the windshield and screwed up. Twice."
"I disagree, I think they are paving the way in design innovation. I personally love the design (grew on me quickly) and can’t wait to drive one. I like different, let others be sheep."
Good. While I think it looks weird if it really lives up to what they say it would be stupid to buy anything else. It's specs are really crazy.
There's literally camera's that show u what you're seeing when in reverse. There's also tool boxes built into the sides on the inside of the bed.
Tool box is in the front. Racks and 5th wheel might be an issue. 5th wheel probably not going to work on anything with sail pillars.
"This doesn't compete with *anything*. There is nothing else in this vehicle class because it doesn't make any sense. 

Trucks are utilitarian. It might make sense to make a sexy electric truck, the torque features and benefits of an electric motor could be interesting. 

But who is going to buy this, and what will they use it for?

If I was rich, I'd buy one as an investment collector's item, and use it just for kicks as a toy, but this is absolutely nowhere near any kind of competition for any pickup truck.

The bed closes but on a huge slant? For aerodynamics? For form over function? This is not what people that buy trucks care about."
It's a meme on wheels...  I am so heartbroken.  I wanted a functional EV work truck.
Doesnt look like the bed is easily removable either. Good luck if you dent it. Outside of fanboys I don't know who will buy into this. Maybe businesses that need fleet trucks and plan on adding a camper anyway? Price wise it doesn't compete with the fleet trucks though.  I guess they are aiming for the growing crowd of users who own a truck as a glorified sedan but I doubt they would go for it either.
My first impression was that their target demographic is flashy city dwellers.
Which country?
You’re delusional.
You're forgetting the /s
"Yea, no it’s not. Lol"
Gotta disagree on each of those. This outstrips the Rivian in every way.
Agreed.
Why? Cause the windows broke?
You beat me by TWO minutes

"There is 0 reason you cant design crumple zones with steel.  Its not some magical infinite stiffness material.  It just has different properties.  F150s had steel bodies until 2015.  They switched to aluminum for weight and gas mileage.  Tesla has calculated differently.  Just like with starship, its apparently lighter to design a weight bearing body that is heavier than a normal body but lighter than a normal body AND its frame.  An aluminum body is mostly for looks and aero so its needs to be durable and light.  The tesla body has to be durable and strong so its steel."
99% of the cars being made today are made with steel
"I had thought this too: if two indestructible vehicles meet in a head-on collision, it's the humans who pay the price."
Steel panels does not mean zero crumple zones in an accident.
"Nah, as much as I love Tesla I don't get wtf is this."
"I hate the pointy roof, the rest is fine, the specs and price is great overall. Still can't get over how it looks from the side, this shouldn't have made it past concept stage."
"Yeah there's no way this penetrates any of the actual pickup market. Nobody is rolling up to a jobsite in this thing any time soon.

This is only selling to people who've never owned a pickup before and bought it because they love bladerunner.

Pretty disappointed they didn't have a slightly more traditional offering."
Interesting because my Twitter feed is full of pre-order screenshots
"Minority here, but I would definitely buy this car because of the looks. I think it looks amazing."
Your mom is the ugliest thing I've ever seen.
"I totally disagree, it is not ugly, it is just different.  People have been conditioned to see trucks in one way.  It looks like the future because it is the future."
A ford f250 certainly isnt a looker atleast its intersting.
Tbh when it first rolled out i was like ohhh myyy god wtf is that. But it grew on me and I actually like it. Tesla is a mold breaking company. Many people will laugh at this today. 5-10 years from now I bet more cars will take subtle hints from this design.
"Extremely ugly. Decent specs, but I can't get over the look."
"It might actually bring a lot of innovative features and ideas. I like the hard body.

But dear god is it FUGLY"
"At first I was like ew....

&#x200B;

But honestly, the more I look at it, the more I'm starting to like it."
It’s amazing. It’s also change. The angles in the design make it easy to manufacture & assemble. The lack of paint is environmentally friendly & dramatically less expensive. Probably will also help with a manufacturing more quickly. No scratching or denting.
"Looks like a grade 3 student's back of notebook design.  No grace, no cool.  Even something like a scaled down version of the semi would have been cool. (Compete with the International Harvester thing)."
It's not a car
It’s a truck
This is hilarious
"That’s so ignorant. Yeah it looks different. But the specs are next to none. There’s nothing like it, or even close. So how can you be disappointed? Cause it doesn’t look exactly how your fairy tail truck looks? Cute."
It’s almost as if taste is subjective. Weird huh
Ugliest thing to come out of Tesla by a mile
Noting says your opinion is of value like using an ableist slur amright?
"Not a usual tesla frequenter. Came to see what the opinions were. I can certainly see why someone would dislike it. 

But i actually really like it, i think it looks pretty rad."
It looks like it’s missing polygons

I agree. Only boomers are mad

"To each his own, but to me this render looks awful. I absolutely love the Cybertruck"
This would have been badass. I can’t believe that the same company that designed the 2020 roadster could also be capable of creating this..
"Exactly, this fits perfectly with the other cars’ design language. Now suddenly there is a rectangular car on the website feels kinda weird"
Looks like a badass smiling panther
"That looks like a toy compared to it. Those curves and all that, you’d probably need to use cheap plastic parts for that and that paintjob would be DOA on any real worksite.

Micro scratches on paint? What’s that?

The good news is rivian or Ford will probably built a truck just like that for you."
That would have made too much sense.
What it shouldn't have. That's straight up ugly.
Nah.
true
That's beautiful!
"Still might!

That blocky concept truck they unveiled needs some refinement."
"I mean, that rendering is just tasteless, though. At least Tesla is going bold here"
"I wanted the cab over the front wheel, you don't need a nose or frunk on a truck. I want maximum payload."
"And who would've bought that, honestly?"
That’s what I really was hoping it would look like. This truck reminds me of pyramid head from silent hill
There is a countdown you should see.
It shows a countdown.

I doubt it. The website mentions the monochrome as a feature.
"They want people to vinyl wrap it. More eco-friendly, apparently."
Paint defeats the purpose. Paint scratches in a rugged environment. Steel doesnt
The new article says stainless is best wrapped. That suggests no to me.
Says you can wrap it if you want.  Only comes as is.
"For environmental reasons it can be vinyl wrapped.

So, you don’t have to pay a premium for red."
Six seats in all configs from what it looks like...
Plus a few Elon’s away I fear
"Think it might be 6 seats standard on all 3 configs, the difference is probably only in the motors and battery pack."

It appears to have a light bar built in at that location already.
"They don’t exist, because this is the future and there’s no looking back!"
Probably cameras like the truck.
You dont need mirrors on a truck lol...
"That is a little concerning. I was hoping it'd come in closer to what is considered ""mid-size"" like a Tacoma. A foot longer than an F150 and now it's clearly in the ""full-size"" category and not as convenient to drive in the city/tight spaces."
"If I recall musk said it was smaller in every dimension then the f150, but I suppose no could have misinterpreted him saying it's bigger in every dimension"
"It's the same length as the f150 crew cab with the 5.5 foot bed, 231 inches,  but the Tesla has a 6.5 foot bed,  so a full sheet of plywood should fit."

asking the important questions
"Dude, extend your garage by  a few inches, how hard can it be? Probably only a few $K, don't even need a new door."
No.
Probably not. Getting electricity to remote environments is harder than getting fuel to remote environments.
"Military will probably be one of the last to switch to electric. Electric is good for your regular commute where you can recharge it at one end or the other. As infrastructure gets built out it will be good for longer trips as well, but going somewhere with no infrastructure and potentially having to go long distances as the military might electric has a long ways to go to be able to compete with gas."
It's got them Rocket League wheels!
Oh I wish we got that version.  Anything would have been better than what we got.
"What you have here is a stainless steel *exoskeleton* that is much, much thicker than the skin of a traditional car. Stamping that shit fir mass production would be a nightmare even if you could get the dies not to crack. That's why all of those flat planes."
"Good news, you can put down $100 now and try to up your income in the next two years while waiting for things to move forward."
So you can't afford the model 3 but you can afford this?
A hockey player?
Marketing gimmick
the roof is transparent but looks like metal on the outside. should have mentioned that in the reveal because it's badass.
Height was around 75” I think.  Not sure about the tires.
"Tires on the demo are 35"" x 12.5"".

Vehicle height is 75 in (1,905 mm). It is a good bet this is with the adjustable suspension in the low postion."
"It probably depends on the crash. If you hit a wall there's no reason for the steel not to crumble. It might be tougher but that's because the car is much heavier so the forces involved are going to be greater. The issue is if this hits another car or pedestrian, don't imagine they will fare so well. Other trucks are probably even worst at this since a body on frame design means you really can't have a crumble zone. Frame goes all the way to the front and it's made out of even thicker metal han this."
"Don't worry, there's a general rule of thumb for rigid heavyweight vehicles: if it can't have its own crumplezone it's going to borrow one from whatever it's ramming into."
Literally just put in my order to sell lol
Yeah...but he never did...I'm so confused.
"I was waiting for his, one more thing, moment. He had one, and it was a fucking ATV! Does it come free with the truck, blah."
"I think he said make something totally unique and that’s what they did. 

It’s literally one of a kind. That’s not for everyone, but it will be for some."
Elon for sure has jumped the shark here.
"It's like someone who is really charming and smart but is absolutely hideous. You want to go out with them, but they're just so ugly..."
[deleted]
"The design will most likely remain unchanged but specs will vary from now and final design in 2021. Just like the roadster, we will probably see improvements at the time that launches in late 2020"
"Or it could just be a trend. 

Model X had $5,000 deposit. Model 3 had a $1,00 deposit."
Same way they revealed the specs for the model s/x/y and it came to fruition. Actually the specs are better after reveal
The deposits are $100 for all models...
"This will sell much better than the thing that was shown tonight. 

Regular people don’t want to drive around in a Mars warthog"

yea how is that not powered.
They should have made that a power liftgate.  Seriously. Dumb.

"> but this definitely won’t do that

Why not?"
I agree with you.  I thought it was a joke and they were going to bring out the real truck any minute.
"What about Hondas truck, Nissan, and Toyota?"
"What?

This thing is ugly, but it has more functionality than any truck ever has...

If you took a generator and an air compressor and put it in an F150, that whole package would STILL have less functionality than the Cybertruck."
I use my truck every day for work. I watched the presentation as well. It looks like this would serve all my needs adequately. Did you watch the presentation? It may look bizarre but functionally it appears to exceed my silverado.
Can you explain how so?
[deleted]
What do you mean? it has better functionality than a traditional truck.....
"I don’t know about like hotcakes.. Im a Ford salesman here, and the truck market is difficult already, (Elon knows this, and that’s why he’s been taking a long time to develop it) and the customers are already afraid of technologically advanced trucks. Hell it’s difficult enough to convince someone in their 35s+ that a turbocharged V6 engine can be better than a V8. To them they grew up with easy to work on, simple V8 trucks. Then price. Our trucks that cost $40-$50 grand, with $10,000+ in savings, and  people are still reluctant to spend that much for a truck regardless of how much more technology we have in them. I don’t know where Elon will price these things, but I can only see them selling well in about 5 states until our whole country starts getting excited about EV technology and not just a few states. Wish that wasn’t the case!"
Pretty sure that’s exactly what they’re doing ... in their own Tesla kind of way...
"Ehhh its a concept car, I really wouldnt be that worried about it hehe."
All reservation fees are now $100. Not just the truck.
Yeah $100 is crazy low.
">ZOMG my stock

Don't you know by now that you always sell Tesla right before a reveal, then buy it for cheap afterwards while it slowly climbs until the next?!

Or until he does/says something stupid and it crashes and you say aw shit. But seriously, Tesla stock is a rollercoaster."
Yup.  Cybrtrk is exactly what I would want in Mars.
I think this will be up to preorders but I honestly don’t see them redesigning this.
Nah they probably breathed a huge sigh of relief.
"You could post the one from South Park too, but need to mark NSFW."
"Great,parity in the world of EV is a good thing.

Also, we've only had a small peek at what the truck has to offer, plenty more to come."
"Maybe, but the base model Rivian still comes in at the same price as the top of the line Cybertruck."
Where we're going we don't need roads.
Utilitarian in what way? It certainly does not look aerodynamic. Flat sheets are also impractical with regard to bending stiffness. At best it looks simple/cheap to manufacture.
"At least it's something different. All the pickup trucks look the same. Create, innovate, annihilate your enemies with your Cybertruck."
I would pay double if it did those things
I'm 95% sure we **will** see it in Rocket League as a special skin at some point lol
"Well, you have a few years before you have to sell your car."
"It's hilariously polarizing! I love everything about it, and I'm still laughing that they had the balls to release it.  Preordered and I really hope it's a success."
"Yea I'm always telling people how Tesla is a legit car company and not laughable at all, and then they go and turn a 3rd grader's drawing into an actual vehicle.  Goddammit."
Sell it immediately
Lmao!! Wut?
"""Brands suck"" -Elon"
"I was hoping the “one more thing” was going to be, we also made a more traditional looking truck, and here it is, as they roll out a second truck"
"Yep, was ready to dump my 2020 tacoma for this. But a big NOPE from me now...."
"Disagree. Think it really breaks the mold here (think hummer/Range Rover x pickup).

My guess is they will eventually release a non-cyberpunk version of the truck. 

Same way they did with  the initial roadster and then the model s"
You honestly think this is the real look? Honestly?
"Alright that CUV Mustang thing was absolutely dope. And has a far better exterior design than the Model X....


Like I like Tesla's as much as everyone here. But the X's design is horrid. Even in person. The 3 looked bad initially but seeing it in person it's so sleak and nice. Like the S"
Elaborate
What marketing ploy? Please help me understand.
go on....
I see it and love the marketing ploy!
"Put out a shitty car

People make fun of it

Stock tanks

"To sell ATVs? Otherwise, no I don't."
A bunch of lines? Nah. The appeal of their models is how curvy and simplistic they area.
That wouldn't be good for business
"If you asked me 10 minutes ago I would have said this truck was kind of goofy looking. Standing next to this Tesla monstrosity though, damn, its a supermodel"
Fool’s
They opened when the drivers got out. But yeah another unrehearsed presentation.
There won’t be paint. That’s the point. Paint scratches. Stainless steel doesnt.
6 people climbed out of it. of course they opened them
"A pic of the interior is on the website. And ""they didn't even open"" the doors? 6 people literally climbed out of the truck, dude..."
"Why is RWD a bummer? A lot of people drive trucks for the storage/cargo space, and very few people drive them so they can drive off-road.

250 mile range is what the majority of cars get. I don't know any electric car owners that complain about their range and most get less than that."
"That’s what I’m hoping, I like bargains"
Cause its really bad looking.
That was futuristic in the 80's.
It looks like a car in an atari game
Because it looks like something I designed in first grade?
Cause it’s actually pretty ugly
"Without making a judgment about whether it looks good or not, it’s obviously radically different from other truck designs. When you design something that deviates from the norm, you’re going to get more people who love it and more people who hate it."
Somehow they figured out a way to make the Pontiac Aztec look good.
It looks unfinished and half arsed. Looks like they had to rush to get something released and let the junior engineer loose the pencil and ruler.
It’s *different*
Reminds me of the cars in Upgrade.
Looks like something out of bladerunner but boxified.
"Because it's not futuristic lmao, its retro."
It grows on you
"> This will sell zero units to the current buyers of trucks

It will sell a lot of units to people who never thought of buying the current ugly ass trucks available."
I'm pretty sure that kind of steering wheel isn't even street legal.
"I don't know how you can tell the interior is flimsy.  And you can see tiedowns inside the bed - little 45 degree angle things at the lower corners. 

I am a little concerned about the rake of the windshield too."
"Def not going to be used by anyone as a work truck. Or anything utilitarian at all. Its just going to be another g class. 

Anyways, if i was going to buy a truck, i would want it to be gas or diesel, especially if i was  hauling things that ran off gas."
Lots of assumptions without real data in your post. I hope you're not a decision maker in your line of work. :)
Thanks Ford!

"Voice commands can make up for using the touch screen (keep in mind this is 2 years away, and i'm almost positive you will be able to control anything in the car with a voice command). That won't be the production steering wheel, guaranteed."
Lol
It’s okay to admit Tesla made a misstep....
"If you think this subreddit is filled with boomers, you're mistaken."
"You have to admit this is a really polarizing design choice. The specs are phenomenal, but that body shape is just...weird."
"Hi Millennial here.  It looks like ass.

More like,

ITT:  bunch of Elon fanbois defending an ass design.

Moreover, Boomers grew up with trucks in the 50's and 60's that were very utilitarian; nowhere near the look of the bro trucks you see today.  This truck is 100% not farm or worksite useable."
"It's cool that you just found the meme  ""boomer"" that everyone and their dog is using right now, but this is the wrong subreddit. You'll find that the majority of people here are millennial's."
$100 deposit is standard for all of their vehicles now.
It would be a joke for them to just cancel the thing. That would look worse for the company than the truck itself.
it didnt even have mirrors
"This is false. No reason to do this and it would only hurt the company. 

Nice concern trolling though"
"As someone that loved it from the get-go, sadly I think you’re right."
Wanna bet on it? :P
I guess they could redesign while keeping the same features.
"Also Stainless is a terrible idea, and bulletproof glass is illegal on mass-produced cars. This prototype clearly has the required safety glass. Really strange how it has some street legal aspects though, like the glass, and the extra tail lights inside the non-moving gate jamb."
Is there a YouTube link of Tesla's stream? I was hoping to watch on my TV via Chromecast.
Except for looking at it
"He said self-driving is included, does the website to preorder for $100 deviate from that?"
"Removable cap, not a hatchback."
"I believe they currently only have one cybertruck made (the one used for the reveal yesterday), which is the dual motor AWD version"
They used the dual engine one.  Musk said that this is the same truck in the pull video.  Then mkbhd posted a video saying that the same truck was used for test rides and it was the dual more version.
"If Rivian can’t convince them, nothing will."
"I was excited for this but I’m just gonna buy the Electric F150 now in 21.

Looks like a truck and can tow a million train cars? Yes please."
I noticed that too! Wonder what their solution is going to be.
"wait,  it is a joystick to drive that car?"
^^^yoke
"It has air suspension, I imagine you’ll be able to lower and raise it. 

Speed of a Porsche, functionality of a F150"
"Good point on not just reaching over the rails to get stuff.

For your other points, it has a self-adjusting air ride. In the demo, it squatted the rear to make loading the atv easier, then went back up when the gate was closed."
I think Frontier owners should be looking at the Atlas.
It has air suspension that can raise and lower it several inches and load level it. It also has a front trunk to put smaller stuff in.
You have a midzise pickup (nissan frontier?). I don't think the Cybertruck is meant to compete against the practicality of smaller pickups. I personally have a Mini-truck toyota and yeah the smaller ones are better than it's bigger counterparts for a lot of different reasons. I wouldn't trade my toyota especially since they don't make them as light and small anymore. So you might wanna hold onto your frontier until companies come out with an actual reasonable pickup for normal people.

Precisely!
"Let me explain myself since apparently my comment is controversial. Truck guys, for the most part, are utilitarian.  Trucks are made for work, they should be valued heavily for function over form. They should be rugged and reliable, be able to withstand abuse and damage.  The more utility the better.  Anesthetics can still be a consideration, but not at the expense of any, or much, functionality.

If you consider yourself a truck guy, and are immediately turned off by this, for *only* aestheic reasons, you're kind of missing the point of a truck."
Not this.
Something that looks like an actual automobile
"A more conventional looking truck, with some nice visual flare. Not a vehicle pulled right out of a sci-fi movie. In fairness, I'm looking at the pictures on the website, and it looks much better in natural environments, but I think this is too out there for most truck buyers."
"I dunno, but I wasn't expecting a polygon as basic as this."

A truck ?
"This is a metal box. You can’t poke fun at truck design, and then so entirely miss what makes truck design so classic and popular.

"America is an odd market.  Explain the desire for a 4x4, $60k truck that burns $2000 a year in gas for your daily stop and go commuter.  “I go hunting 2 times a year and move 1 fridge every 10 years.  Must have a 10 foot high truck lifted for those needs”"
"The exoskeleton design in an exercise in good specs for a low price, the armoured truck aspect a side-effect of that. So I don't think armoured truck is their primary market."
"They're creating it. Now I don't think it is going to be the next big thing, but people will buy them, as long as development costs were too crazy they'll make some money on it"
"""If you think Detroit is bad now wait until the F-150 factory starts laying workers off"""

"This comes up with electric vehicles quite a bit. It seems the reality is that solar cells produce so little electricity on a small car surface that it wouldn't really make a difference. If you were to get stranded because you are out of batteries, you very likely will walk to civilization faster than the car could go off you include waiting for charge by sun."
"I'm nowhere near an expert or educated on this, but my guess has always been the small amount of energy that would generate is not worth packing panels and generators into the car. More risks for fire too maybe. Because this is something I've been dying to see, the whole roof is glass already!

But yes, I think we're just not there yet technologically. But hey, I'll take my realistic Warthog. Now...if only he'd get started in the Banshee..."
"With current solar technology, it is not possible to put solar panels on the car and receive any reasonable amount of charge. Even if the full surface would be covered in solar panels, it would take days to charge to half (could be more or less, I don't know the battery voltage and stuff). Depending on the battery, the voltage you could receive from solar panels wouldn't even be enough to charge at all. 
Even with solar cities technology, it's not possible to create solar charging for a car. Also, solar panels would be weak points in crashes and in driving off road etc."
"LOL you could charge this thing in bright sun light for a week and maybe drive it 500ft downhill. Solar is junk.

\>Most people buying a truck intend to take it places cars can't go

Nope, most people use their truck to get groceries and take the kids to school."
You would need some sort of massive unfolding solar array stored in the bed of the truck.
"Electrek says Tesla will offer a solar option: ""Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla’s new Cybertruck electric pickup truck will be offered with a solar roof option over the truck’s bed that will be able to add 15 miles of range per day.""

"Got to keep in mind this is a car that must meet safety protocols. Maybe adding solar panels is doable, but it might drive up costs significantly."
I think once they are on the road and ppl see them everyone is going to change their mind. Same thing with others. The thing has so many awesome features and the performance and cost of ownership. I would buy one over other trucks currently
That thing couldn't be more ugly unless it was some florescent color.

he is one of the worst public speakers I think I've ever watched.
"There's at least one [interior pic](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck) on the website. Looks like it takes its design out of the model 3, with no instrument cluster behind the steering wheel. Landscape orientation of the touch screen, which is described as having an all-new customizable interface.

Also the render includes the dumb steering ""wheel"" that we saw in the roadster 2.0 reveal instead of a traditional round wheel. I can't imagine that will make it to production.

Honestly, overall the interior is pretty underwhelming, and I mean that in a good way, given the dumpster fire that is the rest of this truck. The exterior is obviously unlike anything we've seen of Tesla before this, but the inside is simple and based on what works from the Model 3 (aside from the weird roadster steering wheel)"

"It's storage. The back. They said ""under the sail pillars"" somewhere, so I'm guessing the sloping rear side is called a sail pillar (makes sense)."
looks like a cover for charging port. perhaps behind left passenger window
"I believe it's for storage, and it is toward the back, just after the side windows."
Thats the back.  The slant down from the cab.
Storage? Looks like the front because of the shorter distance from wheels to bumper.

"Was the glass breaking actually a mistake?  It probably only provided more press (I personally googled to find the video) and therefore was a positive.  I didn't watch the presentation and wouldn't have known about the ""bulletproofness"" otherwise"
"Seriously, this had potential until I saw the design. It's right in my price range at the low end but no way I would be caught dead in that."
That is something I haven't seen anyone else address. I do wonder if that opens up more liability concerns. I would also be interested in seeing crash testing comparisons to more traditional trucks.
"
>Is an automobile allowed to have that kind of pointy corners?  
  
It doesn't have pointy corners."
"Aerodynamics, maybe."
They probably will.
It was never intended for Mass production
"You're basing that on your personal opinion. For me this is the single coolest looking automobile I have ever seen and I will definitely be buying one. This car is designed to be divisive, so that it elicits strong feelings both ways. Thing is, if you get a percentage of people to really love it, they'll find a way to buy it."
"This isn't for Tesla fanbase. 99% of people driving Model S, doesn't need truck like this. This is for entire new market, trying to prove that EV can be as tough as F150, cheaper to maintenance and run. For some people it's ugly (I love it tho) but most people who actually use trucks for work and not to compensate for their d*** size, it might be good deal."
"If someone has the money for a Tesla vehicle anyways, I don't see why not. It has good performance and range, and pickup utility. It'll be something you were glad you drove for whatever time you drive it im sure"
I like the idea they just went too far with it imo.
"the tray doesn't look convenient to use so it's not only ugly but less practical than other cars

trays on pickups all have the same shape (and height for the most part) so it's easy to grab stuff from any point of it and make it easy to strap things down"
"I'm afraid your comment is indicative of how Wall Street will react. Frankly, I wish at least the presentation was better. He barely showed the features, or the interior. No videos of this thing driving on the road, so we get a feel for it. And the glass window demo... this is why you don't do demos like this."
Musk reads these comments and I hope he sees yours. This is too far out there and it won't sell except fanboys.  To reach the masses they need a boring F150 clone.  It isn't cool but it would sell and help the brand.  The Cybertruck is going to hurt the brand.
"I drive a 2500 truck.  I put all sorts of stuff in the bed and pull camper trailer.  I haul payloads over 2k pounds.  I need flat bed rails to apply decking and tool mounts. 

I can’t do shit with this design.  Cool I can put my MTn bikes back there but that doesn’t help with anything else.  I held off buying a new ram hoping I could make the new electric truck work.  I replaced my commuting car with public transit and a ebike.  I wanted this to be a truck I could get others in my circle (lifted diesels and souped up 1/2 tons) excited about and work towards a better future.  Tesla fucked that up big time.  All you had to do was make it a little more truck like and you would have sold a shit ton of them.  So I’ll go get the new ram and revisit an etruck in 5 years."
"100% agree

They nailed it with the S and 3

X could afford to be different given the market it was going after.  

This makes no sense."
">Tesla has a real opportunity to continue to revolutionize the automobile market, but it's not going to happen with goofy concept pickup trucks that won't scratch the surface of market share.

Perfectly said. This thing is way too niche in terms of design. No contractor is going to get made fun of for the rest of his life by pulling up to the job site in this."
"Pack it up, boys, this guy doesn’t like it."
"This actually does compete with the F150/Ram. You just don't like the look of it. Many likely won't. But it absolutely has the performance of those two trucks, or better:

Has the towing capacity of the F250 with a better payload capacity than a F150. Straight line performance better than a Porche 911. Literally it might be able to do 0-60-0 in the same time a normal F-150 can go 0-60 (that would be insane). Air Suspension standard. 120/220V chargers built in along with Air compressor. 6.5 ft Bed length. Better aerodynamics are pretty much guaranteed. Seats more people and has more interior room in general. Has up to 2x as much ground clearance as standard due to the air suspension.

And since it's electric it will save a shit load on fuel, since pickup trucks are extremely inefficient, especially the heavier duty ones like the F250. And the charging ability is going to be better than the S&X."
"To be fair, there was 0 chance Tesla was going to win over the die hard F150, Silverado, or Ram fans.  

It's not for me, but maybe it'll grow on me.  I think the goal of this truck was to be extremely practical and get people who always wanted a truck to finally get one."
"I think you miss one little thing here: it's not a luxury truck, it's a utility truck that is made for another category of people that don't buy S3XY and the Roadster.

I would probably buy it as a third car for traveling. But it's only because I don't need a truck. I will go for the roadster, that's for sure. Then - will see. But this thing isn't half bad, but it is controversial, that's for sure. People need some time to process it. It's too different from anything on the market nowadays."
Everytime they hit it with something I thought the side panels would drop off to reveal the real thing. Nope
"There were a handful of funny digs at the Ford presentation earlier this week. Like the ""not CGI"" line. Made me LOL"
It looks so good i pre-ordered :D
Apparently it has a completely new chassis design for a truck and it requires all those straight lines and flat panels. Compare an F-117 to a B-2. They will learn how to curve the body a lot more just like the learning between those 2 planes. I suspect it will look a lot different in 5 years. The ATV is so cool.
"Normal is relative my dude, current cars probably look weird too in comparison to how the first cars looked."
Why couldn’t it look like that render we saw a while back...
rivian has a pickup and suv that look normal if a bit more rounded and aerodynamic. dunno if they are still varpoware.
I had the same thoughts last night. I’m really let down honestly.
"Im trying to stay open minded.  When the model 3 was released, I **hated** the lack of a grill on the front end, I mean I really hated it.  Now, I am okay to slightly favorable of it.

That took me a couple years to settle into, I am going to give this such an amount of time to grow on me."
"It’s different, but I think more and more we’ll see different looking vehicles. It really has that “futuristic” look to it."
"LOL, this is probably going to be the safest consumer vehicle you can buy. The crumple zone is plenty big, it's a massive fucking truck, and there's no engine up front. The only thing I have questions about in terms of safety are the windows, I could do without the armor glass."
"Denial ✅

Why would they make this trucks price point $40k then? I would understand throwing a ton of tech at it to make a supercar (or truck in this case) but I don't think this is what this is.
You're gonna wind up with 3 conciliatory flame throwers instead of this fake truck
So how do we translate our Reservation numbers to figure out our place in line?
"Yeah, I definitely scoffed at first. Seeing the tailgate/bed, specs and price are what actually made me come around to it."
Except the cyber truck will start a fraction of the price and not look like a high school auto class slapped it together the last week before summer. $125k for that? Fuck outta here.
"The Atlis XT looks good too 

https://www.atlismotorvehicles.com/"
"Nah, I’d choose Rivian"
"No. This was a terrible idea. Idk why he decided to do that. Trucks are utilitarian, and he made this toy. This truck will not be popular. It will have very few sales, and will be worth a lot of money as a collector item in the future, that's it. 

It's not beautiful, it's, not classy, it's not functional. It's a nice 80s movie prop."
ELON IS MANIPULATING THE MARKET DOWN SO US GENIUS INVESTORS CAN BUY MORE AND MAKE A BIGGER PROFIT. ALL HAIL GOD EMPEROR MUSK
"Buy, buy ,buy, now is the perfect time to get in. The stock will rebound and you will make a quick 6% profit of this gawd awful Truck abomination that will never make it to market. I expect to see a redesign soon, real soon."
"Yeah, those dudes buy 5 year old Ford's for 20k"
Definitely true. Imagine not worrying about denying up your truck while throwing a ladder or tools in the bed
You can't reach into the bed from the side though.
They literally showed nothing on its capabilities to do this outside of towing. They don’t know the audience at all. That cab looks tiny.
"Short bed?

Edit: 6'5""
Not bad!"
"Yea, we thought we didn't care about looks......until now."
K
Ridiculous to think there isn’t s line. Don’t know a single truck driver that would be caught dead driving this.
"Ask any truck owner, it’s missing a lot of boxes lol"
Gee... I wonder where this guy lives
Can't load stuff in over the sides of the bed :/

"I think it looks pretty cool, though I can see how it is polarizing."
"it's a cyberpunk design, if it wasn't cyberpunk people would call Elon Musk a liar (again) for not launching a cyberpunk truck like he said he would. It's a cool design, it's just really different from what's out there, but I agree it might be TOO different for a lot of people."
No no they won’t
"No, it's pretty fucking hideous."
Nope

I thought it was a joke so I ordered it.  But I have a pending charge on my credit card
it's so ugly it's almost beautiful to the believers...i think i might just be a believer...
Pontiac Aztek anyone? PT Cruiser? Prius? Nissan fucking Juke? I could go on
"Just curious, what was the thing 15 years ago? I think this thing might be the ugliest car I've ever seen."
But they weren't supposed to break
No one else throws metal spheres at their cars in live demos lol.
Which is why they don't brag about how durable they are and throw heavy shit at them during a reveal.
"We know, but the demo failed. It never looks good to fail a demo."
Any other manufacturer wouldn't have thrown a steel ball at them on live TV.  Stop at the test you did in a controlled environment.
Lol that's fair
Eh. I think it looks awesome. Maybe your taste isn't the end of the world?
Rivian doesn’t have a single stat going for it now. Except it looks more like a traditional boring truck. Starting rivian price is 69k or you could buy a indestructible tank for 39k
What will they do at the bank seeing as they sell nothing?
*lego
Okay boomer
Or we just like the design
i like cyberpunk angles tho
Tech dudes 40+ are pretty tickled by this.  Very Aliens/Robocop/Terminator feel. It’s ridiculous looking but outperforms everything.
Literally 99% of the comments during the event were about how ugly it is.
"Yeah, called my dad (lifelong F150 guy) and asked him what he thought of it. All he said was ""well that was disappointing."""
What blind fanboys are you talking about? Like someone else said 99% of the comments are riffing on the design.
"Except utility is why people buy trucks, not looks."
Damn that looks sick
"The actual truck is far more efficient, the shape is slippery AF."
Im sad
rip pedestrians.
yeah the lack of crumple zone (which is necessary for a car to be street legal) is what’s throwing me off. I don’t think tesla engineers are incompetent enough to just forget about it.
I'm 100% sure it will pass safety testing.
I feel confident it’s a joke for all these reasons. But it’s throwing me off that so many are taking it seriously.
[deleted]
The other cars will do the crumpling. And you don't need mirrors when you have cameras and Lane assist.
"> There's no way this thing is going to pass any sort of safety testing.

I’ll take that bet and you name the amount. Any amount is fine with me."
[deleted]
its over
3rd grader render more like it
"Yes, I had the same thought. It would look so much better if the bed was more traditional. I know they made it the way they did for aerodynamics to get better efficiency but it would look so much better if they removed the raised sides and sloped back on the bed of the truck."
"Yeah, it's kind of what I was going for tbh."
"yeah, that's not actually too bad.   But that part probably has a lot to do with aerodynamics"
Yea I felt the same way. Would make the bed feel wider. Also the pointed front window panes should just be stainless too.
This looks like a slipper version of those Kobe sneakers that were supposed to look like Audis.
"The website shows accessories for the bed so it seems like it’s functional. Idk though and if that’s the case it was a missed opportunity to highlight the trucks functionality.

I’m really struggling with the styling."
Really.  I want to know what the specs and availability on that will be.
"I think the design is outrageous, and I like it."
I really like it
"> Nobody would be caught dead driving this thing.

The pre-order site already crashed sooooo?"
"The amount of people putting in deposits says otherwise. I mean yeah, it's 100% refundable and potentially EVERYBODY could pull their deposits, but it'll be interesting to find out how many reservations they receive tonight."
"> To say the design was stupid is offensive to truly stupid shit. 

So you're saying it's stupid to think the design is stupid."
Accurate.
I think your really mad a bold assumption
[removed]
OK boomer
That just means I'm closer to the front of the line.
"Looks don’t matter for a truck, what you call a truck.. is fake tough."
">This actually annoys me as a stockholder.

It annoys me as a member of the public. Your shares affect all of us!

As a public company, they're supposed to be providing goods and services and increased value for all of us. Not doing weird lame stuff for fun....

Not to mention.. This doesn't help the world transition to EVs.. this explains the whole ""durr durr, maybe nobody will buy it, I dont care if anyone buys it, i like it"""
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder I guess. I think it looks cool as shit and revolutionary.
"I did wonder if only the windscreen is unbreakable, they forgot that or it was intentional, at least 3 possibilities here. But intentional is the least likely IMO."
He doesn’t want to sell to the masses. He said in a call that he doesn’t expect many people to like it.
I like it. Very different. An armored vehicle.
"I think they designed it having a mars rover in mind. The spec and price are great, I hate how it looks."
Rivian has awful specs compared to this.
"Time will tell. I don’t see rivian ramping up that fast and who knows what problems they’ll run into once production starts. 
I think the Ford might make a killing if they can get their electric F-150 out. 
People will buy Tesla’s off the look and rareness. It’ll have slow but steady growth."
Tesla and Rivian haven’t made or shipped any trucks. This market is still wide open. Tesla can easily change the design.
Tesla is less expensive than the base rivian and is better spec wise
Could you imagine if Keanu had stepped out... You know Elon at least had the thought.  I won't be suprised if Cyberpunk builds a reference to this into the game...
It's the 21'st century... Where we're going we don't need ~~roads~~ glass
"Bunch of bigger truck don’t have middle mirrors so that’s not a big deal, what is a big deal is the lack of side mirrors, people especially need them when towing, and bigger mirrors than normal at that, and with only 1 console screen you can’t just do cameras like on the semi..."
What does that even mean?
lmfao
Make the meme!
"Lol

A lot of low polygon jokes going around."
9:20 for the window break
"Holy shit that was hilariously bad. Like something out of a straight to VHS 90's cyberpunk ""thriller."" Unbelievable."
Try hitting it with a sledgehammer...:)
"I mean the biggest thing my dad complains about for electric cars is they can’t tow a boat or camper. They focused a lot more on towing with this than using the bed all the time which I think is the average person who just buys a truck. Most people who are constantly getting in their bed are people who use their truck for work, like tradesmen."
They probably realize most people that buy trucks never haul shit.   That’s why Jeep got in the game with the Gladiator.
"Same can be said about a countach. But it's not.

Sharp angles are shit for aerodynamics."
If they made the top of the rear passenger area flat it would look 1000% better
I think the iterations that starship has been through shows he doesn’t care about the sunk cost fallacy but it’s whether aesthetics is a good enough reason to change the design I guess
"There seems to be two ""problems"" with this truck:  
The design is, perhaps, too unique.  
The window shattered. Easily fixed in post production."
"People who aren't into cars, but are into technology are Tesla's core market. The most commonly traded in car for a Tesla is a Prius."
You definitely want to water it at least once a week if you want it to grow big and strong
"What do you think middle class means? Having a 40k-70k car is upper class (median 180k salary) at a minimum, or you’re in unnecessary debt."
The truck market is different from car market. Where I live I see $50K trucks every other vehicle on the road.
"While the price is lower than I expected, I would not say this is affordable for all the middle class, unless I am no longer in the middle class. Paycheck to paycheck and no way I would be able to budget 600 a month for a car..."
Exactly he’s making electric for everyone
Of course it will. There's nothing that you could do against it. More weight = more power consumption. It doesn't matter if it's a electric car or a fossil fuel car
I’m sure. The numbers for mileage are probably either 1 person or full capacity (not including bed load).
[deleted]
"I don’t know about you, but in my opinion, butts are sexy."
"Pretty sure that a picture on the ""we will take your money here"" page means that it is the real product. There are 8, maybe 12, people out there who have now put money down to get something that meets those expectations."
"My hope is that they redesign the body after the inevitable poor response. Like you said it has good bones, but its just so damn ugly."
"dont think he had a real good say, think this was Elon pushing for what he wanted instead of thinking what would be a good mass market design"
Im concerned they can’t meet the price because demand wont feed enough production
"The company that makes nothing and has no service, charging or sales infrastructure? Definitely not too early to crown them the winner, what with a F-150 EV coming soon..."
They're still gonna sell these things. It's not like only one company gets to sell a product
No it isn't. Tesla aren't trendsetters for design.
How the hell is looking like an 80's Delorean a step into the 20's?
Please not.
"My dude we've had boxy looking triangle shit since the 70's. This design is 40 years old, easily.

"Have you ever been on a reddit livestream.

That said it’s a bit polarizing design choice."
Nearly all EV designs these days are 'forward' and Tesla was successful for not making 'forward' looking cars that people actually bought.
Yes
Are you 14 years old? I love teslas but cmon this is ridiculous
Almost all car unveils don’t include side mirrors.  Industry standard.
"Dear lord, every time. They never have side mirrors on the concept cars. Actual release candidates will unless the laws have been changed by then."
"It had those roof lights for towing, so that’s something."
"Neither does the 2020 Roadster, yet. Just wait until the final comes around."
Cameras
"Elon didn't say that, Cheddar said that. Cheddar is completely unrelated to Tesla."
"14,000 towing, but Pulling was infinite."
It is in the same league of outrageousness as a hummer but just much better for the environment.
"Pretty poor reason to order, this will sell just fine even with all the people upset about the look."
"The only people who hated on the og tesla were skeptical about ability of electric. That's been proven now, and as far as specs go, this truck is killer. Nobody ever complained about looks, and I don't think anyone would be caught driving this thing outside of the fringe fanbois with too much money to waste."
I wish I was in a financial position to order a $40k just to upset strangers on the internet. Congratulations on your success.
Remind me to laugh at you on monday.
How are you figuring less cargo space (unless you're talking 8ft bed)?
Why make a truck that looks like every other truck? The specs blow everything else the others are making.
Because Tesla...?
BOX TRUUUUCK
Rivian specs don’t compare in any way. The target audience for this won’t care about looks. Just specs
"No, no. Close that door."
So did the Chevy Avalanche and Escalade EXT. Don’t see many of those anymore...
One thing about the design - the space where an ICE engine would go is just removed - which is a big step.
"It doesn't look like any other truck but how is it not a truck? Specs of a truck for sure and by most descriptions of a truck, it's a truck"
This looks like a bad freshman automotive design concept.
"Wow, at least one other person who likes it. I thought I was alone."
Yikes
Lol.
"It looks like a Countach, but without the beauty."
"The truck is ugly, my guy."
"The design aesthetics are bad-ass in my opinion.

Seems like a love-it-or-hate-it thing. I'm not hearing a whole lot of ambivalent opinions."
"He doesn't care if people buy it: https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18055158/elon-musk-tesla-pickup-truck-bladerunner-futuristic

This is a project he really wanted to do and is excited about. It won't hurt them"
"The point is very much structural integrity - its basically sacrifing aesthetics for hardiness, while still being aesthetically pleasing to certain people."
8 minutes late.. stop fucking whining
Yeah the price was a legit shock lol
Yea def good prices. 40k for 250 miles is good in my books!!! But is it even road legal? It looks like it'll chop people in half lol
"Silly, embarrassing window stunts are forgiven as far as I’m concerned. Wowza, what a price!"
"$40k for this, but $80k for a Model S :)

Public company using public funds, providing goods and services to the public!"
"Because of the monocoque hull.  They made a literal bullet-resistant (unless Fronz (sp) is shooting it) truck.  Look at how the military does their MRAPs, it's monocoque, the frame is the body.  And I'm in love with the functionality of it and would love one in my driveway.  And for a $100 reservation, I might throw down."
With those tough doors and bulletproof (ish) glass it's going to be a hit with drug dealers.
"It looks good pulling that trailer on the webpage - because the trailer is the same weird hard-edge style.

You just gotta buy a boat from Tesla in the future now...

But in all seriousness, alone, the car doesn't look as bad as people are making it out to be. However, when you realize this would be outside your workplace, pulling a *normal* trailer, boat, whatever it ends up awkward. It just doesn't fit the current landscape. Who knows, maybe it will be like the original iPhone and launch a whole new design for vehicles and their accessories - it already has an ATV - but I doubt it."
Wouldn’t a model X work for you then?
They have 2 years to figure that out
"It's functionally strong though, it's not just a shell."
"No offense, but that doesn’t make the design good"
Woah get a load of money bags over here
"Nice try, Elon."
No it’s ugly don’t act all woke
"What is beautiful is always odd?

Nope, not always.  Many beautiful things approximate some Platonic ideal or another.  Sure, beautiful things can be odd, not denying that, but it’s not mandatory.  Also, not all odd things are beautiful.  Plenty of odd things are ugly as hell.  Take, for instance, the cybertruck."

They’re taking preorders.
Elon likes steel because its much stronger at cryogenic temperatures.
Isn't the roadster triple motor as well?
Pretty sure it’s one motor for the front axle and two for the rear.
Usually three motors mean one motor for front axle and one for each rear wheel
Not a hoax but depending on response from people they might change it. I know they said they will release a more traditional truck if this flops.
"Definitely not a hoax, this is a 60B dollar company, you don't joke about things like this.

Steel is actually a great material, there is a reason they are using it on rockets.

The truck is very aerodynamic due to the wedge shape, you don't get that performance/cost from an electric without aero.

Thee motor setups are pretty standard for performance electrics.

Yea it looks strange because there is nothing like it, but that's about it."
[The Homer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHGczDHTDpo)
It looks like it’s from the imagination of a 5 year old
Tell boomers that trucks are for utility and not going 30 kph on their way to sit in the Tim Hortons drive through 4x a day.
"> the truck will be] a better sports car than a standard [Porsche] 911

Uh Huh"
Okay that 300k lbs is a typo. Typical trucks do 5k-10k
Electric cars have insane performance compared to ICE cars but get suffer from heat problems quickly. These stats are probably true but only for a few minutes.
You think the people who buy an F-150 will want this thing? He's not touching that market.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHGczDHTDpo
I’m sure the ATV was like a side project for Franz
It’s barely 1000 more that a f150
It was on the right of that slide.
"Lmao, someone salty?"
">So for the actual “truck” version, it’s $70000 ... The car that looks like a low polygon ps1 with 2wd is $39000.

Who says that trucks need to be all wheel drive? If you just need it to tow stuff, not to go off-road, 2wd is fine.

>if you scratch it or dent it, I can’t imagine the cost for repair

How exactly do you dent it? You can’t dent it with a sledgehammer.

>(super strong glass) isn’t strong.

It’s stronger than regular car glass, as demonstrated by the vertical ball drop test."
"if rivian comes out not fucked, i'll be shocked. rivian is a completely unproven manufacturing company."
The steel is probably not that much to fix and the entry is definitely a good deal
Rivian is a short wheelbase compact truck
Stop looking at the Canada site
Muahaha must have got in just in time for $100 yay!
Live in canada?
Still says 100 for me
still shows 100 for me
"6.5ft is not laughably small.

Seems like just about any EV would be a reasonable commuter compared to an ICE equivalent (if that is your comparison).

It definitely isn’t for everyone, but it is certainly functional.  If it looked more “traditional” everyone would be preordering.  The functionality seems great. Huge caveat is range with a load, need to know that."
It says the bed is 6.5 feet but the ATV barely fits. I dob't get it. Where the fuck did the bed cover go?
The bed is 6.5ft long.
"Same here.  I go off-road for hunting, pull a boat, haul shit around in my F150.

I put a deposit down for this.  As long as they work out a few kinks I plan to get it."
"> Nobody: “Elon, what would it look like if John DeLorean designed the El Camino?”

Haha! You about made me fall off my treadmill desk!"
I don't think any EV has gone quite this direction lol
I hope my stop limit triggers and sells. Maybe I can buy back after it pulls back....150 points or so and then hopefully FSD brings it back up.
"This. If I'd have spare money to invest, I'd look into buying Tesla stock tomorrow. It is going to nosedive hard as the price had baked in some ""Tesla comes and takes F150s cookies"" into it going into the unveil."
"Im a truck guy. Every vehicle i have had (other then my first car, that was a mustang) has been a truck. I use my truck for work (contractor who uses both the bed and towing capacity almost daily) and play (camping and 4x4 / quading). I was looking forward to this launch more then Christmas this year. There is NO way im buying this wannabe Aztec, no matter how much i wanted a Tesla."
No it’s ugly as hell
">this isn't a boomer thing man, this is just fuck ugly

Yah hate/like for this crosses generational boundaries.  It's maybe more in line with ""truck people"" vs ""non-truck people""... in that truck people want trucks to look and function more or less like trucks have always functioned.  Non-truck people may accept this more easily.  I look at it like a Honda Ridgeline or Chevy Avalanche.  Many truck guys don't like those either.  They're different looking and don't have the same capacity as a typical truck.  Some like, some don't.  They're a compromise vehicle."
I'm not a Boomer and I think this is objectively ugly
"'87 here.

Can confirm that it's ugly as sin and that a proper truck design would've done _much_ more for revolutionizing a highly pollutant segment of vehicles.  That opportunity has been squandered now."

Not a boomer either. Ugly is ugly mate.
Lmao don't have to be a boomer to see this thing is ugly af.

$34k for a new 2500 series truck? In what world?
I think it has something to do with what someone can tow without a commercial license or vehicle and less to do with reality.
"> $34k petrol 2500HD

Uh... What? You can barely get a 4wd Tacoma for that kinda money."
"The same reason why a 70k Ford F150 Platinum cant tow the same as a 2500hd Base model. Technology, features, performance."
People don't only use trucks for towing.

what was the tl;dw on the lack of colors again? I think I probably missed it. Just the stainless steel color?
"Yea... I don’t understand why they didn’t just make a normal truck first. Best case is that Tesla didn’t actually spend much money on this and it was more of a passion project with minimal resources allocated to it.

Difficult to burn or rust stainless steel. Checkmate.

"In theory, aren't people who buy trucks after functionality more than aesthetics?"
Ok boomer
"If it was rounded it would be a lot more expensive to manufacture. I'm not fan of tesla design language, but I like this. However, being a car person I can notice that the whole design of this truck is focused on keeping manufacturing cost and issues to a minimum."
Where is this from?
[deleted]
Get it wrapped
It's stainless like the delorean so yeah
"Considering it is stainless steel, yeah, probably."
"lol that's what most people care about and this is definitely not going to resonate well with a very, very large portion of people"
Better than a normal truck simply because the bed cover is built in.
Probably great.

"Ya, I’m interested in the crumple features.. I thought they used to make cars indestructible but changed it when people died instead of the cars"
No side mirrors??????? Omg
Tesla doesn't make vehicles that don't top safety ratings for their category. That's a silly worry to have.
interesting. The not cramping thing. But you'd be safe if you're inside though. Also chances if anyone surviving being hit by the cyber truck and an F150 are about the same I'd guess.
What do you mean you see no airbags? It obviously has airbags look at the interior photos.
"I think they will push the release of this truck to when full self driving is legal in the US. If FSD becomes law, there will be no need for any side mirrors. Now for the tough ""exoskeleton"" not crumpling, I cant think of a reasonable safety explination for that other than I think this truck was built for mars instead of earth."

Ford plans on releasing an electric F150
I read somewhere that elon plans to make a not so futuristic truck in the future for people not into this design.
He said exactly what it was going to be.
All their cars are
Yup. No brainer. Done
Anti car? I mean I don't like car pollution either but it's a necessary evil that I can't avoid in my life. How do you get around? Do you live in a city with public transportation?
It’s only one of the fastest if you get the dual or tri motor variants at 50k or 70k
no one cares
Won't hamper me. I like it.
"As far as all electric pickups go, it’ll be only-in-class"
Nah
Right but the F150 its aiming at is the best selling vehicle of any kind (or at least it was when I last checked a decade ago) in the country. You need more than the rich novelty buyers to buy in.
I don't think we can compare apple sleek design with this piece of shit

not a day has passed and i already like it"
"It's a real shame, the numbers are great and it has a lot of neat features like the tailgate ramp and kneeling suspension (great for someone like myself that is constantly loading and unloading heavy stuff from the box). Stainless is a great material for a hardworking truck.

But it's so goddamn ugly. Honestly, what were they thinking with that blank front end. Two regular headlights and a grille would have gone a long ways toward making this look like a truck."
and i want one so bad. CYBERTRUCK!
Omg I love you for this! I forgot about this guy! Goths give me diarrhea hahaha VVVVRRROOOOOMMMMMM.......F
Rockets will never land
"Serious question, what law/regulations for you know this truck breaks so it can't be sold? Or you are saying it can't be marketed as a truck?"
Do you think they didn't look at the laws when designing this?
Well you can buy one right now sooooo.....
Like a PT Cruiser but less good looking.
In what part it isn’t utilitarian? It beats the f-150 in every way.
i can't afford the blow to support this lifestyle
Take a look at the presentation - the back retracts to expose the bed like in a normal truck. It’s covered both for aerodynamics as well as to secure anything left in the bed that wouldn’t otherwise stick out.
"You can see its main site, the truck bed is not permanently covered:  [https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck)"
I have seen the back open and stay open like a regular truck.
They will be working on Mars. Taxiing Arnold Schwarzenegger to see Cohagen.
"The whole point is a retro future delorean look, I want one because I think it will get a re design pretty quickly and it will be a collector's item"
"> Reminds me of the DeLorean

Don't insult the DeLorean.  This thing is hideous on a whole other level.  I cannot believe Elon signed off on this design."
Like if a DeLorean and a Lamborghini Urus had a secret baby.
"To date this is the ugliest vehicle I've ever seen. Whether it makes up for it in performance capability, or it crashes and burns.... Either way. I don't really care. I just stumbled upon this thread while taking a shit.


Oh, time to wipe and skiddaddle. See ya."
So you admit that it is ugly but not the ugliest? 4th ugliest car then? Subjectively somebody could have ranked the top 4 ugliest cars ever and put Telsa's truck at the top.
"Bruh, I’ll just say two words:

[*Fiat Multipla*](https://sv.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Multipla#/media/Fil%3AFiat_Multipla_front_20080825.jpg)

"Seen all of those, this is still the ugliest vehicle I've ever seen.  _Ever_.

If anything, you're the sheep for eating up the whole ""different and brave"" narrative from Tesla's teat."
"I really don't get the hate on station wagons/estates, they are dope to me. I don't understand why people like suv's. Station wagon can have the performance of a car, and carrying compacity of a truck. Easier to load and look amazing. Look at the cadillac cts -v hammer, or Mercedes amg E45 wagon, or even volvo s70 wagon, or audis rs6 avant. Great performing and great looking vehicles."
We seen the PT Cruiser. Then it sold poorly and it was discontinued.
?? This truck is easily uglier than any of those you mentioned

Or are we in reality?
That's what I was thinking. You could easily make it a Suburban type vehicle as well.

What?  There is a drop down tailgate which has a ramp built-in and an adjustable height flatbed due to an adjustable wheel air suspension AND has 110v/220v power right there.  What else do you need to host a tailgate party?

It even has an air compressor builtin for beer on tap. LOL"

"[In its least expensive guise, the 250-plus-mile Cybertruck will cost $39,900. The midrange Cybertruck tacks on an extra $10,000, while the top-range, ""tri-motor"" variant comes in at $69,900.](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-unveiled-elon-musk-electric-pickup-truck/)"

It said starting at $40k in the reveal.
"Yes, it's covered by a retractable bed cover. The tailgate appears to operate as a standard tailgate but also contains a ramp."
Someone else gets your truck
"Two on the back (driving each wheel), and one at front (driving two wheels)... just guessing."
1 front 2 back
two motors side by side on the rear axle.
I'm guessing a third motor will be designed solely to aid one of the two motors. It might not even be the same as other two.
Full white body with the black metal parts will look make it look like a speedboat on wheels. Pretty sure Elon Musk ripped the design off the Ripsaw tank that he owns.
I would absolutely get one of those vehicle wraps with this truck.
Its advertised as being rear wheel drive. To get AWD you would need to move up to the mid spec version.
"yeah, they can keep skipping you if you're next up in the queue until you're ready to purchase"
If you find an answer to this can you let me know? I’m also interested in knowing.
"I see a towing capacity of 14,000 lbs on the specs for the highest priced model."
"It’s stainless steel, no paint"
"It's not spray paint, it's just unfinished stainless steel. There's no paint. It's like the Delorean basically."
Spray paint?  Where did you see spray paint? I thought it looked like a big tin can.  Still haven't decided if I like it or not.
"What, flakey graphite isn't your color of choice?"
Yea and it actually looks better.
I like this concept better than the actual Cybertruck. Now I’m sad.
That looks better
Yep. Close and better looking (though still not my taste).

"Sigh, the bulletproofness is just a biproduct of the hard exoskeleton - not a goal in itself."
"I am trying to figure out the target market for this.  I view truck buyers as looking for masculine bravado and utility.

From styling this screams dorky sci-fi - at least for me it does.  Are there enough sci-fi truck buyers out there or is my interpretation all wrong."
No lol
It was a test to see how much pressure the steel could hold so it was designed to fail essentially.
The test was designed to find the max pressure before failure.
Don’t hold your breath. Elon has been talking about how the new “truck” will be very polarizing and he knows a lot of people won’t like it. Tesla has some designs that will come out afterwards if this one doesn’t do well.
"At the reveal, the design of the car is pretty final, look at other reveal before, the cars don't significantly changes."
"not if they are sticking the the manufacture process they wont, not much anyway.

personally i would like to se that second row of seats go the journey."
"Well, it is, really- fuck’n ugly"
"I hope so (sorry) How do you know this? is there any links or timestamps you can provide that corroborates this?  
Thank you in advance :)"
what kind of sci-fi parties are you going to?
Mods mentioned before the event that they were going to lock it down for a few hours and approve on a case-by-case basis. Reading through some of the comments here makes me understand why.
It’s devolved into nothing but: “Look I have a Tesla!” posts.
"yeah, wtf?"
That is ugly.
IMO the design in link is uglier
"Same bro. Funny though, i remember people complaining about how this design wont work because the bed it ""too short or useless"" but at least you can actually set some on the side of it without it rolling off the back. Oh what could have been.

Guess im getting a Ram or waiting till ram makes and electric model."
Glad you didn't get your way. Gross.
"It's ugly af, but why were you expecting that look? All the teasers pointed to this..."
This looks amazing.
"Where did that even come from? It was everywhere and was completely wrong. I saw a thing about Elon saying the design of the truck may not be popular, and they may have to revert back to a more standard look. I wonder if this is close to the standard look they were considering."
Come with us to the future and enjoy this sexy best
This is for people who buy on specs and performance and daring design.

"It’s huge compared to a Ute. My biggest complaint is that it isn’t more cabover. It’s got a longer bed than a regular quad cab f150, and the front isn’t much shorter than an f150."
I think you mean 80’s. 60’s was all about streamlining
So do tumors.
Maybe the assets were already on the site pre-reveal and they needed to hide it so it wouldn't get sniffed out early.
500mi isn't enough range?
"I could totally see them making options that allow you to tow a gooseneck.

500 miles is a lack of range for you?"
It does. Your opinion will decide where the future designs will be headed. The future of cars is electric and Tesla's first  attempts to such unconventional designs will play a major role in the coming years with the inclusion of public perception. (Unless you happen to be a boomer)
Except they have it for sell on their website. So people who do pre-order it are expecting this version.

"The rivian looks way better

And the bollinger looks even better than that"
"It's obviously designed to be a work truck. Have you ever seen a construction work vehicle? they're dented to hell. 
Everyone hating on this design seemed to be expecting something they could flaunt but it seems like Tesla was more focused on performance"
The being armoured is probably just a side effect of using stainless steel and not a real design consideration. I THINK!
I dont think tesla ever focus group their products

Nani?! Kansei Durifto?!
I thought you could get the 3 motor awd?
?
"yea AWD and 4WD drive is different (4WD drive is better) but maybe you didn't see there is a triple motor being offered which is going to give you about the same thing. Not to mention electric traction control is superior, so it's less of an issue.

Edit: I actually did some research on this. We're all misunderstanding Tesla's all wheel drive. A coworker of mine had me second guessing myself as well but anyway, you might be confusing Tesla's all wheel drive with FULL TIME ALL WHEEL DRIVE from gas cars. Teslas use two motors to achieve all wheel drive, each motor is independently controlled , full time AWD is all wheels moving forward all the time which doesn't help with traction as much as 4WD and Teslas dual motor AWD. Tesla's system will send different amounts of power to whichever motor is best at the moment and will use both as needed for speed and traction."
"Now days it's more of a marketing term then anything. But you're also trying to apply it to a totally different technology. In an ICE car you're talking about what type of center differential the vehicle uses. But the Tesla is going to have a motor at each axle, so it doesn't really apply here."
What makes you think that? This fits with everything he has been saying about it for years including that he doesn’t care if people hate it
It’s not buddy

"It would depend heavily on the shape of the trailer, an enclosed V-nose trailer that's not much taller than the pickup would probably be around 250 miles. But an flatbed trailer with something not very aerodynamic on it would probably hurt the range more. My V-nose enclosed 26' trailer dings me about 35% on my mpg compared to unloaded with no trailer."
Well the one with a towing capacity of 14k lbs is the $70k with plaid powertrain that they say will get over 500 miles. So with a 14k lb trailer probably 250 miles?
"none. It has a 7500+ lbs limit.

edit: nevermind. that 7500lbs is for one electric motor."
They said 3500lbs which is actually pretty impressive.

"That was part of the presentation, they lowered the rear air suspension for easy loading. Also the atv is electric and is charging in the back."
Self leveling rear assists unload and loading of atv
It has adjustable air suspension so it can raise and lower the body when needed.  In that case it lowered to make going up the ramp with the atv easier.
"> I was bummed that the tailgate and ramp weren’t powered though. The opening and ramp deployment looked really clunky relative to the rest of the aesthetic and features.  

They built this thing over the past couple weeks. They have at least a year to finish the actual design."
"This is the presskit shot they have of the ramp: https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cybertruck-website-Tesla-ATV-ramp-1.jpg

If that's what they're aiming for, then I think the ramp's gonna be a way bigger feature than the way it looked on stage. *That* photo shows what looks like a walk-on ramp if the rear suspension is capable of lowering that much."

It will be but put some side rail steps on and all is good.. Same problem the avalanches had.  Hell any 4x4 truck is up there anyways. This thing is ugly as hell and I love it.

Yeah that ain’t it chief. Electric will never get military use because of the total reliance on a stable power grid.
"Yep! Police are going to jump for this vehicle.  And with mods, it could be a good military escort option.  Imagine if they convert the bed enclosure to solar panels.  It could be left in the desert for days and slowly charge."
There is no way this isnt a troll (I hope). $5 they let the media talk about it for a couple weeks and drop lics of the actual design.
You’re on your own boomer
You better cash that short tomorrow. The future won’t give you another opportunity.
Which is cool
"that's the idea

retrofuturism"
Tesla could pay me a $100 deposit and I wouldn't order it. I can't believe I was excited for this.
"For 70k you can buy a brand new 3500 diesel with 30,000 pounds of towing capacity and a bed that can actually be used. 

The lowest end one is 20k more than a brand new 1500 with about 3-5k less towing capacity. Most travel trailers these days are going to push 7500 lbs loaded weight, right at the edge of what this monstrosity is capable of. 

The self-driving aspect is what I'm really looking for, but that's an additional 7k on top of the price. 

I like the direction this is headed, but I'll pass until the design is radically altered"
"What’s the gimmick? He said he was making a pickup, that looks like it checks all the boxes"
It's the most powerful truck ever... And you call it a gimmick...
"What part of it felt like a gimmick other than not liking the design? Genuinely curious what you thought. Other than the glass breaking, the functionality aspects of it seemed quite solid to me."
It comes with full autopilot.... and it does have a crumplezone. What are you talking about dude?
The clay model had the autopilot cameras in the windshield. I’m here.
How do you even know any of that shit?
Comes with Autopilot.

It's got to be a joke
"Do you really, honestly believe this?"
">No, seriously, I am legitimately still thinking that Tesla did this as an actual prank. In no way can they be serious about this being a viable option for ANY REPLACEMENT of ICE trucks. I can’t use this truck for anything other that the ‘cool’ factor, which I can’t even do anyways because it isn’t cool. It’s cyber, sure...it looks like it belongs in a video game. Cyberpunk.

I so want you to be right."
Who are you calling boomer?  Elon?  Elon was born in 1971.  He’s gen X
Model 3's don't come with bullitproof glass.
You're retarded lol
You're worried about the future of a company because of a prototype car? You realize they can easily judge demand by pre-orders and tweak as needed. What a weird outlook.
Is this not a place for discussion?
Bullshit.  Negative opinions are just as valid as adoring ones.
It’s pathetic if people don’t like it?
it isn't incredibly functional though from what we've seen.  I'm not going to struggle with a manual  stainless steel liftgate made even heavier by a stowed ramp.  Door handles recessed??  That's going to be hella fun when the door is covered in mud and god knows what else and the handles get clogged and won't present. That front windshield...how difficult is that going to be to clear with a wiper since it's flat enough that water and debris aren't going to slough off as fast?  I have soooo many questions about the interior and it's features that those of us who use their trucks for recreation or work need to be answered.
"Why would people not post their opinions? I love Tesla and was cringing so hard about the truck BEFORE they broke the damn window. 

I don’t understand what just happened or how it was allowed to happen."
"What it was literally a event to say look at the truck and tell us what you think. My has a Model 3 and wants a truck but not this one. I love it, but I am normally not a truck fan. To expensive to run for the few times I need that capability. I think this truck will appeal to practical people, but there is Rivian for the rest."
"As a model S owner and stock holder, I’m going to complain. The stock is going to tank tomorrow. This was a completely unnecessary self inflicted wound that Tesla can not afford. There are already too many haters out there. This is not good."
"Fine with how heavy they are, that's what people do now, throw a few sandbags in the back"
Like shit.
They are from Tesla's website
Where are the wipers?
They're on the Tesla website
You think so? I think it's ugly

"keep telling yourself that lol. Might have very minor tweaks, but this thing is already up for pre-order. You really think they’re gonna say “sorry, we know you liked that car you ordered, but we completely redesigned it”"
Presale is already available... They wouldn't do presale unless the design would stay the same...... right?
"YOU BETTER BE RIGHT, DUDE"
You are so naive but its okay man
"Hopefully they can add to this design, I love it. But only majority of us will like it"
Not sure if trolling...
"There's also a non-zero possibility he *isn't* joking. Everyone insisted Starhopper was a water tower, until they installed an engine."
"Okay, assume you’re right, he’s risking public confidence in the long term direction of Tesla for what, a meme?  And then dividing the folks who are loyal to Tesla, for what?  He probably has 24 hours at most to say it was a joke. 

Other possibility is that it’s Elon who wanted this and the board somehow figured if he showed people and they disagreed, it could force him to revisit the design.

Keep in mind, Model 3 didn’t dramatically change from concept to production..."
"Good point, totally could be a test of this design to get feedback and maybe even let some fanboys get this design while working on a more “normal” design."
[deleted]
It's a completely different type of car and can't possibly have been designed since the Mach-E was unveiled
What? This as literally nothing to do with ford mach e.
That doesn't even make sense. Your logic would make it seem like they buckled this thing together within the last few weeks given the Mach E's release date. They've been working on this for a while.

"Every other EV truck looks like it was designed by a kid for some reason. this one looks like it was designed by an edge lord 12 year old.

Probably not. Insurance companies are trash in knowing the difference. I just got quoted 7k in Miami.
100% disagree. Love the single central screen.
No instrument cluster and the simple interior overall are some of my favorite aspects of the model 3.
"The only reason I'd want a cluster is to have more real estate on the center screen, otherwise it's a non-issue for me."
Half life alyx looks amazing. But yes the truck is ugly as fuck.
"What's so bad about trying something new? You still have every other generic way to play a game available to you, you still have every other generic vehicle to buy... what is so wrong about trying something ""soooo crazy"" different? This is how we evolve into the next great thing. You should hope Alyx does well and the VR tech evolves into some amazing way of entertainment, just like this vehicle might make other manufacturers try something new leading to the next amazing vehicle trend or whatever."
"It seats six as well. If you have four kids this is a lot cheaper way to get them around than a model X. 

I'll take this over a minivan any fucking day."
"So true. The 1998 Toyota Corolla was clearly the best design, and all cars should look like that. While we're at it, what's up with all the car colors? Black and white are all that's necessary."
Rich?? Its 40k.
I am guessing this is a design that prioritizes functionality over aesthetics and it is pretty common that first iterations of certain technologies don't look their best. It will probably improve a lot on aesthetics over the next generations while also being equally or more functional.
Art is subjective. Ugly is an opinion. Why post if you're just complaining and stereotyping people who might buy this or are interested in it?
Sounds like you can’t afford it ahah

Impractical how?
"I don't use trucks, so i genuinely have no idea. What makes it impractical?"
Why it is  impractical? 110v/240v outlet to plug in your tool. It tows 7500 pounds at the minimum. The trunk is fully opened and closed. And it costs $40000. Good luck buying anything as strong as this one for that amount of money.
It looks practical es hell. Also ugly as hell..
"Lol weak faith, plus he said it'd be wierd"
Impractical? Lol did you see the specs?
"The rivian truck looks really good, I don’t know why you’re bashing."
"It works to my advantage. By the time I’m ready to buy, my 02’ Tacoma will be ready to call it a day."
All Tesla orders are $100 now.
"Also, must partly be the trouble they had with all that money sitting around last time."
when is it supposed to be delivered?
"Where did you get this info? During the presentation Elon said will have EAP, and higher charge capable than current cars. They also have other stats on the site- why do you say they are simulated?"

Not according to the order page. It lists [right here](https://imgur.com/QgFOGSi) that it has a self-driving option."
Future Walter white will throw a pizza in zero g
Holy shit they're both gray.
He literally said that trucks are the third biggest automobile market in the US and that the transition to renewable energy is not possible without an electric truck
"""a $40,000 pickup truck isn't supposed to be mass market"" what a braindead comment. If this is actually it, and not some elaborate prank by Elon. This is the dumbest idea they've ever had"
"God I hope so. I can see this being a work truck of sort. If I were in the market for a truck I couldn't pull the trigger for this, though the pricing is pretty good. The design is just so jarring from anything else they've produced, including the Semi."
Then why the fuck make a pick up truck at all? Are you nuts?
Isn't that exactly the OPPOSITE of what Elon said at the beginning. he even put up the 1.5mil+ production numbers of the big three this year. Seems like a swing and a miss to me.
"Yes it is.

Correction: was."
"He literally talked about how the most popular cars in the US are trucks and they wanna enter that segment of the market, what the fuck do you think this is supposed to be"
Then what’s up with his initial statement about needing to make one to save the earth?
The Semi looked more like a Tesla.  This doesn't look like a Tesla.
The bed cover retracts into the body. In the live stream they showed the bed cover retracting and then drove an ATV onto the bed.
"I'm the back, under the cover."
"Take a look at these pics
https://twitter.com/Qrypton/status/1197749327411761152?s=09"
"At 6.5' it's actually pretty average. I imagine with the tailgate down it's 8'. I'm more concerned about accessibility from the sides, although the Ridgeline-esque trunk in the bed alleviates a little bit of that concern."
Retractable bed cover.. but it looks tiny. Like Honda Ridgeline tiny.
That's how he is on all his presentations.
"Chill my dude. Elon has public speaking issues, many people do. With the design, he said it would be polarizing, you have an opinion of it being ugly, I on the other hand am open to the design & the fact that they tried something out of the ordinary and risky."
More nervous/tired than usual. One of the IAC spacex presentations was particularly bad.
"Have you ever heard him speak in public before?  He's always like this.  Horrible public speaker.  I think he got flustered after the window incident too.

Awesome truck otherwise."
So normal Elon presentation then?

he's just not a good public speaker

"Pretty sure they can't sell it like that - has to be a round steering wheel (I totally could be wrong, just repeating what I think I remember from the Roadster 2 reveal), but they do stuff like this for concept cars and whatnot."
What are you referencing? Can you share a photo or something? Didn’t see any of the interior
"My thought exactly lol, a delorean wagon."
Lol wut
Financial troubles? Are you high?
Yah like damn they really hit the crack pipe on this one. A bit sad:/
"It's a prototype. They can pretty easily judge by pre-orders whether they should make it. And they just turned a profit, opened a new factory and are about to start making a small SUV. Don't think there's any coffins in their future."
"yeah this isn't why you aren't a designer. Forgetful design, no one will remember that truck if it looked that way."
"Lol your render looks like the a steroided tundra, which is the direction all truck makers are going.

Tesla went the opposite direction, and I think it was the right decision."
The front end of that is way too fat. Cut the “mouth” in half and we’re getting better.
"I think this Cybrtrk design is a real game changer for the designs of trucks. It really does go where no manufacturers want to go, that is, to the really cutting edge of design. It’s not for everyone as it is just TOO futuristic for most, but I suspect the world may actually catch up later."
The blue one just looks like the sort of concepts Nissan releases and never makes.
That report card is why teachers think they should get paid more but dont
I actually really liked this design. Wish it was more like this
Conspiracies will rot your brain 🤪😁 doesn’t make sense to me but props for thinking such a conspiracy up.

"I mean, early 2022 is as little as 2 years and 2 months away."
Every single 2wd truck on the market is rear wheel drive.
"God I hope this was sarcastic

I hope you are not serious

What do you want? 4 wheel drive on the highway? Why?

Or you want a FWD pick up truck?

What are you after exactly?"
City folk
Who would want a FWD pickup?
"In the flatter parts of the USA, RWD trucks sell fairly well."
"Just like a tacoma, where's the issue?"
is that not because normally you wouldn't have enough weight over it? because a BEV will have much more even weight distribution.
"Tesla controls 80% of the US EV market. Ford controls... 0%? 1%? Not sure why people discount this. Tesla knows EVs, Ford knows gas vehicles. Ford can learn, but it will take time. There's a reason Ford's stock has performed abysmally for many years.   

Also, Tesla isn't attempting to conquer the pickup market here. The goal is to steal some market share and push everyone else to make EV trucks."
"Ford still has a long way to go in terms of electric cars. They will only be producing 50,000 Mach-Es during its first year of production."
"This is the biggest boomer argument I’ve ever heard.  “Nobody will even beat Ford because right now Ford is number 1”.  Things change, market leaders fall, new market trends prevail.  Tesla has beaten all the odds so far."
[deleted]
I'm super pumped to see the Ford Bronco and am a big Ford fan.  But if Tesla starts hitting milestones like new battery tech and more production in only a few years time then looking at the cost of say a well optioned Bronco/F150 versus what this truck may turn out why would I want Ford?
"And brand loyalty on top of that.  This is realistically Tesla's first attempt at selling to people who consider themselves ""truck guys"".

EDIT (copied from a response below): I don't think the folks here are at all cognizant of what most of rural America looks like. I come from a town that has 1 Ford dealership, 1 Chevy dealership, and no charging infrastructure. They adore Ford as if it were an NFL team."
This seems highly false
This just isn't true lol
"I drive my truck every day and i can't wait to sell it for full electric, i think you underestimate how many truck drivers hate gas"
You really believe all the trucks you see on the road when you go out just happen to be that 1 or 2 days a year they’re using them? Someone pays 40k+ for something they use 1-2x a year.. i hope you’re kidding
It's too damn early for these tough questions. Save them for after we're home from work tonight.
Holy fucking city dweller
"The people who religiously buy trucks drive trucks daily, regardless of weather or if it's even convenient to bring your truck. If you live in a city, you probably don't see many trucks, and the trucks you see are probably driven by people from suburbs moving something. So in conclusion, while you are wrong, it is a forgivable error."
"Most people buy a truck and use it regularly, a lot may only have a few days a year where they are doing something they couldn’t do with a regular car. But to pretend they sit parked all but one or two days a year is laughable."

 Where?
Probably drop a heavy amount
Dooown...
Late 2021/2022 depending on the model
"This is what the website shows:

>	You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in late 2021. Tri Motor AWD production is expected to begin in late 2022."
Late 2021 / 2022. Or in other words...never.
The low poly count version.
how the fuck are they similar? the gt is amazing and then we have that shit box
Maybe try clicking the link next time lol
The reason its shaped like that is the back glass slides into the frame and reveals the bed. Its fucking sick.
Dude its called adaptive air suspension. They lowered it and then raised it.
That was on purpose
That was the point...did you not listen? Dynamic air suspension raises the front and lowers the back. Do you have shit for brains?
"Did you even watch the stream? It lowered the tail end on the air suspension to facilitate loading, then once the tailgate was closed it reset itself to ""cruise"". Adaptive suspension yo."
"That was intentional, you'll hear Elon say ""the truck is raising the front and lowering the back to make it easier to load the four wheeler"" This was probably necessary to get the short tailgate ramp to reach the ground at a decent angle. Then it leveled itself after he closed the gate."
It did on purpose...
"He said it was using a ""loading mode"" you can see it level back out a little later. Even for Elon, he was horrible during this presentation."
"Funny that the truck's rear dropped 8-12 inches *before* they put the ATV in back. Kinda makes you think that the weight of the ATV had nothing to do with it, huh?"
It sank in the back. Rams do this as well with the coil suspension. Hence the airbags available on rams.
"The truck does that automatically when you open the tailgate, in order to make the bed more accessible."
ok....
"I’m confused, I’m on reddit, love the truck, voted republican, and work in mechanical design in the automotive industry. Don’t peg everyone the same"

"Or just the electric Ford F-150 we were expecting....

I have no idea why people like Rivian, at all. Nice battery capacity, but anyone could do that. it's a truck with a large battery."
I for one am glad that Elon didn't go with a shitty rehashed Ford that brings no real change to the world. The Cybertruck is far better than that shit.
/u/110110 would be so proud.
No.
"Most ATVs are around 48"" wide and they rode that thing right up in there.  It could be a custom narrow width though."
"According to the Motor Trend article linked elsewhere in this thread, it's a 57"" wide bed, 6.5' long."
The show models rarely have them. Elon has mentioned previously they're only included in final production because it's law. Otherwise they're quite a bit more efficient and aesthetically pleasing without.
6 and a half feet is what was said. It fits their quad with the tailgate closed.
"The Motor Trend article linked elsewhere in this thread mentions the bed width as 57"". The video showed a 6.5' length. Didn't see anything about bed-to-top-of-tailgate height."
"It looks like the tailgate height is actually lower than a modern f-150 bed. I'd guess the tailgate to ground distance was like 28-29"" since it slopes down a bit, and the bed height like 30-31"" . modern trucks at like 36"" are a few inches too high IMO."
Yes please. I’ve emailed and tweeted every other company and no one replies.
"In case you haven't seen yet;

"With 16"" of ground clearance they should just give you a piperack under the truck. If that's the final pitch of the roof it'd be tough to give you a roof rack."
The presentation video shows the bed having a built in 'roll top door' type of cover that slides on a track up the back slope then down below the rear window.
Built in
*tater tots
I'm sure I have heard that it'll be 220V to suit a welder
"They will sell versions with heated steering wheels, but the catch is that you have to drive down south to pick them up. And then live there."
This. Open that charge port door even if you get ejected for it. Take pictures.
You too! Hit me up when youre in town.
almost certainly not.
"Why didn't it break on the glass that wasn't attached to the truck? God I'm so fucking happy I don't work for Elon right now, I feel so bad for everyone involved"
Bulletproof
It’s exactly how you properly break a window. They should have thrown something more blunt.

Looks like marble.
You gonna do your cyber coke off of real granite?
ahahaha. Elon needs to lay off the weed
Nah my dude that shit is MDF with quartz veneer
It’s compressed paper apparently
More like faux marble.
Marble my man
"Horizontal screens are superior regardless.  Signed, 3 months in an S and 15 months in a 3"
I believe that is marble. Which may be worse or better for head depending on the impact 😂
Looks like marble to me
Do you people not wear seatbelts?
"It's paper i think, at least on the test drives."
Lol there's 0% chance it's a dangerously hard material.
Every concept has the same futuristic/minimalistic steering wheel. The X and 3 did and it never made it to production. We’ll see though but I doubt it.
"Not to mention this thing isn't even entering production until ***LATE 2021***. Insane lead time to announce this, lol"
It’s a little *too* geometric for me. And I’d hate to fly into that granite dash.
"Cup holder!! Have you ever seen work trucks, filled with big drinks"
Looks awesome and fits with the angular exterior
Looks like a tank. Freaking amazing.
That's a matter of opinion. I'm almost foaming at the mouth for this thing.
"All the concepts have cool steering wheels like this, the 3 did too pretty sure. They almost never make it to production"
That steering wheel looks horrible and unusable.
"I'm all for that wheel in a sports car like the 3, but a truck that needs worksite maneuverability... single-handed use is key, and that's not gonna fly."
"Exactly. If you want to appeal to people that will use this as a truck on a job site or something, you don't put everything on a giant screen. Work trucks are dirty typically. No construction worker wants to use his dirty ass fingers to turn his windshield wipers on. I'm not sure who they're trying to appeal to with this truck honestly."
"There's a middle seat in the front row! Now, where would the front airbag for this passenger be...?"
The point of using a truck as... A truck... Means you'll occasionally have the rear view blocked. But Tesla's got cameras out the bootybutt.
the same as other trucks with stuff in the back? or cameras lol
I mean they demonstrated six adults getting out of the cybertruck at the beginning of the presentation...
"Agreed, compared to a Supercrew cab, this is tiny.  There is a reason most manufacturers went to a 5.5ft. bed with the larger cab. That extra foot matters (yes I know you can get the longer bed with a longer frame."
"Elon said he was almost killed on a motorcycle. So he doesn't like them :/

Still crossing fingers for a decent dual sport electric. Zero is close!"
Harley has an Electric bike. The livewire . It's freaking expensive though.
Yeah when do we find out the ATVs capabilities? I want hard numbers because I have range anxiety with quadding.
"It actually looks normal, unlike that personnel carrier of a truck"
At least one order of magnitude off
Elon famously hates/distrusts LIDAR systems for autonomous driving.
One of the design inspirations was a stealth jet.
Will kill them. Things a tank.
I didn’t mention reflecting at all kind internet person.
Bro I’m dead they broke both windows 😂
You were the chosen one!
Or was it? :)
Where do I watch this?
"More likely nobody tested it on the prototype or using the same shape of glass. 
    
You would think a bunch of engineers would know that different pressure points can change the durability as opposed to testing on a square piece of unsecured glass."
"Forget about replacing the glass, They should replace the whole truck design."
My guess is that they tested it so much that some micro cracks appeared or something and the window got weak enough to be broken by their ball
"This was intended for sure, looks really bad-ass with the windows shattered. Also a lot of free marketing since the ""issue"" got in the news all over the world."
"Don't worry, I'm sure after this disastrous demo, Elon will make sure the glass is next to impossible to break on the real thing."
"I don't think the guy throwing the metal ball was just ""stage crew"". I thought I saw somewhere that he was a member of the design team, possibly a lead?"
Yeah [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udxR5rBq_Vg)
ie 2023
And still more impressive than any other pickup-truck set for 2022.
Sure.
Worth the wait.
Production begins then. So we might not see them on road until 2023 but that’s a lot of time for developments and improvements if they decide to

2035?
"$70k is the Rivian’s starting price.  You get everything from Tesla, save FSD, for that price."
I must be the only person that likes the design of the CT over the Rivian
When is it going to release? A product you can actually buy is preferable to a product you can't buy.
I like the cyberpunk look of the tesla....call me weird
Price?
"The Rivian with those specs will likely cost FAR more than $70,000 though."
They already are. Site went down. Tons of posts on Twitter of Pre-Order Confirmation screens
Can't the Model X do 5000lbs towing?
They don’t specify time or range. My bet is that the limitation is the ability to cool the batteries.
"Believe me, I’m 100% buying this, but it’s definitely not for the mainstream truck market.

I hope it does better than my cynicism is telling me it will."
"I accept that it is a bit ugly, but I like it.  I reserved one: 2-motor AWD w/ self drive.  When I bought our Camry a couple of years ago, I planned even then that this would be my last gas car, and I've stopped myself a few times from buying a truck, waiting for this."
"Stainless is a terrible material for a truck, or any car for that matter. Look at what happened to delorean.

Carbon Composite would have been lighter, stronger, able to have minor dents repaired, and better in every conceivable way. Including cost, with modern techniques."
Don't underestimate the value of not offending the average consumer's aesthetic sensibilities.
I wouldn't say driving a triangle is a advantage
"> Those CEO's probably shit themselves because their vehicles have exactly 0 advantages over the Cybertruck

They don't look like shit, for starters."
"We'll, they do exist today.  I'd say that counts for *something*."
Expect the fact that the no truck owners will switch to this vehicle which should’ve released in the year 2050.
"External looks, internal looks, being able to load it from the side, towing capacity, range you can drive it in a day, pretty much anything truck related this falls short.  It is fast tho.  But I'm not exactly in the truck market and looking at the 0-60.  If 0-60 was a concern the 7.3 would never sell.

My last camping trip was 300 miles one way while towing 8000 lbs of horses and gear.  Can even the highest model do that?  This is simply not a truck for truck people from what I can tell.

I guarantee you those CEOs are happy as hell.  Go peep in any actual truck forum, not a tesla one, and see what the reaction is from people who own trucks."

"It was definitely Elon, unless the thrower was doing a ventriloquist-style impression of Elon Musk."
Or if they ever sledgehammered the doors then immediately after threw giant steel balls at the windows.
"That was not a sledgehammer, it was a dead blow hammer. Another fail in this terrible presentation. 

A dead blow hammer is a specialized mallet helpful in minimizing damage to the struck surface and in limiting peak striking force, with minimal elastic rebound from the struck surface. The minimal rebound is helpful in avoiding accidental damage to precision work, especially in tight locations and in applications such as maintenance work on hydraulic cylinders."
it was handed to Franz by the guy near the glass sheet they'd just dropped it on. So might be that guy who made the error.
Also dude didn't even hit the Cyber truck door as hard as he hit the F-150s door.
Doubt it. The Model Y event was equally awful. They need to let someone else do the talking. Elon is just simply bad at it
they were planning on smash-testing the rest of the truck for another hour but decided that might be a bad look
Starship style
In a cave with a box of scraps.
Bends and corners increase strength. Flats are weaker.
s/stronger/cheaper
Wouldn't he just... Not make it in that case?
"That and if you watch carefully, when Franz gave it the sledge hammer love tap, the top door panel popped in then back out."
It could have been worse: they could have actually done the gunshot demo and had the bullet ricochet.
"I think seriously injuring an audience member is by far a worse outcome.

This they can play off as a glitch or ""hey we improved the glass more"".  Smashing in someone's face is not good publicity"
It's really a metaphor for poor Elon. The hype and BS bites him in the ass every now and then.
">That's all everyone will be talking about tomorrow.

Now you got me thinking maybe they planned this all along. Think about how much (nearly free) publicity they got with everyone and their grandma talking about this. The glass breaking is almost certainly a net positive for Tesla."
">Oh gee I sure would love this car, but are the windows bulletproof?? Because otherwise this is DOA

- No civilian ever"
"Could have also been Elon, the dude's not perfect"
Someone in the team also might have said to Elon that it’s a bad idea to throw ball at the window. Elon would have ignored it or argued against it as is his style.
And he totally deserves it. Like WTF did they think would happen? Either the heavy steel ball messes up your truck or it bounces back into Franz or someone in the crowd. They clearly did not rehearse that part at all. We can tell because they were nice enough to try a 2nd time just to show us the 1st throw wasn't a fluke lol
"It was installed, otherwise the ball would've gone barreling through it. I think the glass was never thoroughly tested after being installed on a physical truck. I'm sure the results looked great in a laboratory setting though."
I bet franz grabbed the wrong weight ball from the drop demo. They tested two weights in the steel balls.
You can have it in any color you want as long as it's grey steel.
Keys are mad delicate at certain angles
Throw sth at the windows then.
Elon often responds to crowd riffs. I think some douchebags figured that out a while back and now they holler random crap nonstop.
It's bc Tesla has some of the most excited crowds for a company.
Ok I’ll be honest I did woo once cause when Cap picked up that hammer I got super hype
"The last marvel movie I went to go see in theaters, I walked out before it started because people were already being insufferable. Got a refund. That was for the second avengers movie, age of Voltron or something like that..."
"Elon:

“Love you too. Heh.”"
Elon is Elon. Joe Rogan’s podcast. Every Tesla webcast. It’s just his style.
"All live presentations do. Broadcast events would get super weird for home-viewers and the media if crowd reactions were muffled in the background while the person onstage waits for applause to die down. 

See also: when people online mute the laugh-track to sitcoms and say “see?! It’s soooo awkward”"
"Lol, you guys didn’t get it. Someone in the audience screamed that out loud."
Tesla stock fire sale!
It’s down ~6% at open
Down 6% today. Makes total sense
Those people won’t be watching or will watch the presentation.
"Idk, it's kinda growing on me. It looks better when actually on the street I feel."
That's...... A really interesting theory
It’s so annoying
"That’s what it looks like. I would think there are going to be a lot of additional changes to the interior based on feedback. They already have to respond or reengineer based on the glass break demo, I don’t see why they wouldn’t take the opportunity to do more adjustments to what I believe will address the mediocre(?) reaction to the unveil.

The timeline is surprising, I mean- these things take time to make, I would think they had a clay prototype way back before they did their first teaser tweet of the mysterious swoopy front."
"Imaging this thing coming at you or behind.. pretty menacing to see what looks like an armored silver brick.

The looks is not bad I'd say just very different.."
"I think the design is bold, price point is right, but honestly, I prefer the Rivian [if I had the budget for even buying a new car at this point]."
"Yeah I was expecting them to show some videos of the truck doing trucker things like off-roading capabilities, driving up an incline, show how the tri-motor would work, and towing a trailer. You know some actual real-world stuff and they only showed mostly endurance."
"I get blasted in this forum anytime I say this, but Tesla needs to strip back and focus on the fundamentals that the majority of the market cares about. Range, performance and ease/speed of recharging. Do what Ford did to you - just carbon copy a Ford 150 but shove a Tesla drivetrain and battery in there and you will sell millions of them, and change the world. We don't need all the other crap now. Self driving, bulletproofing, wonder glass - it doesn't add any value yet drives up the price. Get back to basics."
"Well, Elon is from South Africa..."
"*doesn't exist yet

A real Gavin Belson moment.
I couldn't stop cringing after the window fail(s). It sucked the air out of the room.
"It was so early on in the presentation too. It just sucked because you literally go through all the selling points and all anyone can focus on (including the crowd, including the media, including Elon, including you & I) is that the car model we’re all spectating that this whole event is about has two smashed windows. Poor Elon, honestly his recovery in the moment was spectacular (having a sense of humor, giving background on their testing with an actual kitchen sink, etc.) but there’s not much you do when something like that goes so awry at such a momentous event."
How? He made jokes about it and took it in stride. Obviously it's awkward but he handled it as best as anyone could expect
Why wouldn't they film it and show the video. You don't test this kind of shit during the live event. The risk to reward ratio is way too high.
I'm guessing they did. Tech demos failing on stage in many industries has a very rich history of happening. It's almost to the point it's surprising when they don't fail on stage.
Well if they had the glass might've broken!
Because Elon rushes his teams and out comes half baked stuff
"Lucky they didn't otherwise they would have had to bring to market ""invisi-glass""."
Rewatch it here https://youtu.be/SwvDOdBHYBw
Never though of him as a  showman. He's an engineer that has to periodically be a showman. He's never been flawless at presenting things it always a bit awkward which as an engineer is understandable.  Always though he should bring somebody in to do announcement then come in for q&a but I understand he is the guy we want to see.
Most awkward showman ever
"He was stumbling a bit at the beginning, having trouble putting his thoughts into words, but once the glass broke, so did he."
I kind of like that about him. I liked the fucked up presentation.
So unpopular that everyone else here is saying the same thing.
Too soon
Call Katy Perry
Honest to god he should include one and affix it somewhere in the cabin.
The metal ball is included in the center console.
"Well this experiment can effect on the next Tesla.. if it does good I can see a similar style car.. manufacturing flat panels is much easier than curvy while base stays the same.

A similar style ""budget"" version like model 3 can probably cost lot less than model 3."
Your comment for sure is.
Yup. Elon has to go home and cry.
Yep. The worst part about it is that the broken glass debacle wasn't even the worst part about it.
UI is likely specifically made for this prototype. I doubt it will see the light of day in it's present form.
Good question!
"""is that the production steering wheel?"" 

Yeah buddy we actually have the whole steering wheel manufacturing area up and running already turning out units, we're holding off with every other part of the car until next year tho."
"Or worse, hit someone in the crowd. Jesus what a clusterfuck of cringe"
"I was worried about the front row as well.  I panicked for a second when I remembered this is live.  

Musk has poor impulse control, but I suppose that’s part of what makes his companies produce such off-the-wall shit."
You and me. That was one crazy idea to double down.
That’s what i was thinking. It was a no win situation. Surely they didn’t expect the glass to break though. It was just a bad idea in general.
Yes it would've. But that's why nobody throws steel balls at a F150 window during the presentation. It was way too risky for Tesla to try this on stage. Turned the show into a joke.
Automotive glass is designed to shatter in tiny pieces so it doesn't hurt you. The F150 glass would be significantly more safe in comparison. There's no way this is real.
"Also difference between crawling out of a jammed/broken door and being stuck inside possibly to catch on fire...

Why is unbreakable side glass a good thing? Windows are common emergency exits. They are supposed to be breakable."
"Keep in mind that Elon muttered “oh my fucking god” after the window broke.

This was not planned. Nor was the glass supposed to break."
"The worst part is that had they not bragged how incredibly strong the windows were, NO ONE WOULD HAVE CARED. No one would have criticized Tesla for building a truck with breakable windows, but they had to go and act like they’d invented a miracle material."
It's prolly stainless steel too
"I agree, but it might be too steep for most things."
"*gate falls off*

“Ohmyfuggingawd”"
there are rehosts of the livestream on youtube
He said it would look like a futuristic armored vehicle. Mission accomplished.
"I suspect he didn't show the interior or bed because they are incomplete. That thing looked like a rushed prototype. 

And it's maybe the most douchebag car since the Hummer."
Hopefully that meltdown extends to the 'truck'.
">  I think the truck will grow on people as it's about practicality. 

All I can think about is how practical it's going to be for a soccer mom high on opioids to door ding my regular vehicle with that 30x rolled steel road-tank."
"This is correct. The glass panels could release a lot of energy by shaking like that, but mounted to a physical truck, they don't have as much wiggle room, so they break."
I did see that but I don't want to post as anything about it since we are not 100% sure about this. If you do find proof please let me know.
In character? Would have been cringe. The opening with the cybergirl was cringe enough.

"Oh yeah you are right, the price of the Rivian is in a different league to the cybrtruck so that is a big factor. If you compare just these two trucks, then the Rivian seems overpriced. If you compare the Rivian to high end SUVs, then it seems like a bit of a bargain again. I guess it´s all a matter of perspective."
"> Rivian looks like some type of Range Rover with a truck bed and goofy headlights.

Haha that is a perfect description :) And maybe that is why I like it, it doesn´t take many risks, except for the goofy headlights which I am also not a huge fan of. 

Tesla´s design is indeed different, I think we can all agree on that! And it also will get a lot of attention on the road because of that. Who knows, maybe it is one of these designs that´ll grow on me over time."
"Heh, that is certainly true! It will definitely stand out and there is a lot to like about it. 

However, this will not, under no circumstances, sell in big numbers. It is way too extravagant and just plain weird for that. This will not attract F150 buyers, this will attract Tesla buyers. And that sadly is still a very different crowd. 

This was Tesla´s chance to attract a huge untapped market to their brand, and I personally think that they have failed to do that because they wanted to make it extra crazy.

That was totally not necessary. A beefed up Model S design with some offroad elements would have been perfect and would have attracted a much, MUCH wider audience. 

But who knows, maybe I am completely wrong on this and we will see these everywhere in a couple of years. I highly doubt it though."
"There's a reason all cars look the same and that's because of regulations. Unfortunate Elon knows how to trick consumers into believing misleading marketing numbers. 

Plus all the specs are all speculations they haven't been released yet. When is the Model Y supposed to come out?"
"Definitely not! 

Nissan Truck: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/53/30/a3/5330a3815b9d454c00bf9e05ce7c1c82.jpg

Rivian: https://cdn.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Rivian-R1T.jpg

Two very different designs. Completely fair to not like it of course, but saying it´s just a Nissan design is simplifying the matter. Also I wouldn´t underestimate Rivian, there is a market for an electric truck and Tesla´s design rules out a wider acceptance. Rivian just might reap the rewards here."
"Good point, and I agree. This design idea should have been scrapped right at the start after everyone had a good laugh at the thought of releasing something like this. I’m a car guy, I really like Tesla, but this thing is just not the right way to go.

It will find it’s very, very niche market of Tesla fans, but I would be surprised if sales go into 5 figures overall. Hell, maybe selling just a 1000 of these is a stretch.

Or maybe I am completely wrong and this will attract people who usually don’t like Teslas. I guess time will tell, until then I’ll keep wondering what the fuck they were thinking"
"I can see that! Maybe you’re right, maybe the key is to not look at this as a pickup truck and compare it to that. Maybe its appeal will be that is so off the beaten path. It certainly has a healthy cool factor! But it’s dancing on that line between cool and plain hideous and I am still not sure where it falls for me."
They'll fix it in post.
Just like in every other car?
Because they barely threw it.
"Yeah but most other trucks have the advantage of not looking like absolute ass. If you're going to make a truck that looks like it was drawn by a 3rd grade methhead, at least make sure you don't further embarrass yourself when presenting the damned thing."
was supposed to not beak but cracked. but not shattered.
They did a drop test with metal balls on test pieces of glass and they all survived but then a guy threw a metal ball at the windows and they broke. Elon said OMFG on the livestream when it happened.
https://twitter.com/Pyrets1/status/1197734066683908097
Hahaha yeah I think I prefer a few of them to what we saw
Need more concepts
Hell naw. This is way better
Now that I’ve seen the real thing... more concepts don’t seem so bad anymore.
"I'll take a few of those concepts, please."
"So, wanna change your answer?"
Can they bear the real thing...?
i tried but they locked the sub!

That’s why every cybertruck will come with a metal ball and a clone of Frans to throw it at the window for you

"Why does a ""Cybertruck"" presentation need to feel ""human""? It's just awkward and detracts from the information being presented."
He needs coaching and sleep.
"> thats a very boomer mentality

Oh, shut up."
"I mean breaking the windows doesn't really market it to anyone, whether or not they want a really really unusual truck."
"Who cares if they thought long and hard about it? The presentation was still shit. 

OP isn’t saying don’t be unique and push the cyberpunk mentality, they’re just suggesting “hey, why don’t we practice this presentation once or twice? How about we reduce the chances of embarrassing moments we might have?”"
"> you think they didn't think about this long and hard?

Have you been paying attention to Tesla for long now, or just tuning in? Tesla doesn't think about much for a long period.

>This is intentional.

Breaking the windows and not activating the suspension during its initial demo was intentional? It didn't come across that way. Looked an awful lot like those ball bearing were supposed to bounce off the windows, and the suspension was supposed to drop when he introduced it.

>thats a very boomer mentality.

...yeeeah. cool."
Futuristic is one way to put it I guess...
No u
"The feeling is pretty mutual, I believe"
nope i love this truck
I'm pretty sure it was just to drive the cost of his steel alloy production down.
And there’s no mention of the ATV anywhere now.
"I'll probably buy the ATV separately, the best thing to come out of this presentation."
"When I first saw him present years ago I was confused, then somewhat appreciative, but now I’m annoyed. At the beginning he was rolling out ground breaking products out of nowhere. Tesla is not out of nowhere anymore, he can still be around but they need someone more compelling for these things. Listening to him explain rockets is disastrous lol"
Roll in the not ugly truck!
"I was reading something about the [MAYA](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/design-for-the-future-but-balance-it-with-your-users-present) principle of industrial design which says basically the same thing. People get conditioned to seeing something a certain way and anything that departs from that too far is seen as bad. 

Maybe that is problematic for all those people buying trucks for looks but for folks wanting function over form, this will fit the bill nicely."
Musky Christmas
Looks like marble.
Was wondering the same.  Super weird.
You speak with certainty on a subject that has no confirmation from Tesla.
Exactly what I thought. Maybe there is a „soft“ part between the passenger and the hard shell? Maybe your whole seat + stearing wheel etc will will slide forwards and are attached with a spring?
[deleted]
This is an interesting point. Will this car crumble in a crash?
"Really old NASCAR cars were super rigid. They figured that making it as strong as possible would make it as safe as possible. But when a fast, heavy object suddenly stops, the energy gets transferred to the first thing that gives. And in the case of these NASCAR cars, that happened to be the very soft and squishy driver."
I'm not saying you're wrong but - DeLorean.
"You won't have to worry about being stuck because you'll already be dead. No crumple zones in a stainless steel tank, so your body is the thing absorbing all that energy instead."
Death proof
Exactly. SafeLite can change out a side window same day (sometimes in an hour or two) and do it for like $175. How much more is this kind of glass going to cost?
"Not often, and when I am, they usually aren't use 9mm rounds..."
"I've seen drunk people do it on Cops, rofl."
It's cause your eyes got overloaded on dmt
Rivian looks like the Mona Lisa next to this thing
"I've looked at it from every angle.  One of the ugliest vehicles I've ever seen, of all time, ever.

The rear is just...  I have no words"
They should have thrown the ball through the demo normal truck window first
I was so sad.
"However, it really didn't hurt it either."
"That was hilarious, epic fail."
Literally just heard the guys thinking of buying it say they won't because it would be laughed off site.
"I don't know man, I'm a truck owner with a ram 1500 and the whole point is utility.

The typical truck shape looks good to people because its the typical truck shape, which sort of shows off capability because people know trucks can do shit. 

look at aftermarket bumpers and shit. very angular and build out of thick material for maximal strength, clearance etc. All utility. 

Someone on a jobsite laughing at its crazy angles? while driving a tuck that dents and starts rusting if you look at it wrong? 

It drives me nuts to have to break branches out of the way while driving overgrown forest service roads to save my paintjob and prevent small dents. I accidentally bumped one of those cement blocks with my front bumper while parking at speeds so slow i practically wasnt moving, and it bent my bumper up a few degrees and now its rusting.

Musk has a point with this, its actually tough, not fake tough. throw in those specs and its a weird looking winner that will grow on people."
"Yeah.  Then I start thinking to myself ""but you can do _so_ much with specs like that, and for so little money..."" and then I'm back to wondering if it'll actually find a home in certain unexpected demographics."
"Yep, basically.  Lol"
"After watching the test drive videos, I have to say that it still looks painfully hideous to me.  I've reconciled with the fact that it'll likely always be ugly to me.  So long as this design motif doesn't make its way into the S3XY lineup, though, it doesn't bother me much.  The interior is fine, other than the steering ""wheel"".

Still, I have to shake my head a bit at this.  I worry that Tesla has squandered an irrecoverable opportunity to do to the pickup truck segment what they did to the regular car segment.  I don't think Tesla is going to have much luck convincing people to give up their gas-guzzling traditional pickups by offering such an outrageous, impractical, and, in my opinion, silly design."
It's a Tesla coil... That's the name of the device

"He wasn’t attentive to the fact he was on a live stream. He was also skipping over slides. “Inspiration” — forget it, let’s just get to the dimensions. No demonstration of the active suspension when that was put up on the screen. It’s like he wasn’t prepped on the order of the slides. He needs two prompters at his feet each with “Live slide” and “Next slide.”"

Cyberquad only shows up once but I couldn't find a separate page about it
It was taken from Tesla's site.
Its from Tesla's site.
At least they stopped before breaking the windshield and the rest of the glass on the truck.
This is Elon in every presentation though. It feels like he doesn’t rehearse.
At least the glass didn't shatter like most passenger side windows. None-the-less someones getting fired over that. They should've tested before the event lol
"I beg to differ.  At one point, I thought he might whip out a gun and shoot the door, with the bullet ricocheting into a Elon fan boi."
Windows are made to break so you can get out in case of an emergency.
"Double or nothing. I ain’t some kinda pussy.

The livestream when they vandalized their prototype.
Only when thrown by Franz... let’s just hope he’s not around when this beast comes rolling into town
Thank god I moved away from that pinball factory.
Is this true for the $49k also?
It's a bullshit price like with the $35k model 3. The decent ones with the features you actually want start at $50k
"Well, he still has never swung a sledgehammer because that thing was a dead blow hammer."
"When the presentation started, my wife commented that he seemed even more awkward than usual. It was weird from the start, and I honestly don’t think the glass changed that."
"Well I mean his Starship exploded in Texas yesterday lol, he's not having a good week"
"i mean. its glass. throw a steal ball at glass and what would you expect to happen. didnt you hear elon, ""it didnt go through""


yeah it was funny as heck and bad. but its not that big of a deal relative to the specs and the price and the bad ass atv"
That yes but Elon is legit a bad public speaker.
In 6 months is any of that going to matter?
I thought targeting the toughness of the truck was very smart. This is what truck buyers care about. That's all the marketing is about with trucks.
Even the Semi is pretty.
I don't think that's what car designers had in mind. That was just because glass.
Saves you the trouble of putting a cheap vinyl decal on the piano black!
Unless its headlights fold down to reveal rocket launchers I’m not.
"Lots of trucks and SUVs advertise a fording water height (typically 30” or up to 3ft). I wouldn’t be surprised he advertises this as 100’s or 1000’s of feet based of the crush depth of the pressurized version... 

It would be crazy to think that the base model of this truck is strong enough to drive 150ft under water. If the air compressor is rated for breathing air, the air storage tank could act as a whole vehicle scuba tank...

Fun thoughts!"
It already has three motors and four perfectly functional propellers. Why put an outboard on it?
That would be sweet
"Yeah, I saw a video posted overnight that shows this too."
More Rivian and less dust buster.
"What is considered cool looking is often just traditional with slight modifications to it. If it's radical, a lot of people just aren't going to like it. People's concept of what is attractive is much more subjective than they realize and not as based in objectivity 

This is why when you look at prior decade trends they usually look ugly"
"[This is a truck](https://i.imgur.com/pmJ5hYW.jpg) from FIAT sold mainly in Brazil and I believe it looks what an Electric Truck should look like, it isn't electric and runs on diesel, but they way it is a truck design while it has its futuristic look is amazing to me, it is a design that you find kind of weird but it grows on you and it sold like a beast here, it doesn't go against truck designs and still has its futuristic looks and I think this is what Tesla does with their normal cars, they aren't against the car design, but they are futuristic and clean as fuck."

He literally said in multiple interviews that he believed that most probably people would not like it but he loved it.  I think this pretty much fits the plan.
"This entire show would've been okay-ish without the glass. As long as you're confident enough, you can pull off something crazy. But the double glass fail really, really ruined that show for Tesla."
"He needed to tell more details.

Interior cabin space?  We saw a bunch of cosplayers exit it, but details?

2 rows of seating? 3?

Crash tests?

Interior styling?

It's a pickup truck and we barely got to see the truck bed"
It looks like something straight out of a sci fi movie. Which is cool and all but doesn’t sell to the average buyer.
"I think they knew they could get the specs, and just wanted to convert a very niche audience. Once they have more resources and enough of a reason to funnel more money into it, they'll expand to the every day man and use word of mouth from the early adapters as publicity...Same thing with the roadster."
"$40k by 2021, and shakier consumer confidence about the lower priced model after the model 3."
they can't produce a stripped-down model 3 for 35k$ but this will be available for 40k$ including autopilot?  somehow I'm going to have to see it to believe it.
"I was never going to buy a truck, but now I want this truck. It's basically an SUV with a bunch of extras and an incredible price point."
"But, who do you think actually buys trucks still?"
"True, but I can't see your neighbourhood contractor/construction worker rolling onto the job site with this truck.  Especially with a truck like the ones Rivian are putting out, I truly hope this serves as a platform and they come out with something a little less.... bladerunner..."
"Yeah this strikes me as ""what would a future truck look like"" rather than ""what would the best electric truck look like""."
"It’s aerodynamics should be considerably better than a normal pickup though, so it’s not all aesthetics. I’m guessing the battery packs needed to match Rivian in range will be much smaller."
Well now they are right...
It's like a hummer raped a delorean and this is what we're all stuck with.
Fucking bingo. I drew an obtuse triangle shaped car when I was in grade school.
"The 80s brought us the Stealth F-117 a plane with technology ahead of our time. This truck borrows from the Stealth, very interesting."
This nails it. It looks like a DeLorean on steroids.
Exactly. A Model X truck would’ve been awesome. Not whatever that was we just saw
"Yes, if the future was rendered on the SNES Super FX"
"Hilarious.
Schrödinger's Sci-fi right here..."
"I don't see the problem with this. How many times have we heard "" Remember those old cartoons that showed us the tech from the future? Everything was wrong, they're so fucking stupid!""."
Why is that a problem?
It would probably have been best if this was the premium model and the regular model was something similar to a conventional truck.
"Ford is pushing hard into the electric market. 

Their E-F150 is going to get the audience Tesla is after. This design basically seals it."

Yep.
"I'm not a truck guy, but my perception of people who are is that at least part of their reason for driving a truck is because it strokes their ego. It makes them feel ""macho"" or tough. It reminds me of how all those ICE trucks blocked the Tesla Supercharger because they still felt like ""electric"" cars are somehow wimpy or weak.

This new Tesla Truck is basically a tank. It seems like it should have the potential to turn the definition of ""tough"" and ""macho"" on its head. I wonder if that's what Elon and team were going for. Maybe they missed the mark, but it certainly looks like a heavy duty brick of a machine."
"How does it fit a ladder rack? There going to be bed size options? Can I get rid of the rear seats to upgrade the bed size? I like the on board 240v, can it push 30 amps so I can run a welder? That would be amazing. 

It's too early to make final judgements but it looks like a truck for people who just like trucks."
I'm down. I drive a Tacoma. You're wrong.
Painting it would eliminate the entire premise of it being a nearly unscratchable surface. Maybe it can be anodized or something to that effect.
A steeper windshield and a flat hood would honestly be s big improvement
"Yeah, I feel like people are way too attached to how a truck *should* look that any diversion from it will look bad to them. The same thing happened when the Model 3 was revealed without a grill."
Because paradigm shifts can also look good and not like something I draw on paper and say 'shit I fucked it up again' and throw the paper out
Me too!
"Possibly, but ""cool"" and ""SUV"" is like toothpaste and orange juice. That one was doomed from the get go."
"Me too, but with all the safety regulations I don't see those coming back unless someone can figure out a way to make it happen. We have been seeing car makers adapt to safety regulations and move away from ugly boxy cars and make slightly less ugly boxy cars and now we have the cybertruck, which is arguably the extreme of hard and boxy design, but it looks pretty neat IMO."
"On the other hand though, there's a new audience looking at it now too. I've never considered owning a truck but this makes me consider it. Since it's electric it's not a pig on gas, and it's very unique and cool. I can never understand people who just go out and buy a car and only base their purchase on how comfortable it is or whatever. Take the badges off and 90% of the time it would be hard to tell what brand car it is. They're all so boring. This you look at and say ""holy shit it's that Tesla truck, how cool is that thing!"" the same way I'd say ""oh wow look at that nice old mustang."" It's rare that a new car makes me turn my head and that's what's nice about the truck. Maybe it'll attract people who think like me."
"On the website it says you can even stand on that lid, i love it"

"Well it was a steel ball thrown at the window, the only thing that would vary is the angle and force of impact. I suspect the presentation was tested with a different ball thrower using a milder force.

Presumably, as the drop tests represents, the glass is still tougher than most glass out there.

I would have preferred a hail test."
"I work in IT and one time a guy during a demo was like ""this laptop is mi-spec'd!"" And proceeded to put it on the ground and step on it only to open the shattered screen. He looked a lot like Elon just did. That being said, they will have to do so much more PPAP testing on the glass before this hits the road that it will all be ironed out."
"Thank you. I was shocked to see how many people will buy the Cybertruck if they were buying a truck, although this group might be biased a little bit."
"It really was, i usually love Elon but when he allowed to throw that ball infront of all those people, i was afraid. Also the failure and the bad design and the long pauses. Felt like audience were planted.

It does have great functionality but this was one of the worst unveiling ever  for me."
Well I don’t know if it was the literal worst ever... but it was bad.
I thought that was a ad at first.
"I just wanted this! :.(

Edit: Here's a better picture of what I was hoping for: https://fossbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tesla-Cybertruck-pickup-truck.jpg"
That was clear glass though. This looks tinted.
Dash needs to be changed.
"the ATV part was just a tease, No specs, Price or availability information yet"
Yes that will produce it. Not sure on when it will be available to purchase.
Elon definitely didn’t act like that was planned. Took all the wind out of his sails and it felt like he cut the event pretty short. Usually these launches are awkward but damn this one hurt
Nah. Elon’s demeanor totally changed afterward. Definitely not planned
"Yeh I am wondering why the big ball drop from 12 feet did nothing. Granted, the demo sheet was a lot larger and a perfect square.. whereas the truck has odd shaped windows that may contribute to them being weaker?"

You nailed it
Will sell like hotcakes in Chicago
"Solves a problem no one here has, for substantial extra cost. Brilliant!"
YEP YEP MOTHERFUCKERS. PRE ORDERED!!!!
Rich enough to have $100 lying around and a dream for a new truck in 3 years.
Why the f would they want the glass to break
Stupid is not just filming a (successful) demo.
"Lol, upvote for the good zing even though I actually like it"
This honestly feels 100% more like a concept car than an actual one
Tell you brother to stock 4-inch steel balls.
"But stopping at a red light in your local slums a whole lot safer, gain some loose some? I mean what does your brother think about those armoured cars politicians and rich guys drive?"
"I do also, and I really didn't like it. :)"
Second vote for Truckla.
$10k at least. Really impressive honestly and the battery's got to be huge. They must be counting on bringing costs down.
I just saw some test drive footages on Twitter and with the front middle seat folded down it's huge where you can lay your elbow on. Never been in a car with 3 seats in front row but looks uncomfortable if someone is sitting in the middle. If people only want range at the high price points than the Cyber Truck is the best one. Rivian 400mi truck is like near $90k.
"I think the person above you Is saying that people who drive trucks partly drive them for their aesthetics, and not purely for their function.  The cybertruck is a better tool no doubt, but I'm interested to see if truck buyers in that price range will actually want to own something like that"
"Lmao you'd rather lug a generator and gas out to a site and have to fill it with gas and have that fucking noise running all the time than just toss 100ft of extension cords in the back? 

I honestly hate the way this thing looks and the steering wheel is attrocious but it kicks the shit out of pretty much every other truck as far as being a work horse. I think I could get over the looks by adding a roof rack and maybe a grill or something but... 

Portable generator and compressor and a ramp in the tail gate and the bed seals itself at the push of a button? Contractors are salivating right now. Plus it's gonna be fun af to offroad with all that instant power."
"I like it too, but it's MUCH stranger looking than I imagined! I love that they threw the ball at the window twice, and it broke twice. I'm not scoffing that it broke; I'm just amazed at the balls on Elon to do something SO risky!"
They really should’ve held this presentation off until closer to production
"Like I’m a designer and if I gave that presentation I would absolutely fail. 

The glass breaking is bad luck, excusable. Just don’t do gimmicks next time. 

BUT SHOW THE THING YOU DESIGNED OFF. Like people came from all over the country to see a prototype driven on stage, hit with a hammer, pull an F-150 and leave?  

No running electric tools off of it. No interior. Yikes"
"My guess was that the shock from the previous hits weakened the glass, even if everything looked ok with the doors. Could have been many other things of course. I think doing that sort of demo was... really stupid and lacked foresight. They could have left it at the ball drop."
Full disclosure: I owned a Honda Element and loved it for its functionality and despite looking a box on wheels.
Yup exactly.
Truck looks sick with the back glass open. And damn I want the ATV
Ah ok! Thanks! Wasn’t aware and was wondering if they popped out of the sides or something.
"I love it and want one, but I have no need for a truck at the moment... If the need arises, this is definitely at the top of my list though!"
"Very true, in fact all Tesla’s are illegal to drive at night because the screen causes retinal damage."
"They probably thought about some of it, but decided it would eat into their profits too much. Kind of like how they bought every electric car design and then hid them until Tesla forced them to innovate."
same here

Cashew outside howboutdat
I lost it
Hi. Welcome to the internet. Glad you found us.
">Is that an actual thing

Almost certainly

>and why?

Are you really surprised that people exist who think masturbation is bad? And that they feel they should promote their warped morality?

(~~4 7~~ *4* minutes to the stream)"
Man I put my reservation in just bcuz it's only 100 bucks and it's perfect for me but I'm low-key hoping they change the design by the time my number is called cuz I'm pretty sure I wouldn't go through with it currently. On paper it beats my current F150 in just about every measure except looks. But that's a big missed category because my god is it ugly.
"Rivian, or the E-F150 when it drops."
Who is Rivian? and why does he win?
Clark Kent vs Tony Stark.  Finally a win for DC Universe!
">Edit: holy fuck it’s not a joke... welp, Rivian wins.  What a fucking mess.

Lmao you have people here thinking Rivian is a person. No one knows what tf Rivian is. To call them a competitor would be like calling Shasta Cola a Coca-Cola competitor."
you only need a $100 for this one
He should have other people do some of the heavy lifting on them
"He’s bad but the crowds don’t help. People love to shout shit at him, and he responds sometimes. Could be a result of doing it too late at night. Apple does their stuff at 10:00am local time. And you get the impression everything has been proofed and practiced at least 3-4 times if not more."
Agreed 100%. I've seen college intro to public speaking presentations that were smoother than that.
"It doesn't look bad IMO, it's like a DeLorean truck or way more closely inspired by Blade Runner than people were expecting. Like people said before the reveal, it's different but I think it will grow on people very quickly."
...it ended
"Cut out mid sentence for me, that's all."
"Alas, Chain drive 2wd.... It might not be a very functional atv for serious use."
"Order page kept crashing for me due to being overloaded. im sure It iwll change a bit as we get closer to production and we get to see more into the bed, mirrors get added and more details on the interior. 

I give them props for being bold, maybe the design will grow on me. I was expecting more of a Model X with a truck bed"
Just ordered
Yeah but what about a wrap? I just want to see how it would look with that finish because I think it’ll look badass. The finish it has now gives it a very delorean esque vibe.
Right? I think it would look super badass
Those tail lights are covered when the bed is up though. I was looking at the as well. Is that a loophole or just an afterthought? I'm so lost.
"Wait, I need to have the truck bed retracted to see out the back?? Uhhh....
I'm going to have to look more into this when I get home.."
I hope that additions don't...take away from the vehicles attractiveness..
"That fade, so cyber puuuunk"
"Now I can’t see much of the interior, but I saw it had a weird steering wheel, like what you’d see in knight rider. Is that going to be stock or is that just prototype?"
"No, Franz did. He seemed hesitant, but Elon pushed him on."
Franz threw a metal ball at the windows and they broke
I bought the $39k version.  2WD is fine for me.  I am not racing.  Waiting is going to suck!
The price of paving the road for the masses. Now all we need to wait for is solid state batteries.
Dad... Get off Reddit.
"Except the glass.  But what if.. What if... This is all 4d Chess move for other people to do the same ""test"" and hurl that ball and it ends up **in** the truck"
"Yes, it is made of metal."
Literally.
"I mean, I truly don’t understand people. This is going to redefine vehicle design. The whole thing is simply amazing. All I can say, I’ve hit the order button immediately. Can’t wait! 😎"
They look the same because the use defines the appearance. There's no substitute for a big-ass truck bed unless you want to tow a dump trailer.
"I hated it...I thought it was a joke. 


Then I saw a side by side with the old school warthog from halo and the nostalgia hit...I want it now"
Different is not exclusively better.
I get way more Mako than Nomad vibes.
They did say they'd do a more conventional looking one if this was too polarizing
An electric F-150 is going to sell no matter what Tesla releases. They sell a million of them a year as it is.
"Yeah, I am debating between the Electric F-150 and the Rivian to be honest. I have a regular F-150 now and I like everything about it - would just like to save gas."
Not at $40k they aren't. Not even at $60k unless it's short range.
"

Elon is forcing Ford's hand and it is mutually beneficial for everyone, including consumers and our air quality. Whoever owns the charging technology also a big winner in my book. Hopefully there won't be a charging standard war like cell phones had. What a mess that was. More charging stations will make so many more people purchase fully electric."
Sooo we still get electric trucks? Just like Elon wanted? Seems like a win to me. Remember what Elon does isn't exactly what would be best for Tesla but more best for all people. At least that's what I think. I think the truck looks cool. Then again I don't own a truck but...I am going to have ton convince my wife on this. Lol!
"That’s exactly what the R1T is, an incubator for the F-150E."
Not if the Mach-e is anything to go by
"And where you charge it? Home or at a lvl 2 for hours on end, not a truly practical work truck"
I highly doubt fords electric tech is even close to this.
"Yup, I wanted a Tesla truck, and now I want an electric Ford."
"Ford makes pennies on the F-150s, they're margins are tiny"
"Sweet. You like the truck. But we're trying to accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation. This truck appeals to so few people in one of the largest vehicle markets, it is going to do very little transformation. Absolutely everyone who buys one of these would have also bought a Tesla F150 copycat.

And, in my opinion, if Tesla doesn't get a more conventional design out before the cybertruck goes into production, it seems like Tesla will have given up the first mover advantage in the electric pickup space with an hommage to 80s futurism."
"Yup. Honestly. You win them over with the specs. You can see how goddamn cocky he was over the specs and price, and he would have had every right to be if they hadn't rolled out the most polarizing design for a truck that ever existed.

For as bad as the design and presentation was, everything else looks incredible."
I own a 75k F-150 Limited and would absolutely switch.
Agreed
Swear to god there’s a part of me that wants to own this because it looks like an 80’s movies low budget future concept design and I want to pretend I’m in total recall or Robocop
"Yea for a Tesla subreddit everyone here is mostly conservative in the end. We should welcome radical designs, as long as they're functional of course."
It's actually using the ridiculous wheel that roadster 2 has. It's probably a good thing they didn't dwell on it.
Tesla’s are literally popular because they’re a good looking sporty electric car rather than being some ugly and weird looking beast that most other electric vehicles are. This is the exact opposite and you are out of your mind to think that this might appeal to people in the same way the S/3/X/Y all do
Rivian version will be >2x the price unfortuately.
I literally cannot understand how that happened. Unless that guy has some sort of super strength
"Yeah I saw the glass demo, luckily. You want the glass to shatter into a ton of small pieces because it's generally safer and gets out of your way in emergencies"
The demoed glass was allowed to flex. They unclasped it and it kinda bounced. I'm sure that's why it didn't shatter.
"Yeah, I’m wondering if that is what happened. Someone switched out the glass to tempered glass since that is needed on the side windows."
"It has to be a law, water pressure is a big deal if you end up in a car under water. That's basically the entire reason they use tempered glass"
"> Utterly unrealistic scenarios that exist in people's minds that just don't simply happen in reality. I would even go as far as to say the number of times someone shattered the window in their own car to escape a situation where they couldn't open the door has essentially never happened. Maybe 1 instance per year if that.

If, for whatever reason, you find yourself in your car underwater you're physically unable to open the door and have limited time to escape. You don't have many options, you can either wait for enough water to get in so the pressure is manageable, or you shatter the window so the pressure equalizes. There's a reason modern car door windows are tempered glass."
You can stay
Ever since gas prices went down the amount of h2's I've seen have increased exponentially. These people are going to get the truck
"Redditors didn't throw the metal spheres at the thing, Elon and Franz did."
Yeah and that won't happen that often with the cybertruck.
Yup.
The nose of the M3 changed between the prototype unveiling and the production version.
"I do not, in the slightest bit, miss the instrument cluster. Nor does anyone else that I know who owns one."
"Exoskeleton is Elon-speak.  It's just a unibody structure, which has been universally shunned by the truck market forever (e.g. Honda Ridgeline).  Re: crash damage, they will treat it just like any automotive unibody, except for the added complexity due to use of heavy gauge stainless steel.

Unibody structures are load bearing, which complicates redesigns.  And as I mentioned, will completely negate any chance of this truck being used as a vocational vehicle.

This is a niche product.  That might be okay, but it is not an F-150 competitor."
">everything is on the screen in the middle

that's the way the 3 is right now...I sorta like it"
"umm, you never saw a tesla?"
"You’ve just convinced me not to buy it.

The whole time I was thinking “if it just wasn’t so pointy...” “ if the rear was more like a cover than a slope...”

And now I see your version and it’s so much better and I still hate it. 

I just can’t do it. I’ve been waiting for this truck and I was worried it was going to be ugly, but this is ridiculous.

Elon put ugly in a trebuchet and flung it full force  all the way out to “what the actual fuck” territory.

I was literally waiting to put a deposit down. The three year timing is perfect for me, and I just can’t do it.

I don’t know what I’m going to do now."
I actually don't mind the front end as-is.  It's the bed and roof line that need to be fixed
"Yeah, it's called a van."
Sorey but that back looks ugly af
"Oh my, that would be ugly. Thankfully it isn’t like that."
"Nice, jealous!

Y is kinda boring this is bonkers but actually practical.

Cant believe $40k"
Perfect!
Bingo
"Exactly!  Plus you mix in paint, different wheels, logos... it'll come together then suddenly a large group of ppl will love it.  By the time this thing drops, enough ppl will be clamoring to make it a success."
One million percent agree with you...it reminds me of the iOS revamp a few years ago when everyone was calling it hideous and that 5 year old drew the icons and interface and look at us now...this vehicle is nothing short of epic!
"Oh I am aware. Just pointing out it is very similar, not good imo."
He wasn't prepared from the start.
He was too consumed with making a mental list of who to fire
Yikes on bikes
It's like that because it's a prototype. It will have a normal steering wheel.
that steering wheel isnt allowed i think. just like the no mirrors thing. Its just for the cool factor right now
"Yeah, that's one thing that I really dislike about the renderings of the 2020 Roadster."
Tesla is in the process of migrating their sales systems. They are probably using a specialized one time server for this in the meantime and it can't possible handle the load from the event. i imagine in the coming days we will all receive our order confirmations. I made sure to screenshot my RN numbers along with the order date and time to ensure record of what went down. also confirmed they sent the payment request to the bank. now we wait!
I haven’t received one yet
They didn’t send one and I didn’t save the page cause I rely on emails to send it to me. My payment went through 3 times cause phone site was having issues. Any updates on the email?
"I actually really loved it. I don't know how many it will sell comparatively to a converted F150 but i do know that design and art change over time. We never know what will be normal in the next 10 years. This was a bombshell design that will diverge opinion for a while. That's exactly the fucking car I want to drive. I'm not expecting anyone to understand, I just fucking loved every inch of it and how it takes the utilitarian aspects to the moon and back. i have weird taste but whatever man. i drive me, and you drive you!"
"My wife said hell nah lol and she loves the Tesla model s. I’m thinking once they see the atv and crazy options, they might change their mind lol"
Well since it lowers maybe she’ll love the fact she won’t have to jump up to get into a truck.
:D Exactly! So next a Tesla Boat.
I thought maybe for the people that pre ordered would get one as a surprise extra. Elon seems to do cool things like that. Almost worth pre ordering just to see.
I think they meant the ATV
"Im not speaking of the cyber truck. If you watched the reveal, towards the end they pulled an electric ATV 4 wheeler into the bed of the cyber truck and plugged it in."
"Can't wait to buy it then, they'll tweak this"
It's more traditional to say the least. The question is are there enough pickup truck drivers ready to get WILD and buy something CRAZY? Nobody has offered them something like this before so we will have to see how the market reacts. It's a huge gamble. Either it's laughed out of the room or it forever changes what a pickup can be.
Elon’s kid designed it.
they'll get a nuclear reactor for unlimited range.
Lots of sun though.... Also can you find a gas station there?
"Agreed, stockpiling electricity is so much easier."
How do you plan to recharge these for a forward deployed military unit? Probably with a gas burning generator.
Just like Hummer did with the H2
No.  Regular tempered glass would have shattered into tiny bits and allowed the metal ball into the vehicle.
"No.  Regular glass would not have held like this did, against a solid metal ball thrown against it.  Try it with your car and tell me what happens."
"You don't think they tested this before the unveil?  LOL.

The problem is they likely used the same glass for tests / rehearsal AND the presentation, where it finally failed.

https://www.glassonweb.com/article/glass-thicknessfragmentation-behaviour-stressed-glasses"
"Exactly, if your goal in life is to stand out and be noticed this fits the bill and it accelerates like a super car."
"I suspect it'll find a place with both. To go to a job site and run your heavy duty power tools off your truck without having to pull an 8 or 10 gauge extension cord is a pretty significant benefit.

Fleet fuel costs are expensive, and trucks get shitty MPG."
Except the Germans won’t make a truck for NA. How does an SUV compare to this beast?
"Why $20-25k? $35k is an *average* new car price. They’re not going for the cheap car market, are they?"
">What they really need is a $20 - $25000 car.

What they need is a gen4 that's half the price of Model 3. $20,000 instead of $39k. Easy peasy. Instead, they decided to stay in the luxury/sports market!

Correction, Tesla doesn't need that, but WE WOULD LIKE IT.

A Model 3 with 180miles/170 horsepower would probably still cost $30-32k for Tesla. Hard to make it any cheaper. Roof, frunk, and fake-leather seats all $optional."
Cheap? It can withstand a sledgehammer
I would
"Would you buy a Honda Civic for $20,000, with a 220-mile electric range? Leases for about $350 or so?

Yes."
"If it was $5-10k cheaper, yes! I know looks are important to many people, but I'm all about form follows function."
[deleted]
"An older Elon Tweet I think claimed that range for the pickup. Won't search it though I know the claim was made. The difference being the claim was unverified, now it's listed as a specification for long range version of the truck. Obviously meeting it eventually means when it's produced but for now it remains there as a promise and so far they have a history of delivering on range promises for any upcoming vehicle."
"Elon definitely got flustered by the broken windows but what they delivered are fantastic specs. I have a feeling once someone drives the truck, just like every Tesla, they will understand."
I’ll take rm. A fleet would be dope.
"This is the first design of a mainstream vehicle that breaks the current design cycle. Of course people will not like it, but I for one, welcome it with open arms. The design makes me think 'the future is now'."
This is my guess. They dont need 80% to like it they need 10% to love it 10% to be like fuck it that's different why not...
"1. Teslas have lots of settings already. Seems trivial to tap a ""worksite"" button to have it lower the bed. As others have noted: tools/things you'd load over the side of the truck are likely to live in the Frunk/Sail storage. Having grown up with trucks and spending a lot of time around people with them to this day; I get that the bed configuration isn't ideal and I'm not making an argument for it. Just wondering how much higher it is vs. a standard F150. Couldn't find ""Ground to top of bed"" measurement easily online.
2. I live in the city. Hauled \~15,000lbs of rock, cement, and dirt for a yard project recently. Have several more coming up. Yeah - not going to happen often, but having this would've drastically reduced the number of trips taken in the Dodge Dakota I was driving with it's back end dragging.
3. Yep - just noting that for everyone going ""6.5' is so short!"" that only one config of the F-150 has a longer bed and wondering aloud which is the most popular.
4. 100% get it. Not saying it's a selling point, just making the observation that the difference there is significant.
5. Totally fair. Was just making the observation that coming in under $40k base is a pretty impressive accomplishment.

In all: I'm not saying that this truck is going to win over the F150 crowd. My F150 owning friends were texting me during the presentation going ""This has to be a joke, right?""

For someone like me who has liked the idea of a truck, but doesn't like the fuel efficiency, styling, or general practicality of it, the Cybertruck actually checks a lot of boxes. For a camping rig to take up to the mountains in the summer, throw snowboards in during the winter, comfortably seat 5/6 people, have a decent looking accessory kit for camping as shown in some of the promo shots on their site, have it also be fully electric to charge from my roof, have good handling and performance, and get to drive something that looks kinda like a big Delorean to boot?

Man. I'm sold. I'd never buy an F-150, I would absolutely buy one of these. I'll bet they sell a lot better in cities than in middle America though."
"Huh. You can configure both cab styles with both lengths on their site.

[https://shop.ford.com/build/f150/](https://shop.ford.com/build/f150/)

As to your Caliber Effect comment - will be interesting to see how that pans out! In the interior shots, the A-Pillar doesn't seem that much further forward relative to the driver seat than the cars I have/drive now."
Waiting in line for a test ride so I haven't seen it in person yet but I think the pics look pretty nice
"I mean, 'bullet proof glass' is 100% illegal.  Safety glass crumbles to prevent lacerations and huge cuts.  I'd fear what would happen if you accidentally drove this into a body of water.

Then again, we know the glass is bullshit, so."
"People that take the time to comment on a Tesla reddit are not representative of the general public. In fact, you can say that this group is incredibly bias TOWARD Tesla and yet, have displayed an alarming amount of concern. That is the point I am making."
Oh thank goodness. We can control the population.
"They will get flooded with pre orders either way with the deposit only being a refundable $100.

They would be better off making this more expensive, like an exclusive EV hummer, because it fails miserably as a jobsite vehicle. Bed is too short, no ingress to it from the sides. Poor setup for aftermarket mounts and racks."
"If they don’t sell enough to cover the cost of tooling up an assembly line, the niche just became a very big problem."
Lol
nah its elaborate maybe at the end the real one comes out
"Hm? Driver position is in the normal spot [https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/09\_Desktop.jpg](https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/09_Desktop.jpg)

The middle seat is a passenger seat."
...it's on the [normal right hand side](https://imgur.com/qSd0LmE)? Not the center...
Hell ya baby!
Not necessarily - bulletproof glass shatters when bullets hit it - but they don't go through - like with this test :D
THEY DIDNT GO THRU!
I'd like to see how comfortable it is for the driver since there's literally a seat next to the driver seat.
It's private property....
Interior is same as model 3.. was holding for a screen in dash at least
"I presume the peaked roof and sloped/covered bed are purely for aero advantage, but they massively increase the volume of the truck.

And while it's been a good long while since I owned a truck, it was always handy to be able to reach over the side rails to grab stuff.  This design is going to make that difficult.  Only possible way to salvage that functionality is a really low kneel mode for the suspension."
I agree. I guess I'm just trying to find some sense of it.
"Ah yeah, saw another comment mentioning during the other reveal they didn’t have the mirrors on. Makes sense, just sell the sex at the reveal."
"I was just horrified because I can't help but sympathize when people presenting hit those awkward moments, I feel so bad for them."
"Yeah, I thought at first that the sledge may have shifted something around, but then the back window got messed up too... but maybe they just didn't test it with the cybertruck beforehand at all, that's crazy."
"Yeah, it train wrecked that presentation, which was actually going very well despite the contentious design."
"yee, then whoever installed that is going to be having a rough life soon, ouch."
Or a larger ball?  I’m glad it didn’t penetrate at least lol.
Chupathingy
"Just curious, what do you mean, ""it will do all that""? 

Inverters and air compressors already exist, and aren't expensive, so..."
I tried to click ugly and amazing... it didn't work.  It's ugly and i love it!
These door handles maybe very erotic
"Someone else in this thread has listed all the ways this won't really be useful for many people in, say, the construction industry, or contractors. 

Cybertruck is basically the new Hummer."
"Where do I put my big ladder, where do I load lengths of timber? What the heck kinda roof rack am I going to put on there and how silly will that look?"
I don't think most trucks are purchased by businesses.
This is what I assumed as well. The metal should be very resistent to heat and strength as it's the material they would be using for the spacecraft.
"Elon said it wouldn't break, it broke = botched demonstration


If I promise the sun isn't going to rise, and we see it rise then I botched my demonstration...even if you like the actual result better."
"They had us in the first half, not gonna lie"
Lol
"Yeah, but trucks in particular have had the same base design since I can remember. 

For me, this new Tesla CyberTruck clashes with the idea of a truck and a car in genera. I know they try to revolutionize the industry in some way or form but many of us we were expecting something something radically modern but still with the Tesla touch. The Roadster looks more futuristic than the CyberTruck."
"Umm, Tesla is a public company. Their job is to sell as many cars as possible ."
"I loved it, can't wait to take it and the atv hunting."
"God I hope so. I could understand a hastily designed body if he was marketing a ""skateboard"" EV chassis but that's not what he was doing. And the glass...I laughed my ass off out of sheer confusion."
"So? Who said all old things look bad? Personally I love some old cars, the only cars I really hate are 80s and 90s cars."
Here you go. [enjoy the pre-order](https://static.psycom.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kubler-1024x806-1-1024x806.jpg)
"-- Elon, probably."
"Both the windows broke, it's gotta be a joke! I REALLY hope it isn't though..."
"Of course. It's also possible that a previous test of that exact window weakened it, but not enough to actually break it."
Or the Running Man.
I only liked the front lol
"Like most trucks of the last 10-20 years, this appears to be a truck for people who don't need a truck"
"Understood, and air suspension as a premium option makes sense to me. However, most of the working world is fine with the stock 9"" of ground clearance on full size pickups and would prefer a simpler product they could repair themselves."
Holy shit that looks so good
That looks way better. It would also make the truck bed easier to get tools in and out of.
Yeah but improved the looks by 10000000%
Yeah this is NOT going to sell...
Yeah but they're not stainless and hard AF.
"The Ridgeline initially was unibody, but Honda learned their lesson and switched to frame and has a more 'normal' pickup bed.  Sometimes there is no point in reinventing the wheel."
Body on frame doesn't impact (no pun intended) crumple zones on pickup trucks.
Dusts off arc welder...
"Must be new around here, they never do lol"
Elon should hand the presentation over to a professional and perhaps make an appearance in a support and welcome role.
I’ve triggered the fan boys.
That seems generous. 😂
[deleted]
Maybe the seats will fold out of the way?
"> I don't think that many people from the UK will get one, on our roads it will be a utter tank and the design of it may be more than a little off putting in some historical places like Oxford due to the size.

I live in the UK and I will definitely be getting one of this. Probably have to restrict my shopping to Costco because only they have the big parking spaces!"
How?! Look at the front bar! It’s totally a warthog!
Like the upcoming electric F150?
"Not true. Curves = cost. They are saving tremendous amounts of money in not have to build out stamping, paint, or expensive tooling. Read the motor trend write up."
"It's like the air pods, my first impression was WTF that's ugly but people bought it"
"The battery wouldn't last as long with worse angles, no?"
Cool looking truck ?
How’s your experiment going?
What’s a boomer? Did you mean Beemer like BMW as it doesn’t look like one of those? Definitely looks like a DeLorean from that movie set in the past and future where all the kids in 2015 were total dicks.
"you won't get any disagreement from me there. 

I really do think they made this material - the realized nobody in the world had machines that could press into shapes, then realized paint doesn't really hold onto stainless well, then thought... then elon just said - fuck it - mad max delorean."
"Ah yes... the sr-71 which cost how much each?

I'm not defending it - I think it's fucking hideous - I'm just trying to find logic in how it looks.

Because logic would dictate something that looks like a minified version of the Semi."
Yes. Front windshields break very easily from the inside.
You want rescue workers to be able to easily break it if you are incapcitated. So it should be easy to break from either direction.
"That would made more sense but even still "" the glass is not strong enough"" has not been a problem for decades. Automotive windshields and windows are actually a thing that are very well designed for safety in consumer vehicles. I'd rather seen more towing and hauling demos which are the things that impress truck buyers"
The Beast also doesn't have to do NHTSA certifications.
That is not a mass-produced vehicle. Only low-production boutique vehicles are allowed to use bullet proof glass or eschew any other normal safety measures.
Ronald Reagan would say it's not safer.
You...cut and weld a new piece?? idk lol
"Damn, that’s a really good question. Maybe tesla is assuming that the material is strong enough to withstand low speed collisions?"
How does roundedness help in every day driving exactly?
"The design is probably dictated by the monocoque chassis. The few monocoque trucks which have been built need special triangular supports between the main cabin and the pickup bed or the vehicle would warp. A body-on-frame truck allows the cabin and bed to move separately.

Also, the cover is probably essential for the aerodynamic efficiency and thus range at speed. Since most pickups are used as cars most of the time, this is a really important part of the overall energy efficiency."
Opps!  Corrected.  ;P
Where/when?
Why would anyone selling a product deliberately make it so ugly?
I think he expected Tesla to try to compete with Ford by building something like Ford would build
It means he thought Tesla was going to actually try to sell trucks.  I would expect very few preorders for this horrible idea...  holy cow...
And Apple stuff always leaks because it comes out a month later. Very happy nothing was leaked or ruined.
"You couldn't pay me $69,000 to let this dumpster fire sit in my driveway."
Didn’t think I would see that in my lifetime
Well done. Thank you!
"But who is this targeting? Not your regular Joe worker guy who needs a truck for work.

This really seems more for people who want some big, flashy vehicle to joyride around in, or people who want some powerful off-roading vehicle. 

So I mean it's like the Hummer in that sense. I'm not talking specifically about the design, but about the 'coolness' factor of it and what type of buyer that will attract."
Lmao 10^12 . I took some measurements and you’re right.
True. I don’t buy one because I don’t want to have a gas guzzler truck and I don’t want to be one of those people who haul their lattes home at the expense of the environment. This changes the math for me - it’s also a benefit that I really like how it looks. I like that it’s edgy and people hate it.
"But it’s not just Tesla, it’s all the truck companies. Everyone is making luxury versions of their trucks, for people who don’t actually need a truck. You can try to argue this all you want, but people will continue buying pickup trucks for no reason."
"I'm still a bit nervous it will be tooo far out there, but I'm also excited to finally see it."

"Talk amongst yourselves, I'll give you a topic.  Radical reconstruction of the south was neither radical or reconstruction.  Discuss."

Isn't that the textbook definition of manipulating your stock price? If you know you're going to redesign but stay quiet and let your shares drop.
Sucks so bad because I need a truck before then... decisions lol
Says video is private.
"video is private now. 

Tesla must've realized they fucked up bad. People are laughing at their - 

* horrible presentation

* cringey Elon delivery

* ridiculous cyber truck. I think everyone who is behind this lost their mind

* the windows shattered!! ahahahahahaha...

I think Tesla trucks are a flop with this iteration. They broke rule 0 of EVs - don't make stupid goofy looking vehicles."
video is private now. Presumably they'll upload it again later.
Says it's private.
they made it private :/
"Watching critical role, not even close to bed time."
You and I clearly expect trucks to look differently.
eTron
Doesn’t it legally need mirrors?
Elon was too shook!
Confirmed solar option
Definitely want one haha
I just wanna know the price so I can plan accordingly lol
"yikes, that makes sense. Someone made a big mistake there"
Franz is totally fired!
They didn't hit the back door though?
Why did the second window break then?
\[Duel of Fates plays\]
"Yeah, if they want truck competition they should have had some blue collar folks help outage in design and not just cybr pnks.

Thanks for bringing this up as I didn't think about it. Very often you just walk up to the side of the bed to reach in.

A flat bed side is just convenient to hop in or hop on when there bed is full."
You would keep your tools in the frunk.
"Good point, not from the sides, but at the tail.

Upside - bed comes with a cover. Tailgate has built in ramp...."
"If that upper bed triangle folded down, or also folded flat like kind of a flat bed...."
"Bugs can be fixed brah, looks way more sleek in general (that nav map!) and maybe even more practical with the buttons on the left."
"Sorry can't link right now, but look for videos of people taking test rides. You can see it in action in most of those."
Ahh. Well if they can do that then maybe they won’t do the side mirrors either.
"Well, actually it does self drive"
This but unironically
Thanks. Tell Elon. I could use a side gig lol
ouch
"Actually, the ballistic glass performed just like all ballistic glass, it “breaks” but doesn’t let the projectile through. 

Just look at other vehicle ballistic glass demonstrations."
"That would make sense, it cant exist in a normal market."
"Tesla's cars all have a decidedly ""Tesla look"", but still look like a normal car. This thing just visually looks too far off base for the mass market to me. Tesla fans will buy it, but I don't see this swinging the average F150/Ram owner."
"It looks like it's straight outa blade runner 2049, on wheels instead of flying. Looks sick!"
"Yeah, well you know that just like...your opinion man."
Majority of purchases are about aesthetics...
Yeah because almost everyone cares about what a car looks like when buying one.
"What f350 only tows 13,000 lbs?"
"An F350 will do up to 21,000 lbs in conventional towing and up to 32,500 lbs in a gooseneck/5th wheel configuration."
"Yeah I think they should have shown more of people doing normal truck stuff with it, like camping."
Rivian's looks better.
"Yes, they're also showing storage drawers/boxes in the bed above the tailgate, and then sleeping on top of that."
Elon had to have cut the presentation short after staring at those two shattered windows.
I really hope they change the roof line and add more curves...
"I think they were afraid of low pre-order numbers, so they significantly cut the price."
"You're probably right, but the mods can comb through that. It's better than just not having anything on the front page except for a catchall megathread."
Nope just checked. It was posted as new thread to the sub.
A bed that allows him to load and remove stuff from all angles. Pretty much the main ask of a pickup truck.
"This definitely has stuff that mine doesn’t, it honestly is mostly looks. I just don’t think there’s anyone out there who has bought several trucks and is in the market for a new one who closes their eyes and pictures that."
"And that scares me. It's priced like something Elon thinks will get scaled and mass produced. I see this being a novelty. A few people will have it. He should have said, ""$100K limited edition"" then I could see the appear. The model 3 is mass produced cause the design is classic, people like it, etc. THis is over the top.  I can't see this coming off the assembly line in the thousands per day but as a share holder I sure as s*** hope I'm wrong."
"People are viewing the site and thinking, ""wow that's cool. not sure i want that in my driveway but it's sweet to look at"" or they think it's ugly. BUT a site crashing because of views is different then preorders."
Where did you get this number?
I'll be blown away if it isn't down tomorrow. I hope I'm wrong.
The delusional comments is when you know you’re on the right side
I guess Tesla is also the best and making the ugliest vehicle? I agree I never thought I would see something uglier come out in my lifetime that an Aztec.. i was wrong
"This isn't in the same league as the S or the X. It's a horrible design and it's not practical for the target demographic. 

Only thing it has going for it is the price point."
And that's not the market Elon wants to Target.
"Yep, I stand corrected.  Even better."
"We need to see the dimensions of the bed first.  The bed also looks totally flat - no wheel arches, which is an advantage.  Agree with you on the high side walls though."
"> It's like they've never actually used a truck before. 

This is a key thing for me, and pretty apparent from the design that this was made by engineers living in a modern city.


There is actually a reason that trucks are shaped the way they are. Reaching over into the bed is just a natural way to put stuff back there. [Other trucks in this market even make foot hold specifically for it](https://youtu.be/79EAYa5sG2A?t=122), making it easier to reach into the bed from the side."
"I am wrong.  It's ""Ultra-Hard 30X Cold-Rolled stainless-steel"""
I think you meant it can drag your real truck behind it like a toy.  It carries more.  Tows more. Has more ground clearance.  Faster.  Much faster.
Right? An air compressor? Easy add-on to any pickup. What a joke.
"Yep, that collective gasp!

I'm thinking now that it's at least a year away from production, is that it's really just a concept car...I hope I'm right!"
Closer to accurate without the % sign.
"Same. Everyone in my family has a pickup. They'd be willing to consider a Rivian/Atlas. They wouldn't be caught dead in this. Neither would I, for that matter."
And in that year 1.5 million more fossil fuel trucks hit the road.
Rivian/Atlas/Ford/GM will be happy to provide you with a practical electric pickup in <5 years. Apparently Tesla isn't interested.
Hell ya
They have two years to get accustomed to the view.
Base f150 only pulls 5k lbs. this is 50% more at the base level
On the website it says 14000+
I should've said 49. Blade runner 2049
"True... unless they start with something else, like a video or something. It will be whatever happens first(video/speaker/lights/etc), as part of a contiguous sequence of events, unless there is an obvious delay or stall tactic.

I don't want to overcomplicate the rules too much, so it'll ultimately be up to me. Sorry."

Yup.

I posted that moments after the glass demo. It’s the biggest on stage failure in Tesla history.

"The Model 3 reservations were refundable, and so are the Model Y orders right now. And looking into it, [the $5k Roadster reservations are refundable as well](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/TeslaRoadsterReservationAgreement_20171116_en_US.pdf). Refundable is 100% normal."
"I'm thinking sabotaged OR, for some reason, the did the drop tests but didn't try actually throwing the ball at a window in situ. Maybe the way the frame held it, or the angle..but you would think they would 100% have tried this beforehand."
Is that granite?
Omfg that dash looks like granite or something
Gawd. That’s even worse.
Where do you find the cyberlink interior pictures on the site? I can only see the option to buy it.
"True.  Tesla has also been lobbying hard to allow cameras instead of mirrors.  It helps reduce drag a lot.  I thing some countries allow cameras but not the US yet.

I can picture a cybertruck towing a trailer with great big after-market side mirrors, looking like a Gremlin (the creature, not the car) or Dobby the house-elf (for the younger crowd)."
Guess I haven’t. Is it still considered a prototype? When do you think we see the final spec?
The audi etron can be optioned with digital mirrors and the lexus es too
How are they already taking preorders for it? Like they just give you your money back?
">Stainless is pretty rust-resistant.

Is this a joke from OP or something? Stainless and rust resistant literally mean the same thing"
"Then why do it? Surely this took quite a bit of resources that could have been invested elsewhere? Trucks are some of the most frequently sold vehicles, it makes complete sense to go after that market segment but this really feels like a misread on that audience, like who is the expected consumer for this then if not the typical truck buyer?"
Doesn't really make sense business wise with the capabilities this truck has. If they would've made it even a little more traditional it would dominate the entire truck market but this just seems like a bad joke. People who buy this for the capabilities are going to be made fun of. I mean the capabilities are incredible but the design is atrocious. The truck market is the largest auto market in the US and this could have been huge for Tesla. I feel like instead this has made people lose confidence in the brand a bit.

Quote from every Aztek and Nissan Juke owner.
"I was thinking TUV (Truck Utility Vehicle) because it implies a merging of ""Truck"" and ""SUV."" At the same time, it clearly tells us this isn't like anything you've seen before.

The other route might be something like a play on Humvee, but I'm not sure exactly how. If this new class was like a hybrid between pick-up and Humvee, it would probably feel more approachable."
"You're absolutely right. Never desired a truck, because most people that have that don't even use them for their purpose. I was going to get a model 3, but just preordered the truck."
"It's not for Middle America, it's for the tech bros in Silicon Valley."
"It’s not designed for people in middle America, they weren’t ever going to buy an electric Tesla anyway."
"Yeah, none of the F150 or RAM drivers around me would buy this.  It is a niche product. Huge fail.

At least it is a 2022 vehicle so Tesla will focus on the cars that actually sell.

What a disappointing reveal."
"My thoughts exactly. As a truck owner, I was expecting to replace my 3500 and this falls short. The bed is tiny, the range isn't great unless you pay $70,000. It looks like a box and is made of steel? I'm disappointed."
[deleted]
"Seems pretty utilitarian to me. Definitely a polarizing design but it’s designed to increase range, has a covered bed by design, built in air compressor, built in power for tools, built in ramp, adjustable suspension high for loading and unloading, has a full sized bed, seats 6, and I’m sure there’s more than I’m forgetting. How does that not have utility?"
Care to explain how it doesn't meet utility standards?

I was saying that OTHERS will give them shit, and will sell off TSLA stock, which will happen. The airbags, safety, and mirrors are all REQUIRED items to be road legal in the US, which this truck does not seem to have as of yet. Hence my comment of a redesign to add these items. 

Coming off as hostile and name-calling was pointless."

"Lol yeah they did, but not in the way you need them to in emergencies."
I'm going to bet (likely due to some sort of regulation) that they'll end up using standard car door windows by the time they launch.
Well now it does after seeing the actual truck
"I guess it's just lighting then, because in the two pre-recorded videos it looked a shade of brown."

RIGHT???
"I don't think selling a lot equals inspirations.

Toyota sells more cars than Ferrari."
"To be fair, ""inspire"" is a different axis than ""mass market seller"".  Toyota Camry's sell a shit ton too, but I don't think anyone says they're ""inspired"" by them."
"Oh I see, didn't realize this was common with prototypes.

>They were going to give rides in it, so there’s going to be a visible interior.

Yeah, that's the other thing that makes me think there was legitimately more to this demo but Musk wanted to get off stage."
"The Mode 3, X, S all had mirrors at their unveil."
"Knew a guy that had dual trailer hitch receivers welded on all four cardinal points on his truck and a winch that could attach to any of them. Pain in the ass to swap, but could pull in any direction."

This guy trucks a lot
"No, loosen means to make something less tight. Loose means to let something go free."
6.5'
6.5 foot length.
They didn't give it but a quad bike is around 40 something inches front to back so I'd take a shot in the dark the bed is 48in front to back tops.
Looks like Halo's warthog from two consoles before*
"You've never owned a truck, have you?"
How would you install storage boxes to the side of this like most utility trucks ? Definitely not practical. I’d like to see a roof rack on this thing
Really? How would you like to try and reach over the side to get something out of the bed.
"It's all ""form"" tbh. It's designed to look ""tough"" but isn't practical at all. The tray looks small and getting things in and out seems a nightmare."
Not if you can't reach over the side.
This isn’t functional at all lol. The F150 is functional and utilitarian. There’s a reason it sells. This “cyber truck” will be joining the Honda Ridgeline
But using this shape instead of a more aesthetically pleasing one would not affect function. So why did they make it look so bad? And so far its functions dont exactly look great.
Pickup trucks look like they’re designed for the job site. This looks like someone spent too much time making it seem like they didn’t spend any time on the design.
"Triangles are the strongest shape at least...I think? Fuck I'm no engineer, and I'm too broke to afford it anyways lol.

If they just made it a bit more normal it would have been amazing though. Top model hits that 500mi range finally. I assume without a load, though."

"If you hit something onthe road all that energy will go straight to you, there is a reason we moved from rigid to crumple zones"
Where did you read that?
I’m pretty sure you can bend and stamp stainless steel. 300 series stainless isn’t some super exotic metal that’s any stronger or difficult to work than regular carbon steel used in the panels of some trucks. The demo comparison was probably an aluminum F-150 door which is a softer metal.
"You can form and roll almost all  common stainless steels. No need for exotic materials of that level on a consumer product, IMO. Making the door of plastic would have made them equally as ""undentable"", just ask anyone with a used Saturn."

"There are ways to get past that. For example, the body panels could be mounted in a way that yields rather than the panels themselves"

"That was a faux forgetfulness on the ATV, he does that “oh yah one more thing"" at every reveal and the prices all flashed in the screen behind him, not sure what you wanted him to do."

The glass didn't break in the isolated demo immediately prior... I can't imagine he expected it to break on the actual truck.
I agree. Had to be scripted. There is no way that would have been the first time they tried to crack that glass.

"Not quite literally, but this [Motor Trend article](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/cybertruck/2021/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info/) says 8 weeks before the debut (today) they went to see it and it was clay.  WIth 2 weeks to go ""we had a chance to go back and check in on Tesla's progress on the Cybertruck. The life-size clay model we'd seen before had—quite shockingly— been joined by a half-finished Cybertruck running prototype."""
"Definitely didn’t this is a working prototype, same exact one that was in the drag race video"
I believe this.
This made me laugh out loud. Have my upvote.
"https://youtu.be/KoutN_Ezs8w

About 13:40 if timestamps didn’t work."
That would defeat the point then.  I think you're wrong.
Canyonero!
Canyonero!!!
"I guess the way to say it is, if he wanted to compete against the F150 he should have built an F150 with Tesla design language and all of Tesla’s advantages. 

But he really wanted to build cybrtrk.  Which should have been its own product category, it would be better received."
"If it were _that_ vital, they would've come out with a less polarizing design.  Polarizing is a very generous word, because outside of this subreddit, people are being much less kind about it."
Probably for advertisement. They kept sending me emails about model 3 until I bought it.
"No idea, just use a fake one if you're worried. There's no confirmation link sent."
That first one actually looks like something people would actually buy. Unlike this... thing.
Yeah I suppose...not sure about the main group of people that made trucks the three top selling automobiles.
"I kept waiting for it, especially with how awkward it got at times, but it appears that's it. One can hope for some slightly less polarizing design options, but I doubt that's going to happen at this point. 

Idk man."
wtf it looks like it was real. I burst out laughing at the windows breaks cause I thought it was a skit.....
"Oh... maybe you're right? I guess I just assumed that if they made one, they'd be selling it."
Lol you're asking the wrong person but if I were to guess I'd say 1 motor for each axle and a 3rd to act as a type of turbocharger
No Fucks Given Elon Balls
"I feel like the look will take people time to adjust to. I was actually anticipating it looking much more cartoon sci-fi fantasy and outlandish than what it actually ended up being. Like I was expecting a truck that looked like it was trying to be Jetsons car mixed with a tank. And what we got I feel looks like something they'd make to be in a Bladerunner movie... The brushed steel exterior makes the design feel grounded to me somehow, I was expecting black glossy metal finish which would have made it look a little cartoony and other typical ""futuristic"" design choices. So I feel like they achieved exactly what they were going for. It's polarizing, but it's not ridiculous (in my opinion) like it could have been."
yes
"I do understand. I know it won’t change much but some things will, especially if they are receiving less orders than they expected."
If they put in a heads up display it would be ok.. I think in a truck even more so it is important to keep eyes on the road so having speed in your forward line of sight instead of looking to right would be much better
"Take that back, the clamps spring open when the ball drops, for the bounce. Probably would have broken without the glass bouncing."
"Yup, saw that after I re-watched."
"Wait, that's a new strategy"
Which seems weird and backwards
so realistically late 2023
Oh hell yeah.  The tri is the one i want too. It's growing on me the more i look at it.
I think u mean 2022 for tri-motor
"If they’re saying 2021, count on 2023"
I’m not a pickup guy but I always love seeing a Raptor on the road. Such awesome looking trucks. Damn good try!
"

why the fuck they showed the truck like its bulletproof? 
look at the side windows from event"
"Why clearly? Did the ball penetrate?

This is what happens with [bulletproof glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletproof_glass#/media/File:Bulletproof_glass_window_after_a_burglary_attempt.jpg). The glass will still break on the surface.

It didn't look impressive to those who haven't seen armored glass before, but it did its job. Normal automotive safety glass would've shattered completely and the ball would've gone right through into the front seat."
Yeah I assume it was a rebroadcast screen recording.
"Yeah, I just use the camera in the X.  Now that I think about it, that's actually strange for me.  I still turn my head checking adjacent lanes though.... but then it's my wife's car so I'm not driving it enough to fully adapt."
Lol yes good point and I'm aware. To me it half-looks like a really lifted aventador.
"Cameras are't allowed to be substituted for mirrors.

Maybe in a few years, but there's serious nighttime issues."
"https://youtu.be/QSR6Y2gNeI0

Depending on the car and depth, you deserve to get to the other side.

That’s why I was asking about the car."
"There are no side mirrors on the roadster either.
The Honda E has no side mirrors. With all the cameras, there is no point and it cuts down on alot of drag"
The steering wheel has got to go too. Looks cool but totally impractical.
https://youtu.be/2-OqIjXOrwM
they were trying to demonstrate the glass being very strong but when he threw the metal ball at it the window broke.
"Er...nothing!! 😅

(Just seen this after getting in from work, assuming you've seen it now?)"
[deleted]
"Well that's not true, since the shattered glass isn't sharp it doesn't matter."
But getting trapped in your own car whilst upside down on the ground is also a pretty shitty situation don't ya think? Imagine not being able to open your doors due to damage *and* not being able to smash your windows to crawl out.
[deleted]
Delorean and a Ridgeline had a baby?
Hopefully it crumples walls just as well
Majority of the accidents are with non-moving objects like walls/light poles/trees. Not too much to crumple
This will be driven on the road. Name the cars being sold today in the US that don’t have crumple zones
CYBRNUTS
"YEET, YEET!"
GOTTDAMITT GRIFF! Stop making up creatures!
"""IT'S A PUMA!"""
Of course it can.
I wonder what the next phrase is people are gonna beat into the ground.
"These are facts lol. 

Regardless,

The car is horrendously looking imo

The presentation was total shit"
Rivian is also thusfar not actually manufacturing anything. I love their suv but... 10 years in and they are still a couple years out from manufacture.
"Rivian has no charging infrastructure. 

Tesla has beat their range as well.

It has the Rivian towing capacity beat as well(14k Tesla vs 11k Rivian)

From what I know a stronger build.

An actually tested autopilot system 

Higher ground clearance(16 inches Tesla vs 14.1 inches Rivian)

Might I add, the base model Rivian starts at the very same price as the highest model Tesla pick up($69,000)"
Look cool to me. This cybertruck is a tank. And the Rivian looks like a toy now.
The Rivian doesn't start at 39k...
"Except the opposite. It's more like when the ugly kid has straight A's, is rich as shit, owns his own business, perfect test scores and a full ride to an ivy league school."
Accelerating sustainable energy?
I was thinking Battlezone. Anyone remember that one?
"its like the George Costanza technique. once tesla has occupied your brain with their out there design, you start to get used to it. and you are like- you know what- it's not that bad. eventually you fall in love it."
You guys... you don't have to stretch yourselves. It's ok to say it looks stupid.
"Agreed, I want to reach over the side to grab something out.  I do it all the time."
Me too. If they just fixed that I'd be happy. Didn't buy a Honda Ridgeline for that exact reason.
I think they probably will. This isn't supposed to be the 100% final design.
I think the air suspension is supposed to combat that. It will drop down low enough to not be an issue I think
"I’m pretty sure that’s for aerodynamics, and it’s also what holds on the retracting bed cover they showed at the end."
They open up for storage
‘Merica. It’s already this way. At least in Arizona.
You mean 99% of truck buyers?
Thanks 🤤
Only if the cybertruck didn't sell very well....so I'm already looking forward to the next truck
"Yep, low centre of gravity, and massively wide track width."
Strange but very cool looking.
"Also, not to argue the windows could handle a bullet, but that metal ball had much more energy than a 9mm bullet would have."
"What is the point of the body withstanding shots fired, if the windows don’t?"
I’ll believe it can withstand a bullet when I see it being shot at.
Msm does this on all their reporting on all subjects. It's garbage
">it's a hard left at any semblance of acceptable car design

That's a selling point for Cybertruck buyers."
250k
Depends which timeline you wanna know about.
"Late 2021. For tri motor, late 2022."
"2021, 2022 for AWD version"
Order page says late 2021 production. Tri-motor late 2022.
"Late 2021 for base model, late 2022 for the high end model. You can see that info on the preorder page. 


https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design"
"2021, 2022 for tri motor"
"I'm sure there will be interested buyers in the coasts. But in the Midwest people are just gonna laugh at this thing. It's so impractical from how people use their vehicles there. And trying to do any body work repairs or maintenance looks like a nightmare. Plus alot if rural folk here see beefed up Fords and GMs as status symbols. And in their eyes this is literally the opposite of everything they are looking for in the appearances of a truck. The specs are nice but it just doesn't seem like a vehicle anyone out there would buy to do work with. Idk, maybe it'll do well on the coasts. But I don't expect my friends back in the Midwest to ever see one of these on the road, especially out of metropolitan areas. Just thinking about how macho rednecks/hicks out in the sticks would react if their friends bought one of these makes me chuckle"
"1. The steel exoskeleton probably requires the angled back for structural integrity. A triangle is the strongest shape. This is completely different than traditional car engineering which is essentially outside panels bolted onto an internal structure of steel tubes.
2. That steering wheel is not going to be used on the production version."
By not buying it?
Nope
Exactly. rivian trucks are more like an evolution from past & present. This one looks like time-traveled from a dystopian future.
thank god. gearing up for the model y purchase within the next few months.
Being emulated on an Atari 2600
Just retrofit it to the rear corner windows on the other cars and call it San Francisco edition
"Can you do it for free and I'll shout you out to my 3 ig followers 

THE EXPOSURE"
You got any wraps that completely change the shape of the body :P
"Ngl, my Initial reaction was of disgust but I watched Marques's video and when I saw that thing driving around with the bright bar lights, I was sold.

Edit: needs more rgb though"
"Joe Sixpack will fucking love it because Joe Sixpack can pick up girls in his bulletproof future truck and also tow 14,000 pounds. And if my contractor showed up in this, I’d be impressed as hell."
"Those are the headlights?

Very cool!"
"I don't htink they ever have. Interior has always been via the ride videos and dedicated photo shoots, like the Motor Trend one here: https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/cybertruck/2021/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info/"
I still can’t believe it’s not tbh.
Franz is at the unemployment line first thing tomorrow.
Maybe it was when the other window broke...
So caught up in laughter I guess. Nice correction lol
"No, he said ""Oh my fucking god"""
no he didn’t
Yep
If they’re a Tesla fan or already driving electric maybe. But I doubt anyone who wants a pickup would buy this purely because of the design.
"Kid got his first Tesla ride 66 hours after arrival....I had to wait 40 years..........


We've worked it out, I get to keep the P3D-, Momma gets Cybrtrk.

And since she commutes by train, I'll be driving it a few days a week...to...ya know....prevent flat spots on the tires or something."
"hahahaha, yea, any coffee after 1pm-ish and I'm up late anyway. today it was on purpose."
"Idk I live in Texas and I don’t know anyone who owns a truck that would be into this. It’s only the luxury car owners that I think would be interested. I can’t imagine any of my buddies that would trade their Ford’s for this, they should have shown people driving through mud, towing stuff, bringing lumber from the Home Depot, idk normal people truck stuff to appeal to the general public and not us already existing Tesla fans."
"Works for me. That's about the earliest I'd expect to be looking, although who knows what factors and options will be then."
You forgot that you have to retract the bed cover too.
Even if it squats right down you're not grabbing anything small out of the back. As a truck owner this simple aspect of the tesla is unacceptable.
Especially when you have to go to the tailgate to move the bed cover out of the way.
"I've tried to find it again, I think it was either on an earnings call or twitter, or both.For sure someone will dig this up though"
"yeah, looks like a relic from the late 80's :)

that's literally the point xD"
Yea 10k comments and 1.7k upvotes. Big oof.
"I don't think it's 50/50, but the people posting seem to either love it or hate it... Though a few are saying it's growing on them.

Either way, I give props to Tesla going out on a limb and trying something really different."
"LOL, as a German I firstly knew immediately that he has to be a German and secondly Totally agree with what he said 😅😂"
yes
Yes. Made me anxious. When the sledge hammer came out I was like finally! The hammer will knock the obviously fake outer shell away revealing the real truck underneath.
"Nope. It’ll sell 100k in the first year. At the very least, they will sell faster than Tesla can make them."
It’s literally a horrific design. Going to be a major flop for Tesla.
"I’ve always loved the whole Cyber style, and super futuristic concepts of cars.
Does everyone’s taste in absolutely everything have to change through their life? Or are you one of those sad people who think anyone who likes something from their childhood is immature?"
more like when you draw a truck as a toddler
How's the pizza?
So that’s a no to YouTube? Have to watch on the Tesla site only?
Thanks!
Where?
Where
"You missed the best part when the 'bullet proof glass' on the truck broke to a steel ball, twice."
Works now
Hopefully the final version will have a turret to take out thresher maws.
Note that it says the $100 for the truck is fully refundable.
It says the 100$ deposit is fully refundable.
"yea I think it has to be fake, all of the videos looked like 3d renders, no interior photos, all the photos on the website are clearly renders too."
Agreed my friend. Just kinda shocked if this is a joke and they don’t correct that tonight
Says fully refundable.
"It says fully refundable, I'm looking at the order page right now"
Ok well that makes me feel better. Thanks for the info.
The $100 is fully refundable
"Yeah... But pretty common for a truck with a front bench seat. But, yeah, better for a family of 4 that occasionally needs to transport a couple more passengers."
LOL. dumbass.
Didnt learn their lesson last time?
Before or after you deflect off RPG's while riding through South Central Baghdad?
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Aheago wrap
"Newer f250s are pretty up there. I was hoping for 20,000lbs. 
We have 3 F250’s and almost daily are towing Minimum of 14,000. 4yrd dump trailer(5500) and a skid steer (6-9000 spending on brand and size)"
"It is. F250 is 12,300-15,000lb."
Between 150 and 250.
"Drag, not weight is what will kill range."
"Confirmations come like a day or two later. It was like that for my Y, just last month."
If you buy early. Laggards get the norm-obile
Maybe expensive to curve rocket-grade stainless
"I honestly couldn’t agree more. No lack of love for my Colorado, but I would certainly love to get behind the wheel of this truck to try it out. Really I’d love to throw a trailer on and see how it drives while towing."
"That would be the super choppy mess, I'm guessing."
I wonder if the choppiness is related to starting the stream over 9 hours before the drop? Any small memory leak in the streaming software is going to be a problem after 9 hours.
I’m betting their internet service provider throttles YouTube. Watched it on PC and it wasn’t choppy at all. They could also have a older device.
"Yeah. I wonder if Tesla will change the look, it’s pretty angular and I’m not sure if it will fit in with the other Tesla line up, being the other cars are so sleek and have flowing curves to them."
Looks so much better
"Honestly though, between that and paint, it probably saved them a lot of money. It also makes the windshield cheaper since it has no curvature which can double or triple the cost."
"How do production costs “come down considerably” though? 

They’ve spent millions upon millions developing this truck and it’s only an extremely small fraction of people who would ever want this. I just can’t imagine selling a few thousand 50k trucks will even come close to covering the cost of development"
I never thought this statment would become something I'd agree with.
"Several? Besides the Ridgeline, which others?"
I'm no truck drive but side loading is a thing? Why not use the big ass opening made for loading stuff? People complain about the weirdest things.
"A ton of typical trucks, like mine, have a canopy on permanently. Inconvenient for carrying firewood but its never stopped me from doing truck stuff."
Can’t this be easily solved with a custom toolbox?
Every truck I've ever had has had a topper on it so the back end doesn't fill up with leaves and keeps my stuff dry and secure.
"https://youtu.be/464puoD09dM?t=451  
There's this is - is there an official Tesla version on YT?"
"Jaws of life cut through pillars, so they shouldn't have trouble cutting through this, no?"
"Sure, sure, sure, but with more flexible metal wouldn't that decrease injury in an accident by a certain, possibly significant, percentage?"
The glass? That's weird... Would that be enough of a crumple zone? I don't know much about it.
That sounds kinda retarded i'd like a more detailed explanation
He probably should have demonstrated that versus how strong the glass was or wasn’t.
The movie is supposed to be in takes place 2 years before it's released. It will already be outdated
"Sure, but why does it look like a pop culture reference from 30+ years ago?"
imagine totaling the shit out of somebody's car and being like https://giphy.com/gifs/BxWTWalKTUAdq
"Doesn’t get easier than this. 

Testla has always looked like the GTA 5 knock off version of a real vehicle. The tech is great, but the rest is rushed and half assed (design, build quality)."
Yeah the rivian looks great and is sort of what I was expecting out of Tesla. Not this pile of shit.
"I would definitely be more interested in the Rivian than this.

I think they shouldn't have called it a pickup. Make up a new name/category for something with such distinct looks."
">No more oil changes, spark plugs, coils, gaskets, coolant changes.

This is essentially the reason why I want a Tesla so bad. Just drive the damn thing. It's so convenient."
You know Ford's going to have an electric F150 out before this one right?
"I dont get all the hate. Its different sure, but I kinda like it. Especially the headlights."
"Tesla short Twitter would tell you they need the cash and hype to sustain their Ponzi scheme

More orders needed to raise capital?"
"I’m talking well under, with no incentives."
the only way I’ll buy tbh
"I hadn't heard about GM. Not against the Rivian either, although I would like a longer bed."
"Ford F-150 is due for a complete redesign from the ground up. Current model dates back to 2015. I would anticipate that the next gen F-150 will be designed from the ground up to maximize BEV component integration, and still offer ICE versions for the masses. Will the looks change radically? Nope. Ford will maintain design language of heritage trucks into the future... its their bread and butter. If the F-150 fails, so does all of Ford."
"Exactly what I was thinking.

Also, it looks freaking horrible"
I just wanna look like I’m driving an old school halo warthog
Why does this idea of a utility truck make you think he knows other things that he’s not sharing? I’m not connecting dots
"There's such a thing as too much horn talk and a fella ought to be aware of it.

📷"
and they should all play la cucaracha!
Yeah me too. I can’t believe he didn’t wave another truck onto the stage. What a strange decision to do that live without many tests first...
"Agreed, others trucks look obsolete and ugly compared to it."
"To each they own, I guess..."
"i'm pretty sure, yeah. Can't believe both ones broke."
[deleted]
Yeah
And not a single Tesla owner dings doors? Yeah. Now imagine that in this thing.
cyberballs
Stainless steel nuts are the best nuts!
legit snort-laughed
Cybertruck nuts
Tbf Elon's always a lil uncomfortable
He couldn’t stop looking back at the glass.
Who wouldn’t be uncomfortable
That’s gotta be a confidence killer
"Yeah it seemed like it really threw him off his groove. I can only imagine they had planned to show off the interior, explain aerodynamics, etc but he just wanted to get off the stage after that."
It’s really hard when Elon is uncomfortable because he isn’t exactly smooth in public.
same thing here
you and I both!
"Agreed. I don't like the vanilla cookie cutter design of modern American trucks, regardless of manufacturer. I like the fact that this gives me that mass market functionality (and then some) while looking completely different from the norm.

It's like a JLTV and a Lamborghini had a baby and that baby is affordable and street legal."
Might even be early 2022 but i can wait. I reserved my model 3 on the first day and have not regretted anything about that car. This new beast looks like it will be lots of fun!
"I like the look. That said, with the quad in its bed, it looks like one of my childhood drawings of a Lamborghini Countach in gray."
I think that’s probably the most accurate description that could be made.
"I was thinking a delorean, and those first gen hummers. 

This gives me OG hummer vibes."
"I'm impressed as well

At least I was until they threw a steel ball at the windows."
The irony here is that I like both of those vehicles...but not run through a blender
Same. Good to see Tesla isn't afraid to try something new.
"The only way I could possibly understand someone saying they find this as a good thing, would be if that person owned stock in Tesla. Which I'm sure isn't uncommon around these parts."
">This thing is just pure function

So with my current truck I can just reach over the bedside and grab the tools I toss in there. I can also tow a fifth wheel trailer. Not sure how those are supposed to work with this."
"Absolutely that's who this is for. People who want a truck for the 0.001% of the time they could use one. Same here. I like driving big things. I like this truck. But, I'm not going to be doing a single thing with it I couldn't do with a sedan and a trailer."
I had some hopes that they would go with something that could appeal to the truck audience and make something that doesn't only attract sales from environmentalists but could be a great truck just from a performance standpoint. When I heard the name 'Cybertruck' a while back I knew there was no point hoping that lol.
"You are right this is just a ""first look"", and we don't know much. Hopefully they did address all those things I mentioned. But, if anything, it's important to get these questions out there to get answers.

I really don't think the looks exude ""utility"" as you say. It says ""cheap manufacturing"" to me. A truck is a pretty simple machine, that's pretty utilitarian.

And true, most F150 owners never do any of the stuff I mentioned. But, never underestimate the selling power of ""but if I wanted to I could!"". See: Ford Raptor, any track-derived road car, or the G-Wagon with portal axles."
"Sortof? The original H1 was built to go anywhere do anything, and be converted in all the ways I said and more.

If anything, is shares the trait of being ugly as sin, and a middle finger to the status quo.

If Schwarzenegger buys one of these...."
I figured the atv was going to be the truck... this means the glass broke for real too lol
Tesla.com/cybertruck
That was hardly a race.
"I agree.

I remember all the tears when the X and 3 were announced. The only thing that holds the X back is the high price; it's really out of the market for average households."
Yeah I lost control of my bowels thinking about how this thing will look in matte black wrap. This pre-order felt sooooooo good.
I honestly don't think he can appeal to the average truck owner because it's electric. It's only when they are forced to move to EV. Telsa already started that wave.
Haha good point. What a stupid risk to take. Amateur hour.
He shouldn’t stop pelting the car to be honest
Losing your mind. Loosing is not a word.
"""boomer truck"" ?"
[deleted]
After the unveil the rivian is clearly the best truck out there.
It looks great to me. People have different tastes.
This is truly the ugliest vehicle I have ever seen.
"> And he literally said he was trying to out F-150 the F-150.

Notice that he did, in performance. As for design and marketing, he clearly out-Deloreaned the Delorean. This thing is a dream come true for more people than Tesla Motors can reasonably service, considering their production scale. 

> So many Tesla fans think Elon is infallible and will follow him blindly off a cliff

You mean it'll sell like hot cakes? You're incoherent."
"There was a tweet where he said it wouldn’t appeal to everyone.  They’re not going to make many of them.

I was really hoping to like it, but I was hoping for something more like the Santa Cruz concept.  It doesn’t matter anyway because I’m not interested in a truck: all those features are cool that they exist but not what I’m looking for.

I’ll be very interested in something like the Model Y next time I’m looking for a car"
Agreed
Exactlyyyy
"> haul a fukin fridge in it, or a bucket of mulch, take it to a job site, or run it in the mud. this fucking thing makes NO sense whats so ever.

I don't understand why you wouldn't be able to do that with this truck?"
"Yeah. We get it, you want to make it known that it doesn't appeal to you, this is why you're making this crazy prediction. But come on, look at the comments. There's a ton of potential buyers – less than haters, but *the decision to buy is not a product of average reaction*. Look at hackernews:  

> As a truck guy who has owned a lot of trucks and currently owns a 2017 Ram 2500 CTD 4x4 and a Land Rover Defender 110, I'm telling you right now: this is going to kill it. This is the suburban status item of 2022. I want to buy this right now. This has nearly the towing capacity of my Ram and will smoke my wife's Audi on the track.

> It's just so outrageously different, offers the functionality of both a truck and the tech and performance of a Tesla, and isn't comparable with other 'trucks' which I'd argue are homogeneous in nature, cliche, particularly un-aesthetically pleasing and are synonymous with gas-guzzling North American indulgence.

> As the current owner of a 2017 F150 long bed 4x4 with an ARE bed cap, I'm super-tempted by the Tesla. It's a total no-brainer for the people buying things like the Honda Ridgeline. It's less so for people who treat their truck like a work vehicle. Frankly, I don't think will cannibalize the existing P/U market as much as it will sway more people away from SUVs into [Cyber]trucks, especially if the back seat is as spacious as a normal full size truck's.

etc. 

Making a new truck that follows the mainstream formula is essentially pointless, this market is saturated as is. A reasonable ""Tesla Model Truck"" would have just received some nods of approval and sold below Model X. He's got to stir up shit with a complete departure from common sense."
"People hate anything new and people love to cheer somebody going down, like the glass breaking. Have you ever seen a car launch? Incredibly boring and a German VP droning on for 30 minutes how important the Golf is with a thick accent, without showing the car and then some people dance for some reason, is much worse than Elon's style. This was awesome.

Most people are jaded and bitter, especially people typing things out on the internet instead of living life.

Let's just wait and see."
"yeah i had kinda forgot about them, with the investment they have been getting and doing some research on the vehicles the SUV and the Truck should do very well, not to mention there 100,000 delivery vehicle order from amazon."
"Uh....apples designs are amazing and one of the best ...that's how it's gotten such an strong brand value. 

Insanely good quality design builds...

This truck is no where near something apple would design....I don't even think a human designed this."
"Nor does being a ""good ole days"" loving traditionalist. Progress. Embrace the future."
"Are even 20% of trucks produced really used as pickup trucks? Genuine question. I've no idea what the answer is.

No one I know of with a pickup truck actually uses them for any sort of work. Now admittedly I don't know many people in the construction industry, but I do know a few people with pickups."
"Eh... If *anything*, it's exclusively practical...

Like, pure function over form.

Those stats and a price starting under $40k are ***insane***!

110v *and* 220v?!  Plug into the suspension compressor for pneumatic tools?! That towing and payload capacity?!

It's **extremely** practical..."
"> Because it's not practical as a pickup truck.

Why? The bed look very spacious, and didn't appear to have cut outs for wheel arches etc. What practical application does a pickup need that this doesn't have?"
Our cell phones are mimicking sci fi.. our lasik eye surgery is mimicking sci fi.  We have tons of already everyday items mimicking scifi.  Now your vehicle overlord makes a truck you dont enjoy and it's stupid?  Hahahah

That’s why he usually starts half an hour late. So he can rehearse.
Thank you!! We didn’t even see the bed of the truck until most of the way through the presentation!
I am a millennial.
 the back 1/4 of the bed lifts up for under bed storage so i dont think it would stay sealed / water proof with liner material on it even if you sprayed it separately.
"This fits my idea of having a mobile datacenter, this truck is perfect."
"The breakover angle on this will not have it being competitive in the 4x4 market against vehicles with decades of aftermarket support. Which is a shame, because electric engines into a portal axle configuration could feasibly give unparalleled ground clearance. I don’t want to bash the truck all over this thread, but I really think they missed the mark with this design. They didn’t play to any strengths that an EV could have. They built a truck for mall crawlers and bro dozers and missed any feature that someone who owns a pickup for work needs."
"So, they're targeting a market that's, what, 1/100th the size?"
That's not how it has been built up.
"It kind of does, that is what truck people want."
Yeah the people who need to do actual work should wait 7 years for rev2 to fix all their issues. /s
"Exactly, look at the OG iphone unveil, people were going bonkers. 

&#x200B;

The immediate reaction to this presentation is to cringe and then proceed to vomit."
"None of these thing where loved. They where mocked and seen as niche products. Then everybody followed, because they where all innovative ideas that captured the market. 

Will the truck be the same?  Maybe, it has the specs. But its something you need to see for yourselves. This is exactly the same backlash the Y got."
bro that thing would get forklifted into a dumpster
Which is as far as the concept should have gone. IMO it should be aesthetically consistent with the rest of the lineup in order to built on the current success. Tesla's design loses all of that.
But the cyber truck bed is small. Many people want 8ft bed not 6ft.
"Traditional looking EVs sell good, see: literally every Tesla car"
"If it's following a [monocoque](http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/Images/monocoque_first_carbon_mclaren_mp4_1.jpg)  type frame, you can still add more surfaces."

Yea thats what i am thinking. He didn't even show the camping mode which looks so fucking cool.
"He whispered ""Oh my fucking God."" when it broke for the first time."

">	drop the ball 

Too soon."
"I don't think so, but it's a fair question. Elon began every other vehicle unveiling by talking about safety. He didn't say a word about it tonight."
Don't say 'ball'!
"After tonight, anything is possible"
"You may be right, but an extremely hard “exoskeleton” sounds like the last thing you want when it comes to a collision. I hope it does have that Tesla-tier safety rating, but I don’t know how they would pull it off without the same crumple zones the S, 3, and X have with the frunk. I’m not going to make any conclusions about it’s safety ratings, I’m really just worried."
Compare it to modern pickup trucks. Easy Google I promise
same here ...
"yes, I don’t believe he was expecting to stand infront of that for his big reveal"
"Oh yeah, some are.  Most think it's a joke and ugly as hell though.  Because it is."
absolutely. leads me to believe that the whole purpose of this was just to reveal specs
I mean... If I were a multi millionare I would buy this in an instant just to have the truck but most want something that looks pratical. Personally I like it but does not look like something that would fit on the road.
Agreed. I liked so many of the sneak-peek-spy-mock-ups more. Maybe they will update before mass production? I'm wondering if it only comes in stainless steel finish.
Or be repaired...
**NY state**: Hold my beer.
Before lol
[Kind of like this guy?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Garry_Hoy)
"> passenger and driver side windows to shatter

Shatter being the key word. This was laminated glass that *didn't* shatter, so it was a failure either way you look at it."
"I mean, we are the customers, I’m not seeing a lot of positive feedback for this one but Elon is literally a genius so what do I know"
Counter point: PT Cruiser.
F U C K
This has to be planned... I recall Elon himself admitted to going for the SEXY lineup at a minimum. This doesn't seem like much of a stretch...
He said “with”. It would probably demolish anything it hit.
And it has sharp-ish edges
"Three quick reasons:

Weight - guessing its 8000lbs+

Sharp edges - combined with substantially harder material

Exoskeleton - a fundamentally different “frame” than anything out on the road right now. Super interested to see how the differences pair in a collision."
I think he meant about being on the receiving end
I think they mean they'd hate to be the other car.
I think he means the other car
I think he meant hitting one and/or being hit by one.
"I think he doesn’t want to be the other vehicle in an accident because in the demo they hit it with a sledgehammer and the truck seemed to not care at all. 

But I agree, presumably the front end will be designed differently. I don’t know if there still are regulations around this but at some point I read about how the 4Runners front end was modified to be friendlier when impacting pedestrians, if the front end was like the door on this thing it would just cut pedestrians in half."
RemindMe! 4 years
"I think the idea is that the suspension lowers the truck so you can reach in.

Also the motortrend article mentions it has side steps in the rear door"
"Based in test drive videos, it looks like you can get back there, especially with lowered suspension. Its also still prototype phase so they will likely tweak from here on out and may already have plans for other things. Model 3 trunk for example got improvements after reveal."
"You can for half the truck, just not at the very front maybe, as if that's the only thing that makes a truck functional."
I don't know anything about trucks but what if they made side doors in de back for the final version?
"Exactly as someone who actually uses his truck and the bed, this cybertruck is an epic fail.  It’s a fucking mall crawler.  Gtfo that any contractor is gonna have one of these..."
"It's a little built around the function of cost.. but some of the decisions don't make sense. The aero has got to be terrible. Unless there's some sort of wacky active airflow management going on, but it seems like that would negate any cost savings from the simple shapes."
"What? Aero is definitely not bad, you don't get that milage at that cost with bad aero. You can't possibly have any idea of visibility when you haven't been inside it, and it has so many cameras that it's easy to overcome any blindspots. You can easily hoist stuff into the bed, you just need to hoist a foot or two higher at the beginning of the bed. You are completely ignoring the suspention which automatically lowers the bed for loading, built in ramp, power and AIR... not built around function? This thing IS function."
Most trucks are for people who don’t use trucks.
"Same bed length as the standard f-150: 6.5'

Longer bed than a Tacoma. More functional than a Tacoma too - and at Tacoma prices."
"At least the the 49s are fantastic this season, makes it worth it"
I think they just added 5 mins to the countdown
"Oh, ty, I had to turn it off out of absolute disgust, but i'm glad i was wrong about that."
Isis should love it
Well not now I'm not.  Can't believe that's the real thing.  M3 owner.  No chance I'm buying this.
You'd think he'd get better but I think this is worse than the model y event
Agreed with both of you
Looks good to me like a stealth fighter
"I hope I'm wrong but I think this design is ahead of its time. They could have achieved all of those features with something that doesn't look like, well, that."
I'll be rubbing pennies to make nickels until them lol
Just the one I had in my mind. Well observed.
"He joked about fixing it in post, as though it were a scene in a movie."
The glass in the truck is fixed much more in place so it can't flex to absorb impact. They really ought to have tested this before the demo lol.
"Wasn't a performer, that's Franz who's Tesla's head designer and Elon's old roommate."
He shouldn't have pumped *slap* himself up
Oof
Do you know if Tesla will let you change the base model selection in a reservation down the line? I.e. 300 mile to 500 mile model. Not sure if they allowed in other models
"Bet that’s a way to get faithful Tesla fans to order first. Then the new design releases and the preorder price goes back to 1K.

I can dream, right?"
"Totally agree.  If they released a 500 mile S or X at 70k those would sell like mad.  

I would consider a more “normal” looking truck if they release one.  Though as a truck owner I’m a little surprised they didn’t demo the bed of the truck more.   I’m confused on how I would access the side of the truck bed, which is something I do every time I put something in the back.  IE - to strap something down or through debris in from the side."
Yes exactly! It even has autopilot
"Gotcha, that makes more sense now."

"Well as in, closer to the date are you tasked with finding a loan. Can you pay into it over the time.. etc"
"There are a lot of jurisdictions where legal requirements for mirrors haven't caught up with technology.  In the US, there will almost certainly be pieces of silvered glass stuck on the sides."
"I can't fit a proper toolbox into the bed of this truck, so it's a nonstarter."
this post smacks of painful experience
"You're right, if you can't say the word 'no' for some reason."
Until they don't.
I'm with him
It's definitely out there.
"2 / 1,000,000 I liked it too"
Why not?  Seems like you could drive around with the bed cover in the retracted position.
"You are looking for a car, not a truck. You are looking for something out of the ordinary. This truck definitely is. It is easy, as Tesla fan to love it, I'm just worried people outside won't like it as much. Again, I'd be happy to be proven wrong."
"Model 3 looks about 100 times better than this Truck IMO. Again though, it's all about taste. Our family has never owned a truck but we were very likely to put a deposit down because of the utility it would bring, specs, being an EV etc. The look of this just put us right off though. I would rather save my money and wait to see what else comes out in a few years time. In two years time the specs of a 2021/22 Model 3 performance would of changed to likely be better than the Cybertruck."
"Utility is a good argument, but saying form don't matter is kind of a stretch..."
"Same, I like the look of the truck more every time I see it. By the end of the release, I was really liking it. And did you see that roll away bed cover!!"
"Yep, not good for passengers or pedestrians. I have a feeling the design is going to change significantly before all is said and done."
How easy or hard is going to repair a dent if it does get one though. Current car metal can be repaired in an hour with glue.
"the demonstration to the side of the stage on just the glass panes was quite impressive, obviously something with the glass in that prototype truck wasn't up to snuff, but it is what it is. they'll make it better.

someone else in this post was saying 'why not just test it in the lab then show a video, duh!' - but i think this only makes sense if you ignore what Elon has said about his views on advertising / marketing. He has said that he hates the way so many ads are meant to mislead the customer or how things are sold with claims that are really only reflective of a lab environment and not what a product will actually do in the customers hands in real life. I dunno, i just think 'just film it in the lab and play the video' is sort of the antithesis of how he thinks about these things."
"> this truck is inflammatory on purpose to get people to choose sides while talking about how much they either hate or don't understand the hate.

Youre14andyouaresmart. Fuck outta here."
"
>But anyone that needs a real work truck or wants to go off-roading will not be interested in getting this IMO.

Dude, I wish I could afford one and I do a lot more than  your hypothetical city person with my Dakota.  
Not everyone who works a truck regularly needs an F250 and an 8 foot bed.  
The Cybertrck has a front trunk, which would get my tools out of the bed and give me even more space for lumber, sheet metal, car parts, all sorts of stuff.  
   
As to off roading, why wouldn't anyone offroading want hundreds of footpounds of torque from takeoff, a flat bottom, and an air adjustable 16 inches of ground clearance? I mean, it's not something to build a monster truck or a serious crawler out of, but most offroaders don't have those to begin with."
"So so so sad this thing is so god awful. I never thought I’d dislike a car more than an Aztec. Congrats, Tesla you did it. I was really hoping it’d be like some of the renders, would have definitely considered one."
Agree. Huge missed opportunity here.
"I’m with you about wanting a truck to be utilitarian and I do think it’s awesome the tough exoskeleton.

But honestly, could you imagine trying to haul a mattress or a sofa in a bed that size? What about using it for work? It has one entry point into the bed. 

It’s not very functional as a work truck and the bed is too small for large item hauls. I’m not saying the truck isn’t cool, it’s very cool. I’m just saying it’s not very functional for truck specific purposes (other than off roading)."
"I don’t see how this is that useful in hauling things either. At least not big things which is when you need a truck. 

A bed that size can’t haul a mattress or a sofa, there’s no tie off points to haul something like a ladder. 

It seems this truck would be marginally better than an SUV with a third row that folds down."
It's amazingly hilarious to watch this.
"I mean, the longest bed in a crew cab F150 is 6.5’, and like 80-90% of crew cab F150s only have a 5.5’ bed. So that ain’t bad."
What am I supposed to strap two trucks together to haul sheet goods? Yeah I don’t think so.
And put 25 sheets of plywood on it and protect it from Florida rain?  Try again
Honesty I’ll just wait until these are on the road and I’ll buy a totaled one to build a custom body for. It will take longer but I’ll get what I want.
"Except you can't fit a ladder rack to this thing, so uh .."
That’s what one image showed.
"Agreed. But tesla could have solved this since the air suspension can drop (like they did for loading the atv), if those damn sail panels weren’t there lol."
"oh, that’s good to hear! I didn’t have a problem with any other part of the design, so I really hope that’s true."
Anyone with a reasonable expectation of being shot at because I’m pretty sure that’s the cheapest “armored” car out there
I hated it when it came out but now love it. I think that once people get over the shock they will grow to like it.
Lol autocorrect monstrosity
"I once saw an electric truck targeted at oil field workers. You could pressure wash the cabin and there was a hook on the roof for a winch to switch out the center-mounted motor if needed.  
  
Also had an emergency full-vehicle fire extinguisher accessible both from the outside and inside.  
  
Edit: this thing. Ugly but packed with features. Industry might actually like the Cybertruck.

"No contractor will buy this for utility and, unless you have money to blow, utility is your primary decision driver when buying a truck for your business."
">  A construction-worker/contractor would vastly prefer this over the competitors on durability and reliability alone.

Haha."
Durability and reliability alone... WHAT?
"That’s a bed tent. Like the Pontiac Aztec had. I mean like a hard shell one that you can store work equipment in.  

You’re exactly right, it’s like the Ridgeline, my best friend has one, and it’s a bitch to load and unload in.  Maybe they will have a design update without the fairings after some feedback."
"You’re right I didn’t even notice the tonneau cover, my bad.  

I guess my biggest gripe is that if you want to get stuff out you have to climb into the bed every time unless it’s near the bed gate. I’m sure they will come out with add ons for all the stuff I mentioned too, it’s just really not the best bed design imo. The other 3/4s are decent, I just ain’t one for the fairings."
"6.5' is fine. Many people (myself included) get by on 5.5'. Only contractors really want an 8' bed and that's not the target here. 

The angled bed rails make the bed stupid, not the 6.5'"
And it’s almost 2020. Lol
I would get buried alive showing up to a job site in that. The blind spots those body lines made look extremely unpractical as well.
"So your saying it's not actually your primary vehicle. A lot of guys that need it for work can't afford multiple cars, and buying a cheap/unreliable truck your livelihood depends on isn't an option"
Inb4 Elon cocaine scandal
Yea cut off right after the pricing for me I had to find another video to see the ATV haha
"It's not going to look good in a suburban driveway, where 90 percent of trucks live"
Knight XV has been dropped as my apocalypse vehicle lol
I mean what was the team thinking when they decided to make an electric car am I right? Yea it’s totally different but spec wise it’s got what I assume people who buy pick ups want plus more. I guess looks matter that much to people lol. No one in NYC daily drives a pick up truck so yea when people say pick ups are some of the highest selling vehicles they lose me since I rarely see them unless they’re a business vehicle lol

"Beast isn't the first, second, third, or ninety-ninth word that comes to mind. Looks like an awkward triangle with a couple of balls dangling beneath."
It seems like their other vehicles have. I'd love for this thing to look just like their Tractor only smaller. I'd pre-order.
"That's one of the aspects I was referring to. Milage, power, and price. Too bad it looks terrible. I'm not even saying futuristic is bad, but this is bad."
"Okay, well luckily for you every other truck on the road looks almost exactly the same."
Maybe the mileage sure. But as far as the power you can.
Rounding out some of the hard edges and adding some paint would make it look _way_ more conventional without any major fundamental change.
It pulled a “million” pounds on rails. That’s not really pulling a million pounds. Nothing like pulling the same weight on pavement.
Pulling capacity for the Cybertruck said infinite in his presentation lol
Photoshopped
Fan-Art.
They should have rounded the edges just a little bit and it would probably have looked better.
"My thoughts exactly. Weld in the rear doors, chop the excess roof and sides, shorten the wheel base while getting an 8 ft bed.  There are some good qualities to what was presented but I won’t buy it as presented."
"No doubt. I can't believe they didn't test throw the balls and knew the outcome. 

So the question is ""why"". Is this some type of distraction from the useless design of the angled be rails?"
"I think you're right about the rear overhang, it does look smaller than I initially thought, which is great."
The live event looked like a bad movie prop
"Yes, they’re hilarious to go back and read because they’re SO SURE and they were SO WRONG."
Of course. People were laughing that it didn't have a stylus and that it was $500
Oh yes indeed.
Honestly they say it about every iPhone launch too.
"My buddy who wanted this to replace his Ram hates the Rivian design, too, for some reason.

I personally like it, though. Just not in the market for a truck."
"Yeah, the future of the 80's."

"Honest question, what's impractical about it?"
Ok boomer
"Idk what your source of info is, but from what I've read, truck enthusiasts are super excited"
"Maybe, and I hope so. I’m not a truck person so I wasnt the intended market anyway. Like I said in another comment,  I love everything but the design and the windows lol"
"Gas and maintenance, especially for fleet vehicles"
"I just bought a small 5 acre farm and I own a small WISP, this would be sooo fucking perfect for my needs its not even funny."
I drew something similar when I was five years old. Can I have a job at Tesla?
"Stans. 

Honestly I don’t see how the general public would actually accept and buy this. I’m sure there are a thousand reasons why this design is “perfect”, a “masterpiece of engineering” and just all around aerodynamic as hell. 

But will the public buy this? Will the demographic for pickup owners buy this over the new ford electric?

This design is far too radical, and in a very negative way."
Something is crashing the order site.  Must be the 1%.
They do say it looks outdated now. Model s and model x has looked them same on the outside for years and it is being said. I don’t care but haters has said it.
"There's nothing masculine about this design. Tough, yes. Out-of-this-world, yes. But not masculine."
"That's how the Yugo came about...and the Smart car.

I still hope to buy an electric vehicle some day...but I really hope this isn't what all future cars start looking like."
"no more like Elon has had brilliant ideas, but this one...not so much. the company is fine."
"I know a fair number of blue collar and trades people that would definitely buy an electric or hybrid truck. Most of them are right now are driving F-150s, Rams and the like, because there are no other options. they were really hoping that Tesla would be better than Rivian.

I drive a Ford Escape myself and it was bought for hauling full loads of stuff. I will get a used X or something else.  I don't buy a car for fashion, I buy it for a purpose.  this is a car with all of the bragging rights, but not practical."
"Maybe for a trip to home depot for a new lawnmower, or hauling large musical instruments. 

I don't see construction workers and farmers buying this."
"Maybe changed their minds on low volume, which could be why it'll take two years to come out."
"Depends on the person. I think it looks good, you think it looks bad. Very subjective"
He did say it’s not for everybody
"It was not. If you paid attention, this specific product was never suppose to be sold at volume. Elon mentioned this many times over the last year. A specific quote I remember was something along the lines of:

“The design won’t be for everyone. It could be our worst selling product ever”"
"That hurt. I know, I’m working on myself. Don’t shame me."
only with a 9mm from 10m though.
Like how they accounted for the unbreakable glass?
If not they have a few years to figure it out
what if you're hitting a person and not a sledgehammer? that person's getting their shit fucked up.
"I guarantee within a few weeks we’ll get a “redo” tweet from Elon with an updated test. Sure the damage is done (literally) but like what are you going to do,  not buy it because the glass breaks?

I know he claimed it’s near unbreakable, but this car is no where near production. Tons of time to figure out what went wrong."

Who did? The controversy about the nose? That’s nothing compared to this IMO.
Good luck for a general contractor carrying pipes or long pieces of lumber with a body shape like that. Trucks have stayed the same for 100 years because they just work.
"Well they tried, but it cracked the camera lens... ;)"
We’ve got a case.
Do you have a source?
Source?
when did he say this?
But... it's a Mars rover...
it would somewhat as the sloped back half of the design is a kammback which does boost efficiency.
"Not really, its just a sidepanels"
with this design they cant cover the loading area as smooth as with their design
I'd feel much safer behind a regular window
I just meant as general function truck as compared to a F-150. Am I wrong?
I would describe it as the people who put more than groceries in it or tow a jet ski. You aren’t using the truck if it’s doing something a mini van can do with a uhaul hitch welded on.
....are you joking?
"Drive to site with welder, coffee, and paint sprayer + supplies.  Drink coffee, use tools, eat lunch, use tools, throw tools back of truck to charge, then go get a beer.  Pick up roofing shingles and gravel on the way home.

Yup, this truck will never work."
"Not joking but no expert either. Happy to be educated if you are an expert. 

I’m just going on the relative stats versus a F-150. It seems to me that it is a better ‘truck’ for the things I’ve listed. Please let me know how I am mistaken."
"If the model y was available 2 months ago, I would have bought it instead of the 3 in a heartbeat"
"I thought the Model S refresh looked really weird at first, then it grew on me. Same with Model 3. But I don't think this will ever grow on me lol."
Are people going to see Sonic? lol
"the more I look at a flat roof would be all it really needs. It's will basically a futuristic ridgeline with wedge front, which is ok."
"That's what I'm thinking. The only weird part to me is the roof (which is weird as fuck, frankly) Flaten that and have a roof rack option and your good to go."
Reservation is only $100. Significantly less than their previous cars
Oh no. Elon bby what is you doing?
"Reminded me of Aladdin ""it will not break!... It broke?!?!"""
[deleted]
it is if you are playing options mate.
It’s all the sane people that can see an ugly vehicle that few will want to buy.
Seriously? The stock was priced for a truck to be released with mass appeal. Fewer potential customers = fewer cars sold = less cash flow = lower stock price. You think old people just set all the stock prices or what?
You mean the actual market for pickup trucks?
Most definitely but unfortunately side impacts are way too common
"The entire body and chassis of modern cars are designed to absorb impact in all directions. It's why we have things called crash tests.

Stainless is both harder and heavier than steel which is pretty much the opposite of what you want and the main reason I think this truck is fake. Plus, he suggested the side windows would be made of effectively bullet proof glass when that's not legal for mass-produced cars. Everything needs to be standard safety glass which is clearly what was on the truck and the reason the windows broke but didn't shatter."
You can still leave scratches.
I have no problem with futuristic looks.  I have a problem with form over function.  That 'vault' is not remotely usable for anyone who uses a truck to do work today.  That is the problem.
I hear that option is on the secret menu
"Yep and that's exactly what I can't wait to see, I'm not in the market for a pickup but I would happily jump on this with an aftermarket body."
"Look how well that turned out lol, two panels broken on stage. I'm sure it's stronger than regular glass but I doubt that had influence in it's design. Bulletproof glass has been around for years and is far thicker than this stuff and it's been able added to vehicles without a major loss in fuel efficiency. If I'm not mistaken there's even bulletproof Tesla mods and again,while there's definitely a loss in range, it wasn't anything insane."
I would have happily given up some range if it meant I'm not driving a triangle.
"Never mentioned Rivian and don’t think anyone is going to run to an unproven automaker for a fleet of trucks. 

I have a Model 3, I live in the south, and I can’t tell you the number of people, with trucks, who come up to me and ask about it. Not everyone who works with their hands hates technology or hates electric vehicles. 

For those people who can only have one car they use for their livelihood, no other Tesla could provide them what they need. 

Simultaneously, all other Tesla cars are stylish in their own way. This car is polarizing. I personally like the style, but those people looking to drop $40-50K on a work truck, their only car, are going to second guess themselves when everyone around them drives F150s."
"Yeah, the features will definitely pull some sales. It solves a lot of problems. I’m just a little disappointed the design will keep it from being a true disruptor.

It’s one of those things where if they really pulled out all the stops on utility features (not just bulletproof steel and unbreakable windows) - as in checking off everyone’s wish list and then some, I think that would transcend the design.

They just didn’t quite get to that utilitarian tipping point in my opinion."
Ha. Was watching to see what they could come up with and thinking of a crash with CYBRTRK made my Corolla shit its pants.
other angles are starting to grow on me :)
"I didn’t suggest it was going to fail like Hummer or any of that.

Inefficiency and environment weren’t the only social negatives about the Hummer. The 1990s was filled with highly inefficient vehicles, not just Hummer, yet it still got most of the flack. The fact you were driving around in a military-like vehicle on public roads that stuck out like a sore thumb at the time was a big thing and is actually still a criticism of Hummer drivers today even though it blends in more these days. I can’t see myself driving this for similar reasons. That is all."
"You know they still put the 6.0 in yukon, suburban and Tahoe with the same mpg before they switched to the 6.2 engine.   


hummer made one vehicle that also split GM sales with Cadillac, GMC and Chevy.

the market for a full size suv with 2 row or 2 row 1 seat is small and GM owns the full size SUV market.   


they made the 6.0 until 2019 i the 2500 and 3500 HD trucks. Which also filled the slot of the hummer since most people who would by a hummer would also buy a truck.   


hummer died because it did not have a market not because of the environment."

If you need a truck, but all the trucks being made are so-so, you go with what appeals the most to you out of the bland group. But if you toss in a new, radical vehicle like the CYBRTRK, the whole industry is pushed by force into a more diverse design game."

No. It's just different. Waiting for specs.
Well I guess there won't be anyone in that truck since it's so ugly.  They don't have to worry about it
It doesn't say on the site either.
Thanks

Yeah Elon’s said before that Matte is tricky and is much harder to fix if it gets scratched/damaged. Vinyl would definitely be the way to go.
Whoops missed the close up with the truck bed down. Thank ya.

"This is good to know, thanks!  I don't see the reservation options in my accounts yet (the way we had it for Model 3) but it's probably because of the load it's going through atm I'm guessing"
"TBF, I pre-ordered the model 3 and it couldn't have gone worse. I expect this to be the exact opposite."
Ah. I get it. I go spend a hundred bucks tonight and act like a baller tomorrow.
Wait did you actually try to reserve one?
"i didnt get email either, i doubt we typed wrong."
"Oh, I won't be. I won't even be able to get one probably until 2023 anyway given I'd go for the dual motor, my location and Tesla's usual delays. By that time, there will be more competition and more options to choose from."
I respect facts. and I only dislike condescending opinions with no foundation. This is going to get trolled heavily. I would settle for a hotspot. Thanks for posting.
No that’s not true
Inaccurate. New York and plenty of other states rewrite it no matter what.
"Nope. Factory I work at uses plastic rivets to attach a plate holder for states that require front and rear plates in order to meet state laws.  
There may be one where it's optional, but I've never heard of it. Every one of them I've looked at has a statute similar to this one from Ohio:  
http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/4503.21v1."
Moon ain’t no planet
The moon isn't a planet...
I’m asking because my model 3 is pretty loud road noise wise. Curious if the ultra thick glass changes it.
Probably the same one that put a trunk in the front for those small items you normally grab from the front of the box.
They will change that - I guarantee it.
Didn't every child inside us?
Good luck getting that DOT approved
"I don't know about that, but there shouldn't be a situation where the CEO thinks it won't break and then, on a global live feed, it breaks twice."
Yeah when emergency services has to break you out in a crash
Actually government agencies have been trying to get manufacturers to improve the strength of side windows for a long time. The manufacturers have pushed against it because it's more expensive.
He's not good at this. He should have been smart enough to delegate it to others. The CEO doesn't have to be the one presenting.
A lot can change in two years
"Except in actual functionality for working on things, which is kinda crucial since most of Ford's F150's go to businesses.  

Construction crews don't care about 0-60 or energy efficiency.  They need to haul plywood and drywall, which this cannot do, and they need to load things easily from all sides, which this cannot do."
"Every possible way except range, charge time, towing capacity, payload capacity, and price.  Am I missing something?

__Ford F-250__:

Range: 425 miles

Fueling time: Not really sure, probably 5 minutes max?  Smallest fuel tank is 29 gallons.

Towing Capacity: 14,000 lbs.

Payload Capacity: 4,270 lbs.

MSRP: $34,645 (including a destination charge of $1,495)

__CYBRTRK__:

Range: 250 miles

Charging time: 40 minutes or so?

Towing Capacity: 7,500 lbs.

Payload Capacity: 3,500 lbs.

Price: $39,900 (__not__ including a destination/doc fees)

Even the 0-60 time on the base Cybertruck isn't that much faster than an F-250."
"No question the numbers are awesome, just looks like a 5yr old designed the body"
"I have an f150 and was looking to replace it with a Tesla.  Unfortunately, i cant do that now with the truck looking like that.  Its not just that it looks ugly, but it stands out in a way that makes the vehicle more of a target.  Ill wait and see the ford f150 electric specs, but i have a feeling im going to have to go that route."
If you only had the top trim in hot pink people would buy the base model every time. People don't *get over* bad asthetics in cars most of the time.
if the future is ugly ass vehicles then yep it's 100% heading into the future
That video looks awesome. There were some really cool renders posted too. WIsh they would have showed off more features of the vehicle.
"Yeah, maybe if you're 8 feet tall.

There's a photo circulating of the back sagged down with the ATV in it. That would show how low the suspension can go.

You still can't reach into it."
"Why is everyone assuming ""work folks"" don't like modern aesthetics. Some don't, but some do. People will buy this."
"Well, that's not true.

They're clearly trying to market it to ""work folks"" when you say you don't need a generator and can just plug in all your power tools."
You can't reach down over the side of the bed to get anything. It's too tall and the angle is too weird.
^ truth. They won't be able to keep up with demand.
The need to not drive a pentagon on wheels.
Ok.
"Yes, US FMVSS still requires sideview mirrors. May change by the time this is ready for sale, but don't count on it."
">That my big question. Doesn't every car need side mirrors by US law?

Between the two side mirrors and the inside rear-view mirror, you're required to have 2 of the 3."
I see lots of wraps in the future

"Unless he weighs 500lbs he’s full of it.

"The original gladiator was awesome. This half assed rebirth, not so much."
"Happy cake day! The value is definitely there, especially with the price basically the same as the Model 3"
Yes but I most likely won’t have enough for it by the time it’s available. It’s very tempting though
Probably another blade runner reference
"I don't see much reason why it couldn't pull a 5th wheel trailer.  True, most of the 5th wheel trailers currently available probably won't work with the slanted bed sides, but one designed for a taller bed would.

I think you'll see trailer companies start producing trailers designed specifically for pairing with the Cybertruck, with similar design aesthetics and hookups into the truck's electric and camera systems."
Its awd?
The two upper trims have AWD. I’m sure through a software update they could mimic diff. lockers. I’m interested to see how they navigate 4WD. I think they look to Toyota’s crawl control for guidance. There’s no reason Tesla can’t develop something like that. Especially if the motors can operate independently of each other
Like 99% of truck owners then.
"Taillights are in the tailgate. Can't leave the gate down to drive.
Maybe production will have a solution but at present, there's a lot of non-usable about this."
It would seem that most (Ford 150) trucks aren't for you. https://truckbedsizes.com/f150/. Its not a solution to everybodies wishlist but what is.
I have no special issues with the angles. But from what I could see from the mounting of the ATV the truck body is so wide the angles don't come inside the bed mounting. Thus it has no impact on your inside dimensions. Now we all need a much better look at this but I don't think it is an issue.
"Exactly. Truck purchases aren’t rational. The people are buying the idea of practicality, even if they’ll never use it. This is not something that will appeal to them."
Was the opposite here. I was like.. eh.. well that's interesting. Wife gave it a big thumbs down.
"Yeah, seems like a story as old as time. Once it becomes a status symbol though, I'm picturing EVERYONE wanting one."
I have similar concerns. I wonder if the air-suspension automatically lowering when you get out would help side access.
I think they're underestimating the market for a regular electric pickup truck with the same tech that Tesla has. There are lots of guys my age (millennial) who now have money but work in the trades and would kill to have a Tesla with the functionality of a truck. I would buy a Tesla tomorrow if it made me money and drove itself.
"There’s no rear window though.

Edit: wait never mind I saw a render on the site that shows a rear window when the bed cover is down. When it’s up though you can’t see behind you."
Well design a lighter damn ball!!!
Based on the windows supposedly being unbreakable and the skin not crumpling. This thing is a death trap.
"Meh, just going to trust it.

I ordered the $50k version, but shit, 500 mile range sounds so legit. I hope I can upgrade. The terms of the pre-order agreement said something about modifying orders and price changes, though."

well there are plenty of edges for you to edge on
Oh dear god I hope so
Still. If this is just the prototype for their eventual release I am very interested in this type of vehicle. I’m also not looking to upgrade for at least 4 years so that fits right into my timeline.
I hope not! I need to drive a Mako from Mass Effect that actually handles turning at some point.
"Honestly, all cars look the like the same shit these days, its pretty boring. This is one that is actually interesting."
"I’m even talking about aside from that. I’ve thought this about presentations that went perfectly as planned. It just feels to me like the hype (lights, video, cinematic music) was dampened a little bit by his low energy/unprepared vibe."
This one wasn't even that bad. Lol. Watch IAC 2016
"The glass breaking completely derailed him, his presentation was going decent up to that point. The crowd not really feeling the design probably also hurt his energy to talk about it."
Wow this is absolutely accurate. I thought it looked similar to some video game vehicle.
More like Lisa Simpson. Homer would design something much cooler.
Why are you defending this? It is the  worst looking vehicle of this year and quite possibly the decade

"It will in the long run, once these things start driving around on Mars. People will want a mars rover in their driveway, regardless of how ""weird"" they think it looks."
"Yeah I think it’s polarizing and the criticisms are valid. It does look unfinished so I suspect it will be slightly more refined by release. Or it will at least have bumpers and mirrors by then lol

I’ve been looking for a reason to get rid of my 4Runner, and this might be it depending upon how it all shakes out."
"The thing is, the cyberpunk-appreciating crowd is pretty niche, isn't it?"
"Totally agree it looks incomplete. The final version will resemble this, but it will look slightly different."
You are not alone. You only have to glance at the feedback in this thread to see - and this is a Tesla sub. The general public is not going to be as forgiving I suspect.
It keeps growing on me. That first look though...
You could be alright - and I think you already are :-)
"Well there were a whole host of factors working against DeLorean that are not present with Tesla.  They have very successful other lines, and I doubt Elon's going to be trying to traffic briefcases full of cocaine any time soon.

Police shouldn't be hiding in plain sight, one of my biggest gripes with law enforcement."
"Level 2 charging gives you about 24 miles for each hour it’s charging, so it all really depends on how much they drive it but around 6 hours is probably right."
This. I have several LEO friends. All of their departments have at least 1 Tesla. The biggest problem they have are people forgetting to plug them in or not enough time between shifts for a decent charge.
Well it's much better than the cars they have already. It's not like normal cars are bulletproof at all.

"There are already pilot programs with Teslas being used as police vehicles , they have all the electronics installed and work fine. Teslas and electric cars in general just don't use a ton of power idling with climate control on. Normal owners going camping with their car and have climate control on all night and lose a small chunk of range per night, so it makes sense."
"Lucky for you I sat in my Honda clarity PHEV with the ac running for a half hour in the middle of summer. Range dropped from 43 miles to 38 miles after 30 minutes.  That was with AC running full blast. 

So idk, maybe 10 miles of range lost per hour is worst case when idling?"
"Yet. Not pressurized yet.

It’s literally made out of the same thing as starship. You don’t think they couldn’t pressurize that?"
"Their initial concept art for a mini Semi just made so much sense, Semi-esque cab on frame with plenty room for nonsense in the back like a bed big enough to hold an entire car (or pickup)"
">built in bed shell,

This is the problem with the truck I'm getting at, it's lack of versatility when it comes to its cargo area... It's but into the structure of the cabin like a passage vehicle. Think about all the work vehicles that have heavily customized beds, racks or heavy equipment that use this space on traditional pickups."
"Yeah, my friends with land cruisers bring like 160L of gas with them when they go offroading. Curious to see how capable for hard rides this thing is. If you run out, are you out? Can it charge off solar?"
"If the sides are removable it'd go a long way toward making it look like a truck.

Got a pic?"
"Thats not a good thing. I already have winter tires in my garage, dont want removable bullshit and I don't give a fuck about minimal aero advantage in a pickup truck."
The aero on this is going to be bloody awful. It's going to have boundary layer separation EVERYWHERE.
There is no chance this has better aero. The F117 had awful aerodynamics because of its sharp lines which are exactly what you don't want. The only advantage this thing has is the flat underbody and lower ride height.
But there's a chance they'll be calling it CyberEdsel.
People that buy trucks to actually use them can.
"I miss the old style of light duty pickups.  They call them compact pickups now, but who even sells them?  All the trucks available today are obese, packing on at least an extra 700 kg."
A volvo truck would look better.
"Think construction workers.  And farmers. Two main job occupations that use trucks for tools, materials, livestock.  This type of truck is for people who don't need a truck.  Sounds like it has a massive towing capacity, maybe useful for hauling a camper or a boat of some sort?"
You mean the person you hit? Guess they should’ve bought a badass cybertruck.
"Oh no shit? Maybe call their team of US automobile engineers and let them know bc theres nooooo way they thought of that.

"Yea, I think that’s why the Ridgeline now longer is shaped like a ridge line."
"People like to *say* they like change, but when confronted with real change, they usually take a step back."
I think people expected it to look like a Tesla.
"I think people will probably come round to this.  There's certainly a degree of shock in how radical it is, but I suspect the initial ""it's ugly"" shrieking will die away pretty fast.

More generally, I'd love to see more car companies bringing their concept cars to market closer to the initial design."
"I don't think you know what the word ""objective"" means. Aesthetics are the very definition of subjective."
I do like the front end but man they really fucked the rest of it
It seems to look better in motion..
"Subjectively ugly. Some people here love it, so it can't be objectively ugly."
"That's an oxymoron.  

I think it's far more attractive than most (probably all) current trucks."
"Nope, I have no particular interest in Tesla per se.  I do like this design, though."
"They made a big show of how many people got out of it.

I really wanted to see them shoving some stack of plywood or sheetrock into the back."

Then you shouldn’t be buying a utility truck. Specs are what matters in terms of actual work done. This ain’t a go to Starbucks and the mall truck....
That's your problem. Those who run companies care far more about cost and performance. And that guarantees this will sell.

"Exactly! And I understand the similarities in newer designs were because of aerodynamics, but I’m excited to see something that shakes things up."

The stainless steel construction helps with the flux dispersal.
"A Coupe Utility traditionally had an attached tray, as I mentioned. They were created as something more stylish than a Pickup Truck, but with the utility of an open tray.

The use of the term Ute only started being applied to Pickup Trucks in Australia in the last 20 years. It was pure marketting to target vehicles from the global market in Australia.

A Subaru Brumby (AKA BRAT) is a coupé utility.
A Holden Crewman is a Pickup.

That said, marketting does drive changes in language. If Tesla want to call the CyberTruck a Truck, even though it doesn’t have a detached Tray, that is up to them."
It's just a tribute...someone should have really stepped up and tell him no at least on that part of the truck.
"Exactly. I live out in the country and ride a fair amount. We occasionally ride state land trails (respectfully), and would love to not be able to be heard and run into cops or DEC. Also would be great for hunting season."

It’s a shame too! They had such good momentum these past few days. I know Elon Musk has fans but he still runs a business with a lot of supporters there too.
"Yeah, I may depending on how it looks tomorrow. I don’t know how he can get up there and present like that. Especially with people yelling and shouting at him. They really need someone who specializes in presentations. I wish they could get Johnny Ive to join them."
Yeah I was going to put down $30k on a model 3 to get some low payments but now I don’t know anymore.
You can make any number of shapes with flat panels
"Elon is good but too frank and casual. It looks as he comes on stage and shares facts and opinions, with no proper scripted rehearsal or atleast a plan in place."
"Elon always said, Tesla 'cyberpunk' truck and roadster both are novelty products. Not trying to appeal the masses. Just putting out something for the brand. A unique one. Money is on model Y. Truck is literally 1. His dream project and 2. Something only a select have the courage and audacity to drive. Not for everyone."
"You know that's what I'm saying. Tesla fans had it so hyped up. No matter what elon showcased, around 40% of fans would've hated it. Because no base to imagination.

Looking at it from a fresh perspective WITHOUT looking at the presentation (which was horrible) it looks good.

Do yourself a favour and show the we page to someone you know who is not a car fanatic or a tesla fan boy. You'll know what I am talking about."
Well...I’m that too lol
How much?
"> And so expensive. Lol.

Tesla Model X is expensive, but people have been buying them up where I live."
I guess this is going to be a case of paying extra for form.
I think it'd look good in matte black. What do you think?
Until they see how cheap it is to tow their bales of hay... or bar-lay. Provided the distance is there.
"I know they have the contract with amazon for the delivery trucks, so those will definitely get made, but when is the first pickup supposed to roll off the factory floor for Rivian?"
"Relevant nickname. 

Jokes aside though, personally i didnt mind the design within like 3 min. Back end looks weird still, but front is fine."
It is weirdly growing on me. And I was laughing out loud when it first rolled up.
"Yep, just did.  It’s nice they lowered it to $100."
"If your captors offered you a driving experience that was faster, cheaper to run/maintain, sexier, and overall more fun, you might start falling in love with ‘em too.  No shame."
"Exactly.  Power/efficiency of an electric car, versatility of a truck, rugged off roading capes of an old school wrangler, military-style survivability and toughness.  This is going to be wildly popular."
So this is not a model release but a prototype showing.
Somebody else deep in the comments mentioned the pre-order is cheap and refundable. Could be an easy way to gauge demand.
Somebody else mentioned the payment is refundable. Could be a marketing strategy to gauge interest.
For real. I don't own any stock but I was shaking my head in confusion so I can understand their feelings. Rivian's truck is pretty and already driving on the street.
"Indeed.

He also explained the engineering behind it, the main point being that *weight doesn't matter in zero-gravity*. Rockets don't have to pass crash-tests either. Whoosh."
"To piggyback off this, because I feel like people aren't going to understand... on a rocket, weight is EVERYTHING. Rocket design is about shaving as much weight off everywhere you can without sacrificing structural integrity to the point of failure. A few kilos difference on a rocket could mean a hundred kilos difference in payload capacity because you've got to carry that extra mass into orbit as well.

There's a reason the specific materials were picked over others that might seem more obvious to a casual observer. I mean if you REALLY want efficiency by reducing weight, just make it out of Carbon Fiber. They have a ton of experience with that also."
The deposit is refundable. It could be a marketing strategy to gauge interest.
I thought this one looked pretty good [https://electrek.co/2019/10/10/tesla-pickup-truck-blade-runneresque-than-elon-musk/](https://electrek.co/2019/10/10/tesla-pickup-truck-blade-runneresque-than-elon-musk/)
"Yeah, cuz everyone here is so excited about the Pyramid Truck design."
"The more I think about it, I could definitely see someone living with one of these in the middle of nowhere. Charging it with solar panels. Using it on rough terrain, not having to worry about scratching the paint or other cosmetic and rust issues a normal pickup might have. Perfect for a Mars Colonist or just someone living off the grid."
Rivians start at 70k for 200 miles range. Their 400 mile range truck is 100k.
There are more and more chargers installed everyday. Just download PlugShare and go crazy. I drive a Volt and travel to Ottawa from Southeast Pa once or twice a year and have already mapped out that when I get a BEV that can do EC fast charging I can make my way all the way to Ottawa and back on electric alone. Charging there and on the way there and back. That’s just one route.
"Probably I know only one guy with truck that really needs it he uses it to haul builder machinery like cement mixers power generators and so on(tough most of builders I know just use vans of different size from Berlingo/Kangoo up to Master or Ducato in our weather it's better to have materials and tools covered inside not in the open also smaller vans are better in city centres than pick up trucks), other guy maybe applicable too as he has yacht and no SUV could haul it so he brought truck from USA with gigantic engine so few times a year he hauls it through Poland from South up North to Masurian lakes, rest (3 more) have it as dick enlarge pill."
"Good luck hauling a significant number of farm payloads with that bed design. Not gonna happen, at least not efficiently or without added structure. I'm not sure they talked to anyone who actually uses trucks before signing off on this."
Access to the bed would be nice. Tough to tie down anything close to the cab. I've heard those panels can be removed so now you have to find storage for those retarded things whenever you want to use the bed.
People that drive F-150’s don’t drive them because the actually need a truck. They drive them because of how they look. This travesty won’t take a single sale from Ford.
The people today that buy and use trucks won't like this. They don't want to be laughed off the construction site or farm.
"The angles are horrible on that thing
Edit: I meant the peak on top, if the flattened it out a little it would be a lot more appealing to truck guys."
"It’s too ugly. Right now the majority of people don’t really need a f-150, but they like how they look or prefer a pickup to a sedan or suv. This truck was not designed for truck people at all."

Yesss!
Thanks Jerry
Most of towing capacity is stopping ability anyway
Elon has already said it will start at about $50k
"Tesla has more sensor, AI, and electric drivetrain experience.  Ford has more vehicle and truck experience.  \*shrug\* but experience doesn't necessarily mean better.  It just gives you a better chance."
"Agreed. Tesla would have to develop and sell its own hitch system as a measly little 2” receiver ain’t gonna cut it. 

Even a fifth wheel hitch can only pull 31k pounds...

I wouldn’t be surprised if this truck could move 300k, but realistic towing capacity will probably be limited to the hitch and trailer combination..."
I hope not. That won't fit in my garage.

"lol no. They designed something way too weird. Was polarizing, difficult to manufacture, etc. Elon said they should probably not have built the X. But here we are... This thing will never come to market"
"I went with Dual Motor, its actually better equipped than I thought the 49k model would be, I expected the 39k spec to be the 49k one."
"Got my order in, do a remind me in 2-3 years and I'll prove it."
Oh no a square steering wheel. Definitely won’t feel like driving a truck
"I watched it, probably the funniest 30 minutes all year. Trying to share the comedy with others."
Elon obsessed with apocalyptic scenarios
That seems real shitty
The website died and I didn't get a reservation number.
That's true.no point in worrying. It's 100$ not 1000
Wireless game controller!
Production won't start until 2022.
It's possible to paint stainless steel lol
"Motortrend didn't make it clear if Tesla will wrap it, or if it's something you'll have to do yourself. I'm betting the latter."
How is it not possible?
Yes
Thank you :)
"Yikes, Thanks for the quick reply. Looks like dual motor it is!!"
No i meant a view on demand because i cant find the full unveiling event
Something like that will be even better. The drag coefficient is just one part of the equation.
"> Glass breaks easy

LOL"
Lol
"It only cracks, it doesn't break. They threw what looks to be a 2lb hardened steel ball at it."
"The jaws of life are usually used by inserting them between the gap in the doors. However, most doors are really narrow, so a sledgehammer or axe is used to dent the door to create enough space."
"Pumas aren't real, they're imaginary creatures"
"What about checking rear-view to look at the rear seat passengers?  Gonna be a lot of looking over your shoulder, removing eyes from road way for longer than necessary.  Maybe they'll have an interior camera option also to help with that."
Are you sure?  I heard 57 inches.  5.7 ft would be wider than the whole truck
Just to be clear I think bigger trucks are fine if that gets people converted from ICE and also get users something better.
I don’t want to rub elbows when I’m driving. To me it’s 5 seats...same as a car but with a flat-bed.
"This. Current ICE vehicles have many electrical components that monitor what the engine is doing. It's why your check engine light turns on when your spark plugs are gunked up and begin misfiring. There is a chip to detect that, and many more things. But there is less to check with an electric motor. Gas engines are so much more complex."
There’s always going to be a level of expected permissibility with those because the majority of the population uses these as an outside resource that belongs to a business or local government. The truck is different because it’s personal property. There’s a different level of frustration when your own personal property (anything AI/software driven) starts to underperform.
"Gotta disagree, the design is beautiful. This'll sell."
Don't drive it to a construction site.
"Construction workers are to trucks as 9 year old girls are to Hello Kitty. And there's no construction worker on earth that would be caught dead driving this thing to a job site.

If their goal was to break into the truck market, swing and a fucking miss. They'll sell fewer of these than the original Roadster."
"Tomorrow morning there will be a tweet, ""We hear you. I spoke with the designers, and we're going back to the drawing board with the exterior design.""

Elon is crazy. But he's not stupid. This design is stupid."
That's basically all jobsite tools.
Okay so why didn't elon talk about it. The presentation was focused on the wrong things
"You’re delusional, the amount of stuttering and utter lack of organization was appalling. Would not be surprised to see Tesla stock tank tomorrow"
He also told us the model 3 was going to look like a spaceship.
"I would think it would be standard to help with drag and range efficiency, but I question everything after that demo."
"You need to consider small volumes, made out of flat panels, no presses, no paint shop etc.....

To make high volumes they would need a new factory and 2+ years...

The built this thing in quick time:-

> A month later we had a chance to go back and check in on Tesla's progress on the Cybertruck. The life-size clay model we'd seen before had—quite shockingly—been joined by a half-finished Cybertruck running prototype.  

 [https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-photos-info) 

&#x200B;

So I think low volumes initially, and partially  hand built... is the most likely scenario."
"That's not going to stop pre-orders, and this truck is absolutely going to be the coolest thing on the market in 6 months once the hype starts.

Look at the attention this thread is getting. People are already excited.

And your condescending 'honey' notwithstanding, you said nothing to refute my points."
"Ooh, true. I wonder if they'll offer it. They are already appealing to commercial customers with the semi."
"The bodies on this generation of Ford are aluminum and have not prevent to be very durable, firstly.

Second: towing on the 350 starts at 15k lbs. Pretty comparable.

The 350 will be a smarter choice for a tiny fraction of truck buyers who opt for the super duty. If you're getting an average f-150, this is probably a better choice by miles."
"> looks stylish

Are you legally blind?"
People are crying that it doesn't look like a 'regular' truck made by Chevy or Ford.
Change is good only if it's an improvement.
Exact same experience here
"I dunno. I like how it’s a completely different look, and I’m sure I’m not alone.

I think it’ll sell enough for a niche market. I don’t think it will be the “top selling truck” like how the M3 is crushing every country.

But it’ll sell enough to be popular"
Well... the ball throwing x 2 plus the fact he designed this truck...
"I mean he is gotta be having a tough night, judging by reactions to the design on this very Tesla friendly subreddit. Poor Franz"
"Was

&#x200B;

;)"
"And the nutty thing is, normally my first reaction is ""but the gas mileage!"" but it doesn't matter now."
Releasing later — in a way this is a preview of 2021 Tesla prices.
250+ miles on late 2021 release. Probably has new battery tech that the Y will eventually get by that time.
"I did too quickly. If I read the fine print wrong, we can cancel if we want right? 

Never click the pay button prior to reading the terms and conditions on a 50K car kids. Lol"
may the force be with you.
LOL that could be true for sure. He's been a diesel Chevy/GM guy for 25 years. BUT! He loves his tech for some reason! EVen ridiculous stuff! He had a Zune and the first iPhone and iPad.
Depends if he is a pickup guy that drives it to the mall or if he is a pickup guy that actually use a pickup.
"1) more people buy F150s than jeeps.

2) because it's just practical enough for the majority of small truck owners who use them for home-depot trips and moving furniture."
Why did you edit your comment bruh. At least commit to your joke
I hope so man. I’m the biggest Tesla fan you will meet and I hope I’m wrong about this.
tesla.com/cybertruck
Maybe they can make that piece black though (or you can wrap it yourself) so it doesn't stand out quite as much. If it doesn't grow on me in the next 2-3 years that's what I'm going to do.
"So mush less aero though. 

Also, only works for short rear seat passengers."
If that's what people say they want they can change that in no time.
You have a point. I’m eager to see how this does.
Why would someone buy this over a regular tesla? Truck people would never buy this ever.
"Hope u didn’t jump the gun. If not, be sure to ship it to Mars when colonization gets going."
True. Elon was definitely thinking too much about mars lmao
😞
true
"I don't think you're using the world ""exactly"" accurately. It checks boxes, yes. The right ones? Maybe not."
Apparently to protect *other cars*
Solid sample size.
As a young boy I drooled over those. This truck wasn't drool worthy.
"Either/both. You can get tools to break auto glass windows, first responders have them."
"You seen the video of the window demonstration? It breaks but it doesn't shatter and fall into pieces? That's because there's a sheet of plastic between two sheets of glass that holds them together.

In the event of a rollover in a normal car, if the windows don't break, you would use a window punch which causes the glass to shatter into small pieces so you can escape through the window.

That would not work in this because there is probably several sheets of glass with plastic sandwiched in-between them. That means if your door gets stuck, you've got no way out."
"I've seen plenty of videos of cars going off of cliffs and steep drops. Remember, there is no such thing as a ""normal"" or ""average"" car crash.

I have a stove in my house, I use it to burn coal. The fire never exits the stove, but my house still gets warm. Fire doesn't need to penetrate a surface in order to heat the other side of it. Cars are big steel boxes, steel transmits heat fairly well."
"Tint is fine, the window will break but it may not fall apart instantly. It will fall apart when you push on it though. Here's a couple of videos that show what I mean.  


Normal ""safety glass"" window. You see how it shatters into hundreds of pieces when a window punch is used.  
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5f7pZX61Bo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5f7pZX61Bo)   


And now the laminated glass, the guy in the video makes a good point. You can see that he hits the window with it over and over and it refuses to break. That's because there's a sheet of plastic glued between the layers of glass that prevents them from shattering.  
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ96pg9D\_30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ96pg9D_30)   


Laminated glass is designed to stop objects getting through it. That's why it's used in your windscreen. To protect you from rocks and other things that might get kicked up off the road. It should NOT be used in side windows. If the doors fail, the side windows are your only other escape route."
Nice
"Everyone hated the BMW X6 when it came out. A SUV with a sloping roof? Even BMW didn't expect much sales and expected their X5 to still be the sales leader by a large margin.

It quickly turned out people wanted an obnoxious coupe styled SUV on the highway, and X6 sales surpassed X5 sales quite quickly.

This Cybertruck is an even more futuristic Model X, and the roofline will massively help in efficiency, compared to Rivian's model which needs larger batteries and thus longer recharge times because blocks don't move that easy through air, compared to wedges.

The built-in onramp is the icing on the cake. Who needs 'access' if you can just walk and drive into the bed."
Lmfao at the last line. As if anything other than a bed is different from truck to car.
"Nah, I think it's a very edgy design."
Then you should learn how to spell it.
[deleted]
People here said the same about the Model 3 during that unveil.
A small business owner doesn't just look at their fleet of pickup trucks. They use them.
That's reassuring to hear. I'm imagining the look will continue to feel more and more positive as time goes on.
"One thing ill say is, from being an asshole as a younger kid, if id hucked that ball at my own cars window i easily would have gotten in, and likely out at the other side."
That's kinda what's gonna make or break it though
"Well, the flaw in their little window stunt will certainly ensure it makes headlines, so hopefully that’ll drive up sales.

After all, there’s no such thing as bad publicity."
It’s one thing to make something non-conventional. It’s another to make a disaster.
Body kits always seem to find a way
Ah...Rookie mistake.  Thanks for clarifying.
"Really shows how much they are just winging it. Elon is a huge risk taker, he has said that many times. I respect the shit out of him."
"And every Tesla vehicle, no?"
Goes to show the fake Tesla fans right now on this sub.  Everyone's saying shit about that guy.  Lol
Hmmm... so this probably wasn't his finest moment
your email was one of the required fields
There's a reason the truck looks like it was designed by a 10 year old.
I just got the email.
curses!
Isn't that Porygon?
"Sure. The Tesla Dual motor tows 10,000 lbs, has a payload of 3,500 lbs and has a range of 300 miles. A similarly priced Ram 3500 can tow up to 35,000 lbs, have a payload up to 7,700 lbs and have ranges up to 450 miles."
There's no way the AWD versions go into production before 2022.
Are they still mandatory in the US? ID.3 won't have rear view mirrors upon release in Germany.
Uglier... but I like it
"Weren't ""you all"" talking about Tesla yesterday?"
[thoughts](https://i.imgur.com/tKI6vb3.jpg)
Have you tried turning it off and then on again
Touché. Hopefully the jagged polygons will also reflect the sun’s deathrays onto those enemies.
"I get that Tesla has a great safety record, but I’m confident that that’s largely due to the current demographic that buys Tesla’s. In 10-30 years time when these sort of vehicles are the norm, I imagine crash-rates will also increase again - perhaps not to the current rate, but still an increase.

Ultimately I just don’t think it’ll be beneficial to begin abolishing all safety precautions like shatter glass and crumple zones"
Stainless isn't that much harder to cut. I cut it with a normal bimetal blade. If that doesn't work then abrasives or tungsten carbide will do it no issue.
*hire
"Bro no engineer is going to design something so impractical. This looks like they were trying to design a military vehicle. Idk I almost think his plan is to show this crazy ufo concept truck, get some free press from all of the negative attention, and then they're going to do a redesigned *real* truck."
"It was designed by Franz, the guy who threw the ball that broke the windows."
Beautiful compared to the Tesla
Holy shit that is something else
There are people who utilize trucks that cannot wait for a functional electric vehicle and we were hoping Tesla could deliver. Considering most trucks are in the 40-50k price range this isn't too far off price wise. I was looking forward to this after I am done with my Nissan but not anymore. I mean design considering did they talk to anyone with a truck? How the fuck are you supposed to reach the front of the truck bed without climbing in it.. I wouldn't want this parked in front of my house.
"Honestly it’s not any uglier than any truck on the market right now, it’s just *different* ugly."
"let me help you out there

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Multipla"
Don’t diss Walter whites car like that
All 3 deserve a design award next to the Tesla.  I’d take a PT cruiser with the side paneling over the Tesla.
"That’s exactly what I was waiting for, I was convinced the real truck would show up eventually, I thought “there’s no fucking way this is the truck”. It actually looks like it was made as some mid-budget broadway prop. 

I was excited to see what it would be because I’ve been bent on buying one if I liked it enough, and really it feels like a slap in the face. *”we know you want a pickup so here, this from blade runner we don’t care if you like it or not”*."
"I was almost expecting that to be just a side truck for the few people that would actually want it, like a novelty thing and the real truck would be announced after. But no, just an ATV. No pickup truck that any mature adult would actually spend money on."
"It's awesome-looking in that it looks weird and disturbing. Like ""haha i cant believe they actually made this!""

Looks bad."
Awesomely ugly
Still feel the same after 24 hours. Time will tell I guess but I don't think its gonna swing
I cant even get serious about this vehicle. I almost feel like I just got trolled by Elon. I thought I was going to own a nice new electric truck for 2020. Now I wait for 2021!
Ugh. Tbh the tesla is cooler and I can't even begin to understand why its growing on me lmao.
Those rivian headlights are wack
They have two truck designs Elon mentioned that if enough people hated the cybertruck they would reveal the second truck . I think it was a ride the lightning podcast where he said this
You could always buy an old Ford Ranger EV and swap in a Tesla battery pack. Despite their rarity (~400 that escaped scrapping once their leases were up) they can be found for relatively cheap once their original batteries wear down.
Who needs bumpers and mirrors when you are on a CYBERTRUCK
And how about not being able to see out the back.
"No, he's a chevy volt heathen"
they're pushing it. we don't know if it's forwards.
"Yeah, it is growing on me.  “Normal” can be difficult to break. I personally would drive it, but It is clear a lot of people wouldn’t.  That may change the more they consider it.

Someone parks one next to me, and honestly I would be envious."
Amen.
They still can’t beat the 2012 model s
"> Other manufacturers have had years to match Tesla but no one is even able to compete with a Model S today that was released almost half a decade ago.

Realistically they haven’t had to.. they have been making good money selling the same old shit. When the market changes they will change, and thats finally happening. 

Thanks to Tesla, of course.. among other notable early EV’s. Tesla ONLY makes EV’s, though, so huge incentive to make something better that steals consumers away from the legacy brands and models."
"The reservation then was to help insure you'd get one in time before the tax credit goes away. There was a lot of uncertainty then, but it looks like production ramped up quickly enough that everyone who reserved in the US got their $7500 credit, save for those who waited for the standard range."
But reservations are different now.  It’s only $100.
"The Tesla won't be able to camp our haul anything?

Also the Tesla seems to be half the price for the range."
Yeah but this is a bit more functional it seems. Built in ramps are a nice touch.  So much to consider.
"this thread is just going to be filled with fanboys, and that’s fine, i get it. there’s a lot to like about the company. but i’m convinced you are in the minority of Ram owners that would consider this truck.

would be very happy to be proved wrong. i want Tesla to do well. but this seems like a huge missed opportunity."
"IMO, i don’t think you could have picked something less relevant to draw a comparison to"
That's just Lisa Simpson sucking someone off.
"I'm 28 and was excited for this reveal. Not anymore, I'll wait and see what Ford and GM (rumor they're doing an EHummer Pick up) put out. Electric is the future, but this looks terrible."
I doubt he's old but the boomer has a point. None of you guys need a truck when living in a condo downtown and scootering to your jobs.
To be fair I’m all for change but that particular design looks kinda meh.
I'm 30 and I think it looks like garbage. Change for the sake of change isn't always a good thing. Maybe when you get older you will realize that.
"Wow that's original, no one has ever said that before eh!"
"None of those sold in volume.

What people like buying even more than different and ugly shit are popular, successful vehicles like the F-150, Ram and GM pickups."
"Except those designs aren't radically different. I think the closest example is the Nissan Cube, and we know how that turned out."
"Well that makes sense, it's a truck designed for people who don't need or use actual trucks."
You’re basing this off a $100 fully refundable deposit... That’s a joke.
A deposit is not a sale
"No, it won't take away their profitability, but their stock is gonna tank tomorrow. 

Of course it will rebound, but that drop is guaranteed."
">  In this case Tesla our Prius'd the Prius

I don't think this analogy is apt.  The Prius design is one of compromise of function over aesthetics as it's designed to be aerodynamically efficient.  

Whether you like the CyberTruck design or not (I can see the appeal, but I'm not a fan and I think it's a mistake), it is certainly a **NO COMPROMISE** design.  This thing was designed with a vision and they stuck to it despite the fact that the design is absolutely certain to polarize and turn off a lot of potential customers."
We are 3!
Fixed: [https://i.imgur.com/vOr9qSC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vOr9qSC.jpg)
Glad someone Made it
Wait I'm the first?
"I'm right there with you. I told myself if the top model is under 100k and does everything I need it to, I'm in. Only hope is they restyle it a bit."
"It just isn't going to work for the masses like the model 3, s, & x do. Speaking strictly of ""truck people', for the working/towing guys, function is more important than styling. That means having equal or greater specs than the big 3 full size models and something that doesn't look like complete dog shit. For your weekend, home depot guy, style is definitely more important than function. That means something that looks really good, but is also functional enough to do lighter truck things. Not really any heavy towing or commercial level work. Tesla needed to follow the same path as they did with the model 3, all the technology and advancements you would expect from Tesla while beating all current competitor specs without going too radical with the design. The cybertruck is way too radical of a design. If I put this into a scale of 1-10, 1 being an f150 clone and 10 being this current Cybertruck, I really think they needed to be in the 5 range, 8 max. Most people will be completely fine with something thats a little out of the ordinary. But this is way over the top. 

I desperately wanted this Tesla truck to compete with the big guys. I said in many other posts leading up to tonight, if it has or beats the specs of a tow package equipped f150 and doesn't look terrible, they will sell a million of them. If it beats the full size (f350 class) and doesn't look terrible, they will have the big guys on the ropes. I will need to see more specs, but from what was shown tonight, the ""guts"" of this thing are pretty great. Air suspension, 14k lbs towing capacity, lockable bed, loading ramp, etc. It falls kind of in the middle of a f250 and f150. Great! But my god they blew it with the design. 

For the ""Tesla Truck"", they needed to produce something that appeals to the masses. If Elon wanted to make some Blade Runner wet dream that a select few will buy, he should have gone all out, priced it at 200k, and parked it next to the roadster. I'm extremely disappointed tonight."
I don't hate it and I can already tell it will grow on me. I also think with just a few tweaks it could look spectacular. But it will not go over well with the general public.
"Pretty sure it was the same glass.  It'd be a silly mistake to have the wrong glass on the car. 

When the ball was dropped on the glass in the first demo it was clamped down from all sides so the load was distributed evenly.  The glass on the car is only being supported from the bottom so would break easier."
"I think it's more likely that the glass needs to have room to flex & absorb the impact. That's why the demo team kept resetting the clamps after the ball caused the glass to bounce. The truck's frame didn't allow the same behaviour. 

And probably also a case of Elon going rogue and declining to actually practice his presentation."
"Rivian truck looks way better though, what’s up with all the Zoomers basically saying “boo old man!” if someone doesn’t like the Cybertruck design?"
"I would say it's to the Y as the X is to the 3, high priced initial version to fund the mass... but they listed the price sooo I yield back my time"
"> This truck is going to sell like the i3, not the F150.

I think that was the expectation."
It looks amazing to me. I agree it's an extremely polarising design. I couldn't have hoped for a better outcome.
Ditto. I was tempted to wait for this but I’m going to opt for the rivian. https://rivian.com
Hahahaha. Tesla_Truck.v.1.01.exe is not responding. Do you wish to close the application?
No one would think that Tesla would decide to step back from the design decisions that made them popular in the first place.  This is a design that comes from the 80s and 90s.  It's awful.  I cannot understand anyone liking it unless you also liked those awful looking things from way back when too.
"Nobody read Elon's tweets, only geeks and fans."
The cybertruck looks like when spongebob rode the rock around.
"Not yet they won't, he's got bigger misleads coming"
"As Tesla owners, I don't think we get to chastise other companies for using proprietary power connectors."
"I think he’s fine, I enjoy listening to him"
Him being a weird dude kinda makes Tesla stand out.
His primary skill is actually to engineer really good product. He’s very much involved in the engineering details of all the companies he manages.
"I do not believe that is Musk's primary purpose. He is a visionary, the financial backer (or gets financial backing) and seems to be the chief or a lead designer. Those are enough roles. Steve Jobs was the visionary and presenter, we are trying to stamp Musk into Jobs just because of shared visionary."
"I'm a share holder, and a blue collar worker.  I wanted an awesome electric pickup truck for work, sigh :("
I honestly don't know what I was expecting.  There have been far too many awesome artist renditions that I fell in love with before this monstrosity was unveiled.
Or a functional pick-up truck.
I didn’t realize boomers could be born in 1998 damn🤷🏻‍♂️

Do you imagine baseball sized stainless steel rocks to be flung About is a typical day on mars?
But it’s going to be super cheap to build massive amounts of spare parts to send to Mars.
"You need crumple zones, modern cars get the front destroyed in a impact, but because the deformation absorbs a lot of the energy of the impact, if the whole car acts as a rigid then a impact will go straight to you trought the safety belt"
You gonna make dump trucks illegal? Good luck.
do they also have a release window? like 2021 or so?
"Want until you see it with the real tires it will need to have the rated range. It's going to be pretty bad with some wimpy 18"" street tires"
I you need a truck for work an exoskeleton is stupid tho. This is a truck for people who don’t need  a truck
Lol ok bud.
What you will get are ladder racks.
Guess you guys aren't ready for that yet... but your great-grand kids are gonna love it.
It’s kind of cool though
"Looks deliberately, comically, bad."
100% agree. the stainless steel looks like a cheap material they use for patching fences or broken home windows. why couldn't they have painted it? they thought it would look more futuristic I guess. completely departure from their previous cars.
"true. one could say it's a concept car. they can hopefully fix a lot of the ugliest things about the car. like if it had a black paint covering like a stealth bomber, the ugly corners wouldn't stick out as much."
A very close second
"Don’t you dare bash the glorious Aztek 😤/s (on a serious note tho, I low key love the idea of the aztek even if it’s ugly, so having a Tesla truck with seemingly more power and way better styling/versatility makes me excited)"
I just don't understand what Tesla was thinking with this.  It does not look good.
So why aren't their other vehicles this ugly?
So you want cars that look like this too?  So you'd rather they have this *unique* ugly design rather than be successful?
"Nothing wrong with agreeing.  Fortunately this is just one design and hopefully an outlier.  If they decide to go this route with all their entire lineup, I'll be moving on."
"Pretty dumb idea to base a design on.  They should have stuck with what made them popular.  If I ever see one on the road, I may actually laugh myself into a wreck."
You get the extra textures when you pay for the dlc.
They should have put some matte olive green paint on it
">This truck was made for Californians, not for job sites.

Could you explain why please?"
totally agree. what a waste. just so Elon could waltz on stage and say “it’s bulletproof!”
I don't know anything about trucks. Which feature was lacking?
What about it makes it unsuitable for a work site?
"I believe the monthly cost for people like you will convince people to deal with the ugliness. If they can spend $400 a month in fuel and that drops to $50 I bet they will become converts quickly. 

It’s ugly, but it’s still a fully functional truck. Add some racks to it and it will look a bit better. 

But what construction worker doesn’t want a raised lambo to drive and haul their gear?"
"I know a few people in the market for an electric pickup as well. I'm not even going to tell them about this announcement, I already know what their reaction will be."
"I know nothing about construction, but why won’t this work? The only major thing I don’t see is an extended roof rack but I don’t see most trucks except those hauling garbage with those. Are the dimensions of the truck bed vastly different than a ford?"
[deleted]
Why is it trash? Just looks?
"> Also, the slide basically said it has infinite pulling capacity

So what? Nobody needs infinite pulling capacity, not that they even need a million pound pulling capacity."
"I know. For one thing, trains are on rails and it’s really only the first one or two cars that matter the most, the rest of the movement is heavily relied upon the initial inertial cars being pulled. 

Still, however, the electric F150 despite the train’s mathematical marketing ploys, is heavier than 14,000 pounds anyways."
"Seriously.  People haven’t been paying attention to Elon when he said not everyone will like it.  For me, on the other hand, this is the perfect truck."
"Here’s the thing, the Yukon is his retirement vehicle. He plans to take it in this February to turn the lease into a finance to buy it. The entire idea to just drop the Yukon at end of lease was dependent on how Tesla handled the truck. He was interested in it primarily as a replacement for the Yukon because of how Tesla handles luxury and how it could be translated into a vehicle of capability. The truck has neither. 

Now, I’ve been trying to sway him towards testing out the X, but he’s hellbent on the truck form factor if he must replace his Yukon. 

To be honest, everyone but Tesla won tonight. GMC looks like they just sold a Yukon tonight, and truly I’m actually a tad down about that. 

It actually reminds me of a joke I tend to repeat in the checkout line of my grocery store. I say, as I point to the reusable bags, “Reusable cloth bag for $2. If they want to save the environment, why do they mark it up so high?” What I mean is, if Elon/Tesla wants to replace ICE trucks, why make something that can’t replace their capabilities at all?"

It’s due to the EXTREME negligence towards designing a truck that will be capable of anything but an extremely fast door stop."
It's still too tall to reach over.
"But you're not reaching anything in the front of the bed from the side of the truck due to the slope. The guy is right, access to the bed contents here is a problem."
They were pulling a normal F150.
"    Shit the bed

Very good choice of words, here. Who knew southern Texans could be so good at puns?"
"OP’s complaint seems directed at the 3/4 ton + market. The majority of trucks sold to consumers are 1/2 ton where a 14,000 lb tow rating would be near the top of the class. Tesla is trying to break into that market, not the contractor business. And they will fail to get much traction in either market."
You sound like someone that’s never worked out of a truck.
"oh PLEASE, enlighten us."
Really contributed to the conversation here. Good work.
"As a massive Tesla fan, I feel like a dumbass but the dude is totally right with just about every single point he made. 

Except Franz did nothing wrong, dont fire him"
"Nah, people aren’t just ready to embrace the future"

That is a tight timeline. It needs to be out before Rivian  and others can get their stuff off the ground so you may be right about a year or two.
psssttt..... late 2020 IS \~1 year away already.
"Right, right"
 suuuure lol We ain’t seeing anything for awhile.
Maybe just keep them the way they are..
Can’t be. If you’re in an accident do you want a 6’ slab of marble going through your chest?

"lol I know that

I want NUMBERS DAMN IT!"
not sure thats how it works....
"This has always been the problem with electric trucks. 

I keep saying that until we have 500-1000 mile batteries, hybrids are the best option for trucks because they allow us to go 90% electric now, while retaining an unlimited range and instant refuel time at a low cost. It's absolutely a no-brainer, all you need is a small 150hp generator that can push you at highway speeds as long as you have fuel"
You deserve an award
Should reservations show up yet?  I have a charge on my credit card but no confirmation email nor anything in my account page.
"You can, theres a window to the bed"
What do you mean?
im sorry what lol.
"They are, not everybody wants to store giant pieces of trim."
"No, he handled it fantastic I must say. It’s very interesting how the glass cracked. Apparently it was not the impact proof glass, but they must have rehearsed the demonstration with the metal ball. Very confused that it could happen."

It’s a shit storm of broken glass and triangles out there."
Could we at least get a new megathread? (Post event).

"I’m assuming if the road is too narrow this will widen it a little for you. 
I grew up near Alfriston where Jeremy Clarkson tried to drive the Hummer H2, I’ve also had a Jeep Grand Cherokee for a few years so I know the issues of larger vehicles. Totally prepared to take the slightly longer route in the CT."
"Similar size to current American trucks
https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-unveiled/"
Or another way to look at it is Tesla made a truck that even people who don’t need a truck want to buy. Great job Elon!
Do you not know truck guys? I know people who *more then happily* spend more then 50k on their truck.
"I paid $70k for my Ram.

Trucks are expensive."
"When you have King Ranch F-150s going for 80k+, 50k isn't too bad for the space"
Where are you getting 50 from? starts just shy of 40
It's 40k. And at least it doesn't look like every other pickup truck out there.
"I didn't like it at first either but seeing it drive around and from different angles, I can picture them driving around on the street. I think it's just a matter of getting used to it. Also I think it would look pretty bad ass in black. I'm glad it doesn't look like anything that's out there."
Pretty sure it is design but ok.
I disagree but I respect your opinion
"for a normal person yeah. i get his point though, some young rich dudes would buy it just to look ridiculous. you drive this and you know nobody will ever resist looking at you"
I like the fact that it looks like an APC lol.
"Or the no problem at all, depending on the person"
We are faaaaaaaar away from considering autopilot being real deal enough so we can think about sacrificing drivers core additions for design(?).
Dystopian future
"Ah, I hope that's true... I can see why it wouldn't be to go to marketing thing to mention, but it's alarming if it doesn't."
"Yeah, it's other vehicles and pedestrians that I AM worried about!

I had a physics teacher in high school who was a conservative Republican type and in a lesson about momentum once, he said, that's why I drive cars from the 50's and 60's to protect my family, because they're heavy and solid.

I went home and asked my dad about it, and he was like, yeah, typical conservative.  He's relying on crumple zones in the other car to kill the other family so that his will be okay.  That's when it clicked for me why modern cars aren't ""built like they used to be."""
"Because the majority of truck people won't want it. Because it looks dumb. I can safely say that guys who drive trucks will think this isn't a good product for their demographic. When a product doesn't appeal to the market they're trying to appeal towards, it's not a good product."
"I know you’re playin’ me, but it’s working!"
"3 different trims available right now. 40k, 50k and 70k price points. [tesla.com/cybertruck](https://tesla.com/cybertruck)"
"That doesn’t equal profits, though. The only talking I’m doing is about how insane it looks. Cool and futuristic? Yes. Conjures images of a society that has moved beyond petroleum powered vehicles? Yes. I can’t wait to buy that and put it in my driveway? No."
"It doesn’t. I guess cool was the wrong word but it’s definitely subjective. To me a cool looking truck is a Tacoma TRD Pro. It just looks like what I think a cool truck is and that I’d be proud to have in my driveway.

This truck is cool in the sense that if I saw it in a future movie I’d think “cool trucks they have in the future” but not “cool trucks they have for sale”"
Yup. It’s $40000
Me three!!!
this guy gets it.
It's cyberpunk. It's basically a pun.
Twice the price 100x less the embarrassment
Because Honda already took the Crosstour name?
Do you have eyes? This thing is a monstrosity
"Not in the world of pick-ups. Have you spec’d a similarly equipped ICE rig lately? You’re going to be pushing close to six figures in some brands (looking at you, Ram)."
You are going to feel really dumb for saying that soon.
And that is where it ends
"No. I meant prospective buyers in future. I love my Tesla, I had S and own P3D, would never buy any other car. But for truck, I may have to look elsewhere, good thing is EV market is heating up so there will be lot of choices."
"Yes and no. There are a lot of truck owners who buy them for what they are: work horses. This thing will help a lot of people get stuff done... quicker.

Also, a great many F-150s (and up) are owner by small business/contractor types who would love to turn heads to get noticed. This thing delivers here ;)"
"Honestly, I think you're wrong here. While you are correct in there being a lot of truck owners who are like you described. Many, I would even say most, are not like that. Think about it, there are tons of guys out there like you described who drive ""muscle cars"" that use just as much gas and are just as obnoxious. These aren't truck guys, these are douchebags. I'm not like that and I've owned many trucks and fast cars. Recently a f350 diesel. Probably 90% of truck/performance car owners I know are also like me. It isn't that truck owners don't like electric vehicles, we just need to see it outperforming the diesel/gas counterparts. Just like we needed to see an electric vehicle keep up with a performance/muscle car. For the working/towing guys, that means having equal or greater specs than the big 3 full size models and something that doesn't look like complete dog shit. For your weekend, home depot guy, that means something that looks really good, but is also functional enough to do lighter truck things. Not really any heavy towing or commercial level work.

&#x200B;

I desperately wanted this Tesla truck to compete with the big guys. I said in many other posts, if it has or beats the specs of a tow package equipped f150 and doesn't look terrible, they will sell a million of them. If it beats the full size (f350) and doesn't look terrible, they will have the big guys scrambling. I will need to see more specs, but from what was shown tonight, the ""guts"" of this thing are pretty great. It falls kind of in the middle of a f250 and f150. Great! But my god they blew it with the design. They needed to produce something that appeals to the masses. Not some Blade Runner wet dream that a select few will buy. Thats what the roadster is for. I'm extremely disappointed tonight."
Yeah I’m sure a misspelling is super important. My 60k is certainly not going to Tesla after tonight.
Boom! Roasted.
Have a good day.
I was mainly making the point that people who like it are called things such as “brain dead”.
"Ahh yes, because liking something a vast majority of other don’t is equivalent to being a blind follower."
Thanks for proving the point I made in my edit.
Glass isn't not indestructible. If you want to be able to roll down the windows I doubt we'll be seeing indestructible glass in 2020. The strides he's made with this type of glass is pretty impressive. Show me another car company trying to innovated on the glass. I won't hold my breath.
"People are laughing at the windows breaking when it's obvious no other manufacturers have even tried to innovate on this feature. Most people on reddit cheer when things like this happen because they are shallow and have nothing to bring to idea. ""he said it would be indestructible... Haha..."". 

What do you want for under 40k? Compared to this the f 150 4x4 is made out of paper...""but but but, the glass still broke....womp womp""

You people make me sick. This is why you will never be able to afford one. Musk is an idiot trying to cater to people like you because you're ungrateful brats. That's my point"
"Yet, Elon stamps this abomination approved and the sheep will follow, no matter."
...and a trunk in the front.
Well that sucks. Because that's exactly what I wanted it for.
My tonneau cover only covers the box level to the top of the tailgate. This design provides more covered storage and the sloped surfaces will make it easier to knock the snow off. My 2014 F150 V8 is going to be retired when I take delivery. I ordered today so I'll probably get it in 2022.
And the tailgate that opens to below level. You can say goodbye to ever trying to use your tailgate as a makeshift work bench. Or the massive fucking hubcaps that are going to rub on any and every curb.
What’s wrong with a slanted bed? More storage lol
Revian?
146k pre orders
"I was going to get the Jeep Gladiator, but my wife and kid thought that was ugly.  No way I’ll get away with that triangle windowed monstrosity in my driveway, broken or not.

I may still look into a model x, if the price comes down..."
"$69,900"
"But he hit it with a hammer. Hard. It didn't even dent.

It's like that scene in Knight Rider that should be impossible in real life: https://youtu.be/hfRiedxPQhs?t=200"
"While you're 100% right, it is concerning due to the strength of the steel and the fact that it is a stressed member, meaning that it will be more rigid and stronger structurally than a conventional car frame, which is a concern. But if the glass is anything to go by, this may crumple very well lol. ;)"
"I mean I thought the point of Tesla was that you can have extremely nice electric cars with little to no compromises and this thing just is too fugly. I mean for the specs it would make a great company truck but I wouldn't want to slap my company logo on it, probably would be bad PR lol."
I totally agree. They've excluded the trade market completely. But hey why meet demand when you can appeal to the cyberpunk off-road armoured car enthusiast wtf...
"I'm willing to bet this becomes a corporate vehicle to a ton of companies.

1. Fuel cost.
2. Flat surfaces for wrap.
3. Stainless steel so rust is negligible.
4. Towing/Large Bed
5. Minimalist interior keeps employees focused.
6. They don't give a shit what your opinion is.
7. Actual cost of vehicle.

Where I live in PA... Coal/Gas mine/well trucks will get replaced with these easily."

Then you shouldn't be getting a truck. Utility > form
"Yea, but modern cars are supposed to crumple to lessen forces to passengers in an accident - the cold rolled SS unibody doesn't really do that..."
Call it what you will. It's not going to sell.
"Dissapointed because I want tesla to succeed. The truck segment is pretty straight forward on what they want. This design is tesla trying to reinvent the wheel when they don't need to. Impressive specs alone aren't enough to sell. Tesla is new and hasn't proven themselves yet, especially to truck buyers (an entirely different breed of customer). Tesla lacks a sufficient dealership network and has been made infamous by their model 3 build quality/delivery issues. This design will only sell to west coast techy's trying to have the latest name brand anything. Anyone thinking about making the switch to an electric truck will just wait for the electric f-150 at this point. They completely missed the mark on this."
Taste is subjective. Lack of taste is not.
"I don't know, this is not the best looking thing but it has some appeal to it. Cyberpunk kinda thing the Tesla SUV, on the other hand, looks like a botched up plastic surgery."

"""Hurry up dammit!"""
amazingly on time.  perhaps a forecast for hitting future production goals? :)
I believe the P series are 2 in rear one in front.
And a <2.9s 0-60 time still.
"Also just occurred to me $50k gets a pickup with a 300 mile range, 6 seats, and a huge cargo and towing capacity. So why model Y for $52k?"
Yup
"Yeah I seen that, it just needs something up there. That continuous line from the grill area to the top just looks terrible (IMO)"
Yep. I doubt most people would be buying this to go offroad and parallel parking this would be a nightmare considering there won't be a short bed version avaliable most likely.
It has better turning angles than most trucks for that reason.
There's a short video of it and a f150 towing each other at the end and you can see it's clearly larger than an f150.
"Aside from fuel, there may be some advantages though.  Seems like it would be stealthier and faster than a Humvee.  Less moving parts means easier maintenance and repairs.  The exoskeleton seems to provide some measure of protection and durability.  Electricity to power external communications equipment directly (jammer, radios, satellite, etc) without the need of converters."
Hmm that makes a lot of sense as to the design.
"Oh shit. Pardon my language, but thats ridiculous. Is there an age requirement? Im only 20, but teslas are my favorite car."
I can budget to be able to afford an older tesla. Not necessarily this one
How long do you have to cook steel for it to crumble rather than crumple? Fellow steel eater here but I've never had any success with the crumblyness.

At the same price you get 100 more miles of range and autopilot.

"I think it’s just too much for an average consumer, both in form and function. I think if Tesla made a Model Y-priced electric pickup that had Tesla’s unique design language of looking like futuristic versions of the cars we see today, it could’ve garnered more adoption. I just feel it’s too expensive and radically different for someone to use as their only car or for someone somewhat on the fence about Tesla."
"Middle America will absolutely not accept the truck the way it is. They want something Rivian like that looks like a normal truck but has some uniqueness about it. The American truck market is no joke, Tesla could have made an impact and even if they do come out with a more “normal looking” truck, this definitely took a hit on their reputation. I wanted this to be awesome, there’s no way I would ever buy it."
Except for actually using the bed
If your not here for vanity why not get a older Toyota Tacoma or tundra for around 3-5 grand and will essentially do the same job.
They start at $39900 USD with the top tier being $69900 USD. Pretty average for a truck if you ask me.
New Roadster needs $5k up front and another $45k in 10 days from reservation.

"The specs are nice, but the whole design needs a rework.  Definitely broke the mold, but for every day use not sure how helpful that truck bed design will be."
"yes.  they may make smaller changes, but unless they walk the design back to the starting line this is what you'll get"
"I hate the design, but honestly Tesla is becoming the Apple of cars for many people, and I could see the press going nuts over the many absurdities chosen here, but it spreads the word. Kind of like Apple's 1000$ monitor stand. So absurd, but I feel like everyone heard about it."
"The ploy is that the steel ball didn't go all the way through the glass, don't you see?! Don't you see how if steel balls cant go through glass then when your driving around in your armored truck and someone want to test to see if the glass is really armored with a steel ball, then you will be ok, because it didn't go all the way though. DONT YOU SEE!!!!"
The power of giant stainless steel balls?
The 'any press is good press' ploy. Get people talking about it. Maybe Model 3 sales will go up for the attention Tesla gets for this behemoth.
Not a marketing expert...please expound.
"Thanks, I missed that part. I’ll check it out."
What real pickup driver cares about scratches enough to have no paint? That’s ridiculous.
Missed that part. But I also missed other overview of the interior.
"Yep, missed that part. But you’re relying on a single picture on their website when they had the car right there.

This was a terrible presentation."
I was thinking Star Fox on Super Nintendo
"I remember when the Ram came out and looked like a Semi, so many people hated it bu now it’s what everyone’s trucks went too. 

I would buy it for the 500 mile range and tech honestly. I also like funky designs like this"
"Haha. I loved those when I was 20 and wanted to go camping. Now I am 40 and want to go camping in a hotel. 

It kinda looks like a Lamborghini and a DeLorean hooked upon while high on meth and this is the kid who has been going to the gym."

"It's a Tesla interior, can you imagine some fuck knuckle construction worker getting in with his hands covered in cement and using a tiny scroll wheel? That's flimsy, look at the F-150 and similar, the dials and buttons almost look comical they are so big."
His points are mostly valid though.
"Assumptions, you have eyes correct? I didn't make a single assumption. You can see clearly in the photos every point I made. May you should pull your head out of your ass a bit and actually look at this."
I dunno about that. It sounds like he knows the parts of his truck that he uses and saw some stuff missing here.
"Ford sells literally millions of these a year, so yeah maybe you should listen. Over a 100 years of experience isn't just air."
Official live stream is cycling though photo's at the moment. Interior shots are about 50%.
Tesla's website
"Tesla.com/cybertruck , scroll to the bottomish and there’s a thing where they show a few pictures of the truck from a couple views, one of which is the inside"
I have yet to meet a redneck that voice command understands. This is cyber punk where the fuck are the big chunky dials and giant chrome toggles?! And a round wheel is really the least of this things issues. Vis is probably the most pressing issue.
it looks exactly as Elon teased for years now.
He did say a lot of people would hate it
But not refundable.
"Just tried on the Roadster, and it's still $50K"
None of the others are refundable though
That is a fallacy
"I would have agreed with this, but then I saw the truck."
Nor did the X concept
That's not uncommon at revealings
"> it didnt even have mirrors

Tesla is currently petitioning the US government to allow cameras instead of side mirrors. That would greatly reduce the drag and increase the mileage of all their vehicles. If they start manufacturing the truck before the petition is improved, mirrors will be added."

"Speed yes,, functionality,, no.. Nowhere near the F150. With some tweaks it would rival,, but not in this form.."
"That is nice that it can lower and would be great when hooking up a trailer or putting stuff in. Guess I just cannot stomach the design, I do hope this isn't the final product"
"I really like that design TBH sleek, modern but still looks like a pickup"
It is crazy that the midsizes are almost the same size as the base model Tundra and Titans. I mean I just don't need that big of a truck but love having the crew cab and the space the truck affords me.
Look pretty much like what was presented by Elon tonight.
Hah yeah. I know exactly what you're talking about. There was one guy that built a Lambo from scratch and it looked like it was carved out of wood with a pocketknife.
"No, it hits the nail on the head. Trucks are supposed to stand for rugged manly IDGAFness, nothing says manly IDGAF dude less than choosing a car for its looks."
"Exactly this. I haul stuff every couple weeks on, average probably. Having to climb in the bed around what I'm hauling to get to the front is a huge deal breaker. Not to mention being unable to use the flat surface on the sides to support stuff, etc. Did none of the engineers hear about the original Honda Ridgeline and what a massive fail that turned out to be? 

Most people probably don't use their truck as such though, so the majority of the Tesla crowd won't care about that, but form > function is a big fail for a pickup imo.."
"Agreed completely.  I have no issue with people who have practicality concerns with this vehicle, I do too.

My, apparently contriversial, comment was directed towards people who are saying things to the effect of 'its ugly, I wouldn't be caught dead with that on my farm'."
This is basically what every render guessed it would look like.
Have you looked at literally any render? This is miles better than any of those
We’ve known for months it wouldn’t be a conventional looking truck.
"> most truck buyers

I've never bought a truck, never really considered myself a truck person, I think mostly because of the expense and fuel economy... the tesla truck still interests me though since it is electric.."

"Well, the X does offer that insane air filtration system.  I could see someone who sees the small-arms protection as a massive bonus at the price point and just gets it anyway for the cool factor.  Hell, it's certainly cheaper than making an F150 bullet-resistant unless you like dumping phone books in between the body panels and praying."
"u/nc6it u/GelDinosaur Well if anybody can figure it out, it's probably Elon. He's hinted at a much, much more efficient battery that can ""run for a million miles"", and I can imagine there would need to be advancements in quite a few aspects of the vehicles beforehand, but anything in life is possible. More efficient batteries, more efficient solar tech out of their solar company, more efficient motors, and you can start to imagine that it could very well be possible in the near future. Even trickle charging an extremely efficient battery would result in SOMETHING. Now I'm not an expert either, but my thought is this should be their absolute top priority as a company investing so heavily in both cars and solar. The ability for people to ditch the charge stations and be able to freely travel without worrying about gaps in between charging stations is KEY in this market. Atleast in a gas vehicle you can walk to a gas station and bring gas back. With Tesla you have to bring an entire generator AND gas back, then wait the few hours for it to charge still anyways. Way back at the inception of these vehicles they atleast had an idea to allow batteries to be swapped out by a machine under the car that allowed you to get a full charge in less time than it took to fill a gas tank. They have, for now, scrapped that idea and we are stuck with ridiculous charge times and spotty charger station coverage. Of course, everyday things are advancing, I just wish they would swap their order of priorities around a bit."
"I live in an area with a lot of trucks. There's not a single person who drives a truck that I know who doesn't utilize it to get in and out of places with no roads, and haul gear/equipment in the bed, or pull trailers regularly. Just because trucks also get used for standard car errands, doesn't mean they don't get utilized in other ways."
"I mean, probably the idea is to drive somewhere , camp for a day or so while recharging then move on to the next point. I thnk that'll be awesome."
"See look at that! Ask and you shall receive! I'm sure that range increase will grow over the years. Especially with the trimotor option, the efficiency HAS to increase."
"Solar panels are cheap now days, it's the battery  what's expensive. you can even engineer a portable , maybe foldable, solar array."
I wouldn't be caught dead driving one. Honestly it'll probably kill me as I'll laugh myself off the road when I see someone drive this monstrosity and not one of their much better designed vehicles.
I think the Pontiac Aztek is a prettier looking vehicle than this.
Right? I think all the box-y cars out there are so boring. And to make this truck indestructible adds to its beauty for me
I don’t think that was actually the glass they intended to use. It was for demonstration purposes. You saw him demonstrating how the glass is bulletproof
That's because it was *real*. I kind of think this whole thing was a joke.
Tbh I'll probably cancel but with a $100 deposit eh why not.
"No I think that was charge rate (250kW) — basically that it’ll work with the V3 chargers. 

If you assume 3 miles/kWh, you get 167 kWh for 500 miles of range.  Efficiency might be worse than that though."
Take a look at Elon's facial expressions
Probably for some extra plugs
No. Sail panel. The sloped panel going toward the rear.
"If it's a truck I need to step on the bumper. But now that you mention NHSTA, what's with Elon and his hatred of sideview mirrors? Haha"
"I think it can pull 300,000. Towing capacity has a lot more to it than just power, torque, and traction."
Whats possible to move and what you're legally allowed to tow on the road are different measures
"Total Recall perhaps?

[GET YOUR ASS TO MARS](https://bestmoviecars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1981-RQ-Riley-Town-Car.jpg)"
Yes.
"Yes this is the problem. The balance of aesthetics, durability and most likely easier/cheaper cost of manufacturing is way out."
I know this may be controversial opinion but I kinda like it. It seems as if it’s function over form and I love that
"Elon muttering ‘oh uh fuggjn god’ has me thinking it wasn’t planned. Like other people are saying, prototype probably didn’t have the glass that was being tested"
[This](https://i.imgur.com/IQ1QMli.png) looks pretty pointy to me.
"Then why start out your presentation with the 1.5 million trucks sold per year stat? And comparing it constantly to the big three?

Elon thinks this thing is going to sell like crazy. I'm afraid he's in for a rude awakening."
"I agree, I just don't think the number of people who like the design, want a truck rather than a Tesla car, and have the money to buy this is high enough to justify the truck's development. But that's just my opinion and we'll have to see what happens moving forward"
[deleted]
People who actually use their trucks will stick with the big 3 and Toyota.
no one is going to use this as a work truck because that tray design is horrible
"> most people who actually use trucks for work and not to compensate for their d*** size

They wont buy your hippy half size bed (lmao)."
"They deserve a negative reaction on Wall Street for this. This is a disaster. 

The product is super controversial and they framed it entirely wrong. I can see it being a fun idea but you have to set expectations better than that. We've been expecting a real pickup truck for years. This is not a real pickup truck.

And the presentation was awful, but at this point we shouldn't be surprised. How Tesla doesn't do a better job with these unveils is beyond me."
"Not only did he barely show them, it felt like he was so distracted by the glass he forgot what he was supposed to show. Seemed like there were a few times where he was a slide or two out of sync with the spec PowerPoint."
"> Musk reads these comments and I hope he sees yours. 

I do too, really. I love what Tesla has done to the market and I want them to keep making the industry sweat. 

Nobody at Ford or GM is going to be losing any sleep over this, though."
"> So I’ll go get the new ram and revisit an etruck in 5 years.

That's how I'm starting to feel about electric cars in general right now. Once the big automakers catch up with a charging network to rival Tesla, it's over. Tesla had a huge head start but they're going to blow it with more shit like this."
"This is the same tactic Tesla did with the S and the 3 (from an engineering perspective). The S was NOT an everyday person kind of car. It was luxury. The learned from the low production run of the S to mass produce the 3. 


I think the cyber truck is a reflection of the same mindset. Target a niche audience to figure out production, then produce something for the masses. Elon isn’t stupid. He knows this isn’t a mass production car. This is the learning opportunity before they crush the competition like they’re doing with the 3! 


Thoughts on the theory?"
"Exactly. There is a niche for this, sure, but don't tell us how well it matches up against against the mainstream trucks and pretend like anyone driving it wouldn't be a laughingstock on any job site, farm, or, you know, small town."
"Oh God forbid we discuss the reveal here on this 

*checks notes*

internet forum..."
"Where do I put my ladder?

How about a 12' piece of lumber?

It's not practical. That the performance matches the other trucks is a nonstarter because the design sucks.

If they had designed a more traditional-shaped truck at a similar price point to the others it would have wiped the floor with them and remained practical. This accomplishes neither."
"You're talking about 0-60 time, but this is a truck. That's not what people buy them for. People buy them to carry things and do work, the bed is too small and the design is going to scare off the contractor market that actually buys trucks. Elon may know stuff about normal cars but it's clear his team never sat down with people who actually use trucks every day for their livelihoods, etc."
And people will buy the F150 and the Ram because they look better...
"> extremely practical

Did you look at it?

>there was 0 chance Tesla was going to win over the die hard F150, Silverado, or Ram fans.

Then don't hype it like that's the idea.

I disagree with you, by the way. A real electric pickup could beat the pants off of any of those other options in performance. A big, heavy battery under the bed? You could tow the empire state building down the street if you wanted to. People will buy a pickup truck with nuts like that. But not when it looks like this."
They said similar things about the PT Cruiser. This is the PT Cruiser of the 2020's.... mark my words!
I wish I had two more arms so I could give it four thumbs down. It's hideous.
"Right?? Even that was a bit weird for my tastes, but it would have grown on me. 

But this abomination... Well aside from being ugly, it looks nearly impossible to access the bed from the sides. Not sure who their market is, but I don't think it will be people who truly use a pickup truck for work."
"I was hoping the Tesla truck would be aesthetically somewhere between the Rivian and what they revealed, if that makes sense- like, it still looks like a truck, but with some sharper, more stylized lines. But this thing just gets uglier every time I look at it."
No it doesn’t. It looks like it didn’t render into the real world properly.
I'm sure it has a crumple zone but I do wish they had mentioned more safety features. I would like to at least HEAR them say it has a crumple zone and airbags lol
">https://www.atlismotorvehicles.com/

I agree price is ridiculous but this cybertruck looks like you had a sixth grader draw a shark with a ruler"
At least the high schoolers delivered a street legal car... Yeah great looks and outperforming a 911 but alas you will never see this design on the road.. And belive me the cyber truck will not cost 40000USD... Not with battery prices going up rather than down...
">Trucks are utilitarian, and he made this toy.

For every contractor's truck I see scratched up with a ladder rack and carrying tools I see 15 shiny, show boat, trucks that haven't seen a real load or an hour off the pavement since purchase. Trucks in the U.S. are mostly toys."
Splish splash your opinion is trash
"So, you expect to see them invest dozens of millions of dollars in a 'redesign' and retooling 'soon'...and you think THIS is a good time to buy?.....umm..."
"What capabilities? They showed searing for 6, 0-60 times, range, air suspension..."
"Because it's still a huge disappointment.  After Tesla's other great looking cars, they easily could've come up with a better looking ""truck""."
"""Because I am disappointed in it, it has to be a total failure."" Honestly, its not the vehicle for me but I think its pretty dope. I am setting aside 500 bucks a month every month until about 2026 when my daughter is old enough to drive my Cobalt and then I will be outright buying a Tesla. Probably a car but I think these trucks \*are\* going to sell well."
I can see that.  I just wish I didn't...
You thought the design was a joke and that it was no way this design so you went ahead and put in an order?
"So ugly, my ugliness meter underflowed and wrapped over to beautiful"
"Me too man, me too. Everyone is just so used to tiny incremental aesthetic improvements imo."
"It actually reminds me of Pontiac Aztek, I was just about to say that."
Probably the Aztek.
I get that but it’s still better than industry vehicles in terms of not entirely shattering
Well they should because that’s awesome
No it is not but I'll bet its far more in line with popular consensus than yours.
"Main problem is the Cybertruck is not practical. No tradesman is going to use it. Repairing stainless is difficult and costly. Making racks and material transporting equipment is difficult with that shape. Having no frame means you can’t replace the bed with a flatbed or a utility bed.

This is a truck for the overland weekend crowd, and nobody else. Trucks need to be practical first, radical last."
"Laugh, they’re going to laugh and laugh..."
"Love Tesla, hate the cybertruck design. Sorry zoomer"
Could you please stop over using this phrase. It doesn't even make sense to use it here.
"Well, no one in the market for fleet vehicles or work vehicles cares about ""cyberpunk angles"" so it's just a waste of time. This is just another toy for the rich."
I know the majority agree it's ugly.
"Just look at some of the replies to my comment. It's an objectively bad design for what a truck needs to accomplish.

How do you put a roof rack on it to carry a ladder? You cant use that bed. Tonneau cover wont work in the winter. The sharp corners are just stupid, it's a hazard if you trip into your truck. I mean, jesus."
Lmfao. It's not a practical design at all.
Only matters if people buy it 😂
I don’t think it’s a stretch to say this is the worst thing Elon has done. I hope they change this before launch
Why would you assume that. The thing is made out of sharp corners. Looks like it would puncture anything once it moves.
Motortrend says it was assembled 2 weeks ago though..
"Still legally required to have mirrors when you sell it.

And if you hit a tree, the tree sure ain't crumpling, so the Truck will still have to have a crumple zone."
"It's still federally required to have rear view mirrors. They aren't going to change legislation for one vehicle, either."
It’s probably because Elon believes FSD will be out by 2022
No one is. That's gonna be the problem.....people were excited to have a decent option for truck lovers.....this isn't a truck. This is a fucking pyramid on wheels.
I won’t
lol because you know the deposit numbers
"What “amount of people” are you referring to?  20? 50? Compare that to the Model 3 that had over 100,000 by the end of the reveal!"
"I can't even get through to the URL anymore, either they're slammed with orders, or too many people are just going their to make fun of it. I have no idea."
"""Overcompensating""

Mate, this thing has fucking granite on the dashboard."
"Millennial here, I’d rather have an electric Toyota Tacoma than this weird-ass design."
"Yeah, the Motortrend article mentions the windscreen multiple times but never mentions the other windows. And they had two exclusive visits, back when it was still a clay model and then 2 weeks ago."
Did you miss the beginning where he said the top 3 selling vehicles in America are pickups? If you think he doesn't care about sales you're dreaming
"> He doesn’t want to sell to the masses.

He dedicated a whole minute of his 27 minutes of talking to state that he was gunning for the top three selling vehicles in the country."
"Er - which specs are you talking about? 

And people will be _anything_ other than this. This is embarrassing."
"It may defend a sledge, but does it drive?"
"No but they do buy trucks to haul shit literally only once a year at best.

My source? working at a nuclear plant where 70% of the owners have a truck. All of them don't need it, it's a status thing.  They buy it just because they can."
[deleted]
It's like they took the RR Evoque and tried to make it a truck.
"All it takes is another angle.  
""Boxy, but good"" :p"
That defeats the whole purpose of the design
"Ah, yes. The age-old question of Practicality or Esthetics first in a design.. Do you think the CyberTrucks design will be modified before final release, or is the design set ins tone at this moment? I have been trying to find info on if the design may be altered before final release... If any of you nerds out there know, please let me know as well.. :)"
"according to this article, [in 2016](https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0912/which-income-class-are-you.aspx), $40,500 - $122,000. was considered middle class. It's probably pretty similar now. 

 $39,500/yr or less is, by the article's standard, considered lower class. 

while those making more than $118,000 make up the upper-income bracket. Easy, right? Just take your household income and see where you fit, given these numbers. (Big asterisks for location. this is a national number. standards will change if you're in one location vs another)

personally, I would add that anything above 50,000,000/yr is the oligarc class. 

[this article](https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/family-finance/articles/where-do-i-fall-in-the-american-economic-class-system) puts the lower class at anything $31,000/yr or less, and middle class anything $42,000 - $126,000/yr."
"> you’re in unnecessary debt

In other words: You're like most people"
Whoah I make 80k and I could and will probably fly swing for getting this truck
You're working class
"You're not in the middle class, sorry man."
I said “drastically”. Obviously it’s going to reduce the mileage some. Just wondering how much and if they’ve done any testing. No need to be rude
No I’m not a homosexual
Center console screen says what?
Who is?
"I think this might make all those military type for example marauder a bit more common after this. Having said that, this was an awful design."
"Better for the environment, far cheaper to drive, win-win."
"Upsetting kids in here isn't the primary reason, my man. Just a comment to rile them up."
"The specs are more important than the odd aesthetics, in my opinion. I'll take function any day."
"I drive an F-350 at the moment, do to my business and I love it. But I don't like the fact that my Bed is rusting, and the fuel bill. I also don't like the dings and dents from fairly minor events or the fact that I've replaced my windshield three times due to various issues, some construction accidents some road debris following construction vehicles.

I've been looking at a new truck for a while now, and this thing looks like a good replacement. nothing else out there at moment seem to address these issues.

Tesla has been in the electric game from day one, they changed the market and have proven it to be reliable.

So they had make the skin beefy. The fact that it act's like armoring is just an added bonus. Like he said, it weighs about the same as regular trucks. They just moved the weight to the outside.  


Regarding the design, I'm guessing it has to do with both Aerodynamics as well as structural integrity. Not saying they could not have made it just as tough if it were more curvy, but all those straight lines do a lot to deal with and counter act  stresses in a very predictable manor.   


All in all, I like it and am seriously thinking about replacing my F-350 with it. I have other vehicles to move my large equipment when needed now, but I will still be able to move trailers and miscellaneous supplies without having to worry about dinging up or overloading the vehicle."

"Well, trucks are generally function over form. So you'd want something similar in a never of ways, so that it can perform the duties you want in a truck. 

It needs to be rugged and have lots of cargo space, and things like that. This looks like it was designed first and foremost to look like it is from an 80s version of the future. 

Which has a charm to it for that, but that's not what people that buy trucks want. 

I could see this being a truck Musk would want. He's not a blue collar guy. He is from that generation where this is future cool when he was younger. He doesn't need a rugged truck that performs like a rugged truck does. 

He wants a fun cool toy that looks like it's from the future. 

And you know what? If he did a Delorian 2 with this type of esthetic, a 2 seater future car with functional trunk space, then that could have been pretty cool. 

But truck people need rugged trucks that will work. Not fancy pretty looking sci Fi gadgets that are gone all full of mud and dirt the first week. 

Suitable for a billionaire maybe, but not a blue collar guy."
Well are you about getting people to adopt EV or about standing out? I don't think the specs are incredible to someone who'd use this for the outdoors.
"Because there's a reason why every truck looks the same:  It's a design archetype that just works.  _This_ design is totally impractical.

Musk was _so_ focused on being ""different"" that he forgot how to make the vehicle excel at its intended purpose, which is what he's done for _all_ other Tesla vehicles.  I guess 5 out of 6 ain't bad overall though."
and fucking lock it
"I don't know if that's because they were ugly, or because they sucked shit in terms of reliability.

It's really hard to say."
"You're definitely not. I don't dislike it, and I suspect it'll grow on others.

There's a ton of trolling in this thread. Some are legit owners wishing for something different and I can respect that, however most of the concern trolling seems to be ignoring the awesome specs and focused solely on styling, and often by folks who wouldn't buy one anyway.

Btw, why is styling the most important thing on a truck so suddenly? It's got an air compressor, 120/240V outlet, 4-wheel adaptive air suspension and more cargo room than 99% of us will ever need."
"Nah, I like it too. It’s designed for so it works best. i dig that."
The pre-order website crashed. You're defintely not alone.
"Elon’s just future-proofing. It’s a blade runner car, obviously."
I freaking love it
That's not how a public company is run.  $TSLA shares were down 7% on this release.
That’s just bad business for the sake of vanity then.
Do you get shot at frequently at home depot?
"Well, at least they'll be eco-friendly now."
Don't drug dealers want inconspicuous vehicles though?
I need a bit more towing capacity and a bed.  I have a heavy boat.
"Ya fair enough, I certainly could see how it wouldn’t appeal to everyone. I personally would love to drive around in a pair of ps1 Lara Croft’s bewbs."
"Yeah, this strike me like a H1 Hummer, it is an attention grabber, it's not for everyone. In fact it is not for most of people."
If enough people want it it does. I think a lot of people are going to be shocked at how many preorders Elon gets for this thing.
"Lol ya, the $100 reservation fee was outrageous"
Not woke... literally an objective point of view on build materials and design...
How the fuck is having an opinion “woke”? Gtfo.
"This design reminds me of Sonic first design.  Lol

We should call it cybersonic."
this is the worst post i’ve seen in this thread
Automatic? I was looking forward to it. I have a 3 and was planning on ordering the truck but that design personally looks like they cut corners literally
"Most people don't want to drive a moving trapezoid, that has nothing to do with how excited they were at the idea of an electric pickup truck."
My dad likes it And says my grandpa would probably go And buy it as soon as he could.
fire your husband into the sun
Can anyone confirm if the payment is actually being processed?  I would bet there’s no transactions actually happening...
I meant mainly for this particular iteration of the vehicle.  I think there’s a strong possibility there is a more production likely version sitting in the wings but this particular vehicle looks like a one-off and most of the shots/videos on the website look rendered.
They also clearly stating they’re giving refunds on request as well.
Are a lot of people planning to run this vehicle in cryogenic temps?
Do they will be super strong after this reception?
I've heard that as well.
"Yes the ""Plaid"" powertrain is triple motor. They modified the Model S' they're using to try to beat the Porsche Taycan with this new powertrain, and it's supposed to be standard on the Roadster. Being electric motors I can't see any reason why they couldn't stick the same setup into the truck, (with a little more cooling), and call it a day."
Maybe - the triple motor thing is just beyond my personal understanding.  It’s the weakest leg of my argument for sure...
"Ahh gotcha - thanks, that makes more sense"
"Thanks, that makes sense now >.<"
"I hope you’re right.  I’d be happy to eat my words.  But until I see these vehicles on roads in the hands of the public, I’m going to be skeptical."
They are more creative than adults
The engineering concept bypassing the body-on-drive-train is also neat.
[deleted]
"I haven't seen a half ton with a towing capacity less than 9-10k in half a decade.

Most 3/4 tons are around 18k, and 1 tons are pushing 25-30k"
So y’all are crying because he didn’t make an electric F-150 clone?
"Towing 300,000lbs is possible with an f150. You just shouldn't go above like 5mph and be on a closed road or something."
Seems like you're pretty butthurt that people don't worship every single thing that comes out of Musks asshole
COPE
"The exterior is an even cut steel sheet. I imagine it would be easy to source it from tesla and then to bolt it on, in case you take damage during a firefight, plowing through a police blockade or smashing through a wall."
"“Who says that trucks need to be all wheel drive?”

I would say sales of the most popular trucks would indicate such.

You are correct, you can’t “dent it” but you can scratch and gouge it

It’s not stronger than “all” regular car glass, just some. 


It has a market, probably people that love Tesla or “future looking” concept cars.

But I don’t believe it’s gonna take away people out of their fords, especially the $39000 model"
"I wouldn’t call Tesla a proven manufactured company considering their track record. 

I have hopes for them both, but they aren’t high"
"I hope you are right, but looking at the repair shops of current Tesla’s and their driver’s self inflicted damage, I wouldn’t have much faith (family member works for a certified Tesla repair facility and used to do claims for them) 


The entry is a good deal, but it’s not gonna swing people away from their ford pickup trucks. It’s just an odd target audience imo"
"Odd, I had the US site up because I clicked that link in discord. When I hit refresh it sent me to CA site. Back to US and it's $100. Not that it matters a whole lot; I was wondering if the price was auto adjusting based on orders."
A lot of functionality is gone due to the tensioned body he talked about. Can’t put a flatbed on it or really any other body.
"I have a hard time believing the bed is even close to 6 feet. Probably have to ditch the bed cover completely if you need to transport anything that doesn't fit with it installed. This seems like it was intended for people who buy mall crawlers just to have mall crawlers, which was a terrible idea because Rivian is now going to knock this 5th-grade geometry triangle out of the park in both function and appeal."
Bed cover rolls under the bed.
What kinks?
I’m guessing down 25 to 35
I think it looks more like an Avalanche than an Aztec...?
It's polorizing.
[deleted]
I mean when he released the first teaser we didn't get to see much but it was definitely an indication that this would be an unconventional truck. Eventually people will get used to it once it hits the road.
"I'm a farmer, and need hardworking trucks. That puts me solidly as a ""truck guy"" though I do prefer cars for highway cruising. I agree, I think the Ridgeline and Avalanche are stupid as they just aren't useful like a real truck is. The Blazer was also a dumb truck/SUV that wasn't good for much.

The concepts here are exciting, I love the tough stainless body panels and the supposedly durable glass (windshields have an expected lifetime of a couple months where I live). But the truck itself is bloody awful. There are so many small ways they could improve the look of this and I'm hoping they will listen to the backlash against its ugliness.

\#1 it needs a regular grille and headlights. That blank front makes it look unfinished. At least slap the Tesla logo in the middle or something!"
lol good one
In the wonderful world of Chevrolet.com?
"I don't understand. How can Dodge advertise the over 20,000 pound tow capacity of the 3500? I don't need a commercial license to buy one of those tomorrow.

Edit: 35,000 pounds. That is over twice the advertised towing capacity of the $69k Cybertruck."
Well what result do you get when you google Chevrolet 2500HD MSRP?
Ha ha ha what?
"Fair enough. 

But when one of the biggest talking points regarding this reveal was how the torque that electric motors can produce will allow massive towing capacity, it's a bit of a farce that the top of the line model can't even out-tow competing models that cost over half as much."
Can't wait to see em on the streets
the idea of a stainless truck that everyone just wraps by default has a lot of benefits. Its like keeping a screen protector on your phone. once you get enough dings in it you just refresh it with a new one and underneath it all stays pristine. For as tough as modern trucks claim to be you can practically dent certain spots by leaning on them wrong.
It's made out of stainless steel so that's the color you get. Likely done to make manufacturing easy. They aren't getting painted in manufacturing. Easier. Also the stainless steel look likely appears more to the futuristic armageddon war tank market.
"Well, the hard angles and relatively flat surfaces suggest that they're going to shoot hard for minimizing time working the material.  Why have a 1.5m windshield at curve when you can have a flat slab of transparent aluminum that runs at an unchanging 45 degree angle almost to the nose of the vehicle?  Stainless steel over painted metal is the same decision DeLorean made for his signature vehicle for the same reasons: cost.  The dash makes the 3 look almost cluttered."
[deleted]
Hodl?
"Did you see what the unveiling was? It was a disaster. No one will drive that eye sore. It was like he unveiled ""The Homer"", with shatterproof windows....just watch....I could hear the air escape Elons lungs."
"I don't like that all the other ""models"" still sport such a tall front. On conventional trucks it needs to be big because of the size of the engine. Here it allows to be more original. And while the new design certainly is original, it's not for everyone..."
Yeah. In the 1970s and 1980s. 40 years ago.
Nice smokescreen. We’re talking about this car. This car looks like shit.
"They look nothing like this closest one would be the 
Lancia Stratos Zero and even then that has more curve and lines than this hunk of metal"
"The aesthetics are what tin the functionality... The majority of the time I use the bed in my truck, I load it from the side near the cab, and that is impossible in this truck."
Tesla Twitter link I believe
https://livestream.tesla.com/
"I meant the one on stage for pre-orders, tesla.com/cybertruck

Although it's a 429 now."
This video is private
Yikes
"yeah, but you can't pick anything up from the side of the bed. Imagine trying to unload 6x6's... You have to climb in and trip over everything in the bed to lift from the middle of the board."
Now what is the estimated cost for Tri-motor?
We're so old.
If you watched the demo of the glass of the truck then I think you would understand the glass wasn't meant to chip or anything
"The awkwardness on Musks face the rest of the show. Yeah, he's usually awkward. But that was cringe worthy. Definitely not fake."
"Dude, electric cars are much much faster than any ICE."
Hahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahaha!! You crack me up.
"You've been conditioned to think, ""A truck looks like this.""

Can you not handle different? It will look better with paint."
It literally can't crumple. That feature alone makes this the most dangerous car in the world. All those strength tests are not good features.
"No you would not. There is a reason why the old school cars that were built like tanks killed so many people. When you got hit you received all the force from the hit. The crumple effect reduces the force considerably. This thing as is, is a death trap."
"Show me here where the airbags are: https://www.tesla.com/xNVh4yUEc3B9/09_Desktop.jpg

That front part cannot hold a standard airbag and I see no side airbags as well."
I think this design was made exactly for F150 owners to hate it. It is a FU to F150 IDGAF
Tacoma here. Yep. It’s ugly.
And I own a big baron field where I used to keep all my fucks
Lol yea I guess but man 70k is steep plus the extra 7k for autopilot.
"That's the real question. I don't know. Unlikely, but I wasn't in that market anyway."
[deleted]
Pretty normal bed for a half ton truck
Unless it's a land cruiser?
"Yeah but at least you can attempt to break the windows. Elon seemed hell hent on making those windows unbreakable.

Lets present a more realistic example: Someone takes a corner too fast in this thing and flips it. There's probably a body impaled somewhere on one of those corners.  Paramedics arrive but they're struggling to break the bulletproof glass, so they try using the Jaws of Life on the door, oh wait its stainless steel, which the JoL struggle with. Meanwhile the battery caught fire,because afterall, it is a Tesla.

As it is, this is a death trap"
I imagine Rivian is relieved by Tesla's truck reveal because the Rivian has much more mainstream appeal.
"> Rivian

dude thanks. I had no idea that was a thing."
Rivian is way uglier to me.
I hope so cause Thad be dope
He didn't say it was going to be the ugliest thing ever imagined.
Not roadster
Wasn't the model 3 $1000?
"I’m sort of anti-car too.

Like cars, worked in R&D for a global car manufacturer for 5 years (will likely land there again). Drive semi-regularly but never owned a car (member of a car pool for when I need an actual car).

What I don’t like about cars is how cities are built FOR them and how that makes people take the car when they can walk/bike/public transport.

If there is no good public transport available then there really are no options though (even though I think people should just learn to walk 1-2 miles or bike 5-10 Miles)."
I have never been to the US but I never visited a country on the planet that didnt have good public transport. I know that you guys dont have that but its pretty normal in most countries. I am anti car because I grew up very poor and never understood why I can only use 10% of my city. Now I can afford cars but public transport is so great that it seems like everyones just lazy.
not all countries have been raped by the oil&car industry you know
Honestly. Who comes into a car thread to toot their own horn about being anti car and they don't care about aesthetics of cars. Stfu
What a bad ass
Except you apparently
"You and me both, but I was hoping for something that would dominate the American pickup truck market. 

...Still might, but It's not apparent to me that it will. 

I think part of the American truck fascination is with the tradition of it. Subconsciously, I think there is a sentiment like ""I drive a pickup like my pappy and his pappy before him...and it's the same basic mechanical pattern as the Deuce and a half that hauled shit to defeat the nazis.""   


The Cybertruck may struggle to fit into that tradition."
Rivian. Look it up. Great looking electric truck.
"I mean, towing capacity, ground clearance, speed, hauling, seating.

I know it’ll be the only one with real AP + a dozen other revolutionary features and lose on range over ICE."
GM noted that they are going to release their electric truck on the same day as Tesla’s
[removed]
"Tesla isn't more reliable?  That would surprise me, if true.  

Agree... this is ugly.  Still waiting for it to grow on me.  I did pre-order, just to hold my spot... only $100 to pre-order made it an easy decision.  If it were $1000 like the Model 3, I would not have pre-ordered."
Exactly. Just ask all of those people that has a MacBook Pro/Air with the butterfly keyboard where a spec of dust makes a key non functional. Flawless products.
Apple reliability has gone way down and isn't significantly better than competition in the same price segment.
"Well, now at least it can look like shit straight out of the factory.."
Popular in Iraq.
I see you did not correct both things he said
seent it
I feel the same. I'm also thinking that a roof rack and grill will fix it like immediately. Might mock one up later if I feel up to it bc the specs are so good I actually want one. I just wish they leaned towards looking cool and not like a design students concept are for a final in their first class.
"It ain't ugly, it's dope."
can't win against international pedestrian safety laws
Homologation laws and the monetary concerns behind them (expensive lawsuits) are getting more and more restrictive.. Laws of nature stay the same
Also pedestrian protection laws state clear rules for edges and radii.. Also on interior there are the same rules to to protest the driver...
[deleted]
The car may be designed but not developed.. With a planned delivery in 2022 there will be a concept and serial development phase. This is little more than a design study...
I never thought I’d read that sentence.
"That’s why I said “specifically”. If it were meant to be SPECIFICALLY utilitarian, an extension of the toolbox, then of course a lot would be different about this. I’m not referring to the specs."
I remember myth busters testing this theory a long time ago. It was actually more aerodynamic to not cover the bed.
That's where I've seen that truck before.
">  I cannot believe Elon signed off on this design.

Signed off?? He is the whole reason this cars looks this way."
Point taken. I actually liked the DeLorean.  Wired had a really good article today (11/23) about the truck and pointed out there are no side mirrors and the front lights don't pass U.S. regulations.
DeLorean that took too many steroids.
"so just to check.. you think the H1 and H2 look better than this? you think the xb from zion looks better then this? (the box suv).. are you starting to see how there are so many more obviously uglier cars out there? and people are just meming just to meme? its hella different, shockingly so.. but ugly isn't the word i would use at all.. futuristic, impractical maybe.. ugly tho??"
That looks like a Fiat after a few weeks of depressed binge eating.
You leave the Oscar Meyer Weinermobile out of this.
"exactly.. people are just looking for memes, this car actually looks pretty sleek and looks like the delorian.. which of im not mistaken was one of the coolest movie cars of all time.. but i digress ima let people meme till they see it on the streets and really start to respect it."
ok boomer..
"Dude, those Volvo station wagons could haul ass.  I almost bought one to beef up.  Only thing that stopped me was they held their value too well.  The ones I could afford had all been in wrecks."
"PT cruiser sold like hot cakes and had a run of 10 years - it may have been ugly, but it controlled that segment for a while."
Nice job ignoring reality there
"id point you to any station wagon, xb, H1, H2, and a slew of fiats... but ok 👌 whatever you say... regardless this is a very DIFFERENT and BRAVE choice for a design.. and i think its about time someone actually tried something that's not just a remix of other models already out. is it for everyone? hell no but Tesla right now isnt an Everone type of car company.. atleast not yet, i know that's the goal eventually but right now not so much.."
thanks
"You can’t run beer off compressed air, silly."
Plus 7k on all variants to reserve autopilot
That’s super competitive for a truck. At least the 40k version.
Thank you.
"I was thinking it may be somehow setup for a different torque configuration possibly?

I'm not that knowledgeable about how versatile a single electric motor can be."
"It looks like there has been some renders of different colors, and it's pretty encouraging:

https://imgur.com/gallery/hm7KL8b

Tesla should have used something like that for the unveiling rather than the plain steel."
Thank you! ordered!
"yeah, they can keep skipping you if you're next up in the queue until you're ready to purchase"
Knowing that makes the truck magically look better 😉
I’m not saying it was actually spray painted lol. It just... looks spray painted.
"Yeah, there's a certain kind of customer that would really like this vehicle.  Toyota Hilux owners in the Middle East."
I agree. It needs to be big and masculine with some updated amazing tech and be done. Not this ugly triangle box on wheels.
"It’s smart to work towards your demographic but why design something with the forethought that a lot of people will definitely not like it. The guy is great at marketing, and good at engineering but he’s not a designer"
Any party I go to is now a sci-fi party!
You should never be in a role that requires a design decision. Enjoy that wedge straight outta the 80s.
Lmao elon could slap a tesla badge on a boulder with wheels and you would still think it looks amazing
"Dude this is a truck. You know, something that's meant to carry stuff? Well based off the design alone I already know that I can't carry half the shit I'd want to carry when buying a truck. Who gives af about future if I just want to be able to carry and tow"
"So....like 16 people? 

This is giant waste of time energy effort and money by Tesla. Completely impractical....a pickup truck version of model 3 would have sold pretty nicely...."
"Normally I wouldn’t jump onto such a sharp comment, but I have to agree.
All domestic trucks look the same now, the design is pretty radical, bit it’s different and for that I like it. Design will change a bit Im sure"
[deleted]
F150 as a gas truck sure. The F150 electric will probably be right on par spec wise as this. It will probably launch at around the same time.
Enjoy your handleless greensniffer dong.
I thought it looked like what a car would have been like in 2001 A Space Odyssey.
"Had both, prefer the truck."
Technically they grow in you.
You must be a hit with the ladies 😐
Im guessing its not 500 towed miles
"I think the wheel wells look cool, the front is ok. The bed and the back look really bad imo and it needs a real roof. I’m definitely a future buyer of Tesla given I ever make that kinda money in the future. Hopefully the next iteration of truck looks a little better. I’d like a truck."
They'll just refund the money. It's only 100 bucks.
cough
Good to know. Thanks for your comment. Odd that they didn't make a more conventional two seater with a longer bed.
LOL  Sorry about that. I'm usually much better about spelling out acronyms. But I assumed people in this sub-reddit would know what it was. So much for assumptions.
The ball didnt go through is what he said
"From the drive, there weren't any screens for it"
That is not legal in most jurisdictions.  The law literally requires side 'mirrors' in most cases.
"😏, I see you with the Lil Dicky reference"
Earth go hard
"...Yeah I ran an asphalt paving and sealing business for 5 years.  We had a 2001 F-250 diesel, a 1988 Dodge Ram Cummins straight 6, a 1995 Chevy S10, and for a brief time a 1999 Ford F350 dump truck.

The main goals of a work truck are:
- Take abuse
- Be cheap to fix

I don't think we ever cared at all if we dented our work trucks.  Having a body that doesn't dent would be far, far down the list of things I would have paid for.  And bulletproof glass is ridiculous.  So I'll be honest, I don't really see a lot of roughnecks up in North Dakota buying this thing."
But why the stainless steel?  It says they found the hardest material they could.  And then put in unbreakable windows too?
To be fair the presentation before that point wasn't exactly on track.
"Maybe, maybe not.

Remember Tesla has no advertising budget.

Why did that cirque du soleil performance with the ladder take so long? 

It's the most useless feature of the truck, no one cares if it doesn't work because no one asked for it.

""Tesla's bullet proof Truck"" with a screen cap of what appears to be bullet holes (the smashed windows) will be in viral tomorrow.

It was going to appear on every automotive related outlet tomorrow regardless of this, now it will make the main stream also.

You and me both. Sadly it’s a needed feature here.
AWD is a different technology from 4WD and it is less capable for off-road.

"I see, thanks for the clarity on that."
In a tweet he said they will make a normal looking one if people don't like it. During this presentation he mentioned how vital a truck is to their mission and how many trucks are sold. That makes me think a normal looking version is very likely.

The  three motor version lists 14k towing
The 70k model says it can do 14k the 40k version Max is 7500.
"trimotor is rated 14,000+"
The top end version is 14k Ibs
Trimotor option says 14k....
Only the single motor truck has that. The triple motor goes to 14k towing
"That's the base, the 3 motor do 14000+lbs."

"Yeah.  The old army jeeps used to be used for all sorts of things, and were really cool because you could disassemble them in short order, take a tire off and use the axle to do other work, all kinds of odd things.

The fact this guy is electric means it has fewer moving parts, and could be very much more maintainable and reliable with some refinements."
"Same.  I did that and received an error, but the payment went through, and I was shown a confirmation page.  Logged in and saw the reservation... Probably just tons of traffic tripped it all out."
I am sure Musk appreciates the interest free loan for the next 2-3 years.
"Weird - I didn't get one.  I logged in this morning, and found my reservation.  So I guess all is well."
"Wasn’t it 69,000 for the top end?"

It's going to handle like a boat. Straight line speed compared to a Porsche means nothing. Are you going to be racing this thing? Maybe in the quarter mile but you won't be taking it on the Nuremberg. Completely useless comparison.
"Its Porsche, not Porche. Jesus.

"Actually in a war scenario, they would most likely utilize both. Wars might change, but the military will always buy 20X of everything.  Regardless of functionality."

You going to try and convince me that fuel is more readily available than the sun?"
"Ah yes, every military tactician knows that all wars are flight in the desert, all deserts are sunny and have nothing to do with precipitation, and the old adage “you only move as fast as your fuel” is total bull shit. I am sure parking them in the desert for days is a swell move for ground engaged troops."

Cool in a retro movie kind of way. But you wouldn’t want to be dropping any type of serious money to be seen driving around in that. It’s hideous.
The truck is fugly.
Good to see someone agrees.  Was surprised at the down vote.
No daily truck driver like myself would consider buying that. Especially for utility purposes. Seems more like it’s for weekend day trip off-roading. Not bashing just not practice for what I consider a truck to be used for.
I dont think it is
Do you drive a truck daily? For work? This isn’t practical to me for what I consider how a truck should be utilized.
"And it will have side mirrors, IIRC the Semi and Roadster 2 both didn't have side mirrors at reveal, but do on release."

"To me, the Rivian looks like something out of a 90s Cabela's catalog that a yuppie wilderness type in a flannel shirt would buy on a Saturday morning over a cup of Swiss Miss hot chocolate and an Eggo waffle. But I know there are a lot of people who still like that look.  
  
I think this truck will sell well in some industries, but I'm not sure if it will sell well for people looking for a truck.  
  
That being said: perhaps this is a great Model X alternative: 6 seats, plenty of cargo, not too expensive. Might even eat at some Y sales before they even hit the road."
The rivian looks like it has cataracts
"Yes, but not adaptive air suspension powered by on on-board compressor. The issue isn't the presence of air, it's the compression of air. Compressing air reduces the amount of water it can absorb so you're essentially squeezing water out of the air. I'm just curious if there's some sort of drainage system to collect and get rid of this water."
"Nothing at all! I'm just curious if they have already considered this and how they handle it. I drive a Model 3 now and it's apparent they put very little consideration into colder weather. Huge range decreases, terrible insulation, and a major performance hit made the car as good as a paperweight for a day or two last winter. A bit of an extreme example but we hit -13°F last winter - I made it 75 miles on an 80% charge, had to turn off my heat to get to the supercharger and was FREEZING in my car, and it took me 10+seconds to get up to highway speeds on the on ramp. I took as long as I could to merge over to have extra time to build up speed.

So I'd rather asks these questions beforehand this time, since I was caught a bit off-guard with the Model 3."

"Maybe. 
Tesla's goal is to make more cars electric. If they left Rivian high and dry from a normal awesome Tesla product then that's counterproductive to their mission.
Low order numbers of these gets investors off their back if not let's the stock stay where it's is. Em could buy more. With the truck not selling they can focus on 3 & Y while if course having a truck option to those that need the stats vs the look that Rivian has."

Getting anything out of the bed quickly. Tailgate is too tall. Tailgate looks to not have a tailgate assist. Electronic roll up bed cover is going to get in the way more than anything. The angled bed is gonna be terrible to reach in from the side. Didn't see any ties in the front for attaching tow lines. Anybody that needs a work truck won't get this. This is a suburban commuter truck that will be used like an SUV. It's a Honda Ridgeline.
You can't load and unload from all angles of the bed. You have one point of entry. That's a mega pain in the ass.

"Exactly, as opposed to Tesla's 400k model 3s in one year. Ford is definitely better at mass producing ICE vehicles but have basically no substantive experience with EVs."
like 'I get something much much much better at 1/3 of the running costs'.... yea let me think about that
"That's not true. Where do you think the buyers for the S and 3 came from? In large part, BMW, MB, Audi, etc.  

Unless you mean truck brand loyalists, then sure. But  Tesla can easily sell a shit load of these to recreational truck buyers who don't fit maybe the traditional mold. It will definitely be interesting to see who is buying when they hit the market. Tesla would be wise to blast that they're an American company to everyone who might buy one."
BMW customers were extremely loyal “car guys” until the model 3 happened.

"Completely agree. Tesla's fan base is largely composed of a different demographic of tech-type people but it's very different. There's a lot of people, particularly in the truck world, that simply won't buy anything other than a truck. Even if there's a lot of demand for a Tesla pick up, it'll be difficult for them to provide the kind of support that Ford can give them. Like it or not, Tesla's lengthy repair times would be a huge problem. Many trucks, particularly F-150's are used for commercial purposes and down time means lost business.

I'm not trying to troll, I just think this is a much tougher market."
[deleted]
lol wow. did you see this thing? ahahaha
Tesla’s SUV outperforms most sports cars; “car guys” are coming around
"It isn't 90%, but about 1/3 of all truck drivers hauling or putting anything in the bed around once a year.  

The math works out that it's almost always cheaper to just rent a truck and have a car if you're using the truck less than a handful of times a year for it's actual capabilities."
I think you are overestimating. I’m sure a lot of people in the south and flyover states aren’t into the unconventional design and aren’t really in a rush to switch into full electric.
"He’s implying they use the bed/truck specific abilities 1-2 days a year, or in other words they bought them because they like the image they present. An electric truck may not allow them to maintain that image."
I’m assuming they mean use the truck bed or tow something. I know a lot of people who only use the truck “like a truck” a handful of times a year. But I know a few who their job or pastimes have them using it every weekend.
"He said they only use it once or twice a year, as in put stuff in the bed.  Not that it is only driven once or twice a year."

Yea that was said about the Model S/X/3 too..
Where does the bed cover go? Does it need to be stored somewhere? If so it’s stupid.

"I think Elon needs to fail more. He's had too many successes recently and he's lost his humility. I thought the Model 3 ramp and SEC trouble would have straightened him out, but no..."

"It's not that he hates it. It's that he's right in thinking it's the wrong approach and anyone with that approach is likely to fail. The self driving problem is not getting solved by seeing better. Computers don't get better at chess, go, or StarCraft by getting better vision, they get better through more practice.

In order to practice you need cars going through real live scenarios. In order to get cars out there they have to be affordable. LIDAR is not affordable and looks horrible.

Edit: ok, LIDAR approach won't necessarily fail, but it will definitely take longer to train the neural network without hundreds of thousands of cars training it every day. If Tesla's vision is at 50% of what you can do with LIDAR, it's still 10x better than humans with over 20 sensors on board."

the main reason i want this over rivian is because of the truck design
We need to go full Sonic The Hedgehog movie on this truck....
It'll have a tank configuration with no windows. Just screens on the inside.
That seems worrisome if you need to escape...
"Yes I was just reading an article on this and he is Franz von Holzhausen. His Wikipedia says his title is ""Chief Designer, Tesla inc."" so yeah he also should have known that this was not going to work... Or at least been insightful enough to have seen it been done before trying it live."
Fuuuuck. This should be on top of every cringe subreddit. Why did he go back for a second helping after the initial failure. Why didn't they try that before the stage performance? So many questions??
Maybe
"So far. Do we know the specs of the major company's trucks? I know Rivian is fairly similar, but has less overall power (due to 4 individual motors)"
And no paint
Plus your dignity.
"Rivian is built for offloading and has quality production while this Tesla Cyber truck looks like some prop truck that was put together for the fast and furious series.  

Rivian also has the help from Ford which the F-150 has been the best selling truck in the US for years."
"I didn't like the Rivian design at first, especially those headlights, but after looking back at it after the Cybertruck presentation, I liked the Rivian far more than I originally did, just from staring at the CT for like 7 minutes. I'd go Rivian for a truck as of now, to be honest, despite a strong preference to have both my truck and car be Tesla."
You're not. I like it too.
The Rivian looks exactly like the trucks my stupid ass drew in the 5th grade.
"I dont necessarily like the design but I get how people can like it, so the looks arent really the issue for me. (I mean me personally it is but...). The big issue is how do you use this thing as a truck? How do I go to a yard and have a skid steer dump a load into this weird ass bed? What happens when i do dent a panel and a body shop wont touch this material with a 10 foot pole? How do I secure a load in the bed? Theres shit that actual truck owners care about that we dont know if it was even thought of because it was never touched on. I just want an electric pickup for an affordable price. I dont need to be 80s robocop while I'm at it."
I love it
You might be the only person that likes the design of this ugly ass piece of shit period.
You’re weird
Yes with reduced range. Max tow on this is 14000lbs but base model has 250+ miles while towing 3500lbs and peformance 500+ miles. I don't think model x can do that.
"3500 pounds payload, 14k towing in the CT."
"But if you are going to spend $50k on a truck, you will have to do so *knowing* that it gets 15 mpg on the highway, that it goes zero to 60 in 10 seconds, that it can be towed, kicking and screaming, up a steep hill, that it corners like a barcalounger, and that it looks like every stupid other truck on the road. This looks like it wants to eat."
I have zero expertise in automotive materials. Would it have still been unibody with CF?
"There is some quote like ""No one ever lost money from underestimating American's taste."""
"I also thought the bed design really stripped a lot of functionality. A conventional truck bed is so versatile. Things can easily hang over the side, you can put a platform on top of them to hold snowmobiles and such. The angled walls of the bed make it much less functional in my opinion. It just seems like a truck designed by people who have never really used trucks for what most of America uses them for.

But to your point of range and towing. The top level one is supposed to be able to tow 14000 lbs and have a 500 mile range. I don't think those two stats are combined though. Meaning I don't think you could tow 14000 lbs for 500 miles on a charge. Maybe I'm wrong but I doubt that it can do both of those things at the same time.

Overall if I was looking to buy a new truck I would still have to buy this one.. especially at this price it's just too far ahead. Fully electric. All the adaptive suspension stuff, Tesla's software features like self driving, etc. No paint job to worry about. No oil changes and much less maintainence in general.  Even with the weird design which I honestly don't really love.. you would be silly to spend as much on a gas vehicle."

"A rolled up window isn't gonna flex as much ad one that's only held down by a few rubber clamps. That's why I figure it broke. Still, for the ball to not go through I was pretty impressed."

"Or simply rehearse it.  If you are going to throw a steel ball at the window , do it in rehearsal first.  Everything about the presentations past and present feels like they are out there just winging it.  Even the sledge hammer was cool but it looked like he was hesitant on hitting the truck.    It felt like they had no confidence in what they were doing and you would get that if you rehearsed it at least once."
"Elon's the reason these vehicles are so popular. And can you imagine the publicity they're going to get from this? 90% of people couldn't care less that the glass broke when actually considering whether or not to get the truck, especially if promised the glass will be improved. 

Like yeah the guy is super awkward, but considering the goal here is to gain publicity and sell trucks, I really don't think a more professional public speaker is actually a good thing in this particular instance. Half the reason people buy these vehicles is because of Elon himself anyway."
"That's true over the shape of the whole panel, but in a smaller, more confined area, the metal becomes effectively flat.  So thicker metal is more resistant than thinner for typical dings and dents.  

I work with stainless a lot, and once you get thicker than 16ga it's hard to dent even with a ball peen hammer.  And if you made a car out of stainless it would be really hard to stamp any curves into it anyway.  That's primarily why the delorean looks the way it does."

"> Self driving, bulletproofing, wonder glass - it doesn't add any value yet drives up the price.

Yeah, I wouldn't have bought the model 3 without the existing capability of autopilot and the potential for self driving.  That is a substantial part of the value of the car.

I mean, sure, it saves on gas, but it will be years before I break even on that.

Being nearly maintenance free is a bigger selling point actually.  Waiting with my car at a dealer for routine maintenance is a PITA."
They need a more aerodynamic shape than an f150  to get that range you're talking about.
"I disagree with this. 

The model you propose is one that's been tried numerous times and failed. Also, successful companies create demand by offering people things they didn't even know could exist. It's a necessity for building a disruptive company that it must take risks, break new ground and build products for a future others can't yet see. 

Tesla has done pretty well with that and created a revolution in the auto industry... But this thing is something else.

I love the exoskeleton frame. Amazing. I think they went about showing how amazing it is entirely the wrong way, though. I doubt most people even appreciate what they wanted to demonstrate. The presentation got it all wrong. 

I assume it's going to have some very decent capabilities and far out features as a truck. Built in 120/220 power source and compressor? Cool. They glossed over its actual features or presented them in micro type on the screen. Bring out a person to plug in their welder and do some welding or something. Show the truck being used for truck/work stuff, not SciFi apocalypse stuff. 

It might have distracted attention from that ugly hulk sitting there because the design is a straight up abortion. Like possibly one of the ugliest vehicles ever made. Aztek ugly. It was the literal elephant in the room. 

Maybe some elements of the design are necessary to make the exoskeleton work but there's a reason trucks have looked mostly the same for a hundred years. It's the same reason shoes haven't changed much for a thousand years. Function defines form. 

If you're going to change something, there has to be a reason why and the final product has to be an improvement over the prior one. It can be more functional or it can be more beautiful but it's got to be something better. 

Tesla's got tons of room for design creativity, improvement, and all sorts of crap that advances automotive tech in the space between the F150 and the Cybertruck."
Holy fucking shit.

This is exactly why more companies are moving away from live demos. Look at Apple's keynote presentations...Steve Jobs used to always do live demos with prototypes. But now the company is massive and any mistakes would be a PR nightmare. So almost all of their feature demos are just using animated slideshow presentations.
Hubris. This is the classic icarus story.
Video are way less impressive than a live demo.
Thats probably exactly why they do live demos. Sometimes shit happens though..
"I mean, you can do it if all the bugs are worked out and you've actually engineered things such that the demo is unlikely to fail.

Ie in controlled tests you've determined that it takes twice as much force as an athlete can apply with a 20lb sledge to break the window.  Then you give some IT guy a 5lb sledge for the live demo (which you also test beforehand).  It still looks impressive but you know you're fine."
Elon's hubris probably.
Thank you!
I'm not sure I've seen Elon give a presentation where he wasn't stumbling and struggling to put thoughts into words.
"Wrong singer, but close enough. +1"
Ok boomer.
I think he was more just saying “is that the final design”
Just be thankful there were no guns.
There was no way that wasn't going to end poorly.
The whole time I was holding my breath that they didn't kill someone in the crowd.  So stupid.
Maybe the broken windows saved his life. Blessing in disguise.
We love tesla because the risks they take.
"Ever watch testing of bulletproof glass? The bullets don’t bounce off the glass without a scratch.  It looks the same as this. The material absorbs and distributes the impact without giving way, saving the integrity of what’s behind the material.   
If they would brought out the sledge hammer door, thrown the steel ball through it and then see what it does to the Cyber Truck...would you be saying the same thing?"
Good point.  Does it break from the inside? Or do the passengers have to rely on emergency services using the Jaws of Life?
"So, you have been in a crash that:    
1. Was strong enough to get the battery to catch fire  
2. And impacted in a way that prevents all doors from opening  
3. And and was strong enough to prevent you from kicking the glass out with your legs  
4. But not strong enough to get you unconscious  

I mean...that pretty edge-case."
"Well, given the drop test it is a much better glass. Shit happens. He made a joke about fixing it in post and moved on. They've got time to sort it out. Let's not forget the body is bullet proof and won't get dented."
"I mean, the glass still didn't break completely. Thats exactly what happens to bullet proof glass when its shot at."
As opposed to the freight lift gate we all have on our trucks.....
"Yeah, depends on how low the air suspension can go"
"The ramp in the presentation looks wayy more steep than the press photos on the website.

Gate smashes man
"Yeah, an ugly one. Mission accomplished."
"Funnily enough, the hummer is what I thought about too. 

It’s styling is wild and I already love it, but if I bought it, I’d be wondering if 10 years from now I was going to be seen as a guy ahead of my time as cars start to get wilder styling inspired by this thing, or as someone who peaked 10 years ago, like when you see a hummer nowadays.

Nowadays you see a hummer and assume the person thought real highly of themselves pre 2008 housing crash, and only got to keep the hummer but lost their over-leveraged McMansion in their bankruptcy."
"No need for paint shop, simple manufacturing, flat glass. That saves $"
I bit you it's just a Model S underneath. I doubt they actual tested this thing offroad
They don’t have the battery capacity to sell trucks to that audience. Yet.
"I mean I think a cyberpunk coupe or sedan would've sold better than a cyberpunk truck and just would've looked cooler in general. I feel like people who like both cyberpunk, Tesla, and trucks is a very very niche market."
We already know it will start slow until production speeds up. I doubt current truck owners would preorder a truck that will take a while to send out. By the time they get production to a faster level they may have a different design for those truck drivers. It may even grow on people.
Wtf has aesthetics got to do with regulations?
"The Rivian is a truck for people who don’t drive trucks. Aka a Nissan truck.

The Tesla truck is going after the lifted, armored aftermarket crowd which is at the core of truck culture in the US.  The ford raptor is one of the best selling premium packages of all time. 

There’s a reason if you type in any of the big 4 trucks one of googles auto complete suggestions is “lifted”.

Whether or not they’re successful is up in the air but it’s a better tactic than Rivian imo. 

Truck culture has serious, life long brand loyalty and the only way to disrupt that is to make waves - not ripples."
I guess at least it doesn't look like the Tesla semi truck/pickup concept
Really?
I can’t believe this thing is real
Lol the concepts were so much better than the real thing. Ugliest car/truck I have ever seen lol. I’m all for radical design but that shit looked like the cars I drew in elementary school. So many hard lines. No Tesla elegance. Oh well.
They do 😥
Yes 😭
"I insist, what does it matter? The presentation doesn't change the product, it doesn't make it better or worse. It's been presented. The media will do the rest."
it does cause hundreds of news articles to be published and videos to be made. it's a calculated viral marketing tactic.
"That's my point. It's intentionally bad. To get people talking. To evoke a certain response. Everything is calculated and done for a reason, not just ""hur dur elon didnt practice"". He obviously didnt rehearse at all. It's also a power move, like when you dont give a fuck in a class and just turn in a blank test."
go on...

Luckily you’ll have plenty of inventory to choose from.
And I completely disagree.
But you have to spell it differently like Polygon Kollision.
"Not the way he described it. Also, safety glass is legally required for mass-produced cars which is exactly what the truck was equipped with. Bullet proof glass is only allowed on boutique low-production cars. He said so many things that to me were like ""Well that won't pass a crash test...that's not legal...EMS can't break that glass...jaws of life will have a helluva time cutting stainless"" etc. I have no idea what I just watched honestly but most of what he said wasn't practical."
"I didn't like the way he kept crowing about how hard the steel was. German tanks were made with exceptionally hard steel. Instead of making them strong, it would shatter on impact and the shrapnel would shred people.

Hopefully it was poor word choice and Tesla isn't that stupid. Hard doesn't mean strong/good vehicle material."
"Exactly, and that's why we have crumple zones now. In fact, some OEMs have gone to aluminum which is even softer than steel. Harder skin is the opposite of what you want for safety."
hopefully I can be impaled on the granite countertop first
Honestly I hated it at first but an hour later and I completely get it now.
"Not sure if you're trying to say the Rivian is good or bad, cause the Mona Lisa is one overhyped plain jane looking portrait"
My Tesla shares did a major butpucker.
"Franz was like, fuck it. I’m out."
This.  Regular trucks are stupid looking too.  This is just alien to our brains.
End of the world preppers. There is loads of them. Also I think they will develop a normal looking truck on the same platform. Same specs but a standard look.
Damn I’m an idiot lol
Lol got it. I’m an idiot.
"Something can look odd or unfitting, without being a propotional atrocity."
They look the same because of aerodynamics and packaging.
They literally tested it like three times on glass not attached to the truck and it was fine lol
Side windows are made to shatter into non sharp pieces so the window can be used to escape from in an emergency. Having extra strong windows is arguably less safe than regular ones.
"No. Check out the order page

"For sure, I ordered the Tri-Motor."
A dead blow hammer just refers to a rubber-like coating around the head of the hammer that prevents damaging the surface of whatever you’re hitting.  It’s still a sledgehammer.
"I think it’s because his slide deck broke and nobody came in on cue. Only a master presenter could smooth over those, let alone the failed demo."

"Love the ATV, not gonna lie, but the glass breaking was a disaster to the presentation. He literally called it ""transparent metal"" and it shattered into a million bits."
"It probably matters more than you think.

Imagine you go to an expensive restaurant. The place is gorgeous, the staff looks professional, and then you get the menus and they're done in comic sans with all the professionalism of a private school yearbook. Your opinion of the restaurant is going to instantly drop. It doesn't matter that fonts and graphic design have literally nothing to do with food. Our brains instantly think, ""If they got one thing horribly wrong, what else are they going to be bad at?"""
"yea but we all know that going in, so shouldn't be surprised by it"
"Nope, it'll be a meme til the rest of time though. Just like funding secured"
They claimed it was transparent metal too. Like what’s up with this launch? Am I dreaming?
"Certification for that would have to be so difficult. You have to be certified to SCUBA dive, the certification and training for an airplane, and there's a reason no one has a personal submarine..."

[This is the render I did](https://i.imgur.com/sRJ7Ser.jpg) speculating that the teaser image would be the bed of the the truck with a Model X front. Basically the same as that Fiat.
Which is a weird marketing strategy. Even for Elon.
"On top of how embarrassing that is, Elon went from his normal awkwardness to being in shambles after that stunt blew up in his face so horribly. That was easily the worst launch event I've ever seen.. for anything."
Yeah that hurt to watch. Damn.
"Looks like 2 rows, minimal interior with typical tablet based dash, very small steering wheel, marble? styled dashboard. You can see a picture of it on the site."
"I think he was scared to keep going. Showing the interior requires the window coming down a bit. Would the window fall out of the door? Or maybe just little glass pieces would fall as he opened it. 
The presentation was absolutely horrible. I swear the 13 year old kid at my church can time a better slide show than that. 
What was with the size 8 font with all the stats? THATS YOUR BREAD AND BUTTER. 
Nobody adapted to try and save it and it was a cluster. What a shame they didn’t spend more time on this delivery."

Fucking Alabama says we have to keep it
I upvoted because it’s accurate but that doesn’t mean I don’t fucking love this design
"The model y was meh and not the ford escape-ish, small boat towing vehicle I had hoped for.

This truck design is a major misstep due to its inability to capture the core truck buying audience in america. You might get some liberal nerds in the Bay area to start driving a truck because of this, but that's about it."
I feel like they should call it the E150
"Yep. My dad is in the market for a truck this spring, and I was actually convincing him to wait a few years and buy the Cybertruck. Not anymore, and now I'm cringing at all the times I told him it would be the coolest thing ever."
[deleted]
is it complex? and you can push this thing harder than almost any other truck today
"I don't understand. It has less moving parts, and is less complex than a truck you just said you work on and upgrade and repair. I feel like your contradicting yourself out of tradition.

This thing will come stock with more torque and more robustness than you could ever get out of a truck you upgrade.

The only odd thing is the design."
"Lmfao ""You're wrong."" You don't speak for all pickup drivers, and neither do I, I'm just making a prediction that the rednecks won't exactly want this over a Ford."
Steel can’t be anodized. But it can be electro plated. Someone correct me if I’m wrong.
"It could be polished shiny as hell, lol."
I would have taken the black semi offshoot we’ve been looking at for years but smaller. This is just bad design. There were tons of things that don’t look like trucks but are cool. This only matches the former.
"SUV are outselling cars now so that doesn't really matter or make much sense.

If the Aztec didn't look like a piece of trash it would have sold extremely well.

The same idea directly relates to what sales of this CbyerTruck will look like."
"Yeah I see your point. I guess I cringe more than think it looks cool. It's like it was designed by an autistic person for autistic people if that makes sense?

That group, which also makes enough money to afford it, wouldn't be embarrassed to drive it is going to be thin I think."
"Well, doesn't it also say the glass is unbreakable?

Lol. Anyway, yeah, my deposit is in."
[deleted]
"Ahh ok, dang that's definitely rough on the wallet with that gas mileage. Hope the Tesla Truck comes sooner than later!"
Jesus christ that's fucking hideous.
They also unclamped it as they went higher so it would bounce rather than crack.
I could see them not using the super strong glass for the demo truck
Plus mere exposure effect?
Ngl it would kind of fit into that movie.
"Glass is meant to break.. If you were in an accident would you rather fly through the window while having the glass absorb some of the impact? Or bounce your neck and head off an impact resistant wall of glass with the weight of your body behind it??

Edit: Actually your head would probably go splat like a dropped watermelon."
"Everyone will talk about it for the next two years, until the rerelease of the final model."
so that people write articles and make videos about it. Free marketing.
"Yep, which is kinda disappointing"
"I know a huge amount of truck drivers (I'm a farmer) and I don't know a single one that would interested in that.

I wanted to get one to prove to other guys that electric can work/is the future. They won't even consider it with a truck that looks like that."
How do you add a roof rack? The roof goes up into a point lol some pretty extensive modifications are needed to add anything to this yoke
"Elon certainly seems to like taking risks. That has its upsides and its downsides. Without his attitude to life we probably wouldn't have had electric cars as performant as the Tesla yet and for many years. The downside is that you also cause memes about two broken windows to be created as well. Overall I think we need people with his attitude as well and I'll be keeping my Tesla stocks despite him crashing two windows in today's presentation. 

He crashed two rockets too before the third landed as intended and broke an impressive new record. I'm betting he'll succeed with his third window as well. High risk high reward."
He had confidence in his product and his team that everything was ready. Someone is probably getting let go. He hates having egg on his face. HATES it
They are showing it off??He said they’re giving test rides all night
"Okay, why didn't you buy an aztec?"
"It’s Tesla though, so who knows what they might do."
"Lol, I see incessant posts about it, but I assume it's not a real thing people do. What a terrible ""challenge"""
"Haha, the internet never ceases to amaze me. But would be surprised that anyone thinks taking one month off from orgasming is a fun challenge or less sinful or whatever the motivation for it is. It just seems like a cause without a point."
It's grown on me somewhat but it really needs a flat roof instead of that weird corner.
Update: I reserved.
Why not E-150?
https://rivian.com/
"Rivian is a competitor to Tesla designing electric trucks that actually look like trucks people want.  There’s a reason it’s been a consistent design.  PEOPLE WANT USEFUL TRUCKS.


https://rivian.com/"
"Compared to this new Tesla monstrosity, it’s more like Coca Cola being in competition with hot cups of diarrhea. He is out of his mind. This truck can only be described as completely unacceptable"
I dunno...they have quite the investment backing it up. I don’t doubt that they will bring their truck to mass production for one second.
"Rivian doesn't have to beat Tesla outright, it just has to beat them out in the EV truck market. That's their endgame."
"I’d say as a brand you’re right, buuuut if we’re talking about the truck itself, Rivian would be Coke in this scenario, they’re farther along and have a better reception to their truck than the Cybertruck so far."
I bet in a week it’s $64.99
[deleted]
"Jobs would of thrown that ball at the glass every day for a year to make sure it wouldn’t break. 

They need Steve Jobs unveilings. This was torture."
"Fuck.

This is not good."
"I think you're right.  Black would look much better.  Just have to keep in mind that stainless steel is at its best naked.  You know, stainless steel is actually a wide range of alloys.  It would be pretty cool if they could make one in dark gray."
">	Those tail lights are covered when the bed is up though.

I didn’t catch that. Seems really odd to cover them when the tailgate is up. I’ll have to go back and look.

Edit: just looked at the webpage for the truck. The tailgate isn’t cuboid (I think this is the term) like a traditional tailgate so the smaller lights are indeed covered when it’s up. Very peculiar but it does make some sense for clean lines in typical use.

Honestly I get the impression this was built heavily for the people with street queens not people that actually abuse their trucks."
"> Wait, I need to have the truck bed retracted to see out the back??

I thought you meant look out the rear window - if you want to always look out the rear window, then just always keep the cargo cover open, and you can look out the rear window just like regular pickups that don't have a cargo cover. But other Teslas have a rear camera plus side mirrors (or maybe someday left and right side rear facing cameras), so you should certainly be able to see what's behind you even with the cargo cover locked.

I like having the option to cover and lock the cargo in the bed."
I’m pretty sure it’ll be stock. We are still two years away from actual production though. I would like to say I’m in love with it already know. The truck is huge.
Dear God that is so uncomfortable
No... Get off my lawn!
"Pardon, Mako!! TY, didn't realize they ""upgraded"", just a quick DDG search for reference."
Source?
"Truck drivers have some incredible brand loyalty. Tesla's only chance is to strike while the market is empty to poach buyers. By the time they realize this thing is only gonna sell to people buying it as a toy, Ford, Rivian, and possibly others will have released electric pickups and gobbled up much of the market."
"I’ve not been a fan of Tesla’s “normal” looking cars, so for me this is refreshing. I love Lamborghinis. I love DeLoreans. I love Baja trucks. This brings them all together for me. I want one."
What are you going on about. It's one of their most lucrative lines
"I'm in absolute shock. The thing looks horrendous. They have so much automobile truck history to look at. Utilizing electric motors and frame advantages to morph the traditional pickup structure into something ergonomic and powerful could dominate the industry, Cater to the lightweight trades and heavier trades, like a ford transit tesla and an f150 tesla. Just in shock that the company let this design see the light of day.

Edit: this one event makes me feel vastly different about Elon's decision making"
"We?

Start your own company if you don't like it. Lol"
"Also, mocking truck brand slogans, ""Built Tough"", etc only to smash both of the windows. That's going to be the headline, not the impressive specs. If this thing is remotely successful, it will be entirely in spite of the design and launch event, because both are spectacular failures."
"> You win them over with the specs. 

He should have just started with the specs. Like compare it side to side with the other trucks, and the price, and then do like an estimated cost of gas or something/year or something? Then bring it out."
"Same here.    

I also own a 70k f150 and I’d switch. 

Tailgate goes down to the ground. No more unloading job boxes, lifting job box into bed, reloading job box. 

110v outlets for power tools. No more need for generator power on construction sites. 

Really the only downside is you can’t reach over the side of the truck to reach into the bed.    


Some serious game changers here for construction.   


Everyone thinks it’s hideous and no one is going to buy it. Construction companies are going to be saving a fortune on fuel."
Whoa! So what exactly would make you switch? Is it mostly specs?
"This is the internet, he wasn't going to make any deposits let's be honest"
"Oh, sorry I misunderstood then."
"I think whats more likely is the glass won't shatter on a testing rig, but it will when it's fixed in a door frame."
"I mean that's not the only or even main reason lol, it has to do with safety of the occupants in the event of a crash, tiny glass pieces are a lot safer than sharp ass glass shards that happen with annealed glass. But ultimately you're right. That person is either ignorant or a Tesla apologist."
"Well, I suppose I was trying to make something more suited to my tastes.

I think the design is fine as a new market niche vehicle, but not as a truck exactly.

I was more disappointed at the lack of size and space. Since it's electric and he was talking about building the truck off of the semi, I was looking forward to a monstrous vehicle in which I could basically use it like a mobile command center on overlanding trips..."
"I was excited for this too, But hard pass."
What sort of changes would you recommend?
For 100$ why not.
"Tell that to all the armchair car execs. , shareholders and automobile design experts in this thread."
"Like PositivelyNegative said, once it becomes a status symbol, you can get away with a lot of weird designs."
There are serious functional issues with this design. Specifically with the bed. The triangular side panels on the sides of the bed are 100% non functional and hinder the function of the bed. It’s the mistake that was made with the Honda Ridgeline and well known
"Text her an image with the ""tent"" on the bed, and mentioned she could get a/c when we camp while I was at work the next day. Recieved ""sold"" reply in 10 seconds."
"I pre-ordered mine. Didn't indicate it then, but I wouldn't be the slightest bit surprised if it was announced later on. Still worth the pre-order!"
My bad
Reactor on wheels /s lmao but nah you probably right
And presumable tempered glass would have allowed for a way for the passenger to escape or police to rescue the person inside?
"Nah, I’m good.

Ignoring the live demo fail, the problem with advertising the side panels can withstand a sledgehammer and the glass is super tough is that it will encourage people to recreate these tests once the Cybertruck is seen in the wild.

You know how there have been all those Sentry mode videos of people keying Model 3s? Get ready for the same sort of thing with the Cybertruck, but with people kicking the doors and throwing things at the windows."
Doubt it. I don’t think they tested on the actual vehicle. They also shouldn’t have even bothered with the glass thing because nobody cares about bulletproof glass
"The design isn’t practical as an actual truck.  

The same way that BMW and Mercedes SUVs are glorified grocery getters, this is targeted at nerdy fanboys who want to point to a spec sheet but have never worked with their hands."
"Scroll down to the sales sections:  
  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Corolla  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Civic  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Elantra  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forte  
  
The compact car is a huge segment that should be tapped. For example even in the US where cars are dying Toyota sold almost as many Corollas in 2018 than BMW sold CARS in 2018: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bmw-reports-december-2018-end-214300460.html thats why Tesla should make a compact car."
Cheap as in low cost.
"Hey,

It's me the guy who e-mailed you after the moron above mailed you a letter. Where's my cut?"
It makes it finally feel like the 'future' with that look
Really appreciate the thoughtful/measured response. Got more than a few messages that we're less than polite lol.
"Yep. That's definitely the target market. Camping, skiing, DIY home owners.

It's not a truck for tradies, I'm a bit disappointed tbh but given their production constraints (even with giga 3 &4 online) it's probably a good thing."
"You are correct - even on the older models I've been looking at.

So I looked around a bit and realized the reason I thought that was that there are nearly zero used ones available - because it turns out they don't fit in standard depth garages with the 6.5ft bed.

That's not to say they don't exist, but I think they're really rare in most markets. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/f150/comments/2znlf3/hard_to_find_supercrew_cab_with_65_bed/) says there were only 4 available in the whole state of CA in 2015."
Dude update us. We need the deeeets
ask if the window at the rear of the cabin rolls down or comes out.
The body panels were bullet proof somewhat. They just said the glass was really strong. They never said it was bullet proof. And the break pattern suggests it still meets the typical post shatter response.
Oh nice. I stand corrected
"With the bed covered, it CANT have a rear view mirror... it'll have to be on the screen.

But no side mirrors either. This truck assume FSD."
Range seating and towing capacity excetera. Hell yeah on all the amazing suggestions. Hello car payment...
Better hire a real man with a real truck
Aftermarket ladder/lumber rack? They look terrible on any pickup truck.
Is that not dangerous though? Aren’t card built with a crumple zone to better protect passengers
"I think it will be ok. Trucks don’t need to look good. They need to be functional with nice interiors and comfortable to drive. The new Silverado is absolutely hideous and the RAM was ugly as shit for like 20 years and people were still buying them. 

For plenty of people - particularly the ones who spend 50k+ on a truck - the full size crew cab truck is the new minivan. Drive the family around in comfort, throw the kids’ sports gear in the back, haul some stuff back from Home Depot on the weekends. That’s who this truck is for. Too many people on here think the typical truck buyer is some MAGA redneck who uses it for work. Work trucks are like base model white trucks with steel wheels and a plastic interior. The big 3 manufacturers basically give them away with cheap financing under the company’s name. Meanwhile, suburban dads are dropping as much on a truck as they would on a Cadillac because it’s cooler than a minivan. 

This butt ugly cybertruck checks all the boxes and more. It fits 6 people, hauls some stuff, can pull an RV and has a comfortable interior. On top of that, it’s fast, has autopilot and it’s much less expensive to operate than a gas truck. It works for me. I have a model 3 because I want one and I have a truck because I need one. If I could only afford one it would be the truck out of necessity. Now I can get one of these and have the best of both."
"You should probably read their mission statement, there isn't a single word in there about being profitable and making money for shareholders"
That’s an incredibly narrow-minded view of what companies and investment can be.
"I loved the ATV, and legitimately want to know how to order it, but the truck is terrible. Leave aside the aesthetics, it's terrible from a functionality standpoint. The high sidewalls render the bed useless from any point other than the rear. Notice how they also didn't show any shots of the interior, which leads me to believe that it's not at all comfortable."
Lmao. I have one of your wraps on my Model 3 by the way. 👍🏼
the only explanation
not sure where you live but in rural american trucks are still used as trucks.
"This isn't really marketed to working professionals. I don't know if you've noticed, but the pickup market took sales from the old landbarge market. Half of all truck sales are luxury status symbols that never leave pavement.

Hopefully Elon adds another, more fleet orientated model, to serve the other half of the market."
"It is going to sell cause there are always people who like it..

But for me it's ugly... Looks like something I've seen on mad max or halo.

I don't even know what to say. I guess that's why it's the cybertruck and not a regular truck?"
Wrong. People are test driving it now. Way to talk out your ass.
"Confirmed, the people exiting the vehicle were actually sitting on milk crates, if you look closely they actually use their feet to push the truck through holes in the floor."
You didn't watch our read or learn anything about what happened tonight did you?
At least the victims won't hear it coming?
[deleted]
"Exactly. This chassis (or exoskeleton?) is basically sheet metal fabrication, and is 100% a huge factor in the truck's low price (base model is $10,000 cheaper than Elon had originally claimed).

He delivered exactly what he told us he would.

Teslas are head turners, especially this one!"
[deleted]
"Big difference between $150 and $70,000"
"Well at least we agree on one thing. 😆

As I said elsewhere I’m still hoping this is a joke.  I’m actually not a fan of the semi truck either, but then I’m not the target audience for that."
"> Maybe tesla is assuming that the material is strong enough to withstand low speed collisions?

That energy is getting dissipated *somewhere.* It's either getting used up crumpling the body or getting transmitted into you."
It helps you not look like a joke and reduces drag
"From last year:

> It’s like I really wanted something that’s like super-futuristic cyberpunk. Which, if it doesn’t ... if I’m weirdly like ... if there’s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we’ll make a more conventional truck in the future.

"Idk hummers aren't practical by any stretch of the imagination, but this thing looks like you could get some work done with."
I am just extremely upset that this design will not work for me and I wanted Tesla to build a real truck for people that use trucks. Rivian is priced for the 1%. My Hope's are that Ford just replaces the ICE in the current F150 model and I can replace my 15 year old truck with that.

Dammit it just went private...
"clearly :) 

I like that it's so bold and different though."
"I know the US is getting closer to allowing rearview cameras in place of mirrors, maybe Elon assumes that it will be ok by the time the truck starts being delivered :)"
"camera's are ok, some other vehicles have done the same thing"
Probably not by 2022
"Fair point. I have no idea how much the force of that kind of impact spreads. Honestly, I was freaked out watching it wondering if the door would be fine but the hinges would get wrecked."
"What would help them on that is if the suspension lowers it so you can reach over.  But like, say you want to put a tool box in near the cab.... difficult or not possible...."
"They’d be locked up there, as well... good point."

"I bet it will exist well. I would buy it. 

Kinda like a lambo hooked up with a DeLorean one meth filled night and the kid has been going to the gym."
I have to say I’m skeptical of that. I don’t love the look of this thing. But I’m probably buying one. It’s a hell of a truck. And we haven’t even seen the interior.
"Yeah that’s why nobody bought any cars in the 80s.

There are many cars that disprove that axiom. I don’t think my Volvo is ugly, but if I was buying for looks it wouldn’t have been my first choice."
"At least the base model, according to google. All I can find on Ford.com is a misleading “up to.”"
Hmm. You could be right.
Ya. Rear visibility looks nonexistent
We are watching the posts come in and as of right now. There is nothing good. You will hate for us to open it back up. I have seen about 30 screenshots of order confirmations from the truck.
"Something’s up. I’m wondering if we won’t just see the truck released.

What if there’s a lightweight aircraft that’s going on sale too?"
"I believe I read elsewhere that he intends to sell a more normal-looking truck in the future. Who knows if it's true, or when it will happen knowing Musk time. But I would hope they push out a statement very quickly that they will also build a normal electric truck soon for the sake of their stock.

The specs are amazing, way better than other trucks, but imagine hauling anything with it. Weird cyberpunk hard-edge truck pulling a normal trailer is just bad looking. It looks alright with the trailer in the images, but most people don't own cyberpunk trailers...."
"I mean, isn’t that his point about “the same for 100 years”?"
"I guess we'll know tomorrow (or whenever they'll publish the numbers). Design is polarizing, I agree. I'm not a pickup guy, would never put one in my driveway and yet I pre-ordered one as soon as I could. I think this is going to appeal to a lot of people outside of the typical truck community."
"My ass. 

I'm just assuming it's a new line so their production quantities will be limited, at least to start."
"""Now, Lee Iacocca cut corners wherever he could, but even he knew enough not to make you feel crazy asking for a key. What kind of car company cant afford to make a darn key?"""
"People said the exact same thing when they unveiled the X’s falcon-wing doors (insane at the time), or deleted the whole dash out of the 3 and put just a screen in the center (I believe the line was “go-cart with an iPad).  Innovation is hard for people whose minds are like you and me—that’s what makes Elon so special. As far as I’m aware, he has not invented or engineered one single thing that was not a successful product. 

I hear your concerns and I have the same instinctual feeling you do.  This is too out there, people won’t get it. But then they’ll see what it can do, and a buddy in the job site will have one, and he gets all the attention, and it’s under $40k, and it’s cheap to run, and it’s bullet-proof, fuck, yeah now they’re everywhere and we’ve come full circle.

Until the next crazy idea Elon has is unveiled and people just laugh him off."
"Ram, Silverado, and F-150 are the top three best selling vehicles in the US. Not the best selling trucks, the best selling automobile. 

For the first quarter of 2019, the Silverado out sold the Rav4 (3rd and fourth overall) by over 20k units. The F-150 sold over 214k beating the Rav4 by 120,797 units. People want trucks. 

 I'm all about breaking convention, but this is not just breaking with convention. This belongs on a movie set, and the overlap in current truck owners and those that are interested in something this radical is in my opinion not a viable market. I think Rivian has the design sweet spot nailed here. I also think a lot of people just want a truck that has the spec sheet we saw tonight."
Then why did he start the presentation by specifically bringing them up?
6.5 feet
"More ground clearance isnt necessarily a good thing if you're getting things out of the bed while standing on the ground. Its also a very bad thing for parking it in a garage, much less a parking garage. 

Faster is largely useless on a truck too. More towing capacity is worthless without mirrors, because you won't be able to maneuver the trailer. 

This is a great example of knowing your customer and market."
"I have one in mine, it wasn't that much to add on."
"I love the s because it looks like a badass car. 

Never liked the look of the x,3 or y because they seemed to be trying to be different for the sake of being different. 

I'm actually excited to see what Ford does with their electric f150."
"That will happen regardless of how many Cybertrucks sell that year. Telsa is production bound, not demand bound."
"And I said that 12,000 is the max available.  Because it is."
"The F150 is 12,000 max.  The Tesla is 14,000 max."
Cool! Let me know what the random number generator says.
Awesome!
Woohoo!!
He just keeps going.
Yeah I should have clarified - Model 3/S/X reservations were refundable up until they changed them to $100 down.
Yea I feel like the guy that threw the ball was kinda in on it I got weird vibes from him.
I doubt it’s real granite but probably the same material as the white 3 interior with texture.
"You and someone else commented at the same time. 


I doubt it’s real granite but probably the same material as the white 3 interior with texture."
"Someone linked a pic of the interior, and what the truck looks like while camping with it, in this thread. Ctrl-F ""camping"" should find it."
"Well yeah, they haven’t exactly started making them yet. There will be tweaks before it actually comes out."
Pretty much. You pre-order and put $100 down to get in line. Refund if you change your mind.
Tell that to the person I responded to lol
"A Silicon Valley IT professional who likes the feeling of protection and available power. I kid you not, go to Hackernews and see them being very impressed with this. 

Cybertruck is a niche vehicle. But it will be wildly successful in that niche."
They don’t ask me. Elon literally said word for word that this could probably be their ‘worst selling vehicle’ and it ‘won’t be for everyone’. Kind of weird that people are so taken back to be honest with you.
"I think because the people who are designing these ‘solutions’ to the problems of modern trucks have never worked out of a truck a day in their life. Most people who have a true need for a truck, use it like a tool. Tesla designs their cars like the latest tech gadgets. 

Towing capacity is impressive but I would like to see how range degrades carrying anywhere close to that load in a real world application. Also, many of those same people aren’t going to buy a truck that they can’t work on themselves. The only way I can see this vehice working is it there are some hidden quality of life features other than being ‘durable’. 

The most likely scenario is that this will be a status symbol vehicle akin to a range rover, for people tech saavy people who also want others to know they one time went to home depot. Outside of that I really can’t see anyone who would buy a truck for real world use switching to a first gen ev that looks like a pinewood derby car."
"like who is the expected consumer for this then if not the typical truck buyer?

Tesla fans of which I'm sure there are enough to exceed the production abilities of Tesla atm"
"I’m sure they will release a truck in the future that will absolutely dominate the truck market but This specific vehicle wasn’t meant to do that. They definitely don’t have the capacity to produce vehicles like that anyway. They will be focused on the Model 3/Y for the next several years, which is definitely the best business decision they can make. Not to mention they still need to get the Semi going."
"yeah you guys have some interesting businesses over there, that one cool South African posts car recovery and stuff like that and are fully armed and everything"
"people keep saying that they proved themselves with 4 cars already, and i believe this is a damn good reason to think this one will be safe too."
They're definitely not redesigning the whole thing
"It’s a PR stunt whether the car is ugly or not. When Ferrari unveiled the Enzo, that was a PR stunt."
Dammit Grif!
And the Pontiac Aztek.
"> this isn't like anything you've seen before.

A lot of people are saying it's a lot like an Aztec.  I would say Avalanche.

Either way, ugly vehicles."
Some of us want to.
That’s literally what people have been saying about Tesla for the past 10 years.
"Should watch the videos from inside, bed looks rather large."
Can you fit a sheet of dry wall in that bed? What about other materials like 2x4s? Plywood?  No?
"Not at all utilitarian.  Trucks are designed around the premise of having multiple configurations like cab and bed sizes.  You can't fit a sheet of plywood in that 'vault'.  Nor can you access anything in that bed except from the tailgate.  Not every truck needs to fit 6 people, that is why smaller cab configurations exist.  Its also why you can buy trucks with 8 foot beds."
"* You're not going to be able to spray rhinoliner or put a stock plastic liner in the bed.
* There are no post holes for tie-downs or post-hole-compatible add-ons.
* There aren't really any bed rails at all.
* The shape of the sides of the bed make it shit for dumping material like mulch, dirt, etc. into. 
* Sides of the bed additionally make it pretty shit for putting shit in or taking shit out.
* Sides of the bed constrain ability to haul things slightly wider than the bed. 
* Looks like you're pretty screwed for putting a plow on the front of it or a standard-configuration salt box.
* Can't fit a rail-riding toolbox, welder, or gas tank in there (the gas tanks are typically for fueling other equipment.
* Bed is a part of the truck body, so you can't switch it out for a flat bed, presumably can't cut it apart to incorporate a fifth wheel hitch.
* Because the bed is a part of the truck body, if you dump something in there too hard and too fast, you'll damage the truck body from twisting.

Sure, it can tow 14,000 lbs. but the people that do that regularly already drive F-350+ or 3500+ trucks with fifth-wheels which you can't (presumably) put on the cybertruck. People who use a truck on a jobsite day to day would have a hell of a time trying to do their jobs. Look at the Honda Ridgeline as an example. People didn't just ignore it because it looked weird and had a short bed. It was incapable of doing anything but hauling people and coolers. This is the big electric Honda Ridgeline.

I didn't intend labeling you as a lover of particular art styles or referring to you as an extinct species to be a serious insult. My bad. Perhaps that came off a little dickish.
That's a pretty low bar to strive for.
I like the way you compared it to professionally designed cars. It implies this is not.
That's very charitable.
At least in the Porsche drag race video it’s the same truck. I guess I’m not sure about the others
"But the point of Tesla is to combat climate change, so getting people to adopt EVs is their main point. This ugly ass truck isn't helping in that department."
Shareholder's don't care about inspiration.
Did you read his list? My f150 doesn’t have any of that stuff
Loose is the base word; don't play semantics. The fact that adults get loose and lose confused is pathetic.
"Honda learned their lesson, as did Chevy with the Avalanche... The Ridgeline looks just like the GM twins now"
Why isnt this functional?

"But they aren't literal triangles. If Tesla wants to accelerate sustainable transport and compete with Ford, they can't build an actual triangle, they have to build a vehicle that looks like it isn't the ugliest thing I've seen in my goddamn life.

This will be Tesla's worst-selling vehicle and it deserves that title. It blows my mind that we're going to invest capital in this shit when we should be putting it towards more gigafactories and ramping our cars that are going to change the world"
Lol me too
"It's a similar size, it's not notably smaller, even when compared to the more aggressive raptor that you pictured.

>Will either fit in your garage? You tell us. The Cybertruck measures 231.7 inches long, 79.8 inches wide, and 75 inches tall. The F-150 is offered in several body styles, like we mentioned, so its footprint varies from model to model. It measures between 209 and 250 inches long, between 80 and 86 inches wide, and between 75 and 78.5 inches tall.

https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/tesla-cybertruck-vs-ford-f-150/"
yeah I remember watching a video about that in my middle school tech class. maybe the front crumples?
"trying to find the source, saw it under the cybrtrck hashtag on Twitter ugh



might not be reputable but it definitely makes sense"
"ok then I'm wrong, not sure why there's literally no bends in the entire design then. My bad guys, the internet got me this time."
"Maybe for people in the truck, good luck to pedestrians and people in small cars I guess?"
[deleted]
"Perfect, thanks! Looks like a beast."
"Devil is in the detail , it might be fine for a nail gun or some other low duty cycle tool, but will need a higher capacity compressor otherwise.

It's the main cause of air suspension failures in Mercedes and similar cars, the airbags leak and the compressor runs too often and dies."
Maybe they thought F150 is too strong to go against with similar traditional design and usual Tesla advantage will not be enough. Who knows. Maybe it needs another disruption to tackle F150. One other thing is this whole unibody/exoskeleton is quite easy to manufacture it seems.
"Polarizing can be good. Free advertising. Also, if people openly hate on the thing... well people love the underdog."
"Not worried per se, just annoyed it’s not a simple YouTube stream"
"I love the first, and kinda like the third.

instead of looking at a truck, I'm watching elon try to smash metal and glass?"
"They had clamps for the other glass panel too. Even if it does, it still held up much more than the “standard” glass"
No.  That started with the Model 3.
Same. The empty rear fender gives it that look
US Law still requires production vehicles to have side mirrors.
“It’s an urban assault vehicle!”
oof
"Yeah, saw it"
"Oh man, if the design itself wasn't bad enough, that just puts the cherry on top. Tesla haters are having a field day today."
"Stick your finger in your eye right now. Dont worry, its not sharp."
"It's just plastic film.  Once the glass is broken, which it is easily with any mineral harder than tempered glass, it's just a matter of cutting through the film."

Backing of a company who has been selling a million trucks a year for 50 years and daddy Bezos. I think they're fine.
"Aside from the charging infrastructure, do you REALLY think people will be buying the Tesla over the Rivian for 3k in towing (and that's only on the very top trim, which will likely be close to 100k).

Nobody gives a rats ass about ground clearance. It's not a Jeep.  

How a car presents the owner is the single biggest driver for buying these expensive toys. Rivian wins hands freaking down in this. So disappointed in Tesla."
[deleted]
"Dude, it looks like the warthog from the original halo?! This thing is trigging nostalgia for me!"
It’s ok.  You want everyone to hate it.  You will change your mind.  You still want a big grill on your truck
The new Honda Ridgeline even did away with that
people that actually work for a living
Thats fair
"All five of them.

Tesla's present goal is mass appeal because their profit margins are so low ($200 in some cases). 

And this is literally the opposite of mass appeal."
"You’re spiking the football to the wrong person.

I’m a shareholder."
Late 2022? Seriously? That's 3 years from now. Only Elon would unveil a product that won't be available for purchase for another 3 years.
Ah makes sense. Thanks.
If the exoskeleton replaces the traditional frame what happens when you are in a fender bender?  The frame is compromised and the entire vehicle has to be written off?  None of it makes sense.
"Lots of cars started out ugly, or had fugly model years."
“I can see the future for myself and my peers”
"Look at the prices too for the Rivian. Someone will compare the specs but it looks to me like the R1T will have 230 miles of range for $70k. 

The Cybertruck will have 500 miles of range for the same price, plus 2x faster 0-60 and more towing range than the maxed out R1T. 

The price is incredible."
Nope but there are a few that’ll make the back wedge look better. Already testing things.
That ain't it chief.
Might not be Franz's fault if it was someone else who told Elon it was okay to throw the ball.
I just went back and rewatched.
Don't really agree. I think the younger crowd will love the design.
sounds perfect!
"Yeah I don't think they're trying to appeal to the broader truck market with this. Elon pretty much said this was going to look dramatically different: ""it might be too futuristic"" and ""not everyone is going to want it"""
What do you mean?
Not like from the real 80's. like the 1970 vision of the 00's. if it looked like it was from the 80's it would look more like a Nissan Gobi.
Are you taking bets?

Last time when it started it switched to YouTube.
"Behind the second seat row, obviously. It just has the cover on."
I'm actually embarrassed for being a Tesla fan after this
"hell, if they make the navigation/TTS-voice either into EDI or Urdnot Wrex, I'm ordering two of the damn things"
"Oh, I missed that for the truck, but the $100 for the cars are not refundable."
Thanks! This is my first Tesla order; they finally pushed me over the edge.
Yeah I feel he's trying to keep costs down by keeping as much of the production in house. He makes almost all of the materials in the Tesla/SpaceX family of businesses. That's why it's cheap.
It's not too bad. The live stream was choppy for me too so where are you going to find a non choppy version?
That’s the one I watched and yeah it’s pretty damn choppy
Yeah... Honestly it'd be interesting to have a super crazy looking vehicle like that on the streets. Everything looks so boring these days and ibcould care less at tgis point what something looks like lol.... Although it severely hinders the truck's practical usefuleness to have angled bed rails.
"Well to start, they already have over 200,000 preorders. At $100 each, they’ve already recouped at least $20,000,000.

Next we have battery development. There have already been amazing advancements with the past few years, and Tesla just acquired two battery start-ups. So the cost to make said battery will be going down by the time this hits production. That’s apart from typical advancements they make on the assembly line.

So yeah, I’d say it’s a pretty safe bet."
"Avalanche too. 

One thing the Ridgeline and Avalanche had in common: they were shit trucks."
"It’s definitely useful to be able to reach over and tie things down, but I agree, it’s nitpicking."
"It all depends on what you use your truck for. If you are just hauling stuff that isn't too tall for a canopy, and don't need the toolbox, then a canopy works great. 

If it's a work truck or personal truck carrying lots of tools and equipment, some of which won't fit with a canopy, then an open bed with a toolbox works best. 

With normal trucks you have the option, the cybertruck somewhat limits you. That limit might not affect you, but it will affect all those who use those side access toolboxes, and I know plenty who do use toolboxes like that"
"Even so, the great thing about that toolbox is you can access it from the side of the truck. The bed could be full of stuff and you can still get to your tools. That isn't the case with the cybertruck."
Maybe. But it will cost more. And it will require you to jump into the bed from the back instead of just reaching the box from the side. Not practical in other words.
"I see more trucks with those toolboxes and no topper than trucks with toppers. I think this is especially true of work trucks, which Elon is trying to market to with the air pump and power generation features.

Where you live, and what you use your truck for probably has a lot to do with how you customize it."
"Are they developing their own bulletproof glass? If yes, why?"
I am now concerned by Elon's feminine body language
Silly ass niggas
"Hahah, I’ll be honest, I was just trying to make a pun. But yes, I imagine they would."
"Recall that the truck is designed as more of an exoskeleton. Instead of the collision hitting a super thin piece of sheet metal and then a structural member, its just hitting something a bit stronger sooner."
Its metal glass
Agreed. The presentation was not very fluid. I saw it in a photo in the background during the presentation but the website doesn’t even have a photo of it....
Build quality?.. you could see Elon’s disposition change entirely when both windows broke. Ugh.
More $100 preorders?!? To fund what?
"HELL YES, Halo violin popped into my head instantly after seeing that notification, thank you."
Pending Apocalypse
That's what I appreciates about you.
Don't they do a dry run first for these things?
"it is the other way for the first one, but for the second one it's franz taking the initiative."

"Just like the seagull doors, these designs are not for the faint of heart. On the other hand, I can imagine driving this, but I would never buy a regular shape pickup truck. You can say Tesla opened this market segment for me."
"Or a ""do no wrong"" attitude towards Tesla as a whole."
"I don't own Tesla stock and can't afford it, (I drive a 25 year old Dakota) but I like the look, it's actually futuristic and fairly practical arrangement for a commuter vehicle that sees weekend hauling and maybe towing a camper a few times a year."
I can also hold a full sheet of plywood in mine...and haul an atv without nearly bottoming out my suspension 😂
Same way they started towing / pulling the truck in the demo.  They will have a hitch package. Hell I can get a hitch for my model 3.
">I really don't think the looks exude ""utility"" as you say.

what i mean is they chose the trade offs in utility with the look. the truck's manufacturing method and material made this look a limiting factor. yes it's cheaper to manufacture but also cheaper to maintain and i guess we'll see the true value of it once other trucks come out. if they can match tesla's price and performance but looks better, i would be surprised. i'm guessing the decision to release a car this ugly was a very difficult one for them and they thought carefully about it. after all, they know what a good looking car looks like. they were the first car manufacturer to release good looking evs."
That wasn't my point. I was just referencing when.
"Loosing is indeed a word, but it's not a synonym for losing."

It is though. Loose your mind lest you lose it!
Lol! Which bumper stickers and decals should come pre-applied?
"It would be easy to promote. Tesla could just say, “We listened to our customers and learned that they also wanted a more conventional truck”...

I wouldn’t be surprised if they already have earlier designs for a more conventional looking version that they could rework and build a quick prototype."
"The pickup specs are way better, if you can get over the looks then the pmtesla is a better car. I personally dont like the rivians headlights but everything else about it is good and id take it over the tesla."

"the ""bed"" looks fucking retarded"
"Those comments sound so fake and fabricated. Don't be so naive. No guy who has a 2500 Ram is going to run and get an edgy ass back to the future looking ass truck so everyone can call him Marty. How do I put a ladder rack on that bitch? Its so hideous. Like i said, Dan Belzerian will get a hard on over it and will surely drive one around and it will be all over instagram and maybe there will be a few buyers. Ill be fucked if a contractor buys a fleet of these things for job site work. I really hope this is satire to build hype because elon is fucking crazy and the actual truck is coming..."
 My dude you've been duped by a Tesla ad in the form of a comment. LOL
"That’s what I said about that triple camera system. Then it grew on me after a while. I also never said apple would design this truck, their design languages are completely different."
"You have a point, but I still feel like they lost the majority of their target market by working to be too advanced in design. 

Don't get me wrong, I hope to god this will sell. Maybe once it gets on the roads more people will adapt, but for now it still looks terrible."
"If it's sealed now it would stay sealed. Liner isn't supposed to seal it, it's not a hot tub, it needs to drain."
"As a unibody design, that may be one of the few commercial applications it will be good for. Have they said anything about bed shells?"
"yeah, that's true. I was hoping for some wide ride height variability. I knew they would want it close to the ground for speed, efficiency, and handling. I was hoping for like 2ft of ride height adjustment and a motor on each wheel."
there is some crossover still. but they're clearly going after the weekend warrior than the local handyman
"People who ""do actual work"" will either buy this truck and have it modded for their needs (like you would any other truck... bed liner, hitch install, etc) or buy something else. Nobody is forcing you to do anything.

At least this truck will run my welder. Not a single truck on the market will do that."
">None of these thing where loved. They where mocked and seen as íniche products. Then everybody followed, because they where all innovative ideas. Will.the teuck.be the same?

Everything you said there is wrong.

Go watch the iPhone announcement keynote. People *lost their shit*.

And the Y announcement was nothing like this. People knew what to expect, a cheaper Model X mixed with Model 3."
"The battery pack is probably so heavy it would tip the forklift XD

I sound like a Tesla hater, but I love their cars to death. I've actually sold *dozens* by talking to people with the level of passion I have. But this monster... It's just too much.

The rule of Hollywood holds true in cars as well: give us what we want, just not in a way we expect it."
"> it should be aesthetically consistent with the rest of the lineup 

I disagree."
"Early Model S's had fake grills to not freak people out, since we're so used to seeing them (and needing the airflow for the radiator). He's not playing that game any more. Electric vehicles can look different."
"Folks are getting fired over this for sure.  But if I were Elon and I was going to do these kinds of stunts, I would want to see it for myself on the actual display vehicle.  Perhaps Franz used the heavier ball when he should have used the lighter ball...  But that kind of optics is such a bad look.  I don't know how a company as large as Tesla can make that big of a mistake."
That.. that's pretty embarrassing. Can't wait to see it on youtube lol
[removed]
Maybe test the waters with a very weird design to see public perception? I hope there’s a strategy here.
Hmmm. Good point.
"PT cruiser i keep trying to turn my car guys around on, its basically a dodge srt 4 when tuned right. But, chysler (?) knew who they were marketing for, and did a good job doing it. Good timing, and good marketing help sell that car, nothing else, the looks are questionable at best, but it came around the time of the ""retro-car"" vibe. I'm more surprised the t-bird didn't do well when it came back around."
Probably true... just please don’t call the Cybertruck functional
sharks arent doin too hot tho
Yea im worried about my stock tomorrow.
"It is ahead of it's time but when my TM3 is 10 years old, I am seriously wanting one of these trucks and I HATE P/U trucks ;) 

I remember the first time I saw the front end of a Rivian and went OMG.

Now, it's just the front of a Rivian.

Police forces all over the world will want these things and that alone will provide a huge new market."
"Ah the more you know, I don't know too much about Elon so that's good to know."
"Yes, once it shows up in your account you change it."
No doubt! Maybe by the time this comes out we'll be getting closer to a time when that isn't the case.
"You don't have to, it has a trunk in the front."
Depth wise?
"Wouldn't regular pickup tool boxes look ridiculous on these? And those rusty designs were never good to begin with. I had one and it took it more space than it was worth, it was better to design your own."
It has toolboxes built into the sides.
True! I got my WRX and never looked back.
"It's not about the bed cover. It's about the walls on the sides of the bed that progressively get taller as you get to the cab. You one have only point of entry into the bed, and that sucks."
Yeah my point was just that perhaps farmer uncle won’t be into it but it could open up some unexpected demographics! We’ll see!
"Current truck owner who uses it like a truck.  This thing is useless the way it’s designed.  Like the bed was an after thought...  no side access, no room to build in the decks, tool boxes that need to be accessed from the side.  Elon needs to go watch farmers, construction workers, landscapers and real people use their truck for a month and then try again."
"Yeah I’m in love with the model 3’s looks, and the truck is weird.. but I like them both. Elon always implied the truck would be... polarizing. But he likes it. I like it. We’ll just see how it goes!"
"Bro. It’s 100 bucks that’s fully refundable, lol. Of course specs are going to change as years go by but if you keep waiting for the next best thing you’ll always be waiting. 
Btw - you sound like the perfect Model Y candidate."
"Curiously, just took another look at it and I’ll be damned if i might be... gulp... actually liking it now?

Very weird.  I went from ambivalent to realitivly positive.

It grew on me!"
I seriously had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard
"Interesting, we'll have to see how things develop. If it's matching competition and beating it, I think people will adjust to the design"
Wooosh?
"Yeah, I agree for ply this truck is not set up right.  Remove the back seats and the front of the ""vault"" and it would be ok.  I still see an SUV or shooting brake setup with the back being more of a box than a slope."
my 6' step ladder isn't enough?
"They could have, but if you're gonna have a wedge nose, you have to continue the design through the rest of the truck. It would look awkward with a straight drop there. I've already seen some lazy photoshops where people think it fixes it."
"Utility in what exactly? What does, say, the F150 offer that this doesn’t."
Contractors seem to have shitty old trucks that are actually used. I don’t really see the newish quad cabs being “used” by contractors.
"Well, yea, of course the people that don't actually need a truck can buy this. But my point was this is supposed to be bad ass and compete with trucks that people actually need.

Even as a regular person that doesn't really need a truck, except maybe a couple times of year,  that moment when you have to bring home a piece of 8' drywall to do a small house project, or a full piece of plywood and you realize you're $50k cool looking tesla has to stay home while you rent one of those home depot trucks..."
"You could probably just run over everyone making fun of you, then be king of the job site."
"A truck is my primary vehicle. 

I drive a 2016 f150 lariat. 

I also own a 92 YJ and a 2003 Rubicon."
Maybe it’ll look better from the back half a mile away while the other pick ups are pulling out of the drive way lol
Depends entirely on its success. People will warm up to it if it ever catches on and makes a name for itself and those that aren't a fan might be curious.
"You just proved my point do you not even realize it? You're not that market as you just said. Not many f150 in mega cities like New York, almost non existent in Europe. So then, let's think about what IS the market and what would get THEM (not you...) to buy.  If its gonna be a nitch that the same type of people who bought the car... well fine but that's a huge market they just missed and the stock will reflect that."
Gotcha that makes sense
"Personally I've been wondering why more cars aren't made out of stainless. Living in the midwest, our cars get eaten alive by the snow salt. Stainless is much more expensive but if it could last long enough to be economical..then maybe it would make sense. And my interpretation is that car paint's primary function is to rustproof the base metal, secondary to looks. Stainless can be heat treated to get some really neat colors too..."
I saw a comment that said it could be due to pressure. Because in the drop test you could see it bounce while on the truck it doesn't have much room to move around. Plus I'm pretty sure inertia has a part too since throwing the ball would have more force then just simply dropping it
So you’ll have a practical truck and a Telsa flex

Truck guys aren’t gonna go for it, this is on par with a Subaru Baja"
"Yeah, i think Elon knew it was different but this was way off the mark. There's going to be a very small market for this car. I think he had too much influence over the design."
"Looks like a Delorean with a truck bed rendered on the N64.  
It's definitely out there as far as designs go. The Ford electric is a safe design and its what people expect from a pickup truck which will sell much better regardless of price. I think Elon is going for a military contract with this design. I don't think it was a lazy design decision, looks very intentional."
"Yes, if there’s anything we’ve learnt from this presentation it’s that Tesla never has technical issues."
Lines and sharp edges are pretty universally regarded as masculine while soft curves are generally seen as feminine. This truck is firmly in the “angular” camp.
"What? If there is anything this truck is, it's practical. Onboard 150/220 outlets, compressed air, full size covered bed, autopilot, built in ramp, body panels that are hard to scratch dent and no paint to worry about, it's the most practical vehicle for doing actual work i've ever seen. The only 'bad' thing is how it looks if you don't like that. That isn't even mentioning the fact that it's faster than a 911 and tows more than an F150."
"Maybe not, but it seems like it could be used for that type of work just like other trucks is my point."
Yup. 99% of replies think it looks bad. Very subjective
Neither of those statements means anything to the planned volume of the truck. Pick up trucks are currently the most sold type of vehicle and by the sheer virtue of doing a truck Tesla is anticipating that it be their most popular model too.
That seems true. I'd much rather ride my bike into the side of a conventional vehicle than this thing. Maybe it's just a subtle push for greater Autopilot adoption haha.

"You don't think a roof rack can be an option, im sure it can. Look at the body shape of an actual truck, it sucks for those same items, short roof line. You have to add  a roof and bed rack to do what you are talking about, no reason to think you can't do the same here."

I wonder how large of aerodynamic loss there would be between this and their prototype.
"If the glass doesn't break and the electrical system is fried, there is no way out of this car. Would be a futuristic looking coffin.

I preordered one."
"A truck should be flexible for work. The bed should be separate from the cab with straight lower sides (like you see for most work trucks) it should be body on frame for towing. If you're going to take buckets of soil the design is going to be a bit of a pain. You can't install a fuel rig (you'll see those on work trucks for fueling tools) or a tool box. You can't install a lumber rack which really limits what you can carry.

The reason the Ridgeline is not a popular work truck design is that it's not a good design for a work truck, same as this. Trucks are ugly and all look the same, but that's for a reason. That design is important for the requirements of truck owners to do work.

But I bet this thing kicks ass as a dune racer like the Ford raptor."
Pallets of shingles are not fitting in that bitch
"The reason the glass shatters is one to avoid large shards breaking off and two to deflect energy, from the drop test you can see that this has pretty good deformation characteristics and from the breaking you can see that it isn't prone to forming sharp shards like normal ridged glass"

They arent any more rigid in side impacts necessarily either.  Did you see the hammer hits?  The whole thing bent.  And then springs back without sticking in a dent.  This is part of why its flat.  Ever notice on the flattest sections of your car how you can push in and it pops back out?  Push on a corner enough for it to bend and it wont pop back out.  Its kind of a misleading demo because its not strength that lets it bounce back unmarred.

> 9.3.4 Crash safety
>The front and rear crumple zones of a car are designed to collapse at a force which transmits a 20g horizontal deceleration to the rigid passenger cage. 

It doesn’t make sense to have crumple zone on the side due to how little space there is between the door and the occupants. A front crumple zone should reduce the impact for both cars in a t-bone collision."
"But without paint you can buff a scratch right out with an angle grinder, which can be powered with the available 110v plug."

Well sorry for being mean. Your comment read like one of the common Microsoft commercial. Just a word salad of futuristic sounding words to support your fanboyism.
"Different? Yes.

Ugly?  Hell yes.

It's easily the ugliest vehicle ever made into physical form.  There's no way it ships looking even remotely like that."
I was waiting for someone to put some up and the link became active before anyone did
Huge if true.
Leave it outside...stainless steel doesn’t rust!
"Why the fuck would you need a garage for this beast? Demo that shit, enjoy your new yard."
"It’s there now, you can edit the design in your account"
sad! but now you have your p3d...
why not? it's refundable. I guess maybe I should cancel to force them to make it better looking.

"Yeah I’m sure the front trunk storage is handy, but that still doesn’t help if I need to reach over the sidewall of the bed for any reason. 
But honestly it doesn’t matter to me. I’m one of the people who would never buy a short bed truck (6-6.5ft) like that because the bed is too short to be useful. It’s definitely not aimed at the working truck market or it would have a standard 8ft long bed."
"yeah, I kinda liked it too, then I remembered that most times, people see you getting in and out of your parked car."
"Still a few years from release, they've got time on their side."
Think they said if you wanted you would have to wrap it in vinyl
Hey noob question here but why can’t this thing haul plywood and drywall?
"You're missing all the diesel fumes you're pumping into the atmosphere, that's what you're missing. Charge time? Who cares? Most consumers will charge at night before they leave. Not sure the point you're trying to make if it's easily batted down. And this was designed as an alternate to the light duty truck, not the 250 diesel models. Apples to oranges."
"Tell that to the El Camino, Pantera, and Porsche models from the 80s."
"I mean, the model 3 was considered ugly when it was announced. This is a groundbreaking design, it look like it’s outta mass effect. I’m horny for it"
Motortrend got early access and did more of a deep dive if you are looking for more info.
"His whole point was “using it to get work done”, not the stylistic design, what about the design would prevent what work from getting done"
"This thing is neat, not sure about hauling stuff on the roof but otherwise I like what they presented today and those mock scenarios shown in the pictures. Only problem is not sure about the pickup truck market's target demographic..."
"Adjust the seat, dude. I don’t always like sitting as far back as possible in a vehicle, but you do what you need to fit. I can’t believe that there’s no seating position in which you fit in a pick-up. Do you have trouble reaching the steering wheel with the seat slightly reclined? I’m flummoxed by this."
Never knew their was an original so I just looked it up. Damn its probably the best looking truck I've ever seen. If the reboot was more faithful to original I'd really want one and I've never owned a truck in my life.
"Ah yeah, that's probably it"
I’m going to say the lack of a frame will prohibit a 5th wheel plate being attached. Unless they come up with some crazy reinforcement in the body for it.
Yet the Ford I currently have has exactly that because ford has bed size options for guys like me who actually use it for exactly that function on a near weekly basis
The inside dimensions isn’t the issue. Side loading and access is one of the main issues there. Same issue the Honda Ridgeline has but more extreme
"I don't know about you, but the area I'm from, truck purchases are incredibly rational lol"
That's assuming Tesla didn't already figure that stuff out. Which isn't likely considering their ingenuity.
"I went for the same option, dual motor is all I need, but would prefer the 500 mile range. I’m sure they will offer a “long range” dual motor with demand."

Yep!

"I agree. Fully. Looks terrible, and if I had the money I would seriously consider getting one if:
1: was actually the size of the truck it's competing with
2: didn't make me look like a jackass while driving it"
"You realize that other people are allowed to have opinions on how things look, right? Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean other people won't. Please, let people enjoy this, and don't just shit on it cause you don't like the design."
"Because doing something that sets yourself apart from the rest of the market is a good thing.

Car companies have been playing it safe for decades. Very little changes about cars today and this is not in the consumer's favor.

Tesla is doing something new, experimenting with design and technologies. While other companies brag about their cars braking for pedestrians in their commercials Tesla is already working on FSD.

Wether you like this particular design or not, companies that push to go forward are the way to go. Not the ones that ride the slow train that will get to the station eventually but has no incentive to do so because putting Apple carplay in last year's car is enough improvement for consumers."
In your opinion.
"This is what happens when you launch a vehicle of the future, in the present."
"In terms of reading Philip K Dick, sure. In terms of random people who may look at this thing and want one? You'd be surprised."
You’d be wrong. 146k orders in 3 days.
Does this mean Tesla can have a crack at producing the Cybertruck in Northern Ireland after all then? ;)
But he puffed a marijuana cigarette on a podcast 😡(🧑🏻🍷)
I don't think you know Elons attitude towards critics.
"The issue is the rolled stainless steel. You will NEVER see a perfectly flat piece of metal / plating on ANY part of a vehicle EVER.

Likewise, in nature NOTHING is perfectly flat. It looks unnatural, ugly... and I don't mean 'that's just my opinion', it's an objective fact. Same as buying baggy clothes 'one size fits all'... it's the 'shapeliness' that gives things beauty.

But... all things considered, I think it's fine. I hope he designs an 'earth' truck too, that is more organically pleasing, personally.

The martian truck and an earth truck are two different markets... no need to scrap a project or anything like that. There will definitely be no sales overlap lol."

"A low-poly DeLorean, no less."
I feel the same. Hopefully my sarcasm came across in my comment.
Can police department buy their own super chargers?
"Gotta remember to charge it , if normal civilians can charge their car when they get home, trained police officers can plug it in when they get back. Not to mention the more obvious scenario that is they have multiple police vehicles at a station and can alternate, They can have multiple Teslas, the savings in gas money alone would cover the bill for an additional Tesla. I do agree, that Tesla should allow them to install a private supercharger and then charging will take like 15 minutes."
How often are we getting shot at typically in any given month?
Main difference is all the lights and the electronic gear they have in the vehicles are going to pull on the battery too. I am sure some local cops will try them but I don’t see them replacing highway patrol or vehicles that do heavy patrolling mainly due length to recharge and limited range.
Yeah that’s a quick pivot for them if they want to make vans and whatnot.
"I imagine it can be left open enough to give a significant amount of room, otherwise if you're hauling TONS of stuff, you'd probably want a trailer anyway. Keep in mind it also has a pretty massive ""frunk"" as well. If that's your biggest gripe on its versatility, even if more significant than I am thinking... Cybertruck is still vastly more so than any other vehicle of similar price. Not to mention its performance capability within each area."
[Tesla cybertruck traditional bedside walls](https://imgur.com/a/Ey5erRu)
"Exactly, unless you're trying to hide from radar I don't see why they'd go with this design."
"This makes zero sense.  Are you saying that truck buyers are freakishly tall?  Have you looked a a new truck lately?  The bed sides are all 5ft plus, too high for the average human to reach over."
But never a gooseneck or 5th wheel with those blocker-bedslides.
"It has that nice stainless steel body though, not the aluminum that newer fords have. There was a video of a guy wailing on this things door with a sledgehammer, if I did that with my buddy's ford I could get in the cab through the hole."
Lol. A sledge hammer didnt dent the door. A pedestrian would be annihilated.
"Yep, I agree."
Twist: the entire lineup is going to be variations on this from now on
"Totally agree. We see this with iPhone reveals every year. People see the leaked pictures and say Apple would never design something so hideous. Than it comes out looking just like that and it grows on people. Then we repeat the cycle next year. 

Seeing it still I thought it looked weird. But seeing it in video and in motion made me like it a bit more. I think we need to see it in more colors and for it to be...doing things. Like why didn’t they do a b roll video of it on a camping trip or something"
Agreed!
"lmao, by all means, tell me how to spend my money. 

I HIGHLY DOUBT people looking for utility trucks are going to be pricing out Tesla’s. Just a hunch."
This shit is niche af
Time will tell. This might just be so far out there that it'll put people off before they even hear the specs and cost.
"I honestly don't know, he seemed excited about it in that podcast recently. Just seemed like there was something going on between him and Elon on stage. Maybe they've been butting heads because Elon wants that cyberpunk look and ""form over function"" and Franz wanted something more traditional looking but with the Tesla sleekness and curves? In all honesty, I'm probably just overthinking things."
No probably not.  But it may sell well among a different demographic

"Watch the stock over the next week, if it dips and starts climbing I usually buy then, so far I’ve bought at 280ish, 260-ish and 250-ish. 

Long term it will take more than one weird truck design to derail the company and depending on interior this thing might see moderate sales to the people who want to stand out, it does have great specs and price."
"I don't buy it. I have never heard him refer to the truck project as a novelty product. But if he did (and I'm generally curious to see where he said this if you have a link), that is a horrible decision. Why the constant comparisons to the other major truck brands? Why is it 40k? If they wanted to make a novelty truck, they could have made it their version of the hummer and made it 200k. The way they rolled this out sure as hell looks like they want to sell a ton of them as cheap as possible to compete with major truck brands. Also, what happened to the overall goal of Tesla to get more electric vehicles on the road? Producing a competitive truck would certainly do that. I wasn't looking for him to roll out an F150 clone. But I certainly wasn't expecting what we saw tonight. It is a horrible move for Tesla for so many reasons. I actually don't completely hate the design. I think with a little tweaking it could look spectacular. But most will absolutely hate it. I can only hope they clean it up a bit before they actually start production. You're right about one thing, you will need courage and audacity to drive it."
"Man dude, you're really blinded

This looks like a child's drawing, a video game bugging out, or a very cheap design of what a future car would look like 30 years ago

It's just God awful, there's really nothing good looking about it."

"No paint can fix this monstrosity.  It's literally one of the most ugly vehicles I've ever seen.  I wish Tesla didn't abandon their design philosophy that made them popular with the Roadster, S, X, 3, and Y.  This is a joke and I cannot see them going ahead with this design.  It truly is awful."

While first responders do have the tools, there is nothing you can keep in your car to cut yourself out, unlike regular tempered glass windows.  On the plus side it makes it harder to steal something from your car and keeps people inside the vehicle instead of being ejected.

"Right!? Like what were they thinking? I hope I'm wrong, but I don't see this selling like hot cakes, especially not after the initial rush of preorders. It's such an outlier truck, that the people that want one will get one, but long term who's going switch to this?"
"I think it looks like it ought to. I can't imagine Tesla's smooth, good looking lines working well on a serious pickup. They've had paint issues, and they've had issues with their panel gaps. By eliminating curves and such and even going with a bare stainless look, I think it's simplifying things for them down to what they're good at- solid engineering, providing features that work, and making it tough/safe/perform well.

(Look at their safety specs, for example). 

That they've also made it look *different* in the process is a boon.

I love how Tesla's changed the appearance- ditched the front grille, for example."
"I mean yeah, but like look at the DeLorean, Warthog and such. Iconic? Yes. Everyone wants one.

And they're not exactly good looking vehicles, but my god are they cool."
Same happened to me but I came around a little faster. It has the same vibe as the A1 general humvees IMO. Definitely out there.
"But why choose to reveal a vehicle they know will be so poorly received. It’s, just, stupid. They have tarnished the brand’s reputation, at least call it a concept or something."
I hope you're right
"Well, mainly people who want to actually register it to drive on roads."
Each to their own. Some people will hate it. I personally can’t imagine buying any other truck after this comes out.
"I think most people probably won’t like it, but are you a truck owner? It seems like you personally don’t like it, but maybe it’s not meant for you"
Driving my 16’ ram right now. I put in a preorder.
"Dudes got a point.  Sales numbers don't lie 

Oh and those ugly ass vehicles aren't produced anymore for a very $good$ reason"
Totally disagree.  It will carry dry wall and it will carry a ride on lawn mower and other garden equipment .  That’s the majority of truck usage and it will do great
[deleted]
Which is the majority of current truck owners anyways....
"Yep lots of people might change their mind... others might order, the public might get used to the design....

We don't know... you are right that some will reconsider... but my hunch is they would be happy with 20K sales per year initially.

IMO they can't change it quickly even if they want to ...

My guess is they will run with this design, for a while and see how well it sells, they have zero ability to mass produce any other design for sometime..."
"> No, it won't take away their profitability, but their stock is gonna tank tomorrow. 

Oh good, I'll buy some more"
"Yes but if you want to appeal to a larger market you stick close to the popular designs trends.  I like Tesla and spend alot of time in trucks... no truck guy will buy this thing.  I appreciate the no compromise, but if they dont sell many because they look like something out a bad scifi, it was a waste of time a d makes the company look bad.  There will be a redesign."
It’s beautiful
Homer beat them to it in the 90's
"Rivian looks so much better. This ain't even a ""Ok, Boomer"" thing because this shit looks hideous and you know ugly don't sell like the Pontiac Aztec."
"It lookslike shit 

Sincerely a zoomer."
Ok boomer
"Though I do not like those headlights, it's much nicer than the CYBRTRK haha."
But people most certainly read the outlets reporting on his tweets.
And wallstreetbets
"I was thinking along the same lines, even picked the same render."
So buy a Rivian then? That’s what you want
"I enjoy listening to him, he always sounds genuinely excited about what he's talking about"
"I agree, makes him like a normal human being. Approachable."
"If you really want it for work, then the specs should be pretty decent no?"
Looks pretty functional to me.
"The term boomer, as currently used on the Internet, is a mindset. Yes, the term comes from the baby boomer generation, but that’s not what it means anymore."
"Yep, that's the plan.  Finally, someone gets it."
Yes 2021 I think for single and dual motor. 2023 for tri-motor (2.9 0-60)
Late 2021 for RWD and Dual motor AWD. 2022 for Tri-motor AWD.
"lol bud. 

>Fuck him he owes us more. Nobody does enough work to deserve that much money.


what is someone who would say this even doing in a cybertruck reveal thread or r/teslamotors in the first place? if i didnt like someone, i wouldnt be hanging around reading about his news. your account was created 2 months ago and about 50% of your comments are talking shit about elon. no real person does this."
And an 8ft bed
Ford sells an F-150 with ladder racks?
"Aesthetics are entirely subjective. The older models didn't have this exoskeleton design, whether the Cybertruck needs it or not is questionable but saying this design is ugly and the Model S is beautiful is just a matter of personal taste. 

Tesla hasn't failed a vehicle launch yet, it's too early to say if this will be the first one."
"Yes, I want the designs to be cutting edge just like the battery and software.  Do you think Rivian will sell more because it looks traditional?  They're designer barely did anything - that hood is long and useless."
"I hope the criticism makes them at least produce a version with a different body, and I'm predicting it will, but until then I'm going to keep criticizing this terrible terrible design."
"I can. 

No standard cab.
No bed length options.
No good fleet sales network. 

It's fine for a truck not to be made for job sites. Most trucks aren't sold to job sites, just to regular people who don't sweat the size and mileage and what a more capable vehicle. Most never leave the pavement, and most beds go unused for a vast majority of the time. That's fine too. 

It's a utilitarian vehicle sold to people who value (but not neccisarily utilize) utility."
Apparently California doesnt have real job sites?
"Payload and towing capacity are way below vehicles like an F-250, and the F-250 costs way less.  Add to that inability to side load, required charging times, limited range when towing, etc. and this becomes a really difficult sell.  On a job site no one is going to care about 0-60 times."
"If I had to pick the biggest clear flaw, 6.5ft bed.

The second would probably be the windows."
"I appreciate what you've said. Unfortunately, competition is there to provide a non-ugly vehicle with similar fuel reduction. 

Note: Needs side bed load access."
"You can't side load. People side load all the time in the business. Also, the customer base of construction contractors want a truck, not a cyber punk truck. In simplest terms, rednecks don't want this trash. They want a truck. This is a shame."
"Neither does Elon, apparently"
"The design of the bed for one. The triangular shape sacrifices space for no reason aside from looks. How are you going to fit a toolbox across the bed if the sides are angled like that? How exactly does this out spec any of the competition? Sure it may have  a decent 0-60 and towing capability, but that is not going to be on the affordable model. 

If you are buying a truck to actually use as a truck, especially on job sites, this truck is lacking compared to the competition."
"Absolutely because of the looks and job site utility. Contractors don't want this. Think about the customer base... Seriously. This is so disappointing. I've converted what customers I could that would get into my Model 3... but others want a truck. This is not the truck for them, and that really sucks."
"A big issues I see, horrible access to the sides of the truck bed"
"I know, I was responding to his claim that an F-150 towed a train...that metric doesn’t really matter."
"You're missing that ""pulling capacity"" was listed as infinite. It's rated for 14,000lbs towing. By comparison, the current top-spec F-150 is listed at 12,100lbs towing. I suspect it's a frame/suspension/brakes thing more than a drivetrain thing."
6.5 not bad
"lol we can go to the future without an ugly as fuck design

see: tesla model s, x, 3, and y."
This car's a little bit early. This should be the design when humans colonize mars. A mars exclusive
"Ah, didn’t know they still had one.

https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC5WjFrtBdufl6CZojX3D8dQ"
"Rivian is supposedly out a year from now, though that should be taken with a huge grain of salt. They def need to beat Ford and GM."
?
"It’s certainly not real marble. Looks tacky in my opinion, but so does the wood dash of the 3."
"First off that doesn't make sense since any truck can be converted, second there is an electric Ford F-150 prototype"
"Yeah, I don't really believe that. Based on how the truck looks to me, I can guess that easily 80-90% will not like it."
It's a close guess based on the Model X while towing. Even divide by 4.
Are there any pictures of that? I heard the rearview mirror is actually a camera/display so I assumed there was zero traditional visibility.
Most truck owners have a tonneau cover that they have to store if they want to haul anything. I see this would be the same. But yes not everyone wants to do the same thing.
"I would have liked a little joke to go over it...

*Elon turns around* ""Jerry, you're fired. You're all fired. Anyways, here's the specs...""

But it was super awkward instead."
"Stuff happens. When Mercedes first demonstrated the self-stopping S-class to car journalists in 2003 in a industrial hall full of smoke, the thing drove full speed into the wall because someone had forgotten to actually turn the system on. The (absolutely glorious) video can still be found on youtube I think."
[deleted]
I guess.
I stopped watching as soon as it rolled out.  Interest dropped to 0.
"Looks nothing like the Warthog, please be serious."
Oh its also people taking screenshots of people putting money down for the truck.
no doubt - thanks for all your work!!
"They don’t sell anything near an F150 in size in England. 

The largest SUV Ford sells here is the Edge, and that only started recently. Forget about the Explorer and Expedition."
"You don’t realize how narrow British lanes and roads can get tho. Same with parking lots - it’s a huge struggle to park a Ford Explorer here and one of the reasons they don’t sell them (the Edge is the largest Ford SUV you can get here, two steps down from the Expedition). 

It’s a country where most people drive cars the size of a VW Golf."
Seems like most trucks start at 50k now.
"I do know truck guys, and this doesn't seem to appeal to them from the dudes I know."
What size? Cause I've seen Rams from 30-75
"King Ranch is like getting the Grand Cherokee back when Cherokee were good. You want to say you drive a jeep, but don't have any use at all for it. It's the dude who buys a rugged, high-priced outdoor thermos, to drink celestial seasonings at his desk at his solely indoor job."
"Just like a wooden hacksaw, being unique doesn't make it useful or good."
I've since grown to love the design.
"The comparison with older cars is somewhat flawed since they generally didn't have the stiffness around the passenger structure and would crush them, plus no airbags. This will be rock solid around the passengers, if for nothing else due to the battery pack and the steel plates will bend and crumble at high speed impact to reduce g forces, they're not steel beams. That said, a normal car will crumble easier so if two hit eachother head on, the regular car might have this truck go through it, the car will compress beyond the crumple zone. The 500 miles version will easily weigh over 3 tons."
But crumple zones protect passengers...
We're only embarrassed because we latch on to tradition too damn much. I whole heartedly embrace the true future.
"Pfft, no it's not.

Looks aside how is the Rivan 19k better??"
"Very un-alturistic of you 
Your opinion of this won't affect my opinion of it, or anyone else's"
"It surely does when you attempt to speak for the ""truck demographic"" yet cannot properly spell one of the biggest up-and-coming brands in the truck market."
"That is not, in any way, a death threat or a witch hunt."
"If you want to take it that way... 

I'm just trying to give you a safe space."
well it's a dumb fucking point when there's no way to pick up on the sarcasm and hyperbole with the way your wrote the comment. it's not it was obvious and people just missed it.
"oh of course, I’m not undermining how much of an engineering feat it is to put this kind of glass in a sub 50k vehicle. 

I’m just saying that claiming something to work in a certain way only to have it fail on stage is pretty embarrassing, and people will obviously make fun of/ criticize that."
"Some people have different opinions than you on design and innovation. Get over it, move on."
"I'd be worried about the cover getting grit in it, and freezing shut in the winter, for sure."
"That at least looks solveable because the suspension can tilt the truck forward and back. You could put the tailgate at the height you want. It's a killer feature for a farmer like myself as I'm often loading and unloading quads and not having to set up the ramps / find an appropriate hill to load off would be great. Not to mention sliding heavy mineral tubs and salt blocks right out on the ground.

Too bad the truck looks absolutely ridiculous."
It's less storage also.
"Rivian looks far more promising at this point.  The bed is far too small to use as a work truck but everything else about the truck I love.  It's a polished design that doesn't deviate too much from conventional truck norms.  In comparing the two, one is a truck and the other is a concept being rushed to production."
It’s not gonna be the best selling car by any means though.
Turns out a car getting hit with a hammer is not anything like a car crash.  Its more like getting doored.  Or a ladder hitting it.
lmao
"I wonder if that is even a final design. I mean, pick-up guys are one special kind of customer. I get roadster customers and model 3 and S customers wishes but the other cunstomer group are ""pick""y."
Didn't realize the trade boys bought trucks based on how pretty they were.
"I think they still have a lot to prove before they replace anything. Which is always the nature of really out-there changes.

Design aside; The truth is that stainless steel isn't completely rust proof if its in the wrong conditions. I've seen plenty of rusted out SS; from salt, chemicals or just carbon steel contamination.

Paint isn't just used to make the cars look pretty. So I'd be interested how the stainless steel holds up (especially in winter were salt is used)"
"Yep! And again, endless pre orders. Is that a quantitative data point? No. Does it show many different kinds of people loving the design? Yes."
"Dude, it's so cheesey. From a utilitarian perspective: depending on the area you live in, people will be constantly making fun of you and maybe even trying to climb on the roof or other weird things."
Woah am I suddenly in a model 3 reveal thread?
[deleted]
I think I need to restart my PS2. Halo looks weird
"Lmao how does a car from the future look ""cheap"" this looks like it could go for 150k easy"
ok boomer
The most sold platform of vehicles is only owned by idiots?
"Well then, fucking mission accomplished."
They say it'll parallel park itself..
He literally designed it to be a beast off road with that suspension and adjustable height.
Oh I did not see that. Was it apart of the reveal presentation?
"My dude, most of Kabul’s electricity is provided by diesel generators."
"Weight and crash tests aren't the only reason new cars seem to be made of tin foil, the thinner and more flexible it is the longer the dies last."
"You're 2 years past being legally allowed to purchase a rifle and get yourself in crippling debt.  It would probably be a serious mistake to make a heavy investment like this at your age unless you're really pulling in some good money, but that has rarely stopped people in the past.  That said, you build up a solid two years of work history and save up $5000 for the down payment, you could secure an auto loan by the time the money man comes calling.  You might also be able to knock some money off the price with government subsidies for renewable energy, but it's hard to say what that landscape will look like in 2 years.

 [https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design)"
Oops sorry I misunderstood. I thought you were saying that you couldn't afford one previously but we're getting the truck. My mistake
">crumblyness

Sorry mate, English isn't exactly my first language. I started with Romanian, then Italian, then French. Only started speaking English in college."
Limit sell
"> and it has weaker specs.

The specs are *good enough.* There's a reason the F-150 is the best selling truck, even though there's also the F-250, F-350 and F-450.

For the vast majority of buyers, the F-150 has specs that are good enough. Try to get a commercial buyer excited about 0-60 times."
Sick burn! 🤘🏻
"CYBRTRK!!!

*sorry* 🤷‍♂️"
"I feel this may attract an entirely different crowd, which is people who weren't really thinking of getting a truck or an electric car but will feel the urge to own this."
"> this definitely took a hit on their reputation

Lol, let's talk in a couple of days."
"I doubt it will be half the issue you're thinking.

What amazes me is how it took this long for a truck manufacturer to think ""what if our customers *didn't* want shit to be stolen out of their bed at a stop light?"""
[deleted]
"Well, I don't know. Maybe."
"You make it sound like what we have now is bad. The current line up is sexy, this is a wedge from the 80s. Laughable you think this is anywhere near good."
"No email, just an owl confirmation page."
"No email here, no charge either"
"Neither am I.  Not sure what the OP sees since marketing can be interpreted differently.

I see a truck that was a kid's dream, a prepper's resource, and a rich, tech person's new toy.

Also the window smash was totally set up for going viral."
they didnt talk about the interior at all. there are pictures on the tesla site and the motortrend article tho
"I concur. Definitely more accurate.

Edit: can it barrel roll?"
"Aw, so cute how you got all condescending."
"Small doesn't mean flimsy though. Even so, there's still time to change those details prior to production."
"I see lots of assumptions...

No ties downs: No data, you're not there in person to see this and it's not mentioned anywhere.

Odd windshield angle: You know nothing about the visibility until you sit in one.

Steering wheel is shit for driving: Use it first 

Other things like side steps/cupholders etc...we don;t even know if this is the final design. There looks to be PLENTY of space for accessories and options.

I just see plenty of assumptions and we have a long time to wait before this thing is on the street. The original S and 3 reveals changed before hitting the road too."
Fanbois are going to justify this truck and its miserable sales till the very end.
"You're making assumptions based on early photos. You honestly think some of the best and brightest people in the world working on this thing would overlook a lot of what you're saying.

Confirmed SFB."
Calm down guy
">Assumptions, you have eyes correct? I didn't make a single assumption. You can see clearly in the photos every point I made.

Well for a start you assumed the prototype/early concept is the final version.    I mean in some senses, you're right, this version will sell 0 units.  


Other things you mentioned are speculation... or maybe unnecessary.   For example, if the air-suspension works as advertised, do they really need step sides (assuming that's not an addon).  It's interesting you attack the steering wheel... when nobody has used it yet and seen how well (or not) it performs... so on and so forth."
">Assumptions, you have eyes correct? I didn't make a single assumption. You can see clearly in the photos every point I made

Motor Trend has photos with tie downs in the bed. QED."
I'm sensing you're a bit of wanker.
And yet Elon just blew their specs out of the water. Air and Power on demand is going to interest more folks than ffn cup holders!
"Stop, the only teased photo was of it’s headlight bar, which didn’t show the shape or form of the car at all. The truck, and the reveal, were total let downs. Honestly feel like it was all a joke... I’m numb"
"I thought I read in the agreement, in bold typeface, that until delivery the deposit is fully refundable.  Did I misread that?"
"Before you get to order your car the model 3 $1,000 pre order deposit was fully refundable. 

So yes this is a pre order and it’s fully refundable wow"
"The others are available NOW, this is a pre order that’s why it’s fully refundable. Same situation with the Model 3. Until you placed your actual order (which was rolled out by invite) the PRE ORDER was fully refundable even at $1,000

It’s astonishing so many people don’t know this"
X and 3 both had mirrors at unveiling
Buyer's remorse?
"If you think that they would take this sort of a gamble and that they ARENT going to push the envelope then you should probably reconsider why you’ve invested in the company to begin with. 

Form follows function with this vehicle. It all makes sense on paper with what the truck needs to do, it doesn’t care about what you think of the design it’s a serious vehicle"
Can you explain/teach me the difference between autopilot and self-driving?
Looks of a door stop.
"It has a frunk, good for tool storage that you can get to quickly.

You can add on slide-out boxes to the bed.

The tailgate turns into a ramp and the bed lowers, so you can walk into it like it's a storage shed or something.

There is underbed storage in a trunk under the bed.

Storage in the sail panels.

It has a 110v and 220v power source to run tools, and an air compressor to run air tools.

16"" of ground clearance, more than a Wrangler Rubicon (11"").

It's about the most functional work vehicle you could buy at any price.  It's just kind of ugly."
ok boomer
"I forgot about the gen 1 ridgeline having this same issue, but you're right."
Not better than the cab-over render
"Bullshit.

"It's miles different than the renders, not miles better."
"That doesn't change the fact that'll be a hard sell for most normal people, compared to the Model 3 which has become a pretty widely adopted."
I actually thought a lot of the renders were better.
"I had that thought too. Maybe even an optional trailer with an extendable solar array similar to what's used on satellites. Lord knows Elon has plenty of those being made. That being said, of course it would drive up costs, but I still struggle to see how the Model X is worth $100k+ whereas this new extremely futuristic truck is $30 - $70k. I would happily pay $100k+ for a truck with the ability to travel off-road indefinitely. They should make portable consumer supercharger trailers. Idek if they include gas generators (obviously defeating their visions) but imo so, so necessary."
I think the xB is prettier than this.
"Yeah I just read that itll have 110/220 hookup! The features are incredible, too bad it looks like I drew it in my trapper keeper."
Right.
"Yeah or any other cyberpunk world. 

Maybe that’s why it’s called Cyber Truck."
"I actually like the design, but I don't mind wedge type cars and when it comes to a truck I value durability and practicality a lot more than aesthetics.  
It's still out of my price range but it's the first Tesla product that made me think ""ooh, I want one""."
"You're looking at a *drawing*, not the actual truck, the prototype is smoother than that and it *is* a prototype, the tailgate seems to overlap and soften the corner a bit."
Oh my god that view. It's so ugly. They pasted on a wheel well. They angled a box and pasted some things on to it. It's so bad.
"It's not more expensive than regular trucks, it's a decently priced car with fantastic performance. Plenty of people who want a Tesla but who just like this design more are simply going to buy this, regardless of their truck needs."
Bingo. This is the BMW X6 of trucks.
[deleted]
"Well, this is not a final version, it's prototype. Remember how everyone hated Model 3 trunk opening because it was tiny? They fixed it before production. I think they will modify tray somehow if enough people complain."
"I wouldn't call it a ""disaster"". This car doesn't even matter for their financial results next couple of years. It is super functional (as long as you don't throw metal balls at its windows), affordable, and its has Tesla software. It's just weird and an ""acquired taste"".

We have a history of many weird cars like this achieving iconic status and becoming sought after.

The presentation should've been better though. He could've simply not taken the risk. I wouldn't do any of those demos live. I'd do them on video. Nobody would care. Just say it's for the audience safety or something. Nobody does this shit live. Oh well."
Well he ain’t presenting like Steve Jobs for sure. At least he delivers behind the scenes.
"I get the need to be different and stand out.  But the truck users are guys who have all sorts of shit available to adapt to their current pick up beds universally.  Is Tesla so out of touch on that that they think contractors are just going to buy new custom stuff for this truck? Can you imagine trying to dump a load of mulch into the back of this thing or haul some furniture?  Not everything is loaded from the back of the truck.  Like fuck , just go to a construction site for 2 days and see how we use trucks."
"Makes no sense, the S is by far their best looking car...this thing is a monstrosity."
"I don’t think Tesla has time to be fucking around with gimmicks. Their competition knows their target demo better and is catching up to them technologically. 

Developing these gimmicks is such a waste of capital and the leash continues to shorten especially considering the Solar City debacle"
"""Luxury cars"" is not a niche audience though. It's not the biggest, but it's still gigantic.

The 3 still took a realistic swing at mainstream. It's different but not drastically so. It's attention-getting but still practical as an everyday driver.

Cyber Truck is just out in left field though entirely. The only thing it has going for it is the price."
"> small town

LMAO I hadn't even considered this. Teslas already get enough flak in small town America, this thing is like a ""make fun of me into eternity"" flag."
"Where do you put a 12' piece of lumber in a normal 6.5ft F-150? How would this be any different? And maybe this is crazy, but you'd also put the ladder the same exact place you keep your ladder on a normal F-150.

Literally the only thing different about the bed of this truck is it has the bed cover that follows rails leading from the top of the cab. That doesn't mean you can't keep the cover down or the tailgate down, or install a rack on top of the bed. Sure the rack/truck may have a different look, but that doesn't mean you can't have one. Like [look where they have the camper on this](https://imgur.com/a/fa9a7Rw).

It has a drastically different design than anything we are used to. That doesn't mean you won't be able to haul lumber or a ladder in it, or that it isn't practical..."
"0-60 time is one of the many things I mentioned. And you act like it have good acceleration is a negative. Or that there could possibly be people in the US who would buy a truck who need it exclusively for work and hauling shit and nothing else. 

The bed is literarally as big or bigger than 2/3rds of the F-150 beds that Ford offers (5.5, 6.5, and 8 ft), so what the hell are you talking about?"
"And some will buy the Cybertruck, because it has better performance, or it looks better as well... So you're point doesn't negate mine."
"It is different. I like it and dislike at the same time, but I feel that I need to get some time to think about it, maybe sleep on it. It's too different to judge it right now.

I still think they are going to redesign some parts, not the whole shape, but minor things. I'll give it some time to cook anyway. 

The fact that nobody made something like this before is just impressive. This is why Tesla is Tesla, they are not afraid to try something completely new."
If you say so
"Agreed, I feel like they missed a lot of stuff (like the interior) that I wanted to hear about...might just be too early for them to feel comfortable committing to anything besides basic specs."
"I think it looks more like a DeLorean-colored 80's Lambo fucked a monster truck.
I don't love it. But at around $50k for the middle of the road model, it'll certainly sell to... someone."
[deleted]
"Yes, but even the toy ones need to bring it and actually be useful every once in a while. You'll feel like a real tool with your truck when someone asks you if you could help them move something, but your truck is not enough of a truck for it. 

It still needs the pedigree."
But it is factually correct.
Tesla is here to stay. The Model 3 is selling great. The stock will rebound from this hiccup. If the truck doesn't get a redesign before the launch it will get one soon or the truck will be cancelled. You can't keep a model that doesn't sell in production.
"I don't really care much for tesla, but I personally think it looks cool, mainly just because of how I really like fantasy/scifi. I can see though how if someone doesn't feel the same, its probably pretty stupid looking, especially for most of the truck demographic."
"I can see at least why the bed was made the way it was. Hypermilers mod their trucks putting an angled cover over the bed to improve the aerodynamics. 

But yeah, this truck looks totally different compared to all the other Tesla’s. The Model S, X, 3, and Y all have the same design language, I figured this would be the same, looking like that Cadillac pickup truck they had years ago."
I think Elon mentioned somewhere that the first truck will be “cyber punk” and then it will be followed by more standard looking trucks.
"Ya I’m struggling with it. I don’t hate it so I suppose that’s something but I am not a fan at all.

I think the only thing saving me from the I hate it camp is a lack of info. So many questions that I honestly feel the answers could make me overlook the style. How does it actually perform truck wise? Racing a Porsche isn’t what truck owners intend to do with their trucks."
"like I didn't believe that was it, so I wanted to see if an order would actually work.  it does"
"The aesthetic would be fine and edgy and would grow on people if the design of the truck was in any functional or improved on the function of the pick-up truck that ""hasn't changed in 100 years.""

If it hasn't changed it 100 years, you better have a good reason to change it.  And ""stealthy stuff looks cool"" isn't a good enough reason to have on undersized bed size, no bed side access, non-body on frame.

Body on Fram works because it allows fleets to customize the vehicle to what is needed. 

This is a toy, not a pickup truck."
"Yup, thats what I had in mind lol."
"Just not a great sign honestly, you'd think they would've rehearsed this before. Musk's reaction shows they didn't expect any cracks at all it's mental"
"Yeah, but you want side windows to shatter for safety. Normal windshields would have held up just the same."
"I don't like the design atm, but I'd be really surprised if Tesla doesn't end up with decently more pre-orders for this than Rivians truck. To your point, if Rivian survives to production, there should be healthy demand for their style of design."
Zoomer
"Ok, boomer"
Okay boomer
"Yeah, tbh I can’t see this being street legal. If you hit a pedestrian with that he’ll be all kinds of broken **and** cut. Car likely won’t even have a dent though ..."
Especially the wind
That's not really how safety tests work as far as I know..
Just like a lambo... They passed all the required safety test so what's the problem here
The tree will crumple.
[deleted]
Except the site crashed and I can almost promise you there will be a 100k+ preorders before this thing is in production..... and inevitably it will be a toned down version of this truck by the time people actually get their hands on one. Look at any prototype unveiling and the final product.
And I love it. The fact that most people will hate it makes it even better. What are they gonna do? Scratch my paint? Oh wait ...
"I’m sure he cares about sales, he’s the CEO. However, he literally said not many people are going to like it. He also said they’ll most likely go back and do a different design if many people don’t order it."
"Nah, they might change the design and go after the market. They can’t even produce this at a capacity to fake on the big guys. It’s not possible. 

If you listen to the calls, he said not many people will like it and they’ll probably go back and redesign it."
"Rivian holds 5 people versus 6 for Tesla
Rivian 0-60 is 3 seconds versus 2.9 (obviously not a big difference) 
Rivian can tow 11k lbs versus 14k lbs. 
Rivian truck bed is 4.5 feet versus 6.5 for Tesla. 
Rivian range is 400 miles versus 500 miles for Tesla. 
The Rivian BASE price is the same as Cybertruck MAX price..."
"Status?  I have never once looked at a truck and thought ""mmm, such a high class individual.""

Edit: So many truck people with thin skin, I'm shocked."
"I agree. A truck is often used for camping, travels and other excursions. A roof rack helps carrying extra gear for that purpose. If the CyberTruck does not support a Roof Rack, that would make it less competitive to other trucks."
Why do you think it can't fit a roof rack now?
"Many criticize the design. Can you elaborate what you mean, please? Thank you in advance :)"
"You're upper middle class, if not just upper class. I'm middle class and make 35k"
"Surely the unqualified Middle class includes the median income, which at $60k or so definitely puts this out of grasp. Cars are becoming unaffordable in every market segment due to all the regulations. Teslas seem to have a 50% premium which really puts them out of hand."
"Actually, everyone has butts, so no matter what your gender is, what you just said is objectively incorrect."
"Tbh, trendsetters are the high end manufacturers. Lamborghini with Huracan, Mercedes with SLS AMG, McLaren with P1. Porsche Carerra GT was a trendsetter, Countach was a trendsetter, not this."
"I will too, to an extent. I'll drive something that doesn't impress anyone. But I won't drive anything that I know my freinds will give me shit for every time I hop out of the vehicle. This truck is the latter."
"Its ugly but more rugged than any other truck, the frame is the truck. No paint ro scratch"
"The 500+ version + the solar option for the rear hood is perfect for a multiday camping trip. I was going to get the 4Runner TRD next year but this feels to me that it'll outperform. 

I do want to see them do an offroad test. The baja element to it would be a seller to me if it can go around a dirt track at a good time."
Most truck owners don't really use them for their intended purpose.
Let's all agree to weld it shut
I think people are so caught up over the styling because tons of people in the US who own a truck don’t own it because they actually need a truck. They own it as a status symbol and to make up for other insecurities. That’s why people wanted an electric truck that looks normal.
Maybe I’m just spending too much time reading the other comments. Certainly seems like pretty much everyone hates it.
And I'm sure it will go back up
Ever seen an actual work truck?  Lots of dents and scratches.
Fair point.
"Haha ok I guess it‘s a thing if personal taste, preferences and so on. Hope you have fun with it when it arrives :)"
"I bet you loved Hummers when they came out, right?"
Honestly I think it's a little insulting to compare the H1 to this and I'm not even a huge fan of the H1. Hummers are ridiculous and massive but looking at them for what they are I wouldn't really even call them ugly. I don't see any way to look at the Tesla truck as anything but one of the ugliest cars I've ever seen.
"Sorry to break it to you but “beautiful” and “makes other trucks look dated” is not an “objective” opinion. Especially when most people disagree. 

Also something looking older isn’t always worse. We’ve been capable of building crazy future tech looking houses with tons of metal and zig zags and whatnot exactly like this truck is. But what do people build way more often? Traditional craftsmen homes, because they are more attractive even if “dated”. They also won’t lose all their resale value in five years when they still look good and things like this truck look insanely dated."
Happy cake day! I'm sorry about they released that.. thing in your cake day.
"They took my money, transaction alert hit and everything."
They are processing transactions. It is going through fine site is slow but it is really charging people
I see a very real $100 transaction in my bank records for it.
Nah it’s taking our money (preordered one).
"Yes of course, that was the same for the other models. But the point is that this is real, contrary to the previous comment."
He’s planning to use this on Mars.  And it will happen.
"Current cars can Awd with a single motor and no LSD, what are you even on about!?"
"I'm not aware of Tesla ever cancelling a product. They may change the design a bit, even retreat from the angles to something a little less edgy, but I don't see them not following through with this."
"Unfortunately for Tesla, 5 year olds make up a very tiny percentage of the market purchasing trucks."
Also dumber
"""Well you could have the Pors-""

Yeah I'll take the Porsche."
"No because it looks like ass for the average person, look at this thread."
It's the stopping that would be a problem
their track record of... producing 100s of thousands of cars already?
There is no way you can move furniture in this other than maybe chairs or very flat objects. I have hope that this isn't the final design and is just a very rough prototype.
Couldn't really see that in the demo .
"For me personally.

Needs: a steering wheel, good mirrors/cameras final configuration, and a 5-star safety-rating (is an exoskeleton safe?).

Wants: To be able to reach over the side of the bed.  Not a deal breaker though."
We wanted something that's not a wedge designed from the 80s or something a child/dad would make for their pinewood derby car.
This is Halo unconventional though. Not making it easy to get into the very conventional truck market.
"Sure, you can probably get a stripper for that much. You're not going to find one on a lot for that little.

Also, this is a half ton pickup, so comparing it to a 2500 is disingenuous at best.

A tarted up 1500 series Silverado can easily get into the 50k plus range. Comparing the performance Cybertruck to, say, a $60k Silverado 1500 with the 6.2l V8 (best towing rating for the 1500):

* Cybertruck wins on 0-60

* Cybertruck wins in payload

* Cybertruck wins in towing capacity

* Cybertruck wins in tech (lumping AP in with this category)

* Cybertruck wins in cost to operate

* Cybertruck wins in efficiency (not even close tbh)

* Silverado wins in price (since you probably aren't going to pay MSRP for it)

* Silverado wins on range"
"On Chevrolet's website, $35k will get you the two door that can only tow 11k pounds."
The windshield I transparent aluminum?
Lmao too much for the general public
People are already pre-ordering it so I think you're wrong.
"Like how the 1980s were inspired by the 1940s. And the 1960s were inspired by Art Nouveau. And how architecture is still inspired by 2500 year old Grecian ruins. 

Design is cyclical."
"No, it's just not pleibian enough for you to appreciate."
"Ha, within a minute of asking the question, Elon retweets this link and it arrives in my email inbox.

Thanks!"
Nice try Gary.
"It works now, I was able to get through. Some renders and we can see the interior"
What does unloading a 6x6 have to do with aerodynamics? And why wouldn't you use the part of the vehicle that is literally designed to load/unload a vehicle - aka the back where the liftgate is?
"Other guy isn’t talking about speed, he was talking about towing power. I’m aware that electric drives are much more efficient when it comes to building speed."
I’d be OK if they justified its design with functionality but it doesn’t even have that. It’s towing capacity isn’t anything exceptional and it’s bed is potentially the same size as a small truck but the elevated walls make it more awkward to use I would assume. At least show some footage of it being rugged or something...anything.
"My primary concern is whether or not I can carry stuff on it, like you know, a truck is intended for. Based off the design alone I know that I can't carry half the shit I could carry on an f-150. But atleast it can go 0-60 for the 3 people that actually care :)"
"counter point. Auto-pilot makes it less likely to hit a pedestrian. 

the extra toughness makes this ideal for outdoor activities and off-roading."
"LOL? Airbags? The AI’s driving, airbags will not be necessary then."
"Yeah, I considered holding off on buying my Tacoma to see what Tesla would come up with. Made the right decision lol."
"I must have Alzheimer’s, cause I don’t remember asking"
Wow...
"I'm really torn. With rivian, their front end looks ugly but the bed is still functional.  With the Cyber truck, the front is perfect, but the bed is terrible.  I guess we'll see what Ford does with the electric F150."
"That's just like, your opinion, man.  Lol seriously, people can either buy it or not.  I don't think Elon gives two shits, he already said people might not like it and they'll just put out a regular truck"
"I came in here to say that I like it and that I am buying it and you literally just took one part of my post and threw all this toxic negative thoughts on it. What is wrong with you guys? Get some help. 

I never experienced these type of responds on any other subreddit. Holy shit how much of an asshole can you be?"
"I don't have that problem at all. I like maximum utility, 4x4, cargo capabilities, and all the advantages of electric drive. I was blown away by the pneumatic tools setup. The only thing about electric vehicles that bothers me is when power grids go down. I would like to see a compact gas generator that can charge the system while running."
TIL! Awesome!
"Ford has very similar timing (not sure if earlier or shortly after) And there's Rivian too.  Tesla will finally be releasing a vehicle with competition, but Ford and Rivian still will have plenty of EV incentives on cost."
Wow smooth response there chief.
I definitely can but it's hideous. Looks like it was designed by a 5 year old.
I wouldnt drive this hideous monstrosity for free.
"I guess the armor vehicle doesn't have these restrictions/requirements. If true, Tesla may have to market it as armor, which might to be a problem since that is a very small market."
"Thanks. You definitely know the stuff. I don't know if these are actually against the law, so I will let others to comment. How for the crumple zone, it only applies to the front trunk right?"
"I work in construction man, I see this as more utilitarian than any other truck I know of on the market today so I am very confused by your statement."
Wasn't it the tailgate they tested? Tailgate up vs tailgate down and found that contrary to popular opinion tailgate up was better for aerodynamics.
"On a conventional truck design I thought the result was that its about the same? Having a mesh tailgate was better than leaving it closed though, or something like that.

Either way, the Cybertruck is  not a conventional truck design - with a cover there’s no steep drop off at the top and panels move air at the sides of the bed by the looks of it."
Whether or not it is worth it is highly dependent on body shape. In this case the key word is flow separation. The incredibly angular front and top likely benefit from being covered at speed.
"Well they didn't test this design, so I'm not sure that applies."
"> front lights don't pass U.S. regulations

Yeah I was wondering how much this thing is going to change before it ships."
Yes ugly.
"> futuristic, impractical maybe.. ugly tho??

It's not futuristic.  It's the 80's ""we want to be futuristic but we don't quite know how yet"" look.  Impractical, definitely.  Ugly?  As sin."
Many years ago Volvo raced a station wagon in the German Touring Car series (DTM).
They might allow compressed CO2 to be used with the system.  Brew your own beer on board :)
$7k for Full Self Driving you mean. AP is included in all models.
"F150 is 30K, and has a 500 mile range at its lowest MPG.  Similar towing capacity though."
Only issue I can think of is that the other motor would still be attached to the drive train while the third motor puts out more power than the second one is capable of handling. Unless the motor is disconnected or designed to handle it while not being able output as much power.
"good stuff man, hope you enjoy"
"Thanks for answering! That’s reassuring to hear, I was worried that you’d totally lose your spot."
and myself that wants a bullet resistant vehicle because it sounds amazing
"If you can only make and sell X number of trucks a year, does it matter if twice or ten times that number want to buy it?

I personally like the design a lot and I’m sure they’ll sell every unit they make."
You're just jealous you can't afford a tank
He basically did.
How is it impractical again?  Just because you don’t like the looks doesn’t mean it’s impractical.
But when the design is counterintuitive to its function it starts to become a problem
"Double the power of Americas favorite truck, faster than a porcha 911. 

> not particularly powerful 

The salt is real"
"Probably not dude. Afaik Tesla develops their own components, whereas Ford for sure will source theirs from a third party. No doubt that Fords will be a slick truck, but I doubt that it could be compared to anything Tesla will pump out. Ford may have an edge on a solid truck platform, but Tesla has cornered the electric market."
Yeah bc ford so far has completely matched tesla specwise........
But even say 400mi. How often do you genuinely do that in one stretch?
"Well, it is a showroom prototype, not a street configuration, should be obviously by lack of a steering wheel."
You mean breakable windows?
Oakland checking in
"School teacher, checking in."
He also says that Tesla will do a whole bunch of stuff via tweet that they never do.
Says what? I’m not allowed to think the truck looks like shit?
it's only 100 bucks lol
Yeah but 7k for auto pilot I think
why? I dont get it.
"Well it is an pickup truck , isnt it?"
"Dude, keep up, all I’m saying it’s faster than a porche."
"Nah dude. Just getting a laptop qualified as ""ruggedized"" is an *incredibly* expensive process. 

This would never pass. No electric vehicle will."
"Dude no EV is going to be onboard solar powered for a *long* time. 

Just stop replying."
Don't forget sand can cover the panels so you gotta keep them clean
You should be concerned
No
"Tesla has a fairly radical fanbase, downvotes are part of the territory here. 

I'm not in the market for a new truck for another 5 years, but I'm really hoping that this pushes GM/Dodge/Ford in the electric/autonomous direction. 

I'd really, really like to buy a new truck with autopilot and ~15-20k towing capacity, but I'm not brave enough for the design, and I think the price tag is about 20k too high."
"What does it not have, then? I’ve never needed a truck, so I’m uninformed"
"I personally do not. I watched with a friend who does though and he was pretty interested in it. He mostly does towing trailers or carriers (i'm not sure the terminology), helping people move large objects when moving to new apartments/homes, and DIY home construction jobs (both at his house and helping neighbors or locals). He especially liked the outlets being built in and potentially not needing a generator in certain scenarios as well as the ramp that pulls out of the lift gate/back flap or whatever it's called, and the air suspension. As well as the potential gas/maintenance savings obviously. The price range was appealing to him. I suppose maybe it depends on the specific job you're doing with the truck if it would be practical or not for someone."
"Yeah, because of the crumple zone. I’ll wait until the ratings come out but the physics of having a stainless steel exoskeleton, I dunno..."
Franz von Hulkhammer**
Just about any modern car with air suspension has an on board compressor. They have figured this part out a long time ago. Most times they use some form of dryer inline
"I grew and went to college in Minnesota and people I know with Teslas have a lot of issues with them in the winter. Minneapolis is already ridiculously cold, but my friends family has a cabin in Northern Minnesota where it gets down to around - 35F at night for more than a few days each winter. And those days it'll only warm up to about - 25F. They still spend a lot of time there during the winter since it's fucking beautiful and you get used to the cold pretty quick. But last year their family friend came to visit them there during a week when the weather was that frigid. The day he drove up it was warm enough that his Tesla didn't have too many issues. But by the next day it's battery wouldn't hold more than a 5% charge from their cabin's charger. Somehow they managed to get it to a supercharger station in Bemidji, about 30 miles away. But yeah, their cars aren't really practical in the Upper Midwest if you're outside a major city. I mean even in Minneapolis we get several nights around - 25F each year and days that might not make it above - 10F. And the average weather is still ridiculously cold. But at least there are plenty of super charging stations around. And people in the suburbs tend to have heated garages where they can charge at home. But hell, it gets even colder in other major regional cities like Duluth, Fargo, and Winnipeg. The latter two have average nightly lows around - 14F. And due to the geography you'll have to go on long distance drives throughout the winter since all the neighboring population centers and vacation cabins are so spread out. So adapting these vehicles to severely cold weather that isn't just a few degrees below freezing is a major issue that I don't think developers in California consider."
your explanation makes more sense.
is that what a trap is then?
"Or an effeminate anime boy, whichever one OP meant"
so ive just found out.
Pretty sure traps are guys who are feminine looking and then dress like a girl but still identify as a guy. So not trans.
"Nah, it's real. It was a mere clay model in September. It's not going to be 100% representative of the production model, and that includes mirrors and/or cameras.

What do you mean by all conversations have stopped? And it's a tell for what, that this is all a ruse?"
"Phew, that would be some next level stuff. I think the current truck is sweet but I'm definitely not opposed to blowing people's minds with a ""gotcha"".

Not sure they'd take pre-orders if it was fake though."
Never said they were!  Just stating a fact about Elon’s age.
"Explain exactly what guy you're talking about? The guy that tells someone that makes a stupid comment that their comment is stupid? I'll be that guy all day baby. 

You act like Tesla is a truck company. If if this truck doesn't sell well. You would have to be stupid af to think the company is in danger because of this."
"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
"They're opinions, they are valid either way.  Whether they are predictive of the sales success of this pickup is debatable, sure, but we have least two years before we will have any idea of that."
I also like it because it looks like 90's Lara Croft boobs
"I’m not saying it’s going to space exactly how it appears today. I’m just saying with the overall Design, it would seem to be extremely functional on a place like mars. Obviously there would need to be certain changes. Not too easy to pump your tires up with air in space"
I think you’re ignoring all the achievements on the part of SpaceX.
"SpaceX is testing a brand new vehicle for human flight. It’s already been to the space station once before, and the previous versions 10+ times. I don’t think they are struggling at all. 

Tesla’s first car came out just over 10 years ago. Now they are more valuable than GM. Every company has trouble doing things, but that doesn’t mean they will NEVER get better or do anything remarkable. That’s extremely simple minded of you."
Found the short
"They already got the capsule to the space station. An issue with the abort motors (which has since been swiftly resolved) is the only reason a capsule, admittedly, exploded. The rest of the delay comes from bureaucracy, primarily."
"Dumb statements. Why not mention any of their incredible revolutionary accomplishments rather than slather hyperbole? You’ll eat your words in a few years. And it won’t matter because you aren’t doing these things, they are, remember that, words cost nothing, actions are hard. And that’s why you’re bitter."
Agreed
Didn't downvote but ok
"VR is super easy to set up with inside out tracking. You literally just plug it in and put it on, lol. Once it goes full wireless it'll be even easier."
"I totally get where you are coming from, VR is not mainstream but thats what I mean.. It totally can and probably will be. It is currently expensive and a pain to setup - but even that, setup has got so much easier now in just a few years. Imagine it evolving to even easier use and cheap. I am an adult as well and even though I have VR don't really use it as it still does not compare to traditional gaming but the FUTURE of it looks great.

Tesla truck you are either going to love or hate for sure, but again personally what makes me excited is for what this will turn into - it already has everyone talking and there is deff a lot of good to take from this despite whether or not you like what this model/version has to offer for you.

I personally was surprised at the price - it seems reasonable comparing specs/practicality.

I am not saying you are wrong at all for what you are saying - I just personally took it like it is a bad thing companies TRYING to do something different,I really believe is a great thing to see in general. =]"
"I think expressing his opinion in a decent manner would be ""I didn't like the looks of the cars and I don't like how this looks, either"". Not:

Lots of Ridgelines on the road too.
"The tailgate is at about elbow-height when up.  Is that not normal?

What do you need tailgate assist for?

I see a lot of trucks on the road today with roll-up covers that seem to do fine.

You're right that the angled bed will be pretty annoying to reach from the side.

You didn't see any ties in the front much like you didn't see any mirrors.  Seems like a detail they'll add prior to release."
I don't think that's true.  I'm not convinced most of the side walls on that are that much higher than the bed of a typical pickup.

Thanks for the invitation to read up...I extend to you the same."
"Yes and no. There's plenty of things that fit into the market, but that doesn't mean they're appealing options. One example is here in Australia, the Ford Ranger is quite popular, whereas the Holden Colorado . A quick Google brings me to an article about May 2019 sales where the Ranger is the second highest selling model outright, whereas the Colorado doesn't even sell half as many.  


Tesla isn't a brand that's happy to sit in the middle and maybe be part of the existing game. They've pretty clearly aimed to go for #1 in segments they've aimed at, and give the other brands some homework to do. I feel like I can see what they're doing here. Partly. Other brands are heading into the higher end EV segment, so how does Tesla counteract that? They don't just release a new model, they release a fucking batshit crazy new model. Keeping in mind, they could've made the previous models much more extreme visually, but deliberately didn't to ease people into the idea of Tesla and the mass market EV. We're basically at stage 3, where they're stepping it up into another gear now.  


This is a bizarre looking bit of kit, but it's interesting. Which is something most other EVs can't say."
"Weird, I see moms everywhere driving Xs."
"Oh. Well ignore me, then. lol"
"I don't think the folks here are at all cognizant of what most of rural America looks like.  I come from a town that has 1 Ford dealership, 1 Chevy dealership, and no charging infrastructure.  Trucks are not ""utility vehicles"" to these people.  They adore Ford as if it were an NFL team.  Tesla may be selling vehicles, but Ford is still selling a lifestyle."
"Depends on where you live. In the Bay Area and LA BMWs, especially the 3 and 5 series and their SUVs, are Honda Civic level appliances. Wouldn't call them ""car guy"" cars."
I think It's more like Green Bay Packers loyalty.  Packers fans aren't going to jump ship just because the Steelers have a winning season.
Turns out Ford is also pretty decent at design :P
"There are several options coming out in 2020-21 so even if the tesla design is not for them there will be other options,  but a very common sentiment on job sites i work on is we love trucks but hate $100+ a week in gas.  but i also don't think the tesla truck was geared towards construction I'm not sure how a lumber rack would work on it or a truck box that would not require you climbing into the bed to get tools"
Ohhhh gotcha. They weren’t very clear.
"Gotcha, thought he meant just the truck itself. Didn’t see any mention of the trucks bed."

"Keep looking. There’s definitely a “WTF” factor the first time you look at it. I’m over the shock already but I definitely was hoping for a truck so uniformly awesome that Tesla would shit on brodozers. This thing is a Frankenstein’s monster.

Lol scroll down
"Dude, what?"
They allready do.
At least we will be able to drive Mars Rovers!!
">This is a SpaceX mars rover built for mars travel, manufactured in partnership by  Tesla and sold here on Earth to cover the development cost only.

Yep. Exactly this.

I predict that it will take off like the old Hummers and we will see a copycat or two before the first one leaves the assembly line."
"Eh, be open minded. Maybe it will grow on you. Pickups haven't been reimagined in a long time."
"And he'll sell trucks.

The looks will grow on people, just like every new radical design grows on people. Outside of that, the looks are irrelevant - in terms of specs this far outstrips every F-150 or any other truck in the same price bracket today.

Despite the looks it is more practical, stronger, tougher, and better than other trucks today. Truck buyers that actually buy trucks because they care about the utility trucks provide will make sure to take a close look at this."
"I would be all about the lower half of this camper cover thing they showed. Would make it flat all the way across and I think it would look great. Sorry for the terrible, terrible phone edit.https://i.imgur.com/OP4biwG.jpg"
The one thing I wouldn't worry about is power output...
"As much as a normal plug.

Because the battery pack provides a few hundred kW."
Does this mean it could recharge another EV or a home during an outage(assuming the home is wired for it)?
That was my initial thought about it as well. I'm wondering what they will say about it in the future.
No the assistants were retighting the clamps.  After each drop the clamps loosened and they fixed them.

"You haven't been following SpaceX much, have you? His whole philosophy is to fail as fast as possible, so they can move on to successful iterations."
In a crash this vehicle would cut right through anything and the driver would barely notice. It wouldn't even go out of autopilot.

Looks like only cup holders in the front at if you have the middle seat down. Not ideal
Or making tight turns.
Pretty sure it's also illegal to put a racing style wheel like this without a complete loop into a production car.
"Seems like faceplanting into the center display is arguably more problematic. But yeah, middle seat in the front isn't a great idea in the first place, for anything more than a ride down the block."
It's fucking hilarious watching a bunch of scifi geeks that are just Elon Musk nuthuggers get excited about this. Meanwhile people that need utes are laughing.
"You don't have to tell me, I've got three bikes! Convincing TESLA might be tough.

But a motorcycle is perfect for electric:

Usually short travel distance, lots of ventilation for cooling to the drivetrain, lots of start/stop commuting increasing the efficiency advantage over ICE, and perhaps most importantly:

LESS DEVELOPMENT COST! If somebody at Tesla is listening: motorcycles don't need crash testing, airbags, etc. Developing a motorcycle would be FAST! Go get Eric Buell on board."
"I’m curious if this is true for any driver, or if the data is biased. I’d assume that dirt bike drivers are generally more experienced, while any schmuck would hop on an ATV and crash it and die."
"Being able to see is an inherent part of self driving, ""just make it smarter"" isn't an argument. Costs will come down and nobody will care how it looks if it drives itself in more conditions. You can't plan your day around or build a business based on a vehicle that gets pouty and requires human input when it rains."
"> Computers don't get better at chess, go, or StarCraft by getting better vision, they get better through more practice.

This is because they already have perfect ""vision"" in these games and don't need better object recognition. If a computer couldn't tell whether a piece was a rook or a bishop, it would be a lot worse at chess."
"I mean, seeing better could help. No reason not to shoot for better than human vision. It's not as if human drivers have no problem with low/bad visibility conditions."
"Wtf would better vision even mean in go or chess, and yeah, in starcraft making an AI without any camera constraints is way easier than with them, and having a map hack in starcraft can make an amateur beat a pro."
"Self driving cars get better through better a combination of software and hardware. This includes training, but also includes having more information about their environment and lidar provides some of that info. Machine learning for something like Starcraft is very different to something that interacts with the real world."
All good homie
And maybe finish the interior as well
"It's like they loosened the glass in the last drop test. Did you see it bounce? A ton of the energy just went into making the glass bounce up and down. It's no surprise the actual door glass broke, since it can't move."
"Probably cleared their desks before the second glass broke, lets be honest."
"Tonight. Probably already happened.

""Elon, we kept telling you the glass cannot be shaped to-"".

""Shutup! Shut. Up."".

""But you refused to-""

""Enough! You're fired."""
Wouldn’t have happened if they were using Linux.
I imagine they tested the glass vigorously before installing in on the actual truck.
Exactly this. I preordered with full intent of purchasing because this is the fucking vehicle I’ve wanted since I was 7.
"If Tesla's basic package is 1 motor and the mid-level truck is 2 motors and the performance version is 3 motors, then wouldn't Rivian's 4 motors be even better?"
I bet Tesla collected more reservations than Ford did for their Mach-E.  At this point Elon could collect 50k reservations for a ham sandwich.
"Ford is behind and is looking for someway to not get crushed by competitors in a few years.  Take a peak at their stock.  Ford can and will hold Rivian’s hand through manufacturing, but Ford can’t help Rivian figure out mass produce a profitable EV, as they are now trying to figure that out too."
"I guess I just want to look like a supervillain lol. The network, ecosystem, stats, and price do it for me too"
Trying to grab muddy boots out of the bed seems like an impossible task in this thing.
Theres practical truck owners like yourself. Then theres truck owners who only have one for the image a truck potrays. They may carry some small loads around the city but they don't often use the truck for those kinds of things. The Tesla truck appears to be more geared towards that second group of people.
"Careful, this is a Tesla sub.  Prepare for downvotes for speaking ~~the truth~~your accurate opinion.  It’s hideous."
Selling my viper for this thing. I'm going to graffitti or wrap the entire thing in a synthwave/outrun style. It's so awful....I want it.
Towing is 7500 on the base model.
Yea...that's not true for any full size pickup on the road but OK.
"> that it gets 15 mpg on the highway, that it goes zero to 60 in 10 seconds, that it can be towed, kicking and screaming, up a steep hill, that it corners like a barcalounger

Haven't owned a truck in the past decade, have you? Modern half-tons ride like cars."
"You haven't driven a modern truck have you? They are comfy, fast enough to overtake, merge and go up a hil etc. And majority of truck owners don't care how their truck handles"
"I just got a free weekend rental of the 2019 F-150 Lariot. Its huge, comfortable, and has incredible pickup when I hit the gas. I got 15MPG city easily (didn't take it on the highway). The engine shuts off at red lights. I would buy one in a second if I didn't have 4 kids and 2 dogs. Instead, I have a 2016 Suburban. Its gets 21MPG highway, 17 mixed. I never have an issues passing on the highway.

There's a reason the F-150 is the best selling vehicle in the country and 20% of all vehicles on the road are pickup trucks."
"Have you ever actually driven a truck? Raptor not withstanding because that thing is not a regular truck by any stretch, your statement could not be more wrong. The F150 and Ram 1500 are incredible to ride inside. Air suspension, comfy interiors, great mileage due to cylinder deactivation and turbochargers, etc."
"Yeah I cant see why not. Obviously the guys at Tesla know more than me, but from a practical standpoint, unpainted stainless is not a great material"
"The electric is appealing to me as well.  I wish I liked this truck more.  I can't imagine buying a truck without the 500 mile range until more charging stations start popping up in remote locations.  $48,000 gas vs $70,000 gets you a whole lot of gas in savings though."
"But they don't give you the loaded milage. It take a lot more power to pull 14k than 0. There is no way that 500 miles is fully loaded. If it was pulling 14k for 500 miles, they would be advertising the 1000+ mile range, not the 500."
"Double? Not even close.  Sierra 1500 with the 6.2 can tow up to 12,000. Its base is right around what other trucks bases are (7,000-8000). Also the range is going to be no where near 500 miles if you are towing anything over 5000 pounds like a boat or camper through any sort of hills or mountains. 

A 3500 with a gooseneck can tow double what this can and you can get them in the upper trims for $58,000.

Have you ever even looked at trucks or know anything about them?"
"That's what I was thinking, it's still impressive, it behaved like windshield glass instead of shattering into tons of  pieces."
Good point.
">Luckily Elon is as well liked by everyone

Don't confuse this echo-chamber with 'everyone'.  I regularly hear people criticise him when he comes up in conversation."
Dude was high as fuck.
And this certainly won't have helped!
"I was watching on a 55” tv, it was very apparent, but quick."
The fact that the glass didn't shatter is still notable. Any average pickup truck would shatter with the same amount of force but the fact that he was touting it as unbreakable ruined everyone's perception of how strong the glass should be.
"Yea geeks stan for the dude, same with Apple etc."
Seriously. God forbid people enjoy themselves without me
Must pay for college first :( Dave Ramsey says CyberTruck is not in the budget (wife agrees).
It’s possible to be aerodynamic and not look like an obese Delorean
"Tried numerous times and failed? By whom and when did a fast, long range, rapid charging pickup truck get released and then fail?"
"I think it was actually ""oh my fucking god"""
"It very well could have been the combination of both too, the vibrations from the sledgehammer in the sturdy frame of the vehicle causing micro fractures. Maybe they didnt test both together."
"My feeling is that someone messed up, the glass was not replaced with the proper glass from Teslas new glass research department. This was regular tempered glass and that is why it shattered"
"Exactly. Remember the 2010 fiasco during the iPhone event, when everybody in the room had to turn off the WiFi, because the demos didn't work..."
"But this was especially bad after the glass broke. He had long silences with, ""erm, yea."" coupled with a super ""I don't want to be here"" look."
"You're also a 40 year old trying to stay hip with the kids these days, huh? It's tough out there for us. Keep trying, though. You'll get there."
"eh the point still stands for the same reason. the final design is  never really final until the manufacturing line is being tuned up and test run, so using 'production' to mean final design is not really accurate. a 'production' item would mean it came off the manufacturing line that is going to produce the actual commercial products and the design has been subjected to the little changes needed to fine tune the factory, so it does imply that the manufacturing line is mostly built and working."
Let's be honest. Elon definitely wrote a real gun into the original script.
The ball did end up in the crowd lol. Dangerous.
"You never did the pendulum test in science class, did you."
Glad that’s why *you* love Tesla. Now for the company to be successful it has to sell to people who aren’t like you. And this is awful optics.
"The entire goal of them throwing the ball against the window was for it to not break. It doesn't matter what bullet proof glass tests look like. Yes the glass is stronger than normal glass, but everybody just sees a car with two broken windows on stage. That looks worse than any other car with normal glass."
"You could tell Elon was livid, and that the demo didn't go according to plan. He 100% expected it to remain unbroken. To have it break twice was a disaster. Embarrassing. And now it's all over the internet. 

Besides, bullet-proof glass cracks because it's absorbing a fucking bullet. This was a small metal ball."
No idea.
"Roll overs? Pretty common type of accident, and eh, I've seen Tesla's catch on fire without any accident at all so...

It's very possible that you wouldn't even be able to open a door in some accidents due to obstructions rather than damage."
Because they didn't lower the rear ride height for the demo. I imagine they can get the rear prettyv damn low.
"Only when you NEED a ramp, which for most truck owners is pretty rare. Some of the newer tailgates from other mfgs are much more useful.

Source: Truck owner that wanted to like the Tesla truck."
"The whole theory is a shell not a body-on-frame, so it’s definitely not a model 3."
"True, although there is overlap now. A decent percentage of ice truck owners would be okay with around 400 miles of range, but not all of them."
"Good point! I still miss an affordable coupe on model 3 basis that focuses less on practicality and more on dynamics. Would be sweet! The Tesla Roadster is priced way above that. 

I personally would prefer a ""normal"" design over a cyberpunk one, but that is just me. And you´re right the truck as it is attracts a niche of tesla fans, definitely not F150 buyers. Not sure at all if that was a smart decision on Tesla´s part."
"Who knows, you might be right. I just showed my boss the truck (who is not a tesla fan) and he actually really liked it. 

It might do the opposite of what I thought which is attract new people to the brand and not just a small subset of tesla fans."
"I agree about the rivian not being for the general truck crowd, it is more targeted at the mid to high end suv market.

And that is a big market since SUVs are selling quite well. Not sure if the tesla would attract the same people that are in for a Raptor though since the design is just so far off base. But functionally they are indeed in the same category of high speed, rugged utility trucks.

At this point I have no idea what will happen with the Tesla truck, but I am almost certain that the polarizing design will make it impossible to sell a lot of them. This is definitely not a rival to the F150, that is for sure, but it might find its very niche market."
"Go to Google and type in ""Presentation is"" and take note of the final word that it gives you."
jesus what shithole city is that? worcester mass has a like 3 people at various stop lights begging for change but they arent aggressive.
I dont see people buying this truck for those reasons. It's a bit of stretch but I'll he waiting to see.
That was my thoughts. Who even cares how it looks when it’s a fuckin tank. I could see the military utilizing it
Aren’t all Tesla’s made to order basically?
And that is fine.
What about the granite dashboard? Perfect for slamming your head against in an accident.
That wasn’t safety glass. Tempered glass shatters into tiny pieces when broken.

It caters to the dipshit American truck guy. Something overly masculine
">Instead of making them strong, it would shatter on impact and the shrapnel would shred people.

I think you're thinking about [spalling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spall) which isn't an issue unless you're taking this thing into a warzone."
"On impact with what, an antitank round? The issues shared between the two probably aren’t anywhere comparable."
"Man, trying to explain this to some older people is like trying to convince them I have superpowers or something. They just dont want to believe that it's a good thing newer cars crumple like paper on impact. Its fucking physics man, if you dont have something to dissipate all that energy, the bodies inside are going to do it."
I always thought that. What’s so good about it? Or is it good for the time?
"An electric vehicle would be a terrible choice for end of the world preppers because if the world ends then most likely so does power generation. 

Sure there’s solar but then you have to pause a long time to charge which would make you vulnerable. Not ideal during the end of the world."
Well that's because the force was kind of relieved on the rest stands and I'm pretty sure that shape is very much different than what's on the truck.... Lol
"The glass was unclamped on the drop test so it bounced, the glass in the truck couldn't move. This was really something they should have tested beforehand, pretty basic physics right there that Tesla/Musk failed at. This was just super disappointing to see."
I’ll bet it’s because he knows it’s an odd design.
Ya but then you can push a button and switch to amphibious mode

"Anyone who actually needs a truck should care about its specs, not its looks."
"I have a bike, and an electric skateboard. The bike is larger. The bike has more parts (maybe? Perhaps depending on how you count). The electric skateboard is electric. 

In my experience, the bike is far easier to repair. In part because it is far less proprietary. 

I don’t own a Tesla. Not a hater. But, curious if this makes sense in that context"
"Sure you can anodize steel. It makes iron oxide, more commonly called ""rust."""
"eh who cares, it’ll offroad better for longer, and probably hold more shit in the bed. a hilux with a few jerry cans will go literally anywhere."
It’s more usable as a truck than what was presented last night though.
"Here's a better picture of what I was hoping for. You're telling me that the one presented last night is more usable as a work vehicle than this? I just want a fancy looking F150, but with Tesla's batteries and self driving capabilities :'(

Ding ding ding
It seems unlikely they'd design glass break strength for the potential human hitting the glass vs protecting the humans inside.
Are you saying that without the glass breaking ppl wouldn’t talk about this truck?
I disagree with the “all publicity is good publicity” notion. Bad publicity isn’t good and it would have had people talking if the glass hadn’t broke as well
Aslo no matter what they say that thing dont look as robust as a ford what so ever.
No roof rack requires extensive modifications. You're joking right? Lol.
Jesus man I’m not an animal.
"I think of it as a cause with a stupid point, brought to us by the descendents of the people who banned Christmas and music"
That looks great... I am a Tesla fan but if anyone say that this truck is looking good then i would never trust that person lol. Cyber truck is fucking ugly and the glass broke.
"Let's be honest, it's a Tesla and it will sell."
I get that. He’s very “real” up there.  I just think he should defer some of the presentation.  I’m not into the cult of Elon thing.
Look for when apple unveilings went wrong. You can tell Jobs was pissed off

Wonder if this will finally get Texas to recognize Tesla as a legitimate brand
"> “It’s something I’ve been wanting to make for a long time. If there’s only a small number of people that like that truck, I guess we’ll make a more conventional truck in the future. But it’s the thing that I am personally most fired up about.”

I believe it's from this: [Elon Musk: The Recode interview](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/18053424/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-boring-company-self-driving-cars-saudi-twitter-kara-swisher-decode-podcast)

"I mean, realistically, no pickup driver where I live is going to buy a Tesla truck anytime soon, regardless of how it looks.

Not initially going after that market is probably the smart play."
I want one too tbh

"I did use Tesla's motto, but it is/should be a goal of humanity. Humanity counts as 'we'.

And you had better believe that if Rivian goes public I'd be an investor. I can only put forward money because I'm too busy with biomedical research at work and working with my city on sustainability in my free time to start a car company."
Honestly the window test was actually impressive though it looked bad.  Those balls would have sailed through any regular car windows when thrown like that.
"Yeah, I have a feeling we'll be seeing plenty of pictures with the broken windows behind him."
Just like the Semi unveiling. Wow that was an amazing presentation.
What about not being able to reach 80% of the bed without crawling up into the bed?
">Everyone thinks it’s hideous and no one is going to buy it. Construction companies are going to be saving a fortune on fuel.

It should have been marketed as a fleet vehicle 1st and foremost. I'm not even remotely connected to anything construction, but I'd wager no one cares what a truck looks like on a job site as long as it hauls what you needs.

F1250 gets 22mpg in the city. Any good numbers on what it gets on a job site while it's hauling? gotta be sub 20mpg right?"
"If there’s a lumber rack solution I agree, but I’m not sure how that would work. As it is you can’t even carry a 10’ 2x4 with it. Looks like the bed is wide enough to lay 4x8 sheet of plywood flat with the lift gate down, as long as it can lock flat, sort of like the ridgeline. But I hate that the bed side rails slope up. You’re supposed to be able to access a pickup truck bed from the side."
"Well it'll be less expensive than my truck, i'll save a ton on gas and it looks like it'll be a blast to drive."
"No, you didn't. The glass wasn't supposed to shatter"
"Agreed. I think these would probably be pretty good for safety for most crashes since there would be no glass shards flying everywhere, but they still need to provide a means of escape in a scenario where you can't open the door."
I hope you don’t think I was capping on your mockup. It’s fantastic.
"Geez silly not too, way more fun. Looks like 3 year wait though.

""Kids we can go to grandmas house or fight Aliens , which would like? Stop at McDonald on the way to pick up some food and then ammo"""
that's a design rule that inevitably hinders aerodynamics and ultimately makes no sense in the sense of utility anyway. by your logic sprinter vans and worker vans without side passenger doors aren't useful to workers. classic form of gatekeeping to toss out an entire spec sheet because of a single design choice that changes behavior minutely.

"I'll believe it. Feels like online discourse has gotten pretty polarized. Easy to see how some love this thing, some hate it. Some want to argue that it's going to be the truck to end all trucks. Even if it were, there's room for more than one atop the pile, and my F-150 driving friends are eagerly awaiting the electric version of it!"
"I really get the sense that the target market wasn’t considered in the physical design of the truck - I genuinely think this was just Elon saying “Make me a gorram cyberpunk APC” and then giving it incredible specs and a really good price point.

I’ll wager that by the time these are getting made en masse, we see them announce a less-cyberpunk version."
Will do
Waited in line for 3 hours to take a test ride and someone came out and told us the rides were over and to go home. Really poorly handled event
Also ask if the rear window is stronger than the driver side front and rear windows.
It indeed is. And the shape of the vehicle is definitely not safe for the pedestrians.
"Fucking exactly. Another point is that people are acting like companies don't buy 12 trucks and need the most bang for their buck/performance/safety. Noone who's buying this gives a shit what it looks like. If it can drag an f-150 like no big deal, and be safe with good features while doing it, people are gonna want one.

Plus I think it looks cool lmao"
Mission statements are marketing lines.
It is what he is legally required to do.
Thanks!
And in rural America people use their trucks solely for weekend lowe's trips
I will get one and you can laugh at me lol.
"But rounded wheel wells wouldn’t look right on a polygonal truck. They can’t just go halfway and have clashing shapes, they have to go all the way."
Buyers don’t know what they want until you give it to them.
"this is seriously hilarious. every time i see people mention the price in this thread, it goes up. it had been 60 for a while and now some asshole actually made 70k. lol seriously wtf is wrong with you guys pulling out of your ass all the time."
"Sure, I'm not saying it has no practical value. I just don't see it appealing to regular Joe workman types because of the design.

And just so everyone realizes, I don't dislike it. I think it's kinda cool. Not my taste, exactly, but I don't hate it. I just wouldn't think of it as a pickup truck, but more as a fun utility vehicle."
I think it looks and is awesome.
"It has a frunk, no?"
"Not for me, it would save my ass."
"But the more I think about access Over the sides, the more i can see for some it would be a dealbreaker..."
"A recent study of 84,000 participants reviewed what factors influenced car purchases:

#1 was reliability 
#2 was exterior styling

Aside from reliability, the style is the biggest car purchasing factor. It even supersedes fuel economy... hence why trucks and SUVs are so popular as a status symbol and preference more than they’re actually used for said “utility” and “heavy duty”.

http://www.motoraty.com/blog/2016/08/07/top-5-factors-car-buying-decisions/"
"I didn’t say they only care about looks, but your first comment pretty much only cared about truck specs, which is also something most people aren’t doing. Maybe it doesn’t apply to you, but to the average car buyer, the exterior and interior looks are the most important things they care about. The average person is already hesitant when it comes to switching to an EV and I don’t see this being the car that’s going to get normal truck people to switch.

Hardcore truck users definitely do care about specs but I’d imagine they are pretty loyal to their favorite brand. On top of this, Ford has already said they’re making an electric F150 that’s supposed to come out a year after the Mach E, and that’ll take a large chunk of buyers that do want an electric pickup. There’s also Rivian who is a making a more traditional looking fully electric, although I question how popular they’ll actually get for the mainstream to know about them. I just don’t see who this is appealing to other than diehard Tesla fans."
"https://www.ford.com/services/assets/Brochure?bodystyle=Truck&make=Ford&model=SuperDuty&year=2019

Page 39. You are correct its that low with conventional towing depending on cab/bed/engine choices. But with gooseneck/5th wheel it can be higher. Its also not a perfect comparison because the base tesla tows much less and a ford of similar price to the top tesla is going to tow much more."
"Lol ok that's fair enough, you're right. Thanks for the reply."
"But this is a case of “it wasn’t broke for the past 100 years, so why fix it?”"
"The reaction to the model x and its doors is nowhere near the same level as this truck. Sure innovation can be hard to see, but Elon himself even said that there will be many people who’ll think it looks bad.
You have to be deeply in denial to ignore the fact that a huge share of the market is going to pass on this truck just due to the design. The model x at the end of the day looks like an SUV. This truck is a crazy looking polygon on wheels."
"-16 is max.  It has adaptive air suspension and can be lowered.

-It's fast when you need or want it to be.  Not useless at all.  
-This is a pre-production model.  I have no doubt mirrors will be addressed.

I'm glad he didn't make another cookie-cutter truck."
"That's what I'm saying. You can add a compressor, welding rig, and a fuel tank on to a base model diesel, or gas, for nothing. Any of the big 3 pickup brands are so easy to convert to a work truck. Tesla should just stick to cars, especially after the ""Cybertruck""."
Well I'm from Australia so with have the baby F150 the Ranger. The Raptor Ranger looks amazing but only has a 2litre engine. Imagining one of these electrified with a 5 second 0-60 would be phenomenal. Oh and extra storage in the front for shopping!
Had to double check. Looks like at over 60k you can push it to 13k on the 150. These new ones are pretty nice. My 2008 f150 was no where near that with the v8 and tow package. What I’m liking here is the no paint concept. Always worried about scratching my ole truck. That could be a cool thing to do on the 150 if the body panels were scratch resistant like the stainless steel here
So... normally refundable when something is unveiled.

I mean but the sales from a truck like that could help them expand their business even more. This thing would probably have outsold the model 3 if it was designed better and they could ramp production up over time to satisfy the massive demand. I get they have a lot on their plate but it doesn't mean they should waste their time on something that has so little potential. The model 3/Y will sell better in other parts of the world but domestically the largest market is the truck market. On top of this the largest polluting vehicles are also trucks so dominating that market probably should be a top priority.
If you can take a dick you can take a joke? I dunno what to tell you lol.
the aztek had one of the highest consumer satisfaction ratings in history!
If using flat objects. A 8' plywood sheet won't fit in a 6.5' bed anyway. There is no way a sofa or any large furniture will fit.

"The vault comes up and down. Up when you’re not using the vertical space. 

I get that about a longer bed or less seats but really I’m not too bothered about it because of how the design itself complements and allows 6 seats without a drawback. Still glad it has a full sized bed though!"
Thank you! For the breakdown. Was very curious....I'm not sure why I got downvoted for asking a question.....
I don't disagree
"It's great that you'd like to change the subject, but that wasn't what I responded to."
They did learn their lesson to an extent. It’s still just a Honda Pilot with a bed sadly
"No access from the sides of the bed for one, awkward bed shape also prevents fifth wheel towing like you see in actually powerful trucks, overdone design in an effort to be simple detracts from the middle America that buys these things

This is as functional as a Hummer H1"
"It's the simplification in other areas that makes this a pretty underwhelming truck, especially compared to competition."
"They made it a triangle because it’s a very strong shape and the body here actually carries weight, I don’t think the price was the main consideration. 
The shape is simple and strong - just several triangles. 
It is probably aerodynamic too (more so than other trucks)"
"Looks like the exoesqueletons goes all the way, hope im wrong about this"
"I did say almost. Some you can't.

Judging by the stupid looks, I would be surprised if that same stupid decision onaterial was made.

What a swing and a miss on this thing!"

"The charging infrastructure is a huge deal.

That extra 3k is is roughly a 22 percent increase.

How a vehicle presents it’s owner is the not sole reason for buying a vehicle."
To be honest. I was shocked and it was a WTF moment. But I like it!
"People that need 120v/240v/Pneumatic in a brand new truck with warranty all under $40,000 can get a lot of work done with it. Think skilled trades with power tools.

In the city as repairmen, craftsmen for retrofits/upgrades, even some craft work on new construction.

Think of it as a replacement for vans, suvs, and such that workmen travel in and work out of. It'll seat 6 if you need to take your crew out to lunch. Or you can fill the ""back seat"" area with custom storage and have a vehicle that still seats 3.

If you need to haul uncut timber or pre assembled roof rafters or something crazy this is not that kind of work truck."
Great questions. It’ll be interesting to see what information comes out as they get closer to production and start crash testing.
You would have to cut out and weld in a new panel same with any other car. Problem with this one is no paint to cover repair area.
"Yes, to me the pricing is crazier than the wacky design. The base model is priced even below Model Y. 

Rivian will get more love calls from someone who expected traditional trucks, but they will hesitate to pay Rivian premium for that."
"Honestly it's the roofline and the rear end (tail gate area) that look so off to me. I'm wondering if a KC light bar on the roof just in front of the high point of the roof would help smooth out the sharp angle? 

The aftermarket industry has quite the blank canvas to work from on this thing."
How did you re-watch? Can't seem to get access to it now that it just takes me to the pre-order page.
"I didn’t see that, thank you for clarifying. It’s interesting that he would do that, being that the other Tesla range blends in very well with other popular sedans and coupes. They’re all very safe body styles, whereas this was very daring."
Yuk
"I remember having a lot of issues trying to stream the Y event, I’m hoping it’s easier/cleaner this fo around. Want to stream in bed on the Xbox instead of staying in the front room, this way the wife has to watch it some haha..."
Well I would hope that Tesla recorded the thing locally and would put out a non-choppy version.
You’re not wrong. It definitely looks different and that’s what’s making me grow on it.
"I agree battery costs are only getting cheaper and that as production increases, streamlining will lower costs, achieving economies of scale. They have impressive preorders too, I didn’t realize they had so many. 

But can Tesla turn a profit/car while recouping their development costs? I’m skeptical. They have to build an entire production and distribution channel from scratch in addition to the learning curve associated with honing an entirely new product line. The R&D for this thing was off the charts, guaranteed. They have to get approved to drive it on the roads and in crash tests. Also expensive. Gotta market the thing, expensive. The list goes on. 

Ford announced their Mach.E will be profitable from launch. This is rare for new vehicles. I think it has something to do with Tesla doing all the research and opening up their patents. So while all the other automakers capitalize on Tesla’s investment, Tesla shoulders their burden."
"So Elon musk announced they only have 146,000 preorders. Still good, not even close to the 200k you suggested though."
At least one was body on frame. But yeah.
I know several Texan truck owners who swear by the Ridgeline. The bed has a lot of utility apparently that offsets the weird sides.
"True, on the other hand if you need to access your tool box at the front of the bed you can just drive your quad up and grab it."
Can you really reach into the sides of a bed on a modern truck?  They're extremely high.
"Yeah, I was going of the text saying it's ""impenetrable"" aaand then that guy through a rock softly and cracked the window lol.  I take my question back ha"
I suppose. Thanks! :)
Just a marketing term. It’s just tough glass.
"To be fair--they threw a fucking metal ball at the windows.  Not a tennis ball--a fucking metal ball.  From the info provided, the windows had already been tested before when they weren't on the vehicle--put them in a vehicle where they cant flex, then yeah--they are going to crack when a huge ball bearing hits them.  That's what caused the ""Elon? Are you sure?"" comment right before he threw the ball.  

Id say this:  Regardless of all of the above--anybody who complains about glass breaking from metal balls and ties it to ""build quality"" should probably have their head examined.

Ordinary car glass would have shattered and let the ball go right through."
"Honestly though, it's not like that's a new thing. Laminate glass already exists on the car you own on the front windshield that prevents it from shattering in your face after a road strike. The fact that it's not on the sides and rear windows is actually what's surprising. Now if Tesla can cook up a legit indestructible glass for those positions then I'll truely be impressed but as of now, combined with what that thing looks like...meh."
It feels as though you don't know what a [fifth wheel trailer](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4e/2c/45/4e2c45fd1653ddb162be8712edc8c4c7.jpg) is...

"Well with how tesla usually build their vehicles, I'm pretty sure they can switch the whole body off the battery chassis."
"Ya, as someone who does crawling the thought of having throttle modulation for each wheel would be a game changer, but it looks like the wait continues."
"You can't mod this thing, it's a unibody..."
"It caught a lot of flak for its specs. No 3G, no copy/paste, no video recording, a single carrier option, high price, no MMS, and general skepticism of demand for such a product. Just look at some initial impressions:

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying the Batmohummer is the iPhone of trucks. I just mean initial takes by tech-savvy folks can often be way off the mark."
"People in the audience lost their shit, many others wrote articles on how bad it was. How people needed keyboards, how the screens would break all the time, etc etc. [Steve Balmer, techcrunch, the guardian](https://bgr.com/2016/07/01/iphone-reviews-original-negative-ballmer-dvorak/).

They Y meltdown of people claiming it was just a jacked up model 3 was enormous. Everybody and their mother was posting on how it didn't look right and how dissapointed they where and what a missed oppertunity it was. How unlike the X. The most used word was ""dissapointement' even though as you say they told the public exactly what was coming, just like with the cybertruck. I read exactly the same things today."
Dude i love teslas but this thing is doo doo . what the fuck haha
"> The battery pack is probably so heavy it would tip the forklift XD

Put the battery pack IN the forklift."
"There's a huge difference between a grille and the entire form of the truck. My dad thinks Teslas look like any other car, and doesn't know he's looking at one until I point it out."
Why does it make any sense in your mind to compare to a 3500? He said F150 how many times? Use common sense
Tesla truck beats out every truck on this list also: https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/best-trucks-for-towing
Who? Lol
Frunk
Yeah.  Truckla is actually more functional than this thing.
"I don't buy a truck for aesthetics, I buy it to haul tools, equipment, and construction materials. I want to be able to remove the entire back half of the truck if necessary, and the exoskeleton concept makes that impossible."
I said a proper toolbox.
one size fit all toolboxes don't work
Good point! Haven't seen it this way.
"Frankly, I'd rather not see a bunch of people buy this that would otherwise buy cars.  Modern trucks are huge, and Cybertruck utilizes the same size footprint, but is even larger by volume, due to the design.  Roads are already congested enough without adding more overly large vehicles for people doing little more than commuting to work."
"damn, was gonna post a lazy photoshop of my own haha! I personally think it would look better if it was just a straight drop, but to each their own I guess."
"The ability to strap long pieces of timber to the roof?
Side access to the tray?
The ability to get repairs/parts in the outback (I guess you don’t really have remote locations in the US but that’s a big deal here in Aus)"
There's a lot to complain about with this design. You are likely close to alone in thinking 6.5' bed is an issue. I was pleasantly surprised to see a full-length bed. Yes - 6.5' is considered full length.
No I was actually half agreeing with you lol. I live in the city so I don’t know jack shit about what some red necks want. That said I’m sure spec wise it offers more then an average pick up truck. If they’re turned off by the look of it then I guess they’ve got some self image problems what can I say.
"Exactly this. Also I didn't see side mirrors. How are you going to see shit when you're towing?

We get it, trucks are ugly, but the bed looks like that on real work trucks for a reason. This is a cool Baja runner and off road toy. It competes with the raptor, not the 150."
"I agree with you about the sloped sides of the bed.  Almost everything else you mentioned is a huge assumption based on a cursory look at the vehicle.


The outlets are hidden and tie points/rails might be hidden too.  We have no idea what can be done with the front or the back.


Why can't you rhinoline it?  What makes you say that?

You are going to damage the spacecraft grade pressed stainless body by twisting it?  What are you dropping in your truck?  What truck *can* handle whatever you're thinking of?"
"That doesn’t mean impractical, that just means not suitable for every use.

As a weekend outing vehicle and daily driver, along with light utility work, it seems extremely practical."
"I agree with the bed sides comment. Make them horizontal, not sloped, so people can access the bed from the side of the vehicle."
"With that heavy steel, why would you need a bedliner?"
"And in all honesty I won't even use it for any of this lol

I want another Tesla..they made a cool truck. I don't haul dirt and switch out truck beds so this all doesn't even matter."
"This is a toy, not a truck."
"Since when can you not rhinoline a steel box?

You're making a lot of assumptions. With a strong stainless exoskeleton I would imagine there would actually be a lot more opportunity for third party fabrication."
"Well shit, I thought it looked great and I think this is just downright ugly and disproportionate."
lol you think i dont know about him? GUH
"Good point, I didn’t really think about pure elastic deformation. That should be able to take a large about of energy, but the deceleration would still be VERY rapid compared to a crushable structure which I’m pretty sure is a major thing tested for. All in all though, I’m sure Tesla engineers know a lot more than me"
"I don't think you're looking at crash safety as a whole system. The more material and space there is to absorb energy within reasonable design limitations, the better. There is a reason that modern car doors are thicker, the pillars are thicker, there is more space between the seat and the door panel, etc. Cars are generally larger and heavier in all dimensions these days, as the goal is to absorb crash energy before it gets to the people inside."
"Last reply because you sound incoherent. No point in saying sorry if you already new you were being a dick. Secondly, word salad would imply I said a bunch of things that had no relation to the next, which is the opposite of what I did. I named many different current technologies that prove we are living in an age dominated by the prevalence of the fruits of the scientific method, and then related that to how many people would appreciate if the aesthetics of things, in this case cars, reflected that fascinating and uplifting reality. ""Futuristic sounding words"". Bruh, they have apps that make expanding your vocabulary fun. Try it."
"An unmanned rover isn't a car, as an unmanned aereal vehicle is not a plane"
hm would that could as a car tho?
">but that still doesn’t help if I need to reach over the sidewall of the bed for any reason.

Have you tried that on any late model truck?  Everything built in the last decade I can't just reach into the bed and do more than touch the bottom right near me anyway and I'm average height. My 2wd Dakota is lower than any new truck, even a Ranger.  

>because the bed is too short to be useful.

That's hilarious. I hauled all of the supplies for an entire room remodel,  I mean like 25 4'x8' Sheets of cedar paneling and a dozen 6' cedar fence pickets to saw up into baseboards and trim  in mine with no problems.  
I've also hauled a full length couch in it as well as hauling a bathroom vanity for a remodel, and I used it to bring home my new stand up 50 gallon air compressor. 
  
All you have to do for long stuff is prop it on the tailgate or let it down and properly secure the load. You made me lol with that drivel."
"6.5"" bed"
"F-250 doesn't only come with a diesel engine.  People who use their truck for work are certainly going to care about charge times.  People who use their truck to haul things are certainly going to care about charge times.  

If you are comparing to an F-150, the Tesla is over $10K more expensive...."
Those were good looking cars *then*. They did not age well. The cybertruck is dated from the factory.
"I would be curious about torque management also.  Crazy acceleration/ unlimited torque while dragging 12,000lbs requires one hella frame attachment."
"Well you can agree then that you are in a specialised field and need quite specific measurements. It's not impossible that the might get a longer truck out to market but you can't make a truck for every eventually and make it low cost as well. It's a shame that you'll mis out on this, because I like it, a lot."
"I've read that a lot, but I've also read that almost all big trucks don't allow for sideloading for their height alone. Unless you're a giant and stand on tires."
Picking it up tonight :P
"Yes, but Lisa is the practical one and probably would design something like this."
*reservations. I myself put one down as $100 is such a small bar for a reservation and it can easily be refunded at any time.
Let's see what happens with NI and Brexit first ;).
"Oh don't worry, [NASA crawled up SpaceX's ass with a microscope](https://mashable.com/article/nasa-review-space-x-elon-musk-weed/) for that already."
You’re basing you’re whole decision off a truck? What stupidity have we come to. The model X is an awesome car.
Raptor does look badass too. This is just a different badass.
It would be in Tesla's best interest to provide them somehow if they want a slice of the law enforcement market. Certainly seems to be a solvable problem.
"Of course you have to remember to charge it, but most agencies don't have mulitple police vehicles just sitting around idle, especially $80k vehicles. Much quicker to fill up with gas. 

Not to mention running out of power during pursuit -  [https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-police-car-low-batteries](https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-police-car-low-batteries) 

These are definitely solvable problems."
"Not very often at all, but when you do get shot at, I'm sure you'd want to be in one of these."
"I don’t know how far a patrol car drives on a shift, so the limited range of 250 miles might not be an issue. And likewise the recharge might not be an issue either cause I don’t know what percentage of the fleet isn’t in active use at any given time."
I wouldn't see it as out of character seeing as how they make Semi trucks. A Tesla transit van would sell better than a Mercedes sprinter. I think this was another opportunity to secure the business of companies looking to clean up their fleets for new environmental standards.
">If that's your biggest gripe on its versatility, even if more significant than I am thinking... Cybertruck is still vastly more so than any other vehicle of similar price

I understand what you're staying but I just can't see how this could possibly be true when it isn't compatible with existing aftermarket equipment for vehicles that have a body on frame. Having a bed that is integrated with the cab means companies that would consider switching to Cybertruck may not be able to to use equipment they already own due to the new platform. 

This isn't the market Tesla is shooting for here though, Cybertruck is an adventure vehicle like the Rivian line of trucks and SUVs, I just think they are missing out on a bigger market of truck buyers like organizations that maintain a fleet of specialized vehicles."
"> Exactly, unless you're trying to hide from radar I don't see why they'd go with this design.

This thought makes more sense if the military ends up being a major customer. Light duty STEALTH APC. Maybe call it the Tesla LDAP-C.

(But is radar stealth a useful thing for land vehicles? Ships on flat seas, ok. Aircraft, ok. Land vehicles, idk.)"
"Nah, the people buying the large, full size trucks aren’t going to be in the market for this atrocity. This is more targeting owners of Tacos, Colorados, Rangers, etc....those trucks have easy access beds for most average people. This isn’t a truck, it’s an SUV."

"Yeah i dont think thats as big of a concern as everyone thinks. 

Is getting sucked into the front drive and suspension of a stock Raptor preferable?"
Mmm I only see my Model 3 on my account 🧐
I got a Reservation Number as well. Maybe delayed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
If it is anything like past unveils you can do it later when the systems catch up. I was able to change that around when the 3s were announced
I'd say it's polarizing. Not a lot of opinions in the middle.
"Rivian is a startup.. they need to start slow and ramp up, just like Tesla did. Even Tesla couldn’t have handled going from 0 to 100,000 units a quarter off the start.

Maybe after 5 years they can release a cheaper vehicle that will sell big and take a cut into their more expensive product lines. By then they should have business figured out.. or not!"
"Red?





/s"
"I'll put 3/4 of mine, not gonna lie, into this."
I definitely would have signed up for a pre-order. I can't buy that thing. I really do hope they come to their senses and do a redesign.
Hahaha what? No those are all after market and not even close to 90%
Those covers are all after market.
missed that. thanks
Yeah it definitely felt like a race to walking off the stage at that point.
Which means 2022 cause Tesla never meets it's schedule.
"What if you ecoat before primer? Does ecoat have a problem with stainless? I think the bigger issue with painting it is that you have to go through paint bake which will reduce the hardness and yield strength of the ""super cold rolled steel"". Kind of defeats the purpose."
"what a great explanation, totally makes sense now /s"
My welcome?
"I believe the 100$ fee is non-refundable. But it is only 200$, so you may as well reserve all 3 for the flexibility."
Ow i get it now
Better it crack the windows than your skull me thinks
Rocks are much softer than tool steel. It would have to be a pretty big rock.
Yes thats not the case with model 3 where ether both gas and kWh are cheap or in my case both are heavily taxed with kWh disproportionately so such so over time both all side of Folketinget actually keep lowering. But like 30% of 300% :(
Most of his time was spent hitting the car with a hammer and breaking the windows with balls. The focus was totally off
"I can't get a good handle on exactly how it is built, but it looks like the body is flat sheets cut to shape rather than stamped.... But my guess is there is a light internal frame and the body panels fit around that.

Perhaps robots will place the panels on the car in sequence....

So I would not say probably not mostly manual labor, just not the level of automation they attempted with Model 3, at least initially..."
"Stylish by definition means fashionably elegant and sophisticated. This is neither of those things. This is a joke of some sort, I'm sure of it. They just reused the scrap steel from that exploded Starship."
I'm not.
So what makes a truck 'practical' to you?  A bed to haul stuff?  A towing package to tow stuff?
"It's what I've always wanted but gave up upon actually owning one long ago knowing that no manufacture is actually going to make one looking like this. 

I'm glad I was wrong. Can't wait to see these trucks on the road."
Wow even better
Hardcore Jeep folks install compressors so they can air down tires for off-roading and fill them back afterwards.
"I'm not saying it's exclusively the jeep market. if you drew a vin diagram of of vehicle uses, the tesla truck has more overlap with the ""truck as a toy"" segment than the work truck. it can still do both, but it seems more targeted toward the fun side than the practical side"
it's a 6.5ft bed. I see lots of f150s with tailgate extenders on beds that size.
"Oh ok I thought it was more of a commitment. And yeah, this thing is truly bizarre. I like it, but I know that most people I talk about it with will call it ugly... shame"
"I did. I own a company and want to get rid of my personal F150 for this truck. I'm not doing that. 

I'm not saying it doesn't have good features.

I'm not saying there isn't a niche.

I'm saying the majority of company truck buyers (me) ain't buying this."
Fair
"The main use for laminated side glass isn't for safety or theft prevention as some people might think... It's for noise suppression. Because the material changes from glass to plastic and then back to glass it transmits much less noise than a single pane of glass.  


It's true that it does make theft harder which I believe is what Tesla might be trying to demonstrate here. However, no type of glass is impenetrable. Because, when you get down to it. It's only glass with plastic in between it. So a sharp instrument such as an axe will be able to penetrate the glass and cut the plastic layer."
[deleted]
Hope you're only planning on towing from the bumper too because there's no way a goose or 5th is happening here.
Aztec/Aztek.  They fixed it.
"I think the one thing I’d change before anything else is the pyramid-looking roofline. Alter that to be flat and we’re golden. Enough people pushed back on the Model 3’s duckface that it got changed, so why not?"
Have it yet? Do a password reset with your email address. You'll probably see your pre-order.
"It's worse considering Musk claimed the Tesla would tow 300,000 lbs, carry a 5,000 lb F-150 in the bed and have at least 400 miles of range."
It’s only natural really. Reduces drag immensely.
Cybertruck for the next Mad Max?
"The number of collisions and the risk of collisions are the same things just plotted differently. If however you’re referring to severity of collisions, then that too increases as the risk of collisions increase - not drastically but enough.

So again, I disprove of abolishing basic and vital safety regulations under the argument of “well we’ve been pretty okay so far”"
Why would I need a truck then if I am going to put by tools in a trunk. I will just drive an SUV..........
You can't ever see a need to reach the front of the bed of your truck? Have you ever used a truck in your life?
That is good. I love my Frontier and have been googling electric vehicles as I cannot wait for one to come out and get one. I like having a pickup and I am hoping this is not the final design.
"Long term I can’t see this going anywhere, there’s got to be such a small demographic of buyers who are willing to spend this much money to look like an idiot driving down the road every day. This looked cool when I was 6, not grown up searching for viable electric transportation to buy.

If this is Tesla’s answer to the obvious market demand for electric pickups then they clearly aren’t taking it seriously."
Its crazy. And at that price I will purchase crazy. I need a truck to operate my business and this thing should haul my trailer with ease
I disagree with your statement .this hasn't tarnished their name Tesla is known for being different with their cars. The truck is ugly I agree but it is growing on people and it technically is still a concept truck. Nothing is set in stone .. they are testing the waters . This  will provide a lot of information for Tesla. How far can they go with a design and still have people's support . This is pretty far . They are doing what other car companys dream of.. when it comes to concept cars
"Surely cameras can be accepted as mirrors. As for bumpers, I don't think anyone here knows what a bumper has to look like or be like legally, to be accepted as such."
"like i said, fanboys will be all over this thread and preorders. let’s see how many of these Tesla is selling 6 months after people start receiving preorders."
You can't fit drywall in a 6 foot bed
"So do I, I would love an electric truck that could tow a fifth wheel trailer.  This can't."
"Sure, but it’s *$100* which is an order of magnitude less than any other reservation price they have done. It’s such an insignificant amount that the number of “reservations” is meaningless. People are out there saying they’ve ordered the truck when they have put up a fully refundable c note. It’s a joke."
Already bought two shares myself.
"> Yes but if you want to appeal to a larger market you stick close to the popular designs trends

I don't disagree at all. I stated my opinion that the design is highly polarizing.

All I'm saying is that it's not a ""Prius'd"" situation.  While they are both polarizing, the Prius design is a result of compromise for the sake of aerodynamic efficiency.  To say something is ""Prius'd"" means that some element of aesthetics was compromised for utility.  

On the other hand, there was no compromise on the aesthetics of the CBT.  Whether you agree with the aesthetics or not is a different issue altogether; Musk absolutely did not compromise on his vision of what he wanted to build.  You and I think that vision is a stupid business decision, but I think you would agree that he did not compromise at all on his crazy ass vision."
"The Rivian just looks the same as every other truck on the road. Cybertruck is different, and that was the goal, but it's definitely going to be a love it or hate it thing. We'll see how the greater population splits on it."
"Yes.  I like the exoskeleton idea, the stainless, the adaptive ride height, ground clearance, 120/240 V outlets, pneumatic outlet, etc.  Basically everything except the look.  I am not ashamed to say I HATE the way it looks."
"Lol because I was excited? I CRITICIZE ALL BILLIONAIRES. Elon is a cunt, but I like Tesla’s products. Except this. This is ugly as shit. Electric vehicles are the future. But this is going nowhere. 

I stand by my position that their should be no billionaires and that stopping the push for the gen 1 solar roof was a shit move. That isn’t 50% of my history though and before this was the only two  times I criticized Elon."
"Yes, mounting points on the bed are standard, and the dealership often has them as add on options. Also canoe, kayak and bicycle racks that are bed mounted."
"You're right.  It is subjective.  It is subjectively the most ugly piece of badly designed shit I've ever laid my eyes on.  It's a joke and does not belong in the lineup of Tesla's other vehicles.  I really think anyone who finds this attractive has some weird fucking tastes.

Seriously, if Tesla decides this is their *new* design philosophy with all their future re/designs, I'll no longer be a fan and question anyone who remains."
"So you would have wished the original Roadster had this design philosophy?  Same with the S, X, 3, and Y?  Really?  You blind?  Do you have someone explaining in bad detail how this thing looks?"
"Yeah, I hope.  Tesla will be fine, I don't see this joke doing much harm to their company but seriously wtf were they thinking lol"
They have job sites that won't have this truck on them.
"If the market that the cybertruck is intended to compete in is the F-150 or Dodge 1500, then isn't the 6.5ft bed pretty normal? Maybe Tesla needs to come out with another vehicle for the larger market."
Ah good point! Thanks for the insight.
"How many billions are people going to lose betting against Tesla before they learn their lesson.  You are calling this truck trash, but that’s based on absolutely nothing other than your own personal feelings on its design.  Tesla designed it this way because they think it will sell.  Not to you, but to a profitable portion of the American car market.

Sorry that a multi-billion dollar company didn’t build you the exact car that you wanted, but Tesla knows a lot more than you do about how to sell cars.  It’s not trash just because you don’t like it."

Elon said the pickup truck is higher priority than roadster and semi. I think we can expect the truck within a year honestly.

"I don't think it was super awkward, he actually handled it pretty well, he was laughing and made that fix it in post joke.  People were laughing along with him.

Steve jobs, who was the king of presentations, when he had his demo fail he was angry and irritable and that was super awkward"
Nice!
More people talking about it breaking than if it didn’t.
its not an SUV for a start and yeah they do. the Mitsubishi warrior for one.
"Yeah, I've never been there. But I was just commenting on similar size"
"It may not, but to those it doesn't appeal to, it won't be because of the price."
"3/4 ton. 

The top trim 3500 is like 90k this year I think."
I guess we'll have to see in the future how good or useful it will be. It was a shock to everyone and I think that's what Elon was going for. The broken windows were an unfortunate mishap that kind of ruined the mood and made it easier to make fun of it. I did enjoy it pulling the F150 uphill though. There will be a market for this truck but I don't think anyone was expecting it beating the ol' threesome in sales anytime soon. I'm just glad someone has the balls for doing something different and not caving in to the status quo.
"They protect passengers if two cars that have them collide with each other.  This is better than two cars without them colliding with each other, because in that case the passengers are tossed around like ping pong balls.   If a car without them collides with a car with them, the people in the car with the crumple zones are toast."
Rivian has 4 motors
"Spelling errors happen when typing on your phone. It’s a no issue that you’re glomming onto because you have no point otherwise. The vehicle looks like shit, Ribin will make a better truck as will Bullingor."
Are you aware of the concept of hyperbole?
"I think they could heat trace the track and make it resistant to damage from pressure washing. My after market tonneau cover freezes down as it is but its still better than shovelling snow out of the box. As long as there is a clutch or electrical amp limiter so it doesn't tear itself apart when it hits a snag, kinda like a sun roof has, I think it should work. I sure hope they do realistic winter testing before they build mine."
Surely functionality is more important to a farmer than fashion/style? Since when do farmers care about looks?
6.5ft bed ain’t small... most trucks are 4-5.5ft.
"Speaking from a utilitarian perspective, climbing on a stranger's truck, especially one with sentry mode, is not smart.

Where I live, fucking with a stranger's truck like that could be tempting fate. (Contrary to popular belief, not all Tesla owners are stereotypical skinny-soy-latte-sipping-vegan-California-hipsters)"

Well like i said
"First dude described it as a car. Next dude responded saying it's a truck. Second dude isn't calling truck owners, ""idiots"". Redditor is just commenting a ""gotcha"" joke."
And the sensor will tell you all the regular parking spots are too narrow.
Most off-roading  people will not buy this truck. People who are getting into off-roading will probably start with a Jeep or a cheaper truck. I have no idea who this truck is for.
It's a truck with offroad capability rather than designed to be a beast off road. The airsuspension is there to manage the payload and the stuff you would tow.

">There's a reason the F-150 is the best selling truck,

yeah because it's cheaper than the others."
If you get shit stolen out of the bed of your truck at a stop light you need to realize you live in a fucking shithole and it's not the trucks fault.
"I’m talking about using it from the side at all, those angles are not helping"
"It’s not a truck if the bed is enclosed. It’s an SUV.

If you don’t need the space of a real bed, buy an SUV."
Sounds great
From a design standpoint modifying a Mazda is bad.
"I personally was thinking that this thing was going to try to be the default answer to everyone buying a full-sized truck every year, but I do not think that segment of the market is going to go for this. 

But, then again, I could be wrong. The only thing anyone is discussing is the looks, and that's because there isn't anything else to disagree with about it."
Just hold R or L while you turn
You understood my reply! You're getting smarter every minute. I'm proud of you!
"It means easily gumped up by splork. The tighter the tolerance the less dirt ingress it can take and trucks are dirty AF. I really hope they take a good hard look at other trucks and make something both futuristic but with more a mind for utility. I really wanted to see something with the cab over the front wheel, you don't need a nose now or a frunk, make this thing have a crazy big bed and still hold 6. I was thinking more AK-47 and less custom shotgun."
"No tie downs are no tie downs, they are big and visible. You wouldn't be able to miss one. There are possible 4 low in bed but that is a terrible place for them, if that's what they are they wouldn't be usable. That is not an assumption that is straight fact. 

I know a high rake windshield is hard to see out of, this is not new to any automobile. Again, not an assumption. 

I have used a cut away wheel, they suck. Not assumption, you can't let the wheel correct in your hand with the wheel sliding though life if it was generally circular, that's a well known fact in automobiles since about 1900. I'm not sure you know what an assumption is at this point. 

If they change it, then its different. Thanks for that, I was critiquing what I saw. This is you making the assumption they will fix it."
I just saw a billionaire give a product demo like a kid who just did his homework before walking into class. I think you might want to open up to the thought this wasn't as well thought out as you want to believe.
I'm watching the live stream feed of the product photo's I only see 2 things that might be tie downs and they are very low. Otherwise the bed is smooth.
"Call me wanker all you want, you're just knowing I'm right."
I made 9 points and you went to cup holders. Not one farmer or construction worker buys anything they have to remove their work gloves to operate. Especially in winter when they are getting in and out every 5 minutes. No amount of air and power will help that.
"I didn't mean the teased photo, I mean all the tweets Elon did over the past years describing how crazy it would look. It looks exactly as he teased over the years in his tweets."
"The roaster didn't, and neither did the semi"
Absolutely not. Still holding the stock for a very long time.
"Why no Tesla logo? Why no mirrors? Why fully refundable deposits? Elon, potentially the smartest engineer on this planet, didn’t test out the window demo a million times before a live demo? Nothing adds up. I believe the specs, but do not believe that this is THE design."
"The basic Autopilot is basically just adaptive cruise control and autosteer. It'll keep you in the lane and prevent you from hitting cars in front of you on the highway by matching their speed if they're slower than you.

Full Self-Driving includes things like Navigate on Autopilot, letting the car take you all the way from on-ramp to off-ramp without you needing to even change lanes manually. FSD also includes Smart Summon, and basically every other feature that Tesla releases on their way to you eventually not needing the steering wheel.

Part of the general confusion is that for a while Tesla didn't sell just ""Autopilot"", but Enhanced Autopilot which does get some of the FSD features like Smart Summon and NoA."
"It's alright dude. Being gay no longer carries the stigma it used to. Just choose a pretty car, no one will judge you for it."

"There's a guy that converted , I think, a Ford 150 to full electric. And built a trailer full of solar panels.... let me see if I find the a link...

Drawing? [It](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-electric-pickup-truck-livestream-elon-musk/) looks real enough to me.
how can it still be a prototype if they are offering it for pre order
"> just go to a construction site for 2 days and see how we use trucks.

Right? This was clearly designed at Elon's SpaceX desk and had zero link to the working world. Totally out of touch."
I think you missed my point dude...
"> Developing these gimmicks is such a waste of capital and the leash continues to shorten

That's my biggest frustration. This screams ""pet project"" and you have to wonder what they're not getting done on the Y while they fart around with these prototypes."
"They’d waste more capital jumping into mass producing a product they have no experience with. You’re missing the point. It’s a learning opportunity for the engineers. 


Do you think Tesla could’ve produced the model 3 successfully before producing the model S?"
"It honestly doesn't even have the price.  2wd and 250 mi for 39,000 and towing of 7,500? Thats something every single work truck model truck can do for 30,000.  You spend $70,000 and now you can buy a 3500 4wd that can tow 35,000 and can do it a hell of a lot longer with diesel.  You can buy a truck to tow 10,000 lbs, have 4wd, and it will only cost you 40,000 if you dont spring for the highest trim which will even then only put you around 60,000.

They made a truck for none truck people and its obvious that they didnt do their research. Bulletproof? Under 4 second 0-60?  No spare tire? Has anyone asked for that in a truck?"
"As a Model X owner in a small town . . . yeah. I am that guy with the car whose doors open like [this](http://siliconvalleyism.com/images/S02E07-car-doors.jpg).

I can't imagine what this would do."
"> Where do you put a 12' piece of lumber in a normal 6.5ft F-150?

On a universal rack that works on any truck.

To accomplish the same on this thing you're going to need a Tesla™ accessory for every little thing. 

I said it elsewhere but this is the El Camino of the future, not a pickup truck."
"It functions more like an El Camino than an F150 though. And it's billed as competition for the F150.

And I don't know if they noticed, but the El Camino has been dead and gone for a long time for a good reason . . ."
"F150 and Ram will still outsell this thing.  It's going to cause Tesla financial trouble, and I don't want that because the Models S, X, and 3 are good cars."
"I don't disagree and I don't mind giving credit to Tesla for being very original. This is just the entirely wrong product to flex those muscles on. Do that on a motorcycle, maybe. Or some other new idea that's outside of the box of other vehicle classes.

But a pickup truck? The definition of practicality in the market? Oh, Lord . . ."
And that person brings their own ghillie suit to laser tag
Ahh... the widely known objectively held reddit discourse... I rest my case in defeat of your arguments
I remember when Toyota was making Tacomas about half the size of current pickups. Those things are pure gold on the used truck market. The pretense that suburbanites need five ton trucks to haul their dirt bikes is bullshit.
Whether a truck is beautiful and classy or not is an opinion.
"(As a current investor) The future results are not being disputed. The current inflated price, and your advice to “buy now” is what im questioning.

There will be PLENTY of better buy opportunities than RIGHT NOW."
"I hope so.  I normally am all for futuristic designs, but this one is just too far out there.  I would be buying one if it was slightly more normal looking."
"Not sure what you're talking about. From the info I've seen the bed size is pretty standard. Also the capabilities of the truck are better than trucks in its same price range... And then it has functional features like access to a 240v power outlet and air compressor. Seats 6. Full ramp in the tailgate, automatic bed cover, etc. There may be some other trucks with these features, but to have them all in one truck at this price is amazing. You can hate the looks but it's really hard to hate how functional it is."
This thing is going to bomb crash and pedestrian testing. Even the DeLorean had urethane bumpers to comply.
I don’t think Lambo even safety tests cause volumes are so low but pretty sure their cars angles are at shin level and not torso level like this thing.
Everything is a truck by this definition then lol....
"The controversy will fuel the CYBRTRK's sales. This thing is cooler in the looks department than most supercars yet u can grab a mid-range model for 50k. This will upend the whole industry, and sell like fucking hotcakes."
I too like to wildly speculate everything Elon makes is going to be an instant hit and will sell like hotcakes
"Of course some are gonna love it. Thats what fanboying is.

You love it regardless. This company is 100% amazing and has zero negatives they are perfect right."
I don't think the hordes of rednecks in America are going to buy this truck.. he'll need to redesign for the target.

"Middle class average household income is $78,442"
"I think what class you are depends on where you live. 

Where I live 35k I’d pay check to pay check and living in a studio to make it by"

"I drive a ton and still need ice engine due to range anxiety. Chicago to Minneapolis or Chicago to Lexington Kentucky and things like that. 

I feel like this would be perfect for me. I don’t really need a truck but I would like a boat at some point.  

So for me I am spending $50 every 2-3 days in gas. The difference on monthly spend would be negligible for someone like me who drives 30k+ miles per year. 

I think that’s what’s gonna win converts here. Gas is $3 per gallon and driving 30k miles per year equals about $375 a month in fuel costs. The electric may cost $50 or so. So that extra $325 can go right into a payment. I used to drive 60k miles per year and that would allow for an extra $650 a month plus a $40 oil change every month could boost that up even higher. 

That’s the part most “truck guys” and middle working class people will consider when they look at overall spend."
"You can’t really call them trend setters if regular cars don’t end up looking like them, IMHO."
Have you heard of the Model S?
"If your friends don't give you shit, are they really your friends anyhow? Haha, half the fun would be the banter it causes."
"Those are good features, but there are no bumpers."
"Here's hoping the Tesla truck will separate the utilitarians from the posers then.

That said, I suddenly want one based on specs alone. I don't care that it looks weird... I wanna take this thing camping in the mountains. And I'm not a truck guy."

"NSWIB (Not Sure Why I Bother): 

objective opinion is an oxymoron

nothing to be sorry about, I don't take it that way at all  LOL 

disagreeing on subjective matters is a given and makes for more fun - imagine if not

i certainly didn't say it is objectively beautiful 

i did say it is objectively very well conceived from a design /materials point of view  

whether it has the effect of the current competition look dated or not is indeed an opinion

you are welcome to  disagree 

for NEW trucks to look dated is not the same as looking older - i suppose new trucks don't want to look dated, but that's another opinion of course. 

have i been congenially polite enough ?  i intended to - o/w my apologies ;D"
I honestly cannot tell what is sarcasm anymore.
You overestimate adults

"Fair enough. I was going off Edmunds. However, that is then $4k cheaper, and tows 4,000 pounds more."
$100 pre-order? I preordered too as a joke.
"""Design is cyclical so nothing can be out of date"" 

Design comes in cycles in a wave. This car is a total outlier. It's not a spearhead. It looks awkward and ungainly compared to nearly any contemporary automobile. Like a tribute the 1980s version of the future instead of the *modern* vision of the future like Tesla's cars have been in the past. 


If this is truly the way forward, why didn't Tesla style the roadster the same way? 

They styled this truck to be a novelty. Not to be beautiful."
"Have you ever used a truck? I load and unload from the sides all of the time. Slide a sheet of drywall 8' across another sheet and see how quickly it gets ruined. Grab a buddy and lift it off from the side and it doesn't scratch the sheet under it. With this truck you couldn't do that, yoh would even have to stand on the drywall to get near the cab end of the bed."
They also make all of their torque from zero RPM.
I think it has a quite nice bed.

"i really am not liking the design choice of tesla's first truck, the rivin r1t looks great but the front. I used to have a ford explorer back in the day it kinda reminds me of it. but really gotta see what companies do now that this is a thing, who knows. be interesting if/when ford and chervy get into the Electric truck game."

"You said you WOULD buy it. You did not say you are going to buy it. 

Do you need a safe space?"
"> I don't have that problem at all.

Yeah, but I'm hoping they sell more than 1 truck. 

Pickups are like 15% of the US auto market. So we need like half a million people with the same functional focus as you and I. I think a more conventional aesthetic would have given them a better shot at that. Not a better truck, but better adoption rates.  

You can get a legit Honda suitcase generator for like $1000."
Yeah it’s nice! Has a futuristic look but still looks like a truck.
The difference would be in low production homologation.. Which is limited at 1200 vehicles. Or limit the car to the US market.. Both strategies lead to a very limited business case.
"I wish we got to see the inside. 

I wonder what kinds of workstation functionality he will put inside. Ita going to be awesome for anyone who uses their truck as their office."
"If you think the design and aesthetic of this is more suited to be a work-truck than the rest of the trucks in the market today then I’d have to disagree with you. Again, I’m not talking about the specs. So good luck stacking things on the roof with these angles and also not nicking the wide windshield with a stone on a job site. Or what about mud over the cameras? There are trucks on the market that are more suited for this stuff, especially at the price point. This isn’t targeting the F150 demo. Someone that eyeballs a Jeep Gladiator would be more likely to get this than someone that would purchase an F150. That’s my opinion."
"Yeah, you’re right. It’s been a while. They retested it [here](https://youtu.be/r3aqHbD-O9E) 
And even with the bed cover, having just a mesh and no cover was better."
This was all according to the Wired article. I didn't even notice it didn't have side mirrors until I read that.
"Yes, thanks for the correction. 

The full self-driving definitely has my interest piqued. I'm not in the market for a new truck yet, but I will be in ~5 years.

If they tone the design back just a bit by then, and full self-driving is a realizable option, I'll definitely trade the towing capacity that is get in a traditional truck for a computer that drives me around."
"True, but more seats in this monstrosity. Plus likely more tech."
"Yeah, but you have to pay for gas. Electricity is way cheaper."
yea but an ice truck drinks gas like water. the gas savings on trucks are going to be a lot higher than for sedans.
cheers!
"I sure they will. Doesn’t mean it’s stylish, it’s all straight lines. Thing looks like a Pontiac Aztec."

Yes, they are closely matched. Contrary to popular belief electric powertrains are not rocket science. The hardest part is getting the battery cells affordably made to compete on price."
"For towing? Often. Camping, taking the boat, horse shows, etc. And towing means I can't just pull up too a supercharger. I haven't looked, but V3 chargers didn't have obvious long bays to drive through"
"The person I responded to said ""he has been saying about it for years including that he doesn’t care if people hate it"" so I referenced things he said as well.

The sun is more readily available than fuel. You’re out in the desert in an isolated base. You set up a solar array in the base. Have some Tesla battery packs as storage for electricity. Wow. All that fuel that was normally being moved can be replaced with weapons, food and water for troops.

"I've used my Model 3 in MN for a full winter so far, and it's by far my favorite winter car.  Charge it so it's ready and warm in the morning, turn on climate control a couple mins before getting to the car from anywhere, etc... no issues with anything ""sticking"" or breaking... some 30-40% or so range loss, but if you start warm and manage to it, there's still nearly 200 miles of range."

"It is actually very easy. We have a space habitat right now in testing that is inflatable. Pretty hard to not turn them into rock hard brittle shattering rubber in the temp they will experience. Also hard to have them break down instantly in the radiation environment. 

I don’t think you understand how space flight hardware is designed. You have a requirement and you design to just barely meet that. We are trying to literally shave grams out of spacecraft. Take milliwatts out of the SWaP. Flying this would be stupid. Not only would it fail, why would you do it?  It doesn’t meet the requirements."
If you have the room for it sure but i have to move stuff out of the way to give myself some room to play. I dont want to keep moving furniture out of the way and im not going to give VR its own room.
"I’m sure people have said far worse. Try not to be too sensitive about it. I think he’s right, had to check it wasn’t April."

If you watch the part where the roll up the vault and load the ATV you can see it’s all straight up and down. Does not take up vertical space
That's because they're the target market 🤣
"I'm not from a rural area, but I grew up in the Midwest and currently live in the DC burbs. There are so many rich suburban pickup drivers (that have no real need for one), that Tesla will have no trouble selling a ton of these. The rural market is not where Tesla needs to focus right now to succeed. But leading Ford to make an F-150 EV will trickle down to these people eventually."
This truck also has no room in southern truck culture at all. This feels to me it was more designed for white-collar workers in California.
"I’m just assuming, because how they stated it makes no sense."
Yea but they aren't quoting a 16 month delivery for the truck. So how in the world do you come up with they won't deliver this truck?
They need to sell far more.
"Oh god, oh god no. Make it stop."

"You know that's one of the main disadvantages of lidar, not cameras right? It doesn't work in rain or fog because lasers don't reach objects."
"The self driving problem is not solved by better object recognition but by better knowledge of what to do in more situations. 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors and a radar can already see and identify objects orders of magnitude better than humans can, but a car still won't know what to do in many situations. The only way to solve the knowledge gap is getting cars on the road. Today, lidar prevents that."
"Chess is a bad example here. As long as the computer is bound by chess rules to only make valid moves and every piece starts in the standard position, then it could figure out which pieces are which and thus play blindly."
8 cameras 12 ultrasonic sensors and a radar already allow for orders of magnitude better vision. This is not a vision problem.
"Exactly, once you can see and identify each piece there's little to no use for seeing them in higher resolution. Same thing for self driving cars. 8 cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors and 1 radar get you to a point where the computer can see and identify everything, but not necessarily know what to do in every possible scenario. Improving vision won't increase knowledge."
"And while you're at it, why don't you just redesign the whole car"
Exactly my thoughts.
"They made the clamps tighter after each drop. So it would would be more rigid, to help it not break. The truck window is not secured by clamps, or as rigid. Is my theory."
They should have tested it after installed on the truck. If they didn’t they are insane
This is the vehicle I drew when I was 7
"Rivian's 4 motors are distributed by 1 per wheel. Tesla vehicles have [2 wheels on 1 motor](https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/tesla-model-3-dual-motors.jpg?quality=82&strip=all)

I have no idea what they mean by ""tri"" motor though. Curious to what it ends up being.

But also Tesla puts out more power than Rivian's vehicles due to having a much stronger motor. 4 motors will give better traction, but the way the truck looks like it handles suspension, it will grant a ton of control."
Lol I’ve done the math.  Ford sells more F-150’s in a month than Tesla has sold total vehicles since 2012.
Nope I’m big into the outdoors but don’t have the car for it right now. This would be for rock climbing and camping and biking and snowboarding and off roading

Isn't side window glass shattering a safety feature though? What is the benefit of this glass other than presumably not being able to break it in the event you need to get out of the car quickly when the door won't open?

The pendulum test doesn't apply here because we're not talking about purely gravity. What we need to account for is the force with which Franz threw the ball. If the collision was perfectly elastic then it would be as if Franz had launched the ball in the opposite direction with the force of his original throw
"> It doesn't matter what bullet proof glass tests look like.

Of course it does, that was the whole point of the glass thing. The glass cracks but does not completely shatter."
Unlikely a rollover will meet all the conditions above. You need to have multiple very strong impacts for *all* doors to not be opening but somehow those impacts didn't bend the fame enough for the windows to just fall off. Have a look at [Google Image Search](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&biw=1460&bih=858&tbm=isch&sxsrf=ACYBGNQhCVJsae_JwQQ3L3PeiSogMopT1A%3A1574400348414&sa=1&ei=XHHXXY71GInjUp2ytbAL&q=rollover+doors+open+crash&oq=rollover+doors+open+crash&gs_l=img.3...1837.2518..2734...0.0..0.0.0.......0....1..gws-wiz-img.5dTclBGYXSs&ved=0ahUKEwiOk4Gsiv3lAhWJsRQKHR1ZDbYQ4dUDCAY&uact=5#imgrc=oyamAhWGJtg3eM:) to see that in most cases the doors can open.
"Eh, there’s a pretty big overlap between truck owners and dirtbike owners. 

That was my sole reason for owning a truck. I’d have bought a Ute if they were available in North America."
Most truck owners don’t NEED a bed. They certainly don’t NEED a staircase built into the tailgate.
There are a lot of urban contractors as well that would benefit from them.
"For sure I’m just saying there aren’t enough batteries to make 500,000 trucks. The number of trucks sold in the US is just staggering"
Plus the truck market is the largest US auto market. They could've probably outsold the model 3 domestically if they designed this to look a little more traditional. The specs blow any traditional truck out of the water but also very few truck consumers would want that door stop on wheels sitting in their driveway for fear of being the laughingstock of the neighborhood (and fellow truck drivers). It's just sad because this would be a game changer for Tesla's market share if they would've designed it to appeal to the truck market.

"Not really, there is inventory available, if you want something off the wall (there aren’t tons of options) you do basically get a custom one."
It didn't shatter into tiny pieces - it remained one piece because it's [laminated safety glass.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR4ZI_M5N7Q) That's why the ball bounced off instead of going straight through.
"They have over a year to finalise it still. If they handled the presentation in a different way like ""we are showing an early iteration of our futuristic truck concept"" it would have been fine."
Where did you see no air bags or crumple zones? I can't find that anywhere and it's hard to believe they would create a car that didn't have the most basic safety feature in a car.

I like it"
That’s the problem. Most truck owners don’t need a truck.
"People that need a truck will typically can't afford to buy two vehicles JUST to have something else for non truck stuff. 

Even for people that absolutely need a truck, it still ends up being their daily driver. Nobody wants their daily driver to look like someone decided to make an even uglier Pontiac Aztek."
"One problem is this truck doesn't have that much storage in the rear. They need to make an extended version as this wouldn't fit all my tools.

So the F150 stays."
"While true, it's not just specs but overall utility.  The bed design on this just doesn't work as a truck bed, you can't throw stuff in the bed easily over the sides, you also can't throw a utility rack on it.  Additionally the bed is super short.  So even in an argument of function over form, it doesn't quite work."

"Bicycle parts have been standardized for a long time, which is partly why it's easy to fix. Every bike uses one of two or three options for all the parts, which everyone that works in bikes knows how to fix all of them. Electric skateboard is relatively new, so the parts are not standard or well understood. 

I think that's a good comparison to current trucks vs Tesla truck."
"[This is a truck](https://i.imgur.com/9XbEJmG.jpg) from FIAT sold in Brazil and I think Tesla should do something close to it, as it looks like a fucking truck and it has a futuristic vibe to it. Of course it shouldn't be like this because it is from other manufacturer, but it should have these vibes!"
Thats my point. How do you put a roof rack on this without extensive modifying
Lol I rest my case
Let’s be honest it is completely piss ugly and it probably will not sell
"I would imagine so. It is like a deloran and a hummer. 
Here is a video posted below of the rear view mirror
https://youtu.be/WFTdDLiLYgk?t=1107"
"Yeah, he basically made this because he wanted one, and they can use it for the Mars mission. If other people want one, cool, he’ll sell it."
Shpanks!
I live in Texas and have a bass boat I pull with my F-150 and have been avidly awaiting a Tesla pickup truck.  I have at least 3 buddies who are in the same situation eager to buy an electric truck.  I’m so profoundly disappointed by the design of this truck... the specs and price are fantastic but there’s no fucking way I’m putting this fugly thing in my garage or would be seen in public driving it.
"Looking at it as an American-made pickup with specs that blow everyone else out of the water and is also cheaper to run, I think they would've had a good shot. There's certainly a demographic that would never buy one, but a lot of pickups end up as work vehicles for the kind of small business owners that might actually go for it. Not if it looks like that, though."
"F-150 Driver Pacific Northwest, I am looking to go electric at some point in the future, but this isn't going to do it. 

Rivian or E-F150 for sure. I want a truck, that looks like a truck."
"I was a fan of the Countach.

Urus looks like an Audi. Not a Lamborghini.

CyberTruck looks like a Lamborghini."
If only they had had one of those windows on stage...
"If they were smart, they would've saved that demo for the end, and would've shown a video of throwing the ball at a normal window first. If the window took it without a scratch (which was clearly the plan), then they look *really* good. If the window gets smashed but doesn't shatter, it's still awkward but at least it's a better result than the normal window. Without any comparison, and having to finish the second half of the presentation in front of two broken windows, it just looks bad and exceptionally awkward, even by Elon's standards."
"Yes, but the average viewer doesn't know that. And it's painfully obvious that Elon thought the glass would remain intact. Unfortunately his ""transparent metal"" just shattered into a million pieces, and so did his presentation."
"Yeah, this is a pretty bad downfall. 

Some production pickups have this issue as well. I think a Chevy Avalanche."
"I can’t say much about hauling. We mainly use trucks to move man power, tools and material around the city.  Fuel must be around $5k a month. Reduce that down $1k in electricity a month."
I cannot argue with any of those points. The specs alone get the job done.
I meant I misunderstood their question.
"If it's meant to be bulletproof...I don't know if that's possible. It will have reinforcement between panes and typically that reinforcement is a lot more ductile than glass which wouldn't help with the escaping part. It would be like trying to break out through the windshield, possible but more difficult and more dangerous."
Thank you!
Then they don’t mean for this to compete with consumer trucks
Do itttt! Be blessed by the CyberOwl ✨🦉 ✨
That doesn’t make it true
"Dude. Sick burn got me there. 

Because the side of the bed angles out like a triangle. You can’t get anything out without crawling through the back. To be practical as a truck you should be able to access the bed from the side. 

I swear Elon could drive out an EV Oscar Meyer Weiner mobile and you dipshits would be slurping it up."
"Lol you may be right on the Elon ""just do it"" design spec.

I wouldn't be surprised if there was a more conventional truck offered eventually, but I would be surprised if they replace this one with it."
"Look at the front. It is a lot less boxy than most of the rest of the vehicle. I don’t think it will be any worse for a pedestrian than getting hit by a sports car, for example.

Can’t help the pedestrian if they run into the back or fall on it from the top though."
welp that solves that.   no pickup trucks are use for blue collar work at all anywhere.   its all just potted plants and full length mirror work.
"You’re right, I was wrong. The price is listed at $69,900. Please excuse my horrible mistake."
Excellent point....!
"I think everyone says reliability is #1, but then you show them the looks of the reliable one and suddenly they say “nah, fuck it, it’s probably good for the economy to support my local mechanic”.

I bought a Ford because I thought it was the nicest looking truck. Absolute catastrophe in regards of reliability.

Did the same shit with a BMW too a few years previously. 

It took two very expensive and inconvenient lessons, but I’ve since learned to love whatever Toyota/Lexus makes."
"I’m not a diehard Tesla fan. I canceled my model S order because I found another vehicle more suited to my lifestyle. This truck though could definitely work for it. I don’t mind the looks. I don’t love it, but I also don’t hate it. It just looks too retro-futuristic to actually look modern, but I don’t care. Imagine an Airstream behind it, both polished."
"I see your point, but I could also respond ‘why not, since it doesn’t affect function’ BUT I really do see where you’re coming from."
"Yeah that’s fair. But I think people will come around once they start seeing it on the road. I think it will be a huge success, especially at this price point. Let’s wait and see!"
"The lack of mirrors is a big deal, and not in a good way."
"Well i like that Tesla is making a truck, i just wish it had more of the standard truck practicality as well as the usual Tesla gadgets."
"Yes, I misspoke dude, time to get off your high horse."
Yet the average truck has an a 5.5 ft or 6.5 ft bed...
Uh no.  Drywall is purchased in 4x8 sheets.  No contractor is going to buy this.
Its not a full size bed.  That is part of the problem.  Also can't tow higher end trailers like 5th wheels with this because of the bed design.
I thought it was closer to the GM twins than that.
It's essentially a model S with an extra motor and more batteries under the whole thing price was definitely a thing and production speed which has always been an issue for Tesla. They can probably speed it up much more of they don't need to stamp curvy bodies or paint them.
I'm ngl I kinda love it but I get why so many people hate it

"Yes.  It was.

I have a RWD LR because it was the first car that was available.  I was very much expecting the P3D to be the first car available, because that's how Tesla had always done it in the past.  

But with the 3, they were worried about having enough motors, so they did the single motor cars first.

And it bums me out."
"The purpose of truck is utility, with a few easy mods any current truck can have those features.  The problem is that this doesnt work well as a light truck either, its far too big.  As a dude who has parked his F-150 in the city,  good luck on the street let alone a garage.  It seems like Tesla is trying to solve a problem that doesnt exist, and wrapping it in a Bladerunner fan boys wet dream.  All Ford had to do was stick the F-Series trucks on an electric platform and theyve won.  I really hate that im saying this because i was genuinly excited for this launch.  After today I think my next truck will be the electic Ranger/F-150."
[here you go](https://youtu.be/SwvDOdBHYBw)
I'm watching it on my iPad split with Reddit on the side but yeah would be nicer on the tv.
"Haha he sure did. I was getting that number before he announced that from this [article.](https://insideevs.com/news/383886/tesla-cybertruck-reservation-count) $14,600,000 is still pretty nice confirmation. I don't know how much they put into R&D, but that's some good scratch right there. Then we have his tweet itself:

""146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri & 17% single motor""

Some quick (actually probably spending much more time than I should, lol) maths, that's...

42% Dual Motor — 61,320 x $49,900 = $3,059,868,000

41% Tri Motor — 59,860 x $69,900 = $4,184,214,000

17% Single Motor — 24,820 x $39,900 = $990,318,000

Total: $8,234,400,000

Minus $14,600,000 that they already have from it at that's another $8,219,800,000 more to look forward to once they fulfill those orders. Not counting extras like FSD, CyberATV, some color that's going to look sick behind a paywall, [special MK-1 steel edition](https://twitter.com/Erdayastronaut/status/1198701437930180609), and whatever else they come up with between now and delivery.

Pre-reply but post already doing the math edit, he also just [confirmed 200k](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198788116372344832)"
"The one unforgivable problem with the ridgeline is that the spare tire is accessed from the top of the bed, so if you have a load that isn’t easily removed (I.e. gravel) and get a flat you’re hosed."
"That seems pretty darn inconvenient, lol."
"Good point. Remember when stock trucks were a lot shorter? That said, yes I've lifted heavy things over the bed rails of a traditional pickup. That would be impossible on the cyber truck."
why wouldn't that work? because of the non flat bed?  I am sure it will clear.
"I'm a Millennial but if using a truck as a truck instead of an open-air SUV makes me a Boomer, so be it. I guess if you can afford a CyberTruck, you can probably afford to pay people to do actual work for you too so maybe you don't need the true utility anyhow."
"Give it up dude. This is the dumbest thing any truck owner has ever seen in their life. Its a beefy ass suburu/ridgeline hybrid from a playstation 1 game. No real man is going to drive this thing. How do you put a ladder rack on that thing?

edit: No one would give a damn if he didn't call it a truck. Its not a truck. its a beefy ass cross over."
"> hackernews

so you took a couple of top comments from hackernews and now assume that this thing is going to take over the world? a truck is literally meant to be a workers vehicle. not some silly video game ""cyberpunk"" electric tank ya dense cabbage. go get you one though Marty. lolol

edit: lmfao, why dont you read more than just the top comments in hackernews. people are shittin all over this thing. but im sure you are busy looking at dan belzerian ignite girls :)"
"Here's another comment for ya that summarizes this unveil: 

Holy fucking polygon on wheels. Let's be honest Elon will never sell meaningful volume on this truck.

Ford and GM slept fucking good last night after seeing this disaster.

The Top reasons people buy trucks

They fucking hunt, do you think a mother fucker dressed in Carhartt would drive this

They do shit like mudding and driving on dirt roads, Elon stop it

They need to haul tools and shit for work, nobody and I mean nobody is pulling up on a job site with this fucking thing.

They pull campers and trailers, you think the lame ass dude pulling a camper arrives at Yogi Bear Park with the family in the Cyber punk truck

They have a small dick, these fucks want something more flashy, women need to know they have money, a 40k garbage can on wheels won't cut it.

I showed this truck to my test group of Beckys they thought it was movie prop. I told one of them, imagine we are on a date and the truck breaks down on the way home, lucky for us I got an ATV charging in the back and I can give you a ride home still. She left me on ""unread""

Overall this truck fucks.

The only use I can think of for this truck is for local shoot outs, the homies can use the flat bed top as a shield. Sadly the windows don't catch bullets right now so put the new guys in the front."
I can't drill into metal and mount things because it's all one piece?  Can you explain that a little?
"You can't bolt things to the interior of the bed, for example? Sure you can. What are you even saying."
"Obviously it's not a love at first sight design, but I think more people will like it over time. We'll see."
[deleted]
I detest that word. My Corvair has had a trunk under its hood since it was built new in 1966 and the decklid covers the engine.
"Maybe there is some sort of modular skid type platform they will introduce. Tesla sells a few different ones, some that you can kit our by yourself or others that include a extra batteries and fold out solar panels. Make some way it rolls up and down that ramp."
">Fiat Multipla

You'll need to wait and see it for yourself in person or wait for the videos."
Yeah I think this is definatly made as a toy hauler rather than a work truck for sure. I would be cursing that box(tray) design all day.
"Sure, but look at this thing? Is it designed to say ""I am the most bad ass truck there is?"" Or ""That'll do""?"
The Raptor comparison is spot on.
"It’s not better than a raptor or a f250, so it really begs the question who it’s for."
"I keep trying to reply, but the Reddit’s keeps crashing. 

Basically you can’t fuck with the slide for both the ramp and the cover, so the bed lining would get in the way 

And cold rolled steel isn’t that impressive. Anything too hard is also brittle and anything too flexible won’t maintain shape."
As a truck it’s impractical yeah. And it says truck right there
"You overestimate the steel. Plus, bedliners also provide good anti-slip surfaces."
"That’s very nice, but it says truck on the tin and I’ll judge it as a truck."
Collecting vehicles is different than driving them
"A steel box with moving parts, like slides and ramps. The Rhino would fuck em up"
"There really just isnt much crushable structure in any car's sides.  You shoulder is only a few inches from the door and the door is only a few inches thick.  I think they mostly rely on the fact that if you get tboned, the other car crumples.  Its pretty hard to hit something rigid with the side of your car but when it does happen its bad.  See any car sliding into a tree and wrapping around it."
"If the ingredients in your salad have no relation to each other, then you should really try a different salad. 

What you did is mashed together a bunch of technologies that remain in their market infancy. 

For example: 3D Printing and Renwable energy have been around for decades and while rapidly advancing still fail to achieve scale. 

Societal wide space travel? For which society?

 I hope the brain impants come out soon, because it looks like yours is broken. 

“We are living in an age dominated by the prevalence of the fruits of the scientific method”

You are just because you shoehorning every multisyllabic word you could muster. 

Also consider the fact we also elected a president who vehemently denies global warming and thinks we can shoot nukes to stop violent weather systems. 

Enjoy the fantasy world you’re conjuring up, because it’s about as real as the Tesla that you can’t afford."
"I have run into the problem with antique furniture (workbench, armoire, hutch) and with plasterboard. Both cannot be propped because they are too fragile (I’ve cracked and ruined plasterboard trying that) and both can be difficult to secure without damaging them. I do think the cybertruck bed is just large enough for antique armoires though. 
But yeah your air compressor is bigger than mine so I guess I lose that dick measuring contest."
...8 foot beds are a pretty standard ask for anyone that actually uses the specs this thing performs for. You know how many people will wish it was long enough to hold their snowmobile in it like the ATV?
You would be surprised how many miles they drive each day driving around and in some cities the cars are used for multiple shifts.
It would be easier to modify one of those than the Cybertruck.
"Hmm, I'm not sure I'm getting what you are saying. How will it not be able to use after market equipment whereas normal trucks can? Do these companies detach the entire bed of the trucks you are talking about (like a small Tesla Semi)? Also, I went back to its page on their website and looking at photos... it looks like that rear bed cover is retractable. So it can completely disappear into the truck and you have a more standard truck layout than a hummer for the back."
Idk man you're getting into some conspiracy levels of detail.
Not to mention the rubber coated mallet
It's not a concern until it happens. What kind of logic is that?
"It took a while, didn’t show up immediately."
"Cool, thank you"
[deleted]
"This thread is full of city folk who have no idea how their energy, food, manufactured goods get to them. 

No truck comes with a cover, they are typically a Cap-It brand or other. And once it goes on your back, you almost NEVER take it off. 

Fuck i laughed with you man. This is nuts"
Probably rather get my skull smashed than drive around in something that looks like that to be honest.
All cars have safety glass now don’t think you have to worry about rocks crushing your skull.
"Depends on the geological makeup of the rock, the speed traveled, the size, etc..."
"I think you're missing his point, elegance and sophistication are also subjective"
"Sorry, I love it."
"something like a hilux but electric

it can tow it has a tray that doesn't have the stupid angle things like this and you can fit bikes etc on the back

that's most people use as work vehicles for trades driving from site to site"
"Sleeping bed, not a truck bed. Although the 6.5ft truck bed is tiny. 

But yeah, the f150 is shit as well. A luxury truck for all the family loses out on cargo space, fuel economy, and practicality. My uncle got one for work and despises it for that reason."
"But it really is form following function. 

- Better fuel economy will save people hundreds / month. 
- Air suspension makes it better to drive than jacked up trucks. 
- 0-60 times of a sports car
- 220V and a compressor is a big deal for a lot of contractors / builders / workers. 

Perhaps they could have made it with more traditional styling, and maybe they'll make one that's more normal looking, but I like the fact that they worked backwards from pain points and were brave enough to make something strange."
"The beater trucks are what this should be trying to replace. Why on Earth would you not target the actual customer base for trucks? The people that just want looks would either buy an ev truck or buy an ev car, but the people that need an ev truck more than likely won’t buy this. This design seems to have no input from actually truck users."
"After watching the presentation, and other videos about it that gathered further info, I can see what they’re trying to do, and I can buy the design except for the cab. I’m still having trouble understanding that cab design that is basically a triangle that slopes into the bed. The whole thing just feels like they understood what made a good truck, but have never worked with a truck before. Like, where’s the toolbox going to go?"
If we can change Sonic we can change the world
Yes I finally got it! Thanks :)
And makes it risky as fuck to change lanes
"Uhh what? Every single time someone is talking about a car being safe. They are talking about how safe the car is *in the event of a collision*. They aren't talking about the risk of the drivers to get into a collision. That is a completely separate metric and not up to the manufacturer at all, except in the provision of active collision avoidance systems (which are now quite good). 

I am disagreeing that breakable side windows are a *basic and vital* safety regulation. You wouldn't be able to break regular automotive glad with your bare hands in an emergency anyways, and the *vast* majority of people do not carry a belt cutter/window spike tool. 

This isn't even the first car that has laminated side windows. Unbreakable side windows are *safer* than breakable ones in most collision scenarios as they reduce the risk of ejection. One in three 2018 MY vehicles have laminated side glass."
"Does your SUV *also* have a 6.5 foot bed?   
With this thing you can put a toolbox up front and leave it there and load the bed with lumber or other supplies."
"I drive a 25 year old Dakota and use it all the time. I can't  think of anything I'd put in the 6.5 foot box small enough that I couldn't reach from outside of the rear third of the bed that I wouldn't just put in a trunk if it had one.  
My toolboxs and a full size spare are there now. The Dakota is an extended cab so my backpack and lunch go behind the seat. My truck has easier access from the side at the front if the box than any late model truck does, even Ford's new Ranger is taller than mine is, and I can't really think of any reason I'd need what access I have if I could just open the hood and put it in there."
"You're in luck. The point of this car is to attract attention, gauge interest and get feedback. The styling will likely stay similarly inspired, but will be toned down a bit. It's pretty likely our boy Elon will listen to the people about the bed, he uses reddit."
"Well, it’s not like this was a double-blind study or anything, but I definitely think less of the company now. It’s not just the fact it looks like a driving triangle, it’s stupid on many other levels. Tell me, what happens when it’s in an accident? Yes, it’s a tough exterior metal but it will be damaged and how do you replace a part? Cut it out and weld a new one in? The steel finish will never match.
It also looks quite a bit larger than a traditional truck, that’ll be fun in parking lots. I just can’t find any reason to want this thing, other than maybe for collecting or something."
"> Surely cameras can be accepted as mirrors.

No, they can't. The feds are developing standards for those, but that's still a couple of years off before approval. Side mirrors are mandatory, period.



>As for bumpers, I don't think anyone here knows what a bumper has to look like or be like legally, to be accepted as such.

Huh? Bumper standards don't leave much room for creativity. For starters, they need to protrude and actually *be* bumpers."
"Well, best to say that he probably has some crazy plan we all dont see yet.  Maybe make a toy hauler he can charge more for, work out the bugs, then make a work truck based on the same chassis."
Maybe it will grow on you :) They won’t hit the road until 2022/2023 so there’s plenty of time. Plus Elon said if enough people hate the Cybertruck they’ll think about making a more normal looking one.
"Relax. It's not going to be their design language going forward, it's only for the Cybertruck and other Cybertruck-like models. They still have the Model Y, Semi, and Roadster 2 upcoming and none of them use this design or exoskeleton, it's only the Cybertruck right now.

And the functional specs look promising, including range, hauling capacity, price, etc. Tesla is not known for failure, I think even if it's not a huge success Tesla will still manage this one decently, and even if there are mistakes (like with the glass) they are quick learners and will improve things going forward."
"The sx3y do not look like the orig roadster.  The new roadster is a bit bland too for a $250k car.


I hope tesla knows that the tech will sell itself and they don't have to make vanilla designs.  A wedge roadster that does 0-60 in 1.9s will sell.  The cybertruck is half the price of a vanilla rivian.  Guess which will sell more."
"It's one of the most popular market segments in North America. To be clear, I'm not in the market for a truck. I love converting my construction customers to Tesla. They few I've already spoken with today laughed in my face about this truck. 

You're correct, Tesla knows cars. What Tesla clearly doesn't know is trucks, and they don't know construction contractors."
"Yes, I agree. The same way the Aztec was popular. My opinion isn't fact, it's just based on facts. Yours is simply baseless speculation. Good looking out."
I'm not a contractor. I've already discussed this with a few customers this AM. Ford it is. A huge miss for Tesla.
Haha I saw that. Sad attempt at stealing the spotlight. Just like Ford's tweet the day of the Model Y reveal. Kind of embarrassing that massive auto companies are resorting to that
Haha yep. And almost go time!
"And some tonneau covers roll up, not needing to be removed. Tesla is trying to enter the truck market but not catering to the truck buyers. A truck has a purpose, and this, in my opinion does not meet that purpose. This is just another SUV with the option to haul bigger items. Call it that, not a truck"
[deleted]
"Lmfao the Triton is smaller in every dimension than the *smallest* variant of the F150. 
And the Tesla is far longer than that."
"It's the price for lack of return, and the weird design. No trailer hitch that I've seen. No roof rack, ""armor glass"", raising and lowering suspension is a nothing feature."
"I think toast is a gross overstatement. Modern cars are designed to pass safety tests that are against immovable objects, not cars, and keep the passengers safe. Crumble zones dissipate the energy around the passenger instead of through them. This is an advantage no matter what the vehicle strikes."
"I'm not sure that matters, Tesla's dual motor puts out much more power and the adaptive suspension should make up for the lack of 4 motor control."
"Well, that's just the thing. This is new they are doing new things, and Tesla has never built a truck before. 

I personally don't find that mechanism looks very dependable. But we'll see I guess."
"There is still some importance to resale value when you buy a vehicle. If the truck is so ugly that nobody will buy it from you, you're forced to drive it forever.

Also, believe it or not but image is important in the small ranching sector. Customers eat up the cowboy shit, the hats and boots and denim. They want their meat raised on the open prairies in traditional style. Show up to deliver meat in this truck and they would be weirded out.

I would definitely buy one of these as a used truck if the price was right. I won't be signing up to pre-order one, though."
It’s a stretch man. I’m gonna guess we don’t see electric vehicles in battle for at least 20 years.
"Oh well, I'm up 50%. Take the good with the bad."
"> yeah because it's cheaper than the others.

You're saying that people are buying F-150s for the lower price, even though they need a higher spec vehicle?"
"The entire truck can lower itself on its suspension big time, so it may not be as big of an issue as you think."
Supposedly the sides are removable
Enjoy that pinewood derby car.
Adorable.
I think the design went more for aerodynamics to get more range. More upright design = more wind resistance.
Exactly? None of the renders from any source looked like this. Which is why most have shared a polarized reaction here.
"You aren’t an investor in the company clearly. 

Why no logo? They get more minimalist with their designs each time. The model 3 has 2 logos and doesn’t say Tesla on the outside anywhere except on the brake calipers. This ridiculously flawed reasoning lmao. 

Fully refundable deposit? That’s the same way the Model 3 was for the full 2 years before you placed your order for the spec. It’s $100 omg and it’s refundable. 

Sorry you should go splash yourself with cold water it seems your hate for the exterior of the vehicle has warped your reasoning skills. 

Or you’re concern trolling one of the two"
This is by far the best explanation thank you!
ok boomer
"First of all I never said I didn't like it. What I said is that you dumbass gatekeeping comment about ""if you don't like its looks you're not a real truck guy"" was the stupidest thing I've read all morning and Ive been reading Trumps tweets. I like the look of the truck, but that doesn't change the fact that you're a complete moron with stupid opinions. But all that can be summed up with a simple statement.

Ok Boomer"
"Wow. It really looked like the cad drawings I had seen.  
If you zoom in, the corner is capped by the tailgate, although I doubt it will reach production that sharp."
* EVERY * Tesla model was a prototype when they started offering pre-orders.
"They really just are not in a financial position to be toying around with capital intensive toy projects when you were almost going bankrupt last year. 

You’d think all their energy would be focused on driving down costs on the model 3 and getting the Y out the door but instead we are making a truck from Halo and an ATV that they probably will never sell."
"If this doesn’t come out until early 2022 then when does the real truck come?

Do you think Ford, GM and others won’t figure a viable solution to meet what their market wants by 2024?"
"I still feel like a fucking celebrity when I step into an X; I love the gullwing doors...

But people will never accept this."
So it needs a special rack. Is spending a couple hundred on that not worth all that gas savings?
"Okay, but the El Camino couldn't tow 14k lbs, with a 3k payload capacity, a 0-60 of 2.9s, all electric with a range of 500+ miles, an air suspension with a higher ground clearance than a F-150, a towgate that acted as a ramp, and come with an automatic bed cover that goes down like a garage door..

Look I get your points about the looks, but if you take out your personal opinion about looks, you'll see that this can do everything a F-150 can but better EXCEPT unloading from the side of the truck. That is literally it. 

So whether you don't want to buy because the looks, is 100% up to you and everyone else. I'm not even saying I like the look. I think the side profile is pretty terrible. Though i think that front angle profile actuallly looks pretty good. But this absolutely can function like every other 6.5ft bed F-150..."
"Don't know how much the F150 sells specifically (does Ford even break down their sales by type of F-series model?) but the F-series has like over a million sales per year. 

Obviously Ford/Ram will outsell this. Tesla won't even be able to produce enough to even come close to outselling them. So That's not the argument literally anyone is making. Like the Model 3 doesn't sell as much as a Camry. Yet it's revenue is better, and it's killing the competitors (particularly BMW) higher revenue models.

But I don't see how this is going to cause Tesla financial trouble. Pickup Trucks literally have the best profitability in the market. And if they can make the Model 3 profitable, they can make this profitable. Especially when you consider the fact this vehicles literally won't even be painted. This removes the biggest problem they've had with manufacturing at Freemont, and also removes the $200M+ cost of actually building the paint shop at Giga1 (if that's where this'll be produced). Secondly this uses Stainless steel, and pretty much is nothing but flat edges. This will not be something incredibly difficult/costly to manufacture  or even expand Giga1 for..."
I feel personally attacked rn.
"It looks how it looks. The rest is semantics. 

It's not classy and sexy like his other cars. It's weird sci-fi looking, which has a certain appeal, but not to people buying trucks. 

Who is this for? It's not for people buying trucks that won't something that's also classy and tasteful, and high end looking rather than something rugged. 

I just don't see the demographic. 

You can call that an opinion if you want to, Imran, it is, but this will not be successful, and I'm right about that."
"As an investor, I don't see Tesla tanking over the truck. Personally, I hate it but it seems there are some that like this design so that is good for Tesla. What I am saying is if you are still buying stock in Tesla don't stop now."
Or the fact this tows and has a bed?
"Maybe because everything he has made so far from hats to $250,000 cars and semis have sold like hotcakes."
"I disagree, I love the truck, I don’t care much about the other cars they make."
"Yes, and it's still a truck.  I think I would look silly getting out of a pickup truck in a suit.  Motor homes are stacked full of luxury, but I'm not going to drive it to work."
"a roof rack is an addition to the roof of a car that on can affix additional gear to. A roof rack is a rack on top of the car that facilitates the option to fasten large boxes or even bicycles. One can add more carrying capacity to the car by affixing large boxes or other specialized racks on the roof. So that one can carry just about anything.   
The option for a roof rack is important for trucks, because it is an advantage in the market, relative to not having the option at all.   
You can learn more about roof racks by following this link:[https://www.google.com/search?q=truck+roof+racks&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiN7dmjgP7lAhVOx4sKHdstDEEQ\_AUIDCgA&biw=1365&bih=654&dpr=2.81](https://www.google.com/search?q=truck+roof+racks&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiN7dmjgP7lAhVOx4sKHdstDEEQ_AUIDCgA&biw=1365&bih=654&dpr=2.81)"
"Yes, I think you're right.   
The design seems to be extremely practical in terms of strength and durability.  
The question becomes then:   
Will a less practical, but more aesthetic design help sales?  
This is a subjective question, of course.  


I think it may, in this case, be helpful to re-evaluate the extreme practical design in aid of making the truck more appealing to the buyers.  
The design, after all, have been criticized for being a bit too unique. I am looking forward to your reply. <3"
"No you don’t. Depends on you need. If you drive 10k miles a year, sure. But if you drive more than 30k miles a year as most contractors and working class people do then the $325-$650 a month in fuel savings would pay for a big chunk and may make the monthly expenses drop below the cost of a normal truck."
I make more than 19/hr but less than 21 (can't remember exactly). I'm definitely lower middle class.
"Model S was much more conventional compared to the truck. Even with the fact that a front grille was not needed, they did include curvature to resemble an ordinary car.

Don't get me wrong, the truck doesn't have to look conventional, but baby steps are needed to have everyone accept the truck's design as a trendsetter. It really looks undone."

Just not as much as the other car. It would still crumple."
Thank you for the very constructive argument. I now see clearly why my point was wrong. I wish more people were helpful like you. Reddit needs more conversations like this.

">	Someone That eyeballs a Jeep Gladiator...

You’re exactly correct on that. I’m looking for either a truck or a Tesla about 2-3 years from now, and had been looking at a Gladiator, especially if/when it gets the Diesel engine. Over the day so far, the Cybertruck has grown on me, and I’ve put my $100 down for a reservation."
"True, but that makes it more of a 'luxury' truck than competition for a work truck."
"Realistically if someone is dropping 40K+ on a car, fuel prices are really not a big chunk of the pie.  To make up 10K in price difference it would take something like 8 years when compared to the 25 mpg truck if it drove 16,000 miles a year.  


Convenience of charging at home and not having to go to a gas station sure."
F150 is rated at 22 to 28 mpg.
"Because that's all he knows what to say. He hasn't used an actual truck a single day of his life, so all he thinks that matters is power and 0-60. I guarantee you that most people buying this trash are tesla fans and not people who will actually use it like it's intended to"

"From an individual standpoint, it's not that much money. From a company standpoint, it's not that much money. If 300k people pre-order this car, that's only $30 million, which is pennies. Most companies can get a term loan for close to a billion dollars with an extremely low interest rate."

Just curious how you think it would work without a compressor?
"Depends on how cold you're talking. My first winter with the Model 3 I didn't have the 220VAC charger installed yet at home (I got the car December 2018) and that's when I had the issues I mentioned. This winter I have the 220VAC charger so I pre-condition the car every morning. We'll see how it handles now, but pre-conditioning the vehicle is a MUST before you drive it in the cold. If you forget to pre-condition for at least 30 min before going out in negative temps, forget it. Just be 30 minutes late to wherever you're going."

"I was making a joke about filling the tires with air. And yes I know about the BEAM space habitat on the ISS. Are we talking in a vacuum? Or on Mars. 

Are you saying flying this to mars is dumb? Or turning the truck into a rocket itself? Remember SpaceX is the same company that launched a sports car into space on the most powerful rocket in the world right now by a factor of 2. 

Also remember Elon is the same guy building an entire orbital class rocket out of the same exact 301 stainless steel as the cybertruck on a beach in Texas. 

Don’t make the cabin of the truck pressurized. Make the people in the truck pressurized via space suits. I’m not saying this exact truck we saw tonight is ready for takeoff. I’m saying the design, in general would be applicable on mars as a workhorse, tuned for space."
Half Life Alyx is confirmed to work in seated VR too.  So you don't need any space at all.

I guess I'm missing your point. Tesla controls 80% of the US EV market. The Y should be a hit as well. Not seeing repeated failure there. The X is an $80-120k vehicle. It's target market is small.

"OTOH, that's *also* the main disadvantage of human eyes in those conditions. We're already used to being inconvenienced by rain and fog by needing to drive more slowly, taking longer to stop, etc. 

If a LIDAR system worked great in clear conditions but just didn't operate during rain or fog, meaning that the car had to be driven manually then, it could still be appealing to people in general. Sure, maybe that's a weakness of the technology. But having a weakness doesn't make something worthless automatically."
"> can already see and identify objects orders of magnitude better than humans can

Citation needed"
"But so far that's definitely not been the case. We've seen Tesla cars misidentify or plain not see objects. For example, if you halved the resolution of the current cameras on the Tesla would it be enough? What if you halved it again? Resolution matters, and so does the fact that lidar works in conditions where radar or cameras don't.

Driving based on vision alone is definitely possible. But that doesn't mean that Tesla's current sensor suite is enough, or that with current processing power cameras are enough."
"It looked like the exact opposite to me. The glass bent and jumped around on the table, dispersing some of the energy. In the truck the glass didn't have anywhere to flex so instead all the energy went into the glass itself."
It’s probably more just that throwing a metal ball gives it more energy than dropping it.
*exactly.*
I'm guessing one motor per wheel at the front or back and an additional motor powering the remaining two wheels?
That’s why people should be concerned about Ford.  They anticipate being able to sell 50k Mach-Es year one.  With Ford’s size they need that number to be at least 10x for an SUV.  First year for Model Y will be in excess of 300k.
"Which is... great? Just because the truck seemed more designed to fitting the role of city truck doesn't mean it can't be used as a practical tool? But like other people have noted, there are many design choices with this truck that makes it less practical for someone doing traditional truck things."
"Fine, a very obvious opinion.  To find beauty in that low poly 90s console render is quite shocking."
100% done. My wife said it looked hideous when I told her she can finally have a truck she always wanted. I don't think she has the same sense of style as I do.....
"Have you ever driven in a modern truck? The new ones are doing 0-60 in like 6 seconds. Getting 33 mpgs highway and 23 in city. They have IFS unlike older trucks with live axles that don’t handle as well. 

Yeah they’re not going to drive like a sports car but people don’t buy them to do that."
This was my thought as well. Also how difficult would it be for rescue workers to break the glass when needed? Hopefully it's still breakable in the ways that it should be.

"That’s not why he presented terribly. Go watch the Model Y event. Everything goes as planned, still an awful presentation"
"Flat panels flex easily, and don't have as much rigidity as a curved sheet of metal. for example a flat sheet compared to one that has been stamped into a bowl shape. This thing is nothing but flat shapes and unless it is very thick, or has a lot of extra support underneath, it will flex."

Did you see how the panel shook when hit with the hammer? I think this may be a real possibility.
*Every window breaks*

"This new truck doesn’t look any uglier than a regular F150 or Silverado. Just because we are all used to the looks of the latter doesn’t make them pretty. 

But if we do care about the looks of something that is meant to be judged by specs, well — looks are subjective, and shaped by trends. In 2007, most phones had lots of physical buttons, and that was normal. Then the iPhone came out, and many people dismissed it as weird. Well, twelve years later, almost every phone looks more like the iPhone than whatever came before the iPhone. Not saying this will happen, just using an analogy of how an initially polarising but innovative product can reshape what is considered “normal”. 

This truck is certainly different and polarising, but its design is extremely simple and minimalist, which typically means it will age well.

Also, I still don’t get why someone who *needs* a pickup truck wouldn’t buy one that does everything their truck can do, is also better than their truck for non-truck stuff, and on top of all that is probably cheaper to own once you factor in total costs?"
"I think at this point everything that could be said about this truck until it’s actually sold has been said. In the meantime, we’re just arguing about opinions, which rarely gets anyone anywhere. 

I like it. Some people think it’s hideous. Whatever. Time will tell."
"if it had great specs, sure why not?"
Probably just with they type that clip on the edge.
how is that a mars truck? what would you do with a pick bed on mars? wouldnt you just want a towing body? wouldnt a flat bed be better and more configurable?
The electric f150 is going to be released before this one anyway and it's going to actually look like a truck.
F-150s are so boring looking though
"I think they’ll still make a more traditionally designed truck in the future.

For now, this truck will mostly be purchased by celebrities, and may bleed into the mainstream if it gets enough exposure."

right. that's like saying mac pros cost 6700. it's disingenuous to pretend like the most expensive version is the defacto version.
I just don’t see who the market is for this. The market seems too niche in my opinion simply because the styling is going to turn a lot of people away
"I’m all for design progress, and I understand that an EV truck doesn’t need a giant upright hood and fenders... but that is what the average consumer is used to purchasing. Perhaps a more normal truck sold alongside the Cybertruck."
"Yeah there will still be a market for them for sure, especially considering the performance specs. Now if people grow on it and it manages to take a sizable chunk of the market, only time will tell! Definitely the ballsiest move by Tesla so far. Regardless of design, I’d still be a liar if I said i wouldn’t be pumped as hell seeing one of these at a stoplight lol"
Anyone who downvotes this has likely never backed a box trailer into a tight spot
"Some of us need an 8' bed. How am I supposed to bring 20 - 8' plywood sheets in this? Move large furniture? So now I need to go get a trailer to make the Tesla as functional as a work truck? I think they have missed the mark here. Big time. 

It's the best selling market segment. People want looks, functionality and performance. I think the Tesla has a lot of room for improvement and I'm hoping these issues are addressed. Non-pickup owners may buy this but serious truck owners won't, not without changes."

"You won't have nearly the maneuverability as with a regular truck. One of the advantages of a fifth wheel trailer is the ability to have the truck and trailer at 90° (or more) during tight parking situations. Given the raised bedsides you're really not going to be able to turn quite sharply. Basically, you're gonna jack-knife way before 90°.
The trailer in the photo was just an example but you can have the front of the trailer come quite close to the cab (while still leaving room for turning)."

"Yeah that's what I'm getting at, the lack of versatility for existing aftermarket equipment."
">Do these companies detach the entire bed of the trucks you are talking about

Yes they do. A lot of companies put specialized equipment or aftermarket beds on the back of trucks, this is so common that companies like Ford just sell trucks without beds on them at all. Just plain white cabs without anything on the back because cities and companies that do specialized work just use that space for their specific needs anyway.

Edit: this is why you rarely see pickups with beds that are completely attached to the cab in one piece, it's removable for aftermarket equipment."

"Rivian has said they want to produce 50,000 units a year. Not sure if they broke down the percentage of truck to SUV... but if they can match Model X’s demand of 10,000 a quarter, they would be right on target. 

If they sold for cheaper, but sold more units.. it would not do them any good because they can’t produce that many. Better to keep the price high and production low while learning and growing off the start.

Just because it costs more than you or I would pay, doesn’t mean there isn’t a good market for them."

They’re already taking preorders...No chance this thing seems a major redesign before going into production.  Unless they just don’t get preorders and scrap the design and start over (which they should)
True . I think it's folded parts bolted together if a price gets damaged then replace it just like a regular car. Tesla is no longer in the business of making repairs difficult . So I don't think they would do anything g to make this flying wedge of a car more difficult to repair . It's almost exactly the same size of a Ford rlf 150.
"Yeah, I'd like to see actual legal specifications on both things, thank you. Plus, this won't be going into production for at least a couple of years."

Not this one.  People will not buy something this ugly.  It's why they made their cars look good.

> raising and lowering suspension is a nothing feature

Now this really makes me think you don't know truck guys. 

In addition, it's speed/pick-up/handling is impressive and it's towing ability is double that of it's main competitor. Other then the divisive look of it (which for my tastes, i love) the specs and price are objectively great."
Do you not know that rivian has air suspension too?

The gullwing doors don't bother me as much as the front doors. I'm getting tired of pushing the button and waiting for them to open. Open the fuck up already!
It's a nonstarter. This thing is dead in the water in 99% of the US truck market. Most of the people buying this will have never owned a pickup truck before. I guarantee it.
"We've talked a lot in this thread, though, about how particular this market is. First impressions are super important. There are so, so many truck buyers out there that just have to say, ""Psht, where does my ladder rack go?"" or ""Oh my God can you imagine what Doug would say if he saw me pull up in that?"" It doesn't matter if it can pull 100k lbs if nobody ever looks at it past first glance.

Tesla could have made a truck that didn't leave those points out there to be picked at. I think I speak for most of us when I say I expected them to do exactly that. But this is a totally different direction and, in my opinion, not a wise use of their resources right now."
Ya you might wanna take a look at model S and X sales.....they might as well shut down production on them because they ain't selling well at all

Elon warned us that it would have this effect and said they'd probably design a more traditional looking pickup. They will have to see the numbers and then decide. I believe if they tweak the current one they could bring the price down while increasing sales.
"I hear ya, but i suppose my point is that before the model s electric cars were seen as nerdy, dinky, slow and uncool. With it's introduction it has set a bench mark that most other companies aspire to meet/beat. I dont believe that the Cybertruck is meant to start a trend per say. It will be a very niche vehicle for sure

Edit: spelling"
"Im sure they took care of that before they built this. It must meet regulations. I just don't see this properly working as a rugged workhorse truck. The cover for the back could easily get tons of grit and shit in the tracks so they stop working. There's no tailgate to open. The back is slope, so you can't pile in as much stuff. It's just more of a gimmick than a real truck to me."

Yup!
Agreed. I feel the entire truck market is heading that way. I’m a “weekender” and I work a desk job but I have a full size truck. I picked a V8 because I know I’d be able to tow something and V8’s resale is much higher. Hauled many a offset smokers and pulled a 25 ft trailer once. But mostly for hauling deer back home.

Same here. I have no idea what the fuck they were thinking when they greenlit this.  The window shattering was symbolic to this whole idea.
It depends on your credit rating but an interest free loan to a company who has had issues making a profit quarter to quarter is still better than having to go for a loan.
"Again, why does that matter? It's a boat."
"But you do know that a track is not a straight line, do you? And again, its a PORSCHE, not a PORCHE.

Apart from that - there isnt ""a Porsche"", they used a low-trim 911, not even the current model lol. A higher trim 911 will shit all over the cybertruck in both a straight line and especially on track.

Saying that a car has ""better"" performance than another one, because it goes faster in a straight line is borderline retarded. Car performance is about multiple areas, like corning and braking too - in both of which any Porsche would absolutely anihilate this truck.

Dude, I dont have a problem with Tesla, EVs or even the Cybertruck - but saying that the Cybertruck has ""better performance"" than ""a Porsche"", because it beats an outdated low-trim 911 in a straight line is just dumb."
Has anyone ever told you that you’re hard to get along with? I can’t be the only one.
"For non-adaptive air suspension I assumed they just filled it up once and never vented the air (like filling a tire) and leaks would just screw your suspension over time.

For adaptive I imagined the same thing but either they had multiple chambers at varying pressures and switched between them, or the chamber size was automatically adjustable to increase/decrease pressure slightly (essentially an air compressor but it's pre-loaded with air and doesn't vent, so they can fill it with dry air and not need to suck in new air)"

"The new Silverado is fuck ugly too, and their sales have slipped massively. And it still at least looks like a pickup. 

Before the new model, they sold between 40k and 80k more trucks per year than Ram. 

After releasing the new model, they've dropped to Ram now selling 20k more so far this year than Chevy. It was a pretty big screw up and I'd be shocked if they don't do some pretty extensive changes to the front fascia for the mid cycle refresh. 

People care about aesthetics in pretty much everything in life dude."
"> This new truck doesn’t look any uglier than a regular F150 or Silverado. Just because we are all used to the looks of the latter doesn’t make them pretty.

Disagree entirely. [The F150 looks pretty to me](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS9xxMyY2a-wS9cKoE07DFpX_KWwlMwXNECMNwztrUFBS7HsiJC_w&s) and to most truck buyers.


I mean there's a reason trucks look the way they do. Trucker buyers like that look."
But the roof goes up into a point! You need four points of contact (your clips) for a roof rack. So the roof rack will run at a slope which serves as pointless. Unless extensive modifications are done

"In this case I think it does. They built a truck to compete with other trucks, the only one in their line that really does that is the top end one. And it doesn’t even do it well.

As for the Silverado example: here’s a contrived hypothetical analogy. 

If, in 2007, BlackBerry had released a phone that was essentially the same as every other Blackberry phone, but slightly unusual looking, it would have probably flopped. Being just a little too different, it wouldn’t have appealed to the existing blackberry owners, but being too similar to other blackberry phones, it wouldn’t have appealed to new people. 

Instead, in 2007, Apple released the iPhone, that was completely different from all the other smartphones at the time. And in short order it both expanded the market and, having broken the mould, converted many existing smartphone owners too.

This truck is not just a slightly new take on an existing model. It’s very different, which means it could (not saying it will, but could) do the same."
"> I mean there's a reason trucks look the way they do. Trucker buyers like that look.

And 10 years ago trucks looked a bit different than now, and 20 years ago different still, and 50 years ago even more so. And in 20 years they will look different than now (whether more like the Cybertruck or more like the current F-150 only time will tell). It’s possible that the most popular pickup truck of 20 years in the future could be considered ugly by most truck buyers now, just like most pickup buyers now would not consider the most popular pickup truck of 20 years ago to be the prettiest today. 

My point is that it’s all subjective. To a large degree, our perceptions of beaty and aesthetic appeal are shaped by our culture and trends. Not only is it subjective, it is conditioned by external information. The fact that you consider the F-150 to look pretty is mostly a consequence of what you have been conditioned to appreciate. 

I, for example, think the F-150 and all modern trucks look overly aggressive and unappealing. I much prefer the look of old-timey round pickups. Am I in the minority? Most likely. But I didn’t grow up around pickup trucks, they are not a part of my culture, so I haven’t been as conditioned to have a certain aesthetic context for them. 

And the more I look at it, from a blank slate, not considering what other pickup trucks look, the more I like the Cybertruck. 

However, arguing about opinions on aesthetic appeal is probably the most fruitless argument two people can have. So let’s just agree to disagree. 

I merely wanted to remind everyone that people’s opinion of what objects (including pickup trucks) look like is not objective and does not exist in a vacuum."

"Elon began his speel by trying to sell everyone that the industry has got it all wrong for decades and that Cyber truck will disrupt the industry.

"Considering the number of trucks used in industry that need to haul commercial trailers similar to this, that seems unlikely. It may not be 20% though, I'm not sure. I do know where I live it seems like everyone has a fifth wheel in the summer but I live near the mountains where glamping is common. That said, it certainly would influence my decision to buy a truck with this type of design. 

Given how many people buy trucks with the thinking of ""at least I will be able to do X if I need to"", it may influence more people than you'd expect. Many, many people own trucks and never use them for even 5% of what they are capable of, but they like the idea of having that capability if they need it. If they could see themselves having a fifth wheel trailer in the near future, they might discount this vehicle."
"If you’re willing to de-escalate, let me say that I’m someone who wouldn’t mind switching to electric trucks for work, but this release looks like it is going to miss the segment, which is a shame.

Dude, that's so ridiculous and disingenuous. That was a heavy metal ball- there is absolutely no other truck out there that wouldn't have had it's glass shatter in that scenario. 

Right prior to that, they demonstrated it working as intended and it bounced right off. Trying to characterize it as a ""small rock"" and pretending, even with it's demonstration failure, that any other truck's windows would be different is incredibly dishonest.

> And a covered top, as a requirement makes it's pick up quality questionable.

What are you talking about? It's not a requirement- it rolls up inside. There's nothing stopping Tesla from releasing an additional top to give it extra height.

This truck goes the opposite way. You want an electric truck? Ok, here's something that looks nothing like any other truck you've driven and will stick out like a sore thumb everywhere you go. 

That's not how they got here and this makes me wonder if anybody there understands that."

"I agree, it's not going to return with more energy. But, Franz did not throw the ball with the exact amount of energy for the ball to reach a velocity of 0 right as it reached the window. 

Let's say that Franz is standing 1 ft from the vehicle. He launches the ball with a velocity x and it impacts the vehicle at some velocity y, where y < x. In a perfectly elastic collision the ball will leave the surface at velocity -y because no kinetic energy is lost. By the time it reaches Franz again, it is traveling at velocity y - (x-y) [(impact speed) - (change in speed from launch to impact)]. Now we can easily pick values of x and y such that y - (x-y) > 0 and therefore still has forward velocity by the time it reaches Franz again. 2y-x >0.

Here's an example:
Franz launches the ball at 20 mph (A baseball pitcher throws ~100 mph. This is a fifth of that speed, and he's also throwing a lighter ball). I'm not sure what the deceleration due to air resistance is, but lets' assume it's losing 5 mph/sec. If the vehicle is 2 feet away, we can say we're at ~19mph by the time we impact the window (I'm being conservative here too. Used some kinematic equations, just don't want to type it out). The ball will reflect back at -19mph, and will be traveling around 18mph past Franz. This leaves enough speed to make it into the crowd.

Now of course, the shattering of the glass probably absorbed most of the energy and this was definitely not an elastic collision and that makes most of this calculation irrelevant. 

Alls I'm tryna say is that the pendulum demo is not applicable here."
"The General public doesn't watch presentations, they will read about it on a blog, see it on the news, etc, etc. And most of all, it's going viral, so forget mainstream media, this will be all over social media tomorrow.

No truck in history ever had the kind of attention this thing will."
"I very much doubt that anyone who wants one of these, is your typical buyer looking for a vehicle.

The other vehicles are as much a competition, as the rest of the phones/blackberries and whatnot, where to the iPhone. And guess what, they weren't."
"There's a video farther up of the press being driven around the block in it. They ask specifically about the steering wheel staying and the driver said that they always improve on things as they move toward production. So I'm doubting this thin will still as is. Also, the thing I noticed was no windshield wipers lol"
Also you will run out sooner or later. So unless you have a degree in petroleum chemical engineering you will be stuck with walking. Hydropower and wind power are way easier to maintain over a very long period of time.
Oh I do. Just want to learn new things.
"The iPhone _wasn't_ completely different though. They just stole the whole thing from LG, who released the first capacitive touchscreen smartphone. 

Both were just rehashes of the older resistive touchscreens PDAs with better tech."
Based on what? Even the tri motor just barely edges out the highest tow capacity Ford offers on the F150.
"Based on what specs?

Torque, horsepower, range and clearance. That's what matters in a truck. Ford hasn't released theirs yet that I'm aware"
"Not 4wd, tows less, carries less, body and bed shape make it impossible to add can, camper or other accessories, bed shape makes it awkward to dump loads or get large items in and out.
This isn’t a truck to compete with other trucks, it’s an suv with a bed for current Tesla lovers."
"I really doubt there are people out there who are remotely thinking Cybertruck who would somehow decide to buy a Model 3 instead.  What's the reasoning that follows?  ""Oh, I really wanted something to haul around my kayaks and go into the backcountry, but it looks too weird, I'll get a highway-only sedan with no cargo space instead."""
"Yeah this is what has been said about Tesla since they’ve started. Yet they keep proving everyone wrong. Their designs and long term cost of ownership click with people. It’s not like they started out with 600K reddit fans and subscribers, people gravitate to the best products. Maybe this time is different. But Im skeptical that you speak for every truck owner in the US. Only time will tell."
"If you want to make inroads in the pickup market you need to win over fleet beaters.  Especially if you want to convert those gas/diesel powered fleets to electric.  And you can't tow a 5th wheel or gooseneck trailer with this, so there goes another huge market segment.  All I'm saying is they need to redesign the bed."

"The batteries will likely be between the wheels in the frame of the skateboard. There may be room for a gooseneck, at least knowing how my Dad's F-350 5th wheel gooseneck+hitch is attached, it might work. I'd have to see the Cybertruck up close for a better look.

I honestly thought it wasn't going to be like this... still in shock, actually."
They’ve already mentioned that there is under-bed storage so I’m doubting the battery is there or takes up the entire applicable bed — that storage space might even be there explicitly because they designed it with a gooseneck hitch in mind.
A gooseneck doesn't matter.  The max trailering capacity is 14000 pounds and that is your standard run of the mill tandem axle bumper pull.
"With a couple aftermarket parts I can get power tools and an air compressor attached. Plus a welder and a plow, and if I fuck anything up in the bed I can just replace it."
"I would be very surprised if they didn't eventually. They definitely realize how much money is in industrial vehicles. It's just going to be something they're going to have to focus on in the future while they get Model Y, Roadster, and Semi production going first. I bet they even have designs for a mini semi.. Cybertruck probably isn't a great vehicle for tons of (at least quick) revenue. Tesla doesn't expect it to be anytime soon either.  


This is a extremely future focused company. It will just take longer to break into some things than others, like their solar and power storage business.. it was fairly non-existent since they had to focus on production hell for the Model 3 and all that, now it's finally getting focused on again and picking up pace."
">You're upset that you think there might not be crumple zones based on no data you giant retard

Oh no, the crumple zones are just one of a myriad of reasons why this truck is stupid. They took a sledge hammer to a stainless steel alloy, have you ever heard of material properties? The crumple won't be near as good as on Tesla's other vehicles. Momentum will be transferred elsewhere. 

>Hint: there's crumple zones , quit bitching

Wait, didnt you just call me a retard for saying something ""based on no data"". Self reflection, my guy. Gobble away.

This is either a collector's car, similar to someone that owns an armored truck, or a truck that people will get for recreation and not for people who actually use trucks for work. It's not practical for blue collar workers, which is upsetting because that seemed to be the target audience. We will see if they make changes."
I’ll have to see what other info comes out on the Cybertruck. But it seems like all the electric trucks coming out first are not designed to be workhorses as the primary thought.
"Literally in the same position but inside the car.

English, do you speak it."
"So pointing out that you lot are kinda crazy is ""defending a piss poor design""? The truck has air ride and can be lowered 4 inches, like when they're loading the ATV, and the boxsides are only a little higher than the norm these days.   
Here's a photo of Elon next to it at full height:  
https://www.tfltruck.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tesla-cybertruck-reveal-official.png. 
  
And with the front trunk I can't think of anything I'd need to reach in the front of the bed and all of my stuff from there on my truck would fit up front.    
  
They have that and the bed cover to increase the non-hauling range by improving air flow."
"That's AN ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT. Manufacturers aren't adding backup cameras for the hell of it.

Go  back and find the other section about the mirrors, that doesn't have an exception for vehicles with rear cameras.

>So, it has a rearview mirror on the windshield.

That does what, exactly? You're so excited about this thing, yet you didn't even notice that the bed cover blocks all rearward vision, making such a mirror useless? I'm disappointed in you."
Correct. I know what construction contractors want. I can't speak on behalf of any other group.
Ok boomer
"You clearly don't know trucks if you don't know the difference between an offroading suspension lift kits and an automatic suspension kit. 

They said it was some crazy, bulletproof armor, and didn't test it properly pre-demo. That's the level of genius here.

And they probably won't make later stuff for any reasonable price, it will be aftermarkets, and they will also probably be crazy expensive."
"Look even if you are correct and only new Pickup buyers purchase this, why would that matter if they are able to sell everything they produce? Like Either this will sell or it won't. It doesn't matter at all who is buying it."
"Doesn’t mean they aren’t selling, dingus. iPod sales dropped when the iPhone came out. What’s your point?"
"I'm sorry if I misunderstand!!  
Do you mean the roof that is over the BED of the truck?  
If that is so.. Yes, it seems that the retractable roof over the bed is solely for Aerodynamics and nothing more.  
I think that can go. It is just another ""point of  failure."" In terms of things that need maintenance. Good call.   
Thank you!"
Because no one wants a slow truck?
"> Damn man, I have shit to do, why am I so engaged with this lol?

lol"
"Ah, sorry - I mistakenly thought you were the same person I'd replied to."
"Please describe to me a universe in which a perfect elastic collision happens. Because we don't live in it. And that is what my entire point is. There was a 0% probability of that steel ball hitting the truck, returning to Franz's position, and then carrying on past him, into the crowd, and killing someone. Or even injuring someone. Or even making it to the crowd.

>The ball will reflect back at -19mph

No it won't. You saw the drop test, did you not? Did the person up the ladder need to worry that the steel ball might come back up and hit him? Seriously. We saw it happen three times before the throw test.

Literally nobody that pas passed primary school science should need this explained. Again, because we all should have seen the pendulum experiment and learned that there are losses in every system in this universe. Air resistance, gravity, the conversion of kinetic energy by the window."
"Might want to see how everyone is making fun of the broken windows. Many things can and should be improved.

Btw.. if presentations didn’t make sense, there wouldn’t be so much focus on pitch decks raising millions. Presentations are everything."
What parts of this presentation do you think are going viral right now?
"No wipers and no side mirrors, with the first being illegal in most states and the second one being illegal in the whole of the US."
And there’s a big difference between a phone and a car. It’s like comparing apples and oranges.
No way ford is just going to shit all over their regular trucks in terms of specs and price.
"I was referring more towards people who are just looking to buy a Tesla. If they’re specifically looking for a truck for that purpose, I think most people would just go for something else. We’ll have to see what the final version of this ends up looking like, and how good or bad Rivian’s, Ford’s, and GM’s EV trucks are, but this just seems like the first time where Tesla’s vehicle doesn’t seem like the clear winner. Model S, X, and 3 didn’t really have to compete against other EVs, and they were also competitive against the best ICE cars in their segments. Model Y has the Mach E to deal with, but I still think it comes out on top. The Cybertruck’s design seems too out there, and there are going to be other EV trucks by the time it comes out, so I really wonder how many people will choose it over those or a regular truck."
"Your missing my point, I love Tesla.  But this design is turning a lot of people off.  The features are decent, but whats the point of marketing on the basis of converting people using gas/diesel trucks to electric if they get the basics of truck design wrong.  They need a mass market truck when this is a niche truck."

"Possibly, however even if that is the case being a unibody complicates things. My understanding is that Tesla bodies sit on the skateboard, which is where the powertrain is, the gooseneck would need to attach to the skateboard directly in a way secure enough to pull its max tow rating, attaching it to the body means the body would need to be attached to the skateboard with enough strength to not be ripped off when the powertrain accelerates, in a towing situation, the more that is between the wheels trying to propel the truck and the hitch of the trailer resisting the weaker the system.  
In a traditional ladderframe pickup, the gooseneck attaches directly to the frame, as does the powertrain, so there is no actual stress on the truck body from towing."

You sound like a giant dumb baby


>The crumple won't be near as good as on Tesla's other vehicles. 

You're assuming that with no supporting data. So dopey."
"Yes, I do. If you look at them, they are sitting at the exakt same angle to you as a normal mirror. No difference."
So now instead of grabbing my stuff and going I have to lower the bed to grab it. You are trying to hard.
I love it that you are so angry about it.
You can’t speak on behalf of any group.  The fact that you have one or two anecdotal incidents of construction contractors not liking the Tesla is (as all anecdotal evidence is) utterly meaningless.

"> You clearly don't know trucks if you don't know the difference between an offroading suspension lift kits and an automatic suspension kit.

Lol. You have no basis to make that claim.

> They said it was some crazy, bulletproof armor, and didn't test it properly pre-demo. That's the level of genius here.

*No, they didn't*. Another lie. They said that about the body. They never claimed the glass was bullet proof. They claimed it was stronger then glass seen in other trucks, something they proved with the ball test. Obviously something failed when they tried threw it (although even that fared better then normal car glass would), some reports are saying they threw a bunch of stuff at it right before the presentation possibly weakening it. Who knows. Either way they proved the glass is stronger then you'll get with other comparable trucks.

I notice you've abandoned the ""small rock"" claim and the claim that they can't (for some reason) produce a removable top for the bed. Fascinating. If you have to continually lie and exaggerate to try and make a point, maybe you're doing something wrong."
"Because it's a waste of time.

The intellectual and financial capital they're spending on this is being spent poorly. Make more Model 3's. Give me a Model S version 2. Give me longer range. Give me more superchargers. Give me new car designs that people will be able to see themselves driving instead of the cars that they have now. You and I both know that there is plenty of room to progress there."
"Yea. I mean if people want a traditional pickup, might aswell get rid of it and lower some cost or just use it for something else"
Nobody want's a useless bed either but here we are.
"No no I totally agree haha. See the 2nd to last paragraph in my reply above:
> Now of course, the shattering of the glass probably absorbed most of the energy and this was definitely not an elastic collision and that makes most of this calculation irrelevant.

The *only* point I'm trying to make here is that *specifically* this is not the same as the pendulum demo. I agree that the ball would not have been a danger to the crowd :)"
"> Might want to see how everyone is making fun of the broken windows. Many things can and should be improved.

Of course they are making fun of it, it was fucking hilarious. The thing won't be coming out for at least two years, they always significantly improve their cars by production.

I'm not saying presentations don't make sense. But they are SO not everything.

The iPad presentation was perfect, like most Apple presentations are. That didn't stop the memes. And it didn't matter. This is not a pitch to investors to finance a project, this is a launch presentation. All that REALLY matters is the product (or service or whatever is being presented). A presentation can't make or break that.

The Google Wave presentation was a MASSIVE success, only comparable to the monumental failure the service ended up being.

I get the point that this particular presentation seemed particularly sloppy for a ""serious"" company. I agree. But I also appreciate the fact that it comes across as transparent and genuine, *that* connects with people. Fully scripted and extremely rehearsed presentations trigger our native spam filters. This is no secret, everyone who knows anything about marketing or advertising knows this."
"It's no use, man.

  


You can lead a jackass to water or something."
You are kidding right? Open the internet and look: https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cybertruck&src=trend_click
"My point was not about the phone itself, it was that consumers at the time didn’t exactly turn out to have durable preferences for the status quo."
"I guess I get what you’re saying. Basically you’re saying that this won’t eat Ford’s lunch, and that the consumers for it are a niche group who particularly want an EV. I would put myself in this group: people who like the concept of EVs and Tesla’s autonomy tech, but can’t fit their lifestyle into any of Tesla’s current vehicles. I’m in that group - as a particular kind of avid outdoorsman, I need something with the capacity to carry a lot of cargo including bulky items, and since Tesla’s existing entry to the SUV market can’t even take a roof rack or any long objects inside, I’ve been forced to wait; in fact I had to cancel my recent Model S order after a test drive confirmed that I couldn’t fit all my gear in it. So this truck is a perfect solution for me, or at least the best solution yet announced (the same thing in a full-size van would have me drooling). 

The only real weakness I see in this design for a traditional truck consumer is the high sidewalls around the bed. Besides that, it outclasses the only other announced utility EV, the Rivian, and the radical design is something utility buyers can easily overlook. GM and Ford have put out some ugly-ass designs over the years, including some that were controversial like the Avalanche, 2003 Silverado, and 2004 Colorado, which truck people initially trash-talked before they went on to become very popular. 

Based on what has currently been announced, the Cybertruck is the best product on a spec sheet of any announced electric pickup. So I really disagree with you that it isn’t the “clear winner.” It’s possible that Ford and GM will outperform it when announced, yes, but based on past performance we have no reason to expect that. Everything traditional automakers have produced so far falls well short of Tesla on every specification. That even applies to announced future vehicles, such as VW’s upcoming products which according to announced specs are well behind Tesla’s 2019 lineup. The Jag and Audi SUVs beat Tesla for traditional SUV utility, but lag severely on range and motor performance. 

Essentially the only “serious” critique I’ve heard from anyone about this truck is that it looks weird. Consider as exhibit A the Prius. I would note that if you showed this and the gen 2 Prius in silhouette form, few of us would be able to tell one from the other. So actually the design isn’t radical altogether in the vehicle market, just in truck land. That Prius was a huge hit despite the weird looks that contemporary critics viewed about as harshly as the Cybertruck. I can’t know for sure until the sales figures are out, but I think this design will be similarly successful, and reading this thread will be as comical in five years as old threads about the iPhone and iPod launches."

Boom on boomer
"You mean like the lie that Tesla will make an economy model? And I abandoned it because I realized it was a lead ball. That was objectively my bad. And the removable top, if it rolls up then great. I haven't seen anything about it being able to stay rolled up, and again, expecting additional mods to be anything other than a ridiculous price is insane. 

Face it, this truck is like any other concept vehicle. Fun to look at, but will probably fall flat, and be years behind it's competition. Trucks are massively popular, and people who don't want trucks are not flipping over for this low-res polygon. I'm not expecting to see this on the next hunting, off-roading, shooting range, or camping trip anytime soon. It will sell to a very specific demo, and be a novelty vehicle. 

And not knowing the difference between two very different suspension types is kind of tell, you have no idea what you're talking about with the suspension. You're just dickriding anything with a fancy silver T on it."
"The Plaid powertrain is already being developed for the Roadster and Model S regardless. The Dual Motor powertrain straight up uses the Raven Powertrain. 

The stacked battery is also already under development for the other vehicle models. 

The actual body of the vehicle literally just uses steel with like zero rounded edges and won't even need a paint shop because they literally aren't painting the vehicle. Secondly SpaceX pretty much did all the research into the properties of this steel anyways. The glass is just thicker, not exactly much goes into it other than that.

Sure the suspension is a much beefier air suspension than the one on the X, and the glass may be bigger and it's unibody, But it's not like this is taking them billions of dollars of development costs. In fact it'd probably cost less to set up the manufacturing line for this vehicle at Giga1 than it does stage 1 of Giga3 for the Model 3. Like literally everything about this design makes it very easy to manufacture, and the biggest problem with current model 3 production - the paint shop - they are just saying fuck it to lol. And it's not like the rest of the technological advancements are being worked on specifically and only for this."
"Yes, I think this car is ment to compete with traditional pickups. As for using it for something else.. It could be interesting to slap a solar-panel on the bed-roof and give the truck some more range. I saw that the tailgate had solar panels. Why not move that to the bed-roof :)  
Well spotted. Thank you."

Nah I mean like this lie:

> And a covered top, as a requirement makes it's pick up quality questionable. Standard pick ups have removable tops to allow for taller, awkward objects.

or this bizarre, completely baseless assumption:

> No trailer hitch.

or this one:

> No roof rack

or this one: 

> 50k for a truck is not affordable. 

Pretty much all that is stuff would have answered for you by a quick google search, but instead you needed to justify your bizarre hate boner and ran with it. It's crazy to see how the design has triggered you and turned you into some drooling ""reaal AMURiCanZ WILl NEVeR UsE THIS!"" lunatic. 

The strangest part is, we completely agree that the design will turn a lot of people off. There is a huge swath of middle americans that will never give it a chance. But *from what we actually know* the specs itself, what the truck can do is very, very impressive. You continue to randomly assume (based on nothing other then...you don't like the way it looks?) they haven't designed it to be used off roading or camping to justify yourself- but that belief is based on nothing. 

Ultimately we will have to see whether it's embraced or not. Only time will tell that. If anything turns people off, it will definitely be the style, but what it can actually do is very encouraging.

> And not knowing the difference between two very different suspension types is kind of tell, you have no idea what you're talking about with the suspension. 

I'm enjoying this part because you're literally just talking to yourself. Constructing a false narrative based on some strawman argument. I've said *exactly one thing* about it- it's that calling adjustable suspension a ""nothing feature"" is fucking stupid. Because it is. From that you're trying to construct some laughable dick measuring contest about who knows more about suspension types but I've said absolutely nothing for you to base my knowledge of the topic on (nor am I interested in doing so).

>Toolbox, saws and buckets.

 This is your huge dilema that's a deal breaker for you because you can't reach over the side and get? I mean, it's okay to not like the truck, it's quite unusual, but if that's the only reason it's kinda ridiculous.   
I mean, think about it, you don't wanna drive a truck as fast as a Mustang with 16 inches of ground clearance that doesn't dent with a sledgehammer that you never have to buy gas for and that can drive you partway home after work when you're tired because you'd have to put your toolbox, saws, and a couple of buckets up front?"

I don't have a hate boner, I just don't see a single thing that justifies this concept other than ""eh, let's waste money!

Like I said, the market for this truck isn't really Ford's and while I think the Rivian is cool they have yet to actually bring anything to market and Tesla has.

Clearly the author of this article has never actually played Rocket League, and quite likely doesn't play video games.

This title is super misleading
Added to modded PC GTA.. cries in game console GTA
"Misleading, most were mods"
Really needs to be in 2077
"I'd ask if it's going to be in Cyberpunk 2077, but it looks like that was their design template."
talk about a misleading title sheesh
The title is misleading and makes you think the developers added the car to the games.
The music that's being played on the Minecraft video sounds like music a 12 year old thinks is edgy for this generation.
Is it going to be available as dlc for Garfield Kart though?
Why does the rocket league game make ICE engine sound? :P
">Tesla herself

I'm sorry wut is this article"
and they said tesla has no marketing :D free advertising here boys/girls
They probably modeled it on their lunch break.
"Well, I was saving for a b11 strikeforce in gta, but I guess now I’m getting a cyber truck"
"Anyone else misread the title and thought the cybertruck was going to come with GTA 5, Minecraft, and Rocket league (as, you can play them on the touchscreen)"
I bet it was easy to add that to Minecraft.
Hopefully added to Forza/gt soon
They modeled it in no time...
"Can this be added to Simpsons hit and run for the GameCube Mr. Musk, please and thank you."
"I mean, how hard can it be to render 12 ploygons?"

"In 3 years from now I hope i'll be buying a Model S with all the latest updates, 1.8s to 60 and a reasonable capacity with a reasonable price. Cant wait!"
MOMMA WE MADE IT!!!
Don't forget about [Low-Fi](https://vimeo.com/375213220)!
I could go for a Cyberwagon in Red Dead.
My wife asked how they managed to add it so quickly. Its quite light on polygons...
Minecraft? How?!
Gran Turismo Sport please!
It's not gonna take a lot of effort
Here is one you can play with on your Tesla console or any mobile device: bit.ly/VirtualTesla
A GoldenEye 64 modder added it to there. Not familiar with him but his name is graslu00
They could add this truck to PS1 games
"I really hope we see it in Cyberpunk 2077, such a fitting car, even a cameo"
Hoping for a cyberhorse in RDR2.
Mods. What was that rocket league running on? A 2001 Nokia?
I have a feeling cyberpunk 2077 will have a sponsored cybertruck.   It would make perfect sense for tesla an CD projekt red
The cars graphics are higher resolution in the game than real life lol!
HECTIC
"And BeamNG Drive.

My son pointed out a YouTuber crash video today :)"
"Cybertruck absolutely needs to be added to GTA Online for real, but with either a functioning ramp to put a small vehicle in the bed, or just a massive laser turret in the bed"
I still think jeep gladiator is THE truck

""Hey Jim, mind throwing about 4 pixels roughly in the shape of a CT?""

4:55 pm

CT ADDED TO GAME MODE"
is this all just a game to you elon!?
They just ported the models from Rad Racer
Misleading. When I first saw this I thought they were officially added to the game but are just mods.
I wouldn't be surprised if Rockstar puts a parody version of this in GTA Online or GTA VI. There's already a car based on Tesla in GTA V and that was 2013
Wtf do you mean they added it in mincecraft?
neat
oh no my eyes burn
"Just to clarify the car was NOT actually added to the games it was modded in and if I read correctly, the GTAV guy has not even made it public."
"Title is clickbait. When something is added, it means its directly added by developers. All of these are modded in which is very misleading"
Minecraft? How does that fit? Unless it’s been added with a Mod but anything can be added with a mod
"Intensely ridiculed, we thought it to be hilarious to embed it into every aspect of our civilisation.  
Before we realized what we'd done, it was too late.  
The cybertruck had been made undying, ageless.  
And as such, would remain a symbol to ridicule ourselves, forever."
"To be fair, the truck is pretty much a meme that no one is going to buy. I'd like to see the attrition on those $100 reservation deposits when it launches, I don't think many people will follow through."
The one to overthrow the merc
As long as it is supersonic and acrobatic
Yes it would. I am a rocket league player myself and this would be such a good meme.
It's so true.  At thanksgiving my uncles were indifferent about Tesla. Anyone under 25 was drooling.
The older Gen Z should be already driving. More if you count the cutoff for the last millennials as 1996 instead of 2000 (I’ve seen both years given as the end of the millennial generation).
"As someone from Gen Z, this is extremely true. I'm definitely planning on a Tesla as soon as I get my licence."
"I'm a gen Z, and I am super into the Tesla truck. I can technically afford it, but it's just not a good idea to drop $40k on a car when my current one still works just fine."
"We can drive, we have been driving for like 6yrs now."
'cos people \_want\_ to market them.
"> When Gen Z can drive, legacy auto is fucked

Except Gen Z can't afford anything."
We can. But we are also still broke teenagers/ very early 20s so not exactly buying cars based off anything more than price
I'm your 1000th upvote. Tesla is the next Apple. The cybertruck is a catalyst that will change everything.
Theyre already fucked but just dont know it.  Toyota one of the most successful brands in the world refuses to embrace electric and still believes “there is no demand.”
This has literally nothing to do with some random guy making a mod
"Tesla never even has to market, the viral aspect of their products and Elon save tons on marketing costs.  They also know how to uniquely position their products in the market to be part of the conversation. Elon Musk has a bit of that World's Fair flair that gets people excited."
[deleted]
"Gen z here, would buy this and drive it if I had the money ;-;"
"These are user mods, not the work of ""Tesla marketing"""
Tesla didn’t do this they are mods
Us Gen Z's are already starting to drive rn anyone born in 2004 or before is/has been in drivers ed
Gen Z already can drive
"Gen Z can drive, proud zoomer here."
Zoomer with a driver's license checking in. Counterpoint: We're all fucking broke
The oldest of gen z can already drive
Most gen z in here in the nordic countries me included will buy diesel cars beacuse electric cars are boring and ugly
I've been able to drive for almost 5 years bud
Gen Z will barely be owning / driving vehicles.
"Where we're headed, GenZ doesn't need to drive 😍"
"Same thing with Minecraft. Mojang did not suddenly add cars to their game, it's a mod."
"Yeah and it won’t go into rocket league until an official sponsorship happens, the vid is some custom game thing and it looks unwieldy haha, like a merc but longer"
The only game on the list I can see happening is GTA but even then it’s kind of probably not gonna happen.
Yeah I think people don't realize these are user mods. I'm sure rockstar will add a CT mockery though.
I would definitely buy this thing if rockstar releases it
True but creators did.  There aren't many other EVs or cars going in unless they have that interesting factor.  The cybertruck sells itself and markets itself via these channels.  Tesla doesn't even have to do marketing like other car companies.
"I can't think of many names that are supposed to have 'the' before it besides ""the internet"" and ""The Ukraine"" and even that no longer applies"
is it though
"I don't think it's in vanilla Minecraft or RL either, but yeah"
All

Who's to say it's not going to happen :P"
"It likely will be, if not a similar car. I can't wait for that game to come out"
Welcome to this subreddit
Seems translated from Chinese or something
"Marketing includes things like price etc. They don’t buy ads. They produce spots though so there is some spending. But they end up on YouTube and I guess their website, etc."
"*curiously calls Tesla HR, enquiring about openings in their mod development department*"
It likely will eventually
Tesla is suspiciously missing from Forza what the hell Elon
"Not really legit marketing. They’re just mods done by users, not anything official."
That's great!
Idk why your claiming that. Plenty of people are interested in it.
You're being downvoted but you raise a fair point. A $100 \*refundable\* deposit makes the reservation numbers fairly meaningless. Only good for press releases.
The true savior
Legend says the original design for the Tesla truck used the dimensions of the Road Hog’s hitbox ...
Uncles are a skeptical species
"Ugh, I got hit with a really unexpected attack when my ~30 year old cousin got to our Thanksgiving party. My dad and uncle were watching the Cybertruck reveal, and she comes in and says ""Oh I *hate* Elon Musk. He's a misogynist."" And then walked out of the room. Completely killed the mood.

I tried to ask her why she believed that, and she gave the standard response of ""Look it up, he totally hates women."" So I did. Didn't find any actual evidence of misogyny, of course. Just a bunch of unsubstantiated comments about his diverse and blog posts about how he refuses to pay women the same as men. Despite his highest paid employee being a woman..."
If the amount of questions I get at EVERY social gathering are any indication people are definitely interested. All ages.
"Ummm last night I was out for thanksgiving and I overheard a guy saying “I’m getting dual motor all wheel drive” I had a feeling he was talking about the truck, then I heard him say something about the tri motor. When I walked by him, he has his credit card next to his phone and was putting in his order for the cyber truck. It’s insane."
45 yo uncle here. I will own a Tri motor cyber truck.
"Funny, I just turned 25 and I despise it."
My uncle plans to get a Model 3 for my cousin and wants the Cybertruck
My uncle had the Audacity to say the Rivian was baetter
"I met a Tesla owner at Supercharger, he went with a friend and his friend had a teenager daughter. Me and the guys talked about ev and Tesla alot

However, his daughter didn't like the idea of 30 minutes at Supercharger, and she was like  ""I don't like ev because I don't like to charge my car."""
[deleted]
But mention a peasant Audi and they're all ears.
"I don’t understand why anyone on this planet would want this steaming pile of Roblox shit. It’s the ugliest fucking thing I’ve ever seen, who in their right mind would want to own this thing?? And I’m Gen Z, most of my friends are, and we all roasted the shit out of that abomination. I don’t know a single soul who was actually interested, and I am mind blown people are actually paying for this *thing*."
I guess I should have said when Gen Z can buy new cars
"I was born in 1996, but I identify as a Gen Z since I dont remember 9/11, and seems like that's the general rule of thumb"
"Glad to hear! Although ""gen Z"" and ""Tesla as soon as I get my licence"" doesn't add up lol"
"*and save up $35,000 for a model 3.*"
Will a licence even be needed for fully autonomous vehicles?
Now about that pesky issue of getting $35k when you’re like 16...
Good man
Smart guy. Plenty of time to build up your finances and buy a luxury car ~mid 30s.
"Yeah I meant buying new cars, not driving. Sorry."
"Well, it does. These arent official additions. just random  mods inserted in games"
Didn’t stop me. I live in an apt in the city and have no place to charge at home. With the SC network it isn’t a problem (and I convinced work to put in chargers too!)
"I live on the east coast now, but am from the Midwest. If you knew how easy it is to own a home in the middle of the country, you'd be crying. Nearly everyone I went to college with bought a house within a year or two of graduating college."
"Yes, 17 other people have informed me"
Ok zoomer
It's almost Ike 27 people haven't already made that comment...
And Rocket League.
"Rocket league has tonnes of cross promotion cars, Batmobile, BTTF Delorean, Hotwheels just to name a few."
I can see it happen but it will probably be named something like Coil Electrowagon and look like someone modeled it from their memory
Gta VI maybe
Dude gta has a fake Tesla brand called Coil
"You're forgetting the three greatest bands of all time, The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, and The Pink Floyd."
Yes
Yeah I'm just giving it another little nudge
Thanks!
You buying one?
"Exactly. If someone is on the fence, It's a small price to pay for your spot in line and have bragging rights but when it comes time to actually buy, it's a really big decision that most will back out of."
That is hilarious.
Man as an overwatch and RL player I was real confused for a second.
Mine was very quick to bring up politics. Went better than expected.
Not all of us.
"Am an Uncle ... Nephews think me and my car are badass, probably more so the car."
"Not all of us,  some preprdered cause that things awesome."
Mine started randomly bitching about how he doesn't want the government collecting any information about him....
New uncle here. Can confirm. Skeptical indeed.
My uncle owns a Tesla and just ordered the roadster
I'm an Australian Gen X uncle/father; I'm drooling and so pissed the current government are slow to support electric cars. Big mining has too big an influence down under...
Wash your mouth out!
I am an Uncle and I preordered. My brother has a Tesla and he was skeptical as to whether he liked it or not. So 1 out of 2 uncles agree.
"When someone tells you to ""look it up"" without first providing an argument I always just don't even continue the conversation"
"No offense, but your cousin sounds like an idiot."
"Ya, I watched a ton of spaceX launches, as far as I can tell he's pretty much hired every female aerospace engineer in existence."
"Cousin has a Model 3, got ran through the ringer of questions. Most were dumb questions, but most you could tell were trying to pretend not to be interested but really were"
">When I walked by him, he has his credit card next to his phone and was putting in his order for the cyber truck.

Dat card limit though"
"I'm talking about Tesla in general, not the cybertruck specifically."
HERESY ^but ^actually ^tho ^the ^Rivian ^looks ^better
I drive a manual and very much enjoy it but I've heard the EV experience is far better.
"Have you driven a Tesla, yet? If not, there's really no way to know if you'll like it *more*. :)"
"It's good to start at the bottom and enjoy the crap, so you have a real appreciation when you drive something decent."
I feel the same way but I liken it to eating meat. Though I may have my preferences its my moral duty to do whats right for the world. God I'm going to miss beating on my Subaru
"Exactly. My uncle had literally just bought a nearly-spec'd-out Tiguan. He could have had a Y and made up the difference in fuel and maintenance in the first year. But he said ""eh, I'd consider it if I drive a lot. but I don't spend much on gas""."
So never?
"I’m Gen Z and I quite enjoy my 2020 Veloster N, but I’ll be upfront about my use of daddies money, obviously not all Gen Z have that privilege"
"Oo, I'm born 1996 and I remember walking into a room where there was something on the TV about 9/11 

What does that make me?"
"The real qualifiers for Gen Z is usually having been born into a world where internet is commonplace and regular.

Gen Y grew up, at least partially, in a pre-internet world. Gen-Z is post-internet.

I was born in 97 and remember 9/11 very clearly."
"Why not? Generation Z is commonly referred to as the ages between 7 and \*22\* ish, but the ending rage is debated."
"They can, I have similar plans, it's entirely possible to finance a Model 3 on a part time student wage where I live and that's the goal."
"Let me introduce you to this wonderful guy, his name is Debt"
"Eventually, no. But I'd wager that law is at least ten years out for the most progressive states like California, and I think ten years is a very optimistic time frame!"
"Do pilots need a license for their autonomous flying machines?

Yes, yes they do."
"Yes, and I'll definitely have a licence before FSD is a real thing."
"Erm, except for that whole financial planning thing."
That’s my point. Someone made a mod and now this is Tesla brilliance taking down the legacy automakers and sticking it to the man?
McLaren 720 and Dodge sponsored a few too
"I’ve seen them but they have to get them licensed and that takes time. In GTA, they don’t need licensing because they just call it a different name and change some of the details around"
Imagine reading the title and thinking cybertruck was actually added to Minecraft officially 🤡
"I know, even I kind of wanted to put a deposit down, even though I have no intention of buying one."
"*""YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK!?.... That we should really have deep conversations and really listen to what the other side has to say.  Maybe we can come together better as a country.""*"
So you are skeptical about all of you being so?
"But be honest, your nephew and nieces have another uncle that is THAT uncle."
reminds me of  [https://cybermarketing.cc/](https://cybermarketing.cc/)  lol
"I'm with you. I'd be an uncle if I had siblings. Definitely skeptical, but Tesla passes all my tests."
Sounds like your Uncle is loaded
"Nice! Hey, Tesla passed all my skepticism tests. I could be an uncle if I had siblings hah"
We need our aluminum boy.
Yes but you get grid batteries.
"Would have bought any Tesla my self if there was any incentives/tax breaks, especially the cyber truck. the taxes to get the model x here were upwards of 15k on top of the 90k price tag. Instead I just ended up buying a new hilux, as soon as there are reasonable incentives to buy one I’ll drop the ICE and go electric. 

Even just getting rid of the ‘luxury car tax’ would push me to get one."
"Yeah, I didn't have anywhere to go from there, so I just stopped conversing with her and went to go help finish setting up for dinner."
"She's very intelligent, but I think she's just in the wrong Facebook groups. She's quite recently gone way over the edge with militant feminism, which wasn't the case as little as a year ago."
Love it!
Isn’t the deposit like $100?
The deposit is only $250.
"It's kinda sad that consumers feel a moral duty to alter their habits to prevent global warming, but when it comes to the large corporations that are actually doing all the damage, they're not altering squat if it affects their bottom line."
‘97 reporting in
I’m gen Z and I anticipate having one within 5 years.
What?
"If I wasn’t so intent on staying out of debt through college, I could easily afford that by now, and my parents don’t give me didily squat."
I believe that would make you a millennial.
I mean I don't remember anything about 9/11 because... I live in another part of the world?
"Not that it's impossible, but I'd be surprised if a gen Z from the older side has a wage for a Tesla to make sense while not even having a licence yet."
The rage never ends!
At least where I'm from when you get your license you usually buy a Suzuki Swift made in 1999.
"39k isn't exactly impossible, right out of high school you can get that loan with a co-signer or a job."
"There's a difference between ""can"" and it being a sound decision. If someone's willing to lend you $35-40k for a Tesla on a part-time job there's a problem."
"Much like student loans, pricey up front but the only real choice long term"
"Sounds like a shackle, I'd recommend Senor Investment instead."
What flying machines are fully autonomous?
It's not really any more expensive than gas tho.
Not following
"So what you're saying then is it can't happen in GTA, because it won't be the same thing, but will look similar and be called something else."
"It's okay to misleadingly report things if only idiots will believe it...

Oh wait"
What is this nonsense? You want people to actually listen to each other and accept that they have a logical reason for holding their beliefs? Absurd!
"Wow, what a unique and intelligent take, Mike. I've never heard anyone suggest something quite like that. Could you pass the cranberry sauce?"
*lobs mashed potatoes*
"Not all of us are sceptical. Meaning I'm an uncle, and I ordered one :)"
You are probably correct. I guess I'm the guy who wishes he was that uncle?
Can his uncle be my daddi
"Well he used to own a fleet of ~10 with lambos, Ferrari’s, Porsche’s, Bentley’s etc. then one day he decided that he didn’t want cars that eat 50l/100km"
"Couldn't agree more, if we had a car manufacturing industry to protect I'd understand the ridiculous import duties and sales taxes but we don't..."
"She may be book intelligent, but doesn't sound like she's people or emotion intelligent"
It’s basically the women’s version of male incel groups. Basically a group of people who are pushed out of mainstream society and live in echo chambers
Yeah that shit's a pretty stupid ideology to follow. Good luck with everything :)
Think my uncle is on board for a cybertruck now. He loves fancy trucks (has a Raptor right now)
"Kudos! There’s hope. For real though I think many can already afford them, once they hit their 30s they’ll be buying them like hot cakes."
"Wait wait wait, you were born in 97 and you own a Model 3 ?"
"Gen Z is fucked financially, so they will never be able to buy cars"
"Yeah I get it, that’s why I said that my circumstance is not a reality for most. The vast majority of Gen Z absolutely cannot afford a car, and a large majority very likely will not be able to afford one for a very long time, if ever at all. Our economic systems here in the US are failing, and public transportation will inevitably take over to the level that exists within the majority of the rest of the world, IE Japan, China, all of Europe."
"I’m also 96, however I truly see myself on the cusp! I share traits from both generations."
"21 here, am gen-z. Straight out of college I can afford a Tesla as Software engineer. It's possible, just don't get a bachelor's in art lol."
I’m a Gen Z driving a Tesla! Run my own business haha :)
"I am on the edge of youngest millennial and oldest gen z, I am planning on taking delivery on a LR Model 3 by March. In fairness, I don’t think I really fit in Gen Z."
"eh , trade right out of high school , area with a resonable cost of living , most gens spent it on sex, drugs, and rock n roll, if you bought a tesla , which is more than the price a mobile home , you could probably resell it for a house downpayment and a downpayment on another tesla"
But you probably shouldn’t. I mean priorities right?
"Reading threads like this make me realize people are so so money-dumb. I make a good bit of money and I am hoping I can afford the Cybertruck in 2 years, so to hear someone talking about being a student working part time getting a Tesla makes me weep for their future."
I mean parents by their kids brand new cars all the time.. why not a tesla.
"Totally, my plan is to save before I can get a license, put that down and pay off the rest."
That’s a horrible thought. The real choice is to buy something you can afford.
"Any passenger aircraft you fly on is capable of flying and landing itself.

But the pilots still sit there and must know how to take over if something goes bad."
"Hate to rain on your parade, but you can't get a loan at 16 years old. Assuming you're in the United States."
"You should be driving a sub 5 - 10k used vehicle until you have a pretty established career, emergency savings, no bad debt etc.   


Tesla’s are great fun but saying they aren’t more expensive and are a good option for people just starting out is horrible horrible advice."
"Yes as all the other vehicles. The thing is that no company really wants to associate themselfs with a 18+ game such as gta. The Tesla Model S is already in it, called the Coil Raiden: https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Raiden"
/r/enlightenedcentrism
Everyone has a cool uncle.
If I didn't just buy a Tundra I'd be considering it. My next truck will be a Tesla.
"Ha! Me too.

But to be honest I'm 39, and I think I'm the only person I know IRL who's interested. No one else gets it."
Education can't save everybody.
"Yes, I’ve had it for nearly a year. I drive a lot for work and social gatherings. It’ll be fully paid in three years, and I live with my parents (common for our culture) which is a huge help. I’m still maxing retirement accounts and setting aside for a down payment if needed.

Yeah, I know ideally it’d be like half paid down and used or something. There’s absolutely many better ways to use the money, and I’m frugal in every other part of life, but I don’t regret it. The whole user experience of driving/maintaining this car is on a different league from everything else, and I spend a lot of time in it."
"You can get model 3 on lease for the same price as the finance on an entry-level sedan. If you budget right and save in other places, getting a model 3 shouldn't be that hard."
It’s the millennials that got the shit end of the stick more than the others. Mostly because they graduated college into a global recession which cost them the beginning of their careers and eventually will cost them several peak earning years. They will make hundreds of thousands less than the generation before or after over their working years. Basically a house. Gen Z will be fine.
"What, why? High paying jobs are a dime a dozen out on the coasts for anyone with a decent degree. I see  new hire classes of dozens of kids in their early 20s twice a year. They seem to all be doing quite well."
"There was never as much opportunities as now, I'm optimistic about the future."
"But why not? Serious question. I don’t have any exceptional circumstances. I work 40 hours a week and at a job that has been hiring the whole time I’ve worked here. That’s enough to pay for bills, insurance, food, college tuition, and maintenance on the $2000 corolla I bought in high school from my summer jobs."
Not sure I follow. High paying jobs are a dime a dozen for pretty much anyone with a decent degree on the coasts. Add a post graduate degree and you're set.
"You don't have to be disconnected either. You went for one of the most lucrative fields, good for you (honestly) if you like it, but pretending everybody else that can't conservatively buy a Tesla is an art student is arrogant as fuck."
Unless youre good at art.
"Nice! That's why I said it's definitely not impossible, plenty of ways to make money from a young age, it's just definitely not the average gen Z/young millenial that can/should get a 3."
"Or be financially conservative by skipping the Tesla buying, buying a used Leaf or similar if you really want an EV right now, making the house downpayment and investing the rest. Not saying buying a Tesla isn't possible for them, but it's simply not the best decision if you want healthy finances from a young age."
"Depends, on your situation. I'm probably going to buy a Cybertruck and build a camper trailer to drive around and avoid rent for a few years. 2.5-3 years is the mark where it would even out in cost for me so... Is it a bad idea? 

After 2.5 years you'd have a truck and camper that have a real value unlike rent which was just money down the drain."
"As bad as it sounds, lenders gotta make their profits somehow. This is their target audience."
"I support them

Mainly because I shop used, and repossessed ones should add to the used market available to me.

Especially because most people buy Tesla with long term plans, which makes second hand availability a bit pricier. It’s not like German cars when the people buying them have plans to dump them the moment the warranty expires."
"I'm still learning the ropes of finances because currently I don't NEED to know it, come time to get a job I'll educate myself further, thanks for the reality check.

"The driving factors behind the crumbling of the economic structure of the US comes down to circumstances much larger than just you and me. The ideology that exists behind our economic system, this long existing attempt at establishing a system under the guise of “capitalism,” is beginning to suffer from the reality being that a system designed on the backs of morally wrong principles and worker abuse, no longer stands in a first world society in the end stages of beginning to wake up to what is truly right and wrong. The vast majority of people, and increasingly as the days go by, no longer put up with consuming endless flows of products made through slavery, or incredibly low paying factories in third world countries. The population is on the absolutely brink of realization that the only way to save our world, much less our nation, is through an entire economic rebuild. The capitalistic system we have been trying so desperately to get to work in the US for the last century is reaching the end stages of the limited success it has created the facade of having, we will soon be required to switch to the purely socialist systems of Europe, and almost all other first world nations."

"It’s a software bug, but not in autopilot. MCAS helps the plane behave in a more predictable manner than it normally would (a Max with MCAS off requires trimming the horizontal stabilizer by hand if I remember correctly). There were a multitude of issues related to the 737 MAX and MCAS during its development. The system was very well vetted, then modified to allow it to be more aggressive (for the turning circle test I think?), but never really re-vetted after that. Like all other flight systems, there was an extensive process to go through to get this verified, and this modification thing kind of slipped through the cracks.

That said, as commercial aircraft become more and more advanced, less stable designs may become prevalent. Certain military aircraft like the F-16 are actually so unstable that humans can’t fly them unassisted. Their inputs are simply feeding the avionics information about what they want to happen. This will probably happen in commercial aircraft as well. If this does happen, the software can never be disabled (since you physically won’t be able to fly the plane), but planes may end up being safer because of it (F-16s, I believe, can detect pilot loss of conscious and automatically take over to maintain level flight)

MCAS is certainly not in the same league as the F-16 avionics, but my understanding is that, without it, the 737 MAX is somewhat strange to fly."

"Tesla doesn’t need Ford....they can just borrow or buy an F-150 with the 3.5L Ecoboost engine and conduct the test on their own.

They could get real life long Ford owners to bring their trucks and turn it into one of those stupid commercials where everyone is surprised at how great the Cybertruck is."
Just do it without them with all the versions from cheapest to most expensive F150?
"Ford should just bring out the F-150 electric prototype that they showed pulling 1 million pounds of weight. Electric prototype vs electric prototype makes it a fair fight in terms of weight and instant torque.

Anyways, Elon has said they will be doing tug of war next week so it doesn't matter if Ford is pulling out of this contest"
"'its just a prank bro"""
"Well, there are many F-150s Tesla can use without Ford's cooperation, but there's only one Cybertruck 😉

Pretty easy for Tesla to do the test ""properly"", regardless of Ford."
Just like ford towing the train really
"Ford is such a nice company, using their marketing might to help Tesla's effort."
This just reminds me of [Internet fights](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/224/955/72f.gif).
Apparently this guy missed the Nurburgring debacle. One does not simply enter into a dick measuring contest with Elon Musk.
"I love  Tesla, and think Tesla would win a fair test, but it is a little annoying that they paired their AWD truck against a RWD truck with an empty bed.  Tesla fans would be FLIPPING OUT if Ford used a 4wd truck with weight in the back, and towed a RWD Tesla that didn't have enough traction to use it's torque and power.    


So yeah, I do think the Tesla  is better and can win a fair match, but they test they showed us was kind of dumb."
"Really, the next one tesla should do is the same test, but with the beds full of apples."

What a world we are living in. Really puts into perspective the difference in sizes of these companies when a spokeswoman has to clarify a VP's tweet against the outlandish CEO of an EV company who wants to tow their product up a hill with his new tank-trunk
chickens lol
"Anyone who makes a legacy ICE pickup and comments on the Cybertruck is nuts.   They are playing with fire when it compares to specs.

They are better off burying their heads in the sands and pretending it doesn't exist.  Too bad Ford already failed with that with their tweets.   Tesla gets even more free marketing and attention for the Cybertruck."
Raptor vs Cybertruck sounds like an awesomely terrible 80's movie. They really should test that one out.
LOL. Just wait until next week when Elon takes on Neil deGrasse Tyson's challenge to pull a fully loaded 4x4 F-150. Neil was very adamant about how much weight is on the wheels. I don't think Neil and Ford realize how much low end torque the Cybertruck really has.
"Reading on comments on articles surrounding this on Facebook is absurd. it is incredible how blind people are to Electric vehicles and their benefits. 

My favorite was the guy saying he can drive his 32 gallon Ford F150 everyday with 15k load over a 1000 miles and does it everyday. 

I politely asked him what roads he drives, because I would not want to be on any road with an significantly over-loaded truck that has a driver who drives over 12 hours at 80mph every day. 

His comment had a 1000 likes. Apparently there are 1000's of people driving 1000's of miles per day. Who knew. My dad was a semi driver for 20 years and he never once got near that. Amazing. Must suck getting an oil change every week."
They have fallen in the trap with both the feets...
"The paraphrased quote in the InsideEVs article doesn't contain an actual source, nor does it firmly confirm that Ford backed down. I realize if accurate, that might be the most we hear from Ford, but I'm just curious, has anyone else seen other confirmation of Ford retreating from this contest?"
Maybe Top Gear can perform this test
I think tesla should get two F150s loaf up the Cybertruck to the same weight and drag them both up the hill.
"ITT:

A bunch of butt-hurt F-150 owners. 

And yes. I own one. Cybertruck is going to murder all traditional pickups in this test because it’s electric. Get over it."
Nothing stopping Tesla from going to a dealership and buying one. I'd like to see Cybertruck against a Raptor and the best version of the F150 they can get.
"Wait... they refuse to compete with Tesla after they said they would, and they seem to feel they have the right to call the Tesla video absurd but won't defend their claim by sticking to what they said in the first place to prove it. Stupid."
Frankly a better head to head would be cyber truck vs f150 head on collision.
"That video was a stunt for Tesla. It doesn't prove anything except that their cybertruck is heavy. 

[Here's](https://youtu.be/jzKCJsou10w) the complete explanation.

I'm a fan of Tesla btw, would trade my pickup anytime.

Edit : thank you kind stranger for that silver! The first time is always special..."
Considering the weight of the batteries and the ridiculous torque created by electric motors I dont think anyone seriously thinks a F-150 would hold a candle to an electric vehicle. I would imagine a Model S would drag an F-150 around as well.
"""IT WAS JUST A PRANK BRO"""
"Ford should have just started out of it, there is no winning for Ford anymore at this point."
apples to apples better mean they compare trucks that COST THE SAME. I don't give a shit if a $60k truck outperforms a $40k truck for example.

Model 3 vs. F150.

Keep doing it until the Ford wins. I bet that the X, and possibly the S, would beat the Ford. Then Elon could tweet something to the effect of: ""our cars are as tough as your truck""."
"A $40 F-150 won’t compete with a Tesla. Actually, not at all. None of them.

Tesla has 100% torque at 0RPM. An ICE cant compete in a tug of war. Maybe Fords prototype electric truck can knock the pants off the Cybertruck, but that only helps Elon Musk and Tesla. Musk wants to world to see electric as superior and doesn’t care whose electric car is better. Tesla is synonymous with electric car right now and anyone who does good with electric also helps Tesla’s reputation for the foreseeable future. I’m sure at some point that will cease to be the case but Tesla is becoming the Kleenex of electric cars to the average joe."

"I'm reasonably certain Musk did this specifically to get a rise out of Ford, knowing full well that his truck would likely manhandle even an F-250 - or maybe an F-350. Not sure about if they're duallies though."
"I think most people here don’t realize how much of an advantage weight makes in these tug of war tests. Just because the Tesla can drag the f150 doesn’t mean it’s the better row vehicle. 

It’s good fun and marketing but doesn’t really translate to real world use."
"I'm late the the game here and this will get buried but Engineering Explained had a good video regarding this:   

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzKCJsou10w

It's essentially a joke of a test.  It's not so much a function of the Cybertruck's electric motors and torque production as it is the weight over the drive wheels."
Other automakers *still* don't understand the game they find themselves playing.
"Why do freight trains use electric motors to pull freight cars and diesel engines to generate the electricity?

If you anchor the F150, the CyberTruck can rip the tow hitch off that truck and damage it's own chassis In the process."
I bet you the Ford PR team scrambling in the office right now. They probably don't want Ford owners see the video of Cybertruck beating their Truck let alone Ford admitting Cybertruck will break the F150.
"This comment will probably get buried, but it seems not a lot of users here understand the physics behind the towing competition. [Engineering Explained released a video on this very topic recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzKCJsou10w).

The gist of it is, for the tow competition to be ""apple to apples"", both vehicles should have the same weight and the same tires (at least the same tire compound). While electric motors are touted to produce more torque, it is ultimately how much of that torque can be applied to the ground and propel the vehicle forward that matters in the context of this competition. 

>Maximum static friction force = friction coefficient (of the tires) * weight over driven-wheels

If you put the same tires and motors in a semi truck and an F1 car, the semi truck will be the undisputed winner of a tow competition between them, simply because the truck is much heavier and will thus have higher maximum static friction force, allowing it put more torque to the ground (without spinning out the tires)."
"Does everyone forget that Ford has an Electric F-150 Prototype? Hence the tweet saying “Apples to Apples”? 

Ford knows if they go toe to toe with an ICE F-150 they’re going to lose. Even with the top of the line 5.0 FX4 with both axles locked."
Ford look weak here.
I just wish when they had the cameras out - they would have gotten some sweet shots of Downhill Skateborders since this is a favorite spot called ‘Tuna’.
Elon : I blew up my own rocket in a pressure test! Come at me bro
[here's why the tow video was pointless](https://youtu.be/jzKCJsou10w)
These tug of war videos are absolutely pointless and is a test of nothing more than tires and driver skill. A civic with sticky ass racing tires and a good driver would probably drag the f150 too.  Turn on traction control  and put the same size and brand tires on both trucks and try this again
"CALL THE SEC: FORD VP MADE PROMISE HE DID NOT INTEND TO KEEP

/s"
"This type of test is actually stupid. It makes sense only if both vehicles have 100 percent traction. 

Otherwise its just a tire competition which no one really cares.  This type of bro competition ignores important variables like tow rope angle angle and tire type. Its cheap entertainment. 

Both trucks have enough torque to break tire traction. A real test would be to somehow lock the tires into a track of some type that did not allow wheel spin. Then see which vehicle breaks or give first."
"Dear Mouth, 

Please stop writing checks that I can’t cash. 

Sincerely,
Your Ass"
That’s pretty embarrassing on Ford’s part.
"The same as with Porsche. As soon as Tesla took a prototype to the Nurburgring and achieved a much better lap time, Porsche said they never intended to challenge Tesla 😅"
More like foot-in-mouth
Wheres the “f150 owner” douche on Twitter?  Someone go rub this in his face.  Hate that guy
"Well if they submitted both trucks to a full battery of tests, using a random selection of current pickup truck owners, that would be interesting. Basically what’s going to happen on YouTube once it comes out."
"IT WAS A PRANK, BRO!"
It seems more and more Tesla intentionally did this knowing the response they will get from Ford and  Interwebs.  Tesla probably has done tests already with 4WD F150s (even F250s) with bigger engines and knows CT can't be beat in a tug of war.
/r/oopsdidntmeanto
"Admittedly, it would be fun to see the Cybertruck up against something like the F-450 with that big diesel V8 that Ford do.  Stick some knobbly tyres on it and see it lose anyway."
"This was just good fun.  And really I read ""Apples to apples"" as maybe they're going to compare their F-150 Electric prototype???  Which would be rad.  Anyway Ford's PR didn't need to get involved here.  Ah well."
"""It wasn't fair because our comparably priced truck dosen't come with 4x4, and has shitty factory tires. Let us install $20,000 more upgrades, then we'll see who is who"""
"Noooo! I still want the ""fair"" fight! I feel like I'm the only one on this sub that has an issue with Tesla making that video further skewed. Even if the F-150 loses either way, it's important that it's a fair fight. It's like if you had a boxing match and one boxer was already clearly going to win but you still have him weighted gloves or something. It takes away from the achievement. Imagine if Tesla said okay, we'll give the F-150 really nice tires, a weighted back, the top end engine option (maybe even an F-250), slope advantage, etc. and the Ford still lost. It would really be a cool comparison."
Ford vs Tesla - Le Mans 2019
"If someone told me, some 15 years ago, that there will be a new american car manufacturer, that will make an electric truck... faster than Porsche 911... And that there will be a debate if Ford's best selling truck has matching specs...  
  
... I would loose the interest in listening the end of the sentence. It wouldn't make sense at all. Like saying ""in 15 years you will live on the surface of the Sun"""
"I just want to point out that this tow test is useless. All it tells us is that the Tesla weight times the tires coefficient of friction is higher. The friction coefficient of the tires are pretty similar, so this test just tells us that the Tesla is heavier."
"Towing each other looks cool, but really proves nothing, something like tires is likely what makes the winner, or weight, heck if one is attached higher than the other, the higher one will win"
Doesnt really count if the truck starts moving before resisting. But okoe
"If Ford is going to chicken out, the Elon should host a king of the mountain tug-o-war competition where all the bros can bring their brodozers and try their hand against the cybertruck and go until the cybertruck breaks or they run out of daylight or challengers."
I don't like Ford. But that tow video was pretty rigged
Ford activated Teslas trap card then....ho ho ho heeeeeyyyyy it's just a prank bro! They know apples to apples the Tesla will still handily beat anything they've got in each range.
"Tbh it was a dumb video. It wasnt equal comparison at all. One obviously was only 2wd, while the other had awd. Plus, they picked a weak engine on the ford. Should have done a diesel instead. But the diesel would have walked all over the tesla. So, what do?"
If you're scared say you're scared.
"I’m sure this has been said, but I couldn’t find it...won’t the heavier vehicle always win in a tug of war, assuming the tires are similar and both have enough power to turn the wheels (and both are driven by the same number of wheels)? They may as well just weigh the trucks at that point, I feel like?"
"I know it's a different kind of demonstration but we've seen what the Semi can do as far as acceleration and pull. No diesel truck can come close to that pound for pound. 

Ford didn't want to get swung on!"
I want to see a F-350 superduty tow it sideways. Uphill. These publicity stunts are to show off your product. Not apples to apples comparisons.
That's what I call bitch talk.
"Reading over all the posts regarding NDT, Ford,  Elon etc. Its obvious, Elon is a freaking genius. There no way I would have otherwise read a thread about a ford vs gm truck pull demo or any other pair of legacy old school trucks because I simply couldn't care less. Before the unveiling I finally decided I wanted to go back to owning a truck, my last was a Chevy s10 1990. After watching the CT reveal, I must have been the 100th or so preorder after going thru several ""guru meditation"" errors as the preorder site crashed over and over. Time to look to the future, those legacy trucks still serve some purpose over the CT. Elon, Let's GO!!!!!"
"Tug-of-war between 2 vehicles is stupid because it isn't the ""more powerful"" one that win, it's the one that keeps traction longer. In fact a more powerful vehicle is more likely to loose as it has a higher chance of spinning the tires. All it takes is just a tiny bit if traction loss to immediately allow the other vehicle to start pulling away. 

I would 100% expect the Tesla to win vs ANY current production pickup truck, because they don't have traction control and the Tesla has some of the most advanced computer controlled torque in existence."
I’m guessing a Model X would still beat a F-150
Do they not understand the amount of torque electric motors are capable of out putting? Ford should make their own electric truck
Do it anyway but get a third party to test it! All scientific!

"Can someone please do a picture of a blue Ford oval but it doesnt say Ford inside it says ""Chicken"" instead?"
I have a 3.5 L EcoBoost four-wheel drive F-150 if they want one for testing I'll trade it for a new cybertruck
"A Ford-bro friend of mine is trying to convince others that Tesla is being disingenuous with their F-150 comparisons because the Cybertruck’s capabilities are more in line with a high end F-250.

I imagine we’ll see bigger truck pulls against the Cybertruck soon enough, but until then, I think the F-250 argument is weak. There’s a market for very capable trucks that dont run on diesel or have restrictive gear ratios. Not every truck needs to be driven across the continent with multiple drivers with quick refueling."
Absurd? A couple months ago ford demonstrated the electric F-150 pulling 1 Million lbs on a rail car. With a rolling efficiency of 0.001 - 0.002 for a steel wheel on a steel track the truck exerted 1000-2000 lbs of force. Quit your bullshit.
"So basically Ford just admitted that their truck is inferior.  Because it really is... 

The Cybertruck seems like a “buy it for life” purchase. A vehicle that doesn’t scratch or dent, that offers a level of utility to meet all needs, and out performs competing vehicles in different form factors is like the Superman of cars.

All truck owners should be hopping on the Cybertruck like crazy."
"the amount of haters in this thread leveling insults at elon, insulting the PROTOTYPE cybertruck... it is laughable. standing the way of direct innovation is like standing in front of a freight train.

just laughable. the cybertruck is a good product, period. if you want to say it looks ugly-- cool, but many people are coming around to it now that they have had time to digest."

Uh huh...
"But once the ford's traction is Broken, it's game over. When the football team pulled some v12 monster across the pitch, Clarkson pinned the throttle but the footballers won with ease. If the Tesla would have broken traction first, it would have been walked by the 150."
Suuuuuuuuuurrrrrreeeeeeeeee WINK WINK
Why did they have the f150 in RWD?
Yeah that was included in the diesel scandal and they had to fix things they still got away with making remarkable profits by lying and cheating. They only fixed because they got caught. And I’ve owned VW diesel‘s Chevy diesel‘s as well as gasoline and as much is diesel is better than gas for torque and low-end power TVs better than both.

I love Tesla
"He has a point. The F150 used was not a fair comparison to that of the dual-motor Cybertruck. Not that I think it will matter much, but there are fair criticisms. 

1. Need to use a higher-end F150.
2. Need to have both in AWD.
3. Have tight band and then countdown."
Pussies
Isn't this effectively a test of the traction control systems instead of a test of towing capacity?
But isn't the Cybertruck heavier than the F-150?
Engineering Explained has a good video about it.
"Ford ""we were just kidding, gg"""
"I don’t know it’s already been said, as there are a lot of comments,  but while it’s a fun video, a tug of war doesn’t really mean much. Tug competitions aren’t about power, just traction and the heavier vehicle almost always wins. But it’s good marketing!"

It looks like the pinewood derby I made... even the paint job is silver.
"Smoked the meth, then did the math."
What does the Tesla weigh compared to the f150?!?
Shook ones
"To be brutally honest, and I love my f150, even with 4wd on it’s going to come down to a factor of weight for traction and torque which I think the Tesla will have both over the ford."
"Idk why they specifically chose only the f150, but for me they should do a test on other similar vehicles of other brands"
I like this angle of the truck...
Kind of a weak move :))
Not nearly as absurd as “towing” a locomotive container on steel rails with steel wheels on flat ground.
"Dacia would have smashed them both, for realz."
this will be more of a test of grip also. the tesla does not have a very impressive towing capacity but it does have stupidly better acceleration. it might in tug of war because of that

Tow an f150 and race an f150. https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e20uqu/in_2016_a_model_x_beat_an_alfa_romeo_4c_spider_in/
"That's cute, he had to have a girl to defend him. Couldn't even respond himself"
This can never be a fair duel due to the fact that the Ford has to shift gears.
They aren’t using 4x4. You can clearly see that only the rear wheels are spinning.
"Sweet, sign me up for a Tesla truck so I can stop towing my boat all around WI with my Silverado and instead challenge all of my neighbors to tug of war! ... wait"
🐔
I wanna see this test with the F150 loaded to the same weight as the Cybertruck.

Wouldn't the $70K tri-motor drag a $80K F-350 DRW 6.7 4x4?  I'd love to see that match up.  The F-150 has no chance.
"I wonder if anyone preordered in hopes to get a gift. Tesla gave a gift to everyone who preordered a 3. That said, the 3s were 1K to preorder and were ordered sight unseen."
Elon is the wrong person to joke with. He literally sent a $250k car into space. For fun. 😂😂😂😂
"> Ford spokesperson: Madra’s tweet ‘was tongue-in-cheek’ and meant **to point out the absurdity of Tesla’s tow video.**”

Ford: ""Let's have a fair tow contest! Oh wait, we can't win. Just joking.""

Ford realized even with a contest on ""fair"" terms, they would still lose, which just reinforces Elon's point."
"Ford should never have responded.  Of course the cybertruck would win, it weighs twice what an F150 does.  Nothing else matters."
Can someone tell an idiot like me why people think the cyber truck pulling the ford wasn’t a real test. I don’t get it
"This is just so fucking stupid.  Pulling power like this means nothing compared to many other factors involved in towing a trailer.  Of course you want a lot of power to pull with and in that category the cybertruck would likely prevail. BUTTTTTTT now say you have to tow 10,000lbs 400miles. Will the cybertruck still be the best option?  Me personally, for the same price, would prefer a 2500 with a diesel motor.  No charging, more reliable, if it breaks I have dealers all across the country to bring it in to, local mechanics can work on it, I don't get laughed at and ridiculed for my hideous yuppytruck, and it is built for heavy duty use."
I would love to see the Cybertruck go up against every truck in their lineup
This subreddit is slowly going downhill.
Why did it have to be so fucking ugly though
"Wait, just saw the video.  Obviously the Tesla will win.  The Ford with an empty bed has very little weight over the drive wheels. It has not traction."
"I pre-ordered mine. Dual Motor with Self Driving. Going to prob end up being $60K. With a $10K or so trade-in and maybe another $10K on top of that, I'm looking at $40K over 60 months. Looking at around $700/month. I might be canceling my pre-order in 2 years if my financial situation doesn't change. That's just too much for a car payment in my opinion. $550 would be my absolute max to comfortably do it. People don't actually pay that much on a car payment do they?"
"As Doug Demuro correctly pointed out, the price point the Tesla Cybertruck sells at makes it a more direct competitor to the heavier duty pickup trucks.  Meaning a more ""fair"" test would be the equivalent priced pickup, which would mean a tow match against one of the F-250's (or Chevy 2500), of which I don't know that tesla would get the results it's looking for.  The real advantage the Tesla has in the test against the F-150 is weight."
"**When F-150 loses**  
Ford exec got upset like teenagers got tagged on social media. Ends up losing 50k orders.

**When Cybertruck loses**   
Elon turns into the god of meme and creates marketing materials from thin air. Adds another 100k pre-orders."
"IMO this ""test"" was dumb to begin with. Smoking tires = traction-limited not torque-limited. Ford could manipulate the same test to go the other direction by throwing some lead ballast in the bed of the F-150 along with some slicks.

EDIT: FYI, https://youtu.be/jzKCJsou10w"
Ford marketing people realized that this would be free marketing for Tesla hahaha.
"I am interested in what their idea of apples-to-apples is. Is it a fully loaded Raptor or Limited AWD with their best engine, aftermarket wheels, and an extra thousand pounds of weight in the bed which would blow up the cost? Sure, lets put a +$70k truck against a $50k truck and see who wins."
As many people have stated the real challenge would be EV F150 vs cybertruck. In this kind of challenge EV has the upper hand over ice vehicles so why bother. Also Ford doesn’t have to beat Tesla they have more to offer as far as customer service brand name reliability. Ford just has to offer something that is close and competitive not necessarily better it’s about retaining market share at this point.
The only way Ford could possibly win is if they had a locked diff between the left and right wheels and pulled when 1/2 the road was covered in ice.
My wife pointed out. Ford is just salty they missed out on some cool towing opportunities. Like when Toyota towed the space shuttle in 2011 or 2012.
"So Tesla Pitted their all wheel drive heavy “truck” against one of the weakest lowest traction models of Ford Trucks and celebrates. Lol, skew the odds in your favor much?"
"I wish I could understand what Ford was thinking with this challenge. I would absolutely take any F150 ever built over a Cybertruck, but even as biased as I am against Elon's abomination I have to admit that this was a stupid move on their part. Yes Elon's ""test"" was unfair, but surely Ford knows that they would almost certainly lose vs the Cybertruck regardless of which model F150 was used. Now challenge it to a 2,000 mile road course or a contest to see how many people can look at each truck without vomiting and Ford would probably come out ahead."
"Am I the only one that would rather have an EV Ford F-150 than this monstrosity?  I feel like the Tesla community have gone insane with their praise of this ""truck.""  I get wanting to support Tesla but this ""truck"" looks like shit."
"Just as I said earlier, the guy just works at Ford, not part of executive or corporate Ford, and will get censured for an Ethics and Compliance violation. Why did Elon even respond/get trolled?"
I don’t care if that Tesla truck could tow a thousand F-150’s at the same time. I wouldn’t drive that truck if someone gave it to me for free. Its the dumbest looking automobile ever created. Homer Simpson’s car design is better than that thing.
Pussies
hahaha suck it Ford
[deleted]
"Typically electric motors produce buttloads of torque, WAY more than internal combustion engines. This is probably not a fight Ford wants to pick."
"They’ve done the math, and feel there’s a significant likelihood that it would not flatter the F150, even with 4WD and their top engine option.

There’s no upside for them to officially sanction a test that will show their product as inferior."
"Ford “fight me IRL bro!”

Elon “when and where?”

Ford “lol nahh bro I’m busy af”"
"It’s a prank, bro!"
"Its such a cop out by the ford CEO. 

After realizing his mistake he falls back on the ole jk jk defense like everyone hasn't been doing that for forever to cover their screw up."
"To be fair most random VP's at Ford (this guy Madra seems to run their startup accelerator? or something?) probably don't have the authority to actually set up and challenge another mfg to a very public test such as this, so PR going ""omg"" and backpedaling fast seems pretty par for the course for any business."
Elon should propose pulling a 1M lb train with CybrTrk at one end and Ford 4WD truck at the other end.  Ford's other gimmick will get exposed.
"It was just a prank, bro!"
Ford got punked
I still want to see him pull it against a 4x4 Ford F-150 or a diesel competitor.
"“That wasn’t me, it was my friend messing with my phone”"
pedaling back now that the opposition clearly said come on lets see what you got then --- cowards lol
I’m sure with the torque of electric motors the Tesla would still win but that demo Elon showed the other day was bullshit.  The F-150 didn’t even start trying to pull until it was already being pulled backwards.
Maybe Ford meant Tesla and Rivian are more apples to apples?
"Jesus Christ, How blind are the fanboys on here. I knew it was a Tesla circlejerk here but I had no idea it was this bad. 

Could you imagine if ford decided to use a 4x4 F-150 to tow a RWD cybertruck while starting the towing In the F-150 first? 

This sub would implode with crying and complaining. 

But when when Lord Elon does it, you guys swallow that Kool aid right away."
I would watch that commercial joyously.
"REAL PEOPLE, NOT ACTORS"
"That would actually be a great set up. 

Have a few “courses” laid out. 

Towing up hill

Filling up the vehicle 

Parking in a mall parking lot 

Off road driving (packed road)

Off road driving (extreme terrain sand, mud, snow) 
Etc...

Then a potential buyer brings their truck chooses the course and they do it in their current truck and then on a cyber truck. 

Let the truck sell itself."
Tesla probably already has a top of the line awd f150. Looking at your competition is pretty standard when designing a new product.
"Yeah, it's not like the point is that Tesla already conducted a test that's meaningless? Let's do another!"
I was about to respond and say why not make it more fair and use the 5 liter V8. But then I looked it up and that's actually less horsepower. Crazy what Ford can do with those Ecoboost engines
">They could get real life long Ford owners to bring their trucks

I would absolutely let them use my F150."
Or they could just put identical tires with the same contact patch on both vehicles and show how it would break down to a 50/50 on which vehicle broke traction first.
Truck pulls happen every day!
I would love a stupid YouTube upload about that .. but I don't want Tesla wasting money on advertising .. let the danknes be the advertising.
"Heck, I'd go for it.  I own an F150 Ecoboost 3.5L.  There are any number of comparison tests I'd be happy to take it up against a cybertruck."
ford owners will not buy that ugly truck. the cyber truck is going to fall flat. its absolutely awful looking.
Let's just note how Tesla has never aired a commercial and still can't build their products fast enough.
They really should make a mocking Chevy “real people” ad.
3.5L vs an electric truck is stupid though. Compare it to their electric F150 and now we are talking. A massively heavier truck with better weight distribution and more torque compared to the low end of a small motor is like me chaining my 4x4 truck to a Honda Civic and dragging it around. It’s nothing to brag about.
They don’t do commercials
Tesla making a commercial would be weird
I thought ford wanted to challenge them with their electric million puns train tow?
You probably will see people doing these competitions in a few years once Tesla’s start making them. I know plenty guys where I grew up always like showing off their trucks
How many F150s do we need to link together to overwhelm the Cybertruck?
"Man i wish elon did this!
And livestream it.

Tesla needs to go aggressive and character assasinate ford."
It's a pretty stupid fucking test to compare this wildly overpriced truck to a practical F-150. Imagine if they adjusted for cost. I doubt a cybertruck could outpull 15 F-150s
At the same time
I believe Musk said they would do it next week
Prob just start with the cheapest to replenish EMs net worth a little.
"Do the same tire sizes as well, although weight and 2wd / 4wd play a factor as well."
"They should see at what point a ford truck can beat the Tesla, for example does it take a 6.7 diesel dually 1 ton?"
And the 250. And the fucking 350. Fuck it do them all.
Proves nothing. The supercharged Ford would spin its tires and would provide little resistance as the Tesla's computer does 1000 calculations a second to keep traction while applying power.
"I believe this is what Tesla really wants. They want Ford, the sales leader in trucks, to go get their EV prototype for an “apples to apples” test, and in doing so concede that EV trucks are superior, making the rest of their “built ford tough” lineup look weak in comparison.

Edit:

Note it was a VP at Ford X that clapped back. I’m sure his division does have some tech that can go toe to toe. Apples to apples. But the rest of Ford doesn’t want what I mentioned above to happen, they don’t want the 1 million ICE trucks they sell per year to look inferior, so they’re back tracking.

This is why Tesla will win in the end."
"Or, what they should have done is, just ignore Tesla completely.

Ford is the heavy-weight champ of trucks -- they sell 900K F-series a year (according to Elon's tweet). If you're the champ, you don't accept (or even pay attention to) challenges from upstart contenders.

By responding to the provocation, Ford has put Tesla on (almost) equal footing and the rest of the competition (every other truck manufacturer on Earth) is bypassed. Which is exactly what Tesla wanted."
"That will be a blow to Ford if Tesla go ahead with the tug of war, openly,  anyway without Ford's participation. This PR nightmare may force the VP out of job."
"I would guess, that Tesla has run the math and knows that their cybertruck would beat anything Ford could throw against it. I wonder if they chose such a base model Ford truck in a trolling move? Maybe next we'll see a video of them doing it with a Raptor."
That publicity stunt by ford isn't impressive. Any average crossover could do the same thing.
Did Elon say whether the model presented was the 2-wheel drive or 4x4? Seems like the weight and torque give it a serious advantage over the F-150.
Btw that 1 million pounds video was not completely genuine. The friction between the weight and the tracks was reduced enough that almost any car could've pulled that weight.
Screw that. I want to see Ford do Electric F-150 vs ICE F-150. That’s the real question here.
"He may spread the rest of the unveil out over the next 2 years, hitting it with chainsaws, flamethrowers, everything they skipped after the glass.

And their  r&d team may be working on ""elon pride-repairing glass"" to replace the stuff they used at the unveil"
"How is the electric F150 able to tow 1 million pounds but the CyberTruck only 14,000?"
"Still pointless.  Ford is developing an actual truck for the road, so it won't be absurdly heavy.  The prototype cybertruck with 3mm stainless steel skin probably tips the scales north of 10K pounds.  It's going to have more traction, this is physics.  I still wouldn't want to drive around a 10000 lb vehicle as my daily driver."
Yeah I think the point it that they didn’t the first time.
Which was probably a response ('42' pickups) to the model X towing a plane.
Pulling isn’t towing
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP00VmKx_No

I don't think that I can pull a train. But it shouldn't be a big surprise that it can be done."
"Which debacle? Porsche did a good non official time with a pre-production vehicle that drove 1000 km the same day.

Tesla did a much faster lap with a full prototype non road legal vehicle."
"Mostly because he'll just get mad, throw a tantrum, and call you a pedo?"
Well Tesla still hasn’t posted an official time with an official car
"Yeah, because Musk cheats and lies, and all he has to do before his fans call something accomplished is tweet about doing it.  The cybertruck is a prototype he finished work on a couple weeks ago, not anything like something that will actually go into production, and we've got fanboys here talking about it like you can go buy one today.  No, you can put $100 down on a dream."
"Agreed. It's fair for people to call Tesla out on this ""test"" they did. I'm not a truck guy so I don't know what would be fair, but hell I can understand the argument that letting the Cybertruck pull the F-150 uphill puts the F-150 at a disadvantage by potentially lifting its rear axle and putting more weight on the rear axle of the Cybertruck.

Edit: I've seen people make the argument that the 2WD F-150s can pull more than the AWD though.

I don't understand the argument about the empty bed, assuming the Cybertruck one was empty as well. Of course we don't know the weight of the Cybertruck so..."
"Unreal that I had to scroll this far down. I’m sure we’re all here because we’re fanboys/girls but come on. First thing I noticed was the Tesla pulling the rope, it was basically dragging the Ford before it even touched the throttle. Terrible example of a fair fight. 

I would however be curious to see if they allowed the 3 motor Tesla against an F350 or any full size truck with 4x4 and weight in the bed (to possibly even out if the Tesla is heavier) 

At that point I think the Tesla’s torque, if mishandled by the awd system, would spin out just the same as the f150 did.


That said, I hate Ford and “grew up GM” for what it’s worth."
Almost seems like it was a ploy meant to get a reaction from ford. And they bit.
The test was meant to turn pretrol heads into EV lovers. Anyone paying attention knows electric would win. I'm sure if the ICE engine truck was better at pulling than the electric no one would be flipping their shit saying it was an unfair thing to do. Electric cars still have something to prove to everyone who is still a non believer and this is exactly that the test was for. It wasn't meant to turn u or me into Tesla fans. Not a dumb test at all imo.
"Agreed, I think these head to head towing contests are worthless. You can bias it in so many ways to favor whichever truck you want.

A much more meaning ""head to head"" test is simply to have each truck tow the exact same trailer. Use the trucks with default factory configuration (no customizations). Keep adding weight to the trailer until one of them can't tow it."
genius!
"towing range. a $50k F150 will be able to tow a good sized load for a long time and refuel in a couple minutes. that's what they can hang their hat on, even if it's 0.1% of uses of the truck"
"LOL, completely agree.  Some people just don't know when to keep it shut."
"They're better off not arguing against a guy who doesn't actually need to prove anything.  The cybertruck can have ""500 miles range"", because in reality the prototype probably has more like 20, but we promise we'll make a version in a few years with 500 miles.

So it's true that ford can't win here, they're going up against a guy who can just make up numbers and his fans will eat it up, and then totally forgive him later when he can't deliver on price or spec."
"Look, Cybertruck is still gonna win, but let's put some weight on the back wheels and give the Ford AWD to make it a more fair fight. NDT is right that RWD F150 didn't stand a chance the way the test was set up, the rear drive wheels had zero grip on comparison to the Tesla.

I actually think it would be fun to see the F150 AWD with a load in back attempt to pull the Cybertruck while it's in park, still think the Tesla might win 😂"
"I don't think people realize how much low end torque an F150 has, you're getting more than 30x torque multiplication through the torque converter, transmission and final drive, much more if you're using the low range gearbox. It 100% comes down to weight, or rather traction, but assuming the tires are reasonably close, weight on drive wheels is the most important factor, if you use a comparable F150 with 4x4 and locking diffs. Either truck easily has the torque to spin all 4 wheels, that's much less important for low speed towing than people think"
"I really dislike NDT, especially here. He has a science background and is speaking from a physics standpoint. But this is an engineering problem. I guarantee you NDT knows nothing about how traction control or motor torque curves work. I can't wait to see him eating humble pie after this next test."
It won’t matter. Any performance aspect of a vehicle is limited by the round things that touch the road surface. These tug of war tests are a test of nothing more than tires and the drivers reaction time. The Tesla has huge sticky tires and the ford doesn’t. If they put identical tires on both vehicles and somehow could actuate both throttles at the same time it would work
"Except the Cybertruck is priced against HD trucks. 

And we all know theres no way it could pull a new F250 powerstroke diesel 4x4.

For the money this thing cost it *better be able* to pull an F150."
"Facebook is a boomer website, that's why."
If he’s driving a 15k lb truck I hope he has a DOT number
Let him be stuck in his ways. Don't try to explain why a circle wheel is better. He's happier with a square one.
"Nope, we have to take InsideEVs word for it at this point."
"I don't know why anyone thought the company offered a contest in the first place. 


The guy at Ford who tweeted the challenge works at a venture capitalist subsidiary of Ford Mobility, which is itself a small subsidiary that provides financial assistance for adapting vehicles for wheelchair access and other disability needs.

This was not something that came from Ford overall, it was some random guy deep down in the hierarchy who has nothing to do with the F-150 platform."
"They'd stage the cybertruck ""running out of power"" halfway through the test."
Either the Cybertruck would break down before the test commences or the cybertruck would be 'locked' in two wheel drive. Top Gear would then comment that the 2017 Cybertruck had the best performance of all the cybertrucks they tested.
Hoo boy.
Yea that TOTALLY wouldn't get staged to make the Cybertruck look bad. Nope. Never.
Some say he sleeps with *both* eyes open....
"In *this* test, sure, but what a fucking dumb test of nothing"
Why stop at the 150?  Can’t it also beat the 350?
"For the price, it should be a 4x4 F250"
"I drive a Raptor, had a 1st Gen for years and have driven a 2nd Gen for 2 years now. Absolutley love them. But using one in a tug o war would be stupid. They aren't made for towing, at all. They'll do it, but not nearly as well as a regular truck will .


Now if they wanna use a Raptor to compare the offroad capabilities of the Cybertruck... I'd LOVE to see that."
Why do people keep mentioning the Raptor? It's a totally different kind of truck. That's like bringing a drag car to the Nurburgring.
"Thanks, this comment is way too far down on the list.

Short explanation of the video. The Tesla won since it was heavier and had force from 2 axels instead of 1. It's a stupid test, but apparently it worked since so few people in this thread have mechanical knowledge."
Lol so just add luxury options? That's going to help.
No one. Calls. Me. Chicken.
Not Vivaldi?  You're insane!
Tesla is American...
Tesla is American...
Ford’s diesels will easily outpull the Tesla.
Ayeeee
"Shhhhh.


You're right though, yes. The heavier truck will pull the lighter truck. Torque/tow figures are a tiny factor for the actual test."
But what do you test? Ford has vehicles that will tow way more than Tesla for less $$$. Basically any diesel in the F250-450 range.
"""high end"" doesn't really make it pull better."
What's the gvrw. That will determine its actual competition.
"The capabilities are nowhere near a high end F250. An F250 will pull 17,000lbs and an F350: 37,000lbs. For $65-70k.

Thats the problem; its *priced* like an F250, with the *capability* just slightly exceeding the F150.

Why pay F250/F350 prices for F150 capability?"
Perhaps it's the aesthetic design?
How do you know it's good? It's a prototype.
"No. 

The torque curve is too much of an advantage."
"Assuming a minimum amount of traction for each, what it really tests is the torque curve. Ie which one can start moving first."
...right to the VW shop where it spent half of it’s overly engineered life.
The one that wasn’t legal to sell in the US if they hadn’t lied about emissions.
He forgot to get his tweet cleared by his SEC minder first
"Agree on 1 and 2, but not having tight band is better for the F150. If the band has slack, it would allow the Ford to get its RPM up and get over the drivetrain slack before the band is taught. In effect neutralizing the EV instant torque."
"Nah it's a test of weight.

The heavier car will *always* pull the lighter car unless the two vehicles are power limited rather than traction limited, so >400tq~ in a dig.


Same reason why a Ford F150 would easily win this test against something like a LaFerrari despite having less than half as much torque."
"because the F150 has the highest towing capacity of any small truck.


The whole test is a joke though, since the 'winning' truck is just whichever one is heavier lol. Towing figures/torque/etc. don't actually matter at all in this sort of test.


It's a marketing gimmick, not consumer research or a review."
Some angles it looks cool and some angles it looks really bad to me. I personally dislike the side profile but like the front profile.
I think the Ford would have the advantage here because there's literally more traction to be utilized.
"I know, right? It looks so dowdy, ugly, and old fashioned next to the Cybertruck. ;)"
"The average car payment in America is $530 for new cars, so yes many people do it.  If you have the cash flow, go for it.  But if it's over 15% of your income, don't do it.  No car or house is worth being poor over.  I've been there, done that, got the poor credit!"
"Payment on my P3D is ~$1000.

Your financials are not everyone's financials."
What about a longer loan?  It is a new car with a warranty
Holy shit it’s almost like it’s marketing or something.
More like Ford technical staff informing them that this would be PR suicide.
How about “let’s put an AWD truck equipped with better tires and weighs more against a RWD with worse tires and weighs less!”
Then don’t buy it lol not that hard.
"A lot of people dislike the aethetetics of it, even a good number of the Tesla fan boys dislike it. Take a look at the number of people who prefer the looks of the Rivian truck."
"With the insanely low drag coefficient of the Tesla, I'd ditch my quad cab in a heartbeat If I were already planning on spending $60k (Jesus, that's a LOT of money to spend on one vehicle) on a truck."
"You aren’t the only one lots of people hate it. Personally I would never buy an F150 or any other current truck. They all look like dogshit designed to make insecure people feel tough. 

I really want a cyber truck."
VP isn't some lineworker.
"huh? Elon responded cause it looks great, easy free marketing. especially now with ford backing out"
"Why not? It is good PR, free marketing for Cyber truck. If this guy get canned, he has himself to blame. He is VP, responsible for his own actions."
Tethics.

Puppies?!?!?!
The risk is enormously high.  Ford would be humiliated if they staged a public test and lost.
I would think Tesla has done the math too and that’s why they chose to use the truck they did in the video.
"Yup.  I was really hopeful that they were stupid enough to go through the with it, but I knew this would be the outcome.

I could see Neil Tyson and Elon doing interviews playing the video and talking about the laws of Physics."
"Yeah, it’s a lose-lose at this point.  Ford could save face by putting their electric truck against Cybertruck, but they knew they would lose ICE vs Electric.

All Elon has to do now is go get the top of the line F-150 with 4WD, load with equal weight, and still pull it uphill.  AND now he gets to shit on Ford for backing out.

AND now he also gets to point out that Ford didn’t think their prototype could outdo Tesla’s prototype.

Win-win for Tesla"
This is hilarious. Elon wins again without having to lift a finger. He said “bring it on” and Ford backpeddled as fast as they could.
"You're right, and is all comes down to weight. Here is the perfect explanation.

https://youtu.be/jzKCJsou10w"
"I bet some Youtuber will do the test, someone like Engineering Explained."
It‘s a stupid test anyway. There are too many variables other than torque that affect the result.
Considering the cyber truck costs as much as a super duty they should compare those. Honestly curious how well it holds up to the diesel counter part
">There’s no upside for them to officially sanction a test that will show their product as inferior.

Just tow a large trailer with a load about 200 miles. I'm pretty sure that would tell you where the inferiority is. That would also be real world too."
"The upside is when they get to the F350 and still can't ""tow"" the Cyber, gas is dead.
[EDIT - If they do tow the Cyber, good, gas is not dead, yet.]"
"I don't know why they're comparing the Cybertruck to the base F-150.

\---

Cybertruck (base model): $40k; 7,500 lbs towing capacity

F-150 (w/5.0L V8 engine option): $31k; 8,000 lbs towing capacity

\--

Cybertruck (tri-motor model): $70k; 14,000+ lbs towing capacity

F-450 (6.7L PowerStroke V8 diesel): $50k; 24,200 lbs towing capacity

\--

Additionally, the F-450 has 6 wheels, which means extra traction. And its torque #s are almost identical to the top Cybertruck."
"Price wise it doesn't compete with the F150, it competes with the F250."
[deleted]
"I was actually wondering if they would try it with a Raptor or F650, lol"
"There's a lot more to towing than just how much pulling force you can apply. There's how well you can stop it, and how the vehicle behaves going down hills and around corners with weight behind it.

I think the best test would be a subjective one. Get a hundred or so impartial test drivers, match up each Tesla with a comparable priced Ford. Let each driver test both vehicles towing a variety of different trailers of different weights in different conditions, and see which one they prefer overall...

If preferences are split 50/50 or close, then they're probably pretty comprable, regardless of which one can actually apply more pulling force. If it's more like 70/30 or 80/20, then you can declare a winner, again, regardless of which one can actually apply more pulling force."
Flatter?
Couldn’t Tesla also easily turn up the torque a bit just for the test?  It seems so easy when they want a power increase-bam 10% more power earn a software update
"They scared, and stuck in the past."
"Who did the math? Tesla? Look at engineering explained video on youtube and tell me how it is fair. Even if the Tesla would win either way, the difference in the margin of said victory is important."
It has nothing to do with the engine or the transmission.  Everything there relied on the tires' friction coefficient and contact patch area.  Put some fat tires on the truck and skinny sedan tires on the tesla and the F150 will drag it around the parking lot.
"Honestly, I'd like to see a comparison against an F250, or and F350. Does electric instant-power beat an ICE vehicle that has ""superior"" power specs."
"They should take the test, and give them both the same weight. Ford should happily participate, maybe use an F350, and they should use that as a reason to go hard forward with their own electric projects. Until they get pickup drivers to see their diesel folly, they'll have a hard time succeeding"
I mean..they could just do the same thing Tesla did and make sure the F150 is moving forwards and the Tesla backwards before the Tesla disengages its brake and starts accelerating. Its almost guaranteed the F150 would win this way just like the Tesla won.
These ‘tests’ are stupid anyway. The results yield no useful conclusions. It’s gimmicky and no one but Elon and drunk rednecks do this with their trucks. .
F-150 doesn't make sense from a price standpoint though. An actual fair battle would be with an F-350 --> F-450 depending on the truck used.
"Musk should just do it himself. Get an F150, load it up and do the test."
Was the test not against a 4x4? Elon should have at least chosen a current model raptor.
Then they should throw steel balls at  each vehicle
"If you compare the top cybertruck option with the tri motor yes it's better than a f150 but for that price of 70k, your better of comparing it to an f250 with the 6.7 diesel that would be a better option, especially if the Cyber truck beat it."
Or Tesla's already done it behind closed doors
They fucked up if they think individuals or some company isn't going to eventually do this.
"The math won't work to Ford's favor because their trucks are lighter than the Cybertruck. The limit is their individual weights, which is why the Cybertruck made the RWD Ford look like a fool.  Both have enough torque, Tesla's just weighs more so it can exert a larger longitudinal force. Inferior is not being tested at all, only a neat trick. Put 1000lbs of dead weight in the Ford and it'll win."
"Electric motor have so much more torque at low RPM. Even if the ICE engine has a very high ratio  gearbox and differential the torque power loss is probably pretty high. Looking online (not always accurate) its 800-1000 lb-ft of torque Tesla to 510 lb-ft Ford. Now, go up against a F-350 and it may not be cut and dried. 

And yes it was a stunt. A successful one."
They could have put the diesel f450 out there and I still think the Tesla tri motor could pull it up hill
"This is not a test that determines which vehicle is better. This is a test which determines which vehicle is heavier. If tires are spinning on either vehicle, it's a flawed test. And considering that the Tesla has a much higher tow rating than the F-150, that means it's a significantly heavier truck. Not better."
Don't forget that the cyber truck is heavier.
"Ford shouldn't be putting ""their top engine"" option against the cybertruck anyway. The Apples to Apples comparison isn't possible until they have a prototype Electric F150 to put up.

And to be fair, unless their Electric F150 is less than $50,000, there's no dismissing that comparison as being unfair in any way.

Electric truck vs. Electric truck. That's the test.

Electric vs. Internal Combusion is a joke of a comparison.

IC engines develop torque.
Electric motors ARE torque."
"Big upside for Tesla though.

Do you reckon they could put 2 F150's against a CT, with weight added in the back so the weight is even between both sides?

That way, even if it's not sanctioned by ford, it's still pretty uncontroversial. If they could pull it off"
"It's has more to do with tires than anything. The F150 has no problems breaking traction on the stock tires, what it really would come down to is which truck had the most grip with their tires. Give them the same tires, and add some weight so they are equal, and you would have a very close competition."
"It's simple physics..  F=μN Cybertruck weight > F150 weight with all the options available, of course the Cybertruck will win, it weighs more.."
For curiosity's sake could i see the math?
I would expect the CyberTruck to dominate a conventional ICE truck anyway simply due to its (presumably) greater weight.
"In a drag-off, the Tesla would win. 

If we change that to conveniently towing a heavy load for long distances, as many folks do, the ford would win. 

This particular test would be bad for Ford, but a long distance haul would reflect well on them."
"Ford's CEO, James Hackett, never challenged Tesla.

The ""challenge"" was from a VP at Ford X. Ford X is a small subsidiary arm of Ford Mobility which is a small subsidiary of Ford focused on providing financial assistance to people needing to adapt vehicles for those with disabilities(ex: wheelchair access)

I doubt this guy has even met Ford's CEO, he is far down the chain."
"I take it that you’ve watched the video with the math?  Yeah, it would be pretty epic."
Or even a ford that starts pulling at the same time as the cybertruck not after its already moving backwards.

So would Mahk.
I feel bad for actors. Everyone seems to think they're not real people. Must think they're cyborgs or something.
[Zebra Corner ](https://youtu.be/I_wdo4ihcd8)
"That sounds like a great way to sell some trucks, even to EV doubters. 

I'd totally take my truck and do a course like that. Though the Cybertruck would definitely win cause I have a 15 year old compact truck. 

I mostly just want to drive that thing."
[deleted]
The standard is to completely dismantle and inspect every component of your competition. All the major automakers have labs dedicated to reverse engineering their competitors.
"AWD ≠ 4X4

There's literally a difference in how AWD & 4x4 performs especially offroading.

Driving on the street with 4x4 enabled is actually dangerous since the diff is locked, this can cause issues cornering & could steer you off the road this does not happen with AWD.

Anyways.. [Source 1](https://youtu.be/Jk246sutET0)

[Ford sells the top trim F-150 as 4x4 not AWD](https://www.ford.com/trucks/f150/models/f150-raptor/), there is a difference, especially for those that needs trucks."
[deleted]
"From Ford's website, ""The 3.5L EcoBoost® with 10-speed transmission boasts impressive power ratings of 375 horsepower and 470 lb.-ft. of torque."" and then, ""This legendary Ford V8 with 10-speed transmission delivers all the muscle you need available best-in-class* payload. Experience robust 395 horsepower and 400 lb.-ft. of torque""

So it looks like the V6 is more torque, but V8 more horsepower.

**Edit: Then they should put the Tri-Motor Cybertruck against the more expensive diesel Ford trucks. ""The available 6.7L Power Stroke® V8 Turbo Diesel is upgraded for 2020. Which means 475 hp and 1,050 lbs.-ft. of torque."""
"how many bumper stickers do you have?

did you wrap it?

:P"
"Pretty sure the Tesla is weighted better, and will win every time because it's got more weight rear. It will take a much bigger truck to overcome this deficit, and in that case, you could probably just drop a block of something heavy in the bed and the Tesla would go back to dominating, meanwhile, the ICE truck is damaging it's transmission."
"What??

Wildly overpriced? Have you seen the price of an F-150 these days?

I doubt any vehicle could outpull 15 other vehicles. What does this prove?

I agree though. It’s a stupid test. Electric motors will always have mustang torque to defeat an ICE. 

And yes. I own an F-150."
"It could be made into a spectacle. They could also use 3 Tesla prototypes for all their versions. For a week they could release a video of each truck pairing against all the competition. Do most wins out of 5 or something, this sounds like an American type of entertainment.

Edit: In case it's not clear I mean 1 vs 1 but all 3 versions of range and performance vs all XYZ versions from Ford. So if they bring 3 Ford F150 versions from RWD to AWD, to top engine spec AWD, there would be 3 x 3 = 9 combinations, each one with most wins out of several runs."
It's a real shame Tesla doesn't do advertising. I'd chip in for a superbowl commercial with the cybertruck pulling every f150 variant at the same time lol
"It's noteworthy that it's the guy from Ford's Silicon Valley-style department doing this and then old-school side of the company stepped in and said no. 

Symbolic."
what if using the basic 2x4 f150 model was to trigger Ford and create a big free (almost) advertise for the cybertruck !
"Even now, Ford and GM can't commit to the future. We've got less than 10 years left of new ICE cars being manufactured."
They’re not going to do it because they leave this kind of dick measuring to rednecks on YouTube. Go search Ford vs Chevy tug of war. There’s hundreds of videos infested with idiot commenters talking shit to each other.
The Ford electric vehicle? You mean the Rivian prototype with Ford Body panels?
"Do you really think that Tesla will replace Ford as ""the"" truck company?"
You have no idea what you're talking about do you
"If they brought out their electric F150, admitting electric > ICE, and then *lost* to the cybertruck ..."
"Ford v Tesla



Starring a fatter Christian Bale and Jesse Plemons"
"Didn’t ford start the provocation, not the one responding?"
VPs fail upwards
"> This PR nightmare may force the VP out of job.

Yessssssssssss

Sweet schadenfreude"
But where would they ever be able to come to find a Ford truck to test on if Ford doesn't provide one? /s
This. Tesla probably did tests against Ford trucks with bigger engines.
"I’m not a car/truck guy so forgive me if this is a dumb question, do the Raptors have a supercharger? 

I don’t think there is any ICE vehicle except for like a semi truck (due to mass) that would beat the cybertruck in a tug of war just because of the torque curve of electric motors 

Maybe a supercharger would balance the scales? Or if the ICE truck was able to get a head start it might win when they’re both redlining 

A better play would be ford mentioning what I’ve read other truck guys/girls talking about which is the design of the walls of the cybertruck bed making it so that the really heavy trailers won’t be able to attach to it, because it requires something to go over the top of the bed? Again, not a truck person so have no idea if this is true or not."
"Id like to see a tug of war vs a diesel, diesels are made to tow and can tow upwards of 30,000lbs now. Now if they could take out a f-350 that is something I would be impressed by"
.
TBF at $39k the cybertruck’s direct competition would be a base model fleet truck. It’s insane what they get for those fucking things.
Towing capacity has little to do with max pulling force. It's more a question of trailer stability and breaking capacity.
"To add onto the other response, the train was on tracks. The truck only needed to slowly apply enough force to break friction, and then the train would be much easier to move."
"> How is the electric F150 able to tow 1 million pounds but the CyberTruck only 14,000?

Towing something doesn't JUST mean that you can pull it. It also means, for example, that the tow vehicle can engage in normally expected driving maneuvers, such as accident avoidance swerves, and safely stop the load as well.

The electric F150 would be completely unable to stop the rail cars using only its own braking system.

It was a pulling ""test"" only, and a rigged one at that, since it's easier due to the physics involved to pull rail cars on a rail than it is to pull something with rubber tires on asphalt. (About 10 times easier, according to the linked video) [Here](https://youtu.be/Au3U72CX74I) is a video that explains it a bit more in detail."
Because it has to be able to stop.
"It could. A Model X towed a fucking plane, the Cyber is even more powerful"
"It was on train tracks, they are designed to minimise friction. [This man pulled 297.1 metric tons (600k pounds) of a train with his teeth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTeb19ICMD4) Ford's test was a publicity stunt which got them a lot of stick."
"Sure, for me Tesla's F-150-Cybertruck ""test"" has the same level of credibility as Top Gear/Fully charged their Taycan tests or Porsche's Nürburgring lap time: zero."
At least the plane didn't have metal wheels on metal rail.
Nearly every car maker has pulled a plane lol
"Only educated comment here. 
[perfect example](https://youtu.be/ZSGwkZ2NLw0) 

I really want to know if the cybertruck claims are SAE certified."
"Exactly. If Ford manages to beat the Cybertruck, Elon will just come back with a truck with rocket thrusters on it. He will never let anyone beat him publicly."
"How is it a non road legal vehicle? It hasn't hit production, but the same goes for the Porsche EV."
Was it full prototype? Thought it was a model S with a different drivetrain or the likes.
What was non road legal about the Plaid Model S they were testing? The tires (Pilot Sport Cup 2R) are road legal pretty sure. The wing wouldn't be illegal or anything...
Pretty much
"Neither has Porsche, the porsche lap wasn't an 'official' one as far as I know."
"Empty bed is relevant because the Ford is rwd. If the bed is empty, the weight is mostly on the front wheels (big heavy engine in the front), so it has no traction on the drive wheels.

Meanwhile, the Tesla is AWD, so it doesn't matter which wheels the weight is on"
"A 2wd has a higher towing capacity because the truck is lighter which means you can you a heavier trailer. It's not that it's any stronger or better, it's an overall vehicle weight."
"This article might help. If you cant be bothered to read just scroll down to the little gift with the remote controlled cars. The cyber truck is sure to weigh more.
 https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-cybertruck-vs-a-ford-f-150-its-all-about-friction/"
"Yeah, that'll be one of the issues at those power/torque levels.  It's going to come down to traction until a certain point....as each vehicle has plenty of power to break the tires loose, so it'll depend a lot on what tires they have and how much weight is on said tires.  You could have ten million horsepower and ten million ft-pounds of torque and still lose a tug of war if the other vehicle had more traction and all of your power is just uselessly spinning your tires.  


But yeah, I'm team Tesla all the way, but I'd rather see objectively fair tests rather than ""PR stunt"" type tests."
"You guys are complaining as if *any* F150 has any kind of chance against the Cybertruck.  It's laughable.  The competition was unfair the moment the F150 showed up.

It was a *joke* that none of you people seemed to get, because you haven't quite registered how inferior ICE trucks actually are yet."
Bingo
It was dumb....it was a test of how much weight was over the driven wheels.  Gas or electric was completely irrelevant to the test that was done.
"Yeah.  They could maybe do ""see which truck can tow this trailer up a hill faster""  or maybe even a quarter mile while towing a trailer or something.  That would have some merit and show power and towing capabilities.  

I guess the clip looked cool for the presentation, but any understanding of what's actually going on, and how the traction and physics of it work, it's a lot less impressive."
"Exactly, plus you could get an F-250 diesel with higher towing specs, more range, and buy it today for far less than the top spec Cybertruck.  

The Cybertruck is a very cool concept, but it isn’t a replacement just yet for the capabilities of ICE trucks you can buy right now.  I think it’s important to acknowledge the short coming of electric vehicles so people don’t buy into them blind thinking everything is roses, as that will do more harm for the image of them than anything. 

They will get there for sure, and thanks to vehicles like the Cybertruck and Whoever else makes one that day is coming along sooner and sooner."
It just seems like a really silly goalpost when the truck is better 99.9% of the time.
"since that happened with none of his other vehicles.  Good look selling your poorly researched info here.

500 mile range version is likely partially based on the plaid prototype model S that ran the Nurburgring since I believe that is also a three motor."
"People really underestimate modern transmissions. 1st gear is 4.69:1 which gets put through a 3.55:1 final drive for an effective ratio of 16.64:1, paired to a 470 lb ft of torque motor and you get 7,825 pounds of torque to the wheels in 1st gear. 

If you really wanted to compare torque, the $52k F-350 DRW AWD can be configured with the 6.7L diesel that makes 1,050 pounds of torque at 1,800 rpm with a 4.69 first gear and 4.1 final drive for a ratio of 19.29 for 20,190 pounds of torque to the wheels. 

Also people mention, “Electrics have instant torque!” But when it comes to something like a tug of war, so can ICE vehicles. Keep left foot on brake, slam gas pedal to the floor, revs rise to ~2k-2.5k rpm, once the slack is out slowly let off the brake and you have maximum torque to the wheels instantly without overwhelming them and spinning the tires. You use the brakes like you would a clutch on a manual to modulate tire spin on a launch.

Edit: F-450, $55k, 4 door with 6 seats, 8’ bed, same 6.7L diesel engine, same 4.69 1st gear but with a 4.3 final drive for a grand total of 21,175 pounds of torque to all 6 wheels."
"I love the response. ""Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation."""
"NDT is a science advocate, but Elon is a rockstar engineer - he has an electric car inside a rocket in space right now. 

NDT can’t just come in and scream “science!” And be the smartest guy in the room anymore. NDT is out of his league here. Tesla has immense talent and they are doing really incredible shit. NDT is the guy outside screaming about how much he understands the stuff in science textbooks and mocking you for not knowing it."
The dude is really full of himself. I hope someone can shove his words down his throat.
"I like NDT, but feel like sometimes he speaks before thinking (or tweets without reading) which leads to the criticism. Musk agreed with his first tweet and said they'd load it to the max, and his response was a rehash of his original, as if he glossed over the fact that Musk said load both to the max."
NDT backtracked already
That's how we astrophysicists roll
"It's stupid. The F150 could literally have gears for wheels connected to a track in the ground, but it will never make peak torque at idle."
"Autorotation, anyone?"
"It's not the first time he's saying something stupid or wrong. I don't know about this, but I wouldn't be surprised if he just wanted to show off.

That said the test was not really a test, so I hope they redo it and make it fair, just to make it fair - they should still win I guess."
">speaking from a physics standpoint. But this is an engineering problem.

Lol no. It's a simple physics problem. Torque is the roughly the same for an ICE truck in low gear and the Cyber""truck"". So the one with the most traction wins. Traction control os mostly irrelevant here. Everyone who claims this is an engineering problem is a dumbass techbro."
The dual motor Cybertruck could pull any truck at its price point and I would bet my house on this.
"Do the math and compare fuel and maintenance. Isn't that F-250 $60-80k? Top end Cybertruck is $70k, starts at $40k (not much more than a base F-150 up front). For the F-250, add like $20-30k in fuel cost over it's life. The Cybertruck truck is 2-3x less to fuel with electricity, even less on pure renewables. Are you sure the dual or tri motor couldn't beat the F-250? I think the top end Cybertruck will be 800 hp and at least 1000 lb-ft torque that is available from 0 RPM immediately. The torque is comparable but applied right at each axel and immediately vs coming from an engine that needs to rev up and disperse power front and back through a transmission and transfer case. Think it over."
"Um, that is so incredibly wrong dude."
FB is for boomers to look at their grandkid photos and for 50th year high school reunion planning. :D
I was waiting for this. LOL
yeah.. I didn't even get into the legality of driving that much weight and that long of a distance.
"And then Elon shows up with another one, plugs in Top Gear's truck into his one's 240V outlet, and tows it away"
"Yep. It’s a test of nothing. For a commercial. That’s it. It’s publicity. 

We’re sitting here talking about it. That’s what they want."
"It would be a test of physics. A test that can be done on paper without the trucks present. All the variables are known.  Even if they had equal horse power and produced the exact same torque, and had the same traction/friction coefficient, the cybertruck weights more than the F150 by a lot."
There's no way the cybertruck would beat a dually
"Maybe? When I priced out an F150 with the same cab and bed, it was on par with the base cyber truck. Add in tech packages and it was getting very close to the dual motor."
Price at time of purchase or should we also factor in fuel/maintenance savings?
Because the Cybertruck is not unlike the Raptor in quite a lot of ways. It just tows more.
"Beat me to it.

A 2020 f150, quad cab (super crew), king ranch is showing as $58,705. That's preeetty close to $60k IMO."
"the only point I'm trying to make is that nothing is proven if we, for example use the most expensive Tesla with 4 engines costing way more than a v8 Ford that costs thousands of dollars less. 

Prove to me you can make an electronic car outperform gasoline for the same cost. I want to believe it! Right now I'm skeptical though."
McFly! You bojo!
Hahahhaha
Hahahaha
"> Why pay F250/F350 prices for F150 capability?

Towing capacity is quite literally the only spec that any Ford can compete with the cybertruck on. And even then the vast majority of ford trucks on the road are not as capable.

I have a 450 and that thing is a pain in the ass. A tuneup takes damn near a full day because you have to tear the whole fucking thing apart from the front AND from the cab. Or spend $800 to have it done, but then you have to take it there, fuck with the paperwork, Uber back to get some work done, then Uber back again, more paperwork, and you finally get the truck back after pissing away half a day. Repeat this process once or twice per year.

As someone who has an EV and a ford I can definitely say once an EV can replace it I'm changing and never looking back."
"That’s a great question. Maybe Ford should ask themselves that and lower the MSRP of some 2020 F-150s above $67k.

The F-250 market isn’t the F-150 market, and it certainly isn’t the Cybertruck market. Sure there is some capability overlap, but there are few Cybertruck customers who are going to buy an F-250 instead because the prices are in the ballpark."
[deleted]
"Sure it doesn’t match what most people think of when they think of a truck but that’s only because trucks have been made the same way for decades and by design, most trucks in today’s world are designed with basic modularly in mind.

Most trucks allow you to choose a cab and then choose a bed. You can interchange the two here and there for bed lengths, cab size, engine size, etc...  the result is you don’t get an end product that is designed all together really well.

A few trucks look good because their beds and cabs are designed to seamlessly fit together.  Look at a Cadillac EXT.  Externally it looks great because it looks edgy and it has more of a cohesive design. Inside, it just looks like a standard SUV. Bleh. There is nothing futuristic about it.  

The Cybertruck is a super futuristic truck that checks all the boxes for utility and goes beyond with air suspension, power supply, air compressor, and a body that has unmatched ruggedness.  Interior wise, it looks more modern than any truck out there and it still meets the requirements of most truck owners when they are looking at features and capabilities. 

The Tesla truck is going to win over a bunch of people who normally buy trucks and even convert some people who would have never considered a truck until now.  Now THAT is powerful."
"I see the cyber truck is strong enough to tow goal posts too. It would be a fun comparison, which car can win a tug of war doesn't determine the better car. The vw isn't a better car than a duramax if it wins the tug of war. It's supposed to be fun"
"Nope. I’m talking about [this](https://youtu.be/k62gW3Se5e0).

Also, VW engineers lied about an emissions control that, at speed, cost more in fuel to run than emissions it saved by not running it - thereby negating the need for that particular component of the emissions control system except at idle. It was a very engineer thing to do (though highly unethical to lie about and bypass the way they did). I had a Jetta TDi wagon at the time and researched the issue thoroughly before electing to not have the issue “fixed”."
"This makes me appreciate that I'm 33 and never had a car payment.

"Potentially. Guess I'll see, but I'm preparing now. Saving and paying off my current car early."

"That is fine and we can do that but then you aren't comparing trucks at the same price point. Why not compare it to an F-350 with a bed full of gravel.

As a business owner, I want to know what my $50k gets me. We can even ignore cost of ownership for this exercise. Just walk into Ford throw down $50k and tell them you want an AWD truck with most torque and tires with the best grip you can get, I will spot you the couple hundred bucks for the yard of gravel to even out the weight of the trucks."
"Of course I won't buy it.  But where is all the love coming from?  Do you actually like the look of this ""truck""?  If you do, what do you like about it aesthetically?  Do you like the sharp corners?  Do you like that it has big tires?  The simplicity?  Besides looking like a big triangle on wheels it has no redeeming value.  Also, I am trying to figure out how the hell Tesla went from the beautiful Model X, the sexy Model 3, the organismic roadster, to the turd of the year ""truck""."
Never heard of the Rivian truck till you mentioned it.  At least it looks like a truck and not a triangular turd with wheels.
I have tried to find info on the drag coeff. and the towing capacity as it relates to the range and have not had any luck.
"Fun fact: in banks, nearly everyone gets a title of VP next to their name, even entry analysts. It’s a quick way to make everyone feel important."
That's not very Tethical...
And also Elon plays a man with nothing to lose. He stood on stage for half an hour in front of a truck with broken windows and still got 200k preorders.
"There's not much ""if"" about them losing (and it doesn't mean the f150 is a poor truck).  Elon choose Ford specifically because the f150 had been the benchmark of trucks for like 40 years now. The Tesla will outweigh the f150 most likely, have max torque at 0rpm which no gas engine can match, and probably have bigger/more aggressive tires giving it a bigger contract patch. 

A larger contact patch with more weight holding the tire to the Earth will already be a huge advantage to the Tesla but adding instant maximum torque is nearly insurmountable.  This is a very apples to oranges test that Ford/Chevy/Dodge/Toyota/Nissan should want no part of. 

I would like to see them both hook up to a 10k lbs trailer and go for a spin."
"There's always the option Ford may pull a quick one and bring an electric F-150 to the test. For an ""Apple to Apple"" comparison. But maybe not. They're not the ""reckless risk taking"" type. Tesla is.

If anything, I'm happy Ford don't want to do that, because I don't need another ""broken armor glass"" moment."
Do you suppose Tesla could afford to run down to a local dealership and do this on their own? Ford just opened that door.
Unless they used the electric F150 prototype
And Tesla has time to adjust the Cybertruck if it doesn’t win...so that it 100% does next time.
"Yes but the price and size (not towing or torque specs) of the Cybertruck set it as a true competitor of the F-250. 

Ford’s tweet was in jest as an F150 would lose but a F250 would win."
They kinda already did
"They were saying they didn't expect Elon to say yes so soon, because there is currently only 1 cybertruck. With rumors of Ford making an electric F-150, it would make sense for them to try and put their electric truck against Tesla's"
Ever think about why they put the F-150 into 2wd? I guarantee they tested it in 4wd first.
"This is not a real test. This is marketing. This test tells nothing of the caliber of either truck. Just the weight of the F-150 and that it was in 2WD, not 4WD.

Frankly it's really shameful for Tesla to be doing this, because anyone who actually understand how towing and trucking works will realize this is pointless."
I postulate that they are already humiliated with their challenge and retraction. They are now trying to save face to prevent further damage.
"And they could reasonably suspect it would not be a fair test. Since the CT is not released yet, Tesla could easily add extra weight and no one could dispute it is the real weight. By the time the tri-motor truck releases no one will care to check out it weighted the same as the one used for the test. I don't mean to say Tesla world be dishonest about it, but Ford has no way to ensure they have a fair shot so why risk it?"
Such boomers
Kinda like throwing a steel ball through a “bulletproof” window and the window shattering...
Risk isn’t that high. The vast majority of F-150 owners likely aren’t buying a Cybertruck.
Maybe they were going to take both up into the mountains pulling hunting camping gear and hang out for a week and then see what vehicle makes it back.
It may have just been that this was the truck that happened to be there the day the had the Cybertruck outside (owned by one of their employees who was part of the testing crew) and the test was more impromptu than fully planned.
"They did the math in the most flattering test possible.

If they did an actual real world test that wasn't staged and wasn't in best case scenario it's not going to go well."
"Is it just me, or is Neil a lot more ego and Elon-hate, and a lot less physicist than he used to be?"
"Technically he probably lifted a finger like 5 times, unless he already has Neuralink or does text-to-speech tweeting..."
This should be the top comment.
[deleted]
Umm no. The mid-level lariat starts at 42k. The Tesla truck would at least be comparable to an f-150 in mid-level trim. Yes the f-150 starts at 28k for base trim.
"XL SuperCrew 6.5' Box 2WD

$37,595

Base CT is $39k. 

What's life like hating on everything?"
Gas isn't going to be dead bud...
It’s just a waste of money and resources for Ford. This test is useless. The F350 already tows 6000lbs more than the top trim cybertruck. Ford doesn’t have anything to prove. Tesla is just once again generating hype from basically lies. This is their marketing.
Average selling price of an F150 is in the 40’s. Cybertruck starts at just under 40.
"Of course not. They already did a test with an f150, they just used a rear wheel model with less power than the cybertruck.

They just need to do the same thing again without rigging it in cybertrucks favor."
"If both trucks have similar tires, then it comes down to weight and torque.  If weight is similar, then torque probably wins.  If the Cybertruck is heavier and has more torque, then it will drag the F150 no matter what it does."
"Or long distance haul as cheap as possible, Tesla wins again."
Ah well he's in trouble now I bet.
"> Ford X is a small subsidiary arm of Ford Mobility which is a small subsidiary of Ford focused on providing financial assistance to people needing to adapt vehicles for those with disabilities

This isn't true.  Ford X is a small arm of Ford focused on Electric, Autonomous and Connected vehicles as well as alternative ownership (read car share/taxi fleet) models.  They're creating Ford's version of AutoPilot.  I believe Ford sees Ford X as the future of vehicles.

I have no idea where in the Ford/FordX food chain this particular VP is, but I'd bet even money he's met the CEO."
"Fords backpedaling because they have absolutely nothing to gain from trying to do this even if they beat the cybertruck.  No one that is going to buy the cybertruck will change their mind if Ford wins the contest.  And Ford sells more than 75,000 F-series trucks a month.  Whether they win or lose there’s nothing for them to gain by getting into a dick measuring contest with Elon Musk."
"It would’ve already been done if Tesla wasn’t so shady by using a RWD F-150. 

But too bad Tesla and Elon have to resort to these pathetic and childish tactics in order to gain attention. How sad."
He’s just glad it’s not a Chevy
Is this a reference to that guy that edits himself into those commercials?
Yes!!!
"Upvote for Mahk, though he’d probably have an equally good time making fun of one of Musk’s presentations."
How do you get an investor tag? I own stock and I pre ordered the cyber truck! I WANT BOTH
"""Real actors, not people"""
What do you have against cyborgs?!
"Where are you getting 4"" of travel from? Nobody knows yet, and 14"" is probably more likely than 4""."
That’s 4” of adjustment via the air suspension. Not 4” of suspension travel.
"There are also companies that do it, like Munro. They do the complete tear down of the cars and make a report on everything from design to build quality all the way to profitability. They sell the reports to whoever is willing to pay. I think they also will do tear-downs for manufacturers as a 3rd party to see if there are places they can improve. 

Here is a video on the Tesla https://youtu.be/pAS-yjWj9DY"
"Well, it's kind of meaningless in general. That's why you can find videos of pickups out-pulling tractor trailers. Doesn't mean they are better at towing, but of course that kind of nuance is lost among fanatics. And yes, it is meaningless to put it up against a lower tier truck that's RWD just cause ""IT'S A F-150 DOE!!"" 

> This sounds like a huge defect for a truck. You can only tow its full capacity if you load the bed up with sand. 

And yet, almost miraculously, those trucks can regularly tow up their their specified capacity without filling the bed with sandbags. Hm...

This has been discussed at length here and elsewhere. You can believe what you like, the information is out there. Either dive in and try to understand what these tests do prove and don't prove, or take the common viewpoint that Elon's word is fact."
"Electric motors can burn up, too.  I wouldn't try it with a manual because you would probably burn up your clutch, but an automatic with torque converter would be just as even of a match."
"you can get a solid F-150 for 3k easy.

this test would prove that there's no point in spending 50k on a superfluous, cult-fueled cringefest of a vehicle when you could spend reasonable money on a pickup that does everything the average person needs. people need to stop buying these overpriced cars, force him to make something practical for once"
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!?
I meant like all the different F150s hooked together being dragged by the one Cybertruck at the same time lol
Demonstrating superiority is one thing. Needlessly humiliating someone is something else...
However the best truck pulls are done...
"It must be really frustrating for him. He’s living in this world of innovation and I’m sure he has exciting tech on his workshop floor - but the culture around him is at odds, as evidenced here.

Funny, there’s parallels here reminiscent of the Ford vs Ferrari story currently in theatres. That movie doesn’t paint Ford execs in the best light."
They’re not going to do it because they leave this kind of dick measuring to rednecks on YouTube. Go search Ford vs Chevy tug of war. There’s hundreds of videos infested with idiot commenters talking shit to each other.
Elon is good at baiting other companies.
"""No fair using superior specs against us! Now let's roll coal!"""
"This is incredibly wishful thinking. Even in the EU where there’s more government and regulatory buy-in, there will still be ICE cars being manufactured in 10 years."
"Ford's financial health is largely dependent on the health of F-150 sales. Tesla wouldn't have to replace Ford as ""the"" truck company. It would simply need to take a big enough bite out of the pie, and Ford could be in dire straits as a company.

Not saying it WILL happen, but Ford is not immune to disruption. 10% drop in sales could mean real trouble for them. Tesla just took the equivalent of 20% of annual F-150 sales as pre-orders in just a few days. Obviously not all of these will convert, and less still would have been prospective F-150 buyers - but even if half of that number converts in 2021 Ford might be in a tough spot financially."
"The provocation is Elon saying the Cyber truck is tougher than a F-150 and faster than a Porsche.

It's a classic, smart marketing move: you challenge the #1 market leader. Ford made the mistake of responding."
Seriously I can’t believe he thinks he’d lose his job
"I don’t think that’d be good - this VP seems like he’s pro-innovation, but was blocked from doing this be the other, much larger side of the company."
"I doubt Tesla did any physical tests other than the one we saw. You don't want to actively try to destroy your one and only prototype, which probably cost millions of dollars to produce (especially before the unveil). 

This would be a better job suited for production prototypes."
"I think it depends on the model year of which engine. I think the newer ones are turbo, not supercharged. But the bigger difference would be the raptor's 4wd system, wider body, heavier axles, heavier engine, etc. 

A base F150 can weigh as little as 4,100lbs. A Raptor can weigh up to 5,700lbs. For comparison, a model X weighs 5500lbs.

The electric motors still have an advantage because of very fine torque control. An ICE powertrain has a tough time not ""breaking traction"" which is when it will lose (with all else equal). This is a reason super powerful ICE vehicles always lose against EV's during launch on the drag strip. One: EV's have insane low-end torque from 0 RPM. Two: EV's are able to apply that power without breaking traction and spinning their wheels. Something an ICE powertrain cannot do well."
The raptors are twin turbo but not a good vehicle to have a good tug of war. I’d like to see a diesel f-350 do it since they are rated to tow so much.
"They need higher displacement, more than they need a supercharger. This is all about low-end torque where electric has inherent advantages.

Ford would need to bring a diesel at a minimum."
"It's not about torque, a tug of war just comes down to weight and coefficient of friction after a certain point.  To get torque out of the way: the F150 EcoBoost puts out 400lbs-ft of torque at 2000rpm which gets multiplied by 33 going through a torque converter, transmission, and differential, that's more than 13,000lbs-ft at the wheels, the Cybertruck supposedly makes 1000lbs-ft of torque and assuming Tesla continues to use a 10:1 final drive, puts out 10000lbs-ft at the wheels.  So torque isn't really an issue for the F150 either, it's not like it starts at 0rpm, it'll be revved up before letting off the brake.

What wins a tug of war is who's vehicle can pull with the most force in their direction and for that it comes down to weight and coefficient of friction.  As long as the Tesla weighs more and has stickier or wider tires it will always be able to pull the F150.  It's just sad that Tesla saw the need to even use a rwd F150 for their PR stunt even though the odds were already in their favour."
How is Porsche's lap time not credible? They posted the [whole lap](https://youtu.be/8m31EgQkswg) on YouTube if you want to verify.
I don’t remember Porsche starting the whole battle. Pretty sure it was Tesla and Elon. They were just posting their laptime
I tried explaining that to someone yesterday how the friction difference between steel on steel vs rubber tire on asphalt is vastly different. A millions pounds on railcar doesnt matter because no one and absolutely no one tows railcars with a pickup. A proper test would have been something on asphalt.
A regular Toyota Tundra towed the goddamn space shuttle.  Whoop-e-ding
"I just did a quick calculation with two datasets. One for 453'592.4kg at a rolling friction of 0.001 (1mio lbs on rails) and one for 128'850kg at 0.015 rolling friction (787-9 on tarmac) at 10km/h each.



 | plane | train
---|---|----
cr | 0.015 | 0.001
mass [kg] | 128'850 | 453'592
pulling force at 1km/h [kN]| 19.03| 4.82
pulling force at 10km/h [kN]| 19.06 | 4.85"
I must be dumb but I was hoping that video would be an actual example of the difference between towing and pulling. I still don't get it in the context of cars.
I now want a rocket truck...
Honestly anything that results in them adding rocket thrusters is a net positive for the world. Doesn’t even matter what the original product was.
Rocket boosters are a legit option on the new roadster - https://insideevs.com/news/338616/tesla-roadster-with-spacex-inspired-boosters-comes-to-life/
Except for Tesla did not beat Porsche since they do not have a production car or actual time set.
Lays down a merlin in the bed.
Except that steel ball that broke his windows....
"It also had a full roll cage, flared fender to accomodate the most important change, which were the super aggressive semi-slick tires. 

It was NO WHERE CLOSE to a representative example of the Tesla people can actually buy."
The tires weren't road legal.
The Taycan is in production already. The model s is over a year away from that.
Still better than announcing extrapolated lap times
"So isnt that just proof that the tesla is better. The fords worse performance is inherent to its design it has low traction just because thats the way its built. They tested two barebones models of each It kind of doesnt matter why the tesla did better. 


The teslas weight distribution is part of its design it will always be like that where as adding extra weight to the ford is closer to cheating by specifically giving it extra performance beyond what its design has and its done specifically to make it compete better.


 I agree with testing an AWD ford but i think adding any extra weight is unneccesary the weight difference is inherent to the vehicles so its something to consider when making the decisions 
And if they are going to do the test it should be a test of what the customer is buying not what ford can specially tailor for this competition. its not like ford is going to be giving their customers extra weights with every sale to make up the towing power."
"Aha got it, thank you."
"Lol I would love 10 million HP. 

Funny thing, last night when my brain wouldn’t turn off. I was thinking: what is the most boost mankind could (unsafe or otherwise) create to propel a space ship. I imagined having an open cylinder of sorts and detonating all WMD inside it (assuming we had a cylinder made of material that could withstand it). Would it be this or would it be somehow combining all nuclear powers in some way?

No, I did not sleep. Sorry if off topic but someone needs to hear this! Lol"
"I'm waiting on a ""Here's us beating an F-150, and an F-250, hell let's pull this F-350 while we're at it"". That'll get everyone hot and bothered lol"
"Eh, not exactly. The only significant advantage I see for the Cybertruck is extremely precise traction control. An F150 with a torque converter and a low-range gearbox should have no problem putting down competitive torque at the wheels.

But this is a stupid test to begin with, so.."
"I’m going to have to thank you for the opportunity ahead of time........



What do you mean, *you people* ?"
"yeah, they're never going to be 1 to 1 replacements. cybertruck is a daily driver sportscar that can also do truck stuff. to me, the biggest selling point of the cybertruck is that it will get \~80MPGe, so you can use it as a daily driver vehicle, instead of owning a commuter car AND a truck, like many truck owners do.

I was actually super disappointed when the cybertruck came out, because I was hoping for a super off-road truck, with maybe some ability to do van/truck camping. it's not really crazy good at off road, and it's nothing special in terms of camping. then I thought about it another way: maybe this isn't the best truck in the world, but maybe it's a really good car. given the price, it's right in there with the Model 3. it's a Model 3 with an optional extra ""truck package"" (and weird look)"
"Actually you can get a 2018 4wd w/ powerstroke for 45~ish. Really not a fair comparison. I hate the way it looks, but hopefully they will have better test in the future"
"yeah, but range anxiety is still very strong for a lot of people. I would assume people who buy pickups would be even more aware of it, if they even infrequently tow long distances"
[deleted]
"The problem in this entire tweet exchange isn't that NDT is out of his league or he somehow isn't smart (which I've seen stated by some) but that NDT missed the point of the demonstration completely. The point wasn't to show some great advantage of the CT over traditional trucks. The point was to get a laugh and have some fun while poking fun at the primary competitor.  
  
I've always said, engineers are scientist who wanted to have fun."
Link?
"And on top of that, the Cybertruck's wheels just won't spin no matter what. That's loss of traction and force on the ground if they slip even a little. The motor controller won't allow any slipping."
"Considering it’s a torque converter auto; it doesn’t need to. Now, I’m not saying that it would win for certain, but 510 foot-pounds x 2.64 through the transfer case and you are looking at ~1350 foot pounds (an S performance makes 792 lb-ft).

I still think there is a good chance the CT would come out on top, but the F150 wouldn’t give up without a fight."
"Cool. I'll mark you down in the NDT camp, then. Make sure you dont miss the test :)"
"How can you say that the one with most traction wins and then immediately say ""traction control is irrelevant""?

And no, torque isn't the same in both. A gas engine at idle has close to zero, electric has full torque."
">any truck at its price point

So the $70k Cybertruck capable of pulling 14,000lbs...

...Would pull a $60k F350 capable of pulling 37,000lbs? Can prolly even option the luxuries cheaper for the same tow capacity...

OK dude, lol."
"As an F350 owner... Nobody buys HD trucks for fuel economy. In fact they dont even require EPA testing for fuel economy, just emissions. 

F250s start at $40k just like the Cybertruck, and are capable of pulling 17,000lbs as a BASE WORK model. More than the cybertruck. 

High end F250s/350s are priced $75k or so... And can be configured up to a tow capacity of 37,000lbs. *Yes it would pull the top model cybertruck, capable of 14,000lbs.*"
"The Cybertruck's $70k highest trim has a tow rating of 14,000lbs. 

The BASE MODEL $40k 2020 F250 can pull 17,000lbs.

Or optioned up to $60k+ in a XLT, the F350 can pull 37,000lbs.

The Cybertruck is a fail from a capability and price standpoint compared to similarly priced HD trucks."
"And then Elon would sue BBC, loose and then repeat this process one more time.to loose one more time."
350 is the highest line that has a single rear wheel option. 450 and up is all dually
"Here’s a 4x4 F250 for $55,000. It has a 15,000 pound towing capacity. 


https://www.northcentralford.com/new/Ford/2019-Ford-F-250-3877ea440a0e0a171d51c9a73650d317.htm?searchDepth=3:9"
"I'm seeing a lot of comparisons to base-model prices of pickups. I think it's disingenuous to compare a fully spec'd CT with a base model truck that lacks over half the amenities a CT comes with.

If someone wanted to buy an F150 with all the technological packages to be on par with a CT (no AP), that'd easily be close to the same price range."
"Absolutely! A Ford F 250 4x4 can be bought for $55,000. With a 15,000 towing capacity and four wheel drive, we can compare it to the $69,900 Cybertruck. Now, the Cybertruck would leave it in the dust but most medium duty truck owners aren't tracking their trucks. 

So, with fuel savings, at what point are you going to make up the $15,000 price difference?"
"Tesla tow rating = 14k lbs. 

Ford diesel = 18.5k lbs."
"You have a shitty F450... Cab off repairs twice a year?! 

Sounds like a '08-'10 6.4L. Cabs gotta come off for just about everything on that truck. Navistar International designed the engine and Ford shoehorned it into their trucks. 

The '11+ 6.7L powerstrokes have been fantastic. The cab only has to come off every 150k-250k miles or so for fuel system replacement. Not unlike a battery replacement in a Tesla. 

And *literally every* F250 on the market can out-tow a Cybertruck. Their base model XL can pull 17,000lbs, for $40k. Which out pulls even the highest trim Cybertruck, from base level competition. 

The numbers just arent there yet, IMO."
">Maybe Ford should ask themselves that and lower the MSRP of some 2020 F-150s above $67k.

Quick Google search shows F150 platinum has a MSRP of $55,270. Where did you get $67k from? 

The Cybertruck has great capability, but the F150 is *almost* as good, for $15k less. Or for the *same money* get more than *double* the capability in the F350. 

The cybertruck is just still too expensive to compare for F150 buyers."
"Do you drive a pickup truck? 

Is that stuff *really* what you think pickup truck drivers in the USA care about? 

Or would you tend to agree that new truck buyers care solely about numbers? Or are most truck manufacturers marketing the wrong aspects of their trucks?

Edit: In fact Ford realized their customers care so little about exterior durability, they fucking switched to aluminum to up their tow capacity... And it worked; Chevy followed suit soon after LOL"
"RAM has offered air suspension in their trucks for 6 years now. Not new.

Ford has dekiberately made the choice to not add it.

You know why?

It's not really wanted and it adds reliability concerns."
Thank you Tesla PR/Sales rep...
Totally! The facts are completely irrelevant. Elon Musk has bought an infinite amount of free advertising by the stir this has all created.
Calculate fuel and maintenance and savings too!
"As r/personalfinance would tell you, buying a brand-new car is rarely a good idea from a purely financial POV. It's almost always better to get a gently-used car that's known to last 200k+ miles (Civic, Camry, etc).

I broke this ""rule"" for the Model 3 because I had saved up a healthy amount of cash and wanted to support the EV mission. (and the tech is extremely cool 😃)"
What's the point of having money if you're not going to use it?
"No this is not fine because the intention of the test is not how much you get for the price. The intention is pure performance. Now it is not fair to test the performance of 2 cars that have different driving mechanics (AWD vs RWD) and that completely ruins the purpose of the test.

Edit: performance in towing capabilities."
"I’ve owned trucks all my life. So has my dad. We both own a Tesla. S P100D and X P90D respectively. We both currently drive F-250s. We both are getting a cybertruck.
The capabilities on this truck are really nice and something about the look is just...clean. I’m tired of the current fad of just changing the grille and headlights on next gen trucks. Not to mention that the interior technology is that of 2010...
I for one love driving my Tesla and wish I could take it everywhere but don’t because I worry that I might damage it or chip it etc. and I cannot imagine what my daily 100 mile commutes would be if I had a Tesla truck. Smooth, autopilot, very responsive acceleration, doesn’t kill my back after a full day of use (F-250 is big, clunky, tiresome after using it all day)."
"If you look at it and compare it to the look of other trucks i agree, it looks bad. But dont look at the cyber truck as a truck. If you look at it as some completely other type of vehicle, that also happens to have the function of a truck, then it’s beauty becomes more apparent in the brutality and efficiency of its design. It is a functional vehicle boiled down to its most simplistic form and is design with physics and practicality in mind as its design language. Easy and cheap to manufacture, durable, extremely aerodynamic (important for EVs, especially trucks) and functional."
"Because it takes balls to release something so different. I mean, why not? Why should it fit the gentle curves of all the other pickups? Plus they’re doing something new in how they actually manufacture it. It’s not for everyone, but I love how it looks like nothing else. This kind of sums it up for me. https://youtu.be/ND2X49-aBFQ"
"Love it ? Nah. But I don’t hate it. In fact, I’m not sure what to think. I look at it and think, “hmm.” I won’t buy it, but I appreciate it for what it is. I’ve looked at cars on the road after I’ve been obsessing about the Model 3, S, and X. They have refreshed what I feel car design should aspire to and most cars on the road look so damn ugly to me now. So many unnecessary lines, lights, shit that is so ridiculous looking. 

Now, the cybertruck is weird as fuck, but maybe we should give it a chance. It was just a prototype. Let’s see what happens with this."
"Things I like: Low (compared to other pickups), wide, minimal design. Clean lines. The design is functional meaning it has to have sharp lines because the steel can only be folded since it's too hard to stamp.

&nbsp;

People are comparing the Cybertruck to a traditional pickup; if you do that it's terrible because it looks nothing like a pickup.
If most people saw the CT in a sci-fi movie they would not give it a second thought, but compared to a traditional pickup it looks ridiculous because it's so different. The problem isn't really the design, but the context; Tesla has added a radically new truck design to a very traditional domain.

&nbsp;

We have a hard time with radically new designs which is extremely risky for Tesla. But a good design can be ""ugly"" at first and can grow on people over time as they realize the value (the functional aspects) and get used to the new aesthetics."
"I... don't really like it, but I think it could grow on me. I like what it's trying to do, if not the specific execution (e.g. I really don't like the headlight-line, or the polygon hubcaps/wheelwells, but I do like the overall oragami look). 

I don't really hate it any more than than the current F-series, which also just made me wonder what the designer was thinking. Besides ""I wonder if I could fit a bigger chrome grille on the front?"". Or ""what if you installed ground-effect extension skirts, but then also a lift kit to get them off the ground?"".

Neither of them has the curb appeal of, say an 7th gen F-series or 1st-gen ranger (early 80s) to my eye, though.

But I also picked a subcompact hatchback, so I'm not really in the target audience for either."
"When you were a kid, did you think to yourself “man, I can’t wait to grow up and buy the most regular, boring looking pickup that looks identical to every other one on the road?”"
Maybe a (not) fun non-sequitur.
"Preorders cost $100

Not to short on his achievements or anything but that **could** also be a reason

Shoot, even if you wanted to jokingly buy this truck you could place a preorder and still get your money back in 2022. Go flex on your Insta or wherever the hell you want for $100 lol

I’m all for Elon and the great things he’s doing 👌🏽

Edit: Just so some people will stop replying with their “facts” saying deposits are non-refundable with no sources, it’s right here in this article stating the deposit is refundable right up until the day before your order is even completed: [In order to preorder the much-buzzed-about Cybertruck, customers had to drop a $100 refundable deposit, according to the company's website. In the tweet, Musk seems to have conflated preorders with ""orders.""](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/4290463002)

That happens when people trust you. I also look at most Tesla owners as critical thinkers that can actually look at the big picture when dealing with change.

"I forgot where I read it, or heard it, but someone basically said that “Elon is a genius sociopath committed with every fiber of his being to making his companies succeed... nothing, not explosions, near bankruptcy, sunk costs, negative press, and some of the world’s largest and most powerful companies lined up against him, will stop him. Why would you bet against him?”"
250K
"His shares went down by 6%, reducing his net worth by $760,000,000, so I'd say he has actually a lot to lose."
"The only chance a traditional ICE truck has would be a long drawn-out torture test.  Slow speeds (so less cooling), lots of power required, hard on the brakes, hard on the suspension, etc."
"The cybertruck is much closer to being between a stock f250 and f350. Not even sure why the f150 is being compared to it. They don’t have a chance against the cybertruck in this test, but this test really doesn’t translate to anything useful so who cares lol"
[deleted]
"Even given equal weight, and contact patch & traction...  EV traction control with milisecond timing would be the tie-breaker. ...    I'd theorize tesla might even win if they gave ford the benefit of starting first."
"I’d like to see the top of the line F150 and the top of the line Cyber go at it. Giving the F150 the 4 wheel drive model instead of rear whee will give it a huuuuuge boost.

I really can’t guess who would win, but having a 4 wheel drive go against a rear wheel drive is not a proper demonstration. I want top of the line against top of the line."
"TBH the model 3 SR could probably out-pull the F150. It's all about low RPM torque, and traction. We already know which wins on low end torque, and I bet the model 3 has more weight on the back axel than the F150."
"If they did an apples to apples test, the result would be a tie. I don't get why so many got excited about this test. Whichever truck puts the greatest pulling force onto the pavement will win. so what."
"Even if they bring an F-150, it looks like this is a game of traction (friction plus weight) anyways.  Any remotely stock f-150 will fail."
Even an electric f150 probably isn’t as powerful as a tesla raven.
I don't think that's a quick one. This is the head of Ford X saying let's do an apples to apples comparison. It sounds like an electric F-150 was more likely than a gas one to me.
What would the difference be between doing that and the video they have?  AWD?
"They already did. You can watch it.

I imagine if they could beat a 4 wheel drive f150 at a comparable level, they would not have gotten the rear wheel F150 (which is base).

With that said: I want to see top of the line vs top of the line."
They already did. That's what started this
It didn't go through...
"They didn't throw it ""through"" a window. It stopped it."
Simple.  Load the bed up with a couple tons of dirt once you get to the top and regen the batteries on the way back down.
With the deployable solar canopy and solar cover the CT might come back with more range than when it left.
Going up into the mountains would be fine for the Tesla. It just uses regenerative breaking the whole way back.
"I dunno; you take a shot at the King, you best not miss... Tesla stepping on Ford's toes wouldn't be something they did without some careful consideration beforehand imo."
"Nah, did you notice the camera crew?  This was carefully planned."
"You mean like a real world test Ford ""jokingly"" challenged them to which they accepted?"
Neil is a grumpy old egotistical man now. He got very very defensive when Joe Rogan was asking him basic (I’m a dumb ape explain it to me) questions on his podcast.
"I loved Neil at first. Largely because of his connection to Carl Sagan. But Neil makes a lot of broad sweeping statements that are not technically correct, and I felt that style was pretty irresponsible for a science communicator. I’ve come to lose all interest in NDT. He’s no Carl Sagan, that’s for sure."
"I feel like he changed after his brush with “me too”.  Not sure how that ended, but the internet shut him up for a few days after those that news."
"I love how jealous Reddit is of Neil deGrasse Tyson. yes, a black man is much smarter than you will ever be and is making a shitload of money doing it. Deal with it!"

"So if my budget is 70k. The f250 platinum offers more features except auto pilot and the Tesla will be cheaper to run. I love Tesla and I’m excited to watch them change the world, but I was upset when they released the cybertruck. It’s hideous in my opinion. I genuinely wanted a Tesla truck of my own but I hate the design with passion. It has to be one of the ugliest vehicles ever made. And no amount of features will ever get me to buy it."
Do you really think they used the base model Cybertruck for that video?
"37,000 lbs tow capacity. And it doesn’t look retarded."
A man can dream!
I trust the F350 should win but they are not the same.
"Yeah the base cybertruck really isn't that impressive at all tbh, the best comparasions would have to be the dual and tri motors against the diesel f250 for there price range"
"That's a super specced out F150 (starting price around 12K cheaper). A more apt base to base comparison would be a Super Duty F250 Crew Cab, where the cybertruck gets its ass kicked in capacity numbers. And, you can get AWD at the same price."
And that f150 would beat a base level cybertruck. The base level is a bad truck.
"Okay, so put sandbags in the truckbed to equalize the weight.  The point is the test proves absolutely nothing."
"Only if your time isn’t very valuable. 

For folks hauling a lot of heavy stuff on a schedule, There’s still a lot of value in being able to pull into any gas station, fill up in 3 minutes, and be back on the road without having to route-plan for charging stations. 

Even just driving my Model S from city to city, I’ve been met with slow supercharging...up to an hour for an 80% charge.  

And that’s assuming they redesign the supercharger network to allow for pull-through, otherwise I have to detach a trailer every 200 miles. Forget that."

"Electric motors CAN overheat, but Tesla has active cooling on it's motors, doesn't it? I'm trying to recall the superbottle design, and I'm pretty sure it's integrating the motor with intentional heat production in the system of heat management, where its running in some low efficiency mode with large hysteresis losses that create excess heat that's then directed to the battery pack to warm it so that it's not too cold when you get to a super charger?

The model S single rear motor puts out some 300KW (415 HP). I'm not sure if the Cybertruck is going to be geared a tiny bit lower then the S, I would think that would be a good idea, and I'm not sure about the cooling system that will be installed. The new plaid version running track right now undeniably has robust cooling, something that would allow it to deal with heat build up significantly better than the torque converter in the auto tranny. Those things are not designed for long term heavy torque converter use from what I understand, but it's admittedly not my forte. It's also a question of whether the transmission is a dual clutch or not. A dual clutch will absolutely get destroyed in a competition like this, whereas a true liquid coupling would hold out as long as it has a big enough oil cooler. The F150 uses the select shift DCT, which would get fucking obliterated by a competition like this. Maybe it could actually win a few times against a Tesla that cuts out due to overheating, but I find that pretty unlikely because of how much power the Tesla can put out for extended periods of time. Even if the Ford wins the first few tug of wars, the DCT is not designed for extended load slip useage, It's supposed to get into it's gear and then lock in to a solid non slip arrangement, which it won't be able to do while it struggles against a cybertruck.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OSDw-uyP98

If you want to understand the difference, and you'll tolerate being spoken to by an aussie, or a kiwi, i'm not an expert, you can watch that video, it's decent if I recall correctly. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0BZhs4Ugag"
"Worth noting there's a possibility that the DCT have a small torque converter in them, I'm having a bitch of a time getting real specs on them. If they do, I don't expect a stock version to have a robust solution for oil cooling though."
Why are you comparing a used old f-150 to a brand new vehicle that doesn’t exist yet?
"They could arrange it somewhere around a SpaceX installation. Sell tickets for spectators, invite bands to play, sell pop corn, sodie pop and other fine cuisine. Livestream this shit. Obligatory caps and t-shirts stands because we're not animals. Also this time maybe actually pull a Falcon 9 discarded first stage around. End the event with drag racing and a surprise Roadster appearance and let people buy ride along experiences while drag racing or maybe a raffle. Donate all money to the Tesla Armor Glass engineers that just got fired, a worthy cause."

"You have a point, and I'm sure the engineers confirmed and did virtual testing."
"After having driven all kinds of ""Sports"" cars for decades, I've never had anything lay power down like the Model 3. I Could be stopped and GUN it into a T intersection at over 80% throttle (on dry pavement of course) and I'd not get ANY wheelspin whatsoever.

My previous car (a BMW) is a pathetic joke. It'd spin an spin an spin even on a hot day with sticky tires on excellent pavement. Sure, great for when you want to take it to the track on the weekend and have some sideways fun but inclement weather or for overall livability/practicality? Not so much."
"State of the car, third party verification etc. It's not an official time so it can't be trusted.

Apparently some ""high end"" manufacturer has sped up and released video before so..."
"I didn't say anything about a battle. I said ""same level of credibility""."
Engineering explained did a video to demonstrate exactly this when the video did a big hype. It is a very good YouTube channel if you want to check it out.
A proper test would run the numbers on coefficients of friction instead of relying on spectacle.
"How about a space shuttle?  And just a gasoline engine?

"Pulling is just if you can move an object at all. Towing is actually being able to fully control the object you are pulling during normal operation. 

Like pulling 10M lbs, but only going 2 mph and not having to stop it down a hill...compared to towing 10k lbs, but being able to reach speeds of 65mph and stop with the object you're towing safely."
"Like the other replier said, towing is about being able to control the load your pulling. 

If your interested the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) has voluntary testing criteria a manufacturer can use when publishing their tow ratings

Please be real
"Has anyone calculated things? How much thrust can that really produce?

The only thing that intuitively makes sense to me for actual performance gains is that when the roadster is launching, they use thrusters pointed directly up, and that increases traction so the electric motors can dump more power into the tires.

How are thrusters going to be meaningful to the overall mass and power equations? I just don't get it."
"Neither did Porsche, it was all unofficial."
Oh I’m sure that’s not over.
Genuinely interested do you have a link? And did the Porsche have everything street legal as well?
All the better for 3 motor cybertruck orders. He’s going to be racing Porsche with the plaid option and the truck guys will benefit
"Tesla didn’t announce their times. It was reported by people there and Elon confirmed it. 

Trust me. When Tesla has finalized lap times, they’ll announce it with a video and etc."
"The weight isn't relevant. It's just that an empty bed exaggerates the effect of being 2wd, since even less weight is on the drive wheels.

Ford makes a 4wd version, which would be a better test. I think the Tesla would still win, but the test as it is is meaningless. The Tesla would have won even with half the torque of the Ford the way it was set up"
The Tesla likely weighing a ton more isn’t doing the Ford any favors.
"There's theoretical rocket ""engines"" that work by using lasers to trigger ""small"" nuclear explosions just behind the rocket. You can't do a single huge blast though, that'll just destroy the ship or kill people inside from the acceleration. AFIK no one has tried building one before though."
">[Project Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion\)) was a study of a spacecraft intended to be directly propelled by a series of explosions of atomic bombs behind the craft (nuclear pulse propulsion). ... The biggest design above is the ""super"" Orion design; at 8 million tonnes, it could easily be a city.[12] In interviews, the designers contemplated the large ship as a possible interstellar ark. This extreme design could be built with materials and techniques that could be obtained in 1958 or were anticipated to be available shortly after."
"Yeah, I actually have an F-150, but the main reason is interior space. Just nothing touches available leg room and that, mini vans, suvs, etc, all have poor second row legroom compared to crew cab pickups and my wife and I are both tall, so it hit all the check boxes except the fact that it’s a big truck and while I make use of the bed regularly, definitely don’t tow. 

So the Cybertruck is a major win in my opinion as I don’t have to feel as terrible owning a higher consuming truck to still get good interior volume. 

I just wish they had made it somewhere in between a Ranger and F-150 in size, targeted 400+ miles range, and likely capped the tow rating at 11,000 pounds.  The break over on the Cybertruck as-is is going to be poor, can’t fight that long of a wheelbase.  

The reality though is most F-150 owners don’t need 10,000+ lbs of towing. Myself included. I would be waaayyy more likely to be a Cybertruck buyer if it was slightly shorter in length and height compared to an F-150, but still has equivalent interior volume. Easily done without the massive engine bay an F-150 has to have."
"As an owner of a f250cclb. I'll say this.

Your going to hate life commuting with a truck as big as the cybertruck."
Seems like you're making a lot of assumptions. Like how exactly do you know it's not good off-road or for camping? Like Actually I'd say it's better than just about every other vehicle for camping purely because you have access to a 100+ KWh power source. And as far as off-roading we know basically nothing except it has one of the highest ground clearances of any production vehicles and good approach/departure angle. We don't really know anything else about how it'll perform off-roading because they haven't said anything. I mean maybe you're just talking about the size of it?
"Oh we all thought Elon did that all himself, thank you for the totally necessary correction"
"I was referring to this tweet:

Replying to @elonmusk
We all love Torque. But high Torque just spins a tire in place if there’s not enough weight to provide traction. Fully load the F150, giving highest traction to its rear wheels, then try to drag that up the hill. I otherwise agree: Load both to the max and the highest torque wins

Elon Musk
✔
@elonmusk
Agreed, this will be exciting to see!"
"The F150 would have gotten dragged even if it t stood on its brakes. It’s lighter, by a lot. Traction control and power don’t help when you are being pulled by someone who has more grip because of their weight."
"You're pretty far off there. That'd only be correct if you had a manual transmission and you were dumb enough to lock the clutch and kill the engine. This is certainly an automatic with a torque converter, which actually multiplies torque when the input and output RPMs are different. 1700 or so input RPM to a 0 RPM output makes quite a bit of torque.  
  
  
  
The cybertruck would still out-pull it though."
">A gas engine at idle has close to zero, electric has full torque.

Do you have ever driven a car? You can dump the clutch or pre-load a torque converter. Or how do you think do you do a burnout?"
"A gas engine at idle has a lot more than zero, and a torque converter, short gears, etc.  At the wheels it clearly has a fuckload of actual torque or the pickup wouldn't move.

Is there a tesla forum that isn't filled with clueless fanboys, the majority of whom don't even own a fuckin Tesla?  Good lord you guys are stupid"
"Yes because this contest is about traction not towing capacity (well, as long as towing capacity exceeds the amount of force needed to go above the static friction coefficient).   
  
The CT will hit max torque long before the 350 reaches what it needs to pull with enough force to be above the CT's coefficient of static friction. The CT will begin to pull it with the 350's tires in place (not spinning). This means the 350 is now in kinetic friction which takes a lot less force to maintain on the CT's end. This also means that the 350 has lost all traction and as such would need to come to a stop (or near stop) in order to regain it.  
  
As long as the CT gets the truck sliding before the truck can establish it's pull in the opposite direction the CT wins. The reverse is also true but due to the way torque on a traditional engine works the CT will usually win this type of contest."
"You keep bringing it back to your argument. I never said anything about the tri-motor model.  I’m guessing you replied to the wrong person because your comment is completely out of context in reply to my comment.

And since you want to talk about your scenario so badly, when does each truck reach max torque? The Cybertruck reaches it a LOT faster than anything non-electric. 

Towing capacity is irrelevant here. This is a subset of “pulling” capacity, because it deals with tongue weight and balancing. The Cybertruck could pull a jet, but it could not **tow** anything close to that weight.

People are way too confused about towing vs. pulling, and your entire argument is a demonstration of this."
Ok. Let's see it.
"Cool - sorry, but this is the BS I'm glad we don't deal with https://imgur.com/a/ih2fsxx"
"If the Cybertruck is still better than the F250, why are we using that as a basis for comparison?

Average American drives 13.5k/year. 5 years of that is 67.5k miles.
Current national average price of gas is $2.73. (Better hope that stays constant - looking at you Middle East situation that reeks of stability!) 
Approx fuel efficiency of an F250 - 15 MPG

So it’s gonna cost  ~2500/year in fuel alone to run that thing - or 12,500.  Now that gap is $2500 - for a “lesser” truck. And the “truck guys” I’ve known *all* compare stats around to justify their purchase, regardless if they use them or not. Of course, that’s in the truck’s “salad days” - expect heavier maintenance to creep in around years 4-6. Sooner, depending on what you’re doing with it.

Tesla 3/S’s cost ~ 4.5 cents/mile to charge if you do it from the grid. Less if you’re smart about it or use solar (a whole other set of math). That’s what, $3k? Maybe make it more to account for weight. Without the same maintenance and a body that’s going to be hard to ding or otherwise bang up?

So we’re in a $5k gap range for a truck that’s was born better than your tricked out F250, It will almost certainly last longer (million mile motors), require far less maintenance, will be harder to bang up, and will almost certainly resell better."
"An F 250 4X4 starts at $40,425 before any incentives."
Not at 0 rpm
"That is just a function of total vehicle weight, it says nothing about the pulling power."
"It is absolutely a shitty vehicle. It's been modified to suit our needs and it's a pain in the ass to change vehicles, and a pain in the ass to keep. A constant money drain that burns through fuel like a wildfire and has too many parts fail. Starters, batteries, alternators, pumps, air conditioning, and I'm probably forgetting more. I love the utility of our modifications, but hate the vehicle it's attached to. Every time we have a failure we're out a couple grand in labor/opportunity cost, plus whatever the repair is.

Million miles battery, and 10x fewer moving parts? Can't wait. Only trouble is I wish they had something between an f 150 and a semi. A badass transit style van would be perfect for us to modify."

"Honestly. I think that we will see a huge truck redesign in 1-2 years. It will look much more tame. Sales will go through the roof because people will have heard how well the truck performs but will have been turned off by the styling. Folks will say ""well this looks much better and we've had a couple years to iron out any bugs. So sure I'll buy one."" Fuck it man. I would buy one if the price came down too. If they offered a 4x4 version for under $40k I would be all over it. Especially if they released a Tacoma sized truck"
"One of the challenges of personal finance is the members typically look at just top line math. That works for basic financials. But individuals with more complex financials might be getting wrong information.

Example: I did a car loan on my model 3, financed 110% of it. But I have the cash sitting to pay it off. My cash is generating a return of 9% in the market, car loan is 2.9%. With electric car I got a better utility rate with power company, don’t have to pay as much in tolls, and less maintenance. 

Now if I did not have the cash, lived in a place where utilities would not give a better rate, and HOV/toll lanes did not have a discount to free it would be another story."

"In order to have it tomorrow, when you might really really need it"
"Okay, so we swap out the RWD ford for an AWD, Tesla still wins. Then we swap out the tires on that AWD Ford for the same ones that are on the CyberTruck, Tesla still wins. Now the engine into Ford is too small and can't generate enough torque so we get a new AWD Ford with the bigger engine and the new ties, Tesla still wins.

Like I was trying to say in my previous comments, there is a scenario where the Ford wins but to get there you need to spend more money and form a business standpoint that is a non-starter."
"Why would you take a new Tesla out if you are afraid of chipping it?  Also, have you test driven the new ""truck""?  Or are you assuming that it will feel the same to drive as your current Tesla?  Thanks for the comment BTW, it is nice to hear others view on why they like the truck.  Do you like the way it looks though?  If you do what do you like about it?  To me it looks like the Army's Stryker brigade vehicle."
"So you are saying that the look of this vehical is less in the aesthetic and more in the function.  Don't understand what is meant by brutality (unless this is another word for ugly) and I don't understand how it is efficient.  For an easy and cheap to manufacture truck it is still more expensive than the gasoline version.  It just seems to be more tank like than anything.  

But I guess with all my thoughts aside, any new model Tesla which will help the company to come out with new models and make more electric cars is a plus.  Even if I can't see what is so great about it.  To be completely fair I am not a truck guy anyway..."
"Not really.  As a kid I never wanted a truck at all.  They all look terrible.  But the tesla ""truck"" looks especially terrible."
"Even if those are cheapy refundable pre-orders / reservations.
How does the number compare to other non-tesla vehicles? No matter if they are electric or not.


I think I've heard something about the electric BMW i3  getting 30k pre-orders - in about half a year."
"I had a showerthought about the reservation price yesterday. 

Having it be $100 instead of $1000 will probably help considering how many electric vehicles have been announced from other companies and are set to go to market in the next 2-3 years. People would be more likely to ""move"" their reservation money from one car to another. Of course I *want* to hold my spot in line for every awesome electric car out there and be first to get it, but its not something I should or will do.

Obviously a reservation doesn't equal a sold Cybertruck, but I'd say you're a lot more likely to buy something you have a reservation for than something you've previously cancelled a reservation for."
"Is this the new ""no one wants the Cybertruck"" BS? Who the hell preorders a truck with no intention of buying it?"
"Even though pre-ordered only cost $100, so  there is a high number of people who may not cancel, there is also high number of people who don't pre-order anything and will buy when it's availalble. I just have to convince my SO in the next two years, no biggie."
"No, I agree completely that this is a primary reason for the high number. Frankly, I'm surprised it's not higher, with such a low barrier to entry.

Didn't Model 3 do this number or higher in the first 24 hours, with a $1000 deposit?"
"""not to short on...""

Immediately shorts on... 👍"
"I have $100 lying around and even though i think the cybertruck is cool, I wouldn’t just throw my money away even if it was only $100. Pretty sure other people feel the same way. Putting up any money at all has to show some kind of intent to buy"
"I'm feeling it because of the $100 pre-order.

How many did they receive for model Y at $2500?

Also model 3 got 250k pre-orders because it's a normal looking awesome car. Their first mid market sedan. I know a lot who placed $1000 but canceled it. And I didn't put it but wanted it and bought it earlier this year.

If the cyber truck were $1000 or $2500 they would not receive as many and it would be more of the true crowd who really want it. If reckon it's about a third to half."
"If you read Cialdini's book [Influence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28815.Influence), he talks about how businesses can eke out more sales via even small, seemingly innocuous commitments.   If people put any investment at all into something, they're more likely to buy than if they hadn't.   The investment can even be one of time or intellectual effort, such as writing an essay for a prize saying why a particular product is good.    The flexing on Instagram or whatever only further reinforces a need for self-consistency.    

Granted, almost everyone seems to think that *they* are immune from these effects, but advertisers, politicians, religious leaders, and others continue to dependably use them."
"I much prefer my info straight from the source. Like where it says ""Fully Refundable"" right beneath the $100 price on [tesla's order page](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#battery)"
If I wanted to 'flex'  there's no reason to out a deposit down.  Just say u did and copy someone's confirmation picture lol.
"Who is really out there just “flexing on your Insta” over this? Especially when everyone knows that yes, it’s just $100?"
lets see you get a 2MM interest free loan.
"It too could flex by saying you put in a pre-order without doing it. It's not like you get or need any real evidence. So if you aren't interested why not just lie?..

Not that it matters because nobody gives a Fark anyway. You impress nobody no matter what."
If I want someone to hold onto $100 with no interest I’ll put it in a checking account.
"You're right people would totally do that for every other car!

Oh wait..."
"$100×200,000 orders (and counting) = $20,000,000. In less than a week. Has Ford or any other automaker achieved this after any unveiling? I'd still call it a giant success. Not really about 'flexing' and more about supporting a company that is making a world of difference for the better of humanity. I just think that there are many reasons, not just the $100.
For the record, I preordered the tri motor, because I want something that is far enough away that I can save for it now and set a goal for myself while doing what I believe is in reality a financially sound long term decision."
I’m assuming the people at Tesla knows their metrics. Assuming they attachment rate on the previous launches is a indicator for the truck.
"100$ times 100,000

That’s 100 million incentives for them to speed up and make the car ..."
Dont you have to pay tt&l at the time of pre order? So itd be 100 dollars ontop of whatever taxes and title cost on a 40-50k?
Yes spend $100 for absolutely nothing sure sure
$20 million in preorders
"I would say that I’m very happy about this. I know enough about Tesla that $1000 may be too much for waiting 2-3 years on delivery, but I am really glad to get in early with only $100. I fully intend on buying but I wouldn’t preordered if it was $1-2000."
I feel like it's kind of a mental thing though.  In your mind you've already put a deposit down. Now you're Judy getting financials in the perfect place the next 3 years.
"> Preorders cost $100

While I agree, he still has 200k reservations. And it's probably 100 instead of a 1k due to the looks and the fact Tesla can't count those reservations as income anymore."
That’s still $20 million dollars that people have given Tesla. It’s a lot of money. Even if they get a refund Tesla will make a ton just on interest. It’s brilliant
"I don't think the $100 deposit is refundable, this was the change when they came down from $2500."
"Smart move actually. 220k preorders at $100 a piece and fully refundable. Elon takes that 22 million dollars, puts it in an investment or escrow for 2 years, refunds everybody that wants to. Even if that's all 220,000 preorders and even if the interest he gains is only 3% he still walks away with $660,000 in his pocket. Very smart!"
Of course. It's two years during which you can get your money back. It's also two years during which you can fall in love - and most people don't need that much.
How many pre-ordered other electric trucks?
It was the same with The model 3 and that’s doing very well now
"Who just throws a non-refundable $100 deposit at something on the off chance they will buy it?

Not to say that those people don’t exist, but quite frankly I don’t think more than 10% of these orders are going to go unfulfilled."
"It's true that pre-orders don't mean sales, but going by Model 3 the number of pre-orders maintained itself, people dropped their pre-orders, others joined and it maintained it's size"
"It doesn't disprove anything at all, but I'd have ordered and paid for one on the spot if I had the money and the option was available."
"This is true. While I love the Cybertruck and will proceed with my order in 2022/2023 should I afford it by that time, our initial plan was for a Tesla Y/3 (according to Spring 2020 availability) followed by a Tesla Van we can make into a living /r/vandwellers thing... Seeing that the van would be 5-6 years away at the bare minimum -if it ever comes- the Cybertruck with its origami tent and the option to have it connect to a camper is the next best thing, so I went ahead and put $100 down because of nothing more than a 'maybe, why not'."
this $100 pre order is a thing for tech bro's to screenshot their order page and to post on social media for likes/outrage.
That’s $20m added before the end of the year. It’s a cash flow play.
"Whatever he loses, he'll still have several hundred thousand or million more than me. Plus his brand name and pedigree. Personal risk of an entirely different level for us regular folks."
"looking at the Model 3 i don't think that driving speeds and cooling capacity are in realtion to each other any more. S and X needed driving speed for cooling, M3 has an active coolingsystem. you can sometimes hear it when you drive fast for a while and get limited. or just watch some of the ""autobahn"" videos from that bjorn... on youtube."
"Hello, fellow powertrain engineer"
"Exactly this. Just by the nature of the cybertruck being electric the batteries are going to make it a heavier vehicle. As long as each vehicles tires are similar, whatever vehicle weighs more is going to ""win"" this test. 

Ford would have to bring out their electric truck, as i'm sure any Gas powered F-150 with specs similar to the cyber truck weighs less, and will lose this test."
I don't even know if a super duty could win this one.  The torque numbers are not even remotely close.
What is this statement based on?
Seems fair.  Otherwise it's like your JV team vs our varsity team.
Get the top of the line non-dually ford truck put the same tires on both trucks and humiliate it.
"More that Elon being Elon, I could see him escalating and pounding it into the ground to make a point."
haha.. that's a great idea!!
I sure hope this becomes a thing with all EV trucks and semis with all that available space on a 53' trailer.  Is solar tech moving forward at all in efficiency?  Still seems to lag behind in terms of converting power to batteries.

"The entire reason the had the truck outside was for filming promo video, of course there was a camera crew.  I’m saying that the tug of war might have been impromptu/not well planned.  If it was planned, then it wasn’t well thought out, or wasn’t intended to be an even fight."

Life lesson.
They used the dual motor. Pick any $49k F150 and it'll get drug.
F150? You're lying
"Well I mean it's a biproduct of many things that are needed. What it comes down to is if you want to have a Tesla then you need to drill and refine the crude. Which means you might as well do something with the gas. It's like making chicken you can throw away the broth but if it hold value then sell it. 
I didn't understand this till I worked in a refinery... Also they make stupid money."
Nobody uses a F150 where hauling for money over time OTR. For that the space is wide open between the 250 range trucks and semi trucks.
Wow. Own that fuck up lol.

"> LOL, first tesla is redoing the test with a 4x4 loaded in the back. Second, this first test is not meaningless, it showed how terrible a stock f-150 is. 

Indeed, it showed how terrible a purposely poorly equipped $35k truck is vs. a $50k+ truck. Well played. If Tesla redoes it as you said, that would be grand. 

> If you have to load your f-150 up with 2 thousand pounds of sand just to tow its max capacity, that is sad. 

That *would* be sad. Luckily you don't because that's not how literally any truck works and I can't believe someone actually thinks that. Tongue weight is a thing and no, you can't just concoct a scenario where there is zero tongue weight because that's insanely dangerous."

There are many reasons they did the tug of war video with a Ford.

"Not that I don’t love EVs, but I want to defend BMW here specifically.

My previous car was a 2017 BMW M240xi. (AWD) With some aftermarket parts and a tune it was putting out 400HP at the wheels on the dyno. With Michelin Pilot SuperSport tires I could NOT spin those wheels until they were worn down to about 3/32nd. That includes doing a launch control start on wet pavement. I honestly think it’s one of the best ICE cars on the market currently, in that configuration."

"To be fair, it can be kind of hard to tell with Elon.

He does blur the line between fiction, fantasy and reality pretty regularly.

He does ~~own~~ run a rocket company 🤷‍♂️"
"Lmao. One company used a production spec vehicle (with added roll cage and weight offset) with stock tyres, that is already being produced and posted a full video of it. The other company used a highly modified prototype with tons of aftermarket stuff including custom made ultra leightweigt rims and high performance tyres that last maybe 3000 miles and are dangerous to use in daily traffic when it is raining, posted no proof of their time and the car is more than a year away from production. But both are the same. This is absurd."
"> It was reported by people there and Elon confirmed it.

That seems reliable.

> Trust me. When Tesla has finalized lap times, they’ll announce it with a video and etc.

Seems like they’re taking their time. Why don’t they just time it, post the video and just be done with it? There’s no need to publish “theoretical lap time” from extrapolated data or from a random photographer by the side of the track.

The whole thing is childish anyway. People buy the Model S for different reasons compared to Taycan, and it shows by how the Taycan can immediately be used for track days without prepping and abused over and over again. Doesn’t mean the Model S is inferior. Model S is already a damn good car for what it is. No need to “beat” something that it isn’t."
"Actually, [weight is just about the only relevant factor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzKCJsou10w). The Cybertruck is heavier, so it wins."

what are the worst aspects of driving around in a big truck?
"as a big fan of the cybertruck, camping I think (and this is entirely personally since this is my own personal use case) is one where the ICE definitely wins out. When I go camping I don't camp 20mins outside of town, I drive 4hrs-12hrs away to a nice lake/park (I live in Canada in the prairies, I like swimming in clear water, so it usually means trekking to BC) already that means I'm probably going to have to charge 1-4 times for the trip, each way, as opposed to a single gas stop, plus by the fact that I'm camping I will inherently be stopping in a place where theres no way to charge since I'll be in the forest, so even if I stay there for a couple days I'll be leaving with only a partially charged battery and no fast charger anywhere close. 

its one of the few cases where it hits both of the cybertrucks shortfalls for me which, in my eyes, are range and charging availability.

with that said, I only camp 3-4 times a year, so I could still use the cybertruck for 99% of my other activities, and I could just use my ICE vehicle for it, and I'm not going to make a vehicle purchase based off of something that I do only 3-4 times a ***year***"
"they've done nothing that makes me think it would be better off road. the approach, standover height, and departure angles are not as good as a stock jeep. camping offers nothing more than a regular truck except a 120v outlet. they could have used a midgate to allow the HVAC to be used in the bed. they could have made the bed shape such that it can fit a normal camper. the tesla truck has only disadvantages relative to an F150 with a battery pack for camping. put a couple grand in tires and lift, and a cheap 4wd F150 will outperform the cybertruck in both offroad and camping. Tesla chose aero and car-like handling over offroad and camping.  I was hoping for 2-3ft of variable height, not ±4inches. I was hoping for a connection from the cabin like a Chevy Avalanche. I was hoping the cabin was going to be farther forward so they could keep the same wheelbase and bed length while having the wheels closer to the edges of the truck (like a jeep).

a lot could change in 2 years, but so far they're prioritizing road performance over off-road/camping. that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's a design decision."

"[engineering explained](https://youtu.be/jzKCJsou10w) did a nice video on it. On top of that,  you can use the transfer case on a Ford 4x4 to multiply the torque by almost 3 (which I agree is pretty impractical for towing, but useful nonetheless in a tug of war). Given that the top trim F150 makes 510 foot pounds at the crank multiplied many times by the drivetrain, you have some serious torque."
"Except an F350 has 6 wheels so its got more traction lol, plus MAX TORQUE 1050lb/ft is available at 1600rpm in the 6.7L powerstroke. Achieveable at a standstill with an 1800 stall torque converter that they come with. 

Your same idea applies to cars that need 4k rpm to make power...

...But diesel trucks were literally designed for just that lol. They can make full engine torque from a standstill on 6 tires, breaking traction on all 6 when necessary.

NOT TO MENTION....

The F350 has a part time transfer case with a 2.71:1 reduction low range box in it for even more torque multiplication. Whereas the CT is AWD.

An F350 is also an 11,000lb truck. Probably double the weight of the CT.

In a battle for traction at less than 5mph; the F350 still wins."
"The 6.7L powerstroke can reach max torque from a standstill because max torque is available within the stall rpm of the torque converter. 1050lb/ft at 1600rpm. 

Because theyre designed for pulling...

An F350 also has 6 wheels and weighs 11,000lbs, probably double the weight of the Cybertruck.

I'm not confusing tow capacity with pulling... Just implying something *capable* of towing 37,000lbs reliably for 100k miles can PROBABLY pull something rated for pulling 14,000lbs... Given that our biggest inhibitor is traction, and an F350 weighs twice as much..."
"Also just noticed the dual vs tri motor difference.

Lmao Im a truck guy man I dont know the difference! I know 40k vs 70k...

And that being said;

$40k still gets an F250 4x4 with the 7.3L gas V8 making max torque at 1800rpm, weighing 9900lbs. 

Whats the Cybertruck weigh? 6000?"
"I get it. My point is, people seem to be buying into the narrative that all trucks are now luxury vehicles and cost a fortune and don't do much performance wise. The truth is, the vast majority of trucks aren't that. The vast majority of trucks are utilitarian and offer tremendous performance for a ""reasonable"" price. I admit that $55,000 is a lot of money but that get's you a huge towing capacity and 4x4 and a pretty nice truck all around with a decent resale value. 

Seriously though, look around at trucks next time you're out and about. Sure, you're going to see some fancy looking trucks that clearly aren't used as trucks but most of the trucks you will see aren't that."
"My simple point is at the price and performance level, the basis of comparison for the tri-motor Cybertruck isn't a light-duty truck (F 150, Silverado 1500, Ram 1500). The basis for comparison is a medium-duty truck (F 250, Silverado 2500, Ram 2500)."
"Almost every F250 in my company has trouble free 200-250K being driven, trashed, and on rough oilfield roads. After those 250K miles, we sell them to auction houses.

These are work trucks, not trophy trucks like your Ford Raptor or CT.

I don't think you know much, if anything about how hard these trucks, especially the Ford superduty trucks are worked out here in the middle of nowhere in the tundra, mountains, deserts, rain, snow, mud in subzero temperatures and in 120F temperatures. I can assure you, the CT will never be worked as hard, even clpse to as hard. It will be a grocery getter and occasional offroading vehicle."
"Damn I didnt even know the limited trim existed... 

...Thats so overpriced lmao. Prolly pulls less than a Lariat or XLT, too.

Yeah thats in the same buyer market as the cybertruck for sure."
That math makes sense. Total cost of ownership definitely needs to be factored in.
"For me, that worked out. This really depends on your financial situation though."
Great way to end up old and unable to enjoy it.
"I assume Tesla would still win as well, but my point being that if they did it fairly it will not show the same margin difference as shown in the video they made. That’s important."
"I’ve had it for 2 years and I’m still afraid of chipping it. (I should probably get it clearbra’d tbh) or even damaging the wheels or tires etc. it’s my prized possession tbh and I’m extremely ADHD when it comes to aesthetics and perfection in my vehicles. 

I haven’t test driven it but I know it’ll be a nicer drive than my 250 if it’s anywhere in the same ballpark as any Tesla I’ve driven. 

Honestly, I do like it. It surprised me as first but I thought back to everything Elon has said and it wasn’t really a surprise after that. Definitely better looking than the Rivian. That thing looks like something I would never drive. 

What I like the most, is that it’s something new, not refurbished. The look of it makes sense when you consider the materials used, Elon explained it in a tweet. I love the idea that people are going to be curious about it when I get down, more so than think it’s ugly. And I’ve always been a fan of hyper futuristic looking vehicles, like the ones in cyberpunk of blade runner. I definitely prefer it over the roundy ness of the Model 3, for example. But those are just my personal opinions.

"The Tesla Model S got like 200,000+ reservations. And it was a $1000 deposit, not $100."
Is the preorder the same? $100 refundable? Truly asking cuz I don’t know.
Lol but with the design of the i3 would you really want that? I wish they did more with the i8. It’s a sexy ass looking car but not up to today’s standards
"Plus, Tesla made $20 million in 1 day of preorders. Even if a bunch of those get refunded, between now and Day 0 of production, he has >$20 million that he can leverage to help build his infrastructure and whatever else he needs to ramp up production."
"I ordered it Thursday night on a lark, fully not expecting that I'd ultimately get the thing.  But I've gotta tell you, just 3 or 4 days later that crazy truck-like vehicle is seriously growing on me and I think I'd really like to pick this thing up when available.  It's remarkable to me how quickly my personal attitude changed from recoiling in horror to really digging the thing.  I wonder if anyone else is going thru that."
"I also think there are a lot of people like me out there-I haven’t preordered but I fully plan on getting one someday. Between buying an X and two 3’s I’ve learned preordering and being an early buyer does you no good. They come out with the better deals, options, free supercharging, etc months after initial release."

"That’s what I was thinking! Like, my one friend was excited for a whole 10 minutes when I told him I was getting one, everybody thinks their ugly but CT fans, so it’s not really a bragging right to say you bought an economically priced electric truck...."
"People who simply want the option of buying with little to no risk/obligation. As someone else put it, even if there is only a very slim chance you'd want one, $100 is borderline free. If there was a 1% chance you'd want one, you might as well put down a pre-order so you can get it sooner rather than later.

Ask for several thousand dollar deposits and see how many you get..."
"I remember people saying that with the Model 3. Lots of reservations but most of those people will never actually buy them!

I am certain there are some who pre-ordered just to say they did but I bet it's a small minority."
You’re underestimating bragging on social media.
I have a ton of friends who did because it's fully refundable.  It's only $100 dude
"I have a co-worker who put in an order for all 3 trims, another 2 that ordered it as a just in case thing. Another friend of mine ordered it as a prank to upset his wife even if he has no intention of buying it. 

I think a lot ordered it as a legit thing but a lot of people did order it for the Instagram flex or as a just in case."
People who intend to sell their spot when it comes up and there's still a huge backlog.  That $100 now could probably fetch $2500 on down the road.
"My coworker ordered all of the models, but can only buy one “maybe”.  He currently doesn’t have a house and is looking at small houses with small garages and limited street/driveway parking.  I think people want one but I think the number of orders are definitely higher than actual buyers."
"I accidentally ordered two because I got server errors. I haven’t canceled the second one, and I damn sure don’t need two of them. It’s $100, I’ll get it back eventually."
"Everyone did it with the model 3? They shot through the preorders because of all the people who dropped it when they were called up. Of course the model 3 sold well, but if the preorders were bad on that why would they be better here?"

"I preordered it, it’s only 100 dollars so if I do decide I want it I’m already in line and if I don’t it’s no big deal it’s refundable."
I would bet the numbers are greatly inflated compared to actual purchases. I ordered 3 because I’m not sure which configuration I’ll want but I wanted to get in queue. I’m not going to actually buy 3 trucks.
Exactly. I want one...but I still haven't done the $100 because I just don't have it floating around right now.
When it literally costs $100 refundable?  Plenty of people.
"Not really preordered, just a reservation.  I haven’t as I really do not expect to buy one and I already have a model 3.  But for $100, I might place a reservation, “just in case”.  I mean, if I put it in the bank, by the time the CT is delivered I would have $106, so it is a tough choice /s"
A lot of people. It’s fun to claim to have a reservation. Effectively costs nothing. And leaves an option on the table to order in the future. FOMO.
"I preordered it because late 2021 is when I anticipate I’ll need a new car. Might not, in which case I’ll cancel. Might need a car sooner, in which case I’ll cancel. $100 fully refundable isn’t too much to ask for"
"Are you kidding? It's 2 years away and costs $100 to reserve a spot in line. It can/will change design/specs in that time frame - you have a general clue what the final product should be, that's it. You aren't committed to buying the truck. It's refundable. And $100 is peanuts compared to $40/50/60k."
The Model 3 was also the first time that you could get a new Tesla for under 40k. People who don't even really want sedans bought Model 3s.
"As broke as I am, I would have paid it! I see this truck as a HEAVY investment into my future. And as someone who was literally kicking my feet at the thought of having to buy a new truck this year.. looks like I’ll be roughing it another year or so!"

"After typing this all out I think all you asked for was [the progress of solar cell efficiency](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/CellPVeff%28rev191101%29.png/1920px-CellPVeff%28rev191101%29.png)

I think if the cover is solar it won't be much, the 'maybe 15 miles a day' I think will be more like 5-10 miles including vampire drain. [Solar trailers](https://www.oksolar.com/lion/Item/000777000/solar-trailer) can come in lots of [sizes](https://www.mobilesolarpower.net/products/ms-series-solar-generators/) and ~5 minute research says [6kWh](https://www.mobilesolarpower.net/products/ms-series-solar-generators/ms-150/) to [48kWh](https://www.mobilesolarpower.net/products/sa-series/). I am not sure a ground mount and all the panels needed for 48kWh would fit in the bed of the CT (with the top down for areo), maybe 24kWh - 28kWh might. Assuming you went camping for 3 full days and 3mi per kWh you could get 216 - 252 miles. If you can combine the ground mount and solar as your tent posts and roof it isn't so bad. If you are driving around in the woods those says you will need to bring some batteries and factor in the energy loss due to DC(panel) -> AC -> DC(powerwall) -> AC -> DC(CT).

The previous statement was just throwing money and surface area at the problem. If you were asking how much more efficient solar can get it looks like the [68.7%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell_efficiency). Looks like [the best we can currently do is 48%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/CellPVeff%28rev191101%29.png/1920px-CellPVeff%28rev191101%29.png) but unless we bring a lab camping or raid SpaceX/NASA for their panels some research says [18.7% to 19.6%](https://www.thesolarnerd.com/blog/solar-shingles/). So we could POSSIBLY get 3x the amount of energy per panel, in reality looks more like 2x some time in the future.

Still easier than trying to refine your own gas or make ethanol while camping or at home."

"Nah. Crews is the kind of black guy Reddit loves because he is humble, docile, overly friendly, not a threat in any way. Not necessarily bad things but...

NDT represents an intellectual freedom, the dare to be much better than you with no need to hide it by being humble, which is the real threat. 

Reddit loves blacks that say they are grateful and humble. The implication being, know your place. 

Blacks (and women) who don't follow that are instead labeled loud, obnoxious, ungrateful, abrasive, angry by ""Reddit"".

Reddit will love a guy like Mark Cuban and hate NDT.

"F-450 base MSRP is $49k.

Or, if you want to be pedantic, an F-350 that's well equipped will run about $50k

F-450 would completely demolish the Cybertruck
1,000+ lb-ft will do that. F-350 would also probably win based on the fact it has six wheels.

Nevermind the fact it's a stupid test to begin with."
Super duty. It’s the f250. With diesel. Read what I wrote.
"I mean, yeah If you’re hauling a gooseneck or something big, that’s true, but there are a ton of hotshot drivers and smaller commercial outfits that use 150’s. 

But as an example, a couple weeks ago I bought a project vehicle about 300 miles away. I picked it up with a 18 foot hd trailer. Combined weight was about 9k lbs. 

I used our Tundra to haul the trailer up and back. Used about 2 tanks of gas. Had I been in the Cyber truck, I’m not exactly sure how I’d get to the car, because it was risky distance from the nearest supercharger, but even so, I would have had to charge up 3 times to make that trip.  Assuming that was possible with the Supercharger network, I would have had to disconnect the trailer 3 times to charge, and wait 30 minutes minimum 3 times (from experience in my MS). 

That’s not exactly convenient.  

Where I see EV trucks being really stellar is actually in government fleet. City Services don’t necessarily go that far each day, but need to carry a bunch of stuff in a low cost vehicle with minimal maintenance. Granted, CT is more than double the cost of a fleet F150, but costs will come down as other vendors enter the market. 

They could be invaluable in the fire service as well (semi too), since fire apparatus and chief’s vehicles spend most of their lives parked at a station between calls. The trucks are typically plugged in to 110v anyway to power the laptop and accessories when the engine is off, so it’d just be a minor infrastructure change. I’d love to see an electric fire truck, with an electric pump. Give it 5 hours of operating time between charges, and you’re more than covered for 98% of situations because it’ll be plugged back in between calls."
"Not really. I'm picking up a car this weekend and it's about a 15 hr drive to get it. My time isn't worth a ton but the Cybertruck would easily double the length of my trip, even in the $70k spec. 

I'm not hauling for money but I also don't want this trip to take four days."
Thats a good thing though.
Truck Dynasty I’m dead
Wow that had me laughing.
"Which would be 8 inches of travel, although as others have pointed out it is more likely adjustment of ride height and travel is something else."

"If it ain't official, it ain't official."
"Great, please share a link to the official website with the lap time then."
"It's credible, but it's not official."
"Looks like you have trouble finding the official lap times page? No problem!

I'll help you out buddy; here it is:  [https://www.nuerburgring.de/en/fans-info/info/record-drives-lap-times-nuerburgring.html](https://www.nuerburgring.de/en/fans-info/info/record-drives-lap-times-nuerburgring.html) 

Eagerly awaiting your copy paste of the official Taycan lap time here!"
"Neither was official, ergo both were unofficial."
"Oh no no. 

They’re not testing the Model S at the track. Tesla is working on a new Model S. They’re calling it Plaid. It’s a prototype and they’re pushing its limit. It’s suppose to be the most expensive Model S version. It’s meant to target people who buy the fastest cars (like the Taycan)."
"I will say, it’s is a fair advantage to have a 50/50 split vs whatever the F150 is. But regardless, as you said; I think this test was stacked from the beginning due to weight alone."
"It's not so much the motors but rather the batteries.

Tesla's motors are around 100lbs.  The F150 engine weighs about 7000lbs."
"6’3”, we took home a Chrysler Pacifica and with my seat in the correct position we couldn’t get a rear facing car seat in the second row. Was a real surprise. We had more room in our at the time 2014 Ford Flex (which despite the views of some on exterior appearance, was an outstanding family vehicle). 

If I moved my seat forward of course it fit, but was snug and I was less comfortable, which isn’t ideal for a long trip vehicle. 

With the F-150 I can have my seat wherever I want, kids have a mile of room behind me, and even with kids in place someone can walk in the space between them and my seat.  It’s just an incredible vehicle for interior room as long as you don’t need more than five seats. 

I think the Chrysler suffered from the stow and go seating, because you couldn’t slide the second row forward/back like we could in the Flex or most other suvs and that. Either way, I love the F-150, fuel mileage compared to a minivan aside. 

I’m looking forward to the Model Y though. It should be out when my wife and I would be moving to new vehicles in a couple years. By then the kids will be in booster seats and the second row legroom won’t be as critical."
Awww okay.
"Turning, parking, large blind spots, tight spaces. 


It doesn't seem like much but you have to think more while doing mundane tasks.   It's going to have a large turning radius. 


If you live in a spacious area no biggie. If you live in a cramp mountain area it adds a burden to commuting and getting around"
"You must be in an extremely unique situation where you are the 0.0001% where a 500+ mile EV isn't enough. Because I have a tough time imagining a situation where you'd only have to fill up a ICE vehicle once during the trip, but the 500 mile Cybertruck would need up to 4 charges each way (up to 8 times total) during the trip like you say. So maybe if you're only looking at the Base Cybertruck, I'd understand, but otherwise, nah. 

Like even if you travel at a constant 65mph starting with a full charge from your house, you'd be able to travel for over 7.5 hours in the Cybertruck. So if you travel 12 hours from your house to get to the destination (like you said), that'd be MAX of 2 charges total for the entire roundtrip (you start with 500 miles and can arrive back at home with 0)... Really not that crazy for a 1500 mile camping trip. What this IS is an indictment of the charging infrastructure in the area, because the superchargers are only located along the southern border of Canada, with the most northwest one being in Edmonton. Like if you're doing 24 hours of driving roundtrip, spending 2 hours charging seems reasonable to me given you are going to be saving quite a bit on gas. Granted this is just simplified numbers, but still. 

Still that doesn't make this a bad camping vehicle. It just means they need to continue building out the superchargers, and other 3rd party companies need to install more as well. Once that happens, 400-500 miles of range is more than enough for any situation."
"Because there are **aggressively** pedantic people on Reddit who need to correct people’s posts even though nobody was confused about what I was saying, and I give them opportunities to feel superior to others by letting them correct innocuous details nobody needed clarification on.

You’re welcome."
"the 450 is the dually version and even then the front two wheels aren't doing anything for traction as they are rear wheel drive unless you spring for all wheel but now your 450 is around the tri motor price. Oh and I checked Fords website, they don't offer a dually version nor option on the 350 (checked on both the low end and high end standard offering packages) 
  
Yes your 6.7L turbo diesel has a low rpm for it's max torque, but its still high them am electric and going from 700-800 to 1600 takes a lot more time than it does for electric go reach it's max torque.   
  
The CT is estimated to be north of 6000 lbs  
  
In a tug of war, the 350 at best ties, 450 who knows as that would need a tri motor for an equal price point with what you mentioned."
I hope a 50k+ vehcile has a decent resale value.
"> Almost every F250 in my company has trouble free 200-250K being driven, trashed, and on rough oilfield roads. After those 250K miles, we sell them to auction houses.

I assume they are maintained during this time, no?

[Tesla motors are hitting 1 million miles](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/10/16/tesla-model-3-motor-gearbox-survive-1-million-miles-of-testing/) and [the batteries appear to soon follow.](https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-may-soon-have-a-battery-that-can-last-a-million-miles/). 

Those F250’s are the best that model that Ford can make after several decades of production. Tesla is setting up to make a better, more efficient, more durable, and longer-lasting truck as their first shot at it."
"$55k is the base RWD config for the Platinum, and the prices goes up from there depending on the packages and options. My local Ford dealer has 4x4 Platinums configured on their lot for $67,020 and Ford’s site shows Limiteds starting at $67,480. 

Anyway, of course the Cybertruck is too expensive for some F-150 buyers. Nobody is going to argue that. 

There’s a market for trucks that are capable but are also zero emission. Proving Cybertruck can outperform the best selling pickup in the country is a logical way to show how capable zero emissions can be. Not every F-150 customer will switch to electric, but there are PLENTY of customers who want utility, performance, and capability without a tailpipe."
Great way to end up old and not fucked over by surprise medical bills.
I agree it would have been a better statement if they put it up against a Raptor which would check off all the powertrain and performance parameters except for weight but also costs a fair amount more.
I didn't know that.  I would never have even thought to look up brutality in the context to car designs.
"From what I can tell, there are two reasons. 

1) They’re an established electric car maker. Everyone else looks like they’re “kicking around the idea”, with 1 or 2 models that consumers **hope** will have long-term support. 

2) Tesla has a large charging network and can use everyone else’s chargers. 


I think the idea is who cares if *company x* makes a fantastic car if their charging network is awful? What the US needs to do is standardize electric chargers. This way we don’t end up with Ford/Mercedes/Porsche/whoever all building their own walled-garden charging networks. We did it with gasoline in the past, and we should try to create a national network for chargers that are compatible for everyone."
Also the i3 is particularly unattractive. The Tesla’s are generally nice looking and known for being quick and fun to drive. The i3 is a weird box
">  because they’re the first “major” all-electric automotive manufacturer who’s doing it, and for reasonable prices I guess?

Its not just this. Its that (truck aside) they made sexy cars.  Not these boxy stupid e-cars with tiny little tires. They made sports cars that are FAST and they went after the BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, Audi markets- people who want STYLE.  Not to mention had to foresight to build a world wide charging network."
"Yeah, if they would only make one :)"
"Not just the first. They own the entire market. Tesla has 3 models you can buy now, 2 models on their way (Model Y and Cybertruck) along with orders for the Semi Truck which has only been seen testing and making Beer runs.

While the only competitors are a nice looking, but small compact hatchback Chevy Bolt and what was originally a tonka truck at first then eventually became the second gen Nissan Leaf. These are not competitors, but just rushed to market cars to fill a gap. No one is really competing with Tesla while everyone else keeps on showing us their future cars and touting they can compete, but have not release anything competitive. I can't wait for the more main stream vehicles to be electrified. It will bring down the costs and also cause us to realize our electric infrastructure cannot support the influx of electric cars without upgrades. But that is another story."
Hella maintenance yet Tesla is rated one of the worst in reliablity across the entire car industy.
"If you pre-order something that is 40 or 60 to 100 (model S) grand it really should not matter of the deposit is 100 or 1000 $

"He can use the cash flow, but cannot use it as ""revenue""."
"Same here with the attitude. My initial recoil was much less than I've seen on other people (after five seconds in I was more like ""seriously? Now everyone's gonna meme this to oblivion""), but honestly, the moment it rolled on stage I was a bit disappointed. Now, though, it's starting to look awesome to me, especially compared to existing trucks. Just look on the image in the post, the F-150 just looks dated.

I hated the Model 3 at first, it was like discount Model S to me. Later though, when I saw what it was capable of, and it put some meaning behind its looks, the same design somehow turned beautiful. Now I think it's one of the best-looking cars out there. I think it's the same effect as the ""symphony"" of an engine, it's a jarring sound, but you know the power it means."
"That is called the power of commitment. It’s easy to get someone to make a small commitment and a small commitment leads to a bigger commitment. It’s a psychological trick that salespeople use all the time. They get you to sign a pledge or something before asking you for real money. 

Legacy car dealers are notorious for it. You’re sitting there negotiating with the front line guy who has no authority. He keeps running back to an office to talk to the “guy in charge”. You eventually get to a number you are willing to pay. He just has to get approval from the boss. He writes the number down on a blank piece of paper and asks you to sign. It doesn’t mean anything. He says he just needs to show the boss that you will agree to that number if they offer it. You sign because it doesn’t mean anything. They come back with that number and you buy. 

The whole scenario above seems pretty silly. They do it that way because they have a higher conversion rate after people sign that meaningless piece of paper. Maybe you’re having second thoughts because the whole negotiation was a whirlwind. But they come back with the number. Your number that you signed. You made a small commitment. It’s legally meaningless, but it’s psychologically powerful. Despite second thoughts, people will eventually sign the real contract because of the small prior commitment. 

This trick is used everywhere. Girl Scout cookies, Yankee Candle, basically every fundraiser, business, etc. If you have purchasing authority in your company you’re probably asked with some regularity to sign some kind of proposal from a new vendor that’s not legally binding before you’re issued an invoice."
Same
"> I wonder if anyone else is going thru that.

\*Raises hand\*

Had a ""WTF"" moment when it first rolled out, and all through the presentation. My brother called me immediately after, and we shared our WTF moment amongst ourselves. Then two hours later, as I was reading some more info about it, I thought ""you know, this could actually be okay, and for only $100, well..."" and I preordered. And now, several days later, I'm fully smitten. I really hope they expand the design to the rest of their lineup, as I have zero use for a truck, but love love love the design.

Also my brother finally preordered this AM. So I think it just takes different people different lengths of time to come around."
I hated it. It has now grown on me with the CT fans PS colors on it. I am not going to preorder on because my current 2005 F-250 4x4 6.0L is paid off and running just fine. The CT bed does not have the flexibility and usability my Ford has. Honda did the funky bed on their first edition truck. Now it has more of the standard bed rail design. I will wait for CT 2.0.
"Yup. Took me 24 hours to finish watching the roll out.

But even during the roll out my initial reaction was softened as I looked at it from different angles and perspectives.

Now I'm like. Damn this is a blade runner truck and the future is now."
"Same here. I don't know if I'll be afford a car in two years, or if I'd pick this or a Model 3, but if my life does go that way, this truck simply looks awesome. And I never once thought of myself as a truck person."

Now you have 2 years to think about it though. You will be a lot more mentally and financially ready to make that purchase than if you didn’t reserve.
"> Ask for several thousand dollar deposits and see how many you get...

Speaking of such.. how many deposits did Model Y get at $2,500? I’d wager not as many as Cybertruck, and I’d wager if Cybertruck was $2,500 they would have gotten less deposits than the Model Y."
"They got over 500,000 $1000 Model 3 deposits."
That's true but they have already sold way more Model 3s than they had preorders for.
Tons of your friends with no intention of buying the truck preordered it?
your friends and cow-orkers have too much disposable income
"Selling your spot isn't allowed by Tesla. You can do all sort of tricks around this, but those who did found there isn't much demand for a markup to skip the line."
at 6% less value due to inflation.  Intrest-free negative-loan.
"I think the problem is more like discrediting the preorders with the implication that the truck won't sell well. Yeah, it's 300k preorders, not 300k sales, that's a very different thing. But this thing is selling preorders better than the Model 3. That alone shows it's gonna be just as successful as the Model 3 is, much stronger than faint theories about the price point."
You probably shouldn't buy a $40k+ truck if you can't float a $100 deposit..
Don’t forget model 3 qualified for full federal tax credit.
">new Tesla for under 40k. People who don't even really want sedans bought Model 3s.

I was one of those.

As early pre-order didn't have choice on ordering cheaper option, unless waiting long time, and was very happy w/paying the extra once I realized what I was getting.

I would've preferred a suv/crossover (Model Y) but also couldn't wait for the new car.

1.5yrs+ owner now & best vehicle purchase decision ever made."
Yeah Model 3 wasn’t hard to sell besides being electric.  the wtf polytruck took everyone by surprise with those preorders.
"I'm not arguing with you, just providing additional evidence regarding how obvious it is."
"Yup - and I don’t see anyone flexing a Cybertruck deposit there. (We likely follow different people, however) And anyone who did would be doing so with everyone knowing it was just a $100 refundable deposit.

I mean, I know it’s cool to think that social media people are vapid garbage who flex on everything and whatnot, but let’s at least see it happen to some degree before we declare that it is happening and accounts for thousands or tens of thousands of preorders."
"> He can’t touch the money until the car is being produced

"Apples to oranges. We'll see how well the mach-e is recieved, then you can compare that to the model Y.

It’s a liability on the books. Not their money.
"It is not revenue. That is correct. 

But They Can spendvthe cash on gigafactories or toiletpaper or whatever They want. The money is not blocked."
Is that still the case if they’re non refundable?
"In my understanding that's only half true. It's for sure not revenue, but I'm not aware of any law that requires it to be held in a trust account or held separately. This isn't a house deposit where there are specific laws.

It's merely a liability that they have to have sufficient cash available to pay as and when it falls due (in this case a refund request) same as any debt."
"You can also hear it when you select ludicrous mode, it turns on preemptively."
"From what I found it's around 300KG heavier than the ford but as they both have different versions it's hard to have an exact number, also we would probably need to pick both cars by similar price, AWD and similar weight for it to be a reasonable comparison."
"At what RPM? Electric motor torque maxes early and tapers off while the ICE starts low and then gets better.

I wouldn't be surprised if perfectly equal weighted trucks with the same tires would favor the EV even if there was a 5% foot pound disadvantage."
Difference is where that peak torque is available though
That’s peak torque. What’s the Superduty’s torque at 0mph? Because the Tesla’s is 1000lb-ft.
Electric motors can also be over-driven for short periods as well. The cybertruck may be able to push closer to 1400lb-ft for a few seconds by dumping extra current into the motors.
Tesla is not the only one building electric motors.
"Ford does not currently sell a truck (apples to apples) with the amount of HP or Torque required to beat the Tesla given equal footing (same size / brand tires). 

Yeah it might not be as extreme a win (thus not as good a video for the presentation) but it should still win."

He had this tweet mentally planned out weeks ago and hoped that dragging their flagship truck up a hill would get a response.
And yet one was relevant to a car you can buy and is in production and the other is just a concept car so far.
"> It’s a prototype and they’re pushing its limit.

Okay then they should time the pre-production prototype (just like the timed Taycan) with production interior, production aero kits (bumper, skirts, splitter, diffuser, wing) and production tyres. Only then they can publicly brag about their lap times. And if they can do it over and over again without losing performance and overheat like the Taycan that would be another great achievement.

> It’s suppose to be the most expensive Model S version. It’s meant to target people who buy the fastest cars

The Taycan used for the lap time is not even the Turbo S version, which should be faster. I’d be happy if they beat the Taycan fair and square, it’s just that the way they are conducting this whole thing is improper and unprofessional."
turning radius will probably be the biggest bummer if I get one.
"Absolutely which is why I wanted to point out that it was an ***entirely*** personal problem and I was definitely choosing it's minimum range version and adjusting for the fact that we have very little infrastructure for any supercharging so I was basing it on strictly charging at 120v for ~1-2hr charges so only topping up, not sticking around for fully recharging. Just short road trip lunch style top ups. Also why I used ***1***-4 charge stops depending on model version. And also why I pointed out that it was in refrence to charging availability.

As well I'll reiterate that these specific circumstances would never keep me from buying an EV as making a large purchase decision based on the 1% of my car usage is ridiculous. I say the same thing to some of my ""nothing but diesel in my truck"" co-workers. Are there circumstances where  an EV won't work? Sure, but are you really going to not buy a car that's perfect/better than ICE for 99% of your car usages just because it doesn't work in the 1% of usages? That's just dumb."
"I'll bite - the range thing is a huge deal for me too. I regularly do 8 hour drives without an opportunity to charge at the destination, turn around and drive home. Cybertruck should do it ok with a high range version and good weather, but winters around here get cold. Like below zero F cold. So if you eat 20-40% of the range for heat it starts to look a lot more sucky vs an F-150 with 800km of range in a tank. If I can't charge at my destination that even means I'm using even more battery juice to pre-warm after a cold soak. And I'm not driving an 8hr trip in my down jacket and pants with the heater off just to get more range.

I'm hoping the solar version of the tonneau will take the edge off and will likely just haul a gas generator with me to plug in while I'm off grid; at least that should give a little extra juice at destination to make it back to a supercharger.

Final note - I think it will kick ass offroad. Almost 6"" more ground clearance than a stock Tacoma with better entry/departure angles and now worry about water ingestion for the air intake? F Yeah!"

You’d be surprised how many don’t! Many luxury cars don’t hold their value well at all.
">There’s a market for trucks that are capable but are also zero emission. Proving Cybertruck can outperform the best selling pickup in the country is a logical way to show how capable zero emissions can be. Not every F-150 customer will switch to electric, but there are PLENTY of customers who want utility, performance, and capability without a tailpipe.

My argument is simply that market is extremely small or doesnt exist. 

I drive a truck, all my friends drive trucks, and I work with a truck. Ive never even driven a car. From a truck buyer's perspective, fuel economy is one of the *last things* we think about when purchasing. Its ALL about capability, luxury, and price. In that order. 

That being said, I think the Cybertruck could have a market for people who normally would drive a car or SUV for fuel economy reasons, but wants the capability of a truck. 

For people who already drive trucks, especially HD trucks, emissions is irrelevent. Nobody buys an F150 for fuel economy. They might choose the F150 over a Silverado because of fuel economy; but never solely because of emissions reasons. Its illogical, trucks are horrible on fuel.

So care free in fact the EPA has a huge problem with people sawing off their diesel exhausts to make the engines last longer. Because drivetrain longevity *is what truck drivers care about*, over emissions. 

The pickup truck market is *not* like the car market. People are extreme brand loyalists and getting anyone to switch over would be impossible. 

I can see the truck having sales in typical car buyers, though."

"I remember reading or hearing something to the extent where it doesn’t even matter if Tesla fails with selling cars because they’ve already bought up the infrastructure/grids for power that will be used to charge cars in the future. Companies will be paying them to use their chargers.

Again, idk where I read it but I’ll try and find a source"
"Tesla would actually let others use the Supercharger network, they just want a patent cross-licensing agreement, and legacy auto doesn't like that because they think they can do better with ""miracle patents"" against Tesla than with cooperation, and because they gotta protect their century-long IP. At least that's what they say. IMO it's a load of crap, patents only go back 20 years, and Tesla needs no ICE patents for the simple reason they make no ICE cars. Legacy auto just wants an excuse to delay the electric transition as long as possible, and ""protecting intellectual property rights"" is always a good rhetoric for business people who speak only numbers (e.g. stockholders) because they always overestimate the value of IP.

Eventually, when the time comes and legacy auto can no longer delay going all in on electric, they will go to Tesla, hoping the deal is still available."
"It's also the fact that Tesla is exclusively electric, while I've heard from bloggers that said they had trouble getting dealers to show them electric options, like the Leaf, and instead were pushed to ICE cars. Dealers make more money on maintenance than the sale, IIRC."
"Automobile manufacturers have also had a long alliance with the fossil fuel industry. They essentially pay them to not make electric cars, and to not research or market electric car tech. Now it’s too late and the only way they could catch up is by creating a new brand from scratch and lose money for a decade."
"I think the biggest difference is Tesla will actually sell you their electro car. I went in to ask my Hyundai dealership about an electric Kona. They laughed at me. Hyundai won’t sell you one unless you live in California. 

They are not trying to enter the electric market they are being forced to sell so many of them for regulatory purposes and that’s it."
The charging network is one of the reasons that make Tesla a no-brainer for a gas replacement car. Everything else is great in a two car household but anything Tesla makes can stand alone as your only car.
"Even if Ford had a great charging network, I'd still choose Tesla because they know what in the hell they're doing. Just compare the efficiency of the Mach E vs Model Y. Ford needs a 50% larger battery to go the same distance. Any bets on how great those Ford OTA updates will be? Would bet a lot they are nothing like Tesla's."
Standardizing this sort of thing will definitely happen. Take networking and the OSI model as an example. Hardware interfaces were standardized and basic protocols for communication established leading to accelerated adoption of technology helping pave the way for the internet in everyone’s home.
"Holy hell yes please standardize chargers!

Funny story...

My brother was visiting NY from MD like a year ago and his usual vehicle is a large truck, he thought to himself, ""heck let me try one of those electric cars for the trip and see how it goes"" because gas would have cost a ton anyway the rental fee was pretty negligible...

So he rents a Chevy Volt.

And proceeds to drive up, using the app the dude at rent-a-car place gave him to find a charger. Well... the first place wasn't working. The next place he didn't have an adapter for. The third place was inside a closed parking garage... you get the point. He ended up stranded in Queens because the stupid thing could only use certain chargers, and the app he had didn't even show other brands chargers that his plug would have worked for... and... it was a hot mess."
"As a volt owner, THIS.

GM already discontinued my car, Only certain dealers have ""Volt Techs"", and the ones that do only have like 1 guy, who of course doesn't work every day of the week, and it's abundantly clear that the dealer as a whole does not like ""dealing"" with me and my car."
"The other issue with chargers is payment. It often seems complicated start using the charger using an app and your mobile data, or at least a membership card. And requiring your credit card stored with them in the cloud.

What if you don't have a smartphone? Could be an issue esp. For older people.

Why not do it like pumping gas? Fill up, pay in store and leave. Or on the pump by just putting your credit or debit card in. Worked fine for decades."
What’s stopping companies from making a power converter to accept Tesla chargers. Instantly allowing all ev to use Tesla power stations?
">  and can use everyone else’s chargers.

I'm looking forward to using CCS is the USA!"
"A lot of early electric cars were no where near as good looking as their ICE relatives. Nissan did it with their LEAF, which the first gen looked awful and the second now looks more like their other cars and a lot more attractive. They didn't want people to buy their first electic cars beacuse they are expensive to build, require different maintenance and didn't work as well as ICE cars, which have had $$$$ of development."
I have i3 unattractive weird box. When I saw the CT the earth opened and the i3 fell into a crack then the earth closed. Now to preorder CT.
Matter of taste. But I'm probably partial because I've rented i3s a handful of times (Drive Now).
The i3 is the worst electric car of this decade.
The i3 isn't great looking but it IS great driving around town at least
If only... Now I kinda wanna just see an all electric Camry 😅
Taycan got the closest but still not on par with price or performance
The point being that it's fully refundable. It's not a real commitment
He can invest it and then use its equity to his benefit.
"Absolutely agree on the photo for this post.  That's a really good angle for the Tesla btw.  I feel like the full-on side view is definitely NOT its best angle and that was the predominant view everyone got.  When I see it from other angles like that tug-of-war pic, it really looks sharp (not a pun!)."
"The word you are looking for is sublime 

"" of such excellence, grandeur, or beauty as to inspire great admiration or awe. """
"Also, thing about Model Y is that, it is very much a derivative product of Model 3.  CUV is a huge segment and it should sell really well but it is not a segment that excites people.  It isn't expected to have any revolutionary features the way Cybertruck does or Model X did with Falcon door etc."
"For me right now I'm tempted to order the Cyber truck because I can afford $100 right now. I really would like for my next vehicle to be a Tesla. At this moment I can't afford it but in 2-3 years that could be very different.

For me the Dual Drive CT is 3-5k less than my Model Y config. I would rather get the truck then."
We might be saying the same thing about the cybrtrk a year or two after it starts selling.
Just means I’ll be bumped up in line when it’s time to pick mine up :)
"Yes. And at work too.  It's refundable, why not? As a giant what if"
There are way dumber things I’ve thrown away $6 on. LOL
I could I'm just not in any rush. I don't need to pre-order it. I'd rather just go pay for it when they eventually have them in stores. 2022 which is the earliest this will probably come out is about exactly when I'll be ready for a new vehicle and probably by 2023 I'll be ready to buy
"Shit, that's a good point. People were hoping the Model 3 would be under $30k effective price. And as the preorders increased, it became evident that if you didn't have a preorder, you would only get a partial tax credit. So there was really strong incentive to put down your $1k today in hopes that you'd get the full tax credit in \~1.5 years. As preorder counts grew, the urgency of getting your car earlier grew as well.

For comparison, people reserving a Cybertruck know:

* They won't get any tax credit
* They'll be waiting 2+ years for the RWD version (17% of orders) and 3+ years for the vastly more popular dual- and triple-motor configs (83% of orders)
* The Model Y will come out much sooner and partially overlap in the role of ""cheap"" Tesla people-mover

In light of that, the fact that hundreds of thousands of people are even entertaining that wait is pretty impressive.

I think it's nuts that we've gotten to the point where people think a sizable portion of orders are literally just jokes so people can grab a screenshot, and to be blunt if this is where we're at within the first week, I don't want to imagine the wild theories people will have in 2 years time."
"Shit I’m sorry man, just getting annoyed with the constant replies saying it’s non-refundable when all you gotta do is Google it. I appreciate the support and apologize for my outburst"
"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
"You literally said “Has Ford or any manufacturer does this before,” and I provided you with a prime example... Then it’s apples to oranges lol?

The Mach-E is gonna be an $80k crossover lol, I don’t see it beating Tesla’s but you’re right, we’ll see how far they were from Tesla’s Model Y"
"Also, I went back to 1965 to show you how Ford, without the use of cellphones or Facebook/Twitter/Streams managed to knock out 1.2 million cars after a reveal within 2 years. If anything it’s more impressive."
"Yep, that $20 million will float them all the way until 9:05 AM."
[deleted]
But they are refundable
You can book non-refundable deposits as revenue.
"If I were to guess, the cybertruck was at least 1300kg heavier as they looked like they were using a base model F-150. 3mm stainless steel isn’t exactly light."
If you were doing this test in good faith you’d rev to whatever RPM was best for the F150 before you start pulling.
Right.. but I’m talking about performance.  Who has a better performing electric motor?
"HP and torque are hardly required. Weight and traction is what wins tug-of-wars. Just gotta get the other truck to break loose first, then you win."
Possibly a Superduty
"F-250 6.7 powerstroke and 4x4 935 lb ft for $48,500"
"Do you know how truck categories work? (Hint: it's usually by weight)

We don't have weight figures for the Cybertruck -- but the Model X is a full 1000 lbs heavier than a mid-range F-150. 

At the very least, I'm guessing the truck will be 500-1000lbs heavier than the Model-X -- which puts it right in the range of the F-350 / F-450.

So it's in the same price range and it's in the same weight range. 

I don't even like pick-up trucks and don't want to get into a dick measuring fight. But the Cybertruck is *more* expensive and has *less* capability of ICE trucks. I think an EV truck makes a ton of sense and I'm glad they're coming out, but the value case isn't there yet."
He's not moving the goal posts. He's comparing the cybertruck to a truck that costs about the same.
Tesla is the one that picked the F-150. All of the sudden Tesla fanboys are scared when they bring in Diesel ICEs lol showing they dont know much about the market
[deleted]
So what? They are both unofficial.
"Dude...

Are you serious?

They took the Model S Plaid to the track. They tested it. They’re working on it. 

What the hell are they suppose to do? This is how you test prototype vehicles. Once the vehicle is finalized, they’ll do an official run and then brag about that. They haven’t been bragging about anything. They’re still working on the car."
Yeah I mean better to just buy the EV and rent a vehicle for that 1% of usages.
"> No, why did you say elo personally did all those things if you don't believe it.

Christ dude, do you REALLY not understand I’m mocking you here? 

Putting electric cars into rockets and shooting them into space - You’re telling me someone *really* thinks one guy did this? Give your head a shake."
Well fair point they're toys tbh..
"I drive an F-250 and everyone I know drives a truck. I work with a truck as I am a land developer and home builder. 

I’m definitely getting the cybertruck. I, for one, hate spending $130 a week on diesel because of my extreme daily commutes. 

All of my contractors drive trucks and they all said they would look at and consider the cybertruck when it comes out...because of its capabilities and it’s without fuel. 

I also drive a Tesla S P100D, and man I wish I could take that thing everywhere but I don’t because it’s not my truck. I can’t imagine what my commutes would be like if I had the comfort of a Tesla, with its smoothness, responsiveness in terms of acceleration and turn, and it’s autopilot. Not to mention 20% of the tiredness I feel after a long day is because of the lunky ness of my F250.

I think all we can do is wait and see how the market reacts upon its release. Either way, either it’ll do good or I’ll have a collectors item that I love to drive, I don’t see a lose.

Edit: I think you should test drive any Tesla and then imagine a truck being the same. It’ll change anyone’s perspective, in my opinion."
"I hear your argument and strongly disagree.  The market for a zero emissions truck exists, and your admission to being in a truck-culture echo chamber explains why you can’t see it.

Get used to tree-huggers joining the big truck nuts community."
I may be an outlier but I think their real margins in the future are going to be through their battery expertise and manufacturing. Not that the vehicles sales won't be significant but I think Tesla Energy is going to be a massive competitor and trend setter going forward.
There’s already free open standards every one else is collaborating on.
"Tesla also wanted cost-sharing on future expansion.  Given how little money automakers are willing to pony up for their own charging network programs already, the idea floated like a lead balloon."
If you don't have a smartphone you miss a massive part of managing your Tesla.
"> Why not do it like pumping gas? Fill up, pay in store and leave.

That would suck. Should do like Tesla and Mercedes to, and have it identify the car and bill the car owner. On Mercedes' end, you just have one Mercedes account and they can pay out as necessary, is my understanding."
The chargers wouldn’t turn on. The charger verified your vehicle with a wireless protocol when you point the charging cable to the charge port of your vehicle

underrated comment my dog
Did you have crack insurance?
You think the Cybertruck truck is more attractive than the i3? LMAO. Tesla fanbois are a delusional lot.
"Yeah, for sure. Design is so much a matter of taste, but I think that speaking very generally Tesla has kind of broken the mould that most EVs were sticking to prior. I happen to like what they’ve done with it more than the old EV look but regardless of how anyone feels about it, it’s definitively different and closer to ICE exterior designs (excerpt for the CyberTruck which is its own beast)."
And at worst a free loan for tesla.
[deleted]
"> For me the Dual Drive CT is 3-5k less than my Model Y config. I would rather get the truck then.

this is really what gets me about the CT.  i was stoked for the Y because it's really similar to my volt (hatchback)... but the CT claims it will do  everything the Y will, plus some, for less money... heck, it's not even a competition at that point"
"There’s lots of things I have no intention of buying, guess how many of them I have a down payment on. 

I guess I just don’t see the point of doing it if you don’t plan on buying the truck."
"no prob, I get it, hence the supporting evidence hah"
"$20 million is 2 years of salary for 2 million-dollar-a-year engineers, 3 $500k-a-year engineers, 15 $250k-a-year engineers, another $9 million for other staff and materials and equipment, and another $250k to rent a warehouse and pay for strippers or other various things.

If they spend it all by 9:05 AM tomorrow, I hope it's on something worth it."
"I agree, it’s cash in their bank account, but on their books it’s a liability, kind of like a bank loan. 

You get the cash, but you owe the money."
Ahhh ok. I thought they were non-refundable like the other order fees
But Tesla does not
What is the approximate weight of the F150? It's somewhere between 2.7 Tonnes to 3.1 for F150 and no info on cybertruck. There is so much difference between the versions.
"By my math, the mid-range cybertruck weighs about 2500kg (as much as the heavier F150 trims), broken down thusly:

600kg - 140kwh battery

200kg - dual motors & gearboxes

200kg - wheels, tires, and brakes

125kg - glass

125kg - suspension components

125kg - interior stuff (seats etc)

1125kg - stainless steel (47 square meters of 3mm thick sheet)"
"How's that good faith? Or, why would good faith be merited? May the best truck win, as built. If it's a smackdown, that goes to show how inferior ICE is, which it is."
Probably General Electric.
Would destroy the cybertruck
"It's not based on weight, is on GVWR and the CT is in the 2A class. You should know this as it's basic."
Bring a diesel f150. Good luck.
"It was a rear-wheel drive truck. Ford makes a lot of F-150 trims, but they picked the RWD option. If that tells you nothing this conversation is pointless."
A trailer tongue puts a bunch of weight on the hitch. Thats what you're missing.
No. Porsche officially posted a video with proof. Tesla did not. You are free to doubt the time or honesty of them but they did post a time. Tesla did not.
"Well then Elon shouldn’t have confirmed anything from a theoretical data and timings taken from a random photographer. That just makes the Tesla diehard fans raising their victory flag over Porsche. 

Did you ever see Porsche time their best possible test vehicle prototype with stripped out interiors and unrestrained aero kits and slick tyres and confirm the numbers publicly?"
"Exactly, I don't drive a 5 tonne truck because I move every couple years, I'm not going to buy an ICE just because I have a use case that doesn't work for an EV 2-3 times a year."
[deleted]
">I also drive a Tesla S P100D, and man I wish I could take that thing everywhere but I don’t because it’s not my truck.

I know *exactly* what youre talking about.

You want a truck that drives like your car.

For some of us, that lunky ness of my powerstroke diesel is actually what I like about it. I love feeling the transmission shift, the rough solid axle suspension, vague steering, turbo spool, diesel exhaust noise, etc... 

One of the reasons I wouldnt want to drive a half-ton truck is because of how refined they've become, in the ways that you've described. 

I agree, from your perspective there's no loss. Its everything you want. 

...Just not quite what those of us who *do* like F250s want."
">Get used to tree-huggers joining the big truck nuts community.

Thats literally what I said, lol. It has a market in people who would normally buy a fuel efficient car, but also wants the capability of a truck. 

I do think that particular market is considerably smaller than those that would normally buy an F series truck from capability and price standpoints. 

Because from *capability and price* standpoints, the Cybertruck loses. 

From an SUV or car buyer standpoint, its a different comparison. Car buyers dont care about the same things truck buyers do and vice-versa."
">  I think their real margins in the future are going to be through their battery expertise and manufacturing

100%, as we've seen with the early (and with even modern (weird to say that)) 3's is that they still have a lot to work on with manufacturing the car itself but damn if they don't have some of if not the best batteries."
"Tesla energy will be their major future driver in the extreme long run.  Eventually the other industries will stabilize, but electricity is a product you keep buying every month.  Energy is already making inroads into municipal power grids on national levels and that is going to eventually become a major priority."
Good point. But I think that's also gonna be a non-issue by the time it becomes necessary for legacy auto to get a charging network.
"If you have a tesla, you almost certainly have a smartphone."
I’m not even high
"Crack-insurance. I don’t think less of myself; I think of myself, less."
Yes?
"I think you're generalizing how everyone must think based on how you think. I want one but I didn't preorder.

You gotta understand the Tesla fanboys"
"Yes, that's correct. Standard accounting practise. And they get to move it from the liability column into the revenue column when the appropriate condition is met (usually an allocated car)

But you don't need to hold it in a separate bank account, it goes into the kitty and comes out of it when due same as any other debt."
"It adds to cash on hand and debt at the same time. Everyone’s refundable deposit is just an unsecured loan to Tesla. Just like any other loan they can spend it however they want. 

Technically if Tesla goes bankrupt you could try to get it back from available assets. But I don’t see that happening."
"Base model F-150 is a little over 4000lbs. I’ll say the cybertruck is definitely heavier than an H2 hummer which is about 6,600lbs. Cybertruck has its batteries and stainless sheet. The truck is well over 7000lbs."
"It could be in pounds perhaps as I checked rn. The estimations say cybertruck could be around 1000-1500 pounds heavier than the Ford they used, 450 to 680 KG more."
That is a total under estimation. What about the subframe? The Model 3 dual motor battery weighs 480kg. The trucks battery is double that. The truck is easily  over 3175kg.
"That’s dumb because that isn’t the way the truck would be used in real life. Like having a pair of left handed scissors and giving them to a righty. Are they technically scissors, yes but they’re not going to be any good at cutting the paper if you’re not giving them the environment it was built for.

If I am buying a truck, I will throw out your example if you don’t even use the F150 like how a F150 would be used in the real world. You’re just making Tesla look disingenuous at best and incompetent at worst."
Idk tug of wars are really just about traction. If the cybertruck weighs more like everyone is speculating the ford could still loose
*ignores my entire argument*
Why does it need to be an f-150? Where is this abitrary rule? Tesla chose f-150. If they want a money-for-money test then lets test an f-350 vs this cybertruck. The ford rep never said f-150 vs cybertruck lol and the f-350 is actually cheaper than base model tesla truck. None of the tesla tests have been in an offroad setting either so how do you know how it performs with that dumb ass unibody. Im guessing you dont even know anyone with a truck.
[deleted]
I don't doubt the time but the time is unofficial.
"Arguing with you is a waste of time. 

Tesla tested their vehicles. People reported their time. Elon replied on Twitter that they wanna keep working on it to beat Taycan and release the new Plaid next year. He does this all the time, provide us with updates on Twitter. 

Porsche and Tesla are two different companies. Have you not been paying attention? Elon and Tesla don’t run like traditional companies. Elon tweets updates about Tesla like crazy. 

Don’t bother replying to me. This discussion isn’t going anywhere."
"If you assume everything without a /s is completely serious, you’re going to have a lot of these kinds of interactions on the internet. Although I think we both know you understood I was joking, you’re pretending not to understand. Or unable to understand because of a disorder.

Get your joke-o-meter recalibrated."
"It’s not for everyone, that’s for sure. And I think it’ll definitely free up my mind more for work stuff on my commutes as opposed to having to worry about the slow down shift to speed up and pass someone, or lean into the turn because the trucks center of gravity is so high (cybertruck might be the same but the air suspension will definitely help). Or even that every bump on the road feels like it’s an earthquake or at high speeds feels like the truck is going to flip if I hit a rough patch wrong lol. 

Everyone has a different opinion I agree. But I do think there’ll be a market for it. Might not be 3 million sales a year but there’ll definitely be one."
Folks who fetishize Ford's were always going to find things to complain about.
"What work do they have to do in terms of manufacturing? It seems like they've worked out a lot of the kinks from what I've heard. I know people aren't impressed with the quality of paint, but aside from issues like that, what's deficient in the Model 3 production?"
"Non-issue as in they will find a different network from Tesla, or they will agree to Tesla's terms, or Tesla will change their terms?"
"Of course that’s true... but I’m not talking about my fashion or car preference, I’m talking about a behavior that makes next to no sense at all. 

There are hundreds of items available for pre order, I bet none of those people have pre orders on any of them. I just don’t get why you would do that on something you admittedly have no intention of buying"
Do you want real world or do you want to rev up the Ford to the perfect RPM before starting the test?
"Fine, let me use my preferred test. Sit in a locked garage with each truck running for 8 hours and be the judge of whichever you prefer"
"Corrected you.... Again. 

CT is 2a truck class. This is 5th grade comprehending."
"That's not how truck classes work. The f150 gets well up there in price and they're in the same class. This is basic automotive 101.

Good try trying to move the goal posts though. At least you admit the f150 and other trucks in class can't compete."
"Oh wow ok they are cool that proves it was a 4x4 the first time...? Believe what you want, if you want to twist your worldview to mean Elon = Fact then go hog wild. Ciao."
"Yes unofficial for the own ladderboard of the track. Not unofficial for Porsche. They did the time they have done all times before. That is as official as it gets for them. Porsche -> has a time. Telsa -> does not have a time. Not sure how hard it is to understand that they arent the same.

>So what? They are both unofficial.

Only one is ""unofficial"" because the second one (from Tesla) does not exist."
"And even accounting for the fact that the Tesla was a ""prototype"", how many companies as young as Tesla can claim they've bested (or at least matched) other established companies with ~50 years of ""racing"" pedigree?"
"Well the way he’s been Tweeting and confirming claims left and right and overpromising is creating cult like fanbase that doesn’t care about how things should be properly done and defending him like a God just to keep the stocks they’re investing up. 

It’s good he’s pushing and doing things differently but the way it’s going on is getting worse by how the diehard fans has been insufferable and obnoxious to say the least. These kind of fanbase are what makes people like me who just want a good EV and competition steer away from being associated with the brand. Hence why you see a lot of keying incidents and people destroying Teslas from the amount of hate he’s generating through his ways of doing things and diehards praising him like he’s faultless. Then they play the victim card and be the ‘woke’ one and circlejerking each other. Sorry for the rant."
[deleted]
"Fetishize? 

The guy literally said he doesnt like his F250, and wishes it drove like his car. 

I explained the fact that an F250 drives like an F250 is what I like about it, and I wouldnt want it to drive like a car. 

How is that fetishizing Fords?"
"They will agree to Tesla's terms, because by that point, that will make sense. But that's assuming Tesla's terms don't change.

I'm not expecting any Supercharger-scale networks to pop up anytime soon. There are some universal ones growing, and that's awesome, but with the Superchargers Tesla doesn't need to communicate between the car company and charger company, both of those is them, so they're gonna keep leading in tech and in adoption of said tech."
"Because it'll take forever for them to get one in case I'm a few years they want one. In the SMALL case where they can or will get one 

Which is the difference"
"> Do you want real world or do you want to rev up the Ford to the perfect RPM before starting the test?

Those are the same thing. If I have to pull something I'm not going to start at a standstill, I am going to rev to the perfect RPM then pull."
Telling people to commit suicide because they disagree with you is pretty irrational. Hope you get better and learn how to accurately defend a position.
We are talking base models per price. How is it different? Whats your opinion on the same “class”?
"Porsche's time is as official as mine doing a 10-sec run.

Stop whining that much, no-one's hating on your precious unofficial times."
"That’s not how things work. Any startup EV can obliterate legacy automaker’s records if they do not have restrictions since its a prototype, where they can use or remove parts and don’t need to pass validations for production. See NIO track records as example"
"I don’t know man, keep talking about how upset you think I am."
"I was going to say, more automakers are ""partnering"" with Electrify America, but it's not clear whether they are throwing any money into the pot that VW was forced to start.  As long as they can convince themselves that EA is enough, they won't bother Tesla.  

I just don't see how they could effectively jump ship from EA and come begging to Tesla, once they already started building enough cars (without Tesla hardware support) to realize there was a problem."
But they have NO intention of getting one.
"Lol, sounds totally believable. When you do this do you do a brake stand to keep from moving until you hit your target rpm or do you do it in neutral then slam it in drive?"
Hehe
"No you're not, the comparable F150 is $37k compared to $39k 2we to 2wd. The CT is in the 2a class with the f150. There's f150s up to $60k according to trucar. Stay in class."
LOL
[deleted]
You're being pedantic.  I'm tempted to preorder but there's such a minute chance I'd buy one.  It's not anywhere close to a 1-1 ratio of preorder to purchase
"> When you do this do you do a brake stand to keep from moving until you hit your target rpm or do you do it in neutral then slam it in drive?

2 minute worth of searching could've shown you the correct process. The RPMs you're trying to get to are not high, you sit on the break till you get where you want to go then take your foot off the break.

"Again, Tesla fanboys only want to compare the F150. The msrp for the 2020 F350 4wd is $38k but you only want to focus on F150 because thats the arbitrary truck Tesla chose. Thats what I call confirmation bias, are you scared it wont stack up to other popular pickups at the same price point? Were talking base models not fucking King Ranches."
"If your ability to understand very obvious humor was as strong as your grip on your argument that I’m upset, we wouldn’t be here.

Thanks for the advice dad."
"Because that's how classes work. There's an F150 in the same class, Platinum SuperCrew 6.5' Box 4WD. 

$60,240

Let's use that? 

You're introducing bigger trucks to compete with the 2a class. This is why you don't see Ford compare the F350 against the Ram 1500 even if have models priced similarly. How do you guys not understand this basic stuff?"

"You are super concerned about me. Are you a mental health counselor or something? Why are you spending so much time on me? 

Anything to shift away from you completely missing the very obvious joke I guess. Deflection is a good tactic. 

Got anything else “ur mean and u should feel bad”?"

"I’m not avoiding the point. I know more about my emotions than you and I’m rejecting the notion I’m upset. I was mocking you. And now you’re fixated on it because your feelings were hurt...or some other reason you have yet to identify.

I never call people snowflakes because that’s a dumb term that is unproductive, but now I know what kind of people those who do use the term are talking about.

I made fun of you and you’re unable to process that so you’re claiming I’m “upset”. Give it a rest dude."

"I think I figured this one out. I know you haven't liked what I have said so far, but really, hear me out on this one.

Not that I am asking where you live, but I would be very surprised if you lived within 500 miles of me. If you are willing to share something as general as (I live in the southeast region of the US/I live in Europe), that would be interesting to know. I am happy to share mine as well.

I am fucking around with you here dude. I'm not mad at you, I am attacking a vulnerability I saw in you (you missed my joke) and I made another joke at your expense. The worst thing to do is react when someone does this to you (I've had it done to me plenty of times) but you reacted and I continued on. I'm not ""upset"" with you, but that doesn't mean I didn't say things you didn't like. And that doesn't mean those things I said were wrong to say - as I am fucking around with you. 

Fucking around with people is so common in my area of the world that I would be surprised if we lived anywhere near each other, and I think we are getting into an argument because we are culturally quite different. And to argue in your favor, it is more difficult to identify humor when delivered in a text based fashion, and even more so when the humor is dry. Mine can be as dry as the desert between us.

To the extent that I exceeded the appropriate standards of fucking around with a stranger on the internet, I apologize. I don't apologize for the entire interaction because that is nothing I need to apologize for. I might have been too bold at times when talking to an internet stranger, sometimes you need to be there in person to reach a level where you can mock them openly. 

But in real life you'd like me. I'm a good dude. I'm not an asshole at all, and people enjoy when I'm around. I will joke around with people as much as anyone else, but my point is that around where I live, everyone fucks around with everyone. Cut off the wrong 80 year old grandmother in line at the store and she will say a few words and slice you in half in front of everyone. It's part of how we keep each other in line, socially. It's kind of barbaric, but it feels like home. These assassins are absolutely everywhere and you don’t know who is armed or with what weapons. Assume everyone is armed, though. 

And my guess is that you don't experience this too often. Not a judgment, that's just my guess about how it is like to live where you live. That is my guess for why you think I'm a dick and I think you're too sensitive. I think we are very different people."

"The cybertruck took the world by storm

Everyone i know was talking about it

And i mean everyone"
I joined after preordering the CT. I have no idea what's going on so I've been lurking.
"In my own mind, I'm already gone."
My subreddit r/cybertruck was trending for awhile it was nice.
We need to make TeslaMotors a top 10 subreddit soon. Perhaps in a few years time?
"Uplifting news, that's pretty nice"
I want my TruckLorean.
joined because i bought a tesla the day before thanksgiving. seemed like a good time to stop watching from afar
Amazing
Woo! Welcome to all new members!
"What does the rank change mean?  At first I thought it was how high the sub is ranked based on subscribers, but that doesn’t seem right."
I think its amazing how many subs we have compared to the other manufacturers. I love how engaged the Tesla community is.
I joined like 2 days ago
Everyone loved memeing Cybertruck
They came for the memes /s
Yes. Everyone loves a circus.
Most improved!
Tesla can now have Truck Month commercials!
Because of the ugly ass meme truck lol
Oh this is actually a bug due to the new update..
"Welcome everybody!

I think the unfair Ford pull was bait 😉"
r/upliftingnews nice
It’s pretty depressing seeing what other communities are trending on Reddit. Let’s hope there’s hope for humanity.
Welcome
"one word, Cybertruck

the greatest PR stunt that is real ever pulled."
What site is this?
Cyber growth
I come to this sub for quality information.  I go to r/CyberTruck to look at shitposts.
That's epic!
Why was the post on the racism at the Buffalo plant removed? This Russia or China managed?

"Yes but those subs don't require a $1000 down payment, there's no commitment to those subs, so they're worthless.  ^/s"
"And all over Facebook people are trash talking it trying to prove that nobody likes it. 

Most polarizing new vehicle in years, for sure. But a powerful move for generating buzz. Seeing a lot more people talking about Tesla than ever before."
They definitely did it on purpose for the publicity right?
Bless this community
We did it Reddit!
"That's actually kind of genius if this was on purpose. Tesla thrives on word of mouth and zero advertising. 

1) they did an unveiling and it got the press's attention so it was all over the news. 

2) before a major holiday where, like you said, there's no doubt they will be talking about it with people they don't normally see from all over who may or may not have heard of it.

Gah damn."
My relatives at the table today have already told me I need good glass insurance!
"You nailed it, Red. That's what we were talking about and everyone had at least heard of it, and only a few hadn't already seen it and formed an opinion."
"I'm guessing when they fly US astronauts to the ISS for the first time, sometime next year.

Might be a bit of overlap though, as they'll be driving the astronauts to the rocket in white Model X vehicles."
"It’s moderation rules help keep a lid on things. I think they’re subs will keep growing but more and more the lounge will capture the more typical reddit conversations (as it’s intended to). Personally I wish this sub was run more like Spacex, TeslaMotors doesn’t need to be so... freefolk-like."
Welcome. You have any questions?
"I found it recently and added it to [my Tesla multi-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/tnitty/m/tesla/) - which started out as an “all sub-Reddit’s related to Tesla” thing, but now includes other EVs too."
"Oh, and it's been around since 2014! Just joined."
It's more of a ManDelorean.
It’s based on change in viewer growth (so if 200k people are viewing today vs 100k last week. It’s ranked by the difference of 100k)

That’s mostly at r/TeslaLounge
I agree. I feel it had to be. He’s an engineer and half the car was built alongside SpaceX engineers.

old reddit still out pacing new reddit!
Can we see the same graph with the same scale for model Y or model 3 announcement?
The difference between old and new reddit is closer than I’d imagine
Are these stats something only the mods can see or is this something I can somehow access?
How does it look like if we zoom out to the 3 unveil?
"And thats just reddit, this doesnt even mention the attention it got on Twitter and Facebook and other social media. How much money would Ford or Chevrolet pay to get that much media attention for one of their products ?"
Impressive
"But let's be honest, there were a *lot* of people saying ""There is no reason **not** to throw $100 to hold my place in line for the lulz"". 

I'm not trying to take anything away from the Cybertruck's potential success, I see a bright future for this fucking ridiculous looking piece of metal and glass. I can't wait to get one myself. If nothing else, it's one of the boldest moves we've seen in the automotive world in several decades. It's just SO different.

But to pretend it's anything comparable to a Model 3 pre-order, there's just no way. Nearly everyone who threw down $1k had a Model 3 sized gap in their life and they were all dying to fill it. 

The Cybertruck is cool, but it's not the Model 3 preorder level of demand whatsoever."
"Talked with family about it at Thanksgiving dinner. Literally everyone had at least heard about it, and only 3 people hadn't seen it yet. This is pretty unprecedented in terms of a vehicle unveiling."
"Yeah, my dad didn't even know about it at all and haven't seen the cybertruck but he even heard about glass breaking. Lol. It's genius."
My brother who works for a major manufacturer is still insisting that you can’t build an EV people want and can afford. He thinks the company is making a mistake with the little bit of investment they are. Making
🙄
">Might be a bit of overlap though, as they'll be driving the astronauts to the rocket in white Model X vehicles.

TIL! That's fucking awesome."
More like astronauts in pressurized CyberTrucks
"I personally would love to have more technical conversations and sources on battery, motor and manufacturing technologies as well as autonomy."
"Since Pandora's box has been opened, I've thought that r/teslamotors should be the lounge and r/teslalounge should be the heavily moderated one."
The spacex subreddit is downright sad and boring. I hope no mods takes your idea into consideration.
"A ton, but I'm waiting to see if they'll be answered as time goes on."
Boooo
.com
Was not a repost. At all. It was a story that broke that day
There is a cybertruck subreddit but I am unsure if it is run by the same mods/community
The memes are all at r/Teslalounge
Same
New Reddit is trash
Absolutely. I put down a deposit after learning it was only $100. No way I would’ve done it at $1000.
"I definitely have a Cybertruck-sized hole in my life. There's also one for every other Tesla vehicle, but the Cybertruck one is bigger, in more ways than one. This is the first time the preorder price was affordable for me. I may not end up getting a Cybertruck, but it won't be from lack of desire. 

You're right though, a lot of people were just doing it for fun. Some people have reserved all three, without any intention of buying any."
Great!!! less preorders means I gets mine right away!!!
He's not wrong per se.  You *can't* make an EV people want with only a little investment.  Ford is proving it: they decided to go big or go home.
That covers every car over $5k.
It does have an onboard compressor.
We are doing our best to stay 50/50. There is only 4 of us mods. We like where the sub is at. Might make small changes but things are good.
May I ask why? Is it because of the strict rules?
"https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e0w5ku/so_you_reserved_a_cybertruck_this_is_likely_how

Start here. :)"
"At present, a lot of the questions only have speculative answers. I'm okay with that too though, it's fun to guess."
"Wait, are you saying ""boo"" or ""boo-urns?"""
"I saw it twice, but it’s entirely possible the first was reported as spam a number of times and automatically removed. That happens occasionally, but they don’t usually get noticed by mods unless someone mentions it to us.  We don’t remove stuff just cause it’s negative, we have negative things all the time."
"I mean, lately this has become the Cybertruck sub. I'm not displeased at all."
[deleted]
"True ... I hate the looks of New Reddit so, so much. The day they decide to kill off Old Reddit will probably the day they lose me."
Me too. And it's getting more and more likely that I'll actually take delivery. But I wouldn't have jumped at $1000.
"It’s weird, three months ago I put a $2500 deposit down on a Model S, then three weeks later I canceled that and simultaneously put $1000 on a Rivian and actually bought a used Volvo. Recently refunded the Rivian over the Tesla rumors, but even at $100 I haven’t gotten around to putting down a Cybertruck deposit yet. 2023 still seems pretty far off to tie up even a small amount in my current financial situation. But I’ll get around to it. Gotta lock in that FSD price in case it goes up any further."
"I have a Cybertruck sized hole in my life too, but $100 vs. $1000 is the only reason I preordered. I don't need to be the first one in town to get one, but for $100, I wouldn't mind the shot at it though!"
"Yeah right now you are doing a great job, seriously. I think it should stay like that. It's a good balance."
"yeah, only some people can post and essentially only official news, once. So basically no discussion outside of big events. It's a news outlet, not a forum. Downright stupid mods."
Boooo
Can someone show me the story that still exists?
"In fact, none do but a year old story. The mods deleted it and closed comments"
"Plus it doesn't render on....Windows...

I got no meme content here today"
Yeah 2 years is a while. Will be interesting to see if Tesla actually delivers on the claimed specs. I’d they do I’ll likely be a customer.
"> But I’ll get around to it. Gotta lock in that FSD price in case it goes up any further.

That's the real value proposition. Once production starts, I think they'll chew through the backlog fairly quickly. Model 3 had a lot of reservations looking to get in line before the tax credit expired. That's pretty far in the rearview display at this point."
"I held off on the preorder because while I’m sure I want one, I expect to be pretty upside down on my current car when it launches and I’d kind of like to finish paying it off the slow way first. But a deposit locks in the price, and while I don’t expect them to change the base price I do suspect the price of the FSD option might go up. So I ended up placing a preorder tonight after reading this thread. Put me in the column of “want one, might not buy right away, deposited anyway.”"
"It's always a difficult balance, we have daily threads where people discuss, and many posts where lots of discussion happens (outside big events, there aren't that many).  For lesser quality content, and more 'sharing your Tesla story', the r/TeslaLounge is there for people who like that stuff."
"I just looked back in 20+ pages of mod logs of removed links (automated + manual) and searched each page, back to the Cybertruck unveil.  I'm finding nothing.  You'll just need to google it.  I did and found a couple links from the originating local news, and if any of it is true that would be disappointing.  I know Tesla doesn't stand for any of that, and I'd be shocked if the offenders were not let go as well."
"I talked to a mod about this just now, and he said this was from days before the unveil (which is why I didn't find it).  He said he had to lock it and nuke comments and ban a crap ton of people.  All trolls who he said were being extremely toxic, and said things I won't share.  Locking, removing and banning is normal action when there are toxic posts.  We have zero tolerance for it."
"Their timelines haven't always been on schedule, but the specs have always been at least as good as promised. I'm just curious to see how the simplified assembly pans out, and if they'll actually be able to crank them out at a ridiculous pace.

Though I am curious why it takes two years from debut to production. Is it because they still have two other passenger vehicles in the pipeline ahead of it?"
Technically the red one came in third. The towed one came in second 😂.
"If I recall that wasn't a stunt that Tesla put together but one of the auto mags (Motor Trend, Car & Driver, etc.).  Will have to wait until the Cyberbeast is in production for some of these wacky videos to start popping up."
As Elon said there is too much trickery in promos/ads. Just let it go. Once the cybertruck is out people (youtubers) can do whatever experiments they want.
"The 4C certainly does not live up to its looks in straight-line performance. Such a shame they canceled the bigger engine variants, this car deserved more than a 4 cylinder and an automatic gearbox."
"So Cybertruck should tow an F-150 that’s towing another F-150, vs. just an F-150 that’s towing another F-150."
At 10.8 1/4 mile it will beat a Ford Raptor while it tows a Ford Raptor.
the insane thing is that it wasn't just towing another spider.  it was towing another spider *on a trailer*.
The problem with Tesla right now is that they have announced 5 vehicles and if they don’t deliver them on time a lot of companies are going to get mad. Especially Walmart
"I LOVE Tesla. But the fact that Tesla showed the F-150 in 2wd and the Tesla in 4wd shows a degree of marketing shadiness I am extremely uncomfortable with. As soon as I saw that on the presentation and the crowd cheered, I cringed and knew every truck guy in America was thinking what I was thinking and kinda felt bad for the audience for being misled. It was preying on people who didn't know anything about trucks but I guess that is there market, not the existing truck segment but taking people from other markets, maybe SUV community, EV community, etc. Either way, it was cringey and I wish they would be more honest. Nevermind the fact that truck pulls are done all day every day on youtube and they're a terrible test of capability, it's a battle of weight (and distribution of weight), height of attach point and traction (tire PSI level / tire contact patch aka footprint, tire compound aka bias ply vs radial), almost nothing else.

Another question, how long can the EV tow the 14k lbs for? Towing 14k lbs on any truck including 3/4 ton and up will reduce the range SIGNIFICANTLY (3-4MPG)...does heavy load affect EV's the same way? I would be very curious to know. Many of the new model F-150's (and other OEM's) can tow 14k lbs but it's stopping it and managing that load that is the largest concern...people overload their trucks all the time. Truck guys try to point this stuff out and then get downvoted into oblivion so I'm sure I will too."
"That whole video seemed like a shitty race scene from the Fast & Furious movies. What was that, 19 camera cuts for a quarter mile drag?"
"That would be pretty fun to see. Make it Ford's biggest baddest diesel just for giggles.

The real apples-to-apples though will be against the electric f150."
Oh they don’t need the F150 to tow another F150. That isn’t the point when showing just how fast a Tesla is.

This was THE video that sucked me into the tesla fandom.. This has a special place in my heart..
4c an amazing look car thou! can't wait for roadster 2
The Alfa Romeo 4C Spider is no ones idea of a fast car to begin with.
The 4c is a lightweight car for the twisties. These marketing tests are scammy.
"I mean comparing EVs to ICE cars is just not fair. What I think the market needs is an EV camry or an EV accord at their current prices.

I’ve got the cash for a model S but I’m not a fan of the looks. I’d rather have an EV 4 series or a Cayman, but those don’t exist yet.

What tesla is doing really well is proving a couple of things:

1. EVs can look sexy and not be weird egg shaped things 
2. EVs are safer, more reliable, and faster

I am curious why someone like Porsche or Mercedes haven’t reached battery parity with Tesla, especially since they have way more resources."
Petroleum is shitting itself.
so bad ass!
"Here is an interesting video showing how Tesla likely performed the video in the Cybertruck's reveal, brilliant marketing but not realistic:  
[https://youtu.be/jzKCJsou10w](https://youtu.be/jzKCJsou10w)"
Anyone know in the original cybertruck pulling Ford f150 that if the f150 was a RWD or a AWD? Because in the video I only saw the back wheels spinning forward unlike the forward wheels
"Do it with an f350 and they can both tow 20,000lbs"
"It's not about how fast you can tow, it's about how far you can tow, when you can tow, and how you can tow."
This is cool... I vote for win race against F150 while towing an F450.
And giving the F150 a 3 second head start.
"What we really need is the Tesla Truck towing an F150, and an F150 towing an F150 from say ... Detroit, MI to Marquette, MI to see who gets their faster."
"Put two F-150s on a trailer. That would be near the 14,000lb max towing capacity. Now THAT would be something to see."
"This might actually play out pretty well, Imagine this: 
Ford and Tesla have a big showdown and Cyber truck blows the F 150 out of the water, then Ford brings out their new electric F 150 and it  performs admirably allowing Ford to Save face maybe even beats the Tesla in one metric 

What a win It would be for Ev's"
That is a horrible video. It jumps all over the race and makes it impossible too determine how either car performed.
"Ah drag racing, the special Olympics of motorsports"
And give the f150 a head start
"... This exists. Tho its a train, its still cool. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXFHgoon7lg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXFHgoon7lg)"
"What a stupid fucking comparison, let’s take a 237 horsepower car that has no business being on a drag strip and race it against a 760hp AWD SUV. Even if that SUV is towing an additional 2500lb it’s still got a better power to weight ratio. 

In that same vein, let’s go to Leguna Seca and see who can do a single lap faster. That’s an equally biased and pointless comparison."
or they could just save a little face and keep doing what they do well
This comment wins. Wrap it up everyone.
"""We used no testing equipment because frankly this was really stupid"""
The quickest F-150 will be the one getting towed by the Cybertruck.
Please have a silver
"It was Motor Trend h2h (Head to Head) against the Bentley Bentayga, and I think it was a P90D with Ludicrous, that video was part of the longer one that actually has a quarter mile race where it also beats the Bentley as well."
"They want apples to apples, we should give them apples to apples.  Maybe instead of a tug of war, both trucks should tow something identical up a gradually steepening hill.  Use whatever Ford truck is identical in price to the dual motor Cyber truck.  Just get super scientific and transparent about the whole thing and do it in so many different ways that there is no denying afterwards."
"Headlines sell. Far more than YouTubers. If you want to sell to the lowest common denominator, especially, you have to go to them with advertisements and marketing. They’re never going to go out and search for the content."
The 4C also isn’t a drag car. I don’t understand if all things to chose a 4C
I think you might be missing the point of the 4C though. It's a corner carver much like lotus elises.
"What a stupid fucking comparison, let’s take a 237 horsepower car that has no business being on a drag strip and race it against a 760hp AWD SUV. Even if that SUV is towing an additional 2500lb it’s still got a better power to weight ratio.

In that same vein, let’s go to Leguna Seca and see who can do a single lap faster. That’s an equally biased and pointless comparison."
The 4C isn’t a slow car at all. 1/4 mile in the 12’s.
"A neighbor got one of these, and I was horrified by the sound it made in our underground garage. Shockingly industrial and shrill. It looks fantastic, but always wondered if it was just the base engine or something. Sad there isn’t another one. It looks sharp."
That's some inception level racing right there.
"They should play Ford at their own game. Repeat the dumb electric F-150 pulling a bunch of train cars with F-150s, but have the CyberTruck pulling in the opposite direction. Pretty sure it’ll look exactly like the existing towing video, except with more cowbell."
150^4 i think
They should make some sort of carriage like thing to attach to 5 f 150s that then converge to one attached to the Cyber truck
"I would think to be fair, they each should be towing a clone of themselves."
Now that's a video I want to see
Yes. Tesla needs to hire 500 more engineers and get these products out!
Do we know the timelines of the semi? Haven't heard about it since the unveil and first orders.
"As far as towing performance goes, you’ll see a similar hit.  No matter what, it takes a certain amount of energy to haul a mass. You have two primary losses :

1.	Rolling resistance. Proportional to mass
2.	Aerodynamic drag. Proportional to frontal area, proportional to velocity^2

If you’re going uphill, you are also storing potential energy in the mass you’re bringing uphill.

What’s different between electric and ICE is what happens to the efficiency of the motor. An ICE generally has less torque “in reserve” at a given RPM, so it will probably have to shift to a much less efficient operating point. An electric motor has more torque available and a bigger efficiency sweet spot on the torque vs rpm curve"
"Yep.  You summed up what most truck owners are taking from the demo.  Another thing is the driver in general.  You can hook up two vehicles and one pull the other ten times in a row.  Then you can switch the driver in the one that lost and they may win 10 times in a row.

I'm pretty sure the Cybertruck is going to win the tow off 9 times out of 10 against any F-150 based solely off of weight, but if I were Ford I would be challenging them to see who could tow further.  

""How about we tow an F-150 using the exact same F-150 and you tow a Cybertruck using the exact same Cybertruck and lets see who goes further?""

I'm also extremely confident Ford would blow them out of the water in this category.  I have a 3.5 Ecoboost with a 35 gallon tank.  I get about 615 miles on a full tank.  That's more than 100 miles than the Cybertruck."
">But the fact that Tesla showed the F-150 in 2wd

Source?"
Ok boomer
I think the point is that you can’t see the trailer at the start. They use all the angles to obscure it before the reveal.
At least they didn’t have shots of people “willing” their car to go faster.

This wasn't Tesla
"Much longer headstart. They will eventually close the gap since initial improvement is more rapid hen granular improvement. 

I own a Tesla, ordered 1 more and have reserved another. But if Mercedes or Audi put out a strong offering (including self driving and OTA updates!) I would switch next day."
Lol no they've been prepared since the 80's or 90's when they started building their deep see rigs higher in anticipation of sea level rise. They've divested into renewables to make sure they dominate the future of energy as well.
"You radicalized 'progressive' types seem to always forget that electricity is functionally older than petroleum, and certainly much older than any internal combustion engine design.

In other words, despite having a two decade head start you've only just started to catch up and surpass the ability and efficiency of petroleum.

This is why I get such a kick out of the gnashing of teeth and crying from todays '*youth*' about blah blah climate catastrophe emergency warming collapse.  The youth are literally know-nothings.  Useful idiots, if you will, and yet there supposed to 'lead us' to this greener, renewable future that is still decades of time and trillions of dollars away."
Depends on which version of the tesla truck. Remember there are going to be 3 versions.

I LOVE Tesla. But the fact that Tesla showed the F-150 in 2wd and the Tesla in 4wd shows a degree of marketing shadiness I am extremely uncomfortable with. As soon as I saw that on the presentation and the crowd cheered, I cringed and knew every truck guy in America was thinking what I was thinking and kinda felt bad for the audience for being misled. It was preying on people who didn't know anything about trucks but I guess that is their market with this truck, not the existing truck segment but taking people from other markets, maybe SUV community, EV community, etc. The truck community was already outraged with the latest chevy redesign and this is somehow beyond that atrocity (or matches it). Either way, it was cringey and I wish they would be more honest with their marketing. Nevermind the fact that truck pulls are done all day every day on youtube and they're a terrible test of capability, it's a battle of weight (and distribution of weight), height of attach point and traction (tire PSI level / tire contact patch aka footprint, tire compound aka bias ply vs radial), almost nothing else.

Another question, how long can the EV tow the 14k lbs for? Towing 14k lbs on any truck including 3/4 ton and up will reduce the range SIGNIFICANTLY (3-4MPG)...does heavy load affect EV's the same way? I would be very curious to know. Many of the new model F-150's (and other OEM's) can tow 14k lbs but it's stopping it and managing that load that is the largest concern...people overload their trucks all the time. Truck guys try to point this stuff out and then get downvoted into oblivion so I'm sure I will too."

"But which apples to compare is usually a touchy subject.   ICE proponents are already telling us nobody cares about 0-60, despite the need to merge onto a freeway.   People are going to want to carefully select the test that they think will advantage the vehicle they have (or admire), and if it doesn't pan out then they'll pivot to saying the tires weren't right, or the temp, or the altitude, whatever."
"A great idea in theory, but a waste of money in practice.

They already have over 200k preorders, and it hasn't even been a week. There will be plenty of videos of the cybertruck destroying any other vehicle in any other way when it comes out.

Tesla can just concentrate on making the thing. Let the internet handle the advertising, as it always has."
"I think a real apples to apples comparison in a strength-based competition would be separated into weight classes.  
That's how humans do it after all."
"The ford truck that is identical in price to the dual motor cybertruck is capable of towing over 21,000 pounds.  Probably not what Tesla wants to do."
"Again, that’s a selected apples to apples test though. You could prove the other side by saying having a test that has the same priced F150 and Tesla do a road trip race across the country while towing."
"If they want apples to apples, Tesla shouldn't have used a car that costs 60% of the price to make the point. They should have used an F250 which is closer to the same price and the same towing capacity.

I'd love to see a tow-off, because I think it would be much closer, and would prove more.

Honestly the tug of war seemed cheap and low-class. Especially when it is clear that they used a 2WD F150."
Just to be clear - when you say identical price - what is the price of a car that isnt planned to be in production for two years?

It is supposed to be a super light, fun, go-kart kind of car with manual steering. In that aspect they completely succeeded, the problem is they left in an automatic transmission. The only reason it is slightly quick is that it only weighs \~2400lbs.

It's just a slightly fancier Miata."

Probably because they wanted to win this flawed and ridiculous comparison. Also because the average person thinks that every sports car is extremely fast in a straight line.

"> An ICE generally has less torque “in reserve” at a given RPM, so it will probably have to shift to a much less efficient operating point.

WTF? why would it ""shift to a much less efficient operating point""? that is literally the opposite thing a transmission is designed to do.

Electric motors have torque curves too. The notion of full torque from 0 rpm to max rpm is completely misunderstood on this subreddit.

>An electric motor has more torque

Which electric motor? the one in my hitatchi magic wand? it's got enough torque to rattle your fillings from down below. Or do you mean the one in the tesla truck?

There is only one type of electric motor that has a nearly flat torque curve, with a majority of the torque available from 0 rpm. That motor can be found in a high end CNC lathe.

An electric motor in a tesla or any other electric car can also produce full torque at 0 rpm.

Put a load on either motor, and see which one can hold full locked rotors before melting. 

p.s. when you are towing 14k lb, aerodynamic drag is the least of your concern."

"Honestly most of those truck guys are going after range (Teslarati comments). They would argue that the F-150 would loose but still have alot of range left after the test while the Cybertruck has used a significant amount of range.

You can't change them. I believe the Cybertruck is going to let more non-truck people experience the convenience of a pickup rather than converting gas truck owners. For example, I would never have a gas pickup because I rarely need the bed and it wastes gas and would rather rent when needed. But now, if the truck is about just as efficient as a Model X, I would definitely choose to have the bed as I can carry stuff without renting and have a machine that looks badass"

"The problem here is that, quite probably, by the time the Cybertruck becomes available to the general population, GM and maybe Ford will have an EV truck variant on the market around the same time. For example, Ford announced the Momstang Mach E a couple of weeks back, and it will be available next Fall... about a year after initial unveiling. The Tesla Model 3 was announced in 2015, unveiled in 2016, and it wasn’t until Q2 2018 before substantial deliveries took place. If the Cybertruck follows a similar release, it will be 2021 when it ships in any numbers. So, I would imagine at that point the Cybertruck’s ability to “destroy any other vehicle” timeframe will have expired as EV trucks from GM and Ford may be hitting the market around the same time period. I seriously doubt, however, that GM or Ford will be able to sell EV versions of an ICE truck in the numbers that Tesla is seeing with preorders for the Cybertruck. The F-150 is about due for a ground up redesign, I would guess that Ford will design in an EV variant for their next truck redesign. What I would like be to see is an EV truck with a motor at each wheel. You could spin the thing around in a circle, without moving forward or backward, like a tank."

"Don’t be fooled into thinking that’s a stable position. As time goes on, demand will wane and supply will grow. 

New gigafactories will be built and resolve a lot of the supply chain issues currently plaguing production, and over time more competitors will release EVs and will be heavily advertising them. 

Not to mention that we’re still in a heavily “hyped” phase for Tesla and EVs in general. Tesla is still the “cool kid” with the latest features and great design. But complacency only results in losing that over time. Tesla could and should be thinking about how they’re going to compete in a market saturated with EVs, not the current starved market we’re in."

You also missed that online headlines, including those consumed on social media and news aggregators like Reddit, as well as online video advertisements, very much exist and target all of those demographics you mention. But it doesnt even matter because if you **really** want to attract car buyers, you need to target the actual car buying demographics.

As I said in the other comment, Tesla’s strategy might be working **right now** but times will change, and they’ll change relatively quickly. Complacency is no joke and Tesla needs to think about how they’re going to attract customers in a market full of EV cars from all manufacturers because that’s where we’re headed."

"> WTF? why would it ""shift to a much less efficient operating point""? that is literally the opposite thing a transmission is designed to do.

Because an ICE has a horribly narrow operating range.  And if you've ever driven a loaded truck, it ramps up to a higher RPM setting in tow mode, almost universally.  But you're right, transmissions help here.  A CVT would be best (and even better than an electric motor).

Page 4 of [this PDF](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/2015-ford-f150-2.7l-engine-tier2-fuel-mapping-process-2016-06-20.pdf) has a nice BSFC map for a *Ford F150 EcoBoost 2.7L Tier 2 Fuel*.

And [this PDF](https://www.engiro.de/fileadmin/pdfs/Datenblaetter_engiro/370W/ENGIRO_Datasheet_370W_29012_ABC_V002.pdf) has an efficiency map for a representative modern permanent magnet electric motor.  Notice how ridiculously large the high efficiency (>= 96%) region is.

When  you size an electric motor for a vehicle, you typically end up with a setup that has a LOT of power left over at a typical cruising speed, so when you press on the pedal it feels like you have a lot of torque available.  There's a specific term for this ""left over"" torque, but it escapes me.  An ICE typically has less torque available before it has to shift down to a new gear at cruise, especially in overdrive.

> Put a load on either motor, and see which one can hold full locked rotors before melting.

Spindle motors and vehicle motors are both are typically liquid cooled PMSMs, what's your point?

> p.s. when you are towing 14k lb, aerodynamic drag is the least of your concern.

*puts on southern accent*  boy, this is downright ignant."
"You’re right on. ICE are more efficient under load. Naturally it burns more fuel going up hill, but it is actually more efficient overall. This has been demonstrated by “hypermilers” in the Prius. You accelerate hard, then turn off the engine and coast. It’s impractical and obnoxious but I tested it once in gen 2 Prius and easily got 70mpg on a long trip."
">>An ICE generally has less torque “in reserve” at a given RPM, so it will probably have to shift to a much less efficient operating point.

>WTF? why would it ""shift to a much less efficient operating point""? that is literally the opposite thing a transmission is designed to do.

>Electric motors have torque curves too. The notion of full torque from 0 rpm to max rpm is completely misunderstood on this subreddit. 


A transmission has set gear ratios. If it can't make the torque required in the current gear, it will downshift to avoid lugging the engine. Downshifting isn't incredibly efficient, because it needs to go to a higher RPM to make more power.

An electric motor does not have a transmission, and does not have to pick between gears.

> Which electric motor? the one in my hitatchi magic wand? it's got enough torque to rattle your fillings from down below. Or do you mean the one in the tesla truck?

>There is only one type of electric motor that has a nearly flat torque curve, with a majority of the torque available from 0 rpm. That motor can be found in a high end CNC lathe.

Sarcastic comments aside, no idea what the fuck you mean by there being ""only one type of electric motor"" found in high end CNC lathes.

AC motors? Cause those aren't exactly cutting edge. We've had those figured out for 50+ years or so.

> p.s. when you are towing 14k lb, aerodynamic drag is the least of your concern.

Drag is always a concern if you're on a highway, or travelling at higher speeds."
">Only the back wheels are spinning through while the front wheels are slowly turning backwards. There is also no 4x4 badge on the side of the truck

None of this means it was not in four wheel drive. Just because it is in four wheel drive does not mean it looks like it is, not everything is a cartoon world with everything responding perfectly. That is why the telsa won, because regular 4x4 is not perfect.

>There is also no 4x4 badge on the side of the truck

Once autonomous driving gains more traction there will most likely be some government mandate for standardized communication between different makes and models. Kind of like an OBD-2 standard but for neural net driving.
"Someone's going to lease the tech to everyone. And even though Tesla has pretty low overhead if the Audi and Mercedes of the world are offering a competitive car you'll most likely get superior build quality which will drive engrained buyers into what they are used to.

People who would buy a Hummer would buy this.
Power stroke make 1000ft/lbs of torque. That combined with its gearing would mean a power stroke would probably have at least 50% more wheel torque then even the tri motor.
"Trying to climb a steep hill while towing in an old ICE is no joke. 

I think people would get the difference if you put a 10,000 load on both of them and drag race up a steep incline. The Tesla would accelerate while the ICE would just keep getting slower and slower."
Yes?
"All fair points. It'll be interesting to see if those companies with much less experience in the EV field can pull out off. They have mostly failed in the car space, so I'd be surprised if they could beat the cybertruck's numbers on their first attempt. The next few years are going to be very interesting indeed."
"Motors in wheels is a very very bad idea... and I really don't think that any1 can build a car like Tesla simply because Tesla's software and hardware is way ahead of the competition...

I have a model 3 and the car is so good on the software part, that the fact that it can do X number of KM's in one charge is not the biggest of my concerns... The other manufacturers will have to do many things right to be able to have a chance to compete against Tesla"
"You're comparing a highly established and respected vehicle to something so outlandish and different that most people are repulsed by it. Elon himself said that it ""wasn't for everyone"" - and now we know how much he wasn't kidding.

"There's artificially low demand right now because of lack of awareness of how EVs in general are superior for most use cases (i.e. especially if you have multiple vehicles, drive a decent amount / yr, and are able to charge at home).  We're just pushing past the point of early adopter penalty right now, and demand isn't even close to what it will be even in a couple years.

"Yeah, turbo cars just do not drive as well at the limit, at least not the small displacement non-ultra high-end turbo engines normal people drive. I hear super car turbo engines are superlinear, but I have never experienced that.

All the track experience I have with quick turbo cars mostly consists of me wishing it was N/A. Sure torque shoves are great going in a straight line but when you are trying to ride the limit the throttle response on normal small-displacement turbos blow.

The 4C was obviously designed to be a bare-bones lightweight driver's car, but the bean counters did not let a new N/A or supercharged engine, or manual transmission be designed for it. It could have been a great alternative to a lotus or boutique brands."
"It’s absolutely designed to be a modern Miata. But expensive. 

It basically has no fancy features, a cheap bare bones interior, and a mechanical unassisted steering rack. It has no screens, no satellite radio, no gps, no driver assist features but a mandatory backup camera and optional rear sensors. Little to no space, low power, and is designed to be super light. If anything it is even more bare bones then a modern Miata. 

The only fancy tech is has is a DSG transmission, which is its biggest problem and goes completely against its design philosophy of lightness. A 4C with an N/A V6 and a manual transmission would be a killer car."
"Nope, it's very barebones compared to something like a Cayman. It doesn't even have power steering. The radio looks like [this](http://www.rssportscars.com/photos/cars/2015-alfa-romeo-4c-spider/alfa-4c-spider-86-radio-m.jpg)."

Yeah Doug demuro said that as well. Honestly it all comes down to user preference. I really don't think the cybertruck is a really great truck for heavy duty work.... but then again there's a huge number of people who just buy a truck for the sake of getting a truck and never really use it for truck stuff. That's a significant percentage of the market especially here in California and I think that's definitely going to be a big percentage of cybertruck sales. Comparably a lot of luxury SUV's have some small stuff (creature comforts) that are 'better' than a model X P100D for almost a third the price but it sells because it's an awesome and unique SUV that can go FAST. Cybertruck is similar.
"Exactly. Thats why I said it is not great for real heavy duty work. For example if you are using the truck to move or tow long distance, with the range loss it makes the trip that much more difficult. I frequently drive from So Cal to Nor Cal in my Model S and I have the 70 so I have to stop at least 3 times. I absolutely dont mind and in fact enjoy the breaks and the convenience of Autopilot than driving in my MDX like I used to. However if I was working and doing something with a trailer it would be hard. Its pretty hard to charge with it as well. Like I said, this is more suitable if you buy a truck for sake of having one rather than really NEEDING one"
"As someone who doesn't ""speak truck"" (never owned one, don't know the difference) what makes a vehicle a ""truck?"" why is the F150 or F250 a ""truck"" but a Cybertruck is a ""car with a bed?"" 

Is it the power, the towing capacity, the separate license plate (at least here in some parts of Canada)? The higher ground clearance? Something else I'm missing? 

Genuinely curious, as I have only ever driven compact 4 door passenger cars, and my understanding of ""truck"" is limited to ""car with bed."""
No! That doesn’t fit the narrative!!
"Possibly, I’m just happy that there’s finally some action in the truck EV market. Really excited for cyber truck"
"Or they know they would mislead people that don’t really know anything about cars, which is the majority of their fanbase. They knew what type of shadiness they were doing. Either that or they were truly incompetent. Choose one."
"Or Tesla knew their fans don't care when Tesla does unfair comparisons. The outcry on here is gigantic if any other entitiy (other brand or car show or whatever) does a test where they skew results or make unfair comparisons.

"I like that in Australia we don't share the American idea of a truck.

Next up from than that is a light truck which carries 4 tonne

Cybertruck will be a big ute here, only the electricians will be annoyed by it, since they won't be able to replace the tray with a box, it'll perfectly suit most of the other tradies"
Maybe on an F-450.. we're talking about F-150s here... which would get dominated.
"Yep.  And I think all of us that have used trucks and heavy equipment to actually get stuff done have been there done that, so it speaks to us.  
  
In a sense, I think the truck market is an easier sell than the luxury car market.  Sure, people might associate farms and rednecks with backwards looking anti-progressive people.  But they know how to evaluate price vs performance in a very real world way, and will even value things like solid stainless steel body panels (because they are measurably better on a job site).  But in the luxury market you're trying to sell feelings and emotion."

I suppose I'm not seeing your perspective. Are you saying someone shopping a Miata would cross shop a 4C? I see the two cars in entirely segments. One is a barebones lightweight FR car and the other is almost like a miniature stripped down Ferrari 488.
Yes but I don't know of any Miata shoppers cross shopping a 4C. It's like saying a Raptor and Gwagen 4x4 squared are the same class of vehicle because they both go off-road.

"I think the bed not being swappable is a big one. Sure you can throw on a topper but it's def gonna be specialized. Where as gas truck beds can be lifted off and bolt on another bed type. I think that's a huge factor. I'm also not sure where the cybertruck stands but also the difference between unibody and body on frame, if it's unibody I can def see why people consider it not a truck in addition to the bed issues, also idk if it can tow a fifth wheel/gooseneck with the bed design. Also charging may not take long for a several miles but it's def an issue for some rather than gassing it up in a few minutes. I live in AZ and I've seen a handful of electric chargers (like one hand) wheres gas stations on every corner.

For the record I'm not hating I love the truck but it's def a consideration I frequent the trucks sub too and I see the arguments made for other vehicles on why they aren't trucks. I think it's more truck nerd type than worker truck but time will tell. I'd love one but if I owned a company that needed a truck it may not be practical with the bed and any long term travel (the range is impressive very much so but you still can't beat gas on fill time unfortunately). I'd love to see some variants though that could fix these issues the cab would be fine standalone imo with different bed types that are more standardized also and 8ft bed would be nice. Several people I've talked to questions the range when you start towing with it too."
Exactly. It's so frustration how everyone thinks of a group of people one way without having a clue what those people are really like.
"An F150 makes 510 ft/lbs of torque, combined with 4x4 4-LOW gearing it would make more toque then even a tri motor. It would probably make comparable or more torque in just first gear with an aggressive rear axle. You severely underestimate the torque multiplication of gearing.

Reality is though you can get the power stroke in an F250 for less than even the RWD cyber truck so it's totally a fair comparsion."

">the other 3 weeks you save a thousand dollars in fuel

A thousand in fuel? Sure maybe for some people who drive 100k miles a year, but the average is 13k miles a year, and that is grossly increased by a minority of people who drive a ton. The vast majority drive 10k or fewer miles a year, meaning about 1k or less in fuel a year depending on where you live and how new your truck is.

For people who need to drive trucks tens of thousands of miles a year, it will save them tons of money. But for the average person, they might save a little after they pay the extra costs of insurance and tires. But that ignores the extra initial cost."

So no, it's not going to make much, much more torque.  I guess we can wait for some real-world tests in a few years.  I just would never bet on any other motor beating an electric in torque."

Assuming all the model 3s delivered through q2 2019 were 100% backlog (too high assumption), that's 276k deliveries. Tesla said they received ""over 500,000"" preorders. That means even with a far higher deposit, **at least** 45% canceled."
I thought we were talking about people that use their trucks for work. The average consumer never tows anything long distances for money. Work trucks drive a lot. That's why businesses buy them. My friend who builds cabins in rural BC routinely spends a 300 hundred a week on gas.  My buddy who does parking lot salting/plowing + landscaping in the summer has a way larger gas bill than that.

">and the gear ratio *may* be almost double, so at best the torque doubles

Wait....what.... you serious?

Completely ignoring 4-LOW, which has as much as a 53:1 ratio, the first gear of the 10 speed is  4.69:1 and the rear gears go up to 4.30, that means torque is multiplied 20.167 by the 1st gear and the rear end alone. It also gets multiplied by the torque multiplier in the transmission, which is typically 2.5:1 although I am unsure of the exact number. So as much as 50 times the torque just in first gear, imagine what that is in a 53:1 4-low gear.

You need to learn how this stuff works."

They opened up ordering to all about 9(?) months or so after the first reservation-holders were getting their cars, so having a reservation after that point was quite meaningless.  At a count of 200k+ already, getting a Cybertruck reservation now is really not even worth $100.  It’s mainly just a way to register a vote of confidence at this point."
"No one said anything about a dedicated work truck. Let's face it if you're going to drive 2k+ miles a week for work you're going to get a cheap fleet truck, there is no way any calculation beats that.

Even if you got a tri-motor for 70k your range towing would probably be less then 300, for highway even less, and in the cold your probably talking less then 200 miles, that's a dealbreaker for anyone seriously using a truck for work long distances.

It's people who want the luxury trucks that this is competing against. Plenty of people tow a horse trailer or a race car 4-5 times a year and otherwise drive low miles around their town. That's a massive use case for a truck of this price."

">So what’s the best truck to compare it to?

That is actually pretty difficult, I should probably make a post to explain this but it will probably get downvoted to hell.

There is a big issue comparing legacy ICE trucks to the cyber truck. They are outfitted in completely different ways, one will pretty much always have more of one type of option and less of another, on both sides. So it's always possible for people arguing the cyber truck case to say ""But the cyber truck has X"". In the same vein, it is always possible for people arguing for the F150 to say ""But the F150 has X!"". There is no good way to have the discussion honestly and intelligently with two passionate people, which is why this sub has been a big argument fest the last few days.

For instance, the price difference between the F150, F250, and F350 is really not significant, you just get the model that fits the capability you need. Legacy trucks also come in a ton of different trim options and package options and are discounted 5-10k less than MSRP.

So the question is, what are we going to use as a comparison? Are we going to use the street price to compare or capability?

A top of the line limited F150 will absolutely be more luxurious than a cyber truck, so I imagine a middle trim lariat with 4x4 and a crew cab with tech package would be the best comparison to the AWD dual-motor cyber truck. But those F150s  go for less than 45k, so that's a massive price difference.

People point out that the top end tri-motor cyber truck has more capability than the F150, but they ignore that an F250 is not significantly more expensive.  You can get a 4x4 crew cab lariat (same options as the above F150) for less than 50k, and it will tow somewhere around 35k lbs with a gooseneck trailer.

People like to point at only the raptor having the same ground clearance as the cyber truck. But that ignores that the raptor is a purpose-built rally truck made to take jumps at full speed and is heavily reinforced to take the abuse of a Baja race. It's a completely different segment unique to its own, it's not about the ground clearance.

On the side of the cyber truck, no ford will have the full features of the autopilot suite. Sure it will have good lane assist, and good adaptive cruise, but it will not be as hands-off. That being said ford has tons of other tech that Tesla does not. Also none of those fords will have quick 0-60 times, the quickest is the F150 with the V6 at 5.1s 0-60.

&#x200B;

To TLDR, I think a lariat trim F150 with the 3.5V6 and a tech package is the best comparison to the AWD cyber truck. The same trim V8 RWD F150 would probably be the best comparison to the RWD cyber truck. I think the same trim F250 with the gas engine is the best comparison to the tri-motor. Those are significantly less expensive though, and realistically you could go up to the highest trim and it would still be similar or less in price."
"I'm talking about the weight of the F150, basic physics says it has less traction.

I am referring to 4-low, because you were. If you need to use it to tow whatever you're towing, then you're going to have a tough time getting onto a highway from a stop.

Also, do you really want to bring up fuel economy against an EV?

Cybertruck is years out, if they see demand for a gearbox, they'll add it and continue to crush the competition."
"Basic physics also says you only need to overcome the resistance of the wheels of the load you are towing. 

F250s are certainly lighter then what  the cyber truck will be, yet can tow nearly 3x more.

I bring up efficiency because that implies a high top speed for that gear. Meaning no issue with highway speed.  There are also multiple 4-low gears, of varying ratios."
"The problem is that the F-150 (now you're saying F-250?) cannot accelerate quickly enough starting from those lower gears, picture the way a semi accelerates from zero. So yes, *accelerating* to highway speed is an issue.

Anybody can make a 10:1 gear ratio and claim a higher towing capacity, what you sacrifice is acceleration and top speed at that ratio. Ford likes to skew their numbers by putting out that 4low number as their max capacity, ignoring that your acceleration takes a huge hit to get that capacity. 4low is great for towing heavy things when there's nobody else around like moving something on a jobsite, but it's shit when you have to safely merge or when you hit a stoplight.

Comparing torque is a better way to get an overall look at how a vehicle is going to perform while towing because as long as you have the torque, you can get an idea of how the balance of tow cap vs acceleration will work. Ford will be maxing out at 1050 lb-ft of torque(before transmission), and the Cybertruck is estimated to be around 1000 lb-ft.

&#x200B;

Fuel efficiency does not directly translate to top speed, you could be horribly inefficient (which all of Ford's lineup are when compared to an EV) and still get the same top speed out by having higher rpm's (unless of course you're already at the ideal RPM for that ratio and have to change)."

>I’m not even going to finish reading this.

Go ahead, hide from facts."
Gear ratios **increase** torque through multiplication. This **increases** acceleration performance.
"Torque doesn't necessarily increase acceleration, when you shift up and gain acceleration, you're actually losing torque. If you apply too much torque, depending on the weight you're pulling and the weight of your vehicle, your tires will just spin out.

Torque does not always increase acceleration, that's why I said you're the one who doesn't know what he's talking about.

This is why the cybertruck weighing more is good, it allows them to have more grip, more grip means you can put more torque into your tires. *This means that the cybertruck will be able to accelerate faster than the F-150.*

&#x200B;

You're a broken record, ""more torque means more acceleration"".

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear\_train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_train)

Scroll down to ""automotive applications"", and look at the chart with the gear ratios. First, second, and third gear all give you torque at the cost of revolutions. Fourth gear is 1:1. Fifth and Sixth gear sacrifice torque for more revolutions. You don't slow down when you shift from fourth to fifth (at appropriate speed), you speed up.  


When you shift from fourth to fifth in this example, you are losing torque but still accelerating because the tires are able to spin faster to keep up with your current speed.

I'm the only one posting with sources to back my claims, all you're doing is repeating yourself then throwing out a childish insult."
"This makes zero logical sense.

&#x200B;

>First, second, and third gear all give you torque at the cost of revolutions. Fourth gear is 1:1. Fifth and Sixth gear sacrifice torque for more revolutions.

This is correct. You need low gears for quicker acceleration, and the higher gears to allow the car to operate at higher speeds.

&#x200B;

>You don't slow down when you shift from fourth to fifth (at appropriate speed), you speed up.

What? Why would you slow down from switching from fourth to fifth? Your torque decreases due to torque multiplication being reduced, but your top speed increases due to the same reason, engines can only spin so quickly.

&#x200B;

The only reason we have gears is that engines have a band from X-Y RPM in which they produce the most power. They also have a range in which they are the most efficient, these ranges typically are not identical. If engines were able to rotate at near-infinite revolutions we would have a single gear with an insanely aggressive ratio. This is the reason why many EVs only have one gear, because they can rotate at higher RPMs. It is also the reason that the Porsche EV has two gears, they want higher acceleration at specific speeds.

The simple fact that these gears exist 100% disproves your theory. Which RPM range produces the most power is 100% dependent on the engine, but even children know you downshift to accelerate quickly as a rule of thumb. When you floor it in an automatic car, it downshifts automatically, not upshifts. No one says ""QUICK GET INTO 6TH GEAR TO ACCELERATE QUICKER!""

&#x200B;

Horsepower is equal to (RPM \* Torque) / 5252

&#x200B;

This means to increase horsepower you either INCREASE RPMS, or INCREASE torque. Decreasing RPMS and Decrcreasing Torque is literally the opposite of that."
">What? Why would you slow down from switching from fourth to fifth?

Oh really? Is that what I said?
>You don't slow down when you shift from fourth to fifth

Oh wait, it wasn't, further demonstrating your inability to read.


>the higher gears to allow the car to operate at higher speeds.

Oh wait... are you saying that the higher gears, which sacrifice torque for RPM, allow the car to accelerate at higher speeds?


> but even children know you downshift to accelerate quickly as a rule of thumb

That's not true, if you're already moving faster than the lower gear can spin the tires, then the added torque from downshifting won't do anything. It's like pedaling a bike downhill, once you start moving too fast for the current gear, you shift up, losing torque but gaining revolutions.

>When you floor it in an automatic car, it downshifts automatically, not upshifts

That is not always true, the electronics gauge your speed and current RPM's to determine whether to shift up or down, many times not shifting at all. 

Yet again, you prove that you don't understand the basics of gear ratios."
">Oh wait, it wasn't, further demonstrating your inability to read.

You said this, "" You don't slow down when you shift from fourth to fifth (at appropriate speed), you speed up."" And I am saying of course not, there would be no way going to a higher gear would give you a lower top speed.

&#x200B;

>Oh wait... are you saying that the higher gears, which sacrifice torque for RPM, allow the car to accelerate at higher speeds?

Haha, so predictable, here is where the gas lighting happens. We are talking about increased acceleration, and how increasing torque influences acceleration, period.

The only limitation of the speed is based on the RPM limitations of the engine, that is completely independent. MORE TORQUE EQUALS MORE ACCELERATION, the limitations of the maximum RPMS are independent of that statement. This is how physics works.

&#x200B;

Unless you want to say torque, as well as the rate work is done is irrelevant to acceleration, which will redefine how everyone knows physics, I think you backed yourself into a corner.

Have fun in your next physics class, maybe read up a bit.

>That is not always true, the electronics gauge your speed and current RPM's to determine whether to shift up or down, many times not shifting at all.

The reason it would choose not to shift is due to over-revving the engine, which is again independent of this conversation. Or some turbo charged engines have a calculation where the extra torque created at low RPMs due to their small turbo surpassed the extra power created by high RPMs due to their small displacement engine. Small turbos run out of steam at high RPMs. But that is a very specific unique situation and follows everything I have said without contradiction."
">Haha, so predictable, here is where the gas lighting happens. We are talking about increased acceleration, and how increasing torque influences acceleration, period.

Oh really? Here's a perfect example of you denying the core fact of the argument, ""the higher gears to allow the car to operate at higher speeds"", yes they do, by increasing RPM's and allowing the car to accelerate more.

So if increasing torque increases acceleration flat out, then how come the reduced torque from upshifting ends up giving you acceleration?


>The only limitation of the speed is based on the RPM limitations of the engine

Not true, you can use gears to give you increased RPM's the same way you can use them to get more torque.

>The reason it would choose not to shift is due to over-revving the engine, which is again independent of this conversation.

It could also not shift because it is already at the best available torque/rpm ratio for the speed that you're traveling.


>Haha, so predictable, here is where the gas lighting happens. We are talking about increased acceleration, and how increasing torque influences acceleration, period.

You're completely overlooking the fact that torque CANNOT increase acceleration if the wheels cannot spin fast enough. 


You really have no clue what you're talking about, you're contradicting yourself by saying that ""the higher gears to allow the car to operate at higher speeds"" Those higher gears SACRIFICE TORQUE FOR RPM'S, yet they still accelerate the car.

You're still acting cocky, and you have yet to provide anything that disproves me. 

Give me one legitimate source that says that increased torque always increases acceleration and I'll say you were right."
"You should be able to figure easy stuff like this out yourself. This is blatantly common sense.

>If you want faster acceleration, you’re going to need more torque. So how do we get more torque?

&#x200B;

>""the higher gears to allow the car to operate at higher speeds"", yes they do, by increasing RPM's and allowing the car to accelerate more.

You do not understand the simple definition of acceleration and what quicker acceleration means. Acceleration is a CHANGE in velocity, meaning a larger change in velocity is quicker acceleration. Torque and rate of work is literally what causes the increase in velocity. Just because a car engine can not rotate at infinite RPMs does not mean that torque and rate of work done is irrelevant to acceleration. If I were to remove the engine limiter and deliberately over-rev the engine it would be accelerating quicker then it would have in a higher gear.

A calculation is a calculation, you may say unfortunately we can not rotate at higher RPMs, but that does not mean if the engine could rotate quicker it would not be better to stay in the lowest gear possible. Again, if our engines had infinite RPM capabilities first gear would be the best gear for acceleration, always. Again, this is why EVs have one gear only most of the time, because they rotate at higher RPMs. That limitation and efficiency is the only reason we have multiple gears.

&#x200B;

>You're completely overlooking the fact that torque CANNOT increase acceleration if the wheels cannot spin fast enough.

Haha, wheels? The issue is the engine rotating too fast, not the wheels."
"A blog post is not a legitimate source of information, so well done on that waste of time. If that's how you do your research, I can see why you have so much trouble understanding this.

>Haha, wheels? The issue is the engine rotating too fast, not the wheels.

Go drive a manual, get up to about 5000-6000 RPM, then downshift and step on the gas. Your RPM's will shoot way up without much acceleration because all of those rotations are being converted into torque by the transmission.

There's no other way to explain this to you, you've been cocky and arrogant the whole time so I'm done trying to educate somebody who literally admitted to not reading my comment."
">A blog post is not a legitimate source of information, so well done on that waste of time. If that's how you do your research, I can see why you have so much trouble understanding this.

Dude, Acceleration literally equals force/mass, force is torque. A = ( F / M ). It's directly derived from Newton's second law of motion.

>Go drive a manual, get up to about 5000-6000 RPM, then downshift and step on the gas. Your RPM's will shoot way up without much acceleration because all of those rotations are being converted into torque by the transmission.

And the issue there is the rotation of the engine, not the wheels.... the wheels are not going to blow up, it's the engine that is. Regardless of the range of useable RPM of an engine is irrelevant for the equations determining what variables increase acceleration.

&#x200B;

This stuff is elementary, I have to imagine you are literally trolling at this point you are resorting to discrediting my sources and changing topics.

Is Wikipedia good enough for you? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque)

>For example, a rotational force applied to a shaft causing acceleration, such as a drill bit accelerating from rest, results in a moment called a *torque*.

If you know anything about how cars work you will know how this applies to vehicle acceleration.

Seriously, go ask your professor. I will take my physics minor, dual computer science degree and computer engineering degree, and 15+ years of automotive, aerospace, and nautical engineering and go elsewhere. I am also done.

Seriously though, if you really believe what you are saying ask someone you trust. Let them explain it then."
Does 'average car' include everything on the road in Q3 2018? Or only the cars produced or sold in Q3 2018?
That's a bit of a ridiculous statement. You can't just meaningfully compare autopilot safety with average car safety.
"With active safety: One crash every 1.92 million miles

Without Autopilot or active safety: One crash every 2.02 million miles

How does this make sense? It's safer without AP or AS? Or is it too earlier and I'm reading things backwards?"
"Wow, if this trend continues Tesla could save so many lives"
"The average car includes all vehicles, seeing the average vehicle is over 10 years old, and autopilot is used the vast vast vast majority on the highway, where crashes occur infrequently, this data is pretty irrelevant.

As it currently stands, data on accidents occurring with autopilot on will always be skewed due to it being used almost exclusively on highways."
"The last line of the title isn’t relevant. You’re comparing 2 entirely different things. 

One is a nascent software, made by nobody else before Tesla, learns over time and has massive scope for improvement. The other is just a car."
"Love Tesla, terrible analysis. 

Tesla is new - their improvement rates SHOULD be better than everyone else’s, and this doesn’t even mean anything significant. Their ratings could have started out terrible, so 41% improvement might still mean terrible. 

Why not just compare safety ratings to safety ratings, an actual comparable number?"
"The average car in America is old and there are a lot of them. The problem with your comparison is it is extremely hard to make the average move on a large dataset. There are over 250 million cars in the US currently. Even if all new cars sold were 3x safer (300% Increase) and only crashed once every 1.5 million miles. The industry would need to sell almost 43 million vehicles to match Tesla's 30% number, an impossible proposition. Wikipedia says they only sold 17 million in 2018."
IMO these statistics are still very meaningless.
"Why don't they have numbers for non-Tesla, driver assistance on vs driver assistance off/not avail? Using non-Tesla average would skew 99% of the data toward driver assistance off/not avail. This is some bad analysis."
I mean progress is great and all but I still get a lot of phantom braking! and I'm just cringing for the day when I get plowed from behind because my car decided to panic stop for a shadow!  I had three phantom breaking incidents just Sunday alone. Plus I don't count this as phantom breaking but my car likes to heavily hit on the brakes if somebody crosses the street in front of me but well ahead of me where they would have obviously made it across no problem before I got there. also if somebody makes a right turn in front of you the delay is too long. Tesla needs to improve the prediction type computations the computer should be smart enough to know the car in front of me will be out of the way by the time we get there. it should be a lot better at predicting ahead of time like a human would already know that car crossing way ahead is no threat.
"I think its unfair to compare the safety of an incomplete and in development specific feature to the overall safety of a car.

Let the downvotes come"
"Yay! Numbers from a small sample!

I love Tesla and what they're doing but this is a bit premature."
">With active safety: One crash every 1.92 million miles
>Without Autopilot or active safety: One crash every 2.02 million miles


Maybe this is a margin of error so let's call it even, but it's curious that a Tesla with active safety on doesn't differentiate in safety from one with it off? Edit: Ok, I see it's substantially better in Q3 2019, at 2.7 million miles per. 

I'm skeptical of the comparisons to US average crash data. The average car is 11 years old, and AP miles are all on the freeway where crashes are more rare than city roads, and AP use probably self-selects for conditions and weather people will risk it in and manual takeovers aren't counted, so I wish Telsa provided more granular data.


>Especially if every other automaker is improving safety by only 1% each year.

This is a really bad conclusion - as I mentioned the average car on the road is 11 years old, it's possible that year to year increases in *new* car active safety are substantially better than that and are what drags the average of all old cars up. Especially where we're now coming into a time where a lot of them are becoming standard equipment, and things like AEB have a documented and substantial decrease in accidents.


(sorry...Data analyst...Non-like comparisons drive me crazy!)"
"Ok. Personal anecdote time. Last week my model X saved me from a crash. Any other car, this would have been a simple but ugly crash due to mis calculations. 
I was not distracted. Aware that I need to be extra alert. Both hands on the wheel, me looking forward. Took an exit from one interstate to another interstate. Road curving and flowing with traffic. I work next to this interchange and have taken this exit 100s of time. 
The difference here, I just travelled 22 hrs, landed last night with a 12 hr jet lag, a had a good night sleep. My reflexes, I come to find out later, were not as sharp. 
I had a 6 car length distance but exiting at a high speed, usual for this stretch. But suddenly there was traffic. I hit the brakes thinking I have enough space and time. Evidently it was not enough.
But the car knew better. It rang the alarm. While I was processing this, thinking that I am already slowing down and wondering my Tesla is overreacting. It applied the brakes harder. The tires screeched. In an instant I came from 6 car length to 6 inches behind the car in front of me. Fuck. I just avoided ploughing into the car ahead of me.
Next 15 minutes, to home, I am doing the speed limit, thanking all the engineers for saving my behind. My reflexes were slow and my car looked out for my shortcomings and took control. One day I can see myself giving up control completely and dozing off on my commute."
"From the article: 

> Answering The Tesla Bears

Protip: If someone is ""answering bears"" they are likely arguing a financial position and probably not your most impartial source. Anyone taking positions against ""bulls"" or ""bears"" is likely writing things with a left hand column that isn't ""have an impartial gauge of Tesla""."
Oh look another obviously misleading and ultimately useless piece of information on the internet.
"> On Autopilot: One crash every 3.34 million miles  
> With active safety: One crash every 1.92 million miles  
> Without Autopilot or active safety: One crash every 2.02 million miles  
> US Average (NHTSA data): One crash every 492,000 miles

Note that Teslas already start with 4x better crash rate than US Average. This is probably due to the type of people who buy Teslas.

Also, Autopilot is only for freeways, so that also inherently reduces the crash rate. It would be very helpful to see Tesla freeway crash rate with and without Autopilot."
I love the marketing on this sub.
">#3: Autopilot is only used on highways, crashes are less likely to occur there.

>Luckily, Tesla has been releasing their safety data every single quarter since Q3 2018, and we now have a perfect set of YoY data to compare. Seasonal trends in road safety (snow, ice, rain, etc…) make comparisons of Tesla’s Q4, Q1, and Q2 data against their original data difficult, but each passing quarter we’ll get a clearer picture of the trends forming in Tesla vehicle safety.

They didn't even answer their own question."
My teenage son is a 39% better driver than last year. He still sucks.
When has been the last reported death while in Autopilot?  Has there just been like 1 case this year versus the millions of miles people have been driving with it on?  You can already make the case now that it is saving many lives.  Even if folks still give it grief.
This sub: Elon Musk fuck my wife
I saw a model 3 rear end another driver at an intersection last week and I immediately thought of driver error.

I witnessed the active safety for the first time this weekend and it was pretty crazy. A car started to veer to the right where the tesla was and the tesla veered right and slowed down to avoid a collision and then it shifted really quickly back into its lane. The other car didn't actually get into the tesla's lane since it moves back but it was crazy seeing how quick the tesla responded and how stable and agile it was when it veered so quickly.
"Autopilot does 90% - 95% of my driving now. I just handle the stops and turns. It used to do some phantom breaking in residential streets. Now, it's much more intelligent. Its particularly cautious on bends in residential roads (slows down) but resumes speed as the vehicle moves out of the bend. Stills brakes when approaching parked 1/2 ton trucks tho even when there is plenty of room. But, overall, ap gets better and better."
Couldn’t this also just mean that auto pilot could just have more distance to cover before it matches cars?

Autopilot being 30% safer since Q3 2018does not equal Tesla cars being 30% safer since Q3 2018
">30% safer

How is this measured? Crashes in that time frame? If so how is a ""crash"" defined? And importantly, what other factors about the vehicle or the environment could contribute to the decline? i.e. if may or may not make sense to attribute all this decline to Autopilot performance"

How many people died on AutoPilot? Just the Apple guy and the empty tractor trailer guys?

"The headline sounds like a straight up quote from 1984. 

Meanwhile food production is up 36% this quarter, we are still at war with East Asia, and food rations will be reduced by 2% next quarter."
"Eh.

1. The average non-Tesla is 12 years old, thus any improvement in Q3 2019 is vastly outweighed by much older cars, far older than any Tesla. A 1% improvement could actually be much more if you just look at new cars and remove a zillion very old cars from the average.

2. Tesla makes more cars now, so their percentage is weighted much more towards newer cars.

3. Autopilot improvements have many variables. How do you know Autopilot is safer rather than people just use it safer? The more it's used, the more people get familiar with what it can and can't do, and they become safer as they learn. Also, people in general have a less 'self-driving' impression of it and more of a 'driver assistance' view. This means they know they need to pay more attention, hence likely will be safer.


So yes, this is not a good way to look at the data."

"I'd chalk it up more to statistical variability.  When we're talking only a few dozen crashes, a couple of crashes more here or there are essentially noise, but can easily push those numbers around a few percent (5% in this case).

"Not sure, I found that odd too. My first guess is that the active safety system wasn't very good back in 2018...to all the older Tesla owners, is this accurate?"
My guess is that the drivers with AS think it’s safer so they pay less attention to the road leading to accidents.
"""Lies, damn lies and statistics"""
The writer asked the same question and his assumption was that since the non-autopilot/non-active-safety cars are older Model S/X cars they are mostly owned by older more wealthy drivers who drive more conservatively. The newer cars are dominated by younger less wealthy owners who statistically drive riskier.
"So I had my first accident in 15 years of high mileage driving 2 months ago. I commute in a 2018 Nissan Leaf with pro pilot (which is like an kindergarten version of auto pilot). The system malfunctioned and drifted out of lane and I side swiped another car. I was in a dazy state when the accident occurred, wasn't really paying attention. I was just kinda sitting and letting the car drive down the freeway. Over the last 8 months before the accident I had grown extremely comfortable with the active cruise control and lane keeping. When the system failed I wasn't expecting it. I'm definitely to blame, but I doubt this would have heppened in a vehicle without these aids. I will absolutely never trust this system again and I can't wait to get into a bit more reliable. 

On a side not, I have an order in for a Model Y and I'm betting that auto pilot by that time wont have any problems on the highway."

"There will be a time in the not so distant future when no one will remember a person getting injured, let alone killed, in an automobile."
"Yes but, I think we need to curb our enthusiasm. I was sold on the idea that autopilot is safer than human drivers based on crash rates, but the way this statistic is being represented has the potential to be hugely misleading.  It's true that crash rates per mile are lower with autopilot, but autopilot is also generally used on highways, with clear markings, in non-severe weather. The data they're comparing to includes poor weather (and older vehicles and different driver demographics).  


I love what Tesla is doing but usually when I see safety stats being quoted, they're picking and choosing to show the most favorable numbers possible -- I'm not surprised, that's basic marketing -- but I wish I could see a more honest assessment."
I said this is another comment. I just think the author doesn't have a background in stats.
"> The obvious conclusion from these findings is that Tesla cars are safer than the average US vehicle (quoted from article)

He lost me right here.  Apples and oranges."
Autopilot usage went from 11.1% of driving in 2016-2018 to 12.9% in 2019. It's slowly accounting for more miles driven in Teslas. No longer just a one-trick highway pony.
"That's the major problem automakers will face. The longer this goes on (Tesla rapidly improving AP/active safety while other OEMs just build non-improving cars), the tougher it will be for them to attract new customers."
"There's value in the comparison of 2018 Tesla vs. 2019 Tesla.  I still think the numbers are on the low side for statistical analysis, but 30%+ is a big shift, and worth looking into.  This article works backwards to figure out the total number of crashes based on the number of crashes / mile Tesla gives and Fridman's numbers.  It would be better to start with the primary data, which I'm sure Tesla has."
"Thank you for adding this so I didn’t have to type the same thing.  This is a terrible misuse of data and statistics.  

My children are 20% taller than they were last year, and I haven’t grown an inch.  Best of luck to them getting a jump shot off against me though."
I mean their actual safety ratings are still the safest by a substantial margin.
Why would being new mean their improvement rates are better? Their benchmark figures are already 4-6x safer than other cars. That alone should make it *more difficult* to improve from quarter to quarter.
"That's the crux of the problem. The industry can't possibly keep up if they're waiting 20 years to update their customers safety system. Tesla improves every single year. When you buy your Ford F-150, it will never get any safer until you replace it in 20 years. So that 300% safer figure is actually spread out over 20 years. Tesla's figure is one year."
This is not indented to be a study of how much safer car X is than car Y. I think everyone would agree that the comparison provides little value.
"The non-Tesla data comes from the NHTSA, other automakers don't publish their own data."
"You gotta pick a better fight.  There are some bad analyses in that article, but that is not one of them.

You absolutely can compare Tesla to non-Tesla, just like you can compare apples to lard.  If 99% of non-Tesla cars don't have driver assistance, it doesn't matter.  It still highlights the overall benefits of the added features in a Tesla.

It would be nice if they had more data so we could compare with other driver assistance systems.  That doesn't mean there's no value in looking at the bigger picture."
"Not comparing the absolute safety, I'm comparing the *rate of improvement* in safety"
"The sample is definitely small, you're right. But in the last year, the sample of AP-enabled cars in Tesla's fleet has doubled from 350,000 to 700,000. It doesn't take many more 'doublings' before this data is a meaningful % of the global fleet."
"AP miles aren't only done on freeways. I use it regularly on city roads, and religiously on regional/state freeways. Stop signs and traffic lights are the only times I need to be in control. 

Re the conclusion: I should have used the word average in the sentence you hgihlighted. Otherwise, I stand by the data. It doesn't matter that new Fords are safer than the 1990s Fords they're replacing, the rate of improvement is too slow and lumpy to compete with Tesla. If we break down the safety improvements every Ford customer sees, we may get a 20% improvement when they trade in their vehicle (once every 20 years). It still averages to 1%. That new Ford is going to spend the next 20 years improving 0% per year, while every Tesla improves each year with or without trading up to a new car."
"Luckily I've never needed the emergency braking (have a vw touran), but it is quite reassuring that it beeps at you when you break a little late. (it beeps at you and if you don't react it will brake automatically)"
You might want to read the full article before commenting next time.
"And most of them(at least the ones that were reported) were driver error, the only one where AP caused it was [this one](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/02/tech/telsa-autopilot-crash-suit/index.html)."
"My guess is that it was probably in the last 3-6 months.

There were roughly 70 autopilot accidents in the quarter, and I believe crashes in the Model 3 have a 5% chance of serious injury or worse. 

So I'd estimate ~ 0.5-1 Autopilot death per quarter in 2019"
Active safety being 41% safer since Q3 2018 means all cars with active safety on (like mine is 100% of the time) are 41% safer since Q3 2018.
"You're missing the point.

Yes, new cars are more than 1% safer than old ones. It's probably more like a 20+% improvement from a 1990s car to one today. But because the life of a new car is like 20 years and they never improve once they're driven off the lot, they average out to 1% per year.

The safety of a Tesla improves over the air. So it's entirely pointless to argue about the age of Tesla vehicles. They all get the same safety updates on a regular basis, and they all benefit from the learnings of the rest of the fleet."
"Weird way to flex your ignorance, but OK."
"So this comparison makes no sense? Got it, thanks."
"> I'm not trying to make a comparison to the absolute safety of the cars. I'm comparing the rate of improvement for Tesla vehicles, and using a benchmark of all other vehicles in America for context.

You're not measuring the improvement of Tesla vehicles, you're making a comparison of a single relatively new feature vs a whole car industry.

>All I'm saying is, Tesla cars are getting a lot safer, really quickly, while the average car in America is basically as safe as it was last year.

That's not true though, what this means is that Tesla autopilot is getting a lot safer, you can't go comparing that to the average car in America, it's absurd. Even if you could compare these figures this still wouldn't make any sense, since you're comparing a mature industry to a new feature. Of course the Tesla autopilot should be getting better much much faster, than the entire safety of the vehicles. The safety of vehicles in total has well over 100+ years of development on Tesla's autopilot, it'd be crazy if a 100 year old industry was still making 30% increases in safety in a single year."
"Re-read the article - it is consistent with a more diverse set of drivers, since 80% of new cars are Model 3s.  

i.e. Younger riskier drivers."
"This was in Q3 2018. Now, Active safety gets into a crash once every 2.7 million miles."
"I'd like to see whether the vehicles are as safe as human drivers when driven comparably; currently Tesla AP is a mostly highway autopilot, and highways tend to be safer than urban streets."
"Yeah there are a lot of uncontrolled variables here. Hard to make any real conclusions without more controlled studies (driver age might correlate with likelihood of disabling active safety, for example)."
Thanks for the info!
"Over reliance on the system perhaps? Example from my arse:  texting and driving double with active safety because people think it will save them in any situation; but people without continue to pay attention. 

Just a guess."
"> It seems odd that active safety has an increase in wrecks.

Are we sure those populations are the same? It could be that different *kinds* of drivers are using different features."
Probably people drive less carefull when they think that the car will stop in an emergency
The variance seems not to be statically significant.
"Autopilot is typically for highways and long simple roads; so the less risky environment, fewer stops or lights, turns, cross traffic and such compared to (sub)urban driving with or without active safety. OTOH, there's a limit what autopilot or active safety can do to defend against morons determined by their bad driving to take out someone around them."
Exactly this.
It could also be that crashes are less destructive. Getting a fender bender with the feature preemptively breaking vs slamming into a parked tow truck at 70 mph.
That lane-drift thing tried to swerve me into a cyclist and a police car the one day I had it enabled. Is that active safety?
"Regen was too strong which made it like you were brake checking those behind you. Other than that, seems the same."
The difference in the side pole test results were pretty crazy. The Tesla barely had any intrusion at all.
I hadn't seen that test set. Thanks!
Very anecdotal and subjective but I agree. They make the best cars! (in my opinion)
"I’d say I agree, and that their core competency is actually the production of high capacity batteries and the deployment of them across varying use cases."
"In my opinion, Tesla has a larger proportion of software engineers than any large automobile company."
IMO ^^^^[In ^^^^My ^^^^Option] Tesla is aiming to be a renewable energy company that happens to make cars.
"That’s when the mommy bloggers start an anti-safety-feature movement. Because safety features cause spina bifida, or some shit. ￼"
It's rare enough that a Tesla crash already makes the news.
"Even if cars are fully automatic I imagine there will be enough factors out of their control that cause accidents occasionally.

But probably low enough that each one makes the news, unlike now where you could have dedicated crash news channels and have too many to report."
"Ok, we are decades away from that. Even if Tesla’s are actually full self driving no humans in the car capable within 10, it’ll take another 40 years to get all older cars off the road."
"I do have a background in stats and the OP is making a valid point.

The point is that the vast majority of Teslas on the road, regardless of when they were originally shipped, got significantly safer from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019. This happened because of updates.

The remainder of the US fleet of vehicles had very little change in safety, because those cars don't have updates that make them safer.

IOW, buy a Tesla, and your car will get safer *after you buy it*. 

This means safety improvements in software become available to the entire fleet instead of just new purchases like other brands."
"Yeah.

Honestly, though I feel like it is pretty obvious even not knowing anything about statistics that this data is not comparable. A massive number of accidents occur in parking lots and back roads, something that autopilot can not do. That alone would be logic enough to realize."
"Yeah, simply stating two sets of data and then saying ""The obvious conclusion is X"" is wrong nearly always. No one who knows anything about statistics speaks like that."
The manual literally says only to use on divided highways.
"While I completely agree with this, I was trying to say the comparison is misleading. One is a software (partially) controlling a car, the other is a car controlled by a human. It’s like comparing a human learning to play a piano to a tortoise doing the same. The latter has no scope for improvement and hence shouldn’t even be used for comparison."
That’s my point. Why use an outlandish analysis when you can just use the safety ratings?
"4-6x safer under what specific subset of conditions?  Autopilot is mostly engaged during straight highway travel, and many accidents happen in parking lots, backing out of driveways, and side swiping along neighborhood streets — times when autopilot isn’t engaged."
"I think you missed my point. Even if they started today and every car was sold with over the air software it would take years for the average on a whole to move even a little bit simply because of the sheer number of vehicles already on the road.

Eventually, Tesla will suffer from this problem as well. They very likely won't be able to continue to make safety improvements for every car using only ots forever. Eventually, AP1 will no longer be updated, and AP2, and finally AP3. Or their gains will slow down and they won't be as incremental anymore or they'll have squeezed all the juice from the lemon.

Basically it is disingenuous to compare averages in the way you are doing."
"??? You can't use the data and apply it to rate of improvement of new models from cars. That data is currently missing...it would be like if I looked at the same data and said look it shows Teslas (Tesla is part of the entire average right?) rate of improvement in safety is only 1% !  (Which is incorrect conclusion since we have some data that says otherwise). 


All most posters are asking is for some data that allows us to see make and models from recent years and with driver assistance and safety capabilities for a much better comparison."
"doesn't matter who publishes the data, you can't compare apples to oranges. The non-Tesla data is essentially no driver assistance, because 99% of the cars on the road don't have driver assistance."
"I totally agree and I hope it stays that way. Remember though that globally, there are a hell of a lot more cars than that. 1 billion +. And you're right, if that growth is maintained then we'll get there very quickly.

I'm thinking the thing that's going to tip all the govts globally is a bigger sample. I personally can't wait for that."
I did.  Which part of the article do you think I didn't read?
That one was still driver error. He failed to take over even though he knew that specific exit had been misread by AP in the past. Autopilot screws up all the time but accidents are still the driver's fault because ignoring the 'keep hands on wheel and be prepared to take over at any time' prompt *is* driver error.
"How do they keep track of autopilot accidents?

My Model 3 crashed into a truck on autopilot last weekend (nobody got harmed), but I don't think Tesla knows about this. No airbags got triggered and the car still works, even though it needs extensive body repair."
"Except there is no evidence to back this up. How do you know Autopilot is actually significantly safer and it's not just people becoming safer when using it?

Consider the first bikes: Did the second versions of the bike get much safer, or were people just better at riding them after a while?

Consider Autopilot: If you never got an update to a new version, would you become a safer driver each year as you got more experience with it? Of course you would because you'd know its weaknesses and be more vigilant.

Tesla safety could *in theory* improve over the air, and in theory they could get less safe with a bad update. There is no indication the improvement is as meaningful as the percentage claims. The longer people own their Teslas, the more familiar they become and thus the safer they become. The more cars that talk about ""autopilot"" and driver's assistance, the more realistic and reasonable people's expectations become and the safer they become."
"Lmao, they can’t even make the damn main computer last past a few years because of a single memory chip."
Teslas made before Q3 2018 are just as safe as Teslas made after Q3 2018 so it makes sense. Not Tesla's fault that they're the only ones delivering software updates to their customers years after their purchase.
"*Over the air software updates made self driving cars X safer. Normal driving cars have to be manufactured to be safer, people don't get much better.*

It makes sense to me from self driving vs regular driving cars perspective."
"It makes sense, just in a different context. All other cars have normalized accident rates. We're looking at this data to understand Tesla's normalizing accident rates. Is it getting better/worse. It's unfair to put the data for Tesla/nonTesla side by side. Only useful so you can see the overall benchmark."
"Lots of similarities as well though, human driver, 4 wheels, similar speeds, accelerator, brake pedals (abs systems), mirrors

Also this is accidents, not injuries."
Uhhhh.... Tesla's numbers also cover every Tesla on the road (not just the ones made in the current quarter). Nice try.
"Tesla safety is improving much *faster* than the whole car industry on average.

I keep active safety mode on 100% of the time in my Tesla. Are you really going to argue that my Tesla isn't more safe this year vs. last year? The data shows that a Tesla with active safety on crashes 41% less frequently than last year. Nobody with an old Ford experienced the same improvement in safety as I did."
I’m one of those younger risker drivers. I like to go 28 max in the 25mph city streets while everyone else is swerving through lanes at 30-40mph without signaling. Maybe it’s time I unleash this cars true potential and kick it up to **29**mph. I do like to live life on the edge occasionally.
Wait are you saying young and new drivers are driving model 3's? Surely not?
[deleted]
"ulimitedcome was talking about the crash rate with active safety being higher than without in Q3 18. The article isn't saying anything about this. (The diverse set of drivers is used to explain the difference in Q3 18 vs 19 numbers without active safety.)

I would suspect this is due to small sample size leading to high error bars on these numbers."
Is this demonstrably true from some data source?
"There's also the fact that the acceleration profile is significant compared to most cars people have owned.

It isn't just ""younger, riskier drivers"". It's just ""riskier drivers""."
"Also, these are statistics meant to represent the average distance between accidents. Any average measurement would have some uncertainty. 

It could essentially be saying that they aren’t statistically different."
"This would be difficult to quantitatively demonstrate, because the number of human driven miles utterly dwarfs AP miles."
Yeah it seems like there's a lot of factors that aren't controlled for.
"/u/SodaPopin5ki The article only table-summarized the Q3 2018 results. Q3 2019 saw the 40% increase in safety being talked about, per /u/30trillioncells's post: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dritrb/autopilot_is_30_safer_than_in_q3_2018_and_teslas/f6j6wei/"
"Yes, that's one component of it. I think it also covers the warning chimes you hear if you're about to hit a car, maybe auto emergency braking too."
This is an excellent point. How many “crashes” were the Tesla getting rear ended?
Lol that's not an opinion though
seatbelts cause heart attacks because they constrict your chest!!!!!
"There are hundreds of news/articles about other manufacturers accidents day by day but those are ignored in here. 
There are also lots of Tesla crashes that doesn't make the news.

Teslas are save vehicles, but so are bmw 5/7 series, Mercedes S class etc. 
Those also avoid accidents with AEB functions without news. But Tesla, as good as they are, just generate more clicks."
"Yes, but he didn’t lead with this point.  He regurgitated the apples-oranges point first.

> The obvious conclusion from these findings is that Tesla cars are safer than the average US vehicle"
Well said
The data would suggest people are using it for more driving scenarios in 2019 vs 2018. Guess that's the first time someone has defied the laws of a product manual.
"But that 1 accident in 498,000 miles doesn't account for all accidents either. For example, I can tell you anecdotally that some crashes aren't reported: 

1. Hitting a sign and denting the car at slow speeds (friend's experience), not reported to anyone. 
2. All the snow wrecks where no damage occurs and they have to get towed out of a low slick spot. 
3. Bumping into and scratching other cars in parking lots
4. off-roading dings and dents
5. And so on.

What I'm getting at is that the NHTSA collects skewed data too. ([link for some data on under-reporting](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812183)) We might find that people are using autopilot in a lot more places than just divided highways, i.e. state 2-lane ""highways"" (recently learned that ""highway"" is a really vague term). 

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All those points about skewing aside:

What we do know is this: most fatalities are at high speeds. A lot of accidents do happen on the highway. Tesla's numbers are improving, whereas I bet you $5 that human highway driving is improving only negligibly. I doubt, highly, that it is less safe to have autopilot on (in terms of total accidents, not sure about fatalities). And if they improve by another 30%, that is amazing and means autopilot is really, actually making a difference in the world.

Just 2-bits from someone less statistically skeptical."
"No, Tesla will not run into this problem. The problem isn't that vehicles are getting old, weighing down the average, the problem is that non-Teslas can't get better once they're driven off the lot. 

In 2029, my Tesla will be a safer car than it was in 2028, the Tesla fleet is constantly feeding its learnings into all the rest of the fleet. It won't matter that my car will be a 10 year old car."
"The non-Tesla data is an average of all cars in America. All that data is showing is that US cars on average are getting safer at a snails pace (1% per year). That's the fault of other automakers for not installing and improving their own driver assistance systems.

Tesla cars are becoming much safer, much quicker.

I don't understand how you don't see that."
If you want to compare apples to apples you need to have cars with the same amount of power / torque too :)
The part where the criticism of highway usage is responded to.
"For now, I would agree with you. But for the sake of discussing the safety of this technology for the masses, we should assume no one takes over......"
[deleted]
"Doesn't make sense in any context. The number of new cars is insignificant compared to the number of old ones, so the old ones weigh the average down massively. 

You should only count cars that existed since Tesla existed, and even that would be suspect given many other variables.

This is just not a meaningful stat."
"Not even as overall benchmarks, the statistics for active safety systems and autopilot safety don't necessarily represent the overall safety, comparing those percentages is meaningless and misleading"
"The point is that Tesla is a new brand. If it’s being compared to 1980s Kias, it’s not a great comparison."
I hope yo see the problem here but to speak in your terms I would love to see the average price and average age comparison included there as well.
"Yeah, but the average age of a car on the road today is significantly older than all Teslas. The average age of a vehicle on the road today is 12 years. So any improvement in 2019 non-Teslas is significantly minimized by the gazillion cars that are super old.

Also, Tesla is making far more cars now than before, so their average is biased towards later years.

It's just a dumb way to look at things. Also, how do you know Autopilot is safer now than before? Couldn't it also be that Autopilot is merely better understood and so people are more aware of what it can and can't do, thus being safer while using it?"
The average age of Teslas on the road is small compared to other brands.  That means the data for cars other than Teslas is going to be dragged down by the high percentage of cars that don't even have modern collision avoidance features.  If the data removed all cars manufactured before Tesla started producing cars the improvement would be much higher.
Slow down!

"Ugh, I still make full stops at stop signs, and it's gotten me honked at on more than one occasion."
You’re going to jail dirtbag.
"I think maybe more implying that if new or young drivers are going to drive a Tesla, it would be a model 3 and not an S or an X.   

While unlikely, I'm sure there are some teenagers and very new drivers out there driving Model 3's."
"Why not? I got to drive rental cars of all kinds already (including Model S) for more than 10‘000 miles already, so i do feel prepared to own a Model 3."
Here in the Bay plenty of kids out of college are driving Mosel 3s. They are basically the Civic of Silicon Valley.
"I would posit that most Model 3 owners are driving the fastest cars theyve ever owned, myself included. Whereas a lot of people who can afford an S or X are already coming from expensive/fast cars. 

I came from a Honda Civic 😂😂"
"Agreed, but how about a comparison between human crashes per mile of highway driving vs Tesla (AP and non-AP) crashes per mile of highway driving.

That would be a good initial start, later it can be reduced to Tesla highway AP vs Human highway non-AP."
"Tesla could somewhat give us this lens. Obviously there is selection bias here, but if they released stats about highway mile safety with and without AP on, it would be potentially meaningful comparison.

Again, understood about the selection bias."
"Then I can see why it caused more crashes! I guess it's improved, so I should try reenabling it..."
"I don’t know, but the most dangerous thing mine has done on autopilot is braking hard for no reason. I’ve had to panic accelerate far more often than panic brake."
"I mean, it's not all bad though, right?  So if we get cars to be so incredibly safe that the seatbelts are now the worst injury caused in a car crash, then more research will be done to improve or replace seatbelts with something even safer.    


There will always be a least common denominator."
I've also heard great things about Subaru accident avoidance.
I think there is a massive burden of proof needed to even suggest something like that. The fact that the statistics are being compared in the first place shows that no complex thought was done to discern the cause for the statistics.
"In 2018 Autopilot cost $5000 as part of EAP.  In 2019 it's included with every car except the base model SR (which isn't even on the website).  Troy's data showed about 70% EAP purchase rate in 2018, which then goes to about 100% in 2019.  With more drivers having AP, it makes sense it'll be used more, even if just on highways."
"> No, Tesla will not run into this problem

That’s a bold statement not backed by any evidence. Given that some safety features like blind spot monitoring are already not making it onto Tesla’s from before 2016 I highly doubt that your 2019 car will be getting significant safety improvements in 10 years."
"Do you really think tesla will care about your HW2 car in 10 years? Just like HW1 doesn't get the new features, HW2 won't either.

  


You can't do everything by software, some people just can't seem to realize that.

  


Also, VW has the VW automotive cloud which will be used for OTA updates for their cars, so no, tesla isn't the only one. OTA updates for cars have existed for years anyways, my Renault Zoe has apps (even though they're basically useless)"
"The average age of cars on the road is something like 10 years, way before driver assistance. So when you're averaging the accident rate of non-Teslas you are essentially averaging the accident rate of 10 year old cars, unless the accident distribution is heavily skewed toward newer cars. It's just basic statistics. You can't be compare these skewed averages.

It would be like comparing the average american weight to the average weight of a female gymnast. The average female gymnast is 15 years old and like 90 lbs. The american american is not. Apples and oranges."
"Yeah, it doesn't address anything meanigful.

They put out that autopilot has way less crashes per mile than non-tesla cars.

The obvious question is:  Is that a good comparison?

They don't answer it."
Do those cars just cease to exist to you?
"In the self driving vs normally driving cars perspective, it doesn't matter that there are older cars out there. 

All normal driving cars did not improve much vs all self driving cars improved X amount.

Were self driving cars are around for 40 years this would be the same, and in 40 years time the same thing can still be said.

I think it's more trying to suggest we should go 100% self driving."
"It does not work like that.

When you estimate the accident rate on the entire population of cars you end up with average accident risk of all non-Tesla cars plus the accident rate of Tesla cars. There no weighting anything up or down. We are doing a full population count, which means those two numbers are a fact derived on the full population of cars. 

If you had been trying to estimate the accident rate on Tesla vs. non-Tesla only using a small sample and not complete population data, then we could start to discuss if that sample was representative for the entire population. But it’s simply not the case in this scenario

Now, you can argue that newer Tesla’s outnumber old Tesla’s, but it doesn’t matter. It’s still the average risk of getting into an accident with a Tesla which reflect the current state of the Tesla fleet. Not a theoretical “what if everyone drove a Ford T?” question.

On top of that, people get accident rates and fatalities/injuries mixed up like crazy in this thread. 

Newer vehicles lower fatality/injury rates significantly due to improved physical security.

But very few vehicles lower the accident rate because most new cars don’t cure the main cause of accidents, stupid drivers. They won’t stop speeding, drunk driving or running a red light. Unless they come with very advanced driver support packages, which is reserved for a very small percentage of high end cars."
"As well as the fact that the statistics given in the title are for different things, autopilot safety and active safety systems aren't the same as overall safety, the comparison is meaningless regardless of vehicle categorization."
"You guys are arguing different points. I agree, all cars on the road as the measure means nothing much has changed.

But you are criticizing him as if he is arguing about relative safety of Tesla vs  the average car. But he isn’t making any claim of that. Just rate of improvement.

Second the rate of improvement achieved is not because of new cars but updates to old cars. The point is Tesla can update its whole fleet to make them safer. The average car on the road can’t. Maybe that’s not fair since the average car on the road has nothing to update, but that’s kind of the point"
Well it's still comparing cars to the last quarter. So not just how safe they are but how safe they were compared to a few months ago. Totally valid comparison in my mind.
What percentage cars on the road are 1980s Kias?
I think the slower you go the more likely someone will try to go around you and cut you off sadly. People will go in the opposite lane of traffic around here just to pass someone. Welcome to nyc I guess lol.
And get off my lawn!

I could very well get a model 3 but doesn't seem so smart at such a young age (19) probably wait a couple years until prices go down! How's the insurance? I tried getting a quote but the site told me bugger off lol
Yep - everyone is trading in their Priuses for Model 3's!
Yea you can't get into a crash if you're parked at auto zone buying a new head gasket
Lex Fridman maintains some solid data on Autopilot mileage growth vs overall fleet mileage growth. You can run the numbers yourself. See the sources section... https://lexfridman.com/tesla-autopilot-miles-and-vehicles/
Good point
"I'm not comparing absolute crash frequency, I'm comparing rate of improvement. Read the title of this thread."
"Rather than trying to tease out statistics from something that is, agreeably, a hard comparison to make, take a qualitative (with assumptions) approach.

&#x200B;

Autopilot percentage of miles driven increased from \~11%->\~12%. That is something we know.

Something else we know is human's don't trust computers, especially when they make a really bad mistake. For example if autopilot got you in a really dangerous situation, and you got out of it just barely (close call), then you will be very very likely not to use autopilot in the future, at least for a while, because you could drive the car better than the computer

That would mean, if people had a bunch of near misses or accidents with autopilot, they would use autopilot less. The fact that the % of mile has gone up tells an entirely different story:

Autopilot was trusted to drive 11% of miles and those miles resulted in people driving a higher percentage of miles on autopilot. I.e. they thought they were safer with autopilot on than themselves.

&#x200B;

People aren't that dumb when it comes to expensive accidents and their own lives (maybe a bad assumption), therefore, autopilot is safer than human driving (on average).

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: Due to the nature of neural nets, I suspect that autopilot is more dangerous in terms of fatalities and major mistakes and less dangerous in terms of everyday driving, yielding a slightly better overall safety rate."
"Comparing the numbers is kind of meaningless if you don't control for obvious biases in data like that, otherwise it's like you're doing a Tesla vs Ford comparison but using the average of all the models both companies ever made aka back to the model T days. We're not interested in the sum total integral of the safety record of a car manufacturer from the beginning of time until now, we're interested in how the state of the art compares between the two."
[deleted]
"Question: If Autopilot was still on the original version and never got updated, would users today have less, more, or the same amounts of accidents compared to on day 1?"
Except there is no evidence that OTA updates are responsible for improved safety.
"Yes, *that* part of the statistic is fantastic. That’s the data they should be communicating every quarter.  It’s as close to apples-to-apples as we’re going to see anytime soon. Very few confounding factors to consider."
I’m not very good with numbers.  40%? Maybe 50%? Definitely not 60%.
Yeah you have to follow the traffic not cause it.
"That happens to me. I'm going 44mph (cruise control) in a 40mph zone.  It's a windy street, lots of driveways connecting to it, lots of trees and blind corners.    


So the car behind me who's been tailgating me for about half a mile decides that 44mph in a 40mph is too slow. Passes me illegally, and then....never gets ahead of me because of all the stop lights and traffic.  

&#x200B;

Like...ok good job, you endangered not just you and I, but also anyone who could have been leaving their driveway or any of the animals that constantly cross this road (it's in the hills/mountains).  All for basically 0 seconds advantage. lol"
"Statistically, the safest speed is a few mph over the average speed of traffic (ref the Solomon Curve). Driving slower than average, even if that’s where the speed limit is, increases your chance of being in a collision."
My man!
"It's a subreddit about a very ordinary guy, Norman. He lives with his cat, who is also named Norman. 

Norman is an ordinary guy. He's not brash, he's not exciting, he plays by the rules. Just like how we live most of our lives. Every now and then Norman has something exciting happen to him. Maybe he'll drive a few mph faster. Maybe he'll try to say something witty to the barista who's always at the coffee shop. Or maybe not. 

The tales of his life, though entirely ordinary, are nonetheless somehow thrilling. And entirely relatable."
"Right? I sometimes feel less safe following traffic laws because I expect other drivers not to expect me to follow traffic laws. I still follow traffic laws, though."
Have a nice day sir.
"You've never seen people under 20 driving cars around 40k and up? I live in the UK and there's a kid at my school, I think he's 18, and drives an 18 plate mustang. We're talking £38k base model over here for that. Also see a couple of 18/19 BMWs and Mercedes, which we're talking 25k +. A friend of mine goes to a private school and there's an 18yo that drives a model 3.  

There are some people with really rich parents out there. Assuming the PRIMARY reason 17-19 year olds are driving 40k cars is because of their parents, that is. Not because they work and are able to afford one at that age."
"Yeah, at your age/especially for your first car I’d get a nicely depreciated beater. That way when you make your inevitable mistakes, you’re not financially boned. For insurance, I’d also try some non-traditional carriers (e.g. Root, which analyzes your driving behavior), as the big guys will charge you an arm and a leg as long as you’re under 25."
"The insurance is surprisingly reasonable. When I upgraded from my 2012 Toyota Camry to M3 earlier this year, my insurance quote was about the same. And I am the kind of person who shops for new car insurance every year to get the cheapest rate, so it isn't like i was sitting on an overpriced Camry insurance for years on end."
Well im a bit older so insurance would be slightly cheaper i guess but i think it also depends on how long you are already driving
"I've only had a few friends who have them, and we've never really talked about reliability. I just know they have a very loyal following."
"That is interesting data, but it has nothing to do with where the miles are driven. The only objective first-hand data we have is that Tesla says autopilot is only for divided highways. I think unless we see strong first-hand data, what Tesla says speaks for itself.

There is no other fact-based opinion to have."
you are comparing different average rate changes. the 1% safer for non-tesla doesn't make sense.
"You’re not doing a Tesla vs Ford comparison of battery pack efficiency for the model 3 vs a Raptor, you’re doing safety ratings. It isn’t meaningless. And if you’re going to exaggerate to the Model T which isn’t a car on the road anymore, unlike millions of college students still daily driving cars from 95, then we’re done talking here because you’re clearly off your rocker."
It's not about Tesla's...
"I would assume that there is no cars left with the original Autopilot software and as far as I am aware? Tesla didn’t deliver these statistics when AP1 was released initially. So we don’t have meaning-full numbers to compare with.

I haven’t seen number older than Q3 2018

https://www.tesla.com/da_DK/VehicleSafetyReport?redirect=no"
"I mean, 60% is obviously too high, so let's go with your 50% figure."
You’d think but I’m pretty sure the 25mph rules are there for a reason lol. I’ve seen tons of people speeding and crashing because they didn’t have the time to react. I’m talking like everyday I see an accident around here.
"Well I mean that’s normal city driving here but with 10 cars doing that each block. I like to stay in the left lane and try to match the car in front of me but some people think that’s too slow. A lot of blocks have two ones and they’ll try to pass on the right or something and realize there’s 900 double parked cars. Their genius solution is usually to cut me off without warning. Basically why everyone from NYC drives like a maniac. If you’re not constantly tailgating someone you’ll get cut off lol. 

I suppose once they leave the city they forget other people drive like normal people most of the time. A fine example is pedestrian signs and cross walks. I’ve never seen anyone stop for one when a pedestrian was standing by to cross. Outside of the city people stop in the middle of the road so you can cross."
"I don’t doubt this and I do keep up with traffic on highways and stuff. When people start flying at like 40mph on city streets with stop signs and stuff, that’s where you lose me. I’ll go maybe 33mph max on a straight city street but there’s a ton of cameras around here (triggered at 35mph) so anything more is just stupid lol. People fly through them and collect their $50 tolls but yea that’s a hard pass from me."
Basically it's reddit's version of American Splendor
"Yea that’s how it is. Some times it’s a bit safer to break the law like keeping up with traffic. Other times I just have to break the law because even pedestrians don’t understand them. For example a full on traffic light by me was replaced with a flashing red (treated as a stop sign). I always stop and wait for people to cross but they just look at me funny 99% of the time so yea I just roll on through. 

I feel like the constant speeding deal will be changed up real quick though since the city is adding a ton of speeding cams. Within the last year like 3 were added on my daily route which is only about 4 miles. Now there’s a total of around 6 of them. They don’t bother me since I don’t really speed though. My biggest fear and the only thing I can get a ticket for is my tints. I’ve been stopped for those once yea that never had a ticket in my life lol."
There was a girl in my high school who got a brand new Mercedes Benz for her 16th birthday. She totalled it 6 months later and her parents bought her a more expensive Mercedes.
Fair enough lucky cunts
"Doug Demuro mad a video that it does make sense to buy a used Mercedes or whatever for a child due to the safety features being modern despite the car being older. 

You can’t get a cheap used Tesla yet though. Not really anyway."
Analyzing my driving behavior feels creepy and intrusive. I don't need my whereabouts tracked and potentially sold to third parties for an extra buck. No Thanks.
"The flipside is if you fuck up, if you're in a modern car there's more safety features to keep you alive. Tho there's also more features to keep you in control that might let you have your accident at a higher speed. So I dunno."
"It doesn't say where miles are driven - that's a leap I think is reasonable to make. It would be nice if Tesla explicitly called out % of mileage driven on highways, but I don't think it's necessary.

Any casual observer/owner knows Autopilot is being used more frequently than last year. The use cases are expanding, Smart summon is a great example. Just because we don't have exact numbers to lean on, doesn't give us permission to ignore reality."
Complain to the NHTSA
"Basic statistics actually falls on 6maud's side:

For example, if each year we improved safety (some value) by even 0.5% (compounded) on each car model:

year 10 ago: value of 45 (made up)

year 9  ago: value of 45.23

....year 1 ago:  47.0

the average is *46.03*

If next year, we improve the fleet by the same 0.5%, the average rises to:

*46.26*. or a **0.5% increase**. I.e the ten year average makes zip difference for the comparison.

The *actual yearly improvement in the cars only needs to be 1%* (compounding) to get the NHTSA 1% increase last year, while *tesla just did 31% (in autopilot)*.

&#x200B;

If we did the same thing with teslas (previous 10 years of cars, averaged together), assuming their fleet continues to get software updates, thereby increasing their safety rating, the average would jump by **31% (compounded), every year.** So in ten years, we would see (assuming 15% increase from here on out), an average safety improvement of *405%.* Not the 10% we would get from current vehicles....

&#x200B;

Edit: original math was wrong

Further edit: [Active Safety Comparison link](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/22/new-report-shows-how-many-accidents-injuries-collision-avoidance-systems-prevent.html) (again, not representative, but helpful for ball-parking)"
"Obviously, but the comparison is not meaningful if you're comparing everything still running from an old automaker to what's new. They might as well just compare a 1999 Ford taurus with a 2019 and end with a shocked Pikachu meme, it's the same logic."
"That's not the point though.

The point is that safety using AP improves regardless of AP improvements because the longer people use it, the more aware of its capabilities they are and what it can/can't do.

It's like the users who find that their car constantly misses a turn or swerves towards the wrong lane. As they realize the flaws and limits, the begin to pay more attention to the weaknesses while leaning on the strengths."

"Where I drive you don’t even the ability to drive 40mph in a 25mph zone, because of traffic. 25mph zones are usually that way for a reason, although I have seen a couple roads where you’d think they should be 55’s and the limit makes no sense - often small towns where I assume they want to collect as much speeding ticket revenue as they can.  

There is something to be said about going the same speed as the traffic around you, though. Going to slow can easily be just as dangerous as going too fast in many cases. On many roads, you want to be moving along with everyone else. Everyone being consistent means they are being predictable. Being predictable is safe. 

The biggest thing I see with driving “carefully” is the damn highway on ramp. The one unique place specifically built for you to mash the gas and get up to speed and people don’t even want to enjoy it.... it’s dangerous to merge onto the highway going under the speed limit. I wish they had some sort of sign to remind people of that on the on ramps. 

I’m not saying anything about your specific scenario, I have no idea - I’d have to drive the road myself. I’m just speaking in general. I’ve been a passenger in a car with someone going slow to “be safe” who couldn’t grasp the idea that they were actually making the scenario more dangerous for all of the cars around us."
"No, no. That’s not how you drive, even the DMV handbook insists on this.

Keeping with the flow of the traffic *always* takes priority over following the speed limit. If that’s too scary for you, take the rightmost lane and stay in it.  But if you are not doing that then you are 100% making the road *more* dangerous for people.

The speed limits on the road are crafted with an understanding of human nature, ie propensity to ignore them to some degree. Where you should adhere to them are in situations that might count as aggressive driving - for example, you should not exceed the speed limit to pass someone.

Otherwise, keeping with the traffic always takes priority."
"> keeping up with traffic

Drivers around where I am like to go 70 in a 55. It sucks because I like Autopilot but it won't keep up with them."
I agree... but it's that (check the privacy policies) or the high premiums. Pick your poison.
"True, there's a huge difference in safety b/t the 2000s-era cars and something from the 2010s. All depends how much you're willing to pay."
">It doesn't say where miles are driven - that's a leap I think is reasonable to make.

I feel like that is a massive leap. 

&#x200B;

> Just because we don't have exact numbers to lean on, doesn't give us permission to ignore reality. 

The thing is, you are not saying ""people are using autopilot for more things"". I agree that is probably true. You are saying that the provided statistics show that autopilot is getting safer, and this is due to people using it in more places. 

That is a massive difference."
"How is a confused Pikachu meme going to rear end you while texting?

There are actually layers of this analysis and I would argue it *is* meaningful to compare by dividing the classes of cars.

This is what you can learn by making this comparison:

* OTA updates are making the cars safer
* cars that do not have OTA updates get safer at a slower rate than cars with OTA updates


Or to spell it out: A 2017 Model 3 is *getting safer* by a significant amount over time, a 2017 BMW M3 is *not getting much safer* over time."
"Or they grow complacent and start texting instead of monitoring the system crashing into fire trucks and trailers as a result. 

Many factors are in play. Just look at the seasonality between winter and summer in Tesla reports. 

Personally I believe that AP and similar features will continue to reduce the risk of accidents. There will bumps along the way, some accidents will most likely also be caused by AP. But in average? We will be much better of."
God-dammit Loch Ness Monster!
Yea no rules apply in NYC. I’ve driven through about half the states in the US and people from here just make up their own rules lol. Also the highway ramp is a good laugh. I agree but some of the entrances or exits are about 10 feet long to hit 50-60mph so yea... smart option is to just avoid driving in an exit lane unless you’re right at the exit. That or just ride like 20 under the limit or smash into another car entering. I’ve seen a lot of the smashing part though.
"I love on-ramps on my sport bike, but you still have to be weary of what you’re getting *behind* if you’re going as fast (or faster) than the flow of traffic. I’ve had a near miss or two where I’m being a bit of an ass on the throttle and forget about the people randomly slamming on their brakes **infront** of me. 

My fault each time but if people didn’t ride each other’s asses then they wouldn’t have to slam their brakes so often."
"Wow people are really concerned about this keeping up with traffic stuff lol. I’m in NYC talking about people flying at like 40 mph for a solid 15 seconds weaving through two lanes because cars are double parked and they want to go more than 3 blocks before they get caught by a red light. 

On a highway I obviously keep up with traffic."
"Couldn’t you just turn the AP speed up? I mostly drive on city streets but a week or so ago I went on a trip and rode down a rather narrow and curvy 2 lane stateway with a 55 limit iirc. I have no idea how but people were flying down it at ~70-80mph. I was just happy I had AP since it could handle it better then I could at that point lol. 

I did go down a like 6 mile straight away with no one else on the highway and floored it to 100 and that totally disabled AP until I put the car into park. Of course no one should do that though... but yea 10 seconds of fun in exchange for 40 miles no AP haha"
"Maybe a massive leap, I am definitely biased being a new owner.

But I'm not saying Autopilot is getting safer *because* it's being used in more places, I'm just saying it's getting safer *while* being used in more places. I'm really just trying to shut down the argument that Autopilot is only a highway tool and the moment it starts becoming useful in other situations, it's safety will plummet. That's clearly not happening so far."
"Yes that would be a meaningful comparison. Comparing Teslas to new 2018 cars in 2018, comparing Teslas to new 2019 cars in 2019, breaking it down into different manufacturers and comparing the change, compare it across city driving only, compare it across highway driving only, compare autopilot only, non autopilot only. 

The average car on the road today was manufactured in 2007..."
How would this data show it if 99% of the cars are not 2017 BMW M3s? The BMW data is mixed in with every junker on the road....which is why everyone is saying this comparison makes no sense.
"AP won't go a certain amount over the speed limit in Wisconsin. It might be different in other states.

Interesting, I didn't know that going fast would disable AP."
"> Maybe a massive leap, I am definitely biased being a new owner.

That's fair.

&#x200B;

I think that if it is ready to be used off-highway they will update their prompt to say it can be used there. Maybe that is me being biased, but I think it is fair to think a company will tell you a product can be used somewhere if it is actually ready. It's a pretty fair objective metric."
"And those cars manufactured in 2007 are staying exactly as safe as they were in 2007 (or less, I suppose if you assume degradation).

I honestly don't get why this is difficult to surmise. Maybe I pissed off some bmw fanboys by using it as an example."
Oh that’s interesting about the speed limit. My wife has had it set 30 over the highway limit before and no problems. Also I think not responding to the hands on the wheel thing will disabled it. I know going slower means it takes longer for the alert to go off. I’m assuming it’s the opposite the faster you go. Like I said it was a straight away so I wasn’t turning the wheel either way but I forgot I had AP on and I saw the blue alert start and then it went red after a fraction of a second and then it just disabled lol. I think going faster just made it fly through all the warnings really quickly and basically auto disabled AP.
"Tesla is using these numbers to claim that their new(er) cars are safer than the new cars of other brands.  They're doing so by comparing MUCH older cars to their cars.

Not only has safety technology changed significantly over the last 10 years, but buyer demographics would be different for each car.

Would a responsible 40 year old person with kids and a career buy a $2000 hooptie, or would it be the 16 year old kid that just got their license?  Regardless of the new $30k+ car the 40 year old bought, would they be more or less likely to be involved in an accident than the 16 year old?

Vehicle age + demographics of those driving that are more likely to buy those vehicles matters."
"My recollection is that AP didn't have a speed limit in Illinois when I drove there. I'll pay more attention next time.

Ah, I see. I thought that you disconnected Autopilot before flooring it."
Awesome.  I hope you and your dad can share in the joy of Tesla for years to come.  I am personally saving my first drive for when I can possibly own one... one day.  I don’t want to commit financial suicide over a car so it may never come but the thought keeps me motivated!  Your dad sounds truly happy!
"My dad has been in the car business for 40 years, was always a tesla critic, scheduled a test drive when we were vacationing in vegas. Before the end of the ride he asked me if I thought we could get a deal on two! Well done Mr Musk!!"
this makes me so happy. Part of the reason i bought my tesla is that I think my dad wouldve really geeked out on their speed and tech (loved porsches).
Your Dad has a great laugh. Infectious.
Pretty much my reaction every time I'm behind the wheel of one.
"Man I think we all remember the first time we activated auto pilot. Felt so wrong, but so good."
Tesla's sell themselves
[deleted]
I should buy one for my dad :)
El Paso?!
Hey Tesla if you could arrange a test drive for me in Milwaukee without having me come to Chicago I'd love that.
"That was my exact reaction the first time I bought mine and had it drive itself, it was so surreal!"
"Awesome, you are a good son"
"""It was his dream NOT to drive one."" There fixed it for you! :)"
/r/wholesomememes/
Could relate. I went to Canada recently and we rented a model 3 performance for a day trip to Mount Tremblant. What a fun experience it was.
"Did you drop the stick three times?

#""I GOTTA HAVE MORE COWBELL!"""
"Hey, that's El Paso! I love seeing you all driving around!"
"If we lived anywhere near each other I'd hand you the fob for my X for a spin.  I'm guessing we don't - is that Utah? Looks like 40 out near the airport.

ETA: nope, texas.  Still too far away."
"You are kind of a dick - a test drive is a kiss of death. 

Totally get why you did it and it's awesome, but kind of low key just made your dad 50k poorer lol. 

Glad he enjoyed it so much"
i am
Your dad’s laugh sounds like Rafiki from the lion king
"Thank you for posting this. Such a wonderful thing to do for your father, and it's a joy to see his reaction. I think this would put a smile on Elon's face too."
as a dad i approve this alot.
Get your hand back on that wheel!
I’d probably have the same reaction as your dad. Hopefully one day he can own one!! Wish you and your family well!
"I'm going to the El Paso test drive event this weekend too, I own a Model 3 but I sent forwarded the email I got to anyone who wanted to drive one. 

&#x200B;

I never test drove a single Tesla before buying my Model 3. I bought one, then one month later they invite me to a test drive at my local service center? They know I own one! It's great marketing, because of course I forwarded that email to anyone I work with who talked to me about my car."
"The unethical way is to look up Teslas on autotrader and take them up for a 'test drive' pretending you're an interested buyer, like many did when I was selling mine."
His dream is to drive a car that drives on his own
Is this in the inland empire?
My dads a sceptic of the tech for now. Til he visits me and drives mine 😏
Hahaha so good!
"THE FUTURE IS NOW OLD MAN!

heh jk 😉"
I preordered the bastard site unseen. It is almost impossible to make a bad EV.
"That's why it's a shitty move to keep increasing AP over and over, first it makes people happy, second it's safer, but only rich people will be able to get it in the future :("
That laugh is pure joy.

It will be the only time he'll ever been happy to talk to someone from a service center
"I’m a Tesla fan, and I get why people like them. The brand is cutting edge, it’s a high tech car of the future, it’s electric and is an environmentally friendly car. Those are reasons enough to me. But I don’t get why people say, “drive it once and you’re hooked.”  I have driven a Model S.  It was cool, but the driving dynamics wasn’t revolutionary to me other than the acceleration. It would certainly have to be “mind blowing” to be a better driving experience than what I currently drive (a new Audi S4)."
"Was expecting 0-60 launch, video did not disappoint."
I wonder how many more Teslas Tesla would sell if they did more Tesla-test-drive promos like this?
"Damn, those glasses be fast"
Somone buy the man a Tesla!
We're there no rest drives in your area?
This is super wholesome my dude!
"Man I really hope your dad gets a Tesla. The joy he has driving that thing is incredible. Tesla employees, is there anything you can do to hook him up with a discount? Passion and joy for a great product should be rewarded"
he has something in his teeth
"Although I appreciate his enthusiasm, I hope he understands it is safer to keep his hand(s) on the wheel at all times?"
"Absolutely don’t test drive it. You’ll wake up to a Tesla in your driveway a few weeks after. 

Source: am a victim"
I had a Toyota driver drive up next to me and said “One day I’m buying one!” ☝🏽
"can confirm. a test drive moved up my timeline on getting one drastically. i’d already had the deposit down for 3 years, but 7 months after the test drive, it was in my garage."
Damn I need to buy a house first before buying a car. That's gonna be like 10+ years from now. Just hope battery tech improved or other car manufacturers catches up in 10 years.
I did just that and got mine two days ago. Never even got close enough to touch one and now the only one i know is MINE. It’s an awesome feeling
I took a test drive a few months ago to make sure I was saving up for something I really wanted. I am still saving and plan to purchase in the Spring of 2020.
"I waited, and waited, and waited for 5 years before I finally picked one up.

Just brought home a model 3 in October. Stay motivated. The prize at the end is far worth the wait."
"I'm 19 years old and i'm about to get my first fairly well paid job, and i'm SO close to taking a loan and buying a Tesla. Would absolutely be a suicide though."
Can you get a deal on 2?
Only Tesla in the neighborhood? You must be deep East O cause they're everywhere here
"You should, I felt incredible joy seeing him like this. That’s my ultimate goal :)"
"Yessss, how’d you know???"
"What are you doing this weekend? Not sure what you’re looking for, but... We can go for a test drive my Model 3 LR RWD."
You are.
"This is what scares me. Us early adopters treat the autopilot with a twinge of fear, respect, and distrust. This is healthy for the current stage of the product.

People who are getting their first experience with autopilot now and think that because it can change lanes and react to traffic it doesn't need supervision are the ones who are most likely to get into real trouble when it comes across something it can't handle.

I'm not trying to be a party pooper, but I wish there was a way for the layperson to tell whether a given self-driving system is 99% capable (disastrous) or 99.99999% capable (human level).

And that goes both ways. Because I've had a Tesla with early versions of autopilot I don't really have an easy way to tell when it gets so much better that I can trust it more. I probably won't until they're racking up millions of miles on FSD without humans inside."
"I may have seen you and your model 3 around in EP lol, do you get compliments from the people here?"
El Paso.
It funds more factories and other Tesla products.  Over time the price will go down just by Tesla producing more vehicles.  Then you add in competition that will also lower prices over time.  Ignore any shorter term price increases while Tesla has production limitations.
"The 3 does an above average job on dynamics, the cornering and exiting a corner trying to avoid that (flawless) traction control when flooring is a joy on its own :)"
"For me, the responsiveness is a huge part. I was blown away by how quickly you could apply power. Basically zero latency from your foot being on the pedal to you feeling the result. It's an EV thing more than just a Tesla thing, but Tesla combined it with lots of power and it's quite addicting."
"> The brand is cutting edge, it’s a high tech car of the future, it’s electric and is an environmentally friendly car.

To be honest, those are not on my list of criteria when shopping for a car.

>  It was cool, but the driving dynamics wasn’t revolutionary to me other than the acceleration.

The metric for the longest time to measure performance of the car is the 0-60 times. Take any new performance car coming out, and the first thing people want to know is it's 0-60 time. And with the instant torque of the electric motor, it literally pushes you back onto to your seat every time you floor it, unlike anything else out there.

When I first test drove the Model 3, I had 2 other dudes with me. One of them own a Porsche and the other own a BMW. Plus myself and the Tesla employee, we had 4 dudes in the car, and when we put the pedal to the metal, we were all giggling like kids in a candy store. The Porsche dude ordered the Model 3 after the test drive. I ordered it 6 months later because I had to wait until my current lease to end."
"Yea he was quite excited, but after the clip he remembered that you need to give it a little tug and hold onto to it lol."
🚔 Autopilot Police over here watch out!!
"I understand the downvotes, I guess my comment made me seem like the AutoPilot Police, but I was genuinely asking if he knew that hands on the wheel is safer."
"I skipped the test drive. Ordered online. First person I talked to said,” Would you like to see your car?” Best car shopping experience ever. The drive is unfucking believable.

Edit: I gotta go cruise now."
Sounds like the start of a rehabilitation group
I am a victim too but I have no regrets.
Same thing happened to my dad. He test drove one and our model 3 should be here next month
#metoo
Agree. It’s like a drug. I have a friend that firmly believed he would never spend so much on a car. Today he’s 7 Teslas in with number 8 on the way. At least I stopped at one!
Yep. Held off test driving for a long time because I knew what would happen. Owner now.
I can verify it. I resisted after a test drive last year and after this year I woke up to one in my driveway.
"HaHaHaHa:

Me, too. Also a victim.

Needed a new car, it had to have California HOV stickers. Drove the Chevy Bolt: nice car, just like the 12 year old Prius it was gonna replace (econobox, same length, so it would fit in our garage with a major rearrangement).

Hey, honey: we gotta do our due diligence: let's go drive the Tesla Model S (this was 2 years ago).

Mistake! It was a lot more money( like, double). It was also not an econobox.

We ordered it the next morning, and have enjoyed the hell out of it."
I have driven a couple...still don't have one. Sucks being responsible and grown up. I really want a M3 Performance though.
"I let my wife drive my model s I bought 3 weeks ago. Now we have a model s and a model x. 

Impossible to drive one and not buy one if you can."
"You’re Internet famous bro

EDIT: not sarcasm. I was being serious! I saw his video on Tesla’s Instagram page."
"Exactly, I can buy a Tesla now but really need those finances to buy my first home. So maybe when Tesla is abundant in used market 5-7 years down the line."
Take it from me: you're gonna burn through those mxm4's crazy quick.  Make sure you rotate them frequently and get a nice set of Summer tires once they inevitably give up on life.
"With that timeline, you should consider the Model Y!"
More power to you!
"Be patient, wait a few years. 

Source: adult."
"Yea, two for the price of two."
"What would you say the average price of a home is in your area? Here they are around $200k. Unless we go into higher end neighborhoods (say $400k+), then we won’t usually see Tesla’s in the driveway. Wonder if they’re just more common in the well-to-do/expensive areas in the US."
That's one dream of mine. To surprise him with a car that he'll enjoy.
"On his birthday, you can rent him one on Turo, it's about $100/day."
The mountains give it away
I got an email from Tesla about a event at the El Paso Tesla service center this weekend and the mountains confirmed its EP haha
And this comment right here is why Tesla doesn’t need to advertise. :)
Whooa! Just hanging out! Live in Cudahy but would drive down anywhere in greater mke area. Looking to get a SR RWD so LR wouldn't be too much different!
groot.
Humans are actually more like 89 and the systems are 99 but yeh I get you.
"I have a white one with the 19 inch sport wheels. A lot of people stop and talk to me in parking lots, especially on Ft Bliss. 

I've seen a few on the west side and on base."
"I was scheduled to drive a VERY lightly used Model 3 at a local dealer a few weeks ago.  Literally as I drove up, I got a call that a family member had been in a fender-bender, so I shook my salesman’s hand, sat in it briefly, then had to run assist...timing was impeccably bad!  Anyway, I texted him back a week later to see if he had time to let me come for a test drive, and he texted me back the photo of the car that had been traded for it...a Porsche Cayman.  He must have been impressed!"
[deleted]
 You know that this requirement saves the company from liability. Legal trick and nothing more.
Still got pics of it in progress? That’s rad af
Electric sure is the future. Can't wait for Tesla to become a bit more affordable here.
"I’m not sure why you’re being downvoted. Maybe people didn’t know about the Toyota video. I would agree, he is relatively Internet famous."
"I’d give it two more years for 2017 Model 3s to be under $30k. High mileage will be around $20 like other luxury cars. 

I got my 2017 B9 A4 with 50k miles for $26,900 last January. Obviously Tesla holds their false a little more right now but I’d say 2 more years and they’ll be there."
How many miles until you had to replace your tires?
Thank you... i honestly needed this advice
Too expensive. I have a budget I am trying to keep.
Sold!  Man what a bargain
$400k gets you 700 sqft in the worst areas. Average is probably $700k in decent locations and $200k doesn't exist. We are also only about 15 miles from the Fremont plant so Teslas are literally everywhere which is why I made the previous comment.
You two are so wholesome. I can’t wait to see the posts when you are able to do this!
Where we live there’s only one Tesla and it’s $300 a day unfortunately.
I’ll PM you to set something up!
It's kind of a meaningless statistic without more specification. If it's 'accidents per mile' then of course both are much higher than 99%. If it's accidents per hundred thousand miles' then they're both probably in the 80s or 90s.
Hmmm not sure if it could be you but I go to EP fitness and there’s a white model 3 there all the time. From what I’ve noticed they’re a lot more common in the West side. Must be a great feeling haha
I don't think that's what's they meant
I wonder how well high mileage Tesla’s hold up quality/battery wise. And I’d be waiting for the $20k price range. I don’t think $30k is in my budget. That’s why I’m thinking closer to 5-7 years. Curious how the used market will be then.
About 30k?  Maybe 25 but I was dumb and the rears wore out quicker than the fronts.  Didn't rotate enough.
"That makes sense. I’m thinking around the US, even not near the west coast, Tesla’s become more prominent in higher end neighborhoods. Here, $400k range gets you a semi-new 2400+ sqft home. Most of the US can’t afford Cali."
Ahhhh!! Awesome looking forward to it! Thanks so much! :D
"Hi all! Following up post-drive with /u/mjburian, we spent an hour in his Model 3 LR and I loved it! 

* The acceleration was bonkers (naturally).
* The sound wasn't what I expected (more electric hum rather than silent), but it sounded bad ass and loved it.
* One pedal driving slowly became natural over the hour.
* Navigate on autopilot would take me a week to get used to but it was cool as all heck.
* Great conversation 
* Great way to spend part of the afternoon! 

As an investor it just made me 3x more excited about TSLA, and as a person... shoot... I've still got the adrenaline flowing, even 20 minutes post drive, and I could totally get used to feeling great all the time!"
With cars it's usually in the 1000 or 100 000 range but yeh
"https://youtu.be/f0cyxfxWjjg

This guy is over 55k miles on an early production run Model 3 With “significantly less than 5%” degradation according to a Tesla service tech he spoke with (they couldn’t disclose the actual number). So they’re holding up quite well. [Just recently someone passed 100k miles and has only spent $500 between broken parts that were his fault and tire rotations](https://electrek.co/2019/10/21/tesla-model-3-100000-miles/)

The Model 3 batter chemistry will last customers a very long time and their reliability should be on the high side. Especially with more recent production. I’d have no concern owning a Model 3 from 2018 after the 50k warranty personally, Tesla doesn’t even offer an extended warranty on the 3 even for new owners. My Audi? No way in hell I’d own it out of warranty despite how (reasonably) reliable it’s been so far. I’ve seen two parts and labor costs so far since owning the car and out of warranty I’d have spent $3000 so far in repairs."
How often do you recommend rotating? I just got a P3D- with the 19 inch sport. 1 month and already 2k miles lol
Cali can't afford Cali lol
Y’all gone kith in the Tesla or what
Glad it worked out! Sorry for the money I may have just cost you. 😉
"Thank you I’m for the links, that’s very informative. And yea, it seems that the long term quality has held up well so far. One day, they’ll be within my reach and I’ll gladly hop into a used one. Thanks again for sharing."
"I think the 19"" wheels come with different tires (Continental?) So I'm not too sure but I'd err on the cautious side and not go more than 7500 miles between rotation.  I did 10 and they were shot quick.  The fronts were less worn and could maybe have gone another 5k but they weren't gonna make the rated mileage either way.  I drove about 36k mi in a year though so I'm not exactly a common case."
Lol
you mean the Tethla?
"Sorry Mike Tyson, just gunna test drive it because as an investor I'd feel better and I'd like to know this is the car in my future once I have a garage."
"Holy shit, 36k?! Did you go on a road trip twice a month and drive Uber?"
"I took a few trips, let my friends use the car a bit to try to get them to get one, (have 2 waiting for model y, one referral, one saving for X) and my daily commute is 66 miles so all in all, yeah, basically."
I've been waiting to hear about the LR AWD 0-60 times. figured it'd come across this sub sometime soon.
"Hey it’s a post, about an article, about a post, we’ve come full circle, ha!


https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dwe1zw/tesla_model_3_mr_060_test_on_20193621_compared_to/"
What about the RWD LR? Presumably that should be getting mid 4's then?
Amazing! To have a car that gets so much faster after delivery via free OTA software update is unheard of!
[deleted]
LEMR gang coming up in the world
"This is awesome, I have a mid range  yeah!!!

Now just bring on a update for faster supercharge

https://m.imgur.com/6AekAIl"
"I’m glad to see my MR getting some mention. I was starting to feel like the bastard child showing up for thanksgiving dinner. We’re cool but people still feel a little awkward around us. I’m curious how many were built. 10,000 ish?"
Any word on the LR-RWD? There are literally dozens of us!
Media:  Tesla numbers down by 12.5%
Has anyone seen any numbers on performance improvements for the SR+?
"I am a Tesla noob. What is a mid-range model 3? I see only Standard Plus, Long, and Performance."
As an MR owner I'm really happy. I finally got to take my car for a drive on the highway this morning since the update and man it feels fast. I was over 90% but even  at around 80% I could feel it was faster. It just feels more responsive too.
I hope this update is eventually pushed to all models. (SR+ owner here)
I would love to seem them bring this back
"There is a mid range? Every time I've been to the custom order page, I've only seen SR+, Long Range, and Performance."
Engineering + data collection from the field + software updates = basically indistinguishable from magic.
Anyone know what the 0-60 time is now on LR RWD?
"> at launch

I see what you did there"
Does anyone know what the 0-60 time of the LR AWD is now?
How does the time go down after launch
Any chance of the 75d having some performance kick?
So why the hell won’t they uncork my Model S 60D unless I lay for the 75 upgrade?!
I'm going to put a spoiler on mine now that it's under 5 seconds. 😎
I want .7 off on my M3P+ !!!!!
Do these speed increases really matter?  I'm curious -- I don't even own a Tesla.  But it seems like 0-60 in anything under six seconds is really much faster than I would ever need to go.  Do you folks notice the difference?
Car is fucking fast.  3.37 0-60 with my dragy. P3D. Fastest car I’ve ever been in by far.
Midrange owner here. Does anyone know how quarter mile times have improved?
Genuinely so cool that they can make your car faster overnight
Can someone explain what exactly they're changing in software to allow these performance increases?  Is it improvements to some kind of control system algorithm?  Is it leveraging data from the cars to optimize parameters?  I guess I'm just trying to understand why they're able to do this now as opposed to previously.
This is awesome news! I was very skeptical to avoid feeling the placebo effect of an update that increased power and acceleration. In reality I assumed it would be imperceptible but that has not been the case. I am very pleasantly surprised that I can feel the acceleration difference in my MR but is actually showing a difference on times as well
"Earnings call. Shares prices are very shaky at the moment. You release the earnings, then immediately the software update, the internet is positively buzzing about the awesome feature, which most likely had been planned before to make you perceive the company as very generous to the customers, and bam. Tesla is God."
I think I’ll just wait a couple years to get my Tesla. They just get better & better as time passes lol
It's amazing how conservative Elon is with performance. Who knows what the Next-Gen Roadster's 0-60 is by the time it launches?!
"I did 4.9 about 6 months ago after the first power increase.

https://i.imgur.com/lhDWDkB.jpg"
Since owning my mid-range we’ve gotten two of these “more power” updates. Makes me wonder if it could’ve been a “more range” update but they’re choosing to make them quicker rather than more efficient...
for some reason the update failed on my LR RWD and i'm sooooo bummed I don't get to try this out yet 😭
How were they able to achieve this with a software update?
Whats the new time for SR+?
I have a major hunch that they could have released this much sooner but didn't want to canabalize Model S sales but that happened anyway so they said fuck it.
Anyone know the new 0-60 for the long range model? (Not AWD or Dual Motor) Was 4.9 seconds when I bought it.
"Is the ""mid-range"" the standard range plus?"
Ehh not believing this. That means the mid-range is as fast as a LR RWD? Not sure how that makes sense. itesla just tested his LR RWD and got 4.9 seconds with the update so MR probably 5.5 5.4ish max.
"0-60 times is irrelevant these days, anything sub 6 secs is already fast enough.  Let's concentrate on efficiency please.  I would like to get longer range at good cruising speed on AWD.  I would like Tesla implement some type of AWD modes that we can choose more power to the front or rear.  I'm pretty sure it can be done easily via software."
If the MR time went down that should mean the LR RWD M3 time went down as well. Does anyone have any info on that?
"I believe it. I'm a non-savvy driver, but I can feel the difference in acceleration in my M3 since the latest software update. Whee!"
"Unpopular opinion, I don't like it. I paid extra for a reason, not to have the cheaper version creep up on my times.

Oh well, congrats for the MR peeps."
Waste of energy.

264 miles on one charge and a really long charge time seems pretty bad though. I couldn't even drive to college without stopping for atleast a half charge partway there

Kind of expected this to show up right away. Not sure what the hold up is.

"We always come full circle, that's how circle jerks work"
Hey it's a comment in a post about a post about an article about a post!
"Yeah, I thought my RWD LR was 4.9 before whatever updates."
4.9 0-60 and 4.6 with rollout for Lr RWD
Ditto. Car felt very fast to me the past few days after the OTA update.
"I envy the awd LR..since its much cheaper to be had than my LR RWD from last year. Wish I can trade it in but it would be nonsensical to do high mileage, I'd probably get way less for it.

Random fact getting michelin ps4 summer tires increases wh/mi usage by 20 on 18"". Compared to the stock tires."
"Yeah, I love this. There’s a guy I work with who always asks about my car when he sees me. This week I told him  “Yeah, my car got faster last week”.   He asked how that was possible and how much it cost. Really blew his mind when I told him it was a free software update."
I’ve shaved a half second or so off a few BMWs with an ECU flash. Isn’t that the same thing?
tHiS iSnT tHe sPeEd I pAiD fOr I wAnT mY mOnEy bAcK!
GTI does this but with aftermarket software
"Ever heard of a tune? VAG cars are especially easy to get more power out of with just software, but they're not the only ones. Works for BMWs, Subarus, Fords, etc..

Really the only differences are Tesla's is OTA, and free."
">free OTA software update is unheard of!

It was very heard-of... Model S (85? other?) got software update which did similar (close to 1sec diff, if I recall correctly), around time of Model 3 intro. Most likely to not have Model 3 being faster than their luxury model."
The sadness of thinking any other car company would rather withhold such improvements in order to sell you a new car...
AND it's free. I could see so many other manufacturers monetizing this heavily. Imagine if each and every update costs $$. We're lucky as fuck
"Yeah, I don’t know what makes it special though. All cars can have their ECUs parameters flashed to make it faster. Being an EV, there is no worry of EPA testing and regulations. Also, most ECUs come conservative from the factory and get more aggressive and faster the more you drive."
Yep. I honestly have no idea why people who have houses (so they can easily charge) are buying new Mercedes or BMW car or anything else in the same price range and size as a Model 3.
Yes it’s the same. 4.9 and 4.6 with rollout
Yes what is new performance 0-60 also?
"Goldilocks crew in the house, haha"
Heck yeah LEMR gang. Love mine.
"Truly 10,000 of a kind."
Feel the LEMR
What is. LEMER? What’s it stand for?
Super clean
Looks really good!
What finish did you put on your wheels? Glossy powdercoat?  I dig it.
I’m pretty sure we already have faster super charge. Mine worked at the V3 in Vegas. Had the 1000 miles/hour
"It's a little odd but I did 4.9 about 6 months ago from the first power increase.

Did you tiny the windows yourself? (Sorry Tesla nub who doesn't know of the windows come tinted like that)
"Hello, Batman."
"My mid range is my baby. 
https://i.imgur.com/K4pqwud.jpg"
I would also be very curious to know how many they built.
"I assume it was the most common Model 3 in the past, but the AWD LR might have it beaten by now. Who knows."
Same times as MR.
Probably tens of thousands since it was the least expensive model 3 for the first year.
Someone on Facebook has claimed a 4.9 time on the SR+
"Seems quicker, but could be all mental. Looking forward to a post like this about it soon"
"I have one that's updated, and a good place to test it.  Is there a way to measure that's safe and accurate for one person?"
Discontinued model in 2018. A bit more range than a Standard Plus and has Premium interior. One motor.
It did. I got it a couple of days ago.
"Did you try the method where you hold the ""advanced"" button or tap it a bunch of times to get it to manually check for updates?"
I got mine couple days ago
Bring what back?
"They discontinued in 2018. During this time there was only LR, LR AWD, and Performance. MR was marketed as the lower cost option (similar to what the SR+ is now)."
"It’s the same as the MR which Is kind of annoying. We have the biggest battery, so we should be able to push more power out :("
see here [https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dv7r5i/model_3_awd_tested_from_0160_kmh_peak_power_up_75/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dv7r5i/model_3_awd_tested_from_0160_kmh_peak_power_up_75/)
They mean the initial sales launch of the car. When it was first sold.
"They update the software. Either it is improving the traction control to get you traction faster, improving cooling to keep the motor cooler, or just unlocking more power that was basically already there."
Firmware upgrades!
"No joke. It’s scares the he’ll out of me as is. I would much prefer more range over improved 0-60. Regardless, I’ll take any OTA improvements and consider them icing on the cake."
"I am not a car person at all and I absolutely do. I have a Model S 70 (0-60 5.5). I had a loaner 85D for a few days (0-60 4.?). I noticed the difference, and after I got my 70 back I thought my 70 was broken it felt so slow off the line. I had to time it to convince myself the car was fine.

Now I have driven a P3D (0-60 3.2) and that is a whole different beast. I'm not entirely sure man was meant to go that fast, but I will be doing it often once I get my P3D-"
It's more that they're lessening the restrictions they put on the motors via software updates.
It'll be beyond ludicrous.
"Careful what you wish for. Mine installed fine, but now my backup camera is totally non functional. Black screen only whenever I use it, and restarting has not helped. :("
"With an EV you can always reprogram to tell it to pull more power out of the battery and push more to the motor, If you go too far stuff burns out. With these updates Tesla feels comfortable pushing the existing hardware harder."
"no.  The midrange was made for a short time (a few months) before standard or standard range+ were available.    It has a substantially bigger batter than the standard range +

 See here. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\_Model\_3#Specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3#Specifications)"
They are no longer software limiting MR. Now LR RWD and MR have same 0-60. LR only has range performance advantage.
It’s the same as mr time
Salty.
What a loser.
anything. You get an upgrade without doing *anything*.  )Sorry. That triggered me. )
I think the people who can afford and have purchased the mid-range care.
"The battery alone costs Tesla ~20,000 to make."
"A) I don't believe you for a second.

B) If by some miracle you aren't lying, your battery pack is broken, get it replaced under warranty."
Lol what complete crap.
"whoooooaa! I sure did!!! Thank you! 

that post was 4 days ago, and i had just got my 3 on Sunday, so I spent all my free time at home and at work this week, in and around my car, instead of on the internet as per usual!"
"SR gets .7 seconds better and AWD only gets .1 better. Where is my refund?!?!?!?


Sarcasm"
I expected more improvement. It is still nice...
"I used to be in this camp as well.  But my AWD has gotten 13.5% more power since I bought it and feels like an absolute screamer.  I just don’t need this car to get any faster.  

But of course I will buy a performance unlock if it ever some around."
"I'm new to this sub (I'm looking into getting a Model 3), sorry if this seems like a dumb question to you. What's a P3D-?

I'm trying to figure out some of the acronyms that I see. Like SR+? I've gathered that these are variations of the car, but don't know specifics."
"This is nuts , 0.7 Sec improvement in 0-60 just with a software update."
"I see unlock, I upvote!"
Would be cool if they did a bundle pack FSD and P for $10k.
It won't happen because it can't happen. The difference between the performance and the other versions is thicker gauge wire in the car to carry the current from the batteries to the motor. Without upgrading the wire I seriously doubt you'll get the same level of performance.
I bought the key fob instead of a dragy!
These numbers are pre update right?
So the mid range is almost just as fast?
"1. longest ranged 3
2. I got around 10k in incentives (2500 state, 7500 federal, 500 PGE)
3. I live in CA so I don't need AWD
4. I got EAP which has everything I wanted from FSD (lane changes while on AP) without the extra money
5. I'm set for premium data, so won't have to pay the monthly/yearly fee whenever they decide to implement it
6. From the time I bought (may 2018) until the time AWD was available, I saved a ton on gas money, oil changes, etc

The only thing I'm a little envious of is the P3D Stealths that were heavily discounted awhile ago. AWD definitely wasnt worth it"
"Fair but we also have the longest range model 3 and it's not available anymore, so that's a plus"
I always have to remind myself of the now-unavailable $10K we got in tax incentives.
"I recently switched to Michelin CrossClimate+ on my LR RWD, since my stock MXM4s wore out stupid fast. So far, despite them not being ""low rolling resistance"" like the MXM4s, I'm getting as good as or better Wh/mi."
"I phrased it as ""I downloaded more power last night."" Colleague thought it was akin to the ""download more RAM"" joke, and I had to assure him it was not!"
"Yup, basically the same thing. What is different is that the factory is collecting reliability information and tweaking the motor controllers and then updating the code for the existing fleet over the air. Most manufacturers don’t bother with such updates to the existing fleet, much less deploy them over the air.

They will usually just wait for whenever marketing says it should go into the next available new model year."
"I'd say it's similar in concept, but not execution. The Tesla OTA's are identical to manually updating an app on your phone: **Update Available** *Install Now* **Installing..** **Update Complete** An ECU flash typically requires you to purchase a kit, have some additional tools on hand (battery charger, laptop), and technically have a lot more steps involved."
Yeah but you have to remember a lot of Tesla people aren't necessarily car enthusiasts so they don't really know anything about modding other than loud exhausts
Must have been a turbo car that increased the boost.
"The primary difference is that one is backed by the manufacturer warranty, the other is not.  Typically, for ICEs the ECU is set to be conservative so runs more rich.  Aftermarket ECUs leverage this by having the engine run more lean (or in the case of a turbo have it run at a higher psi).  The risk is longevity of the engine that wasn't designed to run or tested that way by the manufacturer."
"Those also aren't normally free, and void factory warranties (normally). I don't know if BMW has some sort of ""special"" treatment to customers or whatever."
The OP did mention over the air. ECU flashes require OBD on most cars and are delivered OTA. So technically not the same thing.
Tomorrow's headline on Electrek.
"You are right, I meant to refer to the fact that it was free and OTA"
"This isn’t a car people sub, it’s a technology enthusiasts that know nothing about cars sub."

What is rollout?
"Where is the recent test on that. I see the comment posted, but want to see the article and test data."
"What do you mean it's the same? Cant be same as MR, unless you mean same relative improvement?"
Is this just a MR model 3 cause I have one of these!
I feel it
"Thanks, thinking about lowering it alittle and adding some spacers to the tires"
Satin black to match the chrome delete
"wat, you got 250kW with a mid range?"
Cool thanks
"No, 19in sport wheels done in satin black"
"I had the tint done at a trust worthy tint shop that knows how to handle model 3.  I had the back window done in one piece.

I went back about about a month later and the same shop did my chrome delete.

No question is too dumb, ask anything you like.  That is what all these posts are about.  To help each other out."
Let's hope so! I just updated mine 1hr ago but have nowhere to drag race it (not that I would dare!)
Who
I've also spotted we can stream netflix over LTE now in the UK for free. Doesn't seem to work for YouTube for me though. Not sure how long this will last though as it's not supposed to be for the SR+. It's not a big either as it was mentioned in the patch notes.
"Other than buying an accurate GPS device for measuring 0-60, 1/4 mile times etc, you could try an app on your phone and hope it's accurate."
Should it be the same power as sr+ due to the same motor?
Thank you kind sir.
Does not work.  I tried many times over days.  Then one afternoon I got in the car to go home and it was there.
"SR+ owner. Just went to the screen showing if you are up to date or not and it started downloading. I'm on Advanced if it makes a difference. 

Anxiously waiting for the 170kw update."
I can't yet because we took it in for some minor repairs due to some road debris on the highway.  I will try it when we get it back (hopefully next week).
Mid range model 3
LR is heavier though.
Thanks
Interesting.  Do you know why there were restrictions in the first place?  Did they need more testing before allowing these higher accelerations?
could be worse. whatever update failed seems to have caused an error that own't let my car charge now.
"Oh, interesting. Thanks for the info"
I wonder if this is related to data from the Semi. Since it uses model 3 motor and may have more power pushed to it.
Interesting. Thanks!
Does that mean they lock sr+ performance thru software?
"I know. It was a little joke, apparently people downvote jokes here."
"Why do you choose not to believe ? Is it because you were with me in this drive and you observed a different performance ? 

 Thanks for your comment on the warranty. I will give it a look"
If he wasn’t going up hill or driving 90+ the whole time he’s full of shit. If his pack had an issue his rates range number would also be affected.
Search goes back further than 3 days.
"Midrange does, not SR+"
The AWD is likely pushing the limits of power to the motors whereas the MR and SR/+ are likely software limited. There’s a lot of potential in those that are artificiality limited.

Lol I don’t need it but I’ll buy it describes most people I guess. Who needs that insane acceleration daily driving? Nobody haha. But I’d sure as hell take it if it’s available. Such easy money for Tesla if they release it. It’s be a nice surprise if it popped up at the end of the quarter for Christmas though
After 30mph the power of awd and performance is quite similar.
"I love that caveat at the bottom ""but of course I will buy a performance unlock"" hahah"

Is this software update available for my 2005 Chrysler Sebring?
I would do that.
">The difference between the performance and the other versions is thicker gauge wire in the car to carry the current from the batteries to the motor

I've not heard this before. How do you know this is true?"
"Nah, it was the same hardware until sometime in 2019 when the LR AWD started getting a 990 series rear motor instead of the original 980. There are also a lot of revisions of the 980, they’re up to revision F now.

The real reason they don’t offer an unlock is probably that it would probably cause total chaos for insuring the cars and that it’d be very confusing for owners of the newer LR AWD vehicles why they can’t get an unlock. Tesla would have to only allow older LR AWD vehicles the unlock and they’d probably want to limit it to the more reliable revisions, etc. It’d just be too confusing to offer this.

Pretty much all 2018 LR AWDs could theoretically be uncorked via software to a P3D-"
No that’s post update.
Seems like all the RWD model variations have nearly identical times.
Plus you can brag about your super low VIN...right?
$7500. Federal incentive was never $10k.
You wouldn't download a car...
"To be fair, this is *very* similar to e.g. a microcode update that somehow lets your computer compress a byte of data into 7.5 bits without a performance decrease.

(Yes, I realize that's not a thing that makes any sense.)"
"Yup. Tesla is differently much better at sharing, I’ll give them that no contest."
"My ECU flashes were done at the dealer. I dropped it off and picked it up. That’s it. 

Certainly not as nice as an OTA, but I didn’t have to do anything challenging."
">you have to remember a lot of Tesla people aren't necessarily car enthusiasts

I'd argue the opposite: a lot of Tesla people ARE car enthusiasts.

From my experience my much enthusiasts than your average legacy brand-loyal car owner."
Even many car enthusiasts don't understand how computerized cars have become. My Uncle didn't believe me when I told him pressing a button on my phone would suddenly give my car an extra 50 horsepower. He was even more confused when I told him that my tuner was 1000 miles away and did everything via email.
"The risk isn’t longevity. Most ICE engines can run well beyond the factory limits. The setback is emissions. If you run too lean, you release more NOx. Run too rich, run dirtier. And then there are trims that you pay for that can use the same engine but have different outputs."
"BMW themselves offer ECU flashes. They call them PPK.

And side note - you cannot “void a warranty” (in the US). That’s an old wives tale. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act protects against that. You can only have a specific claim denied if they can show that the aftermarket work that was done actually caused the failure; the warranty itself remains en force. And again, I’m not even talking about aftermarket flashes here anyhow."
“Tesla customers are demanding money back after software update causes issues with acceleration”
"I know, I know... I've given up correcting ""M3,"" but I'll be damned if I stop trying to correct the ""Tesla is the only one to..."" or ""Tesla is the first to..."" misconceptions that constantly fly around here!"
"There’s a big difference between an aftermarket hack that voids your warranty and potentially impacts the life of your vehicle

And a manufacturer developed and supported upgrade... that’s free"
"Thank you for posting SR+ times, it's like the SR+ is the redheaded step child of Tesla lol, I swear I read about the LR rwd than the SR+"
[deleted]
"These cars area already tuned to their peak efficiencies to EPA regulations from the factory. There is no need for them to add power. A Revo Stage 1 A4 flash alone puts it at 340hp with a 0-60 of 4.5s and low 13s to high 12s quarter mile. Why do I have to be at the hands of the manufacturer to make more power? Tuners don't like that.

> Why do you have to be so argumentative? 

I'm not argumentative. Being into cars for over 15 years and working as an engineer for 7 years and seeing a lot of technology, I find it funny that every minor thing Tesla does is seen as revolutionary when it is very basic."
It starts the timer after you’ve driven a foot. Shaves off the time it takes to break inertia from zero.
"It’s how most 0-60 times are measured by every other car. It’s a more universal way of comparing. 

Don’t quote me on this but it originates from drag racing and where the sensors begin to record movement. (Starting the timer after the car has moved one foot)"

It worked in my model s loaner last Wednesday. Within 2 mins of trying this the little “download update” arrow appeared in the top right.
I was hoping to get the 170kw update before my trip in two weeks.  😔

How much heavier? I never thought of that
"My bad dude, I didn't even realise you were kidding. I didn't downvote you, though, that shit's lame."
SR = Standard Range.. I guess I meant SR+
Doubt that.  Widely held belief awd and p3d are physically identical.
"I think they will keep the limit on awd, otherwise many people won’t buy p3d."
Lol yeah. I was at 50% SOC and a buddy of mine asked me to stop accelerating and was getting sick. It was awesome
"> I have to say ""this isn't even its final form"".

I always say ""and this is only a medium hot Model 3""."
Really? After 30mph? I have a hard time believing that...
"Dragy says otherwise.

P3D pulls almost 0.9 G fairly consistently until around 45 mph and tails off 0.7 Gs at 60mph.

AWD only pulls ~0.65 Gs dipping off to 0.5Gs at 60mph.

P3D: https://i.imgur.com/N06154e.jpg

AWD: https://i.imgur.com/67PVxQ8.jpg"
"Thanks for the explanation!

I wasn't aware that it's possible to buy the P3D (see, I'm learning) without the bigger wheels. I was actually looking for the option on the site."
I would jump on that over FSD in a heartbeat
"The P3D- is quicker. Car is lighter (smaller rims and less brake calipers), tires less sticky so less friction (aero 18s still don’t spin under the super heavy car), smaller diameter tires deliver more power, less spoiler makes the car lighter at higher speeds. I think it’s better lol

Edit: why are people downvoting - the stealth is objectively quicker than the P3D which is built for track performance, and as such has to make certain compromises that impact its acceleration. There’s a reason the P+ is 20-30% less efficient than the AWD."
Software locks are fucking garbage and shouldn't be legal
Yes. You can flash the ecu after strapping on a new turbo.
"There are actually [performance chips for Sebrings.](https://www.carid.com/chrysler-sebring-performance-chips/)  Not quite downloaded while you sleep, but..."
"Sure is, just take it onto your nearest Dodge/Jeep/Chrysler dealer and I’m sure they’ll find a way to take some of your money!"
"About insurance, maybe they can offer it to people buying Tesla Insurance.
Also, maybe it could be selectively offered to panders of the right cars as a referral reward (e.g. for the fifth referral)."
"Most of the limitations according to CAN data is on the front motor. Front is limited 60kw and rear 20kw, and front motor is the same for AWD as P3D. And during acceleration up to 60mph the motors don't draw full current because of wheel spin, so I guess they could increase acceleration to P3D levels but not the top speed since the rear motors haven't been binned."
"So you’re saying there’s a chance, then. Great! :)"
"I was getting about 4.9 before the update via a 60fps camera pointed at the display (no roll out). Not the most accurate I know but I just did a 4.72 run on the new update with the roughly the same state of charge 92% today vs 90% before on the same stretch of road. I only did one run and I think I'm going slightly uphill.

Where did you get your figures?"
I suppose. I am 28xxx.
0003xx here
Combined with my state's tax incentive it came out to about $10K total when we got the car. We got it 2 weeks before it expired!
"A microcode update could theoretically increase performance. Not by compressing data though. This usually doesn't happen, because a lot of development work went over the years to tune it, so any gains are marginal at best. And manufacturers are overly conservative, so updates lately have been decreasing performance (speculative execution vulnerability fixes). 

However, if tomorrow a new CPU architecture was release, I bet we would see microcode update improving things. That would nicely parallel what Tesla is doing (it's a new ""architecture"" after all)."
Did you have to pay?
"When you get notified of an update and complete it from the comfort of your bed, having to take it to the dealer is way too much work."
Isn't there a risk of voiding the warranty on some cars?
Your average brand loyal car owner isn't really an enthusiast either. I guess a better way to put it would be that Tesla owners are very very new enthusiasts that might not know much about modding culture or car culture. Cars have been software driven for a long time now and you can very easily get more power with a reflashed ECU. I can take my A6 from 300HP to 444HP with a reflash. It's pretty common
"> That’s an old wives tale. 

Sorta.  

>The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act protects against that. You can only have a specific claim denied if they can show that the aftermarket work that was done actually caused the failure; the warranty itself remains en force.

In theory.  In reality, if the OEM wants to deny the coverage, you resolution is to take them to court to enforce the act.   At which point they will (and have - subaru used to do this all the time) bring up in court that the ECU impacts effectively every part of the car except the suspension, and thus a power increase above stock puts additional stress.   They win with this argument all the time, and then you are out your warranty and the money for the lawyer.

So yes, the Act 'protects' you, but only if you are willing to gamble your lawyer against theirs."
"That's cool that BMW themselves offer a factory flash. I have been out of the loop for a while which is why I worded my reply in a ""they could do it, but I haven't seen it"". Thanks for the new found knowledge!"
"""I always leave the house with my shoes untied, to save time. When I get in my car, I flatten the accelerator while bending down to tie my shoe, and it takes just the right amount of time that when I finish I can let off and avoid the house at the end of the road. But with the new acceleration, I get to the house much quicker, and on my commute this AM my car violently entered their living room as I was still in the process of pulling the second loop through. [This update broke my workflow, and I demand an option to re-enable slower acceleration.](https://xkcd.com/1172/)"""
Acceleration now differs from when they initially purchased the car.
Haha.  Same for me.  Or that somehow these cars defy braking and suspension physics.  What really irks me is that people simply don’t get their own 0-60 times and 1/4 mile times but want to talk about it incessantly.
"I’m talking about the context of the sub, not just this post duder."
Of course it is invalid.    No other companies do it.    Tesla does.   I have owned lots of cars over the years and not one has gotten new features or got faster after I bought it.   Who cares if they can do something if they never do it.

"> every minor thing Tesla does is seen as revolutionary when it is very basic

They’re pushing the envelope with computer vision and AI in the automotive industry.

They’re the first to model car updates just like phone and laptop OS updates - the pace of extensive updates and the high quality control is astounding.

They’re the first to market with a mass market BEV sports car - a driver’s car, chock full of software, battery, motor, and design (minimizing wiring harnesses and parts in manufacturing) innovation.

Most car manufacturers were rehashing the same tried and true strategies, like churning out another iteration of basically the same as last year’s CUV, before Tesla shook up the entire automotive industry."
"Oh, that's why every was saying 1 foot.  It made no sense that telsa would have such terrible resolution encoders that reading two counts indicated a foot of travel.  A foot is like a 5th of a wheel revolution, which would mean like 10 encoder counts per rev, which seemed stupidly low compared to 500 or 1000 I expect on electric motors.  Hell, I'm not even sure the electric motor could be properly commutated with such low resolution.

It makes more sense if that is a historical ICE engine phrase, ""1 foot rollout"", because you can trigger a timer after the car crosses a line."
"Right. As you roll into the line and the tire hits the sensor, it takes a foot of travel for the sensor to realize the car has left because it’s not perfectly flush with the ground and tires squish. To avoid rollout you would have to roll in, trigger sensor, keep going until it untriggers, then back into it slowly so you can have an inch of rollout instead of a foot. A foot is fine if everyone does it the same way."
"It's more like ""It's how everyone in the US"" measures 0-60 times. 0-100*km*/h is traditionally measured without a rollout."
No it's just an American thing. The real way every non-american manufacturer does it is 0-100 km/h from standstill
"Hmm well can't help but feel a bit frustrated by that. Car was advertised as the faster model, but now the model below it, for cheaper was retroactively made on par."
I wonder what his state of charge was on the run after the update. Because his first run before the update only showed 80% battery. Pretty sure you need something like 90% or above to get the fastest 0-60.
"Hmm, would have hoped for being faster than MR. Oh well. Still half second faster than at launch, pun intended!"
I am probably going to bite the bullet and do it sometime early next year
It was a swap deal with a well known Tesla shop in Tampa.   I had 18in aero caps/tires/wheels with 2k miles on it so I swapped for 19in with 300 miles on them and had them done in satin black at same time.  Out of pocket $800 when the deal was done.  Best decision I made.
"You funny :-)

That's alright lol I hope it's true!
Do you have to have Spotify premium or will the free one work with ads?
Coincidence
I gotta imagine they'll try to roll out 2019.40.1 to SR+ owners before the busy Thanksgiving travel starts. Will help a bit with Supercharger congestion as well.
"My guess is no, especially since the standard range plus is so close in range. But I would imagine with the recent software updates it will go up to about ~275 miles"
I bet not. It was not the most efficient/practical model to build as it used a LR battery pack design that was simply not filled up all the way like with the LR variants. The SR/+ have a totally different pack design that’s lighter and uses less cells to achieve the same result.
It can’t. I tried literally the day after they pulled it from the website around 6 months ago. I’m still a little sad. (I do love my SR+ though)
About 170 lbs according to wikipedia.
"Battery capacity to battery weight, ignoring the supporting stuff like coolant, is probably a linear relationship."
SR+ is still different than MR.
I can confirm this. I bought a p3d- and all they did was take an AWD model and send over the air update on delivery day to give it the performance software including track mode option. I watched it with my own eyes because they forgot to do it when they initially tried to deliver car to me but luckily I checked the home screen and saw no red underline and complained it wasn't a performance version. It took them 30 minutes in the dealership to send it over with an update then the red underline showed up on the car's home page and I had a p3d-. So effectively I'm driving a normal AWD with the performance software.
"Actually there are differences between AWD and P3D-. Atleast based on time.

Scroll down a bit to Post #308) where you see the 980 vs 990 motor summary for before and after March 2019:

https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/model-3-motors-on-the-tesla-parts-catalog.133495/page-16

There seems to be variations of motor model numbers assigned. Here’s the summary:

-	Performance Model (both P3D- and P3D+) rear motor ends with 980
-	RWD uses same 980 motors as Performance Models
-	AWD after March 2019 uses 990 motors.
-	AWD before March 2019 had a mix of 980 and 990 motors.

Basically at one point, AWD had a mix of performance and non Performance motors. As of March 2019, AWD only has non Performance 990 motors.

My P3D- has 980 motors just like P3D+.

My suspicion is that all AWD with 980 motors get stealth upgrade.

This is also probably why the RWD cars can keep improving with larger margins because their rear motor is a 980 Performance one."
"Even if they are physically identical it might be a difference in warranty claims. 

""We sell you this for an extra $1,000 because it's $1,000 worth more likely to fail and need to be replaced under warranty.""

There was an article recently that Tesla was seeing fewer warranty claims than they set aside money for.  This could be an effort to convert some of their warranty cash into marketing points.   ""Cars aren't breaking down as fast as we expected... speed'em up a bit."""
I’d pay to upgrade my AWD to P
Just like the same CPU model is physically identical...
"I keep seeing that the motors are the same, but the P3 has ""binned"" motors (successful tests for higher tolerances) and a more powerful inverter to push the extra juice necessary for that increased acceleration."
"True. I bet it’s:

MR/SR/+ - software limited

LR RWD - likely not software limited
________

AWD LR - software limited

Performance - likely not software limited"
"I picked up a sleeper on Sunday.  I don't do roller coasters because I get motion sickness.  The first time i floored it from a stop, I was sick to my stomach for 3 hours....

Totally worth it though :)"
So many more times did u launch till he threw up.
"I had an AWD and now a P3D+ and acceleration is quite similar after 30 mph. There is a video on youtube showing comparison between them both 0-60 and rolling from 40 mph. 

If upgraded to Performance because it was only 3000 $ difference in price but if difference was bigger LR AWD is best bang for the money."
The LR AWD doesn’t really pull until you hit 30.  It feels detuned below 30 can’t even chirp the tires from start which my AWD Porsche with an e-diff can do yet 0 to 60 the Tesla wins.    Porsche tires are significantly larger as well.   PSD- can chirp tires all day long from start according to the forums.
You can't order one off the site. You will have to talk to an associate at a showroom and they will be able to check inventory to see if any P3D- cars are available. They make them in small batches it seems.
"As someone who has a P3D- & FSD, i couldn’t agree more."
"Cool, though I can’t imagine the smaller brake calipers are better in any way. Weight difference has to be tiny."
20-30% huh? Got anything to back any of this up? Really fascinating stuff you are stating.

My main point is that this wouldn’t be something if they knew the reliability limit from the factory if that is what they are measuring. Or maybe they give these updates to keep the car fresh. I don’t know.  Other manufacturers would release the cars with peak power and efficiencies designed to their safety factors. This is why I don’t find this amazing or unique. I just see it as something Tesla can do. The tech isn’t far fetched.

"Thank you for this. I've been a bit bummed since getting my AWD back when it cost what the P3 currently costs. I'm totally happy with my purchase, but I couldn't help but wonder what the P3 would feel like if I'd waited. Nice to have a comparison."
Turn on slip.
"That's good to know! Thanks for the info.

Roughly how much cheaper do they end up being?"
"It adds up, Brembo brake calipers are about 10 lbs each and standard calipers are around 5. They also require bigger discs. For highway braking the small calipers are fine, it's for intense braking where the caliper gets so hot that the brake fluid boils and that makes the brakes very squishy and ineffective, the stopping distance isn't needed in highways really."

>GM has been doing this long before Tesla

That's just updating the OnStar software.  Not nearly as extensive as Tesla updates which can change arbitrary parts of the car's firmware.

You need a dictionary?  I qualified with mass market.

>the same thing with minor upgrades

Several major software updates:

That's not even considering the hardware revisions, e.g. motor revisions, MCU updates, redesigned interior seats, etc.  They're innovating much faster than traditional cars with model years."
Well removing all software limits the LR has more available battery power to apply so that's where the thought came from.
"It makes sense, they released the scheduled departure update as winter hit."
MR has a larger pack than the SR+. They aren't the same thing.
"No, MR was the first trim with a smaller battery, but still larger than the later SR and SR+. Hence Mid Range.

It briefly replaced the original LR RWD in the lineup, and then was replaced by the SR and SR+."
I think the range is different.
"Don't they have different shocks/etc?

I'm not sure I'd want a software limited performance car. It isn't going to handle potholes and such as well as a normal AWD..."
"I'll hold out hope for a pure software unlock, then. Mine was fall 2018 AWD."

They're usually $5k cheaper than a P3D+. Mine was $49990 plus destination.

The top level commenter edited his original comment to include ""OTA."" Before that, his comment was about simply using software to get more power out of a car. So that was *exactly* the argument I (and everyone else in this chain, pre-edit) was responding to."
"> Where did anyone say the tech was impossible for other manufacturers to implement? 

There are a lot on implications around here that when Tesla does something and other manufacturer's haven't, it is because they were incapable or didn't have the engineering prowess to do it.

> Tesla was cautious with their new batteries. They are slowly uncorking them as the data allows. 

Releasing a product unsure of it's performance just shows a lack of initial testing. My main point is with ICE vehicles, there is no need for that because they have all their safety factors incorporated in their design from the offset tied in with . If EPA changed their rules and didn't impose expensive testing, manufacturers can easily  update power limits.

> The problem for ICE vehicles is that the Model 3 that competed with the ICE manufacturers model and trim levels is now much faster than it started. This is the case with the A4 and 3 Series which compete with the SR+. The Tesla started out with comparable straight line performance to it competitors now soundly blows the doors off them. 

What's your point with this? Those that care about straight line performance can easily get a Revo tune and blow the SR+ out the water and even go further. It's not that difficult from a consumer standpoint to do."
"I never said they promised it. The praise of ""amazing free updates"" that that anyone else would provide at release is kind of silly."
"The LR may have more available power, but the motor might not be able to take that power."
Ah I thought it was the other way around. I'm an idiot everyone please disregard.
I can't find anything that differentiates the two but w/e
"Well... not anymore! SR+ is 250, MR was 260. Did they upgrade MR range, or not?"
That's a pretty big oof from someone who paid the same for and AWD
That's a huge difference! It makes it much more attractive to go P3D- and get the FSD.
I picked one up on Sunday and confirm mine was $2k more than the LR AWD I had on order.
">But same can be said even if no mods are done....

Its a little different.  With no mods done, the Act is pretty much irrelevant and theres no discussion of an external cause.  Yes, you still might go to court to have the warranty enforced, but it's not going to be due to the modification clauses in the Act."

The LR is definitely software limited. Even the performance has an engineered power curve.
The range is listed in the picture of the article we’re all talking about.
"When I bought, LR AWD was $47990 so it was a $2k jump to P3D-"
I said as much in my original comment....
"> The point was made that Tesla's OTA updates that push more power are novel. This is currently a fact and not arguable. You are setting up argument that don't exist to prove a point that wasn't even in the scope of the discussion. 

And I keep saying the only reason they are pushing more power is because they released are car they didn't understand and needed to rush it to market. Porsche with the Taycan were out testing for years before release, hence why they reached their design goals and was able to beat up on a Model S. What this tells me is that Tesla released a car that they weren't confident in quality wise. What it also shows is that they didn't go through all the proper limit testing before release. I don't think these update are novel.

> Tesla brought out a new battery type and made the cautious decision to lower the baseline power to ensure that the new thermal system was adequate. God forbid a manufacturer think about product reliability before performance. Your bias is showing. That was a pretty terrible argument. 

Why do the testing with a released product? That's bad engineering ethics. What if Boeing released the 787 Dreamliner to airlines without knowing the full extent of their designs? These updates are not novel.

> So now we are bringing back arguments from the early tuner days? It was never logical to compare stock factory vehicles and then argue that adding a 3rd party tune, that will affect your factory warranty, is the same. The facts are that even the slowest Tesla will blow the doors off anything in its class. Stock vs. stock it will absolutely gap an A4 or 3 Series. It will beat a stock STI and give an RS a run for its money in the 1/4 mile at the same price point. This is impressive for a EV. 

And like I've said before, you are reliant on manufacturing updates to make power. I'd rather have the freedom to do what I want. Plus JB4 and Revo tunes are minimally invasive and are well within the factor of safety for those car's engines. People will find a way to go fast when they want to. You shouldn't be uptalking the SR RWD chassis with coilovers to everyone then. It isn't OEM equipment. It's never logical to compare stock factory vehicles to aftermarket components right? The 3 RWD balance on coilovers is a moot point then. It's balance supposedly being better than a FRS is invalid."
It's not tripping me up. I just find the praise of it being unique short sighted. Most cars are released to their designed spec limits. I simply don't find it unique but rather something that Tesla is able to do. These power updates are only amazing to those not familiar to tuning.
Ah found my confusion... I thought the Tesla side had mid range now. But it is actually standard range plus. Where can you see MR online?
"...and from Tesla's perspective that was literally just $2k extra profit, because isn't it only a software difference between the P3D- and the LR AWD (might have bigger brakes, can't remember)? I'm thinking the reason they don't actually sell that often is because they think it steals too many sales from the actual P3D, which is still likely higher margin, even without some of those upgrades."
[deleted]
"Also, the MR was just a LR with a smaller battery pack so it has the exact same interior and sound system as the LR."
Tesla removed the midrange. The software update helped all 3 owners but the article is highlighting how the update helped all the people who bought the mid range model in the past.
They don't sell MR anymore. Here are the basic spec 50kwh vs 62kwh and 240 miles vs 264 miles.
"The only sold the MR because they wanted to sell the SR, but would lose too much money doing so because production wasn't high enough yet. So as soon as it actually got cheap enough for them to sell the SR, they cut the MR out of the lineup. Same as they did with the LR, but that's because they rather people buy the LR AWD which has even better margin."
"> The Model 3 was competitive with the cars in its class in the conservative state it launched in. Why wouldn't they release it in that state and then blow the doors off the competition down the road with additional uncorking? 

That's not the point. I don't understand what you are trying to convey here. We went over this already. It can be achieved in other vehicles.

> I can drive a modified car and still make a relevant argument about factory stock cars. I can also make comments and comparisons between modified cars. Show me where I compared the handling of my modified car to a factory stock car without first being quite clear that mine is modified and not indicative of a factory stock Model 3.  

You pointed out that I cannot compare a reflashed A4 to a Model 3 factory power update, therefore you cannot compare Model 3 on coilovers to the factory equipment, nor compare it to other stock cars as the FRS. I shouldn't buy or pay attention to a Model 3 SR+, MR, etc because the handling is bad from the factory. That's your train of logic."
Where are people getting the 50kwh number? Is there an official source?
"I think that was estimate that I put down, wikipedia has it at 54kwh (plus version) and 50kwh limited for standard. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3"

Congrats Grammy. I hope she gets many many days of enjoyment with it.
May God bless you and your family.
Drive it like you stole it Grammy
Yay!!! So happy for Grammy!
Enjoy the ride grammy!
This is so beautiful!
Do just a second I thought they were in a convertible Tesla.
Let’s treat then Charlotte Tesla team with something nice in return.
Beautiful family. Thank you for sharing your story.
That’s Akhil! He was my Tesla rep when I purchased my Model 3 from there. Great team for sure!
"May she have many weeks and months with her family, and (secondarily), the car. Amazing story."
Just remember to enjoy your time together and don’t worry about the rest 😊
Approved
This really belongs over on /r/MadeMeSmile as well.
"It might be just a car, but after seeing how happy a Tesla owner is with his car, I'm sure Model 3 will help your grandma, as people with cancer live better while being happy and not depressed."
What a beautiful story. Thank you for sharing.
Damn Grammy got a better car than me ;( Bless y’all!
Adorable
Awesome!  Totally forgot about this until now.  Glad she's able to enjoy the futuristic car that is the Model 3!
where is Grammy's Tesla jacket? sh..sh... on Thanksgiving Day!
"I read the original story and glad to see such a heartwarming follow-up, thanks OP.

I'm not crying, y'all are crying.  I'm just over here chopping onions at 4:30 in the morning in my office, at my desk."
"Awesome story. Best to your Grandma, stay positive."
Yay! Grammy got her Telsa early ❤
Is she really in condition to drive though?
She went white from the excitement!
A lot of Teslas in Charlotte.
that frunk in the back looks like mine (within spec)
"Absolutely amazing story, thank you so much for sharing. Much love to Grammy, I’m sure she will be grinning from ear to ear every day she gets to enjoy her Tesla."
"Grandma's got good taste, too! White on white is what I picked."
Thank you! I sure hope so too 😊❤️
Thank you so much ❤️
I would love that! Something somehow needs to be done because they were amazing through this!!
"Thank you :)

The two on the right are the Tesla Charlotte team members that personally delivered her car to her ❤️ I’m so grateful to them!"
It is!! He was so kind and helpful!! He and Tia were absolutely the best 💛
Same for me! Akhil was great.
Thank you do much 💛 I really really hope she does as well. She’s one of my favorite people in the whole world. ❤️
Great advice! Thank you 😊❤️
Why was it deleted in the first place out of curiosity?
"Absolutely!! I totally agree, and part of why I worked so hard to make this happen for her. 💛"
Thank you 😊💛
They gave her one!! A very special one!! I can't wait to see it!
Aww thank you 😊
Thank you so much 💛
"Not at this moment, so for now she's being driven in it. She starts radiation today and if in a few weeks she's in less pain and doing better, she will hopefully be in the position to be able to drive herself when she's got more energy. Her mind is totally sharp, but physically she's drained."
"Thank you so much 😊 

I’m sure she will too!! I can’t wait to see it! ❤️"
Love this combo!! 😁
Beautiful Grammy and Tesla staff.😊
Photo posts are automatically removed now.
Automod removed it because it was a photo.
"Thank you ❤️❤️ she’s quite an amazing person and truly spent her life making mine better so I am so glad to be able to help bring her something that gives and will give her so much joy 💛

And the staff from Tesla Charlotte... my goodness, I want to hug them for helping her. ❤️"
"Tesla is currently the most sold car make (including ICE cars) in Norway in 2019, just ahead of VW."
Norway is such a perfect country for the Model 3.
Honestly see no point in buying an ICE car in the 2020s.
"Model 3 was the first car I ever owned. I'd say its the car of my life, so far :D"
Two things America can learn from Norway: Prison systems and EV incentives.
Just waiting for that Roadster here in Australia
But it's not 2020???
There's a reason why happiness index is the highest in Norway.
"As a lurker in this subreddit, I keep wondering about a few things on this car: 

In terms of reliability, how does the car compare to...say... Toyota Corolla? 

How expensive is it to get it repaired? Like, dents, suspension, cracked glass, battery replacement? 

How far can someone go and do their own personal maintenance to the car until it requires them to take it to a specific Tesla mechanic?

Which brings me to the next question: can I take a Tesla to any mechanic or you're forced to take it a Tesla specific mechanic?

Even though the car is $39k, it still seems like it's only tailored for middle class people. People who make way above $50k a year."
"""Once on the roads of Norway, you will be surprised at how quiet it is.""

Not really. There is still 20 years of ICU cars here and the noise of studded winter tyres makes way more noise than engines.

What I really love about the Tesla's in addition to less co2 and air pollution is the horsepower. Norway has had a huge tax on cars with horsepower without regard of co2 output. That is obviously not the case with electric cars here."
"When I was in Norway last, it seemed like every third car was a Tesla. They love them over there. It's interesting because they're an oil producer too."
"Man, the Model Y will be the car of the year in 2021 pretty sure."

Welcome to Norway... the highly eco friendly country that makes a fortune exporting oil
This was so hard to believe people in Norway love American cars.
"Stupid titles need to stop. It's either the car of 2019, or you just are an idiot. Making a call that it's the car 2020 is just a pathetic attempt at being the first one to say something 2020...."
What happens if Tesla goes bust? A lot of these cars which would struggle to get support
wait till they start driving it and having problem after problem.
This actually makes me laugh at Norwegians
"It needs 2,300 more sales this year to become the most sold car in Norway ( in 1 year) Ever!"
So that's why there haven't been any deliveries in the US the last 2 months...
"VW includes Audi and Skoda, so VW AG is the top seller.

Edit: [Source](https://www.marklines.com/en/statistics/flash_sales/salesfig_norway_2019) for the curious.

VW: 16.361
Audi: 6.193
Skoda: 5.630
Total: 28.184

Tesla: 16.857

Still very good for Tesla considering it’s a small foreign company that only sells BEVs."
"No it's not. It's the perfect country for Electric cars. 

All our electricity comes from hydro power, so it's cheap and clan. 

Most people own their own house, so they charge at home. 

However, the Model 3 isn't built for Norway. It's built for California. 

So Norway is perfect for EVs, but the Model 3 isn't perfect for Norway. But it is the most sold car this year..."
Why so?
"Except that it's cold there.  Cold weather is one thing that EV's don't seem to handle with grace just yet.  Honestly, Audi and Nissan have much better technology in this area."
"These are the things that are holding me back:

* Cost (equivalent price ICE cars have interiors with more amenities/are nicer.)
* Lack of access to chargers (there are no superchargers anywhere near me, can't charge on 120v in appt garage in winter, and no chargers at work.)
* Severe range reduction in cold climates (if there were superchargers on my travel paths that'd be less of a concern.)"
Hell of a first car!

theres a SHIT ton of things america can learn from norway
"Also gjetost (brunost), an amazing sweet and tangy cheese that almost no one in America knows about. So that’s three things."
"People in Norway really hate their prison system. ""They capture a rapist, tell him there there, and let him go to kill and rape someone else.""

Although on the balance, I'd say it's better than America's basically privatized slavery machine."
"Meh I think Norway is a little too light on prison sentencing. Case and point, white supremacist, murderer, world heritage site burner (alleged) Varg roams the world pushing his rhetoric on unsuspecting lonely impressionable folks. His life outside of prison only furthers racism and hate based on bunk science.

Although I did enjoy his music projects, unironically."
Test drive in Melbourne ? :P ( ill take passenger trip too lol )
"Very few cars on the market compare favorably to a Toyota Corolla when it comes to reliability and durability, especially in its price range. It remains to be seen how well Teslas and other BEVs will age, but I highly doubt I will ever see as many 20+ year old Teslas on the road as I see Corollas.

Repairs will definitely be much more expensive. Especially body works due to the aluminum.

Over here in The Netherlands, virtually all Model 3s are leased company cars, though. So as a driver it is not much of a concern how expensive the repairs are or how well it will hold up after more than 5 years."
"Service bad.
Car good."
"> Norway has had a huge tax on cars with horsepower without regard of co2 output. That is obviously not the case with electric cars here.

I mean, this isn't the case for ICE vehicles anymore either, so not really that relevant for current cars."
It's not just Mustang E.  The Audi Etron and Jaguar iPace been out and they aren't even competitive.  The Hyundai Kona EV is the only crossover selling but still hardly competitive.
People love any car from a company that hasn't been purposely stalling progress so they can continue lying to line their pockets or stealing money from their loyal customers through planned obsolesce.

"We only get deliveries every 3 months here in Norway... Model 3 started in March, then June, then September."
They're literally everywhere. In every street. I love seeing it.
"I thought that was the Dutch.  They have some weird tax incentive and everyone orders at the end of the year.  Tesla plays ball and prioritizes them for a few months.  Then in January & February, nothing."
"Well, it's still common to list cars by make/brand rather than by who owns the makes, and despite the shared ownership people don't mentally include Audio and Skoda when they say VW.

All of which makes Tesla the highest selling make but not the highest selling automaker, I guess."

You failed to mention why it’s not perfect for Norway.
"A Norwegian:  You make statements which are wrong

Most people are living in dense population areas in apartments or share a house with others. Most of them couldn't charge at home because when property is shared, all of them had to agree for installing charging points. 

Hydro power is not a necessity for EV, but renewable energy. Even a country like Germany could have a cheap supply by solar and wind power only.   German politics choose a different path and is taxing power heavily.  

Model 3 is  like every other car. I couldn't find a problem to use Model 3 in Norway even with ice and snow on the road. I'm more concerned about the salt on the roads in our city.  

My battery survives even -20C without any range anxiety. 

Buying the Model3 AWD opens for the option of not using studded tires, since studded tires have worse properties than most winter tires, with the exception of pure ice on the road. 

All in all Model 3 is a good car for Europe."
[deleted]
Norway can be perfect for the Model3 AND for other EVs too.
It's also the best electric car. That's why it's the best selling one.
That doesn’t make sense... just because someone created something in a specific place does not mean it can’t be overly suitable for another place... your comment sounds heavily biased.
"They’re big on EV rebates. Smart country that is rich in petroleum, but knows it’s not good for the planet."
"You can get around the mainland on one charge for the most part, and heading north is really linear so it’s easy to plan for superchargers. 

There is a lot more infrastructure for charging during the day at grocery stores, malls, etc. 

The country politically is very pro-ev. 

Definitely the only car I’d own if I lived there."
Why not? 🧐
Y'all really downvoting this man for asking someone to clarify an ambiguous claim
"The real answer is because its the only manufacturer that can deliver an Electric car with that mileage within 2 months. Kia, Opel, Hyundai, etc have looong waiting lists. Up to 8 months. So people buy what they can get."

"That is not true. Norway was building hydrodams before oil was found. So claiming norway can only afford dams because of oil is wrong. Many of the dams were planned/under construction when oil was found in 1969. In [1970](https://no.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannkraft_i_Norge) norway was 57% hydro. Norway also produces more electricity than it uses (most years) so  clean energy is exported. 

And why do you act like it would stop other contries from importing oil if norway stopped exporting it. If norway stopped pumping oil tomorrow it would just make saudi/russia/venezuela richer. What you want is the  need for oil to go away. The market must shrink and by giving the inhabitants of norway incentives to buy electric cars the goverment of norway is helping to shrink the very market they get rich from. 
I would love it if we directly invested more money from the fund into alternatives to oil, so i also think norway could do more. But you are giving us more blame than we deserve


edit: you claim in this thread that 70%of exports are oil, but from i can see its more like [53%](https://www.ssb.no/utenriksokonomi/statistikker/muh/aarwhere) ? where do you your numbers from?"
Fun fact none of Norway’s social programs are funded by oil. Just income tax.
"No. It can't. The Model 3 has ""flaws"" in the design that other design options would have fixed. 

Don't get me wrong. Model 3 is a good car, and it works for Norway too, but you are setting the bar at ""perfect"" here. Frame less doors that need the window to go down are not ""perfect"" for sub zero climates."
"Yes it is. All frameless doors are worse than framed doors in the cold. Because the window keeps freezing. Ergo, it's not the best."
"Burning petroleum is bad for the planet, good thing there are way more things that can be made with it."

">You can get around the mainland on one charge for the most part

No, you can't. Unless you're hypermiling. And thats without concidering the north of Norway a part of the mainland, which it is. But yes, Norway has come far regarding charging infrastructure.

Edit: Amazing to be downvoted on this one as a Norwegian living in central Norway owning a Model 3 Long range. Reddit is a weird place."
Always wonder how you guys know if a post / answer is being downvote?
"Seriously, wtf is with the downvotes on a simple question? That's just dumb."
Or maybe it's because Teslas are the best EVs on the road right now?
"Yes, they use a heat pump instead of a resistive heater, which means they can heat the interior of a car using only about 1/3rd as much energy as a Tesla.  Audi also does this.  To add insult to injury, they left the battery completely uninsulated on the bottom of the car, which means it is extremely difficult to heat it.  Last winter, this forum and others were full of people complaining that their cars wouldn't supercharge at more than level 2 speeds because the battery was too cold.  I bought my model 3 knowing all of this, but I'm honest with myself... this car didn't come 100% compromise free.  That's a shame, because these are such simple problems to fix."
"Why would we want to land people on the moon? And why would we want to make Teslas? 

And where would we get the money?"

"That's a story couple of guys from Norway told me. I was just as surprised, especially as they were both in complete agreement with each other, nodding heads and everything.

Maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong. But I'm sharing my experience.

America looks awesome from the outside as well, you know. Hence all the immigration."
"Im from Norway and I think rape, violence, child offences and murder need more pubishment then what we currently have. Alote of it feels like a slap on the wrist, while the person they harmed suffer for years/decades!"

"Yes, that's what I said. So what new did you want to bring to the conversation? Your arrogant patronizing attitude? Well, I'm so impressed."
"No... that statement was pulled completely out of context by basically everyone... He was just saying that at the cash burn rate of Q1(1), which was just really bad and not a regular quater because there were a lot of special effects at play, they would burn through the capital they just raised (2) so not all the cash they have, (and they could still raise more capital at any time) in 10 months or something. But there was no news in that statement. Anyone could have calculated that by just looking at the Q1 financial results and the filings for the capital raise."

"EV range loss is exactly why Model 3 is good for Norway. Being an EV is pretty much necessary with the pricing structure in Norway,  and long range, good thermal management and quick supercharging is much more important in winter conditions. These are areas where the Model 3 excels. However if winter conditions where seriously considered in the design phase, Tesla would have made framed doors and different door handles. The door handles are horrible around 0*C. The windows are okay with sufficient preheating of the interior. Also there are serious doubts about the anti corrosion treatment of the Model 3.

As you can see, a heat pump can be useful down to -20c, which would cover the vast majority of the winter in most of the world.  The average temperature in January in Oslo Norway is about -3c, meaning even Norway, even in January, a heat pump could be 3X more efficient.

Dont the backs of your hands get even colder feeling? That makes heated steering wheels always feel strange to me
">And the lack of a heated steering wheel! The day that stops bothering me 

I've never had one so I don't miss it but I really do wish for vented or better yet cooled seats.

>they could've used a heat pump to be more efficient in cold weather. 

Heat pumps work well in the temps that don't need battery heat and need very little cabin heat, especially with the motor and batteries providing some of it via the superbottle. That makes me think it would have limited value. In the temperatures where you need a lot of cabin heat and additionally battery heat, the heat pump doesn't work well and needs to use a resistive heater anyways which would be additional weight and packaging space to fit both. Even if the A/C can be ran in reverse, additional valves and complexity in their integrated cooling/heating system likely."
"I dont know how to get the silicone on the inside of the window in the door. I do have it on the frame, and helps the door not freeze stuck. But the window is frozen and can't slide."
"It's not really that much of a waste of energy. While it is true that heating the cabin uses a non-trivial amount of energy, in cold weather you'll have your cabin heat on anyway. Starting the heating at the moment you start driving or 5 minutes earlier doesn't make much of a difference energy-wise. It does make a big difference in comfort though.

Unless you want to get into your car but not drive it, but those would be pretty exceptional situations."
Preheating makes you comfortable and warms up the battery increasing efficiency too.  It's better all around.  It's also why ICE cars should spend a good amount of time warming up in those climates before driving - it helps engines last longer when the oil is warmed too.
So there is no heating in the back window of the model 3? 😮
"> Even without accounting for the Norway-supplied oil being burned elsewhere in the world

I thought the point being made was ""Norway sells oil -> ??? -> CO2 is Norway fault"". If Norway doesn't burn the oil what accounts for their huge amount of GHG? I assume there is a link to have money and making GHG from something other than oil?"
"Finn fact... The oil fund isn't oil money. Sure, the profits from the oil production goes into the fund, but what we take money from the fund, not directly from the oil. Even when there is no oil production, we can still take money from the fund.

This shows you the difference generally between GCC specs and US specs."
It still uses energy albeit less. Also a cold battery is just less efficient.
The model 3 doesn't use a heatpump for ac/heating?
Yup that would make it better but it would still have less range in the cold.
ICE cars heat up the cabin with heat from the engine.
"Based on all the discussions about heated steering wheels, I feel like people's hands react vastly differently to the cold. And here's another example I guess. I had no idea someone could feel cold in the backs of the hands!

For me a heated steering wheel is exactly what I need when it gets below 10c or so. Otherwise my palms stay cold for a good 10 minutes after I get in the (pre-heated car), and putting on gloves doesn't really make it go any faster."
"When you want to run small errands, you don't care as much about preconditioning to reach max range. In this case, the preheating for 30 minutes is sorta kinda a waste of energy and I don't do it, maybe a couple minutes so the cabin is warm and go. Problem is, when you can't open the doors because they are iced up and you *have* to preheat for 30 minutes just to get in the damn thing, losing both time and energy, it kind of sucks."
"Preheating long enough to improve the car's efficiency is just a waste of electricity. You'll use more energy warming the car over 30 mins to an hour than you save by improving efficiency. I'll preheat my car to get the cabin warming for a few mins, but that's about it. 

Also, modern ICE cars don't really need to warm up more than 30 seconds or so before driving, that's a leftover idea from the age of carburated engines. Just don't floor it right away and you're fine. Heating it up through normal driving is better because it gets the engine up to temp faster which leans out the fuel-air mixture faster."
"An ICE Engine warms up faster when you drive it carefully and at low rpm, at least that's what I learned"
"I mean, how much do you know about oil & gas extraction? Just getting it out of the ground, moving it, and storing it is intensive in terms of both pollution and energy. That goes double for extracting it in the middle of the North Sea. Even on land most drilling sites are too remote to run on a sizable electrical grid, so the power usually has to come from diesel & natural gas generators. Then there’s the difficulty in containing the product you recover. Oftentimes you will need to flare off some of the product due to overpressure or other circumstances, especially when you have excess methane, which is both a safety risk and a much worse greenhouse gas than its combustion byproducts. There’s all sorts of stuff like that involved in the endeavor that lead to significant GHG emissions."

"> Read the 3rd comment (not reply) in this post.

There's nothing to substantiate those claims. Tesla aims to simplify production and make one product suit all markets. The software might be different, but the hardware is identical."
"With our current technology they will always have less range, but they could have limited the loss.  I'm sure they'll get there in future iterations of their cars, especially with the big competition coming in from other major OEMs, especially the European ones who absolutely love to do extensive winter testing in the far north."
"My back of hand still cold with BMW wheel, much prefer preheating if had to choose one, but both should be option...for workaround place / stick gloves in air slot or leave on seat (they will preheat with car and you will be toasty)

Also pre-directing air flow onto wheel also helps preheating."
"Engines need to warm up longer than that even in the hottest desert summer.  It's why startup is much lower efficiency for ICE, they legally have to run the warmup procedure to heat up catalytic converters into operating temp.  Just because you're unaware of how long and how inefficient the startup process is doesn't make it not so.  The same applies to EVs, except they're more efficient overall.  Modern ICE cars have inefficient warmup programs that take into account cold weather, but they're still taking a considerable amount of time and energy running that warmup protocol whether you're running the car hard and putting it away wet or treating it gently."
"It's not just ICE, Evs do it too.  MAchines in general work better when warmed to operating temperature, but ICE needs to waste a lot of energy just to comply with emissions laws and get the cat warm as fast as possible so they waste way more energy than they actually need to just for engine efficiency and longevity to comply with emissions.  Whether you're driving or not, ICE engines are running less efficiently to heat up the cats in the exhaust because they don't work cold.  Cats need to be over 1000 degrees to fully operate so ICE engines work hard at startup to make that much waste heat for pollution law compliance."
"Good points, thanks for the info. I know some places are moving the energy used to extract to renewable but you pointed out remote areas. It is a shame they can't use that methane to at least generate their electricity, not GHG friendly but at least not wasted. I was thinking maybe turning it into hydrogen but that is just one gas to another with CO2 byproduct.

I hope the investment Norway is making in batteries will lead to windmills, tidal, and solar being feasible in remote areas. I am glad Norway isn't [dismantling windmills](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2019/11/19/ford-government-spending-231m-to-cancel-renewable-energy-projects/) and [likely moving teacher pensions into oil industry](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/teachers-pension-rod-matheson-alberta-health-services-1.5337431) but instead trying to put out less GHG than they could be.

EDIT: according to [list of countries by greenhouse gas emissions wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions) in 2017 US does 6673.4497 for a population of 327,200,000, Norway does 46.5925 for a population of 5,328,000. If I did the math right that is US at 0.000020 vs Norway 0.000008 per person. Maybe that wiki isn't taking into account offshore drilling as that is considered 'imported'?"
"The same identical product can't suit all markets, because different markets have different weather conditions. GCC spec cars are 15-20% more expensive than US spec cars for a reason. The claims come from the Dubai service manager who stated that the AC unit is different (which makes sense). Here you'll never find a GCC car priced the same as the US version, the former is always priced higher."
"I would’ve had a source to share with you a few days ago but I’m having trouble finding it now, I’m sorry about that. It’s possible the model it used tried corrected for something that’s missed by the normal calculation method. If I stumble upon it in the future I’ll drop a link"

"Because there was an opening on the curb there, the car likely interpreted the pedestrian as being in the road. 

You ever notice when you're driving along a street and you see the right side boundary on the display widen once you hit intersections and driveways where there is a break in the curb? 

It isn't perfect execution obviously because the pedestrian was not in danger of being hit, but I think it is as least explainable what happened."
I believe I was accelerating gently but it's hard to remember exactly. Either way tho my foot was into the accelerator and it didn't matter it braked hard anyway. Which is a good thing if someone is truly in your path.

Funny thing is a Waymo van did a similar thing for me. I was perpendicular parked on the street and I slammed my door shut and the van 20 feet away on the road screeched to a halt. I'm guessing the door rapidly moving must've confused their sensors into thinking I was moving towards the street.

EDIT: Saw OP was not on AP.  Very troubling as big cities have lots of pedestrians and that one wasn't even that close to the edge of the road.  This makes driving in the loop very dangerous and frustrating.
What version was this on?
"In the cars defense he was on the street rather than the curb.

I would rather it be too protective than too risky.

It is pretty strange that he isn't moving when the car stops though."
To be fair he was like 4 inches in the road
"Maybe because he's standing on the drive way, not the sidewalk."
"Iirc pedestrians in the road have the right of way. The AI did not slam on the brakes for pedestrians standing on the curbs, just this guy who was off the curb. 

I remember a sting on the local news several years ago where the cops were posing as pedestrians and stepping off of curbs then citing cars which didn't stop."
"1. neural net should calculate his t-1, t-2 position to predict behavior and act in the safest way possible. from the video i can detect with my eyes on a small screen the pedestrian 2 full secs prior to braking

2. even if neural net believes pedestrian would jump in front of the car, it should get to the point where it slows down gracefully so not to create a rear end situation

behavior above tells me the image processing algos are far from feature complete. 

just my 2c of course"
Fuck I had tickets to that Hozier show....
"Same thing happened to me with a pedestrian waiting in the middle of the road, waiting for the traffic to clear to finish his crossing.

The M3 smashed on the brakes, and went into park mode.

Luckily there wasn't any car behind me at the time. It could have made for some nasty rear ending.

Like you, AP wasn't activated."
"This is a hard problem to solve, on one hand we should be pretty confident a guy won't just straight walk into traffic, so the tesla shouldn't break until he does. On the other hand, if the Tesla is trying to avoid hitting him at all costs, you almost have to slow down prior to seeing him step out as it would be too late to react otherwise. These little corner cases are going to get blown up in the future I think, rightfully so, but at the same time a human driver is approaching it in a similar way - though we tend to err on the side of ""no one is that stupid, so I'll slow a little down but not stop fully and assume he won't step out"""

How did you get moving again once the system slammed the brakes?
The emergency braking shouldn't be all or nothing. It should allow for semi-slowing down if it's a borderline case.
Good old classic Chicago
"I've had issues with AEB come on unnecessarily in my 3 twice now. The first time it was justified more than the second but still not necessary. I was going maybe 15mph because a stop light had just gone green and someone cut in front of the car in front of me causing them to slam on their brakes. I slowed down pretty quickly but AEB decided it wasn't fast enough even though at the point when it engaged, I was going maybe a little over 5mph and still had enough space to stop at the current rate I was slowing down, and it slammed on the brakes. The second time I was in some slow moving traffic on a residential street waiting to go around a round about and the person in front of me stopped, I was going about 10mph or so and let off the accelerator to stop when AEB decided it was going to do the same thing again and slam on the brakes even though there was plenty of room for me to stop at such a low speed."
I thought you are supposed to use autopilot on freeways.
Why are people here defending autopilot here. Its a dangerous mistake that could have caused a rear ending.
"Depends on the location, but in some places, stopping is the law if he's in the street which he arguably was."
This is a pretty major flaw in their detection algos. I know FSD is learning in shadow mode but shocking that issues like this haven’t been rectified and pushed to cars via an update.
Mine keeps thinking there’s a car coming in from the side
"This is a major bug and safety risk. I guess the car thinks he might be crossing. Would this still happen at higher speeds?

How do you override this? Can you?"
"His reaction is the same when I moved to Europe, and the first driver stopped for me at the pedestrian crossing!

LOL, back home drivers don't stop for pedestrians ...."
"Had a similar thing. I was driving super slowly, and pedestrians had crossed in front of the car as I was driving in a pedestrian area. Then at a moment when there was no one crossing it slammed on the brakes just like this, with ABS and all."
Is it possible the car treats the dude as part of the main traffic coming from the right rather than a pedestrian because if you look only at the street it looks like a possible crossroads where he may have had the right of lane?
My model S does shit like that. You’d be on cruise control (not even autopilot) and it decides to yank on the brakes randomly if something is just off the side of the road or even a few times shadows from a tree are cast across the road. It’s a real problem. I’ve lost trust in using mine. Whenever I have cruise control active I have to hover my foot over the accelerator whenever I think something might set it off so I can quickly power out of the brake. Dangerous and someone is going to rear end my car one day from it.
I posted about this on the model 3 subreddit... Same thing happened to me and scared the hell out of me. Lol

"Now everyone will know that and tesla hater will voluntary be close to the traffic just for ""fun"" when a tesla will approach"
Better safe. That terd burglar needs to stand on the sidewalk.
Maybe the car got confused because the guy was not on the sidewalk
It’s always had this issue. I remember watching the official tesla video of them showing off autopilot and it does the same thing with a jogging couple on the sidewalk. I know you weren’t on autopilot but the sensors don’t have enough tech to differentiate between people running on the sidewalk and people running toward the street.
Duuuuuumb. When I drove one it would brake for trucks stopped in the lane to the right.
"Wow, that's really dangerous. That totally could've caused an accident."

"Looks like it was happy not braking... until he moved his head.. which the car read as leaning in to start walking.     

It's those early clues that deep learning sees that trigger a 'brake now or it's too late' reaction.    There's a lot of people commenting how lane-intrusion seems to know when a car is merging before the driver does... because it 'sees' the wheel angle even if there's no blinker"
"I’ve had the automatic avoidance feature activate randomly.  Honestly, I’m not sure what it was trying to avoid as there weren’t any people or objects in or close beside the road.

Fortunately, I haven’t had any issues with AEB yet, but I have had issues with TACC slowing down for nothing in the exact same spot."
Great video quality! (especially from the front cam) Do you have HW3?
"Friendly reminder: ""Very startling for my wife and me ...."" Object case vs. subject case in English. Pronouns always take object case after prepositions. Easy way to test this is to remove ""my wife and"" and see what you would say. It wouldn't be ""Very startling for I."""
How many dumb incidents like this are gonna happen before Tesla admits it needs LiDAR?
This happened to me as well! But with a car in front that it thinks I'm gonna hit. I was already regen braking and it slammed the brakes so hard it probably ruined them argh. It got me thinking if it would also slam its brakes suddenly while I'm driving 90mph on the fwy since I tend to switch lanes within mere inches.
"I'm curious. If you were rear ended, and they found you at fault, do you think you might able to get some sort of compensation from Tesla? Or is it all still on you?"

But in California, that is an intersection which means the gentleman has the complete right of way to cross. In California, a crosswalk exists everywhere two roads intersect.

98% of drivers dont know this (and many will downvote this post because of that). 

99.9% of drivers don't follow this law. 

I wonder if this was at play in any way with the software?"

Almost as startling as a Hozier show being sold out.

"that is a great response, could have been someone running sprinting across the street."
"No PSA here, you use autopilot in town you get humiliated."
"Wow, this is amazing the car did this. Determining to stop in such a situation requires subtle detection of forward motion or intention to move in the path of the car. This requires processing of the video feed and training on these actions. I would be surprised if Tesla is this advanced yet. So they are doing the best next thing of detecting of a person who could move into the path of the car. But this results in too many false detection cases. We just have to live with their engineers learning that these situations are more complex than they thought. Unfortunately Teslas don’t use a neocortex model of the neural network so we have to live with the more simplistic models they use and the training they do on their black box model.   Let’s all be patient. We will see progress accelerate."
Almost like you aren’t supposed to use it in the city and it’s in beta...
PSA to you knowing how your car works....
“Ey!  I’m not walkin ‘ere!”
The last few frames he was trying convince the onlookers that he was not about to commit suicide.
Reminds me of Roy from IT Crowd.
"He's like damn, the Tesla guy has mad respect for me."
Also reminds you how hard this problem is. Humans understand what he means.
"Was your foot on the accelerator?  Did Auto-Emergency Braking OVERRIDE your foot being on the accelerator?  


Or were you letting off the accelerator at the time?  


Just trying to get an idea of how much it's willing to force the brake override."
"This same thing happened to me and I wondered whether it was something I did until I saw your post. I was driving along a one way street and some woman was walking along to her car, and my Model 3 just slammed on the brakes and freaked out everyone in the car, including the woman. She wasn’t in front of the car and there was plenty of room between me and the parked car. I had my foot on the accelerator the whole time so didn’t think it could take over like that."
"It is because he is **not** on the sidewalk but on the lowered ""driveway"" which would be rendered as ""drivable space"" and Tesla Vision encountered a human in that space.

At least that is my best guess at the logic here."
Wait what? This is a serious issue if it does something that drastic without anything being in the way or moving in front of the car.
Repeat this section again for science
Pedestrian or was it thinking that huge building overhang was a big vehicle overhanging in the lane?
"Oh wow, I assumed you were on autopilot"
"Yeah. My drive assist has done 1 or 2 stupid things before to the point I think I need to turn it off. The scariest time was I was just driving along the windy road out of my neighborhood, and in the middle of a long turn just swerved me partway into the next lane. No cars were near me when it happened, but holy shit, it moved me a good foot into the next lane for no reason."
"To clarify, you did not even have TACC engaged correct?  That's a bit of a pickle.  Someone on their phone behind you could have easily rearended you."
"If a car is going to make errors, I'd rather they 'd be like this than err the other way round and risk hitting a pedestrian."
"It has something to do with Mars being in retrograde. It's programmed into the system, and our hearts. Watch out for squirrels darting into traffic until the next moon."
"This is actually somewhat correct statement. The estimation algorithm given all previous training data was certain that in such scenarios humans are crossing a street and it predicted that as the outcome. If you notice, he is not standing on a sidewalk which further increases the machine's confidence. Furthermore, even the machine was on the fence about his expected movement, it likely was overriden by safety algorithms that put more emphasis on saving lives. These are the hard edge cases that makes self driving capabilities very hard to implement."
we are doomed
I’ve slammed on my brakes when a pedestrian looks like they’re going to hop out. It happens.
"Hand gestures scream asshole.

Edit: the LAST hand gesture."
Underrated comment
Yes this was exactly my thinking too. I'm sure if he would have been up in the sidewalk it wouldn't have done that.
Pretty sure this is right on the money.
"This is exactly why fully autonomous driving like Elon is trying to push for is decades away. Same for his neural link business. Machine learning and the ""AI"" we have at the moment are not even in the same ballpark as AGI which human brains work with. We don't even understand what consciousness is, and by we I mean cutting edge science. 

There are so so so many little tiny details that our brains process and compute whilst not even thinking about it. Even this simple case of ""the guy's in the road, but not in MY road"". It gets even more abstract when you notice that the road is probably closed judging by the cones. Humans understand this small detail, there is no way current AI can detect the millions of nuances.

You can actually see the difference between AI and AGI by the guys ""what the fuck are you doing?"" gesture. It's such an easy concept for him to understand, but not the car."
Or a bad thing if you get rear ended.
how long before you were able to move forward again? after it came to a complete stop?
It wasn't though. Don't you find that scary at all? What if the car behind you backed into you or something else happened? You are not totally in control anymore and that really frightens me.
Looks that way lol.
"It looks like a closed pedestrian street, there are pylons up in the middle of the road."
"Still, the car shouldn't have stopped right? 

Maybe he wasn't completely following traffic laws but this still shows a flaw with the system. No one expected the car to just slam the brakes there and it probably shouldn't right?"
😂😂😂
And do you find it scary that you have no control over that?
You have to explicitly tell it to use the HOV lane in settings because of how LA's HOV lanes work where you can't get out of them after you enter.
What if you only use the cruise control (and steer manually)? Curious if it's an autopilot issue.

">wasn't even that close to the edge of the road

He was actually *on* the road, just not in front of the car."
2019.32.12.2
"Be cause the other lanes aren't stopping, he won't walk in because one car stopped."
I definitely think that was the issue.
I don't believe there is any prediction at all.  Only estimation of current states.
"The neural net has no speed adjusting behavior at this time.

If an object is flying in very quickly, it only responds as it gets super close... not like calculating for speed. But in future updates (probably 9 months), it will start calculating for speed."
"The ironic problem... is the humans doing things that are unusual, unpredictable and ambiguous.  \*sigh\*"
"Don't Google ""Tesla Rear End""... and don't click any of those naughty links..."
This looks like automatic emergency braking.  Kicks on whether autopilot is on or not.
Not on autopilot.
Do you know if doing that also will eliminate phantom brake events near overpasses or is that separate?
Once you get the drive you just create a folder on it called TeslaCam and insert it. Then if you wanna save an incident you can just tap the dashcam icon at the top right of the screen and I believe it saves the last 10 minutes.
I just let of the accelerator and pushed it again and it let me resume.
Wow I mean I have a lot of the audible alerts chime unnecessarily (I have it set to medium). But have not had the AEB kick in until this. Not counting the phantom brake events for overpasses but those just slow me down and don't usually full on hit the brakes thankfully.
"Reading this, I changed my mind about getting this. Very scary to me"
Yeah this is obviously a mistake or an edge case if you wanna call it that. I mean it's cool that it worked as designed in terms of it stopping for the pedestrian but the guy wasn't actually in my path. Sometimes the car is like magic but it's incidents like this that remind me that it's got a ways to go and we need to be aware of it's shortcomings.
"In a way it is, but in a way it also isnt. 

The guy was standing on the street, facing the car. 

If I was in this situation and say I looked in my side mirror for one second, looked back forward and all I could register was a guy standing in the road facing my car leaning in, I can predict that even my brain might mistake him for walking Into the street. It's a sticky situation all around."
[deleted]
Can't you turn it off??
Dude what???? This is not safe at all!
Front and rear footsge is from a Rexin V1P camera I got off Amazon before they enable the dash cam feature. Once they enabled the build in dashcam I just left it for redundancy and I'm glad I did because it's much wider and a lot better quality for the front camera. But build in is nice for sides and rear is nice since it's outside the car not looking through rear window. The last shot in the video is the build in camera. I used the aftermarket footage for the rear because since the built in camera records in 1 min increments with like what seems like a small gap in between each 1 min clip. So the rear footage was broken up right when the car behind me hit his brakes so it was better to use the 3rd party dash cam footage.
Ok thanks! I've been outta school for awhile! lol
"This is a very interesting comment. Please help me parse what you are trying to say here. How would lidar change anything in your opinion?
Lidar offers a very fine point cloud which helps a lot in object detection at short to medium range. It also lets you detect objects that are low contrast and in shadows (as it actively emits light used for detection).
So if the pedestrian was not recognized with cameras where it should have need - then you would have a point about lidar. Here however we have a clear case of pedestrian detection working just fine and the control logic decided that this pedestrian is too close to the car's path and it needs to break. Better safe than sorry.
Lidar would change nothing as the control logic would be the same."
"Is the law that a driver must always yield to a pedestrian in the crosswalk, even if the pedestrian is crossing when there is a No Crossing light?  I mean, obviously the driver should always stop and not hit someone in the crosswalk, but your post seems to imply that a pedestrian can legally cross at a crosswalk whenever they feel like, regardless of the traffic lights."
"> intended behavior

Yeah, slaming on the brakes for no reason and almost getting rear ended is the intended behavior of a safety system. /s"
I think it’s actually on point and helpful.
Slamming on the brakes for no reason is not safe.
I was not on autopilot but still was a bit humilated I suppose for my cars irratic behaviour...they didnt know the car did it though they probably though I was just on drugs or something lol
"This isn't from autopilot. The car has built in emergency breaking, even with autopilot off."
"""Requires subtle detection of forward motion or intention...""  No, it doesn't require any of that.  Only the misidentification of the pedestrian as being in the lane of travel."
"It's not AP, it's emergency braking. There's no mention of it being beta, it's a feature even Civics have."
Wasn't on autopilot sir this was just the emergency automatic braking feature which made a mistake most likely because the dude was not on the sidewalk but in that little driveway into alley.
You mean How your car gets rear ended
"I need to watch it again. 

“IT... have you tried to turn it on and off?”"
Perfect
Upvote not because I don't agree whatsoever but because of IT Crowd.
Perfect
"My understanding is emergency braking is designed to override your foot being on the accelerator. It's primary purpose is to stop the car when it has seen an obstacle you did not see. While there are some instances (like this one) where it has made mistakes, it has also prevented a lot of accidents."
That is honestly terrifying.
[deleted]
Definitely the pedestrian because I saw him on the screen lit up red!
"No I didn't have TACC engaged, or AP. Yes, thankfully they were paying attention!"
I'd rather my car not override the driver when they are in control.
"Maybe that explains the stupid wallaby that jumped out right in front of me on the weekend. Missed him by less than a meter; car impressed me with its brakes.

On second thought, nah; stupid wallabies always jump right out in front of you. Sometimes hop along parallel for a while, wait, wait, wait, ... NOW! Dopey bastards."
"He also turned his head away, so he was inattentive to the approach of the Model 3. I don't know the ins and outs of the algorithm, but I know that some video processing AIs observe human attention based on head orientation. 

If the Model 3 saw him look away it might assume he was about to step forward without seeing the Model 3 approaching."
[deleted]
"Well sure, but until then we have neat cars"
"No. There's nothing asshole-like about that. There's nothing wrong with communicating that someone should move along when it looks like they've stopped for you, and there's no better way to do it than with that kind of gesture."
Yeah that's pretty much what I thought too. Like ok buddy calm down...
"Indeed.  There were other pedestrians closer to you, but on a footpath.  He was, by all accounts, standing in the middle of the road.  And facing you (does Tesla know which was pedestrians are facing?)."
"Well, I don't think we're decades away, but I think we need help from outside the vehicle in order to make fully autonomous driving possible. 

If you look at this situation, the car got confused because there is no painted line to differentiate between the road and where the pedestrian was standing. And since there was no curb in that spot, the car had no way of knowing that this person was actually standing in a safe place and that no intervention was needed. In this situation, a simple painted line either along the entire curb or at least a dotted line over that driveway would eliminate the possibility of this mistake. 

I think cities will have to partner with autonomous car manufacturers like Tesla to optimize their roads for autonomous cars. In addition to more clearly painted lines on the road, I could see a future where certain types of signs are placed in the city to help autonomous cars. Either signs, or sensors that emit a signal, etc. 

I think it has to be a collaborative effort because you're right, I don't see AI being able to understand nuances in the way that humans can anytime soon. I do think simple changes to our roads/infrastructure would allow for autonomous driving a lot sooner, though."
"Just curious, would it still be the fault of the rear ender? I thought that technically you are supposed to give enough following distance so that even if cars come to sudden and unexpected stop, you won't hit them."
Pretty much right away I was able to resume moving forward. I can't remember if I hit the brake or if that mattered even. I think I did hit the brake. Others have said that if i would have been able to press even harder on the accelerator it would have overrode it but I didn't think about that or really have the time to react.
A little concerning...yes!
"It's a little side street/alley for loading and unloading at the theatre. Traffic does turn in and out of there, so I'm not sure why the dude was just standing in the middle of it. The orange cones are on each side of the street to block off where the sidewalk starts."
Certainly a fun way to get rear-ended
"You could argue that every driver should slow down to a safe speed when there are pedestrians so close to the road. Driving as-is results in 1.25 million deaths around the world.

Too many people die on the roads. EVERY SINGLE accident is really caused by people driving too fast for conditions.

When there is pedestrians close to the road the safe speed is walking speed, or perhaps even 0MPH.

When there is an intersection with limited visibility (even with a green light) the safe speed is probably 15MPH. 

Blind corners, the safe speed is slow enough to avoid any hazard that may be in the road. 

Drunk drivers should drive at 0 MPH.
People without seat belts should at 0MPH.
People with under-inflated/worn tires should drive at 0MPH.

We all trade safety for decreased travel time, the question is just how much the time we save is worth."
My biggest fear is getting rear ended by the car behind me. It’s a safety hazard IMO. Same issue with fandom braking when passing overhead signs etc.
[deleted]
I do have that selected.   I've noticed similar behavior on the I15 carpool lane in SD as well.  It'll even change into the wrong lane before exiting.
"Try Mumbai, India"
"No, he was in an alley and he was behind where the curb runs.  Look at the video again.  That's not the road and no one should be stopping for pedestrians standing in areas like that.  He never made one motion towards the road and his reaction says it all (what the fuck are you stopping for??)."
"At Autonomy Investor Day, Karpathy talked about being able to predict when something is going to be in the path of the car. Not sure if that’s currently implemented or a future enhancement."
Wouldn't any car with automatic emergency braking do this?
[I don’t like this.](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT5P0VsQ3cH8AFD6Du/giphy.gif)
"thx for info, this needs to applied in my homeland !"
Not as far as I can tell it’s automatically part of cruise and a safety feature.
"No, this is in reference to unsignalized intersections, such as the one in the video.

At a signalized intersection, pedestrians must obey the traffic control device. HOWEVER, a driver who hits a pedestrian crossing against the light could be cited for failing to exercise due care."
"The system detected a pedestrian and stopped. That's the definition of intended behavior. Would you prefer that it continues moving toward the pedestrian until it's too late to stop should they choose to walk in front of you?

Perhaps the real issue is that the person behind you was following too close and not paying attention."
PSA: Pressing the accelerator will make you car move.
Actually a guy standing one step from oncoming traffic is very unsafe
has OP claimed it wasnt on AP?
This was without using autopilot? My car has never done that while manually driving.
You really need to watch it again. You first have to turn it off and then on again. (But make sure it's plugged in)
the manual says if you press the accelerator harder it should go
"Hmmm this is a bit of a weird choice. Our Volvo disengages the system and only shows a warning if you press any of the pedals. I always thought it was a clever choice. 

I understand why Tesla didn’t go that way but this could also create other problems such as someone rear ending you etc. Interesting way of handling this. I bet they have some data on this though."
"Didn’t stop me from backing into a pole at a gas station. Where were you then, emergency braking!?"
"Is it? Of all the mistakes automated systems can make, I would argue this is the *least* terrifying. I would gladly take a few false positives for a safer car."
Anything beats running over anyone. But still you wouldn't want to get rear ended when the car does an emergency brake.
The difference hear is it’s not in the middle of the night with the person wearing all black on an unlit street.
Ahh. I guess it’s good to error safe for pedestrians but sheesh glad you weren’t rear ended!
Interesting. Haven’t seen this much before. Wondering if this is some early (and buggy) version of the predictive AEB mentioned during Tesla Autonomy Day that will try to stop for pedestrians that are going to move into your path.
How is emergency breaking to avoid hitting a pedestrian not preferred?
Well obviously. But if you buy a Tesla it has that as a feature. And it will occasionally go wrong.
What’s a meter? I only speak the tongue of freedom.
"Yeah, good point!"
"> This is actually the **somewhat** correct statement  
  
This is what it has to do with the parent comment. While he certainly wasn't _actually_ thinking about offing himself using OP's car, the AI system used all its learned knowledge so far and made the judgment call that it thought (based on his positioning) there was a considerable chance that it would be walked out in front of. So though the man _wasn't_ thinking about walking into traffic, the _AI_ thought he was thinking about it."
"The point was AI doesn't know it all, yet, and the person was very likely not thinking of walking into the traffic. That is, opposite of parent comment, but I wasn't refuting the parent comment and was instead elucidating on the nuance why this such a complex problem."
Talking about the one at the end. Not the motioning thru. The very last one. It conveys WTF when the car was simply being cautious because he was so close to the road.
The headshake/gesture he does in sentry...what a twat.
"Yes, it would."
"Legally yes, but it's never a good experience getting rear ended, especially with a car as expensive as a tesla, I suspect they have to be repaired by a tesla specialist, so it'd be a real pain to get the damage fixed even if someone else's insurance will cover it."
"Yes, that’s correct, but being rear ended is still shit and generally worth avoiding!"
"Yes, legally you’re always at fault pretty much. Unless you get rear-ended.

In Sweden we have two types of crossings, one of pedestrians and one for bikes (and pedestrians). If you were to cross a pedestrian crosswalk as a car and a bike came out of nowhere you’d still be at fault because you’re supposed to drive so that you always can stop, no matter the situation."
"Uh, its pretty much common in Chicago use all areas for pedestrian traffic.  This is nothing unusual.  Pedestrians, rightfully, own the loop.  Cars take a back seat."
"What we probably shouldn't do is suddenly go to 0 mph on a busy road when everyone (even the pedestrians) expects you to continue driving. 

Yes what you're saying is right but we can't just ignore the current state of things and suddenly do what should be done in a utopia when noone else is behaving that way. 

Also in this exact situation I feel like stopping to a halt that quickly is never the safest option (unless of course there is someone in front of the car. Just because there is a pedestrian close to the car doesn't warrant driving at 0 mph at all times. You make good points but they don't really apply to this situation.

If you want a pedestrian crossing on a busy road you don't just start walking across, that's dangerous to both yourself and others. Yes a crosswalk can make things safer but simply acting like there is one just makes things more dangerous for everyone. 
What we should do is adapt these AIs to the current situation and hopefully as more and more cars with self-driving capabilities show up on the roads we can start adapting the general road norms to the capabilities of ai assisted driving or complete self driving cars."
"Interesting. I wonder what the difference is for me. I use HOV lanes in the bay area without any issue, and they're much in the same fashion as in LA. When I first took delivery of the car for a month or maybe longer it seemed to sometimes slam on the brakes when approaching a certain bridge at the hour I typically commuted under it, but then it never did it again. HOVs etc. have always been near perfect."
depends on the programming.
"No because pretty much every other car uses ultrasonic sensors for emergency stop and won't stop until someone is actually in front of you, or for the few smarter ones(i'm assuming) then if someone is about to move in front of you. 

I thought Tesla non AP emergency stop was the same but it doesn't seem like it. The guy isn't moving so it has to be using it's AI and determined that it's a guy and in a road(but not the cars road) and decided to stop I guess? But the guy isn't walking towards the trajectory of the car so it shouldn't have stopped still because there's no way he'd be hit anyway. 

I think this wouldn't happen with any other cars at all and it's just a product of Teslas trying to be extra smart and advanced but is still learning I guess. 

Either way it's definitely a problem, and imo a big one. OP was going like 20? Imagine at 50."
">The system detected a pedestrian and stopped. That's the definition of intended behavior. 

Wouldn't preferred intended behavior be to detect motion of pedestrian towards roads before slamming brakes? I guess there are different levels of sensitivity on different cars for automatic braking but could be refined a bit"
"> Would you prefer that it continues moving toward the pedestrian until it's too late to stop should they choose to walk in front of you

This is ridiculous.

Are you seriously suggesting that a car should slam on the brake whenever it detects a pedestrian on a sidewalk?

Nobody drives like this, because it's stupid and dangerous."
"They weren't following that close and they were paying attention which is why they didnt' hit me. The guy was clearly not in the way but was a little close to the road. I believe what contributed to the issue was the little alleyway entrance there. I imagine the car saw the roadway widen and then saw this guy in the ""road"" and activated the emergency braking system. I mean it's great that if he had been in front of the car he'd have been ok but in this case there was no need to brake. Seems like an edge case and I just wanted to bring it to light."
I had my foot on the accelerator and it braked anyway. After it came to a complete stop it let me resume though immediately. I wasn't on autopilot and I am completely aware of how my car works as I experience the phantom braking for overpasses and know when and how to react quickly to them. This was a new situation I hadn't experienced before and I thought it would helpful to give others a heads up. But I knew as soon as it happened what the car did and why it did it.
I’m no car! 🚙
Yet it happens all the time in the real world.  The real world isn’t the problem.  Slamming on the brakes is.
Yes
"Yes, OP says it was without AP. Had the same issue once, with a cyclist stopped in a crossing bike lane. Pretty scary stuff when there's cars behind you."
Its definitely plugged in
"Right, and my experience so far is that it does. Granted I have not experienced anything like this, but I do have a spot on my way home where my car (while in AP) wants to slow down for some reason and just pressing on the accelerator overrides it just fine. 

Off-topic: that spot where the car slows down is at an intersection along a two lane highway where there is a stop sign for cross traffic. The stop sign is situated in a way where it is at an angle where I can clearly see it until I get really close to the intersection. My theory is that my car is responding to that stop sign, even though I do not have a version of the software where that should be possible. It does not visualize the stop sign on the screen, but every day in this exact spot, it slows itself from 60mph down to about 40mph as we pass that spot and doesnt speed back up until right at the spot where the stop sign is sideways (and is no longer visible from the road). 

Can't fathom any other reason it would do that."
I've had it continue the brake after I realized it was emergency braking erroneously. It was actually scary that I couldn't override the braking with the accelerator.
"My car beeps at me multiple times a week, it won’t override what your feet are doing. My guess is the OP was startled and took his foot off the accelerator."
"nope, it doesn't."
"I'm aware of this too but considering how fast the car is, I'm very cautious about pressing the accelerator harder than normal in traffic. I've never been in an emergency braking situation so I don't know if I would react appropriately."
It doesn't. The car move into park. Pressing the accelerator has no effect.
Well of course all safety features are disabled on gas station property 😂😂
"Until the guy behind you slams into you when the whole situation could have been prevented. Even if you’re not at fault, it’s still a huge pain to deal with."
"I completely agree - IF you’re in autopilot mode.

I’m an incredibly cautious and alert driver. I’ve never been in, or come close to being in, an accident. The idea that my car would brake at an inopportune moment *and* refuse my manual override of its “safety” system via the accelerator while I’m in *manual* driving mode is terrifying sounding, yes. I should always be able to be in control of my vehicle. To me that’s basic.

I’m going to go ahead and disable that feature. I’m not arguing that it’s impossible it could save me from an accident, but in my estimation with the current sophistication of the technology it’s much more likely that it will make a critical mistake than that I will."
[deleted]
Me too!
"Wonder if the emergency stop also takes into effect nearness of rear cars? Does it make it less likely to brake, or decide to brake and get rear ended to save the pedestrian?"
The pedestrian wasn't in the path of the car. It was FALSE braking.
"It wasn't a feature when I bought my car though. This is just like the emergency lane departure fiasco all over again. Tesla released it, almost got some cyclists and pedestrians killed, almost caused dozens of accidents, and took 6 months to fix the problem. Meanwhile, you couldn't turn permanently disable the feature that was forced upon you by updates."
It's like a yard with an Aussie accent.
"Yes I noticed right away that he was already in the street, technically, and I'm sure that weighed heavily in the cars action"
Thank you. You said it better.
He was acting like he wasn't planning on crossing the street.. smh
"Hmm, since it is liability I assume they would have to pay for a rental even if it took months to repair? I've heard the wait time can be considerable, but if nobody can fix the car in 30 days I'd think that liability insurance would have to cover it."
"Just wait until the Model Y, where getting rear ended will mean replacing both the bumper and the hatch."
You mean the don't hit people programming. You'd think that'd be pretty common.
I don't think automatic emergency braking takes effect at 50 mph
"Not necessarily, because of two key reasons.

Path prediction is unimaginably hard to get right, and getting it wrong can mean death.

Reacting cautiously to the presence of a pedestrian is the intended behavior because you're in a 3000 lbs death machine and they're a bag of water and fragile bones.

The car likely didn't ""slam on the brakes"", it's much more probable that the car was already moving slowly and simply stopped. These things feel more severe when you aren't expecting them.

These systems are constantly being refined, though. So the will get better, but they will always have to be overly cautious because we're talking about saving a person's life without knowing what their intent is."
The person wasn't on the sidewalk. And _people_ don't drive like this because we're not idiot robots. That's the difference between us and software.
"So, let me see if I can understand this. Never in your entire life have you been driving and saw a pedestrian standing 6 inches off the street and hit the brakes thinking the pedestrian was about to step out into the street when they weren't? Of course everybody has done this exact thing. 

The car passed many people on the sidewalk in this same video. This particular person was very close to the street and since he wasnt on a curb, the car likely perceived him as being IN the street. Sitting on my couch watching this video, I wouldn't have stopped but i also can't pretend like it's entirely unreasonable that a system designed not to hit pedestrians would."
">They weren't following that close and they were paying attention which is why they didnt' hit me.

So then it wasn't a problem.

>The guy was clearly not in the way but was a little close to the road.

Yes, and the car stopped because of that. It's a robot. It doesn't understand human intent, so it's going to stop when a person could potentially cross its path. This is the intended behavior.

If you don't like this, you can turn down EAB sensitivity. If you don't like any intervention at all, turn it off."
"This isn't phantom braking, this is emergency auto braking. This is the intended behavior. EAB is described in the manual, including how to change its sensitivity."
Where I live no one stands inches from the passing traffic. I dont see this getting ironed out anytime soon if you wish to have any margin of safety.
"Sounds like adaptive cruise control?

It shouldn’t be scary, if people left a proper space when following a car."
"Great show, too bad there's not more shows like that"
"Mine autobraked for a car trying to cut into my lane where the road narrowed. I was driving on manual and planned to go past him and slow down for the traffic in front letting him go behind me. A few meters before passing him AEB slammed on the brakes. Never stopped so fast in my life before. Didn’t leave him enough room to go ahead of me either. Tbh. a case of AEB calling it too late. Hogging the divider would have been a better call for a collision avoidance here, especially since he was crawling at walking pace. 

I attempted to override with my foot on the accelerator, but I didn’t push too hard since I had only about a carlength of buffer. My attempt at overriding was null and void."
"I've seen enough horror movies to know your car is seeing ghosts that you yourself can't see. Or maybe it's the stop sign thing, but that's a bit of a leap."
Maybe the sign is causing the radar to think there’s an obstacle in your lane
"Thoughts on an override button on the steering wheel? Where if you hit it, it immediately releases AEB?"
"Beeping doesn't mean AEB has engaged.

You have probably never experienced AEB."
"Yup, being rear-ended ain't fun."
"Lets remember what the alternative is though. Dealing with a body shop vs involuntary man slaughter. Tesla’s emergency braking is making the assumption: should the situation arise or even a close call, it’s better to have something hit the car, than the car hit a pedestrian. 

 Also noteworthy that in most states if you get rear ended, the driver who hit you is considered at-fault, in a majority of cases. 

So, if the Tesla is either going to be hit, or it hit a pedestrian, the Tesla is assuming it’s better to have your car take the hit, rather than potentially kill a person...and keep in mind, Tesla is still actively providing updates for enhancements, bug fixes and new features over the air in order to continuously improve for situations such as this."
"If enough automated cars were on the road that this would be a common problem, then it’s likely the car behind you has it’s own stop system. So then it’s not a problem."
">  I’m not arguing that it’s impossible it could save me from an accident, but in my estimation with the current sophistication of the technology it’s much more likely that it will make a critical mistake than that I will.

I’m pretty sure Tesla has stated that they only release features when they have a better safety record than people."
Your car is still damaged and you gotta deal with the process of having been in an accident.  The fault bit only matters when it comes to your record.
"Naturally, I doubt a software error counts as brake checking. Still would piss me off though if it happened."
"I don’t think it cares about car behind you, that’s their fault if they hit you anyway. Fallowing to close."
Maybe raise it with the company directly
"he wasn't already in the street, he was in the continuation of what would've been the sidewalk. but since it's the intersection to an old alley, the sidewalk isn't there.

that road itself is an alley...and not even passable by cars AFAIK other than garbage men.  people stand there to smoke often.  AI is an idiot if it doesn't realize that literally nobody ever crosses the street there... it's a 4-5 lane road and very busy. 

&#x200B;

OP lucky he didn't rear-ended really."
Not true. I got rear ended last week and am dealing with this now. Their insurance doesn't have to provide more than 30 days of rental coverage if the cause is lack of parts availability from Tesla. By law Tesla is supposed to have a ready supply of replacement parts available for a minimum period of 10 years from when the car was made. Tesla doesn't have a ready supply of almost anything...
"Just because the insurance pays it doesn't mean it's easy to deal with, You still have to go through the process of getting a car, then dealing with rental car issues for however long it takes, you have to arrange to get your car to and from the mechanic which means you'll need a friend/taxi to drop you off and/or pick you up. All the hassle is still your problem, the only thing that isn't is the dollars, which for someone driving a tesla that was never the issue in the first place."
"Here is some insider dish.....

in the self driving community (commercial systems, not academics) there is no way to audit the AI programming, this is complicating efforts to write public certifications for these systems.  Literally, you need the NHTS or equivalent body to inspect the code of all these different manufacturers to determine if they are working as planned.  But they cannot say that they are written to a certification, since it doesnt exist. 

There is no standard for how AI or emergency systems respond.  So the whole snarkiness about ""dont hit people software being common"" is as far from reality as it could be.

We as consumers can only assume its coded correctly, but we wont ever know.  The only time we know its working, is when its not killing people."
You'd think people were smart enough to pay attention... I want to control the things a machine does. Not the other way around. Imaging losing your child to bad software.. Jesus
">because you're in a 3000 lbs death machine and they're a bag of water and fragile bones.

You sir clearly are a poet of romance"
"> The car likely didn't ""slam on the brakes""

I'm going to assume that you didn't watch the video because you are at work or something"
"> The person wasn't on the sidewalk.

Tomayto, tomahto.

> And people don't drive like this because we're not idiot robots. That's the difference between us and software.

So you agree with me that this is not intended behavior..."
"I have never slammed on my brake, bringing my car to a full stop, because some pedestrian was looking in my direction, waiting for his ride or for an opportunity to jaywalk.

It's obvious that this guy was not going to jump in front of the car because he was standing still and he was looking at incoming traffic.

> Sitting on my couch watching this video, I wouldn't have stopped but i also can't pretend like it's entirely unreasonable that a system designed not to hit pedestrians would.

That's my point. This is a a false activation. The very opposite of ""intended behavior""."
Then the intended behavior sucks.
Actually I think you can only change the sensitivity of the forward collision warning and enable or disable AEB. I could be wrong though as I can't check the manual right now. Also you seem really unnecessarily defensive. I love Tesla too but the cars aren't perfect yet and I was simply sharing a situation that others may benefit from being aware of. I'm not some short here just trying to disparage Tesla. I'm a fan just like we all are!
Which is why I didn’t pay for fsd. Way too many real world situations like this that will make it too hard for software to handle reliably.
"No, it's emergency breaking. No AP. It misinterprets objects that might cross its path sometimes. 

And it is scary. It slams on the brake as you roll along, even when accelerating."
Balaam's tesla
"I think it'd add too much complication for something you should very rarely need, and usually only in a high pressure situation where you're not likely to remember it. The car will be done braking before you remember there's a button on the wheel to override it."
For some people ;)
"I agree with all of that in autopilot mode, but my car should never force me into a dangerous situation *and refuse to give me back control* while I’m in manual driving mode. I had assumed this feature only activate if it was certain you were about to have a collision in order to somewhat lessen the impact. My car makes mistakes in autopilot *constantly*, but I always have control to override it. The idea that it thinks you might be too close to a pedestrian who isn’t even in front of the car and then slams on the brakes *and* refuses a manual override is insane, and dangerous. It might be a good idea for whatever an “average” driver is, but for a *good* driver you’ve just made my car significantly more dangerous. It should be crystal clear what you’re getting into when you enable such a feature. I’m going to figure out how to turn it off asap."
"Yep, very valid points. The key will be refining the algorithm to decrease the false positives over time."
It’s not whether emergency braking should be there or not but decrease the # of false positives. Causing crashes IS a big issue
That’s a long way down the road.
"Than some people. If you’re a *good* driver than you’re way better than an “average” driver, and therefore may well be better than Tesla’s safety features and better with them turned off. Not saying that’s always the case, but with *this* feature, for me and many others, that’s definitely the case."
I think it SHOULD be a little bit slower to slam on the brakes if the nearest car is 10 feet back vs 200 feet back...  at 10 feet back you are just getting rammed into the pedestrian anyway
"I personally did, multiple times in the past."
"Interesting. I doubt it would be worth it but I wonder if a lawsuit would work, or if there really is some regulation concerning this."
"Fair points though I'm not sure I entirely agree with your last sentence. I bought model 3 as an alternative to a $20k sedan, not a luxury car. I don't plan on it costing me substantially more in the long term."
"That's not insider info, but instead a bunch of propaganda BS.

You can certainly audit AI and any other systems. You simply run it through a series of set tests and record the results. 

You can use this to compare to other systems. AI performance is typically measured in this way for the last 50 years.

Deep learning specifically will react identically for an identical set of inputs every single time (because math)."
But imagine in the future losing it to a human where the software would have saved it. Worse would be finding out that human was able to turn off that software.
"I'm going to guess _you_ didn't watch it, because what I saw was a person standing on the side of the road, looking like they were going to cross the road, and a car stopping.

The person behind had plenty time to stop, the car in the video stopped from a slow speed, in no way would I consider this ""slam on the brakes""."
"> So you agree with me that this is not intended behavior...

No. I do not. I'm telling you that the behavior of the computer is what we saw in the video, and that is the intended behavior. Again, the alternative being that the car can't stop in time and hits someone, or misjudges a person's intent and hits them. Ask Uber how good that is for PR, BTW."
"The car doing precisely what you would personally do is not the Litmus test for ""intended behavior."" There are billions of drivers in the world, and it would be impossible to write a software that can predict with certainty how a human would react. In fact, the entire point of an emergency braking system is to do something you are **not** doing. 

With that said, I'm splitting hairs here. You're not wrong in the sense that this video demonstrates a situation where the car is not doing what it should have done. My point was that because there is a break in the curb where that pedestrian was standing, the car interpreted the pedestrian as being in the street and so it stopped (IE: when you're driving down the street, you'll notice on the screen that your right-side lane visualization will ""widen"" when you're passing driveways and intersections where there's a break in the curb and there is no line marker). Intended behavior is to stop when there is a pedestrian in the street. From that perspective, EBS is doing the right thing here. 

What needs to improve in Tesla's software is its recognition of lanes when there is no painted line. This is an extremely tough nut to crack. It's a similar issue when you're on a highway and you pass an on-ramp in autopilot. Once that line disappears, the car perceives that its lane has gotten wider (temporarily of course) and it centers itself in the space it has. How do you teach a car to ignore this without creating problems in other situations? 

Again, you're right. It's not an easy fix, though, and the rare instance where this happens is offset by all the instances where this system has prevented actual accidents."
"That's a different conversation. But you should get used to this kind of behavior, because this is how autonomous vehicles are going to need to behave for the foreseeable future."
"Hah! This is one of the few times anybody here has ever called me overly defensive in favor of Tesla. /u/run-the-joules you catching this?? lol

I'm not defending the behavior. I'm telling you this is what you should expect, because this is what it was designed to do. The behavior you witnessed _is the intended behavior_. Stopping for a pedestrian that appears like they may think about walking in front of your car.

You may not like that behavior, and that's fine. I've disabled most of Tesla's warnings and emergency systems because I think they're awful. But that doesn't change the fact that the intent of the system is to be cautious when your metal machine is approaching a fragile person you can kill at incredibly low speeds."
"We have 120K miles in our Tesla’s and haven’t experienced emergency breaking freak out with a pedestrian or biker on the side. Weird.

Do you have your settings cracked up to paranoid?"
[deleted]
"That would definitely be some next level driving, humans rarely do this... of course, humans wouldn’t slam on the brakes for that guy standing on the side of the road. Hah"
I spoke with my state's insurance administration about this and they said I wasn't likely to win. There is nothing defined by law that says that insurance companies are responsible for Tesla not making parts readily available.
Why would you sue an insurance company for something that isn’t their fault?
you describe a performance test. not an audit.
An identical set of inputs in a semi controlled environment.. where in reality shadow offsets and sun inclination drastic change outcomes..
At least the person would be held accountable
"> I'm going to guess you didn't watch it, because what I saw was a person standing on the side of the road, looking like they were going to cross the road, and a car stopping.

Someone standing on the side of the road, looking for an opportunity to cross is not the same as someone crossing the road.

> in no way would I consider this ""slam on the brakes""

What would you call ""Slam on the brake""?

You can see from the vibration on the camera that the tire were losing traction. This is 100% braking power. You can't slam on the brake any more than what was depicted in the video.

Please tell me you are trolling."
"Then we must disagree on the meaning of ""intended behavior"". 

For me, it means the way the programmers at tesla wish the car was behaving. It's not very difficult to imagine what the programmers want. They want the car to brake (or not) when an attentive human driver would (or wouldn't) .

They are trying to minimize false positives and false negatives, and maximize true positives and true negatives.

This right here is a false positive, nobody in their right mind would do what the car did if they were at the wheel

They don't want the car to run over people (false negative), but they also don't want the car to stop on the highway because it saw a hitchhicker on the side of the road (false positive) and cause a fatal accident."
I wonder if there might have been some not-too-subtle tweaks to the emergency braking logic after whatever that thing was a few weeks back that basically said tesla's emergency braking for pedestrians is garbage.
"It's default settings, so you can make it more aggressive still I believe. It's probably a location thing, I mostly drive in a dense urban core with lots of cyclists and pedestrians. It also happened a handful of times, not like it's a weekly thing. But when it happens, it sucks ass. Never had that before in cars with AEB."
"I hear what you’re saying, but I am a cautious and observant driver. I am in essentially no danger of hitting a pedestrian, but apparently my car *is* in danger of stripping control from me and causing an accident. When *I’m* driving I want my car to behave like a car. Autopilot is a different story.

Worth noting though that I would applaud this same system if it only withheld control and slammed on the brakes when a pedestrian was definitely in front of the vehicle, but that clearly is not the case. I’ll be disabling it for the time being and checking back in 6 months to a year to see if the system is road ready."
"Not sure what insurance regulations would have to do with it. This is the liability of the other driver.

I hit you. I'm liable to you. I'm obligated to pay you, and as a result my insurance if obligated to pay me.

Now, we simply things by just filing the claim with the insurance company and they directly pay, but the actual liability is with the drivers. 

For collision coverage the rental coverage is usually part of the policy and is typically 30 days though you can probably pay a higher premium for more. In the case of liability the effective limit is whatever you can get a jury to award. Of course that is an expensive and lengthy process."
"You wouldn't sue the insurance company. You would sue the driver who hit you, and the insurance company would pay any awarded damages. 

You might also name Tesla in the suit in case the other party argues it is their fault."
"You can audit based on performance. If you want to determine ""why"" a decision was made in a DNN you can simply provide the inputs again and check the activations. Whether you understand it or not is a human limitation. Same with decision trees."
"Hence the need for comprehensive testing and statistical analysis of performance.

The aim is simply to bet better than existing systems and humans, there's no need to be ""perfect""."
">is not the same as someone crossing the road.

To a pedestrian safety system, there is no difference. _That's the whole point of this conversation_.

>You can see from the vibration on the camera that the tire were losing traction.

This is beyond dramatic. I see no such thing.

>This is 100% braking power.

100% braking power is around 1G. OP would know if the car stopped that hard, and the person behind would have hit them.

>You can't slam on the brake any more than what was depicted in the video.

Were you there? You're suddenly a video forensics expert? Seriously. Tell me you're being dramatic for effect."
">For me, it means the way the programmers at tesla wish the car was behaving.

And you're seeing it in this video.

>They are trying to minimize false positives and false negatives, and maximize true positives and true negatives.

And at some point you get to diminishing returns. So, you accept that there will be an increased rate of false positives and in exchange you'll reduce the number of false negatives and thereby not crash into a human being with a car. Which is the point of this system, ultimately. Just imagine this man was a toddler that randomly darted into the road. Would you prefer to stop early, or keep moving and hit the kid in the head with a car fender?

>nobody in their right mind would do what the car did if they were at the wheel

Computers don't have minds, they don't think, they don't intuit, so they can't predict crazy behavior that people often have. Like looking up from your phone and walking into the street- Something that happens hundreds of times a day on that very corner, I bet.

>but they also don't want the car to stop on the highway 

Which is entirely _not at all_ the situation we see here. We see a person posed at the side of the road, not on the sidewalk, standing like they're waiting to cross, standing farther into the road than all the other pedestrians in the scene. The safe conclusion is ""this idiot is going to walk out in front of me"". The car did the safe thing."
I thought they god pretty decent marks from the child and adult tests. Was I drunk?
"Washington DC and suburbs. Tons of runners and cyclists.

Never experienced this. Sounds scary.

Those other vehicles tracked pedestrian and bicycle paths and know if they’re in the road or sidewalk? Or just look for things in the road and hit the brakes."
[deleted]
"Insurance regulations define what insurance companies have to cover. Yes, I can sue the person in court, and I might get paid in 2 years if I am lucky, but the jury will peobably agree with the defense that they don't have to pay if Tesla refuses to provide parts in a reasonable timeframe.

Historically speaking, 30 days is enough to cover repairs with any other auto manufacturer."
"Again, how is this the other party’s fault in anyway (you’re going to have to prove this in court to have any chance)? If there insurance company provides appropriate resources and time to have your vehicle repaired and you fail to do so, that’s not on them. You can’t just sue anyone and everyone over anything (well you can, but you’ll just waste your time/money). 

Your best bet is to go to your own insurance and get them to cover the difference and they might be able to work something out with the other driver’s insurance."
"Well, I'm not a video forensics expert, I'm a programmer, but I do drive cars. I've had my fair share of close calls where I had to brake as fast as possible to avoid crashes and it looks exactly like this video.

You don't need to be a video forensics expert to recognize something that has happened to you multiple time in the past.

And by the way, that car was going at roughly 15 km/h to 20 km/h by the looks of it (probably closer to 15). At that speed, stopping distance should be between 1 and 2 meters, and that's what we see in the video.
It went from 15-20 km/h to 0 km/h in roughly 0.5s.
Little bit of math says that 8.33 m/s^2 to 11.1 m/s^2 (0.849 g to 1.13 g)

So yeah... that suggest the car was using 100% braking power. And you can't brake more than 100% so... there was really nothing dramatic about my description."
"> And you're seeing it in this video.

You are aware that sometime, software does not work as intended by the programmer, right? Just because autopilot sometime likes to swerve into incoming traffic does not mean that the programmer intended that to happen.

> Just imagine this man was a toddler that randomly darted into the road.

Which is entirely not at all the situation we see here. We see a person posed at the side of the road, standing like they're waiting to cross.

> Computers don't have minds, they don't think, they don't intuit, so they can't predict crazy behavior that people often have

Deep neural network are actually really good at predicting complex behavior and they make decision that are more akin to intuition rather than simple if/else statements. What openAI and deepmind have managed to achieve with go and starcraft is really impressive.

> The car did the safe thing

The safest thing a driver can do, beside following the rule of the road, is to be predictable. So lets agree to disagree."
"Honestly I didn't read any of it, no idea."
"Mostly things on the side of the road, which is pretty frequent in cities. Lots of people that wait for traffic to pass to jaywalk. 

The stopped cyclist though, was weird. It was a dedicated bike line, coming from an alley between two buildings. They have traffic lights, and he was stopped.

And yeah, def scary :)"
Good points all. Thanks for your perspective. I appreciate it.
"> Insurance regulations define what insurance companies have to cover. 

Sure, in terms of minimum coverage, but the insurance doesn't actually cover the victim of an accident, but their own insured.

> Yes, I can sue the person in court, and I might get paid in 2 years if I am lucky

Hence the reason that I did say, ""I doubt it would be worth it.""

> the jury will peobably agree with the defense that they don't have to pay if Tesla refuses to provide parts in a reasonable timeframe.

You probably would need to name Tesla in the lawsuit to avoid this situation.  Then Tesla and the other driver would basically be fighting over this point.  Of course you would still be waiting years to get paid."
"> how is this the other party’s fault in anyway

I don't think I claimed it was.  I merely said, ""I wonder if a lawsuit would work.""  I still do.

You might need to sue Tesla as well, since the court might find that they are at fault for not providing parts in a timely manner.

> well you can, but you’ll just waste your time/money

I agree, and hence the reason I said, ""I doubt it would be worth it."""
"> more akin to intuition

No they absolutely are not at all. Just because it seems like magic to you doesn't make it magic. They're probability machines. That's it.

>What openAI and deepmind have managed to achieve with go and starcraft is really impressive.

And have absolutely zero to do with what we see here.

>The safest thing a driver can do, beside following the rule of the road, is to be predictable.

Use that defense in court when you run someone down. ""Your honor! I didn't want to be unpredictable to the person behind me!"""
"K, you are hopeless. You will never see reason no matter what. I dont even know why I bothered. Have a good night"

Why use many letter when few letter do trick?
Took the E and U out of it. Must not be available in the European Union...
Wait so they’re actually calling it the cyber truck?
Please bring us the CYBRVN soon.
Yeah this design is gonna be super controversial. I hope Tesla knows what it’s doing.
"Didn’t Franz van Holzhausen say in the Ride the Lightning Podcast that he is glad that Tesla doesn’t really have a “set design language”. I mean everything from the S, 3, X, Y, Semi, Roadster 2 speaks a similar design language imo and with this logo I think the cybertruck might be the first one to escape that and look completely different, as if from a different brand even. That’s why it’ll be very interesting to see how it will turn out and how it’ll be received."
My model 3 is getting nervous about being traded in..
"Each individual letter looks like a puzzle piece to a truck. The letter “C” for example looks like the bed of a truck. What if these letters are the outline of the truck, and it’s right in front of us? 

Edit: If I’m right, can anyone spare an invite to the event? My brother and I are planning to attend the event, traveling 950+ miles even if we have to stand outside the unveiling.

Edit!2: Thank you kind Redditor for the recognition and gold!! My first ever, and on my cake day none the less! Truly appreciate the award!! I will be taking tons of pictures outside the event when I’m there for everyone!"
"Pat, I’d like to buy a vowel."
"I guess this is an unpopular opinion?

I dig it. 

I think I'm the market for this truck. Not because I want a truck, but because I really dig sci-fi and things that make it feel like the future."
"I’m surprised to see people aren’t a fan. It’s certainly different but if Tesla is doing a pickup, why shouldn’t they do things differently."
Is that a known or existing font?
"I thought that was some code name or something, not the actual name. Is it an unpopular opinion to say it sounds stupid?"
I like it!
Definitely getting de-badged if thats how the name looks.
"God damn that's terrible. If you're making a fancy font, at least make it better than ""barely legible""."
Can't say I'm a fan of that...

I can barely fucking read that.
"A multi billion dollar company that can afford to hire good designers, and they go with this?"
"I'm definitely not in the target group for a truck in general, but I have to say name, the skipping letters and the logo in general really does not speak to me... Especially the 'K' just looks weird..."
I wonder if the letters could form a possible outline of the truck if aligned a certain way. The K sort of looks like a ramp to me
"Im guessing something like [this](https://imgur.com/mhBa4Vr) will be the logo.  That ""K"" has to be mangled to make the front of the truck"
Incredibly excited for this.... but what an awful logo.

Actually pretty accurate on a always internet connected truck..

cybertruck gonna look great and add 30 to stock price
Which way and I supposed to rotate my monitor to read it? I can't seem to find the right-side-up.
"Pretty fuckin' dope, IMO."
Why did the K fall over?
Were purchasing no matter how it looks. This is my wifes next vehicle..trading in her 2019 model 3 for it.
"Well, they were gonna name it the Model T but . . ."
Keep going..almost there
Fuck that's sexy and now I want it even more.
To bad they finally announced this today. Today was the last day I could set up vacation till January due to peak (FedEx Express).
I'm waiting on Y... No now I might have to wait for the truck...
"Ok I think cybertruck is my 20th birthday present from Elon cause it's being announced on my birthday. Even if I will probably never have a chance to have one, I think it is the coolest thing ever."
LOVE IT! \*ORDERS\*
"Cyber, the new Nano."
I think you mean CYBRTRK
I’m worried he will go too far with the future theme. Regardless I’m all in on his stock and in Tesla.
Is there a TTF font with that design? I love it.
"This man child really named the truck ""CYBRTRK"" and I love every second of this"
"Damn.  I was hoping it would be named ""Beast"".  Then we'd have S3XY BEAST."
Awesome! I hate it.
"Without context, this doesn't look like Roman alphabet at all"
[removed]
I told my dad they should make one for his old ass called “fybrtrk” 😂
I am expecting by this fucking truck. It better not disappoint. The hype at least for us Tesla geeks is crazy.
Uhhhm...
#God no
Thats like...really bad
The name and shortening of the name to just CYBRTRK is perfectly fine (though it looks russian imo). The style/font or whatever is total trash.
So now it's S3XY Roadster Semi Cybrtrk?
That logo is hideous. Here's hoping the truck itself doesn't look as awful.
Is the truck supposed to be Japanese?
"First look: Damn that's ugly!

Fifth look: I guess it's not that bad. Still kinda bad."
In LA even.
"> Remember guys this is the person who put a car in a spaceship and launched it into orbit.

"Although he's voiced concerns about AI, I would not be surprised at all if Elon Musk creates the first replicant"
I'm gonna laugh so hard if they reveal what looks to be almost exactly like a Dodge Ram.
Even Elon Musk is going full Blade Runner vibe by creating a plutocratic society!
">I guarantee it's going to be something very, very futuristic and awesome.

Do you think it will have a HUD?"
"Elon teased that the model 3 would look like a spaceship, so I'll temper my expectations."
Time to get that custom plate registered
So wait. Could someone make an electric pickup truck and call it the Cybertruck?

"Vowels are extremely expensive, and if this is one place where Tesla can cut back on expenses, I support it.

I wonder if that decision was only recently made after Elon Tweeted it out? I like it; automatically puts it kind of in line with the Raptor.

Probably won’t need a van if you have a cyber truck
You may need to get a cybrtrk and put a cybrcnpy over the tray
I think/hope that the cyber “truck” is a bit van-like
What would a van have that the truck doesn't? Isn't there truck rumored to look more like an APC? So the bed is potentially covered.
Ohyesplease. It's almost not worth spending time and effort converting a sprinter van when Tesla can be releasing one within the next 3 years.
Not gonna happen Elon hates them
"I think it's going to be different, sure, but way less controversial than people think. It'll be as ""shocking"" as a Model 3 looks compared to a Civic.  

If I had to guess, I think this Chinese company's rip off attempt is probably closest to what it will look like:  https://electrek.co/2019/11/13/tesla-semi-chinese-clone-cybertruck-electric-pickup/"
They definitely do. It might be the type of vehicle people eventually warm up to if it's really out there. I have talked to people who said they don't care what it looks like and want a Tesla truck. It's going to be really interesting
I just keep picturing another sonic the hedgehog moment
"People buy the Jeep truck, so I'm sure the Cybertruck will be fine..."
The Tesla truck is gonna be the first thing Tesla made that is going to have to be marketed to people that don’t give two shits about electric cars.  Will be interesting to see.
"Here's the thing about car designs, especially from enthusiasts. Unless it's a real stunner everyone will hate it at first then a month or 2 later everyone will love it and then the redesign comes out and ""the old one is so much better"" and the cycle repeats"
"Let's face it, the Rivian truck is boring AF.  This truck needs to be different, not just a rounded-corner, weird-headlight electric version of a standard pickup."
"EM has said before it won't be for everyone. Maybe they figure they are too busy with production at the moment and would rather have a more exotic and expensive truck that won't sell as many as the more standard, popular work truck that could be coming later?"
Didn’t he say he doesn’t really care if it doesn’t sell well?
"It can look like a turnip.

But, if it’s functionality makes it superior to having any other truck on a job site, it will be a success."
No boring cars. I'm all for Tesla doing something different.
"I really doubt it’ll be too out there. Their designs so far have been fairly conventional and they can’t afford to risk releasing a flop especially with the press this is generating. While I‘d prefer a design on the crazy side, I think it’ll end up like a sleeker version of the R1T."
"I think it will ultimately be fine. Anyone who is already anti-EV or anti-Tesla already isn't going to get a CybrTrk regardless of how it looks. Anyone who is open and interested is *more likely*, though not guaranteed) to be into it and pull the trigger. The adverse reactions will more than likely come from the usual suspects more than they will people who are on the fence i think."
"I think that after playing it safe with the S, X (sorta), 3 and Y - they'll have the cash and the revenue to try something a bit different.

It might have been a comment here, but I think someone said that they're not trying to compete with the F150 (as in target existing owners), but they're going to grow a new group of truck owners who will, by all measurements, have a vastly superior truck."
"We’ve seen 5 Tesla designed cars: Model S, Model X, Model 3, Semi, and 2020 Roadster. All look amazing. Tesla has capable designers. 

One thing I don’t think people consider enough is that almost all trucks (Chevy, Ford, Dodge) look the EXACT SAME. If Tesla puts out a radical but cool design it will force people to take a look at the specs (which will undoubtedly be impressive compared to ICE) and then they get buyers."
It could be a sort of Halo product. Aimed at brand awareness rather than sales.
"Yeah, it could easily become the Segway of the pickup truck world if they are not careful.  TBH- I think this is going to be a very expensive mistake."
"That's interesting he said that. It kind of makes sense too because i know Tesla isn't doing ""Model _"" for their naming anymore. So it would also make sense for a design language shift to somewhat go along with a product naming scheme shift."
The only design language Elon follows is Physics driven.    Thus.. Vehicles will be Aerodynamic & low center of gravity.

My Tacoma just peed on herself
My wallet is getting nervous about used Model 3 prices coming down...
I will give it a good home.
I’ll take it off your hands
"At first I thought I'd be nuts to trade a model 3 for a truck... They're so inefficient and I drive 75 miles a day.

But then I realized there's kinda no reason to not drive the truck. So it might get 85MPGe but that's really no different from when I was daily driving the X. I think I'll put money down on announcement and then I'll have a couple of years to decide."
Mine wants a friend.
I can't wait for the influx of used Model 3s. I might buy two.
I'm assuming it's going to be 3-5X the price of base model 3

I'm in the same boat as you. Except I also want a truck. I just am totally on board with it being a crazy sci-fi truck.
Same. I think they all look the same. Anything that looks like Mark Watney’s Mars Rover is fine by me.
I have a brand new 2019 Ram 1500. I might still be in the market for this truck.
It’s always the popular opinion to love anything tesla does in this sub lol
Because every electric car before Tesla went for “Futuristic SciFi Car” look in their electric vehicles and no one liked them. Tesla was super successful in part because they created a normal looking beautiful sedan that just happened to be electric.
[deleted]
The #1 reason I love Tesla is that they managed to make an electric car that didn’t look like some overstylized futuristic concept vehicle.  It just looks like a great looking car.  I really hope the truck actually looks like a truck.
Because they are concerned with making stuff people actually like.

I can't wait to hang truck nuts from one!
Nah man. It needs more edge. I need to bleed just by being near one.
Yeah... I hate it.  This logo and all the blade runner talk worries me.  Tesla built their success on the fact that they sell compelling electric cars without the weird styling of EVs past.  No one who buys an F150 wants some futuristic thing that doesn’t look like a truck.
"Well, if you buy one, you can debadge it and call it Susan with your own logo design."

"Yes they have, multiple sightings on twitter."
"With a short front, the CYBRTRK could have a larger interior than the Model X (giving the ability to seat 7-9) and a 5.5’ bed.  Fold down the third row and open the rear door to make an 8’ bed."

We'll let you think about that one a bit while you Ford a river.
Ford would not be cool with that.  Elon wanted Model 3 to be called Model E and Ford were not cool with that.  Ford are not cool.

Prison licker-r?
A sprinter van is significantly different than a pickup truck (although both could be built off the same chassis)
Haha yep. Precisely why I don't like trucks - they rely on aftermarket accessories in order to provide utility for most applications.
"A pass through the the cargo space. Secure cargo - eliminating the need to buy a bunch of aftermarket accessories. Climate controlled cargo area. Sleeping/living space/mobile workshop. Room for additional toes of seating if needed. The list goes on. 

Trucks look cool, but as more and more people are finally realizing, a van provides far more utility and practicality."
"I'm in this boat. I want to build an adventure van, but investing in a 15 mpg van seems very shortsighted in 2019."
"Don't confuse minivans with commercial vans (such as the Mercedes Sprinter or Ford Transit Van), or even the ability to sell the pickup chassis for customization (for any number of utility vehicles).  These are important commercial markets, which would dovetail nicely with the Semi business as well (for the shipping and delivery industry)"
"Yep, the Chinese are so good at ripping off designs, they are now ripping off designs that don’t even exits yet."
That truck doesnt look half bad. I’d be down if the tesla looks slightly similar
I could live with this: [https://electrek.co/2019/11/13/tesla-semi-chinese-clone-cybertruck-electric-pickup/#jp-carousel-110274](https://electrek.co/2019/11/13/tesla-semi-chinese-clone-cybertruck-electric-pickup/#jp-carousel-110274)
"I dunno, [this thing looks pretty mean](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EJXT5iYXYAUF-9O?format=jpg&name=large) compared to that one, which I think looks like a ""Futuristic F150"" Ford would have built in 1999 as a concept car for 2020."
"I still think it will look more blade runner-ish .. like this [https://www.amazon.es/Police-Plastic-Model-Fujimi-JAPAN/dp/B007OSZR3G](https://www.amazon.es/Police-Plastic-Model-Fujimi-JAPAN/dp/B007OSZR3G)  
The rear part would have the bed and of course less nonsensical attachments on the side .. but the design language could totally look like that, IMO"
"If the pickup actually turns out to look like that, that wouldn't be terrible. That's a pretty fresh design"
"The Chinese copy everything. Do they have no brains for originality? They're good at copying stuff but not innovating anything.

I hope tesla crushes these cheap copycats."
They don’t care until they see it. I guarantee they’ll care if the sight of it makes them cringe.
The thing is Franz had nothing to do with the design. So we will see.
"You haven’t even begun to see active hate like keying and coal rolling until Tesla has a truck. So far Tesla’s are puny cars for pussies(tm) but invade their space directly, with a better vehicle, and it’s on, baby, it’s on."
That would be me.
Everybody thought they'd hate the Model 3 interior too.
"Not too sure. A lot of people don't like the Model X falcon doors because they are too ""flashy"""
"I care what it looks like, but I don’t care if it looks like a regular truck. I’ve always loved crazy futuristic concept cars and they never leave the concept stage. I trust Tesla’s design choices, I know they’re not gonna make a hideous blob or a refrigerator box so I’m all in."
Oh god please no

"I'm in a very truck heavy area of California. You can drive em on the beach here and it's a heavy agricultural area.

"People buy it because it’s the only interesting truck on the market. I know it’s weak and useless as a truck. But some people just want a truck and at the end of the day Ram 1500, F-150, and Chevy have all looked identical for decades. At least Jeep made a unique looking vehicle that stands out."
[deleted]
"This is why I'm surprised they're going the cybertruck way. When I first heard about their truck I thought that even people who don't like Tesla will be tempted just by the specs and functionality, but with this cybertruck way that they're going I feel like that won't happen"
"Yeah probably. This could be the Model X to the Model Y, or the Model S to the Model 3... Although they're hitting the market at an already low price. Maybe all the extras will bring it up high."
"I feel like this is going to be like the X. Where they’ll go all out to test what works and what doesn’t in a product.
The X was made to fill a gap between the S and the developpement of the 3.   They went all in with all they could think.   Then they knew what not to do for the 3/Y."
Can you link somewhere he’s said this? I was under the impression this was meant to be a truck to compete with the f150 aka extremely popular
Why would he say that
"I don’t see any reason for that to be true. Everyone has taste and if someone doesn’t like the design they aren’t going to buy it, even if they didn’t already hate Tesla. In fact I think the people on the fence are the ones Tesla should be trying to win over the hardest, and a crazy unproven design isn’t the best way to do that, or most reliable I should say"
"Ok, arguing a bit with myself here. If this thing is fast and super powerful and capable as a truck, it might appeal to the power hungry truck driver types."
"They need to break the pattern. They're TESLA. They are now in the spot where they need to build vehicles that are far better than what is being made.

It's a brilliant move - just create a vehicle that looks like it's fresh out of a sci-fi movie - totally and utterly doable - and people will want the shit out of it. There's no need to pussyfoot to make things bland and palatable around if you have a great design."

This thread started out pretty negative on it.
"To be fair, there's ""cool"" sci-fi and ""just fuck this shit up"" sci-fi. Here's hoping Tesla achieves the former."
Most electric cars get made fun of not for being wacky but for just looking like someone tried to make a golf cart you could drive to work.
"Yeahhh, but having established that they can play the ""normal"" game, why shouldnt they have a little (more) fun with it?"
"They still look different to usual ICE car designs though, they just look good doing it. I think Tesla will have a similar effect with the truck."
"boring. the word you're looking for is boring. the Aston martin DB3 or Vanquish are elegant, or the '59 ferrari 250, or even the Tesla Roadster are elegant. the S, X and 3 look like they hit the average button on all the other cars in their class. trucks rarely look elegant, so why be boring and force it to look like an ICE truck? I want them to do some crazy aero version of the Unimog or something."
Actually not. Elon even said so. They make things they would like. They can only hope consumers like what they like. A whole new way of developing products.
Comic Sans
Thought it was comic sans
[The dreams came back.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhlJNJopOQ)
"If Tesla created some DBA structure to manufacture cybrtrks as Tyrell Motors, I would legitimately pay extra for that branding."
And we shall welcome it.
"I don't mind the word Cybertruck, it's pretty neat. Just this particular styling... oh well personal taste I guess"
"Knowing Elon, I'm sure we're in for a low-key joke or two around this at some point. Maybe even merch."
I put on my robe and wizard hat.
I sold all my vowels to get enough for a reservation deposit.
Username checks out :)
Is he using Emissions Testing Mode?
"I really hope you are right but tradesmen here don’t buy pickup trucks based solely on practicality, at least where I live. They are just as fashion conscious as the next person, it’s just that the fashion is about power, ruggedness, size, masculinity and speed.

If the truck gives of a geeky sci-fi feel I can see that completely turning off a large segment of the market - no matter how good the truck is. Tesla are already on thin ice with this demographic as many don’t believe in global warming to start with and think the brand is for yuppies. ICEing is a political statement. It’s going to be tough turning that demographic around,"
Wire nuts.
It's the only way they could get truck drivers to stop losing their charging adapters...
"No, but I do."
"Not sure I agree.

Falcon wing doors and massive center screens are weird styling.

Tesla built their success on, to borrow a phrase, thinking differently. 

The F-150 and a million derivatives already exist. They won't be able to make these in F-150 numbers for a while, so why not make something bonkers?"
"I drive a GMC Sierra and will want one. I don’t care about looks, specs matter."
"To be fair they likely don't have the battery capacity to sell that many with everything they are doing. They probably switch to a more popular redesign when battery capacity can keep up. Remember when the Y comes out they will double their total current sales. It's very likely they want to dip their toes in the truck market just to force Ford/Gm to up their game.

That would gives us 2 mass market cars, 1 industrial semi, and 4 edge case cars/trucks. I do hope they explain why they went this route in an official manner though."
"Uh oh, that's incumbent disrupted company speak"
Tesla built their success on legitimately cool vehicles that function well as daily drivers while doing things no one else has before. Not by selling golf carts with weatherproofing and a 20 mile range which is why people didn't like electric before.
I'm so hoping it's this. A family truck. The best of a truck and SUV combined.
"Ford hasn’t used it in 100 years, it’s probably lost its copyright on it."
CHARLIEEEEE
What is this from?
"Those look like big tires. Fuck yeah.

I was worried it wouldn't be a ""truck"" with big tires and able to go off-road but that thing looks like it will have plenty of ground clearance. 

I'm so excited."
"r/fakealbumcovers material right there...

unless elon drops another single...

God this a fucking weird timeline."
laser headlights?
"Ooo looks like laser phosphorescent headlights, those things are suuupet accurate at lighting up exactly what you want and nothing else. No more annoying Truck headlights in the rear view"

"Maybe you're in the ""Escape from LA"" LA..."
"yes but you have to leave the gravity well of the Earth to be orbiting the sun on your own.

It takes significant delta V to get away from the earth and have an orbit that won't impact another object or depend on another object to keep it's orbit stable.

That car is currently orbiting the sun far enough away from anything else larger than a banana that it can be tracked as an independent object with the Sun as it's primary influence.

But if you were just going for a Zen state of mind, yep the Earth, the Moon, you, and I and anything else laying around here is orbiting the sun."
My car is orbiting the sun as well.
"It was sent on an elliptical orbit that goes as far out as where Mars orbits. However, it's not synced up with Mars so when it gets there, Mars isn't there."
"it had an orbit that sometimes brings it close to mars and sometimes brings it close to earth. Shortly after launch it was ""heading towards mars"" but it was never going to stop there.

"> Already taken in Texas.

Well I think we can conclude that they are going to sale at least 5 of these trucks."

It’s 50% more letter per letter
"Because they are much rarer than consonants, duh. Out of 26 letters in the English alphabet, only five are pure vowels (yes, yes, and sometimes 'y'). When you consider that we use vowels in actual words at a much higher proportion than they are found in the alphabet, one is always running short of vowels, which then leads to having to buy an entire set of 26 letters just to get a set of 5 vowels, which substantially raises the cost per vowel.

In some places, like Bosnia and Croatia, they are so short of vowels that it once reached a crisis level, prompting [plaintive pleas for vowels](https://www.croatiadraga.com/home/2018/6/10/hello-from-croatiaplease-send-vowels) and [President Bill Clinton to deploy an emergency shipment of vowels to Bosnia](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/humor/clinton-deploys-vowels.html)."
"Your truck reservation just got delayed, again."

"""Tesla can't afford to place additional letters to name its own vaporware truck"" \~ Business Insider"
Lol 😆
A 10 passenger van with removable back seats would be pretty awesome.
"What strange reasoning.  The whole benefit of buying a truck chassis is so you can customize it, but if you just buy a pickup truck it's still super functional without buying anything."
Great points
Industrial espionage is a thing.
"I hope not.  Id rather have it look like this,  [https://electrek.co/2019/04/24/tesla-pickup-truck-render/](https://electrek.co/2019/04/24/tesla-pickup-truck-render/) , then the chinese one. I want it to look mean and fierce not something that looks...i dunno intangible (if that is the right word) like the Chinese mockups look like. 

That being said, the car lineups are known to be minimalistic so maybe the truck follows suit."
God that's a dumb article to get a few clicks. The designs aren't even close.
I think the ACTUAL design has been staring us in the face for a while now: https://i.imgur.com/ClF5toI.png
"I guess that just screams different for the sake of being different, without offering any practical reasons for all the wasted space up front. That said, [armored personal carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_96_Armored_Personnel_Carrier) do generally have a dramatic sloping front end, so definitely could be it. Tesla is generally really good about form following function, so it will be fascinating to see how the design benefits the vehicle."
"> The Chinese copy everything. Do they have no brains for originality? 

People said the same thing about Japan before they surpassed the US technologically. Don't underestimate China. Copying is simply the fastest way to catch up. It says nothing about their ability for originality."
"When the Model S first came out with no front grill, people thought it was ugly too, and that’s with a nose cone!

Today people look at the nose cone and think it’s “dated” and the smooth look of the front is beautiful.

I have a feeling the cyber truck will be the same. I will bet you my next 20 paychecks that the news (and a lot of others) will shit on the looks, but in 5 years from now people will look back and think the cyber truck is the natural progression of truck design."
"Especially if they want to take over the F150 market. 

That market is filled with people stuck with their traditions. Very conservative folk. They won't go with some ridiculous future shit."
I thought I'd buy a usdm Civic type-r until I saw it.
"If it is stupid I'm not interested. But if it's a Mars Rover looking thing or anything cool looking I'm down, even if it was a regular truck I'd be down. Only thing I won't be interested in is something that stands out as just plain ugly design. 

My work pays for my truck (I still own it) and it gets a lot of miles so I'm more than ready."
"i dunno man.  I am not a car person.  I have never really cared what my car looked like.  It was transportation from point A to point B.  I do care about the experience when driving.  I care about the comfort.  And a Tesla Truck is about the only thing that would get me to trade in my model 3.  

So yeah, I personally don't give a shit how it looks as long as the specs are on point and it can actually fulfil the abilities of a truck"
"Nah, I want to tow an F150 up hill in a tug of war match. Take that coal rollers."
"The less conventional it is, the more I want it."
Source?
"…but with less doors;  
…and the top light sources under the glass (smoothly integrated).  And orange."
"Small bed, shitty power.

It's a truck for jeep girls/guys not truck dudes."
I've seen at least 10 in a month here in PA
Same.
"There's going to be plenty of EV pickups with a traditional look on the market, Tesla has to come up with it's own distinctive design.  Whether that works for them or not, who knows yet."

"Because he said it was mostly a fun project. If his fun project sells then great, if it doesn’t it’s not a big deal"
"It may not be the most reliable way to win them over, but if it does, it will be more successful and win more of them over than if they win just some of them over with a safe/boring design. They're going for high risk high reward. I don't think an unproven design will actually be that much of a deterrent for people long as the specs deliver. I also think there's a huge difference between a design that's different/new and a design that's just *ugly*. I think the truck will be very very different and people will have knee jerk reactions that eventually will warm up to it, I do not think it will be unwaveringly ugly to the point that people are permanently turned off by it."
"Also, it will (probably) perform like it's from the future with features no other truck has."

happy cake day!
Soooo.....wacky?
Truck target demographic doesn't like having fun with the design of their truck. They buy the same truck line over and over in the same color.
"Idk. I still think the X and 3 are stunning irl, far from average. They only look boring in pictures."
Not really.  That's pretty much how Steve Jobs operated at Apple.  No focus groups.  Just making things he liked.
Wing dings
We don't know yet if its just  styling trademark or badging on the truck will be the same

Right but this wasn't planned to be a mass adoption high production vehicle. They basically said from the start it'll be polarizing and may not be widely accepted but that they wanted to do something totally unique and new. Then in the future they can do a more traditional truck if this fails to win over the market.
I recently traded my F150 for a 2019 F250 king ranch. Did I buy that trim for practicality? Nope. But if it looks anything like a truck I will definitely be trading in the truck for the cyber truck if it can take a gooseneck hitch. A lot cheaper than paying for diesel and oil changes a month. Especially considering I drive 1200 miles a week. (Am a land developer/home builder)
"A lot of that segment does a serious amount of military-worshiping.  I bet if that Air Force talk turns into a sales contract, it'll turn some minds."
"I don't think it will look geeky just because it's going to look like a rover. I think plenty of people that own trucks would love a large electric vehicle. A beefy truck with 6-700 lbft will turn heads in the truck crowd. 

I want one and I have a lifted Tacoma."
">F-150 and a million derivatives already exist

Agreed.  Nissan Titan was and is a good truck but doesn't sell all that well 'cause it's just another truck which lots of people never even consider when shopping Ford/Chevy/~~Dodge~~Ram.

Something genuinely different will sell well.  And, even though it's a bit contradictory, I know plenty of people that want a truck but don't want the bad fuel economy."
Yep.  Time to make a halo product that actually makes people rethink what is possible in automotive design.  GO BIG OR GO HOME TIME.
"I forgot to say:  and still be the same size as other 1.5 ton trucks so it still fits in most garages.

It could really be the best of both worlds!"
"Ford renewed its trademark on Model T in 2017.

As someone who was in an OHV park today - I concur. I'm really worried it will be shaped like a truck but just be a luxury car. I'm hoping it will actually be truck-y enough to get shit done.
Looks like laser headlights.

Imagine all those fewer letters times how many trucks they will be selling?  Makes a big difference! 😀
haha I wouldn't be surprised if we see such a headline.
"Unless you need to side load materials from up high, when is a truck more practical than a cargo van? This has always puzzled me.  Vans can be customized to - but in stock form they appear to offer far more utility."
Hardly need industrial espionage to design a pickup truck.
"To each their own, I hope the actual thing looks better than both those designs, because I'm not really big fans of either."
That shit will get Sonic levels of reaction.
shorter and smaller bed and it might be that imo.
"Yeap, my bets are on this one, looks heavy duty while still looking futuristic. The Chinese knock off from that electrek article close second."
"Yeah totally possible. And while we Tesla nerds don't feel that design to be outlandishly weird (knowing the semi design) for the regular F150 Joe it might perfectly be a ""holy shit what's that?!"" moment"
"The wasted space could be beneficial for the drag coefficient, though. Which trucks usually don't excel in."
"Did they though? I don't believe Japan blatantly copied the US IP.

They studied it and made their own better versions. Not cheap knockoffs.

Japan earned their place with study and make superior innovations in automotive and technology fields.

China just copies the IP by theft and forcible takeover or espionage and makes cheap knockoffs with forced manual and child labor, displacing people for factories and polluting the planet. That's a menace."
"Which article do you think will generate more clicks:

1. Tesla's new truck looks like its from the future!
2. This big ugly mistake may bankrupt Tesla!"
The joke is on us. In five years those checks will either be cashed or void. DON'T FALL FOR IT!
"It is, I mean a lot of people are pointing at the Rivian saying “yeah why cant electric pick ups and Tesla truck renders be more like this”, totally ignoring the fact IT DOESN’T *NEED* A BONNET. There’s no point having a big box hanging of the front like an f150 because there’s no engine in there. All you’re doing is killing driver visibility which is what you dont want when you’re driving where there are no roads. You delete the box on the front, switch centre of gravity to low beneath the truck and now you can take all the hood space and add it to the flatbed area. Practical doubles it. That’s why the original Tesla renders all showed crazy things like the Tesla truck bed being able to *carry* another truck. Accessibility to the deep end of the bed is a question but I’m sure they’ll solve it. More space is more space, people can carry longer lumber, none of the cargo space is limited by having to fit under the hood like the Rivian etc. I think the only reason Rivian and others have gone for a traditional truck layout is that they didn’t have enough reputation to break out of the established way and risk looking ‘weird’, but in future generations, Teslas “front all glass and bull bars-back all bed and storage” config will become the standard. Cybertruck will for sure make changes to what others will do in time"
nobody thought the model S was ugly when it came out though... 🤔
"This is admittedly arguable, but: I'd say those traditionalists would be just as (if not more) deterred by the electric drivetrain.

So to a certain extent, why not be a little ""out there""? They're mainly going to be getting early adopters anyway. Plenty of time to come up with a traditional design later, after the initial splash has been made."
"I doubt many conservative folk will be early adopters of any electric truck, regardless of what it looks like. They will have to be pushed and pulled into an electric truck purchase."
"Maybe the ridiculous future shit will seem way more manly, like when the Hummer became popular, just some crazy looking truck from Aliens that out powers and out runs the F150 crowd. Well, I can dream can't I?"
"I live in the deep South and this is not true. People in the south like Lambos and Bugatti’s. But they can’t get them and they need a truck so they get the coolest baddest truck they can afford. Right now all the trucks look the same. If Tesla comes with a radical but still functional design people will pay attention and take a look at the specs, which will blow ICE away."
"If it excels in being the best truck by far to have on the job, it will succeed."
"Meh, I've owned 2 F150s and one is still my daily driver. I would love it if Tesla's ended up looking amazing but not kinda dorky like the Honda Ridgeline for instance. I really like the look of the Rivian truck for instance, the front is just [beautiful to me](https://rivian.com/r1t/)"
I guarantee you that as soon as they see a genuinely cool looking new truck they will suddenly fidnd themselves not giving a shit about traditions anymore.
"Ford is coming out with an EV truck as well, Tesla would be well served to have a distinctive look.  I doubt it will be ugly, and have high hopes that Tesla pushes function/innovation."
That’s probably why rednecks have responded alot better to the Bollinger B1 and B2 than the Cybertruck
"I don't think I've ever heard anyone say ""I'm interested in a plain ugly design for my next vehicle."""
"I won't buy it if it's more expensive than a Model Y (which will meet my needs as would a Model 3) but I like your attitude and I say go for it if you need it's capabilities.

edit: someone downvoted me because my mention of price. I'm not in the target market for that vehicle. I was just describing my internal logic.

I'm fine with a Model 3, Model S, Model Y, or CYBRTRK which ever I can get the cheapest. Used or new.

I just wanted to let Aristeid3s know I agree with his attitude about the looks vs functionality without implying I'd be getting one."
My wife is not a car person but she definitely won't let me buy a car if she thinks it's ugly.
Yeah because you're a Tesla fan. Tesla truck is supposed to replace the trucks current truck owners use. Not be a cute upgrade for Tesla fans.
"Very few people do not care about the looks of a car, like at all. You probably care a bit about that too. Of course you would anyways. 

What will help tesla (if the design is ugly, and I don't think that) is that currently they are the only EV truck, so there's nothing ""better""."

Yep.  I have a buddy whose family owns a Ford dealership.  He said his business is basically 100% sustained from the same handful of customers coming in every 2 years and just cutting a check for the newest Ford F-150 without even driving it first.
Sure hope it’s not the badging on the truck.

China does not consider any human right laws.
They're kinda sorta working to fix that or they will continue to be passed over by big companies for their manufacturing. This is part of why Tesla was able to enter the market.
"Well also each time someone spells the CYBRTRCK on the interwebz, less energy and storage needed. Accumulates quickly, you see?"
"I wouldn't use a van for a load of soil, gravel, or firewood.  A van has a fixed height and width so pickups can handle taller, longer, or wider things more easily.  A pickup is lower so you have less clearance issues.  Most pickups are better designed for towing and rough ground/rough roads than vans.

Vans are great as well, they protect your cargo from the elements, and there is less concern with how things are tied down - and they can be locked up.  And certainly offer a lot of customization options.  Their cargo area is also often lower to the ground than many pickups.

My point is both vehicles are perfectly usable without aftermarket.  I'm not arguing one is better than the other, they both have their place and Tesla would do well to offer both options (especially to support strong commercial sales)"
Hell no. Nothing can be as ugly as that twisted Sonic.
"It better not be. Everyone's concentrating on design and style, and that's important for a first impression. But if it's not in the end practical to use as a truck, it won't get far. In fact, it might need to go past that, and offer some hi-tech solutions that the typical F-150 user didn't know they needed."
I mean it is the one that was shown in Tesla's official Truck presentation. So it is from Tesla.
"Well, it's true regardless of what you believe of it."

"The car as a whole? No. But there’s a lot of people that hated the idea of not having a grill,"
"I think the idea would be that you’d not create even more barriers than already exist. 

I have to imagine nearly all of the early adopters will buy even if it wasn’t that “out there” - because the electric drivetrain is the selling factor.

Personally, I just hope it looks appealing enough that it doesn’t turn too many people off to it. I may get one in time, I may not. I just want to see Tesla succeed."
"Ford is coming out with an electric F150 soon anyway, they’re already running ads about it. Truck guys will get over it."
"Normally it should be fundamentally redesigned to be fundamentally better for the job, so I'm guessing it'll be their pickup standard"
"No. 


Make it cool, make it robust, make it ""make sense""  in people's lives and the politics won't matter. I'm speaking as a conservative who's dream car is a Model 3 and drives a hybrid."

"For sure, I was just caveating that because of the previous comment. I obviously don't want an ugly vehicle, but it won't be a turn off just because it's ""out there"" or different than anything else on the road."
I'm in mines a lot and need AWD/4WD and ground clearance. Not dealing with 16 MPG any longer is a dream. I can handle up to about 60k before I'll nope out.

Not claiming those people don't exist.  I am just claiming that there are people who really don't give a shit about the appearance of a vehicle if the specs are right.
That’s kind it where I’m at. If it’s way too out there getting my wife to be agreeable will be a pain.
"Like with all other Tesla vehicles, the sale will be in the test drive.  Once a regular truck driver drives CYBRTRK, they'll totally forget what it looks like."
"Ummm, those things aren't mutually exclusive.  

Regular truck owners can buy it and tesla owners might upgrade.  

For me, I got rid of my truck beside the gas prices were stupid dumb at the time.  I would like a truck to use with my business but ultimately, it was cheaper to rent a truck when I needed it."

Honestly... considering the monstrous shit going on in China right now... I am much less excited about Tesla being there.
"Sure, but that bed is way too big, the size of the f150 is enough"

"Anecdotally I applaud you as a conservative TM3 dreamer.  But businesses are built around rules, not exceptions to them."
"They’ve already hinted that it’s not gonna be “normal”. It’s called the fucking Cybertruck, you can kinda get the idea that traditional truck owners aren’t gonna be flocking to get it"
"Majority of truck owners, yes. That’s not some controversial hot take, it’s kinda obvious when you read all the bumper stickers on the trucks. Unless you’re in some rugged area, I’d say it’s more like 100% of truck owners are rednecks."
"makes sense to me, I just wanted to give you some support even though I'm not the target market. Someone didn't like my post though..."

On the fly adjustable bed size is the ideal. I've seen plenty of people say they want the bed short and plenty long.

"While I hope it’s appealing to them enough to be more open-minded than many have been, you’re definitely right that there will be a number of hostile ‘trucksexuals’ who behave inappropriately as they come to market - especially when they attempt to race it and get absolutely crushed off the line.

"To be clear, are you aware they did not aim at Mars?

from the [wiki Falcon Heavy Test Flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy_test_flight):

> ... it would be launched into an orbit around the Sun that will take it as far out as Mars' orbit

or, from an interview with Elon:

> So I decided to contact Musk. He got back to me, and gave me the info†. There have been a lot of rumors and misinformation about what’s going on here, so let me lay this out for y’all:

>1) Yes, he’s serious. He’s putting a Tesla Roadster in the top of the Falcon Heavy and launching it into space.

> 2) **No, it’s not going to Mars.** It’s going near Mars. He said it’ll be placed in “a precessing Earth-Mars elliptical orbit around the sun.” What he means by this is what’s sometimes called a Hohmann transfer orbit, an orbit around the Sun that takes it as close to the Sun as Earth and as far out as Mars. This is a low-energy orbit; that is, it takes the least amount of energy to put something in this orbit from Earth. That makes sense for a first flight.

That launch was literally a test of the capabilities of the Falcon Heavy... the tweet from Elon was him saying it went further than they thought it would go.
"WTF?  Do you have anything to back up these weird comments of yours or are you just making stuff up again?

There is clear evidence that they can reach Mars with a Falcon Heavy."
Trollolololol
[deleted]
[deleted]
"Normally you would be right. Exceeding the planned orbit would be very bad in a mission with a specified orbit. The difference is this was a test of the falcon heavy's capability and so they just burned the upper stage as long as it would go to see how much performance they could get.

  


It's a useful test that they can't normally do since usually their orbit requirements are so precise. They can estimate how much fuel they have left after a normal launch, but burning until the low fuel alerts force them to shut down gives them data they can use to better estimate in the future.

  


This was never going to orbit Mars. It was always going to be an orbit that passed Mars occasionally as it orbited the sun. Orbiting Mars would require a retro burn (or aerobraking) which the second stage is incapable of doing since the batteries would die and oxygen would boil off before they got to Mars."
"It did reach Mars orbit!   It did not orbit Mars.  They did not try to orbit Mars.  They had no intent, goal, plans or communicate to anyone that they were going to orbit Mars.  You are creating in your head a false-scenario and then claiming they effed up.

They had a plan to fly past Mars orbit and completed their test successfully."

"Open yourself up to the idea that your understanding may be wrong.

> SpaceX has confirmed that Falcon Heavy's test payload has passed Mars' orbit, putting it at one of its greatest distances away from the Sun (it should reach its far point on November 8th at 1.66AU, or 155 million miles).

Nice to see that you've come around.  We're still not eye-to-eye on definitions of 'Mars Orbit', 'Orbit of Mars', 'Passed Mars orbit', etc., but i'm ok with that.  I'm sure you'll somehow claim that you didn't change your stance or understanding, but I'm hopeful that you've backed away from thinking that they fucked up, because the test was a success and it went where they aimed it."
[deleted]
"What would a successful mission have looked like to you?  What was the plan that they 'effed-up'?  You know it wasn't to go to Mars, but you don't think it is successful in it's current orbit, so what orbit was it aiming for?

I believe:

1) You and I agree they were not trying to orbit mars, arrive at mars, or similar.

2) Elon stated they were aiming for a sun-centric orbit with furthest point beyond the orbit of mars:  ""a precessing Earth-Mars elliptical orbit around the sun""

3) The 2nd stage is currently in a sun-centric orbit with the far point beyond the orbit of mars

4) therefore, success


Elon's tweet on the success - ""Third burn successful. Exceeded Mars orbit and kept going to the Asteroid Belt."" - is misunderstood by some writers as a statement of failure or missing Mars.  You linked to this tweet as well as an article that says it was a failure.

From the article you linked: 

> Elon Musk has encountered a glitch in his plan to send a red Tesla Roadster into orbit around Mars after a successful launch aboard the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.

But, you and I both agree that the goal was not to ""orbit around mars"".  The writer of the article is stating that the launch was a failure because it failed to orbit Mars, but you don't believe that the goal was to orbit Mars, so why do you agree with their assessment that it was a failure?

You read the quote from Musk on his intentions - ""a precessing Earth-Mars elliptical orbit around the sun"" - and see that the rocket has put the 2nd stage in an orbit very similar to this.  The only difference is that it went even further.  Successfully further; not accidentally further.  - ""Third Burn Successful"".  Others in thread have stated earlier that the decision was made to keep burning the rocket longer to get an even bigger push, which didn't go against their plan, but was an enhancement to the plan.

I do not understand why you think this launch was an 'eff up'."

OKay. Where are the shots of the interior? I'm a huge elon fan but I don't think this was his best presentation.

This just proved Tesla does not understand the truck market. What a shitshow. Stupidest thing I've ever seen. This will be a week that will echo in automotive history.
"Yah, I literally felt the stocks take a hit when that thing rolled out....Then it really plummeted when they broke a window, and took another hit when the second window broke."
"I was shocked by the look when it first came out, in a sort of ""that crazy dude actually went for it"", but I love it now and I want it.

I was disappointed with their decision to throw a metal ball at it without making sure it won't break well in advance, through many tests. It was unnecessary and now regular people watching this presentation will think it's an epic fail because of that. Poor planning IMO and too cocky. My fiancee was watching with me and aside from her general impression of cringiness that those not used to seeing Elon talk get when seeing it unfold, she felt the whole unveil was an epic fail because of that.

The price was quite shocking. If given the choice between this or a Y, I'd go for this everyday. But late 2021 in production is quite late for me.

500 mile long range is out of this world. I love this so much. I wonder how badass camping mode will be in this beast.

"Watching now -- very cool stuff.

I wish they would toss the same loud mouth audience douche bag that keeps shouting ""shoot it""... out of the event.  Keeps interrupting the presentation."
That was fucking amazing.
I love the glass breaking feature!

Tesla Quad has me all moist!!!...truck on the other hand is ugly as fuck...as in no amount of beer can drink that pretty.

Whooooooooooooooooooooooooo
"I’ll never buy the truck, but I haven’t been this excited since Disneyland in July. I can hardly wait!"

I hope to see some interior shots soon.

That towing capacity is impressive.

I would have liked the glass to not break but it is glass so figured meh...at least it did not shatter all over the place.  it acted like current ballistic glass on a dignitary's vehicle.

Would  you be able to use that shit I use on my appliances to keep it shiny?

"If you want to know just how fucking crazy the Tesla super bears have become... Their prediction is 1% of demand, 50k annual.

**ONE PERCENT.**

Basically they are saying not having a truck, and having a strongest truck on the planet, will produce the same sales numbers. Like, having a business and having a cardboard box are same.

That's pretty whack-a-doodle. That's always Missing the Mark Spiegel for ya."

"Wait until Tesla shares take a dip (like $250), and then buy some call options for 2022. BTC is also low right now.

Lol. Your thoughts now?
"A ton of towing capacity would be extremely weak.  You're probably thinking of payload capacity.  A ton would be fine for that.

For everything you mentioned, you forgot to predict the price.  $120K.

With luck it will be less expensive and won't have quite as many pie-in-the-sky options."
"I am predicting this.. ""Mars Rover"" inspired styling.  This will be influenced by the future of Mars vehicles.  Sort of like how cars from the 50s had space race era inspired fins on them.  There will be some sort of tie in with SpaceX as we are at the new Golden Age of space travel."

"> Bullet-proof glass windows

Why. Unnecessary weight.

> 4 motors - one for each wheel

Don't really see a benefit unless you're gonna do in-hub motors which Tesla isn't there yet, and probably wouldn't be good for a truck due to mud and off-roading damage. 4 individual inboard motors would have to take up a ton of space and weight"
Poop break 530-7am haha
"I don't think that's unrealistic. The space they'll have for batteries under the bed, which isn't being taken up by a giant axel, will be a *lot* of room. I could easily see them fitting a 200kWh pack in the top end trim."
I'm sure it will. I'm guessing >600 miles so that it can do 200 miles with a boxy trailer.

He should also partner up with Coors or some other shitty beer company that the good ol' boys drink and give away a beer card good for discounted or free purchases for a year. Tell them that the truck will drive them home from the bar or something like that.

I thought it looks cool. More shots on the website. Reservations breaking the site..."
"The metal ball thing was not great, I'll admit. But that's really pretty minor, all thing considered -for Elon. It will get addressed and fixed. 

I own and operate a Construction company and know trucks very well, for play and work. I also build rat rods, solely out of classic trucks. I'm under 35 and fit this market range well. 

I don't care about the front slant of the truck, it's that way to reduce drag, so I get it. Same with the air suspension, all for better milage. The  tail gate ramp in a nice feature, the box plug is essentially mandatory these days. The generator was a no brainer and I believe advertised earlier. Air compressor is a nice touch. 

The issue, which is BIG. Is that you can't work out of the truck. In order to get tools at the cab side of the bed, you'll have to climb into the box. There is no place for a ladder rack for my 30 foot ladders. When the dude closed the tailgate, he was using his full strength. Trucks today have easy lift gates. 

The other issue is taking it to clients houses/job sites is not a ""cyberpunk"" sort of gig. Your going into people's homes, earning their trust.. platform boots,black leather jackets and pilot goggles don't represent.. ""I won't steal your shit""

I won't be purchasing this, even though it has some impressive specs and price point.. it's not practical for people who use trucks to make a living. It's a cool fun toy, for play. I'm not about showing how much money I have, when I'm giving out quotes to clients looking to save a buck. 

I do have a feeling that this is not the only Tesla Truck we will see. This is the Cybertruck.  riveons truck is too small, cybertruck isn't practical. So we will wait for the F150 next..which is a shame cuz tesla could have cornered that type of client from Ford.

Edit: words"
"Overall agree. Mostly it's an unnecessary risk. The dropping ball test was fine. But also IF THE GLASS BREAKS REPLACE THE TRUCK ASAP.

I HATE for all the initial photos of truck plus specs to feature broken glass. I just feel embarrassed to show it.

But price is amazing and design is *actually* super cool. Not conventional, will CERTAINLY alienate many drivers, but cool - like a functional Bat Mobile.

The thing is that the Y could be ready in 6 months. Truck in 24 months. That also explains the price differences. So... like S3XY could be $10k less each in 2 years...

That is the only way the 500 mi range for $70k makes sense, basically it's a speculation that in 36 months SX will be have 500 mi range as well, for similar price.

Also, no rear view or side mirrors... so this is also assuming FSD is fully adopted within 2 yrs."
"I think the truck is awesome. Not beautiful, but awesome. I love that they totally went for it with this one.

The window breaking will be forgotten. I'll leave it to others to discuss or evaluate its utility value compared to comparable pickups."

Shit new Chevy's and Ford's can run over 50k easily. Maxed diesel upwards of 70k. I'm curious what the price points and specs will be.
Yeah the idea of using Stainless Steel for the chassis of the truck was really smart because the thing that brings down used trucks values from the rust belt compared to a used truck from a place like AZ is a rusty frame.

"It is not that much of an issue, i don’t think it is too much on his mind"
"The fact that he was building 2x V1s and talking about not even making it to orbit until V3-V5 tells me that he had positively Spartan levels of emotional attachment to these ""babies""... It sucks, but was not wholly unexpected and I doubt Elon lost much sleep over it."
"Nah... The MC1 was a *really* basic bitch design, not good for orbit.

MC3 is made for orbit. And also, it's stress testing. The plaid-mode Model S 'exploded' on the track, but it did so during stress testing... so that's kind of the point.

I locked in what I think will be $2k less for FSD, so even if I don't want it I think I can sell it for mark up, etc.

"Well you are in luck. I think. 

I am pretty confidant the truck will have an SUV version as well. All other truck manufactures pretty much do that. It is not a difficult conversion you just need a cap over the trunk and a couple of slim seats on it. That is basically what the Ford Expedition, chevy Tahoe are. That is what Rivian is doing 

With out a Bulky axle going under the truck bed. The bed will be lower, making it even more suitable to fit a third row than the current full size SUVs on the market. If you ever look inside one, they are just trucks with additional seating built in the truck bed. 

if Tesla doesn’t do it. someone will come up with an enclosed cap to put on the back and voila you have an SUV. But since having an open bed is an aerodynamic problem. Chances are Tesla will come up with one right away. 

The truck is supposed to seat 6 comfortably, and be much more efficient than a gas one. So unless you specifically want third row seating, or Nd Ony have a space to park it. the truck will satisfy your needs for a good sized SUV."
Same. Waiting for a Y for a tiny third row since I ain't balling in stock enough to get an X. The Y should get us to Tahoe...

Sensibility? In *my* Reddit?
As an owner you don't need to reserve any way.  You can skip the line as an owner and place your order later.
"Hopefully they get better with each successive roll-out though in terms of quicker production ramp, less early issues, and figuring out pricing."
Wait you still haven’t had your reservation fulfilled? I ordered one this past September and got it in a week.

I sure hope there are no figure skaters performing underneath the truck.
Not everyone who buys trucks is a dumb redneck. And people are on this sub are always shocked that people think Tesla owners are elitist.
"Besides price point, dc fast charger design, center screen design, OTA software updates and enhancements, phone as a key, OTA have map updates, and a glass roof?  Everything I suppose. The only difference is Tesla doesn’t have a horse on the grille."
They wouldn't have done that demo beforehand if it was supposed to beak.

"As far as the lift gate goes, I imagine the production model may be totally different in certain functional aspects. I did notice he had to put some muscle into it (and that he was trying to hide that fact.)

"> I'm not about showing how much money I have, when I'm giving out quotes to clients looking to save a buck.

One of the reasons I sold my Model 3 -which I absolutely loved- other than the fact I was out of a job for a year and can barely afford its installments on Employment Insurance, was the fact people thought it was a 250K car. My bosses were all rich guys with inferior cars and they'd look at it and think I didn't really need my job. When I went to audition for another job, first thing I did was sell the car and start using the bus till they gave me the position. They won't give you a job they think you don't need."

It goes in, downwards, vertically. Starting from the top by the cabin.

On Tesla website, you can see a high def image of the rear. If you zoom in, the bed cover is actually segmented.

The reveal was a little lackluster tho, they didn’t really show much."
"If that’s true then what are all the brodozers with huge lifts for?

I think it’s more likely that Jeep guys who wanted true off-road capability switched to SxS and these giant 4 door Wranglers have become primarily mall crawlers."
"Yes, but that includes the final drive ratio as well. 

A 2019 f250, for example, is available with a 3.73 or 4.10:1 rear axle ratio and 935 lb ft of torque also has a 4.17:1 first gear ratio, which works out to 17.09:1, not to mention the transfer case which is usually about 2.72:1 and any torque multiplication that happens in the torque converter. So, normal driving, pulling away from a stoplight you have roughly 16k lb-ft of torque available. A model S, for example, is supposed to be 9.73:1, which is equivalent to 2.37:1 trans ratio with a 4.10 rear, which is roughly 2nd gear on the F250. You'd need 1,642 lb-ft of motor torque to be equivalent. The P100D has appears to have 862 lb-ft, roughly half that.

I'm not saying 9.73:1 and whatever torque this will have isn't going to be adequate, I'm just saying that X lb-ft of torque at the motor pinion isn't comparable to anything unless you factor in the tire diameter and gear ratio of the drivetrain."

"I paid $10,480CAD _more_ for my Dual Motor LR because I also wanted it ASAP and had to deal with numerous early VIN issues during delivery hell. The car showed up filthy inside and out, delivered outside under a dark tent in the back lot of service centre on a rainy Thursday morning. Mobile service has been 7 times since delivery.

Had I waited 3-4 months, I would've had the red carpet experience. The car would have been mint (or at very minimum, dry!), just like my $88,000 was suppose to provide.

A friend of mine took delivery of his P3D 4 months later, had the red carpet experience at the same delivery centre, paid $3000 more for the car and the value of the car has remained almost stagnant while mine dropped.

Again, I only say this so you have all the information going in. The shiny new product WILL be great. I want a Y and a truck [which nobody has even seen!], but I got burned and was taught a lesson the hard way. A bit of patience goes a long way, in this instance."

If it can tow a decent load at least 250 miles (preferably 300 or more) handle at least 3000lbs of cargo capacity and be under $75k well equipped (that's about what my Denali cost), then it will be my next pickup."
"I ran into the same kind of thinking when I got my first Toyota ""rice burner"" pick-up back in the 90's. If it's not ""Merican"" and one of the big 3 it's not a truck.

It's another thing for a EV truck to stat shame their trucks with tow capacity, acceleration, etc. I bet before long a lot of non liberal non environmentalists start coveting them."
"The vast majority of people who ""use their truck like a truck"" normally want it to be super reliable, do not care about electronics or gimmicks, and want to be able to sit anywhere at be ready at a moments notice. 

I think as it stands they are better off catering to their current tech people market. They have done well so far expanding the market of people who are willing to pay a premium for a vehicle, I do not think they will be as successful converting, especially truck owners."
"You have options between 1% of sales and 100% of sales.

5% is probably a *very* reasonable prediction, which is 200,000 Trucks per year.

The only negative, from an investor standpoint, is that *first movers*, *tech enthusiasts* are a group. Pretend they are 5 to 10% of population. The techies who would *refuse* a sedan or Y, and only buy a truck might not be a big group.

But in game theory, it's huge. By completing the lineup, every other car maker will be on *first drafts* of their electrics while Tesla will be selling *used* 2yr old versions of theirs for the same price.

This is complicated for people to understand, but the Pricing Dynamic is NOT primo-new-Tesla vs first-round-AltCar... but 2yr-old-Tesla vs first-round-AltCar.

So if Tesla is $50k and Alt Car is $30k, they are priced the same, if Tesla gets a 2 yr head start, as it will flood the used car market while the other guy is selling new... and a used Tesla is *almost always* better than a New Car from Alt Car maker.

This is first mover advantage. Tesla might have *double* the profits per vehicle sold as anyone else, but could easily be 4x... while still competing on price via used cars."

"Lots of truck drivers just physically need power, no?"
"I drive a truck as a truck- I drive in the tundra, desert, and swamps -20 to 115F, rain, snow, hail to remote Oil & Gas drilling rigs with tools and sometimes towing heavy gear.

Is the Cybertruck gonna be an excellent trophy truck? Most likely."
"As long as you can still tailgate smaller cars on the freeway while shining their headlights right into the back window, they probably won't have issues buying the tesla truck."
"I'd like everyone on this sub to be required to read about ""latent demand"" before being able to post"
"If you wait until it gets depressed (like $250) AND IF THERE IS NO RECESSION (that is a biggie) - they can do inflation - then Tesla could hit $750 in 2 years. That's 200% with stock, but if you do options with 2 years out that's like 600%.

If you are considering buying a Tesla, then gambling $10k shouldn't be out of the ballpark ;P While I hate to support the shorts in the slightest, I do feel a recession would severely cramp Tesla, more than others.

Regarding BTC, they have a 50% ration reduction every US Pres Election... so in 6 months. BTC is as sure of a bet as anything you'll ever get for the next 4 years, today.

Basically it's like OPEC cutting the Q of oil in half every 4 years... right now you are 6 months from that happening.

But there are many factors that could slow growth, such as 'believers' becoming over leveraged, etc, killing price with interest + high sell offs as it rises, etc... so not guaranteed, like anything else, but a better bet than most, especially as an asset class."

I own an S P100D and promised I would never go back to gas /diesel, but I need it to be able to tow any of the trailers with a good amount of range for me to consider it any next pickup. But who knows, it might look so bad ass I’ll just put it on the company and just use the diesel for the trailers lmao"

"> > The vast majority of people who ""use their truck like a truck"" normally want it to be super reliable, do not care about electronics or gimmicks,

There's a bunch of different demographics who buy trucks and  ""use their truck like a truck"" isn't a single group. 

Do you mean actual contractors/tradesmen who work on a building site, or homeowners who do a lot of DIY ? Totally different needs. 

Maybe you mean someone who tows a horse float to competitions with the kids, or tows a caravan ? All 4 of those are different demographics with different needs, and that ignores the large slice who just own a truck because they think it makes them look macho.

So... if this thing looks like an Armoured Personnel Carrier out of Blade Runner (as the hints by Elon suggest) then the poseurs wearing camo may love it. 

If it's a better towing machine with more load space then the towing fraternity may love it. 

If it has 240v and 12v charge points (tweeted by Elon)  and a big battery then the actual working tradies may love it.  

If it goes like shit off a shovel and handles like a sports car while still having load space then the macho types and poseurs will love it.

And hell, even some of us less pretentious folk might find a use for it too.

Just because you *use italics* doesn't make that a very reasonable prediction at all.  The Model 3 isn't anywhere close to 10% of US sedan sales, why is it *very* reasonable to assume the Tesla Truck will do that well?

> By completing the lineup, every other car maker will be on first drafts of their electrics while Tesla will be selling used 2yr old versions of theirs for the same price.

This is assuming Tesla beats other manufacturers to Market.  GM just announced they'll have an electric truck on sale in the fall of 2021.  Ford's electric truck will likely come out around the same time.  Remember, we have already seen Ford's electric truck, Tesla seems to be the one behind here.  

Your pricing talk reminded me that Ford will likely have some federal tax subsidies still applicable when their truck comes out.  

> Tesla might have double the profits per vehicle sold as anyone else, but could easily be 4x... while still competing on price via used cars.

Back in 2016, Tesla had a net income of -$674.9 million.  Now that the Model 3 is out and production is ramped up, in just the first three quarters of 2019 they have lost over $900 million.  Why hasn't their first mover advantage resulted in any improvement in profitability?"

"It's really not that complicated. You measure peak torque at each motor and then add them all up.  It tells you a lot more about the motors themselves than just stating wheel torque without including gear ratios. 

For example, the Porsche 918 has a total of 944 lb-ft of torque. The engine makes 398 lb-ft, the two electric motors combined produce 546 lb-ft. 

It's even easier in an EV since the motors will be making peak torque right at 0 RPM. In a hybrid, peak values don't necessarily happen at the same time so it would be misleading to just add them up. You have to find the peak of the whole drivetrain while operating at the same time."

"Maybe you’re underthinking being a beta tester on a 70k+ primary mode of transportation.

Maybe you’ve got spare vehicles and an extra 70k to blow, but I’d be hesitant to spend that all simply based on their promise, especially given the initial quality of their new models, and how much of a hassle people have had getting them fixed sometimes.

You know what’s better than having a warranty that may or may not get your problems fixed depending on how long you can wait and how many times you bother them? Having a vehicle that was built right in the first place. 

Honestly that’s what pisses me off about many luxury car shoppers, Tesla is far from the worst for this, but so many people spending top dollar on vehicles are perfectly okay with problems and issues, maybe if the market wasn’t so quick to say “it’s okay, it has a warranty” they’d put more effort into the quality, and maybe even produce cars worth keeping past the warranty (more of a dig at other makers than Teslas, they may have some serious initial issues but at least they don’t fall apart after 100k miles and 7 years).

Reliability and build quality used to be luxury features."
"> You are waaaayyyy overthinking this.

The brakes were by far the biggest difference. The suspension is lowered half an inch too, but I think it's the same suspension components.

Other upgrades were mostly cosmetic. Wheels, carbon spoiler and alloy pedal covers IIRC. A lot of people also didn't think the stealth models would get track mode due to them not having the bigger brakes... But they did. Makes sense as owners can upgrade the brakes if they want and probably will if it's a track car."

But, in all honesty, then I just go back to buying a used 75d/100d. So really, Tesla wins anyway kinda."
"Start with the LR AWD Model 3 costs $49k (so $25k less than $75k). Now Add 1 more motor (2 on rear axle, 1 on front - aka Plaid powertrain), possibly double the battery pack size from 75KWh to like 150KWh. Add better suspension. There's really not TOO much more to it than that.

So can they do that for $25k extra? Definitely possible. The extra capacity would be like $15k, the extra motor maybe $2k max..."
"Didn't Elon already state that it start at $50k? https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-pickup-idUSKBN1XV1CN

I'd say $75k should get us mid way into the options, at least long range and 4wd/AWD. Performance models will probably be $100k plus."
"Yeah I'm right there with you, I love my Duramax and it will tow our camper 400 miles on a full tank without even breaking a sweat. We've done a couple 600 mile days with it on long distance vacations and if the Tesla pickup doesn't have at least 300 miles of range while towing I don't see how it can replace my diesel. 

It's going to take at least an hour or so after your battery is depleted to recharge, so 500 miles in a day is going to be pushing the limit. It would probably add a full day of driving to a trip like we've done in the past from Colorado to Florida with our camper. It's still my dream rig to have an EV tow rig, because when we do stay at an RV park we'll have free charging.

As for work use the Tesla pickup will likely handle it no problem, I drive less than 100 miles a day and even though it's all towing range shouldn't be an issue with that minimal distance."
"Agreed, but my main concern is I'll want the biggest battery pack for extended towing range but the weight of that pack is going cut into the payload capacity of pickup. Tesla is going to have to beef up the suspension and chassis to have both range while towing and payload capacity remaining to actually tow/haul things."
"It checks all the boxes I listed, I guess I should have listed ""nice appearance"" so I guess this is all my fault. Sorry humanity, my bad."
"3000lb cargo capacity, not towing. A 30’ camper will be several times that."
Hahaha you don't even no the difference between payload capacity and towing capacity?!?! Payload capacity is how much weight you can add to your vehicle's axles and towing capacity is how much weight you can pull behind you on a trailer that is carrying the weight. There's no half ton pickup on the market or minivan that can have 3000lbs in the bed of the pickup or storage compartment 😂

I never said they were, there is obviously a huge variety in the types of jobs trucks are needed. But there is one constant between them all, they need the capability of their truck. Seeing that high-end luxury trucks are nearly 60k and the median household income in the US is around 60k it is pretty obvious that the vast majority of these trucks being used for truck stuff are going to be lower-end models. Especially when it comes to fleet sales.

You do not need autopilot to load a bed or haul a trailer nor do you need an air suspension to off-road.

There is a huge market for luxury trucks, and there appears to be a market for tech cars. I am not sure how much those intersect but I do not think Tesla will find difficulty selling to that segment at all.

It really depends on the starting price of the vehicle a ton, and obviously, if the range meets people's needs in that price range."

So, if vaping is banned because of that, so should venue smoke."

This actually strengthens the argument that big tobacco is behind the movement."

Aluminum is softer compared to SS yes. Aluminum isn't a great material to weld that's usually why it's not used in anything but aircraft. It's use here because it's light and it can withstand the forces of flight. Bollinger uses an all aluminum truck so yes it can be done.
"You're missing my point. When Tesla announced the Roadster, they just threw up the wheel torque number and didn't say anything about gearing. That number is absolutely useless on its own. 

Motor torque at least tells you how capable the motors are. When you provide it alongside gear ratios you can really get the full picture."

Just for the Semi reveal so far.  I think it's because of a SpaceX launch immediately before.
Thank you! I’m thinking this is just a prototype of the look. And I already kind of dig the look so we’ll see. Cause I don’t see any cameras for the FSD nor any mirrors (which I don’t think will be legal even in 2023). So we will see what the actual look is on release. Not to mention all of the pictures of it are un painted.
Yep that would be the mineral oil. That’s what caused the vaping sickness this time around- vitamin e acetate (mineral oil) they found in black market thc products
“no outrage and definitely no bans”
The density is higher from the e-cigarette. But if we “don’t know the long term effects” then we don’t know what dosage and what kind of regular or temporary exposure causes the long term effects.
"If tonight's model is so ""near production"", how come production won't be starting for ~1.5 years?"
">The wheel torque tells you how the car will perform up to max power.

Without also knowing the gear ratios, it tells you nothing. A Honda Civic can make 10,000 lb-ft of wheel torque with the right gearing. Hell, there are some trucks that can make 30,000,000 Newton meters of torque with crawler gears. But we can't see how capable their powerplants are on their own unless we also know the gear ratios. 


>Just the motor torque tells you nothing.

No, it tells you how capable the motors are on their own before any torque multiplication offered by gearing. It puts it on a level playing field so you can compare with other motors."
"By ""near-production"", I don't mean time. The Model 3 reveal event was 2 years before production began, but what came off the line was like 95% identical to what we saw at the event. That's what I mean by ""near-production""."
"\>Without also knowing the gear ratios, it tells you nothing

I pointed out:

\>The wheel torque tells you how the car will perform up to max power.

You seem to be denying this without explanation.

Perhaps you are thinking you also need the max power figure to fully compare the motor/drivetrain. This is true."
"> You seem to be denying this without explanation.

Because it doesn't without also providing the gear ratios. A 500 lb-ft motor with a 1:1 ratio is going to perform differently than a 5 lb-ft motor with a 100:1 ratio. But if all we're given is wheel torque numbers, they both make 500 lb-ft."
The difference will be the speed at which max power is reached.
"This is an aspect I think a lot of people miss. For all its other issues, autopilot/self driving works flawlessly in heavy stop and go traffic situations. That’s something that none of the other lane keeping/cruise control offerings from other car companies can boast.

Eventually, I've found most reliable way to use AP without nags is to firmly grasp both hands on the wheel at the 2 and 10 o'clock positions which isn't nearly as relaxing.   Am I missing something?"
"100%!  I try to quantify this for friends and family, but it is hard to put a value on how much less stressful traffic is.  I live in LA and drive all over for work sometimes.  Being able to relax and not get so tired having to focus for sometimes hours is amazing.

There should be some way to quality the health benefits of lowering the stress response /cortisol levels / improved adrenal function.

I would also love to see some type of air quality test driving behind ICE vehicles v behind electric."
"This is a huge thing many miss. I used to get furious in traffic, not I just smile and ""tap tap""."
"It was great timing that after I got my model 3 I took a job that was 7 hours away and got a home trip every month. And then after that assignment I got a job that took me through beautiful LA traffic everyday. If I did not have auto pjlot I would hate my life, but instead I sit back and listen to podcast or YouTube"
I use autopilot almost exclusively in stop and go traffic. It's amazing.
"I have the same experience driving with adaptive control in my EV around Los Angeles. It could be the regen braking, lack of engine noise and knowing that you are driving more efficiently _for the car_ that leaves you less stressed.


Bad/slow, stop/start traffic is terrible for an ice car, it's less efficient, you are always using the brakes(loss of energy to heat), the car doesn't cool as efficiently. We still drive an ice car occasionally and always comment on how we could be getting some great regen when going down any hill. It's especially sad as we drove a manual and used the engine to brake a lot, that energy is just wasted :(


Having a GPS with time estimates also helps. 90% of the time I just have directions programmed to indicate how much time it will take to get to my destination."
"100%!  Owning a Model 3 has not only significantly reduced my stress over rush hour traffic, but it makes driving *fun*."
I TACC and Autopilot all the time. love my Tesla Model 3.
"What follow distance do you use? I just got my M3 last week and I'm still trying to find the optimum setting when stuck in traffic. 

Love the center console wrap by the way!"
Texas plates i see there? :)
"I may be alone on this, but after version 10 autopilot reverted back to a previous state in which it would brake hard when traffic comes to a complete stop. 2-3 versions before was doing it much gentler and smoother. Anytime when it goes from 30-40 miles and then suddenly to 0, car doesn't brake until it's too late and it's extremely uncomfortable. Then it would speed up too quickly and harsh brake again. I tried follow distance of 2-3 and it's the same. It was doing much better job between Apr-Sep."
Idk about enjoyable but less shitty for sure
"Love it in heavy traffic, saves my soul"
yeah but please don't be on your phone while driving even with autopilot...
"It works well if you want to slog along in one lane.  But if you want to jump around to take advantage of faster-moving lanes, AP just isn't really up to the task.  So it's great if you're willing to get home whenever you get home.  But if you want to shave any time off of the commute, again, AP just can't change lanes fast enough.  In that case, I'd rather drive manually and take advantage of one-pedal driving."
2 hour commute for me. A blessing. I have a Model S loaner (no AP) while my car's in the body shop and I forgot how fucking awful it used to be driving without it.
"I wouldn't call being in rush hour traffic enjoyable, even in a Tesla. But it is less stressful."
well i prefer not driving at all...but yes its making commute less painful
[deleted]
He is a question... when you are in autopilot with the Tesla and you come to a complete stop do you have to hit the gas like you do in the Subaru? Or does it automatically move forward?
I love adaptive cruise control in traffic (except it's not aggressive enough for me) but hate autopilot when there are other vehicles around.
"I love driving. Even stop and go doesn't bother me at all. Driven for years and love to drive myself.

For this reason I didn't get autopilot. I'm sure it's great but I don't want it.

I drive my other ICEV as well and it's amazing to drive that as well."
I guess..... IF you enjoy jerky braking and drivers cutting in front of you because autopilot leaves too much space between you and the car in front of you lol
Not worth the 8k price tag for stop and go traffic for me. Opted for AWD instead :)
Did you use the 11 pro for this shot 😎🤟🏼
"That trailer next to me would definitely not be a joy! I'm anxious though, so all the mental energy I save with AP just gets shifted to imagining be crushed to death by a boat."
"This was one of the major reasons I bought it actually. Didn't get the FSD, but for what I do (drive 3 miles from my home to the highway, then drive in rush-hour for 27 miles, then drive 2 miles to work) it works really well."
AP and FSD have a pretty high success rate for me (anecdotal). It was 90% of the reason I even bought the car
"I think some others work pretty well now too. I know the Subaru Legacy loaner I got once w/ eyesight worked well in stop and go, although I didn't trust it's lane keep at all. the adaptive cruise control made traffic jams 100x more enjoyable though

Still waiting for my Model 3 to arrive, I'm sure it'll blow everything else away after I try it out"
Thats what I love mine for as well!
"This is exactly it I think. I don't yet have a tesla. I'm currently in a Mercedes ML550 with radar cruise control... a function I never understood the utility of till I got that car. It is FANTASTIC in stop and go traffic and really reduces stress by taking some of the pressure out of the situation. 

I told my wife when we go for a Tesla (after the Merc Dies), Autopilot is a MUST. Not to let me avoid driving... but to augment my driving."
This guy gets it
"Hey, I have been there myself, you have to put some pressure, like you are about to turn the wheel, but not too much or you will stop autopilot. The weight of your hand at 5 o’clock position gives enough torsion to the wheel that  the car know your hand is there, but not enough to stop autopilot."
"I think you can have hands close by or any position if you are adventurous.
Personally, I use either scrolling button wheels on the steering wheel.  It silence the warning. 
Works perfect."
It’s not force of grip on the wheel. It senses turning torque if that makes sense.
"To avoid this, you can hold your hand toward the top of that bottom gap so the weight of your hand/arm is applying downward force on the steering wheel. That's all it needs is just to feel a little bit of turning force. I grip the steering wheel at about ""4 oclock"" myself."
"Most of these replies don’t offer something to try, so give what I do a shot: set the driving feel to “comfort”, which makes the wheel easier to turn and, in my experience, Autopilot more likely to notice torque from your hand resting on it."
I think you just need to apply more force on it. Basically hanging your hand on the wheel.
I use my leg to give it a bump
"Like others said, torque stops the nagging. I seem to be able to rest my hand like this, but I'm probably constantly fidgeting/pulling a bit which satisfies the car. Notice also how you abort autosteer; a gentle, slow pull to one side is sufficient, no need to sharply turn the weel.

Yes internet, you abort autosteer also by pushing the drive stalk up, or applying brakes, but that aborts botg autosteer and cruisecontrol."
"It is not about the squeeze, it's about the turning force.  I can get AP to recognize my hand by pushing sideways with one finger."
"rotation, rotating the steering wheel slightly in one direction is all you need but it has to be a firm turn as you will feel resistance when you try to turn too much. If you don't feel resistance, it means you didn't turn the wheel enough. As you get used to it, you'll be able to slightly turn the wheel like an inch and hold it in that resistance spot and the warning goes away really quick."
I just let my arm hang while holding it at the bottom left. It's not white knuckling but not.. limp either. The weight of my arm has been enough to keep it happy.
"When I first got it, I found my normal ""cruising"" position (left hand lightly gripping from below around 7 o'clock, forearm resting on my leg) didn't apply enough torque. I eventually settled on right elbow on either my thigh or center rest, hand resting on top of the wheel around 5 o'clock."
"Every time you get the warning put volume up or down, and this will sense that you are there.  Or keep the right hand on steering wheel, bottom part, while your elbow rests on center console...  and moved this a bit right and left, without deactivatinnng the AP of course,  when you get the watning."
"I hold the bottom of the wheel and just give it the occasional ""jiggle""."
Yeah strap an ankle weight around the bottom of the wheel. Seriously though just apply alight pressure one way or the other.
"What I do is use my knees as a point of resistance. So I sometimes ""squat"" my left leg so that the knee touches the bottom of the steering wheel. In combination with my hand, they register enough resistance for the AP to recognize."
I was reading this old posting. Live in Orange county. Had to drive to woodland hills today. 2h45mins... Man. I really needed my 3.
"Thank you! I bought the kit from EV Wrap. It is 3M carbon fiber and precut  precisely.
I set it at 3, which is actually recommended by my Tesla technician. I think it works best."
"3 when over 40, 1 in traffic. Just keep playing and you'll find your comfort level (and it will get tighter as you use AP more)."
"Congrats! For myself I use 3, no reason really just seems good to me"
"When traffic is flowing and we're moving fast, I do 7 for a safety margin. When it's stop and go and under ~30MPH, I do 1 so people don't cut in front of me."
"If traffic is really bad, I set it to 1.

If it's in the 30-45 mph range, 2.

If it's raining, 5.

Otherwise, if traffic is moving and conditions are good, 3."
Yes! I am excited to see more and more Teslas here.
"I think I got the same reaction from my car. Right before V10 I noticed the car would slow down super smooth and human like but on the highway with traffic last weekend on V10 , I felt all the braking was a bit stronger than needed and definitely stronger less human like than before."
"For me it's gradually slowing down to a complete stop, and pick up again quite naturally. You may request SC to clear all your autopilot data and perform the calibration again to see if it helps."
"Not only just AP, but also the ability of not having to worried about turning the car on/off, lock/unlock, going from pocket to pocket to find the key is a soul saving feature!"
"I was very cautious. The speed was 9mph, traffic was packed."
"Jumping lanes can't possibly save you more than one minute at best, and just put you at risk of collisions at worst. Stay out of the merge lane and just keep on keeping on."
"That's true. I have become very relaxed and laid back since I got my Model 3. I just let AP do most of the work, I don't feel like changing lane or driving fast. Lol."
"True, but changing lanes usually has a small benefit for more stress.  De-stressing and letting autopilot just get you there is a huge benefit if you are going to arrive on time."
“Jumping around to take advantage of faster moving lanes” is exactly what causes traffic in the first place...... (along with wrecks obviously). [example](https://imgur.com/gallery/CIhYAiv)
https://i.imgur.com/qvQqEq4.gifv
"I feel like if you're in traffic with openings like that, you likely won't be bored or as stressed out so it wouldn't matter because you're actively taking those opportunities. A lot of annoying traffic is just everyone stopped , bumper to bumper traffic where there is no opening to take advantage of. AP is awesome for that."
"HumanFriendly Tesla Model 3... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQCTM3G?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

This one. Very high quality 3M vinyl."
"It automatically moves forward after the complete stop once it sees the car in the front moving.
I don't have a Subaru, but I have used the newest Toyota Safety Sense, and it is nowhere close to what Autopilot on Tesla can do. With Toyota Safety Sense, if the car stops longer than about 5s, you have to hit resume button, the car also drives fast and stop hard. On Tesla, it reduces the speed gradually to a complete stop."
"Come check out OpenPilot. I had the same issue on my Accord (won't automatically resume after an automatic stop). OP keeps pressing resume the instant the car indicates it has given up on automatically resuming. If the lead car has not moved, my radar silently ignores the request and the car stays put.

Bugsy has been working on getting the same thing working on Subaru. If you haven't checked it out yet, check out OP on YouTube."
I actually love driving more after I got my Model 3. Autopilot is like an assistant to help you relax in trafic jam after a long day at work.
"Damn autopilot leaving enough space for a car to merge in MY lane! 

Leave it on 7 and let people merge if they need to. It got a lot better about smoothly slowing to let people in on v10, but you're right that it's still too aggressive sometimes. I guess it's a pretty good sign when we're nitpicking about a small detail like this instead of arguing about the possibility of the car driving itself."
"In my 40 minutes commute, people cutting off suddenly only happens once or twice. For me, Autopilot reduces all the fatigue and stress while driving in rush hour."
Mine is pretty smooth dealing with mergers.
"Mine is SR+ with standard AP. I would love the AWD, but SR+ is my budget limit."
It is Samsung S10 Plus.
Ha!!!!
"Navigate on Autopilot is an improvement on adaptive cruise control + lane keeping. It makes long-distance driving far less mentally taxing.  I find myself once again willing to drive to places I had was avoiding due to traffic, etc.  That's a pretty major impact, IMO."
I have a legacy with the eyesight it’s amazing. Coming back from Boston in heavy traffic using eyesight my drive wasn’t stressful at all. The lane assist only works above 40. I want a Tesla some day mainly for the autopilot in heavy traffic. Which eyesight is kinda the same thing just not as high end.
Thanks for the advice.  I think I'll have to try and put a quite bit more weight of my hand on the wheel at 5 o'clock.
"No way, you can just turn the scroll wheel???"
Good idea.  I’ll try the 4 o’clock position and apply a bit more torque.
"One important detail I left out is that the steering was set to Sport, so perhaps that’s part of my problem.  Thanks for that insight!"
^ this makes everyone else without AP on the road very nervous. Please don’t try to find ways to game your required attention.
do it!  you won't regret it!
Was going to ask where you got the wrap :) it’s badass
I feel like at 3 someone's always jumping in front of me and bringing on the autobrake.  But at 2 I still get a little nervous when the car is accelerating toward the car in front of me!
"Oh nice! I’ll have to check it out, there’s already tons of finger prints after a week haha. 

I’ll have to try the 3 setting tomorrow! Thank you!"
"Thank you! Still learning everything, Reddit’s been super useful so far. I’ll give 3 a go tomorrow during my 1 hour commute"
"Hi excited to see more and more teslas here., I'm dad."
"I haven't had to fish out my keys for about 5 years now, but you're right, those little steps you never thought about appear so much bigger when they're in the past. I just touch the handle on my Accord to unlock it. Don't even have to press a button on the door handle. Just slide my hand through the handle to open it and it unlocks. Walk away from the car when I'm done and it locks. I still have to turn my car on and off, but I can appreciate deleting one step at a time from the process.

Also, there is truly nothing like hands off stop and go. It cracks me up when I see people urgently pulling up alongside me to watch me completely chilling out in the driver's seat as the car makes its way through traffic. I can't start fiddling with my phone because it is running my Android Auto, so I usually just ask Alexa to play some meditation music. Throw in my seat beads and memory foam neck pillow and my commutes absolutely do not suck. 

I'm saving up for the 3 that I want, not just the first one I can get into. Plus, I can't charge overnight unless I move, so there's that."
"I feel the same way, I'm just relaxed as I'm never really in a rush to go anywhere."
"Ha Ha, true! I have my favorite lanes on my daily 100 miles round trip commute. The only time I take control of the car is to get into these lanes and then let AP take over. Minimal lane change, maximum AP."
"Yeah man, just let AP keep your blood pressure down, it's [The Simple Solution to Traffic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHzzSao6ypE)."
"Yes, I agree.  AP is great for super-crawling traffic."
Thanks for that. I have noticed on my legacy that it accelerates slow get close to the car in front and then slams on the brakes not really that smooth at all.
Will do thanks brotha!!!
"Seriously, the roads would be a better place if everyone ""set their AP to 7"". If someone needs to change lanes, let them! Blocking them out is what creates traffic. That said, a lot of people do change lanes unnecessarily to try and get ahead, and they are the jerky drivers I don't want in front of me."
"It's definitely improving but I still wouldn't use it for much more than a fun feature to show friends.

Maybe where you drive, you don't have as many road rage drivers lol. I get lane changers all the time trying to cut people off to get a few cars ahead of where they were before... Which of course causes ap to slam the brakes.."
"40 minutes on 610? That's what, two exits? :)"
Its fine 75% of the time. But even basic autopilot is FAR from perfect. I would absolutely not get the car if all I was looking for was to take advantage of autopilot
You don’t find yourself cutting it close with the limited miles in compared to LR on the AWD?
"NOA is completely broken.  Turn speed sensitive lane change off, car still makes nonsensical lane changes, *every damn time*.

NOA just makes you look like an idiot on the highway cancelling turn signal indications.  Had to turn it off."
My latest vehicle was a legacy before getting a model 3 last month. The Model 3 is much better than the Subaru when it comes to lane keep and also the adaptive cruise control is much smoother. One thing I miss on the Subaru was the notification that the car in front of you moved. Really found that helpful but somehow the 3 doesn’t do it.
"Yes!!! I do it all the time. 
I was doing that same thing like others until I found out this. 

Left is for sound volume. 
Right is for speed. 

Also right button pressing left or right you can adjust distance from other cars."
Not in Europe...
For me the easiest is to do just a quick up+down on either scroll wheel. It's gotten to the point that I do it automatically ever few 15-20 seconds without thinking.
I did. Pick it up today!!
"HumanFriendly Tesla Model 3... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MQCTM3G?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

I bought it here. It is 3M vinyl carbon fiber, very well made. It took me an hour to install."
"No problem always feel free to ask, also don't forget you can click the right wheel either left or right to change the gap while driving"
">Blocking them out is what creates traffic

I'm going to go with no.

And there's too many selfish drivers on the road who change lanes at the last second before a turn and cut in front of you way too close or those who cut in front of every driver they can to get 1 car ahead (even if it won't really help them get around the slow pair of drivers in front)."
"I commute an hour each way on 285 in Atlanta. The only time I use a shorter follow distance is when there's an exit line that people try to cut. I have found that leaving space actually results in far less people cutting in front than you would expect, reduces stress, eases traffic, and results in a much smoother ride."
"It is actually 20 minutes on a straight one lane street road and 20 minutes on freeway. 
And you have good eyes!"
The good news is it can be improved with the updates.
"LR is 9k more than the SR+, which will cause a stretch on ny budget. For 240 miles on the SR+, probably 190 miles in real life situation, it is more than enough for my driving."
"It’s definitely not perfect, but I find it useful. When it does something nonsensical, I report a bug by pressing the right click wheel, saying “bug report”, and describing what happened that I didn’t think should happen."
Just turn on confirmations and it won't signal. I mainly use it for the one interchange on my commute.
Why would you need it to tell you? Model 3 will just start moving on its own once the car in front moved.
hmm I wonder if this has been what keeps it from nagging more than anything. I skip songs a lot.
Clicking in the left scroll wheel also pauses and starts music.
"Congrats, enjoy!"
Thank you very much :)
"Okay, maybe not blocking them per se, but tailgating, not maintaining a constant speed, and forcing others to slow more to change lanes (which goes along with blocking people out) definitely exacerbates traffic."
"I haven't been so lucky.  If it worked fine 8/10 times I used it then it would be useful.  But the moment I turn it on, the first thing it does is try to change to the left lane, when I have an exit coming up in less than a mile.

And *I don't even have speed based lane changes enabled*.  Broken, unforgivable, aggravating, useless.  Maybe it works better on Cali highways.

Regular AutoPilot OTOH is a big stress reducer for highway driving."
"So what's the advantage of NOA then if I need to confirm lane changes?  Just that it will auto exit the highway at the right exit?

Seems like such a small improvement over just regular AP.  Or is there more to it that you find convenient?"
In the city. When AP isn’t engaged and I’m illegally looking at my phone
👍
"The other side of that coin though is the geniuses who've read something on butterfly effect and causes of traffic congestion and go and leave 20 car lengths in front of them.  You can tell they truly think they're doing their part to alleviate traffic jams.  But the reality is that if everyone left that much space in front to eliminate accordion effects (stop & go), then the capacity between traffic light is drastically reduced.  IOW they're actually exacerbating the problem.

Not that I'm condoning tailgaiting.  But people tend to do a complete 180 and do things like leave way too *much* space, drive 5 *under* the speed limit (and hit all the red lights), and well, *they* are the horrible drivers.  So much so that I can relate more to the guy who's fed up with it and constantly passing anyone who isn't keeping up with traffic (even though that leads to more accidents - but the fault here IMO lies with the outlier - the one who refuses to keep up with traffic and enjoys a long line of cars stuck behind them).

The only people I generally don't let in are those who ride the left lane until the very last minute (because they're super important and need to cut the exit line) and try to make their lack of planning your problem by forcing their way in (with passive aggressive turn signal in your face to boot)."
I agree that it suggests/expects/needles about lane changes that don't make any sense.  I usually just ignore those.  But it would be way better if it didn't do that.
"Exits yeah and interchanges. basically it. And I've heard it works really well on less congested highways, but I've never tested it out since the small highway I get on off I5 turns off NOA. But yeah as of now NOA doesn't add a ton of value over regular AP. But like I said I keep it on just for my interchange haha."
Haha fair enough.
"haha I might be closer to that person that leaves 20 car lengths in front of them. I don't think maximizing capacity between lights is the goal - rather, it's maximizing throughput or the *rate* cars move through the light. Assuming a constant follow *time* (not distance) for all vehicles, speed isn't a factor for this rate. That is to say you could race to the light, slam on the brakes and accelerate through when it turns green, or you could time it to arrive at the light as soon as it turns green without needing to brake. Both options result in the exact same rate of traffic moving through the light, but the latter is safer, more efficient, and more comfortable.

I'm an engineer with a rush hour commute for the first time in my life, so I've spend way too long thinking about optimizing things like this recently. I'd love to read some studies on the subject if anyone has recommendations!"
But then I'm the crazy guy on the highway with his turn signals going nuts (I wish it would let you cancel earlier before turning on your turn signal).
"No if a stop light takes 2 mins, and you reduce from 20 cars capacity per stop light to 10, now you're much slower because cross traffic at the red light will fill in in front of you.  You now have heavier traffic between you and your destination.  More time spent at stop lights (hitting red lights) absolutely slows your commute.

We're not talking about acceleration and decceleration rates here, we're talking about road capacity (number of cars which fit on a given span of road in between two stop lights).  What you're referring to is the overall traffic flow (number of cars passing point X).  This doesn't speak to minimizing commute time for a *given* individual."
"Is the turn signal actually on?  Mine is set to require confirmation, so I assumed that the signal didn’t go on until I confirm the lane change."
For auto lane change yes.  I'll double check the require lane change tomorrow and switch to that if it's useable.
"I really don't understand why? This is an American-made car that is pushing the technologies of all other cars around it. All vehicles will have to step up their game to compete. I can see other auto execs taking exception to a vehicle that is disrupting their status quo and actually making them work, but some random Joe Blow on the streets should be ECSTATIC that these vehicles exist because it will benefit them in the end, too!"
Did you go into the diner and show the staff the video? He walks in there with the kind of territorial confidence and entitlement you would see in a regular customer who is pissed at someone parking in their spot. I’ll bet they would recognize him.
imagine being intimidated by an electric car. The world will be rid of that fuck in a minute.
"This is why there needs to be an easy way to view sentry events in the Tesla OS. The driver could have viewed it in the parking lot before leaving, called the cops, and arrested him on the spot."
"And then there's me: a 19 year old kid that gets excited when I see a Tesla.

Time to go to work boys! Let’s make this POS famous and confused!
"Send the video in to a local news station ! Spread this and make it viral! 

Keying people's cars is not a good thing and this will deter it, especially for tesla owners lol.

post on twitter too. also please make sure to come back to this thread and update us when karma justice returns.
It’s always a fat fucking old man in these Tesla keying videos. Pathetic losers.
Pure hate. I doubt it was because of the vehicle brand. Some people just hate nice cars and they have natural envy.

That really sucks. My hometown is Mansfield WA and I could see some of the local “good old boys” keying my Tesla just to be  a-holes.
i hope you catch him and let us know justice has been served!
"Political leanings aside, did you find him? I think you should print out a picture so it can be posted in the diner. When he comes back, he will be shamed and caught."
"I do not need an old man keying my Tesla, I have my wife and the side of the garage. Then, Tesla made it almost impossible to get replacement rivets that the body shop needed. Fortunately, my son was an engineer at Tesla and was able to get them for me."
It must suck to be incapable of accepting change for the better.
Despicable piece of shit!
Always the old white guys..
Thankfully nobody in Ft. Worth Texas seems to even notice my car.
Why have we not heard about this guy being caught?   Seems like it would be an easy one.
"Might be that it's not Tesla hate, but rather he hates handicap parking given special treatment?"
"It depends on where you live and the demographics.  I tend you see young people adore the car.  People in the mid 20s are mixed, some may show political dislike for all  things related to cleaner environment.  I have ran into cars on the road that would block me purposely in my Tesla.  They needed to make and statement.  It's the political climate of our world today."
I'm sure it has more to do with the car taking up 2 parking spots and not the make or model.

CAVE MAN HATE WHEEL. GRUNT
"Seattle-ite here, so I'll take a stab at your question. There are Teslas EVERYWHERE in Seattle. It's not uncommon to be stopped at a stoplight with 2-3 other 3's. In my 4.5 mile commute, I'll see a minimum of ten or so. Seattle is overwhelmingly liberal, which tends to correlate with being ""green"" (which has somehow be politicized). When you head outside of Seattle, you run into deep-red Trump country really quickly. When these people see Teslas in their small towns (usually hikers/campers leaving the city on the weekends), they associate it with Seattle, which they associate with Liberalism, when is now deemed to be the enemy, because of our lovely. insanely polarizing president."
To understand why you’d have to watch some Breitbart news or Fox News. But then you’d need to flush your ears with bleach. Lose-lose.

Teslas threaten their horse-drawn carriages.
"Because their life has been a waste and they are basically threatened by what the future potentially means. They are all mostly old white ineffectual people who have swallowed the myth that if you work hard, you’ll become a millionaire. Yeah, nope. Hasn’t happened and so Trumps rhetoric hits them. Pathetic old shits."
Because they want the kids to get off their lawn.
"I doubt they do. Cars have been getting keyed since there were cars with keys. The difference is that the Tesla is recording, so the ones that get keyed have video evidence and are vocal. The BMW owners, Audi owners, and so on who get keyed don't post videos because they mostly don't have them. Even if they have a dashcam, there's no view watching the body of the car."

"**I mean, don't fuck with another man's vehicle.**"
"Not my video so unfortunately I can't speak to that.  I imagine that would be a pretty huge detail to omit if they weren't, in fact, in need of a handicapped spot."
"In the YouTube comments, the poster says ""Yes it was the only handicap spot and valid handicap permit was hanging from the rearview mirror.  No visible handicap apparent from the guy walking in.""  


 (I wondered the same and made the clicks to find out...)"
"According to Facebook, hes been caught but the Tesla owner has chosen not to post any updates thus far.  Kinda odd, since they were so gung ho about putting the word out initially"
"It's a possibility but seems an odd thing to take issue with, especially from someone who seems to be two Twinkies away from a mobility scooter."
It doesn’t matter why. Decent people don’t vandalize things. Fuck this dude.
"I got my Tesla keyed in the bluest area of a blue state within 10 minutes of parking at a Walmart. This in the middle of a working day, with no cars around. Other than that I've only had positive reactions to the car."
"It's a handicapped spot, the driver was not occupying two spaces."
He wasn't.

"Politics aside, because I know plenty of owners of all political affiliations, but why would that matter, either? It's human nature to have things ""be about me"" and my point still stands.

I don't see the correlation. My old man is very old school red and he's wanted an even weirder looking smart car for like five years. Maybe these are people in the coral and petrol industry that are seeing their jobs slip away with solar.

"I watch Fox, breaitbart, and cnn. I also drive a Tesla. Now that your mind is blown I bid you a good day.

Edit: thanks for the downvoted thus showing your hate of differing opinions."
"People have always keyed nice cars. I don’t know how much Fox News has to do with this.

To be fair, most people who key teslas are probably fans of Fox News, but they are brainwashing the population to hate liberals, not key cars."
"I think this is totally irresponsible and wrong. What makes you think all the vandals aren't liberals? Conservatives respect private property.

Very true.. I’m still curious Amit why people do it
"Boy, I wish I could've caught him doing it. I'd have given anything to catch that asshole doing it. It'd been worth him doing it just so I could've caught him doing it."
"I was gonna go with something like ""he's probably upset because he was denied handicap status because of overweight"", but didn't want to fat shame."
I don't drive to Walmart with any good cars.  Too many bad apples go there.
Me to except I was at a restaurant for a work lunch 3 days after picking up the car.   Did not have sentry set up yet.   I had gone there many times before and it never happened with my previous vehicle.  There should be increased chance of vandalism warning with the vehicle.

Yee-aaay-yus. Puh-raise the Low-urd.
My uncle that watches Fox and reads Breitbart calls them “pussy wagons” and some other stuff I’m not going to write. I’m not sure if those publications are telling him about these cars. He doesn’t have stake petrol but I think he sees these as being part of some liberal climate change thing. Fox definitely talks about that

"Easily the worst thing about the Tesla community is how political it is. Anything pro-blue is upvoted and anything pro-red is downvoted, no matter what the topic is. Your comment is a prime example, downvoted because people disagree with you while most of the upvoted comments were upvoted just because they're pro-blue.  

Don't fall into your political parties narrative people, think for yourselves."

"100% agree on the brain washing. My dad is one of these (which makes me sad because he is super intelligent otherwise), and you can see him getting confused when you make a logical argument that doesn’t have a Fox News talking point response. He goes to the default “yeah but the Clinton’s  are worse” 

Anyway, all of his sons own Tesla’s, and you can tell he thinks it’s a better car but will never say it out loud because it represents environmentalism in his mind. We just drive them because they’re truly better cars!"

What propaganda? When I search “Fox News Tesla” I see largely positive articles.
"Shocking that republicans can be convinced with logic and facts. It’s hard to find dems these days that can break away from the conspiracy theory that big oil and gm killed electric vehicles. Nvm the fact the first Tesla cost $150,000, seated 2 people, had massive battery degradation, wasn’t that fast, and had very limited range. Tesla’s are marketable now because Elon Musk pushed battery tech to new levels. He’s literally pushed the death of gas cars a good 10 years early. We should celebrate his achievements and stop hating older companies for doing what was technically feasible at the time. Arguably all other ev cars are garbage even today when compared to a Tesla. Let’s see how many downvoted I get how for expressing data driven opinions."

The type of person who watches a channel geared toward hating one political party is the same type that would key a car. They are nothing more than propaganda. There’s a reason Shep Smith walked out on his contract.
"I too had my Tesla keyed, but there's no way I can agree with what this guy is saying. I made a rhetorical argument. When there is no supporting evidence, you can turn any statement on its head. I think all the people who upvoted him are idiots."
Holy crap.  I’ve never actually read that site before.  The negativity is incredible.  It was depressing reading the uninformed brainwashed comments.
"Sir or ma'am, don't present them facts. It frightens them."
"So if a person / organization doesn't put out both positive and negative stories on every issue, that's clear bias? OK, got it makes perfect sense.

Also, why are people so concerned about what some shit website says / doesn't say?  I own a Tesla (love it) yet have never once read a Breitbart article about Telsa nor would I ever care to.  I don't get it.  CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS etc etc are all pile of shit news orgs that spend 24/7 making shit up and 100% negative towards anything non-lib.

You are so emotionally fragile nobody can do anything without you guys insta-crying bias.  There is an obvious reason for this, but I guarantee you don't want to hear it.

"Thanks for answering. Surely you realize that this is a dangerous way of thinking?  

Anyway, the guy who keyed it is a jerk. Jerks come in all races and political spectrums.

It seems more times than not, when these things happen and when the perp is caught, they normally give an excuse like “I was cut off” or “they teased my kid at the soccer game”. Being that this guy is about to fall over at any moment, I’m guessing something transpired before this. Still not an excuse if so, but if you drive a Tesla, it’s one more reason to not be a jerk - to not provoke all the people who watch FOX. 😂😂

Why would a billion dollar company risk billions in developing new technology that would most likely fail? Multiple ev manufactures went broke before making a single car. Tesla was going broke before Elon took it over and he literally threw every penny he had into it before he finally got the model s working. After 8years he was finally able to turn a profit after making cars that are light years ahead of the competition. Trust me only Elon could have done this. It has nothing to do with evil greedy companies and everything to do with reality. Elon literally changed the whole market and now others are trying to copy what he did.
I believe everyone is smart enough to figure out when their fed bs with exception to mentally handicapped people. The issue is people getting all their information from 1 very biased source and refusing to look at other sources to gain perspective.
It’s actually hard for me to follow the garbage you just typed. You literally just said republicans are to stupid to buy teslas because the tv channels they watch are different than your tv channels. You also assume all republicans hate teslas because their republicans. You can’t imagine a world without a narrative. You’ve been completely sucked into a circle jerk and can’t find your dick anymore.
"I said it was a rhetorical argument, not a statement of fact. The only meaning in it is to say the opposite of what the other guy was saying,"
Thank you!
"So person watches / reads about Tesla getting sued for a car blowing up... then said person then keys Teslas?  Wow your peer set must be dumber than I imagined (and I have a vivid imagination).  I can't even fathom the lack of IQ or self-esteem to be that easily manipulated. 

And, for the record, asking why somebody attacks a bunch of companies out of nowhere is defensive? That's not just trying to figure out what the fuck they're talking about? Liberals and their lack of logic is just incredible."
"Lol. Dipshits staying stupid shit is ""getting stomped""? Lib insanity knows no bounds I love it. Whiny LOLOLOL... libs whine 24/7 and scream to the skies like a bunch of retarded bitches.

But there ARE many tough men in the military, so I'll assume you're in that group so well done!

And why is it my responsibility to walk you through the basic logic of how two totally different companies... are, uh, different?  This is the perfect example of you guys wanting to be spoon fed everything vs doing things (like reading and/or researching) on your own.  I too would love it if you or any lib on the planet applied logic or reason to your thoughts, because so much of this crybaby nonsense you guys inflict on the world daily would evaporate."
"Lol pointing out what absolute moronic bitches you libs are is tough? I literally don't know how else to describe a bunch of loser dbags in any other way. You guys add nothing to society nor will you ever... because you're way too dumb and emotionally triggered to make it in the real world. THAT'S pathetic, but of course you don't have the self awareness to understand that."
This may surprise you but there are a lot of customers out there. Shitty customers can drive other customers away. Firing customers is sometimes good for business.
I can tell you’ve never owned a business. Sometimes bad customers cost you more than their business is worth. Does this cafe want to be known as a place where cars get keyed in the lot? That would lose more business than this loser could ever bring.

You’re grouping two very different groups together. That isn’t a True Scotsman logical fallacy. Conservatives regularly denounce the alt right. My comment was on Fox News. I dislike Breitbart as much as the average liberal.
"You said someone who watches the stuff I watch must be stupid and therefore not able to buy a Tesla. You are literally implying republicans are stupid and don’t drive teslas. Not that it matters, but if you looked at my post history you’ll see a lot of stuff posted on model3 and SpaceX subs. PS I also like rockets which I guess is another thing I must be too stupid to enjoy."
He's insulting half of Tesla's addressable market without saying he's being sarcastic. We'll be in the same boat when he says it was a joke.
"I'm defending against dipshits like you and OP who just spew horseshit. And because I have a brain and a pulse, I know Fox News doesn't give a fuck about Tesla because why would they? I don't need to read every article to have an educated opinion. 

Imagine going back and forth with people so insane that anyone who challenges their statement indicating you'd need to bleach your ears (whatever the fuck that means) translates into being a troll in your world. I love that you're so dumbed down by group think that everyone else is a ""troll"". ROFL."
Do you guys purposely try to say the dumbest shit possible on every occasion? And I love how your dipshit peers start saying boomer so EVERYONE SAY BOOMER NOW 24/7!!  You're such sheep it's hilarious... not to mention it's so fucking irrelevant it's amazing.
"I love the attitude that you're a badass because you decided to go into the military, most likely because that's all you could do in life.  Ducked service, uh ok?  Did we reinstate the draft and I missed it?  Do we live in a 3rd world shithole with compulsory service because the country is hanging by a thread? But I get it, cowards hide behind something bigger than themselves to feel tougher... which is exactly what you're doing.  

Good luck out there with your fabulous combination of attitude and lack of real world skills. I'm sure you'll go far."

"There was a lot of overlap back when Steve Bannon was still with the president, but Breitbart’s subscriber numbers have dropped aggressively since President Trump distanced himself from the group.

Go fuck yourself. You and your shitty kind have killed innocent people and continue to do so.
"Thanks for being open to taking a second look at the contrasts between Fox and Breitbart. It’s easy to stick to one’s position when discussing ideas on the internet, so I have a lot of respect for your response. I’m not saying Fox is perfect. Personally, I try to read articles from both political sides and rely on the facts supported by both.

I understand where you’re coming from on climate change. Personally, I believe we will innovate our way out of it through technological advances in alternative energy and turn back the clock with carbon capture. I anticipate the Conservative position will shift as the voting base moves to Millennials and Gen Z. Especially since Gen Z is statistically more conservative than other generation groups.

I don’t think President Trump has enough runway between now and the 2020 elections to pivot on the topic of climate change, but many of the younger thought leaders in the Conservative party are more open to the conversation than the older generation.

Feel free to send a chat if you ever want to talk with a conservative who isn’t your family. :)"

"I’ve had mine for a year and a half... still gladly ask for errands ;)

Used to really not like road trips either.  Now I constantly make suggestions on where we could drive over the weekend."
"MSM! Good choice.. 

&#x200B;

and Yes, making excuses to drive, I'd had my car since Aug, and I still just want to drive for the heck of it. Which is such a weird feeling. Enjoy every mile!"
Hey... I picked up my used AWD LR from that exact parking spot!
Welcome and enjoy!
Me too! :)
"Congratz. I picked up my M3 from the same spot in August.  In my case, it was a rainy day and I did not inspect the paint job well enough though.  It had two chip spots almost exactly mirrored about 4 feet apart on the rear bumper that I discovered when I got home.  Other than that the car has been great.  Enjoy!"
"Last week. But I used the RajTesla trick to update. Tap the advance button several times. If that doesn’t work, just press and hold the advanced tab to force update. It worked for me. The new update is super awesome. Almost 98% one pedal driving."
Lol you are joking hopefully :) You don't need a permission from your wife to live your life.
Great tip!

I was surprised. I was planning on Christmas delivery.
Yup. Early this morning.
When did you get the software update?
"yup. alpharetta. same car i picked up there in September, assuming it’s a dual motor 😎"
"Got mine in Europe last week, all the pannels were perfect 100% same spacing"
I took delivery of my M3 LR AWD MSM Thursday. Also had v9 software.  Annoying we didn’t get new software with new car.
My wife was a little disappointed in the tutorial. Were you? Maybe it was our guy.
Look at this unmarried jokester over 'ere!
Where are you located?
How long ago did you get the vin #?
"Nice. I got a LR AWD in MSM. It’s been fantastic. I was apparently the last TN resident to pick one up there - they had already cut off TN resident pickups in GA, but my sales advisor had already ok’d it so they let it ride. It did mean that it took almost 2 months to get my license plate and when I asked them what to do with the keys to the trade I got a “...you have a trade?!?”"
I declined the tutorial as this was my 2nd Model 3.
They probably expect most have researched the heck out of the car. We just had them setup the keys that’s all.
atlanta
10 days?
"I was thinking that picture looked familiar.  I picked up my AWD MSM Model 3 from that service center a little over a year ago.  I think my car was in that same spot.  Enjoy!

Found the pic:

https://i.imgur.com/dyUNb8Z.jpg"
Alpharetta right? Thought it looked familiar. Picked up my LR AWD from there late July. Cheers!
"Nice I ordered 10/28 so I'm waiting lol. Just so excited!

Anyway enjoy your car! 

I ordered the same color!"
"I'm pretty sure it's Alpharetta, picked up there as well but last Nov"
"Ordered 10/17, nothing still!"
I ordered 10/16 still nothing😢
Which trim did you order ?
This is not giving me hope lol
"LR AWD, White w/b black interior"
"I ordered LR AWD, MSM with black interior.

Guess the wait is going to be very long!

Hopefully it'll be here before Jan for the tax credit"
Hey look another Model Y sighting 😆
Boulder?
I totally want to see a time lapse of what happens if you turn on the heater in the car for a few hours
How did it perform? Door handles work okay?
"Totally does!

Pow day!!!!  Man wouldn't that be fun to hit the slopes with all that fresh stuff!"
"Don’t worry guys, I found her.
 https://i.imgur.com/m2aDcJw.jpg"
Is there a charger under there? Did you take out ur charger? Curious if I should take mine out before snowstorms.
Probably won’t work bc of the camera being blocked but that would make for an interesting summon
Lol I made the same joke about our Golf. Turned it into a Tiguan!
Those Aeros aren’t gonna help much with drag when you got all that extra on top lol
Where in Colorado?
"What was the temp? Also, SoC and how much in was blue/unavailable until the battery warms up?"
Is there any worry with this regarding the battery? Does the battery only warm itself when on or will it be running here? Asking cause I’m sure to experience this myself soon here in Chicago.
"Good lord, that's a pile of snow! And here it's 60 in Phoenix, sunny, and I'm cold when I walk out to my car. :D

I do love the snow though -- but I like to go *to* it and then back to sunny-land."
Free upgrade.
[deleted]
Time to summon it out of that snow lol
Is this after one night??
It's still way better looking than the Cypertrk
Nailed it.
Looks like snow to me. /s
How?
how tf did i know? i honestly have no clue
I doubt it would ever melt through all the snow if the air is 27 degrees.  You'd be left with a layer of water on the surface that would freeze as soon as you turn off the heater.
Yes pls!
There's actually a couple videos on YouTube that test that but here's one https://youtu.be/rUg4sVGJbD0
This.
"I didn't even bother checking. I'm definitely not going out today. If the door handles freeze, I usually just give them a little fist bump, and they're fine."
Using defrost will thaw handles and charge port
"When I was out shoveling earlier, I saw 2 people on cross-country skis on the sidewalk going to the grocery store lol"
Not plugged in at the moment. You don’t want the snow to collect on the open charge door and put stress on that plastic hinge.
Aero's should ONLY be used (with snow tires!)
Boulder
"27ºF

41% SoC

 [This much blue](https://imgur.com/a/BHkSQdL)"
"I think if you have daily departure turned on, it will warm the battery up in time for you to leave, but otherwise it doesn’t make a difference."
"> Does the battery only warm itself when on or will it be running here?

It only warms itself up when you start charging.  If you start charging before you leave (or used scheduled departure) you'll have more regen available when you leave, but you gotta do it before you start trying to warm up the cabin (so 15-30 minutes charging, 15 minutes charging and warming cabin.)

I usually charge to 70% overnight and then increase to 80/85 when I wake-up, then turn on cabin heat and seats to warm the internal thermal mass of the cabin like 15-20 minutes before I plan to leave, unless there's snow to try and melt, then it''s like 30 minutes but I spend the extra 15 shoveling/brushing car.  This all to increase regen (it won't be full with the temp is below freezing) and ensure the heater doesn't consume a ton of battery trying to heat the car/battery to a reasonable temperature after I leave.

OP says you don't want the snow weight on the charge door, probably depends on how heavy the snow is I guess."
"Teslas aren't scared of snow and ice.  They test these things on frozen lakes in Sweden.   But I will say that my Model 3 last winter did OK, but the technology seemingly slowed the car down to a crawl when it was bad here in upstate New York.  I got where I was going, but it wasn't as fast, or as easy as with a 4 wheel drive truck.  This year i got the Nokian R3's for some extra traction."
You don't think it would compromise stability of the snow and it would fall off?
"Snow is an amazing insulator. It'd probably melt a layer of it into water around the surface of the car and if it were unstable, it might slide off."
But will the window come down?
Is that a new change?  Because my 2018 doesn't do that.
"Nice, so you’ve roughly got ~5% in reserve when the battery warms up."
[deleted]
This stuff is pretty sticky today. I doubt it would make any noticeable difference.
"I've never had an issue with the window not coming down as much as it needs to, even in freezing rain. It's really just getting the door handle dislodged that tends to be the tricky part."
Silicone spray on a rag and wipe the seals once a week in winter.  Nbd.
My Subaru Outback doors froze every winter. . .
Interesting.  I haven’t had that issue.  We get major lake effect but not the deep cold of the north mid states.
I've had the window get stuck due to cold weather. It makes you cringe as it scrapes against the window trim while you open the door... But it didn't do any visible damage to the trim that I could see
They pushed a software update last year so it doesn't go as far up into the trim when it's parked and below freezing outside.
"Fun fact: if it's below 40°F or so and you plug the car in while it's set not to charge until later, it won't lock the charger in the port."
What a douche bag. I hope you turned this over to local PD you can see his face pretty clear
Why man. Why. Just why. What is wrong with people. Why key cars that don’t belong to you. Why so much hate. Are you mad that you can’t afford it. Wtf.
Where was this? Can we get it posted on local subreddit. And send to local news station.  Repost this on other Tesla subreddits. Sorry man!
Choosing to key the one make of car in the parking lot with half a dozen cameras designed to see 100% of the environment around the vehicle...
That sucks. CyberTruck would break their key.
"This makes me wonder how many cars get keyed every year? Bet it's hundreds of thousands. 

Seems like it's not just idiot knuckleheads. Even law abiding (most of the time) responsible people do this in a moment of anger or jealousy."
Only losers carry around car keys.
What a loser. What makes an idiot do something like this. Probably thinks you are “too rich” and this is his way of payback. Ridiculous.
😡😡
Just another jealous cunt
Scum
Is this a west cost thing or does happen to Tesla’s all over America?
Do you get an alert on your phone when this happens? Or did you end up seeing the damage first and then you reviewed the footage?
Just sickening... Seeing a Tesla usually brings me joy and makes me want to work harder to maybe own one someday.  Can't understand why others think this is ok to damage other people's property. :( :(
Ugh. Might get worse when the Tesla trucks are out. Haters are gonna be all “Oh Teslas are scratch proof huh? Watch this!”
Hope he ends up in jail cell that smells like farts
"Make him famous.  Best way to go about it.  Reach out to local news and such.  Almost everyone so far has come forward out of humiliation.  Guarantee if he comes forward he says ""it was a mistake, a lapse of judgment in the moment"".  While we all know he is bragging about it till he gets caught.  Trash."
"WTF is wrong with people.  Side note, in college I was with a girl who almost got ran over my someone.  The dude parked and she keyed the shit out of his car.  It was the most shocking thing, and still one of the most WTF moments I have ever had.  People just have no respect for people or their property."
"I'm really sorry this happened to you. What can we do? To whom can we report this? 

Let's start by getting some AI Facial Recognition software and cross referencing it with people who look like Droopy Dog in the greater Austin area?"
"There's a great episode on envy on the podcast ""Hidden Brain"" that I highly recommend. Goes into this phenomenon of toxic envy."
Great pic of the moron though so hopefully they catch him.  The CT might help mellow some of the hatred as the niche Tesla audience massively expands.
[deleted]
This makes my blood BOIL.
"what the fuck is wrong with people?

Sorry that happened to you."
"These videos make me very sad. I really want the model 3 when I can afford one and videos like these makes me scared that this will happen to me one day.

Thank God/ Elon for sentry mode tho"
I want automatic salt shotguns on this car... I'm sick of seeing these morons do this.
So sorry. Post again to let us know that idiot asshole got caught!
Have any recorded keyings occurred outside of the US?
Automatic sentry turret will be a future option I hope.
"I hope this blows up like the other situation where this happened. They found the guy the last time, so I’m sure they can find this guy."
That’s one depressed fucking loser..not that people who are depressed are losers..
Card his car back.
I think this Keying has something to do with Trump.
John Wick his ass
I’m literally parking my car as far away as possible in every parking lot when mine is delivered in a few weeks. Fuck these people.
Was just wondering if there was any update to this?
Lots of BMW and Lexus's and other nice cars get keyed.  I don't think it's necessarily an EV thing.
"Can you report this to the Police, see if they can go get the video footage from HEB...if he went in and paid via a credit card or something you might have an easy way to catch him or get even better pictures of his face."
Please contact the PD. We need to see these people prosecuted so it stops. Because of the damage it seems like it's often a felony.
Basically it seems that’s the reason. They’re jealous :/
"Some people are just freaking morons. They will key any cars as long as it is new.

Even my brandnew Nissan Altima was keyed back in 2015."
"I only key my own cars, thank you very much"
"Either jealousy or ""owning the libs""."
"Jealously man. Some people just can't stand other people having better things. I don't own a Tesla but I had the exact same thing happen to my new car. It wasn't even a fancy car, just a usual Mazda that was 2 months old and someone rammed the door into the side and left. At least with a Tesla you have a video and can catch the culprit. In my case, I don't even know who did it."
"It happened in Austin, I posted to /r/austin as well.

Thanks for the tip!"
"Facebook groups eat this stuff up too. Post to as many local ones as you can find. Heck, I bet if you offer a small reward you'll get his info in no time flat."
I'm not an electrical engineer but couldn't the cybertruck maintain some type of electrical charge and then when someone touches it with a key they receive a shock?
"My first thought to lol. I'll miss my model 3, but cannot wait for the cybertruck. It is going to be a long 2 years."
I would love to see the data broken down by make/model.
Best comment
"I live in the northeast, I have a 3, as do a couple friends.   I have not heard of, or seen Teslas getting keyed. My workplace lot provides free charging, so there are quite a few Tesla’s parked near me each day"
I live in SD.   Teslas are everywhere.  No one gives enough of a jealous or “Fuck ‘lectric cars!” shit to key them.
San Francisco has this huge anti-car movement right now. “Fuck Them” was the reason why. Very convincing/s. Peter Pan syndrome.
[deleted]
I noticed it this morning and then reviewed the footage. No notification because the car alarm was not triggered.
"Wow this story has so many twists. You were ""with"" a girl as in dating? She almost got run over so she proceeded to ""key the shit out of his car""? What was the most shocking WTF moment? What he did or what she did?"
This would truly make the cars K.I.T.T.
1 mile per hour.
10%. How about trying a search?
yes..uk and canada have posted keying videos
"Update: Repair is $3100 but insurance will cover it. My deductible is $2k :(

If the dude is caught, he could be made to pay restitution."
"I filed a police report, and reached out to local news.  Nothing has come of it so far."
It’s terrible man. Don’t even know what the issue is with people like this. It’s complete bullshit. Hopefully it’s over whatever the amount is damage wise and he gets charged with a felony
"I think there may be more than just money involved.

EVs, and Teslas in particular, are a symbol of a lot of things that divisive in our society - liberalism vs. conservatism, fossil fuels vs. climate change, California vs. Detroit, modern vs. traditional, urban vs. rural, coasts vs. flyover states, cult of personality vs. faceless corporations, union vs. non union, etc.

There's a lot of *big feelings* when it comes to Tesla, and sadly some people take it out physically on the cars because they have *big feelings* and can't handle expressing it in other ways."
Is this really a thing? Every Tesla owner I know personally is a fairly wealthy conservative.
You should also post on Tesla Model 3 facebook page as well.
I run a twitter group called @sentrymostwantd for just this type of shinannigans
"Sure, if you want to get sued! But great idea."
"And state.  There seems to be a lot of Tesla hatred in states like Texas where a large percentage of people work in the oil industry.  Tesla is ""stealing their jobs""."
"I ordered a model 3 should be here mid December I was just worried because I don’t wanna get my car keyed up for no reason, but from what it seems like it happens only in California"
Well at least there safe in SD lol
The amount of disrespect is unfathomable but at least it was something you can wash off the car
"Damn, sucks man :("
Haha. Someone I dated in the past and was out drinking with. The WTF moment was when she keyed the car.
It's not 10%. Take your own advice
Kk. Must be a scale thing.
"There's also this classist thing with ""people who drive hybrids/electric cars are rich jerks""."
Basically it’s people who cling to the past and refuse to accept change

"This.  For additional insights into the backlash mentality,  check out Kim (LikeTesla) viewer feedback video https://youtu.be/rRrScdVX_wo

Just stop. If you think that it must be some redneck that hates EV’s you are no better than any bigot."
I love my Tesla and Donald trump. Please don’t stereotype everyone.
"I'm not one of those, but I own a Model 3.

I've been flipped off by pickup truck drivers several times. Thankfully never any physical harm to myself or the car. Just loss of faith in humanity."
"Might be a product of where you live. Every Tesla owner I know is a well off liberal, but I live in DC so that might have something to do with it lol"
"Idk about wealthy, but I am a conservative. I actually feel my car would get keyed if I put a donald trump sticker on it."
No way to distinguish key from other conductive objects. EE
What are they worried about? There's only minuscule demand for EVs right? GM said so.
"Don't forget you need a usb stick plugged in to record the footage, otherwise you just have an alert and nothing to review!"
"You said it was one of the most, we want to know the most shocking one.  You can't just lead us on like this Mattt."
I’d agree with this. There are a lot of closed minded people out there. I’m also a trump supporter as I find him to be more reasonable on issues although he’s an ass hole.
How are your insurance rates? currently shopping around to factor in the costs living in Detroit. TYIA
"That's the thing about Tesla, it's not an ""eco car"", a ""granola save the environment car""  - it's bad ass, leave them all in the dust, supercomputer, supercar for the common man/woman ..... and also, as a side note, supposed to be good for the environment."
"You don’t have to be religious about it to accept the science of it. However, still glad to have you aboard. Just continue to be open and inquisitive about it and you’ll then understand it better 😃"
Science is completely opposite from religion.

"Yeah, me too man. You wanna come over later and try to burn some witches and then pray to the sky gods that it rains?"
Hive mine won’t have different thoughts... don’t forget your on Reddit.
"I didn’t say that at all. I pointed out that Teslas are often a symbol of divisions in our society and can provoke emotional responses, much like yours."
Where did I stereotype anyone? I pointed out that Tesla is a focal point for a lot of the divisions in society and can evoke some strong reactions. You can certainly hold various views on some of the topics I mentioned.
"Same here. I've been flipped off 3 or 4 times, coal-rolled twice, and my least favorite - so many times I've lost count - when jethros speed up to get parallel to me on the highway then crowd the white line (an attempt to intimidate I guess?)  Almost always by large Chevy/Ford/dodge trucks, and once was a dude on a motorcycle."

"There’s science on both sides. My issue is that we cannot definitely say to what extent our activities and emissions are causing whet we are observing. The planet does have its own natural cycle.

We also can’t definitely say how much we can reverse or change course to mitigate what we are observing. If we take step X and notice no change what does it mean? If we take no steps and notice a change in the reverse direction what does that mean?

There are so many unknowns and variables. That’s precisely why it annoys me when people act like this is some set and definite science as if it’s basic anatomy and biology.

It’s not and that’s why I’m skeptical. I do what I think is right as an individual but I’m not going to mandate that on others, neither directly or by voting for policy that does such."
"In most sciences I’d agree. But climatology is hardly the same definitive science as say physics and biology.

It’s like saying metrology is the same as anatomy because they’re both sciences."
You basically said republicans hate Tesla and technology. That’s a pretty silly stereotype.
"I've never had it that bad, but if somebody matched speeds with me on the highway, I'd just smile and wave at them with both hands. :)"

"Your not reasonable.

"Metrology?? Are you confusing climate with weather? You seem willfully uneducated on climate science - it is super depressing, so maybe that's why. Makes sense as a human reaction, honestly. But is there any other realm where you think you know better than the experts despite knowing so little and having no training, degree, or time spent studying it? Do you doubt what the scientific experts who spend their lives doing their best to understand ... Space, geology, cell biology and genetics ... There's a reason you choose this one, climate, to think you know better. It's either your political identity as a conservative, ego protection and not wanting to admit you were wrong, or that the reality is too depressing to handle so you'd rather deny it"
"They are the same in that they are based in facts, data, and research. Any debate that counters climate change is not based in facts"
Haha! I'm so doing that from now on. Thanks for the idea!
Who said I liked Obama?  Not sure what he has to do with this.  I’ve watched all the hearings and read the reports and testimony. I’m completely justified in my classification of our current president. Has nothing to do with you.

"All you’re saying is “something is happening”. That’s an observation.

Where is the consensus on our impact in a measurable way and how much it affects the climate over a long term of years? I’m talking hundreds of years not just a decade or two.

And where is the consensus on what we can do to reverse course if the above is true? What’s the consensus on how much we’d be able to move the needle back?

I won’t hold my breath because the consensus isn’t quite as much as you’re led to believe. **That’s an agenda.**"
"There’s a lot of leftist assumptions in your tirade. None of them are true.

I made an analogy to a science that’s a best effort of forecasting based on past data versus a more rigorous science based on things that can be replicated 100% of the time.

Know what the difference between an observation theory and law is? That’s the key difference between climate change and established sciences.

Saying “it’s just science bruh” is a really vapid sound bite."
"Your attitude is precisely the problem.

You’re saying that given certain data points that proves a conclusion with the idea that we can impact those data points to an extent.

I’m not denying the observations. But I’m not sold on attributing it entirety to human sources nor have heard of what/how much of an impact we can make otherwise.

And then you get into writing policy and law based on these inconclusive assumptions on our impact, and potential mitigation. Trying to strongarm, browbeat, or guilt people into these policies is wrong.

Let’s not pretend as if past attempts of environmental interference (both flora and fauna included) haven’t come to bite us in the ass. We don’t know everything, and many good intention efforts lead to unforeseen consequences. See the Yellowstone Wolves for example.

Same reason California continues to burn at higher frequencies and stronger fires. Everyone wants to laugh at the “just rake some leaves” meme but it’s true. Having that amount of forest detritus does lead to such problems. All based on previous “conservation” and now you end up burning the entire place.

Healthy skepticism is always a good thing in science and it’s annoying that it seems unwanted in climate change debate. Which is why I call it a religion not a science, because anyone with a different take from the main sect is considered a heretic."
I would put money down that the vast majority of your knowledge on any reports comes from news anchors. It’s not a knock on you at all. Most people have sources they trust and they stick to them. You should try different news sources sometimes to broaden your view.

"> Where is the consensus on our impact in a measurable way and how much it affects the climate over a long term of years? I’m talking hundreds of years not just a decade or two.

How about 22,000 years? https://xkcd.com/1732/

But don't just take a goofy comic strip written by a scientist in his free time for it. This was a consensus even before the significant spike we're seeing today.

Exxon had an internal memo about it in 1982: https://thinkprogress.org/exxon-predicted-high-carbon-emissions-954e514b0aa9/

Coal companies were sharing this sort of information in the 1960s: https://www.sciencealert.com/coal-industry-knew-about-climate-change-in-the-60s-damning-revelations-show

Popular Mechanics had a small, quick statement about the effects of coal even before that:

>The furnaces of the world are now burning about 2,000,000,000 tons of coal a year. When this is burned, united with oxygen, it adds about 7,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere yearly. This tends to make the air a more effective blanket for the earth and to raise its temperature. The effect may be considerable in a few centuries.

How long before that? 1912: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:mL6ejphj8BsJ:https://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/coals-link-to-global-warming-explained-in-1912/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=au&client=safari

7b tons of CO2 per year sounds like a lot doesn't it? That was enough for people in 1912 to take notice of its possible effects on climate. Care to guess what the rate is today? It's more like 1100 metric tonnes. ***Per second***. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/05/brutal-news-global-carbon-emissions-jump-to-all-time-high-in-2018

Here's a handy graphic from a redditor that breaks it down by second: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/d5g9eq/real_time_speed_of_global_fossil_fuel_co%E2%82%82/

>What’s the consensus on how much we’d be able to move the needle back?

At this point it's already too late to reverse course. Best case scenario (which is a consensus shared by the linked graphic above) is to minimize the damage. How much we minimize it is up to us.

I know that's a lot of data, but you asked for a consensus, and you can't have a consensus without lots of data. If anything, I think the XKCD comic is the most eye-opening. It takes all of the global temperature data over the last several thousand years and displays it in an easy to digest graph that even the least educated of viewers can see displays an upward trend that doesn't even come close to matching historical temperature change rates.

What we're seeing is not a natural cycle. The spike is way too sharp to be natural, and coincides perfectly with the huge spike in CO2 emissions which we started a century ago."
"If all human knowledge was lost and had to be rebuilt, science would come back exactly the same and religion would be something else entirely.

There is debate among climate scientists if sea level will rise 1 foot or 2 feet in 25 years. But that disagreement doesn’t mean that sea level isn’t rising at all. 

What is the part you are skeptical of?
 - Burning each barrel of oil creates 750 pounds of CO2
 - We burn 80 million barrels of oil every day
 - CO2 in the atmosphere has increased from 250 to 420 ppm in the last 150 years after being stable for thousands of years. 
 - The last 5 years have been the hottest 5 years in recorded human history 
 - The greenhouse effect in general?"
"While you're correct that we can't definitively say to what extent our activities contribute to rises in global temperature (without a doubt a non-zero number, and likely a significant one), there's more to climate change than emmissions. Deforestation, habitat destruction and a bevy of other impacts made by humans exacerbate the problem exponentially. Between the loss of biodiversity and  the pollution of environments that make it impossible for life to thrive or even exist, we are 100% the problem. 

Also, the Yellowstone Wolves example is an argument that favors us. Why? Because humans hunted the wolves there for decades to the brink of extinction, and the lack of that keystone species led to overpopulation of deer, which overgrazed the land, which forced other species out because their habitat was no longer viable (both Flora and fauna). When we reintroduced the wolves to what had become a barren landscape full of old, sickly wildlife, they controlled the deer population which over time let the Park return to it's original, beautiful, healthily biodiverse self. That is to say, we fucked it up, let it sit there fucked and incapable of fixing itself, then stepped back in to help fix the problem and had massive success thanks to an understanding of that ecosystem, what was out of balance and how to restore that balance. 

To say that we as a nation shouldn't bother trying to mitigate this actively progressing catastrophe because some people disagree about the semantics of a single aspect of climate change, or because they ""don't believe"" (which makes it more of a religion to NOT accept it as true and urgent), is utterly ridiculous. The vast majority of those of us who want to see legislation to support green laws, policies and cultural norms are not trying to guilt the rest, we are trying to explain why it's a problem with measured data and analyses. A good, properly functioning government would and should recognize that its trajectory in policy should be based off of exactly those things, regardless about how people who are uneducated on/ignorant of the facts *feel*.

Edit: Added a sentence for clarity"
"I try to get my info from the actual reports without the color of the news. Too much propaganda on fox which isn’t based in reality. CNN is more left, but I prefer to form my own judgements from unedited sources."
"I'm only pointing out the obvious. Half of Americans vote. 30% of that half are still standing behind this criminal, cult regime. You're group is a dying ideology, and it can't come soon enough.

The only pointing and laughing is coming from educated adults. You might want to take a step back from Fox News and actually attempt a little critical thinking."
"Just because I lean conservative doesn’t mean I fit whatever mold you believe.

Science and math go hand in hand. Where is the math here? What models, show me where they estimate human contribution and temperature change over a reasonable amount of time (decades and centuries not years).

Show me the math of curbing X by Y can bring temperature back by Z degrees over N years. That’s the problem I have, no climate change theories seem to show any of the real sauce here. Hence why I don’t give it the same credence I would physics, biology, and chemistry.

When you’re just spitballing cause and effect ideas based on a handful of years, you really can’t expect everyone to just take it as scientific fact and law.

And it’s straight bonkers that I’m being mocked for pointing out the emperor has no clothes when it comes to the science behind climate change. I want action items, I want numbers, and I want them to be held accountable (proven or disproven over time). Not this “make theories and oh well later” crap trying to sell snake oil and vilify doubters.

Again, I think going electric is cool and a better option than fossil fuels. But it doesn’t mean I think we need to write completely unfair and misguided domestic and global policy around it."
"TIL humans have been emitting copious amounts of greenhouse gases for 22,000 years and recording climate data throughout!

Glad to see the science and forecast models are based on that instead of a hundred of years, despite the earth being around for millions upon millions. Oh wait..."
"The fact that I’m demonized for criticizing and rebutting climate change from a science and data/conclusion standpoint and still being attacked goes to show you the “zealot” and cultist nature of climate change.

You’re talking about the “what”, which I’m not denying is occurring due to various emitters. However where I have a problem with is the causality and remediation effort. The earth has been changing for a very long time, far longer than we have been around on it, and it will likely do the same as we are on it.

You’re essentially saying that we are burning fossil fuels which emit CO2 gases; therefore CO2 gases **must** the reason why temperatures have increased over five years.” Nevermind the planet’s natural cycle and nevermind the fact that five years is mere blink of the eye in terms of climatology.

And CO2 gases have not always been stable on our planet, look back farther and you’ll see that CO2 gas is were at one point very low, dangerously low in fact. Anyone who runs a greenhouse also knows that elevating CO2 levels within creates better yields (for obvious reasons). CO2 is very important and to look at it as strictly a greenhouse gas and not part of the ecosystem that surrounds both land and sea is very misguided.

So I’m not honestly sold that CO2 is the sole and majority contributor to rising temperatures over the course of a handful of years. That’s not how science is conducted that’s how fearmongering and conjecture are conducted. Show me centuries and millennia not a handful of years are cherry picked to your conclusion.

I think it’s funny that the same people who criticize Big Oil for marketing and other propaganda campaigns to prop up their business, absolutely refuse to believe that Big Green could be doing the same as there are tons of companies and people making money off the green initiative.

Again, I’m not against being eco-friendly and mindful about what we do as humans on this planet. But don’t try to sell me policy and a dogma based on the “sky is falling” fear. Climate alarmists have been making short-term predictions for decades and it seems nearly all of them have yet to come true in any way."
"The policy angle is what bothers me because those policies seem to not be based in science at all. If they were then countries like India and China would not have been exempted from things like the Paris Climate Accords.

Meanwhile the US is one of the “cleanest” polluters in the modern world as far as technology goes. Yet the other countries who dump far more (and more noxious) into the environment are seemingly given a pass? Again the Earth is all of ours and doesn’t care where it originated from.

If it’s really about the planet then no country would be given an excuse. But it seems it’s more an economic looting game than actually trying to save the planet.

There is money being made in politics, government, and companies from the green initiatives just like where was with oil. I don’t trust the “innocence” of it.

Again, I’m here buying a Tesla for numerous reasons. And I don’t throw shade at those who drive hybrids or EVs. But assuming that you’re helping save the world by doing such is a bit misguided (and the marketing play been used on that target audience)."
"Fox has been shown to be the least bias by independent reviews. Their opinion pieces are bias, but their opinion pieces that don’t try to pretend to be news. CNN is far more biased than fox, but tries to pretend it’s an objective source. They’ve had way more retractions the past 3years than Fox and 100% of them were for spreading fake news with a liberal bias. If they’d admit they are an opinion piece then I’d be ok with them just like I’m ok with MSNBC. MSNBC doesn’t pretend to be objective and fully admits they are an opinion network.

With that aside what has convinced you that trump should be impeached besides that he’s an ass hole which isn’t illegal."
"Your entire post is arrogant garbage. It’s all platitudes and accusations without any proof of anything. You’re like a child that watches cnn and thinks they aren’t lying constantly. You have no idea who I am or my background and you assume I have no critical thinking skills because I support the President of the United States. Give me a break. I’d reply with something meaningful, but you didn’t provide anything meaningful."
"We prob should take this over to r/politics. There’s too much evidence to demonstrate the corruption and mafioso style that trump espouses. 
The obvious cooperation with wiki leaks and Russia, this whole Ukraine mess with trump being terrible at covering  it up, to him developing a back channel with Giuliani doing his dirty work. If you look at all his closest associates, the majority of them are in prison or heading that way. 
Not hard to connect the dots. Seriously. 

In the end I’m tired of our president acting like an asshole. Being an asshole isn’t illegal, 100% agree but our president shouldn’t be a foul mouthed asshole. The president represents us, works for us, and should be someone my kids look up to. Trump is none of those qualities. 
Again not illegal but very symbolic. It’s time for someone less of a polarizing figure, so everyone can stop fighting and get back to moving the country forward. This partisan BS is ripping the country apart, and it all started when Trump became president.
We are playing right into Putin’s hands with the chaos and we are better than this. 

I wish the Republicans gave Weld a chance and they weren’t being held hostage by this guy."

Fox news is only beaten by brightbart and dailywire. 

Trump admitted to witholding aid from a foreign government in exchange for personal gains. Multiple witnesses have corroborated this fact.  That's literally bribery. Whether or not it's extortion is still on the table because it's tough to tell if the Ukrainians felt ""pressure"".  the fact that we didnt ""get the quid"" means nothing. If Hunter Biden was literally Hitler and trump was correct, that means nothing. What he did was illegal. Withholding aid (which is only legally allowed by the president for 45 days by the way), for personal gain is objectively impeachable. 

He has single handedly divided this country more than its been since the civil war. He has propped up and promoted white nationalists and paved the way for literal fascists by disavowing every news source and in turn said that only his words are correct, were being ""invaded"" by foreigners and making decisions that considerably help him and his friends.  This is literally out of Hitler's playbook. Am I calling him Hitler? No. But he's certainly showing how gullible the conservative base is for the next right wing president who has a few more IQ points and isn't so obvious with his/her agenda.  You're actively voting against your classes best interest. I'm happy to explain to you every reason your wrong if you'd like. And I can be civil about it."

"To be honest any republican elected would be deemed polarizing by the media. Trump is definitely an ass hole though and I don’t like him for that, but I’m 100% against socialism and I feel that’s where the dem party is going. Then again it’s hard not to be pissed off when the media is clearly working with the fbi and constantly lying about you about the most mundane bs. They fact checked him for saying he had burgers a mile high and for a meme where he have an award to a dog. His associates went to prison for minor tax violations and other bs that literally half the country is guilty of. Mueller black males them with felonies to try and get them to tell him about trump. They didn’t get a single person to come up with anything prosecutable after pure government harassment. This is literally Soviet style abuse of power and it’s ridiculous. They sent 15 FBI agents to raid a nonviolent offender for a perjury offense? The irs didn’t even care about some of the minor tax violations they found and yet mueller was allowed to prosecute them so he could once again try and black male people. Does the fact they were spying on trump before the election even bother you? How about the fact they used dnc money to fund a foreign agent to invent fake evidence to use for a fisa request? Everyone talks about the trump tower meeting, but forget to mention the Russians trump jr met with were Clinton associates. This is straight spy novel stuff that really did happen. half the country gets all their information from msnbc, cnn, abc, cbs, and Comedy Central and will never hear of any of this. Heck, cnn was caught giving debate questions to Clinton and you guys still think they are an unbiased source. If Fox did that you’d never hear the end of it."
"Where did trump admit to withholding aid for personal gain? That wasn’t in the transcript and I’ve not seen that anywhere in the proceedings. The majority of the witnesses have been operating on here say and the ones with direct knowledge such as the ambassador said they were explicitly told not to do quid pro quo etc. they also changed it to bribery after a poll came out showing bribery is viewed more negatively than quid pro quo yet none of their original transcripts even have the word bribery in it. It’s clear this is a 100% politically based impeachment. The Ukrainian President didn’t even know aid was with held so if there was quid pro quo it was the worst quid pro quo ever. Btw the aid was only with held for something like 2 weeks, the Ukrainians didn’t know it was withheld, and it was released to them with no strings attached. Barak Obama also withheld aid to them unless they aligned with him politically. This is completely normal presidential behavior. The difference is Obama only have them cash and blankets. Trump gave them cash and javelin missiles to fight the Russians. Obama also completely ignored the Russians had invaded Ukraine. If this happened under trump you’d claim he’s a secret agent and try to impeach him."
"Btw your arbitrary chart on media bias doesn’t prove anything. It’s completely based on someone’s opinion and as such has little value for deciding whether news is bias or not. If I took my opinion and made a chart about it, it’s still just my opinion.


[snippet on YouTube of the sondland depostion.](https://youtu.be/rK-AxUp7Mrg) Watch this unedited video of sondland in his own words talking and then try and tell me CNN isn’t running extremely biased headlines. CNN has ran stories saying trump is scared of stairs, scared of fish, over feeds fish, and hates his wife. They are foaming at the mouth for anything they can find to try and cast him in a negative light. Thankfully people are waking up to their bs."
Que?
"There’s so much right wing propaganda and trump talking points in this message it’s laughable. Too much in here but I suspect you are watching a ton of fox and infowars. I believe several of trumps associates in jail or heading there are going because of lying to Congress, money laundering, campaign finance violations and other crimes. Simple tax evasion is not the reason. Roger Stone did not get convicted with tax evasion, Manafort? Cohen? Not registering as a foreign agent, lying to Congress, soliciting foreign governments, tax evasion is the tip of the iceberg.

You are lying to yourself if you think Trump is an honest and stand up guy. 

Despite what you think the dems aren’t going socialist. Every party has its kooks in ask directions, the moderates generally win out. 
Don’t be afraid, they cannot do any worse than what we have now. No dem or republican in recent history has disrespected the rule of law, the constitution and the American people like trump has. Congress has the power of the purse string and the power to subpoena witnesses during investigations. Trump has defied the constitution by threatening and bullying potential witnesses. Forget about witch hunt accusations it’s all false. He thinks he is a dictator that can do what he wants. 
This country is heading to a dangerous place."
"Okay so again this is the typical response, I highly suggest you watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca12k2qbUQM. Heresay is definitely credible evidence - especially when its corroborated by numerous witnesses. Fox news and jim jordan are the only ones who think it isnt credible to take heresay. Another argument from the right - ""he didnt explicitly say bribery"", of course not. He's not a complete buffoon.

Also the ""its moving the goal post from quid pro quo to bribery to extortion"" response, hilariously easy to contest. Quid pro quo is bribery, its literally just a latin translation for bribery. Quid pro quo was changed because people on the right didn't spend the 30 seconds to google it and find out what it means. Quid pro quo means this for that, bribery is literally this in exchange for that. Extortion is definitely on the table - but not confirmed yet, because that depends on if Ukraine felt pressure, and its tough to determine that. There's a case for - since it was a request from the most powerful man in the free world, there's implicitly some pressure there, but I dont think that holds up well. This impeachment isnt 100% politically based- your ideas are, because you watch fox news every night and they do a GREAT job of propaganda peddling. 

Next response - ""it was the worst prid quo pro ever"", that doesnt matter. You cant say well it was bribery, but it wasnt the worst bribery. He had intent to bribe, and that means he'll do it again, or at least if he gets away with it - he will. 

The Ukrainian president didnt know it was being withheld - that's still intent to bribe. Also this was disproved by numerous sources- including Fiona Hill's testimony - I suggest you rewatch hers. Hers was absolutely the most damning and up front. 

The aid was only withheld for 2 weeks, https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/us/politics/ukraine-aid-freeze-impeachment.html
This is one of many articles & testimony from fiona disproved this. 
He withheld it for months. 

It was withheld with no strings - ah another jim jordan talking point. If I hold you to gunpoint and ask for your money, and a cop shows up and I just put away the gun and walk away - I'm still in trouble. This is simply not a good defense. I suggest the video above again by Legal Eagle about actual legal defenses. 

Obama did the thing too - I will never defend Obama - because 1) this is just blatant whataboutism & 2) He didnt withhold aid because they needed to ""align with him politically"". He withheld the javalins due to his stance on how to approach the war with Russia. This isn't a political decision, this is 100% just policy. If trump withheld aid because he didnt believe they would use the javalins wisely- we would be in a different spot. He didnt do that. He withheld aid - and this was said multiple times by him - in exchange for looking into ""the 2016 election, burisma and the bidens"". 

I absolutely disagree with Obama's take - and agree with Trumps decision for the javalins as they are a great deterrent, but bad decisions are VERY different from corrupt ones. You have to understand though - this absolutely has nothing to do with the case- this is a fox news & jim jordan dialog tree that he worked up the night before. I cant believe you cant see this."
"Okay - so this is the typical conservative response. I dont care for your whataboutism. All news media is biased. I watched the trial myself, all the way through. Every single minute. Its not hard to cast him in a negative light. He is the *source* of the negative light. It's sad that you cant see that. He has done nothing good for this country. Fox news is just as bad. Did you watch his fox and friends interview last friday? Because that was 100% rambling and even the fox anchors were getting worried."
"ALso - I linked 3 sites - two of them are polled by Americans, as in the country we live in - and one could be an op-ed- unsure by looking at it. I did 15 minutes of searching - and found 0 things pointing at CNN being the worst and fox news being the best."
"The dems are using their investigative power for complete political purposes. The current impeachment has no grounds to stand on and everyone is starting to see it besides people on the left. If dems were held to the same standards trump has been they’d all be in prison. You said a rep went to prison for lying to Congress. Adam Schiff has been lying about his Russian evidence for years and isn’t in prison, explain that please. If he was given bad intel from James comey then why isn’t comey in prison 1 for lying to Congress and 2 for leaking classified info to the media? What money laundering are you talking about? You guys are worse than infowars sometimes with your conspiracy theories. CNN is almost as bad as infowars sometimes. I wonder if joe Bidens son registered as a foreign agent? How about Nancy Pelosi’s kid? Why are all these democratic politicians kids getting laid $600k/ur to run companies in businesses they have no idea about? You guys always try to associate Epstein with trump even though trump banned him from his properties. You completely ignore the photo of Bill Clinton wearing a blue dress and red high heels in Epstein’s mansion, but because there is a picture of trump with Epstein before trump knew he was garbage then clearly to you all they were best friends. You can’t just brush off everything I’m saying as talking points. These are events that happened. I’m 100% ok admitting when republicans do bad stuff and I’ll hold their feet to the fire when needed. I’d appreciate the same from you."
"So what was said in the trial that convinced you? From what I saw the democrats looked like idiots trying very hard to spin a non issue into something impeachable. Take sondland for example. He “presumed” that trump was withholding aid, but trump never told him to withhold aid nor did anyone on the planet. He simply “presumed” it or out a better way completely lied about it. Then cnn runs an article how sondland is the nail in the coffin for trump and how his testimony was very damming. If you watched the actual trial and come away that trump did something impeachable you are a political hack."
"I’ll tell you what. I’ll listen to a pod cast of your choice if you listen to a Ben Shapiro pod cast of my choice,"
"Who the heck was talking about Epstein?? I don’t believe I mentioned him. He has been seen with all types and has nothing to do with this. A lot of what you are talking about has been proven untrue. 
When it say you guys, who are you referring to? Are you assuming I’m a democrat because I don’t agree with you or the right wing conspiracy stuff you are hung up on?  You’re wrong. 
I’m all for any candidate that we as a nation can trust and be proud of that represents the best of America. It’s certainly not Donald Trump, a philandering wannabe dictator that has had so many failed businesses than I’ve had cars. 
Also stop talking about Clinton. There’s no Clinton in power or running last I checked and it’s such a tired irrelevant argument to continue to whine about “Hillary!!” Or “bill Clinton this!”

Biden’s son was not working for the government, nor was he lobbying on a foreign government’s behalf, nor was he involved in an active political campaign so therefore no registration required. 

Please come off Trump’s talking points.  
I’m not going to respond to this thread Anymore as there’s no point as I’m sure you can agree on that. 

Let’s go back to talking about your model 3."
"Okay - so you're so wrong here its unbelievable. 

The ""presumed"" argument was literally put into your head by jim jordan - and I dont blame you - hes loud and charismatic. 

Its very very very probable to use ""presumtions"" in court cases - and this isnt even a court case. This is an impeachment trial - so you dont need beyond a reasonable doubt here - you just need intent. If I walk into a house and hold up a gun to someone's head and point at a safe - someone watching would ""presume"" im threatening them for money or else. As humans we can only presume what the other person is thinking, we have absolutely no way to know - if presumptions didnt hold up in court- noone would be charged, ever. 

The easiest defense in the world - I know I went to rob the bank - but they presumed I was holding the gun up to them to threaten them for money - I actually was just pointing at a fly on the wall with the gun, I swear. 

We have to look at the actions the person took, and discern the intent from that - which comes with presumptions. In all of trumps calls - he did not 1 time say anything about corruption, but mentioned the Bidens 3 times. His intent was 100% to get information about the Bidens. 

I suggest you watch the video I linked you in the previous response - your getting your talking points from fox news- who will 100% spin it to make sure you believe what they want you to believe. Cnn definitely does the same thing - thats why I avoid both. I dont think sondland was ""damning"", but it was pretty damn bad for trump. It certainly corroborates intent - which is what we're looking at here. Intent to exchange aid in return for personal favors. 

I think the problem you're running into - is that after you watch the trials, you go straight to fox news and read what they want you to read. I suggest you listen to the trials again, and forget every single talking point they've fed you, because theyre wrong. Everything they say ""isnt a case"", really *is* in the real world."
"I've listened to plenty of Ben Shapiro. He is the dumb person's intellectual. He shows his ""Strengths"" by owning young uneducated college kids from a position of power. Its easy to argue your points when you have a microphone and a platform over anyone else. He's really really really bad. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDMjgOYOcDw
Here - easy run thru"
"“Its very very very probable to use ""presumtions"" in court cases”

In very very specific cases this is the scenario such as your example with the bank robber pointing a gun at you. The issue is this isn’t a bank robber pointing a gun at you. This is a question of whether president trump with held aid primarily to get Ukraine to investigate a political opponent. Your star witness the ambassador was supposed to prove this case as one of the only first hand witnesses to the presidents actions. The most damning part of his testimony was that he presumed the president wanted him to do something the president never directly asked him to do nor did anyone in the presidents administration nor anyone on the planet. In this case his presumptions were completely made up by sondland. So basically you have a job and presumed your boss asked you to do illegal things and now your worried the illegal things are bad so you call the cops to report your boss. This isn’t an eccentric Jim Jordan clearly explaining the case. This is Jim Jordan explaining the case. You have to have a PhD from msnbc to try and explain this off as Jim Jordan just being good with words."
"Your post is literally just “Ben Shapiro is stupid and a bully”. Fine, then go debate him and prove you are smarter and not a bully. If anyone is a bully it’s MSNBC trying like hell to get the public outraged into locking up innocent people for differing political opinions. Your side has no ideas and all your arguments are from positions of power. I can guarantee you’ve never listened to an entire Ben Shapiro pod cast from Ben Shapiro. Everything you know about the man has been given to you by msnbc."
"Going down this chain the only input I want to add is that I applaud you /u/FreeThoughts22 for being open about your position. This might not be be the right place, but we need conflicting views to surface somewhere. In the 1800’s coffee shops were where true debates happened amongst citizens. Today people can’t keep emotions out of the discussion and we often end with polarizing arguments. We as citizens need to learn how to be civil and understand each other. We’re all on the same team as Americans.

This said, you’re absolutely right that CNN is very biased. They’ve now started playing the game that Fox News has been so successful with. Both should really be avoided. Online Fox News ads classify themselves as political entertainment, and Roger Ailes has been quoted comparing their competition to entertainment networks rather than news.

We all have some commonality in this sub—that we support Tesla and feel the above vandalism is sickening. As another fellow owner I would just advise to be weary of ALL news networks, even the one you thought was the exception this whole time. Try using NPR or another independent news source for a while and see if you begin to see anything differently."
"Thanks for saying discussion is important. I sometimes feel the modern left is worse than the old right in the sense that they feel morally righteous about their ideas and there’s no way you can debate that because it’s purely emotion. I consider myself a classical liberal and while there are a lot of rednecks in the Republican Party I’ll vote for them over most democrats because at their core they care about the country and freedom. The left is slowly moving towards the communist side which believes the collective is more important than individual liberty and I can’t support that. It seems like the left doesn’t have a plan for making poor people rich so much as they want to make rich people poor. Like you I don’t like trumps mannerisms and he’s  hard to work with, but he gets stuff done and cares about the country."

"Do you know how much do you have to pay for the option to have the backseat infortainment?
Some brands are still using dvd player and charge you like $3000 for that. Their screen quality is usually bad. Unless you go for manufactures like MB, BMW or Audi, then again they charge you an arm and a leg for that.

If you want backseat entertainment, I would say buy 2 iPad for $500 instead of $3000 for 840×480 resolution on most  car brands."
"Can you show me which sedan at $39k price point has this beautiful screen and streaming ability?

Last time I check many SUVs has backseat entertainment system, but they look outdated and it comes as an expensive option. Unless you pay even more for manufactures like MB, BMW or Audi.

If I want a backseat entertainment on Model 3 or any other cars,  I will just hook up 2 iPads for like $500, instead of paying $3000 for most brands to have a system that looks like it comes from the 80s."

"That is awesome all the kids I know love them, I think we have future buyers already lined up!  I think kids normally think cars are boring but when they start to see the Easter eggs in these cars they get interested, I think Tesla is in some way marketing to them as well!"
"The car is supercharging, so it can't drive. Also my kids are well behaved and they know they are not supposed to touch anything."
"The emergency latch thing happens to me all the time. I find people tend to find it and pull as they are asking me how to open the door. I need to get those stickers. If you like yours, would you share a link please?"
"I’ve played a lot of photo hunt in my years!

The safety thing on the sun-visor can be removed with rubbing alcohol (search reddit or YouTube) if you want to make the interior even MORE minimal. I removed mine and love it even more that way. 

It’s a very good thing the door button doesn’t work while driving, my friends accidentally mistake the windows for the doors all the time"

It looks like English. At least I could work it out the main point.
"10 years from now when our kids grown up, our world will be a very different place for the better!"
"I bought this one.
Tesla Model 3 'Open Door' Button... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S7W444B?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

It comes with two sets of label."
"What the actual fuck? You asked question, I answered with my best knowledge. And you asked me to fuck off?

How about you go somewhere and grow some brain cells, so you could answer your own question next time?"
😂 hope is good
Logic and reasoning.  Sometimes people are immune to it.
"Took me 3 years and 8 months to get this beauty. Korea is one of the last countries to receive Model3, but one of the first to get 2020 models which come with these 20” gunpowder sport rims."
Gorgeous colors
I’m from the US and a Model 3 owner. I’m currently visiting Korea for a bit. It’s exciting to see Model S and X every now and then. Was hoping to see some 3a too!
How has the demand been in Korea? I remember seeing a post of people lining up at a shopping center to get a look at the model 3. Have you seen a lot of others on the road?
Great photo. Those rims are fresh.
Where in Korea is this?
Looks gorgeous. Congrat! 축하합니다 부럽습니다.
"Looks amazing with the new rims! I don’t know why Tesla doesn’t put pics on its configurator, this isn’t what I imagined it would look like, was going to get black or grey paint as I thought it would be the only combo that worked"
Those new rims look SO good on this car.
It's the first time I have seen a korea plate. Is it combination between number and random korea characters?
"Hi

Can you post more pictures of the wheels and their color?  Thanks!"
[deleted]
I'm asking the same everywhere lol but... are those the new rims? <3
"No it’s only been a week so far. Tesla Korea is doing their best but there are only 2 sites for delivery which are only capable of ~40 a day total. If my math is correct there are 200s model 3s in korea at this moment. I got lucky to get it on the very first day (Nov 11, 2019)"
"Chungju

Fun fact. Jim Carrey tried to learn Korean by saying “Hows weather in Chungju?” in Yes Man.

EV’s license plate got blue sometimes in 2017 so it can  easily take advantage of parking and tolls (~50% off). Some people hate it because it only goes well with Pearl White and Deep Blue.
"2020 is the date on the VIN number.

All the cars being manufactured in Q4 19 have 2020 VINs."
They look like the sport rims but powder coated a dark graphite or black.
"That's good to know!  AfAIK Tesla (and owners) almost never refer to the VIN year but usually either the date of manufacture or certain versions of hardware (HW3, Raven, etc)"
When you build a new performance Model 3 in the United States at [tesla.com](https://tesla.com) the rims are this color. I'm not sure if it's that way everywhere though. They look amazing IMO.
"Yeah, tesla owners refer to what it says on the purchase agreement which is the VIN year"
Nice shot!
"It's really an awesome car. Drove one for a week while I visited California on holiday and now can't wait for Tesla to open a service center in my country and store so I could get one. 

If Tesla would have the same kind of service and retail infrastructure as VW, their demand would probably be several times higher than what it is now. It's incredible how much people don't know or understand about EVs and Teslas."
Same :)
If you had to pick 1 thing you love the most about it. What would it be?
"It’s not been washed from day one. When I go to our local mall it’s a toss up between a £70 wash or a free charge, at the moment I go for the free charge."
What's wrong with your paint.
"HEEEEEEEEY MAAAAAAAN

NIIIIIIICE SHOOOOOOOOT"
"I can say for mine, it’s hard to pick 1 thing, i often compare it to my iPhone in 2009, it was suddenly  blazingly obvious how behind everybody else was (think about smart phone in 2009, palm treo, blackberry, and the sidekick were the major players)

This week my car got a 5% performance improvement, because the software was improved, last month it got the ability to drive to the door to pick me up.  It’s amazing to me ...."
"I think it’s the overall drive, it’s comfortable, nice to drive long distance and quick when you need it. Yes I know that’s sort of three, but it has so many positives."
"It’s an experience.

It’s just so easy and convenient and fun"
He's parked under some kind of canopy and we're seeing a reflection of a tall narrow decidous tree.
I believe sometimes cars get dirty
"I initially down voted you, then zoomed in. I’m not sure if that’s some kind of dirt on the car, or artifacts from the picture. But you are right if you pixel peep there is something weird...


Either way it’s a cool shot from a unique angle!"
I wish i wouldve met u id say nice shot
Couldn’t agree more! We still have our sidekicks sitting in our closet haha. There’s no going back once you experience a Tesla.
I think you mean 2007.  By 2009 all those other devices were fading into irrelevance.
You got 2019.36?
Don’t forget Netflix...I’ve used that way too much lol
Haha it’s hard to just pick one. Once you start the list just kind of falls out of your mouth.
"It's artifacting from phone camera software using ""AI"" to smudge the shit out of everything at the pixel level to smooth any sensor noise at the macro level."
"Yeah, my bad, I’m an iOS dev, so I’m thinking about 2008 when they introduce the App Store (and then opened it up to developers in 2009)"
Love the two tone look!
username checks out
"Truly one of those cars that is aerodynamically designed to never be clean.

Trunk area is always dirty. Pretty sure bugs somehow die on the front grill area when I park it. Every Pebble attack the soft rockers

At some point you just gotta give in."
I like your YouTube channel btw
"Seriously, what did you drive through, quicksand?"
Accurate name
"I saw the picture and was like ""oh, this must be DirtyTesla"" and then I saw the username, yup!"
"Hey u/dirtytesla I live in Michigan as well and on dirt roads.

I am waiting for the Cybertruck to get my first Tesla. 

How has the paint been holding up with the extra pounding you give it?

How many winters have you gone through?"

makes me glad I live in the south.  Winter's destroy cars.
On brand for sure...
It's got a certain...je ne sais quoi...
"Nice, the organic wrap."
Oh yeah 😏🤤
Made his Reddit account 7 months ago knowing he'd post this picture
I was wondering about trunk dirt. It seems excessive. Ceramic may help turn it into a quick wipe off effort at least.
"Or you can get XPEL paint protection in the critical areas, and not worry about stone chips"
Thanks!
All the snow's melting on the dirt roads
I think he did on video on that on his YouTube channel.
"Paint's doing good. A bit gone from the rockers in the back. I added mud flaps tho.

I got my car in February so this will be my first full winter.

I'm also insanely interested in CYBRTRK!!

Here a couple paint videos
