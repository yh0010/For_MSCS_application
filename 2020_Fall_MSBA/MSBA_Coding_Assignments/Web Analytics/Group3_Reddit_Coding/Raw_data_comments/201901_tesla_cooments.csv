What is the nearest country that is actually supported? maybe you could have someone from that country complain about the clock when they visit Turkey.
"Tesla has other problems with time zones (and configuration management). Back in 2015 I reported a bug with their web browser not using local time zones for the web browser date/time returned to web apps. Instead, the browser stubbornly insisted it was in PST even though its own location info reported a Washington DC location. 

They initially said nothing was wrong (this is what happens when your QA team is in the time zone where the bug is). After looking at screenshots and some sample JavaScript, they finally corrected the bug in a release in 2016. 

Guess what bug is back in 2018?"
"We are a small community (250 Teslas) in an unsupported market trying to get by on our own. However this really is a tragicomic case and shows how much of a start up Tesla still is. If this gets to the right people this will be a very easy fix. You can't adjust time on the car, it is automatic from the servers yet servers don't know Turkey opted out of daylight savings 2 years ago.

Many of our members including me e-mailed Tesla about this and all we got was 'You are an unsupported market so we won't even update your timezone.' I've been replying to every Elon tweet trying to get this heard. Tesla's official account contacted me once via DM and asked for my VIN. I thought that would fix it but ever since they didn't reply or do anything either. So our last resort for a 10 second fix is you guys. If you can make this seen by people higher up on Tesla I'm sure we'll finally see the correct time."
"Wait you can't set the time in your own cars?

I....kinda have a problem with that."
Sent this off to a Tesla engineer I know who works on the model3. Best I can do. 
Sorry to hear this. Hope it gets resolved 
Sorry it's sad but also really funny :D i hope it gets resolved fast! 
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database

There seem to be constant time zone changes.  I see this mentioned as being updated in every quarterly release notes for Oracle Java."

Would appreciate a whole bunch of you retweeting!"
"From a programmer's prospective, timezones are literally the worst..."
I know Franz.  I'll let him know.
"Tesla, from what I have seen at least, has been very fast at updating software to fix problems/bugs. So if they're not fixing the bug it seems like it is because they don't want to get involved in the Turkish market."
I'm in the USA but if I ever drive my tesla to Turkey I want the correct time!!!
Since your country seems to be going back in time I dont see the issue. 
"With you in spirit OP. I'm in the UK with my favourite type of car - one that doesn't BONG. It also doesn't set it's clock so for 6 months of the year (*whatever it is), my clock is also wrong :) Me lazy as...."
Poor you! 
"I think it will serve as a good test since more and more countries in Europe are expected to retire from the obsolete daylight saving system (which was never proven to bring any benefit). Especially the UE plans to do it as soon as this year, although the final decision has not been yet taken. And even so, we don't know yet which country will end up in which zone (as it is highly political).

On the other hand, Tesla might just wait for those decision to update everything in one go. I personally hope not as I don't see any reason to make the Turkish people wait any longer. But from a software engineering and testing point of view, it might happen."
Tfw Elon's a Gulenist
Imagine not being able to change the clock’s time in your car
could get root access to the software and change the TZ data files in /etc/
RemindMe! 12 hours
"Just saw this; Turkey did not opt out of DST, we are actually in permanent summer time. Other than that, hope you guys get it fixed."
Serious question: What does a car need the correct time for?
That's because turkey is a backwards country^sorry

Keep us updated on what happens OP
You payed full price for a car but can’t change the clock/time... do you then really own the car????

"I don't understand why anyone would buy a car brand, that doesn't respond to customers"
The real solution here is to get Turkey to change it's time zone.
"I have but one question for you: What's it like without DST?

I wish the rest of the world would join you guys in getting rid of it!"
NO EMAILS REPLIED?? THAT'S SAD TO HEAR ABOUT TESLA.
Aren't these cars like base model $50k? You can't even change the clock? Money well spent.
Twitter is an effective way to reach elon
You can't change this in the settings?

"Turkey: daylight savings is dumb and we're not doing it!

Tesla: I disagree with all of that."

I suspect this is political.
No emails are replied? No this is clearly not the Tesla I know. /s
"The car uses encrypted connection to update, so it clearly must know the correct time."
This will soon be California as well.
Wait...Countries can just opt out of daylight savings....? 
Can someone PM me if Tesla replies

"Careful, he might be in the shower…"
Not a conch. 
"So there is a timezone database you can download here: https://www.iana.org/time-zones

They are in charge if setting the timezone for the majority of computers. Either Tesla never updates this or they picked the wrong timezone for the car on accident.

In all fairness time is a super complex and politically charged subject. For instance, in Palistine Israeli and Palistini people might follow different timezone standards despite living next door.

Here's a video explaining it: https://youtu.be/-5wpm-gesOY"
Asking the right questions...
"It does. NTP doesn't deal with time zone information, it tells you the current time in UTC."
It picks up athe correct absolute time (in UTC) from a NTP server. It’s the time zone database that exists locally that’s outdated. Would need an OTA update to fix.
"It does pick up the right time, the problem is they have an out of date file in the firmware which takes this universal time and believes it should offset itself by x hours instead of x-2. They just need to update those files or update the tzdata  package. The fact they are not updating stuff like indicates their firmware build process is not patched automatically.

https://chrisjean.com/updating-daylight-saving-time-on-linux/"
"That isn’t the problem here. The problem is the time zone definition file telling it to offset the clock by an hour. It’s literally a symlink to a text file. You just have to get the right file symlinked so the clock “knows” where it is at, geographically. It probably is syncing from something. But to answer your question.....


You don’t even need a mobile network. The most accurate time source is floating all around us. Just grab a GPS signal and sync with that. 

Or you can also passively grab any CDMA signal and that’ll be accurate within 10 microseconds. As the CDMA standard requires it to be a stratum 2 time clock. "
"Because the mobile phone network is screwed too. You have to manually change your timezone twice a year.

Basically, turkey decided last minute to not do daylight savings (actually, always on daylight savings) and so everything here is fucked up. Then they did the same thing the second year, without much forewarning.

Basically the whole system is a mess. Can't really blame tesla, but having said that I would imagine they should be able to find a fix for it, so a little shitty I'm sure."
"Or better yet, lets the user set the time. The car does not need to try to be smarter than the user. "
That is not how it works. It usually queries an ntp server which returns the right time. 
"The mobile isn’t a reasonable source, they are often seconds, if not more, out. 

The real trick here is that they want the Timezone information updated, this should really be a regular process, since Timezone information is updated more frequently than you expect. "
"IIRC their infotainment system runs on Ubuntu, so they should just get the updated tzdata package and apply it in the next OTA update. Not sure how they would struggle with that."
Security issue for sure
Volvo's decision to use Android for the Polestar II OS is sounding smarter all the time. 
Tesla doesn’t like turkey. So your time is wrong. 
Why does Tesla not allow you to set the time on the clock?
Thanks. So they just need patch Tesla OS Ubuntu base and this will be it? Together we can make this happen.

Most likely debian or some own distro.
I hear Azerbaijan has a big Tesla market
"> Many of our members including me e-mailed Tesla about this and all we got was 'You are an unsupported market so we won't even update your timezone.' 

I think it's too bad that you are not getting the support you want. However, I think the answer to why this is happening is hidden in this reply right here. It may well be that Tesla (or their advisers) have come to the conclusion that if they start creating solutions for the Turkish market, the will have ""entered that market"", and therefore be obliged to provide additional support to Turkish Tesla owners, follow specific Turkish regulations etc. 

In other words, fixing a small issue in relation to Turkey might bring other consequences with it for the company. Not saying I agree with that stance, and of course I think it'd be really good if Tesla entered all markets to help move everyone to a sustainable mode of transport, but it may be the explanation. "
Have you tried emailing Turkish government too? Maybe they can go back to daylight savings. /s 
"Can pretty much guarantee that it is NOT a server-side fix, it’s a firmware fix for the car.  More specifically, they likely need to update the tzdata package on the next build of car firmware.  If my hunch is right, it’s a trivial update..."
Do you know where I can find a list of supported markets? Given how often tzdata changes it probably will not be hard to find some place that is both supported and has changed in the past two years. Unless they only support a tiny number of countries.
"If you think this is a 10 second fix, you are delusional. Software development has a process and something like this could take days or weeks to complete and validate. You are in an unsupported market, so the priority for this sort of issue is all the way at the bottom.
Your best bet is to grow your community into a large enough market to raise the priority."
"Is there any way you can cobble a hack to use an Arizona timezone as the base?  As I recall, they don't use daylight savings."
"Usually you would also have an option for manual setting of DST.  
Thats quite the oversight to not have even the most basic clock settings..."
Can you set the time on your phone? 
Thank you. 
"It definitely is funny. When people buy a Tesla for the first time and join the club, first question is usually ""I couldn't manage to adjust the clock."" Our reply is; ""Yeah it will be an hour behind."" Definitely funny in a product so good, so simple, so elegant."

"As far as i know, they are planning to officially enter Turkey Market in 2019. They were planning to enter in 2018 but Turkeys economy fucked up in a very short time period, they put Turkey on hold but they will enter in Turkey this year."
">drive my tesla to Turkey

4000 miles of water would like a word with you xD"
Haha good one. Should’ve been more than an hour then. I’ll start seeing the same issue in US soon? (It appears so)
BTW amazed at the idiots who think your in control of your country's politics. Don't feed those dogs.
I wish we just had permanent daylight saving time. Set our clocks forward an hour and then never fall back again.
"Isn't everyone a Gulenist?

I refuse to believe there are sentient creatures that prefer the current despot."
lol
If only.
So you can know what time it is when you are driving would be my guess
Nothing. This guy is effectively complain about importing a vehicle into a country Telsa doesn't support. He knew full well what he was getting into. 
Did that multiple times. With reddit's help maybe we could do something?
Time can be a surprisingly difficult problem in developing software. In this case Tesla did it right a long time ago but people changed some laws since then and they need to update the system.
"I don't know why so many are arguing for it. It is very difficult to wake up in the morning as the sun doesn't dawn until 8-:30. However at least it doesn't set at 4:30, instead it does at 5:30. Which really doesn't matter cause I'm working any way. I'd prefer to have DST."
"Sad, but typical. "
Daylight **Saving** Time is in the summer. Daylight *Savings* would be storing solar power in a Powerwall.
Because daylight savings makes no sense as a concept. 
Oh snap

"As a programmer, timezones are one thing that always make me go ""fuck. not this shit again."""
+1 for Tom Scott. Any developers dealing with this use an external library like Momentjs to handle the time zones for them. This is likely an oversight when they were developing for the Turkish market. 
Surely they could just simplify it by letting you choose your own time zone
http://yourcalendricalfallacyis.com/ good and quick read about time an date
"Samoa went from -21H Australian time to +3H in 2011, essentially [moving the International Date Line between it and American Samoa](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Samoa_islands_2002.gif). Crazy politics and economics on that move."
This also happens at the edge of every time zone in the world.
"Palestine, Palestinian"
I was gonna post that Tom Scott video. It's hilarious. And I had no idea how crazily complicated just having the correct time in an app or something could be.
North Korea too haha 
"Yup, it's up to the implementor to convert or correct the time, because all NTP does is give you a synchronized UTC."
"There actually is a mobile protocol that transmits local time zone information; it’s called NITZ and it has been part of the GSM spec since the ‘90s. The problem is that it was never reliably implemented so mobile terminal makers had to still rely on other solutions.

Source: former cellular network engineer "
You srill need a correct timezone file even with NTP.
"If the file is out of date and the time is wrong, doesn't that mean that it does not pick up the right time though?"
GPS isn't built into everything
[deleted]
"Agreed. I'm a little baffled that it doesn't allow the user to manually set the time. Seems like an odd design choice. Most electronic products running an OS allow the user to choose not to sync their system clock to a server, so it's not some revolutionary idea."
"It's not quite so simple. Fx. the logs need to be synchronized, else they are pointless. So having a coordinated time is crucial. But then you get to ""why not pick a static time zone?"" and then you have daylight savings... or more complicated scenarios :|"
"Yeah this is stupid. If I went to set my time wrong (10 minutes behind) then I should be able to. My dad used to do that because he thought it made him early or whatever, not sure if it was true, but he should have the right to do it. 

Logs are done by UTC so it doesn’t matter"
The entire point of a Tesla is the car being smarter than the user.
Same issues apply.  If they don't have the correct zones they will display the wrong time.
"They don't need to update the OS, just the tzdata package"
I think so. Educated guess.
"TIL

&#x200B;

There is in fact the issue right here [https://github.com/teslamotors/buildroot/blob/fb9fa1f65c0ffb50695d620d74249b3ca10f7583/package/tzdata/tzdata.mk#L7](https://github.com/teslamotors/buildroot/blob/fb9fa1f65c0ffb50695d620d74249b3ca10f7583/package/tzdata/tzdata.mk#L7)

"It used to be Ubuntu 10 or 12 at some point. I don't know if it still is. I didn't work with the fleet stuff, so I'm not 100% sure."
"The OS supports setting time and timezone manually, it does not need to be made specifically for Turkey. All they need to do is enable it in the existing region settings."
"unsupported market is a bullshit excuse. its not even an excuse.
what if I come from a supported market and travel with my tesla throgh an unsupported market? Do I have to live with the wrong time  while traveling because I travel to an unsupported market? Does the manual explicitly say that the car wount work properly if driven through turkey? thats some major BS.
"
"I second this, without meaning that you guys shouldn't get some kind of solution. From a business perspective,  once you create customization for one case the ball just starts rolling and all of sudden you have supported a region/country that you not yet have entered in.  This is just speculation but it might be that the MCU relies on a system clock that is synced somehow to ensure that everything is running correctly, and for that reason they don't allow for a manual time setting.

&#x200B;

As for solution for everyone, they should just make a second watch/time that can be manually set. Then anyone may use as an alternative time or second time for another place in the world."
"Except that fixing the issue only for Turkey would be tragically hard. Much easier would be to just get an updated version of the Timezone database that would fix hundreds of errors, _including_ Turkey. And guaranteed they are using an Olson based DB, especially since the underlying OS is Linux. "
They should enable a manual GMT offset option.  My wife likes to set her clocks 5min fast anyhow. 
"I support this view. Probably because of legal & resource issues they will refrain from fixing anything for an unsupported market. I’m no programmer but I am active in IT, and I’ve learned that in a corporate environment there is no such thing as a ‘10 seconds fix’. "
"You might be correct that this is their concern, but you'd think they could defend getting the time right anywhere their customers could drive to. Nobody going on a road trip from Europe to Turkey in what's supposedly a super smart car should have their clock wrong when they get there. "
"Updating the tzdata package is trivial, and should be done as part of regular OS updates.  They could accidentally fix this one. "
"This is nuts, its just a fucking time zone, no excuse not to fix it, a basic blog or a forum has time zones that work (if they are setup right)."
It could be a political thing as well. Why deal with Erdogan at all.
"Their buildroot makefile on github shows they are using tzdata from 2016, so there you go."
All of the flags you see on the site.
"Only the development environment is run by a bunch of doofuses. All the testing, validation and deployment should be automated, with A/B testing, easy rollbacks, etc. I work occasionally with life support software and the process they have is very change-accommodating and small modifications are very easy to validate and deploy incrementally, with full monitoring for “fallout” and unintended consequences. It’s jus that the process is set up to anticipate it and handle it, rather than treat normal occurrences as world-ending calamities. "
Thank you for reprehending me because I'm in a small market.
"> You are in an unsupported market

Does that mean Tesla expects nobody to drive their car from a supported market into Turkey?

There's a joke about battery range in there somewhere..."
Yes. On Android for sure. You can opt in for the network to control it or you can do it manually. 
Yes
Yes. 
Yes I’m fairly certain every phone can.

"Press the T for 10 seconds, in the code box type ""007"" - submarine mode enabled!"
Well that's the plan from what I've heard. 
"Uhm no? Gülen is of the same mind ideologically as Erdogan, probably even more islamic-conservative. They used to play on the same team and the only reason they're not anymore is because both wanted total control over Turkey for themselves, which culminated in a power struggle that Erdogan won. Erdogan opposes Gülen so people assume Gülen must be on the opposite spectrum politically. Far from it."
Link your tweet shere and maybe people will retweet them.
Elon has a history of software companies. Every software company should know to update tzdata periodically.
That is if they see this. or want to change it.
Well just simply move all jobs an hour later. Better to fix that than have a broken time system.

Hotdog not hotdog
date math and timezones in general fuck me right up. not a single one of those operations can go without being fully fucking whiteboarded.
"came here to say this. 
 
Remindes me of my hellish final project in one of my embedded systems courses that had a design requirement that said we had to implement a GPS sensor and do timezone calculations in order to get an A on the project. He spoofed a shit ton of different GPS coordinates and if they didn't all work then you wouldn't get an A on it most likely. 
 
total bullshit that we waited the last second to do and then spent all night getting working... classic"
You think timezones are bad? Read up on leap seconds.
"Thank god, nearly every program i use already needs a database connection, so i can let the DB do the maths.  

taking leap years and timezone as well as daylight saving into account can make it all very complicated.  "
Utc or bust 
"The thing is there's no Turkish Tesla market, all those cars are imported, Tesla just went full generic in this case"
Turkish Market? OP should drive to the nearest tesla service center or find a russian tesl mechanic to fix the issue. Turkey doesn’t seem to have any experts. 
[don't forget Tesla's software backend is a hilarious nightmare](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/99sbwa/former_tesla_programmers_anecdotes_about_problems/)  
"This seems like the clear best option. Default in the software's best guess, and allow it to be overridden."
"Out of all the companies, Tesla sounds like the last to let you choose your own time zone "
Or at least your own time server.
Probably not many Teslas in North Korea 
That's literally what I said
"No you don't. All NTP does is give you UTC synchronization. What you do with that information, such as time zone conversion or DST correction, happens below NTP protocols. Most NTP libraries have functions to do those corrections for you though."
"Nope, it does not work that way. The process that determines what time it is asks a time server “what is the current time?” The time server responds with a value that is in utc (universal time). The car then looks at its settings to see what time zone it is in and adds or subtracts the hours based on the tzdate information which includes daylight saving time details."
"Wow, if only we knew what hardware had this horrible, faulty clocks and we'd know if it had GPS. Like, almost-self-driving cars have GPS, of course, all of them. But this mystery hardware?"
clearly!
Tesla programmers would control what brand of toilet paper you used if they could. 
"I can see potential benefits of having the cars synced up to a ""real"" time, if they begin communicating in some way.  I agree, but most of the time this sort of thing won't happen and having a synced clock will be required for a couple of features eventually if it isn't already"
"Wow, that makes it super hard, of course. Like, imagine all the work needed to log and communicate in UTC and to display a different number as local time.

I swear, the likes of this has never even been attempted in computing!"
"Computers operate and logs are written in unix time, which is UTC. You can also display a local time for end users if you'd like."
Log time by location. Post process with time zone variations as required is the proper way of approaching this. 
"Smarter means what ever there programmer could think of.

"True, but there are a *lot* of Android users out there and issues like this won't just be a Polestar issue so, ideally, they'll get wider attention and issues addressed faster. On top of that Volvo doesn't have to devote so many resources to SW updates.

"> The OS supports setting time and timezone manually, it does not need to be made specifically for Turkey. All they need to do is enable it in the existing region settings.

Well, that may be possible. However, time and timestamps can be a tricky thing in the IT world. Without knowing any specifics in this case (making this comment pure conjecture) there could be a situation where Tesla is using the OS time and timestamps for something in relation to e.g. the neural net/autopilot (and GPS uses timestamps for accuracy if I recall correctly). Letting users muck around with those settings might then be a very bad idea."
"> what if I come from a supported market and travel with my tesla throgh an unsupported market?

Good question, the case could be made that you could make yourself liable to prosecution if you bring the wrong products or software into the wrong country. A car doesn't exactly count as a regulated weapon in most cases, but certain software can be interpreted as sensitive equipment.

For example there are cases of cryptography software that can easily fall under the us export restrictions to certain countries.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States  
This article has a  terminology section in the us export rules paragraph.

And technically, since every Tesla is using an encrypted data link when communicating with the companys servers/cloud, the case could be made that these export restrictions apply to the entire car. It's for example probably not exactly legal to sell or export them to north korea currently. Which is en extreme example, but then relations always are on a spectrum, and there might be reasons why other markets can't be supported or sold to officially.

Which might well be the reason they are very, very careful to support non-supported (and by that maybe yet non-regulated or not explicitly export-permitted) regions."
"That's very entitle. If you buy a laptop and bring it to a country without electricity, do you demand the laptop band to provide services? There are laws and regulations that any company needs to follow, and not every company is worldwide. "
It's just a case of updating the tzdata package though. There's probably other changes to timezones that haven't been applied yet either. Their build process should really automatically get the latest timezone data whenever they release a new update.
I grew up with the clocks in my parents cars always being 5 min fast. My mom went off the deep end and eventually her car's clock was 17 min fast. She was never late to anything tho...
"The reason isn’t that this is a Law of Nature or some good strategy. It’s only so because corporate IT setups are the abysmally-change-averse behemoths that use circular reasoning to support remaining change-averse. It’s precisely in big enterprise-scale IT where you could be agile with changes, do A/B testing, incremental self-training with guidance from UI, have user action monitoring and replay for UX improvement, and fix bugs proactively before anyone calls the help desk. Big corporate IT is inherently well suited to adapt to changes well, as long as it’d be set up for it – but people in charge don’t want to implement it. A small business makes rolling out changes harder than a big corporation, at a fundamental level, due to resource constraints. But everyone has gotten it fucking backwards. Were I in charge of implementing sweeping changes, corporate IT would be a much better environment than a small business. "
What makes Tesla great is that they're not in that corporate environment.
"> Nobody going on a road trip from Europe to Turkey in what's supposedly a super smart car should have their clock wrong when they get there.

Yep, true that."
And probably will once someone else that is in a “supported” market updated there Timezone info. 
"> They could accidentally fix this one.

You mean they would inadvertently eliminate a feature? :-D

Jokes aside, let's hope they do.  "
"Right, I checked all the tzdata updates since September 2016 against the list of supported countries. There was only one match: a tiny town in Alaska with population ~1200, which has a weird timezone. If someone can convince Tesla that they live in Metlakatla then maybe a tzdata update will happen but probably not as there aren't even any chargers in Alaska."
I'm just telling you about the reality of software development. It's not as simple as you think it is.
"You're not in a market that's the problem.  To fix this, Tesla has to modify every one of our Teslas too, hundreds of thousands of cars updated for a market that they don't have.  They haven't even fixed the media app for all of us in years."
"No, but they just clearly state they won't support that use case. When that guy imported his Model 3 to Europe before official support, he got none.

It'd be ideal if Tesla opened up timezone selection, but then that becomes a much bigger feature change involving a lot more work. When this only truly affects a handful of customers, it's not going to be prioritized."

No cap. 
"- Have an internal synced UTC clock
- User set time is just an offset from that synced UTC clock

Problem solved :)"
"You're missing the point. If the user sets the time to 10:00 then the time of that vehicle is based on that point in time when it was set. Not relative to the time zone itself. And if not set to locale then Daylight savings changes are not represented, then the local logs of the car don't match logs from other cars."
"Ok, misunderstood what you meant by 'set time'. Setting time != setting time zone != setting time zone locale."
This isn't an Ubuntu issue for Tesla and wouldn't be an Android issue for Volvo.  They'd still have to update the operating system themselves and if they don't then there will be no updates - like many phones stop getting them even though android never stops getting updated.

"The time is not wrong in OPs car. Internally the kernel uses UTC, and it has the correct time available for it. The *display* of the time is wrong because the OS is using an outdated timezone package (which takes the UTC time and applies the correct offset to display the time in that timezone)."
"GPS satellites broadcast the time according to their _extremely_ accurate atomic clocks. The time signal encoded within the broadcast is the basis of the method of location acquisition.

An astute counter argument.

Nope. Tesla sells to us officially from the Netherlands and even files an export declaration to go along with the car. We just do the import & registration ourselves. Cars all have warranty and are not US greymarket cars like in Russia or Ukraine. We know we’re a non core market but clock is pretty trivial. 
"Or it's a person fabricating a story. We have literally no way of knowing without some kind of verification. Corporate leaks in the past have come accompanied with pictures of staff badges, ID numbers, pay stubs, hell- even a picture in his office would have been better than nothing.

My guess would be the auto pilot. You gave the cameras but can't use it because it's software locked.

"Utc is annoying because its only ""right"" for one time zone but at the end of the day its a fucking lifesaver once you learn your offset.

"Battery too, like all 90's are restricted 100's"
The very act of acquiring a GPS fix requires an accurate clock on the satellites and on the fixing end. I'm not entirely sure the point you're attempting to make with that definition of programming.
This whole post is about people wanting to be able to change the time on the clock to match their time zone. It’s kinda helpful to have all your clocks match each other.
"He's speculating based on logic. It seems perfectly reasonable.

 I'll go ahead and point out OP never said anything about the Turks nuking anyone. "
True true. I do agree that at least let the user manually change the clock. Probably easiest fix. 
Haha yeah the global utc offsets are what make it so easy to rely on as a reference point. Sanity checking an app/system/infra bug and coming across conflicting timestamps is an automatic free pass to drink on the job.
That's a very specific use case :D
"Too detailed to be completely made up maybe, but could easily be exaggerated, or only contain part of the truth. No way to know. I'm a developer so I could make up some really specific, plausible, technical sounding, complete bullshit if I wanted to."
Didn't pay for 100 so you don't get 100. ICE guys have chips on them to reduce performance. Isn't that the same?
"The programmers might not have used the GPS signal to acquire their clock. That's been my point this entire time. You keep missing it.

And if Tesla was a better software company they would fix their build processes to pull in the latest tzdata when releasing a new build.

"In Los Angeles, since getting my Model 3 in July, I've had exactly one interaction with another Tesla owner next to me (smile and thumbs up).  Everyone else I look over at are looking straight ahead like some kind of safe driver.  The only other Tesla wave I got from another owner was before I got my car, while driving a Model 3 rental in MN."
"Depends on where you live.  This is already the case in the SF Bay Area, especially in the Peninsula and Silicon Valley.  We call Teslas the ""Silicon Valley Camry"" given it's the ""cheap"" car compared to the likes of Ferrari, Buggati, McLauren, etc.

I often wonder if the Model S is the single most common specific car in Santa Clara County.  There are definitely way more non-Teslas than Teslas around here still, but for a specific model, I bet the S would rank pretty high.  The other day I counted 11 Teslas (about 8 were model S) in a row in the carpool lane going South on 85 at the end of a work day.  That's my highest count so far.  I forget the exact number but if I allowed one or two non-Teslas in the count it would have been even higher.  "
"A long time.

I'm optimistic EVs are the future, but I doubt they'll go mainstream (i.e., Toyota Corolla/Camry/RAV4 levels of ownership) until another decade or two. They're too pricey for now, and not viable in places outside of denser urban areas like on the West Coast. I do not see those problems being remedied until *at least* another decade.

However, I *do* see hybrid vehicles (particularly sedans) gaining a massive foothold in the next decade. The MPG gap between a CUV/SUV and a sedan has tightened since the past decade, but the gap between a CUV/SUV and a *hybrid* sedan is still large.

"Hey, I noticed this too and have fitted doors before. The door panels are actually well aligned, [as evidenced by the evenness of the bend on both doors meeting very nicely](https://imgur.com/2HVscF0.jpg). Same with at the top. It's the trim (shiney metal/plastic pieces), and is honestly unimpressive given it most likely left the factory like this. It's definitely better than having a door sag over time, but someone okayed this. 

Apparently it's a common issue with Tesla's, which sucks as I'm a huge fan of these cars. It probably wouldn't stop me from buying one but it's something to keep in mind."

Same. I always look over at other Teslas but they never look back.
I see almost as many people driving a model 3 as driving a Prius in West LA. People might just start to avoid it since it's too much. 
"I currently drive a big V8 truck to pull a camper. I'd *love* for someone to release a big electric truck to replace my big V8 truck at a price within 5k of my current truck. It's of course not the big crossovers and SUVs that are the problem, it's what's powering them. The market wants these bigger vehicles. "
I guess people just want bigger cars to haul stuff
"> On a side note: Gosh, I wish we would stop buying giant crossovers and SUVs. At this rate, we're all going to be driving monster trucks by the end of 2030.

People are using their vices for more than just a simple commute to work with a single driver. So they are buying a slightly larger vehicle with a bit more room. Please calm down with the mister truck rhetoric."

If all you need is the towing capacity though (and not the size/space of a big truck/suv) why not get a Model X?

"I'm aware the markets want these larger vehicles. I'm just not a fan.

Things like the Subaru Crosstrek and Mazda CX-3 (as examples) bother me. They're just lifted hatchbacks (Impreza and Mazda2, respectively), but with a higher price tag. Large ""sporty"" SUVs like the GLC ""Coupe"" and BMW X6 sacrifice practicality for cool looks (fastback roof cutting into cargo and headroom, tighter suspensions for better handling but rougher rides, lower ground clearance for lower center of gravity, etc.), defeating the whole purpose for an SUV.

I know it's not my job to tell people what to do with their money, but the irrationality of the market irks me. At least trucks aren't trying to be things they're not (e.g., sports cars); they remain dedicated to their underlying purpose as a utility vehicle.

We're at a point where [Volvo is considering just taking one of their standard sedans](https://jalopnik.com/crossover-sedans-are-coming-and-you-cant-do-a-damn-thin-1826770915), and raising it up a few inches so they can call it a crossover and reap the sales boost. *sigh*"
Our next EV will likely be a Rivian to replace our ICE Sequoia.  Gotta have at least one big vehicle in the family for haulin' kids and stuff.
Perhaps that will improve when anyone makes anything comparable.

Massachusetts do have those massholes
Can they get arrested or fined for harassment?
This aggression makes no sense to me. How is their truck lifestyle affected by an EV driver?

"Stop making stupid people famous, it’ll only escalate. "
This is starting to become an us vs them thing... Just read some of these comments which include vandalism and blocking them in. Don't get mad by doing something equally petty. This will only get worse. Let the fad blow over and handle it like adults if it happens to you. Call a tow truck if you have to.
Important that Tesla owners don't feed into the tribalistic us vs them mindset. We need these people to eventually come around to sustainable transport. It does not benefit us in the long run to turn this into an escalating battle
Why are they being considerate enough to park so well inside the lines? Each of those trucks could be blocking 2-3 spaces easily...

Massholes
Visible plates on those trucks. Time to send the local PD an email or some sort to log it in to their database. So whenever it comes up again some Good samaritan will follow suit. 
Just because your car is smaller doesn’t mean you’re smaller. People shouldn’t take harassment so easily. I’d park my car right behind them and wait for us both to get towed

"Just so everybody knows, Mass has legislature that allows towns to deal with this. https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleVII/Chapter40/Section22a

Is it me, or when you look close, do those trucks look empty? I'm not sure I actually believe this story. It just looks like a few guys with really small johnsons parked in the EV spots and walked away."
This behavior is some Russian troll incited silliness. 
MA is one of the few states where it's illegal to block a charging station. I'd call the police. At minimum they could get ticketed.
How small does your dick have to be to make this a part of your day? Holy shit
When Tesla truck comes out u could tow them out
"Fighting jerks like this head-to-head can only make things worse.  If this is a repeat occurrence at this particular Supercharger, I think the best course of action would be to:

1.  Share the photos with the property owner and ask if they will set up a towing contract for the spots and post signs with a number to call.

2.  Share the photos with the local municipality to encourage an ordinance like we have in Raleigh making parking in an EV charging spot without charging a ticket-and-tow offense.  This applies to EVs, as well, which I think shows a lot of foresight."

""what kind of vehicles do you think everyone should drive? do you think everyone should drive trucks? what about electric trucks?""

""are there any electric vehicles that you support?""

""what is it about electric vehicles that bothers you?""

and just be courteous and curious when asking the questions. don't ask snarky or confrontational questions. pretend you're with the local news station. it would be even better if you had a notebook to write answers in, like a reporter might."

You have photographic evidence of disorderly conduct along with clear license plates. Seems like a law enforcement slam dunk.
Maybe they are using the chargers to charge their high powered flesh lights.
I own a big truck. I cant wait for all vehicles to be electric. Its not like trucks will disappear or something. I use my truck as a utility vehicle not for mudding or other shit.

Tesla should accommodate super chargers with an adapter that extends the cord maybe 15 feet for instances like this so they can park a few spots down and still charge. Drivers could carry personal extenders. 
"I have a truck

I also have a Tesla

Each has its purpose;
These people are not the standard, so stop promoting some anti-truck driver shit. We’re all people in the end. 

If this were to happen to me, I’d just let them know Tesla is a 100% American company as of now. Let them know why I drive it and also let them know why I also think trucks are cool and can be extremely helpful. 

Be civil, people. Spreading ‘truck people are stupid’ is the damn reason you have them wanting to fight back. And if your argument is ‘they started it’ you need to grow up. There’s assholes everywhere in the world and the best solution is never stooping to their level."
Look up “Disorderly Conduct” it’s a crime and it seems to fit this situation. 
So what’s up with the dark colored trucks having matching ‘Mint’ stickers on their back windows?
"I would report this charging location to Tesla via the executive email form on your account page, and also contact the above store management for the business that the chargers are located at. "
Just call the police. It’s that easy. 
Just wait till one of their buddies gets a Tesla pickup and they get awestruck from having such an antiquated automobile.
"I think the best reaction is to film them and laugh as much as you can. Make sure they see.

If they're that obnoxious, call the police. They don't need to break any specific laws or be charged or towed or anything... just call and describe the situation and say you feel unsafe. I'm certain an officer will stop by and talk to them."
I but late but what is the point of doing this? What do the people in the trucks gain from this? It’s so pointless and I’m genuinely curious
They should be towed. 
Just ignore them for now. We need a better way to address these issues long-term. 
"Here in Texas, I haven't seen any of this at all.  Is it mostly rednecks in the north-east?

Do they literally just go drive trucks over to superchargers, and sit around waiting to heckle someone who, frankly, is probably just mildly inconvenienced until they leave?"
"Park the Tesla in front of them blocking them in the spot. ""Sorry bucko the battery's dead so I guess you're stuck here too... """
Those tires look pretty expensive...
i want to know why they dislike Tesla. ask them and please record.
"Stand in front of the trucks, try to ensure the drivers see you, spit in your hands and wave them in a fanciful pattern, mumble some mumbo-jumbo, then stop and bow.

Then write a note and place one on each truck. Get in your car and drive away.

The note states, ""You have done evil. Thus I have placed upon you a Corey Hauler curse invoked by my dead gypsy grandmother. By end of 2019 will bring bad things.""

You'd be surprised what people believe - they won't be able to shake the feeling they've been cursed for the remainder of the year. "
I really wanna hear the reasoning for this from one of these idiots.
They just need a roof over it so the big trucks can't fit

I guess I don't understand has anyone asked them why? I want a dialog they have to be confused of something 
no doubt they're bunch of hyenas-coward to go alone!
"Funny there is another post about this as I was thinking yesterday about the previous one posted a week or so ago. I was thinking that the equivalent an electric car owner could do is park their car at the gas pump and then go inside to buy your food and drinks. It's tit for tat, but kind of funny too. They'd get a bit of their own medicine.

I'm the other hand, yeah it's not worth cowering to their level. BTW, this is coming from a gas vehicle owner. "
I don’t understand why people do this. I can not grasp it. 
Descendants of the guys that yelled “get a horse” every time they say a car having trouble.  Amazingly anti-American to attack the first new US car maker in a century.  The US itself was a political innovation and has always celebrated hard work and creativity.  Are these guys Communists?  Or just really anti American?
The type of people to complain of someone is blocking the diesel pump. (If those are diesel trucks) 
As someone who drives a pickup truck I do not condone this behavior and as soon as I can get a Tesla pick up I will
If only a tesla semi could pull up behind them and block them all in...
"As someone who drives a pickup and can't wait for the Tesla one, I'm sorry. This brings shame on our house."
"I can tell you that as a diesel-powered pickup truck owner myself, this is completely stupid. I may have the range on any of the Tesla's, even those particular trucks, but that's no excuse for childish immature behavior like that. I say to them, ""Grow up, get a hobby; live and let live.""
Much love for performance no matter how it's reached, much love for great cars/trucks!"
I mean that model X has a lot of torque might be able to move those trucks haha.
"Do people call the cops for things like this?   Like if someone parked their car at a gas station and blocked a lane and refused to move it, you know they would be calling someone to tow the car blocking. "
What do you think would happen if EV owners started boxing in gas stations?

I mean, I wouldn’t do it myself, but I also won’t call the cops on some guy getting petty revenge on a big douche bag cunt. I don’t know what my point is but happy new year anyways!"
Who has the fucking time for this bullshit?
They want a fight. Don’t give it to them. They will eventually get bored and go away. 
This is so sick. So sad what people have become.  😕
So can you get an “extension cord” and double park them ? 
Dumbass fucking rocks. These people vote. Good god America's intellectual vacuum is alarming sometimes.
I wonder what these guys think of Rivian.... Lol

Hah! Yeah right "
These are the type of people who road rage for a living
You’ve got to be a special kind of stupid to do this. 
It boggles my mind people have enough free time that doing something like this tops their list of stuff to do
You should get a bunch of Teslas to park in a semicircle around them and block them in.
Seriously.  This is harassment.  The police should be involved 
"1. Approach and ask them to move.
2. Wait for them to say ""f\*\*K you"" or ""f\*\*k Tesla"" or whatever else their pea brains can muster.
3. Call the police.

I'm sure some of this depends on what state you're in.  But by getting that response, you've forced them to declare their intentions. Hopefully in most places that should be enough for the cops to assist.

If they aren't around, try to get them towed.  "

"We need to start calling the police as soon as we witness this. There are plenty of other solutions that aren't legal, that is the one that is. Don't just say they are blocking spots, say a confrontation is occurring in a public lot and police are needed before it escalates."
"Also, report them to the DMV. Driving is a privilege and they should no longer be allowed that privilege."
"I'm honestly baffled as to why they do this like are they jelous that someone has a SIGNIFICANTLY nicer car than them or are they scared of the future where you can't hear the engine or you can't hear who is the biggest dickhead, like imo this is absolutely ridiculous. "

"Wow, Trumpians want to make America great again, even Tesla's are inmigrants now. "
"I wonder what they'd do if someone parked behind them, blocking them in"
"It’s because they know Tesla is the future. Their trucks will one day not exists and it pisses them,so they throw a tantrum by parking in charge spots "
I don’t advocate violence or destroying property but man I’d be slinging some dog shit or shooting some frozen paintballs at these asses. 
Buy a MAGA hat and go yell at them. They’ll be so confused. 
"Living in spite: the modern GOP asshole... they live to try to set off liberals and see Tesla as a threat for some idiotic reason. It's absolutely pathetic. It's not even sad. I own a truck and really like seeing electric cars on the road. I use that truck for carrying my stuff for my hobbies on the weekends. Guaranteed, these idiots have trucks to spite people who are doing their part to reduce their carbon footprint, and nothing else. Idiots. Sad, pathetic idiots. "
"I love how they park within the lines. I mean, if I was gonna do this I'd at least park parallel to the curb and block at least 2 spots with my truck.

I would slash every single one of their tires and then run away so they have no idea who it was. See how long they laugh dealing with that hassle.
Why aren't these trucks just towed? 
Why these fuckers got to give us rednecks a bad name. I'm just sitting here waiting on a Tesla pickup truck that could handle farm work. I'd buy in a heart beat and know dudes that would jump on it too. 
Stop whining and call a tow truck. It's tiring seeing these posts every day
Drive your car up across the back of them parking them in. When they return and can’t get out apologise saying you ran out of charge

Thanks for including the plates. These fuckers deserve to be locked up. 
For a second I thought the white truck had a Tesla sticker on the rear window.
I've seen these kinds of posts daily here. Do we know what these guys have got against Tesla?
WTB impact wrench that plugs into the charger cable.  These assholes won't get far without any lug nuts.
The more media coverage these assholes get the more assholes will start thinking this is a good idea.  There seems to be a bunch of these recently and I can’t help but think it’s related to news outlets picking up the story last week.

"What is the camera situation in most of these supercharging areas? Is there a standard?

"I really hate those predatory tow companies, but perhaps they can be put to good use. They are very good at removing offending vehicles quickly, even with irate owners shouting at them. Tesla you listening? Time to start managing the charging stations and towing away offenders."
"Well, their license plates are sitting right there in the open. Seems like they could potentially receive a visit for law enforcement for their threats. Land of the free, home of the brave... or not. Ironic that in America's cradle of liberty there are those who would deny others the freedom to operate an alternative kind of vehicle. "
I bet they work in the oil industry and they feel their way of life is being threatened. Same thing happened in the 80s with the popularity of Japanese cars.
I personally would be totally fine with an electric pickup. The torque alone would be awesome. 
I dont get it...
As a goof somebody should chain their front axels all together. Only as a goof though. 
They’re obviously threatened.
"They have “mint.” stickers on their trucks. It’s probably some local high school or college kids that think it’s funny. They’ll bore quickly and proceed to getting train horns or rolling coal at stop lights soon enough.

Like why do you care so much you would go out of your way to do this. "
"General Laws Section 22A of chapter 40.
A city or town acting pursuant to this section with respect to ways within its control, or pursuant to the authority granted by chapter 40A with respect to zoning, may regulate the parking of vehicles by restricting certain areas or requiring that certain areas be restricted for the parking of a zero emission vehicle. An ordinance, by-law, order, rule or regulation pursuant to this paragraph may contain a penalty of not more than $50 and, in a city or town that has accepted section 22D, may provide for the removal of a vehicle pursuant to said section 22D.

"Hate those types of people, only furthering the stigma that “all pickup drivers are assholes”

Not all of them...."
Can’t you record what they’re doing & their license plates and show this to the police? I’m not a lawyer but this can’t be okay... like this can easily escalate 
"I'm sorry to see this happening again. Ignorance is everywhere. The best solution is to report this to the property owner, who will ask them to leave or tow them. In my case in Hickory, NC, Sheetz was the property owner and they were prompt to ask them to unblock the chargers. I'm really hoping this doesn't become a trend. Hopefully, as EVs become increasingly popular, fines will be associated with this kind of behavior. "
In Rhode Island the ICEers can get ticketed and towed by local or state police under the places where parking prohibited statute. 
I really hope someone parks their Tesla pickup there. It would make their trucks look tiny.
Gad dem backwood country white disrespectful assholes.
"Theoretically, couldn’t an MX carry a chain around and use it to drag any of those trucks wherever it wanted? Not, saying they should, but I’d laugh my ass off."

Let the air out of their tires.  No real vandalism or permanent damage.
"You have lots of torque, just need a tow cable "
"the cars can all log in, the truck cannot, automated pictures of places should be able to mandate fines.... paintballs could be dispensed that are hard to wash... so many solutions... "
These guys really hate Americans companies. 
I don't get it... Why do this? 
Can’t electric and combustion just get along? There is enough room for both and I think both (and hybrid) have different strengths and weaknesses. I will probably always choose combustion mainly because I love the sound of a car and the idea that I know mostly what is going on under the hood.

What a pretentious thing to say. 
"To be honest, the fuck you was probably because of the NY plates. "
But why?
It’s crazy to me that this was taken on a phone.. and pretty far away.. yet I can still zoom in on each license plate
I believe the only real response is to park your Tesla in front of the diesel pump.

I don’t have a Tesla but I do have a plug-in hybrid vehicle. There has been a few times now that gas only vehicles have been parked in EV spots which is in the most expensive lot where I work. It makes me absolutely irate. I don’t have any idea how to handle it either.

Instead of getting upset or angry, we need to celebrate the growing demand for electric pickups as shown by these people and share photos on social media of their TRUE desires.

tl;dr change the social media narrative to be that these owners subliminally WISH their trucks were electric which is why they park at EV charge points - laugh at them, don’t get angry!

These guys probably don't know how (in)frequent Supercharger stations are and are probably trying to have harmless amusement.  It's immature, but let's take the high road.  Why not just say ""hey dude, that's a nice truck.  You take it off-roading around here?  I'm looking for some good trails myself.."" and then explain that you need to charge up to get on your way and would sure appreciate it if they could make room for ya.

Electric vehicle owners need to educate people on the rarity of charging stations, as nobody (okay, very few) people are actually mean enough to really try to hurt someone by stranding them.  Oh, and EV people need to not act like jerks...I don't want to be associated with the latte limousine liberal (or any version of liberal!) image."

"In their minds they are preventing the downfall of big oil, saving jobs, and protecting America from libtards. "
Sadly I think these guys feel put upon. Flyover country and all. The Tesla represents the liberal elite in their eyes. That’s all it is. And lower IQs which should be pitied not hated. 
"Honestly, if you have a tow cable and a hook you could just pull them away with your tesla."

They're probably from a small rural town. They've got nothing better to do then drink and compare their insufficient reproductive organs.

They are probably being paid to do this for the fossil fuel industry.  Its like climate change denial.  Follow the money.
"To be fair, the batteries in Tesla cars pollute more over their lifetime than a diesel truck does, by a wide margin.

They're effectively eco-activists."
“How little do they value their *penis* ?”
Same reason you have trolls on the internet. Feels good getting people riled up. 
"To be fair, their lifestyle and/or hobby has been under attack by the Tesla crowd.  The push for CAFE standards, additional taxes/fees for truck owners, emissions standards and so on.  This is a peaceful form of protest."
People who do shit like this don't use logic and aren't reasonable.
"They hate ""made in america"" and are trying to show their support for foreign oil sheikhs."
Wasn’t there a study that provided a textbook definition of stupidity as something like “causing problems for others with no discernible benefit to themselves.”   I think this qualifies.

"They're fucking petrol head losers. I love ICEs as much as any typical ""car guy."" But EVs are fucking awesome in their own ways. I love them both.

But these guys think gas is superior somehow. Like you arent a man unless you get <20 mpgs. Just because it makes basically zero noise, it must be a vehicle designed for ""pussies."" Because no one can hear you 3 blocks away and it doesnt run rich and stink up the whole neighborhood when you start it in the morning because you dont maintain it, you must be less than human, and not have the same rights as a truck driver.

"My guess is that they hate liberals and they assume that bleeding heart, environmentally conscious liberals are the only people that own electric cars, which is asinine. My guess is that they’re looking for conflict and an excuse to fight a lib. They clearly aren’t employed, so I wouldn’t be shocked if some of them are on welfare."
"They think EV Cars their owners, including Teslas, are Pu$$ies and ""snowflakes"" so they bully them. Meanwhile, I'd love to see a model x hitch up to the pickup and rip it's frame off the body. Anybody want to make a youtube video?"
Same reason bullies pick on innocent kids with lots of books. Fear.
They're inbred hicks. They aren't known for there reasoning ability. What's really scary is these chucklefucks vote.
They have small pee pees and need to compensate by harassing others 
"Living in rural TN, I expect they believe that one day someone is going to come take their trucks for being too polluting. Someone has been fear mongering them. It’s the same 2nd Amendment mentality, but with gas vehicles. They see it as a way to protest. "
All those trucks are 10+ years old and worth no more than $15k or so
"Those trucks are all quite old and likely nowhere near the value of a model 3. 

"
Those trucks arent new though.
"Different people, you hit the nail on the head for this and basically all of humanity. "
Why do these same types of idiotic dipshits hang out in Dunkin’ Donuts parking lots and 7-11’s all god damn night and smoke their cigarettes and annoy the hell out of everyone? These guys are such douches 
no these are 10 year old trucks owned by what im guessing is some 20 year old who thinks cutting his muffler to sound like a dirt bike is cool. also 5 inch exhaust tips.... you might as well be attaching the dumpster that is your life to that exhaust tip. 
"It's pretty simple.  If electric car advocates are correct, then the truck owners are forced to consider the repercussions of their actions.  That's a no-no"
Trolling teens. 
"I don't get the irrational hate between Tesla and pickups. I drive both, and a 3 owner decided to purposely slow down next to a truck so I couldn't pass, go a few miles and blast it to make his exit on the other side of the truck.. Never encountered this when it was all just S and X around."
Trucks are cheaper when you claim them as farm vehicles or don't pay your taxes cause you don't think taxes are legal.

This is how we end up with so many laws that seem frivolous later
True harassment requires a pattern of behavior.  Being an ass to other people as a one-off event is not a crime by itself.  Believe me when I say that we want it this way.
"In Massachusetts cities are given the option of enforcing the state law of a fine less than or equal to $50 and a towing if the spot is designated zero emission and the parked car is not electric, hybrid, or fuel cell. "
Yes. I posted the law in this thread for Massachusetts.
I would just get a couple Tesla drivers to park length-wise behind their trucks and have a stand-off. 
They can get their tires slashed
Here in the UK you get fined for parking a non electric car in an charging space. IDK if it’s the same in the US but if it’s not I feel like I should by now. 
"> Can they get arrested

Jesus christ man, just have them towed.

"They likely view EV owners as liberals.  As macho truck owners who are Republicans, they love to piss off liberals.

Kinda reminds me of people getting irrationally angry about soccer. 
"The goons who drive these trucks are usually staunch conservatives, and the EV industry is in direct competition to the oil industry - the backbone of conservative politics and tradition. Simple stuff. "
Reduced demand for fuel leads to lower fuel prices for their gas guzzlers. Oh wait...

They think all these charging stations are free. 
"I am not defending their rage in any way, but if they’re farmers then it disrupts the “ethanol as fuel” thing and potentially their careers. It’s something we’ve considered living rurally, the farmers don’t like EVs because they grow corn to produce ethanol. "
"Thanks, was trying to figure out which one that was. I grew up out that way, so I could likely find out who they are through some friends with access to that information. But it's just not worth it...

That location is really convenient for when I go out that way to visit family. If they are blocking and I need to charge, that's when I'm going to take matters into my own hands!"
"Hadley, no surprise here. Mommy and Daddy bought their trucks for them so they can play fake redneck."
"If I was there, I'd block all the spaces with my truck and move it only to let the S3X's in and out.

"I agree. Most bullies will stop (albeit, after awhile) when they don’t get the reaction they’re looking for. Typical behavior analysis, don’t give attention when attention is desired. "
"You're completely right but at the same time the behavior won't change if they aren't shown it's wrong in some form or another. The only way they get towed is if the person who actually owns the property gives enough of a shit to have them towed. Other than that, nothing happens, they continue doing this, and the only people who have to just take it are Tesla owners."
Tesla needs to have a number to call where they will dispatch a tow truck.  They rent the property and that spot is theirs- just as if someone parked in my spot at my office where I rent.  Its no different- Tesla can allow you to be on their property or tow you for not being a Tesla.  
"The problem is that these assholes could really be putting people in harm’s way. Imagine if someone needs to recharge on the way to work. It could affect their employment, their livelihood. "
"It's just natural. This made my blood boil for about a half second when I first saw it.

Then I thought about it for a few more seconds and imagined parking patiently behind one of the teslas waiting for your turn to charge and then giving the guys in the trucks a pleasant smile and wave when you see them might make them feel pretty dumb. And even if it doesn't, at least you've not let them effect your blood pressure."
Well said. 
"Anyone who went through grade school knows that ""smile and turn the other cheek"" doesn't work with bullies. If they're not getting the reaction they want, they'll just fuck with you harder.

They need negative consequences applied to them. Now I don't advocate taking matters into your own hands. Call those who are trained to deal with belligerent behavior, i.e. the police."
People are blowhards on the keyboard.  None of these posters would ever do more than take a picture and post angry comments about them on Reddit (and that's a good thing).

"Not a southern thing. This is happening in every state. Unfortunately, trucks and SUVs are the best selling cars throughout America. "
I feel like it's every state outside of CA pretty much. There's a LOT more SUVs and trucks in general in other places.
"Is there really no use for them? Or the people just drive them as an image thing? Never been to SC so I wouldn’t know, that’s why I ask."
This is Massachusetts not the south. The pinnacle of civilization. The east coast equivalent to the Bay Area. And you’re commenting from South Carolina represented by Lindsey graham as if you have room to talk shit. 
How do you know they have no use for them? 
This could be used to make an official looking warning ticket that tells them that they will be towed if they do it again. Will definitely scare of the majority of people from doing it again. 
ICEing fines are surprisingly low. A $50 ticket would be less of a deterrent and more of a show of pride for people who purposely inconvenience EV owners. 
"“oh wait... nevermind... we all probably have better things to do”

Because Tesla owners are better than everyone else? Maybe that’s the reason people think of them as pretentious and smug.  It’s the whole Prius thing all over again "
"This should be higher up, this is the route to go down. 

Might also be worthwhile informing Tesla of an issue that is being experienced here, on top of the authorities and the landowner here (I.E if this is on a mall complex). 

Basically, record, let everyone know, and let the system do its job. "

Remember to leave the valves on their cars to keep it at just a vandalism charge as opposed to theft and vandalism.
"I've never had the nerve to do it, but I think it might be faster to use small cutting pliers to snip the valve stem.  

Doing so would require the tire be dismounted and remounted to affect the repair, but wouldn't damage the tire, as opposed to some of the comments suggesting tire-slashing.

They’d get stolen. I have a Prius Plug-in and some asshole threw a brick through my window and stole the charger. $850 to replace from the dealer. Haven’t replaced it yet either. 
Amen. 
"Let's change context

You have been on the road 9 hours on a trip so far. You aren't even close to the destination. The son will not stop kicking the daughter, and the 7 month old has NOT stopped screaming. You need one last charge to get home, and you pull up to this. The baby is howling at this point and sounds like it might choke to death. The son pukes on the daughter because lunch didn't sit well.

And now there are no open stalls and a bunch of trucks blocking charging with rednecks hooting at you the whole way. 

If you can be civil in this situation, you are an Adonis of a man"
I'm sure they are part of a club or group.
"I'm going to copy and paste what I put in another thread, because I think it applies equally to this one.

The problem with just ignoring it and pretending it's not happening is that there is an actual need to charge... If these guys were parked in regular spots and were pestering me about my car while I'm charging, it's easy to ignore because it's not really impacting me, as I'm still charging and I'll be gone in 20-30 mins.

If I'm on a long distance drive and need to charge, this stuff is directly impacting me. Not because they're yelling at me, but because they're blocking charging stalls. No amount of ignoring will charge my car... Ignoring is fine when it's a minor inconvenience to you, but when you actually need to charge to continue your drive, ignoring it does nothing except prolong my drive further."
"> Again if they realized they get flat tires every time they park there they will probably stop doing this.

Or, unfortunately, they'd escalate to vandalizing EVs instead of just wasting their time mildly inconveniencing EV drivers. Keep in mind EV drivers have done nothing to bother or offend these people and they _still_ hate them enough to waste their clearly valuable time for the chance to block a librul out of a charging spot."
It would be glorious if some local Tesla fans parked them in! Definitely would say have a dashcam/cameras on hand for the ensuing rage.

Your comment disgusts me. Likely the truck owners in this picture think similar stereotypes about EV drivers. Makes you no better than them. 
They associate any progress with liberals and they believe liberals are enemies of America.

A friend of mine works with a guy who has a Tesla.  Currently Tesla is not an option for my friend because he needs an actual truck (and teslas truck from everything I've seen so far won't be an option for most people who actually need a truck its more of a luxury item than the type of thing you drive out across a field.)  co-worker constant gives him shit because he has a gas engine vehicle.  He's actually posted a a 45 minute Facebook live stream of his co-worker yelling at him about needing a truck.  What's bad is in the area they live their are 0 chargers.  They work both 45ish miles away from where the guy lives.  And using your vehicle for work is par for the course and asshat constantly has to have others drive him around because he doesn't know if he'll have charge to make it home.  Like every afternoon.  And in the cars of the other employees, he's always telling them how shitty their vehicle is.  And per boss when they go to check sites, they have to bring him and swing by his sites.  So I can see Trevor doing this because at this point he hates everything EV because of this guy."
The naivete of this comment really can't be overstated.

A license plate isnt really personally identifiable.  There is a federal law that prevents the states from making the registration info public.

"I don't mean to offend here but generally the only people who think that ""flyover"" states are just piles of white trash gas stations and Trump signs where nobody would want to live, have only experienced coastal or major cities.

I don't think you realize how well trucks hold their value. 
You’re right. These are all early/mid 2000s model trucks. Probably have a shit ton of miles on them too. Rednecks love to dump $15k in accessories on a $10k truck rather than buying a $25k truck.
"Trucks hold their value incredibly well. There being lots of demand for them helps.

Same goes for high resale values of cars from certain Japanese automakers, like Toyota, Honda, and Subaru. Lots of demand for them in the used market."

"> do you support the use of taxpayer funds to jail these people?

Yes!  The marginal cost of throwing someone in jail, inconveniencing them, adding an arrest record for being an asshole, and giving them a good towing charge is zero. The police department is already paying the officers today, it doesn't cost any extra to take care of a few extra assholes.

More importantly, note that a towing company can't do anything to an occupied car."

It’s not about fuel prices. It’s about ideology.
"Actually, it would only reduce prices temporarily. As fuel is less needed, there will be fewer suppliers in the market, which will make prices rise.

It's kinda like why diesel is more expensive than gas in the US. It makes up less of the market when compared to gas. Even more so when you compare gas to something like racing fuel or AvGas"

Tesla should build a fleet of electric Towtrucks to tow non-electric vehicles from electric car only parking spot.
" Those are just regular parking spots. Unless whoever owns that property wants to tell the truck drivers they are trespassing and the drivers don't leave, there isnt any repercussion for their actions. Not all tesla charge stations are at a tesla owned facility."
"In Massachusetts that's $108.00 for the hook and $3.50 per mile round trip from lot to pickup and back after the first 5 miles plus 1.6% fuel surcharge, $35.00 per day vehicle storage, and ~$11 lien process fee. Depending on the location, that's upwards of $200.00 - so if it's worth that much to you to temporarily inconvenience Tesla drivers, then be our guest. *Literally* :p"

This is a huge myth that Harleys are loud. Harely, like any other american MOCO must meet noise regulation standards. And HD actually falls well below the noise regulation standards on most models. and Every model falls within the EPA noise regulation. 

***Otherwise they literally could not sell them.***

Infact the biggest complaint of many EFI harley bikes are that they sound like Sewing machines. They are no louder than your average Chevy Camero.

PLUS the 1st party exhaust upgrade that harley sells for people who want something louder is STILL well within EPA regulations for noise and emissions. 

The loud motorcycles you're thinking of are the Modified ones, in which someone is voiding their warranty, and by the way, it's not just a Harley thing. Almost every motorcycle on the road today has an avalible non EPA regulated aftermarket exhaust system avalbile to it. From the Honda Grom to the Panigale.

Lots of motorcycles replace their exhaust for louder noise. And you maybe mistaking a lot of bikes for harleys because basically the entire cruiser market of these motorcycles copied harley's styling and have been doing so for decades now.

But no. These retards are actively trying to make the planet a worse place in ""protest."" More than likely they have small dicks or wallets and are envious. And obviously unemployed if they have all the time in the world to do this kind of thing. 

I install solar panels for a living. This is kind of a spit in my face. Obviously ICEs and gas have their place, but like you said, one day we wont have the option.

And if these guys werent short sighted morons, they would realize the more people that drive EVs, then **more gas for them!!** Leaving EV drivers alone is their best chance of survival!"
I mean that's how most of the people like this act. Unless you want to provide some other perfectly reasonable explanation why they're doing this.
What?
"none of these cars will tow 16,000 ... the F350 MIGHT tow in the 15,000 range, but jacked up like that, I'm thinking no. It needs to be the diesel dually to get into the higher ranges, plus be the 4.1 axel to get high towing rates. So it's likely going to max out at 12,000 if it's equipped right, but then again I wouldn't tow more than 9,000 lbs if it was 12k rated. 

The model X can tow a 747 if it needs to, but the trailer capacity or experience won't be that great for a 9,000 lb trailer or even 5,000."
"Towing capacity is fairly dependant on the particulars of the suspension, not just power."
"Tesla gave me $13,000 for my 12yo GMC Sierra with 125,000 miles as a trade-in, and it wasn’t as expensive new as the two Fords."

* Engage in fighting,
* Threaten, or create violent or excessively noisy behavior,
* Create dangerous or offensive conditions without good reason in order to inconvenience, annoy, or alarm others,
* Accost or annoy another with offensive and disorderly acts or language, or
* Engage in lewd speech or behavior in public.

"Uh, I think the police can triage their calls better than you. "
it's no different than if I parked at a gas pump and refused to move my vehicle you bet the police would be there don't let some red necks win 
"It's not wasting time. This is unlawful harassment and is preventing the people who own Tesla's from charging their vehicles, effectively holding them hostage if the vehicle is dead. Preventing someone from being able to leave somewhere can be viewed as unlawful arrest, a hostage situation, etc. This needs to be reported to the police since it is a blatant disregard for the law and pure harassment based on the vehicle someone drives and their life choice.

Edit: Source - My father is a State Trooper, and I asked him about this. Mind you we are in a different state, but it should be looked into none the less."
"I don’t know... in the early days of SuperChargers I saw one of these escalate into a fist fight. The police definitely needed to show up. 

Definitely read the situation, but a group of guys blocking access and yelling “fuck you” could get bad fast if you don’t have range to leave and get to the next charger. "
"If the police really are too busy to handle it, they'll tell you."
Non-emergency police lines exist.
Fuck that. If I have my family in my car and men are harassing me I'm either calling the police or I'm going apeshit on someone. Twenty something me wouldn't even question which one. Adult me doesn't want my kids seeing something like that. Police are a much better alternative.
"And if they get the police called every time, they hopefully will be charged eventually and maybe think twice about doing it"
Not by the same people to the same people.
It would be so satisfying to see them all towed and to watch the owners reactions when they came back out. 
I've posted this many times myself.

"And the fact that EVs are losing their rebate(s) while the oil and gas industry happens to conveniently keep theirs. That'll show ev owners/prospects, let's make it less affordable so nobody gets one! "
"You should look at the subsidy as a function of power generated.

We need that power. We can't replace it with green stuff yet. You're making an oversimplified argument something like ""Look you're a hypocrite because oil/gas cost the taxpayer a lot"" but you're ignoring the magnitude of ""green"" energy generated as a function of cost vs the oil/gas energy generated as a function of cost.

I'll save you time, we're paying out the nose for green subsidies and powering our entire civilization with that oil/gas. Pretending we could just throw that money at a solar panel farm and get the same amount of power back is nonsense."

Diesel is more expensive per gallon because it's denser. If it was sold by weight the price would be extremely close. By energy content/mileage it's quite a bit cheaper.
"They must have graduated from my high school, where guys with trucks would either hang out in a Krystals (aka White Castle) or gas station parking lot. Wish I were joking.  "
yep. worst advice ever. This is just self serving dismissal of the problem by those not affected by it. If let alone bullying get's worse more often than not. 
"Not to go totally off topic, but what advice would you recommend giving? "
"No they don't.   They tell kids to notify a adult when bullied.   Now those kids are all adults and have no idea how to handle adult bullies besides trying to get the police involved in areas where there is no crime.  

"
They’ll stop after the first few batches of trucks get torched. That’s how the real world works. 
"Well, it works when the bully is an animal. A literal animal. I knew a parrot that would bite people because she liked the reaction. After it learned that I wouldn't react even when it drew blood, it gave up trying to bite me (but still bit other people).

It works much better if you avoid the reaction before the bullying pattern sets in, though."
"I mean, you’re not wrong. Calling what happened a tragedy doesn’t even come close to describing what happened. One can only hope that we’ve learned something from the past. 

It’s easy to be pessimistic with stuff like this but I try to remind myself that there are a lot of good people out there too. "
That's certainly an interesting...if circuitous...Godwinization of the thread. :D
"See I'm a Trumpster and I love Teslas. Would buy one before I bought a Truck. But maybe I'm the exception.

To be honest these guys just need a couple paintball guns giving their trucks a new color."
"Then they’ll turn around and torch someone’s Tesla while it’s charging, probably taking out two or more super charger pedestals in the process. Or worse, they’ll torch the super charger itself. Do you really wanna start that kind of shit?"
That would be a form of attention.  Also it would make the news and multiply the attention exponentially. 
"They'd continue doing it whether they get a rise out of owners or not. The fact that they are stopping Tesla owners from being able to park and charge in designated Tesla parking/charging spots and just generally being an inconvenience to owners is what they want, and they get that regardless of how owners react. The only thing that will change the behavior is if they just get bored of doing it, or they start dealing with actual meaningful consequences (getting towed, fine, etc)."
"Thats my point- Tesla rents the space, they should be able to enforce a tow- or make it part of their lease  agreement that the hotel, or gas station CAN tow."

"Can confirm. I've seen cars flip in 1/2 inch of snow. I'm used to getting feet of snow in the northeast. I find it hilarious.

In Maryland people have tires made for snow and the government spreads salt on the road. So it's not really a fair comparison.
"I got stuck in an ice storm in GA several years ago. Like stuck on the highway for 12 hours stuck. It was just a series of lifted trucks flooring it trying to get up a small incline on the highway.

I’ll never drive through that dumbass state in the winter. "

The issue is that it seems that cops aren't calling for the tow and unless you're the property owner you can't either. 
"Nope. No Cowboy boots,buck knives, or back pockets of skoal touchin my seats. "

"Probably right. I think they have an idea in their head about what a Tesla owner looks and acts like (just like we have a mental image of them) and it’s kind fun to disrupt that and just be a good guy to them — within reason/safety, of course. Give them something to ponder."

But statistics show that conceal carry permit holders commit fewer crimes. So if they’re legally carrying concealed they’re not likely to shoot someone over a parking dispute. Of course they could just have one in their car and a crazy enough to do that.

"Agree to disagree.  Just ignore it...it takes the fun away for intimidating them.

Let's face it...I *highly doubt* this is happening because the truck owners hate EVs.  Most of my truck-owning friends hate leftists and associate EVs with that...probably because California is leading the adoption of them.

I have California plates but a ""Trump: MAGA"" sticker on my rear glass...I've had a lifted truck in AZ *move* out of a charging spot without me saying a word when he saw it was a tight fit on the one open spot (because a Tesla driver was parked like a jerk).  

Everyone here playing into the California stereotypes with their passive-aggressive, Napoleon-syndrome stuff is 100% the wrong way to help mainstream EV adoption."

Why not? It's completely stable. 
You’d tow the trucks as a middle finger to the guys who probably get into weekly circlejerks and talk about their Cummins diesels or whatever the hell trailer trash folks put in trucks these days.
"While it has the power, it may not have the traction. A couple of those look like 3/4 ton or light duty 1 ton trucks, they weigh a lot.

Still, that would be a sight to see...

Edit: I see a lot of people pointing to examples of Tesla's towing things (and other examples). While those are interesting examples. They are not quite the same. I do think the Tesla would have some success. But, not necessarily for all three. Here are some differences between the scenarios:

1) Brakes applied vs not applied: This has a huge impact on the force needed to move the object. A smaller object with brakes applied can actually take more force to move than a larger object without the brakes applied. Friction becomes a very large factor here. For example, it is definitely doable for a small motor car (e.g. a Honda civic) to tow a considerable amount of wait if it is on flat ground and with no additional friction beyond rolling friction. But, if you add that additional force, it completely changes the game.

2) Tire type. In the example of a Touareg pulling a Duramax. The type of tired on that truck are far from ideal for generating friction on an asphalt surface. It looks like 2 of the 3 trucks in the pictures have similar (though less aggressive) tread patterns. So, there *might* be a possibility on those. But, I'm skeptical on the third truck.

3) No one is doubting how much torque a Telsa makes at 0 RPM. It's awesome and we all know it. But, that is only one factor here.

"Just a middle finger to the truck owner, to wipe their ego a bit. Granted, I wouldn't want to stick around after, as they're liable to try to shoot you, but it'd shut em up. "

"> it could considering the p100d has over 580hp and 900 lbft of torque

Probably any Model S or X could pull it if there was a good enough hitch available. Weight wise they're all similar to those trucks.

"Going out on a limb, I think it was a joke. 
However, torque numbers are not all you need to verify towing capacity.  Suspension and chassis would need to be engineered for that."

"Why is it that when I speak to a liberal they always reference the most low hanging fruit example? And then when I speak to a conservative they will do the same and reference some awfully over regulated place like San Francisco or Chicago? Is there room for centrists anymore? 

Concerning your point, California is the homeless capital of the nation because of bad government, over regulation policies. There are places that have too much regulation, and there are places that don’t have enough. What’s your point?"
"Well the pendulum swings back and forth. Something will be done. Whether it be parking fines from law enforcement or vehicles being towed, the antagonists will surly deserve it."
"So without getting super technical, coal is produced when unspent fuel exits through the exhaust system. Regular diesel pick up trucks might put out a tiny bit of ""coal"" with the default programming; slightly more so if you're towing or if you downshift and hammer the accelerator. If you buy a [programmer](https://www.google.com/search?q=edge+programmer&oq=edge+prog&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i60j69i57j69i60j0l2.1111j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)  you can modify the stock computer to increase the HP and torque output without actually doing anything to the engine. The problem becomes that everything on the truck is essentially built or calibrated for the stock settings. So assume for instance that a stock truck puts out 400 HP and 300 foot lbs of torque. With some room for error, the engine, fuel pump, fuel rails, transmission, and many other parts are set up to handle those specs. When you add a programmer you can increase those specs by a large amount without actually changing anything else. So now you have a ""stock"" truck that's putting out 600 HP and 700 lbs of torque on all stock parts which will wear those parts out super quickly. The wear will depend on how you're driving and what setting the programmer is on. 

So to answer you question, rolling coal (generally) requires a tuner or programmer increasing the HP/torque output. Increasing the HP/torque output puts added stress on a transmission, which will cause it to blow at some point. 

[Here are a bunch of threads of diesel owners talking about blowing up various parts of their trucks because of programmers.](https://www.google.com/search?q=diesel+forum+blown+trans+from+programmer&oq=diesel+forum+blown+trans+from+programmer&aqs=chrome..69i57.5366j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) "
"Rolling coal generally goes along with significant increases in power- not the most power possible, but an increase from factory. Factory transmissions handling that kind of power don't fare well. "
Ya I don’t get that either. 
I believe it has to do with putting too much fuel into the engine at too low an RPM. It fucks up literally everything in the engine over time.
More power=more strain on the transmission.
I’m guessing MOT is euro version of DEQ.  DEQ is more of a city thing in the US.  Rural areas tend to be exempt.

">The point is they employ Americans to build their cars when most traditional “American made” cars are produced in Mexico.

For the mass consumer, smaller sized sedans that is true. However, vehicles like the F150 are surprisingly still largely ""American"". American University did [an economic study](https://www.american.edu/kogod/research/autoindex/2018-autoindex.cfm) and Tesla Model S is 8th while the F150 is 3rd. Cars.com also has a made in the US index and Tesla doesn't crack the top 10."
FYI - F250s are built in Kentucky.
But your entire point was that its 100%...so it's not semantics 
"Same as every Tesla.  Roughly 35% of imported content goes into every Tesla, coming from Mexico, Canada, and China.  Tesla still does really well as far as total contribution to the American economy, but that’s in part to how much they cost.  They beat every pickup made by GM or Chrysler and every SUV and car made by Ford."
"For climate change, it is harder to remember. I think it was the idea of how little we could measure and directly know, and then while I went to university I saw how they could measure the change in the isotope balance of C14 in the atmosphere due to adding so much old carbon. That and the direct albedo measurements of he earth from sattalites.

The most obvious fact that changed my view on a conspiracy theory was the 9/11 was an inside job. Once I saw unedited, and not cherry picked footage of the towers falling you can see that nine of the first three towers accelerated at free fall, and they edit out some of the collapse in all three to make it seem that way. Once I could do the math myself I could see they were lying. From there other facts filled in the blanks."
"You're right. We're all just fucking people who drive. Some are enthusiastic, some couldn't give a shit about more than their commute. Some love doing their own maintenance, some hate it and would rather pay.

Miata, F150, Mustang, Tesla, GM, Porsche, Challenger, Range Rover, fucking Smart, they're all just cars driven by nothing but people. Not superheros. Not gremlins. People. No one is special. No one has the right to deny other drivers their choice of vehicle, common courtesy, right-of-way, or patience. No one owes anyone anything but a safe drive from A to B."

Do you really not understand what is going on here or do you just like to play dense?"
">  it occurred to me that you are specifically talking about these trucks in the picture...which are clearly older trucks. i still have to imagine that the 350 can tow upwards of 20k.

Yes, I was talking about these specific trucks. I've been getting pretty familiar with towing capacity since toying with the idea of getting a travel trailer and roaming the country as part of my work. 

Also, none of these will tow full capacity with the lift kits and mods. None will have airbags or other systems to increase safety and ease. None are dually, so they will have less payload capacity and lower towing stats. If they aren't the diesel versions, it cuts capacity.

but you are correct in most every 1 ton version these days do 15k hitch and 22,5k fifth wheel minimum when in dually and diesel."
">how does that change the outcome. 

Nobody is claiming that. I'm explaining why comparing HP doesn't get you the right answer."
"MSRP on my truck was $54,000 back in December of 2006.  The diesel engine in that F350 in the middle is a $9,000 option alone."

"1.  The Constitution does not “grant” any freedoms.  It prevents the government from infringing rights we already have.  This is not government property- it is private property.  The First Amendment would only prevent the police from breaking up an assembly approved by the private property owner.  It does not allow anyone to go anywhere they want and say anything they want.

2.  If you ask Tesla and the property owner, I guarandamntee you that the signs are intended to inform people that only Teslas that are charging are permitted to park there.  The people parking there know this."
Deleting and reposting your comment still doesn't make it right.

"""Tesla Vehicle Charging"" right on the red signs on every single stall. Right to assembly doesn't mean parking your car on reserved parking spaces.  There are places where general parking is allowed, and the signs will say it, was just at a Wawa and it says ""15 minute general parking"". "
"Is Tesla leasing the spots? If Tesla has paid for the space, can’t they have vehicles towed?"
I'm not saying they are or aren't allowed to park there but do you actually think this is what the first amendment means? The right to park where you want?
"The Constitution does not obligate the private property owner to allow either freedom of assembly or a right to protest.  It only applies to government infringement thereof.  If the private property owner wanted to trespass them, they have every right to do so.

Tesla is updating their signs at Superchargers slowly, going from these stupid “Tesla Charging” signs to “Tesla Charging Only.”  They put too much faith in humanity."

"It wouldn't be much of a challenge for a Tesla. There's good reasons that diesel locomotives use electric motors rather than a conventional engine/transmission. Even without taking into account the major advantage that they have in regards to low end torque, an electric motor offers much less power loss from motor to contact patch (and none of those trucks are going to have tires with compound that will compete with even the stock Tesla rubber on asphalt). Furthermore, the ability of the traction control system in a Tesla (or most high end EVs for that matter) is in a completely different level, as the relative difference between the two would be like the pick-ups performing brain surgery with an ice cream scoop.

I was bullied.
"I oppose reserved parking for people who spent more on their cars.  I don't think Mercedes owners should have reserved parking, or BMW owners, or Ferrari owners, or anyone else should be made to feel entitled to park in a particular parking spot to the exclusion of others.

If you want to buy gas, then feel free to stop by the gas pump for the 2 minutes it takes you to pump it.  But don't tell me that I'm not allowed to park in a parking space because you feel like you and only you have a right to hang out there for the next 2 hours.

Don't like it?  Charge at home."

"Guns are actually fairly common where I live (rural-ish), but they are long arms meant for hunting. Hand guns are very rare - typically only police, military, border services, or wildlife/oceans enforcement carry pistols. 

I live in a mid-size town and we only lock our houses while we sleep. When we lived in the city (small 600k), locking doors also tended to be night time."

And if someone can't pay to get their car released from impound then the towing company can claim the car as abandoned, get a fresh title from the state, and sell it for profit on auction, then send whatever balance the auction didn't cover to collections. Cha CHING!

"It's dumping a bunch more fuel into the engine and usually adding some more air either through boost or timing.

"they congifurations are all close, the main thing that changes is payload with each configuration.

The biggest shift in towing is axel ratio, with a 4.1 giving you the best towing, but worse MPG on the highway, and a dual axel, which gives you more payload and you can carry a larger trailer. Then it's the engine, with a diesel giving the best towing compared to a gasoline engine. Everything after that doesn't affect things to much, but is mostly for safety and easy of towing, stability, etc. "

"Tesla’s aren’t necessarily more expensive than these trucks. 

You just want to send a “fuck you” message to all electric car owners. Even though there is plenty of parking spaces available for gas cars to park, you’re going to antagonistically block the spots.

"Although it doesn't really fit alongside other super-cars, it's definitely arguable that it is one. the Alfa Romeo 4C Spider is made in the [Maserati Factory](https://www.maserati.com/maserati/au/en/brand/our-world/factory-tour) in Modena Italy. It is a high performance car with the sleek and elegant look of a supercar.
While it doesn't technically fall into the category of a super car (It's a sports car) It's not a stretch at all for a lay-person to refer to one as a supercar. It definitely looks the part.

Although, it is worth noting that the term super-car can be used to refer to a vehicle that is either;

1. Limited-production specials from an ""elite"" automaker
2. Standard-looking cars modified for power and performance
3. Models from smaller manufacturers that appeal to enthusiasts

So It's very arguable that it is a supercar

Also, if you google ['Alfa Romeo Supercar'](https://www.google.com/search?q=alfa+romeo+supercar&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b-ab) the 4C is the first link.

It's not a Hyper-car, but under some definitions it is certainly a super-car.

*Definitely not a stretch in my opinion.**"

They come stock but the conditions to use it are pretty bad
I think people are getting confused on if the tesla is pulling a parked truck or a truck pulling back. Sure it might be able to pull a parked truck a bit. 
"> The weights are closer than you’d think

So, we both agree that traction is what matters then?  Good.

Yes it does I am a member of congress I would know.
"Also I suspect California having such nice weather takes the urgency off action some.

It's not that Alaska is morally superior (though it might be), it's that 100 homeless people on the streets of Anchorage will result in 100 dead people during the winter which will prompt some action, mainly because nobody wants to be the villain in the piece of reporting that'll be coming once even a few of those homeless freeze to death.

I agree with you on the zoning & NIMBY, but surely that's more a super chronic city level problem? All the home owners are of course resistant to it as they'd lose value, so I can admittedly see the benefits of a higher level solution (counties can block high density residential from a maximum of 50% of their zoned land... or something)."

Found the bully.
"You say this with the generalization that the bullied is actually capable of defending themselves and winning against the aggressor which is often not the case. 

That’s great that it worked for you, but you are not the sole example for all cases. 

There are several cases where the bullied has fought back and been killed or seriously injured. 

Infact in my home town a very bullied child was told to fight back by his parents. When he attempted to retaliate with the bully he was taken to a local park / tied up / jaw broken / then the bully made him sit on his knees while he pissed in his mouth, then he was beaten into a coma and died a day later. 

Not good blanket advice to be giving people. 

The park is now named after the child who died covered in piss. "

"You'd suggested I didn't know  anything about guns... I only mention my background as evidence to the contrary.  Knowing about and proficiency w/ firearms is... uh... a big part of the job description.  There's no shortage of material on this if you're truly curious at your nearest neighborhood search engine, but a partial list: 

* The 5.56 mm ammunition it makes use of was expressly desired for lethality on the battlefield.  It's a lighter weight, high velocity round designed  to tumble or ""bounce"" within soft flesh creating complex wounds.  It's high velocity makes it inappropriate for ""home defense.""  The tumbling / bounce effect and associated large interior cavities and exit wounds make it a poor choice for hunting as well (assuming you some how think it sporting to hunt w/ an assault rifle.). While other weapons (including relatively staid bolt action hunting rifles) can be chambered in 5.56 the original Armalite AR-15 was designed around this round.  It speaks to the overall design center for the weapon:  as a weapon of war, intended to maximize effectiveness on the battlefield.
* It's designed to provide a high rate of fire (as fast as you can pull the trigger) with minimal recoil.  This allows even relatively inexperienced shooters a better chance of maintaining sight picture with less time required for correction.  The pistol grip, spring recoil system in the stock, and other design choices optimize for usage under high rates of fire.   The only substantial difference between the AR-15 (and its variants) and the M-16/M-4 is a different lower receiver.  Not only is it trivial to modify or swap out so that you've now a fully / burst automatic weapon it's increasingly easy to obtain the how to or parts to do so.  The original patents have expired and there's a thriving cottage industry of modifications and variations.  Peculiarly, I'm unaware of any that focus upon making it more suitable for civilian applications... but there's no shortage of options for rendering it into whatever fantasy high-speed SpecOps / first person shooter flavor du jour.  
* The detachable magazine fed nature of the device makes it easy to pump a very high volume of ammunition through the  device with the only time necessary to reload that associated with a magazine swap. 
* As to dangerous / gun-craziness, it connotes (to me at least) that the individual possessing it either has delusions around the ""romance"" of the home / community vigilante, or their ability to some how bear their arms to thwart centralized government oppression, or seems to somehow appeal as compensation for their feelings of inadequacy / insecurity by having a bigger, badder stick than the next guy.  And that's not to speak of the even more sinister motivations a smaller slice of owners have for owning the same weapon used as the implement of choice among mass shooters.  

Enough though... as mentioned if one is really curious there's no shortage of information (and plenty of FUD to go along with it) out there.  A Tesla forum isn't the place for this.   "

"Lol, ya. I don't understand why Tesla owners are so obsessed with wearing Tesla branded apparrel. It's not my thing... But I guess that means more logo gear for others if I don't buy any."
And here I am wondering why people meet up with strangers simply because they have the same car but hey to each their own right.
"My buddy has a 2008 Pontiac GTO. He took it to get Dyno tested. The same day a lot of other people that had GTOs and Corvettes and the like we're getting their cars Dyno tested. There was one guy that showed up in a ZO6 that was completely decked out in Corvette stuff. We're talking hat, gloves, gigantic jacket with a huge Corvette logo on the back. Everything. Everyone noticed. 

So at one point they get this guy's car up on the dyno and he's convinced that it's going to pull some ridiculous amount of horsepower and it doesn't. He starts to get all frustrated and he wants to go up and actually put it through the gears to get the correct power curve going. They don't let him. 

At the peak of him being upset somsone in the back screamed out ""GIVE HIM THE JACKET!!!"" and we all lost it. "
"I don't have any Tesla swag... but if I did, a Tesla meet up is precisely where I'd wear it"
Did a Tesla throw up on you?
"I personally think it’s weird to wear *everything* (shirt *and* hat *and*  jacket is overkill), but wouldn’t it be equally weird if nobody wore any swag to a Tesla meetup? Who hasn’t done this somewhere in their life? 

You see it in colleges across the country. We get it, you go here, too. If you went to any professional sporting event, it’s all over the place. If you went to a Star Wars convention (or even just the movie on opening night), people will be dressed as characters and wearing their shirts. If you go to a marathon, people are wearing previous marathon shirts (except the really new people who wear the shirt for the current marathon).

I think it’s an ice-breaker. It simply says “look, we have something in common.” But, yeah, one piece of clothing (Tesla, SpaceX, *or* Boring) is enough.

"I’ve got a hat and a corporate jacket for when I want to sneak into a service center on the DL. 

**really just because I’m a huge nerd** "
Right?! This is nothing compared to the fandom haha.
"Sitting across a dude that ends every sentence with tbh irl. Now that I read your comment, I realized; he taught himself English from the internetz."
"I started to feel uncomfortable around people in red hats.

Make Automobiles Great Again? "
You should have seen the fannypack
"I don't recognize the tee.  What is it?
"
Lol ur right 
Woah. I've seen this scene so many times I didn't even process the image to see someone Tesla'd it. 
*laughs in Boring Company apparel*
"I think it's because Tesla has become a ""thing"" much larger than just a car company. You don't see people making memes about the CEO of Ford. I don't even know who their CEO is and I drive one. Everything Elon does has become a community. "
Serious question: how is wearing Tesla apparel any different than wearing another corporation's?
Guy attending Tesla fan meetup is surprised to see Tesla fans.
I’m not that type but I think it’s safe to say that Tesla started a culture that goes beyond just being a car manufacturer. 
"Not sure why you think they're ""obsessed"". It's showing support for something they're enthusiastic about, and also most of it looks pretty damn good as well.

99% of clothes have some sort of logo on them."
"I have a Tesla corps jacket and it's one of the warmest jackets I have ever worn. Yah I can get a similar one from a different brand. But on my road trip from LA to NY, I was treated a lot nicer when wearing it. Maybe it's placebo, maybe Tesla owners are regarded as assholes so they treat me nicer to avoid any confrontations, maybe they think I work for tesla... I wore it one time local and I got the VIP treatment at starbucks. Maybe it's placebo again. Though i don't see it any different than wearing a Ferrari branded apparel."
I have yet to meet a single Tesla owner who wears Tesla merch.  I've met a billion fanboys whose only hope of ever owning one is to sell a kidney or liver who are decked out head to toe.
"If it did not come with the car I would have nothing with the logo or brand name on it. I only had some from previous vehicles because the dealers just gave them out. Oh, I ditched the license plate frame they gave me."
"> Lol, ya. I don't understand why ~~Tesla owners~~ **football fans** are so obsessed with wearing ~~Tesla~~ **their team/player** branded apparrel. It's not my thing... But I guess that means more logo gear for others if I don't buy any.

It's no different from wearing any other sort of branded apparel. Foot ball is the most obnoxious about it since it's even for made for specific players that move around and get traded all the time, and not just the teams.
"
Where else are you going to wear Telsa swag? No IRL.
"I know!!! It’s odd.
Don’t jeep people do things like this too or am I mistaken?"
Car clubs are HUGE.  I mean a shared interest is the core of most relationships so not sure why you would think this in any way weird?
"It's not for me either but I kind of get it.  Besides, the older you get, the harder it is to expand your social circle.  Even if these other owners are the type of people you'd never hangout with, you already have a common bond and an easy conversation starting point.  Not really different from joining a club with people that share any hobby (which isn't for me either). "
"It’s not just about owning the same car, it’s about being on the same page about early adopting disruptive new technology and sharing in that unique experience"
"> And here I am wondering why people meet up with strangers simply because they have the same car

LOL are you serious? Have you never heard of a hobby?

Yeah, why are people meeting up with random strangers who share similar interests!? Its almost like they're trying to be social!"
"To me an owners meet or a car-meet is brilliant. I especially enjoy Sunday morning local meets, or classic car meets. Variety is always better. 
Some of the car brands have recognised this and have often lend official support for country-western etc. For eg Porsche, Ferrari, Jeep, Harley etc. It's good for branding purposes because it attracts new buyers who want to be a part of the 'club', for eg, Harley. 

Other than that Porsche, BMW, Alfa owners for eg they are usually enthusiasts and they seek each other out. Maybe to just meet, go on drives, go for track days or exchange notes if it's a classic car. 

Porsche has huge meets in America, including some unique ones like Luftgekühlt and Rennsport in America."
"Car guys are huge into cars, lots of meetups and car shows all over the country essentially every week. 

I think this applies to many other hobbies as well. People with a shared passion do meet up to socialize and enjoy their things. I mean hell I just found out that computer keyboards are a hobby as well

CHeck out this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies

People are into all kinds of things and they gather to socialize and share their interests: comic books, movies, computer keyboards, cars, guns, stamps, etc."
"I used to have a Harley and belonged to a Harley club (it’s not a gang, its a club).  We really had all types - bunch of biker types, some weekend warriors, bunch of corporate types, posers and wannabe Hells Angels.  I belonged because I liked to ride, and you would think that it was the common theme, but it really wasn’t.  We used to do a weekend dinner ride where we would ride to a local restaurant, eat, then head our separate ways.  Sometimes it was a hour or so ride before our destination and sometimes it was local and a lot of folks would just meet there, even occasionally showing up in their car.  I cam to realize that while our love of motorcycling may have been the initial impetus, it was the social aspect that kept them coming back.  People just like hanging with other people.
So while I am not going to drop everything and go to great lengths to find a local Tesla club, I might attend a meet up if I find one nearby.  TBH, I’d rather go to a EV meetup."
"It's usually enthusiast who would meet up, and since having the same car usually means similar interests in cars in makes meeting people easier. Great way to make friends and learn things about your car from others."
"You do realize you're on a subreddit specifically for that, right? It's just not an in person meet up. "
Ever see how motorcyclists tend to ride in groups of the same bike ?
2006 was the last year they made them but story still checks out.
That actually makes me feel a bit sad
That's a really good point 👌
Isn't that like wearing a bands merch to see them?
"but WHY? Everybody there knows that you have a Tesla, because it's a meeting of Tesla owners 😁"
"Those people are called 
Full kit retards 

These idiots dress in the full kit of their club, to the point of ridiculousness. It a fun google image search I’ll tell you  "
"Very true.  In their defense, many Tesla fan are more than just liking a cool car.  They're also supporting a positive shift towards safer driving and sustainability, which certainly needs all the support it can get.  "
Yesssss it 40 degrees where I live and I bought one for being in the local club and got a discount code lol 
What else would you wear?
Nothing wrong with that. 100s of shows over the years and a large percentage of the people there doing just that. It’s what people do and it’s a silly think to frown upon
Better than facing the alternative https://youtu.be/H7us-KpqUE4
Thanks!
And the one comment is immediately rationalizing it. 
There it is...the always helpful BMW comment.
Or Subaru.
Hey knock off the whataboutism! We're here to make fun of tesla swag! 
"Granted, I bought a SpaceX shirt when I was down at the Kennedy Space Center, which is now one of my favorite workout shirts.  "
I'm sure those little mall kiosks that sew names on stuff would hook you up
"The first one I went to was before I had my 3 and got to sit in one RIGHT after they were released to the public, which was amazing. 

This second one was a fundraiser for a charity,  which made sense.  Some booths were selling Tesla accessories, but the rest was completely random stuff (jewelry/trinkets).  

Besides wraps, there’s basically nothing to customize and show off to other owners.  It’d be like an iPhone owner meetup.  "
"You do the same shit when you wear any shirt with a logo on it (Nike, Polo, etc.)"
"Meanings change over time. Since rappers heard about swagger they began to use it a lot that changed it from  a verb, to a noun. Finally they sortened it to swag."
"My family/friends know I’m a Tesla fan, but I had to specifically tell them to NOT buy me Tesla-branded clothing.  That’s just too much.  

Feels like I’m bragging about having money.  "
"I got myself one for a birthday present about a year before my 3 came.  It's my daily jacket.  I nerd out to it, everyone at work knows it, and I wouldn't have it any other way!"
"Same here. I don't think people that wear the merch look douchy, it's just I was afraid to be seen that way because I could easily see someone taking it that way. 
 "
Location is everything. Wear them in the Bay Area and people will just assume you work there.

"I think it goes along with the Joey picture in the OP. People that wear the brand of their expensive vehicles (BMW/Porsche/Ferrari/etc) can look pretentious. Compared to wearing a Nike shirt or whatever it doesn't mean that you own something that costs 10s or 100s of thousands of dollars. 

I think it can be seen somewhat similarly to wearing the bands shirt to their concert (I guess that's a faux pas in some circles). "
Because all Tesla fans dress like a walking billboard...
Is that what you tell yourself to justify the Tesla jumpsuit ? 
I have some luggage they sent me that I use.  It's really subtle.  The hat that came with the car I gave away without putting it on.
"I mean kind of, but being a fan of a team and spending $20 on a jersey or hat or whatever doesn't mean you are a part owner of the team. (Granted anyone can wear Tesla apparel) it's different than driving around in a 100k car covered in branded apparel for that company."
Solid comparison 
"Well usually Jeep meetups involve off-roading and actually using your car, not just jerking off to it lol.

"Jeep meetups are the worst, they are always held in the most [inconvenient locations.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/autoexposurecanada/177341853)"
"Everyone that feels they belong to a ""club"" of some sort do this. I've seen it for a the [Piaggio Ape](http://www.apeclubditalia.it/)"
"Jeep people have a special handshake. Even though both of my sisters never go farther than the city, they still somehow justify their Wrangler Unlimiteds."
"There have probably been at least half a dozen over the years.  Considerably more if you count localized [insert classic car name] ""clubs"" that get together for social events and parades.

Jeep owners definitely have their own flavor of camaraderie, I think a hand gesture might be involved.  There was a printed guide that got circulated around for VW bus owners for a while, with everything from repair shop locations to random dudes willing to let you crash at their place if you needed to.  Saturn had a big meetup thing going for several years.  Mini Cooper people have at least some clubs that I know of.  Then there are the unusual vehicles, the ultra-luxury models, the rare antiques and, of course, the various popular sports cars... the love affair goes on.  Thankfully, we're finally getting a gradually better sense of hygiene about it."
"Don’t forget Prius people

Miata owner here. We do this too!
Every half decent car has groups that do this.  
Us Jeep people have a special wave and that’s about it.
"Not Just Jeeps but all kinds of cars there are diehard fans and followers. 

And it's not that odd really if you think about it. It extends to way past just cars. Look at this list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies  People gather together to meet up and socialize and share their passion all the time. "
"I get it it's just not for me I was mostly trying to point out OP likes going to meet ups but ""man those guys wear too much Tesla apparel"" comes off as a bit condescending. Truly was pointing out the to each their own aspect more than anything else no judgement here."
"I guess I don't see as much to really do or talk about with other car owners, compared to other hobby's that are the basis of shared interests.  You can only talk about how cool the car is for so long, and all you can really do together is drive in a long line down the road, where you're mostly just alone in your own car.  Maybe you're lucky and other people there share OTHER interests with you, but in my experience, car ownership is only vaguely tied to other interests in life."
Yeah I'm really not knocking it I do get it mostly just making a point that OP likes going to meet ups but hey you guys are weird for wearing Tesla apparel as well.  I should have put more emphasis on the To each their own  live and let live part. 
"I do get it but no personally I have zero interest in doing so myself. The part of my post  you didn't quote ""to each their own"" was my main point. OP is knocking guys for wearing Tesla apperal to a meet up I was simply providing perspective that to many car meet ups are just as  strange as wearing a bunch of Tesla swag. So I'll say it again to each their own I have no issues with the meet ups and no issues with guys dressed to the 9s in Tesla swag. Live and let live."
"I think certain hobbies are more apparent in what enthusiasts would do together e.g. a music club would mean musicians gather together to make music, it would certainly be very odd if they just got together to show what musical instruments they own. 

Whereas with a car racing club, or a car modding club, it is obvious what they would do at meetings. Just having a Tesla club is too generic for someone to really know what members do. "
"But when I run out of things to say to you on here, because the only thing we necessarily have in common is we own a car made by the same company, I just put my phone down and go watch a movie.

We don't have to just sit here awkward as hell, staring at our coffee, wracking our brains for anything to talk about if it turns out that's all we have to talk about."
"Don't be that guy!*

*Unless you're at a pearl jam concert, in which case you'll look stupid if you're not that guy."
"Somewhat but you're going to see Tesla, you're going to see other peeps who like Tesla."
"Well that’s why I don’t have swag, I don’t want to wear it as I walk around as people might misconstrue it as me trying to show off. When going to a Tesla meet up it wouldn’t be misconstrued, that’d be me supporting company I believe in. "
"I did my part, I bought two tshirts, and I don't even own a Tesla yet."
"Usually a different band in a similar genre. 
You can wear a bands merch if you bought it at that concert tho"
"I turned that off when it got too uncomfortable. Does it turn out to be a bit in the end, or are they just dickheads? "

That’s called tradition.

"Thanks.

"I really don't think ""swag"" when referencing corporate branded clothing/gear that gets handed out at events has *any* relationship or shared history to the term ""swagger""."
Wearing a $200 t-shirt is worse than a slightly overpriced piece of clothing from some automaker though.
"Maybe I wouldn’t get downvotes if I explained my reasoning better. I also don’t think it looks douchy, but the perception of others is why I don’t flaunt Tesla gear "

"I need to know what anime this is from, if it’s an anime. "

"I find it sad the amount of hate and judgement so tied up in a simple garment. Bearing a single sentence of optimism, worn by the president no less.

Honestly, people shouldn't give a shit what other people wear. Getting upset that someone wear's the band's shirt to a concert is so fucking dumb

"Yeah but [it's not that expensive.](https://shop.tesla.com/us/en/category/apparel.html) If somebody thinks wearing a Tesla tee makes you look pretentious, I'd bet my left nut they are below the poverty line.

No. [**This**](https://shop.tesla.com/us/en/product/apparel/tesla-model-s-for-kids.html?sku=1465593-00-A) is pretentious."
"If they attend a meetup it's likely they'll wear some company gear the have.

Brands like Ferrari, Porsche, BMW and Alfa are quite famous for their fans and their gear."
Do you really?  Or are you saying you aren't a fan and think they do that?
So salty 😂
"Jeep/Porsche/etc owners usually mod their cars (engines/interiors/paint) or refurbish an older one.  I’m guessing their meetups let them show them off.  I wasn’t really sure what people do at Tesla meetups.  Minus some custom wraps, we’re all just showing off the exact same 3 car models.  

The first one I attended 2 years ago to let me see/drive the model 3 RIGHT after they were released, which was awesome.   

Now that I own one, I didn’t know what I was doing there.   There were some booths selling cleaning supplies and another with some accessories, but not much to really do or talk about. "
"Wait, do people jerk off to their Tesla? Is that what happens in these meetings?

Asking for a friend.... "
"That’s what I thought , actually did something lol. Subaru’s too maybe?"
Wait you jerk off to cars?
"Jeep owner here. Exactly. And everyone talks about their various mods etc. 

Same goes with sports cars. Meetup, talk about the experience of each car a bit because they're all so unique and interesting, find some twisty roads to go driving on. 

I always found meetups strange if everyone has the same mostly unmodified vehicle.

I've been to a EV meetups because at first they were a bit counter-culture and the group would demo their cars for others who were curious about going electric, it was fun to see people experience the future. 

But 20 Model 3's taking about who has the best efficiency? Plus a lot of, ""hey did you hear Elon said the thing?!"" ""Yes I also saw that and all of the analysis that followed"". 

To reach their own.

"Lol, I have 3 Cherokees and a Comanche in my driveway along with a model 3. This post made me laugh."

"ah yes using a Jeep to go off road, it's a good thing every where you drive you need it, I have no idea how Camrys and civics survive in this harsh world"

Fantastic!! I wouldn’t call that the worst! :)
It’s bizarre!
"Jeep owner. No special handshake that I know of. However, we do wave to each other on the road. If we remember to. Or actually see the Jeep coming towards us in the other lane. Often times I'm too focused on the folks ahead of me to see what's coming towards me in the other lane.

Admittedly, I've only become a Jeep owner relatively recently having  bought one for my son when he got his license, I do find this custom to be a bit odd. 

EDIT: Sometimes, when I'm driving and my son is in the passenger's seat, I like to make a big spectacle of it – furiously waving back and forth with a big crazy eyed grin. Particularly if we have the top and doors off. It makes me happy. "
"Wranglers are awesome vehicles, it's like a transformer convertible.  Loved my ex-gf's, almost bought one for myself and still sometimes wish I did.  I could easily understand enjoying one even if I didn't leave a city, at least if that city had nice weather for a chunk of the year."
"Bonding though repairs is any age old tradition for any car group, especially jeep."
VW bus seems fun for meet ups those seem hippy-ish and cool.
"Ay-yo, where my Saturn sista's at? I recently bought an SL1, it stands for Super Leggera #1 ;)"
Harley...
I think big organized by a third party company meet ups are kind of different especially when they involve more than one type of car. Maybe I’m splitting hairs though.
"Yep, I used to be super into one.  We would regularly do lots of modding at meets, even stuff as big as an engine swaps, full interior change outs, et cetera.  

There is some bonus fun in the excitement of ""how will I get home if we fuck this up.""  

I just replaced my meet up hobby right now with high powered rocketry.  I do have the itch for a new car audio install."
"When I was in high school i often would drive my dad's Datsun 1978 280z around town and on more than one occasion had people ask me if i wanted to go to their meetup, and then handed me their card. It was quite surreal.  Never had that happen in my Prius, people mostly just give me the finger these days, even if i'm driving a lot faster than the speed limit. It's a new special kinda club i suppose..."
"So if you're saying this, your car is not a source of joy/fun/entertainment in your life.  To you I'm guessing it's the same as joining an LG refrigerators owners club?  It means nothing right?  

But to car enthusiasts it's way more than that.  You have tech days where you can install mods, work on repairs and even basic maintenance.  Heck there are entire clubs who do nothing but wash and polish their cars!  You can go for mountain runs, track days, car shows etc.  

Car culture is great but it's OK if that's not your thing.  Lots of folks buy their cars as appliances but many others enjoy them greatly and like to share that with others."
"They don't only talk about their cars. They end up becoming friends and talking about other stuff too. You know, like every club or hobby, or even like church. "
"I can see you're not a car person, and that's fine, most of society are not. I'm a car guy and there are a HUGE amount of talk about than just ""how cool a car is."" And then everyone stand around and drive. There are different parts of the car people talk about, the engine, suspension, tires, interior, audio, history of cars and the people asociated with it, other meet ups or track days, etc. etc. 

I mean everyone has some kind of hobby. Just because I don't understand them (computer keyboards, watches, stamps, etc.) I still think they probably have a LOT to talk about and I just don't see it because either I'm ignorant or just not into them. 

I mean just look at this list of hobbies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies"
"The clothing is a uniform showing membership in the group. Same as wearing a jerseys to the sports bar, or the Bloods wear red, or people wear ties to work. However, some people do go overboard.  

For me, I see ties being just as silly as you see people wearing Tesla apparel, or probably both of us seeing someone wearing a powered wig."
"> The part of my post you didn't quote ""to each their own"" was my main point

I didn't quote it because it wasn't relevant. The fact that its so strange to you that people with similar interests like to get together and discuss those interests is strange in and of itself."
"Never just had a conversation with a stranger? Don't get out much, huh?"

"They are homonyms. I made an ass of myself to learn about the second meaning and thought other redditors might learn from my experience.

I used to go to a lot of corporate events and trade shows. Every one gave away promotional items, we called it swag.

I heard my cousin talk about some sneakers and he called them swag, when I asked how he got them free he was irritated at my stupid question and very proud of spending $400 on them. This Christmas my mother in law received a sweater and was very pleased to have some swag."

Look, the point isn’t judging someone based on fashion preference or race; it’s about the **symbolism** of that garment.

Corvettes and Porsches, some modded, plenty of old/restored ones.  Audi, BMW, very few modded but good to look at if some R8, i8, and some track/limited versions.  

Tesla, I feel like it’s a circle jerk"
"Yea see thats the difference. Most Tesla's are extremely similar, making for a sort of boring get together.

Its really not...
Not admitting to the special handshake is EXACTLY what someone who has a hidden special handshake would do. 
Used to do this when I rode street
The little 2-seater they had called the Sky is still one of my favorite stylings in that class.
"Exactly. There are lot of things that I don't view as hobbies, but I can see how OTHERS can be really passionate about them. Heck, I just learned that there are people who are really into computer keyboards!  And indeed as a car guy, the comment that you replied to definitely showed his lack of knowledge of car cultulre...which is not a knock against him...but definitely shows that just because it's not YOUR hobby doesn't mean there's nothing much to talk about...and this extends to all kinds of other hobbies"
"Of course, it's just not the same thing as this sub. "
"That's strangely fitting for Elon.  

He can't help but put his companies up against the wall on all in bets and so far has pulled it out of his ass each time."
"I'd love to. Even more I'd love to work for SpaceX. Moving to California isn't really feasible though. I have looked into Boca Chica. Either way, I need to finish out my military career before I even consider it."

"No, I legitimately love that he's a high power CEO who wears anime T-shirt's publicly. He doesn't give a *fuck*, and I love that."
"Idk I didn't have a hummer, I had a ""Big Wheels"" to peddle my ass around."
"I love cars and coffee, it's the only place I can see a slammed dually, kei cars, skylines, hot hatches, and super cars all at once. All cars are great when the owner is passionate. I just question the Dodge Dart club 😂"
"Meets like Cars and Coffee have more value to go to than a Tesla only one. People are intrigued by Teslas and Tesla owners can learn tips and tricks on car ownership. Unless the Tesla one is a party which is a different story.

"Subaru has a very tight-knit community and they promote many local events all over. They also have a pretty good Ambassador program where select Subaru owners are given money every quarter to buy swag and give it out to other owners or potential owners.

"Disagree. I've had more in depth off topic conversations in subreddits than I have about the sub itself. Conversing is conversing, it's not like a Tesla meet up is going to be... ""Yup, got a Tesla.

"I just enjoy seeing things I don't see everyday or with an owners touch.  I see Model 3/S/X daily, some are tinted, some with some parts blacked out, etc.  I just see them daily so I'm numb to them I guess.  

Do I like seeing some random shitbox that has been heavily modified with a huge turbo and no hood?  Sure, it's different and probably puts out more power than most cars on the road.  Do I like seeing a stock Lambo?  Sure but it doesn't tick the needle as much as something a little more rare like a Callaway Vette.  I just enjoy the sound of an ICE - although I may also get something electric for my daily commute if it turns to be too long."

For better, for worse, whatever your opinion of both is it's not the same thing. 

You might not think Tesla meetups are weird, and I'm not arguing they are, but the very existence of forums about Tesla doesn't really speak to the situation, because it's *such* a different medium people use for all kinds of reasons.

"""We parked Model 3 in an anechoic chamber, and let me tell you: all we heard was silence!"""
Must not be much wind in there
Honestly at any real speed it’s just as noisy as any other car I’ve been in
"I guess my Model 3 was built before they started paying attention to this. It doesn't have any rattles but it sure has a lot of road noise and wind noise.

&#x200B;"
Isn’t this exactly what every other manufacturer does? 
Wish the guys that built my jeep wrangler tried this 
"Let me preface: I love my Model 3. However, I do not think that overall my car is particularly quiet. It is quiet for a Tesla, esp compared to the 2012 P85+ my father in law had, but I don't consider it truly luxury levels of quiet. I think at the price point it lands at, maybe its hard to add any more insulation/sound deadening. Most Benz/Lexus/BMW cars I've been driven in are much quieter."
Isn’t this something that should’ve been done during development? The car has been in production for over 18 months now
"Lol,

Why do I have rattle noise from the sun shades in my X ?  Too busy with outside sounds ?
"
Must not have the shake table in there to capture all the rattles my car is riddled with and no repair in sight 
if only they tested for the rattle noises...
Yea right? Wind noise is so damn loud. 
[deleted]
"Where is the giant fan?  Pretty sure you can't accurately simulate 70 mph highway wind noise in that chamber.

Tip:  Try moving the car thru the atmosphere quickly, and study that."
I wonder if Tesla could upgrade the stereo with some noise cancellation...remotely.
"Not sure when they started this but mine is far from quiet. I get a faint rattle from front driver side at speeds exactly 64 mph or above (must have something to do with aerodynamics?).

Tesla Service seems to think its something in the A pillar. Took it in for service and now I have an annoying chrip sound coming from the front passenger side caliper when turning the wheel. This noise wasn’t there when I took my car in for service. 

*sigh*"
"Totally forgot to throw small road debris at inner fender where there’s no liner.

Love my car, but can hear every single grain of sand on the road."
Well shit that’s great and all but I find my model 3 LR is loud as fuck on the freeway! 
"Since the music doesn't start automatically, and takes several minutes to even be ready to play from the usb, I hear all the squeaks and noise in my 3 until the USB is functional. It has more cabin noise than my camry hybrid had, but the 3 is more quiet on the highway at speed. However, that's subjective, not measured."
That way you can hear perfect silence when the USB music player crashes 
"Like every other auto maker. I like tesla, but sometimes .."
Should test drive it here in Sweden. You know those charts with decibels that always end with a jet aircraft lifting off? The step after that is a swedish highway. We use some sort of extra durable asphalt because of everyone using studded tires. Sounds like you're driving through a battleground.
Hey I’m acoustic. This is offensive. 
"We drove our Model 3 in California over the San Mateo bridge going west (to SFO) and the grooves in the road and our 19"" wheels made so much cabin noise that my wife had to mute a conference call. Almost too loud for us to talk. You won't find a bigger fan than me of Model 3, but I don't think the car is particularly well insulated for sound. Yes, it's a very quiet car, but I agree with anyone who says that at highway speeds above 60mph it's just average for a luxury car, and not as good as a ""quiet"" high-end luxury sedan. That having been said, I didn't buy it to be a high-end luxury sedan that is built to be fancy furniture mostly."
I want that spoiler 
Looks like Tesla is about to start off 2019 with dropping an album.
We’ve identified the source of rumble. Steve in engineering has to stop eating Taco Bell. 
Sorry Tesla but the Audi e-tron is game changing silent
Tesla just fires a bunch of people and this is Twitter pr 
Why would anyone want a super quiet car in the first place
Now if they could fix the ride so I can actually drive the speed limit down the road to my house.  The bounce is so bad because of the frost/thaw heaving of the road. 
The rooms are awesome.  I wish I could live in one.
Good for... sneaking up on people??
"In my car, the source of the noise is pretty obvious. It’s my children. Anything for that?"
Anyone else having thoughts of farting in this room. 
I want to touch all of those walls.
Hopefully they test out sex in the back seat. Don't want people to hear ya

And they forgot to put the dyno and mics up... come on Tesla!
Link to actual Twitter post: https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1086055977974034432
...and some EVs have speakers built in just for the passengers to “enjoy” the engine noise (poorly recorded from ‘traditional sport cars)
"On my S85, it’s really the wheels and tires that make the most noise. But that’s just how it goes, I seriously doubt the noise dampening can get much better without making it stupidly expensive. Get softer tires I guess?"
Wow. Every car manufacturer does that.
Wouldn't it be too silent?
Thats hilarious. But they do this with all (luxury) vehicles
Yeah that’s cool 
All I have to do is turn up the stereo with some bass and the car rattles like a corolla. I think they can do a lot better. 
Meanwhile in Switzerland Teslas must have aucustic driving sounds by law soon. 
Holy smokes 😨😱😱😱😱
Looks like Goku in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber 
"Thought that said aquatic testing.  

But really, how is that set up testing tire noise, wind noise and body flex noise?"
What about that stupid hiss I get from the passenger side footwell?
"They should focus on fixing the ""clunk"" sound coming from the front drive unit gear lash. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyIVpwieFt4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyIVpwieFt4)"
How will they find all the console rattles? The car isn’t moving!
What about hearing emergency vehicles?
"I wonder what I will hear if I go in with my golf V, 1.9tdi, 2006 !! "
"Considering it doesn't have an ICE engine and it's priced like an entry luxury car, the Tesla 3 is pretty noisy. "
What is the purring sound that intermittently comes from the front area after a quick acceleration?  (Model 3) =The most noticeable sound  at low speed. Sounds like a pump.
This must be the Kato Antenna Chamber.
"I really wish you'd figure out how to reduce the noise from the glass roof panels and windshield where everything meets. The Model 3 doesn't use seals like I've seen on any other car. Typically every other car has plastic or metal trim over any seals or at least a thick rubber gasket, model 3 doesn't."
They need to do this in cold temperatures. 
how do the wheels go in circles
I walked by a Tesla that was on today. Just silent. Like I’d imagine I’d feel if a silent craft flew over my head. Get a little eerie actually. 
Now if only my loud ass Honda Civic went through that same testing
"So an interesting point I’ve heard from a few friends is that they don’t want a Tesla because “car noises and feel” are part of the experience they want and electric vehicles by and large don’t give that haptic feedback.

What are people on this subs opinion on this?"
thats weird though. the state of california mandated ev car manufacturer to have noise over 75 db when cruising around because otherwise pedestrians wouldnt hear them coming. and this law could probably be applied in the whole country as well as canada too. I wonder what is tesla's take on this.
Can you hear the owner inside screaming that he wants his old clunker back?
Can it be considered a lemon at that point?
"If this isn’t commitment to quality, I don’t know what is. "
Is the data reception any better in there?
"this is fucking retarded. as it is, electric cars are so quiet that some EVs produce sounds to alert pedestrians about them. and here we have a company struggling to stay afloat pouring money into frivolous things like this. bitch, no one complained about an EV not being quiet enough. you keep spending money on silly things like this and some Chinese company with it's head not in the sand will come take your breakfast, lunch and dinner overnight."
"Why is that even a selling point? I’ve never ever cared how loud my car was. Maybe if I drove a truck or something I’d care about it being quieter. But electric cars are already quiet enough to hit pedestrians without them even noticing a big metal box is coming at them, so at this point they’re just investing money in funny headlines. "
"No wonder they’re tanking, what a waste if time. Should’ve got those union workers in there elon, you hired a bunch of ex McDonald’s burger flippers and now your company sucks. You deserve it jackass"
I want to masturbate in there so i can hear myself cumming.
5 out of 5 Stars!  0 decibels
Someone should tell them that they can't test wind noise and road buzz (tire noise) in an anechoic chamber. Because the Model 3 has much louder wind noise and road buzz than any other $35-50k car I've ever driven. I love my 3 but man the roaring noise from the tires while driving at highway speeds. It's a good thing the sound system is so robust in the car (and also a bit sad because it's kind of going to waste) because I can just turn the music up to drown out some of the road buzz.
Year 1990 and 100k miles @ 145 mph: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1vZenBX4-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1vZenBX4-0)
Noise comes from moving not parking. 
Wonder if they heard those shots being fired. 
"Wind noise and tire noise, those are what matter. I’ve never understood the idea that engine noise is significant at all. My Acura runs at like 1700 rpm going freeway speeds, 8 speed transmission. I realize the Tesla engine is even quieter, but who cares? I want to know how the road noise compares. "
This ^
Thanks frameless windows!
That’s because the road noises are much louder than the sound of a small engine
Our 3 is much louder at every speed than our S.  Wish they did this testing before they shipped any cars out to customers. 
"I find it nosier than many cars in its segment. Acoustic glass should have been part of the premium package.

And I feel it can use more underbody NVH insulation against the tire noises."
I've found it really depends on the road
I have a diesel Jeep Grand Cherokee and have driven the Model 3 a handful of times.  I disagree with you.  All I hear now is my loud ass motor.
12xxx vin here. Road noise is soooooo bad. 
"I used a phone decibal read. It was about 10 decibals lower than a 3 series at highway speed and lower going slower.

That said im not sure how good it was because turning on the air on both only raised it by like 2 and that's pretty noisy."
Totally.
"When cruising. Definitely depends on the situation, though. If I actually wanted to access the 150 hp of my old 1 series I had to rev it up to over 5,000 rpm - at which point it was considerably louder than any EV at any (non-highway) speed."
I would say especially because of that feedback they are now testing for it but I dunno as I don't frequent their forums. At least they're doing something about issues rather than just ignore them like other companies in other businesses even. :)
Happy birthday
"Yes, and a lot of suppliers as well."

Even one of the motorsports teams at my university does this with their research vehicles.

That was the absolute worst part of my wrangler ownership. I could hear every groan and creak from the engine. Made me think that I was about to break down.
What year is your wrangler?
Everyone on the road wishes you didnt buy it already
How does it compare to an Accord or Camry in the highway?  We test drive one but only up to 45.
Its just a fancy picture for their fancy tweet
"yikes, really?"
"My 08 Civic's cabin is quieter then the M3s cabin at highway speeds. Completely forget about comparing it to a merc or Audi from this generation. I consider selling my car everyday at this point but I would get screwed since it's so new.

What they need is active noise cancelling and better aero Dynamics"
">wind

This. its the lack of seals on the roof"
"Pls read wikipedia article about wave field synthesis. Anything can be simulated. The simulation needs the controlled environment (anechoic chamber).

Edit add: The DC component (wind) can be omitted. The WFS system can construct the turbulence sound and point sound sources like tires. Such works for passive isolation and active cancellation research."
What makes you think they don't \*also\* do sound testing on the actual road? Hint: They do. All car makers do.

"There’s a reason they are testing in a quiet invironment. They just minimize the noise produced by the car. Like tires and wind noise from side mirrors. Making it as aerodinamic as possible. But noise from outside is always hearable unless you buy a New BMW 7 series, Mercedes S Class or Audi A8. Those cars actually have silent windows to keep out all sound pretty much. It’s not cost efficient to put windows like that in the Model 3"
It often makes more noise charging when the fans kick on for the battery coolant than it does driving.
It isn't. Every auto manufacturer does this. 
Anechoic chambers are specifically designed to block radio signals.
"Have you actually been in one? I am in the opposite boat, where I don't think they have done enough of this. My 08 Civic's cabin is quieter then the M3s cabin at highway speeds.

Your mother would be proud. 
I’d rather it be like -40dB but I guess I’ll take 0

"The wind noise is no joke.  Haven’t pulled the trigger, but found this:

https://www.rpmtesla.com/products/model-3-windshield-wind-noise-reduction-kit

I’m sure this a YMMV thing depending on the variable panel gap idiosyncrasies of your car."
When was yours built?
That’s some soft core Cinemax after hours entertainment music they got going on in that video. 
They took it straight into the heart
Slap some Tesla tires on your car and see how that goes. They are a specific MPN and ride quietly.
"Any engine vs an electric is no contest.

No matter how dinky the engine."
"Model 3 has a drag coefficient of like 0.22 seriously among the lowest ever. Regular cars like a Mercedes C class can be more like 0.32

I assume being more slippery helps with wind noise 🤷‍♂️ "
"FYI, in general more cylinders and more displacement (and later EVO) makes for quieter engines.

The loud exhausts you hear are basically due to poorly muffled engines. "
Maybe it was never intended to be as quiet as the S because it's half the price?
"It's that noticeable? The S is not particularly quiet, especially in the rear seats"
"I should actually test this, but I'm pretty sure my S is much louder than my 3 at highway speeds."
Yea that’s true with all cars though.
I've hit patches of fresh pavement and the car goes nearly silent.  
"I think we have loud tires with the primacys, pilot sport 4s is where it’s at "
"10 decibels? Yeah your measurement is wrong since 10 decibels is almost the difference between a 5 years old corolla and a Rolls Royce at highway speed.
"
"Yea but in a car like that you (or at least most people) are actually paying for the engine noise. I used to drive a Mustang GT and a standard Subaru Impreza. I don't, for a second, miss the Impreza's engine noise. But damn if I don't miss that GT V8. Then again, my TM3 beats that thing in **so many** other ways its not really a competition."
CAKEDAY. Say it. Not birthday.
"Yep, seeing a lot of typical Tesla fanboy reaction to basic industry testing procedures. "
"Are you confusing this with a wind tunnel?

There's not a lot of reason for a motorsport team to need to use an anechoic chamber."
Thanks for funding the chamber!
I wish the guys that built my model 3 tried this. 
That's a damn shame for the amount of money you pay for a model X. Tesla should really look at collaborating with [Bose to help out with noise cancellation inside the cabin](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/aejit1/noisecanceling_tech_of_bose_will_soon_be_in_cars/).
[deleted]
How bad is the X?
"> Made me think that I was about to break down.

Owning a Jeep didn't make you think that already?"
"It's a Jeep. You are always about to break down. 

I'm also a Jeep owner. "
I have an 07 that I love to death. They just have a lot of road noise since the doors and roof are fairly light so that you can easily remove them. 
"Honestly, the modern Accord or Camry is just as quiet. And those two cars are much more spacious than the compact Model 3..

The only reasons to go for the Model 3, IMO:

1. Tax benefit (CA residents get $3750 Federal and $2500 State Tax rebates)

2. The name/brand image or the looks. 

3. Saving money on refueling costs, esp if you have solar panels. I basically have erased my dueling costs as my solar completely covers the cost of my daily driving recharging needs. 

4. The handling and performance. This car is extremely responsive and handles like a go-kart. I love it, and I’m a diehard fan of performance gasoline cars esp vintage cars, but this is just so much fun to drive. 

If your commute is not too bad, go for the base model, add a few features esp Autopilot but keep it under $40k out the door and it’s a great car. it is small, Civic sized on the inside. Barely enough space for my two kids’ car seats in the back. Maybe look at the Honda Clarity plug-in hybrid as your alternative before you decide. "
oh yeah.  B pillar rattle. The speaker grills on the passenger door was not clipped in.  The B Pillar on the passenger side has the same issues as the driver.  The back seat has a metal tap tap tap sound from the back seat. I have had a few of these fixed but only in passing as they try to fix the paint or replace things that the body shop they hired messed up. I am on month 4 of this car.  Tesla has had it over 1.5 months.  I am done with Tesla after this car.  I do not care how amazing the car is if you can not provide service in a decent time and communicate and get it done right what good is it.  Car need service even EV.  This is truly heart breaking I have wanted nothing more than to go Green and EV and this was my shot. I am looking at how much loss I would take to walk away 
Not true!! What about sex? 
"As much as Elon likes to conjecture that we're all living in a simulation, I find the actual wind noise at the top of my TM3 windshield at normal highway speeds, to be uncomfortably loud.

Maybe if real world tests with actual wind were used, they would have solved this issue earlier than they did (May 2018 Windshield Redesign) for my car.

Based on the high number of complaints about TM3 wind noise in this thread, and the existence of a retrofit kit and YouTube videos to help reduce the wind issue...

https://www.rpmtesla.com/products/model-3-windshield-wind-noise-reduction-kit

... maybe anechotic simulation alone may not be the answer to building better cars.

"
"I'm not sure it's that obvious. The car already has microphones for the bluetooth. If they only target lower frequencies, that might be sufficient."
"Not just quietness, the model 3 lacks a full wheel well guard.  Look above the front tires and compare to a model S or other car. 

I’m used to it now, just noticed it after returning the service center model S loaner.  Model S was way quieter."
isn't that on the Performance models?  think I've seen them. 
r/woooosh

"Oh, that makes since, ty for clarification."
"Just amazing. I find it interesting that Porsche is developing a noise to make when the car drives, because it is *too* quiet for some people. Obviously not a combustion engine noise, but something that would sound like an electric car, yet amplified. I'd be interested to see what they come up with. "
I have to seriously doubt that. I’m been in significantly more expensive cars that have much more significant road noise 
"Errr - No. They're specifically designed to prevent sound waves echoing. You *can* have an RF Anechoic chamber, but is still just designed to prevent RF ""echoing"". These would be made to block RF from outside, but only so that you don't have interference. But making a regular anechoic chamber RF proof is utterly pointless."
Anechoic Chambers can be acoustic or RF. Not sure why you're being downvoted. 
🤣😂🤣 you thought I was asking a serious question?
huh?
"The Model 3 literally has a top 5 coefficient of drag....among EVERY car. Clearly, you know NOTHING about aerodynamics. "
"Oh. Well, the post hit the popular page so you get people like me who don’t know nothin. Have fun!"
"Building the massive chamber and wasting money on something so asinine. American consumers want value, they don’t require this level of coddling"
She is proud of me but her support of me masturbating is just a cherry on top.
"For those who are wondering why on earth Tesla is using an anechoic chamber to sound-proof the Model 3, Tesla is probably doing two types of sound testing:

- In this anechoic chamber **they are injecting road noise patterns via speakers in the chamber**. This would test how good noise insulation is and whether there's any undue resonance of any of the thousands of components within the Model 3. For this test the car has to be 100% still and the chamber has to be anechoic to make sure any deviation from the inserted sound patterns is from the car itself, not an echo from the walls. They are very likely using an array of microphones both within and outside the car to analyze the noise. (They might even be able to use the accelerometers within the car to detect vibrations that are too low frequency for the microphones to pick up. They might also be using the speakers of the car itself to test for resonances. Audio quality of the Model 3 premium sound system is phenomenal.)
- As **for road testing, Tesla uses microphones within the car** and real roads and test tracks. Via triangulation they can identify the probable source of the noise.

I believe many of the early Model 3 noise/rattle problems were debugged by owners making (voice) bug reports on the road and technicians extracted the data remotely.

So sound-proofing of the Model 3 has improved *a lot* from early 2018 models and it's very good now (especially if you factor in the lack of engine noise) - but it's still not as good as the Model S or as some of the German competition: the Mercedes S-class is the undisputed sound isolation champion in that regard.

But ... the sound environment of cars is a highly subjective topic: go and take a test-drive of these cars and experience them first-hand - they are all good. 😀"
As a data point.  My Nov 18 build Model 3 has no perceptible wind noise.  Road noise on the other hand...that's a different story.  But I also have the 20s -- so perhaps a bit self inflicted there.

Damn ULA snipers
Damn didn’t k ow Tesla makes tires. 
Prius tires work too
"This is true at like 20 mph, but I don’t agree it matters much what type of engine you have on the freeway. What I’m saying is that the road noise from freeway driving is like 99% created by the tires on the cement, and the wind in the mirrors. The engine is nearly a non issue at that speed. 

So what matters most is how well the undercarriage and wheel wells are insulated/sealed. That’s awesome that Tesla is working on those topics, but it has nothing to do with electric vs ICE whatsoever. 

I do worry that electric cars may actually be at a little of a disadvantage overall, because they tend to be designed more carefully with weight savings in mind. In contrast, a big heavy Cadillac that weighs a million pounds could potentially be easier to insulate, simply because the designers are unrestrained with regards to weight, so they can go hog-wild with the thickness of the insulating pads.

My crown vic is soooooooo quiet I love it 
"Well its based on how little your engine needs to work to keep moving.

More power, not necessarily cylinders and displacement, makes for quieter operation at lower revs.

And still a fuck load louder than any tesla. And rather inefficient."
Is this why Rolls' have seemingly-unnecessarily massive engines?
"That’s probably the reason.  Though our S was only about $11k more than our 3, both new."
Then why try and show off with all these pictures if the end result is a car that’s louder than most other vehicles in its price range? Seems misleading to me. 
So half the price is acoustic material....
"I never sit in the back but for us the front is noticeably quieter when you compare back to back. Other people on our local Tesla Facebook group also mentioned that their 3 was louder. The newer S, especially after the 2016 refresh are much quieter than the earlier cars. Also RWD cars don’t have the noise from the front motors. "
"Mine whistles pretty loudly. Perhaps I can hear it more easily with no motor noise, but it's definitely louder than I would expect. "
"I think the S is quieter for the front passenger seats and louder for the rear passenger seats, especially if 3 are sitting in the back."
"On really nice roads, the engine noise becomes a factor at some point. With the model 3 it is much quieter. "
https://i.imgflip.com/2rfbq9.jpg
"I agree, there are noisy roads and silent ones!"
It’s louder than a new civic. Tires won’t fix it. Lol.
"For the unaware, including me, why is that so surprising?

I expect the 3 series to not be as loud as a corolla, and I expect the Rolls Royce to not be as loud as a Model 3 so the spread seems reasonable to me.

Edit: ffs, I just asked a question..."
"Mostly agree regarding the V8, but certainly not in the case of a 150 hp 4 cylinder - which is neither particularly quick nor pleasant sounding. It’s just loud."
"We use it for a GM-sponsored competition called EcoCAR. The team converts a GM product into a hybrid-electric vehicle. Noise, vibration and harshness are worth a lot of points in the competition because the car needs to be showroom quality. 

The team puts the car on a dyno in an anechoic chamber to isolate noise sources. 

I'm at The Ohio State University. Our anechoic chamber is at The Ohio State Center for Automotive Research. "
Idk about GM but Ford's main full sized wind tunnel is also an anechoic chamber. So two birds one stone.
Oof.
"That tech was invented in 1934, and first installed in cars by lotus in the late 80s. The Bose headphone implementation of it isn’t that great btw.

"No:) it’s not that bad. I’m pretty happy in general. Road noise could be improved, but only because you notice it more in an EV. Honestly the only persistent issue I have with noise in my X  is a squeaking that comes from the middle passenger seat in the 7-seat configuration. This is a well documented issue in places like TMC forums, and can be corrected by just moving the rear seats forward a notch instead of all the way back."
Once the initial cool factor wore off(a pulley sheared off and I broke my bank account fixing it) I realized how bad of a purchase it was and traded it for a Honda Fit. Best trade of my life. Didn’t know enough about Jeep reliability before that.
"Had a wrangler 99’ and I’ll tell you ... it looked good from far away but was far from good. 

Poor mileage 
Poor radio
Uncomfortable

Glad I replaced with my Prius which was replaced with my Model 3"
Oh ok good to know
"I hadn’t driven the Clarity yet so I went at lunchtime today. Its battery was almost dead so I couldn’t test electric only mode. Running as a hybrid it is much quieter than my 2012 Camry ride was also very smooth and quiet. We are going to try it and the Accord hybrid on Saturday. 

We both loved the quietness and fun of the 3. Hybrids are so damn boring.  

The companies long term outlook makes me pause. It is such an unknown and with all the fake negativity it is difficult to determine real issues versus the shorts hat want the company to fail. "
"S or 3? Our S had a couple minor rattles but the 3 design has rubber at almost all seams near the dash, and we haven’t heard any rattles yet.."
There is an escalate to management button in your Tesla online portal. Have you tried that? Sorry for your experience. That sucks. 
N=1
Tesla really needs to step up and clear these issues up because once Audi and Porsche step into this game its going to be a easy call if tesla can't get the quality issues under control. 
"Haha, my “anything” wasn’t for such wide scope!"
">wind

whatever that fix was def didnt fix the issue on my sept built 116k vin. The kit helps some on headwinds but crosswinds are still bad as it doesn't really seal the corners well"

"Aero Dynamics might be the wrong word since our dialog is more about moise. It's wind pushing between the mirror and the window at speed that causes most of the noise. If the mirror was designed in the different fashion you wouldn't have this problem. 

But I just speak from first hand experience, not an aerodynamics engineer like yourself. "
Good read thanks for your input 
"I don't like Mercedes that much, but the smoothness and silence of the S-Class is \*amazing\*. "
Any chance my early model can be traded for a new one? Lol.
"Audio perception is tricky. Depending on broadband vs narrow band, freq content, harmonics, different sounds with the same energy will be perceived differently. We’re better at relative measurement than absolute.  I really feel like the absence of motor noise makes the wind and road noise much more apparent.

Driving a model 3 daily you get sensitized to it. My gf complains about the wind noise on hers. Going back and forth between an ICE and the model 3, for me the difference is obvious and I roll my eyes at her."
[deleted]
and you're to blame
You can contact a tire manufacturer and get their list of Tesla OE tire part numbers and order those in the sizes available anywhere
They get manufacturers to make them specific specializations of tires they already made with special unique features. Tesla goes for acoustic dampening in everything they sell to their customers at the service center. These are available at tire stores if and only if you snag the right MPN which may not be stocked. Generally they need to be shipped. there are often 2-4 MPN's of a single type of tire in a single size. Only one is a Tesla oe tire. Mercedes also does this.

"ya, i don't want to die, tesla tires are badass, Pilot Sport 3, MXM4, or Pilot Super Sport 245/265 staggered, and you want me to put those 195mm michelin energy saver allseason deathwheels on?  
I will say that I'm very disappointed with the widths of Tesla tire offerings. My last car was 275mm square. It was excellent and I will miss that in the Tesla. But, quietness and OE-ness is kinda worth it...at least for one set of tires maybe......."
"Vibration is what I'm thinking of more. And with the exception of luxury cars, economy cars tend to have simple exhausts and small engines, making them loud and horrible sounding at all rpms. And performance cars are loud by design. 

All of them however produce a lot of vibration and it's a night and day when compared to an electric. 

Weight isn't really a Tesla problem though. Model s weighs as much as an h2 hummer :/"
"Dope thanks.

I must have been looking at the last gen or something."
Crazy that the 5er is that low -- great tho!
"Bear in mind:

* 2019 BMW 3 should ostensibly be at 0.22 (https://www.motor1.com/news/265693/bmw-3-series-drag-coefficient/)


* CLA was only 0.22 for BlueEfficiency 180 ed; a variant that did not appear to be available stateside. IINM (at least not in the past.)  Otherwise it was at 0.23 & 0.26 Cd, but upcoming CLA should ostensibly be at 0.22 (stateside availability of 0.22 Cd spec. TBD)

* New A-Class should be 0.22 Cd as well, although I'd like to see independent stateside wind tunnel tests.

It won't apply stateside (i.e., United States), since US DOT (Department of Transportation) regulations (IIRC) mandate side mirrors (camera in lieu of mirror not allowed) with exception --along with omitting steering wheel etc.-- for level 5 autonomy vehicles (and maybe L4 as well IINM.)

"These Cd's appear overly optimistic for the ICE vehicles. Considering they have to air cool the radiator behind the front grill. Out of curiosity I checked the Audi A4 reference from wikipedia, where 0.26 instead of 0.23 is given.

So I bet the others are also between 0.26-0.30

I wouldn't be surprised if it's like NEDC and to a lesser extent WLTP(Deceive the consumer). They probably wrap the entire car so there are no intakes or seems and remove the mirrors and put the car in the the wind test tunnel. Ergo results that have no relation to reality.

"
"Exhaust noise is really based on frequency, cylinder pressure at EVO, and backpressure.  Cylinder pressure at EVO for a given torque request is super-heavily dependent on displacement.   Frequency is 100% related to number of cylinders and engine speed.  

I mean you can try to make it for lower number of cylinders up by changing gears but that usually makes noise worse, not better.  And on top of that I'm not sure that Tesla's are really an NVH dream.... at 'idle' it certainly is but not every engine idles any more, and in five or ten years, nearly no cars will idle.  At highway speeds the Tesla 3 is louder than an Audi A4.

I'm really happy Tesla is doing what they're doing, but let's not pretend they're doing something they're not, or succeeding where they're not."
"I dunno, I'd say that it's 90% marketing and 10% better-ness.  Bigger is better according to those purchasing RR.  

Bigger really is better in terms of noise and vibration though, and BMW has put a 6.6L into a rolls.  The cars weigh 2.5 metric tons though (5500 lbs give or take) so it's not like they're severely oversized."
Your model 3 also has a bigger battery than your S. By 25%.
"My ‘13 S (now in the boneyard) used to whistle around 85. And, jk, I told the SvC tech and he said, “Well don’t drive 85!”"
"And, because there *isn't* that drone of a thousand explosions every minute, you can perceive more of the road noise than you would otherwise.

Still - I am not gonna lie, I'm looking forward to what Rolls-Royce do with their first electric car in a few years."
"You are right, I agree. Unfortunately my 50 mile commute has none of those roads"
I'll mute the radio when that happens and just soak it all in.
That's cause the new Civic and accords are very well engineered cars for their price point.
Well ya but I think it’s around 40% tire noise and 60% wind. 
">I expect the 3 series to not be as loud as a corolla, and I expect the Rolls Royce to not be as loud as a Model 3 so the spread seems reasonable to me.

That means the spread will be a lot less than 10 decibel, wouldn't it?

It would go from Corolla -> 3 series -> Model 3 -> Rolls Royce.

In fact, if you look up Car & Driver's test, at 70mph both the Model 3 and 3 series has 69dB, so they are *exactly* the same lol.

The new 3 series will be much quieter, it's the same class as Model 3, but it has an engine/exhaust but way better NVH insulation overall."
I see. That's an interesting definition of motorsports :)
"You can also take it in to be fixed! I did, and they knew exactly what I was referring to. "
"I mean it’s a truck that serves a purpose. It’s not meant to be a fuel efficient commuter vehicle. They were designed to rock crawl and overland. 

Glad you found a replacement though! "
Hope you don't mind me asking but...you went from a Wrangler to a Prius (and then to a Model 3)? 
"If you're interested in more info feel free to pm me. I've had mine for like 6 years and haven't had any issues, I really don't think they are as problematic as everyone makes them out to be. "
"My new S has a screw rolling around in the driver’s door, I hear it every time I turn hard or stomp on the accelerator. Super annoying."
Same here. No rattle issues.

"Oh I have it is totally worthless.  I even had a back channel to HQ direct to some one who has high levels of power.  That has not gotten this resolved.  They can not get parts from Freemont to Nashville TN in sub 3 weeks. They can not get them right.  The car is still not fully fixed.  The car drives but it is still not 100% and has not been for the 4 months I have owned it. They had it a solid month of it is life.  Still nothing. I am just slack jawed. 
"
Quality is Quality. I am fine if you have crummy quality some of the best stuff has questionable quality. The catch is top flight care. Tesla does not have top flight care right now 
The most recent one I can think of was my best friends Mercedes GLE. It was atrocious on the highway and pretty much anything over 35 for road noise. Also my BIL’s 2017 Genesis something Sedan. It was also horrid with wind noise. Anyone with music slightly louder than normal at any stop light you could hear clear as day. It was also pretty poorly temperature insulated.
"\+1 for another, my early Aug 2018 build has no high amounts of wind noise."
I give everything a bad name.

The whole front of the S is [heat exchangers](https://i.imgur.com/xcTz8aY.jpg), lmao. "
"I'm not arguing that Tesla's are the most luxurious ride by any means. Just comparing the two powerplants.

When it comes to NVH there is no comparison between an ice and an AC motor. And the V is a big part of that.

Audi A4 with stop start is quiet at idle *with the motor off* but you still have increased vibrations when it starts and significantly more vibrations at all operating speeds.

It's not what I'm talking about or relevant but Tesla should really improve on their sound deadening in their vehicles."
"The batteries are physically about the same capacity about 75 kWh but the 3 is more efficient. The S is software locked to 208 miles of range but can be unlocked to 249 miles for $2k to be a S 75. I don’t really need the range since 208 miles on our S has worked fine for all our road trips. Mostly from ATL to Orlando/Miami, annual Christmas trip to central Illinois and once to New York. It is faster to drive in our 3 but we feel more tired after driving all day due to the louder cabin. "
"The road noise in my Model 3 is still louder than the engine noise + road noise of at least a few cars on the highway though. I've noticed I need to turn the music up louder to drown it out, and talk louder to hold a conversation than in other new cars that I test drove. I also have some pretty crappy highways near me, but it seems like my Model 3 doesn't prevent road noise as well as other cars. On nice smooth highways though, it's glorious how almost silent the car is."
"> I'm looking forward to what Rolls-Royce do with their first electric car in a few years.

Probably nothing considering the 6.6L twin-turbo V12 already sounds like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyqNVhZNAO4)."
and make a mental note of what road did it and go that way whenever possible.
My 55k$ car is more poorly engineered than an 18k$ one? Yikes!
"> That means the spread will be a lot less than 10 decibel, wouldn't it?

No idea to be honest. That's why I asked. 

>In fact, if you look up Car & Driver's test, at 70mph both the Model 3 and 3 series has 69dB, so they are exactly the same lol.

That doesn't surprise me too much. Cruising at 70mph it's wind and road noise I'd expect more than engine noise. 70mph wouldn't demand too much from a 3 series engine that it'd be making a racket.

Hopefully Tesla can improve the sound deadening though all the same."
"lol... Exactly this. I don't understand people that buy Wranglers and then complain about things like fuel economy, road handling, creature comforts, etc.... I mean no one buys a prius then complains about ground clearance, fording depth, suspension travel, etc... "
Your right!
"A screw came off our ours early on which made our interior grab handle flex. I stopped by and the service center opened up the door, while I stood there, and fixed it. "
Have you taken it in to have it fixed? Seems like a rare issue that Tesla would happily take care of
"That sucks. I’ve been 100% unimpressed with Tesla as a company. They seem completely incompetent and dysfunctional, but at least my car is great. Your story pains me."
Do they provide you another Tesla while they fix yours? 
[deleted]
You played your part and I played my game!
"I can't park enough cars to bother with a 'track' car so for me my sticky tires go on the fastest driving comfy car I have, and all of my tires are quiet because all of my cars are comfortable. 2 super super comfortable cars and one that doesn't cost anything to run and is still fairly comfy (but rolls the least! best candidate for sticky rubber....aaaaaand fuckin limited to 245/265....ooookay)

Going to widebody that one at some point because the rubber limitation is a serious limitation."
You tell me what has more cooling requirements. A 90%+ efficient electric motor or a <30% efficient ICE engine.
Originally a s60? Charges up rater steadily up to 90/95%? 
"Oh sure - if there’s one thing I’ve learned about EVs, it’s that to get an ICEV with similar kit, you’d typically be knocking at least 10K off. And that’s 10K off the short range versions. And that includes sound damping. "
"There’s definitely a bit of engine noise there still. 

Although the funniest review of the wraith was the one that mentioned they’d once tried to lock it, and they couldn’t because the engine was still running. They hadn’t realised because at idle it was so quiet. "
"Incidentally, Rolls-Royce Wraith also preemptively shifts gears based on GPS to further minimize cabin engine noise when cruising. (https://www.engadget.com/2013/03/06/rolls-royce-wraith-picks-gears-using-gps/)"
Your year one model isn't as polished as a 2019 civic
"Honestly, when it comes to fatigue and annoyance, frequency also plays a huge part along with decibel reading. That part is still largely unknown when talking about raw dB measurements. "
"That's because nobody buys a Prius for offroad, but plenty of people buy a Wrangler for purely road duties. Taking off the doors and stuff in the summer is pretty cool, but unless you're taking it offroad consistently it simply isn't worth it IMO."
This is good to know. Thanks.
6 times over 4 months with a total out of service time of about 7 weeks.  They have been afforded every opportunity.  I was a totally chill cat up till week 5 and then / trip 5 and that’s when i got a bit put out 
Yeah.  The company has been  very lack luster to work with.  The local people are friendly.  They lack parts and any sort of power to make it right.

Tesla it is your lucky to own this magical unicorn.  
"Not for more than 80% of the time down. I got a
Cheap enterprise rental maxima they was horrible.  Then after I pushed them and hq I got a Tesla on week 4 of 6 they had it.  They need it again for more work I am sure it will be another sad rental from enterprise.  This is about the worst experience.  "
"Yeah, it is kinda a disappointment "
">	A 90%+ efficient electric motor or a <30% efficient ICE engine.

The efficiency only tells you which system produces more heat, but doesn’t tell you what the cooling *requirements* are. Basically batteries/motors need to be cooled to a much lower operating temperature than ICE drivetrain, if the batteries reach the temperature of say... an ICE car’s combustion chamber, it wouldn’t be pretty.

Edit: I am wrong, see comment below."
"Considering the Model S overheats and goes into limp mode not even 4 minutes into a Nurburgring lap, yes, I would say it's chronically and objectively not able to keep up with it's own heat generation and very much does not have enough cooling capacity.

Which isn't to point out in either case an electric or ICE will not be using anywhere near the max cooling capacity of the radiator, and most airflow requirements comes from the air conditioning, which is constant regardless of the car.

2 of the 3 heat exchangers, the large ones on the outside, drive the S' air conditioning, and these need airflow though them to function.

I would be very interested to know why you think, say, the Model 3's traditional [stacked condenser/radiator](https://i.imgur.com/tnrqRmc.jpg) arrangement is anything more interesting than 'normal' for the car industry."
"Ich there are many things at play when it comes to airflow and cd values.  
As an example the air in cars like the a4 or c-class is guided through the front part of the car with defined entry and exit points. In the model 3 the air simply get dumped in the front part and has to find its own way resulting in a worse drag coefficient. "
"True, but most that heat energy lost in an ICE is through the tail pipe and not the radiators. The radiators will only account for about \~30% of the lost energy, so the cooling requirements aren’t as extreme as it would seem.

Also, I think your 90%+ is likely to be pretty optimistic by the time you go from battery>inverter>electric motor.

&#x200B;"
"One advantage of the locked battery, other than the savings at the time we purchased, is that we can charge to full all the time and it represents about 86% of the actual capacity. While supercharging, it will indicate 100% while still delivering about 36 kw.  The charging behavior is the same as setting a S 75 to charge to ~86%. "
Lol true and sad 
"The fact of the matter is, the wrangler is not designed to be a purely road going vehicle.  I know there are plenty of people who buy them with no intention of going off road, and that is fine,but to then come back around and complain about its shortcomings, which are a result of its off road capabilities, is just dumb. "

What happened in the end? Fixed or did you end up selling?
"This isn't really true. Moving the car requires a given amount of energy that's the same for EVs and ICEs. If you are 90% efficient you generate only 11 units of heat for every 100 units of car movement. If you are 30% efficient you generate 230 units of heat for every 100 units of car movement. So the amount of heat you need to remove is 21 times higher in the ICE car. The fact that the ICE car operates at a higher temperature is not really relevant, once that temperature is reached (very quickly) all this extra heat is still being generated and needs to be removed."
Not all of its shortcomings are the result of off-roading capabilities. The general dodge Chrysler Jeep lack of quality is to blame for a lot of problems.
"The only grounds I had was out of service. The catch is the car was not underivable so legally I am not entitled to a lemon law claim. We all want to think that lemon law covers all the things but it does not. If it is cosmetic or noise related and not a service impacting issue like check engine lite or drive related it can be a hard road if Tesla does not just accept the buy back request.  


That being said in my case I am pretty sure I could have gotten them to do a buy back given the length of issues. 


I have ironed out each and every issues up to the creaking of doors. That is new and also the only thing left from a 100% perfect model 3 performance.  I fixed the paint. They fixed the rattles. They replaced the tail lights.  The sub works. The software works.  I would not pursue them for a lemon law claim at this point. I would however presume them for a set of door jam rubber seals to the exetuve escalation desk.  It got so bad the desk of Elon was involved with my repair issues. Not Elon him self but his core customer complaints team.  I was back door introduced to them from a twitter friend. 

I am prepared to ramp up my war effort again but you see it is a drain to make something so simple right but that is how it is working with Tesla now. "
"Still have it there have been another two visits to service for actual issues with my blower motor for the ac.  


When the tycan ships I think I will be out.  The ap is great and we will keep the blue model 3 we have that has been issue free.  Mine is a lemon."
"You are completely right, my brain short circuited lmao."
"I don't disagree that Dodge Chrysler Jeep have a lot of quality issues, but a lot of the complaints about the wrangler are due to its nature of being an off-road vehicle. "
Glad you're not completely done with Tesla. Hope it all works out for you.
Well now that i see the range drop due to a firmware update with no communication i am pretty much done with them for future cars. I mean that was my limit pulling the apple on battery was soooo stupid on there part. I lost like 5 miles which i know is not much but loss with no reason makes no sense
"Some lost 30 miles or so. Looks like you got off lucky. I guess it's so the batteries are less stressed, but they should give the option to the user to power up to 100%. Nannying isn't any fun for the customer."
I agree 100%.  I got off light but there is no reason to it.  The wife’s care gained 2 miles.  To 311.  So make sense of that I can’t.  She also has more miles on her car.
Is your office parking lot open to the public?  
Theres only 1 Tesla owner *so far* 
I see several ClipperCreek (J-1772) boxes as well as Tesla. They are probably installing both. 
"Good, preparing for the future!"
So they shouldn't plan ahead? Probably way more economical in the long run to get multiple stations done at once vs. adding another every time another employee gets an electric vehicle.
"Are they Tesla charging stations, or j1772?"
"My office has 8 teslas and only 2 chargers, wanna trade?"
My office is installing zero charging stations (despite a recent building addition) and there are at least 2 Tesla owners.
"It looks like they're extending the curb/sidewalk a little bit to accommodate the wiring, as opposed to tearing up existing concrete.  If so, that's a clever way to cut costs and minimize disruption."
"Meanwhile, where I worked, people complained when I plugged my Volt in (standard 110 volt outlet that was already there) because that was a ""benefit"" I was receiving that that couldn't have.   Yes really..."
"If you build it, they will come"
Very silly to install just one. 
"CEO ""Go buy a Teslaaaa.....""

Employees ""Pay ussssss"""
Smart
"Lucky you! We have 2 generic L2 chargers in my parking facility for work with dozens upon dozens of EV’s who swap in and out of those spots coordinated via a group chat. Realistically though, only a few cars managed to get charged per day, and the plug-in hybrid owners tend to squat the spot all day like it’s VIP parking. "
Soon there will be 7 other EV drivers.  Happened where I work. They put in forty chargers....now there's over 100 ev drivers and 80 chargers. 
"In the year 2045, the loan ICE car will have to find parking elsewhere or find himself electrocuted by an EV car parking in the only designated spot for an ICE car. "
Build it and they will come...
Chain them together for 8x charging speed!
"Better than my company, 25 EVs sharing two CC chargers.  Free but I only get two hours on two days, 4 total, per week.  But unlimited after 5PM, so I go in late and leave early, then just charge at home.  Who wants to work more hours any way ;)"
We did this at my work and 4 other people bought Tesla's within 2 months.
"We have about 10 chargepoint stations at work (free to employees). I let the Bolts, Volts, Leafs, i3s, eGolfs have them first. If one is open near the end of the day I will plug-in. I figure the cars with limited range really need the juice. I have plenty of range to get home and charge overnight. 

Great your company is upporting EV!"
Sounds like the same people who calculate how many handicapped parking spots to put in a given parking lot.
My office is installing zero charging stations and we have five employees with electric cars. 
"That 1 owner must be a hell of an employee. Im pretty sure my boss wouldent even let me tape a peice of paper up in the spot where i park every day, saying its mine. And im pretty sure i cant actually park anywhere else. "
"That's awesome!

&#x200B;

My office has 4 Destination Chargers but there are 4 Teslas and 2 Leafs (The leafs use a Teslatap adapter to connect to the Destination Chargers)

&#x200B;

Luckily our lot isn't open to the public so I'm able to charge whenever I need to."
Good.
Good for you holding down a job with such reasoning skills.
"Ugh lucky. I work for the federal gov, we have 400 employees and at least 10 Tesla’s/EVs. No paycheck or charging stations in sight. "
It's protection for up to 7 ICE pickups
"My office has 5 Tesla's.  I think 24 or 32 stations, we have lots of other EVs.

We started with 8 points.
"
"The number one rule of good management is to plan for the future need, not the current needs. "
"Only 1 Tesla...... 

For now"
Currently...
Induced demand 
"Our office complex has 4, and they are all used every day. They need more. "
For now...
... For now
Gotta make room for the other people that are gonna see your Tesla and want one 
"People in flats don't buy electric cars because they have no way to charge them.  
  
Employers don't install destination chargers because so few people have EVs.   
  
Gotta break that cycle somehow. "
"Destination/Workplace charging program?  They won't install just one if you sign up for tesla to do the install.  The Clipper Creek box makes it seem like this is a Tesla install and not just your office, Tesla uses CC for J117 when they install a destination site."
Supercharger or regular chargers? Because my company has the largest private charging station in the US. Theres only 5 or 6 tesla owners but a bunch of electric car owners. 
"I’m planning to request some at my office campus. I’ve seen at least 3 Teslas in the lot where I park, plus there’s more lots and garages, so there may be quite a few Tesla owners working there."
Wish my office would install them. We have like 5 owners! 
Today...
"This may be a dumb question, but why would a company install charging stations for their employees, is there any incentive for them? Or is it purely to please employees?"
Future-proofing is always good
My work is planning to install j1772 chargers this summer and mine is the only EV so far. Can't wait. 
How many hybrids though?
"If you don’t want to buy a Tesla, but something else. That’s your office giving away free gas!"
"The only reason we don’t own a Tesla now is that neither our building nor my work are wired for it. Our building has plans to do so within the next few years.

Once that changes, we’ll buy one. I suspect we’re not that unusual."
future proof!
They won't work with other EVs?
We have 5 Tesla owners and 0 charging stations.
"If you build it, they will come!"
As of now
"My office is installing 0 Tesla or EV charging stations. There are at least 7 Teslas, 1 Leaf, 1 Focus EV, and 1 Bolt at my office."
"Well now you don't have ""Where would I charge it"" as an excuse if you were looking to buy a new car"
Good way to attract people with $$$ to your area. 
Guess who's getting new teslas! 
What's the best way for businesses to install a workplace EV charger? Companies like ChargePoint quote over $30k and that's not something most small business can afford.
Boss is getting a new tesla
We have the opposite problem... only 2 spots and like 15 EV's :/ I can never find an open spot.
That serves a multitude of positive purposes.
What triggered them to do this?
That's in case the first 7 are blocked by pickup trucks
Lucky! 
"My office garage has a few charging stations, but actually more than Tesla users use them. I see a bunch of plug-in hybrids and other EVs charging there alongside the EVs all the time."
... for now.
"My work installed 8 chargers when only 1 person had an electric car, 2 years ago.  That person was me.  Now there is over 20 cars.  "
"That's awesome, but for the rest of us, can we please get some L3 combo chargers as well?

I know Elon loves EVs in general. If he made a rule that every time he did 4 of his chargers he could throw the rest of us a bone, it would be nice."
We only installed 2 and now have 5 Tesla owners. We chose...poorly.
Welcome to norway where in a Business of 72 people we have 13 model x 15 model s and soon 5 model 3
"Get your truck bois

(Whatever the sarcasm tag is)"
My billionaire CEO owns my work complex and every other parking area has chargers except ours. The f*ckery...
It's to encourage more people to own them.
Only 1 for now.....
That means some huge bonuses are coming! 
Meanwhile my office has 4 Tesla owners and 0 chargers. 
Only one Tesla owner... today. 
I wonder if Tesla does private Supercharger installations? And if any Tesla can use private Supercharger or just ones specifically allowed by the installer?
Gotta get those rebates before the money runs out. 
I bought a Tesla because there are free charging at work.  Haven’t charged at home once.
[deleted]
Lots of times there are incentives with the electric company and the charging providers (ChargePoint for example) but you have to install a minimum number of spots
*at this time. 
I work for the major utility company in the 5 boroughs of NY and we don't even have one. 
Not a tesla owner yet but this is called progress! You have a fortuitous boss
The one tesla owner just might be a C level that oversees the operations/maintenance/facilities budget
"Don't worry, the hybrid drivers will use them for parking. "
"ITS A SIGN! 






OF FUTURE CAR SELLS"
Speaking from a facilities manager's perspective.....someone is doing a great job preparing for the future. 
"More from your office will come.  When I first got my M3, the second in both offices, its was fine.  Now there are more Tesla then any other E car here."
How can I apply to work there? 
"Jealous -- my work despite having a very vocal ""green"" campaign as a large nationwide fortune 500 company still said ""no"" when I tried to get a single charger installed.  I even offered to help design and build it.  They even said no to installing a basic/standard 120V outlet so I could bring my own charger in the back of the lot somewhere out of the way. 

This same company has no problem spending 5 figures to decorate the building every year for Christmas but didn't want to peel off 1k to setup a dedicated charging space. 

Funny enough they do install pay charging stations at some of our retail locations that literally *nobody* uses because it costs 500% more than anything reasonable. "
The future is here like it or not
For now...
My office is installing 17 charging stations and I only see about 3 Tesla’s at my office and maybe like 3 others Volt/Bolts.
"Dont be fooled. If I learned anything living in an area with free charging, there will be a plethora of prius primes, i3s, honda clarity plugins, ford focus electrics, and many more dinky eco cars coming out of the woodworks looking to hook up."
And Kentucky has like 3 chargers in the whole state.
If only the referral system wasn't being discontinued! You would've been able to refer your coworkers.
I bet that one person is the CEO! ;-)
So much room for activities!!
How many pickup truck owners?
"Beginning of the year? *Check*

Fiscal budget reset? *Check*

Someone had some money burning a hole in their pocket. "
Is it the CEO?
"Well shit, he can park sideways then."
Is the Tesla charging station connector different from other electric vehicle chargers?
Not economical.
There's a mall parking lot here that has like 15 tesla specific stations. There's like 3 teslas in the state.
8 for the price of 6?
"We want a Tesla, but no charging station. Installing a solar panel is out of the question. "
Tax break reasons
"Damn, they'll be able to charge in 1/8 the time!"
"Some companies do a thing where they trick you into buying multiple things ""because buying in bulk is cheaper"". So despite having 1 Tesla owner, it was ""cheaper"" to buy 8."
This looks like the parking lot from The Office.
Is the Tesla owner the boss? 
"Funny, I work for a fortune 10 company and there are at least 4 Tesla owners and a handful of Leaf and Volt at my building and the cheap bastards from facility told me that there aren’t plans to install chargers because they wouldn’t be used. "
Worth
Worth
"If you build it, they will come. "
"I'm getting my Model 3 next week, and luckily I can actually pull into my office's workshop area to charge on a 240v outlet. I'm hoping that parking my nice new car indoors will make everyone else jealous enough to get Teslas, and we can convince the company to install EV chargers outside!  ... I can dream?"
"Meanwhile my office denied the request from all 4 Tesla owners to add even one non Tesla branded charger. 

They said they would have chargers at our new building, but they don’t. 

Some companies are a fucking joke. They literally told me they’d have to be fair and build a gas station too. "
PG&E has a program where they will run the infrastructure for EV charger for businesses but it has to be minimum of 10. Tesla sometimes gives chargers for free and pays for the upkeep. 
...so far....
Nice!
"My office installed charging points after I asked.  I'm the only EV user so far, though the boss and one of the engineers wants an EV soon."
Well maybe they just want yo encourage using electric cars?
Getting ready for the future!
"‘If you build it, they will come’"
We have three spots with standard outlets and it’s a race every day. I live close brought that I can recover the charge from a round trip but I don’t always get a spot.
"Plot twist: y'all are getting promotions, enough to be able to afford a Tesla

The proprietary plug in the US is insane...
"Other people make electric cars, right?"
[deleted]
For now
"I'd investigate the logistics behind this. Are there some kind of incentives or tax breaks? Are you guys funded by someone and that funding is going to go away so you might as well use it? 

It's probably dumb to not use the universal J-socket chargers though so many people can charge..."
Is there a problem with that or something?
"It seems like you're trying to expose your company for being incompetent. I think this is a good thing, it will encourage people who want to get new cars to get EVs. 

More importantly, are you not scared this post might be seen by one of your colleagues and a witch hunt starts to find you? "
...the fuck? company wide we have like 30 teslas. last year they installed 6 pay to use 6kw chargers. which are always full with leafs i3s and volts...
Tax credit incentives used?
Get ready to see ice trucks blocking the spots 
Indeed it is... 
There were zero Tesla owners at mine two months ago and now there is two 
"I hope to be the first at my office. But that might be a couple years from now, so somebody else might beat me to it pretty easily."
Build it and they will come.
This is infrastructure. What makes you think that the future EV owners 10 years from now are going to be buying Teslas? Would it have been reasonable for businesses to have all built nozzles on gas stations that only fit Mercedes-Benz 260 D when that came out?
"The clipper Creek box you see might be the pedestal that they mount the Tesla EVSE to, Tesla doesn't make their own but they recommend CC ruggedized pedestals and use them in hotel & business installations. "
"I hope these are Tesla + universal chargers.. 

Otherwise, if ""the future"" is parking space being increasingly consumed by private companies' proprietary technology, I don't really want the future."
Isn't Tesla using a proprietary charging system? Hardly thinking ahead.
"Yeah except the ones in my office parking lot are tow away for any vehicle not a Tesla. And we have severely limited parking space as it is. Honestly it’s really frustrating seeing the one Tesla there and the other three spots always empty. 

For reference, there are 10 guest parking spots for customers. 2 regular electric spots. And 4 Tesla-only spots. That’s just ridiculous. "
"It is definitely good, but there will be a lack of normal parking so ICE vehicles will need to use them in the meantime. Then we get photos from Tesla fanboys moaning their are ICE vehicles in their spots which would otherwise be empty "
"Maybe the only person with the tesla is the owner or some higher up and all of the other workers live paycheck to paycheck and none of them can afford a 50k car. Not everyone has a 60k salary, as surprising as that is. "
I'd hope they're J1772 since all Tesla owners have the J1772 adapter but relatively few EV owners have a TESLA -> J1772 charger.
"Both, I see Clipper Creek and Tesla boxes."
*laughs in CCS*
"If you look at the photo, I already spot 3 black Tesla charging boxes... What a shame, should have done the J-socket."
Do they have a responsibility to?
Looks like your right... super interesting (and makes a ton of sense!)
"In Denmark it's been classified as a taxable benefit. I believe people may have found grey-zone loopholes, like the one you mentioned of a public outlet. But as the regulation is now, you're supposed to have a separate meter, deducted correctly from your paycheck and reported to the tax authorities... I can see where this started, but it's not exactly helping encourage a green transition with current (affordable) EV/PHEV vehicles with a limited EV range..."
Tell them to buy an EV. Fucking morons.
"I mean, to be fair, your employer is essentially subsidizing all of your commute costs. That's not insignificant. If they were instead giving everyone a $50 gas card every week, you'd consider that a ""benefit"", wouldn't you?

EDIT: I put ""benefit"" in quotes because I was specifically talking about an employee benefit. Like health insurance. I don't think it's a *good idea* for employers to subsidize gas expenditures for their employees. It's just an equivalent example of an employee benefit, which is what OP's colleagues were complaining about."
Government employee? 
That was basically the argument that was given to me when I asked about it at my work :(
LOL so do those people charge their phones at work?  Go cut phone charge cables in the name of equal rights :)
"And he'd whisper, ""No."""
And leaf!
Yumpin yimminy. Are these paid spots?
He's the owners sooooo... 
"Ja ja. My thoughts exactly!!!! Then, to top it off, he posts in the Tesla subreddit...."
I think we're up to ~60 charging stations and ~130 registered EV owners in the company now. The Chevy Volt is the most common (35) followed now by the Model 3 (21).
Exactly what I was thinking.  This looks like a Tesla funded install like they’ve been doing at hotels and hospitals in my area.  Destination chargers with a mix of Tesla and CC. 
We had a few super chargers delivered a few months back but I don’t know where they went and all I see them installing now are what’s in the photo. 
"As a heads up (I've helped quite a few locations get set up) for the workplace charging program, you are more likely to be approved the more chargers you are willing to install.   

Seems counter intuitive, but they are more likely to pay for a 25+ charging installation than a smaller 4 charger install.

/edit. Approved by Tesla that is, you still need to convince the company you work for to put them in in the first place."
Maybe they handle clients with Teslas?
"To encourage EV ownership, perhaps? Subsidizing your EV owning employee's commute costs is a nice benefit. Might convince several employers to go green."
That's awesome!
Wishing you luck on swift access to charging! Owning a Tesla is awesome. :)
The only charger actually up and installed in that photo is a clipper creek that works with everything.
Most likely they will. Tesla offers chargers with standard J1772 plugs with their Workplace Charging program.
You should ask your superiors to sign up for the Workplace Charging program with Tesla. They offer free chargers to qualifying locations.
Have outdoor NEMA 6-50 receptacles installed. And the. Pay someone to paint the nearest parking spots after the fact. 
"I have free chargers at my gym.  The savings from charging while working out almost covers the cost of my gym membership, and also means I rarely need to charge at home. I'm in better shape as well."
"Tesla pays for the hardware and pays for the cost of installation, so honestly it's kind of surprising they offer generic J1772 chargers at all along with the HPWC they provide.    You'd think they would only offer Tesla specific ones to promote the Tesla brand."
Owner ;)
"In the US, yea."
"> fortune 10 company

> no plans to install chargers

...

...

Gotcha ExxonMobil!"
"It's great that you have more than 3 EVs at your company!  Do any of those EVs *need* to charge at work?

Regardless, hopefully your company will recognize that the demand outstrips supply so they need even more EV charging outlets as time goes on.  :)"
"Tesla has a proprietary plug in the US because it was the best option at the time the Model S was designed and things have snowballed from there.

CCS 1.0 was brand new but was slow and had not been officially adopted by SAE or EU, there were barely any J1772 plugs around, and the Mennekes plug used in Europe is not used in the US as well as being slower to supercharge."
"Wait, which plug? J1772 or Tesla's own?"
Its the US way....
"What? Of course not. It's just a benefit for employees, allowing them to charge while at work so they don't have to pay as much for electricity at home. 

Teslas lose maybe 1-3 miles of range as they idle over the course of a workday. More on a hot day, when the battery cooling system kicks in to maintain battery health."
"Tesla gives these away for free.  https://www.tesla.com/charging-partners

They go [on this map](https://www.tesla.com/destination-charging)

They **are** using the universal J socket chargers, those are the clipper creek boxes in the photo.  The only charger that's actually installed in the photo(white oval looking one on the pedestal) is a J1772 clipper creek unit."
"It’s definitely a marketing campaign, we are a tech company trying to grow our brand awareness. But it’s not like we could encourage people to “charge here and enjoy our facilities”. 

Last rumor I heard we were “provided” all charging related pieces, our property owner is paying for the install and we get to brag that we facilitated the install. 

I don’t know who is paying for the power though. "
Tesla’s are outselling all the other Evs right now...and new “Tesla killers” will have unique chargers anyway.
"I thought I was trying to expose free always available charging stations but I guess your glass can be half empty too. 

No, there's a surprising number of gearheads here who will happily take the smell of no cat exhaust over instant torque.  "
AFAIK federal incentives have all expired. State or electric company incentives may exist.
"To be fair, they are installing them in the most shaded section of our lot which has historically been monopolized by motorcycles - I have since submitted a request for dedicated bike parking in the only shaded area left. "
This way to the pitchfork imperium!
What contractor are they using?
Do you work near me?  I work in a large commercial / retail space with a huge parking structure but zero electric vehicle parking. 
This is getting out of hand! Now there are two of them!
Well Tesla made the technology open source for superchargers but we'll see if anybody actually tries to make them universal or if everything is going to be proprietary garbage.
"You can see one CC already mounted in the background. It’s the white oval shaped thing.

Tesla usually supplies at least one J-1772 along with the Tesla Wall Connector for the destination charger program. "
"IIRC there's nothing stopping other carmakers from using Tesla superchargers, they just chose not to put it on their cars. It's not like Apple and lightning."
"Tesla would be smart to make the their fast charging ecosystem open domain, even if it's just the in-car end. Their name is nearly synonymous with EVs, making the Tesla charging stations the USB of EVs can only enhance the brand, improve the rate of EV adoption and create a sort of snowball effect with EVs, placing them at the forefront. It would also help them get into harder to reach markets."
"Yes Tesla's have a different plug than most vehicles, but Tesla made the patents available for use by anyone.
Edit: looks like they have both Tesla and more universal plugs, based on the packaging."
"It’s mostly likely that they are installing generic EV chargers. To my knowledge, private citizens/companies cannot add Superchargers to the network Tesla runs."
Wouldn’t be hard to take one charging unit off and put on another. The hard part is getting cables laid out to the parking header. 
"Yes, but the vehicles some with the adapters for the common non-Tesla connector where the vehicle is sold (like J1772 here in the US). The European version of the Model 3 also appears to be getting a [CCS Combo 2 plug built-in](https://electrek.co/2018/11/14/tesla-model-3-ccs-2-plug-europe-adapter-model-s-model-x/). And the [Supercharger network is being retrofitted/upgraded with a second connector as well](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-supercharger-dual-charge-ccs-upgrade-model-3-europe-rollout/) in those markets."
"How HVDC (Supercharging) yes, for Level 2 AC? No. Just need a simple pin adapter. "
"Once the cable is run, it's not terribly hard to replace the charger with something different. Think of it like an outlet, if your dryer had a different plug, you replace the outlet, not the whole wiring all the way to the outlet. 

only asterisk is if they have a need for larger cables in the future, but in reality, 11kwh capacity is likely good enough for years to come, for most people since efficiency of driving will remain the same. "
"Pretty sure no. My friend has a Tesla, they can use any type of charger, they have adaptors. Power is power after all"
"Too be fair, if they are paid for by tesla because these are public and will show up on the map, then they need to keep ICE cars out of them.  Install your own if you don't want obligations."

"If you look at the photo, I already spot 3 black Tesla charging boxes... What a shame, should have done the J-socket."
"Typically they provide Clipper Creek J1772 boxes for destination charging (or workplace charging) installs if the customer requests them.  

For all the locations I've helped get setup so far, it's been 1 Clipper Creek for every 3 Tesla HPWC you install.  I haven't set up a new location in about a year though so that might have changed.

/edit. Also the Clipper Creeks are 40amp units, nice ones.  Although still slower than our 80amp HPWC's next to them."
"Nope! Although they did talk about it a while. Just a matter of time until an exec gets one, then I'm sure I'll see some chargers. "
"In Minnesota, mandating outdoor parking without making chargers available would be irresponsible "
"To address your edit:

Companies make a lot of benefits available so I still don’t see how this is any different. My company offers gym benefits, child rearing benefits, educational benefits, and so on. I use some and I don’t use others- that’s true for most employees and no one gets pissed about it.

Honestly- I have to wonder what kind of shitty people work there if they begrudge something like this.

If you commute 10 miles a day (5 miles to and from work) that’s 200 miles a month which is about $5/month in benefits. That is less than my company pays per employee for coffee- something I don’t drink and therefore don’t benefit from but I don’t complain about it."
"My job gives everyone pre-tax commuter benefits so how is this any different? My NYC Metrocard is paid for with pre-tax funds and so is the card of everyone else I work with. If they wanted to use that money to pay for EV charging instead- why should I care?

We already give tax breaks to EV buyers and EVs often get to use HOV lanes or pay discounted tolls. And let’s not forget that this benefit isn’t limited to one person- it’s available to anyone that has an EV."
It’s possible they don’t pay electricity costs in the building and it’s just part of the lease.  Also it’s a poor comparison as we want to encourage electric vehicles and discourage gasoline burning.  And anyone CAN have the same benefit if they get an EV but they CHOOSE not to. 
GSA actually has a schedule for this. Been a while since I saw it but it was actually kinda well thought out and reasonable from what I recall.
yep
Free. Which probably helps explain their popularity.
He called Tesla and asked them to install free chargers.  Smart owner!  
You work at a hotel or some kind of retail place? Makes no sense to put in superchargers at like a office building. 
"Those boxes look like HPWC boxes, not supercharger equipment. "
[These are the specific chargers](https://store.clippercreek.com/level2/level2-40-to-80/hcs-50-hcs-50P-40-amp-ev-charging-station) that Tesla has provided for all the Destination Charging Program installs I've done so far.  In my case it's been one of the Clipper Creeks for every 3 HPWC installed (if requested).   I haven't done one in about a year though so they might have changed the policy or hardware.
"We wouldn't qualify. Our parking lot is not open to the public. Actually, lethal force is permitted against unauthorized persons."
[deleted]
Why just in the US?
😂that would be justifiable 
I don’t think any need to but most would like to. My round trip is only ~15 miles so I can charge every other day or so and fully cover my commute charging. I have a HPWC at home so I can recharge quickly if I need to recover from a longer trip.

"Yeah, I'm certain the decision was made because it financially made sense. 

For example, there are business loans and also rebates and incentives with certain power companies for businesses that install power chargers. 

I'm all for it, there might only be 1 Tesla owner now but this might encourage others to get EVs.

If this is in CA, remember, the entire state agreed to try and minimize/ push back pollution back to the certain levels.

Has there been a single instance of another manufacturer suggesting they’d use their own proprietary chargers for their EVs?  Every bit of news I’ve seen suggests big auto is working collaboratively to set common standards.  
"Tesla comes with adapters to use other chargers. Other cars don't have adapters to use the Tesla charger. Lets promote a greener lifestyle, don't have to be exclusive assholes. In public, we can put a universal charger that anyone can use. 

Other users have pointed out that there are J-socketed chargers being installed as well, which is nice. "
I can see what kind of employees this company hires....
/u/pitchforkemporium  
That would actually be pretty amazing
It only takes two before they start multiplying...
This is where the fun begins
"> proprietary garbage

Based on up/down-votes The echo chamber in here is deafening. All the other EVs are adopting a common standard. It's *Tesla* that is deploying a proprietary product!"
"As a guy who owns an EV but not a Tesla - yet, I appreciate that. It's frustrating to be at a place like Sheetz where there's about 10 superchargers and not a single J-1772 though. "
Don't they just provide a Destination Charger but with a J1772 plug? I don't usually see a CC branded charger from Tesla. 
Right you are! But I bet that the pedestal they're working on is a CC that's going to house a Tesla HPWC. 
"If I recall correctly, there was a pretty big caveat somewhere in the details to the effect of ""sharing technology is a two-way street"""
"Elon has said he wants other automakers to ""pay their share"" of building/maintaining the SC network before their owners can access it.  It's his way of paying lip service to ""opening the network"" without actually having to do so.

If he wanted he could make and sell a SuperCharger to CCS adapter **directly* to non-Tesla EV owners then charge them for usage.  He doesn't want that he doesn't want to hear about it if somebody in a Tesla rolls up to a full SC site and sees some plebe in a Bolt stinking up the place."
[deleted]
"True, but there are 3 Tesla high power wall connector boxes in OP’s photo."
"The convenience store chain Sheetz is adding superchargers to their stores somehow. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/lianeyvkoff/2016/06/30/why-tesla-wants-to-install-superchargers-at-sheetz-gas-stations/#1d9f8e729332"
"No one's talking about Superchargers here. We're talking about Level 2 chargers, most of which in the US are generic J1772 plugs.

Tesla offers a program called Workplace Destination charging where they provide free chargers to qualifying workplaces (the workplace pays for installation), and those chargers can be either Tesla's proprietary connector or a J1772."
"There is no official CCS adapter, not even an aftermarket one."
Probably does rolling coal too...
Ah I get it now... so Tesla drivers are the same as the handicapped. Gotcha! 
"It does. There’s a company that sells them for about $400 USD apiece. They won’t work on a super charger, but home wall connectors work fine. I’ve considered getting one to charge our Smart ForTwo on our home wall connector. "
It does exist and it works for level 2 charging but doesn't work for supercharging 
I see [these all the time](https://www.ebay.com/i/142905340114?chn=ps) being used at our destination charger install.
"Protocol is the same, just a different connector"
"If you look at the photo again, J1772 CLipper Creek boxes are there too."
"Tesla also makes HPWCs that have J-plugs rather than their priopritary connector. They only give them out for their Workplace Charging program, but that's exactly what's being set up in this photo. So I would not be surprised if at least half of the Chargers they're installing are J-plug."
"Except the executive will then use the charger as their personal parking spot. Then a higher-up executive will get an EV; then either a second one will be added, or the lower exec will get relegated out of the spot."
Time for you to offer them a test ride! 😀
"if the execs got teslas and that prompted getting chargers, wouldn't they probably also then get mad when you used them?"
Because of the implication?
"Oh, the wonder of having a 5-mile distance from work to home...

*cries in Los Angeleno*"
"Also even if they do pay for the power, it's a tax write off (power is a business expense) so after all the accounting they are barely paying much of anything to offer this."
"We’re a technology hardware sourcing company. The marketing of them would outweigh the silliness. Plus, the eccentric owner factor."
"There was a post on here a few months ago that showed a stack of I think ~10 HPWCs that we're being installed for the Workplace program, at least one of which had a J-plug instead of a Tesla one."
"Well, you'll have to ask all the other companies providing free charging hardware and also paying for the installation of the chargers why they do it.

Oh, literally no one else offers this besides Tesla."
"In Europe they use the same connector that all EV's use in Europe.  China has it's own specific connector now also.  The J1772 connector standard (the US one) wasn't finished when Tesla needed a connector for their cars, so they went proprietary instead, and have stuck with it.

It's starting to look like they might move to CCS in the US at some point, because they are going that way in Europe with the Model 3.

Dunno, there's a ton of Tesla specific chargers in the US though so migrating everything over would be tricky."
"It's just a nice perk for most people to have a charger where they work.

I don't need to plug in at the supermarket where I shop that has a charger, but it's free.  Yea I only get a few miles of range while shopping, but as I said, it's a nice perk.   

Also over the lifetime of EV driving, it does add up to some savings."
"As QuestionMark mentioned, ubiquitous charging stations are a very nice perk. But that's not all. When it comes to EVs, you have to completely rethink fueling, since you can't just go to a gas station and spend 5 minutes filling up your tank to gain, let's say, 400 miles of range before your next gas station stop.

To gain 400 miles of range in a Tesla with one of the chargers shown in this thread, it would take about **12 hours**. These are so-called Level 2 chargers, which cap out at around 30 miles of charge per hour. They're designed to be installed in your home, or in places where people can be expected to leave their cars parked for several hours (work, malls, etc.), and to make use of that idle time for charging that doesn't impact your travel times.

Now, there are also Level 3 chargers, which charge much faster. Teslas Superchargers can charge 175 miles of range in about 30 minutes under ideal conditions. They're intended for use on long road trips, during which time you can get out, stretch your legs, and maybe get a bite to eat while you wait. They're still not equivalent to the sheer speed of gas stations, but the next generation of Superchargers should be coming out this year, and they will more than double the charging speed.

The vast majority of your charging is likely to be done at home, though. When I get home in my Model 3, I plug it in to my own private charger, and the car schedules itself to start charging at night, so I can take advantage of off-peak electricity rates. By morning, it's long since fully charged, and I leave on my commute each day with a ""full tank"". I never have to take those 5+ minutes out of my day to go to the gas station any more. Ever.

And one of the best parts is that the electricity I use to charge my car costs about 60% less than what I used to pay for gas. And I owned a Prius C, which got 50 mpg. The savings compared to an equivalent luxury sedan, or even worse, a gas-guzzler SUV, would be radically higher.

Anyway, I hope this was informative! :)"
"LOL!  From the sound of it the sole Tesla owner is the company owner, he finagled a free workplace charger install and Tesla probably has state credits to offset the larger install.  Everybody wins."
"Remember also that the business can write off the cost of power as a business expense, so with good accounting the power should almost be free."
VWag is building their own.    The rest have two or three companies working together.
They can't do that! Shoot them... or something
I've not really heard of many EV's outside of Tesla and like Prius' so excuse my ignorance on this subject. 
"Tesla doesn't make an HPWC with J1772 end, those are aftermarket modded.  Tesla has been supplying Clipper Creeks with destination chargers for a couple years if you asked."
Standard fare for open licenses.  Tesla has to open source their operating system because linux has the same requirement.
"That's only a caveat if they think they can do better than Tesla, and currently it doesn't seem like the case. I get the point though, those hundred years old companies will need a few more years to start taking Tesla seriously, even though they're already way too late with that."
"Honestly, that's fair, for now at least. There isn't enough infrastructure yet to support the entire EV population. They can barely support all the Teslas, depending on where in the country you are. Hopefully they build it out and can expand to serve everyone, but that isn't the case right now, and it \*would\* suck to plunk down $100k for a premium vehicle and no longer be able to ever use the supercharger network because it's always full."
"Which part of the other automakers paying their share is unfair? Maybe they are neglecting EVs enough that they don't build their own networks, which can be a reason they don't want to join Tesla's as well, but it seems like Tesla is inherently ""paying their share"" too. If they wouldn't be playing compilance car even in 2019 it would be a no-brainer to join a network like this, the value proposition of an already established charger network would be worth the cost by itself."
"It’s a great business strategy, but not one I agree with. 

By controlling the largest network of superchargers, they have a massive advantage over other EV manufacturers. But it just ends up hurting everybody. 

I have heard that the Model 3 in Europe has a standard plug, and that the superchargers there are getting both the proprietary and standard plug, so that’s good. "
"HPWCs (these destination/workplace outdoor chargers) have a ""Tesla only"" setting that is actually just a newer J1772 authentication mode.  They used to turn that on for half of the destination chargers so only teslas would charge on them, but now several other manufacturers use the newer J1772 protocol and charge fine at all settings (with an adapter). "
"Supposedly for a L2 charge Teslas use J1772 signaling with the Tesla proprietary connector.

There are a couple of companies making Tesla to J1772 adapters but they are pricey (like $250) and only work with L2 chargers (UMC/HPWC/etc.) not with Superchargers.  I've also heard some rumors that the new HPWCs (including Destination Chargers) don't work with these adapters but that has not been confirmed."
"Yeah - saw that after I rechecked the photo. However I think there are some generic chargers in there, too. 

I’ve never used a Powerwall charger - are they much faster than typical EV chargers? Close to Supercharger in speed? Because if so, maybe having those there would encourage Tesla drivers to move their cars after they are charged."
"That sounds like Tesla is entering into a partnership with Sheetz to expand their network on Sheetz’s property.

I was saying that you can’t buy a Supercharger station and put it in your driveway."
Neat - thanks!
Really? how is my friend able to charge at his apartment that has one of those electric chargers? 
"There is an official CCS adapter - we've seen it posted here - but it isn't sold and there's no unofficial one at all.  We might see them sold eventually, the official HPWC corded 14-50 EVSEs were unofficially sold on ebay through third parties for the last year or two, but only just started being sold officially by tesla."
"Yes. Handicapped in the availability of charging locations.  

When you're alone, do you also park your pickup in the locations reserved for families with children and pregnant women?"

Battery would die in the cold.  My friend said she barely gets to work and back in winter.
Even if you quadrupled it you’d still only be spending about $20/month which is hardly something to get up in arms about.
"The J plug had to be a Clipper Creek.  Tesla doesn't make a HPWC with a standard J1772 connector. (for sale, or for free, or for the charging programs.)"
[deleted]
"Maybe they could include converters as an option, or just throw it in free of charge. I hope that since Tesla is such a big piece of the market for electrics that everyone will decide on one single connector to use. Especially between Europe and Asia. Seems silly to no be able to charge your car if you want to take a road trip."

"Please stop, I already have to change my underwear. "
I know VW is building out a network but isn’t it going to be CCS? 
[https://old.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9quho5/workplace\_charging/e8buze1/](https://old.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9quho5/workplace_charging/e8buze1/)
"I agree with you and that's is the real reason why Tesla isn't serious about opening the SC network to drivers of non-Tesla owners.

&#x200B;

Though I do think there's a relatively easy solution to this problem, make the SuperCharger to CCS adapter expensive (say $1000) and price Supercharger use for non-Tesla drivers such that they will only use it if they really don't have another choice (if it's the only way to make their trip doable).  I'm thinking a ""baseline"" cost of 2x what a Model 3 owner pays and higher costs during peak travel periods.   Not going to see many non-Teslas at the crowded SC sites on holiday weekends if it costs $3/kWh or $3/Min.

&#x200B;

Most of the time most supercharger stalls sit empty, if they set up the pricing right they could get decent revenue from other EV drivers (which helps support the SC network) without putting significantly more load on the network during peak demand."
"I have no problem if Tesla wants to keep their Supercharger network to themselves, they have made a huge investment in charging infrastructure.

But I don't agree with claiming they are ""willing to open"" the network but attach a poison pill that Tesla knows that no other automaker could possibly swallow.

Mary Barra got a lot of flak from shareholders just for approving a low-profit vehicle like the Bolt for full production (not just as a ""compliance car"" in CARB states) there's no way no how that she could ever get away with writing a 9 figure check to Tesla + $???? for every SuperCharger equipped car they sell and let Tesla have access to data on all those cars as well.

If Elon really wanted to drive EV adoption (not just Tesla adoption) he could bypass the other automakers and sell to non-Tesla EV drivers directly.  Make and sell a SuperCharger to CCS adapter, sell it at a hefty profit (say $1000) then charge non-Tesla drivers a premium to use the SC network (say twice what a Model 3 owner pays).  Heck they could even do some kind of ""surge pricing"" to create disincentive to use the SC network during peak demand periods (for example charging non-Tesla drivers 10x or more to use a SC site that's >80% occupied during a holiday weekend)."
[deleted]
"In Europe Tesla S and X use the type 2 plug that is more or less the standard for Europe now but they use it with a special DC mode that only Tesla use (so far) and I think they use it above the recommended power that you can reach according to the standard (so probably the car side is nonstandard even with the exact same plug). Usually the Type 2 plug is used in AC mode (230V AC 1 phase or 380V AC 3 phases).

Then we have the CCS, like in US, but based on the type 2 plug, so on car side it's exactly the Type 2 with 2 additional large outlets for DC current). The Model 3 (will) have this plug and so will accept DC current only with the 2 extra pin, exactly like the standard specify. Most other cars use the same plug, except the Chademo cult (I will not put the correct cases here) from Asian manufacturers, but even they are starting to change slowly to Type 2 CCS with their new models or future ones if I'm right (Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, Mitsubishi...).

So for Tesla it means that Model S and X are able to charge in DC at Superchargers and in AC at most if all public and private chargers available. And Model 3 will be able to charge in AC and DC at most (eventually all) public charger in addition to superchargers. Future Model S and X should be updated to have the Type 2 CCS too and old ones will use an optional adapter.

Additionally it's technically possible for all EV supporting Type 2 CCS DC quick charge to use Superchargers once they will be updated if Tesla allow it in the future of course."
"The tesla supercharger in Europe still uses a proprietary communication format to verify the car can handle the supercharging.  If another automakers car connects to it, it will not charge.  Some of the Tesla’s that have been rebuilt are not allowed to supercharger because of safety concerns.

That being said, for these workplace chargers, tesla has a program where they will give your business the chargers for free and cover some of the installation costs as long as the business pays for the electricity.  They also will give some clippercreek chargers so that other cars can charge there."
"I think Tesla's [perceived] advantage in having the current supercharger network is balanced by the massive amount of capital that the bigger automakers have at their disposal. Volkswagen alone are throwing like $2 billion dollars at charging infrastructure just in the US in the next few years; that is like half of Tesla's total R&D spending for their *entire lifespan*. The ball can get rolling really quickly.

But yeah I totally agree that the chargers should be universal. Comparable to the way phones & laptops are shifting to USB-C (even Apple in the next couple years); proprietary is just not the way to go in the long-term."
"A (telsa) hardwired home charger is typically 30 or 40 amp 240. the charge rate is about 9KW. the supercharger will charge at a rate up to about 114KW. shupercharger is a highvoltage DC charger bypassing the onboard rectifier, the home charger is AC.

It would be normal to install j1772 connectors as well as / in addition to a tesla destination charger. the leaf / bolt and all plugin hybrids can use that one (as can the tesla with an adapter that comes with the car)."
"Yup, a few clipper creek chargers too.

Powerwall (the home battery) is a different product than the high power wall connector (HPWC). HPWC tops out at 19kW; a super charger can charge at 120kW. So it’s faster than the UMC that comes with the car (for S and X with dual charger option), but much slower than super charging.

Edit: to fully answer your question, it depends on the car, the charger, and what service capacity of the circuit the charger is on, but usually the HPWC will be in the same ballpark as a good public EV charger."
"The current Tesla S/X/3 lineup can all charge using Tesla HPWC's at a rate up to 11.5KW on a 60 amp 240v circuit.    There are some older Model S's that supported dual chargers and could see a higher charge rate (up to 19.2 KW I believe), but I don't believe those were very common.  an 11.5KW charge rate gives 44 miles/hr charge rate on a Model 3 and 34/30 on a Model S and X respectively.  This is an order of magnitude lower   
 charge speed than a Supercharger but it doesn't require anything more than 240v 60amp circuits, which is easy and common enough for both business and home charging applications.  HPWC can also be daisy changed with up to 4 units sharing a single 100amp circuit.  They automatically can load share so that a single car can charge at the full 48 amp rate, or 4 cars can charge at a combined 80amp rate."
"The powerwall charger CAN be faster. Tesla engineered it to run up to 60amp ( I could swear some of the old Models S P100D went to 80 amp) while most others only go up to 40 amp.

[https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation/wall-connector](https://www.tesla.com/support/home-charging-installation/wall-connector)"
"It's a good idea, but the Sheetz (at Haymarket VA) that I saw these at had signs saying charging was limited to just 10 minutes. WTF?  No one was paying any attention. I saw a lot of drivers just sitting in their cars far more than 10 minutes, just chilling while getting some miles. (I was walking my dog at the time)"
"The apartment is likely using standard J1772 (AC), not CCS (DC).

[Here’s](https://thedriven.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ac-dc-charging.jpg) a pretty good image that shows the physical differences. Look under the America column and you’ll see J1772 vs CCS."
Family parking spots exist? wtf? Never heard of that. 
"Oh OK, i think i have an even better understanding now... Tesla drivers are as capable as a handicapped pregnant woman with children. "
hmm...  that does not look at all like the one I was remembering... but it has a nicer price point. The 32A 20' one I'd need is $299 USD. 
Even the cheapest J1772 connectors on AliExpress are still like $150. If these could be made cheaply they would be. 
"And then get hit with a million $ product liability suit when the wire overheats and burns a building down. 

Liability concerns are why things like that are so expensive."
I've never been quite *that* excited about Tesla...
"There was a pretty decent amount of discussion about this surprising discovery that Tesla made J-plug HPWCs. I don't think several dozens commenters were all mistaken, but maybe OP was being misleading with his photos? I wish I had any idea which post it was..."
"Outside the USA most everyone including Tesla uses the same charging connector so it's not a problem where you live probably.  Tesla HPWC in Europe will charge any EV even if it's not Tesla.  Same for China, etc etc.

Since Tesla is the largest EV seller in the US, it's not really a problem here either.  And there are adaptors to charge a Tesla from almost anything here, and there's even adaptors to charge non-Tesla's from Tesla chargers.


Just not superchargers, those are Tesla only everywhere. (for the moment)"
"Huh, I hadn't heard that Colorado was doing state-subsidized EV infrastructure. That's something I'd love to read about, if you could point me in the right direction. As far as I know, California has made/executed no such infrastructure plans, and EVs are quite ubiquitous here. So they can certainly stand on their own without taxpayer help.

I totally get why one might be opposed to such a plan, though I personally think it's a great idea. It's pretty clear that EVs are the future. Maybe not in 5 years, but definitely in 10, EVs will really start taking over from ICE cars. Colorado being prepared for that will bring tax dollars to the state, as more people buy EVs and *pay sales tax on them* :). Not to mention whatever tax the state most puts on electricity, the usage of which will go up astronomically once EVs are ubiquitous. And that's not even taking the climate change issue into account.

As for ""EV owners expect others to pay for their energy at point of sale"", free charging is fairly uncommon. The only places I've heard of that offer completely free charging are places like certain malls, hotels, and a small number of workplaces like OP's. They use that free charging as an incentive to draw EV owners to shop at their mall or stay in their hotel, rather than a competitor's (or as an employee benefit). The added convenience of being able to charge overnight at your hotel is *huge* in many circumstances, so it's a big draw to EV owners, who are (currently) likely to be fairly affluent, and willing to pay for costlier rooms. And being able to gain back all (or more) of the charge you used to go to the mall while you're shopping is also a big incentive.

However, not all hotel chargers or mall chargers are free. In fact, I've charged at a number of malls, and none of them were free, as the majority of public Level 2 chargers are actually for-pay. The biggest network of these in the US is called ChargePoint, and you'll often find anywhere between 2 to 10 ChargePoint chargers at various places where people tend to park, like metro stations, grocery stores, and malls. The ChargePoints near me generally charge about $1.50/hr (or $0.25/kWh) and charge at around 6kw, which equates to around 25 miles of charge per hour. I haven't used them much since I got my home charging setup installed, but they were quite useful to me before that."
"Wow that's awesome, thanks for the correction!"
"Good point. It would not make much sense to keep the superchargers to themselves. Economically, it might make sense (if they were only a car company) but I believe Tesla truly wants to help the world. I cannot imagine them locking down charging stations just to hurt competition. 

I still think that the standardized plug (like what they are doing in Europe) is a better idea. "
"Who would wire a High Power Wall Connector for only 30-40A? There's no reason at all to go less than 50A, and it supports up to *80*.

30-40A makes sense for people plugging a Mobile Connector into a dryer outlet, but not a dedicated charger."
"While those lower charge rates are typically true for users using the UMC for charging, I don't know of anyone who has not opted for a 60amp circuit for a HPWC, unless they did not have the capacity to add the a 60 amp circuit to their service panel.  "
"1) Thank you for the comprehensive answer.

2) It’s still kind of trippy to me that in short order, being a car hobbyist is changing from being a study of mechanics to being proficient in electrical work. "

But I've tinkered in the past with some ideas that I've looked into doing small manufacturing runs on when I've come up with what I thought were sellable ideas and I'd expect after all the setup fees and moulding fees and such you are probably looking at $100-$150 per unit landed in batches of a couple hundred. 

I have no idea the sales volume for something like this but I suspect they aren't in the thousands or tens of thousands to get the price down to more reasonable levels. So $249 is a reasonable price given the likely limited volume selling and the effort, investment and risk involved in my mind. "

Elon isn't limiting it to only on Tesla, he wanted to share it to other EV companies, but others didn't want to play along with it, I assume it's because its a branding aspect. Taking your Honda/Toyota car to like a Tesla Supercharger, makes Honda/Toyota look weak? Not sure what the actual reasoning is. "
"> 30-40A makes sense for people plugging a Mobile Connector into a dryer outlet, but not a dedicated charger.

However for a continuous draw you have to limit it to ~80% of the circuit max. So on a 50A circuit you're looking at 40A maximum continuous draw (like for charging a vehicle). The HPWC can support up to 100A circuits but you're still limited to 80A on the output for charging because of the 80W requirement.

The Gen 2 Mobile Connector that current Tesla vehicles come with though is limited to 40A, so 32A real world max (80% of 40A). So a NEMA 14-50 connection actually provides more power than the current Mobile Connector supports. IIRC this was because of a Canadian charging change or something like that, so all of the North American markets were moved over to supporting 40A circuits max instead of 50A on the mobile chargers."
That’s cool! I’ve never heard of them being labeled that way! 
Cool! Didn’t know that was a thing! 
"I'm not saying he's trolling... but if he is, he's doing a hilariously bad job at it."
"Hmm, politics of EV? There might be a dedicated sub for that, but I haven't heard of one. I just found /r/electricvehicles via google, but I haven't looked at it. Might be worth a shot.

As for your objections to EV subsidies, I think you might be surprised by how much government subsidies go into basically everything. Even extremely mature industries like oil/gas, farming, transportation of goods, etc. get huge sums of money from the government every year. EVs really aren't any different in that regard, but at least they're better for the environment than the alternative. So I'm all for it."
"Its not the branding aspect. Its because of IP. Part of the agreement of using the supercharger network, and tesla patents by extension, means they have to allow tesla to use their patents indefinitely as well."
"Why would you wire up a 50A circuit for an HPWC, though? Wouldn't it make the most sense to wire the circuit for at least 60A, so you can charge at 48A?

I ask because I made a foolish decision when I had my electrician install the wire for my charger. I originally didn't think I'd be getting an HPWC, and had him just install a NEMA 14-50. I now regret that, because when I had him switch the socket for an HPWC, the wire was too small to support upping the circuit to 60A. So I'm stuck with 40A charging, instead of 48."
[deleted]
"Yeah, there's no reason you'd *want* to use a circuit less than 60A for a HPWC... but I'm sure it happens all the time. The panel may not be able to accommodate an additional 60A circuit for instance, and upgrading the panel might be cost prohibitive. Or like in your case with wiring limitations."
Always happy to chat about stuff have a passion for. :)
"From original thread since many keep asking “why sand:”

“The tires dig into the sand and automatically causing the left side of the vehicle to sag which converts some of the sliding motion into rotational motion. It's easier to roll on sand than asphalt or concrete.”"

"While it's fantastic that it is designed with a low centre of mass, I doubt that on a hard level surface (tarmac), the vehicle would be able to fully right itself as this shows."
I am so happy to be able to drive my family safely around this car every single day. I find every little excuse to go for a ride.
How does it stop all the momentum of the car roll? 
"Can Tesla get their model x, model 3 and new roadster concept in Forza? Please."
Why is this being reposted recently?
"Look, I'm a huge Tesla fan, and think the model X is awesome.

However, let's not kid ourselves. That was a roll over, no question. The cg was past vertical. The only reason it rolled back was due to the shape of the sand hole that it made, or some other unseen force acting there.  On a hard surface, that roll almost certainly would have continued."
In sand. I want to see that same roll on pavement compared to similar models on sand and pavement.
Dat moment of inertia 
Need that for PUBG 
😮 
"It looks just like one of those blow-up, toy, punching bags I had when I was a kid.  One punch would send it sideways, but it would pop right back up due to all the weight being in the base."
"Marketing secured.

Wait what!!? I didn't know it could do that
Weeble Transformer...
Can someone explain to me why it's so much better to have it roll back like that when it's practice upside down? I mean at that point the car is already totalled. 
TLDW: it has a huge ass battery to lower the center of gravity 
You can clearly see a cable being pulled tight before the roll stops. 
"Uh, it's not rolling because it's being pulled by a cable. "
Perfectly balanced.
"Honestly if it had non gullwing doors and didnt look so bad in my opinion, I would be down to buy a model x."
"Wish I had that on January 27, 2007"
So cool to know. Thanks for the correction. 
What sorcery is this?
"So Base X or P3D? Married, no kids...wish I could have both. "
"Not meaning to downplay the stability or resistance to rolling over, but the only reason the car righted itself is because of the sand surface which allowed the wheels to move below the surface on the ""return roll"". If this was a hard surface, it would have stayed on it's side - which isn't an issue although for some reason some are aggressively defending it, as if the car was designed to self-right itself and would do this no matter what the surface is."
That makes sense. So Tesla’s have a very low center of gravity because the battery is even distributed at the floor of the car? I’ve never had a sandwich like that but I can deff picture what you’re saying. Thanks for the explanation! 
Is nobody else noticing what looks like an arresting wire of sorts attached to the bottom frame of the model X? It pulls taught right at the moment that the rollover should occur and then falls slack. 
Wouldn’t it roll on any other surface than sand? 
Why would you drive such an expensive vehicle near sand? if you're anywhere near the slightest amount of said you should expect your vehicle to roll over. I'm just pissed about my post from driving through a puddle and having the bottom of my model 3 torn off and having everyone told me I'm an idiot for driving my car near water. I deleted the post rather than deal with this subreddit's bullshit
The sand helped... if it was straight pavement it would of flipped
"It’s like that doll that have all the weight at the bottom which made it impossible for it to roll upside down, don’t remember what it is called though. "
What about the cable that’s holding it against rolling over. ?
What if it was on cement and not sand so it couldn't roll back down into the holes that the wheels dug out? Hmmmm?
there’s... a rope that... is preventing it from rolling? Attached near the back right wheel? 
"If it gets hit by a semi, It’ll roll over numerous times."
It's on sand though
"In sand. The ground here is particularly great at dispersing energy. What happens on stiffer ground?
"
"I want to see this test done without the car being tethered to something.  If you look close enough, it looks like there is some pull with one of the tethers when the car rolls."
"Asphalt or concrete? Yes. However you take a typical median or side of the road which is dirt it’s fairly easy for a car to dig in, especially if heavy and sliding and then roll. Sand in this case is ideal because it builds a wedge for it to rest and then right itself. I’d take hitting sand over catching some earth. "
"i want this car but I drive a 2001 pontiac grand am and think 14 dollars is too much for a pair of jeans

Wait for the Y it's going the smaller version but still an SUV.
$90k?! It’s well over $90k :-(
Tesla gave me a 24-hour test drive of a P100D = $140K brand new.

You can get a mattress in the back and literally live in the car like an rv. Rent out your home to cover the mortgage.

"Same here, I'm not even confident that the Y will do it has I need a large minivan for the family. I had to order a new ICE and already in ICE it was hard to find a vehicle that fit our need. 10 more days of pollution and shitty performance then I hope more options will be on the market."
"I thought about a lease option, then realized it was the same as a 5 year loan.... nah."
I want this car but drive a 2011 Subaru Forester and can’t afford a Tesla

"I'd like to see it hitting a little curb with concrete on the other side, while going sideways."
"The tests is for slide-and-trip crashes. 

You’re going along, swerve to miss a deer and start sliding. Your rear wheel leaves the shoulder, hits soft dirt and your vehicle trips and rolls.

"It literally is the safest SUV.

Not probably. Definitely
"2nd behind S, and in front of Model 3 at the 3rd."
It wouldn’t even roll over on tarmac. Hence why they use sand so they can test it
"On a hard surface, would there be as much pull to even get it to start to roll? If you don’t let those left wheels dig in to something, it’s just gonna slide, no?"
"The idea isn't that the vehicle will right itself, it's that it doesn't ent up on its roof. The point is it's safer because it won't ent up with the occupants under the car. "
"I'm not sure what the surface has to do with that.

The sand is used to intentionally try and stop it very quickly in order to induce roll and measure exactly this; the angle of roll at which it will still right itself."
"This exactly. I’m not trying to say that it’s not safe and that that is not impressive, but the tittle is a bit misleading. You can see this was done in sand or loose dirt and how the car pushes almost a sand ridge that it ends up sitting on for a second then rolling back over. On a flat hard surface the results may be different maybe not."
"For real, this car isnt magic. It's not somehow magically immune to rolling over."
"Give it to those crazy arabs that slide their Camrys and Patrols down the highway, they’d give it a red-hot go. "
[deleted]
I saw it on another subreddit and thought it should be here 
"No it would not have, its center of volume was past verticle but its center of mass was not, if it was it would have kept flipping. On a hard surface it wouldn't have even started flipping, it would have dragged out, that's why they test rollovers in sand in the first place. the sand keeps the car from skidding, forcing it to either flip or dig in."
Don’t you need that sand (or something super-frictions) to really arrest the travel of the left wheels so that the car even begins to roll over in the first place?
The vehicle did not enter unstable equilibrium (“CG past vertical” as you say). Otherwise it would not roll back. 
"Incorrect, the undercarriage of the car with the battery is incredibly heavy, much heavier than the roof area. Ever punch one of those balloon toys that is weighted at the bottom and rights itself? Same concept.  Watch the video again, if the hole was the factor in righting itself the momentum of the roll would've carried it further,  as the X was actually past the tire hole when it started rolling back upright. When the momentum stopped the weight of the battery pulled the car back onto its wheels.

Edit: Responding to your other statement, it was definitely a rollover, but from the occupants perspective, at the end of the crash they'd be able to exit the vehicle and wouldn't be trapped under the car or upside down. "
"On pavement it would just slide. A different SUV would roll.    
The sand is there to make the car roll..."
"Uh, the resting company goes to all the trouble to create this entire facility, set up cameras, etc. just so they can NOT roll a car over because of a tiny cable. Seems unlikely"
[deleted]

On a straight pavement you can’t do the test. That’s why they throw the car harder to achieve a comparible situation. Still no car in the world can do this because of the low centered gravity point of the heavy batteries in the floor. Only the Tesla’s havr this safety in Roll over.
Weebles wobble but they don’t fall over.
You think that tiny electrical or data cable is preventing the 6500+ pound vehicle from rolling over?
That cable has more than enough slack to allow it to roll over. The effects are minimal.
Shhhh. You aren’t supposed to see that. 
"Left wire is not connected, right one never straightened out so not even real tension there"
Well the sand got pushed to the side in a mound and it was able to roll back over it
Neat.
"As opposed to getting turned inside-out, like almost every other car in a similar situation."
Cool bro
Well done
So do you really think rubber on asphalt is more prone to make the car flip than rubber on sand?
"Stiffer ground wouldn’t have the car rolling, but sliding"
"It probably just slides, like most SUVs on flat blacktop"
https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ai0x80/the_way_a_tesla_model_x_wont_roll/eekth2o/
It's probably just a data cable
"""close enough"" lol, it's a data cable to gather information from the car during the crash. It has literally no effect on the roll, detaches before the car starts rolling back upright and is even taped or labeled, if they were hoping to hide this they would probably have done a better job before posting it on instagram. They aren't tethers, that would make zero sense during a roll over test because it would defeat the purpose of it. "
I laughed. I also think 14 is a lot for pants
I'm with ya man...  I mean I drive a Chevy volt so I might be better off... But I had to cancel.my model 3 res... It was still too Much.  I'm concerned that I won't even be able to afford a model Y
You're the reason sweatshops exist. 
SUV in air quotes. . . like a RAV4
And for the low price of 65k!!!!!
crossover
I think crossover/XUV is the right name for it
"Irrelevant thought I just had when seeing the name Y: Tesla’s nomenclature is quite interesting. I remember Elon joking about the Model 3 being called E, so they would have the S, E and X. Obviously they didn’t go for it but now their lineup is S, 3, X and Y. 

Quite sexy..."
SUV Crossover
So the $35k Y model will in reality be a 65k base price.
How? The X is already a small SUV. 
"Just priced one out; base Model X 100D black interior/black exterior in 5-seat configuration and no Autopilot comes to $97k before the $3,750 tax credit."
That’s before options
You can buy a brand new 75D for less than $90k 
Depends. You can get it for up to $10k less or up to $40k more.

"According to Tesla's marketing department.  As the NHTSA has [said over](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1086424_ntsa-rebukes-tesla-over-non-existent-5-4-star-safety-rating) and [over again](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration-issues-statement-about-new-car):

>A 5-star rating is the highest safety rating a vehicle can achieve. NHTSA does not distinguish safety performance beyond that rating, thus there is no ""safest"" vehicle among those vehicles achieving 5-star ratings.

Tesla just takes snippets of data out of context to misrepresent the NHTSA's results."
It's more like a minivan though.
">  I haven't been able to find any primary sources from the NHTSA 

That's because the NHTSA doesn't actually say that.  They say something [very different](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration-issues-statement-about-new-car):

>A 5-star rating is the highest safety rating a vehicle can achieve. NHTSA does not distinguish safety performance beyond that rating, thus there is no ""safest"" vehicle among those vehicles achieving 5-star ratings.

This ""safest car ever"" thing comes from Tesla's marketing department, not the NHTSA."
"Tesla *claims* they have the safest cars ever.  The NHTSA has [repeatedly](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1086424_ntsa-rebukes-tesla-over-non-existent-5-4-star-safety-rating) opposed that claim, even [explicitly stating](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration-issues-statement-about-new-car) that there is no ""safest car"" from their tests.  It's all Tesla marketing.

As far as the ""breaking equipment"" thing, another dose of top notch marketing from Tesla.  There's a [variety of cars](https://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/mercedes-benz/e-class-4-door-sedan/2019) that have significantly higher roof crush ratings, and they didn't break the testing machines.  It's a case of a faulty machine, not a car so outstanding that it broke the machine."
"This isn't correct if you factor in vehicle mass, as Elon has said himself."
"Aren't the S, 3, and X all ranked like the 3 safest cars in general?"
"It's funny how many people here are complaining about the test being wrong or not testing things the right way.

The NHTSA designed this test. It's one of 3 tests done to cars to crash test them. I promise you they have given this more thought and experimentation than you ever have, and they have found that this test accurately tests cars."
It would if it hit something like the curb
Falcon doors only work rightside up.
"The real threat of a roll over isn't just that the car rolls it's that passengers can be flung around/out of the car during that time. Most modern cars have tons of safety features that keep passengers safe, these features only work if the passengers stay in the car. By making the center of mass so low it not only prevents flips but consecutive flips which is where passenger flinging happens. it doesnt ""really"" matter if it rights itself afterwards, that's just a bonus."
"Yeah, on a hard surface it would much more likely stay righted from the beginning. It would just slide, never flipping. It might take a curb or something to get it rolled up, but even then I bet the wheels break off first. "
"They didn't specifically just do this test only, this is just one of the tests they HAD to do in order to get its safety ratings. This particular video was posted to Tesla's instagram and other SM pages so that's probably why it's shared. I don't know specifically how it rolled on other surfaces but it's not like they went out and did specifically only a sand test then packed it up and slammed the gram"

"CG was way past vertical. Battery is not the cg. CG is above the battery. Battery was way way past vertical, so then, was the actual CG.
Yes, sand helps initiate the flip. No argument there."
"Simply acts as whatever obstacle causes a roll. Granted the X is not going to be easy to roll in the first place, so something is going to be necessary to trip it; could be a pot hole, curb, etc."
"Based on your edit, I don't know what you disagree with.
Either way, a heavy undercarriage does not make it immune to flipping, and will not magically roll the car back, after the CoG is past the roll axis center.
The sand built up allowed the car to rock back a little after stopping. At that point, the car gained rotational momentum in the opposite direction and the wheels were in a lower spot in the sand divot, so it just kept rolling back."
ELI5: does it not roll because of the weight or a gyroscope? This went so off topic. 
"There are two cables, there’s one that goes completely taught, and appears to pull it back. "
"I'm just saying, the cable appears to tighten. "

not according to the iihs...
Areas that have a curb usually have lower speed limits meaning rollovers in those areas are much less common.  Plus you can't realistically engineer a car that will never roll over under any circumstance. 
They have explosive bolts in the hinges so they can open if its upside down
" Not quite. Gull wing doors (like on the delorean) only work right side up. But falcon wing doors have two pivots, which mean they could still open upside down. "
Would you feel better if I deleted the post?
"If batteries are by far the heaviest part of the vehicle, then the CoM won't be much higher than them.

Don't get me wrong, an X can be rolled, but it'll take *much* more than it takes to roll a car with a combustion engine, which is pretty high."
"You are arguing that the CG was past the rollover point and some unseen force pushed the car back?

Alternatively, if the sand trap allowed the car to dig in and create a small hill to help it roll back instead of over, so what? All cars have the same advantage? Any time you leave the pavement and hit the soft shoulder, a similar dig into ground occurs. 

Finally, if the sand is unrealistic, then consider that on pavement, the Model X would never have initiated a roll in the first place. I don’t think it is fair to evaluate the sand trap based on the physics of a pavement encounter. "
"I don’t think it’s much of a trick to show that any car can be rolled over if one rams it sideways against a fixed and indestructible object like a curb. Assuming the wheels don’t deform/break and the CG is higher than the object, it seems kind of inevitable to see that (or something weird) because physics.

The trick here seems to be that given an intense *but not absolute* resistance to those left wheels, what does the car do? We know a Jeep subject to that kind of sideways slide, for example, would probably have tumbled out of frame. Other cars would have likely been on their roofs at least. And here, because of how heavy the bottom is, the Tesla manages to recover. "
"Just like a rocket with wings on top and its Center of Lift being above the Center of Mass will flip instantly (unless accounted for by gimbal), so will a car as bottom-heavy as the X correct itself even after full inversion - unless it is absolutely stable in that position, like a pencil balanced on a hand."
"Well you're right, it won't magically roll back over, but it will roll back over because of science. The car had rotational momentum into the flip, and the weight of the ~1500 lb battery outweighed the inertia and pulled it back. The sand hole was not under the car at the peak of the roll, nor was it under the car during the frames where it started rolling back. "
"Others have said it's just a data cable.  That's certainly plausible, especially when you track the other group of cables."
"Low CG makes it much harder to flip.  High CG is the reason SUVs flip so often, the X is a crossover with its CG lower than almost all cars and it's incredibly heavy so it has 6000 pounds of momentum way down low at wheel axle height trying to halt a flip.  They needed the sand just to get it to rotate."
We can tell who didn’t pay attention in school
"~~I agree.  A lot of force was redirected by that cable and even the potential springiness of it could have assisted in getting the car to move in the opposite direction.~~

I disagree."

"Oh yeah, absolutely, but what does a test against a curb really prove?

The NHTSA rated it five stars.  Tesla went ahead and declared it the safest SUV on the road.  Big difference.
"Literally nobody has died in an XC90.

The same cannot be said for the Model X. "
Tesla is more than able to submit a car for IIHS testing for top safety pick. That means it’ll get the small overlap test.

Yes
"But even that logic is flawed.  How do you define ""safest""?  The majority of SUVs miss on the NHTSA's rollover test, but the only thing that test covers is tip resistance.  Does lower tip resistance make a bigger difference than something like a small overlap test?  And beyond that, you have some SUVs that have never had a real-world fatality, whereas the Model X has.  If you can make up your own criteria for ""safest"", the term loses its meaning.

Tesla's point changes depending on whatever makes them look the best.

That's on your ""page"", that doesn't mean it's not a snippet that's taken out of context and twisted to mean something you didn't say."
Isn’t that from the Tesla page?
"I did forget to specify that they were the top three in *probability of injury* didn't I?

And it's true that the NHTSA disputes that probability of injury score alone is enough to say that something is the safest car in the world because they only do certain tests and things, but it probably *is* the best metric available (beyond the star ratings, I guess - which max out at 5 and so don't really offer a way to differentiate cars that get that highest score.)"
"Yes, people taking snippets of data out of context and misrepresenting it bothers me.  Because it's incredibly easy to misrepresent data and twist it to seem like it says things it doesn't actually say.

>Probability of injury doesn’t matter I guess?

It might, it might not.  It's impossible to say without a lot more information.  But the NHTSA's stance on that is that it doesn't matter, so there's that.

They literally came out in response to Tesla and said they don't distinguish safety performance beyond the star rating.  Just because they have internal metrics to place vehicles in star categories doesn't mean those metrics are usable as an overall ranking system.

And frankly, if Tesla's vehicles truly *were* the safest cars ever, they'd sweep IIHS tests with ease.  That hasn't been the case so far."

"The force is not unseen. It’s a cable anchored just below the back right wheel well. It goes taught just before the vehicle rolls, stopping it mid rotation."
I can definitely understand that other grouping to be data cables. I've just never seen anything stop itself *and* reverse it's path of travel like that. Maybe it is the weight of the battery but it just seems so abrupt.

You're both wrong. This is standard data gathering equipment for crash testing. A Cat6 and a 7 gauge hot wire aren't nearly enough to affect the test. 
">Oh yeah, absolutely, but what does a test against a curb really prove?

Let me further clarify. There is more to the earth than pavement, sand and something made of concrete.

"When you are part of the 1% how much money do you make each year? $1 billion or $10 billion?

Both Elon Musk and Bill Gates are part of the 1% but obviously one makes more money than the other.

NHTSA's star rating means that if the car scores better than some arbitrary number it gets a 5 star rating but that obviously doesn't mean that each and every car with 5 stars got the exact same score.

NHTSA shares these scores with the manufacturers and as it turns out Tesla got the best score which means that Tesla is free to claim that according to NHTSA's tests they got the best score, ie they have the safest car."
"Probably true but on its own that doesn't mean much.

An XC90, compared to a Model X, is slow af and driven way more conservatively by way more cautious drivers.

Without hard data (demographics, driving style, accident types, etc) claiming one is safer than the other because one has fewer/no deaths is just bad science.

Also, XC90 isn't the only car with zero deaths."

So how do you reconcile that with IIHS and Euro NCAP results?  Tesla repeatedly touted the Model S as the safest car ever, but it couldn't earn a Top Safety Pick or Top Safety Pick+ from the IIHS, and scored below other competitors in Euro NCAP tests."
"Why?

If it’s the only SUV to get 5 on all tests Tesla isn’t really being dishonest. The government just doesn’t want to exclude the possibility of a non tested SUV getting pissed.
"Come on my dude, you're being intentionally misleading without *technically* lying.  That's ""anti-Tesla rhetoric.""

It's pretty clear that the NHTSA is only disputing Tesla's claims to be diplomatic to other car manufacturers.  They have a gentleman's agreement that the NHTSA will not call *any* car ""the safest car"". They only give star ratings, and there is no *official* and *public* ranking of cars within each category.

NHTSA's own data (which they shared with Tesla on the condition it not be shared with the public) shows Teslas have the lowest probability of injury.  And they never disputed the data when Tesla shared it with the world, only the inference that Teslas were the safest (which is really the only conclusion you can draw from the data).

I’m fairly certain the cable is arresting the vehicle. It stops dead in the midst of its rotation.

"Your uncle most likely used BMW's European Delivery Program which offers a discount on the car as a tourism program. I've done this twice. The vehicle is ordered from a US dealer.

The car is then imported as a new car. 

It's highly doubtful your uncle bought a Euro-spec car and then imported it. First off, Euro-spec cars aren't legal to drive on US roads without (expensive on a BMW) modifications. Second, importing a car that's less than 25 years old and isn't for sale in the US (which Euro-spec BMW's aren't) is illegal under most circumstances."

Tesla calculated the ""probability of injury"" metric [themselves.](https://jalopnik.com/how-tesla-made-the-model-3-so-safe-1829610576)  That is not an NHTSA metric.

I think it's entirely possible that they didn't correctly anticipate the length of data cable that they would need for that particular sensor.

"The regulations are different. Europe allows things that aren't allowed in the US and vice-versa. Small example that shows how this would be expensive: US regulations require reflectors on the sides of cars, while Europe doesn't. So BMW uses bumpers that include a spot for the reflectors in US cars, but Euro spec cars don't have that. So you'd have buy new front and rear bumpers and have them painted to match your car and then installed. That's assuming you managed to actually import the car in the first place."

It's exactly like that.  You get a broad grade based on a set of tests.  Those tests are weighted in a certain manner to come up with a final score that puts you in one of those broad groups.  That specific score does not rank you by your intelligence, and you wouldn't say that someone who got a 97 overall is more intelligent than someone who got a 95 overall, because those tests don't have nearly enough depth to establish a firm ranking of people by intelligence.

They are not providing anyone with more information.  All of this information is publicly available.  They are just taking data out of context and misrepresenting it.

And nobody needs to ""share"" their numbers.  They're all publicly available.  These numbers just don't mean what Tesla keeps trying to say they mean.  Which is why the NHTSA has repeatedly come out against Tesla and only Tesla, because they are the only ones who insist on trying to spin themselves as making the safest cars ever.

Tesla isn't bringing transparency, they're muddying the waters with cherry-picked data that's not representative of what they're claiming.  If they truly made the safest cars ever, they wouldn't be scoring lower than competitors in IIHS and Euro NCAP tests."

"I am just saying to say "" buy it believing the 45mpg stats and discovering they’re really more like 12mpg."" (then edited to 19) is disingenuous. Obviously, everyone drives differently and in different conditions. But the fuelly average of >31 over 7 million + miles disproves your 19 assertions. Even the normal RAV4 averages higher.

Looking at car and drivers review ([https://www.caranddriver.com/toyota/rav4](https://www.caranddriver.com/toyota/rav4))

"" The hybrid model, however, is especially economical, boasting a 34-mpg city rating that seems conservative considering an SE hybrid delivered 36 mpg in our testing. """
There have been many changes in the S over the past 5 years. They’ve never reviewed the X though which is my point. 
"So, if one car gets 5 stars and another 4 stars can I compare them or not? Is one safer than the other?"
"Then we agree, Tesla got the best scores overall and they named that ""lowest probability of injury"" because the existing tests showed that Tesla got the best score.

If NHTSA changes the tests or better cars get tested then Tesla will either keep or lose the title of the ""car with the best score""."
"I disagree on muddying the waters. I didn’t know there was a “probability of injury” number before Tesla started talking about it. 

All else being equal (5 stars all around), why wouldn’t I want a vehicle with the lower probability of injury? 

Seems relevant enough that it should be right next to the stars on the label.

"Using their algorithms to bucket ratings into stars is how they normalize to allow cars to be compared to each other. Their raw data is not gathered in a fashion to make it comparable, that is why they don't publically release it next to the star rating.

This is not a difficult concept to understand."
"There isn't an overall probability of injury number.  That's a figure Tesla came up with.

There are various probabilities of injury for each individual test, which are calculated from the various force and deflection measurements based on estimates from prior testing and crash data.  Those probabilities of injury are then weighted based on other estimates to come up with a relative risk score for the test, which is used to assign the star rating for that test.  That relative risk score is then weighted again based on other estimates to come up with the combined vehicle safety score, which is used to assign the overall star rating.  Tesla then took that vehicle safety score and multiplied it by an NHTSA baseline figure to come up with their own ""overall probability of injury"" metric.  That is not an NHTSA metric, that's something Tesla themselves calculated.

> All else being equal (5 stars all around), why wouldn’t I want a vehicle with the lower probability of injury?

And this is *exactly* why Tesla is muddying the water.  Because now you think the NHTSA has an accurate probability of injury number that should just be on the label.

This is why the NHTSA keeps coming out against Tesla, because they're misleading people."
">  Also, did you seriously claim a stat from a website somehow “disproves” my real-world driving experience? 

I trust Car And Driver, a magazine dedicated to car news and comparing cars between each other consisting of professionals who do this for a living more than a random redditor on a Telsa forum. So yes.

&#x200B;

I showed sources claiming the average is higher then what you are saying, as well as the city fuel economy. So unless you actually think a random redditor has more credit than my sources, I think it has more weight then what you are saying. You never even said 19mpg city, only 19mpg overall, plus the combined EPA rating for the Rav4 Hybrid is not 45mpg like you say. 

Not looking good for you my man.

&#x200B;"
"So, can the cars be compared to each other or not? it's a simple question."
"Full circle - there are numbers (relative risk score) that NHTSA has that they then bucket into stars. 

I see nothing wrong in comparing those. 

I agree that multiplying by baseline is kinda stupid but regardless that has no effect on ranking order for the Saale of this discussion sine the 15% baseline is the same for all vehicles. 

So yeah, Tesla still has the lowest relative risk scores. 

Makes perfect sense to compare relative risk scores - i’m not suggesting that it’s a direct measure of injury risk. Tesla’s method vs just comparing the risk score would result in the same rankings. "

"For the most part no.

Cars are judged in a vacuum based on how safe they are hitting predetermined stationary objects. In the real world, there are many more variables that affect safety in a collision. That is why they take all of their numbers and turn it into a star system, to make it as comparable as possible, although still not perfect.

Most importantly the raw data can not be used to draw a conclusion as it is not gathered in a way to make that possible. Hence the responses via twitter shutting Elon up."
"That fact that you think that your personal, anecdotal, 100% unverifiable story hold even a candle to multiple car journalists and reviews posting numbers nearly x2 yours is mind-blowing. Here is another [https://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4-hybrid/](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4-hybrid/).

""  In a follow up [full test](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/rav4-hybrid/2016/2016-toyota-rav4-hybrid-first-test-review/), the RAV4 beat out every SUV we’ve ever tested in the Real MPG ratings, with 34.3 MPG in town and 39.0 on the highway. “It’s good,” we concluded. “Really good. Once again, Toyota proves that it deserves the cachet it gets in the hybrid segment by taking a successful vehicle and not messing it up with hybrid parts.” ""

&#x200B;

How about this, ""My Tesla model 3 LR gets 50 miles to a charge, it sucks, only an idiot would buy it"". Wouldn't linking me multiple journal reviews of that not being the case disprove my stupid comment? Either you don't own a hybrid Rav4, yours is defective, or you somehow found a way to drive half as efficiently as everyone else.

Regardless real world numbers for the Rav4 hybrids are really really good. The fact that you think people should trust your anecdotal stories so much is pure arrogance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;"
"> The raw data can not be used to draw a conclusion as it is not gathered in a way to make that possible.

This is where we disagree. And the existence of all kinds of safety ratings, comparisons, stars, etc proves that comparing the safety of cars is very common in the industry because that's what buyers care about.

You can disagree all you want with Tesla's conclusions but you can't prove them wrong by saying NHTSA assigns only 1 to 5 stars.

If you think Tesla is wrong analyse the data and show there are other, safer, cars out there."

"The core concept behind NHTSA safety ratings is that they CANNOT be compared against each other, there is no debate to this. Is a 5 star rated subcompact the same real-world safety as a 5 star rated 5000lb truck/suv? Obviously not. The car is safer in some situations, and the truck others there is no way to objectively normalize this data without generalizing heavily.

&#x200B;

>And the existence of all kinds of safety ratings, comparisons, stars, etc proves that comparing the safety of cars is very common in the industry because that's what buyers care about.

They, as well as you,  have a fundamental misunderstanding about the ratings.

&#x200B;

>If you think Tesla is wrong analyse the data and show there are other, safer, cars out there.

That's not how making false claims works. It's not my responsibility to run tests to disprove Tesla, especially when they don't understand what the data from these tests even mean. Although I doubt Elon is stupid, he knew exactly what he was doing and that he would be told to stop saying that. But just like with fake news, it's harder to retract something then to initially get it out there, so he still wins.

&#x200B;"
">	You can disagree all you want with Tesla's conclusions but you can't prove them wrong by saying NHTSA assigns only 1 to 5 stars.

Tesla took the NHTSA’s data on the 3 and concluded it was the safest car ever tested. Then Musk himself said it was actually X>S>3, thus proving that the analysis is flawed."
"You realize why those picture change nothing right? When I autocross I get about 10mpg, but by no means does that mean my cars Mpg is 10 normally. 

If your actually averaging those numbers you either need to change your driving style, or get your car looked at because something is not functioning. There is no reason you should be getting close to half the mpg as nearly everyone online is getting real world. 

Even when I drive dumb in the city in the middle of winter I hit 23+ easily, and I don’t even have a hybrid. I am guessing some part of your hybrid drivetrain is not working properly. Maybe due to temperature or something?"
"So, if you can't compare a 4-star car to a 5-star car then why do the stars exist?

Obviously the answer is they exist so the public can compare different cars.

It doesn't matter if people understand the ratings or not. The ratings exist so people can compare different cars before buying.

Tesla claimed something and you say they are wrong. Unless you prove them wrong it's your word against theirs and for obvious reasons Tesla's word automatically wins. Saying Tesla is wrong without any evidence is exactly what you claim Tesla is doing.

I don't disagree that comparing the raw data isn't as simple as checking if 5 > 6 but claiming you can't compare results from standardized tests is equally absurd."
Can you link that quote?
">It doesn't matter if people understand the ratings or not. The ratings exist so people can compare different cars before buying.

No, it exists to see where safety probabilities exist within cars of the **same class** for **specific collisions**. Ex 10% or less, 10-20%, 30-40% etc. Its a good data point to use to generalize the safety of a vehicle, but is not specific enough to say X is safer than Y, when they both have 5-star ratings. It does not even generalize overall safety, only specific tests and the overall for those tests.

&#x200B;

>I don't disagree that comparing the raw data isn't as simple as checking if 5 > 6 but claiming you can't compare results from standardized tests is equally absurd.

There is a difference between saying standardized test X shows that car Z is 2% less likely to be injured in a side collision then car Y. And car Z is the safest car in the world because 3 tests showed it as being slightly safer. Especially when the governing body says you cant use the numbers that way.

&#x200B;

>Tesla claimed something and you say they are wrong. Unless you prove them wrong it's your word against theirs and for obvious reasons Tesla's word automatically wins. Saying Tesla is wrong without any evidence is exactly what you claim Tesla is doing.

What? Are you dense? Here is the actual story. Tesla says we have the safest car in the world, and shows the in detailed statistics of the tests. They respond by saying, no that's not how we do things, we only test to clump things within star brackets. You cant use that data that way.

Somehow Tesla wins there? All I see is someone trying to apply data the wrong way and getting called out for it. That data is meaningless for what he said, and thus he needs to prove his claims.

"If you can use the results to assign 4 stars instead of 5 stars you can also use them to assign 5.x stars or 5.y stars.

The more tests you have the easier it gets.

NHTSA says you can't do that because they are protecting their marketing scheme. If they wanted they could have designed the system to have 100 stars instead of 5. Plus, next decade, or so, the 5 stars won't mean the same thing as the safety standards will have changed.

The data Tesla used can be found online and their methodology is also public so everyone's free to confirm the results.

Lastly, don't you find it funny that the argument here is about the stars (ie semantics)? One could simply take the data and the methodology and show Tesla is wrong instead of arguing that you can't use the data that way.

PS: Isn't it funny that Tesla takes the 3 top spots using a stupidly simple methodology?"

"Are you sure you can read English?

Musk literally said that it's 3>S>X unless you take vehicle weight into account which makes it X>S>3."
"You obviously have no idea how scientific research or studies are done based on your opening statement. You can only give ratings based on the accurate precision of your instruments. 

Consider understanding what your talking about before you make crazy uneducated and borderline conspiratorial claims. 

I am not going to argue with someone who knows nothing of the scientific method, research methods, and just wants to back a lying company. What are you Tesla PR?"
"OK Schrodinger, which is the safest car to be in? There can be only one."
"Star ratings don't exist in the real world, it's a made-up concept to group a bunch of results together.

NHTSA chose to go from 1 to 5 stars and choosing to go from 1 to 100 stars would have been equally arbitrary.

If you can't understand that please get away from science asap.

As for the ""accurate precision of your instruments"", have you ever used any of those instruments? Lack of precision is certainly not an issue."
Get the 3.
"Accuracy of testing methodologies are equally important. Go to college kid. 

Inches are a made up concept that doesn’t exist in the real world. Same with meters. Yet science uses them or a derivative of them for measurement for everything. 

You are literally uneducated in the subject. I have been in the engineering industry working with physics and various science PhDs for over 10 years. "
"The X is safer. Real world accidents take weight into account. The point I was trying to get across to you is that Tesla's analysis of the NHTSA is insufficient to crown the 3 the safest car ever tested. Musk says so himself. 

And if the X is safer when you factor in size and weight (as you should), you should be able to see how non-Teslas of different size and weight than the 3 could be safer, despite what Tesla concluded with the data."
"We have been doing crash tests for decades.The instruments have been around for far longer.  The methodologies are being refined every step of the way.

The science is really well understood at this point.

I find it funny that you are calling me uneducated when you are the one comparing meters to a pure marketing scheme. For science's sake, please go back to college because it's obvious you didn't earn your degree."
"I don't disagree that depending on the data used the result can change but it's not so random either.

You can check Tesla's blog post for the methodology and links to the data."
"Your making claims out of your league kid. 

You can’t just talk like your in the industry and expect me to respect your opinion. Your going to look back on this and be embarrassed. "
You were the one comparing the SI to marketing bullshit like a star rating system so I am pretty sure I won't be the embarrassed one here.

I cannot wait to see what they come up with for a pickup. I really hope it’s something good. 
I thought the Model Y was gonna be the pick up truck. Is the Model Y a crossover or something?
Technically aren’t all goals for 2020 considered “production” and should be red?
Why are all the 2020 dots green when the key shows production as red? 
"If semi production begins in 2020, when does full production start?  ^^^/s"
I just hope the truck will be a barebones fleet style and not a stupid luxury truck. They have such a good chance to replace all of the old Ranger and S10 fleet trucks that many companies use. 
2020: Deliver Rich's car
Semi and roadster production before Model Y production? Why? 
"I really hope they manage it, but I can't see the China factory producing in 2019. It's just earth in the process of being flattened at the moment, even though the Chinese tend to work 24 hours/day to get things done it still seems a stretch."
I wonder if the pickup can tow and what the rating will be. I am def keeping an eye on this. Super excited!
"dang, i was hoping a model y release in 2020.

now i want a quarterly roadmap. i’m never satisfied. "
"So much effort, so much innovation, so much energy required behind each of those bullet points. It’s unreal how fast they are moving. "
"Where did you get this?

edit: nm, I see Elon RT'd it"
So the Model Y and pickup are different?
Shouldn't the 2020 stuff have red circles.
"Damn, ""ultra-fast"" charger? They're at risk of running out of names, how much faster can you go on the Vocabulary scale 😂"
"I’m curious how the new higher speed chargers will work with existing cars. Will we see any benefits? Or are we going to max out at current rates? If locked in to current rates, I wonder if hardware upgrades will be offered or even possible. "
"I really want

* Compatible (Sub 25k $) Tesla

Missing a big one on here: HW3 and all subsequent updates to autopilot.
"I know this is a stretch, but I would love to see a Tesla RV. The next generation of digital nomads and retirees would be very grateful."
According to Electrek it's pronounced Un-veel-ing.
Each one a significant step in electrifying transport.  This is why the world needs Tesla.  Wishing them luck on all these endeavours.
I noticed they omitted the most important piece of information: whene the Pickup truck goes into production.
Has there been any new on leasing a model 3? I’m itching for that. Elon said something would be announced at the end of 2018/first quarter 2019
2020 is going to be crazy for production!
"Would love to see a roadmap for autopilot and self driving.

Like isn't smart summon supposed to be available by now"
"For everyone who doesn't know about the Easter egg, here are a list of the models:

S, 3, X, Y

Elon couldn't do the model 'E' because Ford has a patent or something on that name. Yes it's on purpose, and he has talked about it"
"Making a pickup would have a huge impact politically/economically towards the climate change debate.  
So many people in my state that are more on the Maga side drive pickups, give'em a pickup that's 20x better and needs no gas and they'll start to believe and vote with their dollars.  
"
Can't wait to see the pickup. I want solar roofs to take off. Solar panels are so ugly
Good good good. Now shift the dates to the left twice. 
"I’m hoping there’s also a major refresh of the S this year. My lease is up in March 2020 and I like the large size of the S, but the 3 is so close in features and performance I can’t see spending the extra money just for a bigger car. If there’s a significant upgrade with new features that differentiate the S from the 3 that’d make a big difference.

I’ve heard rumors of an interior refresh but it’d have to be very special unless there’s something more."
Any news on the next version of the Model S? Like a larger battery or minor restyle?
So by the end of 2020 the range will be S3XY Pickup...
"Model S
Model 3
Model X
Model Y
"
"They forgot the most important one. 

- Competent service centers and customer service"
They're forgetting about a new air conditioner unit that Elon hinted during the Joe Rogan podcast
"If the next Tesla is model Y, the cars will spell out S3XY"
What is the Tesla pickup truck going to be called? Does it have a Model letter designation?
"Honestly I’m more excited about the semi then anything else, I don’t think I’ll ever even buy a truck but that will be such a unique vehicle"
"""China plant begins production.""  


Not a chance in hell they build that fucker in under a year and have it running."
"I don't see ""Begin Affordable Model 3 Production"" anywhere. Did I miss something?"
"my body is having waves of goosebumps all over somebody help

Please"
So glad to see they are making the base Model 3 a priority and not skipping over updates about it. /s
Pickup truck?!
wtf is a model y supposed to be? sorry im out of the loop
It'll be interesting to see where they build the roadster and semi. Any guesses or insight? 
Why are the 2020 production bullets in the launch color rather than the production color?
Can someone explain to me why the drawing of the pickup during the semi event looked so massive? Who would buy a truck large enough to carry another car in the bed? 
I want a Tesla :( 
"Typical the cost to develop a car can range from $700 million to $6 billion.  For example GM spent $2 billion on the Volt powertrain and battery setup.  

For Tesla to unveil so many cars at once with its budget, I find it amazing they are able to even build so many prototypes.

"
"So what about the Pickup Truck's production, when does that begin?"
Where's the production of the short range Model 3?
"Must be fun to actually get one of these things. My dad made a deposit on the $35K Model 3 that's been delayed a gazillion times now. I don't knock Elon at all. Just wish they'd actually make the cars they said they would. Also, that pickup truck looks insane. "
"Tesla also uses and disposes of people like no other.   They hire contractors telling them it’s going to be for 6 months to hire, gets rid of them before the quarter ends and repeats the cycle.    Cool cars, company culture is trash.   "
Source?
"I can't wait to see the Tesla pickup be unveiled I just hope it is an actual model not just pictures etc.

Please don't be delayed, unless you have to of course."
"I love Tesla, and trust Mr. Musk, but...

WTF? After putting thd model 3 into production caused all those issues for Tesla Motors, they want to put 3 new vehicles into production in one year?!?

Maybe they assume only 1 will actually be ready for production?

I trust their plan, and it's not my money."
So glad they finally announced the new chargers. I was a part of the prototype team for those and it's gonna be amazing to see something I helped create be all over the place. 
So no model S refresh or upgrade? 
THATS HOT
"Wait ... I thought Model Y and Pick Up truck were the same :o

I thought Pick Up truck was the second name of Model Y ..."
May I know what is Semi ?
You missed Supercharger v3
"Just one question, if my horse gets sick, can I fit her in the back of the Model Y?

When we brought her home as a foal, she had a massive eye infection and had to go to the ophthalmologist a few times to make sure she would regain most of her vision and not lose the eye. Being new mini horse owners, we didn't have a trailer. So we covered the cargo area of our Forester with a tarp and plopped the poor girl in there.She eventually became quite fond of car rides. 

At a hundred pounds now, we don't go for rides often. I'm getting older and lifting a hundred pounds of curious horse into a Subaru is counter-indicated. But I'm sure she'd love a ride in a Tesla.

Plus, empirical evidence suggest that a mini-horse riding in the back of a Forester is the Cutest Thing Ever (tm). This is according to the other drivers who nearly rammed us trying to get cell phone pictures. I'd wager a mini in a Tesla will be even cuter. Plus, I'm curious how well the Tesla's collision avoidance will do under these circumstances."
"Lol, no SR model 3.... fml"
"I think we'll see most of this in the timeline outlined (Except the 2020 outline, that will probably be early 2021), Musk is very much a square peg round hole kinda guy.  "
Semi delay confirmed? 
"So in typical Musk fashion, we should add 5 years to these estimates. "
"Model Y isn't the truck? 

How about Model Y is an estate car. Gotta be better than a huge volume shape car like a SUV anyway "
"This post is ridiculously misleading. The title ""Tesla's New Product Roadmap"" implies this was created or approved in some way by Tesla; the fact that Musk retweeted a bunch of charts from some article and one of them happened to be this one does not automatically mean ""THIS IS THE OFFICIAL TESLA ROADMAP AND EVERYTHING HERE IS CONFIRMED PLANNED"" the way everyone seems to be interpreting it."
Tesla needs that model Y due to the crossover craze. I’m very happy their all-electric lineup is being expanded. And the roadster 2.0 is coming out just in time to demolish anything Porsche/Audi have been concocting.
Wasn't the pickup truck unveiled at the same time as the semi and the roadster?
Were P3D spoilers in 2019 or was that pushed back to 2020...
Imagine how the ICE-blocking pickup-truckers feel after trying this pickup truck.
"I hope there’s some kind of EV trucker equivalent to rolling coal so those snowflakes get even more worked up about there being even more American made EVs on the road. (Seriously, I don’t understand their problem with Tesla...). "

"Yeaaah I think it’s going to happen but I’m also tempering my expectations, I guarantee he doesn’t have the time to read the entire article. "
I want this so bad. 
I was planning on getting a new Ford Ranger Wildtrak this year. But depending on the announcement I might get a cheaper second hand one and pre order a Tesla. Colour me excited!!
"I don’t know if this confirms it, one could argue he was just retweeting everything Tom put out even if it was 95% accurate. "
"Dec 31, 2019 here we come!"
This was from Tom Randall at Bloomberg. I don’t remember him saying it will be unveiled this year. 
but not the next year production 🙄
"I dont care about the pickup, I want the Model Y!"
Would you look at that!
Absolute pump
"Uh, wasn't this a retweet of a post saying Elon is typically 50% behind on his timelines?

So Elon confirms plan to unveil pickup truck this year, but it might be next year."
"I thought model Y was the pickup??

Edit answered in this thread"
"No, it is not confirmed by Elon. Some of the graphs from this article have been retweeted by Elon, but not this particular graphic."
"Also Model 3 Standard Range, right?"
"Yeah, with that new chip, innit?"
"Does anyone know what the Y will be? Sedan, SUV. etc? From context clues it looks like the pickup truck is not the Model Y and they're different "
"I'm guessing it will be obvious when the two are officially announced.  I know that having owned pickups for 16 years, I'm never going to be able to adapt to having ""just"" an SUV again.  I'm wearing myself out hooking my trailer up to my LX470 just to do basic stuff I did all the time with the GMC I traded in on our Model 3.

TL;DR- I can't wait to see that Tesla pickup!"
For me it is easy. If the pickup fits in a garage then pickup else Y. 
"Given the expected capabilities and their first pickup, I expect price will make that decision for you. \[Unless towing is a critical feature for you\]"
"Same problem here.

Decided I would go for both (pending cost, etc)"
Leasing
"Thank you!
Glad to see exponential increase in sales and production."
"It was not retweeted by Elon that's deceptive, some of the graphs from this article have been retweeted by Elon, but not this particular graphic. So there is zero confirmation here, most of the product line does seem plausible, but its just a guesstimate by the writer at best!"
Lol those market caps... The moment Toyota make a large volume EV it's gonna stomp on Tesla.
"Very good time to buy stock rn.

Bought a few last week when it dipped subbed 300. 

Actually I always buy a few shares everytime stock dips due to FUD."
"Knowing Tesla kind of doubtful about those 2020 goals, but the China plant is a very important step, especially if the motherfucker doesn't step down from the trade war."
Supercharger version 3. 200 - 350 kW charge rate. Was supposed to come early last year but keeps getting pushed back. Unknown what cars can actually handle the elevated rate and for how long.
I'm guessing that these will reduce the model 3 LR 0-25% SOC charge times by 30-35% (180kW avg) and the 0-50% SoC by around 25% (160kW avg). That will definitely make a difference for road trips.
"What would this be, facelifts?"
Target is March or April.
nowhere to be seen in the roadmap
"I'm with you.  I traded in my 2007 GMC Sierra for our Model 3 because we also have a 2005 LX470 that is much more reliable.  However, I am never going to be able to adapt to even a large SUV after owning pickups for more than 16 years straight.  Way too easy to put stuff in the bed without worrying about spills or smells or how everything in the passenger compartment becomes a projectile in an accident."
"I hope there are many more like you in US and world at large!

So great to hear from real outdoorsmen, and not just coal-roller style ""outdoorsmen"" who actually want to pollute the very think thing the profess to love."
"Elon, “Shit.”"
"I hear they also plan to open more stores once the start shipping RHD vehicles to Oz!

Especially in Adelaide, since only Melb/Syd/Bris have stores. I would only wonder where will they have their store in this city :O"
"That was always his plan I believe. Model E was owned by another company (ford?) so he went for 3 
"
"Semi - Pickup - Roadster 2...

They should name the truck Model R so it can be S3XYR

It comes from that article. The colors are a little more clear (and coordinate correctly) in the article."
Because everyone loves random color 
A gRaPhIc DeSiGnEr DuH
I was looking for that too. 
Hey whoever devs this bot add CVT for continuously variable transmission per the top comment thread 
Model Y is to Model X what Model 3 is to Model S
The Model Y is a small SUV/CUV built on the Model 3 platform.   
"I noticed that too, lol"
That would also be great for conversions. 
"Both the Semi & Roadster have already been unveiled, the Y hasn't. So it makes sense that production would be ahead as well. 

As far as why those 2 came out ahead of the Y, I'd venture to guess it has to do with trying to getting Model 3 production to peak efficiency before starting the Y since they have a lot of similarities. "
I don't think the list order denotes time.
Maybe because they have a lot smaller demand. But I'm not sure. 
"The Semi opens up the major markets to Tesla that it has no presence in now, and can demand a premium price for it initially (and that will be harder once there are other established competitors).  It needs to establish itself as relevant in this market before competitors can to set itself as the semi/mid/light duty EV truck to have.  \[Plus the Semi and heavy duty truck platforms can be re-purposed into so many vehicles\]

&#x200B;

The Model Y is just expanding existing markets, and they will be satisfying many customers with the 35K model for quite a while, and probably putting energy into optimizing that product - which will ultimately benefit Model Y because it's purportedly built on the same platform (or an upgraded version of it)

&#x200B;

Roadster is a boutique product that will be small numbers and use small teams to manufacture, but will have incredible profit margins and be incredibly valuable for keeping Tesla's brand fresh and standing out as more competitors come to the market.  Plus I imagine the performance research that goes into the Roadster and performance models trickle down nicely into all their regular products.

&#x200B;

\[Edit: I'd be interested to know if Roadster production also helps develop/improve efficient prototyping/custom product manufacturing processes.\]

&#x200B;

But it's not like the Model Y isn't being worked on as well, it's just not as far along the development queue as the Semi and Roadster, which were unveiled quite a while ago."
"I don't think that'll be the order. Semi, Y, then Roadster would be my guess. They have to do Semi first because they have a bunch of major businesses counting on them and if they are majorly delayed for the semi release then it makes Tesla look like shit. Also other companies will be able to fill the gap (Nikola/Daimler). Y will be next and will be Tesla's cash cow, and I honestly don't see the Roadsters happening for a long time to ensure they can get the range they promise and to push off the millions of free cars they're giving to all the YouTubers. "
"Well, if that's how it works out, I assume they are a lot simpler to set up manufacturing lines for.  Their volume will be much, much lower than the Y."

\[edit: I'm aware how meaningless that number is, fwiw\]"
"Of course it can tow, it’ll shatter current best-in-class capacities. The instant torque generated by (hopefully) 4 independent electric motors will be unparalleled. "
It says 2020 Release.

RemindME! 1 year “AliB3’s comment on Tesla China.”
How familiar are you with China?
"I don't think they would announce that early, as it would kill current S sales.

At least, that's what I'm hoping. The S is sorely in need of a replacement."
Didn't someone mention something about an interior refresh/upgrade coming in the next year or two?
The Model Y is a small SUV/CUV probably similar in size to a Model 3.     
The Tesla semi truck. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Semi
Thats because this roadmap only goes to 2020. 
"Whatever delay there is, you can guarantee he will be way ahead of competition as always."
Model Y was never the Truck. Y is a Crossover Vehicle.
"Probably the same, if they're blocking electric charging spots it's because of the electric part, not because it's not a truck."
"They won't be. I imagine they'll be more like my irrational friend, who refuses to even try a Tesla (or any electric car) because reasons. He'd rather stick to his CVT Altima because clearly that's so much better(?!)"
"Probably angrier because of the backfire effect
"
the pickup-trucker reaction videos on youtube will be amazing
"I have a truck. Depending on the size of this Tesla truck, I would totally look at getting one, assuming I had the money. I don't go far when towing things so I'm not really concerned about the range. Same for my dad. He's got a bigger truck than me, because he tows bigger trailers and loads. I think he'd be open to a Tesla."
"I'm anticipating more that insecure rednecks will intentionally damage, block, and generally make life miserable for Tesla pickup owners."
Like they can't afford it because it costs double what an F150 does?
"I bet some buy the electric truck and then they start blocking petrol stations  


Even though it'll be the same type of person doing the blocking there will be reports of ICE VS EV"
"Why give so much credit to (less than) 10 jerks who should have been towed?

You can buy a wheel locking boot and a tow strap yourself if you want to. Move their car into a street, lock it, and laugh."
Imagine how pissed Tesla pickups are going to be when they can’t charge at a ICE-pickup-blocked charger.
"Did this happen a lot?   It seems like it was an isolated incident, but TBH I really don't know."
"Depends. If the truck is ugly, I won't consider it. That being said,i hope it isn't"
I hope Tesla does the biggest fucking pickup in USA so all the ford bros feel like they have even smaller penises 
Maybe Tesla coil in the truck bed that shoots lightning bolts when you accelerate?
"They dont care that it's american, they care that it's electric.  They see em all like a prius.  And they assume the drivers are all prudes.  Coal is a big part of their identity."
Just challenge them to a tug of war and drag their ass through the field 
"Yeah, it's called 0-60 in 4.5 seconds."
It's been suggested to try [Rollin' Color] (https://jalopnik.com/upset-about-rolling-coal-stop-whining-and-fight-back-w-1601766411)
He tweeted he might have a prototype ready this year but this retweet reinforces this and might mean he will actually unveil it this year. Hopefully at the Model Y event..
I hope (and expect) he is a bit careful when retweeting a new Tesla roadmap that is suggested by the media.
You and me both. I've wanted an electic powered Jeep Wrangler for the longest time. Looks like Elon's pulling my business first.
Yes you should really wait a bit  to see if Tesla has a cool alternative for you.
"Maybe, but he gave other hints about the pickup as well before.
He wouldn’t just retweet a Tesla Roadmap made up by the media that is incorrect on such an important topic.

Ofcourse you never really know with Elon...
"
Musk retweeted the sheet so endorsed the contents of it.
"Yes correct, but I’m optimistic that the pickup unveling will be this year. His timelines are mostly off with ramping up production. "
"You are wrong. He did retweet this sheet as well.

"A tall hatchback, otherwise known as a CUV. It's the most popular vehicle segment right now."
[The Model Y is probably going to be to the Model 3 what the Mazda CX 5 is to the Mazda 6 sedan.](https://st.motortrend.ca/uploads/sites/5/2018/05/Mazda-comparo.jpg)
"The Y will be a crossover and yes it's different than the Semi, Roadster, and Pickup truck."
From what i've seen youtubers ( don't have official info) the Model Y would be a SUV vehicle. They describe it as the Model 3 of SUVs.
Think Subaru Crosstrek
it's a small SUV
Are you interested even if it is futuristic blade runner/cyberpunk style as Elon referenced?
This exact graphic was retweeted by Elon. I’m not sure where you’re not seeing it
He did retweet the tweet which contained this graph. Not sure how to link to the retweet directly but you can see it a few posts down [on this page](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/with_replies).
"Latest news says they are still investing in hydrogen so... yeah, probably not."
I’m honestly more hopeful and optimistic. They’ll have two factories producing cars. They have the giant battery gigafactory. They certainly learned a lot from making the Model 3.
"Based on the existing rate curves you can see on the ABRP blog, only the 100 is likely to get any substantial benefit.

https://forum.abetterrouteplanner.com/blogs/entry/6-tesla-battery-charging-data-from-801-cars

The Model 3 and the old 70 and 85 batteries might get a little bump in rate at lower SOC.
"
It’s probably going to be for the newer models and mainly for the semi trucks for a bit 
"Pardon my ignorance but at what point do these crazy chargers start requiring infrastructure upgrades?

Like if you want to install 10 of these at a major truck stop, what's the scope of the upgrades we're looking at? New panel at the gas station and that's it? New power lines to some network node? New power plants?

New York City uses 11,000MWh per day (458MW over 24 hours). That's only a little over a thousand of these crazy chargers. Am I wrong in thinking there might be more major infrastructure upgrades required if these things are ever to become widespread? You could easily be doubling entire towns' power consumption if they install a few of these and become a popular stop for electric semis. "
Do you have a source for that data?
"I read something yesterday that states current supercharging stations can output 165kW, but are limited to 120kW.  Would this be a restriction due to the supercharger or the battery?  Or is it arbitrary?"
"A mere 350 kW ... what are you referring to, a children's toy?"
I'm fairly sure it was leaked there would be an interior refresh around summer this year
"Interior refresh to be similar to model 3. They would still keep their dash screens, just more of the iPad look like model 3.

Of course this is pure speculation."
"Is there an official update on that, or is that the 8 months from now from 4 months ago?"
"So we know the months, just not the year"
Where are you getting that from? The website still says at least 4 months.
"Hey unsecured cargo in a pickup becomes a projectile too, just for the other people on the road and not you 🤣"
"The “coal rolling” group you speak about is an almost made up and severely over inflated boogie man. Most likely couple high school kids trying to find their identity or jocks that peaked in high school. There’s far less then you think out there. In all my years of hunting, fishing, hiking, shooting, I’ve never actually seen them anywhere around those areas. They’re just a loud and very small minority. "
"There's a ton of us. First, it has to be made an option. Second, it has to be affordable. "
There are quite a few super cheap (for Tesla) commercial locations in the City ready to go. Couldn't some soon enough!

"The Roadster 3.0 upgrade for the original Roadster came with an [R80 badge.](https://imgur.com/Kc3LNHl)

So there's already an ""R"" in the Tesla lineup."
They’re still wrong in the article. The “production” color doesn’t coordinate to 2020... 
"k, CVT inserted."
Thanks!
"I'd imagine roadster before model Y. It is a luxury car, great for margins and you dont have to build as many so dont need as much infrastructure. Mass market cars are a lot less profitable until volume can really keep up, and the model 3 will keep getting more production before Y really takes off in my opinion."
谢谢 !
USA is too slow at everything
"That number must be a theoretical maximum of what it could move, because that's an order of magnitude higher than what you're allowed to do with a standard class C license. "
it says production will begin. that doesn’t mean i can buy a model y in 2020. 
"Or similarly [something like this](http://www.volkner-mobil.com/vmperformance/) based on the semi and capable of carrying around a 2020 roadster, potentially even designed to link up their battery packs."
I meant the traditional solar panels are ugly. The Tesla roof is beautiful
Not very. Hey I could be wrong.
I think we've been hearing of a refresh every 6 months but nothing has happened. Was blamed on the model 3 production hell and all that for a while. I think they are past that stage now? 
"I think I'm confused because almost nobody has Pick Up in Europe, at least I've never seen one. Some have SUVs but that's it"
What about the 4 to 6 months in the configuration page? 
My bad I thought I had read before that Y was a truck... Guess I'm maybe thinking about the early rumours lol 
"It’ll get better. It just takes time

A lot of people don’t really understand the appeal of Tesla until they drive it and realize what capabilities the electric platform have.

Guarantee none of those guys ever sat in a Tesla let alone drove one."
Hope the Tesla pickup blows Ice trucks away in every category like how the roadster blows away super fast cars 
"“No thanks, I’ll take the worst of all possible worlds.”"
"The biggest reason I hear repeatedly: ""I need the sound of the engine."" To which I acknowledge that there's certainly a fun or emotional response. But then I explain I've found it even more fun to have that sudden acceleration *without* engine sound. It's like an amusement park ride, a movie spaceship, or a video game. Just roll down the windows and hear/feel the wind and the wheels spinning against the road with just a hint of a high-pitched motor whine.  


Deep down, they know they're a dying breed which will soon be relegated to collectors and hobbyists. I suspect horse breeders went through something similar a century ago."
"I would suspect that after a few of those towing matches (where trucks are hooked up to each other via tow straps), the Tesla will gain some respect because of its massive initial torque, dual-motor AWD and fast traction control leading to wins.

Maybe that's wishful thinking, but I'd love to see a Y pulling a coal roller backwards as the diesel driver futilely gets taken for a ride.."
Ask him why he doesn't use a wood burning furnace at home.
"> He'd rather stick to his CVT Altima

I can think of a a few *diseases* that make me feel better than a CVT Altima..."
"I am really excited about Tesla cars but lets not kid ourselves, the current model 3 offerings are 2x the price of a similarly equipped vehicle. The Altima bas more space. Once you get over the badging on the 3, its not more luxurious than a 3 series, C class. "
Also angrier because it’d have a sturdy enough hitch to beat them in a tug of war too. 
I hope they filmed Tesla Semi Company/Driver reactions when they toured around NA
Can’t this be done now?  How about a P100D Model X vs a Ford F-350 or something?
That's what dashcams are for
I kinda doubt it. There's teasing among pickup owners but I doubt it'd get that bad. People tease me for having a Japanese pickup. I tease them for having an unreliable pickup. 
"My dad brother and I drive F150s. We are all looking into the electric pickups. The Atlas pickup looks amazing but worry about charging for a long trip. Which is why we are waiting to see what Tesla comes up with. Def looking forward to it, but hope it’s within a decent price range (60-80k). "
"I think this will be key, though a F150 Raptor is about \~$70k when all is said and done so they do have some room."
Trucks are already crazy expensive
"Hi Elon, what I want most out of my pickup truck is the ability to activate a quarter mile EMP.  Thanks!

Also make it sound like a fart pls"
"Which is weird because coal powers EVs, not ICEs."
"It's ridiculous, right? Especially when my attraction to Tesla is ""damn, it can do 0-60 under 3 seconds and looks like a normal car?!"" - the eco stuff isn't too high on my priorities. I like Gale Banks' view on it. His top priorities tuning motors are power, efficiency and reliability. If you're not combusting fuel in the cylinder, you're not making as much power as you could be. Rolling coal is just a waste of fuel."
"I once saw a bumper sticker that said something like ""don't worry, I'll use twice the amount of fuel to make up for your hybrid"". It was unreal. The hate is strong and not reasonably founded."
"This. If anyone cares about power and not the sound of their vehicles, torque numbers alone will definitely garner some double takes"
"Oh god that is so juvenile and immature,

but I wanna try it anyway.

Just to be clear, I wouldn't *really* do it, but the idea makes me laugh. These dummies that roll coal, they mostly just get off on the idea of making liberals cry. At school, they would have been the ones bullying the geeks, assuming they were big enough, or in a big enough mob to feel safe in doing so."

I just checked his twitter account, didn’t realize the product map was in the thumbnail. Ok now i’m trying to contain myself. I’ve wanted the truck for years. It’s the most important vehicle by a mile."
"Yeah I know he's teased at it before, and I'm kind of contradicting myself now but I actually have a theory that the Model Y will get delayed (maybe until summer) so that Elon can surprise us with the pickup, just like with the roadster. The other thing I saw that hadn't been confirmed was that Semi production got pushed to 2020. I think we all knew it was going to happen but it's possible it's still on track for late 2019. "
"Musk retweeted that Forbes article which stated Tesla sold 90,700 cars in the US in Q42018. Retweets don’t mean he read through all the information. It’s likely to  happen but he has not stated (to my knowledge) that it’ll happen in 2019. "
"Ok, I see it in the time line for Elon, that's odd its not in the timeline on my feed, even though I see the retweet for all the other graphics for this article, so much for tweeter I guess."
But Tesla says 4-6 months :(
"Standard range is the base model version, with a supposed 210 range as opposed to the mid range, which has 260. The big deal for a lot of people(including me) is that it has a sticker price of $35,000, as opposed to the current lowest price, Model 3 mid range with premium interior ($44,000)

For maybe people, that makes Teslas go from ""I should not buy this car"" to ""I can make this work"" 

And its not exactly hard to make, it just makes less profit for Tesla and has thinner margins. Theres a reason they started with the expensive cars (Roadster, S) and then moved onto the cheaper ones. "
Hello mate!
Neat!
What is the Model X then?
"I love tesla and am the happy owner of a 2014 S, and my (admittedly minority) desire is that they someday make a model 3-based wagon. The CUV segment is truly the worst of all possible worlds. Tall, ugly, FAR less storage and space than a normal sedan. The electric version probably won’t have the atrocious handling of all the ICE versions, but still, why oh why do people like these things? I rented a ford escape titanium two weeks ago and it was worse (and smaller inside!?) than the Honda ‘Jazz’ UK right hand drive micro econo box I rented at christmas. Y Elon, Y? "
Yeah because they finally nailed the design in between sedan and SUV that doesn't look like an old station wagon. The new Honda Civic hatchback are the first ever hatchback civics I prefer over the coupe or sedans. They just look so alien and sharp
The CUV is an interesting archetype. It has many benefits.
"Perhaps we could say it will be to the Model X what the Model 3 is to the Model S?  I hope so.  I don't think I could justify spending $90k plus on an SUV, even if I had the money.  I could think really hard about $45/50k, though."

"Yes, I see it, thank, its not on my feed though, odd, I see all the other retweet for this article, but not this one (on my feed)."
"I must be reading those curves differently than you. For example, it seems to me that the Model 3 battery is currently limited by charger speed below 50 % charge, and might be able to hit 200 kW when the battery is close to empty. Seems like supercharging up to ~60 % in a matter of minutes and then driving for two or three hours to the next supercharger should be a viable road trip charging strategy with a Supercharger 3."
Great graphs!  I wonder if the charge rate over 50% is going to change much on Model 3 with the new superchargers. The packs are supposed to have much better cooling. 
"I imagine the semi trucks will get their own special supercharger. They will have huge batteries so they can charge a lot faster. 

I imagine this is mainly for the pickup and the model s and x. Pickup will probably have the option for the biggest battery they’ve put in a car yet. "
Going to need a something a bit more like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l16PMzqkV88) for the semis than 350kw
"Definitely going to be for large capacity cars and trucks.

I expect that the Tesla truck will be one of the first to utilize it (also the x/s after their next refresh)"
"Likely some areas will need upgrades, but it really depends on demand.  Faster charging doesn't necessarily mean more cars/trucks charging per day in all locations.  Tesla could add powerpaks to level the load demands to help ease pressure on the infrastructure, buying time for any needed upgrades.  If it's a remote enough area, adding local solar and wind generation will help.  I can't imagine Semi's will be purchased at such a rate initially that upgrades can't be performed to keep up with demand (that's if a significant number of the first semi's are used for long haul routes initially, and not just within their range and only charging at the terminal)"
"Speaking as a power engineer, the current superchargers are rated for 120kW per pair of stations. A typical service load is 2500kVA (basically the same as kW). So you should be able to easily add 40 stations without infrastructure upgrades in most places. Add a diversity factor to that load and you're looking at 60-80 stations on a single service drop."
"You're confusing energy and power. Just because it can deliver up to that much power, doesn't mean that it's likely to use that much continuously (peak power vs average). You're right that this could require significant infrastructure changes in the long run, but it's not quite as severe as you analysis suggests. "
"NYC only uses 11,000MW a day? I find that hard to believe. I would have guessed much more."

I'd guess that's design margin. You typically don't design something to operate right at the limit when you want it to last long term. 
That was in reference to the chargers themselves.  It's possible that Supercharger V3 is capable of charging multiple cars at 200-220kW (about the max the Model 3 is literally wired for and probably what the S and X will be updated to) at a time instead of having to split 135kW between two cars.
"That's per hour, not per year ;) "
"And a change to use same battery cells as model 3,surely."
"I'm still baffled as to why the Model 3 doesn't have a HUD. Seems like such a Tesla thing to do, especially since they removed that screen. Missed opportunity.

&#x200B;

What's your experience of the screen? I've heard that it's fine for speed, but for directions it starts to get annoying because it's so far right."
Good one:)
Last conference call.
  Not when you use a hard cover like I do. 
"Hopefully!  And, hopefully the same applies to those pickup truck drivers parking across multiple Tesla charging stations.

I know that EVs and care for our air/water somehow scares them and they are just acting out.  But, since the reaction is so strange in my brain it is hard to understand why and thus hard to estimate its prevalence."
"You ought to spend some time in Texas, then."
"Exactly, there are a few prime locations in Rundle that should have enough space for a store.

Even on the south-western corner of Rundle Mall and Pulteney St, with the construction works still ongoing. Stuff like this normally happened a months beforehand, so I hope they've already got a location!"
"Wishful thinking is Tesla really taking off in Australia with the 3 (hopefully with incentives) or maybe the Y in 3-4 years.

I really do hope the company rapidly expands their market here in Oz."
Poor scout 
You forgot the roadster
I just don't think they can currently get the range they advertised with the current batteries and are expecting the chemistry to get better by the time the roadster is out. 
"I don't even know the context of that number.   I'm assuming if your load is perfectly balanced, the force required to tow 300,000 lbs on flat ground would be much less.  The max tongue weight can't be all that high, unlike with the semi.  Plus, I wonder what the structural limits are to the frame and hitch.  \[And how long will your battery last pulling that, ha ha ha\]"
Well Tesla is an American company and there are plenty of pick ups in the U.S.

Ever read the story of the fox and the grapes?
"My CVT Accord (which doesn't have ""fake"" gears) is pretty great."
"Eh I drive a CVT Altima and it's not as bad as other CVTs I've driven. I actually rather like the car overall, but that's not hard when the previous car was a '97 Civic with various problems of age haha.

(I'd take a Tesla in a heartbeat though.)"
I want to be able to floor the accelerator without every cop within 2 miles knowing I'm flooring it.
I really think it’s a process and in the latter part of said process is the stage where they know they are a dying breed but before that is the denial stage of course.
"To be fair some of us simply are actual ICE fans. Not because I dislike EVs but because I love the rawness, vibrations and of course the sound you get with a proper sports car. EVs certainly are fun but for the most part emotionless in my opinion. That’s also why many people prefer screaming V10s or V12s over muffled twin turbos. "
"Instant torque doesn't mean anything in those types of competitions. Tires, weight, and locked diffs/transfer case do. "

Looking forward to when Coal powers down for good!
These people probably have more cc's than brain cells.  Best thing to do is ignore ignorance in any form.
"Diesels will naturally roll coal as a byproduct of high power, if I'm remembering correctly there's a point where to get more power you have to dump in excess fuel than what's required from a fuel/air standpoint in order to get the right amount of fuel to burn.

As in, if our engine requires 14.5 parts air for 1 part fuel, and you put in exactly that one part fuel, it won't all ignite properly since it doesn't distribute correctly in the cylinder, so you dump in 2 parts fuel so the 1 part ignites as it should and the rest is blown out as soot (Diesel's don't normally run at this ratio but just as an example). I could be wrong but that's how it was explained to me.

If you look at diesel competition motors, like the ones used in [tractor and truck pulling competitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWGE6rD7zGI), they make huge amounts of soot and it's not because they're willingly throwing out power.

Obviously, not every diesel in the world is tuned for pure power, but from what I understand what you are saying is true for petrol engines, it just doesn't apply to diesel because the two operate differently. "
"Somebody posted a pic of a lifted pickup with a bumper sticker saying ""i identify as a prius""

That one is actually funny, but what's goign on here is conservatives hating on liberals.  Attacks, not facts."
If the Pickup is anywhere close to what mr. Moustache has been describing then Ford is in deep trouble.
!RemindMe 6 Months
Tesla also said 4 - 6 months 5 months ago...sooo.
"Thanks for the explanation, that makes sense."
An suv. The model Y is likely to be much smaller and more hatchbacky. 
"Let's be honest, it's a van"
It's a minivan. I own one and I still think it's a van.
Hatchback model 3 would be amazing. Europe would buy the shit out of it.
"People like these things because of practicality. Yes some suck and are soul sucking and atrocious, but others are lifted hot hatches. I love hot hatches because I can take all of my skis and gear and everything with me, living with a sedan made me dislike them. I am hoping the model Y looks like a Porsche Macan, which is a superb vehicle. Think like a Subaru crosstrek. It’s a lifted hatchback. "
I woulda bought a Model 3 Wagon in a heartbeat. But the sedan is nice too!
"All I want is a BEV Honda Jazz with 500km range. Is that too much to ask?

Magic seats, cup holders everywhere, headroom, storage space, easy to park … what more does a city driver with occasional interstate and cross country trips on sealed roads need?"
"I am hoping the model Y is an outback replacement.

It will be competing with the Kia Niro and Hyundai Kona.

It would be nice to have the ability to drive on unimproved roads tho."
Part of the reason I used Mazda was because [Franz von Holzhausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_von_Holzhausen) worked there before joining Tesla.
"Lol my parents drove me around in a tiny subaru back in the day.  Admit it, your stroller is too big."
?? No it isn't. A Honda CRV is a small SUV. Or the Jeep Cherokee (not grand). The model X is more the size of a Grand Cherokee or a Pathfinder
"it's mid-size, it's even bigger than Honda Pilot"
yeah i want to know how the size compares to an x. the x is already small for an suv. 
Twitter works in mysterious ways some times.
"I don't expect unlimited upside on those curves. So there might be that much room, or maybe there is just room for another 25 kW. Even if there is room the charge rate at that point is already fast enough that higher rates start to be a relatively small marginal difference unless they happen across a large range of SOC."
It all depends on what C Tesla allows the battery to charge at and from looking at the charge curve of the Model 3 I seriously doubt that it can take more than 1.5C.
The current Supercharger can sustain 120kW all the way up to 100% if the battery can take it. I would not expect the rates to change anywhere where they are not currently peaked at 120 already.
Yes.  He’s already named them Megachargers.
"Is BEV viable for those trucks though? I feel like Hydrogen will be a better solution, considering the weight of batteries. This will probably be more of a problem in Europe though.

&#x200B;

What will the charging infrastructure for the Megachargers look like? I'm starting to think just the infrastructure will be pretty expensive. I mean have you seen a megawatt transformators? Those things are HUGE."
"I'm curious what the difference between kVA and kW is, such that different terminology is needed."
">You're confusing energy and power. Just because it can deliver up to that much power, doesn't mean that it's likely to use that much continuously (peak power vs average). 

I know it's unlikely everyone will plug in a car at the same time, but I figured the design combination would also be something that's pretty unlikely. I'm not an electrical engineer but for example in structural engineering we typically design for the load which has a 2% chance of occurring annually (likely to occur every 50 years). So a charging station might have to be designed for the day everyone in the Tesla driving club rolls in and plugs in after driving all day, even if it isn't necessarily 100% of chargers at 100% power.
"
"That's 2 year old information, is there anything newer about it? Tesla always changes up their plans."
I guess you don’t understand sarcasm

"Assuming you’re serious (as a lot of people confuse energy and power).  kW is a power rating just like horsepower.  It makes no sense to say my car makes 400 hp/year or per hour and it makes no sense to say a supercharger provides 350 kw/year or per hour.

What makes sense is that if you produce 350 kW for 2 hours then you have delivered 700 kWh of energy.

Apologies if you knew this already:)"
"I don't think so.

If they do just an interior refresh (as I saw reported months ago) it wouldnt change anything on the powertrain. If they update the battery pack for the new cells it would make sense to revise much more of the vehicle including the total capacity, motors, and body."
"It used to be on the right, but now they moved it to the left, closer to driver.

A/C controls can get distracting if you don't have autopilot. So is switching between radio, Streaming, BT. Can take too much time off the roads.

But other than that, I don't miss the dash at all. I cant go back to cluttered interiors anymore."
Awesome. I haven’t listened to them so thanks for the info!
This guy knows how to haul!

"As true as that may be, Nissan's CVTs are notoriously shitty.

I have a CVT Civic myself, and it's been fine. But it's worlds different from what Nissan has crapped out. Lots of droning, jerkiness, and constant rubber banding."
"My Subaru Legacy with a CVT is really awesome! It has the option for fake gears by means of the paddles, but if you just put it in drive, it's a normal CVT. 

Plus Subaru AWD 😎"
I believe it. I have a CVT civic 😂
The CVT in the Altima (at least from a few years ago) is horrid.  The Honda CVT and Subaru CVTs are among the better ones out there.
I like honda CVT but the new toyota design with true first gear and CVR for higher speeds it pretty damn cool too. I dont understand the fake shifting whatsoever. 
I actually have a CVT as well haha
"Based on your very reasonable response, I suspect you’d be in the “collector” camp and wouldn’t waste your time ICEing EVs. Make no mistake, I have a genuine appreciation for people like yourself who feel that emotion from great engineering. Much like oil painters vs digital photography. I think most of us can appreciate the skill required to do a great painting but wouldn’t want painters smashing digital cameras. "
Tesla definitely has the weight
"Is traction not a relevant factor? I've seen them done in mud and on wet asphalt, both of which are places where I would (perhaps naively?) think that dual motors+TC > locked diffs.

Maybe I am just not familiar with those sorts of edge cases though. :) "
Well I have a 4wd Ford superduty powerstroke in Florida if someone has a model x and wants to give it a try.  Only one stipulation. You gotta let me drive it. It's been over a year since I drove one and I'm jonesin
"Um, how so? "
"This was the video I watched that convinced me...

"I’m extremely concerned about it. He’s talked about how he wants it to be super futuristic and they just can’t do that imo. The look of it is the single most important thing. Everything Tesla has done has been about changing the mindset of people. Electrics are slow, build the fastest sports car etc. 

The vast majority of old men think electrics are these frilly little golf carts that nerds drive. They need to make it as manly looking as they can and squash that idea. It can’t be this shiny art project that appeals to the young generation. It needs to look tough. 

I think if they make it how Elon has mentioned they’ll be appealing to their hubris again (like he said they did with the model x) and making another product that isn’t aligned with the goal of reducing emissions. It’s just to make something cool that they like. Sorry for my rant. "
RIP my plan 
You're welcome!
But model X's are pretty small. I would already consider them more of a crossover than an suv
Outback replacement.
It's a lifted station wagon.
"Electric hot hatch is my dream car. Couldn't be on the 3 chassis/platform though, it's way too big."
Lack of a hatchback is the single reason I wouldn't buy one
"Lifted hot hatch is an oxymoron. 

A hot hatch needs to handle well. 

The Macan is a shitty vehicle with the interior space of a small hatchback but the mass of an SUV. "
Fun fact!  Thanks for sharing.
"Actually the umbrella stroller does not fit without being angled, we have a jogger and a bigger stroller. The cybex stroller could not lay down.  The cross trek trunk space is super tiny, you can lay down the seat and fit a bunch but thats not a good idea to have gear laying next to a small child, that stuff is a projectile in an accident.  The tm3 has more usable space than the crosstrek did. The best was picking up the baby and 3 adults from the airport, more stuff on the roof racks than inside the car.  But when we went anywhere with kayaks or snowboarding the gear is on the roof, and when you had a pack and play, the clothing for the activity and the accessories and then the overnight stuff it just wouldnt fit without having to put heavy things next to a child, and thats not ideal.  I miss the old wagons, i would rather have  that instead of the SUVs."
I guess it was the short height that threw me off cause it looks very small but after looking at dimensions I stand corrected 
"Yeah that's my point, I think they will change slightly. They could be limiting Model 3 to not make the S look bad. "
"Whatever it costs it will pay for itself fast. If Tesla can prove that this works and saves money then they will have every trucking company lined up to buy these things. Also keep in mind a lot of these trucks will be doing short haul, in town stuff and then they can charge at their warehouse overnight. Not every truck is going to need a full charge in 30 minutes. And for long haul, if they can get these puppies with a 700 mile range then that just about covers 1 days worth of driving so the driver can charge slowly at a truck stop overnight. As for infrastructure cost I believe they will get truck stops to buy these chargers and let them manage them with oversight. It’s really the only logical thing to do. And once truck stops realize that electric trucks are going to eventually take over then they should be smart enough to invest in the future. Again this is all based on the fact that Tesla can actually make this whole system significantly cheaper than a diesel semi. With the semi market though if it really takes of it’s going to put huge strain on the electrical grid. Hopefully Tesla has a plan for that.

As for hydrogen I am not really up to speed on the latest advancements but typically the infrastructure and the actually fuel would be much much more expensive. Also not sure if the weight of the drivetrain would be the same. Tanks to store hydrogen at pressure aren’t exactly light and the fuel cells would also be quite large. Everything else would be comparable to a BEV."
"VA accounts for power factor and it directly determines the size of the transformer needed to provide you service. These chargers are all solid state switched-mode power supplies to convert to DC. These types of devices have a power factor of approximately 1.0. In these cases, VA = W."
It's probably more likely that they'd design the system such that the charging power for everyone would simply reduce rather than try to design the system to handle peak simultaneous load when there's a small chance of that happening.
"He more recently mentioned that more details would be available Q4 2018. That time had obviously passed. It's still a thing. Most likely we'll get more info the first half of 2019.

Basically, updated charger tech to compete with the faster charging systems being released by Porsche and other premium brands."
It delivers 350 kwh per hour!
"I'm pretty sure they know that.

The discussion is about the max output of superchargers and if it will be updated to 350kW or more for instantaneous output.

kW makes sense as a unit when talking about rate.

As an aside, it'd be nice if all manufacturers rated their cars by the average kW the vehicle charges at. Then we could determine how fast they actually charge not just how fast it can charge at ideal conditions."
Yeah I was just being silly :p
"They will surely update the batteries, no way they will continue to make multiple types of battery unless there is a huge need for it.

They will also likely change the cooling to the model 3 style with the ""bandoleer"" approach, maybe even use the new motors too!"
"Surely, but it'll also come down to various factors too."
It is not a story a truck driver would tell.
I have a nissan cvt... kill me
">Nissan's CVTs are notoriously shitty.

This is news to me. I currently drive a CVT Altima Coupe and before that my first car was a CVT Sentra. I don't know anything else. What are good CVTs supposed to be/feel like?"
"Yeah, I have the paddles which ""gear up/down"" too but rarely use them. I guess they'd be useful for engine braking while driving on high grades."
Same.  CVT Forester.  Fantastic mileage for a compact AWD SUV.
Oh hahaha fair enough!
"Exactly. I feel like an EV would make a great daily, especially in cities, but you can be damn sure that I’d hoon around in a V10 on the weekends if I had the money haha! 

But I‘m also a motorsports fan in general, so basically I simply love anything that’s fast, loud and stinks of fuel :p "
">Much like oil painters vs digital photography.

Or just analog vs digital photography. Some people are confused when I tell them that photographic film is still available.

It just went from being *the* way to do photography to being a niche product for people who enjoy using it, much like black & white film did color became affordable."
"But not the drivetrain. Not the axles, diffs, transfer cases, etc."
"Traction is the relevant factor, not zero-rpm torque. That was my point. "
"The problem with traction control is that it will reduce the power when it slips, which in some situations is worse than slipping. In a case like mud, where it's often closer to water than pavement, having your tires with aggressive tread spin can act like a boat paddle through water. Traction control only really works when there is solid ground, in mud it will reduce power so much trying to find traction that it will go nowhere.

[Have you ever ridden or seen a water trike](https://fh-sites.imgix.net/sites/381/2017/10/10222233/Aqua-Cycle-Water-Trike-Rentals-image-2.jpg)? It's the same concept."
[deleted]
"I'm not sure that's disagreeing with me, at one point he explicitly says that with power comes smoke.

I believe what Banks is talking about is tuning for a given power level can be made cleaner through more efficient intake and exhaust tracks, etc, which will make it combust more efficiently, not that you can just chip a diesel for a high power output and make it burn totally clean.

Like unless you're deliberately redesigning the engine plumbing, a diesel will burn visibly dirty if you crank up the power; a petrol won't."
I understand your concern but I’m positive that they have learned their lessons. You’ll see)
"I parked next to one in my rav4 and it seemed massive, but I haven’t seen one compared to say a highlander or something big. "

Explorer dimensions: 198″ L x 79″ W x 70″ H

Q7 dimensions: 200″ L x 78″ W x 69″ H

Maybe it's not quite as high as some SUVs but it certainly is in the range for length and width."
"Model x has third row seating, the y will not have room for that."
"I would buy an electric hatch the size of the A3 yesterday if it existed.  A Model Y the size of the Model 3 but CUV will sell more, though."
[deleted]
So what should we buy if we want something fast with ground clearance and is smaller then an suv? 
"I certainly agree with electric trucks on short hauls, and thus overnight charging, but the batteries for those 700 mile trucks will be expensive.

I'm pretty certain though that for these the weight of a HEV will be much lighter than a BEV. I think weight is going to be a problem, at least with current energy density. I don't know what the weight maximum in America is, but someone calculated the weight of the battery and I think he came out to say that the maximum payload would be quite low.

Price wise I think BEV trucks are going to beat the everICEing shit out of diesel for short distances, but I'm not sure about those long routes, because of battery weight, battery price, charging infrastructure cost, grid infrastructure availability. We will need some thick ass cables. 

AFAIK most experts consider Hydrogen for trains, trucks, boats over battery. That's just what I know. BTW guys, downvote isn't the ""I disagree"" button. "
"Ahh, ok. I'd never heard of ""power factor"". Makes sense, now."
"As far as I've understood it, the new batteries are bigger, so they would need to redesign quite a bit. Rumour has been interior refresh soon and then full redesign a few years later (probably after truck and Y), which would then get the latest batteries."
The only good stories truck drivers tell are about lot lizards.
Has it died yet?  I hear Nissan CVTs tend to frequently need rebuilding.
The 2010 Sentra was my first experience with a CVT. God awful. Always felt like a slipping transmission.
"Yeah, this is when I use them on my parents’ Subaru "
"Exactly. I went for a more extreme example, but analog vs digital still has a “fight” going in the world of filmmaking. There are still purists who insist analog film is better, often for the same emotional/romanticized reasons. Replace grain structure/noise with an ICE’s noise. The irony being that almost every analog film is digitized for effects, editing, and color correction (“digital intermediary”) and delivered digitally these days."
"Ah, good point. Thanks! "
"Thanks, I was super confused "
"Yeah, direct injection made a big difference, they could be exact with how much fuel needed to go in rather than mechanical or early efi, where performance tuning was just squirting as much diesel as possible. He also defies the “we need to put in more fuel than necessary for its cooling effect” people with the water cooling he does.  

Either way, diesel isn’t the future. EVs have all of diesel’s pros and really none of its cons. "
"My M3 barely fits in my garage. I have 2"" of clearance at the front and back, and about 8"" to either side. It's not a small car."
"Putting aside the fact that most people don’t need the ground clearance anyway...

Wagons are dead so I won’t even go there. 

Sure, buy a compact crossover but know that you’re getting a worse vehicle (space, efficiency, handling) for more $. Than a sedan or a hatchback. "
Wow
Not yet but I'm at around 100k miles
"Right. I'm not saying diesel is the future or anything, I'm just pointing out if you tune for power you have to go out of your way to make it burn clean.  You can't just magically chip up the power and burn clean. 

I don't disagree that people tune their trucks to roll coal on people,

 I'm just pointing out if you tune for power it will do the same thing unless you spend a lot of time and money one redesigning the engine plumbing verses throwing a canned software tune on it. 

I own the exact opposite of whatever you think a coal roller has, it's not like I'm trying to defend my honour or something. "

"I have the RWD version not the performance, but I'd say it definitely does not feel like a small car. It's the biggest car I've had so far (90s Civic, 00's Focus, and '15 Saab 9-2X were the previous ones), and it feels like it when driving.

Don't get me wrong, the driving experience is amazing, but it *feels* like a big car with buttloads of grip and a low CoG. Of course, this is all subjective obviously; just because I get a different feel from my experience doesn't mean I'm saying yours is wrong."
"I’m hoping electric small SUVs will be better engineered with a lower CG and more internal room. Fingers crossed. 

Friend owns a Macan - it’s really low volume inside for its outer size and overall mass. Nice vehicle over all though. "
The electric power train is beneficial for interior space and lower cg. Tesla’s batteries are very low in the chassis and the frunk adds to the storage space. I bet electric crossovers will be much more practical then gas ones. 
"Yup exactly!

It’s going to be interesting watching some companies build new platforms  (Eg: VB MEB and MB EQC) and others try to modify gas ones. 

$10 says Honda foes the latter with the CRV and fails. I really hope that ugly vehicle dies. "
"I hate the CRV and traditional crossover styling. Also I agree, putting an electric power train into a gas platform doesn’t give you all the benefits of electric. I’m curious about the Kona suv, I don’t know much about it. "

I KNEW one of fuckers would hoon this shit some day.
The tires screeching whit out the roar of an engine sounds other worldry.
That's most all cars...just pull the fuse and have fun ;)
Sounds like an easy toggle switch mod 
"What does the title say, I was distracted by the Tokyo drifts in the video"
That looks fun 
SC in most cases doesn't work without a working ABS or TC
Looks like understeer heaven until you power out.
"Heavy understeer with the DSC turned off, and then power oversteer. Would be a handful on a track. "
"So we sold the 21"" turbine wheels that came with the Model S because they're so sensitive to potholes, which it some bubbles in the sidewall. And replacement tires for those wheels is ridiculously expensive. All I can see in this video (aside from all those close calls with that tree) is some 21"" turbine wheels needing some replacement tires soon.
   
Also, I gotta admit, that looks like a lot of fun. "
This guy got bars!!!
ka-kansei dorifto?
On a side note (and no offense to OP or anyone that may have done this): God I wish I had the right amount of money to do stupid shit like this. I have my Model 3 and I treat it like a newborn. 😭
"Model S owners will now say they dont need the Model 3 Long Range Performance ""Track Mode"".c"
"Huh, an all electric drift car...."
"These comments really show how most of you are those overly cautious wuss drivers that cant fucking merge. Hes not gonna crash, just like you wont if you stop going 5 under."
"I suggest that people do exactly this when they get a new car - but preferably on cheap old tires, and they should stay farther away from the edges of the lot and anything they could hit. I'm talking about the drifting part, not the ABS disconnection part.

This is the only real way to learn the way a car grips, the way it loses grip, and the way to control it then regain grip. If you learn to do this in controlled situation like an empty wet parking lot, you'll have a much better chance of handling it successfully if it happens when you don't expect it. So many people have the fallacy that they watch racing or saw a video explaining it, so they think they know how to do it - but they absolutely don't, because they wont remember that stuff in the split second that they have to react. But if you properly learn how to do it, it's a lot more like riding a bike.  You may be a bit wobbly when you have to do it much later, but you have a far better chance of staying in control."
The most noise a Tesla can make
Too much fun 
Does anyone have photos on the easiest way to remove the ABS Sensor?
[deleted]
" Nice
"
Is this in western Washington?
Holy shit this is awesome. Would love to see the same scenario with stability control engaged to compare 
"This is a common ABS/TCS feature, I call it unlocking Dukes of Hazzard Mode"
Someone has no idea how to do a donut. 
Now this is how you have fun!
Former mustang owner
That puckered my butthole!
"Pro tip, it is the same for all cars..."
"All the mods are asleep, quit everyone post there illegal Tesla mods"
"Haha, look at all the gas this dude is wasting!"
So weird seeing a car slide around with out that engine rumble and popping. Guess this is the future! Haha 
/r/nonononoyes
Pro tip: Don't do this.
*Insert Initial D music*
Driver needs some car control lessons...
Ballet on wheels. That was amazing.
Dang that looks like fun.
Holy fuck! Lol
I was soooo waiting for it to crash into a pole or the curb but then realized it’s not a mustang 
"This is so badass, it looks like a fuckin RC car just whipping around the lot. But- plz don’t be a mustang and smash into the curb!!!! "
This is a terrible pro-tip. You’ll void your warranties and increase chances of crashing your expensive car. 
Legit terrifying. Are you the driver OP?
"Downvote, no crashing."
So bad for the car lol
Looks really fun! props to that driver for having a good time!
Which is why I drive a bmw
That's.... Not a pro-tip....
r/shittylifeprotips
Apparently disables common sense too
Kinda hoped they crashed it with how close they were cutting it.
[deleted]
How would it drive normally?
What’s the point of this?   Why would somebody want to do this to their Tesla?  
This guy was on his way to trade his car in for a new one.  Would suck to be the guy who buys his used Tesla.  Do the poop stains come off the seats?
[deleted]
yeah cutting it a bit close in that big ass lot
It did end in tears of joy...
[deleted]
Dramatic effect!
Underrated comment here^
Don't have to worry about plugging your ABS sensor back in... 
Then waiting 7 months for it to get fixed. I think I'll actually get mine back this week! 
Fuck. I just listed my other tesla on there. Is there a way to monitor how they treated the car other then lack of dents lol?
Rain give it away?
No fuse to pull on AP2.5 cars
I guarantee I can do this in a wet parking lot with my 3 without having to disconnect a wheel sensor. 
In the 80s with early 1 or 2 channel ABS systems people used to pull the fuse on Porsches for driving on the track. 
Is there seriously no way to disable traction/stability control legitimately?
"No need for Turo! Just steal your friends Tesla!

"I rent my Tesla out, and fuck this comment"
I was watching this with my butt wide open.
I watched it on the toilet. Made it easy

"This is how I learned how to drive. Parking lots in the snow, before the curbs fell."
That's good for him because he sure isn't getting one in working order from Tesla anytime soon.
who is that guy btw? Ever since YouTube's algorithm found out I like Tesla it has been recommending me his videos along with the usual FUD. All I know is he repaired his own Tesla.
"Because it's hella easy to break traction in a car with 245 tires and 500+ ft/lb torque available with a slight pedal stab.  Crash-inducing dangerous at speed if you forget it's off, or are inexperienced.  Something like track mode on the S would be nice though."
Because they want to avoid this. 
"I know you’re kidding, but track mode actually adds increases the sensitivity of traction control and such. "
[You'll be fine.](https://youtu.be/JOXDsUCZfgg) 
"I'd be more afraid of popping a bead when all that weight transfers to the leading tire. Then, you get to explain to the service center why your rim is ground down a tiny bit. :)"
The tires would go long before any damage to the suspension. 
"That only happens if you hit a curb, or a speed bump. On wet flat pavement, it's pretty safe fun."
"The metal is stronger than the tires' grip. If you manage to damage anything other than the tire (without hitting a curb), then the problem would probably bite you on the road at some later time.

And in most cars the wheel bearings are not that expensive to replace, though it takes some time in the shop. But on a Tesla, it's anyone's guess what those cost and how quickly they can be replaced."
SC stability control
How come I never see you drifting?
"They're not Tesla rims... And they're actually 19's.

https://tires.tirerack.com/tires/Rial%20Lugano%20Tesla"
Amen brother. 
"agreed! I took my tesla out for a spin on a parking lot and it saved me when I a few weeks later hit an ice patch and I started to drift out, almost off the road. It was incredibly good to have felt how the car behaves when it looses control and how to regain it."

"Stability control would automatically try to straighten out the vehicle by braking on individual wheels. When it's disabled the brakes just lock ALL the wheels up which causes skidding. Here's a video about stability control:

It's fun.
I still have the car and don't plan on selling it. It's not like these things are made of butter... They can take more than you think.

Empty parking lot
I think he’s referring to the number of times the driver got close to some objects like trees and stuff. 
Haha you said gas!
"The guy in this video is not in control of his car. 

When I was younger I used to drift competitively and did a bit of rally as well and even knowing what I was doing I broke a few tie rods and smashed a fender. (On race tracks setup for this stuff) 

If he keeps this up it will end in tears. "
Haters gotta hate
Why do these comments exist?
"...so, he has that going on for him, which is nice."
"As a new model S owner.........wait, what? 7...months? Did you accidentally melt it?"
Check the energy output history graph for spikes in energy exertion.
No
"Could be LA any time last week, actually "
"Yeah, if you have track mode... For some reason Elon doesn't want to give it to all of us though..."
Still works for 996 911s...
I used to do this in my Jetta so I could put McDonalds trays under the rear tires and drift in parking lots.
"Correct - except in the Model 3 Performance, sort of."
"Old red had a setting to ""disable"" it like track mode, so it was partly off.  900 lb feet of instant torque makes it useless to actually turn off except for spins."
Real men do this with their own cars
I fuck my Tesla out and rent this comment.
"Yeah, you’re the one that rents your car out.  Having worked a bit for enterprise you’d have to pay me $3000/day to rent out my car.  And it’s a Mitsubishi. "
*uncle has entered the chat*

No one forced you to write that 
Can anyone confirm? Next step would be to rewirer a switch.
Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra
"He actually got to see the car. Apparently, a higher-up at Tesla caught wind of the videos and had the car sent to a Tesla body shop to be fully repaired. Despite the awful communication, Rich was able to track it down and see it for himself after finding the closets body shop. I love Tesla, but they definitely need to work on their processes and communication a ton. Also, I feel they need to bring back the Certified Pre-Owned program, as the new system is horrid."
"Yeah, he's a Tesla guy who's torn apart a lot of stuff in his Tesla rebuild efforts. I don't think he's ever had a legit one, just driven ones that he's rebuilt/had problems. Although his current mission is to finally get the used Model X that he ordered from Tesla \~2 months ago. He's rambled about it in his last few videos, he's having a nightmare with it."
"He rebuilds salvaged Tesla's and puts them back on the road; he may have been the first to do it properly, and if not he's one of the first. He has a 80% love 20% hate relationship with them, and the hate is from the fact that they just won't sell repair parts, and even their own repair shops can't get parts (automakers are required to stock several years worth of spare and replacement parts to the market, to ensure that cars can be fixed even if the automaker goes bankrupt the next day. It's kind of like the way casinos are required to always have enough funds to cover every chip on the floor).

Though there's a bit more on the hate side recently after they screwed around for 2 months with a bunch of delivery dates and no one knowing where his car is, much less it's condition.

And Tesla just fired a bunch of people, so that won't get any better."
Bingo. You'd see a lot less videos of idiots crashing their brand new sports cars if they weren't allowed to turn off TCS. ..and even low level model 3s have a lot more torque than your average sports car.
I'm aware and that's why SC/TS exist in the first place. But 99% of cars let you disable them via a button. 
You think its not easy with a 1k hp supercar?
"Why? Every other manufacturer doesn't have an issue letting people fully disable TC/SC. Hell, some even have a drift mode that helps you drift. "
Better then I could do but still pretty shitty drifting. 
What are you even taking the car in for service for?
"Thanks for all the answers, i can finally have some fun without being afraid of breaking anything."
"Wet, most likely. What if it's almost always dry."
"That's what it says? And holy shit, you really the owner!!?"
Phew! Thanks for the relief. Now I an appreciate the video even more :) 
You had to do the replacement? If it was under warranty - why?
Much better. 
A professional doesn't tankslap and spin out like this guy
Ha!! Cool.. My attempt to be funny.  Don't think I could do that to my car.
I guess I drive my cars a little easier and prefer them to not be abused. You can do whatever the heck you wanna do on your car.  
Just making a joke. They look like they know what they're doing. Most people don't though...
"and the curbs, I was surprised he didn't hit anything  given all the open space he had to work with but yet was drawn to be closer to the camera "
"I think he knows, seems like he’s saying that it’s ridiculous that the driver got so close to the curb when he had such a big lot to work with "
"...yeah, what else would he have been talking about?"
Boom. Roasted. 
Underrated comment.
"its a legacy term that will remain. Just like you still save to a 3,5 inch disc icon. "
who cares?
"I’m not defending this guy, but I know for a fact hybrids (and I’d imagine full electric cars suffer from this as well) don’t respond to throttle (off) inputs like a conventional drivetrain to help you make the chassis rotate.  I’m an aggressive driver and have learned over years with FWD and RWD cars to manipulate the direction of a car by using engine braking ... you just can’t get that with an electric motor. "
oh my god i'm still wondering how i'm not literally afloat after all that rain.  reminded me of ten years ago when it used to rain like that a few times a winter easily.
"In fairness, a lot of us 3 owners paid significantly extra for Track Mode as a feature of the P3D"
"I’ve seen rumors that turning on “slip start”  has the same effect. I’m a bit of a square and haven’t ever done this in any car, so I have no real idea if this is true. "
"Track mode won't let you spin it like a top, it's a performance tune of traction control and not a disable switch."
It's the new batteries in the 3. Track mode would damage your batteries.
They always say the fastest car you drive is one you don't own.
"> I fuck my Tesla

Californians. "
That's why most of us don't develop emotional attachments to our vehicles.
Why?
It’s a lot different renting from another human vs a corporation. People have treated my car with respect because they have to face me when they return. Nobody wants to fuck up an expensive Tesla. 
Lumbago!

"His car is still a mystery amount of time away.

As long as the car knows if anything is wrong I'm fine with a cheaper reselling program that doesn't certify vehicles. Hopefully that's what they are working towards."
Or at least put it into a less-intrusive mode that lets you get a bit sideways without intervening.
"Have you driven a model 3 performance or p100d? These things aren't normal cars...

But yes, I wish it was a button as well"
"They don't have maximum torque at zero rpm, and I've yet to see one width 245 width tires lol.  "
Lots of manufacturers don’t let you fully disable TS/SC/ESP. Including both Toyota and Mercedes Benz. 
"Unseated bead. Normal tire shop is perfectly able to fix this, but you know, Tesla folks might want to take it to Tesla (if you can't get the bead re-set in the field)."
Oil change 
You should be fine even on 100% dry pavement. Those suspension components are much tougher than you think. 
Then you just have to give it more power to keep the tires slippery.
"Go do a local auto cross (autox).  Learn more car control and build more confidence in the car and it’s engineering.  You’ll have fun doing it!

Other than nailing an immovable object, he’s not hurting his car."
"Because it initially didn't come with autopilot. It was a Pre-AP car. Retrofitted the DAS, Parking sensors, iBooster, ESP2, various ECUs, radar, etc.

Then took it in because there was an issue with a headlight and the door handles, and it was fixed under warranty."
[deleted]
I have no idea how sarcastic this is. 
"True, even worse in this case, because regen is also completely disabled when you disconnect an ABS sensor."
So? My Model S cost significantly more than any Model 3 you can buy...
I think slip start disengages after a few mph. I'm too lazy to search for my manual... 
"We tried getting the RWD 3 to spin out on the snow last weekend, just a bit of kick but nothing fun. "
"Pretty sure this is the case, I'm not understanding the down votes. If not the batteries themselves, then the entire cooling system/management system. They are different and have different capabilities. The 3 deals with overheating better.

Now they may be able to come up with a track mode for the S/X that just gives you the minimized ABS instead of extra power as well, but as I understand it, it isn't as simple as just copying the code across from the PM3."
I’ve been on this sub long enough to say that just wrong.  Most of the people have have definitely developed an emotional attachment to their vehicle. 
"Because people treat rental cars like shit.  Saw one with a completely fucked motor once because the guy driving it kept going when the temp was in the red line because “it wasn’t his problem”a rental car might as well have 100,000 miles on it when it hits 40,000 because every mile is going to be full accelerator. "
The best off-road vehicles are 4x4s and rentals. 
"People renting out fancy, fast car, to drive it like grandma in a corolla? Seems unlikely.

It's more likely that you get fancy car to have some fun, and let insurance take care of any damage."
Yea I doubt that. 
I've driven both and much more powerful cars.  I just think it's weird not to have the option of fully disabling the nannies on a performance car. 
"> They don't have maximum torque at zero rpm, 

Don't need to, its called a clutch.

>and I've yet to see one width 245 width tires lol.

Maybe you missed this part: ONE THOUSAND HORSEPOWER. It's more than enough to rip any size tire to shreds."
You can completely disable TC on AMGs. 
"Maybe it's model dependent, but all of the Mercedes' and Toyotas I've driven allow you to fully disable all nannies (minus ABS). In some cases, they aren't as simple as pressing a button. But even a Prius lets you entirely turn off SC/TC with a button sequence. "
That's what I meant -- frankly I'd stay the hell away from Tesla service for almost anything except warranty or recall work. And especially tire service. 
"Man, that’s a lot of work, but yeah, nothing there should void warranty on unrelated parts. Was mostly curious what led you to do all of that work. Impressive."
I am..
I don’t think anyone was being sarcastic..
"Yeah, not a fan of a lot of the software-locked features. 

Makes me worry for the future of cars where a base model could have some capabilities of a higher-trim car but have stupid software blocks."
"And that extra money got you an S not a 3.  

Though I think all P cars should get track mode.  

Maybe after they switch the S/X away from Bosch traction to their in-house system currently in use on the 3."
"Can confirm that slip start doesn’t add much fun. You can floor it with no traction to either tire and the car will still give you no power, even in slip start. "
TIL...more or less enough on the topic :)
"It's not the case.  The S and X have a completely different traction control system made by Bosch.  The Model 3 has a traction control made by Tesla.  tesla has full programming ability to do anything they want to the Model 3 traction system, and that ability became track mode.  It's probably also why their emergency braking early tests were less than great, but got better in an update.  They're learning to make a full in house traction system.  They don't have the same degree of direct control over Bosch."
"To...Turo rentals? Cuz that's a bad idea. A friend of mine dumped a whole bunch of money into his Model X with a full detail, a clearbra, wheels, etc. and put it on the platform and it was totaled after less than a month."
"To be fair, I've seen a lot of people do this with their own cars as well."
I don’t rent to early 20’s guys who want to whip it around. My Turo listing is very clear what my car is for. I also track it on the Tesla app so I know where it is at all times. Everyone who has rented it (10+ people) have all been very respectful and treated it great. No issues. 
Wait what? There literally isn't anything more powerful than a p110d in ludicrous mode on the road.
Please let me know what cars you've driven that are more powerful than a P100D that also include any sort of traction control/aren't purpose built track cars.
"Ever see that Chris Harris video where he takes an AMG with TCS turned off and replaces all 4 tires with donuts/spares? Yeah, that was great."
"Yes, indeed. A very small subset of all MB’s. "
"A friend of mine has an 04 Avensis that only lets you disable traction control. As for Mercedes Benz I saw a skid pad segment on Fifth Gear many years ago with one of their SUV’s in where they discussed the ESP in great detail and demonstrated how you could turn it off, but not really, by attempting to drift it around the wet skid pad. After a certain point the car just says “you don’t got this” and cuts in. They needed a technician with a laptop to fully disable it so that they could actually drift the car. 

Why anyone would ever want or need to disable SC on a Prius is just beyond me TBH. My 2005 Audi Quattro allows me to disable ESP, but will still use an electronic imitation of a front LSD. It doesn’t do anything for the rear wheels, but if one of the front wheels spins up you’ll hear and feel it braking that wheel. "
"Getting ready for development on the AP1 platform for openpilot once it eclipses AP1's capabilities (soon^^^^tm ). Also its a fun project and cheaper than buying a new car. All in all, it was about $4,000, and 2,500 of it was for the new rear bumper."
I don’t think you know what sarcasm is..
That just makes it funnier. 
"just announced, EA to start producing electric vehicles 

$30,000 gets you the vehicle, if you preorder you can get the sequential turn signal bonus!

for an additional $5,000 you can purchase the Highway Speed DLC!"
its because they're taking a loss on their expected margins for that level of features in the hope you upgrade later when you have the money. Its not blocked off just for shits. Its cheaper for them to run less assembly lines with only a few differences.
That is already the case since many years. No one cares.
"> Makes me worry for the future of cars where a base model could have some capabilities of a higher-trim car but have stupid software blocks.

When that starts happening on a serious level I'm sure someone will write some software to start jailbreaking Teslas"
"They're not software locked features, they're hardware locked features. Its very well known that the Model S will overheat on the track.

When you buy new tech, you have to accept that newer tech will come later and be better and cheaper. That's just the way it works."
"it does give me a lot of power and all the wheels spins, however as soon as the car senses it's going sideways the traction control kicks in"
"cheers! that's good info, I had never read anything about that, but I do remember discussion about the batteries being responsible at some stage. Not having full control over the TCS makes more sense though. "
LOL no offense to the lot of you in this sub but its funny how many of you aren't actually car people but talk like you know something.
Are you joking? There are plenty of more powerful cars. 
"My Corvette is one. I've also driven a Supra, Evo, GT-R, Gallardo, and a Civic that made more power. With the exception of the Civic, they all had traction control and stability control systems that could fully be turned off. "
You mean one of the largest sub brands in the world? 
"Yup. It just feels... weird, that a Tesla with a 60kw battery and a 75kw battery actually have the same battery, and 60kw owners can pay to unlock it. However that makes a lot more sense than locking out simple shit like traction control (and the hypothetical sequential turn signals LOL). "
"EA would make you re-purchase AP every year, with fewer features each time and more micropayments for every used feature."
You know what else is cheaper? Not overpromising.  I’m rooting for tesla but a fake paywall for a physical product that’s actually there is bullshit. 
"The ""new"" mini is a classic for this, same engine and everything on cheaper model but different software on the ecu"
"Name one in production that is quicker than a p100d ludicrous up to 100 mph that is under $140k, with instant torque and a low barrier of skill entry that is begging for noobs like me to wipe out in it."
"Name one in production that is quicker than a p100d ludicrous up to 100 mph that is under $140k, with instant torque and a low barrier of skill entry that is begging for noobs like me to wipe out in it."
"I just watched twobitdavinci YouTube and it was mentioned that while the early 60W batteries were actually 75w software locked to 60, this has not been the case now for some time.  "
I’m not a Tesla owner but I assumed that was a warranty issue or at least that’s the way they would explain it. That to warranty a 75kw battery cost more than if they keep it at 60kw. That the owner needs to pay more because maybe it’s less reliable at full capacity
"So you want every car to cost twice as much? You're lucky they give you an option to get it for cheaper by switching a few things off, and you don't have to buy a whole new car to get updates next year."
"Wait you were just telling me how difficult it is to drive and now you're telling me there's a low skill barrier to entry?

And how is price relevant to this discussion? LOL we're not deciding which one is a better value, we're determining why you're not able to remove traction control.

There are cars like the McLaren P1 and Porsche 918 Spyder that are faster in virtually every metric available. But LOL@ talking about needing traction control to go in a straight line at 100mph. These cars are thrown around road courses at double those speeds. There is no car that needs traction control more than these ones.

Just stop before you dig yourself a deeper hole."
"You're shifting the goalposts here. The question was about cars more powerful than a P100DL. Spend 10 minutes on google and you'll see that there are plenty. 

Besides, a P100D is very easy to drive compared to something like a $35k Mustang GT. RWD and a lot of torque means that it's very tail happy. The barrier of entry is also much lower than a P100DL. However, Ford still lets you disable every nanny with the press of a button."
">while the early 60W batteries were actually 75w software locked to 60

It was the late 60kW batteries that were software locked.  The early 60 batteries were 60 for real.  Then they stopped making the 60 but kept the named option (and cheaper price) of the S60 still available for a while before only offering the 75 as the smaller battery option.  

Like how the S and X are only available in 100 batteries now.  They could have still offered the 75 option at the same price as before, and then allowed an unlock to 100 later since they're not making 75 batteries any more.  This was more expensive than it needed to be, but did get some people to upgrade...  But not enough to sell software locked 100 batteries at 75 prices right now."
Yea lucky. If I sold you a car that has Bluetooth and wireless charging for your phone but made you pay to unlock them would you be pissed?  It’s the same concept.  It’s the principle that god they do it now. They will do it more in the future with more than just the batteries when costs aren’t the problem.
"Yes, low barrier to entry for going fast is what I'm saying. Push the pedal and you are off... into a wall etc. And yeah ok, how many porsche spyders do you see on the road? Hello... this is why price matters."
"I'm not shifting the goal posts but I could have been more explicit up front. For drifting, the p110d has more power and ease of use than any other car in its price range.

Ultimately, I want to see a button too and I'm not entirely certain why they chose not to make one. I'm trying to offer a possible scenario."
"No? Because I didn't pay for the tech package that has those features. Its the same thing as paying for a car from another manufacture and not receiving those features, except instead of taking it in to add all those features and pay parts, fees and labor, you can just login to your Tesla account and pay for the upgrade and its there next time you get in it. You got that convenience because you didn't pay what the product really cost in the first place."
"> made you pay to unlock them would you be pissed?

Why do you think I have any right to be pissed? I paid for a car without Bluetooth and wireless charging, and I will get a car without Bluetooth and wireless charging.

If I wanted a car with Bluetooth and wireless charging, I would pay for it upfront.

Now, this software unlock gives me the opportunity to change my mind later without having to buy a whole new car.

Car manufacturers have been doing this since decades, no one ever complained. In the time before software updates, instead of diconnecting software switches, they disconnected wires."
">how many porsche spyders do you see on the road? Hello... this is why price matters.

I don't understand how that's relevant."
"We can agree to disagree. 

If I’m buying a car I don’t want the extra weight of shit I don’t want in there. Especially if I’m buying a car for performance. 


Also If I buy a pint of milk I don’t want to carry around a gallon. If I buy one orange I don’t want a bag of them. It’s wasteful if you never use them. It wastes the resources it takes to build regardless of costs. 


You might think that’s silly and that’s fine but you don’t speak for everyone. "
"More noobs driving a car = more reason to not turn traction control off. Tesla in particular seems to ve attracting drivers that have probably never controlled such power before.

"
"Thats fair to disagree, just trying to inform not attack or anything. For what they ""waste"" for your car that makes it the same as everyone else's, they save in not having to build 12 more factories to produce yours exactly the way you like it.

You're an early adopter in a new car company, they don't have the resources that Ford or GM size companies have yet and they have to optimize their production right now. And a Tesla is already super heavy because of the battery. The bluetooth chip isn't hurting anything. And the weight is part of the reason the car is so safe and can't flip over."
"Nah I got all that. It’s one of those contradictions that people will get pissed over though reasonable or not. 

And they’re not really exploiting anyone but the other car manufacturers will exploit the shit out of people so I don’t want the trend to keep growing to other parts of the care besides software updates. 

They’re already putting fake muffler tips on cars and calling them performance exhausts. Lol. "
"People used to laugh at electric cars. 'It's not a real car' they would say. We understand your doubts — well, we understand you had doubts yesterday. Electric cars were never as fast nor have they ever been as visually appealing as their ancestors. Today, Tesla succeeds in changing those stigmas.

In creating an emissions-free electric car, our goal was not to build the fastest sedan in the world. But with a sedan that can accelerate from 0 to 60 in 2.5 seconds, we did it anyway. Other automakers focus on sporty performance or pure luxury at the expense of all else, but we say: why not have both? And that's not even the best part.

We believe in a future of self-driving cars making our roads safer and more efficient for everyone. With more than a billion miles driven on Tesla's Autopilot self-driving system, our cars are safer than humans and are learning to be better every day. It really is the future, a future we are proud to be at the forefront of making — a future of tomorrow, not one that is decades away.

So the next time you see a Tesla pass by on the street, don't just think electric. Think environmentally friendly, think fast, think smart. And when it's time for your next car purchase, think of Tesla as the car to drive you into the future.

Here's my stab at the text, with credit to /u/ektomtapeter for the brilliant ad and /u/pvtcookie for that first paragraph and for setting a great tone for the copy. It's not perfect from me either, but maybe there's a good idea or two in there as well. :-)"
This is nostalgic for the future. I love it!
"I love the concept. You even converted the picture of the car into newsprint dots which complimented the yellowed paper. The tagline is great because it doesn't just compare Tesla to Ferrari but it can start people feeling even more nostalgic.

Here's how I would re-do the body copy:

You've been dreaming of one since you were a kid. An episode of Magnum PI was a disappointment if you didn't get to see it. A Ferrari was the best car, you told your friends. No car was better. Others at the schoolyard wanted a Lamborghini Countach but they were wrong.

You grew up. You got sensible, fuel-efficient vehicles. Smart choice vehicles that didn't waste your hard-earned pay. Solidly built vehicles that didn't unexpectedly set you back. You began to embrace the fun of driving a slow car fast.

Now you can have it all. Affordable, reliable, efficient and fast like Magnum's Ferrari. You might even consider growing a moustache and wearing a Tigers hat. Whatever you do, stop by your Tesla store today. It's time."
I still want a Ferrari.
"Why are old ads written like that? Did people actually read those? If yes, why don't modern ones have it?"
great!
Bummer the typos make it unpleasant to read/share.
I knew ~~one of the guys~~ the guy responsible for that line of ads. The tv show Mad Men was based on his company.
You’re putting the idea of a Ferrari in their head more than a Tesla.
Does a Ferrari even need an ad?
You brilliant MF. That's simply superb!!! 
That copy though. Ugh.
"Kudos, though agree with others that body copy needs punching up, shorter sentences, more active voice. Also DDB style would have a period on the headline. Also, why Ferrari not capped?  There is a book about those ads, called *Think Small*."
Comparing to a Rolls Royce isn’t good either IMHO.
Not sure about the placement of the Tesla logo. Could also use a orphan and widow clean up. “it is” is short enough to qualify as one. Cool design nonetheless. 
One Ferrari please.
If I made a subreddit called r/fakecaradds would you guys follow/post stuff?
"Honestly, it's true though how I caught the Tesla fever. Just a few years ago, I lust over the BMWs, the Mercedes Benzs, the Porsches, etc but now all I care to look at is Tesla. It's no small feat by Elon and his team to make many of us think that an electric car is so much cooler than traditional luxury sports cars."
"i mean, i still want a Ferrari"
Gotta love the design

"Now I want to see the National Lampoon equivalent ad. ""If Ted Kennedy had driven a Tesla, he'd be President today!"""
I read it in one of those old-timey 80's commercial narrator voices
"Nice concept. In keeping with the original VW print ads, you may want to consider setting the text alignment to justify as well."
Was it Jeff Zwart that did the awesome ads for Volkswagen and Porsche back in the day/Still today? He's a cool guy I was introduced to him by watching Ken block and the hoonigans YouTube channel and now I'm a fan.
Loved those old VW ads.  Simple and effective.  Also loved the old Marantz stereo ads from the 70's. Equally simple and effective.
"It does look a little bit like Ferrari F12 with smoother angles:
https://i.imgur.com/N0DeLVr.jpg"
This is actually real cool.
Absolutely lovely 
This ad was featured in mad men Being Early 60s
What's Ferrari bruh?
"Tesla is to car, what car was to horse and buggy."
"This is genius, plain and simple. Well done!"
This is wonderful.  I love mine as much I loved my MGB in college.
"You can blame the establishment automotive industry and thier ignorant marketing team and executives for electric (and hybrids) image today.

The bastards took what should have been a performance ENHANCING technology and gave it an image of compromising performance.

Just look at the old Honda Accord Hybrid V6. It had 40 more HP than the non hybrid V6. Or the eTorque Ram 1500. Another 40hp above the standard V8 makes it almost the most powerful half ton sold. Hybrid should mean an efficiency AND power-adder, not a compromise.

Thank goodness Musk delivered on the performance front in spades. With the P100D out accelerating supercars it finally shows what an electric motor can really do."

I used to work at the factory. I’d most definitely rather have a Ferrari 
"I think it’s hilarious how Tesla has never once ran any sort of advertisement for any of their products, yet they’re known worldwide and one of the best selling and fastest growing automakers in the world. I bet the gas car companies are furious about spending billions a year on marketing when Tesla doesn’t spend a dime on it. I fucking love Tesla "
How did you manage to give it the dotted/print effect
"It’s really hard to make Tesla ads not sound condescending because they truly are in a class of their own.

It’s like a rolls Royce but safer, faster, quieter, smarter, more efficient, and way more reliable. With Tesla you truly can have it all."
Zooming in and out is so weird with the way the car changes how it looks
Nice. I like. 
"Great idea.

Although I would have used the ""Ferrari"" (note the capitalized letter) comparison with the new electric roadster. I believe, model S should be compared to the upper-end of the luxury BMW, Mercedes and consort. Model X to a Volvo or Rolls Royce. Model3 to the lower-end of the luxury BMW, Mercedes and VW.

But that's just my opinion."
I mean it also depends..I bought my model 3 after owning my testarossa for around 30 years..but sold it almost a week later and went back..I just prefer a noisy cabin😜
"Alternate copy. ""0 Miles Per Gallon"""
"Why is Rolls Royce capitalized, but not Ferrari?"
Still take a Ferrari over a 3
"1000th upvote, I can die a happy man."
Bravo 
Good job
Make a printable 11x8.5 size please!
"[Amazing,You](https://Amazing.You) should do more of these."
"Reminds me of the old Top Gear sketch where they made a VW add quoting “VW, from Berlin to Warshau in one tank”. "
Wow. The body copy is simply terrible.
needs more body panel gap.
Ferrari is not capitalized twice in this ad. It should be capitalized. Very odd. 
"I've never been into Ferraris.  The ad targeted for me would have the tagline, ""Yesterday, you were happy with a Prius."""
You want the internet to read?!?!
[deleted]
"The credibility is shot because you just compared a Tesla to a Rolls Royce. Clearly you've never sat in a Rolls Royce-the materials in a 2005 Phantom are nicer (as is the fit and finish) than any brand new Tesla. They're quieter, more comfortable, and far more luxurious than anything Tesla has ever offered. "
"Yea, I'd still take a Ferrari over any Tesla. The Tesla isn't even remotely comparable to a Rolls Royce. lol It's a neat concept, I just think it's a little too over-the-top fanboyish for me."
"The main difference is that I doubt anyone thought that about a VW.... A Model S/3/X, on the other hand....."
This is much better. 
"The header could be ""another golf cart"" ;) 
All in all - I love your concept :)"
"Only one gripe, and it's this part

> don't just think electric

Yes, think electric, because electric is what makes it all possible. Electric is what makes a Tesla defeat supercars on the quarter mile without even trying. Electric is what gives it a traction control that makes snow feel like dry asphalt, electric is what makes it a center of mass rival a Ferrari, electric is what makes it unlikely to have an accident _even without a computer to steer away from it_ while allowing said computer to exist in the first place. Electric is why it doesn't have an engine that ends up in your lap when you hit a pole at 120 km/h, so electric is why you walk away with just a broken ankle instead of a broken skull and spine. Electric is why you'll never have to visit a gas station on your daily commute again, you just charge it at home like a cell phone. And electric is why it won't cost a fortune to maintain because it needs no oil changes, barely uses the brake pads (in exchange it just recharges itself), and doesn't have a million moving pieces in an engine, because, well, it doesn't need an engine.

Yes, think electric. Think convenient. Think powerful. And yes, green too, but you don't buy a car for the planet. You buy it for yourself, and that's why you think electric."
I read this as John Hamm.

"“***Emissions Free***” - well in the immediacy of driving the vehicle, sure. Yet the bulk of the energy going to charging stations and to the manufacturing sites is going to be from fossil fuels (renewables are exciting, yet are inconsistent and therefore any Independent System Operator/ISO has to balance the energy sources on the grid). 

In addition, let’s consider the sourcing of battery material. Mining. Labor. Shipping. Manufacturing. How much fuel is consumed before the battery becomes functional? Any white papers on that anywhere? 

So electric is great and the motors offer remarkable torque and a quiet ride, yet electric vehicles are not “emissions free.” Let’s debunk that myth right now. 

Edit: 
As of 7:27 ET on 1/9/19, the roadster with the best mileage: Starman and roadster

“It has achieved a fuel economy of 3,505.3 miles per gallon (1,490.3 km/liter, 0.06710 liters/100 km), assuming 126,000 gallons of fuel.”

"Ah daaamn that's good copy. I'm sitting at school right now trying to rework this (and totally ditching our current assignment) and I'm so happy for all this great feedback on the text, I'm even learning a lot about Tesla and cars haha. However I don't want to completely take someone else's copy since it still kinda is an excersise for me to get better at writing.

Again, thank you!"
Elon Musk would like to know your location 
Yeah. Like a Model 3 is as nice as a 3 series BMW or an A4 or A5 but it's not a Ferrari.
"it should say 'yesterday you wanted a BMW' bc the bimmer can be a daily, but Ferraris are weekend toys mostly"
"For now, until the Roadster 2 comes out."
"I might have, until I drove one. It was nothing special, to be honest."
"Actually yes, people read them. As for modern ones, well... Internet?"
"A lot of them yeah, and I don't know, my guess would be that since there wasn't such a overflow of ads everywhere and the general climate was less hectic people read more ads then now. However you will still see long copy ads here and there, normally on strategic places such as on train and buses. It has its charm and people still like it."
"Modern design subscribes to KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Designers found beauty in simplicity. Marketers found that messages are more effective in simplicity.

Refer to Apple's historical marketing. Insanely effective.

Bonus reading: [Swiss Design](http://www.designishistory.com/home/swiss/)"
"As a marketing guy and copywriter, you've got to think in terms of populations, not in terms of your personal opinion.

For example, when 100 people see such an ad, maybe 30 or so will notice and read the headline (and the brand). Only 5 or 10 will read the copy. But with a readership of, say, a million, there're 50.000 readers of the body text.

However, execution is critical. OP missed a big opportunity here I believe. Imaging such an ad running in a newspaper in Carlifornia with the headline:

""Yesterday, everybody wanted a BMW.""

I think, you'd have the audience you'd want as Tesla's marketing guy. And yes, lots of people would read the body copy."
"Ahh, I'm sorry. English is not my first language. I put it through Grammarly and thought that solved most of the issues. If you have time it would be great if you could point out the main flaws and I will correct it :)

Thank you! "
"Oh really, that's very interesting. If you don't mind I would love to know his and the company's name!"
"Sorry to hear that, I'm far from a copywriter but I thought it would be fun to try :)"
Yeah... Oof.
"I know, The copy is being remade atm"
"Also, it could totally be a day where you just posted old school car adds, or something because I love those... or does anyone know of a subreddit like it?"
David Ogilvy would have loved it. 
Yes!
That's brilliant!
"Would be cool to take this concept and make a small film out if it, shot on super-8 of course"
I have no idea but I'll definitely check out that name and YouTube channel! Thank you for the tip!
Thank you :)
"You are very right, although the format was used well into the 90s"
Thank you!
"The problem was and still is adoption to some degree. The Prius is as much to blame for the image as anything. Hybrid technology was created to save fuel when gas prices were creeping into insane territories and the cars developed for that purpose were not and are not sexy. Musk made electric cars sexy which is why it works, but not everyone can afford a $40-150k electric luxury vehicle with limited options for refueling in many parts of the country. Most hybrids come with big sacrifices like reduced trunk and gas tank capacity, horrible styling, as well as added cost and complexity. Until those things are remedied the average buyer ain’t interested."
Haha me too!
Bitmap in Photoshop :)
"Good suggestion, I don't know anything about cars, or spelling for that matter haha. I just had an idea for a design and just googled 'Tesla Car'. I'm planning on doing a few more of these which will be way better because all of these great tips and suggestions I've gotten from you guys :)"
"That's fantastic, do you mind if I save that for future fake ads for Tesla? I'll credit you if I use it :)"
Working on a remake fixing all the typos. I suck at spelling and double-checking my stuff haha
"They new version of this ad that I'm working on will feature a model S, don't worry"
My first 1000 upvotes too! I am a very happy man haha. Appreciate and love all of you ❤️
"I'm reworking the copy, once it's all nice and done I'll share the file for anyone to use!"
Thank you! I will!
Lol ok i know
I used the exact same spacing as an original after from Volkswagen! :) 
Ooh that's very smart actually! 
"Ahhh that's amazing!! I really like the concept. I'm planning on doing a few more of these, your copy definitely gave me some ideas for how those could go. "
"Honestly I don't know much at all about Tesla or cars, I just had an idea about how cool it would be to make an ad based on an old car ad but for a modern car. Ive gotten a lot of feedback and I've now rewritten the text, the new version won't contain any of the comparisons lol, and it's a lot better."
"I can’t afford the cost of ownership of a Ferrari. I’ve owned exotics and know better than to buy a Ferrari.  If someone gave me a Ferrari, I’d sell it and use the proceeds toward a Tesla.  "
"Let’s just list out things here.

Tesla advantages:
Faster, quieter, more fuel efficient, safer, more reliable, smarter.

Rolls Royce Advantages:
More expensive."
"Thank you! I was thinking about something like that, or even riffing on that, saying something like ""Not Your Dad's Electric Golf Cart.""

It reminds me of some of the old ad campaigns that I loved as a child, my favorite being the Chevy Impala SS -- [""Lord Vader, your car is ready.""](https://i.imgur.com/QWhTnBX.jpg ""three color choices: black, black, or black."")"
"That's why I said don't *just* think electric. Connotation being that you're thinking electric, and other things too. :) "
My work here is done. 
"Yeah, the only way you can do worse than a combustion vehicle is to use a much worse fuel source, for example coal. It does happen in strange places like West Virginia, but over time we'll be able to move away from it, and a notable advantage of electric cars is that they can be part of the change. Otherwise, the turbine design of a power plant is way more efficient than a combustion engine, so much so that even with all the losses of transportation and storage EVs still get more mileage out of the same amount of fuel burned at a power plant than you would get with an ICE car. And that's without accounting for the non-zero emissions of transporting gas, storage might be easier but getting it to the right place is a lot worse than electricity.

As for the production cost, do you think engines are farted into existence by unicorns? An ICE car is vastly more complex than its electric counterpart and requires a lot more specifically made parts, resulting in a considerably larger supply chain and simply more elaborate manufacturing, all of which with their own carbon footprint.

This is a common myth people use to spread FUD about electric vehicles while conveniently forgetting all the infrastructure required to create, refuel, and operate combustion cars. Yes, the electric car industry has its own emissions, but so does the car industry in general, if there were any whitepaper to be made about it it would be one which compares the two, not one that analyzes the former in isolation, else it would be simply stating the obvious."
"Mind your contractions... there are several cases of ""thats"" when it should be ""that's"" if you mean ""that is"" and ""its"" when it should be ""it's"" when you mean ""it is"""

theres more than one though
MadMen getting paid by the word...
"Right on. 

In advertising we are taught that the average attention span in 1980 was 20 minutes. Today it is 7 seconds. Why do you think that is? Well, think of the distractions you had in 1980. You'd come home, read the newspaper. Maybe watch the news. Someone might call the landline home phone. Someone might come to the door to sell magazine subscriptions. That was it. So attention spans were much longer. "
"Kind of, the Volkswagen campaign was not an average ad design at all though. That’s why it’s so famous. It broke almost all of the conventions at the time."
"""People used to laugh at electric cars. 'It's not a real car' they would say. We understand your doubts - well, we understand you had doubts yesterday. Electric cars were never as fast nor have they ever been as visually appealing as their ancestors. Today, Tesla succeeds in changing those stigmas.""

Gotta go to work, but I made some changes to the first paragraph. 

Also, leading into the second paragraph. Elon has been quoted saying, ""We're not in the business of making slow cars."" I believe it was in response to the lower price Model 3 having a decent 0-60 time.

Also if you open a doc in Microsoft Word and change the language to English it should spellcheck for you.

Could get improvements but I found it cool for a fan ad. 
"Yeah great first attempt, but the copy definitely needs work.  Also, I think it would be okay to use a red Model 3 in full color.  It may also play into your “Ferrari” message."
"Work on it a bit more, it has a lot of potential. Maybe someone in /r/creative writing might be able to help."
"Agree that the copy needs tuned but the overall design and concept is amazing. Hits home because I wanted a Ferrari my whole life and now you could trade me one for my model 3

"In reality, I was happy with a Prius until I got obsessed with the Volt.  So I went from Prius (hybrid), to Volt (plug-in hybrid), to Model 3 (plug-in EV).  But ""Prius"" sounds better and has more recognition."
Oh thank you! I'm glad you liked it :)

"I wouldn't own an *older* Ferrari, late model ones are much better reliability-wise. I'd still probably prefer a Lamborghini though. Actually I take that back, if it were a 430 scud you wouldn't ever get me out of the drivers seat."

"A Tesla is not quieter than a Rolls Royce. Have you ever been in a Rolls? Shit there are cars common people can buy that are quieter than a Tesla. No one buys a Rolls Royce to go fast, or fuel efficency, they weigh nearly 6k lbs lol. What are you judging the ""safer"" on? Have some facts to back up those claims? Because it sure as shit hasn't ever been tested by the NHTSA. These are half million hyper-luxury cars, to think Tesla can compete is laughable. But sure, yea, some Teslas are faster."
"You actually can't do worse than an ICE with a Tesla, even with a 100% coal mix. There's a video from Engineering Explained on YouTube that goes into the specifics, and if I recall correctly, a Tesla beats the emissions of a Prius after at most 4 years of ownership, even in West Virginia. And that's including the emissions cost of manufacturing the battery pack / engine, which heavily favors the ICE car."
"Cheers! I'm a first year graphic design student who just the other week found an interest in copywriting.

"Are there? This one was red - what other ones are there? (yea, I'm trolling you, sorry). TBH, I don't know the exact model I drove, and the ""knob on the steering wheel"" settings were neutered, but even if they hadn't been it just wasn't doing it for me. Your mileage may vary. "
"Yup. I'm going off my design history classes from college here, but as I recall the reaction to their campaign was basically ""all that wasted space!! half the page is white!! Plain sans serif font?? So bland!!"".

This was part of the beggining of ""KISS"". It wasn't a waste of space, or bland. It drew the viewers eyes and got the message across. Those ornate ads with fanciful typefaces and way too much copy... it was too busy and you would retain nothing if you weren't purposely stopping to read the ad."
"I love you. Yeah I wrote the entire thing in Photoshop, might need to step up my writing game but this is great practise, actually writing stuff that is haha.

Damn, honestly I don't know much about Tesla, I just had an idea to make new ads based on old ones, did not anticipate that anyone would be bothered to read the copy (which turned out not to be the case, I'll work on it a ton more in the future) .

Reworking the copy right now based on your feedback. Thank you! Really appreciate it.
"That is very kind of you! I'm redoing the copy right now to be a lot better (still keeping the 'yesterday you wanted a Ferrari'), planning on making a little series of Tesla ads in the style of Volkswagen, Porsche and Volvo, when done I will publish it elsewhere than Reddit and see if it can get some traction :)"
"We are working on a little series of these ads, I'll see if I can make some in color :) thank you for the feedback!"
"Ah, i don't know anything about Tesla or cars haha"
I would be more than happy to share the file with anyone who wants to print it once it's done!
My only first-hand experience is with newer ones. 
"The Ferrari warranty, while it is the gold standard among exotic warranties, doesn't cover the cost of driving a Ferrari.  It doesn't cover bending your delicate, fragile, light weight tie rods, it doesn't cover cracked low-to-the-ground spoilers and bumpers from potholes and parking curbs, it doesn't cover the fragile wheels, it doesn't cover paint scratches and rock chips, and it doesn't cover the regular wear and tear of driving a very lightweight and fragile car which depreciates at a rate of $10 per mile... which it also doesn't cover.

Scheduled maintenance might be the cheapest part of owning a Ferrari.  Everything else is... well, it's too expensive for me.  "
Tesla engines don’t make noise. Tesla mode S received 5 stars in every crash test performed and is the only car to do so. I doubt rolls Royce does that. Tesla was legitimately the safest car ever tested. Rolls Royce a are nice and have nicer leather.
"Is English a second language? To work in copywriting, you must have impeccable grammar and spelling. I'd suggest https://www.englishgrammar101.com/ to familiarize yourself.

It would awesome if you could release these in some open way for others to use. I would totally get some printed and hand out just to get the conversation going in my smallish town. 
Aw that's what I came here for. Thanks so much. 
">Tesla engines don’t make noise. 

They are motors, and yes, they do. Who cares how much noise a motor makes when you can't hear shit inside the cabin? You realize you are comparing what is literally one of the most quiet cars in the world, to a Tesla and saying the Tesla is quieter. It's not. Rolls Royce is all about occupant comfort, not speed, not efficiency. Quiet and glass ride quality, they do it exceptionally well.

Seriously find a way to take a ride in one, it's surreal. 

>Tesla mode S received 5 stars in every crash test performed and is the only car to do so. 

That's not true. Other cars have perfect 5 star ratings. Also, the Model S didn't do hot on the IIHS small overlap test, and failed to meet ""Top safety pick"" standards. Safest car in the world... Can't make top safety pick... Hmm.

Let's look at other perfect 5 star cars:

2018 Volvo S60I: https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2018/VOLVO/S60I/4%252520DR/FWD#safety-ratings-rollover

2016 Volvo S60: https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2016/VOLVO/S60/4%252520DR/FWD

And these are just a few I found in 2 minutes.

>Rolls Royce a are nice and have nicer leather.

It's abundantly clear you've never been in one."
"Yes it is, thank you for the tip! I'm actually pursuing a degree in graphic design, I don't want to work as a copywriter but it's always fun to try new things.

And thank you once again! "

"They rate cars 5 stars even when they get a few 4 star test. Tesla received 5 stars in every category.

"You didn't even look at the links I sent. These aren't cars that got 4s in some categories and overal rated at 5. These are cars that literally rated a 5 in EVERY category. How about that non-rated top safety pick for the ""world's safest car?""

Even your article says that Tesla doesn't stand alone. 

""Many cars achieve an overall 5-star rating, but it is **a little more rare** for cars to get 5 stars in every category tested by NHTSA.""

Anyone have a picture of what it looked like a few years ago before they put the shielding on the bottom following a fire?
It's like they made a life-sized Hot Wheels car.
You guys aren't doing daily inspections of the undercarriage using a mirror? Do you even care about your car? Personally I fly a drone upside down under the car to capture footage and stream it to my phone. 
"“Sir, we’ve done a complimentary inspection and found that you need the  driveshaft universal joints greased, exhaust replaced,  new fuel lines, and transmission seals. We really don’t recommend driving the car before these critical repairs are completed. “"
Riveting.
"Not gonna lie, I started looking at the cars in the back of the room thinking, “this is a weird way to show an undercarria.... OH!”

So, I guess I think it looks like a roof of a shop. Weird.

Model 3’s have plastic underbody panels
Yup seen that in Rich Rebuilds YouTube channel. All angles of a Tesla is shown inside and out.
Ah...thanks for this!  I guess I'm a bit more comfortable getting an under carriage wash.

Then what the hell is this piece of fabric hanging off the undercarriage of my model 3??

Honestly I was curious. Thanks.

"Doood, how about a NSFW tag!?! I started jerkin off right in the middle of a meeting!"
"How badly does hitting dips affect your under carriage? I hit a dip once that had no signs or warnings... Definitely heard the scrape. I slowed down to 30 MPH but still heard it as I'm guessing my car still shifted forward during breaking. 

The only thing I saw was some plastic shredding on the bottom, but not much. 
"
You know what really grinds my gears?  Tesla's CPO pictures NEVER include an undercarriage picture.  I want to see the bottom side of the bumper and how many times they've belly-bumped it on speed bumps!
That flat undercarriage alone is responsible for a good chunk of the car's aerodynamic performance as it greatly reduces drag.
The only reason I knew that Tesla’s were like that on the bottom was because of the show Bojack Horseman. 
How do you drop the oil pan?
Same as Barbie's.

Have they still got the same strip of titanium armour installed in the Model 3? The one that was fitted to the Model S after the first fire? (not the identical part of course)

Oh yes a little of “how’s your father”.

"If you’re going to hit something in the road (dip, etc), you should brake hard right up until you get to it then you should let off the brake pedal. This will raise the ride height a bit and decreases the impact force on the front suspension of whatever you’re about to hit. "

Quick battery swap is never going to be a thing. Charging speeds is where the innovation will be pushed.

Thanks! Didn’t realize how small the addition was. For some reason I assumed it was the entire battery. 
"Thanks for the picture. Every S I’ve seen had it, thought it was standard. "
Tesla added to all vehicles a shield on the bottom to protect the battery from road debris following an event a few years ago where the battery was punctured while being driven due to an object on the road. I’m just curious to know what the bottom looked like before they added the plate. AFAIK all cars were retrofitted to have the plate. 
Tesla added a titanium shield to the battery pack a few years ago and retrofitted the original ones.

I wonder if it was the same chunk of concrete."
Always assume that someone is trying to kill you. Otherwise that's how they get you so easily.

Crusher bar pulverizers anything problematic.
it is now.
"For anyone wondering, it wasn't like the S drove over a 2x4, the dude hit a trailer hitch at interstate speeds. It basically plowed one end into the ground pavement and turned the hitch into a pike, which in turn exerted an incredible amount (dozens of tons) of force on the pack. I believe the rear wheels actually went airborne. Think of when the Joker flips that semi truck in the Dark Knight, but less dramatic (obviously). The guy was completely fine. The pack was destroyed, and eventually caught fire. 

The plate just deflected debris away from the car to make sure situations like that can't happen again."
What year did they start adding this?
I'm sure this was better in the long run but the worst part about this change is that it removed the \~60-second replacement of fully charged batteries rather than just supercharging

Be sure to have service check the EPS manifold and phase couplings at the plasma junctions. Sometimes they get out of whack.

Ha!
No. The titanium plate is at the front of the pack and not actually visible in this photo. It’s under the silver extruded aluminum piece. The pack case is aluminum and steel. 
I am referring to the pucks that should be used where the lift contacts the frame of the car. The round pucks on the lift are contacting the battery case and no doubt causing damage. You are supposed to use spacers to make sure that doesn't happen.

Oh my god that's amazing 
"These tiles looked great on the Set of Desperate Housewives!!! 
(But we’re taken down because they were two fictional for the show....jk)
There are apparently almost DOZENS of installations by now.  
NY did give Elon almost $1 billion to manufactured them, but apparently that wasn’t enough motivation (according to sources) to get him to even visit the plant one time in the past year.  
Musk originally unveiled the tiles (non-functioning props) on the set of desperate housewives in 2016.  
In a 2018 CNBC article: 
""We now have several hundred homes with the Solar Roof on them, and that's going well. It takes a while to just confirm that the Solar Roof is going to last for 30 years and all the details work out,"" Musk said on Tesla's Q2 earnings call in August.
Followed by editor-
Correction: When Elon Musk referred to ""hundreds"" of solar roofs being installed, Tesla later clarified that his number included roofs that were ordered or partly installed. Musk himself did not clarify the statement. 

Elon is the top snake oil salesmen, perhaps of all time!

My sides....

"Wow, cutting and edging each opening must be a pain. "
It’s your money do whatever you want to with it.  
what am i supposed to see?
They aren't comparable to asphalt shingles.  One of my neighbors just spent 40k on slate shingles - that is the competition. 
"Never mind comparing pricing to regular shingles, they cost more than the combined cost of new solar and new roof."
">	Hopefully they can get the cost down closer to regular singles.

They won’t. It’s not a competitor to shingles. J don’t know why people make the comparison. Tesla doesn’t call them shingles and has specifically said they are a competitor to slate and terracotta roofs.

It’s a premium product. So unless you are thinking about those types of roofs don’t bother"
So you want a 50+ year glass roof that also provides electricity for the price of a shingle roof that lasts ~20 years? 
I am in the market but it is twice the cost. 
Might happen later? Probably different contractor.
"I was gonna say, gonna spend 100k on shingles, but I'm gonna stick with my 80% furnace. "
My thoughts exactly. Perhaps that’s phase two...
"Shingles are not in the same league as tile.  I doubt you'll get tile for anything less than $1,000/square installed (but probably closer to $1,500).

A few friends have had someone come out to do the initial inspection, none have been given a final number yet, but they all said the initial range was $60k-$90k (before incentives).  I don't know the exact size of their roofs, but pretty large homes with attached 2 car garages, so probably 35-45 squares."
"Not really comparable. Shingles will always be miles cheaper. This is an option for those who want a slate roof.

Edit: slate roof is maybe $1500-$2000 a square vs $2150 a square for tesla"
Square ... what? meter?
"You got ripped off, buddy."
"they will be easier to upgrade as technology changes.  Being stuck with a roof for 30 years, means you arent innovating or adopting any new tech.  You are literally frozen, technologically speaking"
Ron Howard voice: They won't.
because having thousands of separate installations is such a great money saving idea...   /s
Wire management is done under the tiles above the tar paper/ plywood 
How slippery are they?
"How often do you stand on your roof now...? Though I actually help make the tiles, you can stand on them. I believe there's a video floating around the internet of a fire department training what to do in a fire with these on the house and they walk around on it just fine (although slightly awkwardly because they threw a ladder on it and are stepping in the holes.) And they're actually pretty grippy if the soles of your shoes are a little soft. "
I don’t know if solar panel technology ever had a use case for people standing on them
"They're very secure, but Tesla recommends a sort of sticky carped pad underfoot if you go up there.. You can walk on the ones that have solar, but not the glass ones. In general, Tesla asks you to get in touch with them before you allow someone to go on the solar roof. "
you cannot walk on them. there was a first responder video a while back showing the firemen smashing the panels to make a walking path.
"They should be stronger than the tile alternative.  But as the other response says, how slippery they are might be an issue.  "
Yes.
They can withstand large size hail. 
how often do you see residential installation of regular solar panels in WI?
kWh ;-)
Where at? I pay 12 in NJ
"Jeez, it's 42 cents down under"
And how much does a solar system + new roof + batteries costs?
Yes you can walk on it
"If you had a slate roof, you wouldn’t walk on it either."
"There is a thing called ""rain"""
With lots of Windex!
Hose
"I’d like to know this, and can you walk on them?

I would think washing them may be relatively easy, spray them with a bio friendly cleaner right before it rains?"
"The tar on the one for the big appliance, probably an 80% furnace looks fresh, I'm hoping they just aren't done, because that PVC one is basically just a hole in your roof, and the further one wasn't tarred at all."
"Yeah -- notice there are no dormers on this roof. Not even a hip roof, just a standard gabled roof."
"Each shingle is an individual mini solar panel. You're supposed to see what looks like a pretty typical (albeit a bit extra shiny) roof that actually generates electricity for the house upon which it sits. These replace the huge solar panels that cover most of a traditional roof.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sfwDyiPTdU) is of the unveil a couple of years ago."
[deleted]
Do you have numbers?  They were supposed to cost the same as or less than a new roof.
"The glass tiles have a lifetime warranty against damage, the weatherproofing has a 30 year warranty, and a 30 year warranty for energy production. Where I live, getting a 30 year roof installed is a rough estimate of $15k, and may increase depending on disposal fees, crew size, and local market price gouging.

To install a 12.5kW panel system on my roof, which would cover around 100% of my monthly usage at peak output and require an estimated 900 sq. ft., or about 42 300W panels. That system would have an extremely roughly estimated cost of $34,000 before any incentives. Again, costs will climb with crew, location, panel quality, additional required equipment, and so on.

So I could pretty easily see a new roof plus panels costing around $50k for my particular home and needs. Tesla's solar roof estimator, when populated with the same values, says a roof would cost $84,800 with 50% of the roof generating power, which is about right given my roof's direction and Google's solar data. Obviously I have no idea what the energy output would be, because Tesla doesn't publish that data.

The Tesla estimator also says a traditional roof would be about $16000, so their guesstimate isn't far off from my own. Certainly the solar roof is more expensive, there's just no getting around that. It's more competitive if I install a metal seam roof, which I estimate starts around $40k. At that point, the metal roof plus panels is around $5,000 more, so the buyer could really go either way in my opinion. If I were to have a slate roof installed (I would never, I'm in New England), the roof alone would start around $65k, which makes it completely not competitive with the solar roof.

So, comparing a premium roof with premium designer materials to a Solar Roof sways the equation strongly toward the solar option, because you won't have to cut and modify the delicate slate or tile. For metal roofs, the solar roofing option has a slight cost advantage, so generation capabilities would probably play a more important role in the decision. With a traditional asphalt shingle roof, the solar roofing is not price competitive to shingle + panel installations. But, my _personal_ preference is for solar roof because of the aesthetics and my perceived potential resale value. The next buyer doesn't have to like solar and the look of panels to benefit, so I don't rely on their tastes to market the home to them."
"I said closer, not price comparable. I fully expect a premium over normal roofing materials."
Architectural shingles often have 40+ year life times.  This isn't a crappy three tab roof he's comparing against.
You really don't need a plumber to replace the tired looking B-vent and extend the PVC to the proper height. It's handyman type work that a roofing company can handle.
Na. Those need to be replaced at install. Ask the surrounding panels would need to be pulled up now. 
No phase two. 
"Hmm I wonder if the incentives would apply to the whole roofing cost, or just the tiles that are actually solar (plus the inverter etc)?"
"Wait, are we talking 1000$/square foot!? Is that the going rate for a tile roof!? How!? Why!?"
I was quoted 85k and 115k for a 1400 SQ foot roof.
"Mine is 30 squares... that’s an insane amount of money for a roof, solar or not "
So is this more for looksies than it is anything else? Like even with non-asphalt shingles...$90k for a roof...I mean shit.
One roofing square is equal to 100 square feet.
"You have no idea where I am, what my roofline looks like, or what other work was included. Thanks for the input."
Solar panels have 20-year warranties. I don’t think most people will want to upgrade them very often.
"You are frozen until the efficiency gains of replacing the roof with new technology exceed the cost of replacing it minus its net present value.  Under your theory, we should never buy anything because something new and better could be just around the corner.

&#x200B;

If the roof is a good economic proposition now then it will continue to be a good economic proposition barring a sudden and highly unlikely decline in energy costs."
"That would only be true if 100% of all homes bought solar tile roofing all at the same time. There's no way that would ever happen, so solar innovations can always be deployed, and companies could always be developing them. 

One person's house might be stagnant for 30 years but there are 126.22 million houses in the US alone, and the *vast* majority of them don't have any solar. It's a totally new, unsaturated market. 

Just like Tesla Model S cars were intended for wealthy people, with cheaper versions (Model 3) coming later, it's entirely possible a cheaper alternative to these slate-replacement solar tiles gets invented. Especially if you're thinking in chunks of 30 years. I doubt we'll get through the 2020s before cheaper solar tiles are available to a much wider market (ie not just the wealthy), let alone the 2040s."
"It's unlikely that you would be replacing them any time soon anyway, as your money would be better spent upgrading something else on your property.  It will be good enough for the foreseeable future.

&#x200B;"
"getting your solar built into your roof is like getting a house made with a 50-inch plasma screen built into the wall in 2005.

Our getting a toaster built into a kitchen. 

Some things are just better modular. "
If there is a premium on land and you include transmission losses then yes it is a great money saving idea.
"This is exactly one of Tesla's proposed projects in Australia, a virtual power plant with solar panels and powerpacks in thousands of homes.  I believe it is intended to aid low income families struggling with expensive electricity prices, and saves the government/utilities money by not having to upgrade inadequate power infrastructure and build more expensive power plants.

Utility scale solar is definitely efficient, but that doesn't mean there isn't also a role for localized solar."
"I'd be curious how easily they shed snow, slippery could be a good thing \[obviously in a snowy area, the annual generation on these would be less\]"
What is weight per square?
Then making your roof out of them is just a big fuck you to literally any HVAC or Plumber tradesmen. 
You can walk on them without breaking them. As I recall the firemen removed the tiles when using the roof as an access point. They did seem pretty slippery though :/
"That rules out use in Florida. 

Not hurricane rated"
What office are you out of? 
"Depends on location. You'll find them scattered throughout areas such as Madison, but I also question their efficiency in a climate in the Upper Midwest where you have decreased sunlight for 5 months out the year."
Central PA
I pay 11 in CT and that's good for the area.
me a than these shingles plus batteries plus whatever else these shingles require.
"I do keep forgetting that americans change their roofs all the time because they use the cheapest stuff possible.

So how much does a 30 year year roof cost and a normal system? Batteries not needed obviously. Although ... in the us some people don't have guaranteed rates they get for their solar kWh from the utility, right? "
Yes you can walk on a flat tile roof. I do it all the time to install 
"not in Arizona.... the average is 21 days of rain a year.  And that can bring more dust with it. 

when you have dust blowing around year round, these sporadic rain days (clustered in a 3-4 week period) wont keep the panels clear year round, dick!

the are is perfect for solar implementation, as well as domestic  battery storage, but there are very real environmental issues that this area brings. "
"seriously though. solar maintenance includes cleaning the panels.  This time it is your roof.  I have no idea how one would do this, efficiently without wasting a lot of water. 

In NASA solar panels they use ionic emitters to dust off the panels, but they are designed with this in mind. I doubt tesla panels have a feature like this. 
"
I am more thinking of living in the Desert.  Where natural rain is maybe 15 days a year.... but dust is persistent. 
There is still safety gear on the roof so I will give them the benefit of the doubt.
Hey you didn’t define the variable for shingles!
Did you just assume my variable?
Still not even close. New roof + panels is 33% cheaper than solar shingles.
"`if solarshingles < (shingles + solarpanels + lifetimecost):` 

`print(""Solar shingles are cheaper."")` 

`else:` 

`print(""Solar shingles are not cheaper."")`"
Less than an equivalent roof - i.e. a slate roof. Not asphalt shingles. Slate is super expensive.
\*including energy savings
"Same as or less than the #1 super fancy top-of-the-line luxury roof.

Not same as or less than any realistic roof."
"Since it's tesla, that ""supposed to cost"" includes savings amortized over time like they do with ""fuel savings"" to make cars look cheaper.  

They should just list the cash price and no more, these cars sell themselves anyway."
"I went down this road. Their online calculator was way off the mark. It came in at 32k. I figured a new asphalt roof plus solar would cost me around 28k. I budgeted up to 40k just Incase the final estimate did come in high.

They have me a 2 quotes for various solar amounts plus a wall battery.  85k and 115k. 

I had to back out because that was way over the value for me. I'm getting my new roof and gutters put on this spring. The quote is 13k."

"Excellent breakdown. The folks who look at this as ""The Solar Roof is not competitive to Asphalt shingles, therefore it's too expensive"" are not rooted in the reality of how substantially better they are than traditional cheap roof tops.  
Traditional Shingles on average last less than 20 years. For most people that don't go out of their way to get a quality install, it's more likely 15 years or less. So for a lifetime warranty... power production... aesthetics... I'd say it is still compelling even for the large home that would otherwise do a quality asphalt install. Especially new home builds."
In that case it is comparable price wise to a slate roof. Last time I checked it around $1800 a square vs about $2150 a square. 
I think you can assume without stating it the cost will come down slowly like nearly everything in electronics or solar.
"But still someone else would be doing that job, so what their said still fits."
"A ""square"" of roof is 100sqft"
"That seems absurdly high compared to the numbers I was hearing.  

Is it a complicated roof?  Is the footprint of the home 1400sqft? Or is the roof material needed literally only 14 squares?  Finished attic? Dimensional lumber joists?  Heavy up needed?  I feel like there has to be some underlying issues going on there."
"A slate roof, plus solar, plus powerwalls."
"I mean, yeah, you're buying a premium roof for the looks/longevity, it's going to run $40k+.  This just gets you that, and a solar system, and battery storage for a premium price."
"$40/sqm seems not very expensive. That excludes labour, right? "
I've worked for a roofing company for 10 years. I know what 25 yr shingles go for. I know what types of homes use them. Excuse me I'll see myself out.
"depends if you own or lease.   that is always the dilemma. 

if leasing (and depending on the contract), you can swap em out as tech improves. 
"
preaching to the choir man.... 
"I wonder if these could be hydrophobically treated for the best of both worlds.   Slippery to water, which keeps it dry, so it's less slippery to feet."
Or anywhere that could have the occasional hailstorm
"Guess they’ll actually have to use a safety harness then, bummer."
"a co worker was telling me when he had an interview with tesla about solar roof on his home there were several feet of boarder area that they would not install the panels, only the glass tiles. he had said it was for fire code or something...   everything with the solar roof is hearsay so... take that as you will."
"Yeah, looks like Harrisburg is [8.2 cents per kWh](https://www.electricitylocal.com/states/pennsylvania/harrisburg/)  and where my parents live (around West Chester) its [12.9 cents per kWh](https://www.electricitylocal.com/states/pennsylvania/west-chester/) - what causes that crazy cost gradient between Central PA and Eastern PA?"
at what pitch do you feel comfortable walking on it? Not every trade company has a harness or a setup for walking on a really pitched roof. 
Do all the current roofs in Arizona have a bunch of dust on them?
"This isn't true. Solar panels in space need no cleaning whatsoever. NASA depends on wind to clean solar panels off the Mars rovers (""cleaning events""--Google it), rejecting other methods as too expensive and not worth it.

There is no need to clean roof panels barring extreme circumstances. Because we have wind and rain."
"I have rooftop solar panels. The manufacturer actually discourages you from actively cleaning. The miniscule benefit far outweighs the risk. If there geographic area received regular precipitation, it usually does away the need for actual cleaning. I have not cleaned mine and my output has not deteriorated. Also Nasa recommendations do not apply to  regular household use cases."
"Ionizers create ozone, why would you switch to a greener option just to negate the effects with the cleaning?"
I've had solar for 5 years and never cleaned them.  The occasional rain storm and snow sheeting off cleans them fine.  
I wouldn't do it during the day

Now I have a debilitating neurological condition due to a programming error... Great. AND it cost me $40k.

Classic Tesla. We will have a car under 50k and go 300 miles; just not the same one.
"I was quoted $72k (~$50k after rebates) for my roof for Tesla solar shingles, but it only cost me $14k for a new roof (lifetime warranty architectural shingles) and $28k for solar panels (25 year warranty, 10kw system) ($34k total after rebates, $16k less than solar shingles). Even with energy savings, they're not cost competitive yet."
"This is the right answer. It was always compared to a traditional roof, and with energy savings it is cheaper for some folks. For me, it is not.

Yeah. I find it highly misleading.
Seems like this is a solar product for the wealthy to feel good about having solar and helping the environment rather than the average solar demographic who wants an ROI. At least for now until economies of scale are achieved. 
"This tech is still in the introduction stage of a products life cycle. Only tech forward early adopters with excess money will get this right now. Its not marketing trickery because it's competing with slate and ceramic tiles, not shingles.

It's designed to look like a slate roof, so a slate roof comparison is called for. "
"To be fair, it seems like it probably would assuming no trees fall on it. Plus you'd never have to deal with replacing a roof ever again."
">Basically it was just bullshit.

"
It really wouldn't be someone else. In order to make sure there aren't any penetration points ask of the panels around the replaced vents would need to be removed. All of that work is done at install. 
"Anh, ok, that makes much more sense. Thanks you."
"That would likely include labor. And tear-off of the old shingles, disposal, all new material installed."
"I’ve never seen a lease upgrade the equipment, cite a source please.  Maybe a salesperson told you?  "
"Solar panel leases are not considered to be great financial decisions. If you have no choice but to lease, then sure, but given the choice, I think it’s beneficial to purchase a system and let it run until it dies. "

At tesla we wear harness on every roof. No matter the pitch. OSHA requires fall protection on anything over 6’ 
yup. on walls also.  pretty much any exterior surface will have a layer of dust on them year round.

Are you including installation costs in this?
"14k for asphalt shingles?  My entire new roof including tear off, replacing a lot of bad wood, adding a ridge vent, and buying the most expensive brand of asphalt architectural shingles and related/matching requirements came to less than 6k including labor. "
You are forgetting lifetime-costs & probability of damage
"Well, they were supposed to cost similar to a normal roof plus solar panels. "
"????
Tesla is a luxury good company. They make amazing, high margin products. They are the apple of the automotive and solar industry. And it's working for them very well, I have no idea why you would ever assume Tesla products would be cheap. There's plenty of cheap cars and solar panels."

Hmm.  I am hoping Gigafactory-2 will drop that significantly by the time I am ready for a new roof.
"I'm saving up.  I had a new house built three years ago and the last thing that I noticed after we signed our contract was that they didn't even use architectural shingles... and they would not budge... and then is a semi-custom home.  Kind of lame.  Anyhow, I will probably want to replace these things soon enough, so I am looking forward to this."
"> only cost me $14k for a new roof (lifetime warranty architectural shingles)

""Lifetime"" around here is until the next marble sized hailstorm, which is usually a few years. My last roof with architectural shingles lasted 2 years. My house isn't nice enough to drop $60k on a durable roof like slate or solar shingles.

"
"Curious, what did the online calculator originally quote you?"
Heh... Your quote is as much as my house cost. 
How long the shingles going to last you? 
$16k for less cosmetically intrusive look.  Not worth it I’m my opinion. 
Every new technology is more expensive until the production reaches a certain scale - just look at mobile phones in the early days. Also Solar panels on the roof look like shit honestly. Not to mention the mess to clean or do any roof work thats under the shingles.

"> It's designed to look like a slate roof, so a slate roof comparison is called for. 

It's not comparing to slate that people don't like; it's comparing to slate but talking as if they're comparing to asphalt.

Their claim was that it's comparable in price to a ""*normal*"" roof. (The exact quote from Elon at the launch was ""and actually have an installed cost that is less than a normal roof plus the cost of electricity."") It's not; a normal US roof is asphalt. If Elon had said ""an installed cost that is less than a *slate* roof"" or ""normal slate roof"", then no one would be complaining about it.

Even now their solar roof calculator gives you a figure like ""a traditional roof starts at about $xx/mo in comparison"", but again that's not saying what kind of ""traditional"" roof."
"Def not bullshit. People comparing it to a dimensional shingle asphalt roof are clueless. Compare it to a roof with similar lifespan, durability,etc like a slate roof and the Tesla solar roof is a no brainer. "
Not sure why you are being down voted (albeit by one person). $40 is definitely cheap but the labor would definitely be included in a price like that. 
"Solar city, Az.  they review every 5 years for new panel tech. (at least that was in their marketing material when I evaluated them in 2015."

My roof is everything you described and also cost around 14. East coast. Have been told by multiple local contractors that’s at or slightly below market rate. 
Similar to an *equivalent* roof - i.e. a slate roof. Not asphalt shingles. Slate is super expensive.
"I think you misunderstood. Tesla originally claimed they would produce a car that could go 300 miles and a car that would cost under 50k. And they did, a Model S 40kw that was about 50k, and a Model S 100kw that could go 300 miles. You need to watch them because they speak half truths sometimes, like in the instance of this solar roof. I know how much solar costs, and their pricing for the roof is ridiculous on a cost-per-kw basis.

thats always the tesla way first. make fancy high end sexy stuff that costs a lot and then bring it to the masses. 
Your city still allows the use of 3tab shingles?

"Tile roofs are common in new builds in Arizona, Nevada and Utah. New Mexico loves a flat roof, so they're special."
"Yes because this is the roof .5% of Americans will get, if that.

Eventually the price will come down and you’ll have affordable solar roofs for the everyday folk.

It’s just like the Model S and Model 3"

"i could have been lied to, who knows.  Until I see the final contract, its all vaporware
"
"It benefits the company more than the homeowner, so it could happen."
"Yea,  i did the math and a lease didnt make sense, so I didnt pursue it. Never got to a contract level read of this offer. 
 "
"that's off the mark. SolarCity didn't pay people to have Solar on the roof.   When a customer leases the system, the taxes and insurance liability goes to SC. Homeowner still pays the monthly bill for having solar on the roof. "
I’m using Inspire so my power gen is all wind power. My model 3 runs on wind :)
"Every time you wash your car, within 12 hours there's a layer of dust over it again? Nahhh. 

For those interested, just look at Google maps satellite layer and check out the rooftops across Arizona.. "
Haven't touched mine in [months](https://i.imgur.com/GrLTL4T.jpg). Some slight dust but nothing to write home about. If i could reach them i would lick one to find out the real dust layer action. /s
">seriously though. solar maintenance includes cleaning the panels.

Your words, not mine. Because they looked at tech that could be used to clean solar panels doesn't mean it was used, will be used, or is necessary, which is what you implied. NASA does not use ""ionic emitters"" on any operational solar panel anywhere. All solar panels in current use in space by NASA don't require cleaning, ever.

A rover managed to get enough sunlight on Mars, a planet much further from the sun and without rain, to last for nearly 15 years without any panel cleanings until a *planet wide* dust storm finally buried it (which an ""ionic emitter"" would not have helped with).

Barring extreme conditions that probably destroyed the panels anyway and are nearly unheard of (hurricanes and tornadoes dropping large amount of debris, volcanic eruptions that cover your house in feet of hot ash, major mudslides that cover the entire home), the average person does not need to clean their rooftop solar panels for the functional life of the panels, as the efficiency loss to the thin layer of dirt that manages to hang on to a smooth, pitched surface until the next rain storm is not worth the cost to have them cleaned."
[deleted]
I'm a contractor in the PNW and I actually got a little angry at how low of a price you just quoted. If I quoted $10k for a roof I'd be losing about $5k.
"Sounds like you need more flux, brah. "
[deleted]
The tesla way? What? That's like... most companies coming out with new technology. Tesla does not get to claim that because they've tried to do it once (and honestly haven't lived up to that promise yet either considering the $35k isn't available).

"I get the regional preference, ashphalt shingles probably don’t last well in 100 degree heat for weeks on end. Is new tile roof housing affordable or are builders just targeting the high end of the market? 
(In New England, builders gave up on the low end and middle of the market decades ago)"
Yes
You would have seen the final contact before the system was installed. That should have been clear
How does it benefit the company?
"Really? What's the point of Solar City then? You're sure they didn't lease the roofs from people to install their own system?

I thought they were doing something different than just leasing systems to people, who would ever take such kind of deal?"

we have different sources. 
"A year ago... $3500 for a 2500sf house with a gable front entrance. Lifetime warranty, GAF architectural shingles. Georgia. "
Half Greek and a coney please! - Michigander in Portland 
Colorado here. That's ridiculously low if you're buying Malarkey Legacy shingles. Maybe a tiny 10 sq roof? 
6.5k in NW Florida for 1500sqft dimensional shingles with labor
"Have you installed Tesla chargers for any of your buildings yet?  I’m curious how many people are like me, want a Tesla, but rent and don’t want to pay/can’t install a charger at work/home.

What would you do if a tenant requested it?"
electric car tech has been around for years but never took off because it wasnt sexy (and also a lot of lobbying from the automotive/gas industry). Same goes for solar panels and the idea that they arent aesthetically pleasing to a lot of people. Blending them into roof tiles solves that problem. Just my opinion. 
Crazy. Our city municipal code requires a minimum 110mph rated shingle. There's still quite a few that are grandfathered in around but all new roofs must meet that requirement. Granted 110mph is only a 4 nail application. 
"yes, but i never got that far in the purchase"
"If I sell ""power purchase agreements"" for residential rooftop solar. A crew sets up solar panels on your rooftop, and then you just buy the power at a set rate per kilowatt. If you buy it from us, it's 19 cents per kilowatt, and we never raise the price. Utilities in California charge 31 to 32 cents per kilowatt for electricity in the highest-cost tiers. 

Now, since doing that in 2013 with 200W panels I can go back to those same customers and offer them power at 17c per watt.  And then I install 400W panels (unisng 2019 tech) - which would have doubled my upside - if I didn't have to throw the customers a bone with a lower price.

So I get more power from your roof, and you get a lower price for power.

There is a dozen ways to do an agreement where you get panels and we both get money - but this is a common one.  the solar city plan."
"you leased the system at a  fixed rate that ideally would be less than your UB. The energy from the panels would go to the homeowner. SC never collected energy. They did, however, collect taxes, rebates and SRECs wherever applicable.  What reason would a company want to pay a homeowner to have their system and for what? to harvest energy? The system is grid-tied, i.e you have to have your electric on from the local utility. Any excess energy from the home goes through a bi-directional meter which feeds into the utility grid. The utility gives credit - but not to the solar panel provider but to whomever the electric customer is. "
"I'm not ignoring everyone else, I'm responding. Logically, having a layer of dust on your car 12 hours after you wash it every single time you wash it, and everyone experiencing the same thing doesn't make sense whatsoever. Natural wind movements would move the dust if any arose, at a bare minimum. To suggest that the entire state of Arizona experiences constant layers of dust on their home roofs is illogical as well. The panels would work fine. To answer the initial question also, get a ladder and a hose if you desperately need to.. but someone mentioned on another comment that you don't even really need to clean current panels anyway. Good chat nonetheless."
"Your ass is not a source you can pull from. I helped write embedded code used to control the Opportunity rover at JPL in the very early 2000s and there was no equipment on the thing for an ""ionic emitter"" to clean the panels.

There's really no use for ""cleaning"" panels outside of a rover on an arid planet like Mars because it's not necessary in a vacuum for satellites or probes. And why did we fund it for potential use on Mars? Because before Opportunity we did not realize that Martian winds would create cleaning events and thought without cleaning Opportunity would only run for maybe 90 days before the panels got blocked. Instead it ran for 15 years because it turns out it wasn't necessary to clean fine debris from solar panels on Mars--Martian weather does it for us just like it does on Earth.

The funding was dumped after that. You are citing research by Dr. Mazumder at BU that was funded by NASA via JPL using a 3 year grant but was never implemented by NASA. It works by an electrostatic field, not an ""ionic emitter."" The research did not even begin until after the Opportunity rover design was completed. It wasn't in-house NASA research. And when the funding dried up he tried to pitch it to the open market in 2010 (for large panel arrays on the ground in the desert), but that never amounted to much outside of a prototype or two because it's cheaper to just pay a guy to hose the panels down."
"That means nothing without knowing the exact roof area, shape, pitch, and like 30 other factors."
$6.5k wouldn't get you the tear off here.
"It’s a lot easier to get a nema 14-50 plug installed. Then it’s just a matter of mounting the wall connector. Only 40 amp max chart rate, but still solid enough. "
"I just ran a 10-30 RV cable to the carport with a Y adapter at the electric dryer. I use one or the other. 30A gets my commute in 6hrs. I'm home for 12 and it'll charge 0-100% in 12. An electric range outlet can get up to 29mph, nearly double the current I get from my charger. Am tenant."
"No one is going to want to pay for more power than they agreed upon unless the customer underestimates their usage, in which they would be the ones paying for the upgrade.  I would wager there isn’t one case of a company upgrading the working equipment in a lease.  "
"UB?

>They did, however, collect taxes, rebates and SRECs wherever applicable.

Because they owned the system and their customers were only renting it? 

>What reason would a company want to pay a homeowner to have their system and for what? to harvest energy? 

Obviously? 

>The system is grid-tied, i.e you have to have your electric on from the local utility.

Yes, obviously, to collect the money the utility pays for the electricity.

"
"my sources were at ARC and JSC also in the 2000s.  Much earlier than the work from Masumder.  thanks for the update. last I heard it was being evaluated for use on rovers.  glad to be corrected. 

I dumbed down ionic winds from electrostatic fields. since i didnt feel like explaining it in depth here. But if we are to be technical about nasa tech in a tesla forum, I can do so. "
[deleted]
"I disagree.  I have plenty of customers who want to buy 30,000kwh annually but I can only harvest 10,000kwh from their roof. If the tech doubles again I will 100% go back to them"
"Not if it’s going to a 14-50 plug.  You’ll cause a fire. I was suggesting this for those who might be renting or, for whatever other reason, can’t install a permanent wall connector but a standard plug might be ok. "
[deleted]
"Very true. A 50 amp breaker for the plug, later to be swapped out with 100 amp breaker, as proposed, would be fine so long as the cabling is pulled with the 100 amp breaker in mind (3 gauge for 10p amp breaker / 80 amp pull vs typical 6 for 50 amp breaker / 40 amp pull). 

Another thing to consider is the panel the breaker is sitting in. Older houses tend to have 100 amp panels.  Might not be as big of an issue anymore, but something to double check. “Future proofing” could turn out to be quite expensive without confirming the scenario. 

It’s all good so long as everyone keeps this stuff in mind - details matter with high voltage. "
I never realized how weird it was seeing a car with a frozen hood (frunk?). Every IC car just melts that away
"Ok... I really like the idea with the tennis ball! Seen many attempts to solve the problem of ""how far forward do I need to drive in my garage?"", but this one seems the best and simplest I've seen, yet!"

I had my first run in with a serious snow storm last night and I was a little nervous having the RWD version with all seasons. I am happy to report that the Model 3 is the best handling car I have ever driven in the snow. I would easily take this car over my wife's AWD SUV. I cannot sing enough praises about this amazing car! 😁
Hows the regen in that weather?
Is that tennis ball a notice that once it hits the glass you're in a perfect spot to park ? 🤣
I see the tennis ball you gave him to chase with
How’d the autopilot do?
"Needs headlight heaters, though. LED and HID don't put out much heat."
Are the headlights heated?
"While the Tesla may make it through a snow storm, may want to fix up your house.  Appears you got a huge hole in your garage letting in the snow and ice onto your Tesla  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ "
Glad to see RWD still makes it through no problem. I live outside of Tahoe and the commute to Giga 1 on mornings that it snows is just brutal even with my truck that has AWD. 
"Now that a see this picture, I wonder how Tesla’s handle snow buildup while driving? Unlike regular cars, I don’t think they heat much on the hood due to lack of engine. Anyone here who owns one mind chipping in?"

"Many people say because they're battery powered cars that winter is their downfall.  But honestly, they are superb vehicles in the winter.  

What my friend does with his Model X is turn it on, don't start warming up the cab yet.  Let's the battery warmers do their job and once it's at an optimal level and the motors and battery - are now producing heat.  That ""waste heat"" is then used to heat the cabin.  It's a truly brilliant design!"
Oh now I'm interested... In ic cars the top of the snow on the hood melts because of the engine heat. Does the buildup get bad on Tesla's or fly right off? 
I hope it handles it better than the Model X that slammed into my Chitty Cruze this afternoon on the way home from the gym. 
CO?
how well does the autopilot work in the snow? someday going to get one.
Awd? I have rwd and it is a bit scary at times with the all weathers on. Am in Chicago with a snowstorm today and it’s fine but def. have to drive super careful
How are those summer tires holding up?
Do you have AWD or RWD? Curious how the RWD ones do in snow
"With all those sensors, you still need a tennis ball to park?"
What tire pressure you running?
AWD? Mine is RWD and I’m afraid to drive in the snow.
man imagine how evil it would be of a prank (just a prank bro!) if someone were to move that tennis ball forward about 3 feet.
"Q: How does the self-driving stuff handle in snow? 

Is it able to function safely?

On my Focus, the proximity sensor I use to back up is always blocked in by snow on the bumper."

I was like wait wait how in hell you have snow on your hood. And then ohh it’s a Tesla...
"This is great, awesome car man"

Are those just the stock all season wheels?   Do you need the tesla rims in order to install the aero wheels on your winter tires?
"OP, by looking at your concrete floor I'd suggest you get an epoxy coating or some other floor protection. Had to redo my entire garage after one crack caused too much damage (water / snow / salt)"
"Did the headlights melt the snow or did you have to wipe them off?

Just wondering because I hate the buildup on my 2015 Leaf."
Nice! Excited to put my model 3 through the snow!
Mmmmokay but how is that battery life fam?
"One of the first things that surprised me in winter (when coming from an ICE car) was to see the snow stay on the hood and not melt. No waste heat from an engine :-) ! 

Did you notice any fishtailing? I've noticed that in my AWD 3, even with winter tires. The traction control figures it out, but it still surprised me as even my old Subaru on all seasons never did that."
I'm glad you are safe. Thank god the Tesla defeated a snow storm. 
[deleted]
So are electric powered vehicles as hard to crank up in winters like fossil fueled ones? 
[deleted]
Saw a bunch of neckbeards bragging about how their combustion cars could make it through a snowstorm but a Tesla would die on the side of the road. Wish I had this pic at that time.. 
Good luck getting over a snow hill. That thing has no torque
"Haha, yep, it is strange"
"I was going to argue that some sports cars have engines in the mid/rear, but you don't see those out during snowy weather."
I’ve also just wondered why there’s now on the hood. Lol
I always assumed it was the wind and not the heat that got rid of the snow. TIL.
"A couple of months ago I got out kid the car and needed to adjust my shoe, so I leaned on the frunk with one hand. It really shocked me that it was so cold. I had never considered it."
My Honda never seems to.  Not sure if it is just too cold here or something else.
"Tbh I think that with a tesla since you get the parking alerts/distance, I don't think you even really need something like that any more.

E: haha I have a 15 year old car. I park by lining up with the garage door opener in the other bay."
"I have a couple of extra concrete slabs that the builders put under the downspouts on homes in my area. I put those in the garage so I know how far to back in. It gets the job done and they don’t move when the tires bump into them.

My grandmother did this in 1993 lol
"Lol, thanks! it's actually left over from my old ICE car, but it does work pretty well. I think I could get by without it now with the radar distance parking feature, but it's a habit. :-P"
"My grandfather was meticulous about his similar setup, but with a ping pong ball and a succession of Buick Rivieras over many years. 

As for me, I was too lazy to set up anything more complex than sorta eyeballing it as my door pillar passes some landmark (in this house it’s the laundry machines). Now that I have a Model 3 I can be more precise about it with the parking sensors. 

Being more precise about it reminds me of Grandpa. The only way it could be better is if the screen showed a ping pong ball on a string over the picture of the car.  "
"I just put some tape on the wall, and as soon as my mirror is past it then I'm good. I can't use the parking sensors because my tires would run over my cast iron waste pipe for my house and break it before I'd get close to the back wall, lol"
I just use my rear camera to see when I'm fully in the garage
Or u can use the parking assistant 
[deleted]
"I do it because I want to make sure I can close the door with my bike rack on, but I  didn't have any tennis balls, just a multi-colored stuffed fish. :)"
I back in and have a piece of brightly colored duct tape on the ground... When it's at bottom of my screen I stop
[deleted]
"I bought a laser parking assist kit and mounted it to the ceiling of our garage.  It wasn't terribly expensive - like $20-30 if I remember correctly, and it ties into the lift motor itself, so that the lasers are only on (and blinking) when the garage door light is on anyway.

Works really well.  Line it up to a spot on your dashboard, and then just park to that each time."
"You can do it with the reverse camera on any car, look at the garage door line and pull up until you're at your normal spot.  Also if your garage front wall isn't too far the parking sensors will give you distance numbers.  "
I like the irony of the tennis ball since he is driving a car that literally tells him down to the inch how close he is to the garage wall.
The ball *is* a cool idea - but simple board of wood on the floor?
You can also use the park distance and safely move up until it reads stop. Or sooner based on your needs.
"I use a spring loaded fishing bobber, easier to hang. "
Yah I do this do with wiffle balls 
"That is like the oldest way to do this, how is it a novel idea to so many people?"
...you’re.....you’re just now discovering this? Man when I was 5 every house I went used this old trick 
I've known people doing that for decades - is this really your first exposure to it?
I back into my garage (cuz my outlet is near the back for charging) and I just stuck a piece of masking tape on the ground. 
Noooooo :-( sorry to hear it
Lol I’m sorry for laughing but that’s funny. Have an upvote. 
No winter tires?
What makes you say the part about using the model 3 over the SUV? I would love to save some money on going awd but live in NJ where snow is a semi frequent occurrence
"welcome to the EV world, couple of yrs ago I bought a used 2013 Nissan Leaf with worst rated all season tires but i's amazed how it handles in snow (I live in Colorado). I drove Leaf instead of Subaru Forester in deep snow and made many people convince EV is damn good in snow."
"I don't know. I have a RWD Model 3 and briefly got stuck in about 3-4"" on flat ground back in a November snow. Wouldn't call that great. "
That's good to hear you had a positive experience. We just got back from a simple neighborhood drive to a friend's house and the car had a lot of trouble in simple turns. (RWD all seasons still). Probably going to be impossible to find decent snow tires in stock by now. Luckily I work from home fairly often so a daily commute is less likely in bad weather.
"Get winter tires, putz"
Good to know. I have RWD and often wondered if I shouldn't have got AWD for NYC winters.  This is promising. My only gripe now is I couldn't get the white  interior. 
Yay! 
Does the ground clearance affect it much?
How come there isn‘t any snow accumulation around the headlights?
"Do you have AP? If so, I guess it denied working with all the snow in front of the radar, right?"
"Regen is like a 1/3 of max, it got a little better as we drove, I haven't quite figured out why the cold weather reduces the capacity for it. It did help though not having to brake and just letting off the gas was normally enough"
Zero regen if you don’t preheat. Usually about 1/3 to 1/2 regen once it’s warmed up. 
Exactly what it is 😂
"I test drove a Model S a few weeks ago, the lane assist immediately disengaged when the lane lines aren't visible, same as on e.g. Volvo."
I drove my 3 in the snow last night. I couldn't even engage cruise because the radar was blocked with snow. After dinner I made sure to clear the front bumper and could then use cruise and autopilot. I didn't try using the autopilot because it could barely distinguish the lane lines from the snow.
Oh damn... I grew up in the south and this is my second winter on the east coast. I’ve never ever had to consider frozen headlights. So many things I’m learning the hard way right now. 
"No they are not, I had to pull over at one point to clear them :-/"
"Lol, good call 😁"
"Well, I had to stop once to clear the headlights, but Otherwise drove for about 40 mins in heavy snow no problem"
Not on the 3
"So, this storm had very heavy wet snow so it was sticking pretty well and i didn't have any trouble with it flying up and obscuring my vision. I had to stop at one point to wipe the head lights as they became covered and don't generate enough heat to clear themselves apparently. To be honest tho that is not unusual for most ICE cars to need a pit stop to clear wiper blades and headlights, and the blades stayed clear the whole time in the Tesla."
Sorry to hear that 😣
"No drive train technology can overcome the laws of physics. The Model X is a very heavy car, and if it has momentum, the first law of thermodynamics wins."
KC 😁
"Needs to be able to see the lines, and the radar doesn't work well in heavy snow. Wasn't able to use autopilot while I was driving."
"RWD, always good to be careful, but it handled really well"
"Haha, good enough so far! 😝 I know I need winter ones, but still recouping the big down payment and sales tax hit...."
"RWD, and it was fantastic"
"45 right now, seems to be working well"
"Nope! Mine is RWD! Don't be afraid 😁 to be honest I was nervous as well, but it handles the snow like a champ! Just keep your distance from all the other ICEs out there on the brink of control 😉"
iim nervous in my AWD even.  still not 100% sure if the tires that came with it are all weather and if they can even handle snow that well.
"Haha, I hope the Tesla would stop itself :-P I prolly don't even need it anymore, but it's left over from my old ICE."
"It wasn't working at all when the snow was really coming down. It was able to see the lines, but said the radar was disabled or something on the screen so it was able to use AP. Later in the evening the lines were totally obscured and it didn't offer me AP once on the way back. AP is good, but in conditions like that I don't think I would have wanted to use it anyways."
RWD
"Stock all seasons, and I don't think you have to use the Tesla rims if you want a second set"
"Thanks! I actually have an aging epoxy coating on there, it's just flat gray. I try to clean it regularly and fill the cracks because that water / salt does cause havoc"
I had to wipe them :-/
"Ya, I gave it a little gas in some bad areas just to see and the backend would come out a bit, but the computer immediately took over and corrected. I was taking all kinds of turns and corners with ease and I could feel the car adjusting. It was incredible"
"Yup, all the waste heat is lower down on the car cooling the batteries."
"You can definitely get the RWD Model 3 to fishtail on a snow-covered turn. You can even force it to on a wet road if you try hard enough. 

The traction control figures it out pretty quickly though, making it difficult to send the car sideways."
Thank Elon (and all the awesome people at Tesla) more like! :-P
Worst part is cruise control being disabled because the radar can't see!
"ya, definitely couldn't see the lines, but i bet to keep costs and energy usage down they don't want to electric heat everything even though it would be nice :-/ maybe the tesla truck will have that ;-)"
"haha, nope, just push a button on your phone :-P"
"I'd be more comfortable with an ICE that has the extra range and heat. I love my M3P, but it's not the end all car. A good SUV with a large tank would be ideal for a snow storm IMO."
"I drive my X on a dangerous mountain pass in one of the snowiest areas of CO to get to work. It’s absolutely amazing in the snow, so much better than my old truck. "
"Lol, definitely, the traction and stability control in this car is insane. I will say tho, the ground clearance isn't amazing, so pushing down the unplowed road near my house was dicey 😋"
"If your TM3 starts out like that, be sure to clean it off before you go high speeds. I didn’t, and was somewhat blinded by all the snow being blown off the hood and over the windshield. No different than a regular ICE that hasn’t warmed up, but just something to note :)

Aren’t they fun in the snow though?!"
"Well ...  
  
https://i.imgur.com/gKJU2Nk.jpg
"
my toyota mr2 handles snow well as long as it isn’t too deep. it doesn’t have much ground clearance 
"Exactly, I just stop in the 18-22 inch range and all is well."
"Unless your garage is so tight that you need to stop within less than 12 inches of the wall, the parking sensors are more than adequate. 

You’re in the dark again below a foot, though, so at that point the tennis ball is useful. "
I have to keep going for about 6-8 inches after it says stop before the whole car fits in the garage. I use the backup camera and a shelf to back up all to way to the shelf. If I can still see the shelf I can still back up slightly and must do so to fit entirely. 
"Heck, I just use Summon, set to automatically stop 2 feet from the back of my carport (so there's room for my neighbor to get to his car). It's super convenient, since I never have to worry about dinging my door on the carport wall, since I get out first."
"YEah, It really doesn't need to be much. In my apartment building the parking lot tarmac has gotten a little dent from my car standing in the same position. I now just roll into the bump and the car stays there easily, I just roll slowly forward and feel the car roll into it. "
But it does trip you... so nothing's perfect.
I would rather have a tennis ball lightly boop me in the head than trip and fall and eat concrete. Not to mention the tennis ball solution is far cheaper.
This is probably a stupid question but can using those harm your vehicle at all? Since the tire resting in between the two mat humps will be higher up than the other?
I think this has been a thing since garages existed. 
I learned this from my grandfather in 1973!  He had a huge american sedan and a tiny garage with inches to spare.
"> radar distance parking feature

Actually it's ultrasonic - and there are a lot of reasons why I would not trust them 100%. Small poles or objects which are not high enough might not get picked up. Always also use your eyes ;) and the ""ball-solution"" is a good backup, too."
"Great... At least when your car has a rear camera. At least in Europe, most don't if you don't pay extra. (I think from 2021 onwards it is obligatory here, too)"
"Summon?  Not the best idea, it's clipped a lot of peoples' mirrors off in their garage - it doesn't use any cameras yet so it only ""sees"" near the bumpers."
Why not just use some string and any form of soft ball?
"Well, you assume that everyone has a rear camera. At least in Germany that's maybe only 10% of all cars, because the carmakers want hundreds of Euros just for this feature. Obviously barely someone orders them."
Good point. But I guess you could hang the ball on a hook on the wall or something to clear most of area for working.
"The one I have has a motion sensor that activates the laser.  I think it was like $15.

Used it on my previous car and how I had it aimed for that happened to line up with the silver trim piece on the Model 3 dash.  Works great.  Hard to beat the simplicity of a tennis ball I suppose though, haha."
"Yeah, I know these, but... compared to the ball thingy, that's kind of overengineering ;)"
This is the correct answer. Always reverse in and the lines in the reverse camera let you get probably within and inch or two of your spot every time.
"But then he would need to remember the correct distance to the front which is optimal for still being able to walk in front of the car or something. And also I wouldn't trust them, in case there is some obstacle which is not high enough to be detected, but high enough to damage the car."
"Unless you nail it down, wouldn't it get nudged a bit each time you park?"
">but simple board of wood on the floor

That's the ""classic"" solution. But you can only ""feel"" it and not see it. Something I dislike. Also you need to attach it to the ground somehow or it sometimes slides away (and if you don't notice it... not good). Also adjusting it to a new car (if it is fixed to the ground) is not as easy. And finally, a board of wood is so much material for such an easy thing... I feel like the tennis ball has a lot advantages."
"At least in Germany, parking distance sensors are most of the time optional and a few hundred bucks. Most people I know have cars without them. And especially not in the front. Yeah, on Teslas sure. (I think I've read somewhere, that in America most cars come with a lot more equipment normally than in Europe, here you need to pay extra for everything -.-)"
"Haven't ever seen this on TV. And there are thousands of garages in TV series! Therefore, can't be that widespread...

Also you'd be surprised about many things which are ""normal"" for you - and other people never heard of it or did it in a different way. That's what makes the internet so interesting. You get to see the bigger picture and learn something new every day."
"So far 183 upvotes and I guess, most of those upvoters also didn't know about this trick before.

Maybe it's just a thing in your neighbourhood, how can you judge about this, based on you experience? Welcome ot your own personal filter bubble!"
Yep.
"You got it...Probably should have went with a volt instead of i3. This year has been too tight for i3 tires :/

It's also about the worst parking spot. Very edge with a tiny turning window"
"The car is able to react very quickly to keep everything in control. Everytime things got a little loose in a turn it automatically adjusts power and braking to bring things back in line. It also is able to quickly detect and reduce wheels spin so getting started in slick areas was no problem at all. I've driven a RWD ICE manual car in the snow before and I was insanely impressed by how easy and how much control the Tesla has. I will say the only drawback is the ground clearance. We've gotten enough snow that the unplowed roads have snow banks built up that are higher than the bottom of the car. I was able to push through this morning, but it's still going so I might need to break out my wife's suv if the road crews can't catch up :-("
"It sounds a bit fanboyish imo. In any case, you don’t *need* awd in winter and most people get by just fine without it here in Finland. The important part is winter tyres. Without good tyres awd is of no use in bad conditions. Don’t get me wrong, awd is nice but people don’t get stuck in snow here since the last 20 years or so thanks to advances in tyre tech. "
EV traction control is amazing. My econo EVs were also really amazing in the winter time.
Snow tires or regular tires?  Did you try slip start?  Were you in chill mode?
"That does suck, I'm sorry to hear it :-/ I was able to keep the momentum up and made it home."
tirerack
Same here. Simple drive to the store and had multiple issues with lost traction control and some pretty decent fish tailing at only 15mph. It is a heavier car with different weight distribution. Will need more driving to get used to it.
"We had a slippery day here this week and my RWD Model 3 did have some difficulty. I had to turn on slip start to get out of an inclined parking spot - and the back slipped out a bit on snow covered turns. 

I think both situations will be vastly improved with snow tires, however. I was waiting for a day like that to determine whether I’ll buy a set for next season."
He wiped it. You can see the lack of snow starts outside of the light and moves into it
"It looks like the snow free area starts at the nose of the car - I wonder if the airflow/vortices off the center front face of the car help keep snow from accumulating at speed. 

(Or if he just brushed the snow off the headlights)"
I was wondering the same thing. Perhaps the headlights get warm/hot?
"Yes, AP didn't work at all, even when the sensors were clear :-/ it had some sort of warning about the radar not functioning properly with all the snow coming down"
Not sure if I was in the same snowstorm yesterday but my autopilot was in and out with the warning on the screen. My commute is only about 10m though so not a huge sample size. 
"The Model 3 does not have a dedicated battery heater which is insane. It hasn't got too cold where I live and I'm always around 1/4 regen, maybe 1/2 after I pre heat but that is still bad."
">  I couldn't even engage cruise because the radar was blocked with snow

Did that prevent even old-style ""dumb"" cruise control too?"
"Dang that sounds bad, good to know. I want a mode 3 so bad!!"
"No, not your fault there, dude, I meant Tesla should have the heater things like rear windows. They sell enough in Norway, you'd think they'd be standard on these. I have LED in mine and in the last rare snow we had, I had to get out and brush snow from my lights."
Ahh okay. Feel like that would be a nice option...
"I know.  I hear different answers all the time that it does, then someone else says it doesn't.  Though I'm certain it doesn't.  "
"Good point, sticky wet snow will cause problems no matter what. "
"Question: why didn't you clear off the snow, do you like having a wet garage?"
"Thanks! The guy was as pleasant as a person can be given the situation. thankfully it was his fault, and I’m pretty sure he can afford to fix the minor damage that my car incurred.  "
"I didn’t know it was heavy, but it makes sense now that I think about it. He told me he’d only had it for six weeks, and this is the first time there’s been any snow accumulation all winter 😵"
"My experience is what you covered in your first part: as long as you see well the lines, Autopilot works very well. It gets tricky when one line is covered, lines are disappear/fade or even faded by a layer of salt that makes the asphalt greyish. If snow just started, even if heavy snow, as long as the lines are still visible Autopilot worked well for me... for 30 mins until your bumper starts accumulating snow and you have to pull over to remove it. 😉 But maybe they changed something and radar recalibrate because my Autopilot started again after maybe 15 mins in recent snow storms."
"yea you're probably right, in that it handles much better than any other rwd I've driven in the snow.  Did you have chill mode on?  the only times i noticed a slip was when accelerating, i had to really lightly speed up.  Slowing down, and turns seems good"
That's good to hear. Thank you. 
"I’ve been displeased with my Primacy tires.  The car managed stability, but I could tell traction in snow made it unwise to go much more than ~30mph.  Dropping pressure down to ~38psi seemed to help marginally."
"oh yeah i forgot, as long as the front wall isnt gradually merging in front of it. lol.

i was up in the snow 2 weeks ago, with AWD, and i was still really nervous.  had no issues except for one intersection that was really icy and wheels slipped and took 3 seconds to rock out of it.  i keep hearing the digital traction control is better than any thing the ICE cars can do , maybe it was working all along and i didnt notice cause the driving was smooth otherwise."
"Thanks for the feedback.  Yeah, I've been of the mind that a single 4K camera system above the driver's head is probably the most reliable sensor you can have in a car.

"

"I fully disagree with that: I feel that my AWD M3 is WAY safer than my Cherokee. If M3 starts spinning a little, the Motors react so quick that in a fraction of a second the car adjusts and doesn't slip anymore. So with the same quality of tire, now I take the M3 when I go out with the family, especially if weather is bad (e.g. the freezing rain that we had in Quebec just after Christmas)."

"I’m in Florida lol :)

Have fun. But I wonder how much it would suck having to do a long trip and wait at a supercharger for 30 mins.."
"Protip from Canada: Anyone who doesn't clean off their car up here is considered a douche (because we're all expected to know already) because not only does snow blow into your face blinding you, but it can blow off the top and blind people behind you."
Definitely! Thanks for the heads up :-D
in the UK it is illegal to drive with snow on your roof / bonnet of the car for this reason. It can impair your viability and cause damage to other vehicles if it all shifts at once
"This is why Subzero package is so useful/necessary(?) in cold weather.  On an ICE car the heated engine will warm the washer fluid lines under the hood and the washer jets, as well as some residual heat at the base of the windshield (although usually not enough to melt the ice off the wipers).

Subzero includes heated washer jets, and the base of the windshield where the wipers rest is heated, so if you pre-heat your car, the wipers are thawed so they work properly even in the icy cold."
SO much fun in the snow. Just stopped in to get coffee after a long day of trekking around in the Midwestern snowfall. =]
I live on the edge. I wait till it says stop. At about 11”
"> Not to mention the tennis ball solution is far cheaper. 

LOL"
No damage .. the difference in height is less than an inch.
"Honest question, why are they charging more for what is basically a safety feature?"
Well that explains why it's so terrible. Not sure why I assumed it used the cameras. Is that what's supposedly coming in the advanced summon update?
"No not summon, I’m talking about the display where it shows how close you are to an object, similar to backup sensors but on the front. 

(Idk if Tesla’s have this, i for one don’t own one, I’m talking from experience from my Range Rover Velar)"

Do tennis balls watch out for mirrors?
"Given that it's the Tesla subreddit, I assumed we were talking about Tesla's, 100% of which have rear cameras."
Tennis ball doesnt see those either...or wait?? 
"No not really - ok the thing we use is more of a small plank, but as long as you drive with 'feel' it stays where it is supposed to be.
However I really like the ball idea, maybe I'll try that once I get my 3!"
"I've also seen people use those small ""practice golf balls"" - they're plastic with holes in them.

There are also products basically like the car proximity sensor but it's stationary in the garage. It shoots a laser and when your vehicle interrupts the laser it beeps.

A super easy cheap solution is to just stick something to the garage floor so when your tire hits it you know to stop. Could be as thin as a pencil and you'd be able to feel it in the car. I guess it depends on the car.

I always just identify something hanging on the wall that is lined up with some part of the car like the wing mirror and from my perspective in the driver's seat. The real trick for me has always been left/right centering. I've always had a garage with a double door and two cars, so making sure there is room for the other car AND I can still open my door can be tricky."
"So I guess having thin tires like does not particularly help go through snow accumulation... I would have thought it would have helped a bit.

Maybe the traction control is too conservative and the software should let you use the equivalent of slip start?"
Thanks for the feedback. Very interesting 
"Yep, tires make a massive difference. The vast majority of people would be fine with rwd or fwd if they just put a decent set of snows on. I’ll take a rwd with snows over an awd with all seasons any day of the week. "
Can confirm. My shitty 97 Mercury has absolutely no traction control and a set of Michelin X-ice tires and I did alright in this storm. Snow tires are a godsend.
"Always buy snow tires. For some reason it's not a big thing here in the states, but even without snow, all season tires are drastically less effective and have a lot less grip at temps below 45F. That's even worse if there's snow on the ground. 

Winter tires drastically reduce stopping distance, increase traction, and make for a safer driving experience. "
"My RWD has done excellent this winter with snow tires. We have an AWD S for comparison (but with all seasons) and the 3 is much more performant in the slush/ice/snow. The S is a champ too, but you lose some control authority without good grip."
"Ya, I had to pull over at one point to wipe the snow off the lights, they don't generate enough heat to melt the snow apparently"
"Maybe the headlight compartments have some sort of warming mechanism in them?  If you think about it, obviously if the front of the car is generating zero heat (because no ICE) then that could actually be a problem for headlights.  So maybe Tesla thought of that?"

"I read that as 10 meters and thought, man, I would just walk... 😂"
"Ya, I read that the battery cooling good is shared with the cabin air heater so it works double duty in the cold. Cold weather performance is definitely a killer on range, I took a ~200 Mile road trip when it was ~30F outside and just barely made it home with the LR battery."

Headlamp washers will do just the trick!
"Nope, I had standard Accel, but ya I agree, accelerating was the only times I really noticed slipping"
"Gotcha, all season will always struggle in snow/ice, but I felt pretty good on the highway last night at ~50mph despite a layer slush. I've heard mixed things over the years about adjusting tire pressure for cold weather for any car. Best bet is probably to get a set of winter tires, but we rarely get snow storms like this so I am hesitant to spend the money of them :-/"
"All seasons suck in all seasons.  These just suck more then average.  

I’ll be going with winters next season.  I have to sell all the wheels and tires from my old DD the 3 replaced first.  This car will be a beast in the snow with winters and dual motors.  I’ll be able to troll the Subaru and Audi Quattros with it.  I am very impressed with its AWD.  I’d love to try its hand at ice racing if I can get some time."
"yep, i think that was the biggest thing, it just made driving in the snow effortless, the slightest twitch in an ICE can send you spinning, but this thing was just constantly adjusting and keeping everything in check. I was totally amazed."
"Lol, old habits die hard 😁"
Get a foam brush if you don't have one. I ended up pulling over and wiping off the sensors. Worked fine after that. In your situation it might have just kept getting covered though. Only reason mine got completely covered was the plow threw a bunch of slush on me! 
"Ya, frequent long road trips would not be ideal for this car, but where we live in the Midwest it's faster to fly to most destinations the Tesla can't reach in one charge."
"Yup. Totally agree. I saw this video [https://m.imgur.com/gallery/trnomnZ] and was shocked at how much damage the snow/ice did. I understand the heating then cooling of the lower layer of snow on the roof of the car creates an ice sheet and that allowed it to stay clumped together while in flight, but actually seeing it smash the windshield was something else.

I’m sure to clean the entire car off before driving now."

Also clear your brake lights off people."
"How about truck drivers? I get that its hard to get up there, and they almost universally don't. But when you have a 12ft long block of 2ft deep ice/snow sliding off the top of a trailer in front of you.."
It's illegal. Rightfully. You can be ticketed. 
"In NJ, you'll be [pulled over](https://www.nj.gov/oag/hts/ice-and-snow.html) for it."
"Yeah, I assumed this was expected etiquette in the North when driving in the snow if it wasn’t actually the law.  

When I moved up North I watched a bunch of snow driving videos, and that was the first rule.  Clean off the whole car."
"Pro tip from New Jersey.  If you don’t clean your car you can get a ticket. (OK, so I haven’t actually heard of anyone getting ticketed, but it is the law. )"
"Here, in the US, no one is considerate of others. Being a douche is standard behavior.  Carry on."
"I noticed that if it doesn’t come off easy there is no point to putting any effort. Since the hood doesn’t get warm from an engine, the snow doesn’t detach from the hood and get airborne. No need to remove the snow if a light brush doesn’t do it. "
Is the Sub Zero only available for Model S and X?
"Maybe I don't understand something here, 11"" between the wall and the front of the car? That's almost 30 cm, there's still a shittom of space left isn't it?

I'm not trying to be sarcastic or a dick, it just doesn't sound that much so I'm not sure if I understand what you guys are talking about, though I have a car that probably costs less than a Tesla's wheel so I'm less nervous about damaging it."
"1. It costs money (development + hardware; obviously, the real cost is not much, compared to the cost of a car)
2. Because some people pay for it, so they obviously use the chance to make money
3. They can't get enough money
4. The worst thing: Many Germans are like: I never had this, therefore I don't need this and I'd rather not pay for this stupid stuff, so they better make it optional! (In the end they don't pay less, but only more if they add these features, but they are happy -.-) just look at the German BMW configurator, you will get crazy with all these options, it just is stupid, but they seem to deliver what buyers really want 🤦🏼‍♂️
5. Most people here see these more like comfort / premium featueres, not as safety features."
"Yes, that was confirmed a few weeks ago.  Smart Summon, or Summon+ will essentially be a very limited FSD sort of thing that has always been an advertised feature of EAP.  It's essentially a slow speed NoA that only works in private lots and since summon is so slow it won't need any of the faster CPUs but will probably never work on AP1 (even though smart summon was promised to AP1 buyers so maybe they'll get a front and rear camera only version)."
">I’m talking about the display where it shows how close you are to an object,

Yes, the Tesla has these, I really like the way it renders it. However, not every car is a Tesla and not every car has ultrasonic parking sensors. And even less cars have them in the front..."
"Those are the sensors summon uses, they're the same in front and back.  No cameras used yet, just ultrasonic sensors on the bumpers with no sensors on the sides."
"It's not a matter of not looking, the forums have video of people looking and recording while summon goes from normal to sharp turn into garage door in less than a second.  It shouldn't be fully trusted, Tesla's park sensors keep it away from walls OKish but garage doors can be much closer, and those shart steering corrections are unpredictable.

Summon+ should fix this, they've mentioned that cameras will be enabled soon and that should give true spatial awareness to the computer."
"Ok, you're right. But with sensors etc. people tend to not use their eyes anymore and only trust them..."
"Narrow tires should help, its probably traction control related as you say; assuming the tires were not freespinning. Many people also forget to disable or modify their traction control settings when they get stuck in snow. I have been called before by people asking for help when they are stuck and simply telling them to find the button with skid marks behind the car and press it got a little more than half of them out. Cars normally loosen traction control a bit when it is under freezing, but most don't go loose enough to help when your actually stuck."
"Where rwd falls down is if you're going from a snowy side street or parking lot to a main road with quicker traffic. The awd will make that happen all day long without drama. Rwd, not so much. Add any kind of an incline, and you will feel the drama with the rwd. From experience  from living in a snowy icy area. "
"Hey there, I have a question about snow/winter tires. I live in Seattle where we get snow just a few days a year but lots of rain. My LR RWD got stuck twice yesterday in the snow with the stock tires. What tires do you recommend? Should I only put the on in the snow or all winter?"

Damn those super efficient LEDs.
"The LEDs only need to heat the headlights to ~35F before there is a layer of water and then any snow will fall off/not stick.  LEDs do get warm, especially headlights.  "
LEDs generate enough heat to melt snow away.

Why walk when you can TM3!!
"As a friend of mine puts it: ""I drive every way which is longer than a car length""... :\[\]"
I know the excess heat from the motors is used to warm the battery but that is only when you're driving. Even then it takes around 1 hour of driving to get 3/4 regen in weather below 40f. A dedicated battery heater would keep the battery at a optimal temperature allowing full regen even when its below freezing.
This isn’t true. I have a first gen Leaf and have used it at below 0F after a night long cold soak outside.
"> It does disable both, which seems kind of silly. Seems like it would default back but maybe they thought people wouldn’t understand and assume TACC was still on.

That sucks. I wonder what other manufacturers do in that situation.

> Though I wouldn’t use cruise in heavy snow anyway.

It doesn't particularly have to be, especially right *now*. You just have to have *been* through snow since your last chance to clean off the radar. Also, you'll see someone else saying even light snow was enough to block it for them within 2-3 miles of driving, and you can have other situations like other cars kicking up a rare slush pile onto your front end or stuff.

The relative safety of me vs cruise in less than ideal (*edit*: whoops, I had out a word) conditions is something that I've always wondered about anyway... I did a search a while back but wasn't able to turn up much definitive in terms of whether it's safer or less safe to use cruise in those conditions.

*Edit*: Conventional wisdom of course is to not use CC when it's potentially slippery out -- but TBH, I kind of feel like if you search for this you get a bunch of results that have hallmarks of being old wives' tales, or at least being something that *used* to be true but wouldn't be with a modern car. A bunch of *reasons* why CC might be less safe but no actual evidence it is, inadequate explanations of ways in which CC might *benefit* safety, explanations that don't always make a lot of sense or in some cases are outright wrong, maybe it's true for RWD cars but not FWD, etc."
Works fine for me in Colorado? I drive in snow a lot and haven’t ever wanted headlight washers.
Wait... you near St. Louis?
"I 100% agree.  My area just doesn’t get enough consistent snow days for me to justify it all.  I do agree that the dual motor 3 does a great job at managing slip.  It’s remarkable, and this car would be an absolute beast with proper tires."

"Had this, but slightly worse, happen to me a few years ago driving just outside of State College, PA. A truck coming toward me in the opposite lane of Route 322 had a HUGE sheet of ice shear off the top and just come flipping into my lane. No time at all to avoid it. I slowed down a bit, but in hindsight, if I had kept up my speed, it may have just missed me by going over my car (or landing on the roof) instead of smashing in the windshield. But there's just no time to think like that at the time.

The windshield ended up mostly in my lap and on my chest. Broken glass everywhere else. Bruises on my chest. It sucked.
"
Perfect example.
"Technically in some provinces (I know Ontario is one) it is illegal not to brush off your car in winter. You can get pulled over but if you cause an accident or are in an accident and they see that, you'll be done."
Yeah but the trucks can have huge blocks of snow and ice fly off the top of the trailer and hit you. Wonder if anyone has been seriously injured or killed from that.
What states?
"If I ever see a cop pull someone over for it, I'd go but that cop a meal."
"TBH, I'm not even sure if it's illegal or not.  It being stupid and douchey is enough to keep it so only some 2-4% of people aren't doing it.  I guess it's harder to keep the retards at bay in much of the US."
"Good question... never looked it up for a Model 3
 3... I don’t see it as an option for the Model 3, but I know it’s available for S & X"
"For me, it's more about knowing I'm in far enough to close the door."
Exactly. That is why the very lo-tech tennis ball solution is still a thing. 
"It uses the ultrasonic sensors to measure how close it is to nearby objects and shows this information on the screen while beeping faster as you get closer. Under a certain distance (around 1ft) it flashes a big red STOP and changes to an alarm noise.

One person was saying that there wasn't any need for ranging cues (like the hanging tennis ball) because you can use the ultrasonic ranging instead and mentioned how close they get. I usually pull up to around 18in from the curb as well - for me, this is less about how close that actually is and more about it being close enough and an easy distance to stop around with decent margin for error. I pull up closer sometimes, but there's a lot of go/stop to do that and usually no real benefit - the car isn't very big and can chill in the center of a parking space just fine.

The other person was (sarcastically, I think) saying that they live dangerously and pull in closer, to when the warning to STOP comes up. This is somewhat risky because it's too close to really see the curb, and it's too close for ultrasonic ranging, so you're just kind of going by feel (and again, no real benefit.)

..Or if your question was more along the lines of ""why do Tesla owners not want to hit curbs?"" the answer is a lot simpler - it's an expensive car that rides low and is covered in technology (including four ultrasonic emitters and an air intake on the front bumper.) You're potentially in for worse than scratches if you get careless.

Edit: I don't know why I thought we were talking about curbs. Apparently, space is premium in garages in which case, hey, maybe a tennis ball is a good way to see how to get closer than 1ft. "
The Tesla object detection systems tells you to stop when you get to under a foot. Of course we could park closer. My comment was a bit tongue in-cheek. 
"It’s a lot of space, but it’s also a distance that you can close *very* quickly if you’re momentarily heavily on the throttle. I for one don’t feel the need to test out how good the obstacle-award acceleration and auto-braking features are. "
"A) yeah, ton of space 

B) you can also turn on the rear camera at any time so it's super easy to confirm you're all the way in"
"Not NYC parking tight, but can barely sneak By on foot, and tesla system displays STOP and beeps pretty good at this distance (around 12”) "
"In the midwest USA I lived in a house where you could take a trashcan and walk it around the car with the door closed.

Not my experience with winter tires.
Not with snow tires. 
"Blizzaks are a great tire, and I've heard the Yokohama blue earths and Michelin x13s are good as well, though have no experience. You can roll them all winter, you just don't want to roll them when it warms up. They have a heavy silica content and will get very squirmy and wear fast in the heat. "
"I'd say all winter, as soon as the temperature is consistently below 45°F. Winter tire compound is softer in lower temperatures, adding to overall grip even when there isn't any snow or moisture on the ground.

That being said, the Pirelli Sottozeros that people generally get are excellent winter tires and will serve you well.

"> That sucks. I wonder what other manufacturers do in that situation.

it really depends on the brand. The Audis i've driven have a heated radar sensor. But when you manage to get that covered up it will disable TACC and if you reenable it it's the normal ""dumb"" cruise control.  
Hyundai usually lets you switch between TACC and normal CC by holding the cruise control button.  
But I'm not sure how the other ones do it. "
"Yes it is quite variable: I've been in melting snow storms and it disables pretty quick on highway (10-30 mins); in trafic where slush covers the bumper quick even if no snow falling; in regular snow it doesn't seem too bad as long as you're not following cars closely and/or there's no slush on the ground.

I'm wondering though if recent updates changed anything: last snow storms the radar disabled but went back on again after maybe 15 mins, which makes me wonder if they made it recalibrate after some time. Because it does suck when the road is very clear but both Autopilot and TACC disables just because of a small layer of snow on the bumper..."

Accidents with passengers who don't use airbags will probably have unoccupied seats whose former occupants need unlocked doors so rescue workers can help explain the importance of airbags after they recover.

Wow, that's interesting.  I was rear ended mildly not too long ago, but nothing happened.  I guess there is a larger threshold.  I didn't hear any others report that it occurred (now I see some on that tweet), so I just assumed it was never implemented.  Thanks!"
"Hate to break it to you, but most modern cars do this already.


For Chrysler products:  In the event of an impact causing air bag deployment, if the communication network remains intact, and the power remains intact, depending on the nature of the event the ORC will determine whether to have the Enhanced Accident Response System perform the following functions:

* Cut off fuel to the engine.
* Flash hazard lights as long as the battery has power or until the ignition key is turned off.
* Turn on the interior lights, which remain on as long as the battery has power or until the ignition key is removed.
* Unlock the doors automatically.

-

Ford:  Most of our vehicles also carry the SOS-Post Crash Alert System™, which alerts passers-by and first responders to a vehicle’s location. In the event of airbag or safety belt pre-tensioner activation, it:

* Automatically starts the hazard lights
* Unlocks the vehicle doors
* Sounds the horn (non-European vehicles only)

-
GM: 

* OnStar Fuckery"
"Yes. Because its soo common someone crashes fleeing a mugger versus just getting into normal auto accidents where air bags are deployed..... LOL

Dumb response. Smart feature. "
A common name for a man of Spanish descent. 
Not to mention most airbags deploy via an accelerometer detecting a sudden shift in mass rather than sensing an impact striking the vehicle.
"I don’t know about a Tesla but a friend of mine used to deliver Toyota’s.

One  of his stops just behind the ramps there was like a 3inch drop.  He had a Camry deploy all its air bags.  Toyota sometimes if the angle of the car is past a specific incline it trips a tip over sensor and a shock after that deploys the air bags.  


It’s only happened to him once but he said he almost shit his pants when all the air bags went off on him."
"Your logic escapes me, why should it only unlock when the car is in drive? Someone can still ram into the car while it's parked, render the screen useless and thus, unable to open the glove compartment. "
My sister had a 98 Citröen with an emergency fuel cutoff (on airbag deployment). The instruction manual had two pages devoted to how to override it if you deemed it safe to drive the vehicle after an accident. 
"If the airbags go off in my wife's Ford will call 911 if a bluetooth phone is connected, relay the vehicle location and that an airbag deployment happened and then connect the occupants to the call. "
"Fuel pump cut off has been standard on cars for a long time.

Even my 2005 Peugeot 206 would put the hazard lights on in the event of very heavy braking, or airbag deployment."
I was thinking of a unwanted unlock all doors bypass for donogooders.
It's in the frunk....... Oh.
[deleted]
Not a concern. Cars have multiple sensors to determine whether it has been in an accident. This is why airbags don't deploy on a fender bender or a large pothole. 
"You've got to be kidding. A couple lads pushing on a car put hardly any g-forces on a vehicle. Unlike a crash which can easily be above 50g. 

Air bags don't go off unless the impact is over ~60g. [source](https://icsw.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/rulings/AAirBagSNPRM/)"
So how does one escape from the rear?
Emergency teleporter. 
One that is Manuel. What good is backup power if the motors for release are broken in the crash. 
"Yup. Was addressing the fact that all these people think Tesla is so innovative or amazing for having or adding in functionality that others have had for years/decades.

E.g. It took until Q1 2018 for Tesla to associate driver profiles (seating position, mirrors, etc.) to keyfobs -- something cars since the 90s have been doing. 

Bring on the downvotes, cult of Tesla. "
2. This isn't safe
"Fair enough, but if no passengers are in should the doors still pop?"
I somehow missunderstood the headline for unlocked and doors pop open. 
"The glovebox in a Model 3 is unlocked through the screen. It's a security feature, so that if someone breaks in your car they can't open the glovebox."
"There were a couple reports shortly after he mentioned that would be released. I could be wrong, but I think it only opens the glove box for a front end collison, and may require airbag deployment."

That would be Manuel
Not all of them; side impact depends on air-pressure change in the door cavity. 
GM a couple of years ago was having an issue with the Camaro and CTS-V where the airbags would occasionally deploy during spirited driving either on track on auto-x.  They weren't hitting so much as a bump in the road but apparently the combination of high lateral G with a modest amount of body roll was enough to trip it.
"Probably was thinking about security. If something is stored in there then a person could ram the car and get to the stuff. 

On the flip side your point is good too. "

"On Model S Model X you use the manual override if there is no power. Model S, under the rear carpet by the rear passengers' feet. Model X, there is a pull cable behind the speaker grilles.

I'm wondering if they also have the power backup since they too would need brake boosters during a 12 Volt outage. "
A crash that breaks the door latch motors is likely to disfigure the frame enough to prevent the doors from opening anyway.
The downvotes are because you communicate like an insufferable cunt. They have nothing to do with Tesla.
"Unfortunately, try adding another keyfob and see how those profiles work out for you. (Happy 2004 GMC owner here. ) Spoiler alert...I can have exactly 2 profiles and new keyfobs have to replace the old ones (if you want the profile function) and the Owner can't do it without the Dealership.
I had a bad fob and while I found a reasonably priced replacement, it will forever ne Driver 3, whivh has no profile. "
Since you asked
"I’d say yes. It’s the same idea. If I was the driver, and my door was obstructed, I’d need to get out through somewhere else, so keeping all other doors locked isn’t a great idea. In addition, without the doors being unlocked, I don’t believe you would be able to open them manually from the outside, which could lead to issues as well. 

It’s just smarter and safer to have everything unlock. "
The doors don’t pop open. They just unlock. 
"It's not really a security feature, just a design decision. Also for FSD and the Tesla Network."
"Thank you for the reply mate, it cleared it up."
*security feature* more like they didn't wanna add another lever/handle/latch to complicate the assembly process
You assume people can't pry it open
It's not like people kept stuff in their glove boxes anyways
I would assume airbag deployment would be the minimum requirement to react to a crash automatically.
"Ah, that may be while it never occurred for me.  I looked through the manual but didn't find any information about it."
"That my amigo, is typically a name for a book of instructions. "
"Side impact sensors are on the B pillars, my dude. Putting airbag sensors in a door is a terrible idea. Doors also are extremely poorly sealed. There isn't a reason to have it air tight."
I can only imagine that airbags are overly sensitive in modern cars due to airbag failures in older models.  I drove a 2004 vehicle into the back of a pickup truck that drove into the back of a trailer at about 50 miles an hour but since my bumper went under the truck and flipped the truck over the airbag did not deploy.  The shop didn't even seem surprised at the time so it must have been a fairly common issue.  I'd rather the airbags go off a little too often then not at all.  Even with the seatbelt on I broke some bones in that one.
Your logic also escapes me. Name one instance where someone rammed their car into another car so that they rob the contents of the car.
Like a pinata? o.o
Lol yea I know. The created implausible scenarios in this thread trying to paint this feature as 'bad' is fucking hilarious. 
Cars have multiple sensors to determine whether it has been in an accident. This is why airbags don't deploy on a fender bender or a large pothole.
"First let's look at the logistical challenge of lifting 1000kg. If you had 5 people, that's 200kg each, that is humanly possible but still an extremely impressive lift even under ideal circumstances (on gym equipment with proper handles). I'm sure no one would notice 5 dudes jerking the back of a car.

Besides that, dropping anything 1m (on Earth) results in that object travelling at 4.43 m/s or ~16km/hr (ignoring air resistance). Now lucky for cars they have a handy suspension to soften such an impact. I'm going to estimate that the total suspension travel of this car is 10cm. So with an initial speed of 4.43 m/s, a final speed of 0 m/s, a stopping distance of 0.1m, car's weight 1000 kg, the resulting impact would be ~10g. Well below any real accident.
[source](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/car-crash-force)"
"I neglected to say it since it was the tweet linked but on Model 3 you would push the door release button like always. I wonder if it undoes the child locks if the airbags pop, if not they should. "
"Lilly sure, defiantly no. That is why this is a good, but not perfect solution. Would rather Manuel release with physical parts in emergencies."
"Good post. A lot of people like to generalize, but when you peel back the onion, you find it isn't as it seemed sometimes. "
"I think it's both. By replacing a manual latch, you can add features and security. For example, optionally require a 4 digit PIN to open the glovebox after pressing the unlock button. But only when you're not parked in your garage. Or, get a notification to your phone if it's opened, remotely locking or unlocking from the app. It's a design decision that opens up more security potential if they desire.

Case in point: If the rear seat folding was a servo activated by a  3"" touchscreen by the rear door handle instead of a manual latch, they could've pushed firmware that locks when the car doors are locked. Smash and grab would've been solved immediately."
"But the wiring and electronic nature of a custom servo and latch system was bot complicated?
I think it was a design choice that matched with the clean aesthetic, as well as SOME added safety."
How is a mechanical latch any more complicated than the current setup?
"I mean, you’re wrong. "
Older airbags worked by shock on the bumper.  A kick to a bumper could deploy the air bags but a wreck like yours nothing.  A friend of mine flipped a car.  No airbag deployment.  As the tow truck driver was pulling it out of a field the bumper dropped and caught a bit of dirt.  Airbags deployed. 
"Probably when they find out parked cars unlock when rammed.
Also, won’t be ramming *their* car into it, but a stolen one."
"I think you might be too dead-set on proving that exact scenario wrong, that you're thinking about it very narrowly. I don't want to be accused of ""moving the goal posts"" because my initial comment was very open and I'm genuinely trying to hypothesize how this could be exploited. We can go back and fourth, but I think given the nature of my initial question, it's fair to modify the scenario. With that said, here it goes:

&#x200B;

First, there isn't much of a logistical challenge with a lift. Take 6 people for all I care (if that makes it easier to swallow). They are basically lifting up on [this](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5602/15476489509_6a7b40f357_b.jpg), which is fairly ideal for a basic squat front lift. It can be done by a group of healthy adult males. Even that doesn't really matter. If it helps your visualization any, let's say we're using a farm jack. This can raise our height to 1.4m. Easy tool for a would-be criminal and now we can pull this off with one human. Much more ideal.

&#x200B;

One thing to keep in mind is that it's not sufficient to only talk about the traveling speed of the car when it hits the ground due to gravity, because you're neglecting to consider any other forces that may be acting on the car at impact (which I'll get to shortly). I also think you are conflating the g force impact on a human with the impact force of the car hitting the ground (which are totally different since a person has a longer space over which to decelerate, maintains longer inertia, etc.). The calculator you linked tries to approximate this, as it's optimized for calculating impact force on the human body, not the car itself. You'll see if this if you drill into the details of how it makes the calculation.

&#x200B;

It's probably better for consistency if you think about airbag deployment AND the ""crash"" in terms of newtons acting on the car - or at least total deceleration. Remember, the [ACU will use a series of accelerometers to determine if the bags should be deployed](https://carfromjapan.com/article/industry-knowledge/air-bag-deployment-what-are-the-required-conditions/). This has nothing to do with the impact force of the human (except for its relativity to the impact force of the car). Actually, that's not quite 100% true; the one factor that will change the calculation is if the seatbelts are engaged, since it takes much more force to deploy the bags if they are engaged than if they aren't, but that's a binary adjustment and probably safe to say they are disengaged if we're hypothesizing about a parked, unmanned car. 

&#x200B;

[Here](http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/523539.html) is a good thread that goes into better detail about the distinction between the g force on the human body and the crash impact. That thread links to [this](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/MichelleYee.shtml), which is a much more visually pleasing version of the paper you linked, but what I like about it is that it makes it much more clear that the g force quoted in your link is talking about acceleration of the human passenger's chest, which wouldn't even come into play in this scenario. Apples to oranges, really.

&#x200B;

So back to the total deceleration of the car - if you walk that force backwards to figure out what the car impact speed would be for an individual wearing a seatbelt to experience 60gs of torso force, it's a measly [16mph](https://www.reference.com/vehicles/much-force-needed-deploy-airbag-4158473d71eaa229), or 10-12 mph for a non-seatbelt scenario, or a velocity of 4.47m/s

&#x200B;

I don't want to get too far down the road of assumptions with the suspension and how that might compare with body crumple distance for a forward collision (ie it would take considerably less downward force to cause an equivalent deceleration that 4.47 m/s would cause in a frontal collision). I should at least mention that we haven't even considered adding downward force on the drop. You assume a drop with v0 = 0. Why stop there? Slam the car down to add more speed. 500N (a reasonable amount for a human) of added downward force would easily add 0.5 m/s\^2, or for our (roughly) 0.5s ""crash"". This can even be multiplied for several people, but let's stick to our most feasible scenario of the farm jack and say this is one person. Now they've added velocity of 0.52m/s + speed due to gravity = 4.95m/s, which is now quite a bit higher than the necessary 4.47 m/s to deploy the bags.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I think you get my point now. You're constraining the problem and conflating a few things. This is actually . pretty common logical flaw in security design.

"It is a design choice not to have a standard key lock. Easier if course , but typically my cars have had a so called service key for example that would allow the car to be opened and started , but not open the glove box. Doesn't help in an accidental though, since most people would just leave it open forever"
"they were able to seamlessly add latches to the front doors, they could have made it work. It was probably easier/cheaper to make it an electronic switch instead of making/creating/installing a robust handle/latch for the glove compartment. Not saying it's better or worse, just don't be deceived thinking they only did it for security. Every design choice about this car was for ease and low cost of manufacturing.

"Yes, a computer-controlled servo lock can be programmed to act the same way but would require going back and forth between the screen and pushing a button (in the case of a PIN, for example). Annoying security is often bypassed. 

It reminds me of “What’s the best exercise? The one you’ll do.” Imagine pushing the physical button and it just beeps and you have to move to the screen to enter a PIN. Then back to the glove box. (By comparison, keeping it on the display and pushing open button which turns into a PIN pad right where your finger is.) The best security is the one everyone keeps active. Security that’s too much of a chore is often turned off. 

The of UX a physical button and nothing happening (or requiring going to the app or screen anyway) will be frustrating. In a way, it could force consumers to be secure like websites requiring 2-factor login.  "
"Hence why it adds security. It can be programmed to lock when the car doors lock. Or require a PIN when you’re not home in the garage. Yes, you can use a key/valet key but security only works when you use it. Automatic/easy security is still security. "
"Don't know why you're downvoted.  If they wanted a handle, it could have also had an electric lock.  But the handle mechanism with springs and bearings made more moving parts and is actually unnecessary.  

That said, glove box latch might be one of the only weak wear spots in the car.  Seems to break somewhat often."

72* is comfortable. 80+* is toasty. But yea it’s extremely fast to warm up. Love that in the morning. For some reason I always remember too late (when I’m almost done getting ready for work) but it’s always warm enough to get in without needing a big bulky jacket. 
"Another example showing Model 3 preheating stats from -18°C (0°F) by setting climate to Hi: https://imgur.com/R5p6F5N

Reached 10°C (50°F) in 5 minutes, 22°C (72°F) in 15 minutes and reached the max temperature of Hi (28°C) in 28 minutes.  

Power draw was 9 kW initially, then dropped to 8 kW.  Battery loss was 8% in the 39 minutes I was preheating, or 12% per hour."
Does this work over WiFi and cellular? Our parking garage at work is super cold and lacks cellular but has a few WiFi spots 
"Yeah the cabin warms up very quickly and they heat the seats just enough. The steering wheel seems to require a little longer to really be comfortable to hold without gloves though.

I think the only really annoying thing is if water has gotten into the door handles and frozen there, since the cabin heat isn't directed to the door handles meaningfully."
I set our X to max while shoveling the driveway and it got to 107F. Snow on it just melted away. 🤣
I wish you could schedule this to happen every morning. 
"Thats awesome, I wonder how long it would take in a Model X. "
"This is good to know. My brother has a 2012 Leaf and it basically never heats up, you have to be satisfied with seat heaters being your only source of warmth"
82 degrees? Do you not have any blood?
How much battery did that drain?
My Škoda Felicia made in 99 takes 6 minutes from freezer temp. to microwave.

This is such a great feature.  Warming up the car while it’s in the garage.   Love my tesla!
"It is a fantastic heater. In 40 degree F inside the car, within 1 minute I feel warm air and the seat heater. Seriously impressive. "
72 is hot AF. 82 is fucking hell.

So lately I feel like my heat set at low settings and gets the car fairly comfortable pretty quick like OP but sometimes I wanna crank it and so if I put it to HI and fan speed 10 it seems to actually blow cool air. This can't be normal right? I remember once a few months ago preheating with these settings and it was super toasty. I feel like it's not working as well anymore. Can someone crank theirs up to 10 on HI and let me know if it's hot or warm or even cool like mine? Yet like I mentioned if I set to 70 on auto the car gets comfortable but never too hot.
"Just a question since i dont own a car and havent looked into other cars than tesla. I am in love with my motorcycle.

But people often mention the preheating for electric cars as a benefit. Other cars like the leaf do that as well. 

do ICE cars dont have that feature. IIRC the berlingo from my foster mom 10 years ago had this feature"
That's good news. My current car takes close to half an hour to warm up the baby seat at -32 C.
Is there a way to preschedule cabin temperature?  Like run it at 8:00am for 15 mins and 4:45 for another 15 mins.
Amazing feature as I freeze my butt off in my auto started car.
That's great stuff! Is it possible to set the car on a timer so it's always warmed up to around 70 degrees by like 5:15am?  
Xs max
"The heating is one of the many things I’ve been impressed with, even on the coldest days it heats up quickly. 

Sadly it also leads to one of my disappointments, the efficiency in weather sub 35 degrees is probably half of the range. And there is no way I’m going to drive, 70 miles in 10 degree weather with just heated seats. 

"
"I'm cold at 72 during the winter. Summer it is warm enough. Fall and Spring good luck finding a temp. I like 73/74 ish in winter.

I'd use seat heater more if my legs didn't freeze off. I need a blanket if I keep to 68-70 with it cold out. Seems drafty on the highway"
...Required on the model 3 in a snowy climate if you want to be able to close your door when you drive :]

82 is never comfy in a car. That’s hell. 
"Here's a video representation of what it looks like:

https://youtu.be/pXDBi5hd2gk

"
HVAC is maybe he one area where electric will never beat ICE.
How does this compare to others
What's that in normal degrees?
"Plus the additional 8 minutes to wake the car...

I wish the Model 3 had an ""always connected"" option like the Model S. "
Million dollar question: how do you get defrost to come on? Mine NEVER does this. 
"8 minutes to 80 degrees but that doesn’t mean you should be driving just yet. The battery and other components may not be sufficiently warm and use during this period may shorten their lifespan. Remember kids, preheat your car for your car’s sake too. Don’t be selfish. "
I’d say 15 min or so 
[deleted]
Almost as normal as combustion cars. 
I wish they let us heat the seats too
"is this considered good for a midsized electric sedan 

seems a bit slow compared to the gas sedans I’ve owned but I can’t say I ever actually timed them "
"And it will not be able to keep up when you start moving. 

Why is this a post? It's a resistive heater. "
How much is this in degrees? 
Good point 
"I love how quick it is, I hate how I lose 5% just by preheating in these fridig temps. "
Exactly. 8 minutes to comfortable and another 8 to hot. I love not needing a giant coat on. 
"82 is nearly unbearable in the winter. That's basically shorts, t-shirt, and no shoes on temperature."
"Do you not have a way to schedule the car to warm itself up in the morning? At least on weekdays; have it warm itself and stay warm for 10 minutes, then turn off the system if you don't use the car."
Imo anything over 21°C (about 70°F) feels too hot and dry.
"72°F is cold in the summer, but feels way too hot in the winter. "
Do you have an iPhone? You could make a shortcut and make Siri do it for you.
"So my coworker claims it's more efficient to heat the car using the battery first then drive it, than to drive it cold in the winter. This feels completely counter-intuitive to me. Do you get 8% more efficiency for the whole trip by preheating?"
"Yeah, as long as it’s connected to something "
"Interesting to note, if several people tried this with ICE  in an enclosed, (say underground) garage, it could pissed people off because of fumes."
Door handles not having heating and the placement of the emergency latch in the front doors are the only two design flaws I’ve noticed after ten months and 22k miles of ownership 
"That was my main question: how long from turning on to having door handles that aren’t frozen?

"
Is that okay for the interior?
"Hopefully Tesla will open up the app for Siri shortcuts, IFTTT, etc"
You can work TeslaFi if you feel like using and paying ($5/month) for that service. 
"On my prior car I added a device that let me do this with just the in-app remote start.  I couldn't explicitly turn on the heater - but if it's cold in the morning then I probably had the heater on when I parked it the night before, so it'll just follow that setting."
I haven’t timed it but seems about the same.
If you use anything else you lose half your range! (I have a 2013). The heated steering wheel plus seats on low is just enough. 
72° is what I actually heat it to. I just wanted to see how much higher it would get in another 8 minutes. 
"None, because it was plugged in. Testing that tomorrow but it will be about 18° instead of 12°"
"75kwh battery, ~5kw heater will run about 15 hours max heat.  Op said 8 minutes so that is just under 1% of the battery. "
Do you live in a colder area? My parents in Florida put on a jacket below 70° now 😄
"Shit man, when its cold outside I set mine to 78"
I live in North Carolina so this isn’t our normal temperatures. Just happens occasionally during the middle of winter. 
This was plugged in so no loss. Tried today unplugged (but wasn’t quite as cold) and [lost 3 miles of range in five minutes going from 24° to 72°](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs8BLZqFnKh/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=76u5px4qqfed) 
It doesn’t have to be plugged in.  And the battery % lost is close to 0
At least it doesn't come with 100% humidity
No loss because it’s plugged in. Testing not plugged in tomorrow morning. 
Why did you have to burn off battery? Did it go all the way to 100% with you not planning to travel for a couple of days?
Huh?   Please elaborate 
I noticed the same. I think it's just the air intake sucking in more cold air than it can heat when it first starts going. If you put it on recirculate it almost immediately gets warm. 
"> do ICE cars dont have that feature. IIRC the berlingo from my foster mom 10 years ago had this feature

The answer is ""yes, they do"", but with caveats. First, obviously not all do. More to the point, you might need a higher trim or subscribe to some service that is free with Tesla (AFAIK). But there are also functionality improvements. You can preheat even in an enclosed garage without having to worry about emissions. And at least in my experience, an idling ICE will take a very long time to actually *really* warm up, and maybe never will; you have to actually start putting it under load and driving it. In my experience, even going 25 mph or slow will result in it taking a long time; you need to get it up to 35 or 40 mph before it starts warming up at a reasonable pace. I don't have a Tesla so can't really compare, but I doubt my old Civic would have been able to warm up in 8 minutes of idling."
"Along with other points, an ICE car can't do this in a closed garage for obvious reasons."
With Remote S app (3rd party) and IFTTT you probably could do anything 
With the Remote S app (3rd party) and IFTTT 
None when plugged in. A few miles lost when not plugged in. 
I agree! 72° was the one I referred to as comfy
That's near 28 C!
"-11, 22, 28 "
Haha. Mine takes maybe a minute to connect (WiFi) but before October usually took 10 seconds tops. 
It does it on its own. I THINK maybe it comes on only if the camera has fog/frost in front of it. I haven’t verified that yet. 
It took 16 minutes from 12 to 82 which are on the more extreme ends of the spectrum 
Google
Better than an ICE car since the hot air comes on almost right away.
Yeah but that heat in an ICE will come out at like 200*F LOL. Nothing better when you're frozen to the bone.
"most of which you have to go outside and start though, and then wait for the engine to get warm before the cabin starts warming up"
It does
Seats all have separate preheat settings from the app
They do for Model S
Every gas car I’ve owned took 30 minutes to be comfortable at those temperatures and usually wouldn’t really blow hot air until I drove it a couple miles. Idling it was just lukewarm air. 
"Also, what do you mean won’t be able to keep up? Mine stays warm just fine. "
Some people were interested in knowing how quickly the car preheats from cold and it was pretty cold this morning so I timed it
"> And it will not be able to keep up when you start moving.

Haven't had this issue with my vehicle. It maintains temps just fine while driving, both short and long distances. Sounds like an HVAC issue with that car."
It was about this cold here this morning. Didn't preheat and it took about as long to heat up while driving: 8 minutes or so.
"That seems like a lot, does it really take that much energy?"
I'm not very familiar with how it works but surely it wouldn't make a difference if you preheat or heat on the go. Or did you mean having to use it 5% just on heating in general? 
5% of your battery over how long of a time span? Just 3-8 minutes also?
what’s frigid
I keep mine at 66°. 72° is toasty.
"I used to be like that. Until I was driving my wife to work in late January (Michigan) in my pajamas and slippers and an 85 year old man confused the brake pedal for the gas, t-boning me and driving me into a snowbank. I started dressing smarter after that. Side note this Sunday will be the first anniversary of that crash for me (14 years!) where I'm not on opiates for pain. Spent nearly 5 years weaning myself off them."
"I love Teslas so dont think I am hating or anything. But dont like all cars have heaters that take a few minutes to get everything warm? I have a 2005 c240(so 13-14 year old Mercedes, ie the most unreliable car a normal person can have), and I am warm within a few minutes of starting it up."
My wife would love 82.  Anything below 72 and I get that look!!
"I start feeling like I’m being suffocated with anything higher then 74 tbh. Normally I keep mine at 70*. I spend all my free time in my basement (movie theatre, study, gaming setup is all there) so I’m used a cooler temp even in the winter. "
No there isn't unfortunately. I'm programming something to do exactly that. Also to stop charging at like 50% then charge the rest of the way a few hours before leaving so you don't have the cold battery/regenerative breaking issues. I might make it open source or a free service but I wish there was something like that already. 
"I use TeslaFi.com to do exactly this. Weekday mornings, if my car is at my house and plugged in, HVAC turns on 20 minutes before my normal departure time. "
 CoolTesla.com is in trials
Still doesn’t help with forgetting does it? Lol. I have shortcuts set up already. Just forget to use them 
"Either way your heat comes from battery power. Maybe the coolant loop for the battery/motor also can heat the cabin? But in freezing temperatures doesn’t the heater also heat these components, not cool them? "
"Thermodynamics suggests he is wrong. Now if you are charging it while preheating, and maybe that's what he means ..

If it's outside plugged in and charged fully, I'll change the battery to charge to a higher percentage a few minutes before turning on climate. I think that makes sense from a maximize efficiency standpoint as you have to warm up the battery anyway to charge it and that will also get your air warmer right off the bat when you start the climate



"
"No the energy for heating is gone. The battery and motor won't really get more efficient preheating, not noticeable at least and far away from what you have used preheating.

You can however draw more energy from your battery when it's warmer. You could even say a warmer battery has a higher specific capacity then a very cold one. You still have to recharge all the energy you used before."
">my coworker claims it's more efficient to heat the car using the battery first then drive it, than to drive it cold in the winter

As others have mentioned, you can preserve the energy in the battery by pre-heating while plugged in, but it's still using the same amount of energy - just pulling it from the wall vs the battery.

Also, if you pre-heat (whether plugged in or not), then your driving will be more efficient per mile, because it won't have to use as much energy for heat while driving (just enough to maintain temperature), however, the energy consumed would be the same.  
For example, let's say it takes 2kWh to warm up the interior.  If you then need 275Wh/mi to drive in the cold, you could see 375Wh/mi on the display if you started out cold and drove 20mi (2kWh/20mi = 100Wh/mi), but in the end, you've used the same 2kWh to warm the car, it just changes whether it shows up in the on-screen efficiency rating (in the trip meter)."
"Thanks. Curious, do these connections always stay alive or is there some timeout period (i.e. a few days)? Or is the power use so low that it is not a concern?"
Add to the list awful auto wipers and the interior lighting is too dim. 
It’ll probably experience higher temperatures during the summer. Especially in a Phoenix parking lot!  (I think 140F is common!)
"doubtful. in that temperature, I'd typically lose about 20 miles of the battery doing that"
Nope I’m in Georgia :) it’s 68 in the car year around. 
Thank you for the info. I appreciate the detail

"This is built into all Tesla, so no upgrade required (though all Model 3s currently require the premium upgrade package so yeah). And you’re right, an ICE has to have some load before it gets hot. My previous ICE car, a 2009 Honda Fit, wouldn’t be that warm in 30 minutes idling but about five minutes down the road it would finally blow hot air. "
You'd be surprised. My Civic only lets you run it remotely for 10 minutes. This morning that was enough to melt all of the ice on the windows and make the interior comfortable. 
8 min from 12 to 72 is impressive. 
Impressive indeed.
"It’s been consistently sub 15° here in chi town, horrible "
"Luxury ICE cars (Lexus, you don't need to go up to Rolls Royce) include heating elements to produce heat immediately too - which is the same way Tesla does it. And Tesla is still in the luxury price range. Once you turn the engine on you're producing electricity, so it uses some of that for the heater.

I like Tesla, but let's not pretend that this hasn't been solved before."
"Short winter rides are the worst in ICE. You get there without the engine ever hitting peak efficiency. 

I hate knowing something better exists, but is unobtainable."
I can start my ICE with a app on my phone.
"It's literally a $50 device you can plug into *any* car from the last decade (probably the last 2 decades) and start with a phone app or key fob.

It's also a feature available on many cars, especially in the premium ranges, which is still the Model 3's price point. So that ""most of which..."" Yeah, no.

Electric has it's advantages - especially in winter (the car will *always* start, for example). But remote start isn't one of them."
"Ah yes, usually the car needs to be started with the key but I think a lot of cars have remote start. Is the remote start comes by default for all Teslas? Newer high end cars like Mercedes and others have options for wireless start but they charge a small fee per year, I think. "
"Is this only for the model S? I can’t access my seat heaters via the app only climate

Edit: Model 3 owner"
Yes that seems accurate. If you're plugged into a charger that gives you 30miles/hr turning on the heat will drop that to 3-6miles/hr. 
"I park outside, so when it’s 2°s, it’s quite taxing on the battery to heat up the car"
Preheating while plugged in is more efficient. And don't call me Shirley.
"Its brick, if you speak NY."
69 is the perfect temp
I like mine closer to 78 driving to work in the morning and 68 at most in the way home. It's weird...
/u/DrowningInPussycats  congratulations on kicking your habit! Keep up the good work 
"I live across the lake in Wisconsin. Yesterday, the highest I saw the temperature get was 4 degrees. Even though I warmed the car up before leaving, I still dressed like I was planning to walk several miles in those conditions, thanks to many, many years of my mom nagging, ""what if the car breaks down?""

The car hasn't broken down once in our decade since moving here from Virginia, but if/when it does, I'll be ready"

"Hey neighbor.   
Be safe out there!  "
"Any I’ve driven will heat up fairly quickly once you start driving because then the engine is running harder, but idling in the driveway from a very cold start would take a good 20-30 minutes to completely warm up inside. "
"Haha. Thankfully there are dual zones. I like 68-70 for jacket free comfort while driving in the winter, and 70 for summer driving. The fiancé likes her seat heat all the way up, and the heater blasting at her feet."
"You may already know this, or it might not apply to you, but there are some wifi/smart chargers that let you schedule charging, like the Juicebox. Not exactly what you are looking for, but it's what I'd use in the situation you describe."
"Oh, I haven’t used shortcuts yet, can you pre set them to go off at a certain time?"
"Freezing temperatures can actually damage lithium batteries when put under high strain, running the heater without moving the vehicle theoretically should put less strain on the batteries until the vehicle can heat up to operating temperature. "
"It's actually pretty well known that running Lithium batteries in extremely cold weather can degrade their performance quite rapidly.   

Some commercial drones for example won't let you take off if the battery temperature is below 30F (DJI)

Preheating the car puts less strain on the batteries as opposed to hopping in and cranking up the heater while cruising down the road. 

Although I'm fairly certain Tesla has managed to reduce strain on the batteries for most conditions where extreme freezing temperatures happen only in the middle of winter.  But I know they're still working up in Canada to make the car's more cold-hardy which tells me there's still room for improvement"
"I'm going to be pedantic for a second here. I know you're trying to say the right things with your comment, but I think in a case like this it's important to use the correct nomenclature. Energy/power/capacity can not be used interchangeably. Doing so increases confusion in these topics even further.

> You can however draw more ~~energy~~ power from your battery when it's warmer.

FTFY. Batteries are chemical and heat increases chemical reaction speed, which allows for more energy to be converted from chemical to  electrical every second. Energy/second = power. The total energy you can draw from the cell remains the same, though.

Heat also increases internal resistance to current flow, thus reducing potential power draw. At very low temps, chemical reaction speed limits power draw. At very high temps, the internal resistance limits power draw. There's a happy medium where chemical reaction speed and internal resistance are balanced, which is where the cell will be able to provide maximum power.

> You could even say a warmer battery has a higher specific capacity then a very cold one. 

No, no you could not. Specific capacity does not exist. The term you're looking for is specific energy, which is the amount of energy per unit of mass. This is dependent on battery chemistry, not on temperature.

What you could say is that a warmer battery --up to a point-- has a higher potential output than a very cold one.

> You still have to recharge all the energy you used before.

Yes. 

E:formatting"
The car goes to sleep so when you open the app it can take a minute to wake up and connect
"None of that seems as bad as snow/rain piling into the car when I open the trunk.  Sure hope they figure out a way to fix that.

I feel like the auto wipers can be fixed via software update. 
"My wipers are great. Granted, I had to wash the windshield with vinegar to get the residue off and then applied Aquapel, but now auto wipers are perfect for me. "

"What is doubtful?  All of those numbers in my comment are reasonably accurate.  I didn't see OP run their heater, by 8 mins is inline with what my car needs."
"I'm usually 69, but on days in the teens and 20s (near Asheville), I make it 72 just to warm up the steering wheel"
Basically not enough to worry about. You got a good balance in.
"12 to 60 or so was even more impressive, just a few minutes. I should have taken more screenshots. "
"Quick heat is nice, but the real advantage EVs have is preheating. ICE cars can't do that in an enclosed space like a cold garage.

There's also no way an electric heating element in an ICE car will output anything like the 9kw or more that the tesla heater does. Even a huge 200 amp alternator won't get anywhere near that."
"Interesting, I have never noticed this across new MB and Porsche. Guess I'm too used to it."
Tesla heater is 6-7 kW. Alternator in ICE car is usually around 1kW output.
"To be fair, I can drive my model 3 for 30 minutes and still not have full regen back. So there are tradeoffs for everything "
Yeah. This feature is more about the Tesla being recent and a high-end brand rather than a characteristic of the fact it's a BEV. Even Ford SYNC has it.

"I know you can do after market remote start, and some cars do from the factory, but MOST are still a “go outside and start the car” system. Compile a list of cars that have it from the factory vs those that don’t and look at sales numbers for them all.

"Well it's not technically ""starting"" the car. The car is basically ""on"" all the time, but it goes to sleep, and can only be driven with the phone, key card, key fob or if you hit remote start in the app (this lets someone else drive your car, say if you're away on vacation and you left your car at home and someone needs to move the car).

"Yes, in the Model 3 you should have seat heaters. Make sure your phone app AND Model 3 software are up to date. "

I've found that's too hot with the coats I wear when it's cold out. So I leave autopilot at 69 and order my temp down to 66. 
Agreed. I do 69 all day long. 
Hey Kevin!
"I always bring a coat in case of emergencies, but there's no need to actually *wear* it during normal driving."
[deleted]
I always at least bring a coat and throw it in the back.  Not gonna sit in a super heavy coat in the drivers seat for an hour or two.
"Oh, so opiods are the gateway drug now?"
Idk if this is like disgusting for the engine/car but I just rev it like 3 times while its sitting to increase the temps a bit faster. But I do see what you mean now if you are letting your car warm up in the driveway
My fiancé as well. Belastning the ass heater to a point it's starting to smell bacon. I don't know how she endures the torture.
"Correct! You can even do it via your Tesla directly but they don't give you the same fine tuned control an app would. You'd have to be content to simply deal with it on a fixed schedule and then in the case of the stock software reset it each day if you were to charge somewhere else. I'd prefer something automated so I don't have to hassle with it. Great suggestion though.

Edit: too many periods."
"Not that I know of. I believe they are just shortcuts that work with “hey Siri, do x” and it executed a combination of things that you have preset "
Teslas know how their batteries react to different conditions and will do whatever is necessary to protect the battery. They'll limit the power you can draw from the battery to a level that won't hurt it. You don't have to worry about it yourself.
"Sorry, who is working on that, and where did you get the information? Agree that it needs improving."
"Cold limits the power you can get from the battery. If you drive a Tesla with an extremely cold battery, you'll get an alert saying that full power is not available. That's a serious problem for a drone, because they need to pull a ton of power just to stay airborne. It's a minor inconvenience for a quick car, where the max power output is 10-20x what you need for cruising.

Cold also limits the energy you can get from the battery. If you drive a Tesla with an extremely cold battery, it'll show part of the battery gauge in a different color, indicating the portion that's inaccessible. This is, however, a temporary condition and you can access it once the battery warms up.

The only reason it might be more efficient to warm up the battery before driving would be the use of regenerative braking, and there's no way it makes enough of a difference to make up for the extra energy lost from heating early."
"> There's a happy medium where chemical reaction speed and internal resistance are balanced, which is where the cell will be able to provide maximum power.

And as an elaboration, the same thing works in reverse of course -- that's where you can stuff energy back into the battery the fastest as well."
"To be fair your wrong. They do limit capacity due to safety parameters etc. A battery is not like a glass of water where you just get X amount fast or slow. Depending on discharge speed, temperatures etc. The experienced output in kWh on something this big varies quite significantly. Hence the both perceived loss in range/capacity with the blue markings and motor power.

Pre-charging a big significant procentage of total capacity just before you would start pre-heating in the morning will help and be optimal since the else car would have to heat the battery too besides cabin and functional heating required for realistic everyday driving. It will require power but some would be used to heat car at charging time anyways so you save a little and gain best range and performance"
When it bothers to wake up. Mine won't at least half the time. 
"Is it any faster when charging? I'd imagine they could always stay connected in that case, but maybe they decided not to do that. A phone has a much smaller battery and can be in standby for 24 hours. Tesla's computer probably does not have a super low power mode though."
That’s already fixed newer model 3s have a different seal
"Did you apply the Aquapel over the front camera part of the windshield? I applied RainX over the whole windshield, and it caused the auto wipers to constantly run if there was even a tiny bit of rain. I got most of it off of the glass in front of the cameras, and it works better now, but they still wipe far too often.

I love the RainX effect, I don't even need wipers if I'm going >40 mph, but I'm thinking of trying Aquapel next time

"[Not the person you replied to]

I wouldn't want to live in Phoenix either, but you'll get temperatures 30 or 40 degrees F above ambient in the sun, so the temperature doesn't even need to be very warm at all outside to get to 107F in your car.

""Previous studies found that on days when ambient temperatures exceeded 86°F, the internal temperatures of the vehicle quickly reached 134 to 154°F.  ...

"> Compile a list of cars that have it from the factory vs those that don’t and look at sales numbers for them all.

I googled it just to see if anyone made a list; there is one top-10 list but it's slideshow format (yeah let's skip that), so here's Google's preview:

> 2016 Ford Mustang. ...
2016 Mazda3. ...
2016 Toyota Camry. ...
2016 Lincoln MKZ. ...
2016 Chevrolet Camaro. ...
2016 Hyundai Sonata Sport Premium. ...
2016 Subaru Impreza. ...
2016 Dodge Challenger.

The slideshow is https://www.autobytel.com/car-buying-guides/features/10-best-cars-with-remote-start-131162/ just so you can verify. I also know it's been on Lexus for years, as I have it on mine.

If it's on a Mazda3, Camry, and a *Hyundai* - it's mainstream. Even Dodge offers it. And sure it may not be standard, but last time I spec'd a new non-luxury car on that list it wasn't a separate option, so it must have been a part of some trim packages. That makes it pretty common in my mind. It *should* be standard, like power windows and AC. But on the other hand, it'll work a lot faster on those other cars than on the Tesla. Because you have to wait the 3+ months for the Tesla to be delivered to you.

(I know that's a low blow, but it's true!)"
[deleted]
Oh I see. Had no idea that the only way to start a Tesla is through the app or the card. Sounds cool
Only until it gets to the specified temperature then it only drops the charge rate by  a couple mph
Not a typo :(
"Referring to charge rate in mi/hr is really arbitrary for me especially when I'm curious how much power does the onboard heater use in actual kW, not mi/hr. From there is should be straightforward to analyze all the power attributes of the car from the power going in and the power being consumed."
120v can only put out about 1kW or 1.5kW when at 20amps.  Not nearly enough to sustain the on-board heater.
I hope that’s Celsius
19.5 is fine in the winter.
"Yeah, 66ºF/19ºC seems like a good temperature if you leave on your coat, and you don't have to bother making the cabin warmer."
Couple of years ago my car broke down. I called the national roadside assistance hotline. They told me I had to wait 60-90 minutes before they would get a car to where i was. Pretty happy I had a warm coat with me while it as -10 degrees c.
Cell phones or not you can still get stranded in the snow.

"Yes, Tesla might decide to limit the amount of energy and/or power that gets put in or taken out of the battery depending on various parameters. It's quite possible Tesla limits (dis)charging the cells (and the rate at which it occurs) past certain levels to prolong their useful life. That doesn't mean any of what I said is wrong.

A battery can hold a specific amount of energy. Disregarding aging, this amount of energy is fixed. The *rate* at which you can get energy out or put energy in (without damaging the cell) is determined by the internal resistance of the cell, the voltage a cell can work at, and the speed at which the chemical reaction can occur. Two of those are dependent on temperature. The total amount of energy is only determined by battery chemistry and construction. None of those are dependent on temperature.

As mentioned in the first paragraph of my previous comment: I'm not correcting anyone on specific procedures regarding the Tesla battery pack and the way their software allows you to charge (or not charge) it. I'm merely trying to use the correct nomenclature, so people actually get the right explanation of why a battery works the way it works. Using the wrong words helps no one and only spreads more confusion about the topic. 

> Pre-charging a big significant procentage of total capacity just before you would start pre-heating in the morning will help and be optimal since the else car would have to heat the battery too besides cabin and functional heating required for realistic everyday driving. It will require power but some would be used to heat car at charging time anyways so you save a little and gain best range and performance

Again, none of this is in contrast to anything I've said. I don't see why you think I'm wrong about any of this. You basically explained the practical implication of my sentence above:

> What you could say is that a warmer battery --up to a point-- has a higher potential output than a very cold one.

By pre-charging you can heat up the batteries without consuming battery power. You need heated batteries because they can't deliver the necessary power when very cold.

> To be fair your wrong. 

But... why?"

"OK, I knew about that, for some reason I thought that you were talking specifically about model 3. I'm sure they *are* working on upgrades to the 3 as well."
">A battery can hold a specific amount of energy. Disregarding aging, this amount of energy is fixed.

That's not correct:

""Cold temperature increases the internal resistance **and** lowers the capacity. A battery that provides 100 percent capacity at **27°C** (**80°F**) will typically deliver only 50 percent at –**18°C** (**0°F**). The momentary capacity-decrease differs with battery chemistry.""

Source: [https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/discharging\_at\_high\_and\_low\_temperatures](https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/discharging_at_high_and_low_temperatures)

For example the ""75 Kwh Battery"" Tesla is defined at regular 20°C I guess. The Battery capacity is **heavily** depended on the temperature and not fixed."

"Having to use the brakes, you actually notice that they make a little tiny bit of noise when used. Almost imperceptible, but there nonetheless. Which makes sense since brakes are friction-based of course, you just can't hear them in a normal car due to engine noise drowning it out."
"You could get a Cadillac in the 90s that had remote start. But it was just a super long range remote(couple hundred yards), not an app on your phone that works from across the country. "
"You may be right about the cold start factor, I didn't find a source but I wouldn't be surprised. I wouldn't risk it either personally - unless the system also opened the garage door when starting the car, which would alleviate any risk. But then you'd need to use the reversing camera with custom software to verify that the door is actually open - that just gets too complicated and only a complete geek would make a system like that."
The heater is way stronger than your average space heater.
"I understand it's better to use different units that the average consumer can understand. It's why Tesla changed the nomenclature scheme of their cars to generic terms instead of numbers representing kWh battery capacity.

But using miles and miles/hr has so many variables attached to it that it creates confusion and misunderstandings all the time when someone complains how their car said it has X miles of range but only got X miles and think something is broken."
"Or from a place where, regardless of cell phones, you can get stuck for 8 hours on the highway because it's snowed 30cm in an hour."
"As I mentioned in my first comment, the other day there high was 4 degrees. Though I didn't mention above that the wind chill was down around -15. At that temperature, hypothermia can be fatal in [as little as 20 minutes.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-frostbite-or-hypothermia-2014-1) I'm not comfortable betting my life on a tow truck arriving in 20 minutes, so I think I'll keep wearing my coat in the car."
"I’m just having a lot of trouble wrapping my brain around this. Does that mean you can have a battery that normally holds 10 kwh, cool it down, drain 1 kwh from it, warm it back up, now it only holds 8kwh?"
Super annoying how he jerks the camera up when he opens the trunk and never zooms in where the water would actually have fallen.  It's when you open it that the water falls into the trunk not when you have it open
"I wish mine were hardly noticeable all the time... Coming to a stop in a drive-thru is often full of screeching and loud enough to make me cringe. I get that it's because the rotors aren't completely clean from not being used much, but it is much louder than my 20 year old car with old brakes. Maybe it's the extra weight of the Model 3 or something... "
"Good question.

I am not an expert on that topic but I think you are wrong on that one as well. Well not completly. Because of the  internal resistance  you will have more leaked energy during that process but if you heat the Battery back up you should still have close to the 9kwh.

You can think about it as honey. If flows much slower at colder temperatures and you will end up with some sticking at the sides of the bottle. Once you heat it back up you can also make most of the sticky honey of the sides moving and it also flows faster. 

And it's really the ability to have motion inside the Li-Io cell in the end.  It's not that something is really moving or even flowing inside a cell. I read something about it a year or two ago when I searched for it.

If there is somebody how really knows what is going on inside a cell during temp. shifts I would be curious if my understanding is correct."
"Not saying you're wrong, but I can't see how that would be. However, I don't think this gets rid of the problem of snow sliding off the window. Of course, you can sweep that off *before* opening."
"Huh mine don't make much noise, I'm sure similar to a regular vehicle. Just happens to not have engine noise to cover it. Picked up my Model 3 at the end of September, just over 6000 miles on it so far."

"Yes, which car seat is this? Looks huge. "
Is it easy to clean? Would you recommend the white seats for parents with 2 year olds?
I got this seat protector for mine: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MXQJWRA/
"I have a 09 yukon , only 2 of the 4 seats have the connectors, and the others don't have ratcheting belts.  How can a car that MSRP's for 80k (I paid used nowhere near that) not have those simple things. 

When I strap them in I do my damndest to break the belts.  There are permanent indentations in the seat now.   If only I could get the one to stop pushing the belt releases.  "
"I commented elsewhere, but the model 3 manual also recommends connecting a child seat on the left or right, NOT in the middle. The latch connector mounts are not made to be used how you have them in the video. We have our little guy on the right, and rear facing. Safest possible."
[deleted]
Yeah plus the model 3 instruction manual recommends against connecting a child seat in the middle. It should be on left or right.
"It's easy to clean, I just notice now that I have to clean more often to keep it looking nice.  Since every little dark speck/spudge shows up more prominently on white.  It just feels like it gets dirtier quicker.

&#x200B;"
"NO DO NOT USE THESE! The rubber will actually discolor your seats. TAKE THEM OFF NOW. I can’t remove the black stains off mine. 

Use a white towel. Change every once in a while. "
This is the correct answer. Some cars will allow this stating in their manuals but not the Model 3. Also rear facing for as long as possible. Graco has the Extend2Fit for this reason.
"^this

Recommendations are to now rear-face for as long as possible (using the right seat and proper mounting, of course.)"
"Agreed - rear facing is the best as long as the child will stay with it (within size limits):

> The American Academy of Pediatrics used to recommend rear-facing seats for children until at least age 2. Now, the organization is updating its guidelines and wants parents to keep their children in rear-facing seats until they reach the seat's maximum height and weight limit — even if they're older than 2"
Then you wouldn't want to accelerate much. The EV torque can hit 1G and for a toddler it could cause serious injury in a rear facing for the same reason front facing allows for injury when you collide with a solid object in front of you.
Yes! I’ve got a toddler also and I just want to get in there and fix this seat!
Not sure why it would recommend against this as a rear facing seat is safest in the middle. It will be equidistant to both sides in a side impact collision. 
Very happy to hear you say that since I pick mine up tomorrow and I got the white seats as well
"I'm been using mine for 6+ months, no issues..."

"Of course, a collision from the rear can cause injury in a rear-facing seat too then. 

Maybe everyone should be forced to discard their current baby seats and buy ones with special air bags - plus a pair of ear protectors for when these air bags go off beside the baby's head..."
because that's not what's important. What's important is the position and angular strength of the Latch system connectors. 
I have white seats for over 1.5 years. Very happy. Not cleaned them and they look new. My kids are > 12 years old. You will be happy with white seats. They look sharp.
"Very similar brands, these were the ones that discolored my seats.

It also discolored the cup holder between the seats. 3rd row. "
So... autonomy. Should we all be in rear facing seats once it's the norm?
I have no doubt you are correct. But having had a baby in a car seat for several years and watching how they cannot lift their heads against light acceleration when rear facing... I can tell you that you would have to stay in chill mode in a Performance Tesla. 
"Yea, people forget the laws are arranged around probabilities. Rear facing is typically safer based on reviews of many accidents, but not guaranteed safer. The simple math is that some collisions are single vehicle into fixed object vs. vehicle into another vehicle. By that logic alone, more collisions are into something in front of you, so we get rear-facing car seat laws for people who may never run into anything and only get hit by other drivers."
"If all cars are AI controlled, and talking to each other(prevent the drive under the semi death), seat belts may be optional.  With 5G each car could update the road reference map every time it drives that stretch of road.  DMV vehicles may have lidar/radar/IR scanners mounted and paid for by Tesla to scan each change to each lane.  IE move some blocks for construction and drive up and down it in each lane, to make a master lane route.  Prevent that one death where the car jerked into the jersey barrier.  "
"In the future, we will see seat arrangements like those 1950's glass bubble cars in futuristic imaginings, the front seats facing backward with a table in between like some rail car arrangements.  Of course, with memory system, shake sensors, and communication with other cars, the AI voice will tell you when the road ahead will be too rough to have open beverages on the table. ""Chug down and buckle up, the next four miles will be bumpy!"" This info will be relayed to the local municipality to tell them where potholes need to be fixed. 
The AI will also communicate with other cars - ""That red car over there is an antique without computer control - steer clear of it and watch for unpredictable behaviour."" Manual drivers in the future will assume the self-driving cars in the future will avoid collisions with them, so they drive like idiots and don't stop at intersections... until they collide with the only other manual driver on the road, thus reducing the manual driver population of people and/or cars. "
Wow! Glad you’re safe OP and wtg Tesla safety 
"I can never accurately judge speeds from how narrow the FOV is on the built in dash cam, but that almost seems like everyone was going too fast."
"Were you using EAP or did it take over?  I realize that’s a dumb question, but I don’t want to test the collision avoidance features if I don’t need to!"
I just fell in love with my car all over again. 
"holy shit, that was a close call!"
Did it steer as well?
Rwd or awd?
"Where was that black van in the lane to your right when you/EAP swerved into his lane? Had he already braked and was way back, or switched over another lane, or was he cutoff? Would the EAP know he was there or not there and make react accordingly? "
"Is there EVER a situation where EAP will steer you out of your lane automatically?  I know it will brake, but I didn’t know we were at the point where it would autonomously change lanes to avoid a situation. "
What tires do you have?
This looks like it was in Colorado! It was horrible here yesterday 
Well … do not drive too fast next time!
"The model 3 did pretty well. But my question is, do you need EAP to have safety features? Like collision avoidance? If so that doesn't make much sense."
I freakin... love that car!
Driving way too fast for conditions!!!!!!! Hopefully this helped you learn your lesson and doesn’t further embolden you. 
Where was this?
"Did it swerve for you like that?

&#x200B;"
"Very irresponsible people to drive that fast in snow. Your car missed it, but tell me what happened after you. Did you turn on warning lights quickly or just drove forward without care?"
The other car braked too so what's the deal? 
What setting do you have the auto braking set too? Glad you avoided this!
"Wow, it's like Dirt-3's brake and steering assist, but in real life! 😂"
Those conditions are just awful. I would probably stay at home rather than driving if I could avoid it 
"That. Is. Awesome. Coming from a BMW person, some of the safety features in Teslas are top of the line. Glad you're safe, and yes, be careful out there!"
Radar equipped cars since 2000s do it. Most cars have it today like Mercedes Distronic front star. No autopilot needed for it. The question is how Tesla discovered it. Tesla should have Distronic. Without it it is way more dangerous. Camera is much worse than radar in discovering dangers.
Looking at how fast you're passing the vehicle on the right you were going way too fast for the conditions.... just sayin'
"Tesla responded well, maybe the driver would have an accident. Normal weather for Russia. Where is the snow storm driver saw that? The situation on the roads may be complicated by the fact that they do not comply with the speed limit and poorly clean the roads.

"At least four people got super lucky/good that day.

2) driver of the Caravan on the right lane. Must have seen it coming and brakes or left enough room for 3 to clear the stopped car
3) professional stunt pilot of white car in front of 3
4) car to the right of professional stunt pilot (aka Balls Of Steel) who was not at the wrong place at the wrong time and allow him to dodge the stopped car while not being hit hard. 

Sometimes it’s just not your time to go. "
"I have been killing boredom late at night watching dash cam crash video for a couple years and have gotten to where I can usually tell what sort of crash and who will be involved several seconds before the event. Things I learned: driving too fast for conditions is the default. This is proven from time to time by a pile of wrecked cars.

So yeah, OP was cruising along with all the other traffic into very limited visibility and low traction and almost certainly would have crashed without the cars intervention or at best spun trying to swerve. Pretty amazing how effective the Tesla systems are working together."
" Herd instinct is strong in Humans. 

I was driving in heavy rain and lots of traffic with traffic jams on and off.

Guess what, everyone in the left lane was speeding up to 100+ km/h even if it was obvious that there will be more traffic jam ahead.

I was in the right lane taking it easy around 50 km/h because i already saw cars standing still about 500 meter ahead. My vehicle was heavy, still i barley needed to break, just get of the gas and let it rolling until i stand still (hello fuel efficiency). 

Guess what, the last ""unlucky"" (stupid) guy actually managed to tailgate on the left lane. Enough to have the car heavily damaged, not enough to seriously get hurt. 

I was just happy i was already passed them. 

People are unbelievably stupid, especially in groups. Never speed up if you are uncomfortable even when everyone around you does."
"I don’t think I was using EAP,  but I may have been,  it started to brake before the stopped car came into view. When I swerved to right I could feel the Tesla keeping us straight avoiding a spin out like the car in front of us.  I felt like I was the best driver in the world threading the needle. But now that I think about it it may have been the Tesla doing the driving ha ha."
"I've tested auto collision prevention or avoidance few times. It engages without having to have EAP on. (Model S P100D)

Having collision avoidance always on is a great feature to have. One exception though it doesn't work sideways. So if someone is merging lane with you and you're in the blind spot it won't save you. Be aware. Even when EAP is engaged sideways or lateral collision avoidance doesn't work very well if at all."
It doesn’t matter

"AWD will not help when it comes to stopping, people!"
"The van was right next to me I expected to hit the van so I would miss the stopped car, luckily the van scooted over onto the shoulder just enough."
"IMHO the system saw the car next to him and came as near as it is programmed to go, but the van then moved more to the right and so did the EAP. That's why you can see it moved to the right twice. IMHO."
"Not EAP in my case, but the car did swerve out of the way of a flatbed semi that was cutting in front of me, while next to me."

"By now you'd think drivers in Colordado would know when a road is undrivable because they don't have chains, but apparently they'll still insist on going for it... and thus crossing three lanes to side-swipe you. Bless them."
you don't need EAP to have safety features. 
Not to my eyes.
"""Professional stunt pilot"" cracked me laughing. Really underrated comment!"
Very underrated comment!

99% of accidents are because of driving too fast for conditions and following too close. 
"The only driver better than you that day was the white car with Matrix-like reflexes. How he avoided it, I have no clue, unless he really didn’t and actually hit the car that went into the wall. Great job! I love these videos. Glad to know the Tesla (and you all) live to see another day. 🙂"
how do you not know if you had EAP enabled or not? Were you driving or was EAP enabled? 
"I think ""feel the Tesla keeping us straight avoiding a spin out "" is just ESP doing single-wheel braking."
You don’t know? What?! 
Thank you for sharing this. It's beautiful. 
The blind spot thing is good to know.  I’m starting to notice that I pay more attention with EAP on than most drivers who don’t have a similar feature.
"You didn’t have EAP turned on, but the car swerved out of the lane to avoid a car automatically??"
The Primacy MXM4?!
The in this case I'd say it's safe to say that it wasn't EAP that took over the car. 
I am guessing the electronic stability systems were working overtime in that car....
Granted. 
"Distracted driving is actually #1. People not seeing the other vehicle (especially motorcycles), drunk driving, and running red lights also kills a lot of people. What you've listed accounts for just less than 10%. Source: [https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811059](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811059)"
"99.9%  I always leave three car lengths and someone always fills it in. So I give three car lengths again. 40 years driving, never touched another car.   


I signal for at least 10 seconds before changing lanes. Even if you don't want me to come over, you can't say I din't warn you."
"I was trying to gauge whether he hit or not but I can't tell.

&#x200B;

Although, the actual best driver that day was way behind all of them, travelling at a speed where he had visibility for more than 1 second of travel time"
"It was a 6 hour drive 3 days ago, There were times when AP would not work due to weather, and other sections where it did work, when this happened I was so happy we didn’t crash, adrenaline rush and heart pounding I high fived my wife and didn’t think about AP "
"I believe this is more probable than EAP still navigating during that swerve. OP mentioned of swerving manually. The car is trying to keep traction stability in the snowy and icy condition during the swerving. This is because in my experience with autopilot, once the steering wheel is yanked on to swerve into another lane, autopilot automatically disengages every time.

Btw u/thenext44 you were lucky not to cause a collision with the black minivan that was in the lane you swerved into. I think this is a good learning experience for you to recognize and pay more attention to your surroundings like when all three cars hit the brakes, something needs your immediate attention.

Glad that autopilot safety feature caught your attention due to your lack of quick reaction. :)"
"In snowy conditions, like the OP poated, I turn EAP on and off, or it turns itself off. So yeah, very plausible he didn't know at that moment. Don't judge until you drive in those conditions.
And if you're wondering why anyone would turn it off, I noticed the car couldn't tell lane markings (severely covered in snow) and EAP would steer me to close to one or the other, so I'd turn it off for manual control."
Yes.  I believe it's part of the side collision detection.
"Some discussions about it.

https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/side-collision-avoidance.121320/"
Yes.
"I am not sure you are interpreting this correct. 

I assume you speak about fatal crashes leading to death. In this case your statement makes sense.

But i think it is more complicated.

For instance ""Critical Reasons for Critical Pre-Crash Event Attributed to Roadway and Atmospheric Conditions "":  
49.6% of Accidents are on ""Slick roads (ice, loose debris, etc.)""

  "
"I do it similarly, although I only have under 5 years of exp in driving I do tend to signal at least 5 seconds or more until I switch lanes. "
"The faster you go, the more room you need to leave.  Three car lengths isn't always the best."
"Glad your ok, but for future reference, if EAP is on the border of working and not working due to weather conditions, you probably shouldn’t use it. At least, that’s my rule of thumb. 

Either way, whether you were using it or not, it still would have done the same emergency braking procedure. "
Someone from Tesla could verify one way or the other.
" **Electronic stability control** (**ESC**), also referred to as **electronic stability program** (**ESP**) or **dynamic stability control** (**DSC**), is a computerized technology that improves a vehicle's stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction (skidding). When ESC detects loss of steering control, it automatically applies the brakes to help ""steer"" the vehicle where the driver intends to go. Braking is automatically applied to wheels individually, such as the outer front wheel to counter oversteer or the inner rear wheel to counter understeer. Some ESC systems also reduce engine power until control is regained. ESC does not improve a vehicle's cornering performance; instead, it helps to minimize the loss of control.

The last post there indicates the car will stay in the lane?
"Check out the table on page 30 (or just do a ctrl+f for ""speed"" and review all occurrences).

The numbers in table 9a dominate the numbers in table 9c that you mentioned. I definitely could be wrong about something, but I'm not seeing anywhere that I am significantly off at this point."
Same here. I also don't use it any time there is a possibility of black ice or slippery conditions.
"I can't speak for other's experience, but in my case it wasn't."
