F*ck cancer! Congrats and best of luck with your health and your beautiful new S!
Good for you! On both counts...
"#Wish I could buy some 2013 TSLA shares.

Lol"
Congrats on beating cancer; IMHO that's well more congrats worthy than any car (I like your pick though).
Congrats! I always get excited when I see a Model S.
"Congratulations on telling caner to fuck the right off! About the car, fast charging, yes or no?"
FUCK YEAH YOU DID
Congrats on beating cancer! I'm glad you are still around to enjoy the car. What's the estimated battery life on a used Tesla? I'm going to be in the market in August and have wondered about getting a used Tesla.
"Good for you. I know that I do not know you, but I don‚Äôt need to know you to know that you really deserve it. I hope that you stay healthy and cancer free and please enjoy that gorgeous car for me. Go further and get the full auto pilot. Fuck it. I‚Äôm jealous like a mofo!"
Congrats. Welcome to the Tesla family
"I swear, the original styling of the Model S is so timeless. I think it looks way sexier than the newer Model S. Such a gorgeous car...whenever I get one as a loaner, I just stare at it constantly. Lol congrats, buddy amd welcome to the family!"
Victory!!!
"Grats, how's the battery capacity?"
Cancer can‚Äôt catch you now!!  So fast
Congrats! üéäüéàüéâ
That is awesome. I would love to upgrade to a Model S.
Unfortunately you‚Äôre gonna give yourself a heart attack errtime you floor it.
When I beat cancer I lost two fingers and bought a drum set. This is also awesome.
"Holy shit congrats on both!

But also wow i did not realize Tesla Model S released in 2013. Thats fucking rad

Congrats again friend. All the strength to you"
#FUCK CANCER! Enjoy the ride of your life üòé
Everything I've done in the 23 years since being declared cured has been a big FUCK YOU to cancer. Congrats! Now you have the rest of your life to do all of the things you have earned. Make the best of it and tell people often. You never know who may need the hope that your story will provide. I've spent the last four years building a 406 whp Forester STI clone.
"Sitting in the hospital now getting a cancerous tonsil removed. This thread is inspiration, because all I've been looking at recently was a used galaxy S10.

Need to step my game up. Good luck with the Tesla, it looks beautiful!"
Congrats
Congratulations!!! May you remain in health and THOROUGHLY enjoy your gift!

Cancer is walking around with a sore ass thanks to your foot. Congrats on your recovery and enjoy the ride.

Congrats!!  It looks awesome
Not to be a predator but how much was it?
Congrats! I bought a 4Runner for mine. When you drive it fell good! What a damn journey! F cancer! I‚Äôm 3years out.
Congrats on beating cancer!! You deserve the reward!
Dude can afford to beat cancer and a tesla. No wonder he fought so hard to live
"Damn, she is a beaut!! Fuck cancer, and you keep it classy on the roads!"
Congrats!
You paid for cancer treatment and still had enough left over for a Model S?
Congrats on the new ride and fuck cancer
Congratulations man!  That looks beautiful!  Enjoy it!
"What wonderful news, I'm so happy for you that you made it through such darkness and fear, and here you are back on the trampoline again.  I hope you have many beautiful adventures in your fabulous car!!!"
"Dang, I just applied to adopt an ""I beat cancer"" kitten, maybe I need to start dreaming bigger. Congrats!"
Congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Yaaaasss buddy, slay!!"
Congratulations on beating cancer - such a horrific disease.  Enjoy your ride!!!
Those wheels ü§§
I told myself I would do that and I never ended up doing out. Congrats on beating cancer!!
"Very jely! Congrats though :D

&#x200B;

I have a baby EV (MG ZS EV) and every time a tesla rolls by i'm like ""Hi there big brother! One day....!"""
"When my wife beat cancer I decided life it to short to drive a boring car. We both love our Tesla. 

Congratulations to beating cancer."
"Fuck cancer bruh!!! Enjoy that sweet car, I secretly love that nose cone so rock on"
"Fantastic!

FUCK CANCER"
Congratulations on beating cancer and for obtaining such an amazing car!
I‚Äôve been visiting this sub for a long time and this is THE BEST ‚Äúlook at my new Tesla‚Äù post I‚Äôve ever seen!!!
"A dear friend and mentor of mine was excited to buy a Model S, but put off the purchase when he got his cancer diagnosis.  Unfortunately he never got to fulfill that dream, losing his battle only a few months later.  This brought a smile to my face and gave me a well needed reminder of him today.  Congrats on your success and a hot ride!"
"Nice man, congrats on beating it and on the car."
Congrats and congrats!!!!
If I beat coronavirus I'm gonna get a cybertruck
Teslas just don't seem to age do they. Beautiful.
Congrats. The solid roof is a bit of a unicorn. I always liked the look of the car with solid roof.
You still have have money left?
"Nice work, and congrats on beating cancer!"
Congratulations what a day!
I'll take it. I insist.
üí™
"What? Oh yes, the Production Model Odies"
Reddity.
Ah! To beat cancer and not be impoverished by medical bills. 2 miracles! Enjoy.
> Tesla can stop being an asshole.
"Im certainly curious how well these hold up after 100k miles.  Real talk, not TSLA talk."
unfortunately my ‚Äúbeat the cancer‚Äù present is a mountain of medical debt i just paid off last week.

7 Year old battery? meh... good luck with that.
"You must love somewhere with socialized medicine.

Cause in America the last thing you‚Äôd be thinking about buying after cancer is a car lol. Ramen would likely be at the top of the list.

Congrats on the cancer free thingy!"
Did you used to have a white Yukon? I looked up that spot on Google street view . I'm always curious what other replaces look like is all.
I wish I had enough money to beat cancer.
Yay!!
"Is the reason because you have to file for bankruptcy anyway, so you might as well grab up a slick whip?"
Great Choice! Best of Luck!
Congratulations. You've beaten cancer so you deserve something great!!
Congratz Cancer bro!!!! I also bought my Model 3 after my last chemo. It's my YOLO car. Couldn't afford a model S though
Congrats üéäüéâ Live your life to the fullest! You are a champion.
Congrats. Check out Openpilot for those first gen cars ;)
"Treat yourself, two thousand twenty"
"Fellow cancer survivor here, and I can rightly say you earned that car. To a long life of health and happiness!"
Congrats
"Oh shit, solid roof!"
Cheers to your health!
Consultations man! On beating cancer and getting a Tesla. My dad owned the exact same one on a lease and he still misses it to this day. Enjoy it man.
Take my wholesome award bro!
Congrats! Well deserved!
enjoy and well deserved.  If you want to get AP look up open pilot retrofit (i think like 3000 usd)
This is great news.  Congratulations and enjoy the Model 3.  It's awesome!
"congratulations! glad that you beat it and have more time on Earth here to spend time with family, friends, and your model S!"
Hell ya man! cancer is a dick and you deserve this!
Congrats dude. I did the same and bought a Model 3 two years ago! I still look forward to driving it every day. Stay strong!
Congratulations on both! Do you know if the eMMc or MCU was replaced? Did you buy private party?
Why does one get a 2013 S at a price comparable to a Model 3 new?
"What does a 7 year old Tesla cost?

I have a 6 year old Volt that I‚Äôd be lucky to trade for a half eaten plate of nachos."
"Beat cancer, buys car...can't be in the US. Hospital bills would send you to bankruptcy. 
Jokes aside, so proud of you on so many levels man!  Enjoy life and enjoy your new ride. ü§†"
"well done  [u/jdm731](https://www.reddit.com/user/jdm731/) . for my wife I took us on a trip to cancun (whole family) and breast implants :D (may have been for her, may have been for me :) )

(cancer was not related to breasts, it was non-hodgekings(?) lymphoma)"
My first thought is how does anyone not in the 1% battle cancer and can still afford a nice car after. Then I'm convinced they arent American and probably have universal healthcare.
How do you have any money after cancer treatment?
nice car. can i have it?
"Not only did you beat cancer AND buy a Tesla... You managed both in America. I've no idea how you managed it but congrats from the heart. With all the horror stories one hears about people being in crippling debt for life after cancer treatment in the states, I'm glad to finally see a story like yours. May you treat each other well and enjoy many miles together."
How much
"OP, If you don‚Äôt mind, how much did it cost?"
"Congrats on kicking cancer's ass. Gotta ask - what's the battery situation like? From personal experience with a small fleet of '12 through '18 Prius Cs (4 out of 10 cars had batt failures within 6 months of each other), the battery is always the most Murphy's Law-compliant component of any vehicle that's got one. How's it holding up on a used '13 EV?"
So you're not American lol. Congrats!
"Damn, if your wallet is fat enough to beat cancer than it‚Äôs about fuckin time you go electric. Congrats!"
Dude! Congrats on both!!
"Such posts should come with doctor signatures, because marketing departments could just as well be this desperate."
"Nice. I beat cancer and got crippling debt and depression! 
The Tesla ain‚Äôt bad though"
Cancer didn't bankrupt you...what country are you in?
After paying everything to beat cancer you had enough money to do this? I'm in the wrong business.
"The worst part is you know you are not American, because there is no way you could afford that after the medical bills.

Edit: Regardless, CONGRATS! live long and prosper!"
You paid for cancer treatment and still have money for a car? I call bullshit.
Wish I was rich after I finished paying for all my cancer treatment. I got nothing left.
"Next time skip the cancer and just buy the car, that's how I've done it ;)

Congrats!"
You must not be American. To beat cancer and have leftover used Tesla money is insane! Congrats!
You can afford to beat cancer and buy a Tesla? Fuck I hate this country.

Out here trading one cancer for another I see.
"Congratulation, you won and i think cancer will come again, one of you two will be dead and it will be most likely cancer because we got Elon Musk"
"Always remember, cancer can always come back. Be prepared to sell that thing if it does"
"I was thinking about buying a used tesla. Then I remembered that I am a union electrician and that Elon Musk is an anti union, anti- labor cunt. 

So I bought a Chevrolet instead."
[removed]
Lame
Figgity fooggity FFUUUUuuuuuuCCCCCCccccckkkKKKKKK cancer
But especially the Tesla! /s
Coulda bought 8 more Tesla‚Äôs lol
I was raving to my boss in 2012 about how Tesla stock was going to go through the roof within 10 years. Too bad I sold half of them when I ran into some financial issues in 2018 haha
"Bought a few shares at $35 in 2013, sold at ~$90 a month or so later...

I was fresh out of grad school and didn‚Äôt have the cash to play around with, but it still hurts. There‚Äôs no way I would have held this long anyway I guess. Still, I would have made more than $75k at this point..."
[deleted]
I bought 2011 TSLA shares.  Wish I bought more than 4!
"Thanks!  I've always wanted one and been a fan since the original.  Once my chemo/radiation was done and I could actually walk around I went hunting for one I could afford and found this one.  It has 103,000 miles on it but you could never tell by looking at it inside or out, just a beautiful car and well taken care of.  I will continue the cycle of care and have been enjoying it every day."
Yep it has fast charging and came with free supercharging.
"This one has 103,000 miles on it and at 100% charge gives me 245 miles."
Seems to be good.  Full charge gives me an estimated 245 miles.
"Isn‚Äôt a model 3 or y a significant upgrade to an old model S? When I get an old model S loaner, it feels like such a downgrade."
"Was losing the fingers related to the cancer, or did you just get so happy you chopped them off? Or somewhere in the middle, like a celebratory fireworks accident?"
The Model S released in 2012.
Thanks!  23 years is awesome!  I live with the constant fear that it‚Äôs going to come back and my radiation has only been finished for a month.
"I spent a ton of time in the hospital this year. With Covid and no visitors, if you want to talk shoot me a message.  I know how boring it can be."
I'm kinda in the same boat. Any issues with high mileage on these of the battery capacity is within reason? I don't know a lot about the S except they changed the grill sometime after 2013.
Thanks!
Because the S design has hardly changed in like 10 years? The older ones would look much older if they did.
Yeah I like the solid roof more than the glass roof myself.
"Yeah, my coworker beat cancer and her present was having to move back in with her parents"
Nope. No white Yukon for me.
You can. It‚Äôs called a job and health insurance.
"I actually picked it up at a Honda dealership in Denton Texas.  I'm not sure on what has been replaced but it has LTE, which leads me to believe it may have had some replacements/upgrades at one point because I think a lot of 2013's only had 3G, right?"
You can score a 100k mi 2013 model s for a lot less than a new 3 these days. Hopefully OP did.
I have never seen a model 3 for $29k.
I bought a 2013 S P85 w/70K for $40K as my retirement gift. I went through Carvana. They were great to deal with.
Pretty good. At 100% charge I‚Äôm getting 245 miles of range.
People have more money than me?!?!?? Impossible!!!
100% karma whoring bullshit!

Its what I could afford to buy.
Price.
"Fighting cancer isn't free really anywhere. If it is, you might get what you pay for. Congrats to OP on both!"
Why did i get downvoted? I am autist so i actully dont understand it
"Op seems like they can afford pretty good Healthcare, if they can get this once they've beat cancer."
"""Tesla has agreed to pay workers¬†*without education*¬†and who were¬†*unemployed at the time of their application*¬†at the company a salary of ‚Ç¨2,700 per month. This amount, Freyer  explained, is very high, and it is rare to see companies committing such  a salary for its entry-level workers.""

""The Worker Agency head further noted that workers at Gigafactory Berlin who have relevant vocational training could expect to be paid at least ‚Ç¨3,500 per month.

Nice attitude.  What's your ride again?  Mom's caravan?
How so?
Cunt much?
Lame that he had cancer? Yeah man totally! Why are you getting downvoted for that. /s
"I want to be angry at cancer in solidarity with you, but saying your comment out loud makes me laugh."
[removed]
How much was a share in that year roughly?
"Could be worse. I made some wild yolo wsb calls on tesla with the profits from my shares. Doubled in a week, then did the classic wsb thing where I have -99% roi so ntb lol."
Should've just gone homeless for a couple years then straight into a mansion.
"It seems this is almost always how it goes. Few have the wherewithal (and/or expendable cash) to simply throw money on a bet and stick with it. So you're an example of one of the happy winners, is how I see it.

As an off-topic aside, I know so many people who had some early Bitcoin and forgot/lost it since it was a lark to them.. and zero who held onto it. Similar goes with peoples' parents tossing out their comic book collections (although people have mostly learned that particular lesson now)."
"I bought XRP coins at $2.50, then didn't sell at $3, they are now worth exactly shit all.

&#x200B;

So yeah, you didn't anticipate a huge spike, but at least you didn't buy useless crap.."
"Aye, just avoid having similar tales to tell about today 10 years from now.."
"I drive a Model S with over 500,000kms on it, people think its new.  They last well!"
"That has 103,000 miles!?!? Wow it is clean and taken care of! Congrats, and congrats on beating cancer! It‚Äôs one hell of a fight."
"Congratulations, fuck cancer!  Did you buy through the Tesla website, or another online seller like Autotrader?  that's a killer find."
That‚Äôs the spirit. I have a 2016 v1 (old nose cone style) with 45K miles. I love it each time I drive it. Lol. And it‚Äôll last me for a long time (well at least 8 years because of the warranty).
"Congrats! Currently at 105k on my 2013, and have had it since 69k. Love every mile I drive on this baby"
"Nice, I just hit 100k and it runs and looks like new! Well, except for some of the wheel dings but whatcha gonna do."
How‚Äôs you beat cancer and not go into crippling debt? Also congrats on beating it!!! It‚Äôs such a horrible thing and I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre losing less family and friends.
Fuck that‚Äôs awesome! #FuckCancer! Good for you
We'll... Fast charging is subjective. Tesla limited the old S models....
Boom #goodkarma
Dayummm and unlimited supercharging!
"Outta curiosity, bout how long to charge it to full?"
"Depends on how old of an S.  I sold my 2020 model 3 Performance for a 2018 model S p100d with ludicrous.  Everything about it is an upgrade, imo."
I knew I worded it wrong and was expecting this response ü§£. It was cancer related sarcoma amputation.
That is even more wild. Holy crap im getting old
"Eventually you will get past that.  You realize that every little tired day, ache, pain and sniffle are just part of normal life again. Be vigilent, but enjoy the new time you have.  In a strange way,  it was a good thing to happen. I learned at 22 what most dont until much later in life. I also was shown how screwed up my values were, and that I needed to focus on, and enjoy, the people and relationships in my life versus valuing things."
"I have no idea? I‚Äôm also trying to compare specs, but they honestly look pretty similar for the SR+ and ‚Äò16 model S"
I believe the nose change was in 16.
FR
No I just want the money silly.
"To¬†determine¬†which¬†MCU¬†the car has, go to the main menu in the car and select Software. There should be the option to see ""Additional vehicle information""."
Yeah I guess you can't get a 3 for at least $10k more... hmmm...
"Thanks for the data point. How has the reliability been? My volt is getting up to 65K+ and has been rock solid

EDIT: I only ask because I would consider a used Tesla as a replacement at some point"
"And more than I can afford..
Hope to one day be able to be able to buy an ""old"" model like yours ;)"
I got it for $29k.
"Yeah, its especially not free in the U.S. even with good insurance.  When I see the amount my insurance has been billed I often wonder how people with cancer and no insurance survive."

Talking about America here bud.  Germany has some of the best labor laws in the world and something like 92% of all Germans are unionized workers. 


Musk doesnt do this in Germany because he wants to, he does it because it has to to operate there.


When talking about Tesla , only a complete dunce would assume we were talking about Germany and not Tesla's main HQ in California. 

Let's see.


Defied California Covid-19 restrictions to force workers to produce. Time and time again has spoken out against unions. Underpays and overworks engineers because he knows he can exploit their labor for the "" I worked at tesla "" resume addition.


Get you a pair of knee pads and go take your place under Elon's desk.  Bootlicker.


Oh, by not unionizing his workers , he pays them more..listen to that. 

Because every CEO goes home at night and thinks "" how can I make less money for myself and pay my labor force more?""

Lol, can't make this up.

You are a ü§°"

$45 vs $410 now. $500 was the Tesla all time high

"Split adjusted, in January 2013, it was $6.50 per share.

It's risen 70x since then."
Oof
Wow--are you a CAB/ Uber driver?  Have any of the major components been replaced?
Did you have to replace the batteries? I heard that their capacity  diminishes over time.
"Yeah, there were many times when I wondered if I was going to make it.  Definitely dark days.  Chemotherapy almost kills you while its killing the cancer.

I couldn't believe it when I saw it had 103,000 miles on it.  Only when I got it home and detailed it did I find any little spots where there are imperfections.  It has some curb rash on the wheels in a couple of places but really it's in terrific condition."
I found it at a Honda dealership of all places.
At a supercharger I can get to 90% in like an hour or less depending on what level I‚Äôm at when I get there.
"Tell me more, please..."
"Same here, i have a 2019 model 3 and I'm supposed to get my 2018 X P100D on saturday"
"Right, but this one is pretty old, before the front end refresh."
"A 2013 S is about as old as it gets. Lots of issues with the 12/13 models, especially drivetrain-related. I hope cancer didn't clean out OP's bank account too much lol."
Glad you didn't take offense to it! All good now?
"I've been a fan of electric cars since the GM Impact concept car in 1990 and I've been Tesla fan since 2005. The Model S seems recent to me, so I think that makes me the old one."
I have a family of 4 (two toddlers) so feel like the 3 might get cramped. Not sure if it makes sense to get a larger S with 60K+ miles or Model 3 with zero miles. We might just wait and get a Y whenever the LR RWD comes out or when the used market gets better.
"Wow, OP is kinda a dick."
It says Nvidia Tegra.
I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I‚Äôve only replaced the tires and tinted the windows. I love it!
It's a great price and no better time to celebrate.  That car will barely lose any value either.   I'd take a 2013 model S over a 2020 of any similarly priced car.  (Basic camry Xse or a Model S?  Easy choice!)
They don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm Happy for you!
"He clearly does not have to pay workers in Germany *more* than union wages.

Also your insults and rudeness reflect badly only on you, not me."
I heard radiation works also
His post history is seriously a work of art. Sometimes he trolls too hard and accidentally thousands of upvotes lmao.
"Didn't they just do a stock split recently? So it's more like 1 share of $45 vs. 5 shares of $500, so $2500

Battery and MCU.  And a couple door handles due to freezing in the winter.  Otherwise other than normal suspension wear that's it.
"I always say cars are meant to be used! If you‚Äôre stressed about every imperfection, you may as well never drive it. From the pic I can‚Äôt see any imperfections! 

And yes, chemotherapy is such a shitty thing. Just lost my father in law to it, he opted not to even treat because of how bad the chemo would have been. Always love hearing success stories of people who do beat it! Keep going and make sure it never wins the fight!"
"I jacked my tesla rim up real bad on a curb and thought I was going to have to replace the entire wheel.  Turns out mobile rim repair vans/trailers are a common thing, a trailer showed up outside my work the day after I wrecked it, and 30 mins later it looks brand new.  Cost me $90.  Can't even tell where the damage was anymore.

[Pics before/after](https://i.imgur.com/ft2djH7.png)"
Sick. Can we ask how much you ended up paying for it. Seems like it would be a great deal.
"I characterized my chemo as doctors trying to see how close they could come to killing me, without actually succeeding. They did a damn good job!"
"0-60 in 2.3 vs. 3.1

On paper, that‚Äôs 0.8 seconds. But when you‚Äôre going *that* fast, it‚Äôs a huge difference."
"I bought a stealth p3 last November for 51k after delivery and fees.  Sold it for 50k to vroom, figuring I just paid less than $100 a month to drive a new tesla for a year.  Got a used P100D fully loaded (FSD, white interior, every upgrade possible).  Now I won't feel antsy waiting for the trimotor cyber truck -- might not even buy it now because I honestly cannot see any reason I would need another car.  I

 drove my model 3 on a 2k mile trip over 3 days and both cars on a 1000 mile trip (1 day in S, 2 in 3).  Both cars were better than anything else for such a trip, but Id take the S over the 3 any day of the week.  Faster, quicker, more comfortable ride, so much room (I'm 6'0+, so my knee not resting on the window adjustment is heavenly for comfort).  

There are things I preferred in the 3 (steering wheel and overall minimalism in the 3), but overall I feel the S is the superior car.  Although it's weird seeing vents in a car again.  But the rear view mirror is functional in an S, and I feel like I have better control over the actual positioning of the air vents.  Windshield difference is imperceptible to me."
No offense whatsoever!  I'm doing very well now thanks for asking.
I have the 3 and the Y both with three car seats across the back seat. The Y feels more spacious but both work well for our family
"Yeah, the Y is the ideal car for our 3 person family (1 infant). But the $50k price tag is honestly too much unless I saved for years"
"No they‚Äôre just angry they can‚Äôt be super rich. 

I want a Tesla too, but I ain‚Äôt angry about it."
"I think that's MCU1. you mentioned you had LTE, I think that's an external upgrade. Here is a site I found that talks about it if you're interested. https://teslatap.com/?s=what+hardware+version+do+I+have
I'm surprised you replied. Awesome! I'm saving for exactly what you did. I'm still not sure if I'll do the infotainment upgrade, because of failing eMMcs, which I think would add a $10/mo Premium Account bill. I did see Tesla will now cover failed eMM chips under warranty, if I can still find old Model S under warranty when I pull the trigger.

Very happy for your purchase, good luck mate!"
">He clearly does not have to pay workers in Germany *more* than union wages.

No one has to pay any unik more than the legally contracted and negotiated wages. What is your point?"

"Yeah, the $45 5 years ago was around $225 before split, compared to all time high of $2500 before split"
"No.

the Q1 2013 price is $6.50/share split adjusted.  It was ACTUALLY $45 at the time.

It didn't hit $45 split adjusted until the big run up in 2014."
"Damn, what doss a new battery cost for one of those?"
Was the battery replaced because of degradation? Or some other fault?
How many miles /KM did you get out of the battery?
Wow thanks for the tip
"Same, in looking to snag a Tesla on a budget and was wondering what is possible."
Yeah that chemo just about kills you. The first round of Retuxin they gave me was by far the worst experience.
On paper 0.8s off of 3s is monumental.
How about cornering with the added weight? Have you done anything with the tires/suspension?
"Any feelings for losing Track Mode? 

That seems to be the only thing really holding me back from looking into a Performance Model S. I love the ability of control and moving power when and where I want"
Thanks!  This one has premium connectivity included. I read that article and it does seem like I still have MCU1.
"My point is that he is paying more than the negotiated union wage, which he doesn't have to do, and contrary to your insistence that he pays these wages only because he has to."
"Split adjusted, TSLA was $6.50 in 2013.

It's up about 70x since then"
"No it wasn't.  Split adjusted, it was $6.50 per share in Jan 2013."
It was not $225 5 years ago before splt adjustment. It was 45/5
The battery warranty is 8 year/unlimited miles. The Model S started selling in VERY low volume in late 2012. This means that most likely no one has ever had a battery replacement out of warranty. So no one is really sure about the price point...
"It's a...battery, they tell you straight up you're gonna have to replace it every 300,000 miles."
"It was around 350,000kms.  At the end it was charging slow and down to 70% capacity."
I found it at a Honda dealership in Denton Texas and got it for $29k.
"Bought my 2013 P85 with 107k earlier this year for 25,900 in Texas. New MCU and batteries installed at 99k (lol). It's been dreamy. Shop around!"
just go to Tesla's used model S inventory and sort price from low to high
"Oh, baby... my first hit of Rituxan threw me for a loop! After many more infusions, it wasn't such a big deal."
A full quarter faster to 60 mph. That‚Äôs not insignificant; you‚Äôre right.
Never used it tbh.  Had I used it I may have felt different.
7 years ago
"It was 225 before split, so $45*5"
"> So no one is really sure about the price point... 

Thankfully, we know how much it costs them to make a battery. They're targetting $50-100 per kWh in the future, so $8,000 or less, for a new Model S 80kWh pack"
That's why I just leave the charger plugged in 24/7
Where did you find this type of deal? How can you confirm mcu was replaced and battery was replaced? Carguru and such don't state this info....
Cheapest one there is like 43k...
Yeah by my 6th round it didn‚Äôt even do anything to me any more. That first one though. Man. I thought if all of them are this bad I am not going to survive this.
"Ok. Yes, 2013 price was what the OP was asking about.

> Wish I could buy some 2013 TSLA shares"
Right. Sorry I was about to make a different point and typed too quick. Just happy I bought it at 228 (Pre split) so $45.60 on up to $417 today.
"Still rocking one of the corded electric cars, nice."
But you did. I'm glad you're better now. Stay strong. Just put one foot in front of the other.
"Ikr i wish I bought more, everyone was saying Tesla stock was bad so I never brought myself to it"
"The range is amazing, but the radius is only 10 meters."

"Because it's Telsa. For some reason people have become unthinking, devoted followers of a corporation."
Tesla branded tequila that was just sold recently. Elon mentioned he'd sell it a long time ago but no one knew what the bottle looked like until last week. The third image shows the bottle in the house which looks like a lightning bolt. I'm assuming these posters were in the showrooms for a long enough period but no one noticed the bottle.

These cars will truly test how well a model 3 can hold up with consistent use.
"Love to see it, but as someone that has done ride share in my Model 3, having to explain the door handles to every single person is a mess.  It‚Äôs the single thing I hate most about my car."
Oh this is awesome!! EVs are perfect for Taxis!!
"I wonder how the economics work out since you can ""Hot Swap"" drivers between shifts, and must dedicate % time in 24hrs to charging, vs. fuel saved, maintenance etc...  If this catches on in NY organically (not driven by legislation) will be a huge win, means ROI makes sense vs ICE."
"We have 20 on the roads here in Madison. The company, Green Cab, also runs Chevy Bolts."
Looks like a surprisingly decent paint job. Taxis usually look like a child did it with a roller.
"According to this survey, over 75% of taxi drivers travel 35k miles a year or less. Works out to about 100 miles a day. Even if its double to triple in NYC a model 3 should last a whole day on one charge. If a charge is needed, a 20 minute supercharge should be sufficient for the majority of operators. 

More specifically for NYC, ""
According to the PBS program ""Taxi Dreams,"" the average number of miles driven by a taxi driver in New York City in a 12-hour shift is 180. ""

"Looks gorgeous! 
I wonder when FSD is fully available the taxi driver can ‚Äòwork from home‚Äô ü§î"
"Question, taxi drivers drive a lot. Time not on the road is money lost for them. Meaning they will only supercharge these correct? 

Supercharging for companies is not allowed yet? Or it wasn't allowed as that would saturate the network. Atleast back in Hong Kong when they were using free supercharging for the model S taxis back about 5 years ago. 

Does this mean taxi companies will be allowed to buy supercharger stall equipment from tesla to make their own private superchargers in their home depot's?"

"There is some guy in Madrid, Spain who has been using his model 3 as a taxi for a few years and has no complaints, only the door handle heh. Same will happen to that guy"
I have five 2020 Nissan Leafs for my Taxi company in Oklahoma. ;)
The amount of people that won't understand how to open the door using those handles is going to go up a LOT
What's Teslas reasoning for the weird door handle 8n and out?
In Barcelona we have Model S taxis
"Did they give it the same horrendous paint job other taxis get.  

I‚Äôm pretty sure they give a guy a roll of painters tape and say you have 20 minutes and then blast it with yellow paint. Doesn‚Äôt really matter though cuz it‚Äôs a cab."
"Door handles really are problematic in this context. I‚Äôll take them any day for the range, but a normal tug handle is so much easier to use."
Rip the scuff marks on those kick panels
I can't tell if it's the paint job or the angle but that looks sick
"Seems interesting, perhaps the future of NYCT. Although I‚Äôm not to familiar with the details of it"
Gotta pay off that car note somehow.
Wow!!!
"I don‚Äôt understand this at all. Taxis can be had for pennies on the dollar right now; the market for medallions has crashed. Why would someone use a Tesla for one, when you can get a ICE taxi for next to nothing? Is this a stunt of some sort? It must be, right?"
Actually looks so good in yellow üåù
This guy better get that self opening door mod fast!
"Love it. 

Can't wait for more EVs or Even plug-in EVs to become commonplace in taxi fleets.

It's a long time out, but I look forward to it greatly"
"Kind of surprised at this. One taxi company‚Äôs entire fleet has been Model 3 LRs here in Madison, Wisconsin, for a year or two already."
"A few basics for those that are not from New York:

Yellow cabs are most often the types driving around manhattan that get hailed by hand on the side of the street. If you‚Äôve ever seen a movie or tv show that‚Äôs exactly how it works. 

There are app based dispatches available but realistically a yellow cab is spending most of its time in manhattan or driving people out of it and back into it

What other cities call taxi service where you traditionally call a number with your destination, there are separate dispatch based limo companies for. These are not yellow cabs

Yellow cab companies themselves historically make money in a monopoly environment where they own special licenses called medallions (represented by a literal metal medallion on the hood of a car amongst other measures) that were limited by the taxi commission. These are worth some decent amount of money and were worth a lot more pre Uber. 

Most taxi companies actually own the medallions that they can assign to their fleet vehicles and then rent out to drivers."
In Poland we have that Tesla taxi from a long time in some of biggest town... why in NY is this first taxi?
"There are hundreds of white Tesla Model S used as taxi on Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. Have been for years. 

Basically a white model S is now equivalent to you drive a taxi. Like driving a Mercedes was a taxi from 1960 - 2010."
I've seen quite a lot of model 3 taxis in Denmark.
Almost all new taxis in Copenhagen is a Tesla model 3

"Has anyone in NYC taken this?

How is the experience different? Are the fares the same?"
"An honest question, how will this work or Tesla doesn't allow anyone to use their superchargers for business use?"
I'm a little surprised to see a Tesla operating as a taxi. Even on a supercharger you're taking a significant fraction of the working day to keep the batteries charged. Do the economics work out from the savings on gas?
Is there any evidence on how constant use may impact the battery life?
Are these robotaxis?
The second best part of this pic is the other guy simultaneously expressing joy at seeing a Model 3.

"Also can people, who have never rode in a Model 3, figure out how to get in and out."
Amsterdam has been doing it for years with model S.  I've had mixed discussions with drivers.
London is packed with Prius taxis. There seem to be as many as there are black cabs these days. They run them on electric as much as they possibly can and charge when waiting for customers. I've looked at a few on sale with huge mileages racked up and they seem to hold up really well. Low speed city driving is really easy on electric drivetrains. When you consider the whole electric drivetrain in a Prius is about 5x smaller than a 3 I don't see there being any longevity issues even with huge mileages.
Many Taxi in Denmark and Norway are Model 3. No problems and the cheapest Taxi to run by far.
We have Model S taxis in Austria. They basically last forever.
That‚Äôs why I put a piece of blue removable painter tape on mine and just tell people to click the blue button.
Push the fat pull the skinny
What makes it complicated if you unlock the doors as someone comes in? (is the 3 different than the S?)
"The recent changes to Model 3 include updating the inside door release button. It now has a self explanatory icon, which should help. https://youtu.be/l919wD1lP1M"
"On the way in AND the way out, too

I reckon 10% of people get it right when getting in, maybe 50% when getting out. It's a shitshow, just give us proper fucking handles"
"That's probably true, but you probably never have to explain them to the same person twice! They are pretty intuitive once you have seen how they work"
You could put a push here sticker on the side that you actually push in maybe that would help
Yeah no one is going to know how to open the door getting in or out..
That‚Äôs what 2nd grade teacher never complain about when ‚Äútheir‚Äù students‚Äù spell ‚Äútheyre‚Äù wrong. We‚Äôre all in this together.
Have you been in a NYC cab? Passengers about to get whiplash. You thought a V8 was punchy? About to need helmets for these rides.
">EVs are perfect for Taxis!!

Except for the whole recharging thing"
Agreed but the main issue would be the charging speed..not sure how the supercharger network is in NYC but if you're driving hundreds of miles a day  having to spend an hour+ maybe a few times a day hunting a supercharger and waiting there can be annoying.
Some drivers exclusively drive their vehicle and take it home at night.
"I‚Äôm curious where they charge it if they‚Äôre running it for full days. There are no free super chargers in nyc and in Manhattan, they‚Äôre housed in standard parking garages with high hourly parking fees- and on top of that there are only a few stalls (3-4 in most cases)."
"There's naturally always going to be times of day that require more cabs than others, so you simply don't need 100% of cabs on the road 100% of the time, only during peak hours. Logistically, you can rotate your fleet relative to demand and charge vehicles when they're not needed."
"It's only 20? It seems like so many more. Either way, I love seeing the 3s and Bolts out there."
"I was just in Madison this week and spotted one! https://i.imgur.com/kt5eHmE.jpg  
  
Really neat!"
We will see who has lower TOC bolt or Tesla? They are priced accordingly now used... $15-18k
Probably a wrap
This goes against Tesla‚Äôs rules for supercharging though. Not for commercial use.
Shhhh.... don‚Äôt tell Tesla!!
"Ah yes, the anti-Uber/Lyft regulations enriching cab drivers to the point of being able to drive Teslas."
"We all have panel gaps guys, we will be okay"
Where?
The range of even a SR+ should be sufficient for a whole day's driving. Companies not using superchargers had to do with *free* supercharging. Tesla doesn't care how much a taxi company uses paid supercharging. Some cab companies will probably install their own dc fast chargers. Many owners will take their taxis home and charge with AC.
"Lol, üëèüèº"
Ha! Great catch üçé
Or total recall and dress like the robot taxi guy
Look on the bright side - at least they aren't Model S door handles. Being retracted and extended 100 times a day will probably burn out their motors in a month.
Cheaper per mile
"In Amsterdam with the Model S not quite. There around 150-200 of them but charging, luggage space and frequent garage visits are an issue. However most of them are 5-6 years old at the moment. The 3 must be quite a bit better.

(Dutch) https://www.parool.nl/nieuws/taxichauffeurs-schiphol-tesla-s-niet-geschikt-voor-intensief-gebruik~bd3c0a2e/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.nl%2F"
"No, no you are not. 

1) Range>average miles driven/day by NYC cabs. 

2) Superchargers in the rare instance a cab needed a top-off."
"I‚Äôm not aware of a taxi service using the model 3 (except this one) but there is a taxi service that runs from LA to San Francisco that uses model S and X vehicles. If it wasn‚Äôt working out then I don‚Äôt think they would continue to use them, so that seems like a good sign to me."
"Constant use is not much of a problem.  
Being left for extended periods at 0% or 100% is the problem (not a problem for a taxi).

The **Amsterdam airport taxi fleet** has been nearly exclusively **Tesla Model S**/**X** since ~2014; and do ~100,000+ km (~50,000+ miles/year) *each*:

Those are charged with a combination of AC and private 60 kW Superchargers."
Well there‚Äôs already an epidemic of suicide among taxi drivers so your comment is pretty insensitive TBH.
"Reach out to modmail if you have a concern please.  I refer you to [the last time](https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ja0ci3/_/g8nhqvu/?context=1) you complained of this.

Watermark your OC work?
Cab drivers own their cars.
How does this add to NYC debt?
"That was part of the master plan. Someone orders a Tesla robo taxi, can never leave, now they own it."
I drive Uber: Answer is 90% no. 100% if they are intoxicated.
"My experience so far is that people figure out in eventually, but out remains a mystery - even with little aftermarket ""open door"" stickers."
"oh yeah, very good point.  I have to always tell people how to open the door.  It was stupid of Tesla to take something entirely intuitive, people have trouble figuring out how to get in and get out."
Good luck to those doors.
Model s has the handles that pop out though
"The cab drivers at Schiphol are actually suing Tesla right now because they claim the car doesn‚Äôt hold up for such intensive usage. 

https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&nv=1&pto=aue&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/03/10/taxichauffeurs-willen-geld-terug-van-tesla-a3993305&usg=ALkJrhhilC78JVEdTOinR0CJUEgLm8sVJg"
"I don't think many would be worried about the drivetrain more the interior, doors etc"
There are also the EV black cabs (with range extender generator) which seem to be holding up pretty well.
NYC has a lot of Prius taxis too.
"If the math makes sense, should not all switch over eventually?"
Used one in Graz a few years ago. My first time in an electric car. Now I mostly use Renault Zoe‚Äôs as part of a car sharing service. I can not wait for Tesla‚Äôs to be available for that.
That‚Äôs hilarious!
"üòä 

Mebbe green for go, or red ‚ÄúExit‚Äù label"
"That's what came to mind when reading the original comment, like a ""push here"" sticker could work"
The 3 doors aren‚Äôt like the S that present automatically.  You have to press the back part of the handle in and pull the front part that comes out.  Very unnatural to what most people think of when they use a door handle.
"yes its totally different, after the model s door handle disaster and due to cost the model 3 has simple manual door handles but not anything normal obviously.

You push in one side this lets the handle come out so you can grab it and open the door."
Doesn‚Äôt help getting in though.
"You know what‚Äôs really intuitive?  A regular door handle that doesn‚Äôt need to come with instructions.  I love my Model 3, but the door handles are just genuinely stupid."
Nah my mom asks frequently
Sure.  I still think Tesla should rethink the handles.  They shouldn‚Äôt have to come with instructions.
Wouldn't you just put your car in chill mode when you have passengers?
"You can recharge to 80% in 10-15min... no issue at all. You only need to do that once per day for about 400-500 miles of total travel in a day. 
The average number of miles driven by an NY cab driver in a 12 hour shift is 180 miles. This means that they can work a whole day without charging a single time, and still have 50-100 miles leftover depending on if they did mostly city driving or highway driving. The car can then just recharge overnight on a slow 240v charger and get back to full in 2-3 hours overnight"
"[https://www.quora.com/How-many-miles-does-a-NYC-taxi-do-in-its-life-as-a-taxi](https://www.quora.com/How-many-miles-does-a-NYC-taxi-do-in-its-life-as-a-taxi)  
70,000 miles per year

5833 miles per month

194 miles per day

16 miles per hour  


charges once a day overnight and it's likely a non-issue. there's barely any gas stations in manhattan either so presumably gas cars park in queens, long island or weehawken."
"NYC has very few gas stations now. It's a ""fuel desert"" because property is too valuable to just pump dinosaur juice into cars. [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/nyregion/a-gas-station-closes-in-soho-making-lower-manhattan-a-gasoline-desert.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/16/nyregion/a-gas-station-closes-in-soho-making-lower-manhattan-a-gasoline-desert.html)

But there's electricity everywhere. Manhattan hopefully starts putting charging spots on every corner."
Battery swap? Nio's doing pretty good with that.
"I‚Äôve done a couple of 2000 mile trips with the Tesla and believe me, you have to stop more to pee than to charge..."
"That's a benefit. I imagine you've never driven in Manhattan if you think that you could drain a 300 mile battery in a day, and even in locations where it's possible recharging during a mid-day break is an easy solution. The majority of the time is sitting there in stop and go traffic, where they can just pop on autopilot and let the car handle the driving. Then they can charge it up overnight and it is more convenient than needing to fuel up at a gas station, not to mention cheaper since you're not idling all day."
In Manhattan the charging network is more extensive than gas stations.
You don't have to sit at the supercharger and charge to full you know? You can charge the 15-25 min until the charge rate slows down.
"I've read that the average mileage for a taxi in NYC is about 70,000/year, or ~200/day. This is a non-issue.

In fact, the Tesla pictured could just be an Standard Range+. For a fleet vehicle, it makes perfect sense. They probably sat down and thought, ""Hmm here's how much we can save on gas, this is a no-brainer!"""
Well if you consider that you usually start a day with a full charge I doubt you would even need to charge the car at all until night time. When it comes to city miles Tesla‚Äôs are actually more efficient than normal and if the car is rated for 300 miles you can expect to get 400-500 miles worth of city driving done.
"Similar to how drivers pool for medallions and contract through cab companies, they can pool resources and get their own private supercharger network to secure low rates and timely access."
"Some do yes, but that's not the most efficient use of the asset."
"Twenty was the first order, he may have bought more already."
I would imagine Greencab will be tracking performance closely. Cab companies are razor thin margin operations. Will they make such information available? Probably. If someone from a legitimate automag was doing an article. I know I'd like to see fleet cost analysis.
"With the exception of pay-per-use, which this would be."
and a taxi fleet would have its own charge center. are you thinking that NYC taxi fleets are buying Teslas without any way to charge them
"Near the right rear light, you can see the gap super wide on top but super tight at the bottom. 

The gap between the rear and front door looks weird too."
Good point. However a saturated charging network is not a good thing either if half the stalls at some superchargers are essentially not available to be used as there are always taxi's using it
"But if the cost of the vehicle is ~$40K more than the alternative (used ICE taxi), it‚Äôs going to have to drive a LOT of miles, with a huge marginal savings per mile, to make up for that."
"> According to the PBS program ""Taxi Dreams,"" the average number of miles driven by a taxi driver in New York City in a 12-hour shift is 180. If you do the simple math, a cab running five days a week would rack up 46,800 miles in 52 weeks. Because some cabs are used for double shifts, meaning that **two drivers share the same vehicle in two 12-hour shifts**, an average cab being used to pull double shifts could rack up 93,600 miles in a year or more.

You can't run double shifts in a 3.

Pretty sure they the LA to San Fran company shut down a few years ago now.
I guess my real question is about supercharging everyday which I'm assuming would be required for a taxi.
I find it funny how that was also an orbitalATK post....seems....sus
lol
just like VIM. It has millions of users because they don't know how to escape!
"You drive Uber in a SR? Wow, how's that working out for you? How often do you need to recharge?"
Getting in yes. Getting out? Nope. They yank the mechanical handle. Even people who‚Äôve previously been taught how to open the door forgets and yanks the mechanical handle again.
"Just use ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù label, easier to understand than picture (for English speakers)"
They started putting a little door drawing on the button. I‚Äôd love to see what kind of difference it‚Äôs made.
They lost the case.
Well I don't know about Teslas but the Priuses I've seen were mostly in good condition internally. The fake leather Tesla uses is pretty durable.
Oddly enough I‚Äôve been seeing those pop up in Amsterdam as well.
green Triangle button ??
Ahh didn't realize that at all..so even when you unlock the car as a driver nothing happens?
"This puzzles me. On one hand, I know it is an issue because anyone new who gets into my car never knows how to open the door (I‚Äôm talking from the outside).  But the first time I got in a Model 3, it seemed so. Atrial to push with your thumb on the wide part. I never even gave it a second thought. 

My wife always tells me I‚Äôm odd. She‚Äôs probably right, but the benefit is that the odd door hanged on my car seem perfectly normal to me."
"I just watched a 4-minute video demonstrating all ways to close/open a S door, very interesting"
"Come to think of it... before the Model Y, no Tesla models shared the same method for opening doors."
"The Renault Zoe has a somewhat similar opener, though it's black plastic surrounded by a black C pillar. People get confused."
"They are flush with the door panel for best aerodynamics and they don't  need those breaky little motors to pop them out like on the model S. Don't worry, you'll eventually get them figured out!"
horses are pretty intuitive too
that is true
"they get paid by the ride, not by the hour. Have you been in a NYC cab? They fucking speed through everywhere (when they're not weaving through double parked cars or sitting in standstill traffic)"
[deleted]
"Ohh, that's cool! I'd love to see more electric cars as taxis. Whether that be Teslas (once they iron out their manufacturing process a little further) or alternatives (Ford, Chevy, Honda, etc), I think it's great progress."
"Would be cool if there were more chargers here in nyc that weren‚Äôt in valet garages. You should take a look at our charging infustructure it‚Äôs pretty shit. I‚Äôm in Brooklyn and it‚Äôs a cool 40 min drive one way during the day to get to a super charger (JFK or Brooklyn Museum which is in a paid lot). Most of the ones in Manhattan are only 72kw iirc. 

Also I‚Äôve run mine down 45% just casually cruising city street for half the day in my AWD. On average driving my wife and MIL to and from work drops me from 80% to around 60% by the end of the day and it‚Äôs a 4 mile drive one way. So yea as much as I love EVs I can‚Äôt imagine a large fleet of these unless they set up some serious charging infrastructure. 180 miles doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot but last winter my average efficiency was ~60-75% and after a year my max battery range is a cool 280 so that‚Äôs 168-210 with a 100% charge so a boost would def be needed somewhere."
"thats true but tesla will just throw you off the network because superchargers are only for personal use and road trips, not commercial."
"> You can recharge to 80% in 10-15min... 

On a supercharger... which are not available in every city.
Also it's not good for the car doing that daily and pretty sure also Tesla doesn't want you using the superchargers daily.

charging over night or charging while waiting for clients shouldn't be a problem though."
"Most taxis are driven 24/7. 

They have meeting spot at 4am / 4pm where they swap driver's"
"15 minutes is $100+ in cab fares in NYC... Which is why you don't see teslas being used. In addition, charging in Manhattan is problematic with a saturated market and few places to charge without waiting in line."
Not to mention those are city miles and the model 3 will probably get around 400-500 miles per charge there
"I got range anxiety for the first and only time once when I had to drive into Manhattan. I was down to fumes looking for a supercharger. 

I found one in the absolute tightest parking garage I‚Äôve ever seen, the kind that stacks the cars on top of each other. The guy who ran it was cool enough to let me juice up for ten minutes."
More expensive too.
Are there any superchargers in Manhattan much less 250kw ones?
"Well no, 24/7/365 is the best use of most assets.

(Not including the marginal cost of customer acquisition or efficiency)"
"The asset is the badge, the car is an expense"
The person I replied to used the term supercharge implying using a supercharger

"not only an SR Uber, but an SR Uber with WHITE interior

Still don't get that design decision. It just doesn't give an advantage.
Most people that ask don‚Äôt look for long before they ask. I just warn them.
The speakers make a cute little ding to let you know you unlocked the doors.  That‚Äôs it.
I fully understand why they‚Äôre flush with the door handles and I have them figured out.  I have 90k miles on my Model 3.  My entire comment was about OTHER people not being able to figure them out and always have to explain them 2-3 times to get them in the car.  It‚Äôs a stupid design.
"I get that in this sub Tesla can do no wrong, but it‚Äôs much healthier to criticize them when they do dumb things.  I love my Model 3, but there are a couple design choices that just make me scratch my head, the door handles being at the top of the list.  Glovebox not having a physical button anywhere is another weird one."
"Went to New York on business trip for the first time last year, had numerous taxi rides and not one drove like you said. They actually drove pretty good. Except for the guy driving me from Manhattan to the airport in 4PM rush hour.. That was fucking crazy (I had no idea that that  is ""not done"" )"
"Assuming a model 3 and a v3 supercharger, 15min is about right."
"Agreed, it‚Äôs awesome. Charging and EVs have come a long way!"
"72kw is not ‚Äúfast charging‚Äù per s√©, but you can get a cool 80 miles or so in just 15-20min, which still is not bad for a city taxi, or even for commuters"
"Tesla will install private superchargers for fleets, though."
"They can charge at their own company‚Äôs chargers then, or any chargers with support for 150w and above. People forget that Teslas can use superchargers AND any other charger (with an adapter)"
How would they know?
Wasn't that just about the free supercharging?
"Then that‚Äôs an average of 360 miles per day, one of the drivers has to charge 20-30 min, or both can charge for 10-15 minutes, and that will cover all of that easily. Infrastructure definitely needs to be built to accommodate increases demand, but the technology is there and proven"
"the ultra-milers might get 110wh/mile in the model 3 but even in all city usage I rarely get below 230, with the ac running,  stop and go traffic, hills music and so forth. still in my normal covid  work from home usage I go about 2 weeks of city driving between charges."
"We do need more 250kW Superchargers, but there's dozens of places to charge in Manhattan: [https://www.tesla.com/findus?bounds=40.795321311927836%2C-73.85060514172365%2C40.70090624568315%2C-74.09522260388185&zoom=13&filters=store%2Cservice%2Csupercharger%2Cdestination%20charger&search=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY%2C%20USA](https://www.tesla.com/findus?bounds=40.795321311927836%2C-73.85060514172365%2C40.70090624568315%2C-74.09522260388185&zoom=13&filters=store%2Cservice%2Csupercharger%2Cdestination%20charger&search=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY%2C%20USA)"
Only cause they‚Äôre usually in paid garages.  Street charging could solve this.
Superchargers: yes. 250 kW: no. They say up to 72 kW.
"Yes. It would have been simple to find out with google maps. But since you were too lazy, there are a lot. I only wish my city had that many. Also, the average NYC taxi driver drives fewer miles per day than the car has (assuming Long Range model) so supercharger access would probably not be necessary most of the time."
"Thanks for the link and interesting read. Do you think a company would like to have have superchargers only for use within their own one company or is it more likely they divide up the cost between them all and find a central location ? 

I say that because these companies for example such as Walmart who are buying the Tesla Semi are huge and the money wouldn't make too much of a difference too them. What would make a difference is having superchargers at their own home depot's for their trucks to charge up on overnight compared to finding a central location where they have to travel to, to charge"

"I was actually commenting on Teslas design in general, not in the context of a taxi.

I'm sorry if I don't get out but what has that to do with anything?
Nope. Fully agreed. Tesla has yet to design a good door handle.
"Upvote for you username. 

Also, that pretty much what I do."

Why not wire a switch in parallel with the one in the passenger door so you just open it for them?

-Also big E probably shouldn't have called that guy a pedo.   Kinda wrong."
I‚Äôve done that too when I had too much luggage to take the trains. You haven‚Äôt taken a proper nyc cab ride til the guy flies thru side streets and nearly runs over a biker or pedestrian trying to cross the street bc pedestrians and bikers treat red lights as suggestions
[deleted]
"Yea but in nyc they‚Äôre basically all limited to 72kw and in valet lots. You have to pay to get into the lot and again to charge. Honestly I‚Äôd just buy an efficient ice car and save myself the headache if I were a taxi driver. You might think the mileage is fine but you never know how far away you‚Äôll end up and then you‚Äôve got to go home at the end of the day. 

For example I did Uber eats on a bicycle for fun and normally I‚Äôd stick to local stuff (within 5 miles) but I‚Äôve had chain deliveries bring me like 20+ miles away after a dinner rush and then I had to ride all the way back. I can see the same thing happening with a taxi since I‚Äôve hired some to do like 1-2hr drives (Brooklyn to the Bronx sometimes traffic sucks ass here). If that was a Tesla just getting back round trip 60 miles of range are lost. So yea just saying you never know with that kinda work and range and fuel are limiting factors."
they track usage and driver behavior
"it probably started because of people abusing the unlimited, but it applies to anyone using superchargers, whether its free or not."
"Yep, same 10-15 they spend gassing up."
I was extremely low and didn‚Äôt have time for one of the slower chargers. I ended up having to pay a few bucks to get into some mall parking lot and supercharge there.
"I guess it depends on their charging needs and overall utilization rate, but I'd imagine for fleets that are centrally dispatched, the SC would be installed in one location"
":wq!

>Taking a course for this in Uni rn"
"Yeah. Constant maintenance is a big factor in this. Lack of such in an EV. Only maintenance I've had to pay for thus far is new tires & cabin air filters, 38k miles in (filters only replaced due to fires). Depreciation is the only downside and that's not something I care about. You get that in other cars as well (sometimes even worse off).

Electricity, even supercharging, is much cheaper than gas in my area. My local SC has nighttime rates of $0.19/kWh. Home electricity is $0.09-0.10/kWh.

I also got a $5000 rebate from my state, and $3750 tax credit last year. So that basically eliminated the upfront cost of the car compared to others.

Model 3 qualifies for Uber Premier trips, which pay out double (albeit rare, but a nice bonus).

To top it off, riders love the car, constantly ask questions about it, and often makes someone's day better. Great ratings and tips. Convinced a good handful to buy their own, including one or two referrals.

TL;DR 99% profits, people love it, I love it."
no
I don't live in Manhattan
">Most Uber trips are not on highways, right? 

What??  That certainly depends on the city."
"Works out to 8-9 hours after accounting for charging, delays, bathroom & food breaks."
Yes I know that but its quite a nice car for Uber :/
City range is better than highway range though so an SR probably does closer to 250-300 miles around town.
Surprisingly nope (edit : o don't quite know but I'm somewhat sure he doesnt do that)
There‚Äôs no emergency/mechanical release in the rear seats.

"Even with v2 chargers with shares charging, 20min gets you enough range to go about your day"
"Do instacart instead of uber, couldn't risk a drunk person throwing up in the back of my shadowfax."
5k state rebate? Sounds like Colorado
What do you mean depend on cities? There are cities that allow you to drive faster than 50 mph in urban areas?
"Um... it‚Äôs the same price as a base model Yukon, or a moderately equipped C-class (Mercedes‚Äô compact sedan).  

It‚Äôs a step above a Hyundai Sonata; don‚Äôt get me wrong. But this isn‚Äôt unusual for a premium ride share car..."
"That‚Äôs very misleading... What‚Äôs true is that constant slow speed is better than constant fast speed. As such, this isn‚Äôt ideal for city driving.  

His Ubering is further complicated by self-admitted frequent Supercharging. Assuming he only charges to 90%, this yields a useful range of ~200 miles."
"Really? Didn't know that, how do rear passengers get out in an emergency/accident in case the electronics fail?"
"Not gonna disagree that its stupid design, but if you are going to use the car as a taxi I would be wiring a $5 switch near the driver to open the door on behalf of the passenger."
And I'm sure they'll account for charging and have vehicles they can plug to charge them get in another
tricksy and false. there is only one true shadowfax. its a white 240sx s14 sitting under a bag üòï
Check out Sherlock Holmes here ;)
"Oregon, actually. $2500 base + $2500 for low to moderate household income. I barely met the threshold for the second tier."
"Wait, they don‚Äôt all do that?"
I got $5000 in NJ
"NJ started this year, that‚Äôs what put me over the edge for our Y"
That would be dangerously slow in most of the Atlanta area.
But I'm not sure if an uber driver thinks that is normal price. Yes that is a great price for a car for a lot of us but do uber drivers really grt paid enough to be driving luxury suvs?
Seams to be working out for him.
Climb through the front or out a window.
They don't.
Did you reply to the wrong person?
"Haha sorry, wasn‚Äôt trying to be creepy fellow Coloradoan! Awesome to have more of us on the road."
"Ah, that‚Äôs sweet!"
 I thing in Florida.
I‚Äôm in Virginia. I think we got nothing here.
"Also don‚Äôt forget sales tax exemption too, as well as discounted EZPass and HOV lane usage.  For once, NJ‚Äôs ahead of the curve ha"
Really? So Atlanta doesn‚Äôt  a lot of traffic and no traffic lights either? I visited Atlanta before but I guess I was wrong.
"Yeah, they get their premium rate. I know that it‚Äôs usually $100 for a Lyft Lux each way to/from my office, forty-five miles, ~$100/hr."
"And he also said, ""Could definitely use a long range though.""  


Keep in mind that refusing trips because he doesn't have enough range will cause a hit on his rating, and he can only accept a few 40 mile trips before he needs to recharge for a couple hours.  This severely impacts his ability to work successfully as a rideshare driver.    


Can he do it?  Sure, with limited success.  But it's not ideal in any way, shape, or fashion to be a rideshare driver with only a 200 mile range though."
"Insane, but I guess kids not being able to open the door accidentally while on the road outweighs this risk. I've seen that the model 3 will lock the electronic door opener from the inside when moving"

"I guess your Atlanta visit didn't include GA-400, I-285, I-75/85, or I-20... all of which are inside the city limits, and all of which have 70 mph speed limits, which equates to 80 mph eighteen wheelers.  


Hell, I've *followed* eighteen wheelers at 100 mph."

"The amount of doors that don‚Äôt open in a crash is really high. 

The only serious accident I was in meant leaving through the shattered window in a fully manual door 20 years ago. Because the door didn‚Äôt open, and we were upside down lol.  

Expecting your door to open in an accident electric or not is a crapshoot. 

The mechanical release is designed to protect against electrical failure not physical failure via deformation (or electrical failure via impact). 

Throw a window breaker in your car if you‚Äôre worried."
"Two charges, totaling 45-60 minutes each. He said that he charges twice. 

Keep in mind, this is an SR and not an LR. He needs to charge to a very high capacity. If you have ever Supercharged an SR, you would know that twenty minutes won‚Äôt cut it."
"Cabin safety has greatly improved from the vehicles you were likely to be crashing in 20 years ago though. Deformation is designed to happen around the cabin, not in it."
[deleted]
"The doors and roof deform still. Because they‚Äôre designed to.  You don‚Äôt want the roof pancaking of course, but give us inevitable, which will make the doors no longer square."
"Or I spent a bit driving rideshares, myself? Might know a thing or two about it."
"Landing on the roof is one thing, but even 16 years ago you could expect to be able to open your doors after a crash. https://youtu.be/qBDyeWofcLY"
[deleted]
"Dude, that‚Äôs literally one head-on accident with the door being opened from the outside.  Side impact is different.  

Jaws of life exist for a reason."
Hell I could go eighty miles on one trip and not leave the metro-Atlanta area.
"Oh, were we talking about side-impacts?

Did you know that in a side impact there‚Äôs usually one side of the car that‚Äôs not involved in the collision? 

There‚Äôs so many crash types, so you can keep dancing around all day if that‚Äôs your intention. Head-on collisions carry the most energy and are the most fatal ones relative to frequency. The difference between a well designed vehicle and one that isn‚Äôt is how well the cabin is protected. Where does the motor/engine go, does the pedal get showed up your leg, and are you able to open the door and get out afterwards. 

Obviously can openers exist for a reason, but the best car to be in (in a collision, because obviously it‚Äôs better to be in one that doesn‚Äôt collide) is one that doesn‚Äôt crush like a can in a collision."
[deleted]
"> then yeah a [Model 3] isn‚Äôt a good choice. 

No... the *Standard Range* Model 3 isn‚Äôt a good choice for any rideshare driver, just like he already said. 

> *Could definitely use a Long Range, though.*

He said it. I said it. And yet here you are, arguing that 200 miles of useful range is somehow practical for rideshare. The LR is 350 miles, which translates to ~300 miles real-world. While not perfect, the difference in both usability and profitability between 200 miles and 300 miles is enormous. 

Listen, it‚Äôs possible to be a rideshare driver with 200 miles of range. I get it, and I already said so. But this greatly limits your capabilities and profitability because you‚Äôll need to take an hour off your road time to drop off, find a Supercharger, recharge for forty-five minutes, and then drive back over to pick up your next ride. That‚Äôs an hour off the road, likely twice per shift assuming you drive 300 miles per shift (which is entirely common). You‚Äôre looking at nearly two hours of lost road time, which is a colossal hit to your profitability."
"Sounds exactly like when I floor it, just louder."

"This is not what a Tesla Motor normally sounds like. Here's a quote from the description of the original YouTube Video ""This particular one has a bad bearing that I need to replace, hence why it's ridiculously loud"""
"Alright, now replace it with the Sonic spin up noise."
I often keep my backseats folded down so I can hear the rear motors doing their thing. Spaceship sounds are cool.
I wonder how fast that's going...
Hey that sounds just like when I start warming up my nuclear laser
The sound of electrons screaming as they're converted to heat.
"I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve always been under the impression that the noise is fake, and that it was dead silent minus the tire road/wind noise

Edit: Like this motor noise was just because they had to add noise to comply with regulations is what I mean"
Everytime I drive the damn thing it feels like I'm in a spaceship... love it
"It is the sound of the future, as Giovanni Giorgio might say"
"Yeah, you can't tell me that doesn't sound cooler than an gas motor."
Fun fact: They used a variation of Tesla Roadster‚Äôs sounds for the Bat Pod in the Dark Knight movies
"Do you hear that, Big Oil?  That is the sound of inevitability.  That is the sound of.. your death."
I like watching the tires expand.
\*unzips\*
As a fan of both tesla and and rocket league I wish they would just put a tesla in rocket league. So pleasing for the eyes & ears.
I'm Back to the Future  movies the DeLorean was only a four-cylinder they had to add the sound of a V8 to make it sound more powerful.
That‚Äôs straight outta transformers.
Sounds like the into to Power Puff Girls
Hyperdrive
Where is the drop?
"Almost sounds like a higher pitched [Shepard‚Äôs Tone](https://youtu.be/BzNzgsAE4F0). 
 The sound that never stops rising"
I just got F-ZERO (SNES) flashbacks
That's not how it sounds like when it works properly. It's usually a much smoother lower frequency sound.
Look how they massacred my boy
"Why doesn‚Äôt Tesla sell these types of parts that can be put on traditional gas vehicles.  
Example: I love my old truck. 
I wish I could just gut out the engine and replace it with a battery from Tesla. My truck doesn‚Äôt need to do a whopping 200 miles in 10 seconds. All it needs to do is get from a to b and maybe once in a while hall stuff in the back. 

They could finance this move. 

Why am I saying sharing this stupid idea? I heard that gas vehicle will be illegal some time in the future :("
"Jesus, those cars even *sound* like the future.

Am want cybertruck."
"Good ol spaceship sound :D

I'm a little sad this cuts off so early, the downswing on regen sounds equally awesome. The wind from those rims is overwhelming the mic it seems!"
Sounds more Jetson-y than I realized.
"I wish Tesla had some kind of version of Porsche's ""Electric Sport Sound."" I know some people might not like it but it would be cool to have that option. Lots of car enthusiasts miss the sound aspect of driving when they switch over to a Tesla."
I‚Äôm just waiting for the local douchebags to add a fake exhaust on the thing.
I love that sound. I drive without music at times to just hear it
Fucking love that sound
That‚Äôs the movies.
Sounds like the future
Tesla motor too loud!
Amazing
"Glue a microphone to the motor, amplify and play the sound over the external speaker. 

Has anyone tried that?"
Sounds like Space Mountain at Disney.
ooOoOoo.  I was just scared all that power would knock the motor off that mount and then you'd be having all sorts of problems!
What is the actual noise besides of course awesomeness?  Is it the noise of the transfer case gears?
Love that sound!
"Sounds like the intro to Surfing With the Alien.

https://youtu.be/U5t2kDqvoYY"
Yikes that got scary at the end! yesyesyesyesn..yes
The car sound scifi movies promised me.
Sounds like stealth jet
I'm going to mod my tesla so that you can hear it in all its glory (once I get one)
That's a failing drive unit right there...... It's not supposed to high pitch wine like that. What revision is the part?
"I heard that electric cars make very little noise, but I hear nothing at all!

And then I remembered that videos are auto-muted."
now do it without tires and wheels. it likely.sounds different
Thought the THX logo was going to appear.
Sounds like the intro to an early 2000‚Äôs song
Refreshing ngl
Sounds like the Dolby surround sound sequence at the beginning of films
That is hands down the best acceleration noise I've come across.
"Sounds like the little thing they use at the dentist to make holes in your teeth that make the pain bugger and you just keep asking yourself ""why didnt you get an anesteisa you dum bit-.. Sorry got off topic"
"I like this. My Ioniq sounds nothing like that, but call me crazy... I like the VESS"
That looks scary
I expected the jettisons noise for a second
Sound used for the batmobile in the dark knight trilogy.
"It would be cool to have a transmission just so that we can ""rev"" the motor. Wonder if the Porsche Taycan 2-speed transmission can disengage like this?"
"That sound is exactly why I need to change my tires after 8,000 miles..."
The pink noise coming in towards the end is creepy. That's how fast those tires are moving!
Beautiful
Sounds like pinball
Just put that Ace card next a wheel to give it that ‚Äúvroom‚Äù sound lol
Sounds like [3D Pinball Space Cadet](https://youtu.be/Zjahf8b1Itc) included in windows :D
You‚Äôre not convincing me that isn‚Äôt a hyperdrive accelerator in action
1.21 Gigawatts!!
This is the sound of the future.
Tuck in your hoody strings.
Sounds like my electric skateboard right up until it sounded like a spaceship.
Mmm... that was nice!  #Eargasm  :)
"What's creating the sound, the bearings or the gears etc? I think the cleaner the contact, the less sound it would make."
"Warp 5, engage!"
"I can‚Äôt find anyone who can tell me what the source of the sound is. Sure the gears will have sound as they ramp up, but that‚Äôs not all that‚Äôs going on right? What on the inverter makes sound?"
The fact that they suppressed this sound is sad. It needs to be generated when accelerating ! hey u/elonmusk ....

One of my favorite parts of backing out of the garage and starting my drive for the day is that initial motor sound.
[deleted]
Where‚Äôs the click I hear every time I step on the peddle. Or let off.  Or slalom.  Still love the car deeply.
.
That's the sound of everyone losing
Those motors need to get smaller and lighter like the lucid air ones. Can't wait for Tesla to switch to 800 volts in the long term
I want this sound in the cabin! Artificial or not...give it to me Elon!
Yeah it sounds neat but I would legit pay DLC $ for some fun acceleration sounds from the speakers. I want the Jetsons spaceship sound.
Ewwww
whenever I floor it I feel like im in a Jet about to take off
I love that sound!
"If you ever have to take out the back bench seat (like to fold the back down flat), it exposes a lot of this sound."
this sounds way better
The video says that this unit has a bad bearing.
I like how you can see the three poles of the motor when the hub starts spinning.
Favorite Tesla video. I can't believe I've watched that 1.7 Million times.
Holy Shi  - - - - -     T
Wait I thought Tesla didn't spend any money on marketing? That definitely looks like an ad? Really got me pumped nevertheless!
Amazing video but holy cow what aspect ratio is that?? It‚Äôs basically a panorama
Are they painted by hand? Wtf
Man that video isn‚Äôt wide enough for me   /s
[Original Video](https://youtu.be/_Rg75JbVOpg)
Sounds badass... but better to get that fixed.
That would be so dope.
Haha you should ping elon on twitter with that idea :D
I would pay cash money for that feature.
"My boyfriend named his Model 3 Sonic, he would lose it if this ends up happening."
"Neat, I'll have to try that."
I read this after I installed my baby car seat -.-
Just remove the insulation from under the carpet
I have a dual motor M3. Is it much different with a single rear motor?
Mine are folded down now from picking up some large items. I think I'll keep them down & listen for it for a bit! :-D
At least 7 speed
[Source video](https://youtu.be/_Rg75JbVOpg) description says 135 MPH.
135 mph
And kinetic energy.
"Try driving with no music, I can hear it pretty loud and clear in my AWD 3"
"The wires in an AC electric motor physically vibrate due to induction between the stator and rotor, and the third law of physics (equal and opposite reaction). That movement of the wires creates sound with a frequency closely matching the AC frequency input into the motor. The inverter can adjust the sine wave which adjusts the sound, but usually for efficiency reasons optimizing power consumption and generated torque is more important than reducing noise. If the inverter operates at a very high or very low frequency the motor may not be audible to humans though, that's why at the end of the clip is starts to become quiet (the frequency is getting very high). There are other things that can create sound though as well, such as bearings, the reduction drive's gear teeth, the inverter itself, the rotor moving through air, etc."
This motor has bad bearings
"My understanding is that newer Teslas actually do make a noise emitted from a speaker to comply with regulations. 

But yes, older Teslas make noise purely from the sound of the motor spinning."
"This is not actually the what a tesla motor sounds like. This video was stolen from someone who originally posted it on YouTube and here is part of the description ""This particular one has a bad bearing that I need to replace, hence why it's ridiculously loud"""
"My favourite electric motor sound comes from the Trains on the Jubilee line. They have this crazy, almost sci-fi sound. I always thought it was an added sound, but the motors were ‚Äútuned‚Äù to sound that way."
Dude. Same. Exact. Sound. In my head (not gonna look it up because my memory is probably off) ;)
That's because in this scenario it doesn't have any resistance. Then it'll sound higher pitched.
"Yeah, I wish Tesla would embrace the sound instead of trying to mask/dampen it, at least as an option for car enthusiasts. And once they start adding multi-speed transmission to give you back the control over shifting it to some degree.

I just hate losing that feeling and being able to know when I want to do something like shifting based on the sound.

You lose a huge amount of control in acceleration. I don't want it to just be based on how much I depress the pedal. They could even simulate gears for all I care because all it ends up being is essentially sensitivity control on the pedal. If I can change sensitivity on my mouse why shouldn't I be able to switch between it on a Tesla? What if I don't want instant torque or have it kick in based on more than just how much I depress the pedal?"
The audience now has whiplash.
"Kinda souns like a jet engine starting up.

[This](https://youtu.be/jFS8pzBZU5c?t=57)"
Yes and no. Start up of a larger more powerful motor as it ramps up on a soft starter or VFD.
There‚Äôs no sound like it.  People jizz over muscle car engines but I have never heard anything as slick as when I floor my M3.
I love the jet sound coming to a stop when the car is put in park too.
Its so much fun to floor it.
"I get nauseous when I floor it. Still incredibly fun, though."
"Same! It feels subtle and futuristic. 

My M3 makes me go from loving combustion engine roaring sound to hating it for being so noisy."
"I'm assuming the pitch keeps getting higher past my range of hearing, or did it start coasting?"
"Yep, failing drive unit. Pitted bearing from electrolosis."
Like all early Tesla motors ;)
"I had to go back and watch it again, but you're totally right! That is neat!"
"I'm blind, where and when and what am i meant to be seeing?"
"They paid to make the video, but they don't pay for their content and logo to be in TV ads or website ads etc."
"They don‚Äôt pay for advertising. They do, and always have, paid for marketing."
You saw the painting robots later.
"Maybe you can pay extra for some custom paint jobs, which are probably done by hand since they're one-offs."
"Seriously.

Also appropriate username"
Yeah lol. Depending on how loud you can hear it inside the car it might be pretty annoying
Done: https://twitter.com/BloodBlight/status/1326720344430796800?s=19
Just return the baby and the car seats. Simple!
Tell your baby to sit somewhere else
"I cut a hole in the floor where the motors sit, removed the seats and carpets too. Sounds good for a day after which you realize its like listening to a fucking blender all the time."
I don't know. I also have a dual motor.
That's... Not wrong...
Wow - that braking is all regen? That's pretty powerful...
I can clearly hear everything in my model 3. Its not a quiet car by any stretch of the imagination.
I've definitely noticed differences in motor (and inverter?) sound between firmware updates.
Does that mean the order of vibration causes the upshift-like sounds?
"I assume you're talking about the pedestrian warning system - which is only active at low speeds.

That's not really related to hard acceleration, such as that in the video."
"That's only under 19mph or when reversing. The speaker is inside the front bumper in front of the passenger side wheel. It takes about 2 minutes to pull the clips off, unplug the speaker, and put it back together."
"Not exactly, this is a broken drive unit. It shouldn't be this loud."
"I see. There is also another sound there, like there is some loose part or scraping though"
Can confirm.
Yeah I wish you could hear more of the Tesla motors. Makes you feel more connected with the diving experience
"My last two cars were new BMW‚Äôs.  I thought I loved and needed the sound.

Now in the words of my 9 year old nephew ‚ÄúGeorge Mode Activate‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt drive fast with him of course, just enough to hear a little of the whine.  Oh and George is the name of my Model 3."
I hear a high pitched coil whine that makes me feel like I'm in the future.
I want my Tesla and Bolt to emit the sound the Jetsons space car makes when it accelerates.
"Meanwhile, a big part of my decision to buy a Tesla was that I've been wanting a performance sedan which doesn't sound like a douchemobile when you hit the go pedal."
M3's do sound really good. Twin turbo inline 6. Mmmm
E39 M5 Son
This is not the motor from your model 3 though. This is the old model X/S pm motor
When you set a supercharger as your destination and it sounds like you‚Äôre going 100mph pulling out of your parking lot lol
"I get a little light-headed.  

All the G baby!"
I don‚Äôt know I imagine the speakers on your phone aren‚Äôt going to put out the exact same sound those motors were
*Bwah*. It just got pitted. So pitted.
"before the wheel makes 1 revolution, you can see that there is a small slowdown every 120¬∞"
That‚Äôs what a roof rack is for
I'm considering having my classic pickup converted using a Tesla drivetrain. Nice thing is that I could just roll the window down to hear it!
"Regen is pretty strong, yeah. Though remember that there's no 4000 lb car being slowed down from 135-0 in this clip. Just some wheels."
Something tells me you have an early build :(
My M3 is some kind of parabolic mirror for sounds.
"Super jealous of those double-pane windows coming.

The car is so quiet to everyone around you and so loud inside. :("
"Yeah, I remember at some point Tesla increased the range of the the various Model 3 trims. I think Elon mentioned it was due to inverter optimization but there may have been some fiddling with the amount of kWhs the battery reserves below 0 miles of range remaining. The inverter can definitely be noisy though, there was one update that made charging become quite a bit louder but they resolved it a few updates later."
"I thought it was only active in reverse? The ‚Äòufo‚Äô sound, right?"
"Ah alright. I'm not an expert but I can imagine it sounds different without resistance. Do you have a video with the normal sound? I'm curious.

Got to say; sounds pretty cool tough. Like some spaceship going into warp mode."
If you drop the seats in the m3 you can hear the rear a bit more ;)
"Now that I think of it, piping engine noise into the vehicle has been becoming pretty common in ICE vehicles. I wonder if anyone has floated the idea of doing the same with electrics."
"Take out the bottom part of the rear seat, [just 2 clips and 2 wire connections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNQla0zTg1Q). I take out the bottom cushion every time I am going to sleep in the car or need a flat base. I left the top seats up one time and it was noisy."
"If it's any consolation, in the laguna seca vid it sounded loud af"
I haven't tried on a 3 but on the S you can tune the radio into AM frequencies and get a F1 car vibe.
How long before there is an option to amplify the noise of the motors lol. Sorta like when those that buy civics or acuras to put that loud ass annoying exhaust so you can hear them 20 miles down the road...
The coil whine gets really annoying when you don't want it though. That high pitch.
"It‚Äôs so good!  If you accelerate slowly you get more of a hum IMO, but when you floor it you get like dog-whistle levels of whine!"
"A V8 is the sound of a car with balls. Teslas arent performance due to their weight and hard suspension. 

And for bikes any inline 4 is power, I dunno what else you expect when you ride it.

People buy V10s for the sounds and the occasional lucky V12 owners.

https://youtu.be/KTRCc7o8g28


And nothing is douchey about any Supra that can blow the doors off of 2020 stock sports cars

https://youtu.be/8MfSnj-3_sc


You can have V10 upscale refined race sounds or Supra/GTR machine gun launches. But due to weight alone, the Tesla couldnt fall under ""performance"". It's rock hard and I wouldnt want to push it through corners the same I throw a Miata or motorcycle.


This is performance and iconic

https://youtu.be/6wyPTUvxbY0"
I never said it was? Lol
Why 120¬∞? Isn't there a reduction gearbox between the motor and the wheel?
oooohhhhhh..
Trailer hitch
Hah yeah... that'd make a fair difference :P
How are Teslas at highway speeds? Loud?
September 2019
"mine is a 2020 and the creaks, rattles, and whistling are all within specs."
"> ‚ÄúThe Pedestrian Warning System (PWS) is an audible tone played when the vehicle is moving slowly (up to 19 mph) in either Drive or Reverse. The sound is played via a speaker mounted in the front fascia and alerts nearby pedestrians of the car‚Äôs presence in low-speed situations.‚Äù 

[https://electrek.co/2019/09/10/tesla-pedestrian-warning-system-model-3/](https://electrek.co/2019/09/10/tesla-pedestrian-warning-system-model-3/)

That said, I don't know how it actually got implemented."
I discovered this after transporting a tv and being too lazy to put the seats back up. I left the seats down for two weeks until someone needed to ride in the back.
"Yep, I like to sleep in the back occasionally so now I just leave the seats out all the time. It sounds awesome."
"When I picked up summer tyres for my old Mustang, I dropped the rear seats and I could really hear the fuel pump. Damn. I really need to get a Tesla."
Has to be the sound from the jetsons or nothing.
The Porsche Taycan does...
"I have considered this. A long time ago, I used to play Segway Polo and one of the guys figured out a way to amplify the motor sounds using guitar pickups under the motors fed into a battery-powered amp.  It would take some experimentation but I'm sure there are lots of EMF sources that you could touchlessly tap into."
"It was a very stripped down car, right? I have that video saved, mostly because of the sound. How fast do these motors spin?"
No AM radio on the 3.
"But, I never not want it. I get giddy when the car preconditions before supercharging and get more coil wine than normal."
"Eh, to each their own I guess?  Like I said, I've been looking for a quiet ""performance"" sedan for a while.  You can define performance however you want.  I don't really want a car with ""balls"" or whatever.  All of those things you linked are annoying to me, and intentionally being loud is generally considered an obnoxious habit. I don't enjoy waking up my neighbors or alerting every cop in the area when I accelerate hard."

"Why are yall thinking too much, that's what the trunk (or even the frunk) is for."
"Fun fact, even for gas powered vehicles, at highway speeds, more than 50% of the noise your car makes is air being squeezed under the tires rapidly.

TONS of engineering goes into designing tires to maximize grip and performance, as well as minimize noise."
Our 2020 is pretty quiet. I measure cabin noise with my Watch  and it usually reports 63-65 dB on a freeway at 65 mph
A lot quieter than my old Jeep was. Everything is relative.
"Newer Model 3's are MUCH quieter than early builds but even early builds are fine! With most ICE cars you don't really realize how much air noise there is because of the engine. The BMW I had previously was actually much louder overall when driving.  I have some very annoying wind noise with my Model 3, but it's a \~March 2019 build.  The very latest have double laminated glass and a lot of soundproofing."
Yes...no different than a regular unmodified ice sedan.
"Very loud. Model 3's have awful sound deadning but like the other person who replied to you, it depends what you're coming from. 

I came/still have a BMW, Mercedes etc and the Model S is clearly louder at 100kph even though there's no engine which is testament to the level of quality differences between German and American built cars. However the BMW is an M car with super low profile tyres and gets quite noisy at 100kph as well. The Mercedes however with higher profile tyres is like night and day. 

I haven't been able to compare it to a new model S or X and can only compare it to my 2017 model S. However was able to drive a 2019 model 3 performance and noticed the highway noise straight away. Was terrible imo coming from the cars I drove before hand. 

If you come from cars that are louder then in comparison you won't perceive it to be 'loud'"
I traded from a honda fit to a model 3. The model 3 is super quiet in that comparison - not that it's a good one
"I would say that my June 2018-built Model 3 is a little bit quieter than my 2012 Prius C was at the same speed during typical highway driving, but it's certainly not silent. I've heard they've made significant improvements to the road and wind noise generated by the car in more recent builds, though."
"Not at all. I only hear mine when I have the radio off, it's more audible at lower speeds than higher speeds, and if I have music playing even at low volume, I generally don't hear the motorb at all.

Wind noise and tire noise if what you'll hear, and those are just as loud as any car."
"Ah, not too long after my build. Mine is alright, but there's a crispy wind noise on the driver side that I can't figure out how to fix. Very annoying.  It's quieter than my BMW M235i was and the Audi A3 before that."
:(
Interesting I neeeeever hear mine going forward but hear it clear as day in reverse.
Motor noise in the P is much more noticeable then the Sr+
Do^do^^do^^^do
The Taycan uses an off-putting artificial motor sound in the cabin from what I've heard from reviews.
Peak motor speed is something like 18k RPM.
I thought the second video had full interior?
Raspberry Pi with an AM addon and bluetooth to the car could fix that.
"You shouldn't be surprised that you've received pushback on your opinion, given how eloquently you delivered it."
"Performance is weight, choice of manual transmission. That's why trucks and SUVs arent likely candidates though manufacturers are trying with the Porsche Cayenne, Jeep Cherokee, Lamborghini Urus and of course the AMG / Brabus G Wagen.

A car that does everything for you isnt that much performance but a nanny version of a car. That's why the R35 Nissan GTR had criticism for being auto only and being such a pigfat version of a coupe. Who knows why, maybe Nissan didnt want sales to suffer from the Z series. They could have easily put the GTR powertrain in the Z.

Calling out an entire segment of cars and people (100%) per your definition as douches because fast car bad, but fast electric car = not a douche?

You can't have it both ways. Maybe Tesla owners are the real douches because they have to let people know they drive a Tesla? When people that have driven Priuses, Honda Insights, Nissan Leafs have been on the environmentally friendly bandwagon for ages.

Throw in Golf and Jetta TDI also for the same category.

Cant rep Tesla just because you bought it. Credit would be given if you had an Insight when it first came out."
"Okay, but shouldn't that be every 120¬∞ at the motor? The video shows a wheel hub, which comes after the gearbox."
That‚Äôs super interesting. I guess that‚Äôs too why I‚Äôve read about people describing the difference between driving Model 3‚Äôs with aero wheels and without.
"My watch measures similar (64-66dB) at 110km/ƒß in a 2018 P3D-, so the discrepancy in people‚Äôs experiences may be more to do with prior experience than with build date/quality/model. I definitely wish mine was a lot quieter with road noise, which new windows don‚Äôt help with"
agreed..I come from merc and lexus...I have the 2020 m3 lr and this thing is loud for a car this price....  If this thing were an ice - tech...it would be cheap junk.
"Both of those cars are garbage in terms of cabin isolation. My mom also had an A3 and one point, I hate the suspension too."
"Maybe, whenever you go forward, you accelerate hard enough that the engine drowns it out? :P"
The noise is very different between forward and reverse. Forward it's more of a fan noise which I can only really hear it while in a garage.
Probably because 1 vs 2 motors
Along with the new mustang
"Were there two? The only one I have seen is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hmdmYRYt9A&ab_channel=Tesla), I was under impression this was a stripped down interior."
Maybe that 1100hp+ overcame the sound dampening materials
This is one of the most millennial things I have ever read and understood. Sad cringe.
"Meh, dude literally has no comments on the sub and has probably never driven a Tesla. Not sure if this got linked somewhere or what, but I stand by my opinion that loud cars are annoying (definitely not the only one who thinks that), and yeah, I do find it a bit amusing how butthurt people get that Tesla's are quiet."
k
Model 3 has barely any sound deadening I feel. If we opened up the door panels there would be minimal material used
Yep.
"I think undecided Matt ferrall said it overcompensates for minor throttle engagement or something.

An opinion you‚Äôre entitled to.  I just don‚Äôt understand why you double down on the immaturity of the delivery of that opinion.
"By your definition a douchemobile is anyone that has an actual fast car that came stock from the factory.

 But somehow you wanting a Tesla because of how instant torque works in all electric motors makes you not a douche? 

Just because it makes sounds because that's 100% normal in the everyday present day definition of a fast cars doesn't make the person a douche. The actual douchebag is the person calling others douchebags over an incorrect interpretation of what a ""performance car"" is.

Dont kid yourself about that. The vast majority of Tesla owners are people that cant find Neutral when they take their car to the car wash and risk reversing through the whole line or Ludicrous Mode the entire car through the wash. I dunno, they're too filthy rich to wash their own cars or getting dirty is for ""douchey"" people so they cant ever dare to get their hands wet or get down on their knees and scrub the rims free of brake dust."

Nice! How do I get one?
This is the first I‚Äôve heard of the shot glasses? Where can I get one
I'd definitely buy one.
I'll just have to fill it with tea.
I really want the bottle but I'm looking to sell all my shit and move on to a sail boat in about 5 years so I don't want to accumulate more stuff =/
I'm gonna get a bottle and fill it with premium gasoline and hold on to it forever eventually becoming a relic. It'll contain the last drops of gasoline known to man.

So people can fill it themselves..
Yes yes yes!! I'm a recovering alcoholic but really wanted this for the bottle. Almost bought 2 when they were on sale but couldn't get this shipped to NC. By the time I arranged it with a buddy in another state they were sold out!. I really want one of these bottles!!

As an under 21 Tesla fan/shareholder/member of a Tesla family‚Ä¶ fuck yeah!!!
What if you buy the bottle and they ‚Äúgive‚Äù you the tequila?
How the heck do we get notified of new Tesla products? I had no idea they were even selling Tequila until I read about it this morning. I would have LOVED to get a bottle.
Curious as to what the bottle price will be given they filled the original offering with a $35 tequila and sold it for $250.
Yes! I don't like tequila but would love to get the bottle and mount it over my charger.
Great! I'm a sober person but I'd like to get my hands on the bottle at least.

Might be easier if you put an LCD behind it with some fake liquid filling it up.  But that's not as cool as genuine green liquid of course.
"The bottle is hand made so probably quite expensive.

But it'd be really cool. If you make it tip and pour as it empties and fill it straight from the top as it charges you don't even need to make any holes (I'd be afraid of shattering it....)"

"So, if you mix bleach with water, it diffuses light differently than just plain water/other liquids. I've seen them use water bottles with bleach as makeshift lights in some third world improvement efforts... Maybe you could do that, and then use an LED (or several) beneath the bottle so that it would have an effervescent glow in whatever color the Pi would tell it. Would be a cool status indicator, red, yellow, green for charging perhaps."

"If you want to actually do the liquid instead of LEDs behind it, what you could do is have two reservoirs. One is one that a parastoltic pump is fed from to increase/decrease the level, the other one can be the main one that could be one of those reservoir/pump PC water cooling loop things.

Then you can have a constant flow of liquid in/out of the bottle (pretty easy with a cork with two holes) which I feel like would be a cool effect.

If no ""constant movement"" look is wanted, a parastoltic pump and single reservoir should do it. Those are easy enough to control very specifically. You could even have an opaque tube going down from the top so that it blends in to the background"
Cut a hole in the bottom and have a computer controlled pump push green fluid into the bottle.
"How about a plasma tesla coil bottle. That would look cool, and It can get stronger as you charge the car."
"As a lover of colored/stained glass (yeah we exist), I'd love to have that bottle to display, but given that it's hand-made and the ""Tesla Tax"" I can absolutely see it going for well >$100"
They would certainly sell more bottles I'm thinking they can price it higher than the liquid filled version... Will kinda make the liquid version more of a collectable. Its not mass produced... hand made from what I understand.

InBev heavily lines Texas politicians‚Äô pockets to keep the distributions laws in place. It gets chipped away at but not nearly enough.
"Oregon, Virginia, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania all have state-controlled liquor sales and distribution. It‚Äôs not a southern thing or even a red state thing."
"Yeah, Texan here. Such freedom. However, liquor stores close at 9 PM."
"Not all the southern states. 

I live in Missouri, where Anheuser Busch basically wrote our alcohol laws after prohibition. You can buy anything anywhere. Gas stations sell hard liquor and single cans and bottles of cold beer. Open container is actually legal for passengers. Target, Walgreens and CVS all sell booze and there are no state owned liquor stores. 

IIRC, the sale times are restricted but it‚Äôs something silly like no alcohol sales between 2 and 6 AM so it‚Äôs hardly an inconvenience. 

Liquor laws here are fantastic despite being back asswards in every other way."

Agreed! There are a lot of great ideas below. I‚Äôm so glad to see so much interest in the project. I‚Äôll plan to tackle the hardware/software early so I just have to wait on the Teslaqila bottle.
Thanks! Yeah that‚Äôs the game plan. A hidden reservoir and a peristaltic pump. It‚Äôs my first time working with liquids so still doing some research. If you see any comparable projects feel free to pass them along :)

the Tequila in the $35 bottle is a Reposado which is only aged between 2 months and 364 days (just shy of a year). the Tequila in the $250 bottle is an A√±ejo which is aged for 15 months, well within the classification of an Anejo which is aged for at least one year but less than 3 years."

"> computer water cooling system coolant..

exactly what i had in mind.

I'm a software guy not a hardware guy - what kind of mechanism do you use to determine the level?  Maybe just some sort of float in the reservoir and then if you know the level in the reservoir then you know the level in the bottle?

And what type of pump do you use to hold a level vs a flow rate?"

"Sure, you can do whatever you want. Other questions include but not limited to the following -

Will Tesla ever find out? Will they care? Will you do more than one run of them? Will they litigate? 

If you did one run of knock offs they'd almost certainly make it through customs and you'd make so little money that Tesla wouldn't care. In fact it would cost Tesla more to care than you made. Lawyers are expensive. 

If it was an ongoing thing you risk your shipments possibly getting intercepted by customs as knock offs. I always assumed there's a paradox when it comes to this where if you have really low volumes it won't get noticed and if you have very high volumes it also won't get noticed. But right in the middle is where they catch on.

Still thinking this through, but maybe something like [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/464) in a hidden bottle with comparable dimensions so the Rpi can track fill level, and run water pumps to fill/empty the display bottle and hidden bottle. Feel free to throw any other ideas to streamline the design. I‚Äôd rather not have a liquid level sensor sitting in the display bottle.

edit: yeah, hidden bottle as reservoir (just to be clear)"
"> intercepted by customs as knock offs

From my understanding that's only if the product had a protected trademark on it, or something easily mistaken as one. This is a driving reason why Apple has begun adding their logo to every little device part and ribbon cable used in their devices over the last several years. They can't stop identical ribbon cables from being imported for repairing their products, but anything unofficial with the Apple logo they can have confiscated because of that logo alone.

So if the bottle was the same shape but without the laser etched tesla mark for instance, it should be legal. It isn't very likely they were granted any sort of protection for a lightning bolt shaped bottle.

Obligatory IANAL but follow a lot of tech IP and counterfeit lawsuits, seeing where the lines seem to actually be drawn."
"this was helpful thanks. 

>intercepted by customs as knock offs

is a good point. i would not want tesla annoyed at me. someday i hope to have a referral code. (anyone have a referral code you arent using and want to give me full ownership of, perhaps for a nominal price?)"

Battery day was a world changing event. Stock is meh.

S&P500 inclusion. Stock is UP !"
Holy crap. It's happening. I guess it was just a matter of time with the way the company is growing and expanding.

Ah fuck. My limit buy order didn't get filled today. RIP
Sweet. Can't wait for Rob's video tomorrow.
Already up 10% after hours.
Now I Wonder how much people gonna use their stock to buy a Tesla.
I bought my 1 share recently when the price hit $420.   I felt it was appropriate.
Bought at 989 (197 post split equivalent) on a whim in June. Best decision I made all year.
I've went from 100% TSLA in January to all time low 60% TSLA just this morning. Stop telling me to diversify dangit.
"Holy moly! When the stock market opens tomorrow my stock position in Tesla will have rising by approximately 200,000 $ in just this year. I turned 28 last month and Tesla has made me financially independent before turning 30. I have been buying Tesla consistently since i tried out a Tesla Model S for the first time in the beginning of 2016. It was so clear by then to me that Tesla would disrupt the car industry the way that Apple did with the smartphone industry. This exponential curve that we have seen begun in January this year has just started folks. Hop on and enjoy the ride - this is by NO MEANS over yet.

Congratulations to my fellow Tesla investors!

 GOD DAMNIT I love Elon!"
I had to finish paying for grad school so I sold my tsla last week... .. .
Boom.
I would love to be a fly on the wall at Gordon Johnson‚Äôs house tonight. Somebody send him some short shorts!!

Savage!
"So what should we expect the stock price to do now it‚Äôs going the S&P?  Obviously it‚Äôll go up, but is there precedent to help anticipate what sort of gains may be expected because of this inclusion?

Also does that mean Tesla now is also subject to the ebb/flow of the S&P itself?  What new risks does inclusion bring?

Good times?"
Boom. Hello morning stock price!
Is it too late to invest now?

fool me once.....
I wonder if they asked to wait until they paid out Elon‚Äôs last block of shares before this happened.
This was a nice surprise for me today
dang i shoulda bought some more while it was down.
What does this mean? What can i do with this information?
"Mmm, mmm..."
Wasn‚Äôt there a decision to add it to S & P 500 few months ago? What happened then?
"this explains why Elon had change of tone with anything that could effect TSLA stock price, started around the time S&P500 didn't include TSLA. pretty sure something interesting happened... 

This means there is a  high probability that Tesla intentionally toned down the battery day presentations to reduce stock price movements, remember Elon twitted the day before Battery day saying the technology won't be fully implemented until 2 years later. 

Hopefully that is the case and Tesla has a lot more positive news they didn't announce."
Do you think they will still get included if Elon dies of Covid?

"(cross-posting my comment from WSB:)

Guys, this is the **BIGGEST** equity index addition & funding round in history by dollar value:

https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/media-center/news-announcements/#indexNews

The scale of this event is mind-blowing:

- Passive S&P 500 index following funds (over 5 trillion dollars of assets under management) alone will in the next 4 weeks reallocate 1.01% of their assets and buy & hold 127 million TSLA shares (worth $52b) and **effectively move them out of circulation**. This alone is more than 17% of the free float.
- But there's another 6.5 trillion dollars of actively managed funds indexed to the S&P 500. They too will buy & hold TSLA shares, worth about $65b, over 22% of the TSLA free float. Many of them own TSLA already - but most of them don't.
- An important detail is that TSLA was not part of the S&P 400 already - in which case for most funds the addition is only an internal reshuffling. It's a **new** addition, which is rare - and the magnitude of the TSLA S&P 500 addition is unprecedented.

In total that's **removing around 40% of TSLA's free float from circulation**,  similar to a TSLA share buyback program of $110b ...

Remember what happened after AAPL gradually bought back ~35% of their shares over the past 7 years? This is now happening to TSLA over just a few weeks ...

The +10% after-hours could just be the beginning... ü§†"
"Damn, and I was just thinking this weekend I should pick a few more up."
"Wow... 9% after hours jump. I‚Äôm crapping my pants right now. I was crushed when Tesla didn‚Äôt make the S&P back in September and I thought the stock price was going to stay stuck at around 400, but now I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked to see 500+."
Hope so!  But never forget - after that type of graph you end up with one like this: [Post Run-Up Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&list=PLahKLy8pQdCM0SiXNn3EfGIXX19QGzUG3)

yooo same but at 420... is there any way for us to close the gap here or do we just have to live with the fact that we screwed up?
Damn I would've sold them way more otm than that.
"It's not so much about how amazing a company is, as much as how amazing people think the company is. 

Probably 75% of investors didn't understand the magnitude of the reveal on battery day. Sure numbers are nice, but it won't be seen for years was probably the major thinking. 

Being a tech guy, that shit blew my mind in many ways. Didn't expect it to change the stock much tho, just made me buy more."
"Buy the rumor, sell the news. The rally leading up to battery day equated to the event being ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù. S and p inclusion was also priced in but sold off after news of the first rejection from inclusion. This news came out of nowhere so it will include both new retail buyers to buy the event as well as new institutional investors to track the s and p indices."
yea but s&p is a mechanical event. what i mean is indexes have to buy it up and remove part of the float forever. so it holds a higher bottom for the price. battery day was actually meh because non of their technologies are releasing soon.
Tesla stock only seems to move up with news of financial changes like a stock split or sandp 500 inclusion.
Of course. What else would it be?
$COSTco did what?
Samsies
It'll probably be very soon. Fyi there's nothing he can really add beyond his series of S&P500 inclusion videos he already made!

Nice! I bought my first share around that stock price.... pre split lol.
"I sold at 950 because I believe it's overvalued. Still do, but I've learned to never bet against elon.

Don't be a sheep and think for yourself. It makes no sense for me to diversify. Besides Tesla is 10+ startups. I'm well diversified.
"Knock knock, this is  short term capitol gains speaking ..."
Congrats but I'm selling my position tomorrow LOL
Good job man!  I wish I was as smart as you at your age. I bought drugs and alcohol with half my money at your age and wasted the other half on flashy cars.

"The S&P500 tracks the top 500 American companies stock. In order to do that they have to own a percentage of the stocks they track.

I think yahoo was the last large company to get added, their stock skyrocketed on the weeks after the news of being added into the S&P500"
Tree fiddy
"I have noticed that too. It‚Äôs the retail investors. They need to get some cash, move it to their trading account, set up some limits, wait till Tuesday dip, etc."
"Dad?

PS: Happy cake day!"
Haha congrats! How many shares do you own if I might ask?
You could stand to make a $100 or so.
The S&P500 tracks the top 500 American companies stock valuation. In order to do that they must own a percentage of their stock. I forget the exact details but it's been worked out that loads of big companies will have to buy millions of stocks in the next few weeks. People know this so they don't necessarily want to sell low and this pushes the stock way up.
"'finally'?

I don't see how you could have owned it for any length of time and still be down."
"BTC not doing bad itself lately, back up to $17k"
"With the market cap of TSLA, more like the S&P will be subject to the volatility of TSLA... though the massive institutional investment should hopefully settle things down nicely."
"Several big index funds will need to shift about 1% of their holdings into TSLA, which is a lot of money, but a lot of investors bought TSLA expecting this to happen, and are ready to cash out. When we see TSLA trading at $460 after the announcement, that means the aftermarket investors are betting they'll be able to sell TSLA for at least that much in December. For a normal company, this would probably be a pretty good guess of the future price, but Tesla is not normal. It could be quite a bit higher, or quite a bit lower."
"no, but only if you're oriented long term. Tesla might be a bit overvalued now, but this is just the begining of this company.  Remember, they want to build lots of gigafactories, and at the moment they have only 3 operational.  They will get a lot bigger than they are now."
"New meme price, $694.20 

Make it happen Elon."
Just wait for another split
"Elon is something else, his car company is up 13% in after hours, even though it was already the largest market cap player in the industry and he's like ""whatever, busy with SpaceX launch""."
What does that mean?
Thank you for you sacrifice üèÖ
Oh god please please
shoulda kinda maybe whadayaknow thunk
Means there might be a bump in the stock price before the end of the year.

"If this materializes, rip the Tesla short sellers lmao"
"As a new investor with 63% of my net worth in TSLA. Can you remind me what happened when AAPL ""gradually bought back 35% of their shares in 7 years.""  i mean if you're referring to AAPL going up almost 1k%.. do you really think that will happen to TSLA over a few weeks... I mean NIO is up almost a thousand percent in 2 months.. so I'm not saying it CANT happen.."
"Kimball musk emoji, nice."
Lol.  Not selling here.
">But there's another 6.5 trillion dollars of actively managed funds indexed to the S&P 500. They too will buy & hold TSLA shares, worth about $65b, over 22% of the TSLA free float. Many of them own TSLA already - but most of them don't.

Not all of this $65B would be purchased. Some of the actively managed funds may choose to go underweight $TSLA some of those are more heavily weighted TSLA than the S&P 500 would be (e.g. some of Vanguard's funds), they may sell $TSLA to become equal weight.  
  
>In total that's removing around 40% of TSLA's free float from circulation, similar to a TSLA share buyback program of $110b ...

It would be lower than this. Probably more than 20%, but not quite up to 40%.  
  
>Remember what happened after AAPL gradually bought back ~35% of their shares over the past 7 years? This is now happening to TSLA over just a few weeks ...

Tesla would issue tens of millions of new shares to absorb some of that demand. Not all of the profit would be returned to investors."
"Can you explain how this is similar to a share buyback?  I thought buybacks increased EPS and dividends/share by reducing the number of shares.  The number of outstanding shares in this case would not change.  Am I misunderstanding buybacks or this situation?
Thanks."
Wouldn't the S&P 400 be a subset of the S&P 500?
why this weekend and not a few days before the weekend when it was $38x ? So many opportunities.
"I was about to sell all of my shares today, but the laziness of not wanting to cancel my stop-loss order kept me from doing that, not joking. **S**nake jazz **&** **P**olynesian elevator music here I come"

How is this still true today?
unless you stop thinking that way and get involved.
"You can buy them out and roll them up... but that's really expensive. Your best bet is just to let them be called away, hoping that the stock has a correction before your expiration. 

Hey, you MADE MONEY. It's lost opportunity, but not lost capital."
You could roll to higher strike and later expiration date.
"buy to close is the only way to keep your shares.... if your calls are covered with stocks, just use the proceeding to sell puts next week... most likely you will have chances to reenter based on TSLA's price movement this year."
"I am also a tech guy, between battery day and the FSD beta, Tesla is going to have a massive market cap. Have you watched ""The limiting factor"" YT deep-dives on battery day and what it could mean for Tesla's bottom line? If you haven't you should."
"Perhaps not, but I wouldn't mind a recap of the implications. I'm even re-watching the old videos now."
"Yup, looks like he just opened up a live stream"
"Rob Mauer of Tesla Daily

He does VERY ACCURATE quarterly delivery and earnings estimate breakdowns before every earnings as well. He‚Äôs been almost spot on since the first time he started covering it. Really good analyst if you want to invest in the stock and want numbers to back up your thesis"
"Rob Maurer from Tesla Daily would be my guess.

Edit: Seems he did a live episode already about the inclusion 50 mins ago. Damn he's fast."
"Same! While I didn't go all in, the car showed the way. Starting buying 18 months ago. Now 16X profit the cost of my Model 3."
For me: buy.
Sounds like they've got some long-term capital gains.
"Hehe;) my projections for Tesla has been correct the last 5 years, so I would not for the life of me consider selling even a fraction yet. I am not selling a single stock for at least the next 2 years"
Shouldnt you sell after its officially included in the S&P when all the ETF's that follow it have to pick it up?
Why the h*** would you do that if I might ask?
the only way to make real money? so all the peons working jobs aren‚Äôt making real money?
How much money do you have in your bank account?
"Dude don't ever listen to anyone advising you to invest in 1 stock you have no control over if their only reasoning amounts to ""it worked out for me"" and ""TSLA to the moon."" This guy gambled and got lucky. He's also responding with a different account, whatever tf is up with that."
"Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket.

Honestly, an index fund is probably the safest way to go when looking out 30+ years. 

I‚Äôm investing in index funds and blue chip funds for my 401k.

On the side (Robinhood) I invest in specific stocks: Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, etc.

Check out /r/PersonalFinance. Max our employer 401k match, then do Roth IRA Max, and then focus on maxing 401k before investing in side stocks."
Not at all. I expect Tesla to become the worlds most valuable company by the end of this decade (and probably much earlier than that). They have SO much potential that has yet to be measured into the stock price. As I said: this exponential curve will continue in the next years to come as well

Maybe he bought a while ago at 460 or something and just held
i bought tesla at 462.
"S&P500 will only be about 1% TSLA. So if TSLA doubles in value after inclusion, S&P500 only goes up 1%. If TSLA were to go to zero after inclusion, S&P500 only goes down 1%."
it's not a car company

Means bitcoin üöÄ
This is the way
Do you think Tesla begged them to wait so they could pay out Elon when the stock was lower?
I cannot understand what demographic of people would sell Tesla at this point. It just doesn't make any logical sense to me. It's literally the worst time to sell.
How can I buy a fractional share of Tesla?
"Same, I was scared of a downturn after after the huge run up a few months ago but now I‚Äôm definitely buying all that I can(fractions). 

This is just the beginning, give it 5 years."
Gordon Johnson LOL
"I thought they were already dead. Wasn't it just two years ago that they laughed at the mere notion of TSLA ever reaching $420? Look at it now, it's been split in five since then and it's _still_ well over $420 now..."
"Its interesting. I mean, Tesla is already valued at a very high number considering the profits it makes.  But, if we believe (which I do) in 10-15 years those profits will be significantly higher than its all good.

Apple made $64 billion in profit in 2019.
Tesla will make $800m probably in 2020.

Tesla is worth 1/4 ($400B) of apple but makes about 1/64th of the profit.  This is why people say its ""over valued."" However, if Tesla is making $50 billion in profit in 10 years... well there you go."
"
>It would be lower than this. Probably more than 20%, but not quite up to 40%. 

Agreed."
"No, the S&P 400 mid-cap index is separate from the S&P 500 index - there's no overlap."
With the split I am now cost averaged at $7.22 per share
"WHOOOPS I missed it. I wanted to wait under 400 to buy into it heavy. 

Should have done a stop limit order :("
"Well, I‚Äôve been holding Tesla since it was $36, so I‚Äôm feeling kind of giddy right now."
well i think it will go way higher on market open. then down a little in the next 2 days then up more in 2 months as indexes buy in.
Just doing my duty!
You can‚Äôt ignore the data.
We're never gonna give this up.
Agreed. Watched the whole thing.
Then why is the stock down 7% from last night?
Had two 420 options expiring Friday that I just put a sell order on yesterday. Thankfully they didn‚Äôt execute!
Is it that dumb boat cruiseline thing?
Thanks man. We're all in this together
Hi. Bought two shares at $438. I feel your pain... and glory.
"Ouch! I got lucky on timing and was ready when it dropped to $400, down from $435 last week, so picked up a few then."
Who cares. This is a 10 year hold
"Lol I bought at $488, right after the split. Thankfully, only two shares, so it's not that bad."
my last purchase was at around $480... (though only fractional shares)
"Hold for the long haul. Looking to quadruple by 2030 if not 2025. All depends on when they 1. get true level 5 autonomy working, 2. solar roofs take off now that they're cost is competitive, and 3. batteries, batteries, batteries.

ARK Invest has the best research in the business on them. Look up Cathie Wood and Tasha Keeney."
Somebody bought at $500.
"$442 yea, then like 3 days later it tanked to $300 or whatever. FML.

Oh well, I remember when it was like $30/share ~7 years ago. I just graduated college and had zero dollars to invest. A bunch of my coworkers were heavily into trading and they were like, ""Yea OK dude"" and didn't buy in. Suckers :P"
"I bought 1000 shares at 318 (pre-split) :)  It has been one hell of a ride.

My 60-year-old neighbor bought a first edition black Roadster and was buying shares at $13 (or something nuts like that) - he's still holding. . . ."
"I‚Äôm talking post split so it was really $200 when I bought. But yeah, it‚Äôs the same return."
Correct
The K shaped recovery has people who can participate in the socialized market (and it has been socialized) on the up part of the k. The rest of the people struggling are on the down part of the K

"Haven't heard of it. 

I'm optimistic of new tech, expected VR to be mainstream by now in the late 90's, so not always right. Tesla tho, has some major quantifiable shit that money can't buy and most can't begin to understand.

They will be one of  the major car providers of the future . Their stock tho, is a pita to follow."
Link?
"Rob is a beast.

A very subdued beast."
Nice!!! No where near as much as you but I‚Äôm not going to complain
"There is a short term rise in stock during S&P entry, but it levels out after a couple weeks/months. There is no long term gain from entering S&P500 historically speaking, but maybe TSLA is different."
"I‚Äôm a huge Tesla fan and investor. You should do what‚Äôs right for you, but you might want to at least consider taking some gains off the table. If something surprising happens (war, bigger recession, radioactive moths that hate batteries, idk). It could be an opportunity to trade in at a dip in the future, or it could just be comforting knowing you‚Äôve made enough for your needs. Being committed through thick and thin is awesome, but so is de-risking and diversification.

Again, do what‚Äôs right for you, don‚Äôt follow a script, but at least think it over :)"
"No. The readily available INFORMATION about this necessity (ETFs have to pick it up) will be included in the price of the stock in hours. This is how stocks work, their _current_ price include all information which is known (or suspected) about the future."
It's my 401k and I can day trade without tax consequence. I typically sell my position on big pumps like this then buy back in when it takes a big enough dip
How many millionaires do you know that just worked a 9-5 job?
About $700.  And 15k in my portfolio.  65k in my 401k.
"Lol - i have two different accounts on my smartphone and computer. Anyway, a comment like yours can seriously piss me off. Its like saying to a professional sports athlete who just won gold - ""yeah, that's nice, but you just got lucky on that day"". Just because you yourself has not been good enough to predict Teslas growth does NOT mean that other people cannot. 

Investing in Tesla has worked for me not because i gambled, but because I have been studying the shit out of Tesla, their competitors, the technology, earlier similar disruption scenarios etc. And you yourself will benefit as an investor if you acknowledge that it is possible to become so good at predicting and projecting how likely a given company is to grow. If you think the stock market is pure gambling then stay far away from it - and do not talk other people down because of your own incompentence."
"Haha, that is the question!!! It will definitely shoot up fairly high over the next few weeks. Most people who follow Tesla are long term holders. I think a lot of hard core Tesla owners are betting on Tesla to continue to dominate and disrupt everything, not just cars but energy supply, insurance and transportation as a whole."
Yeah and the autonomy day. I‚Äôm a retail investor and I‚Äôm never organized so this is how I know
Bruh...
"So, for a month and change?"
Thanks for your response.
"Nah, that‚Äôs unlikely."
"Not selling myself however know someone that sold his shares bought years ago and paid off his house. Guaranteed return, I can understand it."
"In fairness, there have been plenty of businesses that looked like sure things only to implode. Selling some now to solidify some gains isn‚Äôt a horrendous idea depending on your actual current situation."
People that sell high I guess. Idiots!
"Well I‚Äôm roughly 10x at this point. Can‚Äôt say it hasn‚Äôt crossed my mind. But this is in my Roth, so I have no need for the money at the moment. Not gonna sell, but I‚Äôve considered it."
"A lot of people still do not see the potential. Too many have come to see the stock market as a glorified casino. To a certain extent, it is, but there are still companies who have value based on long term profitability, not quarterly returns.

Tesla is a good example, but it's long term expectations are outside of that which most have had experience of, or their ability to predict. Thus, they tend to view the ravings of the fans as just that, ravings. Battery day should have given them a clue, but the statements and predictions seemed outlandish, and they have had the example of others to cause them to doubt. One beginning with the letter N, for example. They should have looked at the track record of the guy making those statements. He's not perfect, and his timelines have optimistic in the past, but he has attained most of his outrageous ideas, and a couple of the biggest seem to be finally on the way."
"Buddy of mine did, twice. He would easily be 300%+ if he didn't the first time. He bought in again in September and sold again at the end of October i think and bought some Nio instead. I had to explain FOMO to him. Very proud of the 25% gain so far and claims he will be hodling ""for the long haul"". His history says otherwise..."
"I will be selling when it peaks and reverses. Buy back when it settles. It always swings, no need to ride back down."
"I will give you a demographic: any that needs the cash more than investment at a given day, be it for a medical emergency,  buying a house or a new car."
Should we buy?
"There‚Äôs STILL tons of people that think Tesla‚Äôs financials are fake and they‚Äôre going to crash because they can‚Äôt figure out how to build a cheaper car. 

I am not one of them but they‚Äôre out there."
"Your gains are only really in your hand when you sell. I've sold (and re-bought) a few times now. Yes, I would've had more if I kept it all, but I've paid off my car, lowered my mortgage and invested in my house. Quite useful, even if the stocks would crash completely."
"It always depends on one‚Äôs timeframe.  Definitely for folks that have no need for the money for many years, HODL is the best strategy."
At the top?
"I use IBKR, I had to enable it. Worth it because I can divert every spare $ into more TSLA."
That kook is one busted nut case.
More like Tesla is worth 1/5 of Apple but point still stands.
The thing with cars is that they aren‚Äôt as liquid as smartphones. But that could be offset by their margins
"Apple is a luxury goods company at this point and isn't going to be comparable to cars.  Apple has 2-3x the gross profit margin of auto makers.

It is crazy to somehow think tesla will have more sales than Toyota and vw combined in a decade, as well as being valued more than Toyota, vw, and ford currently.  Tesla has just barely had 1 million vehicles sold total and musk thinks they will make 20 million a year in 2030."
"What do you think of Tesla issuing new shares to absorb some of the $110B demand. It is extremely great for the company but means less profit for the shareholders. It's a once in a company lifetime event though, so I think they should do it. The money would cover their capex for the next few years."
"i see.  So is it sort of like the ""next 400"" sort of thing?  Though not quite since tesla wasn't in it?

I glanced at the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_400) for it and it still doesn't really make sense."
holy bejeezus how many of those you got?
I was almost ready to sell. Thank science I didn‚Äôt!
"I remember telling people last year that I should buy, at $200 pre split  :("
Congrats
"The stock is 7% up, aftermarket counts as daily movement in the chart. For further moves, we have to see the buy in from institutions that track the index (locking up float, decreasing supply). The buying of large holdings is the ‚Äúreal‚Äù part of this announcement

Edit: Ok just saw the original comment was specifically talking about TOMORROW (today) movements. That was not what I was replying to, apologies for the confusion"
Yep
Right there with ya at $434. Sad part is I wanted to wait one more day before buying a share at lunch today. Missed that one sadly.
"Oh, nice! My original plan was to purchase when it was $1400 (in current value idk, I think like 250-300?)  but the previously mentioned terrible luck slapped me like a bitch. When it got to ~445 I thought to myself ""Hey better late than never"" and then watched the stock drop by $50 so this is a wonderful moment"
"i did too but only for 2k. i should've put 10k but i wasn't paying attention. s&p said tesla needed more profitable quarters, they had a blowout recently and now they're on it. i should've seen it coming. i usually buy 10k of a stock that i plan on holding. i was getting sick of not getting the tesla action since it was always leading the market so when it went down to 400 i bought 2k. i'm going to put in 8k more on monday. it's probably gonna jump 20% on open. this might be the last chance ever to get in on tesla low since indexes are going to remove it from the float forever."
This is the answer. Keep buying and keep holding. See you on the other side of a decade.
"Finally a voice of reason, hah. Short term investing isn't investing, it's gambling. People think TSLA is high now? They're going to be shocked in the years to come."
"Yeah, Tesla won't be *as* profitable as it would be since the start of this year but it will certainly continue to dazzle for a long time."
"F, I don't even remember it going that high"
"Still won't get as great as the ~500% increase we've seen in 2020 alone, but yeah."
"*yikes* the all time peak was $498, this poor soul chose literally the worst possible day to buy."
"Heh, sucks for them. But hey you're finally positive on your investment so nice"
"Holy shit. For starters nice, that's a bold-as-hell investment. And also damnnn that's certainly paid off. Incredible, really. And props to your neighbor for investing in stuff like that lol"
This is something that should be fixed with a tax code and support system that keeps those in the top third supporting those in the bottom third. Without that you just get an extremely screwed up society (kind of like what the US already has). Along with decent wages for workers. Really hope this gets fixed in my lifetime.
Yeah I just saw a graph of someone losing 18 million!!! He said he was having 500k to 1M swings every week...
"I thought with Oculus and Valve behind VR it was really going to take off too.  It's getting going a bit, but it hasn't gone big like I thought it would."
He is [streaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bENy1YyJol8) right now.
Yea I meant short-term for all the hype.
"> This is how stocks work,

Not really, they work based on emotion.  The price of the stock within *hours* is the price of an emotional rush to buy in preparation of for expecting all those ETF's to start having to buy up shares as well in the future.  The proper price will settle in after the increased demand has settled out."
Smart move. I'm in a Roth so I can't do that.
"of course investing your money increases your wealth, but how many millionaires do you know that never worked a day in their life? Probably only those who inherited money.

It's also a little arrogant. You think a person struggling to get by can afford to invest? They can try, but our society is structured right now on a large underclass of people making minimum wage or close to it who will always be struggling"
"You aren't a professional sports athlete bro. My point remains true: he shouldn't take some random person's ""it worked for me!"" word for it, he should research companies before investing in them. I don't really care if telling a newbie investor this pisses you off.

I'm a Tesla investor like many others here but I'd never fuck with someone else's finances by hyping them up on FOMO. This isn't  _incompetence,_ it's decency. Go fuck yourself."
"you can study a company all you want but even the best prospects sometimes don‚Äôt pan out. Tesla could‚Äôve failed even with all their great tech, sometimes shit just doesn‚Äôt go the way you expect. In this case it‚Äôs been going well, but no company is immune to failure or overhyped expectations. So it‚Äôs better to be a little humble about your success"
"If that was such a certain thing then anyone with decent capital could get rich by buying a ton of TSLA tomorrow. 

Nothing is certain in the stock market."
"On a certain level I don't fault anyone for doing something like that. It's always a gamble, and overall that's great he was able to pay off his house. But today seems like Tesla is a much more sure investment for the long term. Also, from a purely financial perspective, I think Tesla's gains would crush any interest rates you'd pay on keeping a mortgage around for a while."
I sold about 20-25% of my shares a couple of years ago to help with the down payment of my house. I bought them back in March though ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I don‚Äôt see why someone would intentionally pay off their house. I get wanting to diversify but mortgages are such cheap sources of funds that can easily be put to work elsewhere.
I sold 50% of my shares 6 months ago and put it in NIO...the return has been spectacular...just because long term prospects for TESLA seem positive doesn't mean your cash can't work better over the short term somewhere else.
r/wallstreetbets is leaking
"I sold high, once. I bought at 170ish and sold at 333ish... made great profit! Then it spiked up by thousands, split, and it's still at 450 *after* the split."
"""high"" is relative. Are you talking about ""high"" compared to the past or the future? Selling high compared to the past is easy, but in many cases it is idiotic. Selling Tesla 6 months ago would also be selling high.

My point is that all signs show Tesla is going to dominate for a long time, and selling at this very moment seems to not be aware of that."
"Exactly this. People bash Elon for his timelines being off but he always gets it done in the end, Tesla has come a long way and I don‚Äôt see it failing. 

The fact that they‚Äôre on track for their first year of profit in the middle of a pandemic should be convincing enough."
"Define ""reverse"". Reversing is a trend, so after how long is a good time to say ""yep it is reversing now, and isn't just a short dip""?"
Is that an app?
"Whoops, I forgot Apple is 2 Trillion-- was thinking it was 1 trillion. Totally insane."
Do you still have a blackberry?
"Many investors see Tesla as not just a car company. I see Tesla as a future energy and ride hailing (transportation as a service) business. Some of the biggest businesses in the world are in the energy sector. If Tesla accomplishes FSD, the margins on transportation as a service are HUGE. 

If you are just comparing Tesla to other automakers tsla is going to look ridiculous. But if you add major energy player and ride hailing network... then today's prices may start looking....dare I say.... cheap :)"
"Goes like this:

- small cap: S&P 600, 600 companies
- mid cap: S&P 400, 400 companies
- large cap: S&P 500, 500 companies

In like 99% of the cases, smaller companies get on the 600 or 400 first, then eventually get upgraded to the top, the 500.

A company being added to the S&P 500 out of nowhere is rare. Of Tesla's size and its wildly varying valuations? Unprecedented."
"Not as much as I wish I had. I bought and held with some dividend money from other stocks


Enough to pay for a Model 3 LR but not quite enough to pay for the cyber truck tri motor"
"I was already waiting until after S&P500 inclusion to sell, I just wanted to solidify position. 

Probably still a good buy."
"I can probably even do you one better. The ~$900 I used to buy those shares were from an old 401k my wife had. Instead of dealing with the mess of rolling it over, I said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just cash it out. I can make up for the tax penalties and then some by buying some Tesla shares with it. Trust me.‚Äù

Woops..."
Bah! No regrets. Just enjoy the gains. You‚Äôll drive yourself crazy wishing you‚Äôd bought more.
in the black now.. :)
What kind? You can definitely do whatever you want in a Roth IRA or 401k without gains tax
"Never said anything like that, just said it's the only way to make real money. If you can't you can't, if you can, than do it. The market and compound interest are imo, the 2 things that create these disparate classes of wealth."
"""Go fuck yourself"" What the fuck? Bro, just because you yourself did not predict Teslas growth, you dont have to have so much anger. Another opportunity will come, and if you learn to invest as good as me some day you will make money on stock too - i promise my young stock-padawan:)

Anyway, he asked for my advice and i gave it to him - simply as that - it is up to him to follow it or not."
Yes very true. I forget I've been wearing my Tesla hype glasses again!
"Legit, but there are certainly people for whom paying off their mortgage gives the kind of peace of mind that outweighs the missed opportunity of getting richer in 20 years. Personal finance is personal."
"Ultimately, I've had to long-term forgive myself for selling things when I needed to sell, regardless of what I now know about the stock's subsequent performance.  That said, MSFT @ 32 and TSLA @ 265 will require repeated rounds of this process.  If you need to pull the money out, you need to pull the money out."
"That‚Äôs going to be one expensive house. But on some level, it depends on your age and your goals, so"
"You're talking about good debt, and some people don't want any debt good or bad."
"Counter argument, paying off the house gives him a 1000+ monthly payment they can make towards investing going forward.  I treat investing as a monthly fee, I add a few hundred to my portfolio every month and mix up my investments weekly.  I never consider profits, they don't exist as far as I'm concerned until year end when I make a pull.  I just consider a monthly fee I pay to learn a new hobby, and if in a year I make 10x profit or something nuts I pull for taxes or to buy Christmas gifts but otherwise just keep putting around for fun.  If one day I make enough money to get out of the game and live happily ever after I'll pull it all, slap it in some drip feed 99% safe investments and retire.  

That cash flow from a paid off property would make my hobby a lot cheaper overall budget wise!"
"Selling Tesla to pay of 3% debt is pretty stupid.

Selling Tesla to **buy** a *Tesla / House / Nice things* at least has immediate value now - and basically has a fixed cost of like $150,000 ($90k car, $30k down on house, $60k funny shit).

You always got to scrape off at least $100,000 at some point. You *almost never* need to realistically *ever, fucking ever* need to scrape off much more than that.

Unless you're doing some baller shit like developing a subdivision, underground fortresses, or running some crazy fucking world changing business."
"It's most people's largest debt/bill, would be nice to not have to worry about it outside of taxes/insurance, especially if a paid off house allowed one to retire early."
Totally agree 100% Taking profits and diversifying is the winning game
NIO?
"I will give you a counter example. I had been buying Tesla since early 2016. I sold a bunch when it hit 1800 (pre split). You bet I sold high. I made 10X. No I dont regret it and no it wasnt stupid or a bad decision. You are passionate, like me and believe in Tesla.. hell when I told my coworkers to buy Tesla at 174 saying its a 1000 buck stock, they made fun of me, but constantly saying it will go up no matter what, is a bit of a bad advise. All eggs in one basket and stuff.. you know. Once I made money in Tesla, I took profits and diversified. ENPH and MSFT have paid off really well for instance."
"Reversals happen on anytime frame, it depends on what you are trying to do. It‚Äôs gonna reach a point where the buying is exhausted and the sellers will take over and drive it down. This will happen until a price equilibrium is found. It‚Äôs not gonna keep going forever and it‚Äôs not gonna just go flat once it gets to the top. Last time it set a new high at 500, it plummeted to 308 within a week or two. I guarantee you there will be a point where people take profits. It‚Äôs just the nature of the market. Plus, Tesla is a crazy stock, it takes wild swings. Goes down just as fast as it goes up."
"It's Interactive Brokers, they have an app yes. It's the best broker in my case due to my geographical location but might not be the best choice for you. Ether way they have an app and have fractional shares üòâ"

Thanks
This was super helpful. Thank you!
How come Tesla wasn't added to the small and mid as it grew?
">cyber truck tri motor

still time to run up"
"***yiiiiiiikeeesss*** you're gonna have to wait a while longer to make up those taxes. ""Whoops"" indeed"
Truth. I‚Äôll probably buy more tomorrow when the market opens as it‚Äôll probably never go below this moving forward sans a great tragedy within the company.
Roth IRA through TD Ameritrade. I can only contribute 6K a year. Already maxed out for this year. :/
">just because you yourself did not predict Teslas growth

What part of ""I'm a Tesla investor"" don't you understand? I can't tell if you have shitty reading comprehension or if you're just a weird ass troll.

Your ""advice"" sucked. That's why I felt the need to interrupt your FOMO bullshit."
"I get what you're saying but your math doesn't take emotions into account. 

If you're in your 20s or 30s, the ability to not give a crap about your largest bill and just pay for your taxes and utilities is a big stress reliever and a privilege most people who are young don't have. You can build a lot of wealth by simply living a life without a mortgage or rent payment."
"This. My mortgage is really my only bill. It would be so nice to pay off and put that money else where, like more investments."
"Tell that to all the people that sold out of Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Google and Tesla years ago and would have been millionaires by now had they not diversified."
https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nio
Ev's side bitch basically. Tesla is king.
Bought v early and sold half when it mooned to $180. Sold another 25% recently. I do my best not to play the coulda woulda shoulda game and ultimately don't regret either choice‚Äîright move in both cases.
"Please, no one should be taking advice from anyone who is putting calls on their credit card, I don‚Äôt care how lucky you got... that is just stupid 

Just in case you have no idea why people are downvoting you this is why."
I have 200 shares. Im gonna sit on them for 10 years.
"This is a longer tale.

The shortest I can sum it up is still pretty long: for over 100 years accounting rules in the US and elsewhere treated employee stock options as 'paid-in capital'. They are basically a long term investment by workers, just like regular investment rounds are.

After 2000 a rule change to GAAP, trying to address abusive accounting practices during the dot-com bomb, made all of these employee stock options GAAP expenses. This artificially depresses the true income of tech companies. Tesla was hit particularly hard by this 'GAAP income distortion/artifact', because Elon issued generous stock options to everyone, to attract top talent. Since the IPO he diluted his Tesla stake from over 50% to around 20%, without ever selling a single share. (Creating a ton of shareholder value in the process, so shareholders didn't mind at all.)

But a big chunk of this dilution was also included as GAAP ""losses"" - but they are non-cash ""losses"", they are largely fictional expenses - like any equity round. The dilution effect of stock options is already discounted in the spot share price, there's no need to also burden the business expenses of the company with it.

I.e. Tesla, despite having a pretty profitable core auto business, technically only posted GAAP losses for almost a decade - combined with an aggressively debt-leveraged growth program of +40-50% per year. 

But S&P 600 small-cap inclusion requires GAAP profitability on a 12-month rolling basis, which Tesla never met until Q3 this year.

----

BTW., here's how Tesla's quarterly income looks like if you try to filter out the effects of non-cash expenses:

See the last column? In reality Tesla should have been added to the S&P 500 like two years ago.

Tesla's finances have become cash income porn last year, the tell-tale signs of a growing EV monopoly, and one of the main factors why TSLA went 10x over the last ~18 months.

Makes more sense this way?"
"Yeah, by the time Cybertruck is available our investor hero will be able to trade the shares in for the truck. It's probably not the best decision but s&p500 needs to fill their orders and not a lot of people will be selling.

I'm thinking about jumping in on after hours at $460 for a hundred and sell calls tomorrow morning when calls will be through the roof.

To anyone that can afford 100 shares, look into selling options against them. You may be able to pull off around $800/wk if you set your orders right. Sell calls when you have share and sell puts when you don't. With the crazy volatility of TSLA this appears to be a safe strategy."
*LEROYYYYYYY JENKINS!*

"Honestly he could just as easily be lying. It is very easy to lie on the internet. His account is only two months old and appears to live in Denmark. Also, most people that make lots of money in investing that I have met are more humble than he appears to be. Just does not add up. 

Edit: he just made a post bragging and then deleted it. Something is off about this. Also, appears he will be taxed at 42% if he ever does cash out, so keep that in mind."
"Well, i figured by your reaction you must only have at most a handful of Tesla stocks - that's so nice for a beginner investor:) When did you invest in them? Because by the way you speak about Tesla stocks it seems like you have just bought it because of some tip you dad gave you - which is also nice, dont get me wrong:)

What part of: ""I predicted Teslas growth and have been an investor since 2016"" did you not understand since you keep talking about FOMO. I have been riding the Tesla growth rocket since the beginning so dont you think i couldn't care less if other people invest or not.

btw isn't it fun to think about that my Teslas stocks has risen higher in just 11 months than what you will ever make on the stock market? Now that's some shower thoughts for ya!"
"Hindsight is 20/20. Tell that to all the people who did not bet on number 7 last night at a vegas roulette. Edit: if you dont get it, we are talking about investing strategies, not gambling get rich quick ones."
The TSLA price to earnings is no longer based in reality.
"Great, thanks"
Totally.. good moves.

"Look at Mr money man over here. Lol good for you.

You will be laughing in 10 years when those 200 shares let you buy a nice house."
Oh yes! Thank you.
"I am ashamed to say I have no idea what in hell that reference is about, though I hear it all the time"
That's what I tend to do. I can only do so much. Plus I gotta wait two days for the unsettled funds to clear.
Goddamn this is a lot of crazy in one reddit post
"But with Tesla now it is not hindsight.  It is run by a genius who puts those other brilliant men in the shade, receives the TOP engineering talent in the U.S. and is growing into far larger markets than they were. They‚Äôre disrupting 8 of the top 10 revenue generating companies in the world."
"Oh no.  You did not believe that is pertinent for high growth stocks did you?  Much less a 50% hyper growth company like Tesla.

Relevant stats are Operating Cash Flow growth and return on assets."
You are going on a highly irrational market.
Im hoping its gonna pay for my beach house to retire in... Or a big chunk of it!!
"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4

It basically means throwing caution to the wind in spite of otherwise careful and thoughtful planning. The video above that is its origins was evidently scripted. But it‚Äôs still hilarious. 

Anyway, cheers my friend. Enjoy your sweet gains!"
 I guess i was pretty spot on about when and how many stocks you had then hehe;)
"Tesla has no profit margins relative to other automakers (without government subsidy, which will not be around forever), they sell a fraction of the volume of other automakers, and even if they do grow to the size of a toyota, the average profit margin across the auto industry is like 6 percent. 

Tesla's current valuation makes literally zero sense. 

They're valued like one of these 'Money Printer' companies, Google, amazon, Facebook, etc. They have nothing to back up that ridiculous valuation besides hype. 

Where is FSD? Where is the roadster and the million robotaxis and the Semi? Where are the battery swap stations? They've been blowing an awful lot of vaporware in recent years. And I used to be a huge tesla fan. Shame."
"Ah, ok! Thanks lol"
Once again.  Current profits are a horrible metric for high growth companies.  Please do your homework!!!
How fast are they *really* growing though???
Faster than any large company ever.
lol take a break from the kool aid and have some water
"Haha.  An easily disprovable claim where all you had to do was provide a single counter example.
Why couldn‚Äôt you admit to being wrong rather than resorting to an insult?

My guess is that it stems from an inferiority complex."
Where is FSD and the million Robotaxis?
Did you not understand that we were talking about fastest growth of any large company?
Objectively no it is not
"Do you not understand that providing one single counter example would prove me wrong?

You‚Äôre doing the kid‚Äôs level argument of nuh uh."
"Well, this time I saw it before was sold out. Too bad that I live in Canada.

I really wish some tequila expert do some review on this one! I know that it is from Nosotros Tequila, but they don‚Äôt have any other a√±ejo product, so this might be something unique.

Edit: for clarification, the ‚Äúa√±ejo‚Äù is a type of tequila that is aged more than the others, and it is considered a superior type of tequila."
Tres Commas
I would like to thank Reddit for letting me know this was available. I was able to get two and might be down to ship to someone that is interested.
I wonder if we can expect a Re-Stock
"Thank god. I was super tempted to buy a bottle, and I don‚Äôt drink. Saved me 250 bucks, lol."
Tesla is quietly pivoting itself into a Spencer‚Äôs Gifts
Is it possible to ship alcohol within the states or from the states to Canada? I know it may be illegal but could it be done easily?
"Tesla tequila looks like something Larry David would go to extreme lengths to secure, just to spite someone. Then later he gets into an awkward incident with some lady where he tries to fix the problem and then gives her the bottle as an apology. Only to find that same bottle the next day sitting on the shelf of the very person he‚Äôd been trying to spite in the beginning.

"How could I miss this?

Super annoying I didn't know about this till it was. Gone
"Aww shit. I really wanted to order another one: one to drink, one to save.

I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm getting one... but now I don‚Äôt know whether to drink it or save it for awhile."
What‚Äôs this about?
Tesla Tequila sounds like the name of a soft-core porn star...
AND NOBODY TOLD ME??
Hope they don't cop out like the fallout 76 alcohol bottle

"I saw some other posts, thought it was a joke, and missed out üôÅ"
Im in SoCal and looking to purchase. Please DM me if you are interested in selling
"Yeah,  no thanks"
You retards buy anything
I missed it :(
I'm looking to buy and will pay above. DM me if you're interested to sell.
Thought about it but said nah. I'll get the leaf blower or freeze gun though
"Boring company and Tesla limited merch sell pretty fast, ez cash for papa Elon"
I can‚Äôt believe I missed out on this
I‚Äôm still waiting on my short shorts
"aw man, what a cool bottle. I want some now that I know that it's gone of course...."
I wish they actually would've shipped to the states they said they could. Couldn't buy it even though I live in one of the approved states. Super annoying
Is there a way to get updated when they add new items to the store like  this? I always miss things.
Fuck I was hoping power rangers came out with tequila
I look forward to a day of level 5 FSD road legal where I can sit in the back seat being chauffeured around by my Tesla while sipping on a glass of Tesla Tequila.
Sad I missed this.
Take notes Bethesda
I‚Äôve got an extra in Tampa I would sell to another Tesla fan if interested.
"Very ""macbook minimalistic"""
This was gonna be the centre piece of my bar üò™ too bad they don't ship to Canada yet

Omg Tesla HVAC will produce Tequila from air... that‚Äôs why it wasn‚Äôt ready for battery day...
"Lol is there anyway to get notified when Elon drops products, would have bought two but I was about 12 hours too late"
Better be really fucking good tequila for $250
Will they get any more of this or bye bye?
"You son of a bitch, im in."
Does anyone know if they‚Äôll be back in stock anytime soon?
Manage to get 2 üëåüöÄ
Does anyone when the next batch will go live? :(
And... it's gone.
This shape looks similar to Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator from the movie Idiocracy
There are better ways to waste your money. Damn.
"Should have been sold for $420, people would buy it regardless and one's gotta think about the memes."
"Sold out, you say?

Sweet!

Love my Tesla but I don't want Tesla tequila any more than I want proper 12 whiskey."
"I am interested in buying one, if anybody has an extra or is selling theirs let me know. I will pay more than purchase price."
Reposado maybe.
It‚Äôs stupid shit like this that is just such excellent business from every angle. Love it!
"Step 1. Buy all of them.

I didn't even know this was a thing!
It‚Äôs sold out basically immediately
If someone has another one of these bad boys up for sale please hit my DM üëâüëà
I cant believe I missed this. Anyone know if there will be more.
"help

i poured this in my gas tank and now my car is electric"
Just why though. Why
If anyone is willing to sell one let me know! I‚Äôd be willing to buy at a fairly large markup.
250 dollars?! Wow probably over priced as fuuuuuuck. Might as well sell tap water in s cool tesla bottle and it would sell out.

I got a bottle. Will bring to a Tesla meet up in the seattle area post covid.

You clowns will buy anything won‚Äôt you
Everyone in the comments gagging on elons cock
Elon could shit in a box and you guys would buy it.
Didn‚Äôt even know about it! I would have grabbed one for resale.
Im going to drink it while my autopilot is on... *edit* so many downvotes guess people can‚Äôt read sarcasim lol
Dumb
Should have been either $69 or $420. I'm disappointed Elon

Is this the schezuan sauce I've been hearing about?
"Well now I'm thinking I may be embarrassed to be a part of this club, y'all."
I think it's mostly for the super dope bottle. Just look at that!
"If it‚Äôs from Nosotros, it‚Äôs probably produced at this distillery: https://www.tequilamatchmaker.com/distilleries/186-destiladora-del-valle-de-tequila-s-a-de-c-v . Won‚Äôt be anything special, but I doubt you buy this to actually enjoy the tequila. For the Nosotros brand they cook the agave in stone/brick ovens and use a roller mill to extract the sugar before distilling in stainless steel tanks. Pretty normal process for anything above discount tequila."
"Same here, why does alcohol have to be this ‚Äúsacred‚Äù thing that can‚Äôt be shipped. It‚Äôs so annoying. Would have made a great gift."
Anejo is the best tequila. No burn. Just agave
"From the description, the tasting notes are very similar to Nosotros‚Äôs Represado...so chances are it‚Äôs just an barrel aged variant of that blend."
"I was also sad to read ""Only available in the US"""

"Stuff like these that Elon does for ""the memes"" is usually limited one time deal. I got not-a-flamethrower, Tesla short shorts, and now this Tequila.

Are you in the Bay Area by chance?
"I bought two to sell, dm me."
Also in East Bay Area have 2 extra PM if interested!
DM me will pay 420.69 for your profit and meme
I missed out on the not a flame-thrower and the surf board.  Planning on setting up a shelf in my office for the few I managed to get.
You can buy the regular 750ml bottle for $45 FYI
Not until next year
Are you looking to resell one?
Unless you‚Äôre reselling which seems like 90% of people who bought it are doing. Spending $250 to make $2500 isn‚Äôt hateful
Recuerdo!
Not likely. There are companies that are essentially predicated on running the back end of shipping alcohol to all states. They design their website to be seamless with the sellers website and you can‚Äôt tell but you‚Äôre actually buying it thru the back end company.
"It says right on there, fulfilled by Speakeasy Co"
It lasted for hours.

"Unless you live in Jalisco Mexico, you could not buy local made Tequilla."
They aren't making the product FYI
"I would love one for the brand, for the bottle and for the content as well! Even though it is USD 250 each, it is an unique product!"
I wish I could just buy the bottle since I can't get tequila delivered in my state. Too late now anyway. I missed the boat on flamethrowers and Boring Company hats too.
">Just look at that!

"Tequila is all about the bottle. Even some of the most well known name brand or celebrity brands, make you pay that fancy bottle tax.

Michael Jordan‚Äôs Cincoro is from the same producer as Total Wine‚Äôs El Padrino."
Sacred? That‚Äôs actually fascinating. What countries won‚Äôt ship due to sacredness? Some US states won‚Äôt ship (or even sell in some parts) due to the ‚Äúsin‚Äù thing.
Best liquor I've ever had was an extra extra anejo.  So smooth you could barely taste any alcohol.  Dangerous.

I was planning on saving one and the other possibly selling
Also in East Bay Area have 2 extra PM if interested!
I really doubt we will see it go for $2500. This isn't a flamethrower. Now that is cool.
I‚Äôm super bummed. I wish I had known!

*not* a flamethrower
Is the tequila a limited time product?
Dm me if you want to buy my bottle stand and box.
"Sacred or sin is just marketing to sell you the real reason, tax stamp. If it's being shipped states can't assure they get theirs."
Shipping companies don‚Äôt want another Ark of the Covenant situation on their hands. Think of the insurance they had to pay out when they lost that thing. If only the church had a tracking number!
People that hate tequila drink the cheap shit. Have a good day my fellow anejo lover.
What's ROI?
If people contacted you already and you‚Äôre only giving one away why are you asking for more DMs?
DM me! But it doesn‚Äôt ship for a few weeks I think
Don‚Äôt you need a liquor license for that?
"It would probably be more about the bottle since the tequila maker is an established company.

This is more a ‚Äúnot a flamethrower‚Äù situation than a new merch product line, I would guess. In other words, it is marketing (generated a lot of headlines and chatter) that actually makes a small profit. 

Genius, really. Tesla marketing can make products (short shorts and Tequila) that does additional marketing and probably makes enough profit to pay for the marketing team."
"Most tequila makers always have batches aging so this isn‚Äôt hard, they would just pick some decent barrels to age an extra four months.
It‚Äôs the hand blown glass bottles that would take a long time to restock."
"Eden Prairie store located near Minneapolis, MN"
I know! All these limited items end up selling for much more than the original price. Plus this would have made an awesome piece for the man cave! But I know I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to resell it and buying another share will end up paying much more in the long term!
I think any limited Tesla item should be treated like $300 stock pre-split...
this. People are already bidding above $800. Spending 250 to make 2500 isn‚Äôt a bad day
Does eBay allow alcohol?
where is the link to that?
They're all listed as EMPTY.  I wonder if that's something they just have to say?
"Right? This is just basic profiting of limited releases. You don't have to be a Tesla die-hard to know that this is gonna 2-3-4-5x in value each few months. The Tesla Surfboard was $1,500 at release - now it's selling for $10,000 unopened on eBay. This is just having the same foresight as a ticket scalper, you don't have to be the smartest man in the room to know the value of getting a limited release item."
Also in Bay Area and got an order in. Willing to part with it for the right price in case you need a back up.
"This is the first time I‚Äôve seen a Redditor comment ‚Äúare you in [location]?‚Äù  & they actually WERE in that location.

Bravo"
"They both are, but im going to wait to judge sale price. Ive got your reply saved and will reach out to you, but it may be a few months, so please shop with others as well!"
No idea
I‚Äôm not in Cali but can pay for shipping if interested :)
Yeah my might‚Äôve exaggerated a bit lol
Just FYI I was just kidding about S&P500. The history behind this is the joke with shorts and the tweet about [Tesla going bankwupt and Elon being surrounded by Teslaquilla bottles.](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/980566116614291456?s=21). Someone then asked him to make it and he said yes.
"Oh well, maple whisky it is!"
"I'll trade for a Tesla Tequila lol. Anyways, you could cash out on eBay!"
I‚Äôll happily take that deal!
I'll buy it if you're still interested in selling it! I'm sure you have a lot of offers. And mine probably isn't that special but here's my hat in the ring.
"To legally be called ""tequila"", in the US at least, it only has to have 51% agave derived distillate. The rest can be whatever cheap rot-gut Jose Cuervo decides to cut it with. ""100% Agave"" doesn't guarantee excellent tequila, but if you don't see that on the bottle, it's practically guaranteed to be the gut wrenching swill you remember from your college days, for which you had to lick salt and suck lime, in order to keep yourself from projectile vomiting, the moment it passed your lips."
"It is pretty cheap lol

Everyone deserves an opportunity. Just because people have already contacted me doesn‚Äôt mean they will actually purchase the extra bottle.
Maybe I'll sell on the dark web for eth. Lol
Yeah it's like that supreme brand but this is actually tangible..
"Could've flipped it and the used that money to buy 2 shares... Was my thought as soon as this dropped, regret not ordering any now"
No but people sell bottles with unidentified liquid inside that should be handled with caution.
All the listings I see say ‚Äúempty bottle and stand only‚Äù
"Lololol. I didn't realise the s&p 500 thing was a joke. There I go making my own rabbit holes again. The tweets are really damn funny, almost enough to make me use the app again. This mf is too funny"
Knob creek maple whiskey is so good. Liquid pancake.
I‚Äôm looking for a not-a-flame thrower as well.  I did get the tequila on order
"I switched to the good stuff after my first negative experience with Jose Cuervo.

I admittedly still like the lime and salt ritual. Better than just pounding the shot and sitting around."
So is Jose Cuervo not good? Cause that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using for my margaritas. Jose Cuervo makes the worst margarita mix. It‚Äôs expensive and they use high fructose corn syrup for the sweetener. Now I use a mix that‚Äôs half the price and all natural.
"1) lime
2) tequila
3) savor 
4) salt to accentuate flavor"
"nope, radio on internet"

Bad bot. No biscuit.
"You dropped the leading m. God loves you, if you want help."
"I think this is everyone's attempted loophole to get around eBays rules.  Many of them also say ""NEW"" which I assume implies they will be sealed new bottles"
I mean who knows. I made it up but could have some validly (but doubtful). He did just tweet [420 is ten times better than 42](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1324595039742222337?s=21) as a reference to Nio‚Äôs stock being 42 and Tesla - 420.
"On the other hand, you should check out Woodinville Whiskey's barrel-aged maple syrup. It's ruined me on any other pancake topping for the rest of my days, and it's alcohol-free so you can order it online from anywhere!"
"Cuervo does make some pure agave bottles, but their empire is built on the rail stuff you get when you order a margarita at TGI Fridays. Their (definitely not 100% agave) ""Especial"" is , unfortunately, *the* most popular (by sales volume) tequila. Due to its ubiquity, it is usually the first tequila most people ever try, and is what drinkers who ""don't like tequila"" think tequila is.

Stop buying margarita mix. A proper margarita is not hard to make, and you can't replicate fresh lime juice with anything that comes out of a bottle.

* 1.5 oz fresh squeezed lime juice
* 1 oz Cointreau or the orange liqueur of your choice, but never Triple Sec (i.e. shitty low proof alcohol mixed with orange flavoring and sugar water)
* 2 oz tequila

Shake if you have a shaker. It helps. Use more Cointreau or add a splash of agave nectar, if you like yours sweeter."
Try some silver Don Julio and you're welcome.  Cheap and good.
It‚Äôs just cheap. It‚Äôs ok in mixed drinks in most cases. Straight it‚Äôs tough.
"> accentuate flavor

That's a strange way of saying counter the gag reflex. Good tequila tastes *good* on it's own. The salt and lime routine was invented, not to accentuate, but to mask the flavor and make undrinkable swill barely tolerable."
"Thanks, but I only believe in the matrix."
Good luck finding a TGI Fridays margarita after this year.  Every one I saw in the NYC metro area is boarded up.
What about Mezcal? I have never tried. I‚Äôm intrigued because apparently it‚Äôs similar to tequila but has smoky taste which I like.
"Perhaps I wasn't clear, but I mentioned TGIF purely as a cautionary tale. Rot gut tequila and sour mix does not a margarita make."
"Mezcal is not my jam. I'm sure there are some good ones, but anything with a worm in it is a gimmick and probably awful to drink.

As for tequila, out of the well known and easy to find brands, I like Sauza Hornitos for a budget bottle and Herradura or Don Julio if I feel like splurging. Spending any more on a bottle of tequila has drastically diminishing returns. And, for margaritas, anything more expensive than Hornitos is a waste. Though, I wouldn't go cheaper, either.

Patron is to tequila what Grey Goose is to vodka. Mehh product and great marketing. Not worth the money."
I‚Äôm aware. I was just being cheeky!  I agreed with everything you were saying!  I love good tequila too.
"Haha, yeah. They're not a wildly successful franchise, nor is Cuervo the best selling tequila in the world due to an overabundance of consumer good taste out there. You simply never know about people. Anyways, I did not mean to condescend. Please, accept my apologies."
"No offense taken!  But that you!  I was just clarifying my response. TGIs was just on my mind lately because I passed a few boarded up ones the other day. I had to look and see if they were fully out of business but apparently not. Just lots of closures. Was never a big fan. Just depressing seeing so many businesses going under, even if they weren‚Äôt my thing. 

Since you seem to know your shit regarding tequila, give me some recommendations!  I love Clase Azul, if that gives you an ideal of the types I enjoy.  But I haven‚Äôt really experimented much. I‚Äôm typically a bourbon / scotch drinker and only recently dipped my beak into the world of tequilas. Largely avoiding them since college and the bad experiences with cheap tequila."
"I'm not much of a connoisseur, really. Just can't stomach cheap booze, or corn syrup mixers.

I find the $30-$40 price point to be the best bang-for-your-buck sweet spot for most types of booze. Sauza Hornitos is a perfect budget bottle for mixed drinks. I like Herradura for shots or on the rocks. Patron is overpriced (paying mostly for their advertising)."
"Cool!  I hope you start seeing more soon, and ideally get to drive one soon!"
"With the registration fees, etc., that‚Äôs prob ~$200k car in Singapore

Btw, I‚Äôm jealous ... beautiful country"
"This anecdote may be lost on OP, but I remember feeling the exact same way in the 80s whenever I saw a DeLorean. I only ever saw 3 live in my lifetime. 

Of course, I still geek out a bit when I see another tesla live in my town. (I live in the rural Midwest and there are only a handful of owners in my whole county.) I was riding my bike on a back country road and a white Model S I'd never seen around town before drove past me. I was so excited I tried to think of some wave or hand signal to let him know I was also a Tesla owner (which, is kind of dumb but hopefully the community here understands the feeling)."
"That‚Äôs awesome OP! There are zero Tesla‚Äôs where I live and I remember seeing a Model S back in 2016 and pointing and freaking out haha. 

I purchased my Model 3 last year without ever seeing one in real life, being in one, driving one, etc. That Model S was the only Tesla I ever saw in real life before I got my Model 3. I‚Äôm also about 30 hours from the nearest service center so I took a pretty big risk of getting one here. I have the only Level 2 or better charger within about 17 hours. I feel as if I‚Äôm setting the path for the next group of people. I love it when people point at freak out when they see my driving. It happens often as I have the only one for about 1,000 kilometers, I remember the feeling of being there freaking out a couple of years ago. A lot of kids wave and even a 60 odd-year-old couple followed me to my house to ask about it haha. 

Have this gold award for giving me the good Tesla feels again!"
"> happiest day of my life

I really hope that's an overstatement"
">Tesla fan since 11

Well now I feel old..."
"Although i sympatize with your excitement think good to clarify situation with Tesla here and cars in Singapore in general:

- The Teslas here now are gray imported from Hong Kong or UK. They are sold by small parallel importers at high prices(200-220kSGD). Shipped out for service(usually Hong Kong) roundtrip for 10k.

- Tesla is actively recruiting since July(sales, service etc) and will launch here immently. Been a long wait. 

- Lot of changes in Gov position on EV this year with 2040 ICE-free target and many chargers plus rebates. 

- All cars sold in SG have a tax of 100%@0-20k, 140%@20-50k,180%@50k+ (amount customs value in SGD).

- In addition to the sales tax you need a 10 year license. This license is from a qouta which is auctioned. Cureently SG has car population growth at 0% so this determines the supply. Currently the license cost in last bidding was about 40k. 

- Both the tax and the license has a papervalue that depreciates over the 10 years. You get back 50% of the tax on scrapand license depreciates linearly over the 10 years to 0. This fact makes it very confusing compare car prices with any other market.

- Price for Model 3 SR+ is therefore expected to be about 150-160kSGD. Possibly a further 20k rebate that should be announced soon. There is already a 20k rebate from next year. It will be very competitie to eg a Mercedes C-class or BMW 3-series here(very common cars here).

- One issue is high roadtax using an old way of calculating based on power output. There will also be a extra tax for petrol tax shortfall. 

- Most people live in highrise apartments but multistory carparks should be able to fit overnight charging infrastructure overtime.

- Huyundai just broke ground on EV factory here so in 2-3years there will be local made EVs"
"Imagine, the ""happiest day of your LIFE"" is a car passing by.."
"Model 3!! That‚Äôs pretty cool.

I have seen Model S before but never a Model 3. In fact, Tesla has sold 14 cars in SG so far."
"I just saw the same looking Tesla while waiting for a bus with my girlfriend. 30 seconds earlier I thought to myself ""how cool would it be to see a Tesla right now"". It's the little things like this that make my day"
I remember still seeing the first one in my town. I was so excited to take a selfie with it and send it to all my friends. It blew my mind that day.  Now my Tesla stock blew up and I'm driving one.
"Having been in Singapore for most of my life, i‚Äôve only seen a few electric cars here and there. Most of which were smart cars parked around the city; there aren‚Äôt many privately owned ones.  

From what I‚Äôve heard, they‚Äôre just too expensive. EVs on their own cost more than normal cars and on top of that, in SG, you pay extra for a certificate of entitlement (COE) which needs to be renewed every 10 years (every 5 after that first 10). In some cases the COE can cost as much as the car itself, effectively doubling its price! In the case of EVs, it only gets worse. If I‚Äôm not wrong (fellow redditors in SG please correct me), EV owners still have to cough up for carbon tax on their vehicles. 

At the time of writing this, the most common EV in Singapore is a Hyundai Kona-E, followed by the Hyundai Ioniq-E. They‚Äôre the most available, in a sense. Then there‚Äôs a few other cars scattered in the EV list like Nissan Leafs, Kia ENeros etc etc. 

Over the few years that I‚Äôve been here. I‚Äôve seen 4 Teslas. 2 of which were showroom cars. There is 1 Tesla Model S P80D that‚Äôs been here for a while, 1 Model X (showroom), 1 Model S P100D (showroom) and the Model 3 that you can see here. 

There aren‚Äôt many, but there sure are more coming about."
Funny...I‚Äôm in the Bay Area and don‚Äôt go a day without spotting at least one in my area
cars in singapore are damn expensive
"The happiest day of your life? Really?

And why can't people just import them?"
"ok I really like my model 3, but if seeing a model 3 is the happiest day in your life..........."
"Here you go, in all its majesty"
I remember my first time...
"If you make it to Chicago you can drive mine, but I'd stay put for a while if you were you."
"This was me when I saw my first Tesla in Florida back in 2014, when I'd only read about them on the internet / in my Environmental Science class. I still get excited when I see one  on the road."
"As SG is only 50km/31miles long and 27km/17miles wide with 5.6million inhabitants, it's not really a surprise that they tax the arse off cars...."
I still remember the first Tesla I saw in person. Black Model S making a left turn while I was stopped at a red light back in 2014. Landmark moment in my life.
Did you know your phone can be turned sideways? Life hack.
Anyone who is a car fan shouldn't live in Singapore. Even Malaysia is an upgrade when it comes to the ability to buy a car.
no offense but if this if that was the happiest day of your life you need to get out more
"I‚Äôm surprised teslas haven‚Äôt made more of an impact. Whilst the govt of Singapore does not want cars in general, it strikes me as the kind of place that could easily go 100% electric within 5 years if it wanted - a small geographical region, high wealth, and a committed, forward thinking government. They should be the poster for the world in terms of % of electrified cars and charging point access."
the size of Singapore won't allow/discourage private car ownership thus huge price but EVs are good for the tiny country-all these gasoline/diesel vehicles are polluting the tiny nation. Carbon emission is a big price to pay for survival.
The happiest day of your life ???
Kinda sad...
I wonder how much a Tesla would cost there.
"There was a story a few years back about someone that imported a Tesla to Singapore. (pre Model 3 days)  Since it didn't have a tailpipe to rate the level of emissions, they charged him the highest amount. I think it eventually got sorted. Then last year when I was in Singapore on a business trip trying to get over jet lag, I spotted a Model S drive past me.  It didn't dawn on me that it could have been the same guy on reddit posting. It was long gone before I could get my phone out to grab a picture."
are you like 15 now? lmao
I still remember the first time that I saw a roadster in person.
I‚Äôve loved Tesla‚Äôs for a few years but it‚Äôs only really been this year I‚Äôve stated seeing them now they are everywhere in my village theres at least 8 different ones I‚Äôve seen
"Love Singapore, been there several times since 1998 I think for work. Nice to see them appearing there."
Wow amazing!!! Here in Seattle Washington they are EVERYWHERE and I mean everywhere! It's so cool to see electric cars coming out more and more everyday! Have a good day man
"Living in south texas it was very rare to see one initially, I'd always get super excited and annoy my wife ""look there's one over there!"" And take pictures and was a big deal for me, now I drive one and it's still awesome to look at!"
I have also seen a tesla in real life for the first time in Oman! Have been hunting for one forever.
"I could happily sell my Tesla and live in Singapore instead, love that city/country/island"
A couple of years ago I saw a tesla every month or so in my city. Now I see around 5 teslas every time I leave my house. It's a matter of time for Singapore.
"I had the good fortune to travel to Singapore twice in 2018 and I stayed off Orchard Rd.  Wow, that place is dripping with money.  There are more high end luxury stores in that area than I've ever seen in my life.  I'm talking standalone Rolex, Breitling, Cartier, Prada, etc.  Just incredible wealth.  The store in my hotel (plain old Hilton, nothing fancy) had a $230,000 watch in the display like it was nothing.  I remember looking forward to a walk up and down the street because I was for sure going to see some exotics.  I saw countless Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, Bentley, etc.  It's a wild place."
I remember seeing the first Tesla roadster (based on Lotus Elise) in Singapore many years ago. Not sure many people bought one.
"Reading this makes me feel so blessed that I can drive a model3 every day. Friend, if you‚Äôre ever in the Netherlands, do send me a DM and I will gladly take you on a tour and have you drive (as long as you have an actual drivers license.) :) I hope you eventually own one yourself, they‚Äôre magic to drive!"
Surprise! It's just like an accord!
"Singapore being a developed country and they don't have tesla's, even in my country, colombia, they have a third-party dealer that sells them"
"That... feels very strange. Living in the country that has the most Tesla's per capita, I can barely go down a street without seeing one."
Visit England! You will see one every 10 mins :)
"That surprises me, I thought Singapore  would be the perfect market for Teslas.  You would sure love Vancouver they're everywhere."
i hope you get one at some point. best car i‚Äôve owned by a huge margin.
You could test drive one you know!
"If they are in China, they will be in Singapore soon!"
I hope you get to own one today OP!
I think they just opened a gigafactory in Shanghai this year. They may be ahead of schedule and delivering before the year was out
"OP - if you‚Äôve not already, check out the EV Association of Singapore and the Singapore EV Enthusiasts Facebook group. Outside of Covid we‚Äôve held meet ups and people have brought their Tesla‚Äôs along. Hopefully we will try and arrange something in Phase 3 if we can."
"You should buy a share of TSLA stock. If you can't afford one, ask for one for your birthday. :-)"
Good news: a Tesla store is probably opening in SG next year.
Not exactly the happiest day in my life but seeing a Tesla for the first time had me jumping!
"I've been a Tesla fan for a long time. Moved to Thailand before they came out. Didn't get to see one until I took a trip to Hong Kong. By the way, had a great time in Singapore. I would think Singapore would be the ideal place for clean electric cars."
"I live in SE Ohio and see tesla's every day when I am on the roads and I still point, say the model, and smile. My partner and oldest kid are annoyed but my 2 yo loves it!"
I've been to Singapore. What an amazing city/country.
"Random, but I thought Singapore was a city. Lol oops. üò≥"
How much is that Tesla in SG??
So awesome!!
This makes me wanna buy you one lol.
It's just a car dude
"I'm very lucky that Tesla started in my town and I saw the lotus body ones on my main street! 

It was so cool! It's so exciting! 

They are slowly going all over the world. You will see more! 

I'm glad this mad your day!"
"Alone the fact, that people are freaking out when they see a Tesla, is enough to notice how public and important they are. Keep them counting, there will be more soon :)... Greetings from A Tesla Owner in üá¶üáπ"
"Corner of Beach and Ophir?
Big mural behind you?
I have stayed close by twice on holiday, Singapore is a nice place."
My family is from SG! I‚Äôve been there often and miss the food all the time üò≠
Take a holiday in Norway and you will relive the joy 200 times a day.
Awesome! I hope for more to cross  your path and I hope you get to drive one someday!
Looks exactly like mine. It‚Äôs a beast.
"I was exactly the same, now they are showing up everywhere. My neighbors have 3 on order! It is the future."
He‚Äôs happy seeing one. Imagine when he own one üòÜ
I like that yellow SUV in the background.  Yellow is my favorite color.
Come fly to Hong Kong. They are EVERYWHERE!
"Wait till you drive one... Truly epic!!
Drove P100D once... Happiest day of my life"
Tesla costs million$ in Singapore
Nice ! üá∏üá¨
Cool! I've seen 2 so far in SG and another one on test drive here. Always very cool to see it around.
"Wow. I had always admired Singapore for so long. This post intrigued me so I googled it. Apparently [Singapore minister dismisses Elon Musk and Tesla, states hydrogen is ‚Äòcleaner‚Äô option](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-tesla-dismissed-singapore-minister-hydrogen/). I am so shocked I can hardly believe it."
"I‚Äôve been to Singapore a few times and always asked why there were no Tesla‚Äôs. The answers I got were that while there is very small little crime in Singapore there is corruption in the government as they have a one party system. Lots of the powerful people made their money in oil and don‚Äôt want the status quo to change. Even the government makes a lot of money selling gas, it‚Äôs $8 a gallon after all the taxes and the fact that many people live in large apartment complexes that would be difficult to rewire with chargers."
Wanna see a Tesla ?
Blame your government for making cars so expensive. No way Tesla can profit with so few options for consumers.
"It's incredibly pricey there. The cheapest Tesla u can get in Singapore is like 220k in usd i think.
Which is the SR+ M3."
"Unlikely. A corolla cost 100, 000 usd there"
"Singapore is very expensive to own and drive a car , and they have the most restriction on cars , like no more than 10 years ols"
Never thought I'd see Tesla drivers down south and I'd have to go back up north to new England to see a bunch but down here in north Carolina I've already seen at least 4 this year. Nice to know there are at least a few Tesla drivers down here
Real beautiful. I actually think there are no tesla dealers in Sg. But i saw a dealer that imports them from China.
For what reason?  Pushing local car manufacturers?  Don't want cars on the road for normal people?
Thats funny because back in Feb I'd see a delorian drive past me three days a week.
"TBF, I‚Äôd also totally freak if I saw a Delorean casually driving around these days."
"I was pretty excited when I got to see one ""flying"" a couple years ago

https://imgur.com/a/5MiTaCI"
I've seen two in Arizona in the last year. It's awesome when your 13 year old kids jumps out of your wife's Tesla to go get a pick of the Delorean. I know one time the owner saw him and smiled ...
"Thank you for paving the way to the future!

 I'm sure you make many people's day everyday when they see your Tesla, it really makes my day when I see you since they are also rare around here."
There are like six of them in my apartment building alone lol.
Thanks! I know thats a real good feeling. I saw a ferrari and a vanquish today. I did not care about them. The model 3 had me jumping!!
So what do you do if it breaks down or has problems being 30 hours from the nearest service area?  I‚Äôm curious about this as I‚Äôll be 3 hours from one and I‚Äôm nervous!
Sounds far away!
"There are tons of Teslas here in central TX, and people (usually young kids) still freak out when they see me, especially depending on which neighborhood I‚Äôm driving through. I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like to have the only one of something in such a wide radius!"
Just them have their moment lol
"Reminds me of my GF's daughter, who's 11, and every other day is either the best or worst day of her life."
"Well, for now, its just a moment of joy that i was so happy i had to say that."
":D

:/

:("
"lmao from the title I though they got a Tesla but no, they just saw one on the street"
TLDR: Don't live in Singapore if you like cars. Even if you're rich there are so many annoying restrictions.
"LOL in Vancouver I will often see an X, S, 3 all at one intersection. This guy would break down in tears."
14! Wow. My most favorite is a Model X. I want to see one in SG
"I'm in Chicago and other than my own, I can't drive around ever without seeing 5-6."
We are spoiled brats. Tesla drivers are like Prius drivers. They seem to suck at driving even with self driving car.
Insanely expensive taxes + you need some sort of special car license to drive there
"> The happiest day of your life? Really?

Come on, dude. It's probably a kid."
"Similar to Australia, cars are incredibly difficult to import, in Australia, you have to get approvals, then get it shipped, pay for the storage time while they decide when to inspect it, then pay GST, then LCT which is about 33% of the cost of the car after $70k, plus shipping costs, plus storage costs, plus GST, plus, conversion costs to RHD and ADR compliance,

And if your paper work expires before they finish everything, it‚Äôs your problem and you either get your car destroyed (at your expense), shipped back (at your expense), or re approved (where you would have to pay for the storage fees again, and can take anywhere from weeks to months, all at your expense)

This is supposed to protect our local car market, which is now 100% imports after Holden was killed off.

I‚Äôd assume Singapore has an equally stupid system but with a far higher price."
Cars are exp af and for the rich in Singapore.
I was too excited to even turn it sideways. I just forgot..
Yes the taxes are too much!
"With approx 80% of the population living in apartments with no fixed parking lots (and no ownership of parking lots either), the logistics of widespread EV adoption is much more difficult than for other countries. Singapore believes that to reduce pollution, widespread adoption of end-to-end public transport is instead the way forward.

It also doesn‚Äôt help that with limited solar, and non-existent wind, hydro, and nuclear, most of the energy used to charge EVs in Singapore comes from fossil fuels anyway."
"They should be converting buses, cop cars, mail trucks, ambulances, etc to full electric and just ban ICE sales from there on.

It's not the place to own a personal car, regardless of its propulsion. The high wealth means nothing when cars have extreme excise taxes and there are further regulations on the number of cars that can be sold per year."
Singapore had kinda a falling out with Elon Musk when they try to tax his EV more than ICE vehicles here. Since then the Govt newspaper has been throwing shade at Tesla every now & then.
"Singapore is too small for effective wind or solar.  All of their electricity comes from fossil fuels as it stands.  Sun Cable will hopefully change that, but it's years away from coming online and will only provide 20%."
200k minimum
It was this one: [https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/08/tesla-model-s-owner-protests-singapores-carbon-emissions-surcharge.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/08/tesla-model-s-owner-protests-singapores-carbon-emissions-surcharge.html)
Selling one Tesla isn‚Äôt gonna be enough for Singapore lol
"Cars are taxed to the moon and back to discourage ownership so it makes sense that a disproportionate number of cars there are high-end. 

The majority of people in that island don't own a car at all."
It's the perfect market for going car-free lol. Cars are taxed to the moon and back to discourage ownership and reduce congestion.
Nah i am just 15 and i prob cant afford one
"Its a city, but also a country"
"20% excise tax \*ontop\* of the purchase price plus a goods and service tax of \~7%. Singapore has some of the best transit in the world and is too small to have a lot of cars, so they artificially limit it via extra fees, taxes, inspections etc.  


Glad you got to see your first Tesla GP!"
Ye the big mural.
Happy blue cheese day!
I understand what you mean about the food.
I am 14 and i aspire to start a car company (which is probably too hard to acheive). I want to save up for a model 3 in the future as its cheaper. But in SG its 200K. Thanks for the hope! :)
Cant wait tooo!!! I have never been to Hong Kong. My mom went there as a business trip to celebrate the anniversarry of her company. She bought me so many items. But i wonder if she had seen the teslas in hing kong.
250k
"Yup, basically when the administration here can‚Äôt figure out how to tax something/handle the 21st century, they will exert their arcane voodoo & claim it‚Äôs either horrible, or make it some expensive/difficult to obtain until one gives up."
"They don't really have a choice.

They have to limit the number of cars to prevent the traffic system from collapsing. Singapore ist just one big city with no more space to grow. Building more roads to accommodate the increased traffic isn't an option because the space just isn't there."
It's a tiny island with a large population; they probably don't want anymore cars so they set the tax accordingly.
"If they allowed free-market car ownership people would literally end up walking on car rooftops.

And then ambulances, mail trucks, etc are 100% paralyzed."
"That has very little to do Tesla though. The cheapest car you can get will still cost you over $100k. Cars in Singapore are a luxury, and they are priced as such."
I would just go for the s63 coupe or roadster at that point...
You can actually own old cars but you just have to pay a hefty fee every 10 years. People rich enough to own cars in Singapore generally will just change every few years.
Saw this post a while back: https://old.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i0d0e6/tesla_is_definitely_coming_to_singapore_now/
"If you can make it to Boston, message me and I'll give you a ride (and let you drive if you're licensed and grown)"
"I don't think tesla has any dealers anywhere, do they?"
They have good public transportation for the whole island and limit cars
"Remember that Singapore is a tiny piece of land. The whole country is tinier than London in fact. When cars are accesible to the whole population, your infrastructure must have the capacity to handle all that traffic. Singapore can‚Äôt afford to give land to bigger roads and such, so having a car is expensive to control the number of them."
Imagine a whole country that's like Manhattan - only clean and modern. You wouldn't need a car.
The number of licenses available is limited and (I believe) they cost money ... and then registration fees in Singapore are like $80k ++ import fees
"The country does not have enough space to encourage car ownership, and public transport is very good. So they make car ownership is crazy expensive, and motorists get automatically charged for every mile they drive, on every road. There is also no free parking whatsoever, not even in shopping centres. I don‚Äôt know what the percentage of car ownership is in Singapore but I‚Äôd hazard a guess that only the wealthiest 10% of the population can afford any kind of car at all. Whereas in USA, 80% of the population own a car, due to huge country, and low taxes."
It‚Äôs a tiny island with amazing public transportation..
"They don‚Äôt want cars on the road, smart"
"I‚Äôd love to see (and buy) a Delorean styled and sized Tesla, manufactured using some of technologies as in the upcoming Cybertrack (like flat unpainted panels made of high strength stainless steel)."
Just saw one drive down our street this past weekend.
I'm going to guess SatinGreyTesla lives in Eastern Europe or somewhere similar and you live in California ... what do I get if I win?
Mobile service has been to me twice. If something major fails it‚Äôs on a tow truck for a long trip haha. Hopefully that doesn‚Äôt happen.
"you should see the bay area, every second car you see is a tesla"
You mean he'll cry because of how often he'll see S3X right? No offense to OP btw ;)
"Looks like they sold one in July.

"Same in Malaysia. Owning any car but a locally built Proton indicates very wealthy person, due to Govt tax and red tape, to encourage people to buy the locally assembled cars"
"There's a lot of rich people there though iirc, right?"
"Just teasing ... glad you were so excited. Last year my wife and I managed to pick up a used model S and I'm still excited every day when I see it in the garage. In the US there, so the burden was just can you afford it, not like where you are which is can you even get one, then are you a millionaire!"
Could they not put solar on all rooftops?
"yes, this one."
Ah ok that makes sense
Never underestimate yourself. Yes you can afford one .
"I‚Äôve saw somewhere that cars in SG is really expensive but I could never figure it out if it was more or less expensive than cars in Thailand where I lived
Here model 3 costed around 130000$ (US dollars). Would you say it‚Äôs cheaper to buy one there?"
"Keep working towards your dreams, nothing worthwhile is easy to achieve."
You can do it! Keep going. Nothing worth it is ever easy!
"Hopefully along the way you will learn how inconsequential this was for you and that millions of other things can and should bring you more joy. Friends, family, helping others, art, music, food, etc."
"Maybe come to america when you are old enough, and rent one while doing car research! 

They do tours of the factory here as well.

Get good grades, get in a good college, and keep learning. And work at a company that helps you move up. :)"
Aspire to emigrate to a car-friendly nation. Then you can buy any car that's less than your income!
Yep. Incredible import tax on cars there. I visited on business and one of the girls in the office's parents paid like $60 grand US for a C Class for her. Loved that little city Island.
"An entry level Toyota Corolla is around $104k SGD, or ~$75k USD.

And then the certificate of entitlement, which gives you permission to own and drive a car on the roads is $30-35k SGD, which is good for 10 years."
"You need to pay $100,000 before you can even buy a car, that‚Äôs just for the license first, people aren‚Äôt supposed to drive in Singapore"
Why are the government taxing cars to the extent of making them a luxury item? Are they aiming to make people more reliant on public transport?
"Their equivalent are Service Centers, which are essentially dealerships (they tend to not have any inventory of vehicles, except show models)."
Depends if you're going to lean on the literal definition of dealer or be reasonable.
"Well Satin lives in Northern Europe, right next to the country with the highest Tesla density in the world."
Do you schedule mobile service through the app?  How long did it take them to get to you?  Appreciate the response.
Love me some intersectional S3X.
"Yes, i want to migrate to the US or Canada! New Zealand aint that bad too!"
"They could, but the footprint needed to power a multi-story air conditioned building with solar is generally much larger than the footprint of the building itself.  Sun Cable is going to cover 150 square kilometers in the desert where the sun is more consistent than it is in Singapore, and it will only be able to offset 20% of Singapore's current consumption.  Extrapolating that, you'd need over 750 square kilometers of solar panels to power Singapore entirely on solar.  This is actually a bit more than Singapore's total land area, meaning that your solar farm would have to cover the forests, buildings, roads, parking lots...  every square millimeter of the country to be enough.

That doesn't mean they shouldn't put solar panels on the roofs, but you couldn't manage more than a few % from it.  To make Singapore carbon neutral will require either nuclear reactors or more megaprojects like sun cable."
"you cant quite do that, you need to buy a certficiate to purchase a car or smth too in singapore. i think buying a car is roughly 200-300% the price you pay in other countries."
">...one of the girls in the office's parents...

Wow really butchered that possessive eh?"
"That's crazy since the cost of living is under us. When I went last year, everything was relatively cheap for me."
"Crazy, but you don't really need a car in Singapore"
"And then you get charged per kilometre every time you drive it, and no free parking anywhere, whatsoever, except in your own home. And few houses with a garage, island is too small, most people live in apartments. With no parking space."
They don‚Äôt want a lot of cars on the road since it‚Äôs a small island and public transport can do most
"because they made their public transport so good for you to go literally EVERYWHERE within singapore with minimal cost and time. If you are traveller, just use google maps then select public transport and it'll tell you which bus/subway line to go and interchange."
"> Are they aiming to make people more reliant on public transport?

Exactly this. They have one of the best (if not *the* best) public transit systems in the world. They don't want people using cars, but they also provide real options, instead of just saying ""deal with it"".

They are a tiny island country, and instead of just perpetual gridlock like Toronto or NYC, they took steps to prevent traffic (there's still a lot of traffic, but it flows well), and provide for those who can't get a car. North America is highly dependent on personal vehicles for transport, Europe less so, but you absolutely do not need to own a car in Singapore, nor do most people even want to own a car."
"If everyone in Singapore was allowed to buy as many cars as they want, traffic would be so bad that people would start walking to work on car rooftops.

And then emergency services, mail trucks, etc cannot operate."
He shoots and bounces it off the backboard ... I was just trying to think of where Tesla's might be really rare but within 30 hours of service. And where they are really common (California).
"Yeah, I mostly just talk with the tech via text and he comes to my house when‚Äôs he‚Äôs here every few months. He won‚Äôt just come here for a small issue but will if it‚Äôs urgent. Then I took via the app for logistics. When he comes here I usually have a few issues at once."
"Ah, so I understand your pain. Hahahaha"
still got the point across.
*sits back and admires handiwork whilst idly polishing knee high black boots*
"They try to limit car traffic as much as possible in Singapore.

Singapore has no space to grow (the entire country is just one big city on an island) so space for bigger roads really isn't available. If they didn't limit the number of cars on the road the traffic system would just collapse."
"That's on purpose. The things you need are cheap, the things you don't need are expensive."
"Try buying fresh produce, cheese or booze."
Good to know thanks!  You can text him directly from the app?
i live in aus i just remember it from a youtube video. you can register the car in malaysia but singapore charges high fees for every day the car is in singapore
Is the mass transit pretty good then I hope?
The government decided for you.
"No, I have his cell number. We talk on the phone and via email as well. Usually I‚Äôm trying to fix the issues myself and asking him for advice. It helps Tesla and him from having to come here more often. They‚Äôre willing to work with me given the situation."
Singapore has fantastic public transport.  It's a mix of bus rapid transport and metro lines (underground and above ground).   Almost all buses and trains are air conditioned. And they work on unified contactless fares.  The vehicles are also almost always clean.
">her

its so good at real time you will know when next bus/train will arrive. Plus every building in Singapore has its own zip(postal) code. So point to point google map search will give you precise direction/timings via public transport. Plus Singapore is so good at planning that their 2030 roadmap has anyone living in singapore under 10 minutes walk to a train(MRT) station. There is little reason to own a car beyond a status symbol. Even cabs are not expensive when you need to use them(like after a big shopping)."
"I've been there. It's the best in the world, tied with Tokyo and Seoul, IMO.

When you look at how densely populated the place is, it's actually a hindrance to drive a car, due to limited parking and traffic jams (while there are relatively few cars registered in Singapore, a lot of cars drive in from Malaysia every day). At rush hour, taking the train can be 2-3x as fast as driving."
"Same everywhere, just what they choose differs"
Very cool.
[deleted]
Very nice. Singapore is definitely on my travel-bucket list
What are you smoking? They dont cane people for littering

"How much did you pay for this in total? I‚Äôm curious about the import duties since this is a ModelX, it was shipped from Fremont, USA. 

How is the charging experience at home? Is it 240V?"
And OP is one of the reasons why Tesla doesn‚Äôt need to run any ads :)
Are they  officially sold there or You import it yourself?
"How high are the salaries in Kenya - and how many people can realistically afford a $50K car? Also, I'd assume that the infrastructure for EV is still not great..."
hi can we get test rides.
That easter egg is so buggy now. Doors are like 15 second out of sync w/the music lol.
Why are we all shitting on this guy for wanting to spend money on something he wants? Let him live his damn life!!
"when your economy is bottom 1/4th of global rank in gdp per capita, the most important thing to do is urge compatriots to buy teslas"
Is there infrastructure even in place to support this? Where's the nearest charging station?
Sup fellow Xiaomi user. I was so confused by the notification sounds lmao
Sawa
Is a Tesla affordable in Kenya?
Nepal has also got it's first one. Hope I can buy one in the near future.
"Yes, and I will try here in the UK convince my fellow cit to buy a superyacht"
Nice. I find those doors so cool. I always wonder about parking and opening the doors with cars on the side and how I would stress üò¨üòÖ lol. I'm sure it's made to open tightly or something...
Lol that license plate looks like ass
I don't think it's convincing you need to accomplish but rather the fact your fellow citizens can afford a Tesla.
"What‚Äôs charging infrastructure like out there? Also out of curiosity as I don‚Äôt know much about Kenya or the big industries there, but I was curious as to what you do for a living?"
Anyone notice the plate should be installed higher up?
Woah didn't know. üòØ Thanks for the info. Even better üòÑ
Grats
my friggin ears
That‚Äôs a knockoff. It‚Äôs a Tesya.
Where was the car imported from?
How do u get both falcon doors to open simultaneously?
Does the gps and all the features work correctly ?
you should try to encourage the child slaves mining cobolt for your tesla in your very own country to buy tesla.
nothing more ironic than a rapper wearing blood diomands mined by slaves. Maybe a Nigerian driving a tesla with cobalt mined by Child slaves in Nigeria.
"How much would it have been priced in Kenya? I‚Äôm surprised they would be sold there, considering the social issues there."
I‚Äôm so glad to hear these are gaining popularity in Africa üëç
"This will sound rude, but I didn‚Äôt realize more than a few people could afford a Tesla in Kenya. Is there even a service center?"
Am I the only one who thinks this is in poor taste given how many people in extreme poverty there are in Kenya?
What kind of a retard mounts their plate like that??
[deleted]
"I‚Äôm jealous, even though I have a high paying developer job I could not afford one. I settled with a used Renault Zoe instead."
Is it safe in Kenya? I thought there were gangs that will follow you and car Jack you etc. Just wondering if the guy is packing while driving the Tesla lol
Oh its just a short 5000km ride to Israel
And people complain about Tesla service in the USA.  This is a brave man especially if he buy a Model X.
"The reason anyone in Kenya would like to buy a Tesla is because of the incredible technology in them, the green nature of the vehicles and they simply adore Elon Musk. There are no service centres and no superchargers. I also want to buy one, badly"
"It won‚Äôt matter, this baby will get stolen waaay before service check up."
It's not mine & am yet to meet the owner. I wanted to be the 1st kenya to import a Tesla. This guy beat me. We have 240v mains
"The import duties are as below:
25% import duty; 10% excise duty; 14% vat; 2% railway development levy & 3.5% import declaration fee. That's pretty hefty"
We have to import
Salaries are not very high. But there are plenty of wealthy businessmen. EV infrastructure is non existent. So people will have to have charging stations at home & only use the cars for city driving
"I‚Äôm not from Kenya but from Zimbabwe. Most sub Saharan countries have inordinate amounts of poverty but also have a minority of extreme wealth(which is kinda sad) but if you drove around elite neighborhoods in Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa you‚Äôd be shocked at the standard of living."
just need solar and not many places to go lol
"That‚Äôs a Model X. So > $50,000."
"This is not mine. But when mine comes, I'll give as many test rides as possible"
"There are wealthy people in every country in the world. Nairobi, Kenya looks like [this](https://a.travel-assets.com/findyours-php/viewfinder/images/res70/38000/38950-Nairobi.jpg). Kenya also gets 70% of its energy from renewable sources. Not everywhere outside of Europe and North America is poor. Kenya actually has a lower Gini coefficient (measure of wealth inequality) than the United States."
"Kenya overall is poor, but Nairobi has a booming economy."
"When you‚Äôre in a country with a stronger economy, the most important thing to do is judge the aspirations of poorer people."
You think he‚Äôs driving into a slum and telling them to buy Teslas? There‚Äôs wealthy people in every country.
Why would they build chargers where nobody has a Tesla? Now that people have Teslas they can start building chargers
Nope.
Didn‚Äôt they get three model X‚Äôs? I also saw someone post a picture of their Audi e-tron on Instagram recently.
Congratulations. Go get one
They have sensors to adjust to the room you have on the sides and top when you open them.
I own a company
They're opening simultaneously coz the car is in celebration mode
"Here's another bullshit comment using FUD, I was wondering what the hell was going on this topic."
This was imported. They aren't sold locally
"Closest one is in Jordan, 5000km away. That around 100 hours of driving according to google maps"
"It's not about affording it, every country in the world will have people able to afford Teslas.  
It's that they're very particular cars, and not having a service center or authorized body shops makes it so risky that I would never get one or recommend getting one until that changes.  
Of course, if he has fuck you money and can just ship it 5000km and drive his lambo in the meantime, then sure, go ahead...

But definitely not something for somebody who has to save to get it."
"Daniel Toroitich Moi is worth $3bn, so he can afford a whole bunch.

Countries near the equator are quite aware of the risks of climate change and hence being renewable is very positive."
"Do you really think everyone in Kenya (or Africa for that matter) is poor, living in squalor? 

By the way, there are plenty of places here in the US that could give some poor places in Africa a run for their money."
Doesn't mean someone can't have nice things there. There is poverty in literally every country in the world.

You're not."
do you know how broke america is? haha don‚Äôt fall for the facade
"How about you stop buying all luxury items and give all your excess money away to those in need? Or, are nice things only for privilege people born in privilege countries??? We all live in a world with extreme poverty but here you are judging someone who if they bought the car legally with legally earned money did nothing wrong. You are no better than any other man."
Yes
I think UAE might be closer.
There‚Äôs a Tesla is Israel?
Tesla service and sale centers in the middle east are in Jordan and the UAE only.
It‚Äôs clearly a status symbol right? I mean it is in the USA too but not as severe.

There are a several Nissan leafs in kenya which are cheaper. But why buy a Nissan leaf when there's a Tesla to be had? Money just needs to be found
"Sounds like a recipe for disaster tbh.

Those people that adore Musk should do a bit of research."
what country is this imported from?
"‚ÄúNot very high‚Äù is probably the biggest euphemism I‚Äôve heard. 1700 USD per capita back in 2018. That‚Äôs like 30 years of average salary for a higher end Model 3, never mind a Model X. Buying a Model X is akin to buying a Bugatti Veyron in the US.

I applaud you saving money for a goal, but I sincerely do hope you are one of the wealthy businessmen that wouldn‚Äôt be hit too harshly financially if you can‚Äôt use the car for extended periods of time when service is needed. 

I‚Äôm sorry, just don‚Äôt see how saving money to buy a car with its nearest service center being thousands of kilometers can be rationalized otherwise.

Even changing tires was a hurdle in the US tire shops in the beginning because EV cars are so damn heavy."
maybe you could get the more well off folks to pool their money and invest in a few unofficial charging stations! wouldn't be supercharger but could still make a difference.
"I badly want to buy a Tesla myself, just saving up some money"
The Porsche taycan is available for sale in South Africa. The e-tron and ipace as well. Tesla might one day be available but since Musk hates South Africa I doubt it
"What does Gini coefficient have to do with it? That speaks against your argument even: if the Gini coefficient was high, some large minority of a poor GDP/capita country might be able to afford Teslas."
"> Not everywhere outside of Europe and North America is poor. Kenya actually has a lower Gini coefficient (measure of wealth inequality) than the United States.

If each person in the United States has 1 billion USD, and each person in Kenya has just 50 US cents... both would have the same Gini coefficient."

"Running your energy grid off renewable resources is not a flex. Germany runs their country off solar and wind and all it‚Äôs done is make their electricity cost 3 to 4 times higher than neighboring France. If Africa‚Äôs impoverished can‚Äôt afford electricity now, renewables don‚Äôt help it."
"Sorry, but rich people in africa is synonym of corruption and exploitation. Source: half my family lived in angola and Mozambique until 1974. One of my cousin opened a factory in angola 10 years ago but got fed up with corruption."
I mean cool aspiration to want a luxury product ? Wanting a big car isn't that original. If his aspiration would be locally building affordable electric vehicles or coming up with an innovative grid solution that would be something else.

"The Model X certainly has some status in the USA.   I guess in Kenya you could just park it out in front of your house if it breaks down and as long as the doors are stuck in the open position and you keep it washed, people would think you are very rich.

He said the car isn‚Äôt his
"> Even changing tires was a hurdle in the US tire shops in the beginning because EV cars are so damn heavy.

Aren't heavy cars what you people in the US do, and always have done? 

EV's aren't that heavy either, not like the bullet proof stuff that presidents are driven around in weighing 6-7 tonnes. A Model S is ""only"" 2.1 tonnes 2WD (or 2.3 tonnes 4WD). Similar to a BMW X6. 

If EV's could not change tires in the US, wouldn't there be an huge number of vehicles unable to change tires there?"
"Kenya as a whole has a very low gdp, but in Nairobi there are much higher wages, I‚Äôve known non-executive employees making $2,000/month, while basic jobs might be more like $300/month there.

Still not Model X money even in the big city, but that $1,700 per capita is the result of a large rural agricultural population."

Nissan leafs in Kenya are primarily used by a ride hailing company called Nopia Ride. They use all electric vehicles. They've installed some fast chargers & i presume they have also partnered with Nissan for the service & repairs

"‚Äú6th wealthiest country in Africa‚Äù unfortunately doesn‚Äôt mean much at all.

Economy of France (or South Korea+Taiwan+Singapore) is larger than the entire economy of Africa, not to mention the greater wealth disparity within and amongst nations and overall higher poverty rate."
"It may not be just the weight, I think maybe it's also the OEM tires that are unique for Model 3, which I believe are double layered? But it was such that Costco for example wouldn't replace tires for the few months when Model 3's were rolling out. I do not believe the issue is widespread anymore as Model 3's are pretty common sight (at least in metropolitan areas)."

Had mine over 4 months and the only ‚Äúproblem‚Äù was a very minor door rattle. I could have easily fixed it but had mobile service do it just because I had the option. Knock on wood but so far so good.
"No, I guess I supposed a local technician could perform majority of simple repairs with remote assistance."
Thanks - I knew you were out there
Who does it better then?
Yeah that‚Äôs the whole country though. Only 27% of people live in major cities in Kenya and I don‚Äôt think that many of those 27% are below the poverty line they‚Äôre all out in villages where they probably don‚Äôt even have cars. Same thing can be said about the U.S to an extent. 33 million people in the U.S are below the line. But if you look at the cities where people are most likely to buy a Car or Tesla then you can see the similarities. You don‚Äôt see people in central United States driving Tesla‚Äôs to their farms either.
Yeah. These countries need to stop leaching off Africa and allow fair trade. They are getting resources for dirt cheap.
"The model 3 is roughly the same weight as a BMW 3 series, maybe 100-200 pounds heavier at most.  

The tires are regular tires but are foam lined on the inside to reduce noise.  They can be replaced with any tire that meets the loading requirement, the foam lining only has a very minor impact on cabin noise."
"Ok, yes they certainly have more torque than the average ICE vehicle; perhaps that makes it difficult to use normal tires."
"I think I remember ""liability"" being one of the reasons shops didn't accept teslas. They were new, techs didn't know anything about them (how to drive them, properly lift, etc) and in general their insurance policy was probably not going to be happy (or potentially not cover) if they fucked up on one.

It's different now, places like Discount Tire/American Tire now even have their own jack pucks and I don't need to let them borrow mine anymore."
Bit of anxious with the election to be honest
"So, second hand accounts from before you were born in a few of the over 50 countries in Africa. Got it."
"I made a snarky reply to a snarky comment, which is pretty on par for Reddit, I'd say. You've come along, totally missed the point, and responded in a very off-topic way.

You're right, it's clear I had set that bar a little too high."
"Goodluck! If you do decide to buy, ask for Laura at the Tesla showroom on Sheikh Zayed and PM me."
Most mechanics don't work on teslas. You might find someone who could do brakes or suspension work. But if you need warranty work done you will have to go to tesla. Do you live somewhere with a tesla ranger mechanic?
">  Same thing can be said about the U.S to an extent

As much as I like to shit on the US as the next redditor it is not comparable. In the US 5% life in extreme poverty, in Kenya it is 15%."
I hear ya!
Better than your wikipedia background.
"What do you mean PM you? Do you work there? Or you have connections?

By the way, I'm trying to figure out how to actually book the test drive. The booking page on the website appears to be broken, but I gave them a call and apparently you can just book it like that?"
Yeah of course I didn‚Äôt mean it like that I meant when you compare Rural U.S to city U.S of course there‚Äôs a difference not rural U.S to rural Kenya
Well yeah! Obviously! So I beseech you oh wise one - with your superior knowledge of all things African. What is the ratio of honest to corrupt people in Africa and how does that compare to places like say the US?

Surely someone must have said it... Tes-quila !!
"Beautiful bottle.  Mediocre tequila.  


It is a contract distillate.  Tesla basically bought already made tequila from a distiller that makes tequila for over 130 brands."
I'll fucking buy ut just for le bottle ‚ö°
"‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt Tesla address reported issues with their workplace culture?‚Äù

Very cool bottle.  However even when carefully handled this looks precarious.

Do you know what company made this glass bottle?
Oh for fucks sake.
Think they will restock this or are we SOL?

will they make more for future purchases since its sold out or this initial run was it?
Should have put a period instead of a comma after 'artisans'.

Anyone have an idea of the dimensions of the bottle on the stand?
How‚Äôs the fit and finish?
Anyone know if they‚Äôll restock? I don‚Äôt drink but kinda wanted that bottle lol

"i hate it when they say that artisan crap. the whole point of something being hand made is that they can do an even better job than a machine. otherwise who cares? it's like two humans and one does a worse job. would you buy the worse one? so the one where humans do it but is worse than a machine has no value. make no mistake though, people who make it by hand are supposed to be masters who make it much better than machines due to the amount of detail. they can do a perfect job too."

"You ever see the truck Jerome Guillen designed before he worked as chief engineer at Tesla? Panel gaps you can literally stick fingers through. And then the panels fall off at 3-4 years old and you have to glue them back on because they were only held on by clips. Jerome had no real world experience, he got his doctorate and went directly into upper management without actually ever designing any cars in real life or working on them. 

When Sandy Munro tore down the first Tesla cars and found problems with the frames and castings, thats because Jerome had no experience with stamping or casting metals. The truck he designed was fiberglass. He was basically fumbling his way through the design because he didn't know. And it all had to be redesigned once real auto engineers found the problems.  

With all the massive mistakes hes made it is astonishing that he became the President of Tesla. 

When Elon says he had to do everything because he cant delegate to his workers, the reason is because Jerome has no clue what he's doing. 

Wait, what am I doing in Wendy's?"
Probable cap gap
I thought it said the $250 was to reserve the bottle but they weren‚Äôt going to be produced/shipped until late 2021? Did I read that wrong?
Whoever showed that dude how to take a picture should be slapped.
I thought it looks like the Lightning Mcqueen  bolt from Cars.
"On certain planets, carrying this bottle means you are DTF."
I think that's the joke
Wondering the same!
"Same..

glad to know Im not the only one. I reached out to them yesterday feeling like they forgot about me"
Tesla sold short shorts four years ago. Kinda like running shorts.
"Yes.

Sold out immediately. Apparently Tesla needs to raise prices on their promotional items."
But then it will ruin my collection!
Same my shorts just shipped yesterday!

"You realize Jerome wasn't in charge of the Model 3 ramp, right?  It was some dude who got fired and replaced by Elon himself, who somehow went on to get rehired by Apple to head their car.  Jerome got the job by literally building superior cars in a tent on a fucking sloped conveyor belt because it was too weak to actually move the load with its own strength.

You talk shit on Jerome, but imagine how fucking awful the other guy must have been."
"On one hand, trucks are built different to cars. On the other hand, I drove one of those trucks and it was pretty shit."
"I don‚Äôt think Munro tore down a Model S, which is what Guillen was in charge of at first in Tesla (if you can find a link showing otherwise, please provide it; I couldn‚Äôt find one).  Munro‚Äôs first Tesla teardown was Model 3, which Guillen wasn‚Äôt in charge of until Assembly 4.  I think the 3 that Munro tore down would have been produced earlier than that. 

[Guillen‚Äôs wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Guillen#Tesla) for reference.

Also, generally we know Musk doesn‚Äôt suffer fools, and Assembly 4 was Guillen‚Äôs 5th position in his 8th year at the company."
Sandy Munro is the guy who told us to design everything as 'snap-fits' back in the '90s. Lol
How did he get the job? Friends?
Are you confused between Jerome and Franz? Jerome is not a designer.
"You have no clue what you are talking about. 

Jerome is one of the most talented and elite engineers in the world. His decision making skills and leadership has steered and accelerated the world towards sustainable energy.

They were actually available for at least a few hours.

Ain‚Äôt trying to do that to ya! üòÇ
"The tequila was made by NOM 1438 -- Destiladora del Valle de Tequila -- who makes around 130 brands or so.

It is a contract distillate.  That is, Tesla contacted Cofradia and bought a batch of already made tequila and had it bottled in that rather fantastic looking bottle.

The bottle is amazing.  The tequila is meh.

I'll eventually get a bottle, mix the tequila in cocktails that cover the taste, then put good tequila in it. :)

"https://shop.nosotrostequila.com/nosotros-reposado-tequila.html

Tesla site said it was made by Nosotros. Now it is aged longer so imo its should be a bit better, but its basically the tequila I linked.

Just want to clarify i think there is nothing wrong with that. Frankly it's what I expected them to do (have an actual tequila distiller produce it). Even at $250 i still bought it. The bottle is badass and i really look at it as more a work of art and collectors item than an actual tequila."
"From what I can decipher through the crap resolution on my phone, it's 80 proof.

For anyone not aware, ""proof"" is just an old school unit of measurement for ABV.  When it originated centuries ago in England, it used to actually differ from a straightforward ABV measurement.  It was originally based on alcohol flammability and eventually evolved to be determined based on specific gravity.  The UK and EU have since done away with proof as an official form of measurement and just use ABV. 

The adopted US measurement of proof dumbed it down and it is simply 100 proof = 50% ABV.  So if you have the ABV, just double that number for the proof!"
"Very true.
Don't get me wrong i see nothing wrong with it even at $250. This is Tesla not a distillery. I bought it and very much look forward to it."
"Both of you guys, wow. No other product in the world has such deeply knowledgable owners and investors."
"Ya, Jerome was President and was in charge of design as well as hiring the guy who failed. He‚Äôs directly responsible for lack of leadership. 

And go watch Sandy Munro‚Äôs videos on the original Tesla cars. They had all sorts of design defects until Sandy pointed them out and Elon fixed them."
"That is the understatement of the century. It‚Äôs had dozens of recalls involving just about every system in the truck.

Also, I will have the chili."
"> [Guillen‚Äôs wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Guillen#Tesla) for reference.

Think that Wikipedia article [was mostly written by some random person](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jerome_Guillen&offset=20180918000000|860101488&action=history) on the internet‚Ä¶"

"You had us in the first half, I'm not gonna lie.

"Last week I got an email stating they would start shipping this week. I never received an email after that and been waiting impatiently. I started seeing earlier this week that people were getting them so I kept logging on to my Tesla account on their website and checking emails.. nothing.

But they should be shipped soon Im guessing. Its only been a week but feels like a month. I cant believe people are actually wearing them lol. I am going to frame them and hang up in my office! Then Im going to do the same probably with one of my future Tequila's

I was lucky enough to be living in a state that was able to receive them and ordered 3 bottles (had to get my mama to order one cuz it was 2 max per customer)"
"Because Elon made a joke about it in 2018. 

Why a hat, with a top prize being a second hat?

Why not-a-flamethrower?

It's fun. It generates buzz and is effectively marketing which pays for itself."
"They're not making tequila, they contracted a reputable mid-range tequila distiller to cook them up a batch and put it in novelty bottles. Which is fine, Tesla *shouldn't* be making tequila. They'd likely waste a lot of time and money and do a bad job. Leave it to the experts."
"To humanity...!
Cheers"
"Um, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs what elon did because he never tweeted about it. A tesla insider found out about it and posted about it 3 days before the release date.I first found out about this from tesla Facebook groups and this subreddit"

No one is buying this because it will be the best Tequila it will be good but like you said it's mostly the novelty, bottle and honestly the quirkiness that it was even made is what does it for me. Parents are huge fans and  got them one as well for x-mas.

Funny thing is they showed me a day later after it was sold out and were super bummed they missed it. I played it cool so should be an awesome gift!"

I think the tequila will be a bit better than expected and honestly musk threw out the idea in 2018 so wouldn't be surprised if this is a unique batch. I'm pumped for it!

Very smooth and would be an excellent gift! Lots of people would be very happy to receive them."
Oh thank you for that link! Very helpful. My original comment may have been a bit too simplistic.
This van is owned by a Tesla technician for sure. When M3 came out we had so many cars get delivered with the wrong wheels that pretty much all of us ended up taking a set or two home!

you got my hopes up. I thought Tesla was coming out with a minivan!
Nice how much are they? For the 4
Pretty sick. Ive also seen them on a subaru

"So there‚Äôs this show on Netflix called Overdrive or something, and it‚Äôs basically like American Ninja Warrior or whatever but with people and their crazy Need for Speed cars. I had the idea while watching it of making an absurdly powerful all electric monster vehicle, out of my ‚Äò05 Dodge Grand Caravan and trying to get on that show. It would be the best amount of absurd, and I think it would definitely be wildcard enough to get on (with enough LEDs and a wild paint job to match, of course.) This only makes me want to make this essentially impossible dream happen all over again."
If the wheel fits...
This one has the super draco for acceleration. Check that rear pipe!
"I aint even mad, im just impressed lol"
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery I guess
I‚Äôm bringing S3XY back
What I can't figure out is they sell aerodynamic wheels but every Tesla seems to come with massive wheels instead of 16-18s. I think the smallest you can get is 18s
"Haha, I wish they would make a van"
I would totally buy a tesla van.  I have kids and they are young.
Finally a Tesla Toyota partnership lol xD
I wish I could fit these on my MY.

Seriously, I've never had a better vehicle that could do more or move more stuff, including Suburbans.  Mine is still going strong at 220K miles. I'd buy an EV version in a second."
Was thinking the same
I only like them on a grey M3
"They should fit lots of Japanese and Korean 5 stud cars, some fords too.

Centre bore would be the biggest issue but small spacers can alleviate that.

Probably more aggressive width and offset than most things they would fit on to, but not enough to make them not fit."
A tesla van would be pretty sweet.
"Getting a used ice one until one comes out or until the kid grows up.. Which ever comes first lol.

We had our third kid this year and now I really want a Tesla Minivan. I know the X is sort of a minivan but that‚Äôs way out of my budget. Come on Tesla!
Model X is essentially a minivan but without the stigma.
You can find people selling them used with <100 miles for less than $1000 on Tesla forums.
Nearly zero improvement for LRR tires on an ICE car
Van
"Yeah early M3 was... an experience. I think more accurately it was a combination of factory ""oopsies"", part shortages, and customers deciding last-minute that they wanted  different wheels. We saved the first few sets as loaner wheels, but after a while we had so many that we literally didn't have anywhere to keep them. Fremont didn't seem too interested in taking them back (I think they had bigger problems at that point), so management basically said ""make em' go away"" and we did! Our lead service advisor had sport wheels on his beige 93 camry for a while, lol."
"I'd rather drag an anchor, I hate those wheels."
It‚Äôs my single regret getting an LR. I wish I‚Äôd gone performance solely for the wheels.
"I'm not sure if I remember correctly, but since Tesla's brake less, they need less airflow to cool the brakes, so maybe this isn't the best idea.. but I'm no engineer."
They remind me of cauliflower ear.
"Tesla sells them with or without the wheels. But there is no shortage of them on eBay.

My covers were stolen once and I had to buy them again for $120. The asshole also scratched up my rims with the flathead they used to pry off the covers. Now if I keep the covers off they look like shit. At least I like the aero wheel look."
hmmm i kinda want these on my Volt lol
More likely that that‚Äôs a service techs car and those were rims that were going to be scrapped anyway. So he/she bought em and put them on their own car

Do you guys get a discount on Tesla‚Äôs ?
I like mine in black.  https://i.imgur.com/10KDORa.jpg
Well they certainly look like shit on this minivan. But I do like them on my Model 3.
Why? You can‚Äôt see them when you drive. Why do you care?
Can always buy aftermarket wheels or the wheels from Tesla that were on the m3p. Not cheap to get them from Tesla but after market has a lot of nice options. I just took the aero covers off my LR and it‚Äôs not bad
Not an issue for your average Toyota driver.
That minivan probably won't be able to do the entire 40-minute track session but overheating brakes on the street aren't going to be a problem for any set of wheels.
Not an issue. Old steel rims have even less airflow.
They could always take the aero cover off.
The inside face of the wheel is wide open and I understand non-aero cars have more air flow underneath. So maybe there is enough air flow even for racing that minivan. But we can only guess without wind tunnel testing.
"Idk about braking less but they do need a stronger braking force due to their extreme weight of the battery.

Edit: a quick google search finds that the average SUV weight is about 4.8k lbs or more,  and the Tesla Model X SUV weight over 5k lbs. So in this case the brakes probably are doing LESS braking with MORE effect for the van than the original set.

And yes I understand a tire, hub, braking system, and rim are all separate parts. 

Edit 2: specifying"
"I like how the aero wheels are either loved or hated. 

I love them. They give me a slight nostalgia from the Batman Forever batmobile even though they don‚Äôt look too similar. And they‚Äôre practical, too."
Sentry Mode capture that ordeal?
They might actually look pretty good on a Volt.

"Yeah absolutely, sorry not trying to judge those that like them.  I don't really care what anybody drives or does to their car.  I just personally don't like them."
I think they look even nicer when it's below 50f (probably like 12c I'm guessing).
By that logic why does anyone care about what clothes they wear?
"I can, I only drive along highly reflective windows

/s"
"Could potentially be an issue if someone is riding their brakes going down a mountain, but obviously that's not the way to do it, both in an ice or electric car."
"I'm not sure what that edit is supposed to mean. However, if it means what I think it means, I would like to let you know that the wheel and tire is a completely separate device from the brake system. Changing the wheels on a vehicle does not involving changing the brakes."
Regenerative Braking uses the motor to brake and generate power. That means that the brake system in a car with Regen. has to do less.
Through a series of user errors it happened to not be enabled at the time. Tesla has made some software changes to prevent me from messing up again.
"I'm all about function over form anyway, but I think they look good in general.

Too bad the model 3 wheels are wider than the volt's"
üòç
Do you get any discounts on buying or leasing space ships?
I‚Äôd take the SpaceX job any day
 SpaceX sounds like a pretty sweet gig haha
Can confirm. First vehicle gets free FSD.
But if you get promoted you lose it. Stays with the position. /s lol
Exactly why I don't wear clothes.
I can see my clothes and people often take pictures in outfits.  It‚Äôs still not a great analogy because there‚Äôs nothing wrong with wanting to like the look of your car.
Mirrors and other reflective objects.
"I‚Äôve got a question, if I do someday go to the mountains, should I take my aero wheels covers off?"
5% off goes a long way on multi-million dollar satellite launches.
Space super charging network is bad right now. I‚Äôd hold off
I‚Äôd like to know as well
Interned there one summer.. was fun but don‚Äôt recommend compared to other jobs.
That makes sense.  It‚Äôs software so marginal cost is zero to add it with a rare chance of lost revenue if the employee would have bought FSD on their own.
That has not been the experience for me. PA to supervisor and the model 3 still has it after 2.5 years
"Dwight, please put your shirt back on."
That's exactly my point. You don't generally stare at yourself but yet you care how you look. You may not be able to see your car while you're inside of it but you still care how it looks.
Weird. You don't even need one of those to look at how your car looks. So maybe it matters.
No
"No, you would be using regen breaking in a Tesla (and in an ICE you'd be using engine breaking)."
Panel gaps become a bit more risky as well
"The deep space network is such a rip-off, it only has stations on earth!"
Nonsense.  Elon‚Äôs Roadster has gone a few hundred million kilometers without a charge!
‚ÄúOther jobs‚Äù feels kinda vague
Why not?
It's a joke since FSD stays with the vin not the owner.
It‚Äôs solar-system powered.
"It's rocket-powered, it's just got really low drag and won't be coasting to a stop for a while."
You better schedule a service appointment. Screen still shows Parked
Hit it Chewy...
I‚Äôm always bummed when I end up the 2nd car at a 2-car on-ramp light
"Test drove one for the first time today, and even though it was a LR, daaaamn.  So fast in a way no ICE car I've ever driven is. I'll ultimately buy a Performance, so I can't imagine how that feels..."
Every. Single. Time. So true
"Impulse power, Mr. Crusher."
Ha ha!!! So true. Surprised I‚Äôve never seen this before
This is accurate.
I experienced this for the first time... it freaked me out- the car went from a sensible 36 mph to 71 in seconds...
"Isn't fun to blast past all those fast BMWs and Mercedes!!

I've got an on ramp that I use all the time. It's a about a 20 degrees angle upwards.  My M3 flies past all those super expensive sports saloons.

Big grin on my face!!"
"Haha, yeah.  Often you can see the surprise in the face of others like ""WTF how did they do that?"""
Wait until plaid comes out
Have Model 3 can confirm
"Yesssssssssssss!

Edit: my gf always says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre such a 5 year old!‚Äù And I reply ‚Äúhell yes I am‚Äù as I watch her head smash into the headrest:)"
It never gets old.
"""Daaaymnnn, this thing feels like a spaceship."" Is my number one response when showing off my M3 DM."
"I'm probably the only non star wars fan here..

"
Ya see see sir we're at now, now. Everything that's happening now is happening now."
Can confirm. I merged onto the belt line in 12 parsecs.
This is that the screen does in the P100D with Ludicrous Plus. Maybe other models too.
K
You‚Äôre not wrong. Beta issues ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I heard that the model 3 made the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs!
You'd* better
"Yeah, the P is shows its in Parsec speed mode."
"I wait.... pretend that I don't know it's 2 cars per green.

GUN IT !!"
"A Performance is stupid fast. No one needs to go that fast, and it's amazing. I've had mine almost a year now, and I still love doing launches in it."
"I love my performance, but honestly if I buy another M3 it will be the LR

The performance is fun, but it‚Äôs so rare to actually be able to use it, that most of the time I‚Äôm using a little less performance than the LR has anyway.

I only really use the performance‚Äôs full potential when showing someone the car for the first time, and you get 98% of the same reaction with the LR

I mean, if range really doesn‚Äôt matter for your usage or you just love raw performance that much, I‚Äôm not gonna tell you not to get the M3P, but I find myself wishing I had an extra 30 miles of range more often than I find myself using more than 80% throttle"
"Here's how performance is: you hit the pedal to match speed to merge, whoops, 90mph, time to brake to merge into traffic"
"Less than a year in. The daily driver pilot sports are dead, a set of nitto track tires bit the dust, and the newest set of pilot sports are looking thin in the rear already.  If you enjoy torque and driving, plan for tires.  Coming up on 40k in 11 months, I've put more ass time in it this year than I ever imagined I would, blame pandemic."
It‚Äôs hot off the press :)!
36 mph is 57.94 km/h
"An Audi decided to test me to see if I'd take the bait on an open stretch of four lane highway with no other cars around. Next thing I know they're way behind and I'm going 126mph and I'm just think ""how did that happen?"""
"Nah, we don't judge... there's still a new hope for you !  :D"
Nope ‚Äì that‚Äôs within spec
My least favorite driver lol
"I appreciate the honest feedback-  I'm definitely not fully decided yet, but a car's performance has always been a priority for me. I also can work fully remote and have an office that I sometimes go into (pre-COVID anyway) that's a 20 mile round trip, with my spouse having an SUV for any longer driving trips, so range would be at least second on my list of priorities.  I've also had a few times in the past where I couldn't afford the highest trim in a car I liked so I went down a trim or two and always regretted it.  

That's the interesting thing though, after now driving the LR, it's still SO FAST compared to any other vehicle I've owned, and I'm assuming that the tester wasn't equipped with the acceleration boost, so there's that option too.  I have plenty of time to decide however as my current car is a lease that's up next summer, so that's good cause man, it could be a hard decision."
I have a Performance Stealth. Best of both worlds! :)
"Yeah!! I meant surprised no one had done it before.  It‚Äôs super creative and I‚Äôm a StarWars nerd...

Seriously. Thanks for sharing. Made me laugh"
Must be part of FSD package
"Ha, but to clarify -- I don't do it with cars behind me. I want to gun it... not be an asshole  :D"
"The tester probably did have the acceleration boost (it‚Äôs a software option only, so I can‚Äôt think why Tesla wouldn‚Äôt enable it), and there are no other trim differences I‚Äôm aware of, so literally all you‚Äôre doing is swapping a little acceleration for a little range.

The only other difference I‚Äôm aware of is the wheels, the Performance wheels are bigger (and, tbh, less convenient - they‚Äôre much easier to scrape)

But yeah, if you have no need for the extra range then the performance is fun too, but it doesn‚Äôt actually feel that much faster IMO. I‚Äôd notice it if it drove them back to back, but the LR can still spank pretty much anything it‚Äôs likely to meet"
"Haha you're all good, just poking fun"
"Even then, if you hold back to be the first car, you end up ramming into the back of car 2. That‚Äôs when I yell ‚ÄúTeam Ramrod!‚Äù"
"Is that the 3M Satin grey? ü§î 
Looks awesome!"
Is the parking sensor peeling or is it the lighting?
Holy shit that looks awesome! üòé
Nice looking gray there.
"More pics pls. And if there's any chance you could find the name of the color, would really appreciate it."
Space Grey should be a choice.
üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Looks stunning!!!
"Gorgeous man, gonna have to show the wrap shop this pic when I‚Äôm wrapping my car"
"Whoa, looks like a video game in real life!"
Big YUP
Love it.
Wow. So dope.
Looks awesome! How much did this cost for you in Shanghai?
Sweet - looks great!
Love this silver. Sheeeeeeeesh
"I don‚Äôt normally dig grey over their white but damn, this shot has me reconsidering..."
"Beautiful man! Makes me even more excited, mine is getting wrapped in the same Dark Satin Grey in two weeks."
"Where we go, we don't need roads!"
This is gorgeous... I‚Äôm starting to question if I want to go the wrap route!
Love it!!
Looks awesome. Congrats!
Man that is sexy
"Wow. Looks awesome. 
Can you post some more pics please?"
"White 3. Wrapped front bumper, headlights and mirror with clear 3M wrap, cost $350.00. Very pleased as it protects against bugs and road-nicks."
2021 Model?
What‚Äôs it‚Äôs name?
I have no idea actually. A local Tesla workshop did it for me..I just picked the color and style lol.
"It seems like an air bubble to me, the one on the right side of the picture is perfect.

Edit: seems like the sensor has been pushed inwards in the attempt to push the air out of it."
Try 3m satin dark gray
Good idea man
"Whole thing (wrapping, and they did the rim too) cost me 10k rmb which is like $1500"
My original color is black and I see 3 of those every mile in Shanghai..had to do something about it :) didn‚Äôt regret at all
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love it!
hentai
Delivered to me 3 weeks ago.
Can you please find out and let us know. I really want this now!
Gorgeous
Is it a transparent film that was layed over to make it look satin or did you choose a complete new colour?
"may I ask, how much does that cost in Shanghai?"
I think people want to know the exact color before trying and spending $5k+
Do you have pics of the rim?
hentai
3m satin dark gray should look exactly like this
It‚Äôs not transparent
Around $1500
Everything cheaper in China lol
I don‚Äôt know the exact color because the workshop only let me choose from a group of samples. Satin dark gray is the closest I can find tho. I guess you can show the pic to the wrapping shop.
Wait what color is this though?
Thanks!
"Wait.. So this is color film?
Not a black car with transparent satin?

Just trying to get my info straight as I'm legit going to get this.
Also, how well do wraps work on cars that are 2 years old with less than perfect paint? Bubble? or doesn't matter?"
They‚Äôre saying ask the workshop.
I think you just show this pic to the wrapping shop and ask them..
That‚Äôs Truckla. Very famous on YouTube.
Very fitting place to spot truckla!
Say hi to Simone from me!
"This is the HD on Figueroa in LA, yes?"
"https://youtu.be/jKv_N0IDS2A

Making of video"
Just watched the build.... very entertaining!
A wild Truckla appeared
Simone Giertz in the wild!
Chevy El Camino reincarnated.
Forget about chrome delete on this baby --- Rhino-Liner the whole thing!
It‚Äôs well done but fuck no
Truckla!
"This might sound underinformed, but would this be the first pick up truck to have an EV carpool sticker?"
People are shitting on this. I can't say I like it but it does look very professionally done.
Simone!
I feel awkward but kinda dig the rims
I thought the Subaru Baja era was over. I was wrong.
Get one yourself: https://youtu.be/R35gWBtLCYg
I wish Tesla would make a Model 3 Coupe/Convertible
That's eerily AWESOME! üòÉ  don't know what else to say but hoorah to ingenuity.
Y tho
There was a bolt posted recently modified exactly like this. What‚Äôs goin on with people chopping up the EVs recently?
Probably should be in the r/DIWhy?
It‚Äôs sort of cool but my eyes hurt if i look at it too long
I think it‚Äôs nice but for the the rims are just yuck
r/madlads
I never realized how shitty the paint is around the rear door handle
It hurts to see this!
BARF.
Just wait for the cybertruck like us patient people
No shit! Didn't know it was her car. So cool!
Sold? New plates
u/simsalapim
Yup!
She just moved to LA
"The theme never really died in Australia, ""[utes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Ute)"" are very popular.  Simon's Trucka would fit right in, the car gives off a very similar vibe."
Roll it on and forget about it
Publicity
Maybe demand and no supply.
r/madlass
afaik the Truckla plates were fake ones for the ad.
OP should blank out the number on the plates for the safety of car owner.
"Now now, lets not forget our Ford Utes ;) ... [https://www.ford.com.au/about-ford/History/falcon-ute/](https://www.ford.com.au/about-ford/History/falcon-ute/)"
She wanted a tesla truck so made one. Not publicity
She is the queen of shitty robots: https://youtu.be/jKv_N0IDS2A
Plates are public data. Blanking them out does nothing.
*Said* she wanted a Tesla truck. Why would you assume the motivations of an influencer who gets paid for clicks and ads?
"It‚Äôs a courtesy move, I don‚Äôt think internet famous women would appreciate the dox.  

Edit: for clarification"
"Everyone knows that's Simone's truck though, she made a video about it. Public information isn't doxing."
She didn‚Äôt put her plate number in the video... makes me think she probably prefers not to have it out there but I see we have to agree to disagree about blanking it out as a courteous move.
I agree with you
Blanking out plates makes sense if the car is otherwise nondescript and is the only way someone could identify the owner... everyone knows whose car this is from a mile away with or without the plates.
OP didn‚Äôt.
Biggest question is road noise with an actual meter to compare and graph the differences
A side-by-side of the frunk would be amazing!
Take a video of you sexy washing it in slow mo
Can you try to snap the new areo on the 2019?
Energy usage with the same interior climate.
Could you check if there is a ski-hole in the middle backseat? Think the Y has it but the old 3 didn't. Also check if there's a button to fold the backseats in the trunk like on the Y
"Show the front and back seats, along with the different white interior areas. I got black outside and white interior coming in December hopefully! Would love to see how the white interior looks with the new center console."
I‚Äôd definitely watch. I‚Äôm looking at this same config.
Would love to hear your thoughts on getting white seats vs black seats! I'm looking at a white model 3 as well but can't make up my mind about black vs white seats haha.
I would like to see the heat pump please. Thanks.
"Looking forward to this.  I plan on joining white on white this spring.  Always wanted the 19"" tires, but the new 19"" in the refresh have me reconsidering and getting the stock 18s and taking aeros off"
"Just curious - what day did you order, what trim, and general location?"
White on white gang. Wassup. The best combo.
"You‚Äôre TALL! Can you fit in there? Haha. And I think you make that car look even better, haha!"
Did you get 1 year trial of premium connectivity or 1 month trial? I heard the refreshed SR+ get 1 year trial now...
!RemindMe 1week
Super random but did you get any pictures of the blue one! I ordered that config and am trying to see live shots :) Congrats hope you love your beautiful machine!
"Are you like 6'5""?"
Can you take a closeup of the new black trim?
I wonder if you can buy the new aero wheel covers for old model 3
The real question is do we have the same rims under new aero caps?
I would give my first-born to find out if the 12 mini charges or not
Incredible how people do Tesla‚Äôs marketing for them... for free.
"Seats are going to be the same as before, but I can still show them. :)"
What region/state are you in?
"Charging speed difference? New battery? 
These are questions no one has covered!"
Did you get floor mats? Carpet ones? Or did you order all weather?
I spy with my little eye the Vancouver delivery center. Was it busy there when you took delivery?
It looks so good. Glad I went for that combo.
"Dope, congrats and enjoy!!"
If the wheels look any different with the new aero covers off.
What is the output of the front USB C ports?
Just waiting on mine. Same config! Congrats! What state or province?
Top Gear style review?
I‚Äôve been wanting to see if the rims underneath the aero caps are different from the older models. It‚Äôd be great if you could *cover* that
"I'd like to see the innards of the new console, particularly as concerns the phone tray, any removable parts to it, and any compartment underneath the phone tray."
How can we watch this video of yours?
Do you think the IPhone 12 Pro Max with a leather case will fit in the wireless charging slot?
"I want to know if those new Aero Caps will fit on the older 18"" Aero wheels. They look cool"
Do you have an iPhone12 or 2020 SE?  If so does your wireless charging cut out after 10ish seconds?
VancouverBC?
"Is this Vancouver, BC"
"Im unsure wether I want a black or white exterior, what do you think of the white with the black accents?"
"Very nice, the white does pop.  But when did Tesla start giving them a year they weren't built in?  My understanding is the year your car was built is the year it is.  Did they actually print 2021 on the title?"
I ordered the same except I got LR white on white can‚Äôt wait for the delivery. Expected for December
I'd like to see you swapping it for my 2020 Model 3...
"nosie comparsion with old ones, better to use decible meter or something that quantify this instead of saying a little bit improvement. Also, are you going to post this on youtube? Can I have the channel name so that I can follow now? Thank you"
Can you take a picture of the scroll wheels on the steering wheel? I heard they're metal now as opposed to the rubbery ones I have.
Congrats! Welcome!
"Close ups of the wheels would be good, contemplating between the default 2021 ones and upgrading."
Are the aero covers swappable?
"I concur with the road noise comments, also a glass overview would be nice. Like, is it really double the original glass, or just two thinner panels?"
Did Tesla fix their QC with the new Model 3s? All cars in the lot seem to have perfect panel alignment.
Would be great to show places you can visit within range of a supercharger. All too often do people say that it's hard to take road trips. Showing that you can go to rural areas or national parks with an EV is one of the final things in front of mass adoption.
"Damn, you're fineeeeeee. ;)

The car is nice too."
"This is a weird one, but is it possible to weigh your car?

The difference compared to historical weight of the SR+ can clue in to any changes to the battery."
"As a side, what films do you make and where can they be viewed? I studied film ages ago and would love to see your stuff!"
"I find it strange so many SRs are being delivered, mainly because in the UK they won't be delivered until February, but LR and PM3 are due to arrive in November/December. Congrats by the way! üòÇ"
Can you offer some reviews on how the rear seats are as a tall person? Thanks :D
"Have you noticed, if the orientation of the touchscreen has slightly changed to face the driver?"
"Can you let us know how much noise the heat pump makes? (buzzing, grinding, humming)"
Are there still roof rack attachments?
Quality difference?
Do these come with a USB in the glovebox for sentry mode?
ETA on the video? What's your Youtube account?
"Actual range would be awesome too, rather than the ‚Äúrated‚Äù"
"Getting the same looks, just LR... Cannot wait for it :)

  
Definitely would like to compare noise difference, if you have proper tools to measure.

Also, it would be interesting to see if there are any changes to front lights (stronger and more focused beams). There are rumours that for European version that is the case, so might not be applicable for this one."
"Oh! A filmmaker with a model 3! I‚Äôm on the verge of grabbing one myself but would love to see a video of loading this thing up with gear. If you‚Äôre up for showing something like that I‚Äôd be very interested. Pelican cases, tripods, c-stands, the works."
"Looks good. Congrats.  
Aside from the blue one behind yours did you spot any other colors with the 2021 refresh?  
Keen to see how the MSM and Red look with the chrome delete."
"Are the Tesla logos on the frunk and boot in the satin black finish?  
The refresh model shown in Hong Kong video had black logos but every customer's car I have seen so far has still had the chrome logos."
Range test accounting for degredation. Watch Tesla Bjorn to see how to do one right!
How long from order until delivery as well?
Is your video up yet?
"Hey everyone, thanks for all the amazing comments. Immediately after delivery I had a COVID scare and was bed ridden for a week. I‚Äôm feeling a lot better, tested negative so no worries about Vancouver BC delivery centre exposure.

I‚Äôll be filming this over the next week or two"
Everyone with a Tesla is a film maker.....
"Comparison of dick sizes.

!remindme 1 week"
"I would like to see girls, tons of girls around the car, minus the rap music"
"We're good, the refresh isn't much different and everything has been covered already."
Improved but still loud at high speed. Low speed is big difference. Will cover this
this.
Excellent idea!
Not sure if it would be me or the car coming across as sexy
Haha
Yes
"I read in a comment on another post somewhere that someone had done so already, they are swappable"
^this please! Really want to upgrade my old aero caps to the new design
Already almost have an answer for you: absolutely incredible efficiency difference. Will cover this
I‚Äôll explain my thoughts on it but in the interest of being honest I can‚Äôt review them in terms of longevity
Get white. It‚Äôs iconic plus they‚Äôre super easy to clean
"I can show it, but there is no doubt that it has a heat pump and it‚Äôs likely the same exact part as Model Y."
Having seen those in person: they look worse. :(
18s have better ride. Who cares how your wheels look if they don‚Äôt feel nice
"I ordered in June, had to sell my car first. I‚Äôve been first on the list since July, sold my car late last month."
"When I got into the car I immediately named it Slut. Then there were some connectivity issues and they needed to pair my car and find it by name. So, I changed it to Storm Trooper."
"I‚Äôm flattered, and yes I am tall and yes I fit. Door frame is difficult sometimes on sedans but this has a glass roof so verticals are excellent. Seat also gets super low."

"Blue one was gorgeous, you‚Äôll love it with the black trim"
Yes
Yup
I‚Äôll see if they fit
Will you fedex me the child?
"Make a compelling product > product sells itself

Make a shit product > pay to sell the product"
Wanted to know if the blue jean imprint thing is still an issue on the white seats! Thanks!
"Tesla makes minor changes to the seats constantly. Even things like the stitching patterns can change in cars a few months apart. Though a lot of the changes are internal, things like motors and padding inside that might not be visible."
I live in Canada. Delivery centre was Vancouver. I live on Vancouver Island in Victoria.
"SR Still has no floor mats. No frunk mat either. I bought carpet, dislike all weather rubber mats in luxury oriented cars. In a truck or a cop car, sure, or maybe in a climate that you really think is going to destroy your interior upholstery, but I live in Victoria BC, we get like maybe a week of snow a year. The rest of the time, well... there‚Äôs a reason they refer to the Vancouver area as Rain-couver."
It was a quiet day of 52 deliveries. *decimating* BMW/Merc. :D
I‚Äôll have to get some sort of metering app to figure that out
British Columbia!
That would be epic
Will do!
">console

yes!  Very curious (and pretty jealous) about the new console.  I wrapped my piano black version, which helped a lot, but the layout is pretty awkward."
"Great question, I‚Äôm going to be posting it on YouTube.com/warrenweekly most likely."
"Yes, again though, charging on it is patchy even without the case. Like all phones I‚Äôve tested on it!"
"I can show 12 Pro Max on wireless charging pad. Spoiler alert: it works, but the entire pad seems to be intermittent no matter what phone"
I was having wireless charging issues with my iPhone 12 pro until the latest iOS update.
"We have both, between wife and I.  Both work just fine on the refresh M3!  Picked ours up yesterday as well!"
"Yes, I‚Äôm in Victoria."
Yes
I would not recommend the black interior personally. As far as I know it‚Äôs a single coat. And you have to pay for it. Black is harder to keep looking good than any other color
"Yes, and ‚Äútitle‚Äù is an American insurance thing. Not the official way of knowing a cars year. It‚Äôs whatever they register the car as tagged to the VIN. This car is a 2021."
Why on earth
You want to trade me for your performance model 3?
"Yup they‚Äôre metal, I‚Äôll add this to the video"
"Aero covers are the more noticeable difference, the rims underneath are virtually identical"
"Someone asked that already, I‚Äôll try to figure that out for you"
I mean maaaaaaaybe it‚Äôs a bit better but there are absolutely still the same issues. It‚Äôs so hard to tell whether or not that‚Äôs just a fluke
Most of what I do is client work for ads. Haven‚Äôt been in the game for a few years myself but getting back in!
"Personally I believe the SR+ is Tesla‚Äôs bread and butter car. Long range is such a niche need. SR+ is still so zippy too, and now with 423kms of range and a huge cold weather efficiency boost, the range is so not even worth mentioning."
Zero. Hahahaha
Yes
"They were all there, they all looked great! Blue is a big improvement. Grey looked better. Red looked better. Black is a toss up because IMO black cars are one of the few you can rock chrome on or black them out just two different looks"
Still has chrome logos
"I think I was mistaken about the Hong Kong car, watching the video again it may be just the angle/lighting making me think they were satin black too."
Everyone who is a film maker drives a Tesla *
I‚Äôm going to listen to the 156 other comments :)
Thanks! LR or SR?
"I got a 50% reduction in my 2018 RWD LR built week 8/18 as shown by the android app sound meter by installing my old standby touring tire, Pirelli P7. You lose some handling crispness but unless you track the car you would not noticed the difference except for the much smoother ride.

 I wore the OEM Contis (19"") out at 18 mos. Not impressed by that at all. 28,000 miles was all they could go and I did not race the car. They are great for showing off but not so good for road tripping due to noise and harshness."
"Record it and graph, ie use a dash mount in the same position and orientation and same microphone."
Why not both?
Def you
"Yes please on this one. Snapping on the old aero cover on the new rim, and then also snapping the new aero cover on the old rim. Fingers crossed both are possible! Thanks man, beautiful car"
And reverse with old Aeros on new wheels please. I like old Aeros better actually.
Wanna trade?
Thanks. I got my M3 in July so last quarter before the refresh.
"Exellent! I'd like to know the difference in energy used to heat vs the resistive heater for a range of temperatures, although that might not be the simplest thing to test!"
"This is the first I'm hearing about this.

What was the change to the sport wheels?

Any pics?"
Had a feeling that was the case
"I 2nd that. Maybe if you coat them in black, they would look better.

I think the issue is that it looks flatter and no depth to it. That's why it looks way smaller and like a regular wheel IMHO."
I would 100%.
Wait... it took 4 months for delivery!?
Lmao...wha...what.
Why slut? That‚Äôs fucked up.
Can you show how high your knees have to be bent up? Curious if leg room when it‚Äôs pushed all the way back.
I was wondering the same. Thanks!
Long Range gets forever right?
Yes please :) I also ordered a blue one. Was hesitant at first because I initially fell in love with the chrome on blue of the previous model. But the new improvements were hard to pass on.
"Yes please!! That'd be sick, thank you :) Hope you're enjoying your car"
"Thanks! I definitely do not regret ordering the Blue one! 

By the way, which floor mats do you have? They look nice! Would you mind snapping a picture of the back seat with the floor mats?"
"Thank you for these shots! Your car looks mad nice, did ya end up taking outdoor shots? Trying to see how the blue looks in outdoor lighting"
Yes please!
So there‚Äôs this minor detail I forgot to mention which is that I have no children at this time
They‚Äôre innovative... not super well made... but innovative lol. Tesla‚Äôs have more factory defects than we‚Äôd all like to admit
"What about Google? They make some great products, then don't market them, then discontinue them because they didn't do enough marketing."
"I think the physics will remain the same: friction will transfer loose particles. Fresh jeans that lose a lot of their dye will stain anything really. More of a matter of how well it can be cleaned off, which as I‚Äôm told by previous white seat owners, is exceptional already."
"Thanks for that, I‚Äôll document the current seats thoroughly"
I'm up in Campbell River waiting to get mine soon!
THANK YOU finally someone speaking truth on ugly all-weather mats.
"Thanks for clarifying. Kinda boggles my mind a new car wouldn't come with stock carpet Floor mats. 

On another note, I hear the tpms on 2021 is also different. Since you're in Victoria (I'm in Vancouver) will you be looking into a winter set? I've always had a winter set on my cars so I'll probably get one for the 3. Just curious if you've heard anything about them. Congrats on the car btw!"
Did you get tesla ones or another brand?
"Interesting. The SC in Carlsbad wouldn't tell us the number of deliveries the day we picked up -- ""We're not allowed to say"" -- place was hopping busy though!"
Any update on this?
Excited for you to post your video on YouTube. May you compare the center console depth cavity between the 2021 and the previous M3 models? Measurement wise.
Why?

That‚Äôs not Vancouver though
I was actually talking about the exterior

Although depending on your perspective it might not even be that bad a trade, if you'd prefer a Performance"
"Well, not literally - yours is LHD mine is RHD and I suspect the import costs would kill us

I do wish I'd bought an LR and waited 6 months though, for the 2021 model"

Still waiting on that video
!remindme 1 week
No improvements?
I ll tell that to my grandma then... she will be happy to know she is also a film maker....
SR
One of the benefits of the whole film maker thing: I have the tools
Okay
Man Reddit is one hell of a place lmao
You‚Äôre wrong and you should feel bad
Messaged you!
"I‚Äôm going to test this thoroughly. Don‚Äôt you worry, baby."
Nice name
Basically they just made them look worse. Lol
I'm probably doing Tsportsline wheels if I can't get the old sports when I upgrade.
"No, I was first on the list, like I said I had to sell my car first and I sold it late last month..."
"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù and when I‚Äôm back far enough for my legs to be comfortable, I can‚Äôt reach the wheel comfortably. The wheel needs more reach, like a Volvo. (Made for tall people with bad backs like me!)"
Those floor mats are the 3D Maxpider from Costco.
"Sorry, it‚Äôs going to rain hard all week so no pictures."
Same and same
This can be remedied
I should be clear: compelling product does not equal well made product. ;)
"True but when there‚Äôs a factory defect with a Tesla, you take it to the body shop if your bothered by it. 

If another car maker has a factory defect, it could be a major mechanical component. I‚Äôve had 4 cars all have things like this all fixed under warranty but things that couldn‚Äôt be ignored."
"Google, in my opinion, struggles sometimes to make products *compelling*. There are great feature sets, but also a lot of gimmick ones. For example: pixel 4, nobody wanted a forward facing radar for gesture controls. They thought it was such a compelling feature they didn‚Äôt even market. Dead. Google also kills a lot of support by following the cringe marketing strategy of dissing competition (Apple for the aux jack delete and then the notch the next year) and then just hypocritically doing the exact thing they bashed the other company for the year prior.

Even gimmicks when it comes to Tesla put a smile on your face because they are so absurd - like farting.

Also, Tesla is making products that the entire industry is trying to kill and say are impossible. People get passionate about preaching the truth"
Think it's only the texture of the seat controls that have changed. From glossy to matte or metal i think. Still HD closeups of the various changes would be nice to see
Congrats! Refresh is a big change
"I KNOW RIGHT. People are so quick to ruin their interiors with those things. Comfort out the window. 

Take care of your cars people! God forbid you vacuum it out once a week or replace the mats after 5 years of use!!"
"Thanks Bam,

No, I‚Äôm not going to buy winters this year. Even in RWD, the traction control on these things is so unbelievable that I don‚Äôt need it for acceleration. Tested it on my friends SR+ last year and there wasn‚Äôt really any need. I think I will next year though

Carpet: yes it‚Äôs lame. No excuse really. I imagine it‚Äôs because so many people just throw them out and buy rubber fucking floor mats the second they buy the car ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Tesla ones
Sure!
Because... I want to see it?
Good bot
Are your phones naked?
*sigh* yes but this is still the Great Northern Way delivery centre in Vancouver. This picture is Vancouver. We don‚Äôt have a delivery location in Victoria
"He miswrote. he is talking about exterior paint. It‚Äôs 1 coat. White is 3 coat. Avoid black, it‚Äôs a like a second job in terms of upkeep, detailing"

How is the paint and panel gaps? My white LR should be arriving in a couple of weeks fingers crossed.
"You sir have the exact model I ordered. Curious if there is anything new with the white interior, although I doubt it. Will be following your posts closely : )"
If your friend‚Äôs car has premium interior I‚Äôd love to hear the difference of the audio quality
But are *you* a tool
Ok but one thing I am curious about is the glare of the white. I see some random complaints about white glare on the windows. Perhaps you can pan around to show us how ‚Äúbad‚Äù the glare is? I mean I‚Äôm still doing white on white but I‚Äôm definitely curious.
Why?
"I have to agree, the new sport wheels look terrible. I don't know how but the subtle changes they made make them look cheap and somehow smaller than 19""."
Link?
What was your last car
"Do the 3D Maxpider fit the 2021 model well, specifically the front passenger mat?"
Your mom?
Most brands don‚Äôt have their roofs flying off
"I agree most rubber floor mats look like crap, but I actually think the low profile ones Tesla sells fit the aesthetic of the car really well."
So what‚Äôs under the no floor mats?
Lol i mean why is the layout awkward
Yes. Mine works for about 10 seconds stops and then just goes on and off the entire time I drive. Been doing it since ios14 beta.
Which showroom did you use or didn‚Äôt at all?
Okay thank you! Do you know if the grey one is a 3 coat or also only a 1 coat?
Is this SR? I thought it was LR
"I‚Äôve never seen a tightly specced Tesla, much less a 3 or Y. It‚Äôs just inherently going to always be a certain build tolerance until they change those tolerances. This is all the same stuff, nothing major, not on the level of Benz. *Shrug*"
I ordered this one as well!
I don‚Äôt think there is but it‚Äôs possible
"Funny you say that, he had partial premium but upgraded the audio himself. It‚Äôs about 25-30% ‚Äúbetter‚Äù on the premium interiors. Much more bass, fuller mids"
Dude what‚Äôs your issue
It‚Äôs not that bad imo. I‚Äôve only had mine for 5 months but I rarely notice it...if ever.
I've had my white on white for a few months now and this was my biggest concern. I've not had any significant issues and have driven on the clearest and brightest of days. Worth it.
"They look smaller than the 18s. You also lose the dark mode look, and the possibility of aero covers. And it costs money.

The inner and side walls of the rim got pushed out a ton to create a more bulbous / bulged look to the alloy itself, instead of low profile. I think they tried to make the alloys more aero... and it just ends up being a flop"
"I think it's just tsportsline.com 

They have really nice wheels for teslas and plenty of users here and in TMC recommend them. 

Little cheaper than the Tesla 19 sports too."
"I'm not the guy you were asking, but [I personally like these](https://tsportline.com/collections/model-y-wheels/products/tesla-model-y-19-ts5-flow-forged-tesla-wheel-set-of-4)."
A 2013 335i
"*Off with his head*

I kid. They are the best option, sure!"
I use the Tesla carpet floor mats
"ha!  I gotcha...  essentially they gave the storage area two lids.  One is the phone holder that lifts up, the other is the very finicky magnet based lid that doesn't always close.  and when it is open the corner digs into my leg.  Inside it is just a big empty box, so I got a 3rd party storage insert for sunglasses, keys etc which helps.  But if you need to access the USB ports, or have anything stored there, without the insert, it is just a big jumble, and with it you have to open both ""doors"" or take it out to get access.  Essentially that storage space is kinda a wasted space because of how the doors work and lack of organization.

I think the new design looks much more cohesive and fluid as well with more leather, and less plastic. But not sure how easy it will be to get to the USB ports."
I‚Äôm going to report this to service
Just ordered online!
"The grey one is a metallic paint as far as I remember. It‚Äôs probably 1 or 2 coats. In other words. Primer, paint, buff, paint, clear coat. 

However, The thickness of the paint of all 3 colors is about the same. White needs multiple coats because it‚Äôs translucent of sorts. Metallic paints have their color depths mainly thanks to aluminum shavings, and so does not NEED multiple coats. 

Source: I‚Äôm no paint expert, just measure the paints of multiple Tesla‚Äôs on the parking lot. And talked to a few shops about the application / repair process. Also, language barrier: I‚Äôm danish."
"In another comment he said it was SR. You can buy an aftermarket power trunk if you want, but sure would be nice for Tesla to offer upgrades like that (for a fee, of course). I understand if they can't upgrade to a heat pump, but a power trunk should be NBD to install later."
I must have hit the lotto with my perfectly aligned model 3. Praise the Tesla gods.
how did he do it himself?  just upgraded speakers?
Haha I‚Äôm just playin
Are your windows tinted?
Nice. Thank you. I originally went with black but white just looks like heaven.
"https://electrek.co/2020/10/11/tesla-model-3-wheels-2021-refresh/

To be honest I kinda like them, but they used a matte look on them compared to the glossy metallic look on the old ones, making them look worse. Gonna dipp mine to some dark grey like the old performance 20"" ones"
"It was probably to reinforce the casting strength too since Tesla wheels crack easily. By pushing the spokes out and having circumferential ring at the perimeter, the weight is more distributed and impact force is spread out throughout the whole wheel not just a localized spot. Less dents."
"Tsportline.com, your link sent me to a gambling app lol"
"Personally, I think these are the best wheels for the Model 3. They are kind of replicas of the Roaster and they look fantastic. Specially on the Performance version as they show the break calipers."
"But is it carpet, fabric, metal or plastic under them?"
"The storage compartment is the same though... One big deep space. USB ports moved to the center console/armrest compartment (I thought this was always there?)

It‚Äôs also not leather, it‚Äôs still plastic but satin finish."
Do you really have to open the phone doors to get access to the middle compartment?
So you went to an open lot and picked it up? Do they still deliver to home?
Okay so you would say that it doesn't really matter too much?
Just ordered the parts from Tesla and did the work himself
"No, no tint on mine"
No stock tint on 2021s yet.
I have white seats but the majority of my glare on the screen comes from the right-rear window.
Can confirm. Heaven.
"I really hated the new 19s in pics when I first saw them, but they are growing on me. I am looking at a blue car and I think the biggest issue with them is the metallic finish on a dark car with chrome delete. They definitely need some kind of powder coat or paint if going on a dark color. Probably look just fine on a white or red car."
"Whoops! You are right. 

https://tsportline.com/"
"I think they‚Äôre designed to look like the Model 3 ‚ÄúZero G‚Äù wheels or the ones that come with the [Track Package.](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-track-package) 

But you‚Äôre right ‚Äî they do look like the Roadster wheels too."
"Satin better than glossy plastic, and it is more contured.  

The usb A ports are under the phone stand in the original, with 2 more in the arm rest.  But with the built in wireless charging, I guess you won't need the other ones."
"I mean, not really, but the compartment is really deep, so it helps.  But you can't really do it if your phone is charging.  It isn't great design.  Really good they updated it."
"Yep,  pick the color you want. Just be aware that black requires the most weekly detailing / cleaning due to the color."
Or ever - only the Y gets it because it‚Äôs legal in 50 states. (Different registration class)
You are!
"You love them, I love them. I think you should get them. LOL"
Oh what I thought there was only one USB port in armrest for data/sentry/music.
"And it slopes towards the phone side right? Well, it also does in refresh and you can‚Äôt lift the charging door because there isn‚Äôt one."
Okay! Thank you for your help!
I really like that color. It looks great with the chrome delete!
"Hey that‚Äôs the free color on the bolt.

Or $3100 on a Porsche Macan."
"I saw a rav4 today with a similar color and I said to myself, m3 would look really nice in that color and here we are!"
Woah! Looks good! For someone looking to wrap there Cybertruck in a few years mind if I ask where I could buy this exact wrap? Looks so good! Like a battleship gray color?
This is my favorite wrap posted yet.
"For as ‚Äúover done‚Äù as nardo is, it sure never gets old."
Its gorgeous! Congrats üëè enjoy it üòõüëçüèº
Reeeeeeealy like that color bro/madam!
LOVE LOVE LOVE this colour! This is what I wanted to do to mine
Avery Dark Grey or Avery Gloss Rock Grey?
"The 3 looks good in this color - especially with those wheels, tint, and chrome delete. Even the red calipers go with it - well done!"
Wow that‚Äôs so nice. What color is this exactly? Bad eyesight
By far my favorite color on any vehicle. I think shocker yellow brake calipers would really set this color combo off.
"I‚Äôm keeping mine stock, but if I did a wrap, that‚Äôs the one."
Looks great! I was considering a Tacoma (before deciding on M3) in this concrete color.
"This looks great, but wondering how do these wraps hold up over time? And what do they cost?"
Looking hella clean!
Please confirm the color! May be looking to wrap in a similar color!
"Yup love the color with the chrome delete. When I bought my M3 it was either a Tacoma in this color Toyota calls it Cement, but I went with an instock white m3.
Edit:spelling"
I saw a Nardo Grey Model 3 here in Montreal and thought it looked great!! Nice job!
Love it. Just like my old Audi A7. Thought of wrapping the P3D but I‚Äôm still in the fence between this or stealth
Dumb question-- when you change the color of your tesla can you change the color of the tesla on the display in your car?
It looks awesome!!
Arguably my favourite colour for a car right now. Looks great.
"Good taste!

Looks like someone dipped a drop of black ink in their whiteout.
What‚Äôs the approximate cost on a wrap?
Why are pics so low res? (specifically 2nd)
Love it! I have the same color on my 2020 Charger
Better than their like $7k for Miami blue that made me reconsider.
I think it's called nardo grey
It‚Äôs Rock Gray!
"Thank you, MamSir"
Rock grey
Nardo Gray
6-8 years. I received a 50% off promo and paid 1800. It was a steal of a deal.
Rock grey
"There‚Äôs a thread about it somewhere on Reddit. Apparently if you open a service case requesting a color change and send pics of your car they will change it in your app. I have mine wrapped and haven‚Äôt tried that yet. LMK how it goes!

Edit: just realized you said in the car so the above doesn‚Äôt apply. But it might work with the service case too!"
"Depends where you‚Äôre located, but typically 3-7k"
I had no idea. So I can‚Äôt do this?
^^haha yes
Congratulations.  The most important question is what are you going to name it?
"Welcome, fam! What trim did you get? What‚Äôre you most excited for?"
Congrats!  I‚Äôm going to pick mine up tomorrow!!!
"Haha, yes! Congrats! Also ordered mine 2h ago :D Can‚Äôt wait."
# ^^**haha** ^**yes**
I'll be doing the same at the end of the month. Been following forever as well. I'm going for the M:Y:LR.
Nice!! I don‚Äôt even have one yet but already feel like i‚Äôve already joined the club :D right? Am i part of the club? Anyone?? Please :(
You're going to love your choice more than you know and you will be looking forward to your next drive for years to come.  Here comes your Tesla smile.  You better get used to it.
haha yes
"Congrats bro! 

Super awesome car with an even cooler community."
Congrats!
Congrats. Hope to buy a M3 LR next year myself. Enjoy your car!!
"Congrats, it‚Äôs going to change your world!  It‚Äôs crazy how people still don‚Äôt understand how much Tesla reeks of coolness!"
Congrats!!!
"Haha
         Yes"
Welcome to the club. ‚Äî Jeff Who
"It‚Äôs getting annoying seeing this same fucking hedgehog on my feed every time I load up Reddit 

BUT 

welcome to the fam. It‚Äôs going to be a dream.  You‚Äôll never go back."
Welcome! I recently did the same. No regrets.
We got our Model 3 in July 2018. Funnest car ever! You'll love it... congratulations!
Welcome to the family. Its going to be a wild ride.
"CONGRATULATIONS On the best thing you'll ever spend money on!! I hope you used someone's referral code! If not there's still time to add one! If you would like to use mine we would both get those supercharger miles making your first few road trips absolutely free!

Either way I'm glad you took the plunge! I've had mine for 2 years now and it really is the best car I've ever driven and I've driven so many different cars and sportscars.

I'm envious of the upgrades you'll get to yours :) Make sure you get a nice window tint and I can't recommend a PPF on your entire front enough. The paint is so thin you'll have chips sooner rather than later.

Congrats again and welcome to the club! Pm me if you have any questions at all!"
nice
Get the haha yes t shirt
Is there a character limit? I‚Äôd like to name her ‚ÄúRazor Crest‚Äù.
We need answers
"Went with Long Range, Midnight Silver, Black interior.

Excited for Autopilot and FSD. Didn't get FSD immediately, but I definitely plan on getting it soon-ish."
What delivery window are you seeing?
I plan on ordering my first Tesla in 14 months (but who's counting!). I love seeing everyone's excitement and upgrades. Gives me ideas for when I pick out mine. I consider us Tesla Padawans lol
"I don‚Äôt know what the limit is, but my son named ours ‚ÄúSpy Cruiser‚Äù which is the same number of letters."
"Currently waiting on mine, delivery estimated in the beginning of December. I told my daughter she could name it, looks like I going to be driving Twilight Sparkle"
Yeah I‚Äôd say get it soon before they jack the price up again
CONGRATS!
"December, I am living in Germany btw."
Stop the count!
I'd say wait for the subscription model to roll out. Paying an addition $10k is crazy for what it is going to be.
"Nice. Would be fun to open it up on the Autobahn. Also, I‚Äôm a huge bundesliga fan, since we lack decent football in the states. My family is originally from Germany and it‚Äôs the first trip I‚Äôm going to make once the world opens again."
"Yeah I think $5k is a fair price since it sticks with the car. $10k is reasonable IF FSD were to stay with the account. 

Otherwise I'll take a subscription for $100 a month or so. That would be worth it to me, and you could turn it on and off depending on your needs."
"Hah, agreed! Gotta leave the poor Tesla at home then, what a shame üòÜ"
"And I don't think any Model 3 on the road today or the next year will get to the point of being driverless or a robotaxi. However, if it did that wouldn't justify a large price tag either, there would need to be a consumer version vs. a commercial one."
That's definitely better than that yellow snow!
Where‚Äôs this?
What tires you have?
It‚Äôs so dam coo!
The White Model 3 is incredibly photogenic.
Beautiful!
Wow!
"Looks like a Cali plate, maybe up in the sierras?

Edit: would love a high res pic for my desktop!"
Woulda been cool to see a red tesla with red snow
A Tesla is cool even in Death Valley.
"LOL. Came to say just this.

White snow seems redundant. üòÑ"
This karma whore ain‚Äôt gonna knowüòÇ
yeahÔºÅthat is so cool to be your desktopÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
lolÔºåi can do it with PS
"I just got one last week and I‚Äôm still shocked at how amazing and just.. modern it is. All the tech feels so futuristic, congrats!"
"I like how stereotypically Canadian that garage is with the hockey jersey, snow board, zebra stripes, pads, flags, etc. What, no Molson mirrored sign on the wall?

Oh, nice car btw. What are you trading up from?"
Grrr. I ordered DAY ONE and still haven't even got a delivery date. And I'm in the same state as the damn factory!
I can‚Äôt wait for my black 2021!
Congrats!
Congratulations!
Canada seems to higher prio than domestic orders.
Congrats man !!! Love the midnight silver metallic :D
Nice whip ü§ôüèΩ
Are the wheels under the hub caps the same as the older model?
Couldn't be happier for you! Welcome to the family!
I want one sooooo bad. I can def afford one but I enjoy no car payment.
Location and configuration?
why couldnt you be happier?
Sell me your mirrors.
Ayyy welcome to the Vancouver Tesla fam üëãüèª
Is the top of the trunk now covered or still showing metal?
When did Tesla start giving the cars a year different than when it was built.  As long as I've known they are just the build year.
is this color lighter than the grey they sold previously? I bought mine in 2019 and it looks kinda darker
Wow those new aero caps are great
Do you have a picture of the rims under the aero covers?
And you named it what?  Inquiring minds want to know!
DoEs iT hAvE a HeAteD SteErInG wHeEl?!
Broke your cherry?  grow the fuck up you sexist asshat
I couldn‚Äôt agree more! Congratulations to you too!!
"6 months in, I feel the same"
"I've been a bit unlucky with other drivers out here and had to get a rental while mine was in a body shop, going back to an ICE car that is trying to look ""techy"" is so annoying. I never realized how much I didn't miss the mess of buttons everywhere until I no longer had them."
My Dad broke it playing darts. I guess just as Canadian right?
"They deliver those last, they are trying to pump up their 4th quarter numbers so it would make sense to deliver to the furthest locations first since they take the longest for transport. I'm pretty sure you'll definitely get it before the end of the quarter but remember that Tesla has to do what's best for their shareholders as a publicly traded company and by delivering to the East coast 1st they are maximizing the amount of vehicles they can deliver by the end of the year."
Do you mean when they unveiled the og car or the facelift?
Did you order a grey SR+? because that seems to be what they're cranking out first.
"Production for the first half of every quarter goes to foreign markets... that's why you see some many ""I ordered during the second week of October and have to wait until Christmas for delivery!!"" posts.

Once they start filling domestic orders, they _generally_ start on the east coast and move west.

My M3 was ordered end of July... got it Sept 19 (Q3 ends Sept 30) -- San Diego here."
They build by region. They do US cars later in the quarter because they can deliver them faster.
"British Columbia, Canada. Got the SR+ RWD"
Happy meter pegged.
Cheers Mate!! üçª
"From what I can tell, it‚Äôs darker."
"Probably ""Tessie"", possibly the most original name among Tesla's."
Donald. After the greatest president America has ever seen.
"lol

WhY dOEsN‚ÄôT iT hAvE ReAr hEATed seATs??? oR caRpeTs???"
Lol you‚Äôve clearly never heard of a figure of speech. Relax dude.
Found the virgin
What a weird thing to get mad about
"Don't worry, I just notified the police that someone on the internet is offended, they said they're sending out as many patrol cars as possible, sit tight and let the pros do their job."
it is kinda a gross phrase
2 years in and I feel the same
Classic.
I ordered mines September 30th and I still have not got an update at all -_-  I live in Massachusetts. According to your opinion I should been received a Tesla being the I‚Äôm on the east coast. The wait painful lol
"Aah. No, black long-range."
"How long ago did you order? I ordered in BC as well and was wondering how the insurance works? Do I sign up for it during pick up or will I get more information beforehand?

Sweet ride! Hope you enjoy it."
Hopefully picking mine up soon too üëå
Greatest loser lol
"When I order mine, I'll be sure to order the heated carpets!"
Rear Seats are heated.  At least in the LR they are.
You clearly never matured past 5th grade.
The internet is so crazy
I‚Äôm picking up mine in Vancouver this Sunday. An auto plan broker is on site. You don‚Äôt need to worry about anything beforehand. The insurance ain‚Äôt as bad (price wise) as I thought it was going to be.
I‚Äôd highly recommend looking into Stratford Underwriting for your collision/comprehensive/replacement cost insurance on the Tesla in BC. I saved $1400 over what it would have cost with ICBC. You can buy it over the phone with certain brokers.
ooo that‚Äôll be a game changer
Yeah OP got SR+ which is why I commented that. That was a common question a year ago when they took out rear heated seats for good on the SR+ trim.
And you have clearly never left your mom‚Äôs basement Mr. Keyboard-Warrior
Ahh okay thanks for the info! Enjoy the ride!
How much are you paying for yours?
Absolutely listen to this advice. My basic ICBC + optional ended up being approx 135 with Stratford compared compared to 195 strictly with ICBC for the same coverage.
Oh I checked their site and see that they‚Äôre partnered with my current ICBC insurance broker. I‚Äôm pretty new to this so does Stratford basically replace whatever car insurance I have right now?
Yes for everything but the $200k mandatory liability (you still have to get that through icbc)
"Be warned, I test drove and purchased one two weeks later. Had no actual intentions in the slightest of buying when I test drove. I was just bored lolü§£"
NGL but the white paint looks great without the chrome
it's got the old sport wheels
"I know this is crazy but i actually bought one before I even test drove it. When i finally did drive it, i was happy i hadnt driven one before."
Is this normal? https://i.imgur.com/yOMJzVi.jpg
"Were you able to adjust the strength of the regen braking? If not, did you notice it? I'm a little worried about how they removed adjustable regen for 2021."
Nice! What did you think? Also why so much grease/water on the console?
"Be still, my heart. It‚Äôs so beautiful."
"This is cool, my wife and I are test driving tomorrow at noon EST in VA. Glad to hear they just let you take it for 30ish minutes. Hope I get the same type of treatment.

Questions: Did they try to sell you when you got back? I saw a mention of other rates different that what‚Äôs online, so I assume they might have a better deal at the actual dealer as far as financing?

Thanks for sharing."
I'm sad that there are no examples of the white interior on the refresh.
How long did they let you take it for/how did the process go? I‚Äôve been trying to book a test drive through Calgary but have yet to hear a response lol
Is it me or does the frunk look like it‚Äôs missing something? Thought there was a donut thing on the inside frunk to keep moisture/water out?
Thanks for posting pics! I was wondering if there was a light inside the console!
"Hello fellow Vancouverite! I also test drove that same route and it sold me on the spot, too. Just took delivery of my blue SR+. It‚Äôs definitely a much nicer purchasing experience than with ICE."
What is the bluish thing in the boot??
I‚Äôm gonna assume it was the park Royal location based on cypress in the pics?
Did they ever upgrade the backup camera to make it as good as the model s?
SR+ or LR?
That would jeopardize my 2019 Model 3 if I test drove the 2021
How'd you like it?
refresh? no refresh. the fascia of the model S was a refresh. this is just the latest model 3
Personal opinion: the new rims looks awful
Yes. I am having that feeling now. I am in no rush buy but I could easily just purchase now after having so much fun in the test drive. I literally had a smile so big the whole time that my cheeks started to hurt. Have driven a few higher end cars and didn't have as much fun as this 30min drive.
"I had a friend visit me (SF) from Tampa. Was driving around in my mod3l and all he talked about was buying the new Vette. I asked him if he wanted to drive my mod3l. Said no he wasn‚Äôt interested. At the end of his trip I finally convinced him to drive it. Within 5 minutes, he pulled over and looked me in the face and said,‚Äùfuck the vette, I‚Äôm getting one of these‚Äù a month later his arrived. Same time they were offering 5000 miles for referrals LOL."
Stop tryna flex ur money
"Same. I was against the chrome delete at first, but now I like it. Not sure I like it more than the chrome, but it isn‚Äôt a deterrent like I thought it would be."
"I disagree, I'm a fan of the chrome and the refresh looks ""cheap"" to me."
I was told they put winter tires on it so I guess they picked the wheel in stock already.
And the wheel caps for the Aeros in the trunk.  ROFL.
yeah thought those were gone
Damn I was about to say those look so much better than the stock pics.
"Honestly the new wheels are almost a dealbreaker for me. I‚Äôve been thinking about getting Model 3 #2 and I just can‚Äôt get past the new wheels, both sport and aero :("
I thought those were the old wheels.  I kept looking at them.
How can you tell the difference? I can't find any info online.
"Is Tesla quality truly as bad as they say. People are down voting me for asking this question however i am a TSLA fan and shareholder but when you get consumer reports saying this i think its a legitimate question, it is not an accusation on my part, just a question.


https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-slides-to-bottom-of-consumer-reports-reliability-survey-11605816647"
Not crazy at all and very common I hear. I only test drove it to keep my obsession under control. Now I am more obsessed.
First time we sat in a Tesla was the day we picked up our M3  :D
"I test-drove the AWD LR for 2 days and thought it was so fast, and it is. This was without acceleration boost. Then I bought the P3D- sight-unseen and WOW. I'm still in love."
"If you left your used floss in the center console, yes."
Test driver so dirt from people I'm guessing
I read Regen is always on. You can adjust braking. Hold and creep
Water and sanitizer. It was raining out and they wiped all surfaces before I got in with sanitizer. It had not dried yet.
Yes it is eye candy for sure
They didn't push anything. It was insanely casual and relaxing. She asked if I had any questions. I had some tax questions and rebate questions. I asked about colors as getting a color other than white here just puts me in luxury tax add on range unfortunately. I was the one asking what the current best rates are. She ran the numbers in about 2 mins but said just let me know if you have any questions over the next couple days. The only slight pressure may have been them mentioning the ev rebate may run out. I think they were reading me well and made me feel very comfortable.
"They are out there, in this sub even. Don't have a link handy."
I booked it online. 30in drive. Uploaded my driver's license and signed online agreement. Went in store only to ask questions which I only had a few because reddit has all the information I need.   Did drive on my own. Very casual and zero pressure. Was an amazing experience compared to ICE test drives which are stressful because they want to make the sale that day. My area was showing interest rates of 2.5% for 96months and 2.15% for 72 months which is better than website.
Yep there is a rubber seal around the trunk.
Awesome question. A light in both console compartment for SR+.
Mountain is the perfect test drive.
Aero wheel covers in boot (trunk). Winter tires were on so they used the winter tire package which comes with sport wheels.
Yep. Good eye.
The quality seemed pretty good. Not sure about upgrades though
SR+
There is a high risk ha
"I just use the term refresh because it meshes with all posts online about the 2021 model. Changes include heat pump, new console, wireless phone charger, black satin trim, metal scroll wheels, updated aero wheels, usb stick in glove box for sentry/dashcam, power trunk, door icons on door switches, extended range."
But those are the old rims on the car ü§î
I would get aero wheels
"I literally had that same smile/laugh. They let me out own my own and said just have it back in like 30-45min haha. That being said, I have a pre refresh M3 LR AWD. Not a single regret purchasing it. Absolutely love it"
I‚Äôve had one for over 2 years now. The smile doesn‚Äôt go away. It‚Äôs incredible. You‚Äôll love it. And with the updates it will feel like a slightly new car every few months.
Don't drive a p3 üòÅ
"Warning, that Tesla smile will not go away."
"This is how it all begins. This is the way.

A test-drive in 2018 is what completely sold me on Tesla. I waited two years and bought a P3D-. My girlfriend (who had no intention to buy a Tesla) then bought a LR AWD MSM. She LOVES it. What convinced her? My Tesla. :)

The sad thing is that I don't get to drive enough, so I'm thinking about selling it and putting all that money into TSLA stock (if it comes down). If it keeps going up, that's a good thing too since I have some shares.

In any event, Teslas are awesome and the company's best days are ahead.

For those who cannot get a test-drive from Tesla, consider renting a Tesla from a real owner on Turo dot com. You can drive the car for 1-2 days or even a week. Live with it. Park in your space. Experience Supercharging. This is the best way to really test a car in my view, though my girlfriend was fortunate to be able to test-drive two Teslas at a local test-drive event."
5000 miles is 8046.72 km
Hahaha that‚Äôs awesome!
I have a similar story but my friend went with the stingray. It was his father's car and my m3 couldn't beat nostalgia.
"LOL, great story. :)"
lol that was not the intent of the comment at all. I was getting across how addicting the vehicle is. People always make comments like ‚Äúdamn [insert cheesy money comment about how rich I must be]‚Äù. Like I didn‚Äôt go and purchase the thing outright. I went and got a loan just like people do for any other vehicle out there and will be paying for it over the next few years of my life. Let‚Äôs think a little
Imagine getting butthurt about people purchasing cars..... in that car's subreddit
Looks better every time I see it
I agree. Also the center console looks cheap. I have the 2020 and I like the piano black despite obvious downsides of scratches etc. Also no cover for the phone cradle?
In trunk because they needed to out winter tires on it. Also probably trying to up sell people.
Oh that's what that is? Looked like some sort of pop-up tent. I wonder why they wouldn't put it in the subtrunk to keep them from sliding around.
I have read a lot of the bugs have been worked out since launching. And if they do have problems people say the service usually covers it.
It‚Äôs as badass as they say
Are you asking a question without question marks? Why would you do this?
"Not in my experience. Got one in July and zero issues. The S and X are prone to problems, but I think they've ironed out most of the kinks in the 3"
same!
It‚Äôs where the trash goes right? üòÇ
This is not the first case of floss in a Model 3... remember that used Tesla yamaka (sorry Jewish people I don‚Äôt know how to spell this) and floss story?
"Ah ok, I thought it‚Äôs a wire lol"
"I wonder why?

Don‚Äôt forget roll."
"I know, that's why I asked about it"
"Ah good call, thanks!"
And I ordered a M3 Performance in Red to arrive between Dec 12-31. Fucking stoked broskies.
"That‚Äôs awesome. We are going to supposedly test drive an LR and they offered a Y to test drive. Really I‚Äôm in the market for a M3 Performance which they didn‚Äôt have to drive. No biggie, I‚Äôll get a feel with whatever they have.

If they have better financing than the website, maybe we do decide on a purchase sooner than we figured."
I'm on here quite frequently and have not seen any . If u can point me to one I would be thankful
Thanks for the fast response! I‚Äôve yet to look at what I could get approved for but damn I might have to pull the trigger soon if it‚Äôs similar to that - I‚Äôve been juggling that possibility or just buying cash outright next spring (2022). I‚Äôll try to get in touch with Calgary again to hopefully book a test drive! Thanks mate.
"Awesome, I‚Äôll go check it out. Was it your first time driving a Tesla/EV?"
"super cool, sorry i came off as standoffish"
Yes older winter tire package
"ikr, they just wrote down the info of my driver license and gave me the card to go test drive on my own for 45 mins."
Do they lock it in chill mode or do you get to have the full experience? I bought mine without test driving.
same I just bid two years and driving to places is my favorite parts of the day.  Still detail it and treat it like new.
"LOL. Right? I thought the LR AWD was fast. I bought a P3D- never having driven one, and WOW it's fast. 0-60 in 3.1 seconds for the refresh, which is fast as a Ferrari Enzo."
You‚Äôre the best bot I‚Äôve ever seen quite frankly
Good bot
Good bot
Ya your comment is pretty bang on. One of my worries currently is that people will judge me as a person with bags of money which probably comes from the fact that the first Tesla's were very expensive due to volumes and technology maturity. I just say it is the cheapest one they make and I tell them I made a large spreadsheet showing it saves me money in the long term compared to an ICE. I did my homework and it make the most sense for me. And it is insanely fun to drive and gets better every month with h updates.
lol
"Love the piano black!

I think the vocal minority doesn't understand how many of us are out here."
Nope - that goes in the door compartment so when you go to the gas station you can empty... oh... wait a second...
"I think it might help with he range estimates. The EPA test is conducted in a ""default configuration"" without any software options adjusted. Just whatever standard mode the car is in when it starts."
Hold is the only way to go!
The regen was slightly noticable compared to my gas car but after about 5 mins I had gotten used to it and already started taking my foot off the gas early to slow down. I am used to driving a manual transmission so it came pretty easy to me like down shifting. When I get mine I plan to challenge myself to never use the brakes.
No problem.
With all the world uncertainty the rates seem to be good for now.
"Would recommend outside financing, your local credit union would likely have better rates (obviously YMMV)"

Yes first time driving EV and Tesla. I have been a passenger in a few. Better than everything I have read.
No worries. Just wanted to share ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I think that‚Äôs cause of Covid. Normally I think they‚Äôd drive with you and teach you how to use the car. But I honestly prefer being left to my own devices. It makes it that much more of an experience
"From my experience with test drives, they encourage pushing the car and feeling the great acceleration (on roads where it's safe to do so of course)."
No the one I was in was in normal mode
"Chill mode would totally defeat the point of a test-drive. They don't do this. If you're driving a Performance, you have the full power to experience and sell you on these beasts. :D"

"Oh shit you‚Äôve got the spreadsheets. You‚Äôll definitely be getting oneüòÇbut yea like M3s are relatively cheap for what you‚Äôre getting. Like any other new 2020 vehicle that‚Äôs not a civic or Camry can easily get into the price range of a Tesla. It‚Äôs not like M3s are $100,000 or anything, but people seem to think they are in that range

And so what? Let people think you‚Äôre loaded haha"
"Agree! I‚Äôve seen so many people cover it up with this striped film and it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Also feel a lot of Tesla owners are pretty neat so maybe can‚Äôt stand the look of scratches/dust on the cover.

I do like the automated trunk but hardly a big makeover.."
"Okay, so just make default regen always on then. 

It probably has to do with it being easier to not give a setting in the first place that they would take away later. Why would they take it away and prefer regen always on? Less parts and service for brakes, and most people going into Model 3 might be new to EVs and would want to turn it to low because of not being used to regen and then complain about range."
Why
"If it was only slightly noticeable it must have been adjusted way down. I drive a manual and I remember  my test drive a couple years ago it was SUPER noticeable... Like holy shit , I left off the gas and suddenly I feel like I'm dragging a boat anchor behind me."
"I thought this too. It‚Äôs def worth looking around, but from my experience the financing option through Tesla is superb. I asked my credit union/big bank and they offered ~3.5% whereas Tesla got it down to 2.1%"
I saw that but it doesn't show the interior
Such great cars! You won‚Äôt regret buying one. Did a road trip across the country in mine in September and I wouldn‚Äôt do it in any other car
jellyyyyyy lol
 Nice.  Imagine my pleasant surprise having never been in one on delivery day.  I think it‚Äôs almost better that way.
Yes. It is amazing how easy other cars creep up in price from the MSRP.
Ya. This one is hard to judge. I think it was less than I expected but maybe the same thing would be more than others expect.
2.1 it's definitely not bad across board!
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCrm\_kz\_0YE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCrm_kz_0YE)
Did you do a road trip in SR+ or LR?
Even a Vanderhall with the right trim and options will cost as much as a Tesla.
"Interesting! 

On my test drive of a 2020 model, I could totally see myself using the regen. The drive was too short though and I never got to try it. 

I'll just have to find a 2021 model to test drive. Thanks so much for the feedback!"
"WhooAa it looks identical except white, crazy!"
Thanks !
Too bad it‚Äôs not from inside... I was curious if the white dash still reflects in the windows right where the side mirror is.
"SR+ sadly, but it was still very doable"
"Rent one from Turo. You can have 1 or 2 days with it, or a whole week. This is what I did. Best money I ever spent on any rental. Now I have a 2020 Tesla P3D-."
When I get my white on white next week ill post a video.
I am going for SR+ so I can get EV rebates
"That‚Äôs what I did, but I wish I got the LR. if you can, try and find a LR used on the Tesla site. They include FSD and on the AWD you also get the acceleration boost. They‚Äôre usually right around the price of a SR+ new."
Hot commodities hard to find. Good advice.
"True, but totally worth it if you can find one"
Will keep an eye out

Cool story bro
Dammit. I'm VIN 61k and missed both the double pane and auto dimming side mirrors.
Does anyone know if the Service centre can upgrade current cars with these new things?
Vin 74***
This makes me sad.i wish I waited a couple more months
Bummer. I just got mine and immediately hate the driver side mirror at night.
If anyone knows a upgrade cost please let us know here.
"Tesla advisor told me ours would have it. On delivery the delivery specialist said he wasn't sure if they did have it. One week after delivery, they now have it. High 63xxxx vin here . Pretty peeved."
"Thanks! No, same piano black console and charging station."
Oh man! My vin is 72xxx and I pickup in just over a week! Hope mine will have this!
This is the first improvement to the model Y that has me considering calling a service center and asking about part availability. I'm tired of being blinded on the highway at night. My previous car had autodimming mirrors and I took for granted how good they were.
"Sweet! Congratulations on the Car!!! 
Does it have the same console or the new Wireless Charger dock?"
How does auto dimming work? It makes the lights less bright at night?
"I wonder why they even bothered putting the non-dimming mirrors in the first place when the M3 has had them standard. They found 60k pairs of mirrors laying around and decided they could use them up on early adopter MY owners?  

Disclosure: Bitter early adopter here if it wasn‚Äôt obvious ü§£"
"Why does everyone feel the need to upgrade something if they don‚Äôt have it? Haven‚Äôt you learned yet that this is going to be common place with Tesla, updates will happen ALL of the time, and it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to upgrade just because a new feature or update comes out."
"We didn‚Äôt get it with VIN 68###, but the last OTA update upgraded them to dimming. Wahoo!

Edit: Guys... it was a joke. It‚Äôs not physically possible to update a mirror with a software update."
"Aw man. Time to upgrade! It's long overdue, I'm still rocking an old 2020 Model Y :("
Do the side mirrors also defrost?
Ordered my MY two weeks ago and am still waiting for a vin. I‚Äôm coming from an ‚Äò18 M3 LR RWD with the auto dimming side mirrors. This makes me so happy to hear. Thank you!
Dumb question: how can you tell if you have these?
Nice to see these on the Y now. Mine doesn‚Äôt have them and I knew it didn‚Äôt before I purchased. Surprised they didn‚Äôt have it for the price but also surprised it hasn‚Äôt bothered me not having it. Thought I‚Äôd miss the dining side mirrors... maybe one day I‚Äôll upgrade them if they start to bother me.
"I hate you... 

But seriously, congrats. These were something I wished our Y had (picking up tomorrow -Build date is 10/18). Since our winter lasts half the year and most of driving during that time is in the dark, these were a big bonus in our Model 3. Oh well, this is the price of earlier adoption with Tesla. Glad they finally added them :)"
I just like that sexy bevel on the sides
Kinda glad I don‚Äôt have these with 15% tint on my windows.
what do they do? auto fold?
I‚Äôm 65k and got these. Delivered last week in east coast!
Wondering the same too
I‚Äôm 69xxx and do not have... damn.
I miss my dimming side mirrors as well.  Oh well... next time.
"Quick note: you have added a comment to your post rather than replied to a comment. They may not see your reply

PS nice mirrors!!"
Mine didn't. 72xxx
Same piano black console and charger.
Is there a picture somewhere of the new vs the old? We are hoping to pick our Y up on Monday or Tuesday (we are scheduled for Wednesday - but are going OOT and our SA said it scheduled to get here early)
Yes :)
"Hey don‚Äôt feel bad, I got one of the model 3‚Äôs in the gap of 6 months that DID NOT have dimming mirrors. Also 2 months after I bought dropped the price 2K."
"Yep, that's exactly it.   Apparently MY is getting the M3 left overs, including the piano black consoles M3 will no longer use.   

Remember Elon said MY will share 70-80% of parts with M3?   He wasn't kidding."
"yep, keep telling yourself that you don't need these basic features found in similar class vehicles.

Just because you don't care for them, doesn't mean others shouldn't.   Stop telling people how they should feel."
Really? Interesting.
I have a 68### too I don't think I have that
Was that in the OTA notes? How did you know it was a software update?
The non dimming ones already defrost. It‚Äôs in the owner‚Äôs manual.
See how the glass has a slightly lighter frame around it? That‚Äôs the easiest way. The other ones don‚Äôt.
They auto dim...
I'm  65k and I pick mine up on the 20th. I hope i have them too.
What is the next digit of your VIN and the build date? Mine is 655XX and build was Oct 2020. I have the laminate front windows but I do not appear to have the side mirrors.
Build date?
Also wondering! Mostly for the dual pane windows. Anything to reduce the noise in the cabin.
Same
Thanks! Never posted before.
"thanks, I don't feel terrible about the purchase. I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat. it's a great vehicle that's fun to drive. 
I have 2xxx vin, so I got mine before the MY price cut too."
"Sorry I hurt your feelings. But if you continue to feel the way you, and others feel, you‚Äôll never be happy with your vehicle....or Tesla. You‚Äôll always feel cheated, and in turn will have to spend your OWN money, more than what YOU already paid, just to keep your vehicle up to the standards that change on a monthly basis, that you feel you need. You want to spend your own money to continually upgrade your vehicle so you feel that you have what everyone else has, go ahead. Or, just be happy with what you got and when the time comes to upgrade to a newer updated Tesla, then do it. If you plan on selling your vehicle later on, nobody is going to care if you put your own money into upgrading it, and the book value DEFINITELY won‚Äôt care. More or less, you won‚Äôt get any of that money you put into it, back. But hey, if you want to upgrade, go ahead! And if you aren‚Äôt happy getting basic features that should come in a similar vehicle, then why did you buy a Tesla? You knew what you were buying. Don‚Äôt stress over not getting the new upgrades, just be happy you got an amazing vehicle; one that is superb amongst other vehicles!"
Thanks!
"Thank you, build date is what matters, not vin. Vins are not signed sequentially."
Tint helps if you haven‚Äôt already
"No need to apologize, my feelings are not hurt.   Actually I should be apologizing.   You are trying to provide free consoling advice on how to live a happy life.   I completely missed that."
Got the VIN number on 11/11 don‚Äôt know if that is when the car was being built. The sticker in the door jamb just says 11/20.
"First thing I did but I didn‚Äôt think about the sound deadening qualities of tint, thanks."
Window tint or mirror tint?
"Yes, a happy life! :-) It‚Äôs bad enough it is how it is right now, we both know that. I‚Äôm a realist, and try to stay as positive as life will allow :-) Have an amazing day!"
I am encouraged that people can still be understanding and polite on the internets. Kudos to you both.
"I see where both of you guys are coming from. I liked the new taillights, dual pane glass. I got the door open buttons. Blah blah blah. 

Right

It's an endless upgrading car. Next come the 7 seats and better batteries! The sport boost package etc. 

Meanwhile I justified in my own head how great a lr awd with 19inch Gemini wheels are."
"Well screw ALL OF YOU!!!  Oh no, wait... This is pretty nice. ;)"
"I agree with the Gemini‚Äôs! I have a Model Y Performance on order (no VIN yet), and bought a set of Gemini‚Äôs with all weather tires just because the Gemini‚Äôs are growing on me. Those red brake calipers with the Gemini‚Äôs look gooooood :-)"
Screw you too buddy
"It's exactly what I did. My 21"" Uberturbines are sitting in the garage, I got a set of gemini's of a Model Y owner (found on Craigslist) who hated the look of them. I generally rock the gemini's without the hub caps but put them on for long road trips. The red brake callipers look nice behind the gemini's. I'm thinking about powder coating them black but probably won't."
"You my friend are doing exactly what I plan on doing....once I get my Model Y, haha"
"Your brave, there isn‚Äôt much charging down there."
"Wow, you are adventurous and thanks for pushing the boundaries of EV travel!!

It‚Äôs time for a super charger in terlingua üòä"
"Went there last year, it was the first national park me and my girlfriend went to during our 48 state road trip (started in NY). And charging is definitely scarce down there we stayed at the study butte campground to charge overnight"
Don't mind the West Texas dust
"it‚Äôs irking me that the bottom left half of the car is cut off, but love the mountains! (and the car)"
"No kidding, this was my first thought."
There are a few RV parks that have a NEMA 14-50 charger. We charged at BJ's RV and they only charged us $2.50 a day. Terlingua is a small enough town you can leave it charging overnight and walk to most of the airbnb places.
what did you do for charging? Marfa - then RV in the park?
"Nice, thanks for the tip! I live near San Antonio and chose to roadtrip somewhere else because I didn‚Äôt know how to figure out the logistics of charging in or near Big Bend."
No we actually came from the east so charged to full in Ft. Stockton then drove down and charged overnight at an RV park. We used BJ's RV who had a NEMA 14-50 and only charged us $2.50 a day.
"I'm in Southern California, I randomly logged into my account today after having ordered on Oct. 18th and noticed my account now had a delivery window of Nov. 6th - 12th. No texts or emails, it's just updated on my account screen.

I called the delivery center I had assigned and she verified my info and VIN, said she sees my cars coming on a transport on Sunday. They'll inspect it, detail it and have it for me by Tuesday. After I got off the phone my delivery info went to an appointment and I was able to buy the Tesla insurance.

I'll post follow-up pics of the updates if I'm the first one here to get a US refresh! Pretty stoked!

Edit: Oh and I put a 'ha!' next to payoff before you pick it up because she asked if I could transfer over the down payment. I said I'd transfer it at their office after I walk around the car and verify everything's in order."
"I just checked mine. Ordered M3, LR, Blue, on October 16th and have a delivery date of 11/21-12/19. Baltimore area, No vin yet."
No Way! Congrats!  When did you order and where are you located? Just saw you comment below...
"I'm in Dallas, and ordered on 10/10, and still have a range of November 15 - December 13 with no VIN. üò©"
"I‚Äôm in Vancouver, Canada .. just scheduled delivery for my blue SR+ on November 12."
Ordered white on white early morning of Oct 16th in FL and have a delivery range of Nov20-Dec10.
Ordered a performance model on the 9th of October with a range of nov 12 - dec 14 still have no vin or exact date
"I am in Denver, Colorado.  I ordered a 2020 M3 White on White Long Range October 14th.  I switched to the 2021 M3 with the same specs on October 16th, the morning they announced the updates.  My delivery window is November 18th-December 6th.  Hoping to get it sooner!!!!!"
Please post pics when you get yours! I wonder how the new sport rims will look like irl
Lucky. My delivery window is December 7-21. The wait is killing me.
"Thats awesome, congrats on getting one of the first refreshes. Would love to see pics, I ordered white as well, gotta wait until the end of December though."
How do you know it‚Äôs refresh
"I would be wary of its a refreshed model 3 or not. I‚Äôm still waiting for a Nov 17-Dec 17 delivery window, and Tesla twice has tried to auto assign me a vin to an existing model (not the new refresh), which then gives you a sooner delivery date. 

Just double check with your Tesla store/employee that it‚Äôs a proper refreshed VIN"
"We expect 10,000 photos and a hour long in-depth video overview...for science"
What trim did you get ?
"Does not uploading insurance affect the schedule and/or delays?  
I haven't settled on one yet."
I also saw an update on my order page with an estimated delivery of November 27 - December 18 today. It was blank before. I ordered Oct 23. I live in Austin TX and in Texas you pay before they ship your car so I'm guessing my delivery will be closer to the Dec 18 estimate.
How/where did you get Tesla‚Äôs insurance? Is it only in certain states? How are the rates compared to other agencies?
I ordered mine Oct 13th and still have Nov17-Dec15 as my range with no Vin. Just spoke to my advisor and she said to expect closer to the Dec side of that range. In Las Vegas
I heard they drive themselves back if you miss a payment
Can you clarify what you mean by ‚Äòrefresh‚Äô. Is it an updated design? How do you know?
"Good to know, I ordered on Oct 17th and still no change in my account. I guess California deliveries are higher priority."
"Delivery location? I ordered 10/9, Rocklin SC, nothing yet."
Does the refresh come with quality control as standard?
Does your mvpa say 2021
Lucky! Grats!
"I have a tentative Nov 25 delivery date.  Also ordered on Oct 18.  I‚Äôd be stoked also, upload pics soon as your able with all the refreshed items!"
When was your VIN assigned?
Rad!!!
Thanks for the heads up. I also have a model 3 on order in Texas and was expecting delivery late December/January and I saw your post and looked and I am now scheduled for nov 28- dec 17.  Would never have thought to look without seeing your post.
"Did you have a wider ""estimated delivery"" range when you had checked previously, and if so, what was it?"
I‚Äôm also in So Cal. Just ordered today. How‚Äôs the Tesla insurance quote compared to others? Or did you not check?
SoCal and ordered 4 days later... I better check my status.
"OP is lucky. M3 SR+ Blue, ordered 10/1, delivery window is 10/29-11/26. Midwest area. No updates for me yet. I figure it‚Äôs a geographic thing and they‚Äôll make their way out here eventually."
East coast too. Similar delivery window. No VIN yet either :(
I‚Äôm also curious what showroom you‚Äôre picking up from? I ordered mine on 10/24 and set to pick up from Carlsbad but no update on the website yet like you have.
That‚Äôs amazing!  When did you order?  How long after ordering did you receive a VIN?  I‚Äôm also I‚Äôm Vancouver
"I am also in Vancouver, ordered on Oct 8 and declined a 2020 model, told SA I am waiting for a refresh/2021 model. I ordered SR+ white/black int. Have not received a delivery date yet with an M VIN"
congrats! definitely benifiting by having fremont relatively close by
Hey I ordered a white on white with the same date with the same time frame. We might have the same cars coming in
I‚Äôm in Florida and I ordered a performance model 3 and my delivery range is the same too.
"I ordered a M3 LR the day after you (10/27) for SoCal delivery and my window was and still is showing 12/15-12/29. I hope they can pull it in closer, but we‚Äôll see."
Where are you and when did you order? My window starts earlier but ends later üôÉ
"SR+ white/black. I wonder what finish are the new Y/3 uberturbines, matte black? Probably going to get the wheels powder coated"
It does not
"My tesla rep told me uploading insurance CAN HELP getting a VIN assigned to you faster, but not effect delivery. So there‚Äôs that? :)"
It showed as a step you need to complete box. It had a blue button that said 'Get a quote on Tesla Insurance closer to delivery date'. Once I got a delivery date the button was clickable. I have a 100% clean record and was quoted at $137/mo. Seems fine. Geico has a deal w/ my credit union and they came in at $265/mo. for comparable coverage as Tesla.
Cali only I thonk
"Yes the car was minorly refreshed around Oct. 16th. You can see the full list here (click subtitles on): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cviPkzgOZwA&

Or a write-up about it: https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-refresh-first-looks-in-depth-video/"
"I had no idea to look for that, apparently yes: https://imgur.com/f02ldiJ"
"Thanks, been looking forward to getting one for a while now!"
"Will do, thanks, and good luck!"
What is your delivery location?
did you get AWD or Performance...those seem delayed.  I ordered AWD on the 22nd.  Scheduled Nov 26-Dec 24th...
"It didn't show anything, it just said 'We'll contact you as delivery gets closer'. Then today all of a sudden it says 'Estimated Delivery: Nov 6th - 12th'. I wasn't expecting to have to worry about getting the car for another month so I didn't even have financing ready ha! I was able to get approved over lunch luckily"
"$137/mo, all others were higher. I had 1 quote that was similar but I figured I'd go with Tesla for hopefully ease of mind"
Is Tesla insurance only offered in Cali? I can‚Äôt find it on the web page (Florida)
"Midwest too. Got my delivery window updated yesterday to nov16-22. Ordered early Oct too. Keep an eye out, maybe it'll get updated soon!"
"Yep, I have a VIN. I ordered back in July then deferred in late August and September/October .. the last deferral was after they confirmed the updates. So ready! My current car is nearly 20 years old."
Same. I ordered October 14th. No date range or VIN yet. :(
Fremont close to FL? lol
"In CA, ordered on 10/26."
"What colour powder coated ? Gun metal ? When you do make sure you send a pic, I have a black lr and with all the chime delete the silver wheels stick out crazy"
I wonder why I‚Äôve had a estimated delivery window since day one? I also placed an order on 10/18 and have had that window since the day I ordered
You can‚Äôt upload insurance unless you have a VIN. Can‚Äôt insure something that doesn‚Äôt really exist yet.
Ok thanks. I guess I was wondering how you knew that the one you are getting is a refreshed. Just based on the delivery or manufacturing date?
Now you know its official. Congrats ill be here on the east coast with hope its coming soon.
"Smart move not paying the deposit. Anything wrong they will keep your money and tell you it‚Äôs scheduled at a later service. At that service they tell you they are waiting for the part and it will be a couple of days and a few months later. You‚Äôre still waiting. 

So smart mind don‚Äôt take delivery unless the car is pristine. Tug on the side rubber seals to make sure they are properly installed."
I have the same deliver date. Ordered on the same day also. Still no vin though. Congrats also.
"Interesting, I only ordered on 11/1 but have been showing a Dec 13-31 estimated delivery window. Was sort of hoping you'd have had one and they were delivering early. Congrats!"
Do they begin the build without having the finance complete? . My advisor said he would have me set for a mid December delivery but I haven't completed the finance yet. Any info is appreciated
As far as I know (admitted limited knowledge) it‚Äôs only available in a few states.
What date in early October did you order?
He lives in Southern California
"I'm thinking matte black, or satin. I like the black wheels/tint with white paint"
"Sorry, should‚Äôve clarified that there was an option to upload existing insurance for an existing vehicle. Only was available in certain states."
"Some states allow you to upload proof that your other cars are insured, like CA. I thought it was weird too. I‚Äôm just living in their world. Lol."
"Good idea tugging on the seals, I've seen some people post drooping sealing which I def don't want to deal with"
Same hereüò¢
"I got a text from the bay area, a Tesla rep said he needs to fill in the finance. I told him I'm financing through a credit union and the amount I was putting down over text. Next time I logged into my account those items were filled in. So I'm thinking yes, they need financial placeholder. You can change anything up until you sign for the car."
Oct 4th
"I didn't realize they will let you see the car without paying everything off. They have always led me to believe, they won't even transport the car until you pay the balance with the transportation fee. Didn't they have that line in the purchase agreement?"
How long after your order did you get a vin? I ordered on the 13th
They seemed satisfied that I had my finance option (credit union) and down payment amount entered into the financials screen.
Ordered October 4th and assigned VIN Nov 5. When I ordered I got assigned something in inventory and rejected so not sure if that impacted anything...
"Yeah I was assigned a vehicle within an hour or placing my order because they had one on site, but was out of town for the week and unable to pick it up"
"Fake, A true r/wallstreetbets member comes out with debt. 



Jk OP, Congrats!"
Sir this is a Wendy‚Äôs
Welcome to team gray!
doesn't BC give out an incentive if you buy an electric car in that province? im asking cuz I need a tesla and thinking of moving back to BC...
Positions or ban
Nice after that NIO run just recently
"That's funny, I did the same thing! Grey model 3 partially funded by my sale of Nio stock."
I guess we know what you named your Tesla
Will try to say hi when we drive by you!lol

We all have our bag of debts too! Thanks fellow autist ‚úäüèª
"Sir, I am on aisle cleanup"
Thank you! I am just awestruck with its beauty üëçüèª
You mean MSM :)
Plus we get up to $350 towards the charger installation
We got 8K
Yup! 3k and it just got topped up as well
Noice
"Ya but really, it‚Äôs gray"
Got 10k
Or is it grey?
"Yea, but really, it's grey"
Whoa that‚Äôs awesome! Wish I could get one
"And thanks to Ford,  Tesla could not use the name Model E for the Model 3"
How did you know it originally had a Model T in there?
"My model Y is on its way, just was notified this morning. Can‚Äôt wait!"
[deleted]
"Nostalgic, AF."
And we are still waiting for Ford‚Äôs Model E electric car...
Asking the real questions
Great question. We found several rusty parts including a driveshaft in our basement when we bought the house. My father-in-law is a retired mechanic and he recognized the parts.  He‚Äôs 89 years old and worked on some old Model Ts when he was younger. Here‚Äôs a picture of him last year in his immaculately restored 1964 1/2 Ford Mustang covertable. https://i.imgur.com/Qyzvhwi.jpg
Congratulations! It‚Äôs definitely worth the wait.
"Sorry. Our house is in Tennessee. We used to live outside Detroit (Southfield, Farmington, etc.) when my wife worked at Ford‚Äôs in Dearborn, but that was several years ago.  Nice area."
Thanks.
"Which they called the Mach E, probably to differentiate from what is now associated with tesla's nomenclature. What a pain in the butt!"
"Wow! The parts were in the basement for that long? I guess. You could have bought the house in 1952 lol

Were any of the parts cool parts that went to a museum?"
"I bet they were pretty pissed that Tesla co opted the nomenclature. Would‚Äôve been cool to see the descendent of the model T be an electric vehicle from Ford. I hope all the car companies play catch up to Tesla in terms of technology and we have a better environment for all Elon‚Äôs work. Also, happy cake day!"
Nothing really fit for a museum. The driveshaft was the largest part. Others were smaller and very rusty. My father-in-law recognized them right away. We didn‚Äôt find anything cool like a radiator or steering wheel.
"Oh they were totally pissed. But they (ford) squandered the opportunity. Tesla deserves the Model E at this point. But that's ok. Everyone's ironically catching up to the roadster level tech when tesla is getting ready for their 4th platform

And thanks!"
"For those curious, these are from Hansshow for $550. They seem to be quite popular for their power frunk/trunk kit for the M3 and kick sensor for the MY trunk."
I think I‚Äôd actually use the frunk if I had this. Nice.
How difficult was it to install?
YouTuber Brian with I1 Tesla told me he has the power frunk for MY and will be uploading an installation video this week.
Did you take any pics of the install? Are the struts buried deep under the wiper cowl?
My problem is with the no power close as well. The front hood is seems easy to dent.
Should be a stock feature. Maybe it will be an option one day
"Should be standard (especially since hood is semi-sensitive to the touch), but awesome mod. Nice work!"
Did you order and install the M3 version? I just checked the Hansshow site and didn't see a MY option. Thanks.
Now that is an awesome mod. A little surprised that isn‚Äôt there to begin with.
"I‚Äôd be happy if my frunk didn‚Äôt have a sensor problem. Got the car and had to wait a month and a half for my service date to fix it. I‚Äôm actually going in to drop it off today. Very cool install though, nice work!"
"Is this legal? Are there any certifications required, at least in theory?"
Niceeee
"The Hanshow apparently has issues and the model Y is slightly different over the 3.

Teslaoffer.com is apparently the one you want. Are videos on YouTube people removing the hanshow for theirs... just an fyi"
Thanks for the info! This is great! Could plz let us know if you followed any installation video or manual or so? TIA
Did you do the kick sensor? How hard was that to install?
Anything to prevent accidental opening while moving?
Exactly why I installed it! I was always too irritated with how difficult it is to close.
"Moderately difficult. Definitely need the right tools, specifically a panel pry bar for the struts. The ones on they Y are recessed in the frunk as opposed to exposed in the Model 3, which makes unclipping them very difficult. Nothing a little bit of perseverence can't handle. The rest of the install after that was a breeze."
"Yeah, struts are under the wiper cowl on either side. It's easy to get access, nearly impossible to remove the struts. I almost lost a few tools...."
"Yep, mine was dimpled on delivery and even the owner's manual says this may happen if you don't use the two hand press to close.  Chinciest part of the Y build imo."
"It is a power close though. If we‚Äôre talking about the same power frunk in the M3 mod then the entire latch assembly is replaced. It‚Äôs not using the existing latch assembly. So once the powered struts pull the frunk down to the latch, the latch then grabs the frunk and closes it the rest of the remaining inches."
"There is a MY option, but it's buried with the kick sensor accessory. So go to that product page and there's a drop down where you can select power frunk only."
"$200 per car adds up quick. $200 here, $200 there, it‚Äôs now a 70k car"
"I‚Äôm in the same boat. Picked up with the frunk sensor already going off, first sC appt said they fixed it. Now second one they ordered a part and I dropped it off earlier this week. I look forward to my 65k car not having a ‚Äòcheck engine light‚Äô thing annoying me :("

"Yeah, this was the worst part. No videos and a single double sided paper for the instructions... There was a lot of guess work to say the least. Maybe I should make a video?"
"Nope, didn't install the kick sensor. From what I've read and seen in video, taking apart the trunk is very involved. Apparently the clips are quite easy to break."
"Man, just thinking about that give me PTSD. I've broken countless trim and panel clips on my cars I've modified in the past..."
"Check to see if the dimple goes away when your hood is opened up. This was my case! What's happening is the lock for the latch is pulling down too much on the hood and warping a small dent into it. Took it to service and they raised that part up a couple mm and it's completely fixed now for me, no more dent!"
Ahhh. Didn't watch the entire video. What I get.  This would make the frunk way better. Does the key fob work to open the frunk ?
I‚Äôm here right now and can already feel the no loaners talk coming
Please make a video
"What about the M3 videos?  Do they help?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCjFqDl5efY"
Yeah the SC fixed it for me soon after delivery with other minor fixes - I THINK that's what they did?
"It works any way you can open the frunk. So through the app, key fob or on the touch screen. The only thing is that when you want to touch to close the frunk, the app and touchscreen button say ""Open"", when it should say close. I don't mind because the animations make it clear. Also, the third party controller is aware of the open/close state, so it's never confused as to whether it should be opening or closing the frunk."
I told them my commute is 40miles each way so...I need a loaner or to reschedule the appt when a loaner is available.
haha one of those days when you go to Costco to ‚Äújust get milk‚Äù and walk out with a 65 inch TV...
Was literally loading our car at Sam‚Äôs club today unfortunately no Costco near us :( and the wife asked if the model y was going to fit all the impulse shopping we do. Looks like it will!
With milk to boot
Is anyone surprised that a crossover SUV fits a tv? Isn‚Äôt this the point of crossovers?
Don't lay your flat screen on its side. One bad bump and it'll crack.
Yes! I will upvote every photo of the ‚Äúwhat can I fit in my Model Y‚Äù series. :)
You forgot to mention the milk and Splenda.
"Super useful information, thanks!"
Hah! I was actually wondering. We need a new 65in TV. Thx!
65???  Come on.  You can go bigger. üòÇ
"What make is the cargo mat, and how do you like it?"
Damn.   I couldn‚Äôt fit my 70 inch one in my model x :(
Hah. Saw an earlier thread about this. I picked up a tcl 65 for 239 and wondered the same thing.
"I fit 12‚Äô PVC in my Model Y, closed the hatch too :)"
I got the same cover for the trunk
Costco!!!!!!
"Obviously from Costco so I‚Äôll just pass on that I recently discovered that the [organic milk from Costco when lab tested was more like conventional milk](https://youtu.be/YVp56gWqEXM) because it‚Äôs from an organic farm that‚Äôs been hit with violations in the past. The worst part is that it‚Äôs not even cheap compared to other stores. Both Whole Foods and Trader Joe‚Äôs have better pricing on organic milk, especially if you buy the gallon jugs."
Aren't these specifically not supposed to be laid flat
"Went to Costco today. Bought a Christmas tree.
Went to put it in my husbands Kia. It didn‚Äôt fit. Had to return Christmas tree.

My daughter and I were both like ‚ÄúIT WOULD HAVE FIT IN THE Y!‚Äù (Which is being delivered next week)"
Return that Samsung garbage.
Model 3 does too
aren‚Äôt people buying like 85‚Äù TV nowadays ha
i got is for $479... this is was a good deal.
When you tell the wife you‚Äôre going to pick up milk.
Milk in the boot
"I'm just imagine the design pitch meeting now:

1: ""Ok, so you need to transport a TV. Obviously the TV won't fit your Camry, so what do you do? Pay hefty delivery fees? No sir! With that in mind I've raised it up, added a hatch back, and expanded the storage area. You can fit a 65"" flat screen in there now!""

2: ""Great, but what else can you fit in there?"".

1: ""I mean I suppose you could fit another TV on top. Maybe even a third.""

2: "" Other than TVs what else can it carry?""

1: ""Other... than...TVs?...? Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... Milk. It can carry milk. Also some Splenda...."""
lol... the point is how big it can fit.
I‚Äôve never been more scared then when I brought my LG OLED home from Costco. Those panels are so thin and all glass edge to edge.
ü§£
welcome
Will a 75‚Äù fit if it was lifted at an angle?
"Yes, I was wondering the same thing!  I just picked up my MY yesterday and looking for something for the back."
"its tesmania, I neither like or hate it... Its cheap and good."
"I just picked up the 65"" black Friday deal too and was wondering in the Y could handle it, so thanks for this"
lol someone had a bad experience. I love samsung screen
Thats is super nice
"It‚Äôs cheap but you‚Äôre better off not buying just by brand like this, that TV isn‚Äôt a good quality panel. Something like a TCL 6 series will run circles around that Samsung. That TV has mediocre contrast and brightness and because Samsung refuses to pay for licensing it doesn‚Äôt have any support for Dolby Vision which is the most common format for HDR streaming.

[This TV](https://www.wired.com/review/tcl-6-series-2020/) is Wired‚Äôs favorite and also my recommendation for a decent affordable 65‚Äù TV. You get excellent local dimming with the mini led backlight, excellent colors with the quantum dots and support for Dolby Vision. Way better choice and if you ran these side by side the Samsung would look like garbage. Even the 2019 and 2018 versions of the 6 series would look far better.

The 2020 version runs around $800 on sale but the 2019 and 2018 versions run much cheaper. Around $500-$600 when you find it on sale. No miniled but both are excellent."
"It‚Äôs a Samsung and no offense to OP, a TU7000. OLED or nothing."
Well was it or is it?
Have fun seeing ads.
Boot full of milk
Try hanging it yourself with your 13 yo son.  Haha.  Crapping my pants the whole time.
I think it‚Äôs Tesmanian. I like mine so far.
Ty üòâ
"No. It‚Äôs their ads and tracking shit. And well, LG OLED is miles better than Samsung‚Äôs QLED marketing bullshit."
This guys knows. I have a 2 year old TCL in my bedroom and a C6 in my living room. Couldn't be happier. People wasting there money buying stuff for the name or not OLED
Been eyeing some OLEDs maybe next year
"There are a few damn good LEDs out there. Sony‚Äôs high end, but generally it‚Äôs OLED and everything else and it‚Äôs not close. For a living room TV I‚Äôm looking for the biggest bang for my buck."
I got a broken pixel from playing ffviir on my oled.     So I disagree.
Milk til you boot.
"A broken pixel can happen on any TV though. QLED, LED, or OLED."
Congrats man. That‚Äôs a sick color.
"Update: I drove it for the first time tonight (my wife drove it home from the delivery center). I‚Äôm a former semi-pro racing driver and have done car stunts for Hollywood films in the past. So I‚Äôve driven a lot of cars, Vipers, 911 turbos, Lamborghinis, you name it.
OMG I was not expecting this. This car is scary fast. The electric power delivery is absolutely ridiculous in how instant and immediate the acceleration is, and just how linear it is. You plant the gas and it stops being a car and becomes the Millennium Falcon entering hyperspace. I‚Äôm in awe of this thing, easily the most impressive car I‚Äôve owned from a performance standpoint before you even start adding in everything else amazing about. I tried the FSD beta tonight too, and it‚Äôs incredible how far ahead Tesla is. Just wow."
My boy has the same car. Congrats.
"Wow.... wow.

Edit: just wanted you to know I came back a second day to say.... Wow.

:)

Just got my VIN today 755xx (same car in white). Hoping to get delivery by Thanksgiving but most likely after. I‚Äôm in Texas."
"Eee! So beautiful! I have the same on order, just no FSD. I fell in love with the red! I originally chose white interior but decided to switch to the black. I think both look great! I can‚Äôt wait to get my delivery date. ü§ûüèΩ"
Drop dead gorgeous!
"This is the EXACT build that I‚Äôm getting too....whenever I get my VIN and it gets delivered, haha. You have GREAT TASTE, and it looks amazing! I can‚Äôt wait to get mine!"
"Going to be ordering my Red MYP soon, can‚Äôt wait! Hopefully I get lucky with fit / finish also"
Gorgeous.  When did you put in the order?
"Looks sweet, congrats!

What is your VIN....? Also, did yours come w/ the double pane glass and/or the dimming mirrors....??"
"You've just convinced me on the red, but it'll be non-Premium or  FSD. May do the acceleration boost, stock is fast, another half second I think will do it. Can do FSD later, can't wait to hear what you think as you drive it."
Jesus man. Making me regret going black on black. That res is dang nice! Congrats!
Congrats!
Any cosmetic issues? I had over 20 on mine and they took it back to fix.
"Marina Del Rey Delivery Center?

And congrats! The red looks great and really don't see enough of them."
So jelly! Hope to be ordering mine soon!! Question: did it come with the new center console and USB in the glovebox?
OMG!   That looks amazing.   I'm trying to decide on Performance or not.  My concern is the increased chances of scuffing up the rims b/c lower tirewall.     Any issues with that on your end or anyone else with comments about this?
Thanks! We originally ordered a white one but decided to switch when we saw a red one in the wild.
"Thanks for the update. How is the body roll on turns? Also, were you able to check if the side mirrors are auto dimming?"
"I‚Äôve never driven a race car but I‚Äôve always wanted to! I do, however, ride a lot of roller coasters. One of my favorites is one called [Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point](https://youtu.be/PSOXYGT1-v4?t=2m26s) in Ohio.

It has lap bars and uses a hydraulic cable to launch you 120mph in just 4 seconds down a long track up a vertical 400ft tall top hat before you spiral straight down. It‚Äôs the most insane experience and is over in a flash. Everyone‚Äôs face looks like [Buzz and Woody at the end of Toy Story](https://images.app.goo.gl/nUDYvnP2smWaEj4t7) when they‚Äôre trying to catch the moving truck. 

It‚Äôs extremely smooth and I have never experienced something as equally exhilarating... until I got in a Tesla. Every single time I get a thrill on the coaster and same for the car. The first time I drove a Tesla I thought I was actually on a launch coaster! I‚Äôll never forget that feeling of immediate, intense, unbridled acceleration. It‚Äôs so, so, so good. Damn. 

I think the model S is the most beautiful car ever made but I am saving for a model Y. It looks quite nice and the size is good. I‚Äôm still many years away from affording it but it will fit my 2 German shepherds better than other models. 

All this to say - enjoy your new ride! The red color is outstanding. The model Y is very popular around here (DC area) and many of my neighbors have it in black which is boring IMO. The red is the way to go!! Congrats my friend! :)"
"Haha, thanks! Hope you get yours soon!"
"We got ours pretty quickly, so hopefully yours is right around the corner!"
Me too (just not performance). When did you order? Still waiting for my VIN as well.
"Awesome username! When we ordered, it was estimated to take 5-8 weeks. We got our vin in 2.5 and the car in 3."
October 25th
"Very low in the 0740XX, yes on the double pane glass, I don‚Äôt know about the mirrors, how do I check?"
"The leading edge of the frunk lid was sitting too high on the driver's side, but they fixed it before we signed off on delivery. No other fit and finish issues. The paint was immaculate, panel gaps all well aligned, clean headliner, all the lights were aligned, no trim gaps or misalignments, no scratches or dings. The fit and finish were on par with the Audi Q5 we replaced with this. We had spent a lot of time watching checklist videos and reading other people's experiences, so we had prepared for the worse, but were pleasantly surprised with how perfect ours was. And as a bonus, ours even came with the FSD beta enabled."
"Yep, good eye!"
It has neither.
"It's just something you need to be aware of with a low profile tire. It has way better protection of the lip than my BRZ tS did (which had stretched tires from the factory.) 

Just don't scrub the wheel against the curb and be mindful of where the right side of your car is while parallel parking and you'll be fine. If you do curb them, you can use a fat sharpie to color in the scrubbed area."
Nice! Looks like the black interior as well. How are you liking it so far?
Sure hope I can slide in on that white build slot! Ha! Congratulations!!
Side mirrors are auto-dimming.
"Technically I ordered October 16th, but my order has been in since March....I delayed for that long, haha"
"I work there, so I have to show the love, haha. And that‚Äôs way quicker than what was estimated. Very nice! Well have fun :-)"
Not bad!
"Oh nice! 

I‚Äôm not sure on the mirrors as I haven‚Äôt seen them in person, but believe there is a clear glass edge as seen in this other Reddit post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/jtxl9j/model_y_has_auto_dimming_side_mirrors/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
Wow nice. I almost took delivery of mine with the same color and there so many issues. Interior was dirty. They took it back to make it right. I wish mine comes with the FSD beta.. That would be sick. I did pay for the full package. The MY is at a body shop now and they are going to detail the car as well.
"Thanks for commenting. Who knows, the changes may not come until next year."
"Impressed with the build quality (our only issue was the leading edge of the hood being slightly out of alignment, no other fit and finish issues) and the tech and drivetrain make our other cars feel like tractors in comparison. Absolutely amazing. The acceleration is just mind blowing."
Ha. I think I‚Äôm getting it! 3 weeks from order to scheduled delivery.
Thanks for the follow up üëçüèæ.
It has the dimming mirrors.
"That's so great to hear on the build quality... congrats!

Would you be down w/ sharing your VIN range with us?"
"No way! Congratulations, but super jealous. 10/15 MYP order, still waiting on a VIN..."
0740XX
"Hey I ordered 10/22 no VIN, you hear anything yet?"
"Killer VIN, with all the new goodies!"
"Through a weird series of events, I took delivery yesterday. 72,XXX VIN, 11/8 build. Double pane windows, no auto dim side mirrors, no thumb drive in the glove box. Fantastic build quality, I‚Äôm extremely satisfied"
"I was taking it into the bodyshop to repair minor damage to the rear end when a deer jumped in front of me at 70. No time to break, I thought it was coming through the windshield but it flew into the other lane.

Any guesses if it's repairable?"
"Two questions... 
 
1. AP? 

2. Who won?"
Was it caught on cam?
"Break, brake, broke. Bummer dude."
"Airbags deployed? Damn, that looks painful. Hope you are okay!"
Dash cam caught it?
Do you want panel gaps? Because this is how you get panel gaps!
F
"Tesla automatic emergency braking would not have been triggered? Or was it too quick, even for the sensors?"
My wife would call me and say it should buff right out.
Deer are normally too soft and light to cause any frame damage. Also the point of impact is high which won‚Äôt have frame damage just a messed up frunk. It‚Äôll be 12-20k of damage. They prob total at 50% of value plus.
Airbags not deploying is real real suspect. I would tweet elon. My dad hit a bear up in that area in a tacoma going 40 and all bags deployed. Fucking destroyed his whole front end.
Pain in my heart. üò¢
Looks like Flagstaff. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm from.
I‚Äôm so sorry. My MY just got struck by a car running a red light.
"Honestly the car looks like it held up pretty well. I've seen cars in a lot worse condition after hitting a deer, especially at that speed."
at least you have enough deer meat to last the winter! glad you're okay
God damn forest rats.  I hit one going 85 so I feel your pain.
Honestly this is something I‚Äôm always a little nervous about when driving through smaller highways up in northern CA. Glad you‚Äôre ok!
"First and foremost I hope y‚Äôall are ok. A deer ended our 15 year old Subaru a couple years ago and no airbags deployed for us either. In that case it was a total b/c the car was only worth $5K or so. I‚Äôd imagine, since this is a much newer, much more valuable car, insurance will cover it. Hoping it‚Äôs mostly panel and no frame damage."
Ugh. That sucks!
"Ho Lee Fuk!   So sorry to see this.

Hopefully you don't experience any post accident nerve pain that you mentioned.  Again, really sorry this happened. üòï"
You are lucky to be alive and unhurt. I had a good friend hit a moose in Vermont and he broke his neck. He only survived be cause the car was so big and the moose pinned his broken neck in place.
üíî
Very glad that you are safe! Super weird the camera didn‚Äôt record anything. I have heard lots of stories about when Teslas are involved in incidents they conveniently don‚Äôt record just that snippet.
Obligatory it'll buff out
Rub some bacon on it.
Wow. How the deer fair? Worse than the car i bet.
You should see the other guy.
Try putting it in rice.
"This happened to me in May at 40 MPH with less than two weeks on the car. Can't seem to post a pic but very similar damage. Cost to repair just over $21K. Took 2 months due to Freemont (re)starting up and no parts we available, shipping was fubar due to toilet paper deliveries. Shorted me one fender but sent two bumpers.

No structural damage, just soft bits. Looks better now insofar as panel gaps and paint, etc. are concerned. 5 days to hand assemble and finish instead of 5 minutes on a line. Everything works fine. The sensor testing protocol is rigorous and takes a day by itself plugged into a computer checking everything. Insurance went up, but possibly due to deer population explosion in my area and so many strikes happening, several per week in the police blotter.

It was like watching a movie. Deer running out of hedges then deer somersaulting through the air. Barely heard or felt anything. Didn't know there was damage until I drove under a streetlight and saw the hood popped up. No alerts before or after which surprised me because all the parking sensors were knocked out."
"Was it a Buck?

Because Fuuuuuuuuck..."
"Just curious - mileage when this happened?  My first car was a Ford Tempo (many many years ago) and exact same thing with like 480 miles on it.  Unfortunately, it was NOT totaled, they fixed it...and it would give me problems for the rest of its life.  Hope you fare better!"
"FWIW I‚Äôd try to push hard for it to be totaled, quickly, so you can hop back in line and hopefully get a new one by 12/31. This stuff goes as a comprehensive claim I believe, which I don‚Äôt believe affects premiums going forward."
Oh shit
Bet it‚Äôs totaled.  Repair costs are enormous.
It‚Äôll buff out...
Frunk is now a fk
"Depends, frame damage would mean it‚Äôs totaled. Since it‚Äôs an expensive and new car, insurance will mostly likely pay for repairs if no frame damage occurred. I‚Äôm guessing the deer died?"
Will this kind of accident raise your insurance? It's obviously not your fault
"Certainly looks repairable to me. It's just body panels from the looks of it, and a headlight. There's minimal components besides that. Looks a lot better than I thought it would. Deer can really fuck up a car."
"Yes it was on AP, it didn't do anything. There was a guy behind me who stopped, he confirmed no brake lights. From my recollection there were no alarms.

Well I'm still kicking and the deer is dead."
"Inquiring minds want to know!

Seriously though glad you're safe."
"No, not sure why"
No airbags or emergency braking. Hopefully I'm going to stay ok. Sometimes after trauma I have issues with nerve pain.
No. Don't know what happened.
This is how you get your panel gaps fixed. FTFY.
No AEB occurred.
It‚Äôs all aluminum so the damage will be worse than you think and more expensive to repair.  I bet totaled.
SWCO but yeah it's similar terrain.
Yeah it did its job. Could have been a lot worse.
It flew.
He's dead.
Get it dry? Good idea.
"Glad you are okay and the vehicle is better.

Yeah I thought only reindeer could fly. I thought it was coming through the windshield but it flew up and across  the other lane, spinning round."
I never even looked. I don't think it was based on the location. Does tend to hang together.
4500
Maybe more like a fuk....
Dead deer
"I think it does. I recall you are always at fault unless the animal hits you. That said, it was a long time ago I heard that."
I had far less damage from backing into a pole in my garage... $11K.  He‚Äôll be lucky if they don‚Äôt total it out.
"Cars can be replaced, glad you made it out without any serious injuries"
"This is scaring, at least emergency breaking should have kicked in üò≤"
I wonder if the new OS would have prevented it? Apparently it is good at recognizing critters.
"I‚Äôm curious what the outcome would‚Äôve been if you were on FSD beta. Tbh, autopilot is pretty bad compared to it. Totally get that AP is revolutionary, but FSD beta really takes the cake."
I'm sure it would have been interesting to see that footage. Do you have a USB storage device to save clips?
Seems to me like a big deal that the airbags weren‚Äôt deployed going that fast but I‚Äôm not sure?
OMG Really?? That‚Äôs scary. Fingers crossed.
"Don't forget to sue the Deers family, im assuming it didn't have insurance? Honestly tho, speaking from recent experience the bumper, collision bar, fender, and lights alone is gonna run you about 13K so I think its probably gonna be over 20K in dmg. 

Wish you luck friend, at least you're safe"
Aw man sorry this happened to you... keep us updated on what happens with the car and if insurance covers anything
Dang crazy :/ I assume AEB is enabled?
Nah fenders and hood aren‚Äôt aluminum and bumper cover is plastic. Model s/x are all aluminum. Had back hatch replaced bumper etc on 2020 model s was 13k.
Glad you‚Äôre ok. Sorry about your car. :(
Flew into Heaven?
That's not what he's telling his friends.
I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre frunked.
He ded
Oh dear
Animal collisions are comprehensive claims. They typically don‚Äôt raise your rates but anything can happen in the insurance game.
No joke. It's amazing how bad that could have been but instead it's just a pia to get repaired. Better than dead.
"It‚Äôll only do that if the object in front is moving in the same direction as you. Cars crossing perpendicular are ignored by the emergency braking system to eliminate false positives (parked cars on turns, and overhead signs, for example). It seems to recognize pedestrians crossing at crosswalks now, but not cars yet."
"Nah, deer are extra points!"
Big Sur?  ü§î
"Yes, that's what I don't understand. Normally it has hours of film. I have nothing from the accident. I need to look at the configuration."
Deer fly.
It wanted to be a reindeer.
Uncle Bjorn frunk-up jackass insurance should cover it
F
Good to know! It shouldn't. I don't see the purpose of an insurance if this kind of accident will raise your rates
Any source for this information? Just yesterday someone posted a video of a M3 emergency braking due to a car running a red light.
SWCO
"Ya I've heard others say that too. When my tire got flat, I got a notification in the car, but was not able to save the clip. Pretty annoying"
"every once in a while i get a notification that my usb device needs to be formatted, maybe that happened to you?"
"You‚Äôre not the only one, I had footage that was lost when someone opened their door into my car while they were parked (I was driving normally on the street). It‚Äôs a bug that needs serious attention."
Same thing for me when I backed into a pole.
"There have been several articles written on the AEB limitations, both at Tesla and across the industry. It‚Äôs a major limitation of nearly all AEB systems. 

The same limitation is why there‚Äôs an article about them running into a stopped car in the lane every few months. This could have been fixed recently as we‚Äôre a few months out from the latest of those incidents, I think. I don‚Äôt know what video you‚Äôre talking about, but it‚Äôs also possible the red light running vehicle had a non-zero relative velocity in the Tesla‚Äôs direction of travel (non-90-degree intersections, or involved a turning vehicle), in which case it would have been recognized in the old system. 

But it‚Äôs hard to keep current because Tesla doesn‚Äôt really release details on the safety features so you have to wait for the infrequent exhaustive tests."
"I recently honked at a drunk driver, and only the time around the honk was missing :("
Here‚Äôs that post https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/jsplle/tesla_auto_emergency_braking_saves_my_model_3
"Repair cost was approx $13k (billed to other party insurance, ty tesla dashcam)

incase anyone was wondering, here were some costs associated with the parts themself. 

* Front Bumper - $400
* Absorber - $185
* Upper Impact Bar - $225
* LT Headlamp assy- $970
* LT Signal Lamp- $200
* LT Fender - $370

* Material, Paint- $503"
"With the added bonus of getting properly aligned panels and headlight :)

PS- don't forget to get that diminished value adjustment"
"Cool breakdown, thank you!"
How long did the repair process take for you?
Looks great!
"I had a similar hit in a 2014 model S, air bags deployed, frame bent, old sunroof popped up."
Thanks for sharing. So glad to see it turn out so nicely!!!! Looks like new. Just curious what shop you used?
"> billed to other party insurance, ty tesla dashcam

Out of curiosity, what happened? How did the MY react to the impending collision?"
"Thank you, helpful for me"
parts cost dosnt seem too crazy.
"Out of curiosity, why did you go to 3rd party? Price? Speed? Convenience?"
"Hah, the shop actually told me the car would be better than when I bought it because they actually cared about panel gaps more than Tesla does"
"Brought it into shop Oct 12th, got it back Nov 5th.  They did whatever they could while waiting for parts to arrive, and the parts took about a week for most and the fender took 1.5 weeks for some reason."
[Certified Collision of Long Island](https://certifiedcollisionlongisland.com/)
"I was on a parking lot road coming back from the bank trying to get onto the main road to go home, driving west bound. An eastbound car was making a left turn and instead of waiting for me to pass they decided that the best time to make a left was when I was in the middle of the intersection. 

Neither of us had a stop sign. She also didn't even attempt to break just straight up had no idea I existed. Honestly it went very smoothly, she was only 19 and had her license maybe a bit over a year at that point. She also told the police she didn't see me so she admitted guilt on the police report and nobody ever tried to fight that I was at fault.

But I work in healthcare and I know insurance isn't your friend so I sent them the dash cam footage anyway. My insurance agent straight up went ""Yea you're fine the dash came shows that this is totally not your fault at all"" and then she just started laughing and talked to me about my car and how amazing it was that it was always recording.

The next day the other partys insurance called me and said they were taking full fault for the accident. I'm sure it would have happened anyway since she was making a left turn and told the police she didn't see me, but the dashcam left nothing up to interpretation. Plain as day their fault.

(the my didn't do anything during the collision, I was in manual driving mode autopilot wasn't engaged. I'm not sure if the car will dodge other cars on its own when autopilot isn't engaged but I only had the car for like 2 weeks at that point so I'm still learning about all the functions)"
Hopefully not for price as it was the other party insurance who paid
"To get into tesla service I would have to wait 3 weeks just to get the car in, then wait again for it to be repaired. I went to a 3rd party because they got me in the next day. Basically, I got my car back around the same time it would have entered Tesla service.

To add to this: Call me old fashioned but I was pretty annoyed at how hard it was to get an actual person on the phone with Tesla service. I have never had an accident like this before so I had no idea what to do, and I just wanted to talk to someone and have my questions answered but I couldn't get in touch with an actual human at Tesla. The shop I used was so amazing, they sent me updated photos as the repairs went on and they were in constant contact with me the whole time. Im really thankful for the shop I used, I will recommend them to anyone I know god forbid they get in an accident."
As a fellow model Y owner they are not wrong
Did you claim for injury or devaluation if vehicle? I imagine it's blue tagged as a salvage?
Brake
That shop sounds amazing. How did you know they were a tesla certified shop? Does tesla have a site for 3rd party certified shops?
It‚Äôs not salvaged. It will note a repair. Bumper covers/fenders/lights are repaired all the time. Unless there was frame damage it typically won‚Äôt get a salvage title. That‚Äôs normally reserved for total loss vehicles bought by insurance companies then resold to people who repair etc.
"You don't get a salvage title unless the insurance company paying the claim totals it.   
  
In that case as you are the insured party would not receive your car back, you get a cash/check payout. Now, you could try to buy the totaled car back and some insurance companies do sell them. However titling it will flag it as such and that gets you the salvaged title."
"I'm putting in a claim for the diminished value, the insurance company told me I had to wait until the car was repaired before I do it. I intend on letting them make their estimate, but im also going to pay for my own estimate because im 100% sure they will low ball me. I've never had to deal with having a car repaired or diminished value so if you have any advice im totally open to it"
"not sure if they have a listing but I just googled ""Tesla collision repair"" and it brought up a bunch of shops around my area. Then I looked at some google reviews, found a nice one nearby, and just simply called them and asked if they worked on Tesla. The manager said that he had his guys sent to California to be trained on Teslas in Fremont and that they were a certified shop due to it

I also asked how long the parts usually take, and they told me up front Tesla got a lot better at sending parts to third partys so its no longer months like it used to be and he was right, only took a bout a week and  a half for the parts"
You‚Äôve gone beyond Infiniti.
"Took delivery yesterday of MY named Tefla with vin starting with 741xx. Fit and finish is perfect, double laminated windows, auto dimming side mirrors but no USB in the glove box. Having problem with the mobile charger that keep saying cable may not be securely plugged in. The charger looked used and dusty!"
I see that mini van in the back ... is that the trade in for the cyber truck ?
I mean. I see an infiniti.  Have you really said goodbye to it?
Congrats on the Tesla! Also love the FX35/QX70. I still miss mine.
Did the same two months ago.
Sold my G37 for a MY!
Same path for me! Except I gave up my q50s
Love this.
lol love the name. Congrats!!!!!
Do you have the metal scroll wheels?
"It‚Äôs not hybrid but we have the same plan. 
I‚Äôll trade it in with a cyber truck only if it has a third row so I can ship the mother in law as far back as I can. Lol."
"It's a Pacifica, can't tell if it's the hybrid version. If it is, we have the same combo. Model Y and Pacifica Hybrid. It's a perfect combo. I use the Model Y to commute all over the state, my wife uses the PacHy to haul the kids around town and run errands. We use the PacHy for long trips with the kids which is the only time we buy gas."
"It‚Äôs almost gone. MY has everything I loved about FX35 (low center of g, bold look, good stereo, etc) and it also everything it didn‚Äôt have (autopilot and more cargo room)"
"My QX60 was totaled replacing it with a Y. Apologizing to my kids friends for no longer being able to cart them around. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
We are currently renting a Pacifica and other than it not being AWD I don‚Äôt mind it.  Not enough to give the Y to the husband though. üòÇ"
No!
"That‚Äôs a great plan, until you get used to autopilot on a long trip. Fair warning."
"Your garage is so C L E A N. 

I wish mine was large enough to fit anything more than my car, the charger, and the garbage bins, lol."
"Dude, the charge port is on the other side!"
I feel ashamed of myself looking at your garage.
That‚Äôs a nice garage space!
Your garage is so clean. Nice dude.
"That second picture is just like my space next to the irrigation system. 

Clean space dude!"
Late march is a long way off! I'd be worried tesla would release another charger revision. Unlikely but you never know.
Wall needs to be red with a big Tesla logo on it.  Come on man. Step up your game!
Lol tsk about delayed gratification. Nice setup though!
"Dude your garage is nicer than my house, damn kids."
Your nice garage is hijacking this post. lol
"Very nice! Can i ask what made you go with the PUP? I‚Äôve been debating PUP vs LR a lot the last couple days, read nearly every thread and watched every video on the decision.

I‚Äôm leaning towards PUP because the extra giddyup just sounds plain fun. My concerns though are that it may not be the most practical and im a little nervous about potentially worse comfort/increased stiffness. I would probably get smaller wheels and tires with more sidewall though to reduce pothole risk (not too concerned about losing a bit of cornering-at-high-speed ability) and I guess that‚Äôd help with the stiffness too (and range but not too concerned about that). If swapping out tires I guess the main difference then is lowered suspension and that giddyup üò¨"
What kind of floor is that?
Garage is too clean.
That garage is a display. Nothing is used huh? LoL
That is a bit early but never too early to be prepared
How much did install cost?
I found having it close to the large door allows charging inside and out.
Nice floor but what you do to the walls? Doesn't look like wallpaper
Yo what kind of clock is that?
Do you plan on backing into your garage or will you drag the cable around to the other side?
"Are you aware that there is a slot on the side of the charger to put the end into? That way it doesn't dangle like you have it there.

Also, it might be an optical illusion but it looks like you installed it a bit high. Supposed to be chest height."
"Looks great, someday I‚Äôll have a garage again üò¢"
"Please align the pennants. With that nice of a garage setup, it's driving me crazy."
Nice! Post also at r/TVtooHigh
Thanks! To be fair I just mopped. But I do like to keep it clean and organized.
I typically back in. But it‚Äôs long enough either way.
Thanks!
Winter is coming so the floor cleanliness won't last!
Figured I'd get it done now and not worry about it over a Minnesota winter but that would suck!
What would I do with all my Winnipeg Jets stuff??
"I pretty much have the exact same thought process and concerns as you.  I just like having the extra speed. (realizing I don't need it)  The smart thing would be to get the LR and add the boost, but I want all the speed.

I'm hoping to find a buyer for the Uberturbines upon delivery and remove them immediately and put on T Sportline TS5 matte black 20's.  According to some things I've read and watched, that should shave 1-2 tenths off the 0-60 time from a combination of 1"" less diameter and the weight savings...plus maybe slightly better ride. And I like the look of them. Not sure if there's a market for the Ubers or not.  Or I'll keep the Ubers and put on TS5 19's for winters.  Also immediately doing a full wrap XPEL Stealth (Y will be MSM), full ceramic, and tint."
I did the Diamond system from [this company](https://www.garagefloorcoatingofmn.com/colors-systems/diamond-system)
I have a friend who is an electrician so I got a good deal. It was quite a job because of where the electrical box was.
Walls and ceiling are just a knock down finish then painted.
It's a Twemco Quartz flip clock.  This particular model is what was used inside a Dominos Pizza in the 80's and 90's.
Back in 90% of the time.
"I was not aware of the slot, thanks!

I installed it a little high because I was covering up something I removed...rather than repair the damage. Plus I‚Äôm fairly tall, and also everything along that wall that you can‚Äôt see is the same height."
"Any illusion of misalignment is just from the angle of the picture.  I painstakingly put them up.  The bottom of each pennant is exactly level.  The top corner of each lines up perfectly up/down, as does the bottom corner of each."
Thanks. It‚Äôs a garage not a living room. To me anywhere but up in the corner angled down would be weird.
This is some nice inspiration- getting my floors epoxied next month. Where did you get the workbench and cabinets?
I was just kidding. Assumed you knew.
"When I first moved into the neighborhood, the neighbors stared for a solid year watching me back in every day. It was just too much to handle."
"Or it might not suck if the newer version introduces changes you don't like/need and you're happy you bought in when you did. For example, some people including myself wish the Gen 2 Wall Adapter was still available. Not every new product release is an all around upgrade."

Thanks for your reply friend! Sounds like we‚Äôre indeed in very similar boats. I was just talking with my gf‚Äôs dad who owns a performance m3 and it definitely made me feel more comfortable going for the performance and just getting 20‚Äù tires. Seems like its still plenty comfy and the added umph sounds thoroughly fun. Cheers üçª
How long has your floor been coated? Thought about doing the same but MN winters are harsh and worry about long term durability.
"Wait wait wait, that's now how you align a pennant!

Shouldn't the far left side be perpendicular to the floor? Imagine the left side is on a pole or rope and they are blowing freely in the wind."
"The workbench is from [PollardBros](https://www.pollardbros.com)  I don't remember if I got it directly from that site, I've had it over 10 years and it's very high quality/sturdy. There are several to choose from.  I added the castors and vice later.

Cabinets are from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LX85S0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) although it says they are currently unavailable...but I'm happy with the brand.  There were several configurations.  I have 2 separate units that are mirrors of each other. (single cabinet on each end)"
Is that what the flooring is? I really like it.
I had a truck for the past 3 years and backed into my driveway every time. Will be doing the same thing now for my Y
True. And maybe I‚Äôll get lucky and something will be added/improved on the Y by then.
"It‚Äôs been 2 years. I opted to pay for a professional job with a 20 year warranty rather than do it myself for a fraction of the cost. Partly because of the MN winters and partly because I didn‚Äôt want to f it up. 

I did do the DIY garage floor coating in my furnace/storage room in the basement and am very happy with that."
This. This exactly.
Yup! You can DIY with a kit at Home Depot for like $250 for a 2 car or have it professionally done for \~$1250.
What‚Äôs the range like?
Tesla should add a tow mode setup that allows you to input trailer weight and have it adjust predicted range accordingly.
Need a range update!
Looking good!!!
What's the weight of that camper?  Max tow weight is 3500 lbs right?
"What are your opinions on the wheels under the aero covers? They are definitely interesting, but I‚Äôm not sure they are my cup of tea in comparison to the model 3 ones."
How's that camper? Looks awesome
I'm thinking of towing a camper and go on road trips. How would charging work? Should I detach to charge? Sounds like a PITA!
Range? What range?
Good question
"Its 50% weight, 50% shape. Wouldn't really do just to do weight, and no one has a windtunnel to input drag coefficient. 

More like hook up a trailer, call it trailer A. After 100 miles, it ""learns"" what towing trailer A means to range, and then adjusts."
Tesla needs to make a camper with a battery built in that will give the vehicle extra range. I would buy it tomorrow.
I agree!
3500 lbs is 1589.0 kg
Around 2300 lbs. This vintage camper has a fiberglass shell.
"I agree. I have decided to use them as my winter wheels with Pirelli P Zero winter tires. I plan to buy a new set of wheels (Martian, T Sportline wheels?) next summer for my summer tires."
Thank you! It's a vintage camper (1971 Boler 17) after restoration. Very easy to tow.
"You'd most likely have to unhitch each time. Major pita. And since range is going to be basically halved you'll be stopping every 130 miles or so.

There are some super chargers with pull throughs but that's no guarantee they're available. Not trying to discourage you but plan on adding lots of time to your trips."
Have you considered camping in the Y itself?
 \~125 miles at 60 mph in PA
Go apply at Tesla.com great idea
Would be pretty sick to tow a camper that recharges the main battery with an auxiliary one and boost the range from 300 to 600 miles. With the extra weight and drag you‚Äôd probably end up back around 300-400 miles but that would be great with a trailer.
i wonder how well that would actually work since the battery would be significant in weight
"https://www.motor1.com/news/388230/e-rv-camper-trailer-all-electric/

That's what Tesla should make."
Nice!  I need to look into those!  Looks super fun
"That‚Äôs actually smart. Especially in colder climates people use steel wheels and looks don‚Äôt matter much. I would agree with getting t-sport line or Martian wheels. I‚Äôm not sure which are better, but I‚Äôve heard good things about both and they look rlly good."
"Yes, you need to look for Superchargers with pull throughs to avoid unhitch each time. Google Maps(aerial view) is your friend. 

BTW, I didn't trade in my Toyota Highlander for my Model Y. I'm planning to use my Highlander for long trip."
Not yet... we might if we have leaks in our vintage camper. ;)

It would be incredible for those who want to pull a camper and not worry about having to charge as often. You could recharge the camper battery at the campsite and have the vehicle draw off the camper so when you get to the campsite you can disconnect and be ready to drive off while the camper battery charges.
Give me a bigger battery and I‚Äôm all in. This is the way though. I wish there was something available in the US.
Good bot
Thanks good call
"I'm not an expert, but I believe trailers have a 12v electrical connection at best.  Even at 50 amps, this puts the charge rate from trailer to car at 1/4 to 1/3 of the charge rate from a standard 120v electrical outlet.  So we're talking 1 mile/hr charging from trailer to car?

I think the more workable solution is to add a motor to the trailer and let its batteries drive the trailer's wheels.  The car & trailer can use the 12v connection to coordinate with one another.  Still improves range by quite a bit...but batteries and induction motors aren't free--this is a fairly expensive trailer we're talking about.

Perhaps you could create a new type of connector between car & trailer, but I assume that comes with a bunch of regulatory hurdles."

"I‚Äôm not opposed to spending a fair amount of money on a decent trailer. I did think about the wheels in the trailer being motorized but I‚Äôm just a guy who wants to be able to pull a camper 300 miles without stopping to charge. 

We have been considering an Airstream camper so spending more than we spent on the car wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. 

I‚Äôm not sure what the market is like for something like this but I‚Äôd be in line for one as it fits my wife and my plan for more traveling as we have more time."
"I'm right there with you, but I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the market isn't demanding a $50,000 trailer that provides 150 miles of extra range.

(Total guesses on price and rage.  I figure the battery = $15-20k; motor = $5-15k; plus $15-30k for a typical trailer without battery & motor--this comes out to $35-65k.  For range, I'm just assuming that 300 miles is halved when pulling a trailer.  Double the battery capacity, and you're back at 300.)  With battery improvements over the next two years, maybe we're looking at a $10k battery that adds 300 miles of range, with a total trailer-camper cost of $30-45k."
150 miles is 241.4 km
Those are some nice shots!
First road trip photos on point!
First pic looks like something out of Star Wars or the Mandalorian.
"Gorgeous shots. This MY config is one of the sharpest imo. 

Slight bias here as I‚Äôm picking up Tuesday"
Congrats!
Nice! I'm expecting to hear about my delivery any time now. I have same spec and have been waiting since Sept in Seattle area (I had to delay the first VIN I got asigned in early Oct). I feel like deliveries are happening more and more often!!!
Great shots-- and the car is sick too!  Congratulations.
"Awesome. That second shot looks like Ruby Beach. I happened to do the exact same thing this weekend with an overnight stop in the Hoh rainforest. Camp mode is fantastic!

Enjoy the car!"
Nice photo!
Ruby beach indeed! Nice eye
"I did it again. 365 days after taking delivery of my Model 3 SR+, I pulled the trigger on a black-on-black Model Y LR. 

(Shhhhh. It‚Äôs a Christmas present.)"
"Wow, congrats. That‚Äôs a mighty fine Christmas present!"
How do you make sure you get the hedgehog when you place the order?
Anyone know they this specific animal is depicted?
"Probably the only surprise car I would not be mad about. üòÅ ""Awesome,I don't need to share anymore! """
You‚Äôll love it!
Tesli.
We‚Äôre in the same club. Took delivery of MY performance in May. The wife loved it so much that she‚Äôs done with her Landrover LR4 and is switching to the Model X. Just ordered and are impatiently awaiting its arrival.
"If it was me, I would give the M3SR+ as the gift and keep the MYAWD for myself!!!"
Hopefully they get the coolant issue fixed soon.
It beats walking to work.
The hedgehog chooses you.
"I have two guesses. 1. They‚Äôre alluding to Sonic the hedgehog, a fictional character known for his speed. 2. Low effort attempt to be quirky."
Thanks. I expect that I will. I‚Äôm hooked at this point.
"I love my 3. It will be nice to have the extra range in the Y for road trips, but for commuting, I‚Äôll take my SR+ any day.

Besides, my wife really likes sitting up high in an SUV."
#truth
Is that true?
Like the thug life?
I‚Äôm leaning towards #2. Seemed funny at 3 am when your trying to meet a release deadline.
He is not very discriminating. üòâ
Hah! Oops. I‚Äôd get that swapped out.
LOL did you pay model 3 price too?
"Hey everyone - just picked up my Model Y a couple days ago. Delivery was perfect and I can‚Äôt say enough positive things about it so far. Might put up some pics of the rest of the car later.

But wanted to see if you all have the Model 3 kick plates on your Model Y‚Äôs as well?

Seems weird to me and just wanted to see if this is something I should have them swap out although I don‚Äôt mind it personally / think it‚Äôs kinda cool given the two models share a lot of the same parts."
"I'd leave it for certain. It's not hurting anything and good for a laugh at teslas quality control as it is currently. 3 months in, and I still feel the tesla is so far ahead in the things they do well, I'll overlook the things they really fall short on. But, if/when subaru ever comes out with a fully electric outback, I'd have a really hard time not going back to a brand I've known and trusted for 15 years."
"So the 3‚Äôs do fit. Been looking for LED ones for the Y, seen them for the 3."
"I‚Äôd just keep it, this is basically like a misprinted baseball card, a true collectors item"
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
A testament to Tesla‚Äôs shitty quality control. Keep it
"Well something like 80% of parts are shared between the 3 and the Y, so this is expected."
"Maybe Y = 3 all along, so it all works out"
Haha. You should leave it on.
I sort of like it! It‚Äôs like an Easter egg!
"Yeah get them to swap it out. They totally won‚Äôt damage or scratch anything. 


Totally kidding! Or not."
"Haha interestingly on the driver side the plate says ‚ÄúModel Y‚Äù. Definitely going to try to get it swapped out. It‚Äôs kind of a cool collectors item for me personally, but worried more if I ever try to sell it to someone else.

Thanks for the advice!"
"My friend got a banner from target that said ‚ÄúMERRT CHRISTMAS‚Äù

It was the best thing ever.

I think I would keep it and laugh every single time"
I‚Äôm sorry but only tesla owners accept this bullshit.  I love my Y but I‚Äôm jyst waiting for the competition to catch up.  The QC issues are outta control.
"[""Yes.  Iz Model Y3.  Three times az good a Y""](https://youtu.be/4hfy2Auauj0)"
"That‚Äôs the thing: we accept it because the pluses vastly outweigh the minuses. If the car was just fine or even pretty good, it‚Äôd be unacceptable. The cars are just so far ahead of the competition we mostly shrug of this kind of stuff. That said, as a Tesla fanboy am also excited to see what the competition brings. Will definitely jump ship for a better car brand in the same price range, just not confident anyone else is close."
"Oh trust me. I have issues with mine (hate the seats and hate the seatbelt issue mentioned below, to name a few)."
Took the words right out of my mouth. Fanboys are the worst.
"Hey can you check if the Y has adjustable seatbelt height? That‚Äôs one thing in Teslas that is a problem for me in any I‚Äôve sat in. (Maybe it‚Äôs now a feature, not sure.) The seatbelt hits way too up high on me and cuts into my neck. Even in my base model Toyota I can adjust the seatbelt height on by pushing in and sliding up or down a couple inches on frame there. Makes a huge difference in comfort and safety. Thanks for looking into it for me!"
Yup that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm leasing for 2 years!
Why?
Right there with ya. Sometimes I just get annoyed at people acting like this stuff is cute.
"And as a bonus, the seat belt adjuster squeaks constantly if you are a tall human who happens to have it right next to your ear all the time when driving."
"Yes, but in the lowest setting it is too high for me so the shoulder belt is against my neck while driving.

This is the first vehicle I've ever owned that caused me a problem. I'm 5' 5"", so very average for my sex."
"Mine does, yes."
"I'm guessing you missed the joke. In the link abkut how Zray is twice as good as Xray, and tha that is what i was referencing"
"Fantastic, I mean who doesn‚Äôt love squeaky unwanted side effects in their luxury vehicle?! I‚Äôm on the shorter side so thankfully my ear won‚Äôt be near it but I have extremely keen hearing."
Darn! Thank you for chiming in. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù in sneakers with a short torso so would most certainly have the same problem
"Oh! That great news. Thank you for confirming! I have been saving for an S but after seeing the Y several of my neighbors just got I am really leaning towards that.

My current small SUV is about the same size or maybe slightly bigger, and I use it extensively for my 2 German shepherds, so the Y seems a better fit for my needs. Still a couple years away from it which is fine as hopefully QC issues will be more under control by then."
"Nah, I was just making a dumb pun on the model Y name :p"
Luxury!?!? HAHAHHAHA Tesla not luxury. High tech yes. Luxury not.
"I bought the car sight unseen, never having sat in a MY, nor driven a Tesla. Plus we had no electricity in our apartment's parking spot. 

I love the car so much it took several weeks before I even noted the shoulder belt. Apparently there are adaptors one can buy and I might yet do so. But the belt is not a deal breaker for me, nor make it impossible to drive. 

On the other hand, it caught me by surprise so, since you asked, I thought you should know what I found."
How many of your neighbors went in on the Y together then?
Same exact reasoning as me. I replaced a Subaru Forester and we have two doodles.
Haha precisely what I was hinting at by using that word! Many people think they‚Äôre like cushy limos with a lot of speed. Not quite... lol
That‚Äôs a heck of a story! I love it!! Good to know there‚Äôs a seatbelt adapter. If you end up getting it let me know how it works!
"I‚Äôm a big Tesla supporter but I‚Äôve said they better step it up if they want to win over the average car buyer.  Calling the SC and getting voicemail, emails that go unanswered and three week lead times for appointments will turn people off fast."
Honestly its the technology that is keeping Tesla ahead of the game right now. If someone can come out with an electric car with the same tech and more reliability Tesla is screwed.
"No surprises here. I had to reject my first Model Y and the second one was acceptable but its driver's door/window had to be fixed before I signed anything (didn't close properly).

Tesla is selling these things like hotcakes, but it's clear they're sacrificing quality checks/fixes in order to make quarterly numbers. Current buyers are almost like paying ""beta testers"" for the Model Y production line. 

It's been a bad enough experience that after I show off the car to my friends, and they're like ""WOW!"" I feel the need to follow it up with ""I wouldn't recommend anyone get a Tesla Model Y, unless you're already obsessed with buying one."""
"I have my **fifth** appointment with the service center on Friday to fix a constant, loud, 100% reproducible rattle of metal-on-glass coming from the area of the upper rear brake light on the back hatch window. It's so loud and constant that any time I have a passenger in my car, they ask if something is broken.

Every time I bring it in, with videos or even the location of the rattle circled with bright tape, even if I show the technician how you can reproduce the rattle by thumping on the window, I get the car back with a long list of completely unrelated (and nonexistent) rattles fixed from the seats, side mirror, center console, etc. and nothing done to the back window.

Getting pretty frustrated. It's hard to really enjoy the awesomeness of the PUP acceleration when your whole car sounds like it's falling apart every time you do it."
"I rejected 2 .....accepted my 3rd and  on my 3rd service for the things needing addressed..... It's really so sad that these vehicles are so good and so fucked all at the same time. Service on these is also generally bad and it's within spec and nonsense

I actually had the service center put on the invoice that the customer needs educated in a seamless door frame vehicle....like fuck when you have to wipe water off the inside of your windows as well when you wash it !!

It's scary to think where they COULD be if they would just slow down a minute and pump out better quality. Once all these new companies start pumping out their electric vehicles it's hard not to imagine that quite a few would jump ship especially in the higher end Model S in regards to Lucid."
"2700 miles on my MY. Love it. Had one problem, the washer fluid wasn‚Äôt coming out. Made appt in app. Tesla ranger showed up at my house. Fixed it in 5 mins. Then pulled out a pump and got my tires all at right psi. Amazing experience."
"So the M3 has a good recommendation rating from CR, but the MY does not, even though they're practically the same vehicle other than rear space? From what I read, their ""reliability"" rating has to due with panel gaps and paint issues from production, and not issue with stuff breaking down after driving, is that right?"
"For various reasons, I couldn't order my Model Y quite yet. Now I think I'll hold out for another month or two to allow Tesla to iron out some of these kinks. I'm sure it's fine, I think Consumer Reports is overreacting to some fit, finish and paint issues."
"Im sorry, but paint issues and panel gaps dont mean reliability to me. Reliability should be in regards to long term ownership and breaking down/maintenance costs.

Im not dismissing the quality issues, I've been lucky with my MY where everything was addressed and fixed quickly.

I cant help but think CR is getting money ""donated"" to push them against Tesla/EVs. I mean Ford has way worse issues than Tesla."
"Overall, Tesla ranked second to last in the reliability study. It was down two spots from a year ago due to the issues identified in the Model S and the Model Y, which went on sale earlier this year. The Model Y has ‚Äúwell below average reliability,‚Äù the publication said."
"Title blows. ‚ÄúPanning the reliability of the Model Y‚Äù? Yeah fit and paint issues that shouldn‚Äôt be there. I spent half a day getting mine resolved and have never looked back or regretted it. Funnest car I‚Äôve ever owned in 35 years of driving. Oh, forgot...ONE glass roof blew off of an MY. And they cite that in the article?? Whatever."
The fact that there are guides and checklists online and people here posting of ‚Äúonly such and such issues‚Äù is a joke. They really need to get this sorted out.
"Yeah, and so?  Folks are going to buy these cars no matter what any consumer reports say.  

There really is no excuse for some of the issues that are ongoing IMO.  But things eventually get worked out / corrected, etc. 

If Tesla would just step up the Final QC Checks (and make simple corrections before it leaves the factory), it would be a night & day difference.  Someday we'll see that happen hopefully."
"ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ship has sailed, purchase has been made. I'm moving forward with my Y."
"WTF do panel gaps have to do with reliability? That's a cosmetic issues that most cars have, go look at any other and you'll notice it on them as well.  If anything the initial quality should be lower because of those issues.

FWIW, my Y pickup last month was great!"
I have had mine for two weeks and love it   No issues. I had to drive a friends car to the repair shop yesterday and was like ‚Äúew what‚Äôs that smell?‚Äù It was gas!!  Hahaha!!. Ive already forgotten how toxic that odor is!
"Got a MY for now, but Q4 Etron will be my next lease/purchase for sure, especially at the rate Electricify America/Canada is expanding its charging network."
Meh. Consumer Reports is a joke.
Correct
LOL
They‚Äôre still ‚Äúrecommending‚Äù the Model 3? The Y is a far superior car and they have identical ‚Äúreliability‚Äù issues. Makes no sense.
Im waiting on my Y and this has me nervous. I love all the tech so much but Im wondering if leasing instead of buying may be a better choice if its going to have this many issues???
If only Honda and Toyota would get their heads out of their asses. Ridiculous they‚Äôre still not making any real moves yet.
That will simply be Tesla itself improving into the future.
"In my view, it's specifically their supercharger network and tech. No other system / auto maker has come remotely close. Tesla has such a huge head start here."
"The issue for Honda or Toyota or similar is that they're not software OEMs. They would need a ground up rebuilding of their talent to get where Tesla is in software.

Now, that doesn't mean Tesla will absolutely win, but it means it's going to be hard for someone to unseat them. At least much harder than it will be for Tesla to stamp out initial quality issues."
You‚Äôre getting closer to lemoning it. How many total days has it been in the SC?
Have you checked it for leaks? Like blast a hose at the area to see if it gets through?
"FWIW, water on the inside of a frameless window after a car wash is a real thing.  I've seen it happen on an Audi S5 and a Mini JCW, both of which have top-notch assembly quality."
Frameless windows will leak it‚Äôs difficult to seal glass vs felt. Every convertible I‚Äôve washed does and most coupes do it‚Äôs not uncommon. Older cars that have frameless windows looks like a waterfall lol.
"Yes that‚Äôs what the article states.
If paint chips and panel gaps are all that‚Äôs affecting the recommendation, it‚Äôs safe to assume those will be ironed out as production ramps just like with the M3.
FWIW my MY has no such issues. No chips, no gaps.
But ironically when I recently took it in to have it cleaned (greasy fingerprints from the build process) they gave me a MS loaner...which had issues with the touch screens not turning on."
"That‚Äôs what I read here, but the article in question and the actual CR issue do not imply that. They only discuss mechanical issues with the various vehicles in discussing the results (but individual cars don‚Äôt get a description in the magazine, it‚Äôs just a list and brand summaries)."
Really? That low? Hmm.
"Yeah what is pointed out in the article is a bit ridiculous, but Tesla does have a target on their back and will always be subject to an added layer of scrutiny - Elon‚Äôs occasional antics don‚Äôt help that.

Also, the biggest issues currently seem to be production consistency and service reliability. Those two things are very easy to fix with investment in the right areas. They‚Äôre also signs of an immature company (in the sense of a company life cycle), which Tesla still is relative to their competitors.

I have a lot of faith that Tesla will get a handle on both and I personally have had nothing but 10/10 experiences so far with sales and delivery.

Meanwhile, as others have mentioned, no other EV company can offer what Tesla can through the supercharger network and overall vehicle experience. And I suspect those aspects will be much harder for other companies to overcome than it will be for Tesla to overcome their issues.

For those interested in buying, I recommend going ahead with it. I went through the same second thoughts and I would be seriously regretting my decision if I had chosen to cancel the order."
Not unless they open a factory in Japan or similar.
"Panel gaps cause window leaks and increase drag while driving, in many cases."
"> I had to drive a friends car to the repair shop

In two weeks? That's a bad sign already."
I'm with you on this.
"Was nervous as well, had white on order even which had a history of panel colors not matching. Had mine for a bit over a month now, some minor panel alignment issues, door handles a bit recessed, couple other small things however have heard many stories of people bringing it in for service and either nothing fixed, fixed but other issues popping up due to the fix, and/or no loaners. Decided I can live with the minor issues for now. 

That said, feel fortunate as the minor issues are really only going to be noticed by the most nitpicky of us. It really an amazing car and completely love it but like anything else, nothing's perfect."
Same
I feel the same way.  I just got notified Today my MY is ready in 2-4 weeks. All of the quality issues and now this negative CR review makes me wonder if I should cancel.
Reported poor quality issues were the deciding factor in my choice to lease my Model 3 instead of buy. Turns out fit and finish on my car look fine to me; yes a couple panels are a little misaligned but you really have to look closely to see it. I have white/white and don‚Äôt see any color mismatches. I never closely examined the BMW‚Äôs and Infiniti I owned in the past so I can‚Äôt really compare. I‚Äôve had the car since the end of February and haven‚Äôt needed to contact the service center so I can‚Äôt speak to how responsive they are. When my lease is up I‚Äôm leaning into buying a Model Y.
They'd rather die than admit they were wrong/late. Pretty badass
yup
"Each time they only keep it for like 4-5 hours, then announce they found and fixed the rattle and give it back. (Spoiler alert, they haven't.) So it's not like it's been in the shop for a long time -- I've just had to go back five times.

Yeah, it's great that this is all free, and I can make an appointment from an app, and they are nice and responsive and turn it around quick. But none of that matters if they can't fix the damn underlying general assembly issue."
My S5 did it all the time
"I've had over 15 BMW in my day not a single one leaked ever with frameless, right up to my 550gt. Even my 2002 convertible M3 was perfect.

I just don't buy it. 3 of my windows on MY are perfect not an ounce of water, then my front passenger is a mess. Condensation all inside the seals right to the bottom of the window every wash, open the door and actually dry the inside of the window. That's shitty quality, if all 4 were the same I'd give the benefit of the doubt.

You can clearly see the window is in tighter at the bottom at the door and gradually comes out near the top not sealing properly."
"Agree with everything you said, except how they‚Äôre immature ‚Äúrelative to their competitors.‚Äù
EV wasn‚Äôt new when Tesla came along, but they completely disrupted it and are in a league of their own. I agree that fit, paint, service workflow issues are likely a non-issue (or at least lessened) with most GM, VW, etc. established car companies. Beyond that, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre much of a competitor; they‚Äôre ICE vehicles with EV motors. That‚Äôs not Tesla. And given GM just recalled 51K Bolts, they have their own segment of immaturity. And true...it‚Äôs not their fit/finish and service network. But Tesla‚Äôs solutions through a wifi connection aren‚Äôt getting their fair share of coverage related to the service issues. Nor does the competition get faulted for not having that level of service sophistication.
Related to the title of the story and the topic of this thread, I think this is poor journalism at best and very short-sided coverage of the topic. And as someone else mentioned in this thread, CR isn‚Äôt much of a player these days. I‚Äôm old and I barely pay attention to them anymore. The largest market segment is millennials - I wonder what CR‚Äôs readership or credibility is with them."
"Yeah, totally agree with that.  Japanese production crews would not let anything leave the factory that wasn't perfect."
"Yeah I definitely think people are nitpicking too much overall on tiny things, for example has anybody ever really inspected door gaps and panel gaps on any other car to see if they are all completely perfect? I never have. But some other things that are legitimate issues are the ones that are making me nervous. Consider yourself lucky I guess"
"I've had my MY for a few months. Only delighted. It gets better after you buy it, that's never happened before. Get ready for a big smile that happens every time you get in the car."
"Got notified today also but I think it‚Äôs a matter of perspective. Nothing is perfect as they mentioned above but the reality is this is not an inexpensive vehicle and should be met to expectations.

That being said, it is an awesome vehicle and I‚Äôm excited to make the upgrade"
"Don't trust CR. The Y has had a few panel gaps or paint issues that you can see with a magnifying glass during a Covid ramp up. Tesla fixes those if you're the unlucky one, otherwise it's an incredible car that does much more than anything else on the market besides a X."
Wait 5 times for the same issue? What‚Äôs the lemon law in your state?
My custom ordered 2014 BMW 335i xdrive was perfect from the factory but also took 3 months to get from order to delivery.... there also was not a wait to get one at all dealer I just wanted specific options... it is what it is in my opinion yes it an expensive car but it‚Äôs a daily driver as well with in a month you‚Äôll have a door ding or rock chip
"Unless you're Takata, Toyota or Honda."
The reason you have to nitpick is because the delivery center doesn‚Äôt do what a dealer would do at this price point. A good dealer of a 50-100k vehicle would inspect and fix before they sold it to a customer. I really hope Tesla improves in QC before the CyberTruck.

"I'm also going to do those rims immediately. Are those 20s or 19s?

Hoping to sell the Uberturbines brand new for reasonable money."
Did you have them swap out your new tires/rims for you or did you do yourself?
Delivered and aftermarket rims already! I would atleast try using stock ones to know i am actually getting a difference!
Haha I‚Äôll give it to you there. That‚Äôs funny. üòÇ
Ha. This is the new age Tesla parking way. It wasn't like this before the model 3.
Which rims are they?
They did it. We shipped them to Tesla KC and they put them on in like an hour. Tsportline did mess up and send the wrong tire valves so we will have to get that fixed locally.
They are from tsportline.com. The TS5‚Äôs I assume.
These are the tsportline 21s
How much did it cost to get them installed?
Toss a Bitcoin to your Witcher.
"2021 Model Y Performance, ordered 9/19 picked up 11/16, manufactured 11/20. Came with laminated front glass, auto dimming side mirrors, and P-Zero summer tires. No console refresh or any other updates.

&#x200B;

Delivery was flawless, there was 0 imperfections (at least that bother me). I am impressed with the quality and consistency improvements they have made. I also have till I reach 100 miles to address imperfections.

&#x200B;

I know there is a lot still waiting to receive their MYP's. Now that I am on the other side it was worth every minute of the wait."
Yennefer got a fat ass
Nice car! care for a quick game of Gwent?
Pics of back bumper ??
Did the auto-dimming mirrors show up on your Tesla ‚Äúwindow sticker‚Äù as a feature when you picked up the car?
What about steering wheel?  Does it have the metal thumb wheels or rubber?
What kinda camera did you use for these pics?
This was 70k?
Is the car wrapped or is that the factory white color?
What was the VIN. number?
What do you mean by laminated front glass? Are you referring to the dual pane windows? Are those only on the front side doors?
Hmm
Same car! 755xx. Picking up 11/29. Cannot wait! So happy to see another MYP in white. Will look at these pics to hold me over.
What are Auto-Dimming Side Mirrors? I mean when are they useful? #CuriousNoob
It was made after you picked it up?
Yen would not have approved of the color
100 miles is 160.93 km
Pixel 4 XL lol
$69k :)
This is factory white
"73,XXX so kinda high they are on to 77k now I think. I think I was right at the cut off for the mirrors"
Yes just on the driver and passenger door
Indeed
I have them on my equinox. They are a huge help with night time driving. No more getting blinded by the person behind you. Sometimes helps when driving away from the sun at dawn or dusk as well.
"The auto-dimming mirrors, automatically tint themselves when light over a certain threshold is defected. It has saved my precious eyeballs from getting blinded by headlights that are directed right at eye level."
11/2020 (MM/YYYY)
"As a fellow P4 XL owner, I'm curious how it's going with pairing and recognizing your phone on approach etc. And yeah, insane camera on these. :)"
If I ordered exact same car on 11/8 and got 072xxx does this mean I got someone‚Äôs reject?
Interesting. I wonder why not the back ones. Also I though the cars already had auto-dimming mirrors? My 2018 model 3 had them.
Except the way Tesla implements them they turn on at sunset
"Seamless! The app isn't even affecting the battery usage on my phone. Bluetooth works great and wireless charging works flawlessly (I do have a thin case on).

They also just updated the camera app to include being able to select wide vs standard lenses"
"Possibly, you ordered a Model Y Performance?"
I got my model y in July and I do not have dimming mirrors. So sad
I don't see that wide vs standard yet - where is the option?
Yes.
Hmm I‚Äôll have to go check mine
When you select camera you should be able to select 1.0x vs 2.0x. I guess it's not really a lens option more like set zoom.
Ahh yes - that I did notice.
Any quality issues with the vehicle?? Will be picking mine up from the grand ave location hopefully soon!
Love all the photos. Same one I ordered.l
double paned windows?
Tint?
Nice car!!
Congrats - enjoy!!! ü§©
I contacted my SA and got VIN assigned within few hours
"I ordered on oct 27. MSM, LR, w/b interior, tow hitch, black wheels. My pickup location is also Grand Ave. wondering when I‚Äôll receive my VIN. I want my car so badly!"
Congrats! Car looks great and glad to see the qc has improved! Ordered mine on 10/16 with the same spec at the Grand location but still no vin asssignment...hope to get an update soon
very few (2-3) with seat alingment... but nothing huge
Pretty sure anything after 64xxx has them!
yes double pane
Back windows are getting for front windows soon
thanks‚ô•Ô∏è
I was in same place. You should get vin on 10 days if not contact them and delivery should be in next 10 days after u receive VIN
thank you!
How did u find everything? I‚Äôm 70k vin awaiting delivery date
I received my VIN 11/7. It‚Äôs listed right under my RN number. Now I‚Äôm waiting for the delivery text I guess? Hopefully sooooooon
It was upto the mark very few issue with rear seat panel gap and everything else looks good

"Gah, wish we got extra help here in Oklahoma. I‚Äôm jealous."
It was always eligible but the database just wasn‚Äôt updated yet for 2021
I applied for mine in June when I got my MY. Took a really long time. I got my rebate check in early October.
"I applied my 2020 with temp registration & temp plates, i have since now received my plates. Temp works for 2K rebate but not pg&e and HOV access stickers right?"
California only
I gotta admit I was getting worried. This is great news!
"Hurry up with the pg&e rebate, they stop accepting submissions on Dec 31st and you need to have a permanent vehicle registration."
Sigh* I wish I made less than 150000 so that I could appreciate this discount ...
Why would California reimburse people in other states?
"wait - what does that mean, 'permanent' vehicle registration? So this program ends in 2021 and if I haven't placed my MY order yet it's probably too late?"
"By permanent I meant the one you receive from DMV with an actual license plate, not the  temporary one from Tesla.

When I talked to PG&E representative about it about a month ago they said this program isn‚Äôt funded for 2021. Maybe something changed since then, I would recommend giving them a call."

It will nice if themes are added for various displays.
"I have used night mode after sunset, and it does improve map readability.  Will try it daytime and see if that helps.  I guess it‚Äôs like Dark Mode on the iPhone."
Depressing the right steering wheel button triggers voice command.  What do you do next to create an email or feedback?  I obviously wrote these comments so someone from Tesla would take note.  Anybody know where to send direct comments to Tesla developers?  Thanks.
"I ordered mid September and got matched on the 28th for Sept 30 delivery (vin xx44xxx).  I declined because I did not want to be part of the quarter end delivery rush. I was matched again on Oct 16 when car was in production.  It arrived at Mt Kisco NY service center  on 27th, and I picked up on 29th.

Agree.  They can‚Äôt satisfy all users with just one user interface.  Customization of colors/fonts/options or themes would be the logical way to do this.

This is amazing news! Perfect timing. Hope the matte console and trim comes out soon though!
"I‚Äôm over here still waiting for the RWD LR that was supposedly ready for release in like, July."
"Noob question: I want that new center console from the model 3 with the side stitching and open charging area.  Seems likely it will be coming to the Model Y soon, given their update patterns. I‚Äôm indifferent to the heated steering wheel. Is there a way to know exactly what you‚Äôd be getting based off the VIN assigned or is it just a guess based off the VIN range? This whole thing is so different from other car purchasing experiences for me."
Steering wheel still not heated üò≠
"Interesting. My 75xxx MY arrives next week, so will have to see what it has. I even bought one of those usb adapters with a high endurance SD card - wonder how that compares to what they provide now."
"I took delivery of my Y Long Range last Friday in Scottsdale, it arrived from factory with 7 miles and was a custom order placed last week of October.  VIN ending 073xxx. 

I do have the ‚Äúdual pane‚Äù laminated windows. Just checked in the glovebox, do NOT have the USB port. Steering wheel dials are all black (rubber) not metal."
I really want that usb in the glovebox. Almost thinking about delaying delivery... almost
"Exciting! Fingers crossed for my LR hopefully coming soon. I had originally gotten a VIN in early Oct but had to delay, looks like it might be to my advantage!"
"My Y is 725xx it came with the usb glovebox, dual laminated windows and auto dimming mirrors. I picked it up yesterday."
Am I the only one who loves their model y as is and not coveting any of the new updates?
"DAMNIT, missed it. Just took delivery with 71xxx VIN."
I just took delivery yesterday. I have to check but I doubt it. I didn‚Äôt even get the double pane windows! Vin ending in 75xxx
https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/jwu1px/model_y_single_motor_coming_soon/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
No way of knowing.
"No way to tell unfortunately. Rolling changes are happening all the time. Sometimes it's more apparent things like the center console or the side mirrors, sometimes it's internal things that nobody will ever see/notice. I'm waiting on my first Tesla but have been following them closely for years. You could try asking your advisor but a lot of times they don't even know from what I've seen in what others experience.



No matter when you get the car, something will most likely change within the next 6 months for new VINs. It's like any tech; cell phones for example change all the time and continually add new features and get better. Almost the moment you buy one it's obsolete. The difference here though is it's a tougher pill to swallow since it's SO expensive for a car vs. a phone and you are stuck with it for longer than the average person keeps a phone. I've just told myself to be ok with the fact that technology gets cheaper/better over time and enjoy the thing that I'm getting. I made my purchase decision of a Model Y based on what I experienced and test-drove back in August or so. If there are improvements from that time, then I just think of it as a bonus! I also value the continual software updates highly over some hardware features.



That said, if a center console is a deal-breaker for you, then you would probably want to wait until it's confirmed that all VIN's are getting them before taking the chance. Personally if I wanted a feature that might be coming, I would wait until I was assigned a vin and ask my delivery advisor if that car has the feature you wanted. If not, delay, if so, great!"
"This is a TOTAL guess, but I'm thinking HEAT is physically installed in the 'new steering wheel' which has the metal covered scroll wheels & it will be a software enabled thing before too long (maybe one of the Christmas software surprises).  

Heated wheel seems like it's a highly requested thing ... if they're going to re-do a wheel with the metal scrolls, seems like a good time to add the hardware for heat.  I'm in FL so not a huge deal except for my occasional frosty road trips up north.

Wouldn't be surprised if some youtuber tears one apart to see inside."
Do the new model 3s already have heated steering wheels?
I also received a VIN #75XXX but it not arriving until the 3 Dec. (Orlando FL) please post any new features. Thanks
7 miles is 11.27 km
How do you delay delivery? I will have serous FOMO if they end up doing that center console update soon.
It makes sense to do so when you would lose Sentry footage if the thief knows where to look. Having the USB in the locked glovebox is worth waiting for IMHO.
What‚Äôs the build date? I‚Äôm guessing you are located in California?
Hi! Congrats! Whats the build date?
Did you get the metal scroll wheels on the steering wheel?
üò¢
Another noob question: how would I know who my adviser is? The lady I test drove with?
Oooh I hope you're right!!!
I am supposed to pick up tomorrow.  My delivery was already delayed due to ‚Äúdamage in transit‚Äù that they are fixing. I‚Äôve considered rejecting the car and asking for a new vin to be assigned. I decided to at least look at the car tomorrow before I accept or reject it.
How do I find the build date? Yup in Bay Area.
Not sure tbh
Yes metal scroll wheel
"Mine reached out to me shortly after I made my reservation via text. As far as I'm aware, it's the same person I scheduled my test drive with and spoke with in person on the day of my drive. They are available to answer questions about the buying process, and to help coordinate delivery day once it finally comes.



If you haven't heard from them yet, I'd recommend calling the store where you did the test drive and ask about who your advisor is since they haven't been in touch."
"I am still in the same boat... I'm awaiting a call from my advisor to tell me if my car will be ready for delivery tomorrow as promised. When it was just the laminated windows, I thought no big deal. Then the auto dim side mirrors... and now the usb in the glove box. I'm also waiting to hear back to see if they are going to give me any kind of discount/promo for having to wait so long. I'm really considering getting a new VIN if they give me nothing (or next to nothing like 1000 supercharger miles)."
On the door jamb sticker that shows the recommended tire pressure
Not sure other than asking your SA. I‚Äôve got one on the way with an 11/11  build date so just curious if I‚Äôll get the changes.
"Thanks for sharing. Exciting to see all the new features getting out there!


Do you mind sharing your location? Trying to get a feel for if us west-coast folks are getting them soon!"
"I found turning on the nighttime ambient lighting to help with the darkness, I agree it could use a little more lighting at the charge station"
"Does it also have the new console? (Glad you got the side mirror feature you so wanted!)

Also, is it too dark inside at night? I am still deciding between the M3LR and MYLR. 

Did you get FSD? Why? Why not?

Thanks!"
What was your 3rd digit I have a 753xx next week. Hoping I get these also what is your config? Only ones I‚Äôve seen have been black interiors with scroll wheel and usb.
You do realize it is so much easier to drive at night without a bunch of lights glowing in your face right? It's seriously a dramatic difference if you dim the screen or if driving an ICE car try dimming the instrument gauge and then being able to see many more details outside.
"Santa Barbara, CA"
"I agree one thing I really dislike is driving at night, there desperately needs to be ambient lighting in these. They have been in other vehicles now for ages on door trim etc."
Updated center consoles for the MY don‚Äôt exist yet. I‚Äôm waiting on that too hopefully it comes!!!
"Right, original center console. It‚Äôs not toooo dark, but the only ambient light is the foot wells of the front passenger and driver. I‚Äôm more disappointed with having to downgrade from what was offered in the cheaper model 3 (or other premium offerings from other manufacturers, for that matter). 

I didn‚Äôt get FSD. I don‚Äôt think that the feature is worth $10k at this time. That‚Äôs mainly it!"
7. LR AWD White with black interior
"You can't discard the need to interact with storage and other functions inside the car, while you are driving.  Even more so for the passengers.

If there's no light in the console area/storage, as the poster described, imagine how difficult it would be to find items stored in them in the dark. 

There should be ample lighting everywhere a person might need it, and an option to shut it off if you don't want it.  Everyone wins."
What was the build date?
"I was able to activate ambient lighting at night via the lighting screen, I‚Äôll have to check next time I‚Äôm driving how strong it is. I know it illuminates the foot area and the arrows on the steering wheel"
"Thanks, this helps a lot!"
11/2020
"There is a steering wheel light toggle yes and the footwells, still needs more!!"
Mine was built 11/11/20. Vin 74xxx. I got the laminated windows and auto dimming side mirrors but no usb in glove box which is a bummer. Congrats!!
"Agreed, I bet the new consoles they‚Äôll roll out will have lights üò´"
Thanks! I saw on the door panel it says 11/20. But I couldn‚Äôt see an exact date. How do you find the exact date?
My door panel says 11/20 too. You have to ask you SA for the exact date. The dates seem to make a big difference this month. I think the switch to the auto dimming mirrors occurred on 11/10... so I got lucky with that one.
Mine was built on 11/10 as well. Waiting for delivery next week in Texas. Hopefully we‚Äôll have those dimming mirrors
Yes!!! Congratulations!
"The console wrap and dash are the next good ""my car"" feelings after you take it home. Death to gloss!"
"Wait, Are you me?! Lol literally ordered my Tesla around the same date and my pick up is 11/12. I've literally watch every tesla videos,(accessories, home charging, FSD vs EAP, etc.) on youtube. My birthday just passed on November 2 and I just turned 28. LOL so its a nice little present to myself even though it's really the wife's car. Ordered the LR, white, Gemini as well. I absolutely cannot wait to get it... Idk if I will be able to sleep that night. Looking to tint the front two windows to match the back two and also matte black the wheels and rims. I hope my delivery date will be as smooth as yours. Congratulation , oh and I am so jealous of your insurance!!! Progressive quoted me the cheapest and it was about $690/6 months"
How perfect - congratulations!!! ü•Ç
"Happy birthday, congratulations, and good luck!"
"What color? And where are your pics? Congratulations, my pickup date is 11/15 it can‚Äôt get here soon enough."
What‚Äôs the tire compressor??
Congrats! We picked up our Y on 10/24 and have been in love with it ever since! ICE cars feel prehistoric now.
"Congrats, currently playing the waiting game on my Vin/Delivery date"
You bought a model Y on an 80k salary? Bruh.
"It‚Äôll be the best day. Since you‚Äôve watched as much as youtube as I have, you know how many people report the negative when I know there‚Äôs some great ones out there that no one talks about. Also gemini wheels look soooo much better in person! Happy birthday to you as well, good luck hoping for a flawless delivery for you as well!!!"
"Thanks, it‚Äôs white! I can‚Äôt figure out how to add pictures after I‚Äôve already made the post lol"
"https://shop.tesla.com/product/tire-repair-kit

[deleted]
Awesome I ordered a LR white/white/Gemini/FSD so hopefully I have the same experience as you. I can‚Äôt wait.
Nice! I didn‚Äôt know that! I knew Teslas don‚Äôt come with spare tires. This is much better!
"Wait, where in the car did you find this kit? I'm pretty sure I checked all compartments of the trunk already...no compressor for me."
It‚Äôs not wise buying a Model Y on a sub 6 figure salary
In the trunk. Next to the charging cables and the SA went over the kit with me too. I did read on Facebook that not all states provide it? Idk how true that is tho
"Thanks for the unsolicited financial advice! Take it up with my bank, my bank account, and my down payment. Please take your wisdom elsewhere"
"Yeah, my trunk only had the charger and license plate frames. Could be a state law like you said. I'm in California."
YOLO! Work hard and enjoy your life! Sounds like you have your house in order. Haters be hatin
"also didnt get pump, California."
Exactly! Haters gonna hate! I was paying the exact same payment on my jeep monthly that I am now on my Tesla. Reddit keyboard warriors always think they know more.
"As a car guy previously, that's one thing that attracted me to this car. I don't mind a firm ride."
"Went from a 2012 BMW X5 with 19"" wheels to the Model Y with 19"" wheels, and the Model Y handles bumps SO much better.  The X5 was horrible."
I agree. It‚Äôs a bumpy ride. Coffee has spilled a few times. Btw there are YouTube videos about people having their MY suspension replaced with softer (and adjustable) springs. I‚Äôm sure it costs a ton. I‚Äôm not willing to do that yet. The car costs enough for now. (Love my Y).
"I know the performance Y is real stiff, the Long Range is much softer especially with the 19'' wheels, you can make it even softer by getting a different set of wheels outside of stock. Not to mention upgrading the suspension itself. Compared to my previous vehicle it's about the same."
"I own a Chrysler Crossfire, I‚Äôll bet your Y has a smoother ride than that, LOL"
"Coming from a sports car on coilovers, the MY rides like butter, lol. I don't find it stiff at all."
"I‚Äôm not sure if this vehicle specific, but I feel my 2021 MY ride is not harsh at all. Our 4Runner and Camry are rougher. I‚Äôve been pleasantly surprised with how smooth it is."
"Yeah it‚Äôs stiff, for sure. One of the main reasons I could not justify going for larger wheels and going to customize my geminis a bit"
Which model and wheels do you have? I test drove a LR with Inductions and didn't think it was near as bad as people said it was but I'm not a car guy.
feels softer than my model 3
"I absolutely agree with this. I was dead set on getting a Model Y. I even put down the $100 deposit, and wasn't planning on test driving. An EV suites my lifestyle very nicely in terms of charging, etc. I happened to be free one day and the Tesla Store was really easy to get a test drive from. When I sat in the car, I loved it. The driving position and ergonomics felt great.

Within 50 feet of driving the car in the shopping mall, I knew I had to go with a different car. It's absurdly stiff. This was a non-performance model with base 19"" wheels, and I verified the tire pressure was correct (actually it was a bit low).

I have no idea why Tesla tuned a base model like that. I could feel every bump, big and small, at both high and low speed, and there is a booming sound (think subwoofer) that was super annoying. It's such a shame because otherwise, I loved the car. I lost my $100 deposit.

I've heard that Tesla may have tuned it to become more comfortable if there are passengers in the car. I still want to try bringing a few hundred pounds of gym weighs with me to another test drive.

My frame of reference (i.e. what I own) is BMW M Sport (540i, 20"" wheels, no adaptive dampers) and Lexus F Sport (IS 350) suspensions, which are not crazy stiff, but still pretty firm. The Model Y is on another planet compared to those."
"Does changing the suspension setting help? From memory there is a comfort, auto, sport and advanced setting for ride height and damping."
I'm at 13k. At 50k I'm probably going coilovers. The suspension and wheels are the weakest part of the car.
It‚Äôs probably my biggest gripe with the car too but I‚Äôm not too bothered by it. I was considering getting the luxury coil over suspension if I can find somewhere that installs it around me.
"Yeah I guess everyone has their preferences. I came from 10 years a driving a very tamed Acura sedan, which to me started to feel lame. I was excited to have a stiffer, sportier suspension. I'd still recommend people to test drive for a better informed decision though."
"Me, being a former Focus RS owner, laughing"
"I have the LR AWD MY, my last car was Audi A4 and I also owned RDX and  X1. MY suspension is very similar to the X1. But I think it has a lot to do with the tires too. I have the 19"" and I changed to 235/55R18 winter tire today. The ride sure feels less bumpy. I saw other people suggested to deflate the tires by a couple psi. I will try that next spring."
"I think it's pretty subjective and really depends on what car you came from and what you want out of the car. I test drove the long range a couple weeks ago and ordered one, compared to my Land Rover Disco Sport, I thought the suspension was pretty plush.  I also don't really want it to ride like a Cadillac, because then it's going to handle in the corners like a Cadillac, and I live in a very hilly area with windy roads. There's nothing more frustrating that floating off into the shoulders or feeling like you're going to roll over."
"I find it interesting how counterintuitive ride comfort can be. Most people see big heavy SUVs and they think the added ride height will translate to huge suspension travel and a super plush ride. In reality, they higher center of gravity and mass requires the suspension to be made much stiffer than a lighter sedan in order to have any semblance of handling capability. This is then compounded by the giant wheels that are needed to maintain a sporty look on a larger vehicle. We tested most of the mainstream and luxury compact SUVs and the Model Y on 19s was on the stiffer end. Not as bad as the Stelvio or SQ3 but way harsher than mainstream CRV and Rav. Tesla definitely relies on the plush seats to soak up some of the impact, though that doesn't protect the rest of the car. I personally think anyone that gets the 20s in the salt belt is crazy."
"yep, I had the same experience. All NJ potholes feel more problematic than in my other ICE car (BMW)."
"Would running the tires at a lower pressure help? Of course, there will be an impact on the range."
"yes, and according to Mountain Pass Performance the MY Performance is engaging its bump stops 100% of the time.. replacing just springs won‚Äôt be enough, this car needs coil-overs

edit- quote ‚ÄúAdditionally, when lowering SUVs which are naturally much higher, there are geometry problems to deal with. In the case of the Model Y, the base vehicle is quite high and for the performance variant, Tesla achieved the lowering by using shorter springs only ‚Äì while retaining the same bump rubber lengths. As a result the factory Performance Model Y actually engages the bump rubbers at all times! This means you‚Äôll see a huge difference in the ride of our suspension compared to OEM over large compressions and potholes where the OE bump rubber would be really making the ride uncomfortable.‚Äù https://www.mountainpassperformance.com/product/modely-comfortadjustable/"
I agree too. To me I would just say it‚Äôs more middle ground. Neither rough nor smooth. I have a mini van and an NSX too. It‚Äôs goes right in between.
"100% agree. In fact, if it was soft, I would‚Äôve hesitated buying it. 

The suspension isn‚Äôt any stiffer than my previous car (‚Äò18 Audi SQ5). And I have some really crappy roads in the Boston area!"
That‚Äôs because your X5 had run flats which then is no longer an apple to orange comparison
Totally agree.  I had a 2012 X5 diesel (with run flats) and that was really bad. I like stiff suspensions but those run flats made it really bad. Didn‚Äôt realize how bad until I got the SQ5.
No adjustable air suspension in any Y... yet. My mobile service person suspects it‚Äôll be an upgrade option soon
Not in the Y
"There isn't a suspension setting on the Y (normal, don't know about Perf)"
Ugh potholes are a nightmare up here in Boston. I give myself a month before I wreck a wheel.
"When I leave the house in NJ with my current bmw it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúJesus take the wheel‚Äù in regards to potholes. 6 blown tires, three bent 20‚Äù wheels already and only 6 months left on a 3 year lease before I get my Y. I‚Äôm worried about potholes with it as well so I want the smaller of the premium wheels with more tire. Have you or anyone hit potholes head on without blowing a tire?"
I just ordered these. lead time is 4-8 weeks! Hope it's closer to 4.
"I'd love a set of these for the wife's non-P Y. 
I drove her new Y yesterday for 150 miles around Atlanta, suspension really didn't bother me at all."
That makes no sense. The shocks are at full compression 100% of the time?  It would be literally undriveable.
"Actually, my X5 did not have run flats.  It was running standard continentals.  I don't remember the exact type.  My 530e DID have run flats and drove better than the X5 by far.  The 530e and the Model Y were pretty close, with the Model Y being a bit softer."
I have the Gemini wheels and haven't had any problems.
Been there. I‚Äôve wrecked enough rims that I‚Äôd get 1950s white walls on my cars if they offered them.
">Have you or anyone hit potholes head on without blowing a tire?

Not yet. I've driving a lot less due to COVID-19."
"shocks/springs would still have travel, but even uncompressed from bumps, they are already touching on the bump stops.. bump stops are like sponges and still have a bit to go before hitting its limit; MPP‚Äôs point is that there‚Äôs not much more to go and little bumps will violently transmit into the car and disrupt handling"
"I don't doubt your impressions at all, but I must say that I found a 530e to be way more compliant than a Model Y. I happen to have a family member with a 530e so have driven it extensively. When I test drove the Model Y, I found it to be incredibly stiff in comparison. I guess people perceive ride quality in different ways."
Please let us know what the root cause was.
FFS. ‚ÄúMade in California.‚Äù I‚Äôd take it tmrw to your svc center and demand a loaner or rental at worst. Tesla has got to stop shipping with such shit QC. Unreal.
"Take it in and demand it get resolved ASAP. If you get any refusal, return it."
Sounds like the seal around the front windshield is not sealed.
"Have had some noticeable odor on rainy days, probably the same issue the 3‚Äôs had with water sitting in the air intake area getting mildew‚Äôy but that‚Äôs insane, unacceptable, I would take it in and demand a loaner. Definitely collect video evidence"
Definitely take it in ASAP. That‚Äôs unacceptable QC!
FFS Tesla get your shit together
"After dealing with a few service reps from the company, I can tell they don‚Äôt have very high hiring standards."
"So much for the biohazard-level air filtration. What gives, Tesla?"
That‚Äôs all you can find in USA.
"And the instructions for replacing the cabin air filter yourself aren‚Äôt for the faint of heart. My service tech says if the smell kept happening to make an appointment and they could change out the desiccant bag, ultimately it sounds like a design issue. when you have a large horizontal area for water to accumulate on that routes to the air intake, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time..."
Fuck. I'm a huge Tesla fan and about to place an order for a Y early next year. This is so depressing.
"I would say it still doesn‚Äôt detract from my overall positive experience with the car, as it does take significant rain to get to this point and only smelled this way twice since June. Still concerning/surprising for a new car, supposedly a ‚Äúsoftware fix‚Äù was implemented to run the AC for some time after car is off to clear residual condensation or moisture in the system but that fix doesn‚Äôt seem effective. My 18 year old Volvo wagon had the same feature and was much more effective at clearing mildewy potential. Maybe a toggelable or rain sensor controlled ‚Äúmoisture clearing run cycle‚Äù after exiting car ?"
Next year? These issues are this year. Next year will be fine.
"I heard that about the paint quality, too."
GRATS MAN! We‚Äôre picking ours up at NJ next week. 63xxx as well!
"Curious, you're in New England and picked up in NJ for tax reasons?  Naively, I assume sales tax exemption?  If so, isn't the sales tax put back on the vehicle when registered if it was bought out of state?  I'm in CT, and no way they wouldn't collect.

(Apologies if I misinterpreted the above.)"
"Awesome. I just picked up mine in Springfield NJ on Tuesday. 

They sent me an email the night before letting me know exactly what to expect and answers to a few FAQs. 

I noticed 1-2 areas that were misaligned, but they told me to just schedule a service appointment when I get home. 

They are really trying to do the whole ‚Äúno contact‚Äù delivery, so expect all the conversations to happen by phone even tho they are inside.

EDIT: Adding some of the email that was sent to me. This is specific to this Springfield NJ location, so don't follow this for other location deliveries.

"New Hampshire has no sales tax. MA has SCs, but they charge sales tax even if you're registering in NH. For NJ and NY, they only care about where you end up registering, so no sales tax."
thanks a lot for this info. Did they help install the front and back plateholders along with the temp plate?
"I picked up at Paramus, and I was surprised at how much they interacted with me. The advisor was with me as I looked at the car. Once I signed & payed, he stood at the drivers window to help me get set up and walked through the basics with me."
"I am picking up from Springfield as well. How much time you spent there, is there long waiting?"
"Ah, thx.  You're in NH.  Makes 100% sense.

Massachusetts tax law....geez."
The temp plate in the rear was installed when I got there. They did not help me with the front plates.
do they accept personal checks or does it have to be certified bank cheques?
No wait at all. The car was parked on the side of the building when I got there. I was given all the time I wanted to inspect the car. We were there for about 1 hour as I inspected the car and finalized the paperwork.
They don't accept personal checks. I did an ACH payment from my bank on the website on the spot.
I was told that i could pay with a personal check.
"good to know they let you do it on the spot. we're going to paramus as well. I need to figure out how to pay the tolls on my way back home, without an ezpass lol"
"Could be an instance where my advisor didn't know what he was talking about. In any case, best to double check and be prepared."
"The Ys have exploded in my town now. 

I see like 2 or 3 every drive now. They're nearly on par with the 3 or 4 3s seen. Higher than the 1 or 2 Ss or Xs seen everyvdrive.


The Y is a mega hit"
Any refreshed model 3s?
Sometimes I wish I waited for white on white MY
Hell yes. I can‚Äôt wait to get mine!
"The Paramus SC actually has very few cars ‚Äúon the lot‚Äù.  From what I can tell, they only keep cars there for service or being delivered soon. Everything else is in an auxiliary lot behind the SC between the mall and office complex.

To answer your question, NO, there are no refreshed 3s yet.  There are a bunch of Model Ys and appears to be only 1 or 2 Model 3s left.  I drive past almost daily and when I see the first one I will post (likely on the Mode 3 sub)."
I actually didn't see any model 3's at all on this part of the lot - haha
Eh i dunno... never been a big fan of the white interior...  i'd be so afraid of getting it dirty.  black looks better to me anyway.
Picking up my 65*** tomorrow. Feeling VERY good about what I‚Äôm going to find.
Alignment looks very good
Nice car!! I‚Äôm 70k vin waiting delivery date.
"Plan on doing any ceramic coating or PPF? Or any other accessories like wrapping the center console?

About to take delivery on a similar Y"
üôèüèº
" Just got the car back from Vlad at Upper Class Detailing in Ottawa. Xpel ultimate plus Full front end, rear partial door, rear bumper ledge, all door sills,, 20% front window tint and ServFaces Ceramic coating. Car looks fantastic. Vlad said that it seems MSM and red are coming out the best for paint from factory. When I dropped the car off I said I look forward to seeing the finished product. He replied that ""I wouldn't be able to see a thing.""."
"Hey! I think I saw you the other day. Not many Ys here, yet. Our plates are just a few #s different, too."
"Did you do it yourself or did you pay to get it done? If the latter, where did you go?"
"will be lots around the city soon, now that I can spot the difference between a Y and a 3 I'm starting to recognize them all over. When I was picking mine up and transport came in with nothing by Y's."
"damn, I must have screwed up my comment. I'll add it."
I don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt do the Y over the 3 for the price point. AWD and heat pump are basically required here anyways.
I agree. Most people in Ottawa probably got the 3 because the Y wasn‚Äôt out yet. I went from a pathfinder to the Y. Perfect size now that the kids are leaving. It can fit the skis and tow hitch for bike rack.
For sure. And here I am on the other side of that. Hoping the Y will fit the growing family!
I think the rumor was always December for Y RWD along with heated steering wheel in 3 and Y.
Appreciate the tip. I‚Äôm going to reach out to my SA to see if I can switch to RWD. I don‚Äôt really need AWD so this would save me a good bit of change!
Oh my lanta is my RWD 7-seater finally coming?!
Don‚Äôt do this... don‚Äôt give me hope!
Best news I‚Äôve heard in a while! It‚Äôs been so long
I hope so. I've had my share of SA that have no clue. The one that helped me said they never accepted orders for RWD.
">  I think it‚Äôs about $4k less than AWD

It was $4k less than AWD, but currently speaking it‚Äôs $2k >_____<

Although you can‚Äôt get FSD for $6000 anymore :P"
I wonder why they called her.
Anyone know if the RWD Y will have the premium audio? I‚Äôm gonna be reallllly bummed if it doesn‚Äôt.
I have mixed feelings.. i do want my RWD.. but would like if maybe it had the new console from 3... not sure if Y would be getting it  any time soon
"Funny how every SA has their story about MY RWD.. two different ones gave me to different stories. This is from Tesla Mexico. One said I should expected it till the end of next year (yes end of 2021), and the other one said that they he things model might be cancelled because of no news. Its sad that Tesla wont give a stance of the current status to at least their employees so they can give accurate info to current reservation holders. I mean I think we as customers are more informed via Elon tweets than their SA staff"
Tesla is on track then! üòÅ
"Good luck, they may be calling all the old reservations first, but at least it should be coming into production soon if you‚Äôre not in a hurry.  

With the car still being long range, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be missing too much.  There just might be a speed difference, if I recall 0-60 in 5.5 sec instead of 4.8?   Car still has that instant acceleration so it‚Äôs still extremely fast."
She didn‚Äôt have 7 seat option selected.
"I sure hope so, waiting on it myself! Previous tweet said 7-seater starts manufacture this month and deliveries in December, curious how the 7-seater + RWD combo factors in"
It was probably before his time lol
No I think it will still be 4K less than current.  They told my friend the price dropped lower than what she reserved at.
Crazy the cost of FSD went up by 66% since the launch of Y.
It also helps to note my friend is near the Fremont factory.  And the reservation was made May of 2019 lol!
"You know what is funny, I never cared about a sound system in a car, but holy crap the sound system on the Y is leaps and bounds better than what I've ever listened to in a car...I guess I just found out what I've been missing..."
Same. Been wondering if rear seats will be heated.
"If heated steering wheel hits, I'm ordering.   After switching from a car with it to without it, i vowed not to purchase one without it again..... (I live in NE)"
"I'm sure you're right about old reservations coming first.  It never hurts to ask.  We'll see whats - we may end up going with the AWD. 

Thanks, again."
"The front motor accounts for about 40% of the total power. I don't have numbers for the normal LR since I bought the gear to measure after I bought the boost. With boost,  the dual motors makes 510hp, 400 lb-ft torque. The front motor makes 217 hp if that"
My guess is they will build only AWD 7 seaters to begin with. And of the AWDs they will build the ones with FSD first. Why build and sell cheaper cars when you can build and sell more expensive ones? Note OP has FSD.
"I am no audiophile by any means, but I LOVE music i really do. I currently own a 3 SR+ and the upgrade to the Y or the LR 3 would be almost worth it just in sound alone which is something I never thought I would say. It‚Äôs like when I finally got a good pair of headphones after using the little white apple headphones for like 12 years."
Rear seats are heated
"Same! One week in to my new MY (love it) and the only thing I‚Äôm missing is the heated steering wheel! How much do you think they‚Äôd charge for it, if they did it? I‚Äôm debating putting it on my Christmas list with a ‚Äúwhenever it‚Äôs available‚Äù stipulation"
Would love to know how this turns out!
Same..report back pls!
"That's fine with me. I don't tow, not into speeding. The increase in range will make up for it imo."
Yes totally agree that they will only build AWD 7-seater first - it‚Äôs more profit so it makes sense. Curious to see if they‚Äôll reach out to try and convince people to upgrade from RWD->AWD in this scenario....
The RWD? How do u know?
"Yeah, much better efficiency improvement over the LR dual motor awd.  I see some of the 3 SR+ getting impressive efficiency numbers at highway speeds. I'm expecting the RWD Y to hit 245-255 wh/mi at 70 mph vs the normal 265-270 on the LR with the 19"" Gemini"
"Rear seats are heated in both dual motor configurations.  No one knows exactly what the Rwd will have. I did have a RWD order from 2019, but cancelled it and bought the AWD instead. It had everything the AWD had except the front motor"
Damn this is clean af how did you do it
I see the underlined ‚ÄúDual motor‚Äù. LOVE THIS!
"Nice, you got lucky without the badge. I had to remove mine to do a chrome delete on the dual motor logo and do the TESLA letters on the hatch. Removing the badges and adhesive residue took about twice as long as actually putting the new badges on. I also added a ‚ÄúModel Y‚Äù badge opposite the Dual Motor one. Looks super clean."
Nice!
"Looks great,  I had my hatch and bumper painted from an accident couple months ago.. wish I thought of this!"
"Really, really nice.  Very clean."
Thanks. Got the abstract ocean Tesla letters and did it myself. Took 15 min at a gas station after I cleaned my car. Super easy if you have somewhat stable hands.
Do you have a price for repainting those two separately? Was it by Tesla service center?
