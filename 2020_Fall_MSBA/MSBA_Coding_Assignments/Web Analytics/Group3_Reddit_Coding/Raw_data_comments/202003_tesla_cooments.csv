"With WA state out as well, it makes me wonder how many Boeing is sitting on."
"What's the story here? Is Tesla donating some that were in their inventory, maybe originally for paint shop workers?"
Elon Mask
State of New York zooming in on the ‘Need More’ sign.
"Wonder what it says under ""Need More? Contact..."""
So Tesla isn't making masks right? I mean the boxes say 3M right there
" Wonder what new, inventive way  r/technology will come up with to hate on this"
"How long does a person wear a given mask?  Is it one a shift, multiple a shift?  Just curious how long some of these shipments will hold over various institutions."
That’s where I work. I know clinicians directly benefitting from this. Good stuff!
"Thank you Elon, very cool"
"Thanks Elon! For all the shit we give Billionaires, and it's mostly deserved, there are shining examples of what people with resources can to for the good of the world!"
Elon Mask
"My local pub closed it's doors and started producing hand sanitizer, why more company's have not stopped production and switched over to make much needed hospital products  is crazy."
"OP delivers, thanks for sharing this"
"If you want to be disappointed in humanity go read the Twitter responses from tslaq.

Holy crap you'd think Elon was punting babies instead of donating much needed masks

Ford, gm, and Razr(yes the computer gaming company), get a pass though apparently on making/donating masks and ventilators"
"Can anyone read the contact info on the side? Local hospitals in my area are suffering greatly and are in need of more supplies. 

Even a single box would be a miracle."
"Where are all the sporting team owners at with their masks from arenas and Colosseum, universities,  etc."
Did it show up on a Tesla semi?
I am a disabled Veteran and former poor homeless kid. Thank you Elon and Tesla. These are going to LA Municipal and LA Veterans Hospital as that is who UCLA health working with.

"Tesla the most CA company, makes rocket ships and electric cars. 3M (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing) the most MN company, makes Post It Notes and protective masks.
Que Soundgarden, https://youtu.be/uLZBhlTXHuo"
Isn’t Elon having his factories make ventilators as well?
"Elon Musk, thank you for all that you are doing trying to make this a better world. Keep up the amazing work."
So awesome
are you the way that he delivers it.
"“ We expect to have over ~1200 [vents] to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed & operating is the harder part.”"
"Does anyone here have a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR)?  If so, tell us about them!  Is yours made by 3M, and how often do you change the filter?  I see this nice model of PAPR.

Nice.
"u/SagaStrider

Indeed it is amazing he runs companies"
"This is super awesome, but comic sans on the note?"
Health care systems can’t you seen it?
Is that what you got out of what I said?
Are N95 masks maybe used in the paint shop
Anyone know how tesla got their hands on these? Did they produce it in house (somehow)? Did they pay suppliers to make this many?
Masks secured.
"For european, those are FFP3 mask"
Did he donate them or sell them?
OP you mind sending me the info on that contact form in a PM. I would like to contact Tesla for masks our hospitals have a shortage here too. Thank you OP!
*cuomo entering the the thread
This guy delivers his promises
Can we have some on Miami please :(
wow!
How necessary is it exactly to slap your own logo on these boxes?
It should be team world now not just LA.
Elon is a hero
Does anybody know why they are Team LA? Isn’t the factory in the SF Bay Area?
[deleted]
Not sure why they didn't distribute to local hospitals in the Bay Area.
"NEED MORE?

Elon Mask
Good for you Tesla 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"Hey Elon, we could really use your help back here in your home country.. remember? South Africa?"
So does Tesla own 3m or are their parts manufactured in 3ms factory?  What is the relationship between the two companies?
Of course he had to put his logo on the box.
Is that the guy who said Covid19 was just a cold and refused to stop the factories from running?
[deleted]
Of course slapped with a fat Tesla logo..
I don't understand. How did he get these? The hospitals being out isn't an issue of simply ordering more it is an inventory issue. So where did Tesla get these?

Are they just the middle men or did they actually manufacture this themselves?
"While Ford delivers SN95 masks, but doctors don't know what to do with a bra for a 98 mustang gt"
"People have been shitting on Elon over his statements on the virus and keeping his plants running but all his businesses are essential to the human species, this planet and our future altogether. I made a bet two weeks ago he would either supply the homeless with Teslas to live in or produce Face Masks / Respirators and other necessary supplies in mass. The flyer on the side of those gaylords say “NEED MORE?” And supplies resources for more."

Sounds like a good time to buy Tsla...
"Totally lame. He didn't use self-driving cars to deliver them. Think of your shareholders, Elon. This would have been an excellent PR move, but now it's a regular act of kindness. Pulling all my Tesla stocks immediately. I have no faith in the future of this company. /s"
"While this is super awesome Musk made it sound like Tesla was going to MAKE masks not donate them.  This isn’t making the 1000 ventilator promise look good.

Edit: I really hope you Tesla fan bois don’t end up at a hospital that was promised a “Tesla” ventilator and didn’t get it"
Stop with the fascist slogan. It didn’t work for Mussolini and it didn’t work for Hillary.
"Wow Elon is so generous, I wonder if he'll now allow his workers to ask for better conditions without threatening to fire them"
*Thiiiiis is a Tesla Model Y performance ...*
N95 is the best mask to use... any others are to just make the person feel protected.
Now if they only stop blocking supercharging on aftermarket repaired vehicles then we can agree they're not just another greedy mega company that only cares about profit while making headline grabbing gestures to disguise the fact.
"The didn't make them, just sold them to the hospital. The factory was ordered to shut down anyways."
Elon Musk: you're welcome! Just make sure you show our logo in the pictures!
[deleted]
This is just a PR stunt after Elon was called out for downplaying coronavirus and saying Tesla employees are essential workers.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Love the donations and all but shouldn’t the hospital be reimbursing Tesla for these? It’s not like they’re in need of money. They just don’t have a supply.
The cocos-19 virus is smaller than what the N95 mask can filter...
"But the masks dont really do anything to protect you... I'm not sure why everyone is obsessed with them. Similar to all the TP everyone is hoarding, idgi"
"Didn’t he do this for PR reasons? 
That bald bitch was getting to him."

"See muppets, he's not evil"
"Why doesn't VW, Ford, GM, Toyota and others do the same?"
"TeamLA, eh? Hopefully everyone remembers that."
Errrr.... and 3M?
The N95 masks won’t protect anyone.  This is really depressing.
"I play for #TeamAmerica. Is that OK, or is that very un-PC?"
"meanwhile to tesla employees.  ""Sorry guys no mask, just continue working with the toxic fumes""

geez people it was a joke."
"Anything for the headlines.

Do more, asshole."
They had to get rid of their stockpile last year to make room for all the Max 8s.

They’re not ‘sitting on’ anything. It’s their previously purchased supply caches they still need for business. It’s not Boeing’s responsibility to bail out private hospitals.
"It’s probably because of a recent change to the law that allows these Masks to be given to hospitals.  3m makes masks for hospitals and masks for automotive purposes. Normally you can’t use industrial 3m N95 masks for medical purposes. 

“The law, signed Wednesday, will let U.S. manufacturers sell N95 masks made for industrial uses to hospitals without fear of liability”

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/19/change-us-law-will-make-millions-more-masks-available-doctors-nurses-white-house-says/"
[deleted]
3M is just M3 backwards. So these are model 3 masks.
"That can't be right. You don't use N95 for automotive paint work. 

N95 means *not* resistant to oils or vapor. 

You need P95/100 for painting did to the vapors and oils used.

The N95 masks are probably used by Tesla  workers in areas exposed to increased dust, such as grinding."
"Not for paint shops (they use a higher grade of respirator, not these masks), but yeah basically

These are industrial masks used to protect from dust and particulate matter, but are pretty similar to medical masks just without the medical certification - in this crisis, that certification requirement has been relaxed somewhat"
You’d think that part would be automated 🤔
Plenty of companies seem to have them. Mercedes and VW and some suppliers also donates them in large numbers.
"Painting used P95 masks not N95 masks, please spread the word because I still need to paint and everyone is buying the wrong masks."
In the Bay Area big tech is doing the same. They have lots of masks stocked for wild fires that they are now donating to local hospitals.
Yes after claiming corona was a nothingburger.
"Tesla had been donating these masks and other medical needs to a few places now, not only in CA"
Something like this. Manufacturing would take some time to set up.
"Donating them because he kept his factory open to the last possible minute with total disregard to care of his workers and now that it has to be shut down by order, he can save face and look like the good guy."
"President approved GM, Ford, and Tesla to start using their factories to make ventilators this morning.

Edit: masks≠ventilators"
The real story is Elon is back peddling on his refusal to close the Tesla plant. He is now playing a game to get his reputation back. I’ll never buy a Tesla or support any business of his. He cares about himself and no one else.

Nice.
Nice.
Mask is worm in Swedish. 🤔
Treelon Mask.
Just going out and doing his Elon Task.
"I was doing that too... There's a shortage here in Chicagoland too.  Local EMS posting on reddit asking if anyone has any leads. Hospitals putting out bulletins asking.  I actually suggested they tweet Elon Musk and personally visit the local Tesla dealer to get them to help but that post was down-voted.

&#x200B;

In other places they're now asking the community to make DIY cloth ones in bulk to donate, but they've already ran out of elastic."
Probably gives contact information. Wild guess tho.
Same same my wife’s hospital needs a ton. Lots of cases in her unit and they don’t have enough n95 so management is saying use surgical. Also the disposable gown things aren’t in her size anymore so she’s about [five feet tall walking around in an oversized clown costume](https://i.imgur.com/Br8yIKx.jpg)
"""The picture wont be able to read this text so fuk you guys we ain't sending any more"""
"""Contact your supplier four months ago since you're a responsible hospital."""
it's the info for Dirty Mike & the Boys
"If you zoom in all the way, you can see Elon's phone #"
"contact:
Emusk@tesla.com"
"Correct. Tesla uses them for their factory workers. Since the factories are shut down anyway, might as well put the masks to good use for humanity. :)"
Right. Delivering extra masks that they had. But they plan do actually make ventilators
"Yeah, everyone that has these masks for other purposes have been making an effort to donate them to relevant health centers.  Basically every lab at my university has done the same - these are great gestures but the unfortunate reality is that we're very rapidly scraping the barrel here while production tries to catch up."
Actually it’s WƐ
Why would you think Tesla is making 3M masks? A completely different company....
Why would you think they make masks?
“He should’ve done it three months ago!”
[deleted]
shoulda seen the tweets... so much bullshit being spread
Just look at some comments on Twitter. So much hate on them....
> Billionaire hordes live saving medical equipment until called out then donates them to look good.
"I got in a [discussion](https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fn7dxc/_/fl8o7hk/?context=1) with someone in r/coronavirus yesterday who complained that 50,000 wasn’t enough because we needed “millions”. So I guess it’d be better if they did nothing.

Edit: they, not we"
"They will probably claim the masks don’t work, nobody asked for them and that Elon should shove the pallets of mask where the sun never shines.

Disclaimer: Not my personal opinion, so if Elon reads this? It’s a joke, not twitter material. I will see myself out."
“He called someone a mean name on Twitter once”
He did try to keep his employees in Fremont to go to work even after the lock down. He even downplayed the virus in the email he sent out to employees.
"Given that he’s been pretty against taking any of this seriously? 

He tweeted that he thought the panic was overblown (which you can interpret two ways) and that he didn’t think he’d need to make ventilators at a time when several countries were coming up with ways to make ventilators be used by more than one person at a time... because there weren’t enough... 

I’m not sure how people can like him. He has done good but only after the fact and only because he’s been proven wrong several times and won’t publicly admit it. I’m happy he’s finally helping but let’s not pretend he’s a nice guy. He is responding to society pressure. 

Look through his late February/early March Twitter feed: he’s entitled."
[deleted]
Others closed voluntarily and He waited until he was forced to close down his factory. That’s why people were hating him. They weren’t hating him out of thin air.
"What I don't get is how Tesla can have a better 3M supply chain than healthcare systems.

Working from a limited ressource point of view, surely the fastest.way to get those to thenwprlers are through already established supply chains?

Where did Tesla find those mask? Did that order go from 3M to Tesla to the health workers? 

I have a lot of questions for all the company seemingly finding masks to deliver and even more questions to 3M..."
[deleted]
"He’s just donating masks, didn’t  make them?"
Imagine liking Elon Musk
"Giving away the PPE his staff would need, confirmed the factory is closing. TSLAQ /s"
this is advertising (i just like this company so im ok with it)
How does Musk's dick smell? Musky?
he’s not gonna fuck you man
"It’s supposed to be 1 per patient incident. So theoretically every time someone enters a patient room, the mask and gown get tossed in the trash. Now? Not so much."
I saw a news report with a doctor saying up to 50 per shift.....
"I think they are supposed to be used for one shift, possibly only for one patient. But front line workers are already using them longer than that, and trying to clean them. It’s terrifying!"
"No official guidance.  Each hospital might have its own rules.  Technically speaking, they can be reused for a long time as long as they stay dry and clean."
I got a mask that says 100 hours
God bless you guys!
Very legal
"So he donated masks but hasn’t made anything, why didn’t he do it before?"
ElonEl!
Don’t shift this responsibility to people who don’t make this product to begin with. That’s asinine. ‘Why don’t companies get new patents and millions of dollars of equipment to make something they’ve never made ever and produce it all right now without any testing or business plans?!’
I heard we have a disaster production bill in the works where businesses will have to do just that
"A craftbrew place in my hometown started making hand sanny for truckers, grocery staff, and health care professionals. 

A distillery in the area are also making a cleaning-proof alcohol bottled in spray bottles. 

Local companies are stepping their game up everywhere."
Huh

"Yes, he met [with Medtronic](https://mobile.twitter.com/Medtronic/status/1241459765047222272) and they’re starting production [in 8-10 weeks.](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/03/21/elon-musk-should-have-1000-ventilators-next-week-250k-n95-masks-for-hospitals-tomorrow-cleantechnica-exclusive/)"
"No, he just talked about maybe doing it. 

Actually doing it wouldn't be his style."
"Doubtful - I'm no expert, put anything relating to paint requires at minimum a half face respirator with organic vapor cartridges. These are usually P100 rated - no idea what the difference between that and N95 is though."
they likely used them in their factories which are now shut down by governor's orders
"Oh ok let’s send one box to each country and let them figure it out from there, awesome idea"
"Elon/Tesla tried to argue their employees were essential personnel. He is not a hero. He's doing what he can to repair Tesla's image after getting egg on his face. 

Building cars/batteries for those cars are not essential. To his business, sure, but not to society at this point in time.

I like Elon, but he's not the second coming of tech Jesus for Christ sake"
No he’s actually contributed to the problems so far by downplaying the virus. Even saying the panic would cause more deaths than the virus. His contrarian approach is not helpful in times like this.
Yes but UCLA is in.... LA.
"Are you in a locked down state/area? IE NY, SF, LA, etc?

Smaller cities and rural areas are not having shortages like large cities and those on lockdown with limited workers and delivery trucks.

Here in Los Angeles every delivery company is begging people to work because they can’t keep up with demand and loss of sick/burnt out workers."
"We use masks/hand sanitizer/ full PPE everyday. Absolutely no shortage, literally semi truck trailers at different fire stations holding all of this for these exact situations, and storage rooms full at every station. No shortage of getting any restock either."
"there is absolutely a shortage in the coastal cities

I have friends who are nurses and doctors who were told to use the same PPE and masks for the entire day

not only does it put them at risk, but also the patients they see"
‘cos IBM gave 15K masks to a local hospital on Friday?<shrug>
Good question. The bay area has the biggest outbreak in the state. I'm guessing it was sent to LA because Elon lives in LA and so that is more important to him.
Tesla bought these from 3M before the need became great. Their plants are clean areas. This was in their store rooms.
"They almost certainly use lots of mask in their factories -- which are now more or less closed, so they had a bunch of them lying around they could send to UCLA."
[deleted]
Yup. Are you enjoying these commercials on his behalf that keep getting upvoted to the front page?
I can assure you I’ve only received a gold plated Model S for being a shill
"N95s have non-medical uses, paint shops for example."
From inventory. Lots of industries have use for N95s.
I have two N95 masks in my garage. I bought them in January for airbrushing models. They are way more common than I originally thought.
"I think it is just what you said, inventory Tesla donated."
Possibly from the painting employees?
"He's riding around on his horse stealing them. People are so shocked to see Elon Musk riding a horse demanding their masks they just give them up. Modern day Robin Hood. 

Engage other parts of your brain once in a while man. The guy's got multiple companies all of which have safety equipment as part of the business. He's donating surplus."
N95 masks are used in a lot of different fields too.  I kept some stocked at home for any activities that involve a lot of dust. Included a box in my emergency bag too.
"N95s are used in all sorts of industries, and technically medical grade N95s are different than the non-medical ones (but for the current situation, the non-medical ones are fine)."
They paint cars... car paint is toxic so they have wear masks.
[deleted]
">supply the homeless with Teslas to live in

Well there it is, the dumbest goddamn thing I've seen on the internet all day."
"Supply the homeless with Teslas to live in...LOL wow. I'm impressed with your imagination, it's child-like."
"Luxury/mid-luxury vehicle production isn't essential during the outbreak phase of a pandemic.  Non-cosmetic repair parts and stuff should keep getting made.

If this thing goes on long enough capital intensive businesses making certain things like cars may make sense to open before other non-essential stuff, just due to the machine capital/labor ratio and producing real utility.  But definitely not during an initial lockdown."
"Nope, but it's good to check these things."
N95 masks won’t even make up 1% of total 3M income this year. They are a massive company that produces almost every product category you could imagine.
du har rätt men du kan inte ha min pengarhack
A 5 year old could figure that out. Oh wow you're telling me a mask company will do well in a pandemic? Wow!!!
"He really didn't make it seem that way, he just said ""we have tons of masks"" (i forget the exact number).  It was other people who then took that and ran saying things like Tesla was making them."
"The 1000 ventilator promise is almost surely his supply chain people using some not-so-typical contacts that weren't available to the federal/state governments.

The Chinese government likes Tesla due to the money they spent on their Chinese gigafactory, and has the infection mostly under control - to the point of shutting down all of their emergency hospitals.  The Chinese government is going to tell any US government entity to go pound sand with the current geopolitical climate.

This assumes that the ventilators are actually the type we need, as opposed to the kind of trauma ventilators you see people hand-pumping on TV shows after someone gets shot.  In which case, he could have gotten them anywhere because those kind of ventilators aren't what hospitals are looking for at all."
we're you born in 7 months? he doesnot have Harry potters wand to create ventilators out of thin air.
Just about any kind of mask helps make *you* less likely to infect *others*.
This isn’t a thread about your shitty or lack of insurance. UCLA has crazy awesome medical breakthroughs every year. Fuck off.
Honestly dont get the Downvotes people were roasting him the other day and now if you say anything bad it's the opposite? I dont get it but he's an asshole I think its unanimous
"Finally?! Ya do know he makes electric cars in pursuit of reducing carbon emissions from driving [ice cars] to prevent global warming from making the Earth inhospitable to humans, right? Are u doing moar?"
I can assure you I’ve only received a gold plated Model S for being a shill
"Well no, because they ordered the mask for employee use during car manufacturing as always, but since most employees are staying home now they have overstock, and those masks cost literally nothing but are out of stock in most other places. So there really wouldn’t be much to reimburse them with"
Good thing these masks are for covid-19 then.
"It's to protect medical professionals. They are the ones who need them, along with the ones with compromised immune systems."
These masks cost nothing. A single roll of Dual Lock tape is worth far more than multiple cases of masks.
They are. GM is also working with ventilator manufacturers to help with parts acquisition and logistics.
"GM and Ford are too, that’s all I’ve heard"
Get over yourself.  Tesla has a major plant in the LA metro area.  They're helping their community.
You're literally being PC police over the term 'team LA'.
"Maybe Tesla sent its excess masks, and not all of them?"
"Or you know, maybe they have less employees working right now.."
"Uhh, not true. They’re still being given masks."
"The factory is shut down right now, so they won't be needing these masks"
"Don’t cut yourself on that edge, kid"
Ooof!
"I think it was from the neutral angle that Boeing is by far the largest manufacturing employer in Washington state and they are extremely likely to have lots of N95s on hand. No other company in the troubled state of Washington would have the ability to help with the N95 shortage at the scale of Boeing. If they haven’t done so already, it’s a really good idea."
[deleted]
"It’s not the Taxpayers responsibility to spend 60 billion to bail out Boeing, but here we are. The least they could do is give up some masks."
"F!ck, tho, it is our responsibility to help others."
This is the worst thing I’ve ever read on reddit
Yea the CDC is relaxing guidelines because of the emergency and shortage. They're also instructing how to use bandanas etc.
https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1794572O/surgical-n95-vs-standard-n95-which-to-consider.pdf
Construction companies are donating their stocks too.
"To add to this, using industrial masks sure beats the alternative:

Why are you answering yes to a question that didn't make sense
"Oh, well I was gonna say I was extremely surprised that Elon made good on his promise to start manufacturing them “if there was a shortage” but this makes more sense."
3M = 3lon Musk. Illuminati confirmed.
3M upside down is WE
If you wear them on your eyes you see the HUD
"If anyone's wondering what it actually stands for, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3 M's)"
Hope they fixed the panel gaps on these ones.
I thought this had something to do with the BMW M3

[3m is the massive chemical and filtration and adhesive company which made these masks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M)
"N95 are used in auto body, mechanics, and other shops...
For dust, grinding, body filler working, paint sanding, and other things.
Big shops auto body shops may use 20 plus N95 per week.
With the right jobs one person may use 1 or two per day.

There are higher filtration masks for the application of paints/primers etc."
You would use N95 for sanding or paint prep. P95 for painting.
Exactly. The CDC has confirmed that N95 masks are appropriate PPE for healthcare workers in direct contact with Covid-19 patients.
Wow. You fuck
Lol I hope that tesla does not make their workers running grinders and sanders wear surgical masks. Every automotive facility I have ever been in has those workers wear full suits with positive pressure lines. Just a mask seems like it would be no where near the proper level of protection.
Could also be related to battery production...
"I work in Museum, they were used and stockpiled by our preparators who are like tradies, they make a few wooden things, paint some walls with eco friendly paints, and hang artwork."
Sad thing is we need ppe more then ventilators. Ventilators have to be monitored by trained medical personnel.
"They don't require approval, they aren't manufacturing these yet and these are clearly made by 3M."
I don't care. The N95 mask will help save lives. Action is better than words. Now you should act on your words and start listing the CEO who only care about themselves and no one else then boycott their companies without exemption. Half measure will do nothing. I will help you Jeff Bezo's certainly fit the description so boycott Amazon.

"We don’t even have those. I had a consult the other day on a COVID rule out and I was provided a disposable trauma eye shield, surgical mask and a yellow paper gown."
They don't stockpile them like this because medical grade masks have expiration dates. They have to keep throwing them out and rebuying them.
"Wuhan is where a lot of them were manufactured. Between China making them and then China using a lot of them, the world was in a shortage before the virus escaped China. The country as a whole should have had a better plan before a pandemic existedeyojd having 3 days worth of masks in national stockpiles."

"It is hard for me to imagine how this could be true in any reasonable sense.  Maybe helping assemble parts or something?  ""Making"" as in manufacturing parts seems impossible to spin up that fast."
"It’s more we’ll intentioned nonsense from Musk. Complex medical equipment can’t be made so easily. Industry experts said it would realistically take 12-18 months for them to be made by a manufacturer (Tesla)who hasn’t made them before. Plans, materials, specialized  parts you can’t just materialize those things over night."
Elon said a couple days ago that Tesla was ready to make them if asked.

Everyone is allowed their own opinion. He wasn't / isn't the only one that shares that belief. Why care so much about what someone else thinks?"

Doctors are talking about going through months and months of supplies in a week because everyone has to be in full PPE right now compared to normally there is a much larger ability to contain the situation and the number of patients who require PPE to treat is much lower

I'd assume almost every company that is donating masks had a stockpile they've acquired over the last few years for whatever reason. Tesla is an automotive company, so they'd use them on their lines in certain places, they probably place large orders in bulk and slowly go through them as needed which means they probably have large boxes full just lying around in storage"

"How many times do we have to go through this? 

Manufacture of transportation and energy is considered critical for security and prosperity of United States. The government did not force Tesla to shut down. In fact if you read the shelter in place documentation published by California's governor, it mentions that all businesses are essential according to what is deemed so by CISA. So all that banter between the county and Tesla was just nonsensical drama with a major dash of personal opinion. 

Please refer to the official government site and read it for yourself exactly what is considered to be essential business sectors. 

https://www.cisa.gov/critical-manufacturing-sector"
"Now, I'm no expert on this, so do take this with bit of salt. 

I'd assume that almost every business that can try to argue that they are essential, will argue such. It costs a measurable sum of money to have a factory or business just hang out doing nothing at all. So naturally, they would argue that because: 1 they can, and 2 vehicles and methods of transportation could indeed be ""essential"". I'm not saying I agree or disagree with that statement, but I can see it being argued for.

Also, I'm pretty sure we all know that Elon pays little to no attention about ""getting egg on his face"" (and when he does note something like that, his reactions are a little more... explosive.)"
The damn cars already in hot demand and they aren't producing it enough. Stopping production would mean their cars would further delay when this outbreak dies down.
here in Illinois they're pretty much exhausted on them now but not due to delivery truck drivers.. it's not like there's a warehouse somewhere where they are stockpiled even.  3M's supply chain went to complete shit and stores here haven't received them in over a month. everything out of china had been consumed and nothing shipping back.

"But I'm saying N95 masks don't really do anything, especially anything a regular ass dust mask wont do. Your eyes need to be covered as well, and you need to be wearing them properly which I've seen way too many people not. It's not airborne, as long as things aren't spraying at your face you don't need to worry. 

Your hands are what you need to be worried about, that's what transmits it to you. Touching surfaces and then your face, eyes, mouth, (to adjust your N95 mask for example) is what gives you it. Also gloves do absolutely nothing either which I think irritates me even more.

N95 were issued in my St John's ambulance kit...
"Yes, autobody, mechanics and other shops - that's what I said. 

Not paintwork - like you said. 

Paintwork you need filtration for vapors. 

You're taking to someone who paints here. 

If I used N95 id probably get sick pretty fast from the fumes."
Tesla rocks.....and are good people......i wish i could afford one.
I work in a steel mill on EAFs and the average guy will go through 4 or 5 masks per shift. They get so loaded down with dust and sweat they become uncomfortable and unusable.
Could that be eliminated with down draft filtration?
"Yes, but that wasn't my point. You said these are probably from Tesla paint workers. 

They cant be. They are N95. They are probably from workers who are in dustry areas that grind metal etc. 

The Tesla paint workers will be using masks that protect from vapor and oils, not N95."
"The CDC is retarded. N95 masks allow about 5% of particulates through the mask or around the mask which has less air resistance. Thousands of Chinese medical workers have been infected trying to treat covid-19 patients.

Adequate protection would be n100 or preferably p100 masks and sealed eye protection."

In the regular units they’re on lot keeping people with pending results in isolation rooms so the nurses only have surgical masks there. Most of the confirmed patients that are alert and oriented are sent home for self quarantine. 

This is a city hospital in NYC though so there’s a ton of confirmed cases moving throughout the hospital. My wife was actually on the news like a week ago when there were like 12 cases saying that nurses need N95 masks at a minimum but I guess that isn’t working."
Dude Tesla’s factories aren’t like fords in the 1950s. There’s a guy every couple of meters and the machines do everything
"Be honest here:  sitting in a factory making metal parts and large pieces of equipment is hardly conductive to spreading disease.  There is some fairly considerable distance between employees, and that distance can even be increased together with face masks, handwashing stations, and other reasonable precautions as well.

Riding on a bus is a bigger deal, since you would be much closer to one another and could far more easily transmit disease from one person to another in close proximity.  If that is the case, perhaps public transit should be shut down and that should be your complaint here?

Having worked in manufacturing myself, I just don't see the problem given the large degree of autonomous equipment Tesla is using.  The overall density of employees per square meter is generally quite low, certainly lower than would be the case in a cubicle farm or worse yet in a K-12 school (which makes sense why those have been closed down)."
"Why hasn’t the governor shut down everything then? I mean everyone one who can is working here is MN still... maybe the ones we have no work from home option.. I’m confused here..

I’m glad you aren’t deleting this. Don’t let all these speculative investors push you around
"This is Elon Musk, together with a bunch of currently unemployed factory workers that would like to do something positive with their time instead of collecting unemployment/vacation checks.  They also have a pretty big factory that can take raw metal and plastic in one door and spit out finished equipment out the other end of the factory.

Compared to automobiles, a ventilator is quite simple to both manufacture and even design.  It would take retooling some parts of the existing factory, but that is idle equipment anyway."
[deleted]
"They’re not going to create one, no. Just like GM didn’t design bombers, and IBM didn’t design the M1 Carbine. If something happens, it’ll be them making components and/or assembling them as intended by the company that engineered the item. Basically following instructions. Tesla is probably the best suited company to be able to make such a radical change in their lines, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see others fully capable in a short period of time. 

Obviously regulatory details would need to be fast tracked, or abandoned, for things to really start making sense."
"They have stuff like it for space X life support systems. 

Cars also have parts that are similar like your air filtration systems. 

But their partnering with Medtronic to get something official"
"Tesla is in a pretty unique position for that. That are largely vertically integrated and so for much of their manufacturing, raw stock rolls in and cars come out.  Not on everything obviously, but on enough components that they might well have all the component infrastructure to manufacture plastic pieces and hoses and valves and filters and motors and electronics etc. from raw stocks that are still available."
You would be surprised what they can build.
"Tesla has the necessary filters and SpaceX has lifesupport, whether they will get approved or not, I don't know."
It's not crazy to think that it's possible.  Cars are incredibly complex devices so they have a vast array of manufacturing capabilities. Plus they make filters which pump air and filter air.
they built a submarine in just a few days didn’t they?
"My best guess is what they actually end up doing is moving some automotive production equipment into a storage shed or retooling it, and then let the ventilator company use the factory floor space that would have been shut down due to work restrictions, low demand, etc. from the outbreak. I don't see them as really being Tesla-Brand Ventilators so much as Ventilator Company Brand Ventilators, produced in Tesla-owned spaces."
"What do mean? Industrial CNC and 3d printers can make the molds and various parts to adjust a production line fairly quickly if you have the plans.

Modern manufacturing like Tesla does is very different than the older factories."
"Well, with a full engineering and manufacturing line, the ventilators are actually within the wheelhouse to produce. A shared design would be supplied to Tesla MFG Eng department, who will have a design team made up of mechanical engineers spin out injection molding die part designs.

These parts are sent to the machinist team who will create tooling dies based on the design. Once these are complete (usually within 2-3 days each) they are sent to the MFG line for installation in the corresponding Injection Molding tools. Once they're installed, there is an event called Proto where they vet the process for issues by running a FOE to find process parameters based on Best Known Methods (supplied by same Corp as who supplied the original part designs to Tesla), and then there is an initial batch and test them for quality. There are three phases, Engineering Validation, Design Validation, and Production Validation.

Each validation checkpoint requires a threshold number of units to be passed through quality before entering the next phase. After PV, the line is commissioned and Mass Production can start. After PV has been passed, the line is in maturity, and can be stopped and restarted anytime, without re-entering the Production Develolment phases. The process of re-entering production with a part that has previously passed PV is called Line Bring-Up and involves sampling a few parts and running them through QA, and reporting the results to the manufacturing team."
"It’s going to take [8-10 weeks](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/03/21/elon-musk-should-have-1000-ventilators-next-week-250k-n95-masks-for-hospitals-tomorrow-cleantechnica-exclusive/) before they’re able to start production but they’re working together with the ventilator company [Medtronic](https://mobile.twitter.com/Medtronic/status/1241459765047222272).

Medtronic has the expertise and Tesla has the factories and the manpower. They’ll get this done."
Why not?  They setup an entire factory from a dirt lot to making cars in 10 months time.
"I felt the same way, but it normally takes 10 years to design/build/launch a satellite and Elon went from concept to finished satellite in less than a year. 

I doubt these will be fancy vents. Probably basic but pneumatic models. At this point we just need something that can move air and keep people alive."

"Yes, creating a bunch of expensive cars that only a small portion of the nation will be able to purchase, even when the economy was up, is definitely critical /s.

When they're talking about transport and ship manufacturing, do you *really* think their intent was a fucking passenger car? No, I believe the intent was for actual manufacturing of logistics transportation, i.e semi-trucks or whatever is needed for their maintenance, repair, or to support that industry. 

I'll admit you have a point on the energy side of things. I'd argue their car batteries shouldn't be included but the powerwalls should be.

These critical sectors were probably created to guard against conventional attacks against our infrastructure. There's no public health risk in those cases. With COVID, having thousands of people working on a fucking high-end car potentially spreading it even further is absurd and arguing for such a position seems ignorant to me.

"I believe we only had like 1000 on hand. We‘ve distributed a bunch to the workers for them and their families and then keeping the rest on hand for anyone who wants to use them at work, as we’re a small company so we’re all probably gonna have to work through this whole mess. No sick leave, no paid time off, nothing."
"Good idea. And xtheory, even if you don’t have any masks to donate, if you have any extra money to spare, you may want to donate it to your local Red Cross, anything to help out in these times will go a long way."

"I always wear my half mask respirator instead of N95 dust masks when doing any work requiring lung protection.

So many times I've been asked ""why do you wear that thing, isn't it uncomfortable?""

No, it actually fits my face, is made of soft silicone, and most importantly *it has a proper exhaust valve that vents my steamy breath away from my face*

Wearing an N95 mask while doing any sort of physical work is like wearing a little sauna on your face."
"Depends on the country. The cheapest new Tesla you can buy in New Zealand (with no options) is $78,000. To get any of the cool features you’re looking at $90,000."
"That's based on total cost of ownership. Which includes resale value retention over 5 years. It has no basis in actual affordability. 

The difference between $24,000 and $40,000 up front and in monthly payment is a large gap that makes it entirely unfeasible to compare. 

Even at 0% a $39,990 model 3 would be $665 per month. A $24,000 Camry is $400. Most people aren't going to cross shop them. Regardless of the fuel and maintenance differences. Finding an extra almost $300 a month for their car payment isn't realistic for most people."
"Yep. I did the math on a model Y a while back. After 2 years I'd be paying the same if I bought a $30,000 gas car at the rate I drive.

(I put 30k-40k a year on my current car)

This killed the Kia Niro EV for me. $44k for ""premium"" features and less range than a $48k base model model Y or model 3.

I do respect Kia for creating platforms that work for hybrid, gas, and EV. it's forward thinking and smart. But they need to offer more for the price. (better range and drivetrain)

Tesla right now is beating everyone hands down."
"A Camry is cheaper than a model 3 now. The calculations where they show it costs the same was for a person who drives a lot and spends $3.50 on gas. Gas near me is $1.55 a gallon now.

It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense for hospitals to purchase them in February if they only became legal to use on March 18th.  
  
Edit: Found it myself from the Washington Post. It looks like the law is to absolve manufacturers of any blame when they directly sell to hospitals. Retailers of these masks(i.e. my company) have already been able to do this without issue for weeks."

"Is that AUS or US dollars?

While we're at it, tell Reddit how much a pack of cigarettes cost down under mate."
"Yeah, but a gas is very expensive there. \~$2/litre. So a Litre gets you about 14 km in a Camry. That's about $0.14/km in fuel or $14/100km. 

A Tesla uses about 15 kWh to get 100 km. A kWh costs about $0.20-$0.25 in NZ. Lets take the most expensive ($0.25/kWh). That's only $3.75/100km. So roughly $10/100km saved.

So for fuel, over 300,000km, a Model 3 would save roughly $30,000. That pays for a lot of car."
"You have to look at the TCO (Total Cost Of Ownership) That means what is the 5-year cost for the car including payments, Fuel, Maintenance and other things. Yeah, the Tesla is more expensive to buy, BUT no oil changes, No tuneups, longer intervals between brake jobs and other misc. things. Add up every dime you would end up spending on each car and divide that by how many months you will have the car. In some cases the Tesla will come out cheaper in the long run."
"Unless you drive a lot. Then factor in gas to that equation. Gas is a monthly expense. Also, resale value for the Model 3 is up there, maybe even surpassing the Camry (we'll have to wait 5 years to tell for sure). 

Sure, if you buy a bare bones Camry, it might have a TCO about the same as a Model 3. Which is pretty terrible, because a bare bones Camry is a pretty crappy car compared to a base Model 3. In other words, if you gave 10 people a choice between the two cars, 9 out of 10 would choose the Tesla."
">Not to mention that if I drove a lot, I’d prefer a Camry. Tesla has alright quality, but nothing comes close to Toyota reliability.

Have you driven both? Camry's are BOOOORING. And to get near the same features (leather seats, autopilot, navigation, HP), it has to be optioned up to well past $30k, which makes the total cost of ownership a little more than a Tesla. Even if gas is $1.55 (which we all know isn't going to last).

And for reliability, there isn't any evidence that the Model 3 is any worse than a Toyota. If you can find a real statistical source that says otherwise, I'd believe you. Otherwise, it's all anecdotal blah blah. Aside from that, I haven't heard of any systemic issues with the Model 3 (like the transmission in the Ford Focus). 

But I guess some people like boring cars. ;)"
oh boy. Sending my regards before the tesla fury (downvotes).
Can you link that calculation?  The ones that come up via a google search don’t use $3.50/gallon or an unreasonable amount of miles.
"I’m not disagreeing, but I do know that there are a lot of costs with an engine Teslas don’t have (RIP my German car). So I have to imagine even a reliable Camry requires oil changes, brakes (more often), and other work an electric doesn’t."
"$1.55 a gallon.. for now. We're in the midst of an oil war. As soon as it's over, expect prices to go through the roof. Especially if Russia wins the price war."
Boi thinks camry is more reliable than a 3
"It truly depends on how much you drive though. If your doing 16 to 20k miles a year that's a lot of gas saved every month which reduces the $200 to $250 a month difference in payments.

Sadly...it's going to be quite a while till I can TCO my way to a Tesla considering my current vehicle gets 45mpg lol."
"And spend $15k more in gas in the Camry over it's lifetime. Maybe you are thinking in terms of just monthly payment, but that's the worst way to buy a car."
And you know what’s an even better deal? a 1-2 year old camry that you can drive for the next 10 years.

The governor of NY is requiring that people over 70 wear masks when exposed to other people.  He wants to limit the demands on hospitals. I'm an average person over 70.  I have to shop for food.
"I have asthma and I have a pet that needs to be walked daily. If I start wearing my vogmask daily outside, it’s because I have to be outside. Think about other people’s circumstances. Some people may be forced to work while immunocompromised, others may have no one to grocery shop for them."

"Yeah but the price of the cheapest Camry and $30,000 in petrol is still $25,000 less than a Tesla. Our government could be doing more with EV rebates. 

I agree that a Tesla is worth the money, my only point is until it’s initially cheaper here, our people CAN’T change yet."
"Bro, you don’t have to convince me. Had a test drive 3 weeks ago, put down the deposit, and it’s arriving around September. I was only making a point that the initial cost here is scary as fuck for our median income families. 

I look forward to not dealing with maintenance companies and mechanics, finally."
"Not true, tco also includes resale value, which heavily favors Tesla, but it's also not realistic for people to ditch their 5 year old car for a new one. Without resale value, you don't break even on a Tesla till year 8 to 10 or more."
He just said resale value is a terrible metric. You shouldn't be buying a brand new car every 5 years. That's just wasteful.
"That's entirely my point. No average person is going out and comparing total cost of ownership. 
TCO =/= affordability. 

Almost a $300 a month difference? That's make and break for the vast majority of americans car shopping. 

Even if you factor in gas, let's assume the current average of $2.11 a gallon and $0.13 per kWh for electric. 

You'd need to drive almost 50,000 miles a year to make up the $265 a month payment difference. How many people do you know driving 50k a year? 

Long story short, to a person who only cares how much they're spending every month to own a car (The VAST majority of buyers) they're not even remotely similar in ""affordability""."

"Russia’s extraction costs are a little high for them to be winning anything. The winner will be the Saudis as usual, their productivity per well is off the charts. Many many times that of the other major producers. Hence why they would initiate a price war in the first place.

Also prices won’t go through the roof in any case unless there are bigger factors driving it than the aftermath of price undercutting. Once prices start climbing, the higher cost producers will just get back to it, and if demand is the same, it’ll even out to roughly what it was before. The Saudis’ interest here is to get the other opec members back to the table for an agreement to maximize profits. But that doesn’t mean they would be able to crank up the price really high. The rest of the world has built up enough production capacity at this point to prevent destabilizations like that."
It is
"20k miles a year is 588 gallons of gas at 34 mpg combined. At around $2/gal, thats $1176

According to Google, Teslas cost $0.037/mile. Times 20k miles = $740

1176-740=436/12 = $36/month cheaper mileage"
"$13k (price difference) in gas is about 6500 gallons of gas. At 34 mpg combined, that's 221,000 miles. So being generous and assuming you pay nothing for charging the Tesla, at 221k miles you *break even* compared to the Tesla."
"Youd have to drive  a lot more than the average 30 mile daily commute to make that matter though.

Not to mention insurance on a car that costs 10k more.

And the purchase of a new battery when the time comes. That's 10k. Good luck selling it close to that time as well. 


Batteries deteriorate over time. It doesnt matter if you have 5000 miles on it. It helps. But your battery will need replacing. 


I'm all for tesla and want one. I've tried all kinds of gymnastics for it to make sense for me. It's still too damn expensive. Period. They arent for the masses yet."

The hospitals in Oregon and Washington already ran out a few days ago.
Masks get soiled with droplets containing virus.  Worker can bring it into another room.  Touch their mask on accident.  Touch the patient or touch themselves. Spread the virus
"Instacart. How often do you need to shop for food? Once, maybe twice per week? The mask is a false sense of security unless you know what you’re doing with it."
"Instacart...Also, no one is living a normal life right now."
"The masks are there to prevent YOU from coughing and spreading droplets.  The masks in the picture are a better quality mask (N95 captures ~95% of particulate matter that are 3 microns in size or larger).  Wearing a mask as the general population is overblown and unnecessary as the risk is low, *especially* with social distancing.  IF you were in contact with someone with COVID-19 and you were looking at just the route of infection being inhaled through airborne droplets, you look at the exposure time.  The research is not 100% certain, but equating to another droplet infectious disease like tuberculosis, hospital protocols generally don't give prophylactic medication to a healthcare worker that was exposed unless they were within 3 feet for ~20 minutes.  I've done lumbar punctures on infants with TB meningitis and didn't meet the requirements for treatment for myself.  

In general, the masks are there to prevent the general public from touching their face.  Handling fomites (objects that carry the virus) then touching your mucosal surfaces (eyes, nose, mouth) are a major concern for transmission.  The virus can live on the surface, depending on conditions, for up to nine days.  

Basically, don't touch your face, wash your hands, and clean the surfaces around you and you're going a long way to preventing the disease."
"No, I really don't.  Going outside isn't risky, as long as you wash your hands frequently and don't touch your face or eyes and stay away from groups of people, especially in enclosed places.  Most delivery companies now have a no-contact policy.  In shipping centers you should be washing your hands frequently and sending home anyone that is symptomatic.

But healthcare workers are at a much much higher risk of being infected than your average person, by several orders of magnitude.  They are in incredibly close proximity to visibly sick people in tight spaces, being directly coughed on and potentially breathing high concentration of viral particles.  They are then having to go and work with people that may not have the virus yet or have compromised immune systems.  If they get infected they could very easily die.  If healthcare workers don't have these masks they can't treat ANYONE in the hospital.  Yes, they have either free or discounted healthcare, but who's going to take care of them when everyone in the hospital is sick?  Nobody.  Hospitals will shut down.  That means if you suddenly go into cardiac arrest you're fucked buddy.  If you crash your delivery truck and need surgery, you're fucked.  If you're wife starts going into labor and has complications trying to deliver in your bathtub, she's fucked, too.  Massive amounts of people could die who were at very high risk, and right now this is all about risk management.  Give extra protection to those more likely to get infected and provide the rest with information on common sense preventative measures.   Plus healthcare workers are very hard to come by.  It takes many many years of very technical training for them to be effective.  I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but when your facing the potential of a complete societal breakdown, you give more protection to those who are the hardest to replace and most likely to become infected."
Man that's mental. That's like £54 for 50g of tobacco. I pay £22 (like 45 NZD) for 50g of Amberleaf here and I feel I'm getting shafted here in Scotland as it's cheaper elsewhere in Europe.
"It's still s monthly expenses. People buy cars as loans, not as bulk payments."
"Yup. I'll be buying an electric car when the base purchase price hits 25k, with no more than 10k in addons. Not before."
OMG!!!!! I forgot to mention resale value!! So everything I said isn't true?? Grow the fuck up.
Lots of people in the US change cars every 5 years or less
"Electric vehicles all have regenerative braking, so if it's utilised properly, the standard friction brakes are used very minimally. The Model 3's brake pads are expected to last around 100k miles, for example."
Regen braking uses the motor to slow down the car by providing resistance and generating electricity. Means the brake pads last longer.  That being said the torque of evs means your tires don't last as long either
"It's dependant on a lot of different factors though was my overall point. The TCO for each person will be different and for some people it will be very different.

Gas is about $2.75 for me. Tesla would be alittle more than 3.7 per mile and I'm coming from 45 mpg. Not to mention my current payment is only $250 lol.

I'm just showing that when we start talking electric you do have to start calculating everything else involved because some people very well may be able to afford one even if the monthly payment seems higher. Personally...anything more than $300 a month for a vehicle is an extreme luxury in my book on something so expendable."

insurance probably more than offsets the savings.
"And oil changes and brakes and tune ups. 

And a Model 3 is a steal for only a few thousand more than the base Camry. A base Model 3 is a MUCH MUCH better car than a base Camry.

If you are really trying to squeeze dollars out of your drive, a Camry isn't the best car. You should be looking at a compact or hatchback. 

Basically, the Model 3 does have a pretty good selling proposition. I'd argue it's better than a Camry."
"Battey last the life of the vehicle. 300k miles with battery degredation.

Some people driver more than 30 miles per day. Also, if you keep the car longer than the payments, you still have had money.

If you can afford a new Camry, you can probably afford a new Tesla though. That's unless you are really pushing yourself too get into a Camry (barely afford the$400 payment), than you shouldn't be looking at a new car anyway."

"On NPR they mentioned if COVID patients are put together the doctor can go patient to patient while using the same mask. 

On top of that hospitals are looking into sterilization methods to reuse masks. None of that is ideal but if you think of it this helps reduce the use of masks by orders of magnitude."
Dumb question... suppose you have a soiled mask and you put it on a shelf or whatever.  How long will the virus live on the mask?
Why not wear a surgical mask over it?
"Sadly, despite this, places are reusing because of shortages."

My 50 year old dad only uses the radar/weather app (like the advanced one) and it's his source of enjoyment. He can't even send a link to me if I ask for one. What we need to do is band together and create a list of the old, people in our family, and shop for them and ask friends to do the same and if they need someone you'd be willing to help. That's the honest solution."

">Wearing a mask as the general population is overblown and unnecessary as the risk is low, especially with social distancing.

Basically all of Asia is wearing masks and South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, etc are doing better than the US in this regards. You can combine social distancing with mask wearing for maximum effectiveness.

You should also note that most of Asia isn't wearing N95s. The photos you see in Tokyo or Seoul or Hong Kong are mostly showing regular surgical masks.

[Masks do work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/), and instead of telling people they don't need them, the [CDC and government should've been more transparent about them](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html).

>In general, the masks are there to prevent the general public from touching their face.

That's one benefit, but any kind of mask has been found to reduce exposure. If someone sneezes into your face, you'd be better off with even a surgical mask or a scarf over your nose and mouth than nothing at all.

One point to note is that China is manufacturing 200 million masks a day. Less than 1% of that is N95 masks, meaning its population is using surgical masks regularly. I think had we figured out our messaging here better about masks, you wouldn't have average people hoard N95 masks."

"Man, I’m jealous. My government thinks taxing it is the way to make people quit. They have this smoke free idea by 2025. Our prices have raised 10% every year for the last 5, with no plan to stop. Next year it will go up to about $125."
"I'm not saying what you sid isn't true.  What i'm saying is that TCO is skewed because of Tesla's high resale value.  If you would ditch a new car after 5 years then sure use it, but its also a wasteful practice doing so.  

Realistically the break-even point between a Tesla and a cheaper car like a Camry is going to be around the 8-10 year mark, and its primarily due to fuel cost difference, as brakes and tires balance each other out and a Toyota is going to need almost zero maintenance other than oil every 10k miles.

If you want to use a Mercedes or BMW as a comparison then yes it will be much sooner, both because of initial cost and the maintenance on those powertrains is far more frequent and costly.  But those aren't your average commuter car either."
"The torque is not the problem. I mean I guess it is if you drive aggressively but the real problem is weight. Electric vehicles weigh a lot more than their counterparts and they also usually end up with low profile tires, this combination means that your tires are only going to last about 35kish miles"
"200+ bucks a month plus the extra for insurance is a shit load of money though. Literally thousands a year. Saying "" ohhh you cant afford 650 to 700/month for a car payment means you shouldnt buy a new car at all."" Is a little misguided. I can buy a nee car at 400/mo. 650 to 700 a month is hilariously out of the question.

And tesla warranties their battery for 8 years. Telling me they expect it to last about 9. Even a study they did initially supports your point. That battery life is only degraded by about 10%at 100k or more. But then sharply starts declining after that. Unfortunately, being only 8 years after the model S really launched, there just isnt enough time to really tell.


It certainly makes buying a used tesla a little suspect to me. And I'm not going to spend,say 20k on a used car that's 10 years old that I'll have to put 10k into within 6 months of buying it. And that's true for ICE or EV."

"> Basically all of Asia is wearing masks.  

Yes.  They have been as it is a cultural norm for air pollution.  Plus you must have missed the [messaging on the mask use for those countries](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600\(20\)30134-X/fulltext).

However, your comment stating these countries are doing better than the US in this regard doesn't account for [confounding variables](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/statistics-when-confounding-variables-are-out-of-control).  The classic public health example is that the number of drownings increase with ice cream sales.  Pointing out the Asian countries isn't saying much.  [Italy is doing better than the US if you account for the 11-day lag](https://i.redd.it/vyaoukcj5un41.png).  What you're missing is the widespread testing that other countries are performing.  

> CDC and government should've been more transparent about them...  

A [professor of library and information science](https://sils.unc.edu/people/faculty/profiles/Zeynep-Tufekci) has an opinion on how information was disseminated?  Gasp.  Why isn't her article on the bungled messaging by the administration?  45's uncle was a *super genius* according to 45 and it gives him the natural ability to combat the outbreak.  Seriously.  That's his response.  [Here is the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QF4TihwFT4) from the encounter.  I tried to link the [White House's transcript](https://imgur.com/RdtD5BX) but because 45's name is in the hyperlink, AutoMod won't allow it.  It starts by him saying he JUST learned how many people die from the flu (each year) four or five or six weeks ago.  Great natural ability... But I digress.  [I hate to use the comedians to point out how laughable our response has been](https://www.facebook.com/thedailyshow/videos/495105427840983/)... but we're a laughing stock.

>. If someone sneezes into your face...

Again, of no concern with social distancing.  Costs nothing and doesn't lead to a burden to the healthcare system with [people buying up all of the available resources](https://www.wdrb.com/news/kentucky-tennessee-authorities-seize-bottles-of-hand-sanitizer-in-alleged/article_cd56f5e0-6ac7-11ea-bf6b-ff9ce788c5be.html).  Entertaining your idea, how often does someone sneeze in your face prior to the outbreak?  


Don't take my word for it.  What about the [WHO's message on masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)?  Or [a review stating they generally work](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712\(16\)31010-4/pdf) (PDF) at mass gatherings but don't work for specific viral infections (again... social distancing wouldn't need this... beginning to notice a pattern?)

[Some studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4293989/) show usage is brought on by *perceived* benefit.  This doesn't touch on *actual* benefit.  It just goes to show the impact of the media, the perceived risk,  and the usage.

Masks are only needed for prolonged contact with infected individuals. Healthcare workers are exposed for long durations, therefore it’s appropriate for them to wear. Going to the store is likely just going to keep anything you breathe next to your face, increasing the risk of infection (note: not necessarily COVID).


>  One point to note is that China is manufacturing 200 million masks a day. Less than 1% of that is N95 masks. 

Not sure where your numbers are for that, but assuming that were true, do you understand how much equipment would be used if you don't [flatten the curve](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)."
"Our petrol cost here is $1.87 per litre but that’s low this month because of the flood of oil that went into the market this past month. January our petrol was as high as $2.25 per litre. 3.785L per gallon. $8.50 per gallon at its high. Dollar exchange atm makes it just under $5 a gallon, USD."

"You wrote a lot and I appreciate the effort you put in, but I think you may be missing the point on some of what I meant. I'll try to get back to you on most of this, but for now only some will do.

>Yes.  They have been as it is a cultural norm for air pollution.  Plus you must have missed the messaging on the mask use for those countries.

Actually if the concern is PM2.5, then people would be wearing N95 masks regularly. Have you been to Asia? I travel to Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Japan, etc. regularly. People do wear masks but certainly not N95 level masks out in the open, and in non COVID-19 times, the mask wear rate is pretty low. Yes, people do it, but what I'm referring to is basically the 90%+ wear rate in Asian countries now during COVID, and similar spikes in mask wearing during H1N1 and other pandemics.

The vast majority of people are wearing surgical masks, and N95s are usually only worn if you need to go to a hospital or a high risk area. You can see this in typical news photos showing streets of Hong Kong or Tokyo during times like these.

>Plus you must have missed the [messaging on the mask use for those countries](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30134-X/fulltext).

Yes, the messaging differs, but in general Asian nations aren't actively discouraging the wearing of masks like the CDC is, and that's my point. Here's an example of the [Taiwanese CDC](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En). They actively talk about masks and how to wear them and even offer [travelers news](https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/6jtRAoqT2eVNhucffF0eqQ?typeid=158) about masks. Even if their official guidance pushes for those with symptoms or high risk people to wear masks, they're 100% open about masks and have a lot of resources for your average person, which is why the mask wear rate is basically like 99% in all these countries at this time.

Look, I'm not saying we ought to copy Asian countries or not. My point was to reply to the user who thinks that masks only work on the sick, but in reality there are studies showing that really [any mask works](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/) and that while [N95 masks are certainly better, surgical masks offer some level of protection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16490606). I understand why the CDC and our government officials don't recommend mask wearing, and I can respect policy based decisions that differ country to country. I'm just trying to point out that there are health officials in other countries who believe otherwise and recommendations differ across countries and just because the US says one thing doesn't mean that's the final word."
"And better education does that over increasing the cost. Look at the most expensive illicit drugs. Hugely expensive, seen as cool, still done by kids. Education is far better."
"Being an island that is very far from anything else, I guess it isn’t as easy. I’ve never come across black market tobacco. Our numbers of smokers are decreasing but that’s a pretty international trend with more information about it’s harm, kids aren’t smoking like they did 15 years ago. I wouldn’t say it’s just from the price increase, and it surely isn’t helping the poor community who will continue to smoke. Their kids get a little less food."
Smoking rates in New Zealand are steadily declining. (https://www.smokefree.org.nz/smoking-its-effects/facts-figures ). There was a study done in the early 2000's (I think it was then) that showed the best way to stop people smoking was to increase the price. This has proven to be true since then.
"Neato. And yes  the budgeting does include gas price. But you should also consider the fact that a car payment is not variable. You can use less gas, to some extent. Process can fluctuate.  You cant pay less on the car. 

The data from the study shows a somewhat linear degradation. Although, after 150k it starts to drop off sharper.

Plus there were all the reports a week ago telling people not to buy them because there for others in medical field.
"Let's do both? There's not one end-all solution to the problem. I've got nothing against smokers. We all have our vices and smoking is super hard to quit. But the tobacco industry can get fucked. We don't have cocain and heroin on display at the local supermarket, because it's super addictive and tends to ruin lives.   
I know how patronizing this may sound, but I believe everyone will be better off without smoking."
"I’d have to read it. Personally I think better education works better. Price will obviously work once it’s gets to a certain stage, better education works once you teach and enforce it. 

Not saying you’re wrong, I’m sure you aren’t, I just like reading sources."
"I don't see the sharp decline you are talking about. I 85% after 200k miles and a lot of noise in that graph. Yeah, the battery could go bad after 10 years, but Toyota engines could blow up too. Toyota isn't immune to reliability issues.

I get what you are saying about the specifics on the financials though. I'm not saying that a Model 3 is cheaper than a Camry. I'm saying it's about as affordable. What i mean by that is a typically optioned Camry and a base model 3 sr+ will cost close to the same after 10 years of ownership. We can find cases where the model 3 is cheaper and the Camry is cheaper. What I'm saying is we're talking about around a hundred dollars a month difference over the life of the vehicle.

That's completely different than trying to compare ownership of a bmw 3 series, model S, or and S class to a Camry. Those cars typically cost ~300-1000 more per month than a Camry and are definitely not comparable in affordability."
I don’t disagree at all.
"I cont find the original study easily, but here is the update done in 2018 which tracks the successes and failures of the program. Warning it's long read, but the executive summary is a good overview.

"That said, $115 for a pouch is shocking. Surprised there is no blooming black market. I don't know what it costs here in the Netherlands these days. It was around $6 USD for a 20 pack when I used to smoke 20 years  ago (hard to convert, the public opinion is of course that we massively undersold our national currency for the euro). Cost was never a problem for us. I can still occasionally smell it and think ""sure, I'll have a cigarette, why not"". Looking back it was insane though. Smoking in movie theaters, bars, restaurants....the first time I flew on an airplane it had a smoking section."

"Presumably you can knock several thousand off for 15 years of crash testing vehicles, internal testing non-saleable vehicles, and various prototypes.

Unless he's just talking about production vehicles. Impossible to tell, because the tweet is ambiguous."
Not every car they make is designed to be sold to customers I’m thinking.
Tweet says “made” not sold or delivered. So there is that.
"WRONG.

Those come with the performance upgrade model Y.
Woah woah.... Let's keep those low expectations out there.
"Production > Deliveries.  

Do keep in mind some production cars are not delivered.  Some are used for crash testing, show rooms, test driving, etc."

The exact opposite of my frunk sag!
Exact same thought ran through my head.
The gap is there exactly because the last guy making this comment on a Tesla forum sits in the frunk in a plastic bag.
It's exaggerated by shadow. Look at the angle of the sun and the shadow cast by the car on the ground.
Congratulations! I feel like it's a separate country
Even 3-4 years would be absolutely insane. In America alone they've breached 1% of the market by themselves. The potential for them to take another percentage point in a couple years is basically gonna land yay-or-nay on their battery cell production rate. Super exciting times.
Even faster if they don't paint 'em.
"I know... I didn't wanna point it out but what is going on with the frunk?

The hood gap is easy to adjust if you open up the frunk and adjust some knobs. Quite easy to do on the model 3.

Pushin paper.... (or in my case writing bad code)
Like browsing reddit
">  There’s a user (underscore tesla underscore) who I think would break this down with the attention it requires.

Thanks for pinging me, here's a more detailed estimate:

> > On December 31st 2019 Tesla cumulatively sold 893,450 vehicles (according to Wikipedia), which means they already have around 105,000 vehicles either sold or ready for sale and 22 days left in this quarter (3 weeks x 7,000 per week - 10,000 vehicles on the way to customers + 2,000 China vehicles). Prediction: more than 115,000 for first quarter 2020? I must be wrong.

Yeah, so it's ***production*** that matters, not deliveries/sales.

Here's the historic Tesla production numbers table [I posted over at /r/teslainvestorsclub as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/fg6uwh/elon_congratulations_tesla_team_on_making_our/fk3fey2/):

    year | Tesla vehicle production
       -- | --
    -2011 | ~2,500 (early Roadster)
     2012 |   3,100
     2013 |  23,187
     2014 |  35,000
     2015 |  51,095
     2016 |  83,922
     2017 | 101,027
     2018 | 254,530
     2019 | 365,232
   **total**  | **919,593** vehicles
     March 9 | 1,000,000-919,593 = 80,407
     **Q1'2020 full** | **110,400** (est.)


There's another 3 weeks left in March, and with Fremont production at 7k/week and GF3 production at 3k/week there will probably/possibly be another ~30k vehicles made in this quarter - this is the basis of the 110,400 estimate in the final line.

Note that this might depart upward and downward as well, depending on how well (or badly) the supply chain reacts to the coronavirus and how well GF3 is ramping up. There might also be Model Y related hick-ups, or over-achievement at Fremont.

Seasonally Q1 deliveries should usually be 5k-15k units below production, especially this year because Q4 depleted all inventory which had to be replenished, so I'd guess that Q1 deliveries will be broadly in the 95k-105k range, which is what current market expectations are I believe.

Still the production of the 1,000,000th Tesla vehicle is I believe robustly falsifying the more bearish estimates of just 70-80k production (similar to last year's Q1) that the TSLAQ scammers are spreading on Twitter. 🤠"
You just type /u/_tesla_ and Reddit tags them automatically.
"Can you share a link to Tesla investor club? Is it a subreddit? Can't find it, but would love to."
I’d definitely go with lex Friedman
"Not sure how the other user came up with 893,450.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.#Production_and_sales_by_quarter


The table clearly says 921,046 cumulative production in 2019Q4. Which puts current production at ~79k."
Yes
What else would they do with them? If they are selling that Model to customers all safety testing is completed.
Maybe it is your tone.
"Obviously but his point was specifically about Tesla drivers and their ""1 million"" less ICE vehicles. 

The fact that they've got major manufacturers trying to grab a hold of some of the market that Tesla dominates shows they really see value and that we're definitely on our way to becoming fully electric."
"Yep, looks like their influence has pushed other OEMs to accelerate EV development. GM has been working on EVs for decades now but I feel like their recent strategy has been pushed by Tesla: https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/03/04/gm-unveils-10-future-evs-new-batteries-and-its-plan-beat-tesla/4905906002/"
"While you are technically right, that's a backronym."
"https://youtu.be/d1X8V3QVSu0

Here's some analysis that is probably a little closer than my hasty estimations."
I think that was pretty well stated in my comment.
"Cars that aren't for sale are a tiny minority of the cars that are produced. So for all intents and purposes, production = deliveries. It just varies on a quarter by quarter basis. Some quarters they produce more than they deliver, and some quarters they deliver more than they produce. Last quarter they had more deliveries than production, for example."
Hope it’s not a systemic problem.
"Look at the shadow cast on the ground by the car and extrapolate the position of the sun. It is hitting the lip of the frunk at a low angle, exaggerating the gap with shadow and making it look wider and deeper."
"Seeing the composition of the team who makes the EVs, I really don't think they will ever solve the panel gap issues.

EDIT: Lol at downvotes."
"That's nice and all but how much do you pay for this car? Given how applesque Tesla is I'd expect it to be ""no user intervention required""."
Are you feeling okay? ;-)
Oh that makes sense.
"Thanks, makes sens now"
I prefer the unnatural numbers 😏
That's what's possible when you have dozens of factories like VW has. Elon is heading in the same direction. Give him time and Tesla will be making many millions of vehicles per year.

"Seriously, Elon’s tweet suggests they already made the 1000000th car. Don’t overthink this. No one has the inventory info of their q1 production. So why is there so much doubt or need to prove it right by doing all sorts of estimates? Great, great work on that btw, haven’t seen such excellent  number crunching anywhere. Upvote for that 👌👍"
It's actually u/__Tesla__
/r/teslainvestorsclub
"That would give us a more realistic production estimate of 102,000 for the quarter with linear extrapolation. They'll probably be closer to 110k-115k with Model Y and Model 3 MIC ramps and considering February shutdown in China from Coronavirus. Deliveries will be less afyer they depleted inventory in Q4. Maybe in the upper 90k DC b or low 100k range."
They could be including test cars which they use internally.  I can't imagine that's more than a few thousand though for the life of the company
"As well as what /u/AmIHigh said, it could also be that not every manufacturered car has been sold *yet*.  Many are display vehicles in showrooms, some are loaners, some are on ships on their way to customers in other continents.

Its not because of tesla that they all start making EV its because EU law forces them to do so and the fines are per car sold so they get expensive real fast."
"We have seen multiple prototype pictures here now that all had some panel gap issues.
If they can't make small scale prototypes right how would they do full scale production."
"My 2020 Model 3 P had to go in yesterday to readjust the door panels back because they were squeaking (thought it was lube issue, glad I decided to use service instead of being a DIYer for once!)

"Nah, that isn't a shadow. Look to the right of said gap where the line takes a sharp turn up just before the right headlight. The hood is recessed and at a slight angle. It's uneven."
[deleted]
The hood gap is easy to adjust if you open up the frunk and adjust some knobs. Quite easy to do on the model 3.
there's so much fucking bullshit in the league
Once you've driven one you'd understand. The car offers so much more that other manufacturers haven't been able to replicate yet. If I have to open the frunk to adjust some knobs I don't really mind.
[deleted]
That's irrational.
Have you ever driven a model 3 or been in one?
Or yours.

Are you the reason my garage door opener turns my sprinklers on?
Thanks I’m amused he’s certainly possible.
That’s when Model 3 ramped up. 2017 was basically all Model S and X. We should see another jump in 2020 with Model Y and China giga.
I think it’s actually uWuTeslauWu
"also some are used for internal testing, some for crash testing and some are just scrapes, especially when they were learning how to make cars.  
The tweet says millionth car made, not sold. Based on Tesla own data, there are 30 000 more cars produced than sold. So they made ~80 000 cars this quarter yet, which would mean ~102 700 cars produced for the whole quarter (maybe more, since Chinese factory was closed for some part of the quarter)"
That’s not how you convince people. You must attempt to build a bridge.

"Before the laws are signed, lawmakers make sure that their goals are achievable. If there was no Tesla and other EVs would be bad, they would put up so aggressive targets"
"A slight unevenness can be exaggerated to look worse than it really is in this kind of light. I'm not claiming it's perfect. There is some shadow there. Compare with the group photo where the car is a little less angled away from the sun, the shadow is more slight."
"Look at how overweight some of the team members are. Being overweight does a few things to a worker:

1.)Worker gets tired more easily which can lead to mistakes.

2.) Less emotional capacity or patience(fat and sugar has lots of effects on your mood).

3.) Studies show that people who are fit/slim have better cognitive function. Cognitive function can help thinking on small details. Maybe the two above points have something to do with it.

Then you take a look at a pic of the small part of a space x team.

I edited and reworded my original comment slightly
"The law was signed in 2009, long before tesla had any relevance in the EV market."
There are plenty of virtues in having a healthy weight but I don't think it fair to criticize someone's engineering capabilities due to their weight.
Because they don't take the time. It's typical Tesla for better or worse. They are mostly just focusing on getting as many cars produced.
"Nothin, just teasing her. She’s been around for a while."
"did  they make the car out of wood? there is a performance and range difference but still functions as a commuter car, saying its unfortunate to be in one suggest a bias because its drastically different opinion from the public and reviewers, try finding a better EV for the same price should be easy since the M3 is so terrible..."
I wish it was rainbows and sunshine. Some days I can't even look at the comments on this sub because of miserable people like you. Do you go to other car enthusiast subs and just shit on their cars and fans as well?
"Fremont has a limited amount of space so they can’t keep ramping there at the same pace they did in 2018. They do keep squeezing more cars out there every year though. Yes, 2020 will have China giga, and 2021 will have Berlin."

"> Fremont has a limited amount of space so they can’t keep ramping there at the same pace they did in 2018.

The original plan was to make 10k/week (500k/year) Model 3's at Fremont and export those everywhere in the world - but the Chinese trade war happened, after which Tesla was forced to redirect 150k-250k/year production capacity to Giga Shanghai to not be exposed to the very high tariffs.

This cost them about a year of delay.

"Definitely looks like the ModelY is closer to the X size than the 3, kind of crazy given they share around 70% of parts with the Model3."
I didn't realize it had a shorter wheelbase
"Did the price go up? I just ""built"" one and it came out to a little over 60k with LR, white interior and self driving. 

Thought I did it a few months ago and it was about 55"
"Those wheels make it look super nice, the 3 also needs big wheels to look proportionate."
The model Y looks amazing and comes with huge practical bonuses. The main one being is the powered hatchback and possibly a larger frunk due to the higher ride height. Also personally I prefer the factory Crome delete with the new wheels that are provided with the Y. The Y seems like a no brainer since it is only 3 to 4k more than the 3. The only down side would be a slightly lower 0-60 with lower range. But the difference isn’t massive since the range is only decreased by 7 miles and the 0-60 is lower by 0.1 second.
They look the same to me. The Y doesn’t look much bigger. It looks to be about the same size as my Ford Edge which I consider small for my family of 5. Cybertruck here I come.
Might sell my S in a year or so and get a Y.
Model 3 vs Model Y is like elder vs younger toguro
Slow clap!

"The sloping roof does it I think. I have a 2016 VW Touran MPV, and the highest point on the roof seems to match, though the VW obviously isn't a coupé.

"Is it just me or does the blue on the Model Y look way better in these pictures?  I have blue on the 3, but am honestly kind of disappointed relative to blue metallics I've had in the past.  I assume it's the same paint on both though."
I used to think the same until a few weeks ago when I researched the safest car color. It's white by quite a margin. I don't know about you but I'd do nearly anything to avoid getting in an accident in my new (future) model y.

"Just curious - who actually likes cakes that are hot? I have never eaten a cake that is hot (temp or spice level) so I've never understood the saying ""It will sell like hot cakes"". 

It's an anachronistic saying now."
It's a 3 that ate all the cakes. I don't get the attraction for these crossovers because they look bloated.
"This. I think the 3 looks much better, except for that."
"Couldn't resist - That's probably what your wife asks. 

/sorry but I feel like laughter will silly jokes is a joy to spread at times."
The white line on the ground alongside the car gets closer to the camera towards the front wheel so I think it’s just a camera distortion - both wheels are the same.

"Boooo!!!  the model X is not blue, so my brain cannot handle an accurate comparison."
They won’t. They offer $37k for a car that is less than one year old and I paid $55k for it.
Bro this is not an iPhone 🤣
People trading in 1-year-old cars are insane.
It competes great against premium ice vehicles

It's a crossover.
Arent wagons like an estate unless you're talking about a g wagon which is an SUV
I'm pretty sure it's just the lighting in the two pictures.
It's the ugly chrome trim on the 3.  It looks awful on blue.  Many people are paying to have vinyl wrap kits put on over it.
"Definitely looks more matte on the 3. It's a lower gloss, maybe from a skin layer."
TBH I like the 3 better in these pictures. The lighter door handle and window trim is a nice contrast.
"Hot cakes, aka pancakes"
"Cakes that just got out of the oven are fresh and smell great, so they sell better than the ones made before. It doesn't mean lava hot, just fresh from the oven."
"Yeah, I thought so, but the line looks close to straight and the wheel size looks so radically different. But as you say, camera distortion must be it."
"That's it. I'm motivated. I'm getting off Reddit and focusing myself on my objectives.

"Well ditch the aero hubcaps then, they look stupid"
Bet you wouldn't be saying that if they were released by Toyota.
"Honestly if you just want the space get a mini van. I was dead set on never getting a mini van because everyone knows they're 'lame'. But after getting mine, I'd never drive an SUV again. So much more space, gets about the same gas mileage, and it is still pretty quick. With all my seats down, I can basically fit a king size mattress back there it is enormous."
"X has air suspension, so ride height can be adjusted."

You can sell it for $55K on the used market.
Trading in cars is only for lazy or extremely wealthy people.
"That’s be great if I had a premium wallet. I thought that the X was supposed to be the premium, and the Y was the one for the average person?"

"I replaced my Sienna with a Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid with 30 miles electric range. I really like it, it’s mostly driven in electric mode, and I haven’t put gas in it since October 26. Recommended for minivan owners."
I did not same same mileage as a model Y I said as an SUV. I understand that isn't a point to bring up with EVs for obvious reasons but currently there aren't any electric minivans. Once Tesla makes a minivan that's my next purchase. But I've seen a lot of people spend so much money on SUVs just for the space but I've compared just about every new SUV to the minivans and the cubic space is not even near the same.
I'd expect you'd get somewhere in-between. In the 40s for sure. Huge demand and not enough supply.
"Private party. It's a little legwork but you will make thousands more. I've sold many cars private party, just post on Craigslist/local facebook groups. Another option would be consignment through a high end used car dealer (assuming it's a high end car in good shape).

"It's a pretty big step mid priced if you want ICE competitive ranges (the LR model). Looking at close to twice the average new car price if you get FSD. I'd call it expensive, but it's not exotic."

Between a minivan for a family and a hatchback based SUV the difference is about 6 inches of ground clearance 

Now if your using a minivan to run family and business out of them, then there might be some situations where there is a difference but then you really should have a van or a pick up but this isn’t 95% of users"

Seen many teslas of all kinds. Drug dealers have a lot more money than you'd think
I get the impression that most people are going to be able to sell their used Model 3s for around 45k almost regardless of config. More if you've got a P3D and less if you've got an SR+.

Wait I thought Tesla was a technology company?
"I'm amazed at how many people are in denial at Tesla's growth in the market. Point it out and you're called a fan boy, or told about how the MachE and Porsche Taycan are going crush Tesla, or retreaded short-seller arguments."

"Oh, nice"
"The only way Tesla can accomplish its mission to transition the world is if it can do so while climate change wreaks havoc on the economy, as it has been doing.

"> Tesla’s emerging Space X company in the rocket-launch sector.

What does that even mean ?"
Anybody got an opinion on how the Tesla shareholders are going to take the first quarter results and the downturn in sales due to nobody having any money from the virus?
This is because they are the most vertically integrated and highly automated manufacturing company. Their business is less susceptible to third party supply interruptions and huge labor losses atm
Electrik
I've seen loads of Boeing products but never a Tesla- do they even sell them in the UK? I want a Cybertruck.
Is this a competition of which company has worse ideas or how many ways they can accidentally kill costumers?
Ooo Tesla owns SpaceX!! Nice!
That only proves that violating human rights is good for capitalism.

"To be fair, Boeing has been that way for a bit—it’s just now boiling over into the public space."
"Nobody wants to buy an airplane right now, Boeing's most popular airplane can't even fly. Their Commercial Crew Program had a mission failure due to a out of sync clock. 

Yeah, what a combo."
"I work in support for them and it is a shit show right now, but not for the reason you think. It was the 737-MAX. Everyone was alright before this. But now it's the Coronavirus. Everyone I talk to freaks out about this. Ill be talking to someone over the phone and they have to leave so they can get tested. They sent like half of their staff to work from home, which overloads our network systems as well. Everyone is panicking as they realize that all of our factory workers are getting sick. Multiple workers in the Seattle area have already tested positive. I've been trying to petition our support positions to move to work from home, but it will be too late before it happens. America is fucked and so is Boeing. (throwaway so I don't lose my job)"
"737 Max basically didn't do anything to the stock. The level it was in 2018 was the level it was at in 2019, so the death of 346 people and Max grounding/production stop didn't bother the market at all seemingly. The drop as of late is all corona and the ripples through the aviation industry.

The way their stock is being fucked by corona atm is the way it should have been fucked by the epic mess that Max is."

"Boeing bought $20 billion of its own stock with pension money at $275/share in 2017. As price falls liability grows, death spiral. Never do that."

"Has anyone ever done an estimation on how much energy a battery would need to hold to enable short, regional flights? I'd imagine it would be very heavy on guesswork, to determine what an efficient electric turbine would require."
"Tesla could be poised to become the top provider of *batteries*. Batteries for cars, aircraft, boats, grid backup, home backup..."
There are already electric seaplanes. Kenmore Air has one in Seattle and Harbour Air has converted their whole fleet.
"when the company isnt run with PROFIT as the sole motivator.

Tesla is everything to everyone.
Wait you mean that energy company?
"A tech company doing cars

Amazon is a tech company doing retail.

Technology drives everything and if you have the best technology you can often end up dominating that market as the dinosaurs struggle to pivot."
Tesla is whatever best advances the poster's argument in that particular thread.
this happens because the most vocal tesla fans are absolutely delusional and so people feel the need to jump in and try to beat them over the head with reality.
"Tesla is growing like crazy but still small outside of their market cap.

Maybe a better metric would be biggest industrial company by earnings."
"lucky for america hes white, and male"
"If he wasn't of european descent, the immigrant would never have risen so far. 

 The success of the white man is the downfall of all brown and black men. History shows this.

doesnt' seem to have prevented him from securing a metric shitload of gov't money
He better make cat girls happen.
"Patience, Tesla will rebound just fine"
I feel like TSLA is holding up relatively well compared to everything else.
Enron wasn't really an industrial fuck up though.
Tricky.  The battery weight matters a LOT more for aircraft.
I hope it happens soon.
Robin Hood lets you invest in partial stocks so you can trade any stocks with any amount of money. No fees (the trade price they use is a tiny bit in their favor is how they make their money IIRC).

"It's going to get worse.  Their safety problems come from 2 CEOs ago and they just kicked out the CEO that was trying to improve things.  The new guy is back to the old ways of profit first, so it won't get better"
Ever since the MDD takeover.
"That commercial clock sync issue in turn resulted in them finding an even larger issue. Another software bug that could have resulted in the capsule colliding with its own service module after separation, potentially destroying the craft or rendering it unable to safely re-enter the atmosphere. Since the two modules separate right before re-entry that's a major problem.

The clock issue was a relatively small issue that would have been caught by a crew onboard and worked around pretty easily. The second issue was much more serious and wouldn't have been found if they hadn't been going over the software so closely after the first issue.

They were able to recode and upload a correction to the craft before it came back from the failed orbital insertion, but without that first obvious failure the second one would have likely gone totally unnoticed until it likely would have been destroyed upon re-entry.

Not to mention whatever the cause of the communication interference they also had, preventing a manual correction of the first issue. Last I read they were blaming that on cell towers somehow, despite the frequencies they use being completely different.

https://www.space.com/boeing-starliner-2nd-software-glitch-potential-collision.html"
They had another bug that they fixed in mid-air and they were proud of that. They couldn't have done end to end testing. It's basic stuff they are fucking up on.
"Also, way behind and over budget on SLS. Could lose the project unless congress approves a massive budget increase in the next 18 months."
The delay in airplane demand might help them in the long run. Give them time to fix there shit before it picks up again
"Throwaway where you picked ""EnderThePoonSlayer"". I love it! lol"
There were a ton of problems indicative of a lax engineering and production culture well before the MAX.  The 787 battery issue and shoddy production.  The KC-767 has not been a well-run program either.
I imagine COVID-19 making airlines hemmorage money isn't helping Boeing's future prospects either.
"Lovely!

I fly the MAX so, please, do your best.

edit: lol the downvotes. Let me clarify.

Bid on to the MAX at my company in early summer of 2018, flew it until March 13th 2019. Major international airline. We’ve been sitting at home for the last year on base pay, as the airline does not have the 737NG type, only the MAX. Feel free to comb my post history."
"We weren’t given an option in my area, it’s all work from home which is fine for me as it’s much less stressful not worrying about every cough and sneeze."
Any clues on when that ship's getting a CofA again? Or when an AD can be published?
Why would you think you'd get fired for anything you just said?
"Actually America is doing just fine, but sorry to hear about Boeing."
The stock was manipulated to not drop. It was all bs but they couldn't hold out after the corona hit.
Flew the Triple and then went to MAX for a better schedule.
"We have had further training on the STS (speed trim system). The STS contains MCAS. Of course this has all changed with new software logic, essentially making previous training a wash, and have yet to receive ‘mandated training’ or significant background theory for whatever that will look like. 

I suspect the new software will eliminate or significantly reduce the training requirement for that specific system. The new threat is going flying after >12 months off. 

If you were to use the analogy ‘like riding a bike’, this one would be solid rocket booster powered. A major responsibility."
"*SpaceX*'s rockets & Commercial Crew capsules are doing a better job than Boeing's, if you hadn't noticed."
Elon mentioned that the density should be 500 wh/kg  at s bare minimum i think
"Yes, lots of people have. I work for a large aerospace manufacturer as an electrical engineer, and this topic is regularly discussed in my professional circles. (in addition, I've run my own numbers in my free time.)

In short, 1-2 hour regional flights will be plausible on battery power in the next 10 years, but it'll take another 10-20 years to see them in widespread use. Long-haul (overseas) heavy commercial flights will probably never happen due to power density and logistics concerns. (Essentially we'd need multiple nuclear power plants near every international airport to support aircraft recharging.)"
[This video](https://youtu.be/VNvzZfsC13o) might give you an idea
"I know an electrical engineer who worked for Boeing. He now works on reentry craft (space) as a contractor. 

I asked him if Boeing ever had plans to do an electric jet. His answer was basically yes, although the military had the contract to build an electric fighter-style jet. 

More so, he said that having a solid battery for the energy source wasn’t achievable, as even advanced battery tech’s energy density was too heavy. What he said was that Boeing was working on nuclear generators small enough to fit in a fighter, but couldn’t tell me if the project was ever completed. 

Then, just a few months ago, a bunch on people including me saw [this](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/multiple-sightings-secret-military-craft-19336512) in the sky. I sent him a text and he said that it looks like the project’s craft."
"A Telsa Model 3 battery is 57x less energy dense than Jet A (i.e. jet fuel).

Let's consider a Q400 regional turboprop.

Lets super duper conservatively say only 20% of the energy of the Jet A goes to moving the plane and say an electric plane is 100% efficient and turning energy into propulsion.

A Q400 has a max fuel capacity of 11,700 lbs of fuel. For batteries it would require 133,380 lbs.

The maximum takeoff weight of a Q400 is 67,200 lbs.

That ain't happening."
At least ten times more than the battery tech we have today. It’s at least a decade away. Focus on EVs for now.
[This might not directly answer your question but it'll give you a good understanding of the issues.](https://youtu.be/VNvzZfsC13o)
"How short of flights? There is an airline already planning on swapping its fleet of 20 passenger, half hour flights with electric planes.  The pilot/ceo just has to show that they are more reliable than existing inventory.  And he was lucky enough to get a good model s in 2012, so he doesn't think that its going to be too much of a challenge.

The upfront cost of a plane that can carry 300 passengers for an hour is going to be pretty large, and then you either need amazing super chargers, or swappable batteries (adding significantly to the fleet cost).  I think that airplane fuel is already pretty cheap and getting cheaper.  

Airlines are going to do it because they care (lol) or because they are taxed (lol) and not because a new start up like tesla forces their hands."
Elon said it needs to double at least to hit the lower limit.
"Yes, I wrote an article for my blog a few years ago. 

TL;DR: you need around 500Wh/kg to start with - that may work for regional jets and smaller single-aisle aircraft. To make it more economical for larger aircraft (flight times above 3-4 hours) you need much better batteries. 

One of the other notes is that you'll have to redesign the aircraft in non-trivial ways - if you just put the batteries in the places where there are fuel tanks now, you'll need a 2x increase over top of the line volumetric energy density (watt hours per unit volume, Wh/l). This problem is managable because we can just redesign the plane to accommodate where batteries are located, but it isn't trivial."
Several companies that run shorter range flights have already switched to electric planes. I think viable plane sizes are up to the regional short haul flights of a few hundred miles. Larger planes with more range are coming...
Harbor Air in Vancouver BC is starting to go electric with seaplanes on shorter routes. Eventually they hope to convert their entire fleet.
"I believe 10 years at least until batteries come to the stage of “almost viable” when people will begin electric airplane startups. The problem is that fuel lowers plain wait throughout the flight, while battery’s stay heavy. So battery’s will be smaller planes, more mass production like and fly not as far."
"the problem with this entire concept is that current airplanes are sized as big as they can possibly be for the given airport sizes.

the limiting factor here is space for landing which is directly correlated to the weight of the plane when it lands.

in the current world planes need enough power to be able to just about lift off when fully loaded but none of these planes is intended to land fully loaded.  
Even in an emergency they dump the fuel to be lighter for the landing.

With batteries you already have to limit yourself to your maximum landing weight at the start because you will not get any lighter this in turn limits your range and/or cargo capacity."
"Tesla doesn't make any batteries...

"> when the company isnt run with PROFIT as the sole motivator.

Ok then lets add Programmer also.
I cant wait until Tesla makes electrolytes energy drinks
You mean a transportation company.
Well WeWork was a tech company doing commercial office leasing but not all markets can be disrupted by tech.
"Tesla was always ahead in technology and innovation. The argument was that traditional manufacturers would figure out the technology faster than Tesla would figure out mass manufacturing. With Gigafactory Shanghai online and expanding, Gigafactory Berlin in construction, Gigafactory Nevada humming, and Fremont more productive than in the previous owner's hands - I think Tesla might be surprising them.  


Edit: Forgot Gigafactory central U.S. being planned."
The most vocal fans are still more accurate about Tesla than 99% of news stories... The anti-Tesla cult is far more crazy than the pro-Tesla cult.

Honest to god dude this was my thoughts the entire time. Like the stock is holding its own out here. People still believe in the growth. That’s invaluable. We’re down what... 300 dollars? Most of the smart money should’ve gotten in around 200-400
"Not any more, as of today. It's down ~40% since the high point, while the Dow Jones is down less than 30% over the same period."
It was in the ways a private company had power over energy that was in use and demanded by the public. That was a big fuck up in terms of how the energy industry was set up.

"The company's statement to its employees when I first got hired is that it was the fault of the airlines for not doing the training. After the emails came out, however, about the safety of the airplane, we stopped trusting what we heard from corporate."
Regulatory Capture is ultimately self defeating
"I don't fucking get these people. Boeing is going to get the 737 back in the air in just a couple of months, delivering and getting paid 600 billion dollars for all those planes. Their profit spike would drop the P/E ratio to *0.6* if they had a 100% margin, but unfortunately, the market will have to make do with a P/E of *2.* Meanwhile, tesla sits over there, sacrificing their growth just to pull a profit, and you end up with a company that grows less than Amazon, an absolute giant, and still will have a P/E ratio of *25 fucking hundred,* that is, once it actually gets a P/E ratio. Boeing is also criticized for its debt. Tesla has *more.* Super long term, not a bad buy, but anything less than 15 years, and you are fucked.

The airlines legally cannot cancel their orders.  The news says they are but these airlines have to swap it out for another plane with Boeing.  Covid- 19 won't hurt them one fucking bit.  Anyone who thinks so is delusional."
"wait there is still anyone flying it? not sure they get that plane of the ground again, first the ""oh-shit-we-crash""-Problem and now they found debris in the fuel tanks a few weeks ago. that plane sounds like more problems than plane to me... let's see what they find next."
"No you don’t. They’ve all been grounded for over a year.

i just work in support. i don't really get that information sorry
had to sign an nda. we can't even say that we work for boeing outside of the building or we get canned. it's stupid.
You can't comment on a company you're currently working for. You sign an NDA.
"S&P500 is doing well, Mid caps aren't doing as well. But arguably fine based on your expectations."
"That's cool. What are you flying for the last year, then? Are you flying during the virus?"
"Eh, kinda.  I went back to B52’s after 5 years off and was air refueling on my first flight, 0 simulators prior on requal (terrible idea) but it worked So it is kinda like riding a bike."
That still doesn't explain how tesla beats Boeing in two different industries.
How much energy can you get from from hydrogen?
What if we used erkanoplans to go overseas
"Electric planes sound stupid. If there really is a shortage of crude oil, we will just move to gas to liquid conversion."
Those regional flights are already possible. A few companies' fleets of planes have already been replaced with electric planes.
"It does assume standard plane design though.

If you redesign the plane from ground up around electric propulsion, you can do better.

"I believe you, but based on what?"
"It's a decade away from now **if** the technology for it exists today... which it doesn't.

We will likely never see electric commercial flight, unless the public becomes okay with slower propeller flight, or is mandated into it"
I think it's more like double... Around 500wh/kg.
Regional flights are already being done with electric planes. It first was just really short range small planes but these days the regional flights of a few hundred miles can be done with electric planes and some companies have made the switch.
*Yet. Things may be changing and that's likely what Battery Investor Day is all about.
I think you missed the whole purchase of hibar and maxwell
"They don't make any batteries *today*. Or, at least, we don't know about any batteries they make. But they have the capacity to do so, which I'm sure we'll be finding out all about next month at Battery Investor Day."
They have stated that they will be making their own batteries when asked about a building next to the shanghai gigafactory.
Tesla’s got what plants crave!
You mean a AI self driving company?
Well they had some dodgy financial reporting. As a product they're great. The offices are amazing as is the ease of use and scale. But there was some bad business on the go.

I would wait and watch.  If it goes below $300/share then absolutely...that’s my plan anyway

Nothing he said would be covered by any NDA.
Nothing. We’re assigned one type and only fly that specific type.

"Hydrogen is very low density and leaks through basically anything used to contain it, even down at cryogenic temperatures. It's a whole other can of worms. Mass energy density is not the only thing to consider, volumetric matters too, as do the auxiliary elements required by the power storage system."
Pro Tip: Hydrogen and flying don’t mix.

"Ekranoplanes are actually less efficient then standard planes over long distances, because planes barely use fuel at really high cruise altitude. They’re only more efficient at short ranges due to not needing to climb to a cruising altitude at the beginning of a flight and descend at the end. 

So certainly island hopping in like the South Pacific or Caribbean they might work, but overseas, no."
Are you living in 2030?
"That is an excellent video for consideration, thanks."

"In part on the electric aircraft we have today. Did you see how hard it was for Harbour Air to get theirs off the water? People were amazed it was even possible, but we’re still far away from 30 min of flight + 30 min of reserve. Or the light GA aircraft we have that can barely stay up for an hour with <400 lbs of useful load."
It's wrong. It's less than double now. Maybe triple for intercontinental. The problem is at current mass fraction there's still quite a bit of runaway mass where you need batteries to support carrying your batteries to support carrying your batteries. But less than a doubling will get us to be able to design pretty decent light aircraft and airliners
"Jet A has a specific energy of 42.80 MJ/kg.

A Tesla's battery has an energy density of around 0.75 MJ/kg.

A battery as it stands is 57x less energy dense than simple, plain, wildly available, and relatively cheap Jet A.

To give some context, the upcoming 777-8 has a fuel capacity of 117,300 kg.

To have the same amount of energy, a battery would need to be 6,694,000 kg.

That ain't happening any time soon."
Very true. I believe Airbus is still over two years away from flying that RJ they’ve been working on. I wouldn’t expect to see actual regional flights from these until the mid 30’s.
[deleted]
Which regional flights are already being done with electric planes?
they have the patents to do so and maybe the technology but its not like they have an empty production line sitting there ready to go when they want to produce their own batteries.
"Sure but there is nothing tech related about what they are offering. They just branded themselves as a tech company but all they are doing is taking long term office leases, renovating the space, and offering short term or flex workspaces."
">Well they had some dodgy financial reporting

... Don't Tesla's earnings calls use non-GAAP numbers?"
I was saying they called themselves a tech company but they weren't.
"> I'm looking at the threads about paint issues right now so I'm not feeling real good about Tesla's lead in tech and innovation.

The paint issues are based on california regulations. From what I have heard, Tesla is only allowed to use a very thin paint on it's cars while other automakers are not based in california so they don't deal with such issues."
"Paint criticism is very valid and it will be interesting to see what the first model Y deliveries tomorrow hold for paint and panel gaps.

Tesla is ahead in battery, powertrain, self driving processing (HW 3.0 easily beats anything Nvidia has right now), neural network image recognition, and overall electronics architecture. Tesla uses a centralized brain, whereas traditional manufacturers still use dozens of smaller compute modules to control legacy systems from parts suppliers. That's why even when they try over the air updates, you will never see entirely new functionality you see in a Tesla. A Model 3 is designed with complete systems redundancy, you could cut half the wires and Autopilot would keep driving, same for a chip failure, you don't see this redundancy anywhere in the auto industry, only aerospace.

This is a great article:  [https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Tesla-teardown-finds-electronics-6-years-ahead-of-Toyota-and-VW2](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Tesla-teardown-finds-electronics-6-years-ahead-of-Toyota-and-VW2) \- not only does the Toyota engineer say HW 3.0 is six years ahead, but that Toyota could simply not do it with their supply chain today.

Don't forget that Tesla is the only company right now that makes a per unit profit selling electric cars. The Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt are sold at a loss. The Leaf's battery pack alone is $35,000. It will be interesting to see if GM's new EV platform is profitable or the Ford Mustang Mach-E on day one."
"Paint issues makes sense. They're a start up. Traditional manufacturers are going to have some aspects of production much more polished. 

The elephant in the room is self-driving. Tesla has billions of real-world miles logged training AI. The closest competitors are in the millions. 

Personally, I am not a fan of having my car function like a cell-phone, leaking data everywhere and reporting to HQ where I go and how fast I drive, etc. I don't like the idea of owning something that can be bricked (e.g., self-driving when a car is transferred to a new owner) when corporate taketh away.  

From what I can see, however, Tesla is killing it in battery tech, price point, production and self-driving. Denying that they're a legitimate market disruptor at this point seem delusional. That stated, I have seen many YouTube channels which appear to be nothing more but Pravda for Tesla ""news."""
"Fair point, lol"
"Just talking about the relevant timeframes, here. The Dow Jones started tanking a few weeks ago when it was at ~29k, and it's now at ~21k (a 27% drop). TSLA started tanking at around the same time, going down from ~$950 to ~$560 (a 41% drop). That's all I'm saying."

Thanks! Will watch it when i‘m at my desktop!
"Ok, just watched the video, thank! Wendover is great 👍
Just a questions i got - how can the fda possibly fly that thing once and say „well we didn’t crash so seems fine“ before giving it over to the group of pilots for working out how to get it certified etc.? i mean i‘m sure the fda has flown a lot of machines in the past that didn’t have critical systems failing on the first flight, hell 99% of the unmodified 737max should be able to do that?

Boung has by now a really really bad history with software - but who can check that?

Also he spoke of a long list of other issues - i will have to google what else they found beside the damage in the tanks. Could be really interesting to read 😬

Well yeah corona will hit both airbus and boing i guess. Even if as someone commented the airlines can’t go back on buying the planes boing will have to give them quite a lot of money for the loss on the planes standing around, the cost of getting them ready again and that training mentioned. Also since boing sold them as „no long training needed“ i guess if a company wants to go back on buying one that might open a case for them. Boing will have to male sure those planes aren’t more expensive to fly than airbus model, otherwise a lot of airlines will be pissed.

Last: one british airline already died because they were in a bad situation anyway and corona gave them the rest. Means if that goes around boing might keep some planes just because those buyers went south..."
so technically you don't fly at all?
What the hell is a credit? Star Wars currency?
Are you saying we're not going to have nuclear planes? Damn. Shouldn't have put so much money into that startup.

"Yeah, synthetic fossil fuels for flying I think"
"Noone is talking about nuclear binding energy here, smart-arse. This is obviously in relation to harnessing of the chemical energy of molecular hydrogen."
"The guy is just starting out as a YouTube. He only has like 8 videos, but so far they are all of that quality. For once, I liked and subscribed."
"Dude, that's insane. Do we know anything more about it?

Also, if they are trying to keep it a secret, why are they just casually flying it over houses?"
"The pipistrel electric trainer plane has 60 minutes flight time with 30 reserve IIRC. Sure the useful load is small, but so is the plane."
For larger aircraft there's also the challenge that a discharged battery is no lighter than a charged battery. So making assumptions that your landing energy will be lower because of ejected fuel is no longer a good calculation.
"Double and triple is enough for regional but I ran the numbers a while back and 5x (1000 Wh/kg) still wouldn’t be enough for transatlantic flights, sadly.

This is one area where maybe we should be looking into hydrogen"
"Was watching someone try to figure out how to build one, their concept was a VTOL supersonic electric jet once the density reaches where Musk envisions.

VTOL because you don't need wings/landing gear to save weight if you high enough/fast enough, because at mach 1.8 you are actually most efficient aerodynamically.  The only really glaring issue I saw was that no one has figured out still the sonic booms."
"What RJ is that? I know they cancelled their 2-seat trainer, and like you said that had a pretty pitiful mission profile... 2 people, less than 60 minutes of flight"
"Propeller planes in general are cheaper, yes, but I'm talking about whether or not customers would pay for the luxury of getting where they're going in 3x the time at ?x the cost"
"We don't know that. They bought Hi-Bar, which is a battery manufacturing company, early last year. There could very well be a secret manufacturing line going up right now."
But they have an app! /s
They use both
Not so sure about that.  The paint thickness has been tested and Tesla is mostly on par with other manufacturers.
"Talking about delusional fans.  

The reason why traditional car manufacturers do decentralized systems is because it's cheaper to implement when you have more than 3 cars.  

And no autopilot doesn't continue driving when you rip half of it out. Our company car doesn't even keep driving when one camera is dirty.  
Chip redundancy has been done before although I'm not sure if it's still common in cars.  

Batteries and power train is definitely a strong point from them. Not completely unachievable (they needed until 2020 until they were able to match 2016 Hyundai efficiency) but definitely top notch.  

And this article is about a Toyota engineer. You know the company that waits for ever to implement new technologies because they love reliability.  

And no a leafs battery pack isn't 35k$. If you buy a leaf battery as a replacement part it's that price. That's like saying a plastic bumper costs 1k because that's what you will be charged if you have to buy one. Gm and Nissan are both making money on their EVs. All articles that claimed otherwise never had sources or were demented."
"I'd say they're definitely disrupting, but I disagree with the premise that they're somehow ahead of other manufacturers in ways that cannot be immediately solved.  Several other manufacturers already have EVs on the road that compare favorably with what Tesla produces, so it looks like it's going to be a very competitive market.

I am also firmly in the ""never happening"" camp when it comes to self-driving.  I think a lot of people are delusional in that regard, especially given how much evidence we have even from Tesla themselves that suggests it is decades away."
^(*but stonks only go up)
"Blockchain isn't Bitcoin. Bitcoin just runs on Blockchain to manage it as an asset that can't be reproduced or forged. Since Bitcoin is an asset, it has it's own market cap (currently at $110,923,797,062).

USD and Yen are also currencies and not stock in the above statement
Boeing's stock tanked because the airlines can no longer afford to buy those 737s.
"I don't think Tesla's at 2500x earnings. At today's close they were at a 100B market cap  

If they sell 500,000 cars (which they may do in 2020) at an average of 45,000 with a 20% margin, this puts them at 20x earnings. That's a pretty fine valuation for a growth company. This is of course free operating cash flow before investments."

"If you’re going to put up a shuttle video argue my point, I think you already know what my answer will be."
So basically only good for pattern work and hopefully the instructor and student aren’t too fat. AFAIK they’re unable to scale the technology up to something like a 172. Planes are very different from cars. We’re still a long ways away.
You can also regenerate energy on the way down don't forget.
More weight and volume with hydrogen. Hydrogen applications tend to be where the space and weight is not so important like larger vehicles / ships.
"I can’t remember the project name but them and I think Siemens have been trying to electrify an RJ. But the project is very, very far from being feasible. It might have been cancelled by now."
"It's tesla we are talking about here, if there would be anything going on they would shout it out in all directions.
To pump the stock some more."
Exactly!
Interesting. This gives me hope they can fix it. Where are these tests?
"Respectfully, I disagree. Car manufacturers do decentralized systems because almost every platform is a descendant from a previous platform and they want to preserve their existing supply chain. That modern interface / computer has to interface with control modules designed 12 years ago. Which is why you will never see big new features rolled out OTA. My Cadillac has only gotten interface refreshes. Never any new functionality.

A Model 3 has dual actuators connected to steering, a fully redundant wiring harness, and HW3.0 has two redundant self-driving chips. No other manufacturer in the world has that level of redundancy in an automobile platform.

The Toyota engineer didn't say they didn't want to do it due to reliability - he said they could not do it.

GM admitted the Chevy Bolt was never profitable this year:  [https://www.hotcars.com/gm-admits-bolt-not-profitable/](https://www.hotcars.com/gm-admits-bolt-not-profitable/)

I apologize. It seems that the Nissan Leaf became profitable in 2014-2015. Or at least break even. Before that it was sold at a loss. I was also wrong about the battery pack cost."
"Tesla's range and price point are on point. The closest competitors generally do well on one of these, but not the other. Those that split the difference are still more expensive with less range. 

Self-driving is already a thing, so I wouldn't say never. It's already a tremendous convenience to be able to hands free on freeways and interstates. If Tesla is better at it, even if it is not 100% full-auto-drive, it's still a considerable value premise. 

The weak link, IMO, is repair and maintenance. The idea that electric cars don't need maintenance is a myth, and without dealerships, you don't have certified mechanics who won't void your warranty."
Tell that to beer virus
"oh now i remember all the problems space shuttle had with its hydrogen, or the delta IV or the ariane series or new shepherd or sls"
I've done detailed design work for electric aircraft. A doubling will make a big difference for range and payload. Tripling would bring it to a level similar to EVs vs ICE. We don't need 10x
"> So basically only good for pattern work 

Sounds good to me. 100LL is 2.5€/liter or $10.5 per gallon here. The savings are massive."
"Not hydrogen fuel cells, but hydrogen turbines. I don’t think it will be easy to build them but they theoretically could have longer range than kerosene planes due to hydrogen’s higher energy content per weight. Definitely would require technological improvements though, storing liquid hydrogen makes things tough"
"Possibly... I think the one you're thinking of was the hybrid commuter. It had 3 regular turbofans creating thrust and giving power to one electric motor, which would also create thrust as a ducted fan"
That's what Battery Day is going to be. It's not like Tesla has kept exciting secrets before. No one knew a thing about the Roadster until it came out of that Semi.

GM never commented on the Bolt’s profitability,

Right in the article.  

BMW does OTA in Germany. They even have a Tesla like change log. They tend to improve driving assistants. But usually don't add large features because the cars tend to be pretty complete our of the factory."
"thats complete bullshit, whenever a company develops a new platform they go for whatever they can currently get reliably.

thats the beauty of not producing everything by yourself, when you develop a new platform you can just collect whatever others can offer and take what's best for you.

You talk about all the advantages of having a central system and conveniently ignore everything thats bad like simple things where the FM radio suddenly stops working and your fucking cars needs to be rebooted.

sure you can still drive but you cant do anything like for example adjusting your AC or anything because its all in a central system.

the EEPROM issue where the write cycles on the memory are not enough so it will fail sooner or later, boom your central system is now dead, sure you only need to replace one computer but this computer is insanely expensive.

Its essentially the Apple problem where a broken port on your motherboard means you replace the motherboard but your GPU, CPU and RAM are soldered in so you buy them all new with the new motherboard because its so great to have everything centralized."
"The Mach-E looks like it will be in the right price ballpark (much closer to current Tesla prices than Tesla prices two years ago), and it will benefit from an EV credit.  It doesn't seem too worrisome, other than the general concern I have for EV prices being really high for what you get (as in, what you get for it being a car, if you don't care about the EV bit).

Other manufacturers have also demonstrated their own ability to do adaptive cruise and lane centering.  Did I see that Hyundai also has some sort of summon like the first Tesla version (in and out of garage)?  Clearly there are a lot of capable programmers out there.

I 100% agree that repair and maintenance are the one thing that is most likely to bite Tesla in the ass if they don't get a handle on it.  They keep showing clear signs of being fairly anti-consumer in this regard, and I don't think that is going to work as a long term strategy for luring in customers from the likes of Toyota & Honda.  Still early, though, and occasionally they demonstrate the ability to learn :).  

I want them to succeed.   But that just makes me more critical, not less.  The market is pretty cutthroat, and until now they've been the only real game in town.  That's about to change."
You do realize that you can get a Kia e-niro or hyundai Kona for less than a model 3 short range+ and both of them will be able to drive further in real world conditions.
"*shorts Corona beer*

#PROFIT"
Bulls r fuk
All stupidly unaffordable?
What are we speaking in terms of?  wh/kg?  A doubling might get us an electric 172.  I think it's going to take more than a tripling to get us to parity.
"Yep. That's what Elon said. Roughly doubling the power density of modern Lithion ion batteries would be enough, although the lower limit for a useful jet. 

The trick is to go much higher than conventional planes do. Directly ascent, convert battery energy into potential energy, and then convert potential energy into kinetic energy where the air drag is much less."
"Getting a 2x improvement still requires quite a breakthrough though, to the point that it is not unfeasible to think such a breakthrough could be much greater than just 2x."
Holy shit that’s expensive. Where are you??
So best case scenario we have a shitty hybrid? Sounds worse than I remember it but maybe I’m missing something.

When asked when she thinks GM’s electric vehicles will be profitable, CEO Mary Barra said during the company’s earnings conference call this week:

>*“I would say early next decade, but I wouldn’t put any more specificity on EV profitability than that.”*

 [https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2016/11/30/gm-zev/94660092/](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2016/11/30/gm-zev/94660092/) (Estimate $9K loss per Bolt in 2016).

BMW doesn't add large features OTA because the cars tend to be pretty complete out of factory? ...what?

The Model 3 was complete. Sentry Mode and Dog Mode hadn't been envisioned yet by Tesla Engineering. It was a consumer requested feature, and they added it for free."
"No, I am not aware. 

If a cheap entry can beat a particular model in alleged ""real world"" conditions, that's great. 

I don't think that anyone yet beats a high-range option TESLA for price."
***beer market***
still nothing to do with the hydrogen.
Yeah wh/kg. There's a big runaway effect though which we're on the wrong side of right now. Doubling gives 172 or some carefully designed larger aircraft. Tripling opens up a lot
"Finland, prices are similar in most EU countries."
"Yup... From a physics standpoint, it's impossible to have an electric jet aircraft like you're used to being on.

An electric motor can turn a propeller just fine, but those are considerably slower than a turbofan."
"The question on the interview wasn't when they plan EVs to be profitable but when they expect them to pay off. Which means this includes investments costs that were made which are helping future projects as well. Like a battery test center or expertise in electric motors and batteries.

And that estimate you posted is from 2016 (you know when Tesla didn't make any money as well) and it tries to predict costs of a unreleased product. Yet again Chevrolet didn't say anything about profitability.

The model 3 didn't come with fm radio or automatic wipers out of the factory. I wouldn't call that complete.  
And BMW already has a keep climate on mode and a working alarm system. The reason why they don't add something like sentry is simply because it's illegal in Germany to film people without consent. So it would open a completely new can of legal worms.  

Tesla simply slaps a disclaimer at it that you should only use it if it's legal and calls it a day. Something that you can do when you don't expect your customer base to sue you but not something a large OEM can do.  
Heck I know of lawsuits from people that locked their child into a car and then tried to sue the OEM because they were scared. No sane lawyer would ever allow something like dog mode to exist because it could imply that it's fine to leave the child, dog or whatever in the car. And if something happens you've got a pretty big problem even if it's not your fault."
"No I think Tesla still has the highest range options.  
But on a range per € scale Tesla has already been beaten."

"Do you have any simplified equations that kinda tell that doubling/tripling story? Some sort of modified breguet range equation for electrics or something? (Asking wanting you learn a little bit, not doubting or challenging your assertions)"
It’s easy to find <2€ in France and Germany. I don’t think I’ve ever paid €2.50 for 100LL.
So what you're saying is that we need an electric Tu-95.  I'd fly on it.  Fucking badass.
"You know, let's just end this here. You buy what you want to buy. I'll buy what I want to buy. Best of luck."
Interesting.
"Not sure, I only did it for light aircraft and private planes. I'd be guessing pretty badly for regional and international but it depends how much you want to get creative changing the cruise attitude and other exotic ideas"
Sorry it was a long time ago and it was a bunch of Matlab and calculations
I was confused at first why they were delivering a black Model X when you ordered a white Model Y. Congrats!
"Just out of curiosity, anyone else getting double rainbow vibes from this clip?"
You're like [excited train guy](https://youtu.be/6lutNECOZFw) but with more damn hell ass swearing.
"I enjoy the video if your property more than the car, and I love that car."
I’m retired enlisted military and I sell cable TV and Internet for a major provider. No degree I’m just an old guy whose kids are off on their own and decided to have a little fun before I get too old to enjoy life.
[Would you just look at it!?](https://youtu.be/EF8GhC-T_Mo)
You sound like a YouTube thumbnail
Your excitement and admiration for the car is adorable.
"Congrats dude, you sound like a kid in Christmas morning, and I mean this is the best way possible. It's evoked within you childhood excitement and joy."
"“You can’t see this on the internet!” As I’m watching it on the internet. Congrats on the purchase, the enthusiasm is awesome."
Beautiful. Enjoy!
I’m having [double rainbow](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI&t=25s) flashbacks.
"I think we should all aspire to be as excited about something in life, as OP is about his Model Y."
They were driving on the public roads without number plate?
"Yikes, **Volume Warning**"
"hfwire: ""You can't see this on the Internet""
....
Me: ""...but..I'm seeing this. On the Internet."""
You can't see this on the internet
YOU CAN'T SEE THIS ON THE INTERNET!
wow your reaction made me so stoked for you! congrats stranger!
I worked for a company that delivered new cars to there owners.  And Tesla owners ar always the best and the happiest.
Want!
"TL;DR: TSLA 04/09 $200 Puts.

P.S. Congrats!"
Oh man that does look nice
"Haha, reminds me of the double rainbow video from many moons ago. 

“It’s so intense! What doe it mean?!”

I’d have the same reaction, too, it’d just be internalized and come out as a gasp."
I love your enthusiasm!
Wow..what a beauty 😛😛😛
That’s the exact model y I have on order.  Looks sick! Congrats!!!
the model Y looks awesome.
I totally saw this on the internet
"Need nsfw tag. 

Must be crazy feeling to see your MY for the first time and it be yours! Congrats!"
Damn Tesla’s are so beautiful and great inventions. I’ve been trying to save money for one but my current car loves to break down on me quite a bit. But soon  🙏🏽🙏🏽 I will
They still haven’t addressed the color mismatch on rear bumber?? Or is that just the camera angle?
Congratulations!  I like everything about it except the wheels.
"As someone from Colorado, I see that glass on top and it scares the hell out of me. I feel like you would crack that so fast."
OMGoodness!  Am so happy for you!  Thanks for sharing this excitement!
cringey
Love the excitement! Congrats!
Wow!!! Congrats
Beautiful ride! Congrats!
Much better muted.
"Can't find your reply about not getting the FSD yet, but buying stock and then buying the FSD with the appreciation is a great idea.  FSD will be even better in 6 to 9 months anyway.  Smart man!"
"Hell yeah, dude! Rock on!"
All white cars eh?
"You got the Big Dog. It's beautiful, enjoy and be safe."
"Damn, looks fabuloso."
The excitement in this mans voice is why I’m so heavily invested in Tesla.
Imagine something like that just showing up one day
Loving it!!! Will be getting mine next year.
Sweet.
Lol 😆 I know it was a dumb thing to say. What I meant was the awesomeness of the car doesn’t translate on a monitor
Beautiful color! Congrats!.
Congratulations! Welcome to the Tesla family!
What an excellent customer experience. No price or finance chatter. The decision was already made and you knew exactly what you wanted. Seamless delivery and enjoyment of your new car.
It's like the future came to see you!!!! Awesome video!!!
I totally get the excitement. Enjoy!
"Low key it really bothers me that you barely even acknowledge the guy delivering your car. All you do is tell him to stop the car. No greeting at all. No ""Hello, thank you, wow man thank you"" or anything. 

I get being wrapped up in the moment, but that kinda shit also reveals how people really are, no matter how stoked you are."
"Forgive me, I'm a noob with a noob question:

How does this process actually work? If they deliver it to your house, that means it's unregistered and without plates. Isn't it illegal to drive a car without plates? 

How do you get it registered and get plates?"
And I'm just here waiting for my 7 seater.
 But we actually CAN see it on the internet 😎
Does Model Y come with chrome delete factory? Man that looks gorgeous in pearl whilte. Enjoy it!
Congratulations!!! Great video!!!
You sound like the guy getting excited about the train.   Congratulations on your car my friend.
Hahahhaha LOVE it
Looks alright. Hope you enjoy
That is a great looking car.  Congrats!
Congrats my dude. Love it
It's hella nice!
Dad boner! Well deserved.
Looking forward to my Cybertruck dual motor.
I wish I was that excited about something.
It didn’t deliver itself to you? Pfft!
"Dang, I love that house.  Is the 5th wheel yours too??"
"Nice house, dude."
I am jealous. Congrats!
Damn it looks so good
I wouldn't mind the job of bringing model y to people's house.
Now I want that black X performance
Added tag and thank you!
"Calm down man. It's just a car. 

Jk. I'd have reacted the same way. Lol"
Why is this marked NSFW?
This is like that train guy or the double rainbow video but for a Tesla.
Double rainbow all the way
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say this was delivered to the South Bay
"Congrats. Reminds me of my reaction with my pm3 and lrawd (wife).  Love white on black wheels! Love the 2.99 0 to 60. 

This one is quite quick too. I'm sure you are happy every single time you get in it.

Congratulations!!"
"I do wish tesla would put ""performance "" or something a little different to differentiate the models.  Looks so bad ass, I guess it doesn't really matter.  So clean"
"The excitement is contagious haha. One thing that’s still kind of disappointing is the visible color difference between the rear bumper and the body, but honestly it’s such a gorgeous car I don’t think I’d even be upset about it haha.

*cries in 100% added car taxes*"
What tint are the back windows?
I love the joy in your voice man! Enjoy it!
"No, not double rainbow, [Olaf](https://youtu.be/UFatVn1hP3o), and there’s nothing better than Olaf.😎👍"
I wish I could get this excited about anything.
I wish I got this excited about anything in life. I’m dead inside.
"First, living in a tiny space in the Bay Area your home looks like a compound (and is awesome!)

Second, best part is learning first hand what your new Tesla can do. It will surprise you, impress you and with over the air updates that feeling doesn’t stop. I’ve had my car for almost 2 years and just got freaking tracking mode 2! It’s like a completely new car now. Congrats!"
It would have been better if there Tesla delivered itself autonomously.
You sound like the double rainbow guy. I mean that in the best possible way.
I want the roadster! Fuck these hip soccer mom cars
I wish the 3/Y front fascia looked like the X's.
Beauty
White is the best IMO so beautiful with P wheels 😭
"Love that white on the Y!  And Performance too?  Did you get FSD?  Should be recognizing Stop light and stop signs pretty soon.  You're a lucky man, I'm jealous!"
That flat lighting reminds me of Mendocino.
The car looks sick. IMO much better looking than the 3 as the proportions feel right.
Nice compound you got there...
Congrats! Any reason why you chose the Y over the 3?
Had the volume up. RIP my ear drums. Happy for you though 100%

This.
The red line under the dual motor is how you can tell. You probably knew that.
Thank you! We were driving on back roads today so I figured it was something that only works on the highway. I did see the blue speed and the gray steering wheel but naturally I couldn’t make it do anything.
"Honestly both the Y and the X look ugly to me. The 3, S, and cybertruck look so much better"
Can't wait for the day when Tesla car deliveries are just the car driving itself to your house
Wait. It has double reverse taillights? My european m3p has only one and the other one is the fog light.
My father and I went to pick up his and he returned it and asked for a new one due to similar bumper discoloration. Sad
I would like to publicly acknowledge and thank the two individuals who gave me Reddit awards. I never imagined sharing a dorky video with a little bit of bad language would be as popular as it is. I’m humbled by those of you who gave good feedback and positive reinforcement.
"Cries in Canadian. All ready for delivery of mine with cash in hand but this virus is fucking it all up goddamn it.  Be lucky if I get my order by next year now.

I know peoples health is on the line and I don’t want to minimize that, but sometimes it’s the (small) things to keep (my) spirits up."
Since when is Tesla doing deliveries home?
"Yeah, only $70k"
what does it mean!?
I’m embarrassed at my swearing but what can I say. I wasn’t filtering.
Cool but the guy didn't have gloves or a mask
Neeeeeerrrrd
Nice car but your over-excitment actually made me like it less.
The Y is like an even-dorkier 3. Can’t wait for German auto to start making some ok electric cars.
what does dual motor mean? looks good
What's your favourite car colour?
I know this is kinda unrelated but the model y looks like someone tried displaying a concept of the model 3 in 18:9 on a 4:3 display and it just stretched the height and that’s what made it to production.
That hatch goes straight up into the bumper. Won’t survive a slight tap very well. Otherwise gorgeous design.
"I’m biased because I own a white compact SUV, but damn that looks good!

https://i.imgur.com/FLU2vmi.jpg"
Congrats!
How many miles does the Y performance get compared to the Y long range?
So cringe
"Ugghhhh, the model Y looks so good. I just got my model 3 back in september, and now I kinda regret it. :("

"I want to say I'm glad you like your car and I love Tesla.  I know everyone has different tastes, but am I the only one that doesn't like the way the Y looks?"
"If not now, when? Then next year another reason comes along.  I feel like supporting a company that will face challenges through the economic downturn is better than canceling my order. I’m done worrying about my family’s future. They already have their own lives. What’s the point for working 30 years and always holding back. No, now is the perfect time for me. For others? Maybe not. I respect their decision to wait or not based on individual comfort."
Do you have something against white vehicles or something?
A cool trick for future deliveries: Have them summon the car into the parking lot :)
It’s a shame it looks so ugly from behind though :/ like a big whale or something..
I’m so happy for you!
you guys getting it delivered to your house?
S
This car is going to be a huge hit.
It’s yuuuggeee
"So lucky to have $$$ to buy model X, Y, camper and huge house"
[removed]
"Lol I was watching the first part of the video thinking ""damn the Y really does look like a baby Model X"""
Ha! Me too! I didn’t expect to see the Y behind the fence.
"Haha I was thinking ""Don't tell him, or Telsa that they gave him an X instead of a Y.""  🤣"
This is where I expected them to prioritize convoy mode as an early step of self-driving.  it seems like today’s technology should be able to do that. Why does Tesla need two people to deliver a car?
DUAL MOTOR!
Yes
Full on all the way
"More this, tbh: https://youtu.be/EF8GhC-T_Mo"
Double motor all the way!
Double Tesla!
I was just going to say that!
"Yes. Said to my partner before opening the comments there will be a double rainbow comment for sure..

'it's beginning to look like a triple motor omg'"
"I didn't at first just overly high excitement but yes sir, most definitely."
"Yeah, I was thinking of what did it remind me of, but couldn’t put my finger on it."
Or the [double rainbow guy](https://youtu.be/OQSNhk5ICTI)
This guy creamed his pants at least 5 times when filming it
Never seen this before! Thanks for putting a smile on my face
"Hahahahaha I wish I hadn’t swore, too late now 🤷🏻‍♂️"
LMAO!!!! That guy definitely creamed his pants when he heard that horn
omg thank you!!!!
"Agree,  OP has a lovely home"
Haha ditto.
"For some reason reminds me of the ""NINTENDO SIXTY FOUURRRRRRR"" video hahaha"
Yeah looks like a nice peaceful location. Must’ve paid a premium for that
"This video is clearly intended to be a not-so-subtle flex, poorly masked by cringey over-the-top excitement antics."
Haha totally! Car looks beautiful too though
That has fun written all over it. Enjoy!
[deleted]
😂 I know right? Almost didn’t post it because I’m such a dork.
I clicked this hoping to see Ed and you didn't disappoint!
😱
"I interpreted that as ""it looks so much better in person""."
Came here to say this!
"You *can* if your doing exactly what they were doing. Untagged vehicle followed by a tagged one, going directly to the house of the new owner, where it will sit until registered.









If you get pulled over it'd be a quick conversation. ""just bought it / delivering it, here's the paper work, that car will drive me home.""








My friend works at a car dealership and I've followed him to deliveries like this before. Regardless, this is what happens after every third-party sale. (e.g. Buying a 2005 Rav4 off Craigslist) It's more common than you think."
In my state the company you bought it from will stick a little yellow temporary tag in the back window.  Its good for 3 weeks but I had to renew mine 3 times before my plates came in.  MN has a boondoggle of new computer systems for the DMV was still backed up nearly a year later.
"When it is first backing up, you can see the temp tag in the back window"
Usually there is a temporary hand written number plate on the back window usually good for about a month. Then a couple of days or weeks later you receive a metal stamped plate or two depending on the state to mount on your car.
[deleted]
Yea sorry about that...
"shush, let people enjoy things"
"Interesting, so people often are joyful to see it in real life? Maybe it’s because we are taking a chance often ordering site unseen?"
Sorry I did mark it but it blocks the pic and I think the audience can handle it.
"I noticed it later after it was mentioned but If you’re not looking for it, it’s not obvious. The pearlescent white paint has a shimmering quality about it."
I worry about curbing them
I was going to buy full self driving but I thought I better use of my money would be to buy more shares of Tesla. When I get the cybertruck and if my wife decided she wants to keep the Y for herself then I will buy her the full self driving.
I have a Red B6 S4 and a Stromboli Grey Alfa Romeo Stelvio
"So we spoke on the phone numerous times and he was to stay at a distance. Our instructions were to act as though there was no contact whatsoever, it’s called “contactless delivery.” At the Tesla service center had it been delivered that way, you go up to the parking lot with your phone and you never even interact with any humans whatsoever. Thanks for your concern."
In my state the company you buy the car from sticks a little yellow temporary tags in the rear window.  They are good for 3 weeks while you wait for your plates to come.  I had to go back 3 times to get it renewed since the DMV was backed up to a new software system with lots of problems.
"Every state is different. Up until recently in California you could drive a car for 6 months after purchase without any license plate. That's changed in the past few years, but every state has weird rules."
"They have the registration paper work filled out on Tesla's website before delivery.  When you take possession of the car, they give you a temp plate thats good for a few weeks, then your real one comes in the mail."
Yes it’s standard chrome delete. It’s they only way they come.
So many people have said this I’m gonna have to look up the train video. I’ve seen the one with the double rainbow already.
Because I say cuss words?
"Nope, West of Seattle across the ferry"
Stock
I was too until I got the car. Maybe why I totally overreacted.
"The thing about contactless delivery as you don’t get the walk-through. I figured most of it out so far, but while cruise control works perfectly fine, it does not stay in the lane on its own. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I also had a hell of a time figuring out how to get YouTube premium to work but that was solved with Plex.tv."
4 dogs bro
"Oh, so do I, believe me. I saw a guy who printed a 3-D facia placard that goes across the front that makes it look kind of like the model S that’s pretty cool."
"I didn’t get FSD yet; Rather than drop $7000 on the technology, I put 7000 into stock. Once my wife tells me she will take over the model Y once my cybertruck comes, I might buy it."
Thank you! We have three Sheltie’s and so it works for us. Too bad the best internet I can buy maxes out at 10meg.
"I’m coming off of a BMW F-series and would have preferred the Model 3 quite frankly. My wife is strictly a crossover SUV gal. She is on the second Alfa Romero Stelvio Ti Sport. Since I have a tri-motor cybertruck on order, I bought the Model Y as a stopgap to enjoy the Tesla world prior to getting my truck. Im hoping when I. 2 years the Alfa lease is over, she’ll take over the Y and then we are ICE free!"
Sorry bout that
For years now... depends on your location and how close to the end of the quarter it is...
mildflex
🤷🏻‍♂️
I'm sorry Teslas aren't 'furry' enough for you.
"It literally has 2 motors. One powers the front wheels, one powers the back."
"All wheel drive. One motor for the front, one for the back. As opposed to rear wheel drive (single-motor) which won’t be available until next year."
"Without the performance package, they are basically the same. LR 316, Performance 315.

With the performance package, it gets 280."
"Don’t regret it. The Model 3 is still an amazing car and if it wasn’t for that car the Model Y would have no platform to exist on. 

But if you rlly regret it that much I’d be more than happy to take it off your hands"
"Felt the same way about my model S when the 3 came out lol. We always want the next best thing, it’s human nature. 

It wasn’t until I got rear ended and was without the car for 4 months that I really began to appreciate it again."
Meh.
Post a picture of your car so we can see how many likes you get.
13 kinds of ugly. Oof.
GTFU dufus.
"When I saw the front and that big empty white area, I could only picture painting a shark mouth with pointy teeth"
I love the whiteee
It’s the type of car that just makes so much sense in person.
"Hence being a ""bad ass"" then!"
Pretty certain the X is the person taking the delivery individual back.
I’ve worked really hard my whole life. Started multiple small businesses. Did it all on my own.
[deleted]
What’s your problem? This car is a beautiful piece of modern engineering and technology.
[deleted]
I was confused by the front of the X. I’m like why it look like that? Took me a minute. Kinda funny their delivering a model Y in a model X. If it’s not being towed you think they would just use another model Y or model 3.
"Looks great, better than the X in my opinion - and man - those 21"" wheels look AMAZING!!"
Lol same thing here
"Technical limitations aside, you can’t legally operate a car on public roads without a driver in most jurisdictions."
"> convoy mode

u/wgc123: if a convoy gets broken up (eg. red stop light, accident, diversion, traffic jam), each vehicle **needs to be able to continue by itself**—ie. ""convoy mode"" is an add-on energy optimisation for *after* FSD is solved.  FSD is a prerequisite, otherwise ""convoy"" is the same old geo-fenced game.

…and talking about ""convoy"" is partly to dispel fears by truckers about being surplus to requirements—""convoy captain"" sounds like an upgrade, and much cooler than being out of a job."
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
ALL THE WAYYY
This guy was surely on shrooms
That’s what makes it more funny tho...
And the RV in the background pretty cool too
I think it's more like the '[Excited Train Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lutNECOZFw)'
You ok man?
"Agreed. I got this in my general feed and was wondering why the guy was so over the top for a car that is shaped like a ladybug (video reminded me of the double rainbows video from yesteryear). Then I looked at the subreddit.

Sorry. You like what you like. Sorry to intrude. Carry on."
"Well, there was a fault code on the front drive unit inverter board, but they fixed, loaned me a Model X (Model Y P waaaaay more fun) and some additional services. Overall, couldn’t be more satisfied and I’m absolutely convinced I’ve bought the finest car for the money available on the market. Soooooo glad I have an amazing new addition in the form of an amazing vehicle; and lifestyle as a Tesla investor, owner, and enthusiast. I highly recommend it."
Mind if I ask what you do for a living so I can pretend it’s the same thing I do and dream of this being me one day on my own beautiful property with my own beautiful cars?
Thanks for the info!
In California dealers will print you a temp plate with a plate number right then that's good for like 2 or 3 months. They used to just put those inserts with the dealer branding on it but people would drive unregistered cars for years.
The Tesla employee that delivered my car last May took an Uber back to the service center.
"It popped up right after. Thanks. My grade school kids got a good laugh out of it. Wife, not so much lol."
"C'mon man, that is no excuse. Dude, you kept your distance, which is great, but that doesn't mean you barely acknowledge his presence. The only thing you said to him was an order on where to stop the car. If you can do that, you can also acknowledge another living person with a show of appreciation for delivering your car. He drove it to you all that way. This is really a bad try at an excuse. 

Not even ""Hello!""

I just hope from this that next time you can just treat people as people. Really think about it. Like I shudder to think of how you treat waiters. I know I am just a faceless dude on the internet. But I just hope you think about that interaction a bit more and if you make it a habit of being like that, and then if you are actually okay with it. I've said my piece."
"Ah, I see. I had the sound off."
"ooo, good taste"
"On the screen if Traffic Aware Cruise Control is on, the current speed with turn blue. If you’re in a place with autopilot the gray steering wheel icon will appear to the left of the speedometer. Lightly double tap down twice and the steering wheel icon will turn blue. You can only engage AP when it shows the gray steering wheel icon.

Tesla has some tutorials built in, but for such an advanced car I don’t think it hurts to give the manual a read through. The car keeps evolving and I don’t think I’ve gone more than two weeks without learning something new. Congrats again!"
That's really unfortunate about the internet. I'm excited for your new model Y. The color combo is what I would most likely do if I had the opportunity to order one.
"Good plan!

When you get the cybertruck, you'll have an even faster car than a Model 3 to enjoy (assuming you go for the Performance model)."
EU Slovakia
Worth it. Did acceleration trials on backroads today. Indescribable.
Ayyy
"Nice, thanks."
We don’t know the real LR single motor numbers right? It’s a couple hundred pounds lighter so should be 320-330 range
The model S is better then the 3 tho...
"They're a troll, check their comment history. Downvote and ignore, soon enough they won't be able to post."
[removed]
The employees probably just wanted an excuse to take the X out for a spin. Looks like it's a performance model. That's how it worked when I was there haha
I don’t think they have any spare model Y’s sitting around. Any on the lot are probably waiting for delivery
The S and the Y are the best looking Teslas you can get right now.
Agreed
"thats The problem, isn’t it, it’s ilegal.  Frankly I don’t get the optimism about a potential technical solution to self driving, because i‘m very pessimistic about the legal solution.  In both cases, it seems like we could and should press for limited cases to be legalized In the hope of getting them soo er

ideally it is much simpler to legalize convoy mode, because it is simpler to implement.  I believe we’ve reached technological maturity sufficient for implementing it, there are fewer requirements than for actual self-driving, and you still have a driver to take responsibility.

this would cover a few use cases such as Tesla delivery and truck convoys, and starts giving us legal and practical experience with self-driving, or a subset of it

i wonder if there is a market for taxi pod trains.  You see all these futuristic ideas of taxi pods without drivers, but that is wishful thinking or at least far in the future.  However what if you had pods with separate “ tow” vehicles?  You can take your time getting settled in your pod, until the driver shows up and engages convoy mode.  At your destination, he can just cut you loose and the pod will pull over and park while the driver picks up his next “tow”. If you’re going someplace busy like an airport, the driver can pass your pod over to a larger convoy, while going back to local “tows”.   Maybe truckers can have side gigs for long distance “tows”."
">if a convoy gets broken up (eg. red stop light, accident, diversion, traffic jam), each vehicle needs to be able to continue by itself

Why?  If a convoy gets broken up, why can’t the trailing vehicle pull off the road and stop?  Maybe for truckers, you can’t easily come back around to pick the other one up, or if you have multiple followers, but this case is one leader with one follower"
THEYS TWO
"At least he wasn't seeing things... I can see a double rainbow, too... Woah... maybe I am on shrooms, too ."
"I thought that and was like yeah, this guy can easily afford a Tesla. Wish I could too."

"Dude got his car much earlier than expected in the first wave of deliveries. It's also been highly anticipated. Plus, it's pretty cool that they delivered it right to his house to keep him from having to interact with anyone."

"In MN, they submit the paperwork to the DMV and the plates are sent to the shop you bought the car from.  This makes it hard to escape licensing your car or paying sales tax."
"Dude, as someone who used to own a restaurant, you would love to have me as your guest. Anyway, I acknowledge your right to an opinion. Have a good one."
Redrover my dude... I’m sorry but you’re an absolute buffoon and have no idea what you’re talking about. Lecturing some dude about his personality on the internet based of a 1 minute clip? If I were the Tesla employee it would make my day to see OP so excited about his new car.
"I have no idea my friend, especially now.  Good luck!"
In some ways. I like the size and how the 3 feels.
Not a 2015 with old CPU lol.

"Oh wow this is so entertaining. Please say more, anything!"
Tesla fanboys are definitely lame but these cars are not.
Sounds good to me! I would probably have done the same thing.
"The X also has Bio Defense mode, so I could see them being semi useful here.  I mean, this is part of the reason bio defense mode exists, no?"
Lol rlly
I think they needed a way back home...
"I still think the 3 is better looking than the Y. But opinions, you know, they are different.

The S is pure sex though."
Imo the model X and roadster are my 2 favourites
"> why can’t the trailing vehicle pull off the road and stop?

u/wgc123: Think of a ""[ramp meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramp_meter)""—traffic lights on the *entrance* to a Freeway/Motorway/Autobahn—with no hard shoulder and the next exit is in 30 miles (50 km).

Or trying to play ""follow that car"" in a dense urban area; or *any* location (whole countries) with [""zipper"" merging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_merge).  Separation will eventually occur because of pedestrians/lights/turning/merging—and at that moment *each* and *every* vehicle must be able to fend for itself."
DUAL MOTOR ALL THE WAY!
Just get a Cybertruck and a camper in a few years and live in that.
This. Is. Special!
Same thing here since they still technically hold the title unless you buy it outright. They just give you a temp plate now until they come in.
We chatted after... would it matter that I had 5 calls from 5 different people within the 2 hours prior to delivery and had I not looked out the window I’m not sure I would have ever even see the young delivery driver.
An absolute buffoon? I stopped reading after that
MCU2 is being offered.
"Stay mad my friend, if that's how you choose to spend your time that's fine by me."
Except they gotta ride together on the way back now.
"Fun to joke about, but thankfully this pandemic isn't airborne so Bio Defense doesn't do much.

Edit:

From the WHO, COVID-19 is not airborne.

>According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes.
>
>Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be particles < 5μm in diameter, and which result from the evaporation of larger droplets or exist within dust particles. They may remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m.

"From the guy I was replying to: 

>if it’s not being towed you think they would just use another model Y or model 3."
The current roadster or the upcoming roadster?
I hear you. Congrats on the new car by the way u/hfwire !
With your IQ I’m surprised you made it that far!
For 2015s?
"The Y driver uses the baggage compartment on the way back.

Just be lucky they're not delivering two cars..."
"Here's a few links to decide for yourself. It seems the CDC here in the US has taken a more ambiguous approach. They have a banner on the top of the page clearly stating we don't know fully yet and they go on to say this.

 ""The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.""

So they don't declare it airborne, but they don't say airborne transmission is impossible either. Seems like a minor distinction. 
The reality is we don't really know because of how new this is and how little time we've had to study it. 

U.S. CDC current guidance, updated March 4th so a bit old: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html

WHO March 29th update: ""In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed; ""

NPR interview with Dr. Milton on March 29th specifically addressing the WHO's update: ""I think the WHO is being irresponsible in giving out that information. This misinformation is dangerous,"" says Dr. Donald Milton, an infectious disease aerobiologist at the University of Maryland's School of Public Health.

What you mean its not airborne? Someone with virus coughs near people and they get sick. Does that not count as airborne?
"Starting to look like WHO is wrong.
There is a great interview with the head of infectious diseases in South Korean who explains it can be airborne from small spit droplets in enclosed places where people are singing or shouting in close proximity.  Exemplified by many super spreader events including this one:

OG roadster is my favorite looking Tesla.  Which they weren't increasing in price.
Wow I wonder why you are defending people who don't respect other humans
No because you get infected by the droplets that are shot across by the patient sneezing. The virus can't travel in the air
Makes sense
"Surely if the droplets are small enough, they float, like water vapour does?

Humidity is just water droplets small enough to float."
"Yes, size is how they determine airborne vs droplet. The cutoff is when droplet get small enough to stay in the air and linger instead of falling to the ground quickly. So that’s like the difference between someone infecting you by coughing on you vs merely breathing near you."
[Here](https://youtu.be/F1JEbx9NY2I) is a video by Dr. John Campbell on the difference between airborne and droplet transmission.
"Humidity is water vapor. Water droplets are liquid water in small portions. The difference, you ask? Probably: you not having any electricity starting in a few days :) Lots of electric power is generated using steam turbines. Those IIRC. get destroyed if you dump wet steam on them - steam with suspended water droplets. Those suckers erode stuff like no tomorrow."
"Hmmm...  I'm unsure if water vapor is extremely tiny water droplets (but still made up from tens, hundreds or thousands of H2O molecules), or rather every water molecule is isolated from every other water molecule."
"How can you be unsure? Water vapor is a gas. That’s how it’s defined. It’s not subject to interpretation. People have agreed that that’s why water vapor means. Same goes for humidity: a measure of the amount of water vapor (a GAS) in a gas mixture.

The whole deal about gas vs liquid is that in gases the molecules are freed from each other. It’s in the very definition of gas. If you have water mist suspended in water vapor, it’s called wet steam and not water vapor anymore, just as air with liquid oxygen mist suspended in it is not just air anymore. And yes, if you cool the air a bit you can have beautiful oxygen fog, just like you can get beautiful water fog closer to room temperature.

In any gas (air included), presence of water mist in steady state implies 100% relative humidity, and at that point it’s not a gas but what is commonly called fog: a suspension of droplets in gas. But humidity is the gaseous part of that mix, and it only covers water (and not, say, liquid methane)."
"> The whole deal about gas vs liquid is that in gases the molecules are freed from each other. It’s in the very definition of gas.

Sure in theory, but I'm wondering in practice how common clumps of H2O molecules are in such 'water vapour' even with say only 10% relative humidity at room temperature. I'm speculating even it started off as a pure gas, the molecules would start finding each other very quickly, and clumping, especially at room temperature, or even 50-75c. I could be wrong of course.

And yep, ""water steam"" (maybe up to a trillion H2O molecules per 'droplet'?) would float anyway as you say."
"If he makes them in the 3/4-closed car factory, all of the sudden that facility is critical infrastructure."
"And this kids, is how the model X battery powered multi-patient mobile ventilator was born. Biohazard mode coupled with the SpaceX space suit and adaptor harness, one MX can effectively support 20 patients with a runtime of 7 days without external power."
"Tesla stock just did a 5% uptick in the last 30 mins of this tweet.

Edit now 10% up 20 minutes later."
"Where does it say they're buying them? There's interest in buying, but retooling to build them, get approval, etc, will take some time."
Will Tesla branded ventilators come complete with easter eggs? Particularly fart noises?
"So, I thought it was crazy that the Sheriff announced non-compliance with a regulation over Twitter. Now we have people requesting critical medical devices over Twitter.

Its still weird to me, but I guess this really is the way things are now."
"This is far from the first time he has offered help to random humanitarian projects.

Bulk buying RO water systems for Flint and the cave-diver shit storm come to mind. Also, unlike that last one, they ( both, but SpaceX's CrewDragon ECLSS more than Teslas BioWeapon defense mode) already have experience with positive pressure ventilation systems, so the interface (most likely a ~~nasal cannula~~ bronchial tube) is they only big piece left and i assume they can be given a design for that and run with it."
"In before he calls some CEO of an existing medical ventilator manufacturer a pedophile. 

(Too soon? It really is funny you know.)"
Good to hear. Especially since Elon has been downplaying covid-19 recently.
"and an observation, TSLAQ is out in full force on twitter, I guess they have an interest of TSLA going lower, and lower for profit. parasites...."
Waiting for Sandy Munro to do a tear-down of the Tesla ventilator.
Knew I should have bought TSLA yesterday.
Are these things simple to make? How do you just start cranking out ventilators?
Maybe now Tesla will consider adding biodefense mode to Model 3 and Y.
"Medical devices need a shit ton of approvals and certificates.

Is there a shortcut to this if a state of emergency is declared?"
Living and breathing Tesla now!
NYC has said they still haven't heard from Musk after these tweets.  This is BS PR.  Misleading headline.
"He goes from this isn't a real problem, to there aren't shortages, to prove there are shortages, to we'll make ventilators in the space of days. Too bad he couldn't accept what actual experts were saying last week."
Prepare to see the world's best ventilator.
"Please, no performance or stealth models. Not a time to test how quickly we can breath or push air. We are all excited for an SR (Standard Rate) Model V."
This title is not even close to true yet. You must work in the media.
"What the current ventilator manufacturers need to do is play assembler, they should be made to distribute even further part manufacturing out to as many places as possible. Liability should be suspended and IP adjustments made."
How does “we’ll talk” translate into the OP headline?
"No - they have an informal agreement that Tesla will give it a shot, and New York plans to buy them if it all works.

Tesla has to make them before New York can buy them. And though Tesla makes great cars, we can all agree that they are clearly not the best manufacturer in general. New York would probably be better served if they went to a maker of powertools or motorized toys. There just are not many similarities between EVs and ventilators; very few that could help Tesla make them faster."
"For the love of god, Just please don't call the Mayor a pedo if it doesn't work out."
We shall now pray that Elon doesn't call someone a 'pedo guy' like the last time his company tried to help out with something
And yet he’s down playing the entire virus on Twitter. I don’t get it.
"more importantly than anything else, is to keep his 20k workers employed and working and earning, and able to provide for the family , not able to earn a paycheck can be much more devastating to the family and economy and the nation as a whole"
"This is a win win for everyone involved, good on Elon 👍"
Have any of you guys been to r/technology? It really seems like it should be called r/hateElon ...
All you musk hating fuckers saying he just wants to stay open STFU. Look at what Musk has said about Tesla and Space X mission. He wants to make a better future for humanity. And that includes the immediate future.
"See, like any person Elon thought coronavirus is much noise over nothing, all governments unfortunately did the same. Every person did the same in their own life.

But now he knows. And Elon's gonna gonna show what he's really made of."
Elon is playing catch-up.  Other auto manufacturers already announced they were going to pitch in and help with this.
Ventilators secured.
"This. Will. Not. Happen.

This is interesting. Will they be made in fremont?
Have they ensured GxP?
thats great to hear. glad elon stepped in a good way.

"A ""ventilator"" in German (same writing) is a ""fan"" and for the past few days I was like: ""Why the hell do you need fans? This ain't important, you Americans are so obsessed about your A/C and stuff.""

TIL a ventilator is a ""breathing machine thingey""."
"The problem is getting a design and the components to do it, not sure if they have components that could be modified to work in a ventilator."
Model V Performance
NYC Mayor's office confirms they haven't heard from Musk or Tesla.
Meanwhile they are restricting how many employees can show up to work at the Ca gigafactory.
"Yeah, because I'm sure Tesla somehow has a supply chain locked down for ventilator components already..."
In Musk we Trust.
Vaporware.
Musk gonna build a microscopic submarine that goes inside the body to destroy the virus.
"He’s gotta improve his reputation after trying to keep the factory open.

Hopefully this turns out better than the Thailand submarine."
"Their best bet would be to essentially copy/modernize an old completely pneumatic ventilator like the [Bird Mark 8](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Bird_Mark_8_Medical_respirator1.JPG), compact, easily modified for PEEP/IMV with a servo. Easy to mass-produce and ship. Can it do as much as a fully digital modern one? No, however the electronics components will take far too long to produce right now, going all pneumatic is the way to go."
"And all thanks to Nate Silver trolling his ass!

Nice to see Elon finally lend a hand. He's been on the sidelines far too long during this crisis, considering the number of resources he has at his disposal. 

#2020 VISION!"
He’s endangering his workers and has been so by ignoring local ordinances. All to hit numbers
I think everyone agrees Musk is real life Tony Stark.

It's a tweet.
Hold on!...it hasn’t even been 24 hours since Musk suggested they can make ventilators and NY is already buying these? NYC not buying anything cause there’s nothing to buy yet so cut the BS

Call it a car. States must allow sale of Tesla’s in order  to purchase. Win win.
"""Step aside. Elon is here""."
Mask is a smart business man but holly shit he loves to open his mouth before thinking and it drives me crazy because there is a whole lot of like to kneel down and eat his ass.
Buying?really Elon?
"Starlink, Tesla and SpaceX (and even PayPal) are companies designed to solve the next generation's problems.. years from now. This is a problem that needs to get resolved in March 2020, not March 2050. 

If he would keep his staff paid, employed, healthy and help contain this disease by reducing on-site time requirements, he's a real hero."
4D Chess?
"The ventilators are built in such a way that they can only be delivered via a Model Y, so we need to ensure Tesla still has the manufacturing capability for those vehicles.

Probably."
"Yes, but I believe they are still not allowed to make cars. But I may be out of date. Things are happening quite rapidly."
yep
"I strongly suspect that was part of the reason he offered... its smart. Good press, keeps factory going, etc. Also helps."
"He won't let the sherriff win over this.  The guy lets amazon warehouses stay open and fast food joints cross contaminating between customers, but he closes a factory with minimal person to person contact."
And cars will be just side products. Because the whole assembly line has to be turned on by master switch... you know :)
"From what I understand, they're just not allowed to assemble cars."
jesus
They will probably build them at giga NY.
"Ding-ding-ding.

I like Elon, but I'd also bet a lot that this is about 50% attention seeking (a la pedo submarines) and 50% a way to keep his factories open.

Tesla took some [bad press](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/alameda-sheriff-pressures-tesla-to-shut-down-fremont-factory/) when they tried to keep running even when the rest of the Bay Area was shutting down. The Sheriff had to get involved.

Meanwhile, SpaceX in L.A. managed to get themselves declared a critical government contractor and is staying open.

No doubt Elon connected the dots and realized that if he could get his Tesla factories declared critical, they could keep on working, even if it was on the side.

In order for New York to buy this product, Tesla first has to start manufacturing it. Yet to be seen what the timeline actually is for this."
I hope there’s genuine intent to this. Probably won’t matter in the grand scheme of things. Though If it’s discovered that this was only proposed to continue building cars. It would disrupt my faith in the company.
Yup. He not a dummy
"Funny enough Tesla hasn't yet considered V2G and prefers to sell the powerwall in addition to their cars, making for 10kWh of unnecessary batteries"
Correlation is not causation.
Well shit. There go my hopes of buying in the fire sale.
Wake me up when it's 100%.
"The only way I can see to do this in any reasonable amount of time is if they license exact plans from someone who already makes a reliable and approved device, using as many off the shelf items as possible.  There is no way they can engineer one from scratch with custom parts that all need to be QA tested and have it to market quickly, given that these things have the ability to directly kill people if they malfunction.  Quick and dirty is not OK.

Even then, I assume they use a lot of suppliers for necessarily custom stuff like PCBAs, injection mold tooling, etc. so they’d probably have to wrangle suppliers to make investments as well.  It could work if they got all the technical details from an existing supplier of ventilators.

Best case has got to be some months?"
[deleted]
"Yeah...I was like, have they even made a single ventilator yet?!  Maybe ""ventilator"" is an option on the Model Y?  🤔"
Looking at the articles it sounds like there is a large amount of third party suppliers for parts. So Tesla could probably focus on making parts that are in need. I don't know if their equipment could be used to make everything or not.
"Yeah there's no way to suddenly make high quality ventilators within weeks. These aren't as simple as everyone thinks, you need precise pressure regulation to avoid lung damage and the reliability has to be flawless.

Easiest way is as others have said, have an existing manufacturer license out."
"No sir, generally speaking you don't want the ventilators to make more noises that the staff, and patient, aren't used as it'll confuse folks.  However, the inclusion of a fart smell may not be off the table"
"Well, the alternative is this info being private, or published in one of 50 newspapers as second hand information, or first hand but on one of 1000 local government websites. Personally I prefer the Twitter approach, short announcements and directly from the source."
"Definitely not nasal cannula.  Vents are primarily used on intubated patients(large bore tube through their mouth into their bronchus.  It can also be used in a few different settings to utilize it as a Bipap with different delivery masks.    
what would be really cools is for these companies to really rethink these medical devices.  Would be really cool to see a hi flow nasal cannula made by Dyson, or even a universal charting system made by Google, or infusion devices made by Apple.  God it gets me excited about the possibilities of these tech companies developed medical tech."
It will probably be someone who has a patent on 3D printing airflow T pieces out of stainless steel.

"He doesn't want to do this. On the one hand he's saying ""if needed"", like it isn't, on the other he's tweeting stats showing how this is all overblown.

On the flip side, how quickly will Tesla be able to design, tool and produce a medical grade ventilator?"
He still is
"He's saying the panic is outpacing the facts. Fear and caution is appropriate, panic is ridiculous."
He said panic is unnecessary. Do you believe otherwise?
Catastrophies are the best possible news for a short.  You should have seen them during 911.
"If they are smart, they'll start unwinding their positions \*now\*.  They probably will never get another decent chance."
Q?
"No, and you don't.  Even with a serious relaxation of the regulations, nobody who isn't already making ventilators is going to have a new model available for 12-18 months *minimum*.  The best thing to do is to work with existing manufacturers to eliminate their bottlenecks and supply piece parts they are running low on."
"They could certainly help an existing ventilator manufacturer by making parts for them, but I very highly doubt they'll be making completed units any time soon."
One would assume there would be a short cut. Unsafe device is better than no device and certain death.
"It depends on the state. Iowa is allowing non-fda approved drugs, medical devices, and doctors with suspended or expired licenses. As well as students with enough experience to get their license, but haven't yet."
"If I'm dying and have a choice between death or a non-FDA approved ventilator, guess which one I'll choose?

In a crisis, short-cuts are possible."
"Oh, you!"
"People get things wrong all the time, but when you realize you were wrong and pivot to try to help why do you want to demonize him?"
"He never said it wasn't real, he was saying the panicking was stupid.

He even suggested using Chloroquine days earlier for treatment.

Too bad Tesla doesn't have the [Desktop Metal Production System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/video/production-system/) in-house - they could produce 10's of thousands a day.

EDIT: I Think most of the execs are from Cambridge, they should see the opportunity to help with Boston."
"Would you prefer he continue charging down that path instead of changing his mind and doing something to help?

Also, he said the panic is stupid. Because the panic is stupid. Cleaning out every grocery and big box store of toilet paper and hand sanitizer is fucking stupid. COVID is absolutely a threat, but it isn't a species-ending avian flu with a 60% fatality rate (it's only a matter of time before one of those makes the jump to humans, so we should treat COVID like the first level of a video game where we're fighting a relatively easy enemy to can learn the controls so we don't get stomped by the final boss."
"He never said it wasn’t a real problem. 

People need to carefully look at exactly what Elon actually says and not what they think he meant by it."
"This affliction of self-reliance taken to the extreme is rather common among breakthrough entrepreneurs used to proving others wrong. Musk is, of course, a stand-out example - sometimes he comes across as someone who believes in nothing but himself. In moments like this, he really needs his own Sheryl Sandberg to adjust his perspective."
he has a history of running out of money at Tesla and doesn’t want to risk it again
Yeah. I'm really curious what's going on in his head.... I probably won't accept another submarine incident in this case.
"Because he wants his factories up and running. Thats it, thats the only reason."
"Last time he tried to help, with the submarine cave rescue, he got pilloried. (Admittedly he made some dumb comments too). But once burned twice shy."

He never said or even I plied that this isn't a real problem. Come on man.

I hope he is successful if he goes about trying to make ventilators, but this so far looks like a pretty crazy pattern for Musk where he tries to get PR during every crisis."
After 7 OTA updates.
"Except if the ventilator has a bug, the patient likely dies.

"The tweet Musk is replying to literally says: ""NYC is buying"""
"Tesla has the experience actually. Their HVAC system in their cars is state of the art, they also have SpaceX resources available to them.  One would figure if they can keep people breathing in space they should be able to help with this. 

I'm guessing Elon's hesitation to commit publicly is partly because he's his usual dense self when it comes to public image portrayal, and because he's smart enough not to overpromise and under deliver publicly."
[deleted]
He is down playing the panic.   Which is legit.   You should stop reading headlines and read what he is actually saying.
Except the factory workers.
They’ll hate until their granny is on a Tesla ventilator.
"Not a comment on Musk himself but lots of people throughout our history have worn a similar cloak and had similar mission statements but turned out to personally be awful.

"Your question is completely valid, because two different products are referred to by the same name.

A **ventilator** is a mechanical pump to assist breathing, it has a silicon/plastic face mask with tubes and is used for endotracheal intubated patients. It's a step beyond a CPAP (often used for sleep apnea)... and way better than standing over a patient with a manual resuscitation bag pump. The scarcity of this product is what hospital administrators are freaking out about, because too many patients will need one, all at the same time. *Actually, everyone is freaking because it means doctors will have to* ***choose who won't get one*** *(and then die).*

A **ventilator face mask** is used by medical personnel to protect themselves from being infected by their patients. It is supposed to have a tight fit and be disposable between patients. Some talking heads on TV drop the ""face mask"" and simply refer to them in the shortened form ""ventilator"". The highest quality are designated N95 because they filter 95% of small particles. The scarcity of this product has nurses and doctors freaking because the entire system will collapse if they get sick. 95% protection isn't 100%, and if the same one has to be used all day, the chances of successful viral penetration go up. *Actually, everyone is freaking because it means doctors and nurses risk their own deaths (and their family members too) from their work treating patients* ***to an even greater degree than usual****.*

As an aside: A surgical face mask (pastel colored) is used to protect patients from the exhalations of medical personnel. It fits loosely and is easier to breathe through because it doesn't filter as much. It is a poor second to the N95, but a pretty good compromise in a well ventilated operating room. Different materials make up different types of masks for different purposes such as construction dust and chemicals. Some gas masks are called respirators. 

For us ordinary folks... any barrier to respiratory droplets (perhaps containing COVID-19) is better than nothing. A cotton bandana, a surgical mask, a nail salon mask, a balaclava... just wear something whenever you go out to reduce your chances of contagion. :)  :)  :)"

Not all companies are nimble enough to switch production so quickly.
Because they were going to be working on luxury/mid-luxury cars. If they really start working on this I'm sure they would let them open back.

"By order of the Alameda Sheriff department. Elon Musk wanted to continue to produce cars, bad idea. But I'm glad he's doing good by making ventilators because of Trump's inactions we're going to need a lot more ventilators, masks, and other PPE."
"!Remindme 60 days 

is this vaporware?"
"People are really not appreciating the pun here, but I see what you did."
"> He’s gotta improve his reputation after trying to keep the factory open.

I dunno, I'm mixed on that one.  On the one hand, yeah, it's a pandemic.  On the other we have another global emergency with carbon emissions and global warming.  I can definitely see a reasoned case that could be made for keeping the factory open as long as possible."
Only if it turns out to be good or useful. I have many doubts.
"if he had done this 3 months ago, yes"
Just a normal game of chess for Elon.
"I don't get it. How is that a smart move, can you please explain.

Edit : I mean the factory being declared a critical infrastructure"
"More like checkers...

Here's a really good post about that:

https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/fml0b9/coronavirus_is_now_moving_so_rapidly_that_every/"
No. Just the right thing to do.
"First of all, NYC isn't buying as there is nothing to buy yet. Also, lets hope its not another ""Thailand submarine"" PR stunt...."
"Doctor: What is ""ventalator fart mode""?"
"And they all come with free malicious comments from Elon about your romantic interests. 

I’m joking y’all"
I presume it’s more about keeping the workers employed/working while the car-making side is shut down.
He offered before the closing.  It is no different than when he offered water fountains with filters for flint or made a sub to save kids in the event the cave reflooded before they got out.  Elon does real charity.
To be fair without Amazon social distancing would be a lot harder. They are also prioritizing stocking only essential goods in their warehouses. The fast food one I tend to agree with you on.
"I mean, that would be the common sense move from a ""involve as few people as possible to suppress contact"" logistics perspective."
No production there either. Maybe Reno?
"I doubt it.  Elon has the ability to help in this crisis, *and* a way to keep his employees working/getting paid, *and* a way to bring in new revenue for Tesla and SpaceX so why not?"
"I think he's genuinely going to do it, and I don't think he was trying to game the system on keeping that factory open -- even if he ends up making it in that factory.

The headline of an article I didn't read seemed to indicate that there are different lists of ""critical infrastructure"" at different levels of government, from county thru national.  Hence the differences of opinions.

Best bet is that they'll license an existing approved product design, and get the CNC data to start pumping them out.  He's got considerable precision fab capacity in various areas, some talented staff, and considerable resources and resolve.  He'll do fine. Designing a new toy and getting appropriate approvals for healthcare use would take way too long."
"V2G doesn't really work, when you think about the actual logistics. You want your home battery to be charging off your home solar while you're at work, because that's when the sunlight is best. But your car *isn't at home* when you're at work."
I mean now his factories can resume operations and manufacturer goods. Kind of a big deal?
You're right... the uptick probably didn't cause NY to buy ventilators from Tesla.
"But sometimes, it is."
It's very unlikely that this news wouldn't benefit their stock price.
He didn’t say it was

"Uh.... this is the US Stock market, not a middle school stats experiment survey.  Words and articles do tend to cause movements here."
Why does every unaccomplished NEET love to parrot this?
They just went down after hours because they closed more factories.
Wait till Monday. It’ll go back down.
Wake me up before You Go-Go
License a design from chinese ventilator manufacturer. They probably do not care about monopolizing production just on having a cut on every ventilator sold. Tesla can even buy the critical parts airlift them to fremont and assemble them in the car factory.
"You drastically underestimate how much Tesla and SpaceX do in house. They are both vertically integrated behemoths. I bet they could spin this up pretty quickly, they have vast amounts of manufacturing experience between the two companies but I’m sure they will also look to other manufacturers as well.

I’m sure they could somehow expedite the certification process and get it to market.

The alternative is we all run out of ventilators and they start sending people with the least chance to survive home to die just like they’re doing in Italy rn. Idk about you but I’d for sure take the Tesla/spacex experimental vent if that was the alternative."
"Who knows, they used to build entire new tank lines during WW2 after a week or 2 setting up a new factory."
"They may get an existing design, but I could see the patent owners getting sticky. Another way, which is I think more likely, is a total redesign, from first principles. Such a thing would never be allowed in normal circumstances, but if they can produce a workable design, *by the thousands*, for a much more economical price, they can get approval by edict, or even have the hospitals say ""fuck it, if we don't use them they'll die anyway""

Too complex you say? The modern ones in use at the moment, that cost $25,000 to $50,000 each, that the hospitals are doubting they can afford anyway, yes they're too complicated. But there must have been simpler versions before, take that design, polish it up with modern manufacturing techniques, and pump them out. You might have a problem manufacturing mass quantities of a modern minigun, but you can pump out 10s of thousands of sten guns pretty dam quick.

It sounds unlikely, but NY state looks like it might need 18,000 *alone*. That's half a billion dollars for one state from current manufacturers.

Edit: found another source that says they cost $5,000-$30,000. Also says there is a stockpile for emergencies, but another problem is trained staff. This is another reason they may go for a simpler design.

I don't say this is how it will happen, but I know SpaceX and Tesla engineers are some of the best and fastest out there."
"It's gotta be licensed. There's so way they could submit all the required paperwork. Or he just bought a design from some mom and pop and named it Tesla Vent. 
As a medical device engineer these articles intrigue and terrify me."
"Welp there you go, literally the NYC mayor"
Don't need any more evidence than that.
Is this inception
"its really SpaceX that'll do the bulk of the work. They make life support systems, so they will have a lot of expertise and manufacturing for vents."
Technically a Model S/X qualified as a (very mild) hyperbaric chamber. A ventilator is just a hyperbaric chamber but strapped to your mouth and nose.
☝🏻 this. The ethical way forward is fart smells.
With Tesla and air transfer systems the smell comes either way.
No no.  That would take some extra effort.  They just say Ahoy-hoy upon start up
"I guess, but in cases like this there is zero context anyway. It sounds like the communication may not actually be happening other than the tweets."
"Thanks for the correction. I agree, that is one of the reasons that Musk getting into this excites me more than say GM. Their tendency to constantly tinker with things means that I practically *expect* to see some innovation come out of this and while I think that at least initially they will probably be pretty cookie-cutter; the longer this goes the more actual engineering will get put into these sorts of things. The Block 5 Plaid ventilator will be quite impressive I am sure..."
"For the most part, it's not the companies that are involved, but the regulatory hurdles for medical equipment.

Sergey Brin has outright stated that regulatory hurdles were making Google's life sciences efforts difficult compared to most of their other businesses.

Let's just say that tech companies trying to streamline the process haven't always had a positive impact.  One word:  Theranos"
Would be nice but aren’t we talking about timeframes in days where this would take months?
"those companies making medical devices does sound exciting for the large caps. your medical terminologies make me even more worried tho about contamination during production. no experience in supplying these inputs to the final product, weeding out bad suppliers, keeping a sanitary environment for mass production of a small device, all it would take is one small batch of contaminated  ventilators for a hefty lawsuit. also reiterating o. the supply chain for inputs into final product, one person with big influence could undermine one of the components in a sinister way. they need to be keeping track of exactly where the parts are being sourced from and exactly who gave to trace any possible contamination"
"I would expect him to deliver a less costly product because of massive vertical integration

"> He doesn't want to do this.

Why do you think this?"
"They already did, and NYC mayor is buying all of them and is going to save thousands of lives because of it"
I'm referring the tweet where he said a scientific model has a 0% of occuring.
He very clearly and intentionally made it seem like the measures being taken by the government is panicking.
"Well I am certain some long-time shorts are still not in the money - they need it to go down more >420$

Not even a Global Pandemic/Recession could get them out of their losing positions....  no tears lost..."
Buy the parts in China assemble them in Fremont.
"You way overestimate the complexity of ventilators (seriously, they push oxygen into the lungs and pull CO2 out, it's not rocket surgery) while also way underestimating the engineering talent at Tesla and SpaceX."
That makes way more sense to me. These seem like they'd be sophisticated pieces of equipment with designs for software and parts that would take a long time to produce. How do you tool a car company to make medical-grade anything!?
I'd guess so too but still there must be some laws and rules at play here? Which?
"That's nice for you and all. But that doesn't answer the question at all.

What laws are at play for medical devices in a situation like that?"
He only said panic is dumb. didn't minimize the crisis. Obviously if you panic you will never make the right decision to extricate from the crisis which induced the said panic.
He’s still denying it
"I don't think he's a good person.  Read what his ex has to say about him.

And he has hair plugs"
"I'm not demonizing. I'm pointing out this was necessary weeks ago, when he was saying that people were ""panicking"" while tens of thousands of people in China needed ventilators. Now the rest of the world is in the same situation."
I wonder if spacex has something.
Elon denied what experts were saying about how much it’ll spread
"So we're going to print devices, which is significantly slower than stamping and molding. I've got to say, 3D printing isn't the answer to everything, it's the answer to extremely complex manufacturing operations. This isn't that. This is a question of vast output."
"None of this is new, this machine is just an optimisation of an existing technology, delcam have had Additive/reductive machines for some time now for building turbine blades and high complexity parts. That is a 5axis metal deposition 3D printer, and a 5 axis CNC all in one to put material down and finish in one machine. 

Yes this is sintering but also has been around for a long time. What I am getting at is that I would put a very substantial amount of money on the fact that Telsa absolutely have something like this in house but that it is exclusively for design development and not production and is probably larger than a desktop printer but smaller than this one. This would suit a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) but not a highly specialised production line like a car manufacturer. They won't produce parts like this in house but rather source from an OEM and assemble in house. 

SpaceX may have something like this also as they are far more likely to need one off parts with complex geometry but again maybe not for production parts as they may also source these from and OEM. 

What I think is more likely is that Tesla/SpaceX will leverage their OEM network to retool for ventilator production. You can get an Aluminium tool struck in 24hrs and get an injection mould line set up over night so within 48hrs you can get full plastic part production ramp up. That's a single part mind you; though their network is significant enough that they could get a full ventilator produced in no time at all if they put enough resources into to get enough suppliers together to produce the full assembly."
"He said that COVID-19 is a form of the common cold. He compared the number of deaths from C19 to the number of deaths from car accidents (in Italy, orders of magnitude are dying from C19 per day). And thousands of dummies on reddit have been suggesting chloroquine month ago (and other treatments that are currently in a trial)."
"Such silly panic, right? https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6

You're also missing all of the tweets after the ""hur dur panic dum"" tweet, in which he talks about why he doesn't trust medical advice, and suggested everyone take it with a serious grain of salt because he once had a bad experience.

At the same time he was tweeting that utter bullshit, literally tens of thousands of hospital beds were being filled with the severely ill in China. thousands of whom would go on to die of ARDS. So. Top points to Elon for meming like a sir while a pandemic took hold, and nations warned that they could not possible meet the demand for ICU care.

I would have preferred he didn't spread bullshit for weeks while the world burned, and only then, when left with no other possible route than to accept he was wrong, ask if he could start making supplies. I'll be very curious to see whether or not he can achieve FDA certification in the next week, let alone if he can produce enough equipment to make a dent in global demand."
"You should read more of his twitter timeline. Make sure you select ""tweets & replies"" so you can really get a sense of what he's been saying for the past couple weeks. It's you that needs to look at exactly what he's actually saying."
"Yeah, for example he said that C-19 is a form of the common cold, which is pretty dumb."
"Between this and the Thailand cave incident it's clear that Elon's propensity to over-share his thoughts on Twitter is harmful, and he doesn't always think things through. I am a huge Tesla and SpaceX fan but I don't waste my time defending him personally anymore. I wish he would just stick to running his companies."
He had that w/ Doug Field...
"Sinking all you earn into expanding your business is not the same as ""running out of money""."
"You're not wrong, not sure why you're being downvoted. It sucks that Tesla was finally headed toward consistent profitability before this virus knocked the world on its ass"
I think it’s as simple as there being a clear distinction between panic and sensible action. Nothing more. But there are a lot of haters who love to latch on to every tweet.
That's not in any way comparable. Though his self assumed expertise is probably a cautionary tale.
The presumption when he said he'd discuss specific needs in the context of ventilators is that he's talking about making ventilators. Especially when he said that Tesla and SpaceX make filter and life support systems.
"Elon: We're likely overreacting still. 55 minutes ago. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1240707187229380608

Elon: Will make ventilators if there's a shortage. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1240486275892662273

There had been a shortage already for over 2 months.

Elon: True. Regarding ""something strange with the numbers"" from the biggest tech douchebag I've ever met in my life. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1240500318770610176

Elon: Only sick people die. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1240485383185416193

No big deal, then, right?

Elon: Exactly. About the population no really being at risk, because a cruise ship was a worst case, and, like, it's just not that bad here. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1240118317228179456

Elon: Danger of panic far exceeds danger of corona. Note. Nobody has died from panic. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1239756900255903744

Elon: I take expert advice with a grain of salt. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1239667765637758983

Yeah. So, there you go. Elon doesn't believe experts, he's in complete agreement with valley blowhards, but now all of a sudden he can't keep saying there's no increased need for medical equipment we don't have."
"Read the last week of tweets. He's dismissing the impact and potential serious consequences, and you're pretending he's not. Context matters here."
"Remember, he makes more than rockets and cars. Those rockets also have capsules with life support. Most important, he's been making spacesuits.

I expect its the space suit expertise that's most applicable to making ventilators."
"Corona virus panic is still dumb. 
Panic is never a good thing."
I like how you're being downvoted when posting they literal numbers of fatalities in Italy. Absolute delusion in here at times.
"This post is incredibly stupid.

Italy has one of the lowest fatality rated for automobiles in the world and literally the highest fatality rate for COVID-19 (and they just surpassed fucking China in total fatalities I believe), so you are heavily picking your statistics to make it far worse than it actually is. The US literally had over 39k auto related fatalities in 2018 compared to Italy's 3k, and China which is where this disease started has 250k+ auto related fatalities in 2018... and less dead to to COVID-19 than Italy."
they’re buying doesn’t guarantee Tesla is selling.
"Plus, remember when he tried to help with that soccer team in Thailand?"
"These are vastly different motors. Ventilators use small motors which receive power from the wall to create ajrflow. EVs use bigbmotirs that get battery power to create 300+ horsepower. To say they are anything alike is ridiculous; the only thing they have in common is the fact that they are motors. Which is like saying ""they both have metal, so they are the same"".

They are far better off contacting a powertool maker, as they at least use motors of roughly similar size, as well as the plastic and metal molding techniques that the device needs."
It’s not a panic. It’s preventative measure. Don’t confuse preparedness with panic.
"Yeah, I've read everything that he's put on Twitter. I've disagreed with much of it and his choice to post it, but its just an opinion. It is amazing how much about it has been exaggerated."
"That's true, I feel bad for them."
"If they do anything, I imagine it will be producing piece parts.  Not too hard to spin up, and they can be the supplier to the regular manufacturers who are not able to get shipments of parts from China."
"[It is, however, larger than the existing Gigafactories.](https://i.redd.it/e5luii2kvhx21.jpg)"
4D Chess should be renamed Elon Chess
Critical infrastructure gets to stay open despite lockdowns
"The factory has a high amount of fixed costs. Even if they make ventilators the factory is generating revenue and isn't idle. The ventilators aren't going to be free, either the Fed gov, the state gov, or hospitals will be paying for them."
The idea being if the factory is declared critical infrastructure then Tesla can continue producing cars. Currently they are operating at 25% based on bay area shelter in place guidance. Tesla wants to keep making cars - so they might be able to change the game by making the factory “critical” if it can also produce ventilators.

"Are fast food joints allowed to stay open in CA for dine-in?

NYS has been takeout/delivery only since Monday at 8 PM.

My company did get declared an essential business by NYS (forklifts are needed to run the warehouses that enable social distancing), but they targeted compliance with Wednesday's 50% WFH order and just announced we'll be shutting down Monday for at least a week."
"The point is there is no real logic to these shutdowns.

What we are missing is protocols for workers who are working.  Such as wear a mask, wear gloves that you change every half hour or wash hands every half hour, take temperatures, etc.  Obviously it should include daily testing for the virus, but our government dropped the ball on that.

Masks for a workforce wouldn't be that hard because you would give people reusable cloth ones (same as a surgical mask) that they wash and reuse.  In fact, they could swap them every hour.  People are too obsessed with disposible masks, reusable ones solve a lot of problems.  You only need n95 when directly caring for the sick, surgical type masks cut down on water droplets leaving your mouth and floating around in the air.

I feel like if we all went into full asian pandemic mode and used masks and gloves, we wouldn't have to shut everything down.  Hell, it is crazy that those staying open are not following any kind of protocol to reduce the risk of transmission.

We are skipping over the basic step of masks and gloves and just shutting things down instead which destroys our economy for no reason."
"Possible, but if Tesla says they have a ventilator design that could be built at Giga NY on their existing machines, I guarantee the governor would get them an exemption within the hour."

It was probably because of new stock ratings that came out at the same time.
"News = stock fluctuations.  

Which is why bad news (corona) made the entire stock market crash.  Even things like Netflix... which should go up because everyone is at home watching  netflix."
Please Elon don’t tweet anything good over the weekend 🤞
Yes gotta be something like this.  Need a Qualcomm generic smartphone design equivalent.
"Sure, this is a great idea given the alternative.  I'm just skeptical they can generate a large enough number of quality products in a timeframe to make a big impact (say 1-3 months?).

The efficacy of this will depend heavily on what the curve of cases looks like in relation to the ability to get something designed, tooled, QA'd, approved, tested, and then distributed.

I guess I don't know why it's a better idea for Tesla to do this vs. increasing the capacity/output of existing ventilator manufacturers, though of course I don't know their constraints.  Why not do both I guess."
Equipment takes a long time to design and build. Only quick way to do this is take someone else’s equipment and put people on it.
"Ventilators are a simple concept but actually very difficult to engineer and make, just like most medical devices. These things have to operate 24/7 and the software is absolutely critical as it interfaces with sensors to monitor things like air pressure and oxygen levels. The advantage that Elon has is they can use a HW3 computer which has logic and power redundancy alongside SpaceX engineers who make aviation grade software, but that can take weeks to engineer.

Tesla is better off licensing off an existing design. That will save many lives, but depends on if they can obtain them."
"Only on Reddit is ""we will connect with your team to understand potential needs"" evidence enough of a purchase agreement."

"Oh I know, just thought it would be a great chance for companies to experiment as regulatory restrictions will probably be fast tracked due to crisis."
"Oh lord, i am soooooo glad Theranos flew under my radar or else I would have definitely invested."
"Well there is a DIY project going on. It depends if you simplify it or not I guess. A regular one is a big self contained machine. But all you really need is a pump and a tube to push oxygen into the lungs. So you could probably lower your standards a little and make a lot of them.

"Yeah it’s just a pipe dream in my part, would just be hella cool."
"He tweeted he's making ventilators now which is great. He should be lauded for that.

But he can't help himself by continuing to make claims that young people are not affected. I just watched the news, nearly 40% of people hospitalized due to this virus are younger than 54. Kids as young as 6 y/o are positive, and a 34 y/o just died from it.

Statistically, he might not be all that wrong. But you can't tell young kids that they are ""essentially, immune"" and expect them to abide by orders of staying in their homes."
"When did they? At this point it sounds like they don't even have a design, let alone any tooling to make anything."
"Excellent, good to hear. Any information on how they're going to build the devices? Are they getting plans, parts and dies from someone else?"
"Yes, that model was the worst case scenario. You should be happy that it’s not happening, not complaining that a Elon said it wouldn’t."
Please link me to a single time a scientific model estimating a pandemic ever was right

"A lot of people are saying ""panic is dumb"", but there are multiple interpretations of that statement. A lot of people are interpreting that to mean that there is no (or very little) danger, and they don't have to take precautions or do anything differently. It is a funny phrase.

Of course I've said that too. But I wouldn't say Italy shouldn't shut down, for example."
He did minimize it. Musk said the estimates of deaths weren’t true
"Yeah it's hard to conclusively infer what he meant - he could have been characterising the precautions and warnings at that time as ""panic"" if he thought they were unfounded or he could have been referring to panic because people were doing that too.. doesn't sound like the worst idea , some of that stockpiling depending of course on reasonable scale. Time will tell"
"He has been minimizing the crisis though. He said that you shouldn't worry because car crash related deaths are more common. He also said that it was less deadly than the common flu. ""Maybe worth considering chloroquine for C19 "" like they haven't thought of that.

And he clearly doesn't care about it at all. If it was up to him the factories would be going full speed."
"What could you have done better than him?

SpaceX definitely has 3D metal printing. Tour attendees have confirmed this.
"The Design Center is inside SpaceX HQ... They can just talk to each other.

SpaceX == Life Support Systems expertise

Tesla == Production and Manufacturing expertise (Innovative HVAC)

EDIT: I am 100% certain they are meeting now."
"They make spacesuits. I expect there's a lot of overlap between spacesuit life support and ventilators. 

Scaling up to mass production with medical grade cleaness might be an issue."
Probably quicker to ramp up initially also when peoples lives are on the line optimizing costs becomes a less important factor.
"3D printers can be useful for rapidly producing test parts and molds/castings to get mass-production underway much more rapidly, and allow more rapid iteration/changes if there are design issues.

As you point out, people might be mistaken in seeing printers as some standalone silver bullet as depicted in IronMan, but 3D printers are still valuable for fast response at scale."
"How many pieces could they 3d print in the time it would take to build out a proper stamping / molding setup? While printing is slow, it has a significantly faster ramp-up time."
"Why does everything have to be so fucking binary with you, dude? 

Yes, his tweets were dumb. Yes, the virus is an incredible threat (I've spent the last month trying to convince my friends that it is in fact worse than the flu - to no avail). 

However, panic buying everything from toilet paper to cheezits is only making the crisis worse. People are seemingly incapable of nuance these days and your comments are a fantastic reflection of society as a whole"
"I have read every single one lately....

He never claimed it wasn’t a real problem. If he did then post the link to the tweet."
Well technically....
You always have the option of not defending him. He is more than capable of that on his own - where it matters to him.
"that’s not what I am saying. Read his biography, it is clearly laid in there and it has happened again since the book was released"

"It sucks even more than tens of thousands of people are already dead, and tens if not hundreds of thousands may be following. Not to mention the hundreds of thousands that will have permanent disabilities."
"I'm hearing more and more about the Darwin effect. Is it ok, or not ok, to accept 20 - 50 thousand deaths per year??"
"I mean what about any of what he tweeted is false though? The primary people dying from this ARE elderly and people already sick (immunocompromised or respiratory problems). It's not like theres a bunch of kids and healthy people dying from this. That is a fact. That doesn't mean the disease isn't real. It just means people not at risk shouldn't be panicking as much as they are. And in fact all you have to do is check your local grocery store to see how big of a problem this panic has caused.

And it's not like putting EVERYONE on quarantine for a month (or longer?) is absolutely necessary. For instance if EVERYONE was being tested and only people most at risk were quarantined we literally would not need to be shutting these factories down, or at least not for very long...Secondly if that were the case (us testing more) we'd have much better statistics. It is basically a guarantee that the number of people infected is way under-reported especially for people that are otherwise healthy/not elderly. However, the death statistics are likely pretty accurate. That means the death rate is almost certainly lower than is reported and that the elderly and people already sick are really the only people that need to worry....Which brings us back to why we're all getting the shelter in place order - to protect the most at risk. Well if we did more testing, I'd argue that would be far more effective way of protecting them even with keeping these factories/stores open. We simply aren't doing enough testing, so this is how our government thinks is best to protect the most at risk. Intrinsically there isn't really a problem with keeping the factory operational if you know the employees are not sick and you are quarantining those who are."
"There's a pretty big difference between a life support system in a suit, versus an FDA approved ventilator. Over-pressurizing the lungs, even slightly, can cause severe permanent damage without killing the patient. Failure of a ventilator while a patient is intubated will kill them."
Same story with the submarine.  I hope he can do it but he really seems to jump onto every crisis for PR.
"Where do you see panic? There are people out at the beach for spring break here in the US. You know where you see panic? China. Italy. Iran. The death toll in Italy right now it taking off almost vertically. Same in Iran. Why? Because jackasses said don't panic, the virus spread like wildfire, and now there are tens of thousands of people that need serious, long term medical care that there isn't capacity to provide. People tend to panic when their loved ones are all in hospital, unable to receive care, and given less than 50/50 odds of surviving.

Meanwhile, he ignored the fact that basically every governor of every US state was raising warnings saying their hospitals didn't have the facilities to care for massive numbers or ARDS cases, or bacterial infections that rapidly cause multiple organ failure. There are many states in the US that flat out don't even have enough square footage in a sterile environment to care for these people. So instead of tweeting dumb shit, why not talk to actual experts about the actual problems they face? Why not reach out to governors directly instead of waiting for Twitter randoms to convince you?"
Obv. but at that point he was only talking about market reaction which was actually very slow to react relative to the implications of this thing. Most grocery stores and stuff hadn't been hit by panic yet other than hotzones like Washington.
"You don't think it is picking statistics to compare annual car crash rates to our COVID-19 rates at the outset of a pandemic?  If our deaths don't exceed our car crash deaths it will be because of the actions we took that Musk tried to fight through twitter and through opening his factory.

50% of our cases are in around 3 counties, and Musk wanted to keep making luxury/mid-luxury sedans in one of them."
"> It’s not a panic.

Explain the TP situation rationally then."
"I'm not sure you're correct. According to a recent [recent study](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/wuhan-coronavirus-deaths.html), the death rate among those showing symptoms is only 1.4%, and at least 80% of people that get it display no symptoms.

So we're looking at an overall death rate of somewhere south of 0.3%. Seasonal flu kills approximately 0.1% of suffers, many of which are children and elderly people. Some years the seasonal strain is significantly worse.

(Covid-19 has little effect on children, with almost all of them ending up as asymptomatic carriers. Instead it strikes people with poor lung function, mostly the elderly, asthma sufferers, and smokers. I have damaged lungs, so I'm at risk. Most people aren't.)

So we've turned the entire world on its head... for something equivalent to a once-in-a-decade worse than normal (but not Spanish Flu bad) seasonal flu.

So yes, it is a panic. And while some reaction isn't completely unjustified, the extent of the panic (buying up multi-year supplies of toilet paper and hand sanitizer FFS) isn't justified. Closing restaurants and stadiums? Not unreasonable to slightly slow the spread to prevent healthcare overload. Recommending social distancing? Definitely. Shutting down the whole global supply chain and laying off everyone in the world? That's just stupid.

The good thing about this is that it might finally force someone to finish, test, and bring to market a cornovirus vaccine."
"When the entire world is dealing with a pandemic, it’s not a very good time to give an “opinion”"
At least they are saving lives
"Maybe, but I've also read that legit ventilator manufacturers say they can increase production multi-fold but haven't received any orders yet.

I firmly believe Elon was mainly challenging the assumption that things are as dire as many portray. He continuously says that he can help ""if needed""."
I thought Chutes and Ladders was Elon Chess
Elon is a Vulcan who got cosmetic otoplasty.
"But we shouldn't be looking for loopholes like this.  Car manufacture isn't critical infrastructure.  The lockdowns are for public and worker safety, not just because arbitrarily deciding cars can't be made.

Making ventilators is obviously in the public interest and in all likelihood, is more beneficial than the risk of keeping a factory open. But that doesn't make producing cars at the same time worthwhile."
Ohh that makes sense. That thought never even crossed my mind. Guess he really is playing 4D Chess.
[deleted]
you only need to make as many cars as people can buy. the number of people who can buy teslas is probably lower this week than it was last week.
Maybe they can make self-driving ventilators
"or they can just get their employees back to work. this keeps them paid, keeps their family in a reasonable space and ensures they're helping get us out of the crises instead of idling. 

these all sound like good enough reasons regardless of making cars"
This is gross. We’re in a national emergency and you’re concerned about the car output? Shouldn’t you be more concerned with ventilator output?

Why own a car at all if you're going to take public transport/robotaxis to work/errands every day?

Except on the flip side when money is tight for people they will start to cancel monthly subs. I think Netflix would be pretty far down that list for most people though...
"You have it backwards. People who are subscribed to Netflix will not pay more just because they stay home and watch more. What will happen is that Netflix costs will go up becasue they now have to show and serve more content, meaning their server costs goes up. So Netflix should actually go down because of this."
You were suppose to WORK from home. Not Netflix from home.
Wait do you not think that SpaceX already has similar equipment for Crew Dragon?
"Elon is not one to give into sunk cost fallacy. I’m sure they will look at this from every angle possible and if one way isn’t working they’ll very quickly switch to the next.

I’m guessing they will be able to reuse a lot of the life support system from spaceX (these machines are already heavily certified to keep humans alive in space) and maybe modifying them to work as a vent.

Whatever the option is that results in the net increase of vents as quickly as possible, they will do. And you’re probably right it might be a mix of both."

The company makes their own processes and just puts it on paper claiming every worker follows the same process.  There are no real quality standards beyond the potential lawsuits if you screw up.

Musk is no doubt going to expand an existing production line for an existing company by making key parts.  It will just be part fabrication."

Company: ""Cool, tell us what you need and we'll look into it.""

Buyer: ""Thanks, here are my specs. I need 10 of these next week.""

Company (a week or two later): ""No can do, we can get you 5 in two weeks and 5 the week after. Also, we can't meet some of these requirements you specified. Here's what we can do.""

Buyer: ""Yikes, okay. Well, we can work with the schedule, but what does it take to do actually hit these requirements.""

Company: ""Well, we can do that, but it'll take a little more time.""

Buyer: ""Fine, how much will all this cost?""

Company: ""Lots of money. Pay us within 90 days of us delivering.""

Buyer: ""Okay okay. Make them for us. We agree to buy them.""

*6-8 weeks later*

Company: ""Okay, we made them and shipped them. Money please?"""

"Which is not actually part of the ventilator. 

They come separately."
It would be but none of these guys will do this out of the goodness of their hearts (with some exceptions). Government would have to pay them somehow.

Anyone with a 3D printer can print ventilators with the proper blue print I suspect one will be released by Tesla or someone and Tesla already built a type of ventilators for their cars so they just had to tweak them a bit for human wear
No there are machines that mold and compress the material into the shape of an airway and you stick that in people’s throat and they will always have an airway it’s seems like a big deal because it is and Tesla is making them with the same machines that he uses for the ventilators in his cars. Extremely genius move because no other car maker has the ability to do that. Tesla has a bio hazard mode on their vehicles and they’re basically retro fitting the car ventilators for human use
That 0% of occurring is if we do nothing... we aren't doing nothing therefore... it's not tracking.
You can infer this from his feelings about the situation lol.
"If the machine doesn't exist, the patient also dies."
"SpaceX literally makes goddamn rockets that land themselves successfully hundreds of times. The tech both Tesla and SpaceX build is much more complex and much more expensive than any ventilator ever made, and in all probability they'll simply be manufacturing an existing, proven ventilator design which takes much of the risk of failure out of the equation. They can handle complexity and reliability just fine."
Stop this nonsense. We have had ventilators for 80 years. Somehow we could make them in a emergency during the polio epidemic. You don't need state of the art technology that can do every kind of thing on the planet. You need something that works.
"You're a moron. Just because a ventilator seems sophisticated to you doesn't mean it's sophisticated for companies that build rockets that literally land themselves and cars that use battery tech that even the largest automakers with hundreds of billions of dollars can't replicate. Tesla and SpaceX can make ventilators just fine, and all the unqualified skepticism from clowns like you does more harm than good in the effort to get more supplies like this procured at this critical time before the full weight of the pandemic takes effect on the US."
Can you point me to the tweet where he said estimates of death werent true. I may have missed it. If he did say that then it would be wrong.

"It's not quicker to ramp up 3D printers. Those things also need to be manufactured. It's not like there's just 3D printers that can make medical grade parts hanging out everywhere, and it's not like the supply chain to produce them is in better shape than the supply chain to produce ventilators or even the manufacturing lines to produce ventilators."
"Exactly this! They're fantastic at producing extremely complex parts, rapid prototyping, and small batch production of unique parts where investing in tooling and dies would be more expensive than the entire production run.

But 3D printers aren't some magical solution to every manufacturing problem."
Just 3d print the stamping/molding machine.
"From what you are saying it sounds like they should be combining the technologies? 3d Print the molds utilized in the stamping process?

Not sure if the 3d printer materials would be capable of the pressures that stamping out parts would require though."
"How long does it take to order, manufacture, deliver, and configure a 3D metal printer?"
"Very few things in the world are binary to me. That's how I can think Tesla makes great cars, but needs to improve them. And how I can think Elon has done a great job stewarding Tesla to where they are, but needs to vastly improve himself. And how I can think he's a very smart person that says and does dumb shit just like the rest of us.

>However, panic buying everything from toilet paper to cheezits is only making the crisis worse.

He said panic was dangerous, you're worried about sore butts and high cholesterol. Those are different concerns to what he's been tweeting about.

>People are seemingly incapable of nuance these days and your comments are a fantastic reflection of society as a whole

You should read my actual comments about covid, I think you'll find I'm completely reasonable and capable of listening to information that actual experts give me. If you think buying up paper products is endangering the world, then my friend, never _ever_ take the red pill when it's offered.

Where I live, we get blizzards and hurricanes. Nearly every year we get a severe storm warning. We've gone weeks without electricity because of these storms in the past, so every single year we're warned at least twice to prepare for being physically incapable of getting out of our houses. You know what people do? They buy toilet paper and bread. Every time. Twice a year. Like clockwork. This isn't ""panic"" behavior, this is the behavior of people that have no idea what's necessary to shelter in place for two weeks.

Panic, on the other hand, is what mass casualty and mass triage look like. Panic is what will happen if this pandemic is allowed to get to a point where hospital ICUs are overrun and doctors need to decide not to treat someone's parents hundreds of times a day. That's what we're seeing in Italy and Iran right now. So the government made the choice to ask people, not even demand but just ask, to not gather in crowds, not congregate in places where disease can take hold, and to be prepared to do so for two weeks. To criticize such a simple, and completely voluntary request, and to call the reaction to doing so ""panic"" shows how disconnected from daily reality Elon is. Which is fine. He's a billionaire, and his problems aren't the same as ours. But to listen to his tweet as though it's in any way meaningful, and then heap praise on him when he's finally convinced that maybe people might die if they can't get help? That's nonsense to me."
"Wow, an ad hominem, a straw man, and an invitation to comment on society as a whole."

"> Who'd have thought artificially inflating things via stock buy backs would be not so good?

Would you be complaining if they were ""artificially"" inflating things by spending the same amount of money on dividends?  

Stock buy-backs are just a way to return cash to taxpayers.  They're for the most part equivalent to dividends, but they're more tax-efficient.  

IMO stock prices are going up because there is just a LOT of money looking for investment opportunities and the global economy is only so large, so prices go up.  They dropped due to panic, and will probably go up again eventually.

But, this is more of an investing/etc discussion.

Personally I think stock buybacks are fine.  I think there are definitely issues around monetary policy and so on that need fixing, but buybacks should be encouraged - they are not a problem.  If anything I'd ban dividends.  For some reason people think that the one is bad and the other is great, but they're basically the same thing with the exception of being taxed differently."
Duh
"Is that 20-50 thousand additional deaths? And are they from preventable causes? I'm not really fond of people using Darwin to support the idea that those unable to protect themselves (due to ignorance or otherwise) are an acceptable and good loss for society. We've seen eugenics a few times, and it's not a good look."
This is an unbelievably simplistic view of how the world works.
"We'll have to see. He also has a reputation for getting stuff done quickly, if messily."
Or because he thinks his team can help.
"No I don't. And if I/you/the majority of Reddit/this sub were living in Italy I think the stats you provided would be valid. But that's simply not the case, now is it...

I think it's perfectly fine to compare deaths caused by this to auto deaths, because we accept those without anything close to this type of panic/fear. 

But you're clearly misleading on purpose. And if you point is what can happen in a worst case scenario, you may have a point. But lets not act like whats happening in Italy is what is going to happen here."
"I think your numbers are a bit low...but your point is valid.

10k ish cases and 154 deaths.   Because of lack of tests there is a good chance that 10k is quite a bit higher.  Though death rates will increase when hospitals fill up and can’t keep people alive which will happen soon.

However to your point how many more people will die being unemployed or losing life savings/retirement from suicide, drugs, gangs, starvation.   How many people will need to stay in the labor market longer if there is a depression and keep jobs away from younger gen.   How will this affect education and therefore overall societal health.   Not to mention if it gets really crazy how much hate and division will we see.   Some early cases had already been getting death threats.   There is just a lot of unmeasurable or butterfly affects that could be cost a lot more lives/pain than letting this run more of its course.  The people it targets are people that in nature would have already died long ago for not society enabling/protecting.  Old, sick, obese."

"You’re correct. Car manufacture isn’t critical, but they won’t be making cars, they’ll be making ventilators. Same as tractor and car manufacturers switching to make rifles and jeeps during WWII. Tesla is set up to mass produce critical parts to ventilators as well since components will wear out quickly and effectively put the equipment out of commission."
"The factories can stay open and the employees can be paid. They will be making ventilators, which is critical infastructure. At least these people will get to keep their jobs and help America get through this crisis. 

Otherwise the workers either lose their jobs, are on extended furlough. Or Tesla is in the whole for thousands of employees time off. 

It's a good move. All factories should be interested."
It keeps people working and the world running
"And it keeps his employees paid. If and when the curfew drops, right back to business.

I would love to see some assurances that anyone risking their lives to make ventilators is assured full government healthcare financial support if they get sick."
"I love the car brand, no particular affection for any people from the company or not but it looked very weird when someone as intelligent as Musk was asking Nate Silver (pollster!) A day ago on Twitter about whether it would be helpful to make ventilators. I cannot buy that Musk would be weeks behind the narrative and the cynical side of me wants to shake the notion this is a strategic move after having car production hampered"
"But this is /r/teslamotors, where luxury electric vehicles with cobalt and lithium mined by children and poor people are paramount to everything, even human safety"
"If the same plant that makes the ventilators makes cars normally the plant can stay open. I don't know if they can legally still make cars-I think the law in question is local to California. But even if all they can do is make ventilators then those workers won't be laid off, the plant won't be shut down, and it could (probably) restart more quickly without having to retrain new people once cars can be made there again. And its possible that a quid-pro-quo will happen where Elon can make cars if he also makes ventilators. A kind of 'regulators look the other way' sort of deal. If things really go south the US WILL need ventilators, and lots of them. And we don't have manufacturers in place to make them right now."

Elon considered it critical infrastructure and has been claiming it's not a big deal and trying to make everyone go to work. His reply guys seem to have embarrassed him into doing this at least.
They also make replacement parts for cars with parts failures due that need replaced under warranty as well as replacement parts for collision repair.

Nope. I was just answering why Tesla might do this.

Why own a car when you're forced to work from home and all the stores are closed?
What do you mean? There was just an analyst that rated the stock at 420(?) and probably accounted for the virus?
"Closing factories mean no sales? How are the two coupled? That is only true if you sell from stock like most auto manufacturers do, but not Tesla.

Tesla sold me my Model S one year before it was produced. A delay of a few months in production wouldn't prevent them from selling additional cars, it might reduce sakes a small bid for to longer delays, but in the past there has been almost zero correlation between delivery delay and sales at Tesla.

Having a big stock only means you sell today what you weren't able to sell before. It's not a plus. A bigger is only good for smoothing deliveries, not for sales.

In fact, all other car manufacturers that depend on in person dealers for sales are screwed by the pandemic, but Tesla sells online and should see a much smaller sales bump only caused by economic factors and not by their factories closing for a few weeks."
"No, I'm just saying why the stock went up, it was like that the whole prior 900 time, for each new rating the stock went up fast. Exactly like this time.
It would be wierd for investors to buy at a higher price just because of the potential to sell ventilators, like that would probably not lead to any profits, right? (even if it's totally the right thing to do)"
Wouldn't it have value because of relative cost: entertainment ratio?

I seriously doubt it.  Not sure why a spacecraft would want to have a device that gets shoved down someone’s trachea and needs to operated based on arterial blood gas values.
"I think life support systems have a different meaning in space vs on Earth. Space life support systems facilitating breathing likely stop at oxygen generation. Earth life support systems facilitating breathing can go further, e.g. mechanical ventilators that breathe for you. The harsh reality is that, if you are in a situation where you require a mechanical ventilator, and you also happen to be in space, you’re probably going to die, even if they decided to a pack a ventilator (which I’m guessing is pretty unlikely)."

"It's a post on Twitter. All it shows is two men in high positions publicly demonstrating their (intention for) good deeds to the masses, mostly to generate good PR. Actual contracts are confirmed via phone calls and emails, not over fucking tweets."
Elon agreeing to sell something he actively produces vs saying he will connect to understand potential needs for a device they've never manufactured before.... you don't see how these are completely different scenarios?
"Which don't have pumps and do not function as a breathing machine. The CO2 scrubbing that happens in a spacecraft might be applicable, but that's about it and it isn't part of the spacesuit."
"Say tesla has 10k working ventilators. The FDA will absolutely fast-track them, if not now, in a month when they're desperate for more"
China probably has manufacturer willing to partner with Tesla. Tesla can then announce they have several thousand uncertified ventilator on stock and they are selling them if only regulation do not prevent them from doing so.
"that in a nutshell is why healthcare in the US is so expensive

it's also why COVID19 spread for as long as it did with no testing kits"
"If you're referring to a recent article that came out of Italy:

1)  It wasn't a complete ventilator, it was just a single disposable part (a valve)

2)  IIRC, it was printed with a resin DLP printer.  These are not common."
"I don't think you understand what a medical ventilator is.

I think you might be confusing a recent story about a couple of guys 3D printing cheap replaceable static **valves** for a CPAP as being indicative of how a ventilator can be made.

Ventilators are $25,000+ apiece medical equipment. They are extraordinarily complicated, full of sensors to carefully monitor and regulate oxygen transmission while ensuring they don't cause barotrauma themselves and ensure there's no airway collapse. 


To be frank, I don't think we have any shot in hell in notably increasing the production of modern ventilators. I think the only things we can mass produce quickly are archaic ""dumb"" versions like we had circa 1950s."

Interestingly, that's a very similar percentage to the number of people in that age group that smoke. Based on what we've seen in Italy, there is a very high overlap between smoking and dying from Covid-19.

Cigarettes kill:P. Clinched, but true."
I think saying not to panic is always good advice.
"> they won’t be making cars

I'm willing to bet money you're wrong. Sure, they won't be producing cars at 100% capacity, but they'll probably be making *some* cars."
"Yes and that's not a problem.  The issue is Tesla using it as a loophole to also keep the factory running for car production and just dedicating, say, 25% of the workforce to ventilators.  That kind of loophole-exploiting behaviour is not okay.  It has to be exclusively ventilator production (or other critical item) production.  I'm not saying Tesla will do that,  it remains to be seen,  I think they will be sensible here."
Saving lives is cool to.
"And more people alive. If there are not enough ventilators to sustain people who need them, people are going to die."

[deleted]
If Elon can make rocket ships that go to Mars I’m pretty sure he can produce a ventilator for humans. It’s literally not rocket science. I think the reason we have a shortage is because medical companies are all working together as monopolies and if one starts producing more ventilators there liable to get sued to shit. In Elon’s case he has the entire world watching him so if he gets sued by anybody they’ll look like the worst people on the planet and he already has a deal with NYC Mayor who has gone on television to confirm this that he will in fact be using Tesla ventilators to save thousands if not millions of lives. You can spin this story however you want but Tesla is a good company with good morals and what they’re doing right now should be followed by any other company that can do the same. Elon’s personal team is filled with the best brightest minds this country has to offer and they love Tesla and humanity just as much as Elon does.
Oh you know what I was talking about those Italian boys 3D printing some 700 dollar device and they’re being sued by the medical manufactures right now for saving people’s lives

"Why aren't factories just installing 3D printers instead of manufacturing lines, then?"
"Why is it that we still have manufacturing plants stamping out parts rather than just 3D printing everything? Why still have plastic roto and injection molding when 3D plastics printers are so common place they're in homes?

Scale. I can injection mold pieces 10,000x faster than you can print a single one. And when we need 10,000 of something for an order, it's not really a contest.

3D printing is best used for parts that are impossible or extremely difficult to machine."

"Not quite:  A limited subset of the viruses that cause common cold happen to be coronaviruses.  However, not many - the majority of viruses that cause the common cold are rhinoviruses, not coronaviruses.  Coronaviruses of all known strains only are responsible for 15% of common cold cases.

You're saying that this is a derivative of those viruses, but it's the other way around.

Also, genetically, it's much closer to the original SARS virus, to the point where it is no longer considered its own species, but a strain of that virus - [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z)

None of the four human coronaviruses considered to be causes of ""common cold"" share that distinction, and half of them aren't even betacoronaviruses.  The two that are - they're Lineage A, vs. Lineage B for the two SARS variants and C for MERS."
"Ok, and? Musk said that C-19 is a form of the common cold, which is false and dumb.

"That's not at all how SK has approached this. But I'll respond fully rather than just leave a glib comment.

> And it's not like putting EVERYONE on quarantine for a month (or longer?) is absolutely necessary.

Literally nobody is suggesting this.

>For instance if EVERYONE was being tested and only people most at risk were quarantined we literally would not need to be shutting these factories down

You don't seem to understand transmission for some reason. Let's say you test negative. Great. Now you go out into society and contract CoV-2. You still feel healthy, but you carry it home with you and pass it on to your kid. Your kid goes to school, interacts with another kid, who brings CoV-2 home to their diabetic parent, or elderly grandparent. Now that person needs hospitalization. If this repeats itself thousands of times, we end up with an epidemic that rapidly overruns our hospitals. China and Italy are perfect examples. The difference between the two is that Italy doesn't have the ability to build specialist hospitals in 10 days, where China did.

>Secondly if that were the case (us testing more) we'd have much better statistics.

We've got pretty good statistics based on other countries. Not perfect, but good enough to create a model for sure. We have specialists literally dedicated to this sort of thing- people that have spent their entire careers studying the math of outbreaks. I trust them over Elon.

>It is basically a guarantee that the number of people infected is way under-reported especially for people that are otherwise healthy/not elderly.

Yup. Which is counter to your claim here. If it's under-reported and more prevalent than assumed, that means _more_ people are at risk of suddenly developing ARDS. This is what ""flattening the curve"" is about. The assumption we have hidden cases and need to keep hospital capacity as high as possible for as long as possible.

>However, the death statistics are likely pretty accurate. That means the death rate is almost certainly lower than is reported and that the elderly and people already sick are really the only people that need to worry

Sick in this case means asthma, chest cold, diabetes, smokers, people with undiagnosed pulmonary issues, people with high blood pressure, people on several kinds of medications, etc. Over 10% of the US population is diabetic alone. So, saying ""it's only sick and old people"" is not only callous, but also misses the breadth of the group of people you're talking about. Hell, people over 65 make up 16% of the US population. Losing a major portion of that population impacts everyone younger than them- friends and relatives grieve.

>Which brings us back to why we're all getting the shelter in place order 

Not all of us. Just SF bay area.

>Well if we did more testing, I'd argue that would be far more effective way of protecting them even with keeping these factories/stores open.

Except people can contract CoV-2 after testing negative. So giving people false confidence in this case is a bad thing. Knowing you're not exposed and then quarantining is the way to prevent spiking the demand on hospitals. Again, contacts of contacts are the concern.

You don't seem to understand why there's a _voluntary_ quarantine in effect in the US. You can read up on it on the CDC site, though. They've got good details, and they've got staff that create response plans to this exact situation. They probably know more than us about controlling the rapid spread of disease, and the capacity our hospitals have for ARDS patients and patients experiencing organ failure due to bacterial infection."
"Again, you are assuming that his motivating factor was to get an instagram story, when there is a simpler explanation that fits the facts better."
"There are 3.7k auto deaths per day globally (which I literally said in my original comment). There, now we aren't comparing it to yearly rates.. see how simple that is. Yesterday there were 973 deaths to Coronavirus.

Now compare the panic that is going on everywhere. Quarantining the elderly and those who test positive is the best strategy. The reason we're basically just quarantining everyone  is because we aren't testing enough."
"I work in manufacturing, and it's something a lot of people don't understand.

It's really, really hard to stop production, and start it again. Your supply streams have inertia that's hard to start and stop. I don't have time to really get into it, but shutting down 100% for more than a day or two is DEVASTATING. That's why they really need to operate at a minimum 25%. It's to keep everything circulating."
Nobody said that just because he gets to keep the factory open that he'll use it as a 'loophole' to make cars.  What about the fact that he can keep a subset of employees who would otherwise be sitting at home gainfully employed while doing their part to aid in the CV-19 recovery process...
It seems like ventilators would be way more profitable than cars for the next six months anyway.
"That's really not a bad thing.

As long as the ventilators are built to the requisite standards and priced competitively it's just good business."
"Yes, I agree its to been seen, but i think looking for these loopholes is completely fine. Its actually putting it to use that creates the problem. Imagine the pr he'd get for this if he did it right. Makes that factory look a lot more appealing lol.

I love tesla as much as the next guy on here, but goddam dont be such a dickrider youll downvote someone that points this shit out"
Boo hoo
I don't think that's going to happen. I don't think Tesla would put their employees at risk to catching Cv19 by doing so unnecessary as building cars.
You're getting downvited but I agree with you.
"We close the bar , only offer togo now , but have to sell with food"
"Could it help save lives? If yes, then keep it open. If it can lead to more quickly spread long disease, shut it down. Why is this so hard to understand?"
"That's pretty consistent with NYS.

Note that the directive, at least at my employer, was interpreted as applying to corporate cafeterias too.  Our main site caf has been takeout-only since Tuesday.

There are some pictures circulating on Twitter purporting to be from Tesla's cafeterias indicating that Tesla was also violating this directive too - lots of people eating in close proximity in the cafeteria."
Facts?
"Fans, mostly.

There are typically pre-pressurized bottles too for larger injections of ""fresh"" air. But those are pressurized on the ground and (since that eliminates the need to be super mass-conscious about them) the pumps used to pressurize them are likely designed and built by a company like Maximator or Haskel, not SpaceX."
"OK, so you respond with ""it's unprecedented"". Tesla is incredibly flexible, and frequently does the impossible. I can meet you in the middle and agree that it would be tough, but tesla and SpaceX together are more than capable of manufacturing a workable ventilator in a stupid period of time."
"Well first:

Elon has yet to make a rocket that can go to Mars.

In fact, Elon has yet to even make a launch system that is human-rated, and as insanely stringent as the reliability and safety requirements for a human-rated rocket may seem, they're nothing whatsoever compared to current reliability and safety requirements for medical equipment, especially a ventilator.

Any engineering effort takes time to develop a product

Elon, at this point, almost surely doesn't know the requirements of the product itself.  His assertion that space HVAC systems are in any way relevant or helpful to this particular challenge shows that.

Even if he does manage to get something to production, the chances of it getting approved in time to matter are pretty slim.

DeBlasio hasn't said jack on TV.  The current state is:  Blas' staff are reaching out to Elon's staff, that's it.

Chances of this turning out differently than his failed ""child-sized minisub"" and ""pedo guy"" are slim to none.

Edit:  For reference, take a look at the ""We Are Not Waiting"" movement for Type I diabetes.  It was 3-4 years or more before an FDA-approved variation of Scott Leibrand and Dana Lewis' first closed-loop system showed up on the market, and there's still a 2-4 year lag between what's possible engineering-wise and has been implemented by DIYers willing to take the risk of a DIY insulin delivery system, and an FDA-approved solution.

Since we're in a crisis, things are a bit better as far as red tape for approvals, but keep in mind that our current testing crisis is the result of the FDA being too slow even in crisis to approve high-volume test regimens."

"The U.K. already abandoned that strategy for many good reasons, ICUs would have been overwhelmed anyway.  It is still good to protect the elderly as well as possible.

It could be something that is eventually tried but it is too late to put it together.  If we can't extinguish it we may start working towards protocols for implementing that kind of thing.

Our best bet now is to drive it down and hope for success with a vaccine or other treatments since there will be many countries out there that probably have trouble getting it driven down."

I'm saying exactly that. I've lived long enough to see multiple epidemics, and multiple economic crashes. When this is all over, the economies of the world will do what they always do. Recover and grow.

>You do realize that plenty of shareholders kill themselves when their retirements disappear due to recessions, right?

This is an utterly nonsense concern to have. I feel bad for people that have suicidal tendencies and ideation. But financial markets are inherently volatile, which is why as you age your portfolio should transition to more secure investments rather than volatile markets. These are also people that are most at risk of being killed by the virus, so, if we lower their risk they have a chance to actually draw down their retirement accounts.

>You understand that, even if someone doesn't kill themselves, the effect a global economy collapse would result in massive problems

Sure do. You realize that being dead is also a massive problem for a lot of people, right?

>far worse than a bunch of elderly/sick people dying

There it is. Well, now that you've revealed your true feelings, I think I'm done teasing it out of you. BTW, most people have an elderly relative or are themselves elderly. So, before dismissing people being dead as just some old folks, maybe have a twinge of empathy for all of the people impacted by relatives dying, or people being trapped in hospitals and having permanent disabilities. Not only old people are impacted here. Really give some thought to the things you value in life and how you can better yourself."
"For better or worse, a lot of states have been left to make their own choices. People in my state are pissed that the government ordered businesses closed (before the fed did), because they think what we really need is to get everyone exposed ASAP so we can all be immune. This is one of the most stupid ideas ever, but here we are. I've even seen FB posts arranging play dates and corona parties to get little kids exposed, like pox parties.

Other states, like Hawaii, are pissed that their government waited way too long to close businesses and they're pissed to not have a travel ban from the mainland. Obviously a state that completely relies on tourism to function needs to figure out the risks and realities before doing anything, but they were really on island time on this one.

I do generally agree with your sentiment, though. I think CoV-2 is far more prevalent in the US than we realize yet, and I think the lack of testing and healthcare coverage for people mask a lot of cases that just get ignored and spread. I've had my own experience with questioning whether I needed a test or not, but the doctor I saw pretty much said at the time that the CDC rules were already outdated and they'd have to lie to get anybody tested. So, anyway, here we all are.

My point about not having a choice about making hard choices, though, that is me saying it's already too late. We are absolutely going to be facing choices during triage. We've cut emergency funding and preparedness to the bone in the US. These decisions have been made years, months, even days before today, and they all culminated in whatever happens from here. My hope is that we've caught cases quickly, the voluntary quarantine decreases spread rates, and we don't overrun hospitals. Best case is people make fun of this like Y2K. Worst case, though, nobody's going to laugh."

Do you think anyone believes that the human species is at risk here? What is the alternative? Shrivel up and everyone dies?

Sure do? Far fewer people will ""be dead"", than people who will be suffering as a result of economic failure, OR as you pointed out, their dead family.

> Well, now that you've revealed your true feelings, I think I'm done teasing it out of you.

I made a comment that if the Global Economy collapses, there will be far more of an issue than elderly people dying, as shitty as it'd be. Do you think if all of those elderly people survived, and had to face a global collapse, they'd be the ones not suffering the most?

>So, before dismissing people being dead as just some old folks, maybe have a twinge of empathy for all of the people impacted by relatives dying, or people being trapped in hospitals and having permanent disabilities.

You mean like, me advising ALL of the elderly people I know to not leave their homes, and offering to get them goods when they need them so as they do not risk their personal health? 

Sorry you are too idiotic to recognize that something that effect 99% of the population is DRASTICALLY worse than .5% of the population dying. It would likely lead to more death through starvation ffs. But maybe you only care about western countries which will generally be fine?

Welp. I didn't make that argument. So. I guess good for you for making up an argument I didn't have, so you could try to ""win"".

>It would likely lead to more death through starvation ffs.

This is an utterly nonsensical claim. Food's still being bought, grocery stores are still being stocked, income protections are being put in place, eviction and foreclosures have been ordered to stop. So. I guess if you're not actually basing your argument on the reality of the world we see, fine. But I'm going to insist if you're going to discuss CoV-2's impact with me, we stick to this realm of reality.

>But maybe you only care about western countries which will generally be fine?

No, actually I've made other comments in actual threads about CoV-2 about people everywhere, not just in the US. See, what you don't seem to realize, even though you called _me_ an idiot, is that governments have this amazing ability to just inject cash into the economy whenever they want at the cost of inflation. So, since governments already pay farmers all over the world, and since they can continue to pay farmers to produce food which they then give citizens money to buy, it'll all be pretty okay.

I'm significantly more worried about people actually dying from an actual disease that's actually a pandemic rather than the fevered concern of global starvation because _muh economy_.

>Hilarious that the dude calling out someone for minimizing, also minimizes shit, to far worse of an extent.

Yeah, death is worse than a dip in stock values. If you find that funny, you should seek therapy.

>This is an utterly nonsensical claim. Food's still being bought, grocery stores are still being stocked, income protections are being put in place, eviction and foreclosures have been ordered to stop. So. I guess if you're not actually basing your argument on the reality of the world we see, fine. But I'm going to insist if you're going to discuss CoV-2's impact with me, we stick to this realm of reality.

You do realize that we were discussing the concept and effects of a economic failure, right? Comparing the effects of a global economic failure, to the effects that we MAY see from COVID. 

My point was, you are completely downplaying a Gobal Economic Failure. No different than what you are accusing Musk of doing in regards to COVID. Except you're actually minimizing it, whereas your examples of Musk are questionable at best, even if the dude is a massive cunt.

>No, actually I've made other comments in actual threads about CoV-2 about people everywhere, not just in the US. See, what you don't seem to realize, even though you called me an idiot, is that governments have this amazing ability to just inject cash into the economy whenever they want at the cost of inflation. So, since governments already pay farmers all over the world, and since they can continue to pay farmers to produce food which they then give citizens money to buy, it'll all be pretty okay.

Do you think North Korea is going to hop on that Band Wagon? How about other completely undeveloped third world countries? Do you think non-western countries may be disproportionately effected if there is a global collapse?

The entire point that this all spawned from was,

>You do realize that plenty of shareholders kill themselves when their retirements disappear due to recessions, right? You understand that, even if someone doesn't kill themselves, the **affect a global economy collapse would result in massive problems**, far worse than a bunch of elderly/sick people dying?

What you just described is a mechanism that the governments utilize to try to mitigate recessions. We don't know that they'll work, I'm not suggesting that they won't work. I am simply explaining that IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY FAILS, it will be far worse than the death toll from Corona.

>Yeah, death is worse than a dip in stock values. If you find that funny, you should seek therapy.

Ah yes, because I'm not talking about the effects that stock value dips have directly had on humans throughout history. Are you arguing that stock drops have not directly resulted in people committing suicide? Becoming impoverished? Suffering? Do you not see how that could occur on a MASS SCALE, if say.... The global economy failed?

>Amazing. You've totally lost the plot.

I guess there's some irony there eh?"
In what way?
"> Gobal Economic Failure.

And my point is your point is utter nonsense. And I'm over this conversation. ✌️"
>The tool of the person with no actual argument to make. Nice work.
" Hey bud,

https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/the-doctor-who-helped-defeat-smallpox-explains-whats-coming/

>Larry Brilliant says he doesn’t have a crystal ball. But 14 years ago, Brilliant, the epidemiologist who helped eradicate smallpox, spoke to a TED audience and described what the next pandemic would look like. At the time, it sounded almost too horrible to take seriously. “A billion people would get sick,"" he said. “As many as 165 million people would die. There would be a global recession and depression, and the cost to our economy of $1 to $3 trillion would be far worse for everyone than merely 100 million people dying, because so many more people would lose their jobs and their health care benefits, that the consequences are almost unthinkable.”

I guess it's not just me that thinks a global economic failure/recession/depression would be worse than a bunch of people dieing. The dude who literally helped cure Chicken Pox feels the same way.

Anyone credible you can cite?"
We'll see how you feel when it's your friends and family.
I can see you're clearly one for presenting strong arguments. Lol.
"If you don't understand the massive impact that the loss of expertise has, and the expertise that a company loses with the unexpected death of an employee- especially a senior level employee- then I can't expect you to understand any of the arguments I'd make.

You seem hell bent on believing that the economy is the most important thing to humanity. I find that idea repulsive, especially in the face of losing friends, family, and community members. Which, in case you didn't realize, _also_ has a depressing effect on the economy.

So by all means, worry yourself with how those poor, helpless investment bankers will survive on the millions they've already stashed away. And completely ignore the humanitarian crisis that the planet could potentially face."
">If you don't understand the massive impact that the loss of expertise has, and the expertise that a company loses with the unexpected death of an employee- especially a senior level employee- then I can't expect you to understand any of the arguments I'd make.

This is bullshit.

It's primarily killing people who are 85+, with 2 or more health issues. 

That is the most effected group, and those aren't the dudes in companies with the critical expertise. And if it is, then the company deserves to have lost that expertise for not having help pass it onto a candidate who wasn't already likely to have major health complications.

Really strong argument you made there though.

>You seem hell bent on believing that the economy is the most important thing to humanity.

Nope, I've simply said that 3% of the population dieing (Much of whom would be already sick, or elderly) likely is going to have less impact globally than a global economic failure.

The guy who has spent his life focusing on EPIDEMIOLOGY and helped cure something that to this day effects MILLIONS PER YEAR, seems to agree with that point.

>I find that idea repulsive, especially in the face of losing friends, family, and community members.

Oh yes, I can understand how you feeling personally impacted would make you feel like something was far worse than it could possibly be on a global scale.

At that scale, your feelings don't matter, nor do any of our loved ones. We are talking about humanity as a whole, not our little sect of people we only care about (hence my calling you out for only caring about the well being of westerners, which is quite clear when you're making this kind of appeal.)

> Which, in case you didn't realize, also has a depressing effect on the economy.

Not as bad as the economy just up and FAILING. Just cause your parents die doesn't mean we're going to go into a depression, if we do go into a depression, you can be damn well sure plenty of people will die and suffer as a result. Look at the last one. (Shit, recessions result in people dying, have we ever even SEEN a global economic failure?)

>So by all means, worry yourself with how those poor, helpless investment bankers will survive on the millions they've already stashed away. 

I'm worried about humanity if the economy collapses, and all of the elderly people who may still have their retirements invested into markets which are currently struggling.

>And completely ignore the humanitarian crisis that the planet could potentially face.

Keep downplaying the true cost of an global economic failure.

Jesus you are so much worse than Musk.



And since you likely won't bother to even read my reply,

Can you provide a citation from anyone with actual knowledge in a relevant field that holds your position? Or is it just your touchy feelings?"
"> It's primarily killing people who are 85+, with 2 or more health issues. 

Nope. Try again. Don't get your mortality rate from Elon's memes, please.

>The guy who has spent his life focusing on EPIDEMIOLOGY and helped cure something that to this day effects MILLIONS PER YEAR, seems to agree with that point.

So being an epidemiologist makes him an authority on the economy. Air tight argument.

You're also extremely focused on the mortality rate, which is obscenely high and you seem totally fine with. But you're completely missing all of the people that need hospitalization that don't die. There are people spending weeks to months in a hospital recovering. And not just a few of them. A major portion of the infected end up like this.

Everything you've said is focused solely on money. That's disgusting IMO. I hope you and your family stay well and healthy, but I'm entirely uninterested in having this conversation with you anymore. I am concerned about the human toll, you're concerned about money which is by definition imaginary. Maybe someday when you've lost enough people in your life, you'll understand my position better."
">Nope. Try again.

Really? Based off what?

Here's my source, https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6912e2.htm

>This first preliminary description of outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in the United States indicates that **fatality was highest in persons aged ≥85, ranging from 10% to 27%**, followed by 3% to 11% among persons aged 65–84 years,

Wow, look, EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

> Don't get your mortality rate from Elon's memes, please.

CDC = Elon Memes to you. Lul.

Try again maybe?

>So being an epidemiologist makes him an authority on the economy.

Well, compared to.... You?

Air tight argument.

>You're also extremely focused on the mortality rate, which is obscenely high and you seem totally fine with.

What grade level is your reading comprehension at currently? When is the last time you read a book?

>But you're completely missing all of the people that need hospitalization that don't die.

Where did I EVER say that?

> There are people spending weeks to months in a hospital recovering. And not just a few of them. A **major portion** of the infected end up like this.

<Citation needed> (You won't link one)

>Everything you've said is focused solely on money. That's disgusting IMO.

Missing the point of this entire thing, again.

> I hope you and your family stay well and healthy, but I'm entirely uninterested in having this conversation with you anymore.

Because you cannot bring anyone relevant to the discussion, or make any points that are of value.

> I am concerned about the human toll, you're concerned about money which is by definition imaginary. 

I'm actually concerned about the toll OVERALL on HUMANITY. Something of which the economy is part.

But I guess the economy has NOTHING TO DO with how we live our daily lives, does it?

>Maybe someday when you've lost enough people in your life, you'll understand my position better.

Maybe if you ever work on further develop your ability to critically think, you will understand my point.

Continue to try to pretend to know me though, lol.

(I'll repeat this, again, and you will continue to ignore it, because you can't reply to it)

Can you provide a citation from anyone with actual knowledge in a relevant field that holds your position? Or is it just your touchy feelings?"
CDC has released new findings about mortality rate and age cohorts. You're going to want to try to keep up here.
"> <Citation needed> (You won't link one)

Really called that one, did I?

Here's another CDC page updated as of the 21st, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications/older-adults.html

>Estimated percent who died

>10-27% of adults 85 years old and older

Do you have one that is more up to date? Their press release from today is literally still linking to those stats.

But of course, [you haven't actually cited shit.](https://i.imgur.com/tykWQ4D.png)"
"I get that you're only just catching up on all of this, but lots of us have been paying attention since December.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/coronavirus-in-young-people-is-it-dangerous-data-show-it-can-be

And as I've said before, go look up the long term effects of MERS and SARS on people of all age cohorts, then think to yourself what SARS-CoV-2 is likely to do to young people long term.

You don't know what you're talking about. You're getting your health advice from an out of touch billionaire meme lord. Think about that for a second, and reevaluate your choices."
"So you say,

>CDC has released new findings about mortality rate and age cohorts.

To which I reply,

>Here's another CDC page updated as of the 21st, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications/older-adults.html

>Do you have one that is more up to date? Their press release from today is literally still linking to those stats.
And then your citation is,

And then you come back and link me a fucking bloomberg article my dude?

Do you not see why this looks really dumb?

>And as I've said before, go look up the long term effects of MERS and SARS on people of all age cohorts, then think to yourself what SARS-CoV-2 is likely to do to young people long term.

Where in this thread have you seen this? Do you have dementia?

>You don't know what you're talking about.

And you do? I'm asking you for citations about you claiming CDC numbers being updated, and then you won't give them.

Because they don't exist.

And then you say shit like,

>You're getting your health advice from an out of touch billionaire meme lord.

When you literally just linked me an article from BLOOMBERG. A BILLIONAIRES NEWS PUBLICATION. The fucking irony my dude.

>Think about that for a second, and reevaluate your choices.

I hope you understand the irony that you keep saying this, and then continue to spout off the most incredibly stupid shit. Thank you for the laugh.

This is all without even bothering to address that even the article you linked, goes on to literally show a table of the exact stat I bothered to mention. You absolute dolt. https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i4bda8ULyO2k/v1/600x-1.jpg"
"> And then you come back and link me a fucking bloomberg article my dude?

Can you not read? The bloomberg article _describes what the CDC data is showing you_. I know this is hard, but this is what being an adult is like. They even link to the Stastia page which breaks down the CDC data. Because obviously you're not able to.

This is really sad, man. These are basics of adult life, and you're not doing well. So. I'm gonna end this here."

We're gonna need a bigger showroom
"I feel like most show rooms I’ve seen are a bit tight with one or 2 models,  maybe 3. 

Which do you think Tesla will stop showcasing to show model y?"

One of my favorite parts of the job was driving the cars in and out of the showroom, then through the mall. 😊"

Is it Christmas already?
Northpark mall?

Northpark Mall?
Its the coronavirus line up!
Northpark Mall?
\*Fappening intensifies\*
To match the stocks?
Why can't they just offer the chrome delete like on the Model Y?  Who would want to highlight the cheap plastic bits anyway?
Those rims need to be glossy white. Nothing looks better on a red car than white rims.
"Not a bad choice there!

If I were buying it would be a Model S for me."
"Why showcase those wheels...

EDIT: Sorry I still can't get over how bad these look. Most people agree. It's ok to be unique. But they should market what most people find good looking."
Too soon! lol
Look at it this way - stocks are on sale!

Just like *their stock FTFY
Lol
Mount the cyber truck upside down on the ceiling.
"Strangely, I think the S, based on the cars people seem to look at when I've been in the showroom.

The 3 always has a steady stream of what appear to be genuinely interested buyers. Then they all stop off at the X on the way out. Every child, obviously, makes a bee-line straight for the X. And almost nobody even glances at the S

I did wonder if they'd have the Y in the showrooms and remove the 3, since they're pretty similar for the most part other than height and the hatch. But then the same logic mostly goes for the X and S too, so for me it makes sense to keep the most popular models in the showroom."
"The Cybertruck is going to draw crowds.   I can see those being put out in the center of the concourse in malls and other high-traffic areas, just so people don't get squished inside the Tesla showroom."
Imo the X
"I would say the 3, since it and the Y are very similar cars but that is probably unlikely."
The S.
"maybe there should be 2 showrooms, 1 showroom for s3x and other for y,cyber,(model2?)"

I heard they'll be developing special display vehicles at 3/4 scale to fit all four in most showrooms.

"They sure look good on pictures like this, but I think the red looks a bit too magenta under the sun. But that‘s just my subjective taste."
"I like it a lot better in person than in pictures. The blue is the opposite... I was almost dead-set on getting blue based on just pictures, but then seeing it in person, it was much darker than the blue my mind wanted. Once I saw the red in person it was a done deal."
"Not a fan of a sporty X (red/blue). We got ours in gray and I think it looks a lot better imo, but I’m also a fan of the white. Red looks sick on the 3 and S though, for sure"
You got it!
We need to clean out that mouth!

"I have a red Model 3, and while I agree it's good looking, if I'm ever in an accident that requires paint I'm going to eat the difference and have them repaint it in Mazda's Soul Red Crystal.  In dull light it's amazing, in bright sun it is phenomenal."
Yes
The trim is metal.  The door handles are metal
just get aftermarket delete
I'ma gone head and take the model 3
I think they are the best
Perfect time to buy $TSLA :)
The current price is still higher than it ever was before this year
It’s only a loss if you sell.
"If you don't need to sell, buy as much as you can now, of any stock you like.  Everything's down, even stuff like Netflix that should be going up with people being told to stay home.  It's all on sale."

Just park the other cars on top of it
"I see about 20 times more 3’s and X’s on the road than I do S’s, so I think the S in general will decline, and so will the X once the Y comes out."
The Cybertruck would take up all the room
Nah. Those gull wing doors are made for the show floor. Doesn’t even matter if it’s the most unpopular Tesla. That car gets people in the door. The X will be replaced by the Roadster. The Y replacing the 3 will serve the X’s purpose after that.
I think the X is the most popular due to the doors
are you on meth?
I don't think that would be a good idea.

"I agree, I wish the red looked like this picture!"
"The opposite. Red looks amazing - like bright popping cherry crimson under the Sun while muted and like dry blood red with not enough lights. 

IMO, the best colors on the Tesla are : Red, then Blue, then Black, White and Gray."
"also i agree that the blue is way too dark...they should’ve made it brighter, imagine how good a poppin’ bright blue would look on the Roadster!"
"100% agree! X looks better in calmer colors like White, Gray, and Black.
Red suits the sportier look of the 3 and S for sure! 
(fun fact: Model Y looks SO good in Red and Blue)"
Knew it.
Knew this had to be North Park. Been window shopping at this location so many times
The Tesla showroom in Honolulu is much nicer.

Well that just makes it worse then.  It makes a higher quality part look like cheap plastic.
"From what I've read it doesn't look quite right, especially the door handles. Like you can tell it's a wrap vs an actual single piece.  And it will end up starting to peel off in a couple years anyway.  I'm the type that keeps a car for at least a decade and I don't see myself getting it redone multiple times.  If I was going to do it I'd just buy new trim pieces.  I'd much prefer it be a factory option though."

Yeah I'm pretty much expecting the same thing
Could you fit the model y and 3 inside the cyber-trunk?
Or they could make the room bigger.
When I bought my X I was told the S is the least popular by far.   Does anyone have any hard numbers on sales ?
I thought the X sold more than the S?
"I'm thinking that Elon's nerdy enough that, after the cybertruck is successful, they might announce a smaller vehicle that uses similar construction techniques.

If so, I'd say go all the way... put the gull wing doors on it and grab the Delorean name. That'd sell on it's own. But, now it's made for cheap, and runs on electricity."
"I wouldn't quite say most popular, but certainly more popular than the S

When I've been in the showroom the Model 3 has been the most popular with people coming to take a look, followed by the Y. I don't think I've seen anyone even sit in the S since the 3 came out..."
I feel like pretty much everyone hanging out on this sub would fall under that “incredible amount of product knowledge” category lol

Well from my observations yes
"Judging purely on the S:3:X ratios in my area, that definitely seems to be the case. I see mostly 3s, a lot of Xs, and the occasional S."
"I believe thats true. The 3 really cannibalized S sales. The Y will do similarly to the X, but probably not quite as significantly. The X still has a lot more utility."
"I predict Elon and tesla are kinda done with the falcon wing doors, he has said in the past that it makes it harder for production and in a vehicle that costs let's say $20k, production would be there main challenge. We already saw that cheaper = more cars being bought."
Agreed.
Correct. Just looked at location data of the photos I took and is indeed Waikiki.  Beautiful.
"Longer range, smoother ride, more durable, cheaper to replace. The lost of pros is very long. The list of cons, as far as I can tell, consists of “I don’t like the way they look.”"

I don't think that's right.
Luuuuuuulz.
"For me it’s mostly 3s, and maybe sliiightly more 3s than Xs, but not by much. But the amount of 3s really gives me hope for the Y!"
"Yes, and i understand there are practical problems with them too. But if you were the nerd-in-chief, could make impractical decisions from time to time, and were heading in the general direction of a Delorean anyhow... wouldn't you?

Perhaps it can tell you a link has been received from someone and ask you if it wants you to have it read aloud
I don't have a Tesla but that sounds so obvious.
I just want an option to stop making it read out loud at all.
Wait. So if I send my Tesla owning friends a link to pornhub it will read the link out loud?
"That’s a great idea. Can we also get a way to reverse the way the numbers show up for a contact, so it mirrors how’s its listed in your phone (for Model 3)?  For instance I may have a contact with three numbers, the first one being the priority go to number and the last being the least used. In the S/X it gives me the first number in my phone first, but in the 3 (which is the model I have) it does the reverse so that you need to scroll to the last number to be at the actual first number logged in your phone under that contact. I’m not sure about everyone else, but I find this fairly annoying and since it’s already implemented in the S/X I feel like they should be able to make it happen fairly easily for the 3."
"Might be a dumb question, but can you have it so it doesn't read the message but displays it?"
Agreed. It reminds me of the episode of Parks and Rec where the sign guy reads out an entire URL from the Knope campaign.
Can i up vote this 5000 times? Although it cracks up my 8 year old everytime
"Why doesn't volume work against these either, or am I missing something obvious?"
It was humorous the first couple of times ;0-
The first time it was kind of funny to hear the whole link outloud. Every single time after that is just like a nail on a chalkboard. Deff tweet this to Elon.
"What?  You don’t like hearing...

“Aych ...  tee... tee... pee...  colon.... forward slash....  forward slash...  double you...  double you... double yooooooo...”"
Join a Webex conference while on AP.  Thank me later.
"Yes there has been other posts about this too. It NEEDS to happen. Another bug is that if you have your navigate voice on mute, it will activate it while reading a text and both voices will be playing! Tried activating voice control to stop it but it just makes it quieter for a few seconds.

But I also recall Elon tweeting about this about two weeks ago maybe?"
And also to fix the problem with RCS chat for Android Messages.
"Since Android Messages rolled out RCS support recently my Tesla has been reading these huge content-type, character-encoding strings. Kinda funny the first time but renders the whole thing useless obviously."
Pretty sure this could/should be moved to firstworldproblems
Things we never expected: “My car is talking too much!”
"Oh that's cool that it actual reads the texts out, though I do see your issue being valid af. Mine never did half the cool stuff it was supposed to after updates. I always attributed this to it being an early model. I will admit I was looking forward to this after the latest update notes, though.

In fact, after the text reading/""latest"" update (that I'm aware of), I specifically lost function when pressing the voice command button on the steering wheel. I'd have to press it, wait 10 seconds while it thought and didn't listen to me, then it would give me a question mark icon and I'd have to press it twice again in rapid succession right after for it to give me the noise prompt to speak my command. I eventually just started initiating calls from my phone, which isn't a big deal but I'm kind of a hounder when it comes to fucking around with your phone while propelling a machine weighing many tons at significant speed, so I was disappointed the update didn't work as intended on my vehicle. Then again, I'm one of those people who thinks that texting and driving should be treated the same as DUI, and I'm also a libertarian. That's how much this shit bothers me."
I couldn't agree more. Please let there be a button to interrupt it in case the text is of sensitive nature that occupants of the car can't hear.
U/greypilgrim1973 is there an awesomely embarrassing story behind this?
Ache tee tee pee colon slash slash double you double you double you dot oh good idea dot com slash fingers underscore crossed question mark
John Smith sent a Rickroll.
"Also, I have my navigation muted, but if it’s in the middle of reading a text it will also start speaking the navigation instructions. I’ve bug reported it, waiting for fix."
"Can we just get a complete redesign of the whole texting interface - it’s the most maddening thing. You can’t tell if it understood your reply and sent it , there’s no list of texts ...I guess you shouldn’t be texting in the car anyway but it’s so poorly implemented I wish it wasn’t there at all. I keep trying to make it work!"
"https://imgur.com/gallery/ToRaxXp
You can send a text message? I can’t even get it to pick the right saved seat position."
"wow, this is hilarious. who came up with that idea? reading full url's :)"
"When it reads out someone’s response to a group text and you dictate a message back, it sends it directly back to the person. It doesn’t have the ability to text the group."
I'm on Pixel 1 and it does not read my texts - is there a setting I need to enable?
My car when a I get a text with a link in it be [like](https://youtu.be/dU6EMlfjPFA)
"Would prefer if it didn't read out the full decoded RCS message first. There's only so many times you can listen to it read out ""encoding utf8"" before you want to throw it in the sea"
r/softwaregore
Google needs to do this too.  Ridiculous that it reads out full URL's.  Or at least stop at the .com .gov etc.
I'd like to be able to cancel reading a text too.. Can be embarrassing...
Also if you reply to a group text your reply only goes to the one person who sent that text.
Oh you rich people- you guys are dealing with  a seriously different kind of problem here 😂😂
Read out just the first part. It’s useful to know that somebody sent you a twitter.com link. You just don’t need to know that it’s tweet /1857194619462
"I think more important is the suppression of the reading of the RCS header, it's a quite old bug: https://old.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/enwzoe/teslas_text_message_update_makes_googles_new_chat/"
Maybe Tesla can use their AI to identify the beginning of the URL. /s
"I've never been able to get the text reading feature to work.  On a positive note, this URL issue doesn't bother me at all."
"Yea, or the headers.  Whenever my wife sends me an emoji, I'd hear it read off a random string for about a minute."
r/firstworldproblems
Do Teslas not do Android Auto? I'm interested in them but can't afford one just yet.
Shut up and drive the fucking car.
"Or make the link clickable, photo displayed, etc..."
just tweet elon.
Again I just ask for freaking Android auto/carplay as an app. Please 🙌🙌🙌🙌
Add apple carplay and android auto
I don’t understand why Tesla doesn’t support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto??! What the hell? Supposed to be so advanced but a $20k Kia has better infotainment than literally any Tesla.
They already know it's a thing. Posting here does no good.
petitions dont work
"Yeah, I'd be fine with this too."
Yes. This is the correct answer.  Give me the option to stop the reading.  Either I can read it faster than she can or I don't necessarily want EVERYTHING read out loud.
I pushed both buttons and it stopped. Was going to reboot but it stopped before it so I let off
I think I heard someone mention you can use the controls on the steering wheel to interupt? - not an owner myself.
I cosign that.
please goddamn I don’t need it read out loud every time
"I haven't turned it on yet. So you can't stop it from playing a message? I don't trust my friends to enable it for when my family is in the car!  


Feature request: Only play messages when I'm solo in the car."
"Does anyone else get the thing where if you start dictating a response, but dismiss the window before you finish (because you decided not to respond) it temporarily turns on the turn-by-turn voice if you have it muted?

Super weird bug."
The Spotify app is still pretty rough...
"Yep I look at major features like this and I’m glad to have them at all considering it wasn’t part of the car I bought, wasn’t promised at the time and I never expected it. All bonus stuff to me, and pretty cool. With every past brand I’ve had, I’d have needed to buy a whole new car to get this kind of new feature."
On my car (pre-AP) the instrument cluster dial literally covers a third of the text area. You couldn’t read the text if you wanted to. It’s a feature!
Viable is very generous
This is their MO.  It's MVPs all the way down.
I still get a kick out of it. What’s also good is if you make some super long embarrassing name for your friends for it to read out.
" I would prefer Google Hangouts messages to be read and be able to reply to....they are from people I want to converse with and I finally have my mom using hangouts! (big win)

Slide the card down
If the passenger seat senses an occupant than don’t read it for privacy reasons. Only read texts if you’re alone in the car.
Or text him a link to this thread and see if he gets it while driving.
Yeah they make petitions even more useless than they already are.
Or just be patient. Don't people think Tesla is actively working to improve this Brand.New.Feature. The engineers and Musk himself drive these cars daily. I'm sure they want it to be more usable too.
I don’t have twitter but if you could ask him for manual control of mirror dimming that would be amazing. Thanks!
I'm sat here losing my shit over this. I want to hear it
"You mean you don't like listening to a two minute jumble of characters when someone texts you ""ok""?"
Here in Europe no one uses SMS anymore.
Same question from me.
In iPhone you Must set “Show notifications” in the Tesla Bluetooth entry under iPhone setting-Bluetooth
I've been meaning to post and ask if y'all get this too... Have we already created a whole thread about this bug? Damn it's awkward to get messages from an ex I blocked 2 years ago lol
This.
"YES! I get this too. I have a Google Pixel 2 XL, you?"
Wait... you actually got it to send a message successfully?
I think that's an issue with it not understanding the RCS format.
"It's easy to turn it on but it keeps turning itself off randomly. I've not been able to figure out any pattern to what causes it, but it will never stay enabled for more than a day or a two at a time."
Tried it
I’ve heard this is a limitation of MAP (message access profile) for Bluetooth but I have not read the specification myself.  Please support CP/AA.  I know it won’t happen but I can hope.
😎
"Not as of yet, but it’s only a matter of time 😬"
“I’m sorry I can’t hear you...I’m wearing a jacuzzi-suit!”
"Very much so.  Still, when in Rome..."
You just wanna rickroll people as they're driving.
This would be awesome for navigating to locations! If my passenger looks up a place to eat they have to share the link to my phone then I share it to the car. This could skip that second step!
They shouldn’t do any of that while the car is in drive.
"I mean I totally disagree with the latter part of your comment but I do agree that at this point carplay/Android auto as an app is totally necessary. For both lossless audio and for things like this... Bonus is Google assistant/ Siri Integration which I can then use to set reminders, etc like I do all day long. Right now I just end up picking up my phone so I don't forget things."
I have my navigation instructions muted but when I read out a text message it starts telling me the turn by turn - anyone else deal with this?
Didn’t work for me (2015 model S)
"This! Especially when I have kids in the car. Text in the cluster is fine. Reading “Aw yeah, totally. Fuck that guy! He’s a total piece of shit and would fuck over his own mother. And check this shit out http://jdndjeododmdndndkdod” is not great at 90db with the kids in the back seat."
Doesn’t it only read it if you press it?
"You still have to tap the screen to have it read the message aloud.

The annoying part is there is no way to stop it once it starts, hence this post. Especially bad if there's a url in the message."
You have to tap the button or bubble on the screen to begin reading so just ignore when family in car
I do the infamous scroll-wheel reset like twice a day because of this 🙄
Spotify integration is pretty shit no matter who integrates it in their software.
"Sometimes viable is just ""doesn't throw errors and crash the software and all the backend is wired together"""
“Dick Hertz says please call the doctor”
"hangouts would be so nice... as long as google doesn't kill it.

Speaking of google, they gotta fix their transcription shit too. I get so many robocalls from chinese voices that google somehow transcribes into random english that actually seems important."
Easily prevented by simply adding it to the Entertainment dashboard 👈amirite👉
This won't stop the audio
"That is for sure a good practice. But my issue is that I don't always need or want the car to read the whole thing. I'm a very fast reader, and sometimes I just don't want to hear the whole message. I want to be able to cut audio and move on sometimes because I can be faster than the car reading the entire message."
"Underrated comment, LOL"
"Yes but its hard for Musk and his team to notice everything, so raising a tiny bit of awareness for something people want updated puts it on their list - where it may or may not have already been."
"how about tweet to him *then* be patient. 

Nothing wrong with tweeting it at him"
"We can be patient, but there's also features that are nowhere near brand new anymore with lots of glaring issues that haven't been fixed, Spotify being one. We don't need to be dicks and entitled about it, but there's nothing wrong with showing that lots of people want a certain patch."
"""Message ID EF173FBA653842453 Charset UTF-8...."""
"You guys need to enable the option in the BT menu. ""Read incoming text messages."". Afterwards you'll likely need to provide permission from your phone."
No idea how to do this either ?
Thank you.
Does it only get messages from exes? That's funny
Pixel 3 xl here. Is it just pixel?
Yes. But there's no confirmation beep. It just goes away from the screen upon sending.
"Ah, that would make sense.  The people that most often text me have RCS enabled."
Thanks
"No I just want the stuff displayed on my screen, I don't really care about other people and what they're doing."
Here's someone who's following my thought
You do know we already have a web browser...
"There are a bunch of these weird little audio bugs hiding in the software. When there’s more than one thing going on audio-wise in the car, sometimes the bass on the music will jump *all* the way up (and then return to normal when the second audio source stops)"
Ah ha yes! Mine did this. Was super odd.
"Mine does that too, but not every time."
Yes
"The way it's implemented also messes with the volume on my phone. It pushes the volume down super low, and I have to turn it back up on the phone itself. It's infuriating."
"These are privacy settings in other cars.

""On my profile, don't dictate texts when passengers are present."""
"Even Android Auto lets you interrupt texts being read aloud.  Come on, Tesla!"
"No you don't have to tap the screen..you can use the right scroll wheel to do everything. To read the message requires a press on the right scroll wheel- to reply, another press on the wheel, to send press again.. It doesn't randomly read them. You just hear the audible ping then choose whether to read it by using that scroll wheel or ignore that ping."
Switching to a Slacker stream and then back to Spotify tends to resolve most issues for me.
That's someone else's definition. Someone I don't want to work with.
Is Google threatening to kill hangouts?
Yeah that's more what I would like. To be able to just stop it and clear it from the screen.
What would you suggest? Click a scroll wheel to skip?
+1. If there is community pressure its not a guarantee something will be fixed but it does make things go from on the list of currently known issues to actively being worked on a bit quicker sometimes
My random messages are from an ex also.
No it's others too. Just more likely to be an ex I think cuz you'll have more text conversations with them than anyone else.
"I suspect it's because our devices have the newest software and our messaging apps are already using RCS. iPhones will be different, and a lot of Android phones are so fragmented with old software versions that most of their tests probably didn't involve RCS.

Edit: I'm going to try disabling Chat Features (disabling RCS). You can access that by going to the Messages App and then Settings. I think it's likely to ~~solve~~ circumvent the problem."
Which should not be used by the driver while driving...there’s a reason the disable media in the browser if the car is in drive.
"I find that my car's ""phone media"" volume level keeps dropping down seemingly at random when I get in and leave the car. At least once a day, I need to turn it back up to a hearable volume, despite never turning it down."
"Hm, should try that. Still stupid."
"Speaking about software development generally, thats the usual definition anymore"
"Yeah but here we're talking ""minimum viable"""
"They're planning to change it into hangouts chat and hangouts meet, but hard to say what impact that will have on existing users. But it is google, and they love to end support for things at will."
"Yeah maybe, would probably be most hands free. Wouldn't mind if there was just an x in the top right corner or something. Sliding the box down is cool but doesn't always register right, so I think a simple x or close button would work best."
Then it is not that funny :(
Not sure what links you're clicking but mine aren't media
"For me it’s the opposite which is arguably worse. My phone volume keeps going to MAX volume seemingly at random. At least once a day I have my eardrums blown out by a text or even the click the phone makes when you put it to sleep, god forbid a phone call.

Called support several times about it. They can’t seem to recreate it and just waive it as a fluke, but alas I’m still dealing with it. Scary as hell honestly when you least expect it and the sound of a text comes BLARING through the speakers."
"100% agreed, especially now that they want to charge $10/month for a broken-ass Spotify app."
"So...if you’re saying reading an article while driving it’s OK? I’m really not understanding the argument here...

The reason it reads the messages instead of just showing them is so you keep your eyes on the road. Opening links or other content is simply enabling distracted driving."
"I believe this is a form of torture seen in both LOST and The Walking Dead.

I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. If this happened to me, I'd probably end up just not even pairing my phone to the car."
"That sucks, man. :("
"Yeah, that's basically unacceptable, even I admit."
"I think once my premium connectivity ""trial"" expires, I might just start emailing them pictures every single time a bug happens. Eventually they'll have to address it."
Demand a refund. Honestly. Elon won't let it slide if it becomes a cost.
For the car?
"No, the premium monthly fee, every month they don't fix it ask for a refund"
"Ah, I see."
"Umm, let's not have any confusion about the source and its meaning.

> It is a motivator for us. Tesla has 10 years more experience. But we are very quick in catching up.

This is a fact, based on the calendar, and is in no way suggesting it'll take them 10 years to catch up if they put their money where their mouth is."
"When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007, they claimed that their software was '5 years ahead of anything else out there', that proved somewhat accurate as it honestly took about 4-5 years for their (at the time) competitors to catch up to their latest product in about 2012 (WP7.5, Google's offerings, Moto's later efforts, the Galaxy S2 or so, beating the iPhone 4 proved hard). Mostly by copying of course but that's okay, that's how innovation works. When everyone takes this seriously then I think you'll probably see about a 5-8 year delay on quality offerings that start to be somewhat competitive and purely competitive models by late 2020s. (Assuming Tesla continues to innovate)"
The EV market is as big as the ICE market. Room for many players.
"Supercharger network continues to be my biggest differentiator. After owning another EV for a couple years before my Model 3, I don’t trust the other networks’ pricing, reliability or availability anywhere close to Tesla (who improves their lead with the recent update that shows out of service stalls). 

I really don’t know what the solution is though and if one exists that wouldn’t compromise in pricing/reliability/availability. I’m a Tesla fan now but it’s never good for a company to be so dominant and unchallenged."
"I don’t see how this isn’t anything but obvious. It’s quite clear they got a head start. This is what Elon wanted: to inspire all vehicle manufacturers to starting getting away from fossil fuels

So yes, they got a head start to a race they instigated. It’s like when you were a kid and walking next to a sibling. They suddenly say “Race ya home!”, start running and brag about beating you"
"""volkswagen says tesla has been making cars for a decade"" would be one accurate headline."
"Much easier to catch up, then spend all of the time and R&D on building it yourself. 

But, one thing to remember...is that Tesla had to build everything from scratch...and in order to get a decent ROI, they had to sell expensive vehicles where margins are better.  Now that another Gigafactory is being built in Europe...along with China and soon, for Cybertruck...Tesla, along with their battery improvements, wiring improvements in the Y, etc...they can easily build a 45KW, 220 miles, smaller, Model 2 sized vehicle for $27,999 in the U.S.  Perhaps a 12"" screen instead of 15""...perhaps 0-60 in 5.7 seconds...without things like heated seats, power seats, power steering wheel...but, still with OTAs, safety, acceleration far better than Civic, corrola, Prius, etc.

&#x200B;

I see Tesla in a better position after doing this 1,000,000 times...and with recent acquisitions of battery tech companies"
"It should say that VW admits that Tesla started producing cars 10 years before VW started production of electric vehicles. 
It does not suggest that Tesla is 10 years more advanced, it edifies Tesla’s progress in the market place. And suggests that any lead that Tesla might currently have could be diminished in significantly less than 10 years. Anything that Tesla is doing is encouraged. Tesla is promoting the market for electric vehicles. VW is not in competition with Tesla. They are competing with GM and Toyota."
"r/titlegore has entered the chat

poster child for clickbait"
"No, now it’s 11 because legacy companies still aren’t even trying."
"Nissan was first to market with a mass consumer electric car that was somewhat affordable (the Leaf). I know they had some controversy with Ghosn, but they really flubbed a several year head start. Technology-wise not is the same league as Tesla, but still..."
"Where I see some of the big car makers going: fewer global models.  Even BMW is looking to trim down their engine variants, as it's just not economical.

VW will figure a way to make a single car hit a 10-20k variant in price points, similar to Tesla."
"But it’s the battery making capacity that Tesla will have in a couple of years that will help give it an almost unassailable lead in both design and capacity. VW has been not only caught flat footed, but their inability to make its own batteries and also not crash its ICE production is what will hold it back for at least another decade, in my mind."
Who cares? Any new tech and good ideas will be implemented in future cars anyways.
Amazing that a relatively small and new auto maker is so far ahead of a giant they has been around for 80 years!

Tesla is 10 years ahead regardless of whether it’s electric or not.
"10 year headstart means nothing imo. It's a very short period and other cos can easily copy and catch up.

Look at Ford. They have the MachE which copied Tesla screen. But people have bought all reservations. Soon there will be enough of these driving around.

Competition is good for us. Keeps Tesla innovating too.

Elon Musk and Tesla are synonymous with EV and he's the father of the modern EV industry. He will be in textbooks of the future."
"Tesla has unmatched brand equity. That's going to carry them. If you want hand sanitizer you're looking to find purell in stores, if you want an electric car you're looking at teslas"
"And Tesla is ahead of some others by 6 years, here is what it makes Tesla ahead of its competitors. Detailed review.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL1Jttt1\_3M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL1Jttt1_3M)"
It’s important to understand this doesn’t mean they are 10 years ahead. It means they’re a few and others companies don’t have to learn from their mistakes.
That's like admitting the sky is blue!
"Tesla will have few high priced cars, while the small-medium size will be dominated by european Brands in Europe."
Similar comment made by Toyota except it was 6 years. Things like this makes me think that buying a Tesla is worth the difference. I wouldn't even buy last year's phones.. why should I buy a car that is 6 years behind?
Now tesla has to admit 10-year headstart in the hydrogen car race to someone else :)
They also have years of driver data for autonomous driving. That's the real value.

"I'm especially stunned about how VW is turning all of their resources to the EV, without properly knowing how the market will react. If this path would show as the wrong one, it would have been a definitive end of VW. It's obvious that they want to fix their rep after Dieselgate, but this could be a fatal mistake."
VW have a ton of Dieselgate baggage which hasn’t come to a close yet. There are still board members involved in the deception who will still have to go to court. Tesla has no brand baggage and an integrity among Generation Z that VW can only dream of. Look at the tremendous fan base Tesla has built up since 2012 without any advertising and you’ll see that the Tesla brand has achieved awesome visibility and desirability in just eight short years. Give them another decade and they’ll be the undisputed pack leader. Most of Generation Z see Elon Musk as a deity that walks on water - that in the brave new world of electrification is what sells cars.
Volkswagen will catch them. As long as they don't lie about distance of their cars.
"""“I would say that we share a vision, which is that we only can achieve the CO2 targets and reduce carbon emissions through electric cars,” Diess said""

Hilarious coming from VW"
Tesla has ten more years of experience because the other companies sat at the starting line and deliberately pretended that there was no race.
"Don’t get me wrong, VW is making a good move by going all in on EVs and trying to challenge Tesla. However, I haven’t forgotten and will probably never forgive them for their outright lies, coverups & attitude after getting exposed with Dieselgate. I sincerely hope they have actually changed as a company, but deep down I feel like they haven’t changed at all and are just trying to look future ready/forward thinking."
"Tesla makes all of their patents available for other companies, because Tesla wants to make all transport sustainable, including all current car manufacturers."
"It really depends on how they sell.

If they build a car that's as good as the Model 3 but it only sells half as many units, that doesn't help them that much. They not only need a compelling car, they need to be able to sell it in Tesla-beating numbers.

I think they'll be hard pressed to create something as compelling as the Model 3, which basically checks all the boxes as far as economy, performance, price and brand cache."
"Of course it should take them less than 10 years to catch up. They are able to learn from the years of Tesla's efforts. Their successes and their mistakes/errors. Not to mention reverse engineering Tesla vehicles.

If it takes them longer than 10 years to catch up either they are doing something very wrong or Tesla is doing something very exceptional."
"The problem is they not only need to vertically integrate \*OR\* work far more closely with its suppliers so they can truly perform OTA's AND get the overall efficiency of the Tesla platform. They also need to learn how to truly adopt agile software development principals and become a leading software developer.   


Tesla changed the problem, they not only need to build a great car as it rolls off the assembly line but instead a great car that continues to get better and does not need to visit the local VW dealer to have maintenance every couple months.  


And on that note, they also have the problem of the dealers to handle too."
Sure enough they can't put their money into cheating their way out this time.
The problem is that they won't put their money where their mouth is.
"Let's not forget to that VAG has a excellent parts. Supply network, service network and information access including diagnostic software (Odis) all available to the afterwards repairer

Tesla unfortunately still lacks this"
"I read that Tesla is really ahead of everyone by 4 years. If they start now, they could stay at the 4 years behind level, because Tesla is still innovating. I honestly think the winner to compete will be the company admit defeat and license Batteries and charging network from Tesla.   
Lets not talk about FSD or Home energy either. None of them are even close in that department. They completely slept on it, but at least their hand is forced."
"Money doesn't buy you talent experience or time. The problem was never money. The problem is the world only produces so many talented engineers, and Tesla and spaceX currently get the top picks, even offsetting the past number 1 choice among graduating engineers NASA.

Volkswagon will probably never catch up unless Tesla's culture of pushing fast and hard collapses. I guarantee you none of the current major automakers had employees working like their existence depends on it, even though that is the case for most of them now. The real enemy of legacy auto is their own complacency and lack of urgency, you cannot redefine corporate culture for a company with money and words, traditional companies (not just auto) all lack relevant incentive structures to compete with tesla or SpaceX. There is a reason Tesla is the only company making a profit on EVs and SpaceX is the only company that can land an orbital rocket."
"VW has more experience in cars and more money for sure. But electric cars are a different species of car. If they get stuck trying to evolve their existing fleet into electric versions I think they will fail. 

They can’t take a car that wasn’t designed for the extreme weight and space of batteries, the extreme aerodynamics and totally different drive train and efficiently compete."
"Any minute now these big established car makers are gonna destroy Tesla and catch up whenever they decide to. Any minute... just waiting on them to try... /s

They are fucked. They won’t do it and even when they try it’s gonna be too late. Tesla has already pretty much won. I’ve converted and I’m not even looking at or considering any other brand. They all seem subpar or way overpriced."
"They might not think it will, or be willing to admit that publicaly, but the reality is that they likely will never catch up and they even have a high likelihood of going bankrupt in the process of trying."
"The ID3/ID4 seem like compelling products, and while Tesla inarguably has the lead on tech and integration, I wouldn't say VW isn't offering a quality offering.  The tight system integration and software might be the hardest part, but that doesn't have to take a decade to resolve (if they are willing/determined)"
Safe assumption at the end there.
"I think people is not seeing the big picture here. Superchager+Autonomous+Tesla solar roof+Home battery+constant innovation put them, in fact, ten years or more ahead in the game."
"*bigger than the ICE market ever has been. Since the ICE market has already started shrinking, and the population is growing, and especially with China lower class rising into middle and middle to upper, the market for EVs is indeed larger than the ICE market ever was."
"As more cars come onto the market, with greater investment, greater demand/use, more incentive to build it out, the CCS network should improve signicantly beyond where it already is.  Now I would hope that growth in demand would spread infrastructure costs around and ensure a reasonable profit without needing to gouge customers, but only time will tell.  \[And the government incentives I can think of off the top of my head for building out the public charging infrastructure in North America is for CCS/CHAdeMO, so I'm not sure what the means for Tesla in the long run\]

But for sure, Tesla's charging network is a solid selling point on cost, availability, and commitment to improving it."
"This is where the 5-10 lead is convenient for those followers.  Tesla and to create their own supercharger network, but third party and public chargers are also maturing and will eventually catch up.  VW won’t have to have a charging network because it is likely to be there by the time they really need it"
"In theory conventional automakers could build superchargers as t their dealerships.  It wont lead to destination charging, but would make urban charging a breeze."
"This. Elon has said all along that he wants all car makers to move to more environmentally responsible propulsion. Sure, Tesla dominate now, but Elon still wins when we all go electric (or similar)."
"Well, it is a Teslarati article, so no surprise there."
You can get a fully loaded GTI/GLI with all those bells and whistles for $28K.  Tesla isnt going to sell a Model 2 at that price if it isnt loaded
"if they dont offer 10 interior options, heated seats and power steering as well as the basic autopilot features they are not going to sell anything as people dont give any fucks about OTA and other cars in the class have these features."
[deleted]
"may I present exhibit 1. Intel vs Amd, you can decide which one.

nothing is unassailable if you have the resources and money"
"Eh, it takes a lot longer to innovate than copy. What took Tesla 10 years to create from scratch others could copy in 2-3 years, especially with the amount of money VW has. I don't think Tesla's technology lead is guaranteed beyond the next 5-10 years.

A great example of that is IBM. In the early days of computing they were the gold standard, but other companies slowly caught up and surpassed them. The same could easily happen to Tesla if they are not careful."
Yes they will.  Look up what VAG owns.
not really.  no one wants that
"who cares lol, emissions standards in the US are over kill"
VW knows electric will be lower cost to manufacture in the VERY near term.  ICE is dead.
They have no choice. It's not like they can just keep building ICE cars.
Sounds win-win.
"No one cares about the cars being electric.  VWs consistently win all kinds of awards and are known for some of the best selling vehicles on the planet for a reason. Its the styling, fit, and finish that people care about.  what you put in it for power is irrelevant"
Gen Z cant afford a Tesla. They can afford a Jetta though
"Tesla currently does not have an entry in the tiny car space. In some parts of Europe where streets predate WW2, it's difficult to own anything bigger than a VW Golf because the space is just that tight. The Model 3 would be like a limousine in such areas. Of course not all of Europe is that bad, for example German roads can fit even a Model X, but obviously there is still a significant market for such tiny cars."
"Unless Tesla can build enough cars to fulfill demand, VW and all can get away with good enough."
"ID.4 looks like it will be compelling to many people.

Let's also not forget that Porsche is a VW company."
"Many people dont like the tesla interior, myself included. Create a similar EV with better interior and suddenly tesla numbers arent that hard to beat"
">I think they'll be hard pressed to create something as compelling as the Model 3, which basically checks all the boxes as far as economy, performance, price and brand cache.

This is 100% correct. But everyone's 'boxes' and list of importance for these boxes is different.

VW will check other just as important boxes for some that Tesla has failed to check for years now... while also checking some of the boxes (price, brand, etc) that Tesla currently checks.

This may mean the difference between purchasing and not for many.

Serviceability, for example, will be a box VW checks right out of the gate.  And there will be big groups of people who opt to take a VW with a lack luster long distance charging infrastructure if it means being able to bring their car down the road to any of a number of VW dealerships get worked on.

Competent, in person, Pre-owned sales as another example may mean the difference for many between purchasing a used Tesla or a used VW. Albeit, this is down the road, being able to go onto a lot, see, test, examine the car in person, and drive it home within a day is huge for many.

So while you're 100% right that it'll be very, very, difficult for VW to come into the game and check all of Tesla's boxes... it may be okay that they don't. There is likely still a large market of people who will see the benefit of VW's checked boxes enough to purchase a VW over a Tesla.

Regardless - this is all good for both brands long term. It'll pressure Tesla to figure their shit out with service and their used vehicle sales. It'll also pressure VW, and others, to  build out a charging infrastructure to support those who refuse to buy without one."
"the box for price is literally only checked if you have spare 50k sitting around to set on fire basically.

The vast majority of people buy MUCH cheaper cars and especially in the markets where VW is big they have cars you can buy for around 10k brand new.

Also you completely ignore the boxes tesla checks in terms of sticking to the american car company reputation which are bad quality, bad service and expensive repairs.<

Nobody wants american cars in Europe because of these things and tesla has yet to change any of them."
"So you are saying you haven't looked at the ID.3 specs?  Or the ID.4 design?  Because it seems like they have built a compelling platform.

Don't get me wrong, Tesla's level of tech, integration, and over the air updates makes them a solid leader, but not everybody is going to care.  They'll want the VW (or other companies) styling, the range just has to be good enough.

The charging network obviously is the big question, which depends on market."
"> If they build a car that's as good as the Model 3 but it only sells half as many units

They can also spread comparable sales over more models.   They need to cumulatively sell in Telsa-beating numbers, but it doesn't have to be concentrated in one model."
"I totally agree... But so many people are still skeptical about Tesla. Friends of mine constantly ask me how the service is and other topics like that where Tesla struggles. I live 3.5 hours from the closest service center and I'm upfront about that. I also tell them I've never had to take it in for anything, but it still bothers them. They're looking at a Chevy Bolt because they currently own a Chevy.

Brand loyalty is weird."
"If anyone can make a car that competes with Tesla, it will be VW. 

Downvote me, I know y’all don’t like hearing shit like this."
">	I think they'll be hard pressed to create something as compelling as the Model 3, which basically checks all the boxes as far as economy, performance, price and brand cache.

And safety!"
"I think the ID.4 is going to sell phenomenally well.

Just wish EA didnt charge its insane charging prices."
"I don't have a tesla. I'm just lurking until I can afford one. But I would love an electric Golf/GTI.

EDIT: I had no idea the VW ID3 existed. I'm off to research!"
Until there is network of chargers for other electric cars like the Tesla Supercharger network they will never even come close to touching Tesla.
With great software.
I really want the VW ID Buzz to actually be released.I'll probably be one of the first in line.
"> If they build a car that's as good as the Model 3 but it only sells half as many units, that doesn't help them that much. They not only need a compelling car, they need to be able to sell it in Tesla-beating numbers.

They have some time left to iterate still. They have to sell reasonably large numbers to avoid EU fines (and to keep market share of course), but it doesn't quite have to be a home run yet.

The only thing they really have to nail I think is quality assurance and support. If they have things breaking on new cars or high battery degradation (or even fires) it could really hurt the brand. So I'm curious how their MCUs, self driving sensors and batteries hold up, as those are the really new types of parts."
"I already feel kinda bad for people not all that internet savvy that are buying EVs from other companies.  They see us elegantly coming and going from Superchargers and Destination chargers.  We don't have to fidget with payment apps or RFID cards.  It's not uncommon to see an older driver with an e-Tron or Bolt or whatever trying to figure out how to plug in at a Supercharger.

Dealerships for the other brands aren't educating people.  Heck, so many employees at those dealerships don't know much.  And those other brands are hoping someone else takes care of the problem.

I think I'd like Tesla connectors to become a de facto standard if not *the* standard.  Nice, small connector, easy to use.  Other brands should step up and work with Tesla.  The hard work is already done!"
"It will no doubt take them the same 10 years to catch up if not more, considering the sheer speed that Tesla moved through this time surprised the best of critics & analysts.

They're well established so that's a benefit but the financial shape of the big 3/auto sector currently is bleak.

Not to mention, par the engineering costs, they'd also have to make an equivalent of the 12k+ strong Supercharger network, + having to get dealers on board to stock up expensive equipment & relevant parts+technicians to service/repair EVs.

I like to think that the reason for lack of innovation in the automotive sector pre-Tesla was not because they're greedy & were enjoying the unfettered ICE monopoly but because of a sincere lack of (projected) funds & uncertainty from a legal & adoption POV.

Where Tesla's entry excelled is at lowering those 'projected' development costs by showing that it can be done in reasonable fashion."
"No kidding.  Tesla model 3:

-Economy car, beating focus-class cars silly on running costs.

-Race car, beating base level McLaren and Ferrari class cars at 1/4 the price.

-Basic car, four doors, normal appearance, trunk.  Nothing compromised.

-Excitement, white minimalist interiors, glass roof, autopilot, feeling of being on the frontier.


What a combo.  It's a really compelling offering.  The bolt and id3 don't seem to care to look beyond the economy car idea and that's a hard sell with the added cost of batteries."
It's interesting how a 17 year-old company already has 10 years more experience than an 83 year-old company. Yet they think they can catch up quick :-)
"That and BMW makes shit cars in general, so, good luck BMW!"
"the vast majority of people dont give one single fuck about OTA updates.

the reason Tesla can not live without them is because they sold and advertised features that did not exist and were not even in alpha phase.

You know there are people who get into their car, turn on the FM radio and maybe setup their navigation system and just drive where they want to go.

If the car has done its own update over night or if something is updated when its in for maintenance doesnt matter the slightest, it will more be something keeping a big group of people away from Tesla because they want something that just works and doesnt require constant changes."
"As someone who got burned twice by the diesel scandal (both replaced with Teslas), fuck VW. I will never buy a car from them or any of their subsidiaries for as long as I live. I hope they never catch up. The diesel scandal was at least a part of what propelled them to the top of the market."
"You must be kidding, right?

Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes etc. are all getting the top engineers from german universities (RWTH, TUM, TU Dortmund...). Coupled with existing in-house knowledge, they have a pretty good chance to catch up to Tesla in a few years.

The world does not just revolve around the US. There are plenty of great universities outside of North America."
seems like you need to look up what they do because they have literally build a new platform to use only for EV´s so they wont run into that problem.
This is the reason for the ID.3 and ID.4
"you seem to have no understanding what you are talking about here.

VW is investing 60 billion into EVs till 2024 which is 44 times Teslas annual R&B Budget.

VW can almost pay the entire 60 billion just with their annual profit till 2024 but they will obviously just take out super cheap loans to take advantage of the capital they can get almost for free.

comparatively Tesla is TINY, people here talk about why anyone is still buying ICE´s and completely ignore that of the over 90 million cars sold annual in the world Tesla will not even have a single million in annual sales because they can not produce as much cars."
"I'm far from an industry inside, but rumor is ID3 has been plagued by software issues.. which is a big reason VW is now saying it plans to dump 30k on the market all at once. They have been sitting while the issues get fixed and updated."
I’m not saying they are not offering a compelling product either. What I’m saying is that the products simply are not equal in innovation and tech. In the same way early android phones had reasons why you might want to buy them over the iPhone but a truest competitor product took years.
but none of these beside the cars have any impact on VW or puts Tesla any more ahead of them.
"I agreed. No hardware company has ever successfully made the transition to software. Nokia, Motorola, Smith Corona, Blockbuster, Kodak, etc. High quality software development is a very different animal to run right. Traditional engineering approaches do not apply. As an example, legacy car makers have no idea why OTA updates are required in the EV products. What would happen if Apple could never update their phones or computer OSs after u bought it."
"Yes, but young people aren’t as keen on driving, and autonomy is coming to further shrink the fleet."
"Seems like more and more households go from two cars to one though, because of ridesharing and better collective transport"
"the market is shrinking for economic reasons any because people in cities dont need as many cars.

its not like this will change with EV´s"
"Much bigger, even when you factor in the western households going from 2-> 1 or zero vehicles owned by them. Ridesharing will be huge and the population boom globally, especially in emerging markets will all be going to EVs. Look up ARK Invest's research on this topic if you're interested."
Doubtful. Until EVs are the same price for similar performance (including range) it will not be a real option for a lot of people
"they are already building a charging network but instead of doing it on their own as a closed system they work together to build an open one.

so in the end you are limited if you have a Tesla unless you carry your CCS adapter with you to use the open chargers."
"Keep in mind though that the European and American markets work differently. Two of the EU's most popular laws (the omission of roaming fees when traveling to another European country and standardization of cellphone chargers) refer to unified standards. Proprietary designs are not super popular in Europe and many folks prefer having a common plug (CCS2 in this case) that now turns out to be even faster than Tesla's own superchargers.

Plus distances travelled by car are not nearly as long in Europe as they are in the US, thus a dense network of superchargers (or similar open setups to the same effect) are not as important. I do think it does not take long for VW to overtake Tesla in central Europe (Norway will probably take longer) given that an ID.3 will be roughly 15k cheaper than a Model 3 SR+.

As much as Tesla caters primarily to the US-American market, VW does to Europe, especially with the ID.3. The ID.4 though, that will be an exciting competition both in the US and Europe!

edit: the most remarkable thing about the ID.3 is in my opinion the [factual and working HUD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrRtaSGAU_A) that you can order..."
The electrify America network is made VW.
"I'm assuming ""Teslarati"" is just code for ""biased""."
"And...why would I prefer that?  Lol. I've owned a GTI. Great car. Completely different.  I'm old enough to enjoy the luxury of understanding cars fit niches. Teslas ""niche"" isnt just EV.  It's a phenomenal car on it's own.  I'd own my pefromance model 3 if it was gas...and performed the exact same way. 

BUT, I digress....its my opinion.  You have yours. Congrats"
What cars in that class have basic autopilot?
Lol wow
"Similar chaff articles keep coming out.
I suspect it’s to do with share floats.
I hope it doesn’t ruin Tesla’s reputation 
In the long run."
Yes...that’s what I said...Audi are slowing the production of the E-TRon because of limited battery supply. Tesla is building its own battery manufacturing plant. The supply of batteries worldwide is the problem.
"> I don't think Tesla's technology lead is guaranteed beyond the next 5-10 years.

If you're right, it may not matter by then. The Ford F150, for example, isn't a technological leader, but it's a sales leader. Tesla needs the tech lead today to establish itself. They are effectively the gold standard of EVs to which all others are compared. As long as they stay that way, even if they don't win *every* comparison, they will sell units."
So why didn't IBM just copy Apple and Microsoft?
Brand recognition sure as hell has a 10 year lead in the EV market.
"What VW cannot copy is the FSD that Tesla is about to unleash onto the world. The robotaxi market looks like it will be a winner-take-most kind of deal. VW doesnt even have any data to work from. Tesla already has billions of miles of data and is close to solving it. The world is not gonna wait for VW to start working towards that. Until VW has cought up in other ways, selling cars to people might not even be a thing. The only thing that will matter is who has the safest self-driving fleet and how vertically integrated they are so that they can cheaply produce and add taxis to their fleet."
"Batteries are going to break that $100 per kw very soon. Especially once economy of scale kicks in when big auto like VW starts up. 

It’s all about the battery manufacturing, all other features are just an add on. This is what will separate the winners and looser."
"Not sure how it is in the US, but in the EU that's just simply not true"
Love to see the model 2 fill that space.
"Yup I’ve just switched from an Audi A3 (posh VW Golf) to a Model 3, and its very noticeable how much bigger the car is

I’m in a medium sized town, so it’s not too big for the most part (I’m not in a city with tight roads, nor in the countryside with narrow lanes) so I’ll only have to deal with those things occasionally - and also, the UK is generally not as bad as the likes of Italy for tiny city streets - but it’s still noticeable

The perfect car for me would be a 20% shrunken model 3,  ideally a hatchback. A Model 2, if you will."
"...yes, exactly this, Europe mostly needs small cheap reliable. Volkswagen group can excel here."
"It’s a huge market across much of Europe, Asia and even some markets where space isn’t as much of an issue (you see a LOT of Golfs and other subcompacts driving around in places like Australia too)."
"As a European it is fun that you think a Golf is tiny. The Golf is like the perfect size car, the Fox, thats tiny, the Polo is small, the Golf is just right, the Passat is silly."
"Can confirm that. (Germany)

The Model 3 is quite a large car compared to the ""normal"" cars you drive around here. It doesn't even properly fit into my driveway! (It's too long)"
"The Golf has grown quite a bit over the years, to the point where there’s not really that much difference between one and a model 3."
">ID.4 looks like it will be compelling to many people.

Will it be better on the spec sheet than the Model Y? It will have to be, if you're asking people to lose the Tesla brand cache."
"This doesn't seem like a benefit, knowing about the rating of the taycan and having insight on some of the component manufacturing/development.
But VW has by now 3 e-car plattforms: the ID, the Taycan and the E-tron. The Audi seems like the most competitive of the bunch today. I think they will not completely catch up until maybe 2025-2030, but at least the main competititor against tesla from the old car brands."
"> Create a similar EV with better interior and suddenly tesla numbers arent that hard to beat

Let me know when somebody does... So far, every EV that gets released seems to fall short of established Tesla specs."
">Serviceability

That is a big one for me. Nearest Tesla service center is nearly 6 hours away from me. I'm not buying anything that I can't get serviced."
VW need a lot of service.  Especially as they age so I image VW buyers would value this.
"> Serviceability, for example, will be a box VW checks right out of the gate.

I don't know about this.  Sure, there will be a service location near you, but will they have the parts and training to work on your electric?  My understanding is that e.g. the Bolt has had major issues with this."
"The ID.3 looks like a toaster and doesn't offer anything that you can't get in a sexier package from Tesla. Also, it DC charges at 125 kw, which Tesla surpassed a year or more ago. And it's Europe-only so it'll be hard to guess what the global market would be for it.

The ID.4 looks better, by a lot. The downside is that it's not available and the Y is beating it to market.

All the VW entries I know of that don't bear a Porsche badge are almost as good as the Tesla vehicle they compete against. I think VW will sell them, but I don't think they'll outsell the current Tesla offerings because I don't think people will deliberately buy a slightly worse vehicle that doesn't have the Tesla badge/brand. 

VW will have to play a patience game. They'll lose money due to mediocre sales volume on their new and expensive architecture for a time, but if they stay with it, it'll end up making them money."
"Haven’t they already built a pile of ID.3s that are sitting in parking lots because the software sucks? Can’t say it inspires confidence. Did they really put their best on this?

Funny how ID.3 was the Tesla killer for so long, now every sentence about it also adds ID.4. VW still hopes this annoying EV stuff will just go away and they’re scrambling to fix years of inaction (apart from greenwashing) as that looks increasingly unlikely."
First to market is a powerful thing. If you are not first to market you typically need to be best to market which is hard when you are already 10 years behind.
">Downvote me, I know y’all don’t like hearing shit like this.

Downvoted you for this bait sentence."
[deleted]
"I think you're probably right, but I don't think the ID.3 is it and I'm not sure the ID.4 will be it, either. The real Tesla competitor will wear an Audi badge, I expect. By the time it's available with 300 miles of range we'll be four revisions deep on the Model 3 and it'll have 425 miles of range and 400 kw charging or something like that."
I wasn't aware VW cars had safety issues?  And they'll also benefit from being a BEV and having the low center of gravity.
"the comment is literally that they have 10 years more experience because they are in fact building these cars since 10 years.

obviously VW wont need 10 years to catch up as they have so much more money to throw at the problem and they are doing it.

VW´s EV investments till 2024 are 44 times Teslas annual R&D budget."
"You could not be more mistaken. Every single Tesla owner I know loves the fact that the car they bought is better than the day they bought it. In fact most updates have nothing to do with your sideways comment. Most are improved features, a new steaming provider (like spotify) or games and now Netflix, or how about advertising a car with a certain range or MPGe and constantly working to improve it. Go fly a kite and calm down."
"I agree that your statement is partially is true, but your point is not, and the majority of top teir talent for the time being still goes to the US, outside of perhaps a few areas. The only thing Mercedes has that is top tier is internal combustion. Their chances of catching up to Tesla is less than their chances of going bankrupt. German Auto industry is in serious shit right now. Mercedes and VW are looking the best for the time being but not great, and BMW is looking like it might not survive, but don't take my word for it. Plenty of articles on how German Auto is in serious trouble right now, including a TV documentary out of Germany itself.

Also my comment wasn't made up, there is literally a survey about this from engineering students. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/06/the-10-most-attractive-employers-for-engineering-students.html

If you are so sure Mercedes will catch up, pit your money where your mouth is. I wouldn't touch any automotive stock with a 10' pole outside of Tesla right now, and I am pretty much obsessed with digging into the weeds in every detail of Tesla engineering and manufacturing, and software development. Mercedes is nowhere near Tesla. At best they are 8 years behind in core competency, and worst, well, irrelevant."
"Its not just the tech though. VW didnt build good software to go with their new platform. Tesla shines when it comes to software, and having driven quite a few of the 'competitors', I can attest to the fact that no one has been investing in that aspect of their vehicles."
Ok
"Yes, I've heard they had software issues as well, at least the official launch isn't until the summer.  Let's see how well they do in resolving this."
"The launch isn't until summer.

And putting out 30k all at once during launch isn't unheard of.

Because that's how you keep scalpers away. Plus you were already able to preorder the ID.3 1st edition."
Means VW has lousy or no OTA. OTA requires design integration from day 1. Part vendors have to be given internal communications requirements before they start designing the part.
Vehicle autonomy will have a major impact on VW.  It may put them out of business.
It doesn't matter. Tesla will be the king of autonomous robotaxis and they will be able to produce robotaxis at a vastly lower cost than anyone else.
"Yes, and since Tesla will be king of autonomous robotaxis this is what they want."
This doesn't matter. It's part of Tesla's plan. Tesla will.be the king of robotaxis.
Preaching to the choir mate ! Ark analysts are pretty much the only ones I pay any attention to.
ride sharing would actually reduce the number of cars needed in total.
Do you realize how close Tesla is to crossing that point? You speak as if it is some kind of science fiction kind of thing. In a couple of years this will be done.
"EVs range is increasing and cost is coming down, most people who are buying new cars will likely be in the position to buy one in the next few years.  The larger issue will be charging infrastructure as not everyone will have charging available at home.

There are government incentives in some countries for building charging infrastructure (whether commercial or residential) but many of the incentives for public/commercial chargers are for CCS/Chademo, not Tesla, so that will be interesting..."
"Well yes, but involuntarily as part of the settlement regarding emissiongate."
"You have a funny way to spell ""trash"""
"Basic auto pilot is ACC and lane assist, that cna be had in any Passat or A4 sized car, even the golf has it as an optional package with other assist systems"
"And people say that Apple is the innovation leader, yet they have less than 20% of the market and print their own money."
"I agree once the EV market matures I don't think technology will have much of an impact on sales, except on the very high end of the market (similar to ICEs now). Eventually battery and electric motor technology will plateau and the differences between brands will get smaller and smaller. It will turn into a competition on reliability, styling, features and branding rather than range and efficiency."
"Because self-disruption is very difficult:

[https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/12/understanding-the-innovators-dilemma/](https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/12/understanding-the-innovators-dilemma/)"
"You could just as easily argue VW, BMW, Ford, etc have decades more brand recognition than Tesla. I don't think they will have any trouble selling EVs once they start putting out competitive models."
"Regardless of dieselgate [VW sales revenue has steadily climbed](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264349/sales-revenue-of-volkswagen-ag-since-2006/), I don't think they have a branding problem.  Many people are looking forward to the ID.3, the ID.4 looks great, their flexible platform should work well for them.  They don't have to beat Tesla tech/integration wise to do well."
Tesla FSD and robotaxis are nowhere even near being released. There is no proof whatsoever that Tesla is close to solving it.
no one even wants full self driving though
So: 2 S E X Y C A R S?
"Agreed, get the MSRP down under $30k. Reuse most of the interior components from the 3/Y. I don't know the overlap with between the 3 and the Y, but I could see them creating a 2 door shorter wheelbase model, maybe target 200 mile range with the base model. 

There's a lot of backseat room in the 3, you could cut the rear doors out, make more of a hatch and maybe even be able to keep the design almost the same from the doors forward."
"I am curious to see how Tesla continues the name scheme. So far we have letters and numbers, maybe next there will be special characters, a Model @ for example."
I don’t think there’s anyway he can go back on the proclamation he made at the Shanghai presser about the next design being a compact.
"I said this elsewhere, but I think Tesla could keep the Model 3 from the front doors forward, strip out some of the rear legroom, remove the rear doors and do a hatch. I don't know how much of a reduction in cost that would be, but reduce the range a bit and get it under the $30k USD and it could be huge.

That's a damn good lineup. Small hatch, mid-size sedan and crossover, larger sedan and crossover."
"I'm here to dispute the claim the A3 is a posh Golf. The A3 is simply for angry low to mid tier business people who cant indicate, enjoy riding peoples ass too close on the M4, and that get it as a company car. But the car itself is actually no better than a Golf. 

If you buy one yourself then fair enough but you'll still look like you're in that category :) 

Nice choice on the 3 though!!"
Volkswagen Is that
"I'm really curious to see what Tesla's new Chinese design center comes up with.

Building a ""small, practical, but still cool"" car is really hard, and German manufacturers have nailed it pretty well. I worry American designers would not be able to resist the urge to make it be cute and smol instead of cool, which is fine but limits your customer base and ASP substantially."
easier to park. Every saturday i see this woman despratly in an pickup trying to park at the jumbo while my compact car fits in all the spots.
"There are people brand loyal to VW. Additionally, they might see the full US federal tax credit and see dollar signs. It'll depend on how they end up pricing it. The aim is probably not to convert Tesla owners."
the people who are in the market for an ID4 priced and sized car dont give one single fuck about a brand especially if its Tesla which reputation for bad service and quality VS VW with the exact opposite in Europe.
Many people are excited about the Mach-e too. Although the launch event was painful to watch.
"I mean the model 3 is top dog in the price range for sure. But having sat in one for a few hours this week it really doesn’t feel premium. Even my skoda kodiaq has a much higher quality feel (ok I chose it over the Tiguan because of the interior), the doors close without being slammed, tire noise is lower etc. the difference between my father’s I-Pace in interior quality and the model 3 is immense but so is the price difference. Still, the model 3 is closer in interior quality and feel to a lower end skoda (octavia) than a luxury car. 

I really want to get a Y in about two years but the interior quality of the 3 has me wondering if I want to pay 60-70k for it. Maybe Volkswagen will deliver a better feeling car for the money. Maybe the Y is better?

I think the advantage Tesla has in being a better electric car is pretty small now. The updates and software are nice for sure and maybe the main thing I like about them. I’m not sure it’s enough to make it the obvious choice much longer. 

I really would like a Tesla but the 3 isn’t all that it’s made out to be."
">It is a motivator for us. Tesla has 10 years more experience. But we are very quick in catching up.

>So far, every EV that gets released seems to fall short of established Tesla specs. 

🤷🏻‍♂️"
"Polestar 2 is right up there, Volvo standards in great packaging. Ventilated seats, heated stearing wheel, capable of towing 1500kg etc."
"Or matches the specs but far exceeds in price.

The closest Model 3 competitor is likely going to be the BMW i4, and it's going to have a mostly traditional interior. But they haven't released pricing on it yet, and my guess right now is that it's going to cost about $10k more than the equivalent ICE-powered BMW."
"Yup. Every VW service experience I've ever had, in multiple states across many years has been at least a B grade or better in my book. Even when a mistake was made it was corrected - I think that's all you can hope for. Tesla has a lot to learn about service experience for the customer facing side - but I have a lot of faith in them."
"I'm a bit confused though, there's really not all that much in a Tesla that needs to get serviced, no? Can't they just send a van to service it in your driveway?

And if it's something important enough that they can't service on the spot, wouldn't they give you a loaner car for free while they tow your Tesla, fix it, and get it back to you?

Never really owned a car, but I'm saving up for a Tesla model 3 at some point, so I'd really like to hear these kinds of details."
"EVs have such a low part count that Tesla has made service van's viable and numerous. They talk to u and your car. Find out where u are and come service your Tesla. Service centers are only needed for bigger issues. If u live far, Tesla drops a loaner car and take yours to the service center on a flat bed tow truck. Nothing better than that."
Your understanding is VW makes the Bolt?
"ID3 has looks that are more appealing in Europe, where it is being sold. Sedans are sort of seem as old man cars (regardless of merit) in Europe. The model 3 is also a rather long vehicle, which is a bad thing on old European roads. ID3 is also cheaper than model 3, so it’s not a surprise the model 3 is better on many metrics.

In US the ID4 will have 7,500 rebate while the model Y will have 0 rebate. I think this policy is stupid for what it’s worth, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s the policy.

Currently ~95% of people that can charge at home buy something that isn’t a BEV. Remember that. There’s a big market to fill."
">The ID.3 looks like a toaster 

Ha ha ha, that's absurd. I don't expect anyone here to like VW styling or even care about them as a company, but VW has [no problem selling cars](https://www.statista.com/statistics/461115/most-popular-models-of-volkswagen-group-by-worldwide-delivery/).  125kW is fine for fast charging, especially if the majority of charging is overnight/or destination/urban chargers.  And given the global automotive market of 80 million vehicles, with Tesla maybe producing 600K this year, there is a lot of room in the market."
"Let's also not forget that while these products will be worse than Tesla's in many ways, VW will have to sell them at a much smaller profit margin as well, since they lack Tesla's vertical integration and battery density."
">  Did they really put their best on this?

**YES**. I have read reports that VW has over 10,000 technicians from Porsche, Audi, and VW and other brands they own all working on id.3 software problems. VW is basically a huge car empire that owns the most brands in the world and they are using their resources to the fullest to get this thing out the door in good shape.

 This is a top priority for them because they do not want tesla to get an entry into europe at any cost. The VW ceo has already spread worry about tesla in the past. They do not take them lightly.

They will put out a good car as a result of this."
"Everyone needs to give up on this ""tesla killer or nothing"" mentality.  Most people just want competent cars and they like the look of.  And with Tesla making 600K cars this year, there are still 70-80 million other ICE car sales to displace; VW will be fine.  

Software issues happen, it's the first year of a new car, they'll fix it and move forward.  Just like Tesla worked through their issues and have moved forward."
"> VW still hopes this annoying EV stuff will just go away

No they're not hoping for that, as the EU commission will start imposing huge penalties (hundreds of millions of euros) if they or other car makers miss their [CO2 targets](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/vehicles/cars_en). VW is all in, investing billions in new factories, [including for batteries](https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-group-starts-battery-cell-development-and-production-in-salzgitter-5381) (years too late but now they've no choice with the prospect of huge fines around the corner)."
"That isn't even remotely true, not in a market as large as the global automotive market.  Being 2nd or 3rd serious EV to market might actually be an advantage because you don't have to prove to consumers nor investors that EVs can be capable cars, Tesla has already done all the hard work.

Android wasn't first to market and arguably wasn't the best either (although I'm not looking to get into that debate either), and it's doing just fine.  And this is just their first serious from the ground up BEV, it's pretty good, and there's no solid basis to suggest they are incapable of improving on it."
Let me know when the next cult meeting is :P
How are you about to take notice and tell me no one cares lol
"The e-Tron is already stealing a huge number of sales from the Model X in Europe (Model X sales fell 35% there last year, and the e-Tron outsold it 19k to less than 8k).  The e-Tron GT will take some sales from the higher trim Model 3s.  But Audi isn't going to price anything low enough to go after the SR+, which is what the ID.3 and ID.4 will do."
"I am not calling out VW, just adding that Tesla’s have been tested and the results have been the lowest probability of injury for any car produced."
You sound like you seriously believe that?
Id.3 had a limited launch that was supposed to start reaching customers in march. That had been delayed.
"That's a great point and definitely seems that way. 

On a personal level, I'm not entirely convinced OTA updates are for me.. so that might have actually been a strategic choice from VW."
vehicle autonomy is a gimmick no different than 3d movies.
"so far they are yet to be able to drive without human intervention even in good conditions.

Tesla is easily a decade away from reaching level 5 autonomy while waymo is already testing the technology for years."
True and VW will get us there with a polo sized EV
I am excited for that day but until it happens it's just not a reality for a lot of people
"Again you are talking about probablties and futures. I responded to the comment that the EV market is bigger than ice market. The reality is its just not. It is growing, it will get there but right now its just not. There is nothing wrong with that. I'm sorry you people are so tied to this belief that you can't admit to the reality of the current market"
"Oh, right.  The Passat or A4 are the same class as something smaller than that?

And you want AP1 there by default where it's optional in others?"
"Right, and if Tesla can establish itself as the iPhone to everybody else's Android, they won't have to be #1 in sales to still make billions of dollars even as the differences between Tesla and Brand X become smaller over time."
Makes sense I guess it was easier for Apple to self disrupt since they had a very small market share of PC's. Very little to loose and much to gain. It seems so incredibly rare to see companies self disrupt.

etron gt
It doesn't matter. What matters is that they are way ahead of the competition. Once we get there things will change drastically and very rapidly. Tesla has been planting seeds for years now and soon the time for harvesting will come.
I know I do and I know lots of people who do as well. So your blanket statement is already rendered false.
"I like it. Eventually, there can be a model 4 and model U. So,
### 2 S 3 X Y C A R S 4 U

Maybe a Right Said Fred ref somewhere?"
"If Tesla comes out with a hatchback it could potentially cut into VW's ID3 market.

But the sheer market share VW has in Europe is hard for any manufacturer to beat, let alone Tesla. Volkswagen AG is THE european standard when it comes to car manufacturing. Everything from Bugatti's to small Micro cars."
"Or an incremental update to the Model 3, the Model π."
Model 🏎️
"The Model 3 is still wide. That's a significant part of the size ""problem."""
"I was thinking 5-door hatch - which could be done just by splitting the top-rear window in half and swapping the trunk for a hatch.

Do that, then stick the blueprints in the photocopier and set it to 80%"
Problem with this redesign is the battery is housed under the rear seat bench. You'd need to find a new space to place it.
"The interior is absolutely better than a Golf. If you spend a lot of time in the car it’s a nicer place to be for long journeys or when you’re in the car for hundreds of miles day in, day out

As for the rest, that’s just weird generalization."
"Not in Asia it doesn't. Hell that might boom hugely in Japan.

Doesn't help Tesla in Europe, but if it gets big in Asia I don't see why people in Europe wouldn't be willing to give it a shot too."
In Europe if the ID4 is priced as excepted (I.E €40K) it wil' be around 20K cheaper than a LR MY. Even the SR should be at least ~8K more expensive
"So wait, you think it is easier for other car companies to catch up in electronics,software, and batteries for the price of 35,000-40,000$ per car easily, but you don't think tesla can rework the look of the interior if it turns out to be extremely important? Which from what i have seen is the easiest thing to do for a car and hasn't hampered them in any way so far and a few are even in the industry copying tesla's big ipad-like screen and minimalism.

Anyway, I would say that tesla still has a good lead in the ev space. They have to be number one in consumer report customer satisfaction *for some reason*.

>I really want to get a Y in about two years  but the interior quality of the 3 has me wondering if I want to pay 60-70k for it. 

The Y will be cheaper than 60k usd. If it is not in your area then I would definitely go for something a little cheaper."

"Ehhh... I wouldn't be so sure.  My 2015 Golf GTE had a hybrid battery pack fault.  It took VW eight weeks to fix my car.  In between that, I had no car for a week (while they figured out whether this was actually a warranty issue), then a 2017 Tiguan (eww) and then a 2018 GTE on loan (okay, wasn't going to complain about that one.)  They had to fly someone out from Germany in the end to diagnose my car.  They'll need to seriously get on the ball regarding EV servicing if they want to catch up - one thing Tesla does seem to have over the other EV manufacturers is well trained techs *if* you can get your car booked in."
"Sadly, they're not going to send a van to replace an axle or a torsion bar. Potholes happen. So do accidents. Six hours is a long way to get your car hauled for repair (especially for out of warranty or non-insured work). It's also a long way to travel just to be told ""oh, sorry, that ""pick up your car"" notice was sent by mistake. It'll be ready next week"". That kind of thing happens from every car company. I can tell you horror stories about Kia, and they're much the same as the horror stories people post about Tesla. The difference being, I'd have to drive six hours every time I wanted to experience a horror story at a Tesla Service Center, while I have to drive 30 minutes to get shit service at my local Kia dealership.

Mobile service is great, but it's only useful for relatively minor problems. (Frankly, most of the things people on this sub call mobile service in for are things that I'd just ignore in a car, or fix myself with a tribble and some chewing gum. You can *really* feel the ""rich entitled prick"" vibe on this sub sometimes lol.)

I don't really require *good* service from Tesla, because I'm not use to receiving that from any car company. What I require is minimal inconvenience. Six hours to drive to a service center if I get into a fender-bender - compared to 30 minutes - doesn't qualify as minimal."
"No, my understanding is that even though traditional manufacturers have a lot more service infrastructure than Tesla does, that those service centers are spotty in how capable they are of dealing with electric vehicles.  It takes extensive training, new tools, and new parts to deal with new car models, so just because there are a lot of VW service centers doesn't mean their electric car service support will be stellar on day one."
"> ID3 has looks that are more appealing in Europe, where it is being sold. 

For american roads it looks incredibly unappealing. Glad they got a id.4 version coming along that looks much better."
There's a side-by-side comparison of the Model 3 and the ID.3 online. They're almost the same length. The ID.3 is taller and slightly shorter than the 3. The 3 is a bit longer and sits lower.
"Well, we'll see how the ID.3 does when it hits the market and the get the software figured out. I think the reason it's EU only is because that's the only place it could possibly make a significant dent."
"I'm the biggest Tesla fan as well, but do you have a source for any of this?

NMC811 chemistry is available at 300wh/kg in an ID.3 compatible pouch format (or 270wh/kg in prismatic also ID.3 compatible) from CATL at the very least.  Tesla's 2170 NCA cells are estimated around 250wh/kg I believe.  We are all waiting on the details for Tesla's (potential) new cells, but last I heard Maxwell cells were demonstrated at 300wh/kg around when Tesla acquired them, so not much different (yet).

But it's the overall pack energy density (and end cost) that's more interesting, and while I believe Tesla has the lead there (with no sources), until we get a tear down on the ID.3 there's not much to debate.  And most consumers won't care ~~if~~  *as long as* the car is competent.

And what source do you have for them selling these at a lower profit margin? Firstly VW has significantly higher car production overall so can be still be more profitable with tighter margins, but the ID.3 doesn't have shipping or import fees unlike the Model 3, so they make up for potential cost differences in other manner.  \[And in the US market, the ID.4 will still quality for the full tax subsidy, unlike the Model Y\]"
But in the US that will be more than offset by VW still being able to rely on the 7500 federal tax credit that Tesla no longer has
"you really thing vertical integration is such an advantage in the long rung?

there is a good reason why just about every major company has moved away from this and instead order from specialized companies and can choose whatever fits their needs.

Vertical integration is also extremely expensive to get started which is why Tesla is also ordering a huge amount of parts from existing companies."
I feel like the earliest engineers weren’t their best as it was a lower priority project. If that’s true it could be very tough to fix - sometimes throwing bodies at something doesn’t help if it’s fundamentally flawed. I guess we’ll see.
"Like it or not that’s the phrase the media used for years. 

What people really need to give up on is giving VW a pass on all their BS. They’ve proven to be one of the most cynical, deceptive global businesses we’ve ever seen but their marketing budget means they now get very little criticism despite a whole lot of mediocre EV progress on the back of years of empty promises and greenwashing. 

Software issues happen, sure. But critical, stop-sale issues happening when you’ve spent years/decades designing a car and actually manufactured it, and sold some, and trumpeted it as the best EV ever? I think some criticism is VERY well deserved. They should be massively embarrassed by the global media and get their sh&$ together but no, mostly pretty silent apart from niche press. 

We all know if the Tesla 3 had failed as hard as the ID.3 launch, the company would have gone under and the global press would have ripped the company and Elon to pieces with glee. The double standards in the biased press are disgusting."
Very true we have good examples of second mover advantage but I would argue they all presented a superior product. Facebook and Google search are good examples.
"I agree, it's a huge market. But the opportunity window is short, premium EVs are attracting the most profitable customers from the establishment and the kind of heavy lifting VW concern is doing here is pretty expensive.

Unless you are huge and profitable its going to be tempting to wait another year. Hello Nokia."

">The e-Tron is already stealing a huge number of sales from the Model X in Europe

Isn't is pretty normal that the latest new design steals sales from designs that have been around for a few years?  That seems to be true of all cars, even BMW v. Audi in the EU. The Model X really isn't a great car for the European market and it wouldn't surprise me that its sales numbers are the most tenuous over there."
"I can't argue with that, but I'm curious how much that sways a buyer if the competitors are also pretty good.  \[Of course we all love the bragging right that many of the Tesla features bring, but how does that actually translate in the broader market.\]"
"there is nothing to believe about it as you can see it happen and can run the numbers by yourself.

Tesla is TINY compared to the established companies they have yet to produce as much cars annually as VW does in two weeks."
"As a software/hardware engineer, that is what most people do not understand. OTA is required for software. As an example, think of a smart phone, pad or computer where you have to take it into a service center to get software updates. Software by nature is impossible to get perfect. There are 15 software engineers for ever hardware engineer in products to express its complexity. If VW had OTA, they could sell the ID3 with later updates if it had OTA instead of holding them back."
"Lies lies lies. The is a huge number of videos of people not intervening at all for really long amounts of time while driving through multiple types of streets.

Waymo needs to Geomap every area they wanna operate in and have a huge overhead of cost that will be their detriment. They also are really far behind in AI and data.

You'll see what happens in 2-3 years mate. That's all I'll say."
"It's not a reality for anyone, not just for a lot of people. The cost of batteries is a fact not dependent on the person. But the battery cost decline and battery density rise curves are real and they show what will happen. Not even taking into account the alien tech Tesla will announce on battery day, the day is really close mate."
"You are confused, I'm not the original person you were responding to.  And my response was simply speaking to the obvious direction of  the market \[as vehicle costs and cell costs are dropping steadily, and sales are increasing\].

And while I agree with you that it's absurd to say the EV market is ultimately bigger or smaller than the ICE market, and that the ICE market will be somewhat healthy for at least a few years, the EV market certainly will see significant growth in the coming years at the expense of ICE and that will only accelerate.

But if you bothered to actually read my response, the accessibility of the charging infrastructure and/or home charging is still a significant question for mass EV adoption."
"These were just some examples, same stuff is available for an A3, golf, corolla.
You can even get ACC in a car as small as a vw up but obviously only as an option there."
for that to happen they need to change drastically as there is already the iphone of EV´s and its the Taycan which offers endless customization which superior quality at the cost of slightly lower range which doesnt matter for a vehicle of its class and price range.
"Apple is an outlier in both their ability and willingness to self-disrupt. Think of all the times they've introduced a new product that openly cannibalized (or at least impacted) their own market-leading product— iPod Mini -> Nano, iPhone -> iPod Touch, MacBook -> iPad. But this is extremely atypical; most companies want to fully ride out the success of the current generation of product before launching the next thing, which is of course what creates the window of opportunity for an outside competitor.

I mean, we see it right here in this industry. Legacy automakers have billions invested in ICE vehicle research & expertise, supply chains, in-market support, etc. It's taken *ten years* for them to stomach that yes, they are going to need to walk away from that, and the longer they wait to do it, the more of their lunch will be eaten by Tesla."
Very few people buy the same brand over and over.  Perhaps in the truck market but nowhere else.
Attractive car

"Customers are upset at Volkswagen's Dieslgate though, so if you can offer them a cheap reliable and small electric car that can do everything you need it to do, for a similar price, why shouldn't people jump into the new Tesla cars?"
Aaaand we've come full circle.
"And model Y is even wider, I was thinking of buying one until the measurement and carrying ability figures came out. :("
I think they called that one the Model Y ;)
"Yes, most jibes towards Audi and BMW drivers are indeed generalisations."
You mean priced like VW is advertising right now.
I never said anything about catching up. It can go either way. Im just saying Tesla isn’t the leader in every aspect and that means a lot of people will choose VW for example. Your average person doesn’t necessarily care much about the software or batterie as long as it works and has the range needed. Many prefer actual buttons because that’s what they’re used to.
"Yeah I probably could have worded that better. Like, I mean it has a bunch of buttons, versus Tesla being all through a screen."
"Yeah my experience is only with VW of America’s, I guess."

Haven't been here long enough, but certainly sounds like a fun place to stick around and see for myself!

>Six hours to drive to a service center if I get into a fender-bender - compared to 30 minutes - doesn't qualify as minimal.

Fair enough.

I'm curious to see how Tesla is actually going to solve that, they're killing the standard auto dealer model, but the standard auto dealer model also has the advantage of putting service repair centres everywhere on the map. What is Tesla going to do to get equivalent service?"
"I agree, an EV service tech has more of a computer background than mechanics. Computer techs demand much higher pay because subject requires much more schooling."
">There's a side-by-side comparison of the Model 3 and the ID.3 online.

Bullshit. The ID.3 ist 4.26 m long, the Model 3 is 4.70 m long, so the Model 3 is over 1 foot longer."
"the reason why its Europe only for now is because the European market is almost 50% bigger than the US and small cars sell much better in Europe.

If they wanted to sell in the US they would need to build a giant car which they currently dont want to."
"Another reason for the limited release likely has to do with how many cells they could secure, and having a limited release for the first year of production seems prudent just to work out the production (and product) bugs of a first generation of an entirely new platform.  

\[Although the ID4 seems like it's a fast follow (2020/2021?) and a good choice to bring to the US market first as it will be much more competitive to the Model Y both in design and due to the rebate\]"
"Although I love Tesla I am only talking on a fact basis here, not as a fan. What really matters is the combination of density and efficiency of energy utilization. Tesla has demonstrated that they can utilize energy in a vastly more efficient manner than anything else out there, even before releasing their new power train, which to quote Musk ""people will think is alien technology"". I have learned to not doubt Musk's words."
"I beg to differ, but sure."
Yes. It is a huge advantage. ICE manufacturers actually have a huuuge problem with the fact that they have locked themselves into these thousands of relationships with suppliers.
"The media likes its dramatic titles but who cares, it's about car sales at the end of the day and whether they end up offering a compelling product that meets the needs of the masses.

Decades designing a car?  Your hyperbole is a bit much... yeah, VW was terrible about dieselgate, but if you look at their car sales nobody really cared that much. , and while I agree they should have faced great repercussions, that's hardly what we are talking about here.

The Model 3 did struggle hard on it's launch, you seriously don't remember the struggles getting production ramping up, and people complaining about body issues.  The global press did harshly criticize Tesla and Elon and the company was on the verge of failure.

But VW also faced a tonne of harsh media through dieselgate as well, and most people have just moved on.  You just have a very short memory."
Who hurt u?
We can find examples of both.  Where market leading advantage could be most interesting is if Tesla's next generation of cells (and pack design) is a significant leap forward in density or cost.
Why you acting you so petty lol
"Yes, that is true.  Given the Model X hasn't really been refreshed makes the issue even worse for Tesla.  With that said, lost sales are lost sales regardless of the reason."
It seems that you believe innovation = throw money at it.
"It's like people never heard of ""economy of scales."""

Battery day. had to google that one. Interesting another Tesla announcement. I stopped carrying about Tesla announcements as it seems they are never able to keep the schedule in announcements.

Again I do not depute that they are ahead of all manufactures in terms of their technology but they are not bigger and the EV market is not bigger than ICE manufactures. Don't know why its such a problem to admit that but whatever keep on doing what your doing bud"
"Hey dummy. You said "" most people who are buying new cars will likely be in the position to buy one in the next few years""

So I stand by my probabilities and futures comment. And I addresses the fact that I wasn't responding directly to you.

Have you heard about BMW?
German car fans are extremely loyal
"Because:
1) They use vision, which is the correct way to do it, and vastly cheaper than LIDAR
2) They have an enormous and exponentially growing data lead. They have many billions of miles of data, while Waymo has a couple of million miles and than lead as I said is growing faster and faster as Tesla puts more cars on the road, not shrinking.
3) LIDAR requires geomapping every single area where Waymo wants it to operate. Waymo will never be able to do what Tesla will be able to do. As soon as Tesla reaches level 5 they will be able to operate their robotaxis virtually anywhere without Geomapping
4) A huge part of Tesla's ingenious business model is built around the fact that they make profit from selling the device that needs to be driven in order for them to do their R&D. They are actually making profit off of people buying their product and driving it for them in order to provide them with data. Waymo needs to pay people to drive the cars for them.

I could go on, but..."
"Harvard: ""dude you want a scholarship""."
This is genuinely amazing.

"The sales figures don't reflect that. sales in the US, EU and China have surpassed what they were prior to the emissions scandal.

The ID3 is set to go on sale this year. Being built in Europe with good sales and after sales support from an established brand.

Tesla's are great cars but they're largely still unknowns in Europe and are already being outsold by other EV's.

Even in the US, Tesla sales are down from the previous year."
"That is the hatch but it’s a larger (well, taller) version of the 3, not a smaller version. It’s still a bit long and wide to be ideal for UK roads"
"Okay, so you came here to generalize me based on my ownership of a car. Feel free to piss off anytime you like..."
"They're making deals with local auto body shops for some of it, and expanding the service center network for the rest. That's long, arduous work for them though. It'll take a while to get good coverage. It hasn't reached me yet, and I won't consider a Tesla until it does."
"So, basically A VW Golf vs a VW Jetta in comparison?"
"Well, I just gave you facts about the battery tech out there.  You didn't mention drive train efficiency, and while some competitors are unquestionably terrible, the estimates I've seen for ID.3 are fine (ID3 16.4kWh/100km vs Model3 15.1 kWh/100km, pulling both numbers from [https://ev-database.org/](https://ev-database.org/) for a hope for consistency)

And their new powertrain is for the Model S and Model X.  It might be more performance for the same efficiency with a larger pack giving the added range.  Until we see it, and know how they plan on applying it across their product lines, it's really hard to evaluate it fairly."
One of the disadvantages is when you hit a bump in the economy you are stuck with the extra capacity throughout the entire supply chain.
"they are not locked into anything if they dont want to, they can order from who ever they want.

The thing is they obviously try to co develop with suppliers that have proven to be reliable but there is nothing forcing them to do so.

Anyways your post history makes it clear you are just pushing a narrative without providing any facts, its just pro Tesla no matter where and how so no benefit replying any further here."
"Not to detract from the points you've made but they did face severe repercussions - a fine of nearly 3 billion dollars just in the US, plus the costs to buy back all the cars exceeded what (I think) almost any other car company has ever been fined for. Even Boeing likely will not face fines that large for the MAX (though their financial losses in general will likely be ten times worse)

As you said, the VW brands have a high degree of loyalty, and to top it off they produce some of the best or at least most iconic cars in the world (GTI, GLI, Jetta, Audi R8, Porsche 911, etc). So their sales did not suffer so much. But don't think that VW fans (myself included) don't acknowledge or recognize that dieselgate was _fucked up_ - though I will argue to the death that GM should have faced a lot worse for the ignition switch debacle."
F
"That is one thing Tesla hasn't really addressed, yet. Other car companies do a minor refresh in year 2 - 3 and a redesign in year 4 - 6 of a given model. 

Tesla makes small improvements often, but they have not yet done the full redesign that consumers expect to have happened by now. You could argue that they're too busy launching new products, but the more products they have in the pipeline, the worse it gets. By the time they finally redo the Model S, it'll be past time to do the Model X and about time to do the Model 3."
"If you think Volkswagen is full of incompetent engineers, you are probably mistaken. Sure, the ID.3 had a rough start, but Diess is obviously as determined as no other manager with the legacy carmakers to make this work. In the upcoming years, VW will pump out 28 different models on the MEB plattform and build it on three different continents. I guess Tesla's leading edge will shrink in half a decade to a significant degree. But as many others point out, it is the ICE cars that are the enemy, not other EV manufacturers."
"Tesla historically has already achieved the amazing things they promise. Whether they achieve it a few months later matters not.

You are not grasping what we mean when we talk about the size of the EV market. The size of the EV market is the entire transportation market since every car and truck on the road will eventually be replaced by EVs."
"Growth in the EV market has more potential than growth in the ICE market, that's not that hard to understand given how small the EV market currently is and how mature the existing ICE market is, especially given every year the number of options increase (depending what market you are in).

I personally know a lot of people seriously considering EVs who are not particularly affluent, and the incentives available help make these cars more accessible.  You don't need the majority to be in the position to buy EVs for their to be strong growth in the market.  And not everybody is looking at Tesla's either.

And the near future is relevant.  VW group is planning on bringing 27 models to market by 2022 based on the platform of the ID3, which might be ambitious, but if you think talking about new car buyers is somehow limited to today only and not purchases within ""the next couple of years"", then I think you are taking a very limited viewpoint on the industry.

And I stand by my position that the charging infrastructure and people's familiarity with charging is the bigger impediment, as there really isn't a range issue with current models for the majority of most people's driving habits \[Although if you are in a colder climate, or tend to do numerous longer weekend trips, the step up to 300 miles range will be a definite improvement in usability\]"
"so for you its an advantage to have a system that stops working if there is any dirt on one of the cameras and doesnt even offer simple features like detecting crossing traffic when reversing?

you know, like other cars already do since years even without any FSD."
"We don’t yet have an answer to the vision vs lidar question.  We know that vision is much more affordable now, but Lidar can see more. After that it’s a race: one company betting that vision is enough since people only have vision, while others like that lidar can see more and they will soon be able to i crorporate it affordably. We don’t know who will win this rCe"
"You say they are doing it best, yet they are nowhere near FSD. So how do you actually know they're doing it best?

You're just guessing."
">The sales figures don't reflect that. sales in the US, EU and China have surpassed what they were prior to the emissions scandal.

Dieselgate also kind of revealed that most car manufacturers do this. It just so happens that VW got caught. If they're all equally guilty, what is the point in changing?

>Tesla's are great cars but they're largely still unknowns in Europe and are already being outsold by other EV's.

That's fair. At least though other companies are racing to get their EV's out there, even if it's only to deny Tesla entry into the European market, at least the entire planet will be better off for it.

Shame it took market competition to get there, as opposed to you know, caring about the planet we live on, but hey.

>Even in the US, Tesla sales are down from the previous year.

What data are you looking at? I don't know where exactly to go looking to confirm or deny, but it seems to me that Tesla sold massively more model 3's in 2019 than 2018, so I don't know what you mean by sales being down. 

If you're talking about 2020, well, the year has been a shit-show so far and we're only 3 months in, so that's kind of to be expected."
"Fair enough. I imagine Teslas were mostly aimed at major urban centers first, and that they would progressively expand out into the less urban areas over time. They certainly are nice, but they're not ideal for everyone.

Take care!"
A Jetta IS the sedan version of a Golf.
"Estimates are different than proven track records which Tesla has. If VW surprises me and proves to be a worthy competitor of course, it will be great. It will help Tesla improve even faster and it will help the move to en electric clean future."
"Ok man. Go ahead and thing whatever you want. I always speak with arguments. The fact that you choose to disregard whichever arguments do not suit you is clear.

You somehow seem to think that them being able to order parts from different suppliers is an advantage. What the problem that they need to order all those parts, period. They do not have the know how of making those parts themselves in order to vertically integrate, cut costs everywhere and sell at higher margins."
"Sure, it has purportedly cost them somewhere around $33.6 billion so far and still undergoing more lawsuits, but their revenues have been climbing year over year with them taking $108 billion in revenue for 2019.  Maybe there was one year in there that they took a loss.

And one of the ""repercussions"" in the US was to invest in an EV charging network - well that's something they had to do anyway.  I'm not feeling too badly for them, while I haven't done some deep analysis it comes across more like most corporate ""punishment"" where the profits well exceeded any punishment faced later.

It doesn't matter if vw fans acknowledged/recognized how messed up dieselgate was if they just keep buying more cars."
"OK. So in the next 2-3 years, what do you expect to see? That way we can tell whether it's happening or not. Without any real expectation, it's hard to measure. Phrases like ""upcoming years"" or ""a significant degree"" are just too vague.

Other EV manufacturers are definitely not the enemy. I'm just saying they're not going to be able to do it. It's not that they didn't want to, but they couldn't. And Tesla's speed of innovation is about 10 times of theirs. So when they speed it up, they can narrow that to 2-3 times but there is no way that they can innovate as fast as Tesla. The mindsets are just different."
"Oh man, I cannot have a serious conversation when a prejudiced person just spewed these kinds of things. To anyone that knows what they are talking about, such as Ark invest analysts, it is extremely clear that Tesla is the undisputed leader in autonomous, as well as many many other fields."
"I am a scientist, and I fundamentally understand scientific processes. To me it is crystal clear who has huge advantages and who will achieve it first and not just first, but by making profit on the way there instead of spending to achieve it. Tesla's method is pure genius."
"Jetta dimensions:  185″ L x 71″ W x 57″ H

Model 3 dimensions:  185″ L x 73″ W x 56-57″ H

Golf dimensions:  168″ L x 71″ W x 58″ H 

ID.3 dimensions:  167.8″ L x 71.2″ W x 61.1″ H 

Enjoy your day."
"The e-Golf gets >4.5mi/kWh, better than the Model 3.  It is a slightly smaller vehicle, but I have little reason to doubt that VW can achieve at least 4mi/kWh for a Model 3 competitor."
"I think one of the big things the VW optimists overlook is just how much of the insurmountability of Tesla's lead is attributable to vertical integration. It's commendable that Diess is all-in on electrifying their whole product line, but a huge portion of every VW car *isn't made by VW*. It's going to take quite a lot to drag that long tail of suppliers--- Bosch, Behr, Eberspacher, Hella, etc--- into the EV age. It can be done, sure, but it's probably not going to be *faster* that Tesla did it. Not to mention the elephant in the room: where are the batteries going to come from?"
"What's to stop VW or Toyota from just putting cameras in every car they sell right away? They would acquire an order of magnitude more data that Tesla very quickly. It's not like the cameras cost that much.

People seem to think that Tesla has this huge data advantage, but they don't realize how easy it would be for companies to pool some resources and within a year collect 10 years worth of Tesla data."
so you know because you know but you cant tell how you know.
">I am a scientist

lol"
"I hope they execute well because if they electrify their whole product line at once, they’re going to go bankrupt faster than other ICE automakers."
"I am not gonna spend the time to analyze this for you, I don't have the time honestly. But think about this. Why haven't they done it? The argument you are using has been used to make Tesla's huge advantages seem smaller hundreds of times about different advantages over the years. Every single time it has been proven that the ""competitors"" for various reasons just can't do it... The reasons range from conservative company culture, to lack of knowledge and expertise, to rigid supply chains and overheads, to dealership models, lack of understanding of software, lack of expertise on AI and a thousand other things. The point is Tesla has billions of miles of data already that have gone into the most advanced neural network and noone else has more than a couple of million. If they can let them show it.... Noone has and noone is going to."
"You are making the point you are arguing against.  Legacy auto is unwilling to invest and doesn’t have the software chops to do it.  This is why they will go the way of Kodak, RIM, etc."
What and give away something for free for everybody? There is no direct profit. That´not what accomplished companies do.
"I know because I have studied Physics, Electronic engineering and software engineering and have spent countless hours investigating Tesla's advantages. If you think I could pass all that knowledge onto you or that it would be worth my time trying to convince anyone of anything online for hours, you are mistaken mate."
"Well, if the data is so valuable, who cares? Lots of companies have to spend money to acquire data before they have a profitable way to use that data."
But have you spent a lot of time on the technology of the competitors?  I bet they keep some of their breakthroughs that might give them the advantage to being first for fully-autonomous driving a secret because they don´t want others to copy it before it´s even released.
"You can't know one's advantages without knowing their compeition, so yes. 

Let them keep it a secret, while Musk is open-sourcing everything and still wiping the competition off the map, because of the amazing innovation culture he infuses in all of his companies."
"Oh, and they have different wheels other than the turbines! My dream config is the blue with the mid 20"" wheels."
Gemini wheels!!
Hopefully going to Nashville.  Picking mine up on Thursday unless the country gets shut down!
There’s my white one
Have you seen Gone in 60 Seconds?
I saw at least 3 headed to the Atlanta area too
Going to Charlotte 🤞🤞🤞
Saw one drive by my work the other day. Got seriously excited and my coworker had no idea why. Was probably the first one in my city.
THANK YOU. SAVE MOTHER EARTH!!!
Shame you can't link then all and power the semi.
Model “Yes”!
I thought I was the only one that geeks out seeing trailers full of teslas.  My girlfriend got a promotion so I drive about 4 hours to visit her each way.  I text her every time I see one.  Thankfully she accepts my love for Tesla even though I can't afford them.
*fappening intensification*
I assume alot of us on the east coast are getting final contracts on the 3/23/20 and home drop off very shortly after. Seems to be plant directly to customer.  We can dig this situation.
Come to (Western) Canada please!
"I see non-uberturbine wheels, meaning non-performance models are getting ready for delivery?"
"There are several on the lot at the Schaumburg, IL center waiting for delivery. Blue, Midnight Silver and White."
Im headed west on I80 through Ohio and ive seen at least 10 trucks full of 3s and Ys headed east.
Where's my Model 3😭
Where to?
I've been obsessing over the Model Y ever since I saw it at the LA Auto Show but didn't pull the trigger on it because I bought the Model 3 and ended up returning it. Can some people that ordered LR AWD in 2020 that got delivery let me know when they ordered?? It would really motivate me to put the deposit down on the Y if there are late preorder success stories.
"I saw 2 truckloads of teslas last week. I didnt notice if any of them were Ys. they all looked like 3s to me.

first one: https://photos.app.goo.gl/PZjaQb7hSxjzfDqe6

the second one was 2 days later and a few lanes over so i couldn't get a pic."
"If that was on the I-5 south in central California today, I saw it too 😍"
Fantastic!
Lucky bastards are getting the last ones in awhile lol.
I think the other auto-makers are probably hearing boss music right about now...
[Another truckload in Texas.](https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/90527737_10158178935582767_190362055889387520_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=Qcc-b40s_MkAX8XTYnU&_nc_ht=scontent-dfw5-2.xx&oh=7a737905689107f2664aadb7a32149d4&oe=5E9F056E)
I saw my first model y in person today. Surprised at how much better it looks up close than via pictures. Probably my favorite looking Tesla so far!
Disapointed by the fact that it is a diesel truck still
Does anyone know if performance Gemini wheel comes with **red** brake calipers (a la turbine) or is it a standard black caliper?
Nice!
*Models Y
Pretty sure there's an imposter 3-- the one just behind the white one appears to be a 3 based on the wheels.
"What the hell is a Model Y?

On their website I see the S, the 3, and the X."
You know slimmer tires ride worse
This! First I’ve seen of customer cars
"Huh, so it turns out they don’t look so bad in person"
I hope they make covers for the induction wheels for road trips!
Willing to do some show and tell? I work downtown!
I have an appointment for the 27th unless the national guard says otherwise.
"Sorry, but I already called dibs"
[deleted]
Hope they’re going to Raleigh too :)
"Getting my Model 3 on Monday from Charlotte :). Was supposed to be Sunday, but the truck can't make it on time."
I pick up my Y from Charlotte on the 30th if all is still functioning/open.
My model Y is non-performance and I on its way to Charlotte per Tesla. I ha e my delivery appointment set up for 8 days from now. So they’re out there.
Towards Cleveland??
"A guy in my local Tesla group ordered his Model Y Performance three days ago and took delivery yesterday. 

Lots of cancellations"
That link doesn't work
Those are 3’s.
They're working on that problem.
Scroll down
I might do Gemini wheels instead and just paint them.
this isn't in person!
Depends on what “downtown”...I’m driving it back to East TN.  But I will be doing plenty of show & tell with anyone who has questions or wants to see anything in particular here.
"Toss a coin guys :)

Call heads or tails ..."
Gone in 57 Seconds just doesn't have the same ring to it
28th here
Congrats man. Did they receive test/demo vehicles? I know this is the wrong time and I won't go now. Last time I checked was in Jan and they told me March for Tesla MY and April/May for Taycan.
"I drove to upper Michigan and the entire time between NJ until turning north into Michigan i saw a total of probably 15 trucks, so yes."
Holy shit. This blows my mind. Do you mind if I ask what region? Im in SoCal. I got further discouraged because of the Fremont production halt but this really could change the game for me. Thank you!
I'm dumb and didn't copy the share link. Just the URL on my photos page. I think the edited one should work.
And I cant wait to see it
"good advice...

I mean whatever floats your boat but you will get better comfort out of a tire larger sidewalls not sure why I'm being downvoted
I mean not CGI
From a two meter distance and with wipes of everything they touch.
Anywhere near JC? I’ve seen a few model 3s driving around here over the past year.
How far are you from Chattanooga?? I would love to see it. PM me if necessary.
"Can you measure distance from the rear seat to the front seat, at a point about halfway up the seat, in the furthest forward and back position? For those of us with rear facing car seats it's a little tricky to figure out."
...Witcher.
"Heads I win, tails you lose"
"No test vehicles anywhere that I know of. I bet it's closer to May or June for demos given all the pandemic stuff. Even if they get them sooner, I bet they don't let anyone just go browse or test drive for a while."
"Minnesota

It was a performance though. Have they manufactured any AWDs yet?"
On the Tesla website...
"I know, the Geminis have the largest sidewall. The 20"" have medium sidewall."
No.  Online.
"Sorry, not that far east!  But if there’s anything you want to know or see in the Y, let me know and I’ll give you all the details."
"Sure!  I can also take a pic with my sons rear facing car seat installed for you so you can see, too.  

Unless something happens to postpone the delivery, or the mods object, I’ll have a thread later in the week for you all."
"According to the Tesla Google Docs, there are people that are receiving AWD deliveries this week. In fact I think the first one was yesterday if Im not mistaken."
I always go for bigger sidewalled tires but I live in potholes and bad weather
Even better! Congratulations!
"Yeah that would be cool. From the point where the seat pan meets the seat back, my car seat goes up 21"" and forward 25"". Kinda curious what kinda front legroom I can get with it."
"From a fellow pothole sufferer, can you spell out which wheel spec you use?"
"I agree. The ""best ""upgrade"" I made to my Model S is replacing the 21"" wheels with 19"" wheels."
Don’t jinx it!
"I just used 15"" rims and whatever tire seems right lol right now in have 15"" rims with 235/75 tires so around a 28 inch tire that's on my little S10 some half a 3/4 you move up to 16"" rims I actually have too big of tires right now because they run frame. 

I dont completely understand your question but basically I eyeball it because cracked rims and blown tires ain't fun"
I know Tesla makes their own tires do they have any real variety? Or is it just for factory rims
🤞
"Thanks, i was asking for a model Y! I have a Zoe at the moment and destroyed the wall of one tyre already, and whenever I see a Tesla I think: nice car, but I’ll get very friendly with the bloke replacing my blown tyres. 

So I am curious what sort of wheels people put on an electric vehicle to give them robustness."
they don't make their own tires.  Rims are made by a factory in China.  Not sure if all are made there.
Hard for me to answer I'm honestly not much of a Tesla guy but their stuff is interesting when it's not 2 in the morning I'll do a little bit of research and see what I can see
"I meant dont they have some sort of ""special soundpropfinh"""
"Ha! No worries! Thanks for the answers - half eight in the morning here, getting up early. 

I suspect there is little choice on a Tesla"
Anyone know if 18” rims are possible? I need lots of sidewall
Love to know the answer to that question.
"This is the smart way to handle a situation like this. I noticed a few local restaurants near me that were forced to shut down are redesigning their fascia or remodeling the inside. If you have the money in reserve and were planning on upgrades and updates eventually, now is the time."
A silver lining
"The article mentions that Tesla might use a ""tent"" again for Model Y. Does anybody know if they ever stopped using the tent that they set up for Model 3, or has it been in use this whole time?

> When ramping up Model 3 production, Tesla famously built a “tent”, which was actually a more permanent sprung structure, to house a new Model 3 assembly line.
>
> The new line enabled them to reach the important milestone of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week.
>
> Now we are told that Tesla plans to do something similar for Model Y and deploy some production capacity under a sprung structure to go in operation when they can reopen the plant."
"I'm telling you people, Elon's gonna go all out robotics now that he learned from model 3 production hell."
"So “shelter in place” means you can’t manufacture your product, but you can still have employees working in the factory? I thought the point was to keep people away from each other"
I'm working from home and basically just going back and fixing all the broken ass excel reports iv never had time to fix before.
This will most likely mean more automation and less human workers in the future. Great for the company and shareholders but how many will come back from this crisis finding a robot has replaced them?
The pandemic is a lie. The quarantines are just so the government can replace the batteries in the birds.
That permit fee seems outrageous!
Sounds like an essential activity that'll save a lot of lives.
Is this considered essential?
To me this is the definition of a shutdown.
Does that mean no more software updates?
It would be a pleasant surprise if they retooled the lines to push up the release of the often rumored S/X refresh
"So by shutting down, he's making people come to work anyway. Got it.

I love Elon for helping save the world from oil and co2, but I'd never want to work for a workaholic who has zero respect for anyone's family life like him."
"Do you think this was agreed when the Police said ""Tesla was well prepared"" for the meeting or will the cops be back around again?"
"This is too easy for a company to say. Where are the details about the upgrade? First the plan was to produce ventilators, and now the plan is to improve production?"
Progress amid despair
so they dont have to make them in a tent anymore?
"Alien Dreadnought, engage!"
"It makes sense. They’ve learned so much since they first setup the model 3 lines in Fremont. The MIC model 3s have three parts for their fenders where the American made ones have 18 (which I got to see about a year ago when some idiot ran a red light and hit me very hard). These not only make them cheaper to build, but also make them cheaper to fix and more reliable in the long run."
Tesla needs to stop doing smart things. I want the stocks I sold at 300 back! XD
best time to improve the model 3
Think this whole thing pushed back production for the CyberTruck?
Wasn't they considered as critical infrastructure?
"Why the hell is that idiot calling $27,000 ""major improvements"". That's nothing."
"Oh, we could fix all the pot holes in roads!"
"Yup, construction is an essential service so we can work on closed down places."
"We doing something similar at my work, using down time to work on fixing up infatructure."
"Legitimately curious. Why would a business that makes food not be considered essential? None of our stores/restaurants are closed. Their dining rooms are closed, but you can still order take out."
"literally every manufacturer in the world does that, it's nothing new"
There are a few silver linings. Hopefully this pandemic also brings people together.
Elon is a silver lining factory.
"The Model 3 assembly line is still under the ""tent"", which again is actually a sprung structure.

Tesla has since deployed several other sprung structures in Fremont."
"Still concerning because it’s a new way of doing production as far as cars go but you can really see they’ve designed the Y for automation. For example the wiring harness is now a set of relays/controllers. Why that’s important is the 3’s major problem was getting automation to properly target wires and the correct plugs, they might’ve fixed that with this design. (Not to mention the all in one body press machine that they patented recently, is a testament to automation)"
"I think he specifically said he misjudged how many things robots can’t do that humans are needed for. 

We will still get there, but I think even he realized humans are still not fully outdated in certain roles."
Too much robotics was part of the reason for production hell. Elon likes to think big but sometimes it bites him.
"I recall he mentioned one of the failures he experienced in model 3 production in that he initially tried to over automate the production of the car in some areas, when instead he should’ve relied on humans in some cases."
The Y’s stiff wiring is proof of that. He repeatedly uses dangly wiring as a lesson of human advantage. And he’s addressed it. He’s clearly going full force towards hard core automation.
"This clearly violates the order.  Upgrading and doing any renovations is obviously not minimum essential operations under any sense of the word.  Sure, Elon will claim it in some form."
I'm not advocating for outdoor to lose jobs and while initially that's a problem big picture how is this bad? Why do we want peoples hours spent doing what a machine can do?
"I doubt it would result in any job loses.  Assuming they are allowed to do any upgrades, this likely means making the lines run smoother or ramping up Model Y production faster, which should actually increase jobs (and job stability)."
I think the more pressing question is will the company survive this. Ford should be asking the same. The economy is about to be fucked.
"Yes I agree with you. Robots are faster , smarter and cheaper. Way better for the shareholders."
Robots are going to take the jobs crisis or not.
"> This will most likely mean more automation and less human workers in the future. Great for the company and shareholders but how many will come back from this crisis finding a robot has replaced them?

Aren't there like 7 million job openings in America? Before the virus people had a hard time finding workers."
"> but how many will come back from this crisis finding a robot has replaced them? 

Few to none. The level to which this sub overestimates the state of automation today is nuts."
/r/birdsareteal
Yea that fee is ridiculous. I'm still surprised they went with California for their factory.
"What does the permit fee pay for?  I'm assuming it covers the cost of city engineers and other staff to do a review of the plans meet code and bylaws and perform regular and final site inspections \[while the plans should have an engineering stamp already, I'm assuming the city has some level of review if only to ensure due diligence\].  If it's a large or complex commercial project then the fee should reflect that."
"He has quite literally stated there will not be refreshes, only minor changes over the course of time."

"With all these comments, I can tell who runs a business and who doesn't. As a small business owner, we're using the time to tackle a to-do list that we never had time for (maintenance, upgrades, etc). You do the best you can to keep things running when there are so many unknowns. 

Unless the government is going to write a cash check to completely shut down operations, what do you expect businesses to do? Ask anyone who owns a restaurant in your neighborhood. These businesses may not be there when the virus is done."
I’m wondering how much this will push back production of a standard range Y.
"I don't think they were building them, and design for both truck and manufacturing plant can happen on home computers.  They can even simulate crash testing from home."
I expect the truck to come out in 2022. They better release the Tesla semi next year
That's just the filing fee for the permit for the work.
"Funny story, my town just repaved one of its main roads during the winter. And now it is installing new gaslines...by ripping up the two month old pavement and replacing it with blotchy patches. It was a smooth two months though, I must admit!"

That’s brilliant
I live in Toronto and saw a pothole crew out doing just that!

Teslament to automation
[deleted]
The model y does not have wiring harness?
Every car company in the world is trying to reduce costs. Does nobody here think that if it was feasible to do 100% automation that they would do it?
"Or rethink the car to be something that doesn't need to be too complex for robots. Rather than making a hand-bot to route wires, rethink if you need wires to be routed."
"Yeah. God grief, Musk is like a toddler trying to argue with parents. 

""No one should draw on walls""

""Ok, I'm doing it, I'm not noone ""

""You too, Musk""

""Ok, I'm drawing on the floor instead"""
"If they're putting a tent up for more Model Y production, they can literally just say that's where they are going to manufacture Ventilators"
Oh I agree. Automate everything and make everything cheaper for the consumer. Just want to ask the question. What will we all do when the machines can do everything better than us?
"> Why do we want peoples hours spent doing what a machine can do?

Because unfortunately our economy is built around the premise that you have to constantly work in order to survive, so a shortage in demand for labor (even if for good reasons) becomes a negative thing under our economic structure. If only someone had run from president with the goal of fixing that issue..."
The jobs that have people shortages are the ones that will get automated the fastest. Oh can't find 1.5 million truck drivers we need? Robot trucks.
You mean r/birdsarentreal
I know Elon tried really hard for Detroit but they made it really hard on him. I imagine California was chosen for the tech talent?
You know how you have to pay the mafia for “protection?“
"Interior refresh is expected. New steering wheel and horizontal screen like the 3, Y, and cybertruck"
"Sooner or later the S/X will get a complete redesign. The S is essentially the same now as it was in 2012. Still a good looking car, and still ahead of the competition, but you can’t stay still forever. Lots of people in this sub trumpet the “no refreshes” mantra, but even the Model T had to be scrapped and started over with a clean sheet design eventually. 

Now that Y is out and Semi and Roadster 2 are both more or less done with design, I think a clean slate design for the S is probably underway. They’ll take lessons learned from 3/Y production and apply them, and give the car a fresh new look. Maybe it won’t be called Model S anymore, but it’ll still be a four door full size sedan."
I think that's been the scuttlebutt
"nobody says those choices are easy but they are necessary. Valuing life over profit means sometimes you go bankrupt to do the right thing, that's the damn point. You seem to be the one that doesn't get it."
"The order is literally minimum essential operations.  Does this fit that?  Clearly not.  As a small business owner, you'd think you'd be the most incensed, because small businesses are all shut down, but somehow elon thinks that doesn't apply to him."
"I know they are not currently building them, but I heard they were looking to build a factory, so will the factory be pushed back now? Obviously we don't really know that answer, but I wouldn't be surprised if 2022 we don't see the Cybertruck quite yet. We also have to consider economic situation. Will people have money to purchase a new car/truck? Many people are told to stay home right now without pay. Banks told to freeze collection of payments. You think banks will start giving out loans after this is all said and done? Also not to be a Debbie Downer, but the United States really mishandled this ""bigly"". The report numbers are much lower than actual numbers, so flatting the curve, may not be possible until United States is more serious, and because of being so late to take action, I could see this lasting until September. If the nation listened, it could easily be done in a month or two. We shall see how it all unfolds"
">on home computers

Minor correction, to preserve proprietary information they're probably still happening on Tesla owned laptops, just employees taking them home"
"I wonder which would displace more emissions or barrels of oil?    I personally think they'll sell ~300K or more Cybertrucks per year, but I don't know if I should root for that to be prioritized over, say, 100K Semis per year.   Not that what I'm rooting for matters, but I wish I knew enough to do some quantitative analysis as to which would be better for reducing oil demand, emissions, whatever metric you want to look at."
Strange. It's common practice where I live to bundle major utility projects with roadwork. It really helps to not have so many cuts in the pavement. I thought this would be more common.
"This is beyond common. I work for a civil engineering company and see this ALLLLLL THE TIME. It beyond baffles me. ""Let's do step 2-3 first and then we can come back and do #1 and fuck up 2-3."
"It always seems antiquated to me how roads are built in the modern age. Why can't they adopt  a more modular design, like giant Lego mats that just clip together. Integrated service hatches to run utilities, that kind of thing. I'm sure there are lots of good reasons why, just thinking out loud."
"Sounds like most places I've lived. I had the 'pleasure' of looking down on the works to put a new tram line in where ai live, and got to watch them dig up the same bit of road 4 times for the one end goal. At least they provided some physical comedy too, by dropping a wee digger in once by mistake."
 I've seen on multiple occasions around my area where a road is completely repaved only to be torn open to water/sewer line work.
"yep, sounds like a government."
"Are you my neighbor? Local streets just got totally refinished so I’m guessing they’ll need to replace a water main by June, virus be dammed!"

Teslament to automuskion?
The flufferbot got fired. They determined what it was doing wasn’t needed.
"Updates it, brings it down to 100m in length. For comparison the model 3 has a wiring harness that’s 1.5km in length."
"Lol. Desire to do something and ability to do something are two different things. Leaps in automation require innovation and ability to make drastic changes, not continuous refinement and a supply change that lacks innovation."
I'm sure things like that were considered when designing cybertruck.
">where they are going to manufacture Ventilators

According to SpaceX is manufacturing Ventilators, not Tesla."
"Good question, hopefully STEM type careers, advances in science and technology. More resources into infrastructure and jobs that can the automated. Maybe reduce the nurse and physician shortage. Just thinking out loud. It will be initially difficult but big picture might help advance society as a whole."
"> What will we all do when the machines can do everything better than us?

This isn't a problem because of comparative advantage. The US can do everything ""better"" than a random third-world country already, but it's still more efficient to have them do whatever we're slightly less better at.

"From a single company perspective, it’s no big deal.  This company is high growth s they probably have jobs for everyone. Even if they didn’t, those workers should go elsewhere.

its more of a problem for society as a whole.  At a macro level, how do we adjust when many companies follow the same transition?  Everyone is fond of throwing around the saying that previous industrial revolutions eventually  led to more jobs and huge gains, but neglect the fact that even then there was a lost generation or two that couldn’t make it: those buggy whip craftsmen who couldn’t make it on a car assembly line.  However this time it may be permanent: its not just a lost generation to support, but as computers and robots start to do everything humans can, it’s possible that jobs will decline permanently.

just imagine if self-driving cars really do happen.  That is millions of jobs lost, just in the US.  Will all of them be able to transition to a different career?"

Whereas most semis purchased would comparatively be in near constant usage - whether loading, driving, unloading or charging. Generally only sitting entirely idle if merely run by a singular driver rather than being a fleet vehicle."

"This same thing happened in my city. Idiots paved miles of road, one lane being at least 20"" thick concrete for a bus system, then 6 months later they tore up chunks of it to replace infrastructure under the new road."
Gas is not usually a municipal utility.
That’s what happens in my city. It makes road work take a lot longer so people just complain about how long that takes.
"My house has a concrete floor that was poured after the drywall and baseboard were installed. So the baseboards are submerged in the floor. The only explanation I can come up with is that the drywall guy was ready to go and the concrete guy was late, so they just ran with it."
"Because you end up having to put in just about the same amount of work of foundation. You don't think about it, but roads have a massive amount of gravel below them that prevents sink holes and whatnot. This is still required in a modular road.

Secondly, asphalt is crazy cheap. It's made of gravel and the sludge that you get when you refine oil, called bitumen. 

Third, asphalt is infinity customize able. You can fill an area in with it without running into trying to fit standard size peices into a non standard road."

How are people who've been working in manufacturing or transportation their entire levels going to transition to STEM careers? It's reasonable that some, particularly younger workers, might be able to make the transition, but it's unrealistic to believe this is a solution to what could end up being a mass shortage in demand for labor."
"Yup.  I don't advocate for it right now because we aren't nearly at the point where it works.  UBI is super-expensive.  If you have insane levels of automation then that becomes a huge source of wealth that you can tax.  However, with our current economy I don't think you could use it for more than a token amount.

Actually, I do sort-of advocate for it in one sense - as a control for monetary policy.  The problem is that most people won't understand it and it will become a huge political football.  However, one issue I see with monetary policy today is that central banks really can only control money through interest rates, and lately even tiny/zero interest is resulting in low levels of inflation in the real economy, but lots of inflation in the stock market.  I think the problem is that due to wealth distribution when you double the amount of money probably only 20% ends up in the hands of people who actually spend it on normal stuff, and the other 80% ends up in the hands of multi-millionaires who already have all the normal stuff they could ever want, so they just dump it into stocks and bonds.  It makes it really hard to control the real economy without having massive side-effects in the financial/etc markets.

If you had a monetary UBI then the Fed could just decide how much money to siphon out of investments and dump into ordinary consumers.  They'd just set a tax rate on wealth/etc and then all that money just gets redistributed via UBI.  Now, those UBI payments might just be $100/month, or maybe a fair bit more, but they wouldn't really be intended to live off of.  It is just like a permanent stimulus check that just gets tuned up/down based on inflation rates to keep the economy going at about the right speed.

The problem with that is politics.  Once everybody starts getting $100/month politicians are going to be incentivized to stick their hands in the pot and start promising hikes in that payment.  If the amount of the payment was previously regulated to have optimium inflation to ensure good employment and all that stuff then cranking up the UBI payments would basically cause in increase in inflation with capital being siphoned out of businesses/etc.  So maybe now everybody is getting an extra $500/month in UBI but now the average salary is $15k/yr lower because of stagflation or whatever.

And that is really my issue with UBI.  It is such a great idea, but politicians are terrible, and honestly so are voters.  UBI is the golden egg, and greed could end up killing the goose that laid it."

"Drug companies in the US spend more on advertising than they do on R&D. Which is quite amazing, as the US and New Zealand are the only nations that allow advertising of prescription drugs directly to consumers. They are advertising something to you that you can't buy.

The drug companies found that it is much more profitable to get people on their existing drugs than to invest in R&D to make new ones. So if anything, this discourages research, because the well-advertised names are so entrenched that people are less willing to try any newer drug that doesn't have all the marketing behind it."
"Yeah, though the clinical trials won't get any cheaper if the US stops subsidizing them.  Ultimately either everybody else has to pay more, it has to become 100% government-funded, or they just won't happen.

Also, from what I can tell from medicare stats drugs and insurance only make up 15% of US healthcare spending.  No doubt we can save a lot on both, but people seem to think that if we just fix those two things we're done.  If you want the cheap prices everybody in this thread is talking about you need to slash about 60% of costs, so there is a LOT more spending that would need to be cut.  

I think people talk about drugs because consumers tend to be exposed to those prices more and of course $400 for a bottle of pills seems dramatic.  That, and most people don't personally know anybody who works for an insurance or drug company, while most people probably do have a friend who is a nurse/doctor/admin/etc.  I think the reality is that the bulk of the cuts will have to come from these categories, which means lost jobs or people getting paid less to do the same work.  Tort reform would be another obvious place to save money - no other country spends on malpractice the way the US does, but again many people have friends who are lawyers.

I guess you can have socialized healthcare while not cutting any of those costs, but now the US will continue to spend 2x or more what everybody else on Earth spends.  It just won't spend as much on drugs."

"> Drug companies in the US spend more on advertising than they do on R&D.

That isn't accurate according to the numbers I found.

These [2018 numbers look closer,](https://www.raps.org/news-and-articles/news-articles/2019/7/do-biopharma-companies-really-spend-more-on-market) with 2 companies spending more or marketing than R&D, but the rest were the opposite, with Merck being really lopsided.  Note, these numbers roll in cost of sales too."

"So what’s the better bang for buck model x, y or i-pace and why is it not an i-pace?"
Didn't know one of the quirks and features of Reddit is that u/Doug-DeMuro is a Redditor
It seems too small to even be a crossover. Not the Tesla SUV I would hope for.
So it's a Tesla made by a car company that allows people to work on their own car?
The legendary part of this post is doug resounding to it ! Saw your first vid a little bit over a year ago n the rest is history. Keep up the good work man n we appreciated it!
"Thanks for the review /u/Doug-DeMuro ! Was unsure about the Y for awhile but I quite like it now.
Edit: Just wanted to add that as a 6'4"" person myself I appreciate you talking about the ""fitting into the car"" factor as that's the first thing I wonder about when looking into cars!"
And the one they’ll have to keep waiting for! Lol
This is a nicely produced review. Hats of to the creator
/u/Doug-DeMuro How would you compare the road noise of the Y vs. sayyy..a BMW?
*THIS*
Uh excuse me! I'm part of everyone and the cybertruck is the tesla Ive been waiting for!
Sorry if this has been asked but why are they all blue with black rims? They all have to be the same at first?
The Tesla that everyone is waiting for is the one that has a bottom line under 25k before any rebates.
Why does Doug always sound either sarcastic or angry?
The only thing I don't really like from this review is constant conflating Autopilot as FSD.
Glad he called out the lack of controls for seat heaters in the back seat. Always thought that was dumb.
"Like Doug said in the review that the interior is polarizing, I feel that the back seat of a $60k should at least offer some actual amenities to them. Score maybe a little high imo"
[deleted]
"He seemed very amused by the fact that they used the same seats but raised them up on pedestals, like it was a weird thing to use the same seats in two similar models.  Makes perfect sense to me and it would be more inexplicable if they had designed much different seats.

Also, he was surprised that they gave no control for the heated seats in the back, like it was some weird design quirk.  But the one theme in the Model 3 is that hard controls are generally used only where required by law, like emergency flashers, blinkers, and wipers.  Almost everything else has an electronic switch.  No switches to break, keeps wiring simple, and allows modification later through software.  You may or may not agree with the concept, but it shouldn’t be surprising based on their design concept."
"61k is relatively affordable for a family? You can get a chevy bolt for 25 grand, Hell I've seen them lightly used for 15. Personally, I am looking forward to all the surplus parts so they can be repurposed for DIY electric cars. You can build one so cheap and upgrade the battery pack when a chemistry comes out that doesn't catch on fire or poison the ground, water and destroy vast amounts of land mining it. I'd rather stick to something simple and non proprietary. I can get a late 90s vehicle, non functioning for under 1k. Gut it, clean it and repaint. Another 5k in parts and all I need is a battery pack. I can go cheap with a lead bank and drive slow and end up with 40-50 miles tops and wait for a better chemistry. At least lead is 100% recyclable. I don't get the appeal of these. Its not affordable or economical, its not green. I understand its fast and fun to drive but I don't understand how that brings so many people in compared to other fun to drive and fast cars."
"Anyone else surprised at how dirty/scraped some parts of the interior were in the video?

Given how new the car is it had me wondering if the owner received it that way from the factory."
"Is there any review that is done with car seats in the back, this is one of my concerns for the next 3 - 5 years."
"Nice review. It's funny, as you were showing off the hatch area, I could already see that they still don't seat the hatch gasket correctly! They do the same as in the 3, they tuck the rubber flange on the bottom seal, inside the bumper cover, instead of the other way, with the flange covering the edge of the bumper cover. Shaking my head."
A coming 3rd row? Must be in a longer frame?
[removed]
"It looks fine, not exciting but necessary model for Tesla to sell more EVs.  It's just not a big difference to be excited.  For example the Civic and CRV are same platform but completely different look and feel.  The rear hatch doesn't look as usable, just more hump and that's my criticism of the Model X too that it's not enough hatch space compared to the competition.  I like Tesla to produce a real SUV/CUV that has 3 rows of seating and doesn't look like Cybertruck or another stretch wagon."
"the wind/tire noise is super loud, hes wearing a lavalier mic and you can still hear these noises super load.

Unless this has been boosted ob purpose in the video im shocked how loud it is."
Did Doug say he wants a heads-up display to tell you what gear you're in?
He wants a heads up display to see “What gear you’re in” 🤔
"As an owner of TSLA stock, I've been waiting for the positive Model Y reviews some come in. Cha-ching."
"I can assure you, not *everyone* would take a Y over a 3. In fact, no one I’ve talked to would. They prefer the 3."
Goes on sale early next year?
"at 26:56, you can see he cut someone off and almost caused an accident while making a right turn."
But what's the Doug score?
"""Elon cant beat physics""

SpaceX disagrees lol"
"is there no extra cargo space in the frunk?


edit: i’m blind and didn’t see it"
Well im waiting for a real 30K tesla.
"Hah, well, that's... bizarre."
"IIRC his name wasn't actually Joe. I think it's more.. ""for the average Joe with kids"" ?"
"I've heard two different possibilities for this and neither is a 100% case closed explanation. 

1. The original tweet Elon responded to was from someone name Steven:
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1155279421118402562 So I'm not sure where this came from unless there is another tweet I'm not able to locate.

2. The other explanation is that it was named after Joe Besser from the Three Stooges: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tyxwnEjSRs"
You beat me to it!  haha
I always thought joe mode was a joke name that it was for yo kids.
"Thought it was Joe Rogan complaining it kept waking up his kids. Dunno.

I use it because all the noises annoy the fuck out of me, plenty loud in Joe mode."
Joe mamma
That is awesome.
supposedly but the guy who tweeted Elon to ask for it wasn't named Joe.
"Thanks, I appreciate your comment *AND* your acknowledgement of the fact that I don't typically take cars from manufacturers (OR TRIPS!). Most viewers don't understand the distinction here, but I have so much trouble viewing free-press-car-free-press-trip reviews as ""objective"" when I watch or read them."
">THIS... was a great review

Fixed that for you"
It looks like a nice car. I can't imagine how stuffed it's going to be in the back with a 7-seat option though. Given what we see in this video I can't see any realistic world where the back seats are comfortable for anyone over the age of 10.
How did you like his cyber truck videos?
I find it funny since most people on r/teslamotors said Doug doesnt understand anything about Tesla because he thought that cybertruck was a joke
"I was initially referred to Doug by one of my co-workers a few years ago since he liked all the quirks and features that Doug pointed out along with Doug being an un-biased good reviewer especially with BMW cars he likes. He's very picky about the types of reviewers he trusts and watches.  What's funny is that my co-worker is very anti-Tesla to the point where he even criticizes the usual good points about a Tesla like the low center gravity (no you want more body roll for more ""fun""), the frunk (it's just wasted space and should have designed it better, have to get out and walk all the way up to the front), and software updates (no good car should need software updates, should be perfect from the factory, updates can brick the car). So to hear Doug give good reviews of Tesla along with designating the Model 3 performance as the best car of 2019 just really smacks my co-worker in the face."
Why not simply get the money?
"It’s not a perfect solution, but I’m a fan of the NFC tag trick people are using. If you’re not familiar, people are putting an NFC tag behind the tow hook cover up front. Then, using their iPhone, they put the phone near the tow hook cover and the NFC tag triggers a Siri Shortcut which pops the frunk open. Not sure if there is an equivalent for Android, but I feel there has to be."
This is the second biggest reason I’m glad I bought a FOB for my 3. Much more convenient.
"On Android, I just drag down the notification and there's an option for opening the frunk if your phone is still connected to the car. That's the quickest way for me."
The one thing _I_ wish they had is showing the side camera feeds when activating your turn signal. Doug's reviewed a few other cars like that and it just seems like such obvious low-hanging fruit for Tesla to go after.
Shhhh don't tell them our plan
"Believe me, I have been looking for a good value used Model S, Model X for years. Nope, there are no good (as in good value) used Teslas. The owners usually love them so much, they depreciate so little, one is better off buying a new one. I have seen used ones costing almost as much as new, with just the upside that you don't have to wait to get one. Why else would a used car cost almost like a new one and still be sold?"
"its gonna be very many years till we got enough of them on the streets to be affordable 2nd hand sadly, production capacity is still tiny even when GF4 is up and running."
"Sadly no, I would love a Tesla but I don't have anywhere to charge it! Maybe someday I can figure out some solution."
"> Unfortunately from initial reports it looks like the 3rd row of seats are forward facing 

Wow, crazy. Good luck rear passenger heads!"
"But that’s just a test vehicle, not production. Seats may still face backwards for production."
"The website currently states ""seats 7 adults"".  So it won't be comfortable but they figured out a way to fit 2 adults back there."
Yea that's how it is in the X. Assumed the same for the Y
"> I really wish Tesla hadn't given an apples/oranges comparison for cargo on the 3 and Y on the website. It's only 4x if you compare seats-down Y to seats-up 3.

Yeah, same, I should've made that clearer. Still a big increase though even compared to seats-down Model 3 (43 vs 66). Plus that 43 cubic feet isn't as usable as the 66 in the Y given the different shapes of the two cargo areas."
"The Model 3 and Model Y trunks are the SAME area.  the difference is that the Y has more height.  It's NOT 4X the carrying capacity.  


Measured my 3:  38""W X 42""D

Model Y specs say:  37""W X 43""D"
Guy's got the best quirks and features on youtube I'll tell you that much for free.
[deleted]
"Its not a big feature..

Its a great piece of engineering and improves energy economy but its not a BIG feature. The heater still blows hot and the AC still blows cold. The average consumer doesn't need to know any better.

BUT Doug do quarks and weird features so yea it is surprising he didnt mention it."
And u/Doug-DeMuro's review of the Model 3 taught me everything I needed to know about the car before I picked it up.  I was able to let my wife sit in the driver seat to learn everything about it when I picked mine up in June of 2018.  Best review ever!
Magic underwear
I can already head Doug railing to hold back laughter while saying “THISSSS!!”
Agreed at least it’s an actual truck not a fake suv.
And you watched every second of it mwahahahahahaha
This is why he’s the most watched car enthusiast on YouTube lol
"FYI, he's just as good at 2x speed."
"If its any help I own a Honda Fit, much smaller car with seats that go down flush, and its barely too small for me at 6 feet. I'm fairly sure if you are under 6'2"" you will be fine in this without having to measure. Over that, yeah, visit a dealership and try it out."
"Because there were so many cool quirks and features to discuss that something had to give. IIRC, Doug tries to keep his videos well below 40 minutes, and has on occasion split up longer videos to avoid snoozefests."
"I'd lusted after Tesla since I first read about the original roadster back in 2007 when I started my new job with a 80 mile round trip commute.  I've always wanted their cars, but for obvious financial reasons, I leased super cheap shorter range EV's back in 2013.  The most I wanted to spend on a car was $200/mo, and I've had alot of cheap leased EV's since April/May 2013.   I put alot of miles on cars, and its been fun seeing what all the other manufacturers offer, drive the shit out of them for a year or two or three and turn them in.  I've had the Honda Fit EV, Toyota RAV4 EV, VW E-Golf, and Chevy Bolt EV.

Last year I finally bought my first Tesla (my first EV I've ever purchased instead of leased).  LR AWD Model 3.  It is a fantastic car tech wise and after the acceleration boost, its definitely the fastest and most grin-inducing car I've ever driven, but over the air software updates are not a 1-way street.  It goes both ways, and lately Autopilot on mine has gotten worse with things like phantom braking and bugs that cause the sensors to throw up collision warning messages for no reason.  The Tesla is a love/hate relationship for me.  And right now I'm just more happy driving my little Bolt EV cheap lease, and will probably end up selling the Model 3.  I'm really shocked at how well the Bolt EV was engineered and more impressed by its tech features that always work and are actually very useful for me, vs Tesla which has awesome gimmicks, but they don't always work and they become more frustrating the longer I have the car.

One thing that did solidify my LOVE for Tesla though with software updates was enabling 1-pedal driving (increased regen and the hold mode) with a software update.  That genuinely made my Model 3 a BETTER car than when I first bought it.  I was amazed they could completely change the driving experience of a car.  But again, little things that seem to continually break (like voice commands, the windshield wiper functionality, the weird behavior of Autopilot following updates, etc), that annoyances do add up for me.

Long story short, if you're even considering a Tesla, it might be a good idea to test out a much cheaper EV to play around with for a few months.  Tesla isn't all sunshine and rainbows.  I'm amazed at how often I miss my RAV4 EV, and shocked that most days I prefer just getting in my Bolt for commuting with my 2 small kids."
"I agreed up til your comment about the Y. I actually think the 3 is a funnier looking version of the y; it looks like something not trying to be bloated, when the design is meant to look bloated."
"I think Doug has a good hunch though. Maybe Tesla is trying to figure out how to make them reversible, or just waiting for rear facing federal approval, and the prototypes just had had forward seats. Just as much a mystery as the disappearing tow hitch"
"I don't own a Tesla, but I do think not having android auto is a major limitation.  Car technology has always seems to lag behind consumer electronics and it probably has something to do with the time to qualify automotive components.  Being able to essentially upgrade part of the car as I upgrade my phone, is a great solution and Tesla is missing that.  If I do get a Tesla, there is a good chance I will be mounting a second touch screen in front of the driver and running [android auto through a pi](https://www.hackster.io/news/add-android-auto-to-your-car-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-touchscreen-fee51fcefb78)."
"I would imagine because, range and locations of chargers are not in Google Maps so the benefit would be minimal."
And it’s really bullshit too. I wish the sub didn’t give them such a pass for it.
"Oh, good point. Thanks!"
"I'm really looking forward to Doug's Cybertruck review someday, even though he's not much of a truck guy."
How are the three kiddos fitting in the back?
Can you fit 3 car seats in the back?
"How is the wind noise compare to the 3?

Dougs says it doesn’t really have wind noise.  That’s one of my gripes about the TM3"
How old was your model 3?
"By views per video, Doug is easily the biggest car reviewer on the planet. No joke. Compare his view counts to motortrend, car and driver, autotrend, or any other big reviewer. Doug is a one-man institution."
"I’m in the same boat as you. The Model Y looks good with the black trims and the styling, but I don’t think I can drive without a dashboard in front of me.

Granted, I’ve never driven a car without a dash or HUD for vital information, so maybe when I’m ready to buy, I will rent a Model 3/Y for a week to see how I adjust to the change. If I can’t, then it’s a Model S or X for me."
"Sadly, neither of those vehicles has a HUD either. :-("
Are you new to Doug's videos?  Two shirts is kind of his thing.
"200,000 starting"
Tesla does not do review cars. So there is just one guy who is borrowing the same car to a dozen different Youtube influencers to test drive.
"I disagree, it would be backward to add some. They should just make the passenger access the Tesla app with their phones. 

This would be good for Tesla as more people have their app on their phone before they release their taxi network."
Transportation / import costs?
"The US page bundles ""potential savings"" into the price while the Canadian page shows purchase price without these potential savings by default.  The US purchase price is $52,990 out the door, making it more expensive than the Canadian one when accounting for current exchange rates."
As a Canadian this sucks.
Just wait till we get it in the UK... :/
Hedging against currency drops. Nothing new. Though Tesla seems to be the only one who doesn't underprice Canadian cars in USD terms for market share.
"Unfortunately the heated rear seats are therefore a function with no easy use. Sitting in back and wanting to use a feature created for you, *but having to ask another vehicle occupant to operate this feature* is bad design, period. Objectively, there should probably be a small screen in back, too, that has those controls and rear climate controls."
"Or a used ICE crossover like a RAV4 or CRV.

The tesla Y will save you money if you compare it to an X3 or Macan.

But it's not the economical option if max savings in a CUV are what you are looking for."
"if its the same width as the model 3,there would no way to install 3 forward facing car seats at once. Nor would there be any way to have 2 car seats and an adult in the back."
Nope - same frame.   [https://electrek.co/2020/01/18/pictures-tesla-model-y-third-row-seats-not-large/](https://electrek.co/2020/01/18/pictures-tesla-model-y-third-row-seats-not-large/)

"Having driven a Model 3 for 2 years, I do not think a HUD or screen behind the wheel is necessary, and I think that's the majority opinion.

Having to look behind your wheel for information seems kinda dumb when it's not needed. I much rather have the air vent blowing a nice stream of air onto me."
"Just looking at current trends in the car industry, the realities are becoming clear -- crossovers are in, sedans are out. 

Yes, of course, not *everyone* would prefer a Y -- but speaking generally, this is absolutely the right vehicle for right now. It'll open up Tesla to a new world of shoppers who can't afford an X and don't want a sedan, which is a big deal. Think families, businesses, empty nesters who want a higher seating position... basically everyone who's currently buying CR-Vs and X3s and Tellurides and whatever."
"I’ll talk to you.

Hi, I’d prefer a Y over a 3."
"If both were available in the summer of 2018, I likely would, but I have a kid, so I may be in the minority.

In all seriousness, the trend towards crossovers and SUVs is pretty clear.  The Ys will sell better than the 3s.  The biggest sticking point is the cost.  For those stretching to make the 3 work, they likely won’t pay the extra cash for the Y.  A $30k 3 would be a game changer, but unlikely for a while."
"I waited on buying a 3 because I wanted the Y. I pick my Y up on Saturday, hopefully, and everything I’ve read in the last few weeks has just made me even happier that I waited. Will have a final verdict soon!"
"I'd prefer a Y, if it had been an option when we bought, but there's not enough difference to trade the 3 for it or to justify a second Tesla."
"I'm hoping to try a 3 for a couple of days to see if I can fit me, our 2 kids, my wife, her grandmother and my daughter's stroller comfortably, because I would prefer to go back down to a car. But ultimately, the Y looks like it'd do it, and if our test of the X was anything to go on (which handled way better than our Pathfinder), it'll still handle even better than the Pathfinder anyway."
"Looks like that car had its own lane to the left of Doug, and Doug got on the right-hand most lane"
If I remember correctly a 68(?)
He showed the frunk.
The y frunk is a bit deeper
"Elon never announced a $30k Tesla. The base price for the standard range 3 was announced as $35k, which you can buy today."
"well more like that's so Elon.

Doug - love your videos - so much so that my kids love them. Your intro ... they are copying it for things around the house...

""THIS is my lego robot."""
"Hello Doug, Small question. What would you criticise about the Y?"
"Saying this is in your voice really gave me a good chuckle. 




~Love your videos, Doug."
"It’s also so owners can pull this:

Owner: so this is Joe Mode

Someone: who tf is Joe?

Owner: JOE MAMA"
It's a quirk.
"Good video, FYI the model 3 also has a heated center rear seat :)"
"Dog mode was also created via a tweet request. Someone asked for it. Elon replied OK, and had it for the next update."
I consider it stupid but to each his own. :)
"> The other explanation is that it was named after Joe Besser from the Three Stooges: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tyxwnEjSRs


Holy shit Larry looks different in that"
"Or, it's referring to [this meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dont-ask-who-joe-is-joe-mama)"
"Doug, the kind of guy to make fair and honest car reviews about how he feels about a vehicle instead of only including specs"
Keep up the good work Doug!
Recent subscriber to your channel. You just talked me into the 2020 Corvette!
"Doug, I think your channel is less about reviews for the sake of guiding purchases but rather something far more valuable: an archive of the automobile. A century from now your videos will be a voice from the dust of what cars were like these days. Could you imagine how cool it would be to have Doug videos from the start of the automobile? Huh. That would be cool to see one of your videos on a car from the 20’s or something. The driving part would be especially interesting."
"you’re a legend Doug, thanks for the countless hours of entertainment and education!"
Not really a car guy but I watch your videos during dinner to help me wind down at the end of the day. You could make a video describing a juice maker and I'd enjoy it.
"Also THANK YOU Doug for not asking me to smash that like button, hit that notification bell or ask me subscribe etc. 

Seriously whats wrong with these other youtubers constantly asking this especially weird when i am already subscribing or worse ask in the beginning of the video. A good youtube feature would be to let creators flag the section they do this begging so it doesn’t show to existing subscribers.

Continue do great content and subscribers will come and those you have will remain which you obviously already realized.

My alltime favourites is your Honda Odyssey, vector and spyker reviews! Totally unique content."
"Hey man, my friend and I are big fans, have you ever done or have you ever planned on doing an AMA? I’ve got tons of questions!"
"Didn't you say during the C8 review that the car was a pre-production review car?  How'd that work out?  I figured you got that for a bit from GM for the review?

Not antagonizing, just genuinely curious."
"Doug, can you please explain why you haven’t reviewed the Model S? The most influential car of the decade."
Doug is a legend
You are honestly my favorite car reviewer and content creator in general. I really enjoy the passion and work you put into your craft.
Have you reviewed a Lotus Elise yet?
"I really wish you would have mentioned the voice control. Maybe you have not tried it yet, but the new Voice Control is one of the best in the Industry, you can literally conrol everything in the car with voice.

It actually blew my ming, its not a very smart one in terms of that you can talk naturally to it at the moment but I think it takes over 170 command to control things."
"Tbf, much larger cars have tiny seats too 

My family bought a land cruiser and those back seats were puny."
yeah- i certainly agree there. My friend's mom had a volvo wagon with rear facing seats when I was a child- I absolutely loved them as a kid and yeah I don't think we sat in them after we became teens...
I have a feeling row 2 will be redesigned like in the X for room.  The S just threw tiny seats in back tho
"Most?  A lot of us thought it was a joke too.  It's polarizing, I agree with him.  I might get it anyway, I like the retrofuture style but it needs tweaking."
"lmao- if i could only suddenly become rich enough... given that i and millions of others are now on unemployment with what assets i had blown away in the market crash the dream of owning a house or even a used Tesla is far, far away..."
"The time it takes to pop open the Tesla App and hit open frunk is comparable to the time it takes for the Siri shortcut to work.

It's super slow..."
People seem to dismiss or get mad at the idea but the model 3 key fob is much superior to the app
iOS has a widget very similar to this.
"As an Android person with a incoming Y, I'm glad to hear that!  Can you do any voice commands?"
I've read that features like that and the overhead 360 are licensed out by other auto manufacturers but tesla doesn't want to pay for it or doesn't have features patented to exchange out
Some people are impatient and have more money than brains.
"That's a bad sign for us bottom-feeders, but a good sign that Tesla is on the right track!"
Especially Right-Hand-Drive ones - hope there's a conversion kit available by then!
Don't let r/cars hear you saying that!
"You have a garage, no? You can also do an outdoor one in the driveway?"
"I don't have a home charger but have superchargers nearby. Charging hasn't ever really been an issue. With the Model 3P

40min once a week is all that's needed, and I can either youtube/netflix while it charges, or check out the stores near the charger (most superchargers are in/near shopping centers)"
This answer surprised me a bit.  At least you could make content about how to deal with charging if someone can not charge at home.. charge point/patrol station reviews:)
You can park in the driveway and just charge it through an extension cord.  Just get it rated for your charger (L1 will not add much range but likely will replenish whatever you use on a daily basis for a commute).  It is a fairly long range and therefore a big bank of energy.  Supercharge when needed.
"It's hard to imagine @ 3.44 million subscribers you don't just buy a house with a driveway.

"It looks like there isn’t even a headrest on the third row seats. Maybe they designed it for people without heads....

https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/d9jot2/looking_for_info_on_the_third_row_seats_for_model/"
Does the 66cf include the underfloor compartments and the frunk?
"Do you think the Model Y is a good competitor to midsize, 3-row crossovers like the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander ?

i watched you video on the Highlander and noticed the Highlander has a bit more features than the model Y like the window sunshades,DC charge port and the rear controllable climate control."
Easily gets a Doug Score of 69
I love dirty knees. They make a man so much more sexy.
"> BUT Doug do *quarks* and weird features so yea it is surprising he didnt mention it.

""And now on to the quantum physics portion of the review..."""
It isn't a weird feature or quirk. Basically every EV offers it. If I remember correctly Teslas and the bolt are the only EVs that don't offer it in any trim.
"Yeah, there’s a lot of interesting things with the Y that wasn’t mentioned, iirc he never mentioned the regenerative breaking system as that came out after his model 3 performance vid (the full stop and hold feature). However where I consider that a direct feature that consumers would love (no need to press brakes) the heat pump is nothing more than a feature that makes it more efficient to own an electric car, therefore it would be a feature that consumers would expect in a car if described to them. 

Completely understand him not getting into Tesla enthusiast facts, simply because the bottom line is the masses don’t care."
"Someone doesn't live in the north or a cold region. Heck in a lot of Nordic countries there are subsidies for installing heat pumps and going away from primitive electric heaters. They've been installed everywhere the past decade and is common knowledge. Sure if you go to Portugal or Mexico they most likely won't know much about them.

Also weird not to tout a green feature when the whole movement behind Tesla is to go green."
ITS GOT A FKN HEAT PUMP THO! /s
"It's a big feature for anyone who lives anywhere with climate.

Range anxiety is a bigger deal in the winter, and the current heating system doubles the power consumption."
It extends cold weather range by a lot! How is that not a huge feature? Would you rather have a 3 LR with 200 miles of cold weather range or a Y with 270 miles of winter range? Of course the Y. Big deal.
Doug is the reason I bought my Model 3. I think I knew more about the car than the Tesla rep because of Doug.
"Well, that is... true :("

"and youtube even gives you 1.25x and 1.5x as options , enough to make Chidi Anagonye go into infinite loop mode.

Nice depending on the speaker, for Example Trump actually sounds smarter on 1.25 or 1.5 but sounds funny/chipmunk like on 2x. Jack Rickard flips from talking too slow for 2x to make him normal to talking too fast for 1.25x and back to talking too slow for 2.x again.

For either of those two I tend to not watch the whole video so arguably the faster setting is better but if I have to rewind to understan what they said and close captioning didn't get it I'd rather do 1.25 and figure it out."
"Doug seems to have done it on all his recent videos, not just this one. 

I’m a fan of the old way, I like the summary with comments."
Tbh both are a bit odd looking imo.
Maybe they change they look of the 3red row. I'm not a Tesla purist by any means lol
Google Maps does have charging locations now.
What happened to actual scores in your reviews? Not even a final score no more?
"Pretty good. They're 8, 10, and 12. My youngest is a little one so she uses a booster still as well."
"the model 3 only has 2 ISOFIX mounts so i guess a third one needs to be strapped in with the regular seat belt.

Not convenient and not a good idea."
Not sure as my kids are older and only one needs a booster. I would say if you did you'd have to do two forward facing and one rear facing (in the middle) and it'd be tight. It seems the inside is larger but the seat base is the same as the 3. (Also up higher)
"I feel like it's noticeably quieter. It could also be the wheels.
Whenever I had my Aeros on I noticed a lot less wind noise.
Now with the turbine wheels it feels the same (noise wise)."
"Would love to hear how that goes. It’s just an ergonomic question for me. Is looking down and to the right natural when driving? Kinda, when I adjust my phone or radio, but not for basic info like my speed, odometer, and fuel/power remaining. I feel like this design keeps my eyes off road too long. Now if it was fully autonomous and required no inputs for most commutes/highway, then maybe I wouldn’t care so much."
"Model 3 owner here.

I was very skeptical of the lack of an instrument cluster at first as well, but not having one turns out to be  a *non issue*. Most of the pictures of the Model 3 interior makes it look like the screen is really far down and to your right, but it's not. The Model 3 has a *tiny* wheel and the screen is very high up and right next to the wheel. Your eyes barely have to move further to look at the top left of the screen than they would to look at an instrument cluster. The screen really, really does work just as well as an instrument cluster once you're used to it because of that.

That said, a HUD is *definitely* superior to either an instrument cluster or the Model 3 screen.

So while I wish the Model 3 had a HUDs, in no way, shape or form do I miss an instrument cluster."
They no longer have the in front driver dash info?
Think it was 250k. Believe it will only be one trim as well. Only add on would be FSD.

"Take a second to check it for yourself and you'll see the US page bundles ""potential savings"" into the price while the Canadian page shows purchase price without these potential savings by default. The US purchase price is $52,990 out the door, making it more expensive than the Canadian one when accounting for current exchange rates."
"Tesla's CAD prices are still closer to the previous 1.35 exchange rate than the current 1.45.  The difference is the US page bundles ""potential savings"" into the price while the Canadian page doesn't."
"Yeah, this has been true since the Model S (like I have). It's very silly to ask to turn them on, or the driver to ask ""do you want your seat heater on?""

I think the Model X has heaters for all 3 rows, which makes it even sillier.

I can't imagine building a button into the seat itself would be _that_ expensive, since the wiring is already run there for the heater."
"There should be a ""Tesla Passenger"" app. Hmmm..."
"I can’t understand this either. It would be so easy to add a button to the back of the center console near the USB ports. 

It is notable that you can also control all the climate functions from the app as well (even while the car is being driven). I can imagine someone at Tesla has a vision of the future where everyone has the Tesla app on their phone to summon a robotaxi like Uber/Lyft today. This would theoretically allow you to also control the climate in your robotaxi from your phone."
I want to see touch screens in the back of future Teslas. When I sit in the back I use the Tesla app to do it myself.
Could theoretically be done on the phone app. You could have a client phone app for passengers
"My rear passengers use the same cellphone they're using to watch Netflix to also control the temperature and the heated seats. To be honest, I believe the Tesla phone app is actually better than any UI I've seen in other cars for doing the same thing."
"Actually, the Tesla app does support activating the rear heated seats. But obviously, the rear occupant needs access to the app for that to work. Similarly, media control is available through this mechanism."
Alternatively if you have the app and are logged in you could do it on there.
"Hopefully when I get a Y, I'll be using those rear seat heaters for practical jokes. I remember my mum had a Ford StreetKa and experienced heated seats for the first time when she needed to borrow my 306. I was bombing around the M25 in it when I suddenly felt like I'd pissed myself. Turned out my mum left the heated seat on..."
[deleted]
"I don’t disagree, but my point was this seemed to surprise you. An additional screen or button for each seat adds very little cost, but it does add some complexity. And you may say it’s only three switches, but then where do you draw the line? Three switches, then dedicated mirror controls (like the S and X), rear passenger climate control - different people would draw the line at different places. My point is that Tesla drew the line at nothing - no dedicated controls other than the very basics. This is a  sore point for many who think they should have included an infrared wiper trigger rather than relying on the cameras. It is a relatively inexpensive part and just a few wires. It’s not a matter of cost necessarily, it goes against the design philosophy behind the car. You may agree or disagree but if you know anything about the car  and how it was conceived, it should not surprise you."
"Apologies, I didn’t phrase it specifically enough. With the enhanced leg room in the back would a rear facing car seat provide ample leg room to the passenger and driver."
Damn. For the price that doesn't look comfortable at all.
"I don't get why there are even comments about this. Do people not realize that park, drive, reverse, etc., are gears? 😂"
"Having driven a Model 3 for... 3 weeks, I do think it'd be great to have. My Tahoe has a heads up display projected onto the windshield and I love it. Speed & audio is what it's best for. I can see my speed & whats playing on the stereo without looking down. It's a *very* convenient feature to have."
"Maybe I'm in the minority, but I definitely wish my Model 3 had a HUD."
I agree with you. I missed it at the beginning but 2 yrs in I’m glad I have the road in front of me and info to my right when I need it.
Was it a head turner while driving it around?
"Clear trend no doubt, but for me a big disappointment...I'd love to see this trend reverse (we have too many overweight and over-sized vehicles on the road).

As great of a job as Tesla has done with the Y and think they're going to sell a lot more of them than 3s I will stick with my P3D+

Also I'll add, I dont find the Uberturbine wheels particularly attractive...."
"Yes, for sure, CUV market does have the majority, but there is still a significant volume of sedans as well. And even more so when looking beyond just the US.

To be fair, my friends are more into sportier cars that can handle the track rather than larger CUVs that can handle a family of 4+ :)"
"Hi, I don’t. So guess what? It’s not *everyone*. CUVs have the majority of the market for sure, but sedans still have a significant share."
no he didn’t. he only showed the trunk and space beneath
surprised it wasn’t shown
I know it was available off menu. Is it still available?
"hahahaha, aww. That's so funny. Thank you for telling me that! Big smile on my face."
"I personally don't love the styling. I prefer my SUVs to be boxy (hence my own - Land Rover Defender, Mercedes G-Wagen Cabrio), and I really hate the teardrop shape. I get why they do it (range/aero) but I personally don't love it.

I wish there was a heads-up display. I wish there were controls in back for heated seats. I wish the back seat was a bit wider. Build quality is a bit of a challenge; this one had a few minor issues I didn't mention since I think (hope?) they're one-off. If they do front-facing third-row seats, they're gonna be really small. 

Those are the ones that come to mind."
"Hah, OK, that's maybe a less diplomatic way of putting it, but I concur! haha"
"To the down voters, like .01 percent of the population knows what “Joe mode” is. Freaking Doug didn’t know. It is stupid to name a feature after a twitter conversation."
He's old.  The stooges were around for like 30 years when Besser filled in.  Shemp died and Curly had a stroke by then.
That's awesome. It's an amazing car. I just hope the wait isn't too long!
"Sometimes I do think about this. Like the Vector, the XJ220, cars like that especially. Hopefully people in 50 years can access these videos somehow and laugh at how we all thought Teslas were futuristic compared to what they have in 2070!"
Thank you! :) I appreciate it!!
"Aww, thank you. I really appreciate that -- those are the highest compliments I receive, from non-car people who watch. I really, really do sincerely appreciate it."
"> Also THANK YOU Doug for not asking me to smash that like button, hit that notification bell or ask me subscribe etc.

Hahaha yeah WTF. I've never understood this. I've never asked people to do that, many big YouTubers don't, and yet somehow magically my viewers have found the subscribe button 😂

Hahaha, you might be the only person whose favorite reviews are the Spyker, the Vector, and ..... the ODYSSEY!!!"

"Yes, it was a press car. I do, maybe, one press car every month or two, on average. Probably about 10 to 12 a year. 

However, as an example, for that C8 event: all the other journalists were flown there, picked up at the airport in luxury cars, and put up for a night or two in a nice Vegas hotel before getting track time. I drove my own car, paid for my own hotel, and drove the C8 on public roads. I don't want to owe anything to anyone, ever.

The result of this is that I truly do not care, at all, if I get banned from press cars -- I have dozens of contacts where I can borrow cars if automakers ban me for not being positive enough. Many other 'journalists' in my industry, however, would have nowhere else to turn."

I think's Doug's next Tesla will be the Model S PLAID.

I'm so excited for tri-motor!"
"He reviewed the Model X -- which is quite different, admittedly, but also quite similar in a lot of ways."
"Aww, thanks. I appreciate that. I'm thrilled to be able to provide some entertainment right now during this crazy period."
"The third row on the Land Cruiser were not super spacious, but they still had sufficient leg room where I - a 6'1"" person - could comfortably sit for long car rides. I don't even think I'd be able to get my calf in the Model Y's third row. Even the Model X third row is somewhat tight."
"Maybe, but from the video it seems like headroom will also he an issue for the third row in the Y. I’m still holding out hope that they will make the seats rear facing, or at least some how reversible. I don’t think captain’s seats would work well in the Y, seems like they would just make it feel even smaller."
The market will rebound. Hopefully employment does too.
have you tried not being poor?
"Really? Interesting. I'm not a Tesla owner (yet) so I only know what I've seen in videos. Hopefully, future iOS updates speed up the execution of Shortcuts. Thanks for the info!"
Do people not have the option on the Android notification to open the Front and Rear Trunk? [Like this?](https://i.imgur.com/qUzmSzD.png)
Called?
"I haven't tried any voice commands, sorry!  I imagine there are some 3rd party apps that can probably do it but I haven't looked for a solution because the notification unlock is good enough for me."
"Haha yeah, owning a Tesla in NZ seems like such a distant dream ."
"I have a garage, but it's occupied by two more significant cars; I have no driveway. 

Trust me, I've thought about it a lot. My hope is that someday the city allows me to install some sort of charger at the curb (or bypass the sidewalk in some way, i.e. trenching under), but currently that's prohibited."
lol no one's going to kick a Ford GT out of the garage to make room for a Model Y.
I think I saw a photo somehwere with the headrests that retract inside of the seat.
"What I remember about the 3 is that the figure didn't include the froot nor the hidden boot compartment. The Y in comparison has a deeper froot, (possibly a deeper hidden boot?), and a second hidden boot compartment that the 3 doesn't have."
"In terms of interior, I'd say the Highlander Platinum would win out. Plus it has more physical controls for rear passengers which families might like.

I have a Ford Fusion Energi Titanium and it definitely feels (and sounds) more solid than the 3. The 3 obviously has the cooler tech and better screen."
"*""The Doug Demuro has a Doug Score© of 69, placing him very high in the human segment of living species. Overall, the appearance really makes the Doug stand out, which I gave a 10/10. However, the Doug is really lacking in the ""being boring"" category, and I only give him a 1/10.""*"
"that regenerative breaking is also not really a feature as its absolute standard for  EV´s.

Also its more efficient to let the car roll when possible than it is to start the regen by default."
Also they change frequently.
I think I was getting ~80 miles of range in my P3D this winter in Chicago. No joke.
I read this comment at 1.5x lol
"Lol we are part of a very small populous who thinks the 3 is not that great looking. 

I just don't think Porsches look all that great, and the 3 is clearly inspired by them. 

My personal taste: Corvette c7 is one of the most beautiful looking cars imo."
And charger route planning? I never knew that
Awesome. Thanks for sharing!
Bummer.
I said they don't have a HUD.They do have an instrument cluster.
"Not true, Musk has talked about cold air boosters that would replace the rear seats as part of the SpaceX package. I believe Founder's Edition is $250K, but base price is $200K."
"You're probably right :)  I only remember seeing 200,000 somewhere ."
Delivery is not the same as import costs
">I'm not sure why I was downvoted for asking though.

It happens."
I think you’re under estimating how much complexity costs. As Musk once said regarding a space x rocket “the best system is no system”
"My only car is a shitty stick shift so yes, I didn’t immediately think of p/d/r as gears. 😢"
"Apologies if this is a bit pedantic...

In a Tesla, PRND are not actually “gears”. 

Shifting from “Reverse” to “Drive” only changes the direction current is applied to the motor and therefore the direction the motor spins. “Neutral” disables the motor (and regen braking). “Park” sets the parking brake (there may be a parking pawl in the transmission too). 

There ARE gears in the transmission, but this is just a static reduction ratio (I think it’s 9:1) so the motor operating range is well matched to normal driving speeds."
"No, even other Tesla drivers didn't notice it. Not one single person did. And the owner told me he took it to a supercharger and nobody there noticed, either.

Frankly I'm not surprised -- it looks really similar to the 3 and the X, and it's not a big splash in terms of design."
The model 3 weighs more than most suvs
"I wonder if it would have been possible to have a model 3 with a hatch instead of a trunk? I.e. copy the hatch and rear window design as far as possible from the Y, but keep the 3 profile and size.

That would make it a lot more practical imo, and wouldn't involve any of the loss of aerodynamics or increase in weight of the Y over the 3, and thus hopefully keep the longer range of the 3. Obviously there are design considerations, like the aesthetics of the hatch hinge position, and the strength / rigidity of the body if there is a large open hatch section compared to a small trunk opening.

The 3 is generally a good size and style, it just lacks practicality for cargo, even though it could have a decent amount of room with the rear seats folded, if the trunk opening was large enough for bulkier items."
"I already own an AWD 3 and, if I could trade across without losing much, I would. I think it would end up costing me $15k-$20k to make that swap. Not worth it for such a large hit."
Don't stop the video early. 20:40
Watch it again. He shows it when going over the screen controls. He opens the frunk and shows the inside. Stop arguing.
Yep.
"> Big smile on my face.

And that's so Doug - always love the enthusiasm. The joy that you have in your videos comes right through the screen man. Keep that up. 

Loved the Audi Allsroad crushing video. And always think about you when i see those stupid Mercedes Metris pass by."
Would you like a Tesla CYBERVAN then (if it was ever made)? Basically same styling as the CYBERTRUCK but a bit bigger than the Model X.
Thanks.
"Would you consider Cybertruck boxy enough? Haha :D This comment is mostly for fun, not for you to seriously buy one."
You can use voice commands to turn on the rear heated seats.
"First, thanks so much for doing what you do!  I am someone that currently owns a Range Rover and agree with what you said from a styling stand point.  My biggest concern when considering the Y is the interior cabin.  It seems no where near the same level of luxury I have come to expect.  In your opinion, would that be a deal breaker for someone not overly considered with a 0-60 time or speed?"
"I agree with the heads up display and rear controls. Not deal breakers though. I dig the looks, especially knowing it’s for efficiency. Excellent overview video doug as usual"
"Great critique!  I wish they would do a HUD also, looking to the right is... odd."
"Long time viewer, first time 2 way communicator! Why did some give you grief about your Tesla comment about the heads up display? Are there some purists who knock heads up displays?

And why is Tesla delaying release of that third row?

Maaan, I grew up on Land Rovers as functional workhorses. I'd love one but horrible mileage and parts/labor work. But I'll get it one day as a Sunday Defender and will call it the ""Dougie"" (Cause, Joe)."
"Doug, on the Canadian site for the Model Y, they seem to show the [rear seats as forward facing](https://imgur.com/a/nVp52OL). I'm not sure how much room there can possibly be back there with that config. From your experience, do you think that you could fit three car seats in the back seats?"
"You say you get why they make it ""tear-drop shaped"" - do you think they're valid reasons to shape the future of car design? Would you accept that it's a better way forward or will you always be holding onto your boxy designs, wishing modern manufacturers would do the same thing again, despite inefficiency?"
"I am a Model 3 owner.

Before I bought the Model 3 I was pricing out Mustang GT's but couldn't pull the trigger because of practicality.

I wasn't considering the Model 3 because I was iffy on it's style. Looked too soft to me.

I have owned the car for just over a year now and the looks have grown on me so much. Some angles it's still a little off but most angles are sexy.

My next car will either be a Model 3 or Model Y once they are able to up the range to over 300 at 90% charge in a performance trim."
"> Mercedes G-Wagen Cabrio)

Literally one of the ugliest vehicles on the planet.  Unless you are into Suzuki styling..."
"Interesting! I personally love that all the info is displayed on the center screen in my Model 3. 
A hud would be unnecessary and distracting imo."
"Tbh I feel that as a fan of yours, I'd expect and want you to call out any quality issues with any (new, obviously) car you review, and I'm disappointed to hear that you brushed some under the rug."
You should make a video about those criticisms...
"It's so weird seeing them that old. I never really watched anything after the Curly years (which, I think everyone can agree, were the best ones)."
Well now I'm sold on the Tesla!
"THIS is an under-appreciated assessment. When I reread old car magazines (periodically, you could say) or watch old Top Gear/Motorweek/etc., the thing that jumps out at you is that so much is taken for granted. The baseline assumption is that the reader/viewer knows the general tech of the day and so they don't focus on the minute details and design features/bugs/vanity cues/quirks at all.  Doug takes a much more holistic view of the car's place in the market it was sold in, but then dives deep, VERY DEEP, into all the nuances unique to that vehicle. A precious time capsule, and many thanks to you sir, for your diligence."
"I loved that video on the Vector. I remember seeing it as a kid and thinking it was really cool looking, but not really paying much attention to it since it was never as popular as the Diablo, McLaren F1, F40, etc. But it has so many quirks and features I never knew about!"
"Awesome man, anybody know how to set a reminder?"
"Cool, always neat to hear how the backend of these businesses work.  Always love your videos, keep them coming!"
Thanks for your response. I’ve learned more about cars though your channel than any other source. Must be nice to have a true dream job.
But you do old cars all the time! 😬
"Paper wealth is gone from market collapse.  Real wealth is too from covid job losses.  We're in a mini depression from this.  All of us, you too even if you haven't been hit hard yet."
"Yeah. The bottleneck is iOS.

I’ve also tried Siri shortcut voice commands from my Apple Watch to toggle sentry mode, lock/unlock car, and open/close chargeport—and while it’s cool for the futuristic novelty factor, it’s so slow/finicky that it’s usually just faster to open the app, and/or interact with the car directly."
"It is slow, but using the shortcut is way more convenient than using the app. I can usually hit the shortcut widget quickly and pocket my phone as I’m walking to my car, and the frunk opens right as I walk up to it if I time it right. Otherwise I need unlock my phone, open the app, wait for the car to wake up, and finally hit the frunk control before I can put the phone back in my pocket."
That would involve having own an android device 🙄 :)
If you swipe to the widget screen and use the “edit” button on the bottom you can just add it if you have the Tesla app installed on your iPhone.  It’s just part of the Tesla app on iOS.
That's annoying. Best of luck. It's not as if you don't already have a nice selection anyways
I did this. worth it.
"If they ever get FSD working right (3 years maybe, 6 years definitely) You may summon your Tesla from a nearby charger while eating a sandwich filled with Grey Poupon and caviar."
[deleted]
"That's odd.  when you said ""I don't have anywhere to charge it"" I assumed no off-street parking.  But you do have a garage... so I guess the answer isn't that you don't have anywhere to charge it, but that owning a Tesla isn't a priority for you, because if it was you'd make room in that garage!"
"My dad’s charger has a 20 foot cable. It’s long enough where he can park in the driveway and charge his M3 (his garage is full of boxes).

Not sure about whether this works with your layout."
"They will after their first service bill... 

If not the first, definitely the second."
"I never considered until right now that countries where it's called a boot instead of a trunk would use froot instead of frunk.  It looks so strange, but I get it I guess..."
"You're not going to make ""froot"" happen, dude."
"Personally, I really like the look of Porsches. The Model 3, while it is Porsche-ish, I think looks a bit too bulbous towards the back and overall just kinda, ""meh"".

And yes the C7 is a damn good looking car."
Oh damnit I used the wrong word choice. Forgive me.
[deleted]
"> Apologies if this is a bit pedantic...

One of the most pedantic comments I've ever gotten actually! 😂

Of course they're not gears, you also no longer ""roll down"" the window and most cars I drive no longer have a ""key"" -- but actual plain spoken language is different from technical terminology, and I will *always* prioritize commonly understood language over technical terms, unless it's just flat-out wrong."
"They’re *technically* not ‘gears’, but even Tesla officially refers to them as such"
That's fascinating
"I wouldn't go as far as to say ""most"" but yes, many.  Weight is probably one of my biggest complaints with the Model 3 (lighter battery tech cant come soon enough IMHO).  All Teslas are at least good about keeping the weight low and evenly distributed."
Nice
hahaha. Thank you! I watched that Allroad crush the other day -- a nice distraction right now.
Personally I’d love something in the space of the navigator L getting 500 mile range with 60-70 mpge
"Not to speak for him, but Doug has previously stated on his second channel that he is not a fan at all of the design of the CT. Maybe his opinion may have changed since then, but when it came out he did not."
but you still need to press the screen or wheel to input the voice command....
"Probably. Tesla interiors are definitely not the nicest in the business. People love them for being minimalist, and I can definitely see that argument -- but if a high-quality cabin is a real priority, definitely look elsewhere. An X7 or Range Rover interior compared to a Model X is night and day."
I have a model 3. It takes a couple weeks to get used to looking to the right. Not a big deal.
"I will happily give up range to have the car look how I prefer. I don't need a 320-mile range in my life; 250 would do just fine for me. And frankly 150 would be fine for 95% of humans, even if they won't admit it to themselves.

Those that want a different look are penalized for the ""range wars"" which are pointless for most people. With that said, if I was an automaker, I'd do the same thing. But as a consumer, I can complain about it!"
"Let’s be real here.  Once battery costs come down and capacity goes up enough, it won’t matter nearly as much, and carmakers can build cars that look like a shipping container without much concern.  But for now, nobody is going to be able to compete with the specs vs. cost of these Teslas unless they use an aerodynamic shape"
I personally like the Porsche Cayenne model Y look
"I always find it so funny when people say this to me, as if they're trying to pick a fight with me. I called it [one of the ugliest cars ever made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rs0khSZ72Xs) in my own video where I revealed it! And I routinely make fun of it on Twitter and Instagram.

I don't take car stuff personally, unlike so much of the internet."
"Right?  I wanted a HUD until I got the car and got used to enjoying the wonderful visibility and unobstructed view over the front of the car.  Now I think a HUD would actually bother me.  The edge of the screen with speed and blinkers type info is within peripheral vision anyways, and much less of a look away from the road than people think"
"You have to be careful doing that stuff, because a lot of time quality issues on new cars can be totally anecdotal. It's unfair to say something negative about a car, in general, when a car, singular, has an issue. I've seen little things on the very first few examples of cars from a *LOT* of brands I've reviewed, and I generally stay quiet unless it's clearly a trend."
"Curly is best but I think he was after original Shemo right?  Then curly had a stroke in ww2 and shemp came back then Joe, then ""curly Joe"""
hahaha. The only solution is both!
"Aww, thank you. I do pinch myself basically every day -- I really do think it's a dream job. I appreciate that."
Gotcha. I appreciate the insight. Cheers!
Yup same experience here.  I use @teslastatsapp which allows you to save custom phrases as commands which is fun but too slow.
"Thanks, it hadn’t occurred to me to use that featured or this."
"That's actually not a terrible idea, and I had never considered it."
"Correct. I am a car enthusiast more than anything, and I have two very valuable and rare cars that live in my garage. The Tesla would be a very good daily driver for my situation, but it's not my priority."
"Not necessarily, perhaps he rents a garage a few miles from home."
He's not gonna park his Ford GT or his Land Rover NAS Defender outside....
No.  Froot is an abomination and must be stamped out *right the fuck now*!
"Where I am it would just translate as ""luggage space"" with no distinction between the front and back. In English, we would say something is under/in the bonnet. I think saying 'froot' would get some weird looks."
"""Bulbous towards the back"" sounds like a good design for idk... An suv 

Xd"
Why would they itemize individual parts that need to be shipped? They don't have manufacturing in Canada like they do in the US
"I'm not sure if I should wear this as a badge of honor or shame. I hate to be ""that guy"" who takes things so far into the weeds about a detail that doesn't really matter.

The volume and quality of your content (even for just-released cars) is remarkable. You cover a ton of details in these videos while keeping it approachable to everyone, including a large non-english speaking audience.  With the breadth and depth of your coverage, I think it's remarkable how clearly you describe everything you encounter. This is especially true considering you don't have a massive production team behind you for writing, fact-checking, editing, etc.  

I can only think of a few times where I've heard something technical that didn't sound right (e.g., hydraulics vs. pneumatics when talking about door/trunk struts), but it never affected the point you were making.

Clearly the way you write and speak about cars resonates with your audience.  Keep 'em coming.  We could all use a bit of a distraction right now."
"Good point. Over the years, the “gear” terminology has become so ingrained with how we think about forward/reverse that is now a convenient way to talk about changing direction. 

It’s a bit like clicking an icon of a disc to save a file. Even though you’re not using an actual disc, that iconography is universal and well understood."
"I live in Brazil. Never saw a Toyota Previa before. You made a video. next day in the morning, I saw a previa going around. so bizarre hahaha"
I like how neutral you are will all car makers. Like you have no bias at all. Keep it up!
What do you do that you need to drive a literal house?
"Yeah I saw that. I would be willing to bet that a lot of people who were initially shocked at the design will come around once it starts hitting streets and being seen in person. Not ALL of those people, but a lot of them, maybe including Doug, maybe not."
“Hey Elon” coming in next software update haha
"Yes but it’s worth knowing rather than saying to millions: “you have to go through the menus”, as the only way."
I want a HUD for a few things.  I only use glasses for reading so when I drive without them the smaller items on the screen are a little hard to see.  Small complaint for a car I love.
">hat's awesome. It's an amazing car. I just hope the wait isn't too long!

Get the Tesla first, you may not feel like buying the Vette after."
"I’m assuming your GT and Defender? Do you not keep the Cabriolet at home? I try to catch all your videos, but still don’t remember off of the top of my head what cars you have currently.

As says everyone else-love your videos, Doug! And I’m super happy for you and the billion views!"
What do you have in the garage?
Sometimes sacrifices need to be made. 👀
*Grabs torch & pitchfork*
I put froot from the market in the frunk frequently.  Fixed.
"I mean, you're not wrong."
"> I'm not sure if I should wear this as a badge of honor or shame. 

Honestly, honor. Don't worry about it, I think it's fine! And I laughed at your comment; when I was writing the one you replied to, I was wondering if someone might mention it!!

Thank you for the kind words, though, really -- I appreciate it. What a bizarre time to be alive, and I'm happy that I get to continue on with so many people watching and following along."
I don't think you understand the word literal. But having a big car makes road trips very enjoyable when you have a bunch of kids and carseats and dogs.
They definitely need to make font size for things user configurable
"> I’m assuming your GT and Defender? Do you not keep the Cabriolet at home? 

Indeed, or the G Cabriolet. The Defender and G kinda rotate. But either way, the garage is full. What I *REALLY* need is more garage space! haha

> As says everyone else-love your videos, Doug! And I’m super happy for you and the billion views!

Thank you! That was a huge milestone, I still can barely believe it."
"A Ford GT and LR Defender. 

The GT alone is worth $250-350k. I'm not up to date on Defender prices but they're not cheap and I'm pretty sure he keeps the roof off at all times."
Yes please
You need a hoovie garage.
">I’m assuming your GT and Defender? Do you not keep the Cabriolet at home?  
>  
>Indeed, or the G Cabriolet. The Defender and G kinda rotate. But either way, the garage is full. What I REALLY need is more garage space! haha

When Elon started driving his Roadster, he sold all his cars but his Ferrari's. 6 months later he sold them as well.

\- The obvious solution!"
He paid 70k for the Defender. It's probably steady.
"Was it on a credit card? If so, doesn’t count 😂"
Free Supercharger?
What? Is that a model 3 for ants?
I did pay cash for my P3D. Got really lucky with some shares I bought a decade back and forgot about when the company was sold recently and I made enough to pay for the car. Nothing like owning it outright with no payments to make.
Bought a paint set for my Bob Ross costume last year and had all this paint left over. Didn’t know what to do with it until I started seeing these Tesla hot wheels. I painted a couple of them. A grey and a blue. Wasn’t too hard. Paint it the color of your model 3! If it’s not red.
"I guess I could too if I wanted to... Hot Wheels 2019 Hw Green Speed Tesla Model 3 226/250, Maroon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WNSPG4Z/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_YAhyEbAGVSHCQ"
"Not gonna lie


He had me in the first half."
"And you sprung for aftermarket wheels too. You balling, playa."
Where’s the white interior!!!
Where can I buy one of these?
Imagine how good you’ll feel paying off a stranger’s M3 just for commenting on your post
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
"Hey I was wondering, mine says it’s 1 of 42.
I doubt they only made 42 though. Does yours say?"
What scale is that
Tesla in ATL only allowed 5k on credit card (Discover) not counting the extra I paid for additional key cards.
How do you juice up?
"first i was jealous, then i lol'd"
"Bought my BF a red T3 last week....hot wheels car...comes with an rfid chip to race it in a phone game lol.

Only way I will ever be able to afford to get him a Tesla lol."
Hah! Me too. Mine’s white. :-)
"Is a *model* model 3 in the picture? If so is it useing an RF *Model*? Can you *Model* it for us later?
Lol"
"With interest rates at all time lows, it seems weird to park all that cash in a depreciating asset. To each their own, I guess."
Congrats. But I personally would rather borrow at 2-3% understanding I could get a higher ROI with this same dollars elsewhere.
Why would you do that?  Interest rates are so cheap....throw that money in Tesla stock and get a free car in a year
"Shoot man, why u gotta call me out like that?!


Gotta get the 1% cash back baby!"
"Missed the Free Supercharger promo...however, did get 1000 pushing powered miles"
Fit well with my ant salary
How do you expect them to drive if they can’t even fit inside the car?!
I understand this!
I am sure I am going to be downvoted to hell for this question but gotta ask. Why would you buy a car in cash when you can get a loan around 4% and invest the rest of the money and get 8%+?
"Ooooo, good idea!

Waiting for my blue M3P+ to be deliver, will paint it that color once it gets delivered"
"I already have got three at home, Red, Grey, White! Sadly I have to go down in scale to drive..."
"Set me back a few months of savings, but I think the ride quality are worth it"
They give you one free when you buy the real Tesla.
"Got it off 3Bay for $30 (+tax) shipped. Others were going for $70-$100, so thought I got a good deal. Something I can put in my office so I can imagine driving it"
"They definitely made more than 42 of these.

Mine has 1/43, which is the scale of the diecast"
1/43
"What can I say, I got oodles of cash"
"If the money I used to pay for this can grow to pay for a real one, I'll be Warren Buffet Jr."
I tried buying my used 2016 e-golf ($12k) on my Amex plat... bit the dealership wouldn’t let me. They only allow $5k on cards...but I talked them into $7500. Let’s see what Tesla says when I pick up a mode y...
Haha cheers
"I’m not sure if that’s sarcasm, but assuming you can pay in full and assuming they would allow a credit card payment, that 100% is the way to go. That’s some serious free rewards."
What noise do you make when you push it along?
"Guessing you must take out loans for 100s of k at 4%, invest it at 8% and pocket the profit?

Makes you wonder why loan companies bother lending at 4% when it's so easy to make a safe 8% return?"
"Please share where to get that 8%. I mean, mutual funds or SPF or just say the name, I'll do more research. 
Definitely not stocks- my luck and stocks don't go along well.

TIA"
I did consider taking a loan but they aren't 4% here. I just checked and the best I could find here was 9.5% and they range up to 19.5%. This is from major banks secured on the car. Finance companies are far worse with some hitting nearly 30%. I checked with my accountant and she said if I had the cash I should pay with that rather than trying to game the system with loans and investments. The money was a lucky event from an investment I never expected to pay out anyway.
Downvoted for common sense
" Because if you can pay for a $60k car with cash, you don’t care about making a few percent on that little amount of money.  It would be like saying why pay for groceries with cash when you can take out a loan and invest your grocery money?

Either that, or you got lucky like this guy and don’t know how to manage money :p"
Because lucky people = \ = smart people
"it’s not unreasonable to predict that the market will net down over the next 4 years.

guaranteed 4% return isn’t a bad part of a portfolio now."
This post didn’t age well!
DM me if you want some tips! And congrats!
"I got one with my 3, too. Last July."
Used to? Or still do? Bought in October and wasn't offered one.
I didn't get one in June :(
"damn, most of them on there are $100-$300!"
Thanks! I just looked at mine and it’s actually 43. I wasn’t wearing my glasses
It did for me....~$200 a share though....but with Coronavirus putting us into recession having cash on hand to invest is much better than saving 2%/year on interest....
"The merchant services fees for AMEX transactions are awful for businesses.  Somewhere between the cost of the product and the price you pay is a profit margin that gets eaten into by merchant services fees if you pay with a card.

AMEX kills a lot of the profit, which is why so few businesses accept it versus VISA and MC.  Discover is second worst in merchant services fees."
I tried and they wont take it. You can buy FSD on your credit card later if you have to pay tax on it anyway.
"My uncle used a big chunk using discover card with 0%APR for few months. (Even for existing customer, this 0% APR is available). Rest is loan."
Got 30c back as reward on my $30 purchase...still better than nothing!
^eeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeee EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Depending on the pavement
"Banks are looking for different things than just the return (cashflow, total lendings, etc)"
What. What is your credit score? I was approved for $50K at 2.3% APR.
Lol troll. If you are that short term I imagine your one of the burned shorts.
I believe it was for early reservation holders
Maybe contact your tesla dealership?  I picked up my Tesla with two kids in tow and they gave one to each child.

I weren't in a hurry so was able to find one that's reasonably priced."
"Not sure if you saw my other posts or the pictures...but this cost me $30...so not sure how much Tesla stock will have to be for my $30 to be able to payoff the car, lol...ticker price to the moon!!!!"
What most people don’t know is that higher tiered MC and VISA cards also have high (and in some cases higher) fees when compared to AMEX. A VISA Infinite Privilege card can in some cases cost the vendor more to accept than an AMEX charge card.
"Businesses not accepting AMEX is outdated. Yes, that was true 20+ years ago, but I use my Amex as my daily card, and have never been turned down in the last 5 years."
"Everyone doesn't live in the USA. Different countries have different systems so you shouldn't assume everywhere has such cheap money. I can easily borrow a lot of money as I have very little debt and earn a lot for where I live but even so, car loans are expensive."
"lol...funny, you get that free when you buy a real one though, still have mine sitting in my car from purchase....smh"
It’s useless in most of Europe and Asia. You absolutely cannot bring just an AMEX. You can’t even really count on it as a backup. VISA/Master works everywhere.
"You must not eat at hole-in-the-wall restaurants then. My AMEX card got denied in more than half of the places I went to eat, not to mention that Costco doesn’t take AMEX either. 

Horrible experience for me, and will probably be the only card I’ve ever canceled in my life."
I didn't realize loans were so much higher elsewhere.
"Lots of stuff costs a lot outside the US but at least we have healthcare. Also, fuel here costs more than double what it does in the US so an EV is much easier to justify. My old MINI used to cost me around $120 a fill and it would do around 600km on that. My Model 3 costs $15 to fully charge and will easily hit 500km with a mixture of driving. Running cost of a petrol car is easily 10x higher than an EV so there's that."
Yeah I pay $320/m for healthcare... That's before any deductibles before treatment/prescription. That's usually another $25/$50/$125
I actually pay a similar amount although it covers my entire family and I don’t always need to use it but the additional cover gets me priority treatment which I need as I work as a contractor and can’t afford too much time dealing with health issues. I don’t really need it as our health system is very good but I like the extra cover. That’s the thing with socialised medicine is you get both full cover and the option to pay more for quicker treatment but no one is left without healthcare and no one goes bankrupt because they get sick. We pay a little more tax but the benefits far outweigh that. Of course saying socialised to Americans sounds terribly communist but you have socialised services like the police and military. Not to mention the freeways which aren’t free but are paid for out of taxes so they’re socialised too. Medicine shouldn’t be any different. But don’t tell Trump supporters that.
How did it handle the snow? Dual motor?
I recognize that ass anywhere!
looks better than mine did at the end of december  [https://i.imgur.com/6oKRn9P.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6oKRn9P.jpg)
That’s a great picture!
Did the autopilot radar worked in the snow?
The aerodynamics of the model 3 is fascinating because my model 3's rear basically has the same pattern after a rain.
The snow collects like that on mine too up here in central New York State.
Evergreen?  More like Everwhite am I right guys?
"Looks awesome, did you do a test drive before you purchased? Thinking about replacing my 2011 subaru impreza hatchback for the m3 awd long range."
this passed the vibe check
Powder coating...
How is no one asking about battery depletion. That thing must have gone through a full charge in a day
"Yep dual motor. With a good set of winter tires (Pirelli Sottozeros), it’s a tank. Been super impressed with the way it handles."
"...you can do side-bends or situps, but please don't lose that butt!"
It’s crying
Gross
Radar was fine but I would get this message intermittently : https://imgur.com/gallery/vegPSVz
Here’s a better view showing the aero : https://imgur.com/gallery/WYK3uvq
I go through a full charge in a day driving into the mountains and back all the time. Luckily CO has decent supercharger coverage
"""With a good set of winter tires"" <- this is the right answer"
I can hear the Crowded House!
"Looks awesome. Too close to the curb, though."
"Man white looks soooo good, wish I got it instead of dusty-all-the-time Black.  Grats on your new ride!"
If you let it park it’s self it will park very close to the curb. I hit the curb with mine twice. Learned to back up to the curb never forward. You can see the curb much better backing in. I have a white model 3 all wheel extended. You will love it!
When did you order?
Can you take a pic of your side mirror so we can see if these latest production still has auto dim side mirrors? I keep watching model Y videos and they all claim that model 3s don't come with auto dim mirrors any more which I don't believe. Also maybe let us know your build date?
Where is this?
Just got mine last week in San Francisco. They said there were only a few left and wasn’t expecting many more. How many are available after the factory shut down?
"We also have a white Tesla 3.  You'll notice the rear of the car for whatever reason gets seriously dirty after a week or so. We have to hose the back off once a week. It's annoying. Still love the car, however."
Wow that's awesome! I've never heard of that happening
"Jealous. 
Ours is stuck at a dealer in NJ that is on lock down with the rest of the state."
Thought they delivered them with no front plate?   I don’t plan to ever add mine
"NICE. I love the white

I got my M3 used in red and I'm a little annoyed. It costed the original owner extra and it's too flashy, attracts cops"
What part of stay inside aren’t you getting?
"Yeah I have to admit, after reading through people's experiences with curb rash, it does seem rather close doesn't it"
Curb rash got me once when I first had the car. Luckily it was only a $40 fix and it’s barely noticeable now. Learned my lesson!
Maybe he can drive ?
"Thank you! I mostly got white because it was the cheaper option (and that it falls under the luxury car tax where I live... Otherwise it would've been an extra $4,000)"
"It does look good, though I got the black/black and love it.  I wash it myself and then wipe it down with a soft cloth and man that’s just slick for a couple days."
"They both have downsides when getting dirty! I have white and my roommate has black. Although his ends up looking dusty, mine gets dirty from driving through water now that it’s been raining somewhat often where I’m from"
Great advice! I definitely feel more comfortable reversing than driving forward when parallel parking!
"I received the car about 10 days after ordering. It was initially estimated May but with COVID-19, I think many buyers have pulled out to retain cash (not a bad idea tbh... But the drive is so damn fun!)"
"Hmm... How can you tell? https://imgur.com/a/baL6uV5

Build is 2020 Jan (no frunk hooks ;3;)"
Not in the US of A ;)
"I don't think anyone in the public really knows. I did ask the delivery person and she said that there is a reserve stock in our country but yeah, nothing more coming in the near future"
"Pearl white owner; same problem here. Had someone explain to me it’s because the real axles on the 3 are closer to the tail end of the car, so dirt gets whipped up more directly to the back (rather than under the car when the rear axles are further in front)."
The dealership closed because of COVID-19 and I think they were trying to get all deliveries done by the end of the week. Unfortunately I have to keep working during the week and couldn't pick it up so they delivered it :)
California is on lock down but the dealer is open in San Francisco?
California is on lock down but the dealer is open in San Francisco?
"Ah, sad to hear :( I hope you can get yours soon. Driving it is definitely a mood lifter in these current times"
Hmm dunno... Might be because different countries different rules :/
"But the red goes faster, vroom vroom! On the flip side, it also attracts higher premiums..."
"Different country so we're not under strict quarantine like the USA. I do understand your outrage as I should be staying at home anyway but I'm an essential worker so I have to go to work :(

Addit: please don't down vote the guy,  he has a very legitimate point and we should all stay indoors as much as possible."
"even though he explained his situation, he could work for an essential company. not everyone gets to work from home or have a leave of absence. maybe dont be so rude next time."
How do you like your car? Did you get to drive it far?
"Ugh, yeah. Something about the driver's position along the wheel base and the turning radius feels unintuitive. 

Put a little gank in my LR wheel navigating a parking garage lane the first week. Alas."
"I don't understand people worrying about that

Like of course wheels will probably get scuffed"
I curb rashed my wife's on the 4th drive. I bought touch up paint so only I will probably notice. But it hurt.
Thats how were tough to park in The Netherlands lol
"The OP definitely can. I can drive too, but I am simply afraid of scratching my rims)) I did it only twice, on the second day while parking and in the 6th month of ownership while driving, and it looks ugly."
you got lucky. black used to be the free option and white was an extra 2k last year.
"White used to be more money!  It's a multicoat also, seems like it's just all around better than the black paint.  Looks badass anyways, I like how the lights look dark and those vents on the front are black, adds more contrast"
Yeah I do love my black right after I wash it ;)
Yeah my old car was black and was a huge magnet for dust. One of the perks of getting the white eh? :)
"Oh man! Yep mine has a perimeter piece that goes around the mirror and can auto dim. I also don't have frunk hooks. Nor frunk mat. I guess I'm lucky because i can buy home link and mats 

[My mirror](https://i.imgur.com/TXfj7Eo.jpg)"
Ahh.. understood. Thanks
YES! I've noticed that too! I'm gonna keep a cloth and bottle of water in the boot for this (and for bird poop)
Same sentiments as pretty much every other Tesla owner: can't ever go back to ICE.
Me too! I'm currently driving a bit too close to driver's side of the lane (right side for me)
F
":o maybe I’m just a car guy or very lucky? I haven’t ever curbed my rims once driving, I feel as if I know where my tire are at all times not saying you guys don’t but like literally where they are to the point I can get cm away."
I heard! Was definitely tossing up between those two colours. I think white with red brake callipers narrowly edged out the black. Unfortunately I don't have the performance so will need to get it done after market. Don't get the luxury of obtaining aftermarket parts as easily as you guys in the US :P Also weak currency means everything is super expensive (+ shipping)
Definitely agree!
"Oooh I see I see (took awhile, had to zoom in). Do you find it helps a lot compared to the previous vehicle you drove?"

Prospective buyer here. How quickly after the purchase or order of a Tesla do you start having to use terminology like ICE and HVAC etc? In the world I am currently living those are just called “cars” and “AC” and/or “heat”
"When driving through traffic I'm very good at maneuvering in tight spaces. Parking between two other vehicles? No problem. Parallel parking though? Fuck me. 

I can usually get close enough to not be a big deal. Otherwise I'm too far out or hitting the curb. 

My brother pulls into tight parking spots at higher speeds than I'd dream of and it's perfect every time. 

Some people have that talent and some never will. I'm just happy I've figured out how to stop hurting my car even if I end up a little further from the curb and it takes a lot more effort on my part."
Well if there's a truck behind me than I'm thankful for this feature. My old car was a 2007 wrx wagon so even just having Bluetooth is an improvement. The model Y doesn't have auto dimming mirrors either but I imagine it's high enough where it doesn't matter.
Doesn't ship to me :( will try keep an eye out for similar products though. Thank you!
About three minutes and fifty seconds in
"HVAC is literally just another acronym for AC... so you’re already doing that one

But there’s no obligation to say ICE/EV, it’s just that once you have an EV you start to look for a fast way to refer to them because you’ll be comparing them

Right now you just have a “car” because you’ve only experienced one type of propulsion, you have little reason to refer to EV and ICE because you aren’t comparing the two

You’ll find that the first time you say ICE and EV is about 24 hours after you get your EV: when you come on here to say “I’ve only owned an EV for a day, but I’ll never go back to ICE”"
You don’t have to change your lingo. I just call ‘em “normal cars” and still say “AC.” I know many other people with Teslas [in person] and none of them speak that way; I think it’s mainly redditors
"It's always been called HVAC. ""ICE"" is new"
I can’t parallel park either 😂
"Hmm yeah, great point! I guess the good thing is that we can easily get a quick boost forwards outside of the range of the truck's solar flare xD"
Tree fiddy? Go away Loch Ness Monstah!
Haven't heard truer words than this for awhile
It was a joke. You’re welcome
"Right, right. HVAC and ICE have been around for a long time. But most people don’t usually use the terms much outside of the Tesla reddit community"
"HVAC is a general term, not necessarily used in car lingo."
Of course. I meant using the term referring to cars
Is that a silver model 3?
Very nice picture. Good job.
I like how the number plate goes „EV“
Looks like a commercial !
I love the tail-lights on the model 3. Does anyone know if they’ll use similar ones on the model S? I feel like the model S ones seem dated in comparison
"I modified this version to make it 30% true black.

How can there be midnight sun in the arctic in early March? Something funny here.
Looks white to me. Maybe the lighting and the filter make it look like it’s silver?
"All electric cars have E* number plates in Norway. It started with EL, then moved on to EK when they ran out. We were lucky enough that it became EV right before the Model 3 was delivered, so most Model 3s here have number plates starting in EV."
This wasn’t shot in March!
Who said it was shot yesterday 😂
loool my first thought was that this pic came from the scent wedge collection
Just wait... It only gets better with time. When you get a major update that improves the entire experience. The car just keeps getting better! Nice color choice btw!
Amazing photo! That belongs in r/teslaporn
fantastic shot!
Interested to be on the Tesla Tales podcast? Would love to hear about it.
Beautiful shot!
What’s your finance rate?
Beautiful car. Beautiful picture.
Great car!  Beautiful picture!
Looking at leasing one and even put down the $100 reservation fee but considering canceling because of the current emergency.
Awesome shot!
"Thanks! White on white, love the combo."
"It is a beautiful photo, but why smudge out the plate like that? Like who’s gonna look you up and how and why?"
i got the same white on white / couldnt be happier.  enjoy your new toy.
Yeah I agree with you.  Every time someone posts a license plate they get scolded though.
Somehow I feel like people will get offended if we start saying teamwhite.
"True, I just never could understand why."

"Tesla Model 3 Performance Black:

You missed the windshield!
Looks very very awesome!  Love that the matte is coming from a clear bra. So when you take it off you still have a perfect black underneath.  If I had performance I’d do the same but 5k on a sr+ doesn’t make sense to me.  I painted my calipers Porsche hybrid green to simulate being cool like you :)

Any issues with sensors or cameras?
Calipers are stock?
how much did that all cost you? and location?
I'm debating a slight tint on the windshield in the future but I decided against it for now because I'm afraid it will be  too dark at night.
"I'm glad to hear you liked the look. My only regret is not doing it sooner. It was a little bit much to spend but it makes me happy every time I see her, so it feels worth it to me!"
"It cost roughly $1000. Turnaround was 3 days, 1 day to disassemble, clean and send out to powder coater, 1 day to powder coat and dry, 1 day to remount, balance and setup TPMS. Other shops may be cheaper and faster but I had it done as a package with the tint. Overall really happy with the results, I think the stock rims look even better in this color."
"Xpel stealth wrap install with headlight/taillight smoke included $5000

Carbon Fiber Mirror Caps from RPM Tesla - $139

Carbon Fiber Turn Signal Caps from RPM Tesla - $59"
"They advised me at the shop the mirrors were very hard to wrap and prone to peeling and recommended these caps instead. The matte carbon fiber mirror caps match the carbon fiber spoiler on the performance and looks great, gives some minimal contrast to an otherwise all black look.

The turn signals are one of the hardest parts to wrap with vinyl for the chrome delete so I bought caps for those as well and it really helps tie in the look.

The caps fit great, very high quality, all pure carbon fiber. I'm really happy with the complete look."
Would’ve gone with Black Betty.
I thought about naming her The Dark Knight but I settled on Bagheera instead.
When I get her clean again I will try to get one done. I'm happy to hear you like the look!
Here's a quick couple walk around pics on an overcast day. https://imgur.com/a/Gf6lPtN
The shop quoted $300 for tail light and headlight smoke but threw it in as a package with the Xpel stealth wrap.
"Ooh, it would be so quiet too."
"Thank you, I'm glad you like it!

Xpel stealth wrap install with headlight/taillight smoke included $5000

Powder coating wheels $1000

Xpel prime XR plus $700 including sunroof and single piece rear (excluding windshield)

Nikola Pro chrome delete kit $150 (on sale now 140 on amazon)

Carbon Fiber Mirror Caps from RPM Tesla - $139

Carbon Fiber Turn Signal Caps from RPM Tesla - $59

Interior also has dash and center console matrix black wrap to complete the look."
Great minds think alike... glad you like the look!
None that I noticed. They actually did not wrap the sensors to prevent any issues. You can barely notice it on the front parking sensors in the pictures posted.
Yes those are the stock performance calipers.

"son, i was just kidding... the car looks fantastic!"
"Thanks, good to know when I finally get round to it, although I will be getting a white car, so not sure if I will leave the mirrors white, same black as de-chrome, or carbon to match spoiler."
Another reason why I picked this is because the song mentions Tesla
Very nice!
Did you notice any cell phone signal degradation with the carbon fiber mirror caps? The cell antennas are in the side mirrors . Been wondering about this for a while!
Has been working well for me! I was worried about this too but no problems to report so far.
"Ok I have to ask, 

What rim is that? You look like a non-performance from the brake caliper color. 

And second question, who's head is hanging on your mirror."
"Wow you found a spot with no homeless, trash, scooters. I'm impressed.  Harrison is usually busy."
"These are the 19” sport wheels plasti dipped anthracite gray (I have since taken off the dip and powder coated them glossy turbine gray).

That is Elon’s head! Look up “Elon’s musk”"
"Lol I was just going to comment, did you get the next pick of someone busting the window out and breaking in"
I’ve been interested in doing the same. How much did you pay to get them done and got pics of the glossy gray?
"Unfortunately, so true"
"Tax deduction. I'm an entrepreneur, so I'm always looking for creative ways to get deductions. 

In US Tax Law, any vehicle over 6,000 pounds gross weight can be fully expensed in the first year of purchasing. Most SUVs would never qualify, however because the Tesla battery is 2,000 pounds it barely is over the weight limit to be fully deducted.

I put $30k cash down and finance $50k over 5 years, but was able to claim the entire $80k deduction this year as a business expense. 

Now obviously you need to be making a good amount of money to need that kind of a deduction, but that's an entire different thread."
"Husband is an entrepreneur, we are car collectors, I wanted another mommy car lol
He used to own a Model S a few years ago and we liked it so I decided to get an X for me"
"For starters, being rich helps."
"I did the same thing. Model X was purely a tax decision from a financial standpoint. Love the tech, it’s a dream car."
"Is this just the previous year models? Looks like the 2020 is around 5,500 pounds."
"If you can give any details, How does that work?"
https://finance.zacks.com/6000pound-vehicle-tax-deduction-3484.html
"Oops! Sorry to make you google for me.

Interesting read! good to know about the driving time having to be >50% for business use too."
Jealous! Blue and gray seem to be what people are getting first. Hoping on my white one to arrive soon.
Nice!
any chance you're parking that at a local Fred Meyer so people can get a peek at it?
This is the color I'd get as a second Tesla next to my red steal model 3... Except I wouldn't pay for a P any more. Dual motor is where it's at.
Awesome! I’m excited to sea Ys around Seattle (and mine soon too). :)
Love it. The blue looks great!
I don't mind seeing all these blue as this will be my color.
Thank you!!!
Nice!
"I'm in Bellevue and waiting for my regular AWD MSM. Hopefully I see yours around, I'm dying to see one in person!"
Should be getting a black performance anyway 👋 from Redmond
"I’ve been stalking the videos of people sharing their delivered Ys and I’m still dying to know 2 dumb little things For some reason:
1) is there a cargo shelf/cover behind the 2nd seats to hide your stuff?
2) I’m assuming the middle seat on back has an inset that flips down with arm rest/cup holders yeah?"
I'll give ya fifty bucks for it.
First ride in the car and the kids discovered Fart mode. Hysterics ensued. (The 6 year old’s favourite feature!)
"i’d love to know exactly which P Zero’s are wrapped around those uberturbines. Are they indeed the summer version? we know the sizes but if you have more info, i’d really appreciate it! pcnt and elctrc i believe but it’s hard to narrow down on Pirellis site"
"yes, thank you, that’s size and load rating. i’ve confirmed that it’s also a new EV offering, a run flat with some puncture protection and a summer compound that shouldn’t be used below 45 degrees. anyone else chime in if you find something more. i live in the mountains and won’t be able to get this car home, much less drive it for a while as we’re all snow and ice for now. maybe i’ll be the first to tell us which custom wheels will fit.."
"The wheels look obnoxiously large, they will negatively effect comfort and handling. Also the tires will fail more often and be more expensive to replace. I'd have to get 17s or 18s for mine, otherwise i'm very excited for what seems like a stellar vehicle."

"1. No cargo cover. I never used the one from my other cars - it just sits in the garage. 
2. Yes."
"How does the MY drive?  How is cornering and road noise?  Is it similar to M3 in the way it drives?   I have a performance grey MY on order, hopefully will be in Seattle soon."
Does 275/35 R21 103W mean anything to you?
Handling will be more stuff and better with thinner tires.
"While I agree about the performance/cost, I think they look so good. Does Tesla offer a tire package?  If so, I’d had the extra cost to my monthly payment for that."
"Seems great to me. Pretty firm ride, but I like that. Never driven or ridden in a 3 so can’t compare. Does feel kind of heavy but I guess the 3 would also with all the batteries."
"More stuff? The only thing better about it is steering response. The unsprung weight disadvantage will guarantee it handles worse in every other situation. I'll give up a little steering response for higher corner speed, more comfort, less flat tires and yes, IMO better looks."
"Thx, I have a leased MX now that I have to return in early May (I've had it three years).  I've driven the M3 and I like the way it drives more than my MX (the M3 is lighter, more agile), so hoping the MY is similar to M3.  We'll see, enjoy your new Tesla!"
I get mine tomorrow. Can't wait.  Congrats!
"🔥 I’m waiting for the exact same one!They said in 3-5 days, got vin assigned. What was the contactless process like? My advisor said I was the first one he worked with that was part of a new contactless deliver at home process so he didn’t know much"
Wow this is the first white performance I’ve seen. It’s sexy af
"Looks amazing! If you have time could you post more pics, would be really appreciated as I haven’t seen the white in performance upgrade yet :)."
“Welcome home y family! Welcome home.”
[deleted]
Congrats!
"Those wheels look so much better than the Model 3 Aero Covers.

I'm hoping the pandemic doesn't delay the [Orbital Covers](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rimetrix/orbital-1/description)."
"Got mine yesterday, same configuration.  Man it's slick looking with the black wheels and chrome delete"
Thanks for the pic. This is the first white exterior performance pic I've seen and it looks really good. This is my config and first time I'm seeing it. Getting excited.
"Excited for you, it's awesome"
I picked up at Charlotte location.  My time got moved up when I called to ask about a 14-50 NEMA adapter.  Might be worth a call as they seem to be trying to rush with all the shut down uncertainties
I picked up today as well.  I go over the contactless part of my interaction in this thread: /r/TeslaLounge/comments/fouvn7/took_delivery_of_model_y_lr_awd_today_this_car_is/
When did you put your order in? Curious how long mine would come in if I put an order in now. I know I’m late in the game but wasn’t planning on needing a car already
I'll see what I can do if weather nice tommorow
"IKR, maybe all this Covid business will help accelerate the legislation a bit.."
Got mine and your right.  It is awesome😄
thanks will give it a try!
thanks!
Feb 10. I’m pretty sure location has something to do with it too. I’m in Cali
Feb 10. I’m pretty sure location has something to do with it too. I’m in Cali
"Oh yah I’m in Texas. That’s not too bad tho, I was expecting months"
"yea, I would imagine the wait not being long these days. Pretty sure lots of people cancelling/deferring orders"

I drove by as well! Saw two trucks being loaded with model Ys (mostly blue with the upgraded wheels)
"All the colors! And loaded up trucks! 

This is so exciting! 

Thanks for this!"
B E A Utiful! Soooo many blue ones!
"So exciting, if only there were some LR RWD's in there ;-)"
They all have the induction wheels.  Very interesting.  I don't see any performance ones but perhaps those have already been loaded and shipped.
"Doesnt really seem like hundreds, maybe a dozen or two"
"Not sure I see Hundreds here, most of the rows in the background are Model 3."
Did they move back to silver door handles?
Chrome handles? Or is that packaging?
It’s the handles I believe
No demand! That's why there are hundreds of TMY still at the factory. /s
"I know, right?  LR AWD, black on black, + FSD...with the 19""ers.  Hopefully we're in the next wave.  Stay strong, partner!"
"Appears the MSM model near the end of the video has the Uberturbine 21's.  Very difficult to tell whether any of the others are the same, but based on calipers you can make out most do appear to be LR with the Induction 20's."
"One, two, hundreds!"
There was many rows in the back of model y and semi’s being  filled
Probably white protective tape on some of them.
"Second this question. Most seem to have black but some have chrome, and some have both???"
"Just a heads up, the hatch doesn’t stop if its opening underneath a garage door so be very careful. Just got my first scratch from the garage door. I’m assuming there’s a height setting somewhere to have it stop....idk"
I’m in Atl too. Ordered same color and wheels with white interior. I hope I get a delivery date.
"Yo if your interested the guy from stealth hitches might want to check out your car for manufacturing their hew hitch for the Y. FYI I can probably give him your email or something if you want, if not no worries!"
The front door's color and alignment appears off in comparison to the rear door.  Hopefully it's just the lighting....I have a white one coming and getting concerned about some of the build quality issues I'm hearing about.
Congrats from a Tesla fan in Powder Springs
What are these 14-50 adapters everyone is talking about and why do we need one if we've ordered a Tesla?
"Congrats! Did you get FSD also?

Mine is exactly the same vehicle except with white interior. With COVID-19...it might be at least summer before next deliveries start."
Is there a Tesla T on the wheel center caps? It’s hard to tell from any of the photos I’ve seen
The white looks so good with the chrome delete and rims. Much better than the white model 3 IMO.
Looks amazing. Sorry to hear about the trunk scratch.
Question for you. How is the foot-well space up front? Is there a hump like there is for the model 3?
"WOW, what a beauty! This photo makes me want to change my reservation from black to white and upgrade the wheels"
"Pull the hatch down to the height you want it set to and then hold the open/close button until you hear a beep , then it will stay at that height"
Thanks for this!  got mine today and remembered your comment before opening it accidentally.
"Just the lighting, I haven’t noticed anything yet about the build quality."
"You're stuck home charging with a 120V plug if you don't get one of these adapters. You'll need to have a NEMA 14-50 (240V 50 Amp) outlet installed to use this adapter.

You'll about 30 miles per hr of charging using a 14-50 plug compared to like 6 miles per hr with a regular outlet plug.

Tesla doesn't provide this plug and they sell out quickly."
"For what its worth, we just use the regular provided charging plug that plugs into a normal 120v outlet, as out garage has a very tiny circuit breaker and can’t take 120v 50A. It’s been fine as overnight you charge at least 60-70miles over 10 hours, so the car is full every morning anyways. We have 2 model 3s and we have had no issues"
"Nah I’m gonna hold off on dropping another 7k until this pandemic is over. It’s worth it for sure, if you like the ride of the model 3 but wanna sit higher this is the ticket. Back seats seem incredibly roomy, way more than the 3. Also the storage is pretty awesome."
"Yes, yes there is. Picture coming"
Awesome thank you!
"What if you're at a location that has a low ceiling and it's a one-time thing, do you just hold it to stop it from opening completely? Won't that damage the motors/springs?"
"So I already have a 240 V juice box station at home that I was planning to use with the J1772 adapter. The mobile charger that comes with the car is for level 1 charging in an emergency, but it can also charge at 240 V if you get an adapter?"
"This is rubbish imo. It's like buying a phone without a proper charging cable. 

My 3 came with the NEMA 14-50 adapter. It's bit ridiculous a $50k vehicle comes without right charging cable. Having just a 120V charging cable is stupid."
"That’s my logic as well. Most people do not commute 70 miles a day, so you are always “full”."
So no FSD? Interesting.
"Yeah that J adapter goes into the car charging port right? The nema 14-50 adapter is interchangeable with the charging cable on the other end to plug into the wall outlet.

https://shop.tesla.com/product/gen-2-nema-adapters"
"i also have a 14-50 Nema outlet with a Juicebox pro 40 EVSE. i got the adapter just in case i'm away from home, and find a 14-50 outlet, (common at RV sites). my current EV has the J1772 port that allows direct connection to the EVSE. I plan on using the included J adapter provided by Tesla at home, and keep the Tesla cable in the car"
"Many people don't have a garage with a 14-50 option. In that case, having the plug is just a waste."
100% agree.
the included Tesla cable can be plugged into both 120V and 240V outlets. using the 14-50 adapter allows you to get 32 amps from the 240V outlet without buying any EVSE
"Exactly. Honestly 6 miles per hour is actually ok for most people on a daily commute. That’s 48 miles overnight, even more when you consider you are home more than 8 hours."
"The question is does Model Y come with the NEMA 14-50 adapter to plug into 240V? Like the 3.

Or do you have to buy it separately"
no

The sidewalls on those tires give me anxiety.
How does it compare to a Model 3 (if you have experience with one)? Does it feel a lot roomier inside? Do you feel like you're sitting up higher?
"Sadly, I think I'm going to have to wait on mine until the market recovers some."
This is fantastic. Gives me a much better sense of proportion and feel. Thanks for posting
God damnit I'm going to have to switch back to getting blue
It is BEAUTIFUL!!! I honestly didn't think the blue looked that good with Teslas until Model Y
Does the build quality seem to have improved from when the model 3 launched? Panel gaps seem to be much better. Im impressed.
Is there going to be a cargo cover? Or will I need to get a blanket to cover up my shit?
"Awesome, thanks for posting! Does it have a tow hitch?"
production model?
"They already got the floors dirty. Haha

I’m going to have to keep a handy-vac in the Y when mine gets delivered. ;)   /s"
does that look like a drain in the frunk (pic 22)?
Is that a stock chrome delete kit? 😍
Something about tesla feels so sterile. I can't wait for other people to get theirs so I can see what they look like after it's been lived in.
Jealous!
"I only see 24 pictures. Where are the other 999,976?"
"Keep going back and forth between the 19"" and 20"". Should I be happy with the 19""?"
"Really don't want to come negative, but whether its a matter of liquidity or fear, or something else, if a market downturn like we've just seen (and will probably continue to see something more)...if that's not baked into your predictable personal finances, maybe a $60K new vehicle shouldn't be in the cards.  Hope this doesn't come off judgmental, and IMO as many people who can and want can hopefully get into a Y (and EVs in general!). Certainly for most folks can be a big choice to finance or lay out that much cash, regardless of the inevitable ebb and flow of the economy/stock market/etc.  I guess if the choice is either buy stock or buy the car, and not both, maybe that makes the choice clear.  Good luck, either way, hope it works out."
This market drop has me wondering if I should put the money in the stock market vs my model y.
Why ?
That blue looks sick
No way to really know that until more people get their hands on them. I did see a photo where it looks like the chrome delete was forgotten since it’s stock now.
There’s storage bins under the floor in the trunk space.
The Y has satin black trim on all versions.
Yeah it’s stock now (on the Y)
Hah sorry. I exaggerated.
"Certainly your decision to make, but 19"" = 45 series, 20"" = 40, 21"" = 35.  

45 will survive potholes the best...will probably give more choices for tires, as well as cheaper pricing.  Additionally the tires we believe are going to come on them are continental contiprocontact all seasons versus a new and unknown Goodyear ""asymetrical 5"" tire which is rated m+s but looks like it would suck for any sort of winter use.

Personally, I'm opting for the 19"" to save 2 grand which will go nicely towards a better looking set of 19"" wheels (Konig Ampliforms maybe) and possibly some sportier tires....that wheel/tire package ought to be around the same price as the 20"" wheel package."
Y?
Get back in that car
Thank you!
Are you going for the performance?
"No, in that's case I'd probably take the free upgrade and then sell the wheels and tires and go down to 19s.  But that's just what I would do.  I like a square setup for rotations and need more sidewall given the Midwest roads."
WOO HOO!!! Post photos!!! Congrats!
"13th? :O   
Have fun!"
Please more detail.
Pics and measurements please. Cheers!
"Seriously? Glorious. I am in the Seattle-Renton-Bellevue area, Congrats! Waiting for my email. Trying to take delivery before I do the responsible thing and delay the order because of the recession."
Livestream this or ban!
Is it Friday yet?
Jealous and happy for you!! Hopefully I get my LR AWD in 2020.
"That’s great to hear! I’m in the Seattle area as well and will be picking up from the Renton location. How long ago did you get your final contract and vin assigned? I’ve had everything done, including financing since last week but haven’t heard anything since."
"I live in Bay Area and couldn't select to pick up at the location, only delivery to my house."
Congrats! Can you post videos???
"Congrats, are you taking loan? If you are fine, could you give the APR you got and which bank?"
"Can you give us your build info? I live in Newcastle (just North of Renton) and I'd heard that cars might be shipped out by geographic area, but I don't have an email yet. I ordered an AWD with out FSD or upgraded wheels in January.

&#x200B;

\*\*edit saw your build below. Congrats, and enjoy it!"
Congrats!  Can you pls make a video from the side showing the trunk opening. I’d like to get an idea of the clearance if a tow hook bike rack or something else was attached.
"Congratulations, i have my pre order in for the cybertruck but i am more than excited to see people get their model Y's. Please give your opinions about the ground clearance. I return to the united state next year and if cybertruck is still looking like a 2022-23 delivery date i may switch the the Y if it has enough ground clearance for large amounts of snow."
I have an order in but looking to probably cancel as job is in jeopardy now with current events.
"Did you get it yet?!?! How do the two buttons in the back trunk area work for the rear seats? Are those 60/40 folding? What are the measurements of all the storage compartments in the rear and the frunk?


Congrats dude!!"
Gonna have to ban this guy for not steaming this or being a liar
Lots and lots of photos!!!! Congrats
"Blue/black, AWD, FSD, performance w/performance upgrade."
Please pull the tow rating out of the Model Y manual!
I'm 5'9 on a good day.
heyy loan rates are lower yay
A couple of days ago.
I got a loan through Everence CU at 1.99%.
"Blue/black, AWD, FSD, performance w/performance upgrade"
How much clearance would you consider enough?
:-(
"Yes, I got it! Will check out those buttons when I get home."
They've pushed my pickup time to 5pm. Hopefully it'll be ready by then else will get pushed til tomorrow.
Is this a joke?! :-D  It's not even Noon Pacific Time (time zone for Seattle-Renton) yet!
Still no link to the owners manual showing up on the site.
That is what I told my wife! Then she reminded me I am in sales. I compromised by removing FSD. Haha.
"Thanks, that’s reassuring and gives me hope that I’ll get mine by next week or so."
Thanks
probably around 8ish
we want pics asap!
I don't think there is any deliveries before Friday. So it probably unlocks then.
"right on, slap on the FSD in a couple of months, everybody dance"
Is it 7K to add-on after delivery? Or does it increase?
Correct me if wrong Reddit but I think it's the same
"Took delivery today. It was a unique experience.

They dropped the car off while I was on a walk with my wife and emailed me a link to active the car. Once I confirmed the delivery, I was able to connect with the app and unlock it. The keys and contract were in the frunk and all I had to do was sign a few places and drop the envelope off at a FedEx drop off."
Best looking combination. I love it.
I'm waiting on the same configuration from the looks of it. How many miles did it have after dropping it off?
"Damn. I’ve been arguing with my family that I’ll be getting a 3 and not a Y, but you guys are making it hard for me!!!"
How is the acceleration of the AWD and the ride on the induction wheels?
Nice. Tesla contacted me right as this mini apocalypse started. I asked them to hold until June. Will have to live vicariously through your pics for a while. Hopefully only a short while...
"Dang, I've never really been a fan of white on cars, especially Teslas, but that looks SHARP with the factory chrome delete & induction rims!!"
"OP, just FYI, you have 7 days or 100miles to find any defects or noises or what not. Like pain issues or body alignment issues, and then you have to make service center own up to it and include it in their bill of sales. I didn't do that for my rear bumper paint defect and they completely denying me of any repair there. I learn to live with it now. I don't stare at my car all day, and the garage is dim so I can't tell during this shelter in place"
What a beaut
"Looks great

Any pics from directly behind it?"
What's with the OJ glove on the ground?
Looks great op. Waiting on same config. Congrats!
FSD?
great seeing the pearl white Y out and about. hopefully our LR RWD will be made this year
"Next to that large van, it looks completely like a Model 3. If you hadn't said it was a Model Y, I would have guessed it was a Model 3 with fancy wheels and a chrome delete."
What color are the rear tail light blinkers?  Red or Amber?
Love it! Mind if I share the photos on instagram? My account is siliconvalleyteslas
Np. I posted a few weeks ago. Hope you’re enjoying it!
Where are you located?
At what point do you formally accept the car ... after confirming the email link ? Or after they receive the fedex docs ? Just curious if there is anything like you inspect and confirm
This is pretty cool actually. Hopefully no major defects
"Got mine yesterday (Saturday) too (performance with 19""), in Bay Area, but I was home and signed all paperwork at the time.
Was driven from Fremont over the San Mateo bridge and arrived with 44 miles on the clock."
It had about 40 miles. I think they drove it from the Burlingame distribution center.
"I think it’s pretty amazing, especially for its size."
Thanks for the advice! I need to do a thorough inspection
Unfortunately the sun was setting and I was in a hurry to take some photos before then. I will probably take some more today.
It doesn’t fit
It’s actually tricky to spot the difference. Really they’re just a little bit bigger and from the back
Don't mind at all! Thanks for asking
San Francisco
"I think it’s once you sign the contract and they receive it. You have to send it back within 24 hours or risk having the car taken back.

I suppose you could inspect and if you find an issue you could reach out to them before signing?"
Everything seemed to be in order. I also saw a few people on here get their delivery postponed because it didn’t pass inspection right before it was supposed to be delivered.
44 miles is 70.81 km
Enjoy the car!
Thanks for the information !

"I'm much happier with my blue preorder now that I've seen a couple in real light and not just marketing renders.

Plus, THANK YOU FOR GETTING RID OF THE CHROME"
Dat factory tint.
I keep changing my order over and over again. I can’t decide between white or black and now I’m thinking about blue. I know I want white seats but I’m not sure if white seats will look right with blue. The pressure is killing me
100% agree.
"
I prefer the chrome.  I wish the Y had it. [The chrome really makes the blue pop.](https://www.techguide.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Model3Drive14.jpeg). The blue Y looks too dark to me. I wish it had silver wheels too, like the 3.

Chrome delete on the Y looks good on the [red with black wheels.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0173/8204/7844/articles/ModelY_1400x.jpg?v=1583639151). Chrome delete [also looks good on the white Y.](https://www.xautoworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Model-Y-Chinese-Performance-Wheels.jpg)"
Wish they did front windows as well
Blue w white seats will look amazing. I currently have a black car and I swore I would never buy another cause it is so hard to keep clean and shows scratches. Ordered white on white for my  model Y. For what all that's worth.
I could be wrong but I don't think the manufacturer can legally do that
"Just a heads up: while black and white look amazing, both colors are the shittiest to keep clean. I know. I own a black and a white car. White is no better. If you want an easy to keep clean my buy a grey one :)"
"You're right...it's illegal in some states to have tint on the front windows.  eg: NH, NJ...and then others where you cannot go below 70%."
"Yeah, between my partner and I we have a white and black car. I've found the white to be easier, for us at least. We don't have snow here. Mostly pollen and dust (New Orleans). For what that's worth. I do like the dark gray and always figured that's my next car color, but every grey tesla that I've seen looks really crappy if its even slightly dirty for some reason. It's weird, no other cars seem that way. Hoping the pearl white will look classy. Eh. Thx for the input though, yes."
"I find white to be way better than black, not quite as easy as grey though (that's totally the easiest). I would pick white over any dark colour too in terms of maintenance."
Can we PLEASE see those wheels. Only seeing Unberturbines
How was touchless delivery? They’ve rescheduled mine twice!
"For touchless delivery, how does one point out defects and prove that it was not self-inflicted post delivery?"
What color are the rear tail light blinkers?  Red or Amber?
Pics of wheels and especially weight of wheels+tires please!
More photos of the side profile with wheels please. 🤗Agonizing over Induction or Uberturbine but the 21”’s are growing on me.
Following to see those wheels.
I just posted another pic.
It was super smooth. No issues at all just that my car was smelling more of Clorox than the factory new car smell - honestly Clorox smell made me feel better.
Well that’s a bummer for sure! I took a quick video of internal and external looks.
Amber
Where do I find the weight? I looked through my Tesla account but nowhere did I see tech specs.
Just posted
"Yes, I opted for the standard 19"" wheels and have been debating about upgrading ever since. The sample picture Tesla puts on their webpage when ordering changes the middle of the wheel, but not the size of the actual wheel from 19"" to 20"" so we have no idea what the gaps look like."
Just posted!
Bruh... those other pics tho.
Do you live in EU?  The US MY has red after checking a couple
With a scale. 😁
Just posted!
Nope not in EU!
"Bahaha - send me yours, will weigh!"
"I didn’t get the performance, but did get the MSM and 20” turbines! So stoked!"
That spoiler is a bit extreme.
"Ready for delivery .... so the customer gets to drive it off the truck.  That would be awesome. In the excitement of the moment, I hope the customer doesn't accidentally shift to reverse."
She's a beaut Clark!
Very nice.
What’s with the chrome?
Lol it's not chrome. It's white protective tape.
"I swear to God, that comment pops up in every single fucking thread. It's like a meme at this point."
Specs? Love the white!
"Congrats, Live in NYC so don't expect a delivery date anytime soon.  But really happy to see someone post pics of a white Model Y with the specs I ordered.  Seen a few blue's and MSM which looks good.  Considered changing color but now seeing White, I may stick with it.

If possible, can you send a maybe a picture of the side and back?  Thx"
"Thank you! I never had a white car before so I’m still dubious about it being the color that looks cleanest for the longest time. 


Dual Motor

Pearl White Paint

20’’ Induction Wheels

All Black Premium Interior

Autopilot

Full Self-Driving Capability"
"My Model 3 is white and I feel like it always looks clean. Much easier to keep clean than black for sure. FWIW, I use a drive through car wash that uses drum chamois and my car still looks new."
"Not sure what drum chamois are, but I would never use a drive through car wash for a car I care about. You get all of the shit from other cars on your vehicle, and they can wreak Havoc of a cars paint job."
Ok
Those are USB-C outlets in the rear!
"Observations about rear seats:
We can see the internals of the rear seat backrests ... like whatever is supposed to cover the back of them is missing.  (Not unusual to have a few parts shortages during initial ramp up of mass production.)
Also, the left rear shoulder belt is apparently free to move between the backrest and the left rear trim panel.  This suggests that the backrest does not anchor to the side, rather only to the bottom (like front seats).  And this suggests that maybe the rear seats could slide fore and aft (like front seats).  And this would affect rear seat leg room."
I found this on Twitter this morning. Looks like some saw a Model Y in the wild and started snapping away. The person who uploaded them just uploaded the pictures with no story or context. Pretty cool.
No ISOFIX in the middle seat. Good to know.
"Back seats look a little cramped, I thought two children’s car seats would have plenty of room, but it may be a little tighter judging by these pictures. Cool to see though. Thanks for sharing."
"It is a Model 3 interior with little more head room and slightly bigger and more accessible trunk. Not a game changer unfortunately. Yes, maybe worth upgrading but not a “next level” thing. They probably wanted to keep it compatible/interchangeable parts with Model 3 as much as possible and fill gap between Model 3 and Model X. Basically saying want a bigger SUV - buy Model X. Those are expensive as hell and I’m personally not crazy about fancy rear doors."
Damn I thought I was the first to notice it! :D
"Welp, guess I'm gonna have to buy a bunch of USB C to Micro B cables / adapters for the friends and family :/"
The front passenger seat looks to be all the way or almost all the way back.  So it might look tighter then it actually is.     People easily get two car seats in the 3 so it should be no problem with the Y.
I’m guessing here but it looks like the front seats are all the way back. The place the passenger belt attaches to the body of the car looks forward of the passenger seat.
I’m feeling the same way. Looks a little cramped. I suppose they had to take space from somewhere to make space somehow for the large cargo space or third row seats. I am not sure how I feel about this.
"A lot of people are trying to be insulting by saying this is basically a hatchback Model 3. But that’s literally what I have been wanting from Tesla. I never pulled the trigger on the 3 because I need a hatchback for my all my stuff and for my dog. This isn’t revolutionary but that’s what sold me. They have been rolling out the 3s for awhile and have got it down pretty well, and worked out the kinks which makes me feel pretty good about jumping on the Y early on."
Revolutionary compared to the 2005 Honda CR-V I’m upgrading from! That thing still has a cassette player!
I was just informed that iPhones that aren’t the 11 pro will require adapters. My husband swears the USB C is far superior and that having them instead of USB A shows Tesla is thinking about future technology. So I guess this is a good thing? So that made me feel a little better about having to buy adaptors I guess. 😅
Good catch.
Looking again it seems like the passenger seat is much further back than the drives’s side seat.
"maybe its the perspective, but to me the cargo area looks really small in the other photo they showed."
"With a more upright seating posture, legroom is likely more generous than the M3 because your knees won't be in your chest."
I wasn’t trying to insult you or your dog. Peace and love...
"I ordered one for my fiancee, she drives the exact same car! It's a trooper, but needless to say she's very excited about the y"
You can buy USB-C-to-lightning cables on Amazon. Works with any iPhone with a lightning connector. I use them all the time on my 6s+.
"I get that. Ultimately its just a matter of time till all phones switch to USB C. Almost everyone I know (including me, though that'll change this summer) is still using a phone with a micro USB though."
I know! I didn’t think you were. Lol. I meant other people were trying to be insulting. Not you. I was agreeing with your point. It’s all good.
You da real MVP
"Many of us on Facebook groups, Tesla Model Y, Tesla Model Y Enthusiasts, Tesla Model Y Owners Club who ordered black got this call this morning. 

My post from this morning at 10:30am:


I just got a call from Tesla this morning to take delivery as long as I changed my configuration. My configuration is a Solid Black Model Y Performance Black Interior no FSD with the Performance Upgrade. I put in my order in the beginning of January 2020. I live 15 minutes away from the Tesla Fremont factory. (I'm calling these all out as they may be a factor in them calling me now)

He said they have white, blue, red and grey all available for delivery. I thanked him for calling me and offering it to me but I declined the offer. I want my configuration. 

I asked how long until they start production on the solid black color. He said it could possibly start in April or May but that's not official. I told him I don't mind waiting given what's going on with COVID-19 all around the world.  

To anyone who has selected solid black as your outside paint choice, you won't be getting it for this month at the very least."
"My status has been sitting at ""we are preparing your contract"" for 2 weeks.  This is annoying.  I'd enjoy going on long social distancing drives right now."
[deleted]
"All my info is updated, could give them a check tomorrow - Red/Black/20’s/no FSD, just waiting for a call/text/email with the VIN... :("
"I’m in for a black/black LR AWD. I am biting at the bit to get mine, but I would wait a few months if needed to get my black one. So the wait for me continues."
"I was called today and told my Model Y is prepped and ready to be delivered to my house. My lease is up in July and I was not expecting to get it this soon. If we did not have the fear/uncertainty of COVID19 looming over us we probably would be accepting the car early, however, with so much uncertainty and the fact we don’t NEED the new car right now, it looks like I might be letting it go. Specs are grey exterior, black interior AWD w/ 20” rims, FSD. I believe the vin shows #000798. Really hate to let it go but I think it’s for the best. I just hope one will be available when the lease really is up on our current car. Any thoughts from you guys? Worth getting early or cut loose?"
Good stuff thanks.
"I received the same call a few days ago. They told me all I had to do was finish the trade in agreement and payment section and I could expect a VIN at the end of the following week. 

Ordered last month:
White / White Interior / Performance w/ upgrade / FSD"
"""Also he said that A LOT of people anticipated to get their car later in the year so they postponed their orders so there are tons of Y’s that were originally anticipated for others and they are in the process of reassigning VINs.""

No surprise there.  I expect a similar thing to happen with the Cybertruck.  It has hard to know where you will be in 2-3 years."
It makes me curious how many pre orders they had considering tons of people on here ordered last month and getting delivery dates and others ordered on launch day and nothing
Did they give you any idea if they were making the LR AWD with white interior yet?! Hoping to be in the batch they make before the plant shuts down on Monday! I already have all the steps completed in my account.  Ow just playing the waiting game.
"Off topic:
1. Which states get 1 or 2 years of free super charging?
2. Does Model Y get any free supercharging?
3. Will they charge for the other colors or it's a free upgrade?"
"Interesting, the rep who I talked to said the black were already going into production, and it would be a month or less. But who knows, it might just be his best guess rather than actual factual information."
I read your comment and thought you were someone I know then looked at your name... spooky
I’m with you.   Been like that since 1 March.  Hope you get something soon!
"What color/trim are you? I’m red LR 4WD same story.
I suspect red color is an issue"
"Same, rep said contract won't be written til they get a VIN. Exact text verbiage ""Your documentation will begin being drafted once we have a VIN assised to your order.""


Prob not anytime soon with the Covid shut downs going on."
Yes.
People are scared of red because cops will chase them all day long. Probably both black and red color is of less demand. “Drafting contract” status for my red since forever.
Same here! MSM/Black/no FSD.
"I think postponing it is the right thing to do. In July, there will most likely still be cars from all the orders that were cancelled due to the COVID19 mess."
I dunno your financial situation but you can always sell your lease then accept delivery on your car. You may incur a loss to pay the difference of your pay off on your lease and the sale price but you aren't contractually obligated to keep the lease till July. Just make sure you sell it to a 3rd party or try CarMax or place like that.
Nothing on white interior! I should’ve asked totally slipped my mind!
"No free supercharging unless you use a referral code, and then get 1000 miles.  I’m assuming if you change color to one that is a cost premium, you have to pay for it.  Or get a refund if you downgrade."
"When did you talk to that rep? The move to shut down the Fremont plant by the 23rd occurred just yesterday. Things have been changing rather rapidly, so I wouldn't be surprised if they planned to finish up the month with some black Model Y's but then had to stop."
"But it's true, we know each other cause imsomeoneukno"
"""We are drafting up your contract...""

With what, a feather quill and ink well?  It's cool if you don't have my car ready yet, but at least don't leave me hanging for two weeks making me think you have some master calligrapher painstakingly obsessing over every stroke of every letter...

(this is sarcasm, and not intended to be taken literally)

&#x200B;

Because Data:  Blue / Performance + Upgrade / FSD / non-white interior"
"I ordered Red LR AWD no FSD Gemini wheels and got contacted yesterday that delivery team was ready to bring car. However, I already cancelled order because of everything. So, you can have my car!"
Gray
I had a VIN and MVPA posted to my account within the last 4 hours.  Someone in Las Vegas is still doling out paperwork.
Yeah the delivery center guy is probably tired of me already - just trying to get an idea on how the VIN process works. Someone mentioned he was told if you’ve updated all the paperwork and received a prep for delivery email you’re on track for delivery by EOM; hoping that’s true....
"As much as it hurts to do, I think you are right."
"Got it, Thank You."
"I tried to add a referral code to my order and I was told that there was no referral program for Model Y.

That clearly sounds incorrect since I have a referral code to give to other people on my account page...

Sounds like some people need to get their stories straight..."
Yesterday at around 11:30am. So possibly he didn't get the update just yet.
"Apparently I just needed to bitch on the Internet for the universe to sort itself out - got an MVPA posted to my account with a VIN, and just made the payment!"
"I don’t know what their production will be like these next few months, but I do think it’s likely that there are plenty of folks able to work from home on the Y waitlist, who won’t cancel.  I wouldn’t put it at 100% certain that a Y will be available in July when your lease is up."
I got the same story.
"Yeah, that's what seems to be happening across the board now. I think things are evolving there so rapidly it's been difficult for advisers to keep up.

In either case, I hope you get your Model Y soon! :-)"
Youuuuuuuu suck!  ;)
Interesting !! If this is true and deliveries are starting soon. I will place my order with exact same as OP
"Damn, congrats.  I'm sitting on a Model Y P, with white interior and FSD and waiting from 8/19.  You're the first I'm hearing about getting a Model Y shipped with White interior.  Are you following the google docs tracker and have your info out there?"
"Based from what I read, 1st to get are the ones who ordered Performance, then with Full Self Driving, hopefully next are the AWD with 20” white on white which is my config haha."
What state are you in? Congratulations!
When did you order?
Lucky!!
Oh well nothing too crazy ... got an update saying they have no idea about delivery timeline for my vehicle...will have better idea about logistics once March cars gets pushed out
"Still waiting for my delivery date on my YP, all I've gotten so far is them asking what days I don't want it delivered..."
Anyone with 7 seats getting deliveries yet?
My order is the exact same as OP. No email yet!
Thanks! Not really could you pls share the link ? Will add info
waiting since 3/15. grrr.
"I'm in the same boat, LR AWD with 20"" but no FSD. Send me an email damnit."
"CA, close to Fremont factory"
Initial RWD order on Dec17...modified few times to settle on this config on Jan28
I don't even think they're in production yet and honestly I'll be surprised if they make them.
Same order here. No email yet either.
Here you go!  [https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/teslike-model-y-survey-order-tracker-spreadsheet.145868/](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/teslike-model-y-survey-order-tracker-spreadsheet.145868/)
Nice i have the same setup with FSD
"I've had a 7-seater on order since 3 days after it was announced, so they are making them eventually."
Simply beautiful...
The soundtrack is a perfect choice.
s3xy af
Love the color. I’m waiting on my own red LR AWD.  The MY looks sooo much larger than the M3 in the side-by-side.  In a good way.
THICC
"Sweet! Enjoying virtually through you until mine arrives, same combo FSD."
That shade of red is bloody (ha) amazing.
I like how you just had to pull over to take a bit.
Nice location! I got married there. Pulgas Water Temple!
Is that the same shade of red used on the Model 3?  Recent photos make it seem a bit different
When was model 3 built and how is the interior noise between the two?
I miss imgur albums
I think the slope of the driveway is helping it look bigger too
I looked again and the Y is also closer to the camera.
Wow! That’s good to know! I just updated my order to the induction wheels to possibly get my Y sooner to try and take advantage of that!
What number did you call? They told us to email autofinance@tesla.com.
I called the same number my advisor called me from. The email should work as well though.
Yea mines drop to 2.95
Just emailed them and they responded back and adjusted my rate as well.  Thanks for the heads up.
Is that 2.59% for a 72 month as well?
I decided to go with 84 months at 3 and change.
"Curious did Tesla “Shotgun” your loan application to banks? If so, how many?, and did they hard inquiry again with the different rate?"
Still too high. Everence was doing 1.99% last week.
I was able to lock in 1.7% for 72 months
Where are you in the process? I’m in the insurance step and was told to wait for my VIN. Should I wait till I get it or should I just do it now?
Thanks for the tip - I got mine down to 2.64% for 72 months!
Thanks for the post! I was always curious as I saw the advertised rate at 2.99% on the Tesla website. Emailed autofinance and was told it would be another credit pull. Surprised I got 2.59% 72months from Chase. Previous was 3.5% Wells Fargo.
If anyone needs a referral I’ll message
Did you call or email?
Yes it is.
Didn’t even know that was an option!
"Only one inquiry and it was within the “shopping window” of the first inquiry, so I won’t get an additional ding for it."
"I called them too but the lady I talked to got a bit too extreme on the religious front, telling me I’d need to agree to some extensive religious view before becoming a member. To each their own but it was a bit much for me personally."
What lender did you get that with?
"I’m still waiting for my vin but have everything else submitted, including insurance."
Very happy to hear that this is working for most people!! 😃
Not with Tesla
"Gotcha, so they re-pulled for the lower interest rate. I think that’s a bit worth it."
Understood. I had to try and ignore that BS.
"Ok, I actually just got a call and text saying that I’m close, but still no VIN. So after we figure out some stuff on our end I’ll see about the lower interest rate."
With who? Any referral bonuses? E-mailed Tesla and the local credit union tonight.
"Yeah as far as I know, you have 30 days to shop where lenders pulling your credit for an auto loan doesn’t affect your score after the first."
"I would have forced myself to do the same but now that they’ve dropped it, it’s close enough :)"
Video is private
"This is why you shoot video horizontal, not vertical."
"Thanks! That’s so cool. That’s exactly my spec, so that’s fun to see. 👏🏼"
One side had chrome door handles and the other didn’t. The driver side had chrome the passenger side wasn’t.
"They did partial chrome delete or was there a wrap outside the door loop?
Because, the right of the car doesn't seem to have those chrome pieces near the door edges. The left of the car door parts got the chrome bits, not the edges though.

Edit: on watching it again, I believe there is a removable wrap on the driver side that was removed and revealed the chrome, the other side is still intact."
https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fc7ofl/model_ys_loaded_onto_a_semi_and_awaiting/fjaic2s?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
Been discussed several times - it's some sort of protective film or tape or whatever. It's likely that whatever it is came off on the non-chrome side.
There is a plastic film on several pieces.
thank you helpful stranger
Got it. Seemed strange.
Try backing it in. Fronting end is ineffective.
damnnn what did you do? Looks like the induction wheels are coated/powdered black?
Do a quick google search for local rim repair place. Usually you get get rims repaired for about $100 each. I’ve had it done on 2 of mine. Very quick and you cannot tell!
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Same thing happened to me with my model 3. I scratched the rims on day 1.
Ouch. How was the delivery experience
Shit. Sorry.
"Post some pics of your ride, pretty please.  I ordered white with the black 20s and haven’t seen many real life photos of that config."
"If it’s anything like the Model 3, say adios to all your rims now. These things are curb magnets. No clue why."
Yikes!
"Don't worry about this at all. They're strong and sturdy and ok to be scraped. 

It's a freaking car. A piece of machinery. Not worth worrying over it. 

That said, try to be careful always but it will happen. The Tesla design has the rim exposed more than other cars. I haven't seen this happen on my BMW nor Acura like this. For those the tires are actually bubbling outside the rim so the rims are inwards."
"Just drove into a curb while parking. It’s wider than the car I’m use to driving, so... Yeah I think the rims are coated. A buddy said the can fix it up pretty easy."
Thanks for the tip!
"Weird, but worked out okay. They dropped it off while I was away then I accept the delivery through the website and was able to unlock the car from the app. The keys and contract were in the frunk. Had to mail the contract back (Fedex envelope provided)"
Was bound to happen :)
Kk give me a few minutes!
[https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/fmuqlg/a\_few\_pics\_of\_my\_model\_y/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/fmuqlg/a_few_pics_of_my_model_y/)
Literally all my buddies who have Teslas said this! :0
"Sometimes that depends on the tire - about 15 years ago I had some Goodyear Eagle F1's that specifically had a lip of rubber reinforced with Kevlar that stuck out about 1/4 inch to protect the rim.  Don't know if those tires are still made though, or if they still have that feature.  I remember them being really good at carving corners on an '02 Subaru WRX though..."
"All new owners do this. Me, <1week with my Model 3. Used DIY paint. Sucked then, no biggy now."
"good to know, I’m good at getting curb rash as well. Can you post a pic of your Y. I noticed it’s white and it looks mighty nice just from staring at a scratched wheel"
"good to know, I’m good at getting curb rash as well. Can you post a pic of your Y. I noticed it’s white and it looks mighty nice just from staring at a scratched wheel"
Nice! True contactless delivery.  Wonder when I’ll get my delivery call.  Congrats on the new ride!
"Part of the reason I opted for Gemini. Of course, gotta keep some perspective. It’s just a wheel. :-)"
Yeah! It was seamless (except I didn’t know to look in the frunk for the keys) Hang in there!
Manage your expectations?
"Same configuration as you, and I’m confirmed for pickup tomorrow at noon!"
Terrific!  Great choice and glad you like your new Tesla!
Can’t wait for mine! Enjoy!
So jealous. Mine was supposed to be tomorrow but got delayed until Monday because the DMV is delayed processing my registration.
Is your new Tesla a Performance or a Performance with upgrade?  What color interior?  Congratulations!
How can a delivery be touchless if a human delivers the car to you?
yeah essentially just saying that nobody’s going to be there to walk me through anything that I’m on my own but if I have questions I have to call
https://i.imgur.com/M3Wmh6A.jpg
It's worth the wait.  Have fun!
performance with the performance upgrade.  Black interior. I picked it up today.  So much fun.  It's amazing how different it drives than me normal car
Your of course right but they do a lot to limit the amount of touching in fact I never got within 6 feet of any human when I picked it up but of course they had touch the car and the clipboard I had to sign
O yea although I couldn't do touchles because of trade in the guy didn't do much for me either.  Did you do a good walk around? I'm taking mines in Friday to have the hatchback glass fixed/refitted.
"They also drove it, breathed in it, possibly coughed in it.

Not saying you should worry about this but the drop-off is not the portion that even has the most risk."
Congrats! What color interior do you order....?
congrats ! finally seeing some delivery for So Cal ! still waiting for my VIN in the OC
"UPDATE: So check this out, this is one of those good news bad news situations. So in preperation for the Model Y, I needed to turn in my current car which was a Mazda, it was on a lease. I had about 4 months left but I dont have the room to have 2 cars at my place at once, so I made the decision to turn it in today fully prepared and thinking I would recieve my Model Y.

So I’m at the Mazda dealership in Glendale a few hours ago just having walked out after turning my old car in, happy as can be... THEN like a scene out of a movie I get a call from Tesla in Burbank telling me that my delivery wouldn’t be happening tomorrow because my car hasn’t even left the Freemont factory! I was confused by this because I recieved a text yesterday saying my car was in transit and out for delivery. It became clear that the indivdual on the phone didn’t know whether my car had even completed production. I was told it could be on the truck now and it hasn’t left yet or it hasn’t rolled off the line yet. I was obviously pretty bummed because I had just got this notice less than 24 hours before delivery and had just turned in my Mazda. I’m now left without a car.

I asked if they could give me a loaner because they couldn’t give me an estimate on when I would take delivery. I basically spent the next hour calling various showrooms around Los Angeles in search of a loaner vehicle to use in the mean time. Finally was able to track down one in Glendale and I’ll receive the car tomorrow with an update on the Model Y i bought. 

Just a crazy situation, I probably shouldve waited to take delivery before I turned in my mazda but hindsight is 20/20 and I was excited and had a plan, go figure. I understand with the virus things are just naturally going to be difficult so I get it.

In the morning I’m going to see if I can drive up to Freemont and get the car myself, who knows, i dont mind a little road trip.

Anyways I’ll keep you guys updated and see what happens."
"Congrats, that’s exciting! How long ago did Tesla assign your vin? I’m anxiously awaiting delivery on my MY performance but have heard nothing from Tesla in 2 weeks."
I think I saw your Y on a truck driving down the 5 fwy today. Happened to catch it out my office window near Magic Mountain. Congrats very exciting.
UPDATE: I have a loaner Model 3 and coordinated to have my Model Y delivered to my house on Saturday! LA County shut all non essential businesses down so we’ll see if all goes to plane.
Awesome! Sounds like Tesla’s rushing the Ys out before [we have to lock ourselves up. :)](https://youtu.be/Z0GFRcFm-aY)
"Please post a photo of the EPA portion of the Monroney (window) sticker.  [WWW.FUELECONOMY.GOV](https://WWW.FUELECONOMY.GOV) has ratings for 17 different 2020 model Teslas, but only 1 of those 17 is a Model Y (the Performance version).  Many of us are curious about the EPA rating (ie, range) of the Long Range AWD.  It should be clearly printed on the window sticker.  Thanks."
When did you order? I am tempted to the induction wheels to get my car sooner.
How much is the insurance portion of the payment if you don’t mind me asking?
Black Interior with FSD as well!
Thanks! I hope you get it soon! Shouldn’t be long now!
"Same thing happened to me, I feel a lot better about it now....sorry"
Happened with my model 3 in 2018. I would make sure to tell anyone you know you to not get rid of their current vehicle until they are actually driving the tesla off the showroom lot. Tesla is a great company but logistics is not one of their strong points.
You got the ole rich rebuilds shuffle
Literally just yesterday same day I got the VIN I recieved the text about my Model Y in transport to the Delivery center in Burbank. It was sudden to say the least.
$144 a month for me
"Yeah it kind of sucks but it is what it is i guess, delivery date now says the 21st at 11 so we’ll see"
Thanks for the quick reply! That gives me hope that I’ll get mine eventually after all! :)
Thank you - I’ve been wondering how long this would take.
Is this for full coverage? Collision included?
I’d say full coverage since he’s making payments
He is talking up the 3rd row a little too much.
THIS is the review I was wating for
He's ok
"4:52 do Tesla have voice control/assistant system? 
Of so, the rear passenger (who is frequent with Tesla) can ask the assistant instead of bothering the driver or the shotgun passenger?

Edit: 16:10 yeah, it wouldn't work, you need to tell at what temperature you want to set the seat at. Too much to understand for the voice assistant."
I got my email I was getting mine this month at the end of February. Still waiting for them to finish drafting my contract.  I wish I were no longer waiting.

"It does, but the driver invokes it by holding down one of the steering wheel scroll wheels. What you'd do is use the mobile app as a passenger, not ideal, but still possible on longer trips."
He finds an empty parking lot to record a review video in... and he's an asshole?
"I was at Tesla in Dedham, MA today and spotted these Model Y's being prepped for delivery. I couldn't find photos of this wheel combination online, so sharing for anyone trying to decide. Sorry I couldn't fine a blue one on site. I think they all look great in person."
A bit odd the Tesla logo on the frunk is chromed and not black.
"Oooooh, that red is really making me rethink my blue choice."
None with white interior? I’ll be picking up at the Dedham Tesla as well
I’ve always liked the red when it’s fully blacked out.
These are the only ones I could see out front.
There is a good post above this with red/white interior.
Yeah and it looks great with those new matte black induction wheels. The white looks great too.
I’m curious on this as well as I plan to get a model 3 this year
"It's likely cheaper, it's definitely going to be cheaper after they work out regulations and whatnot (using live data while driving), it's going to cover taxi/robotaxi service if/when that is a thing.

I can't think of anything else. An additional way to help support Tesla?"
"It is very easy to get a quote and switch car insurance. Almost as easy as creating a reddit post. I switch every two years as soon as they start messing with my ""bait and switch"" discount."
"You probably won't like the quote that Geico comes back with.  They're typically the most expensive on Tesla models.  

Also, if you are financing, Geico doesn't offer GAP insurance.  See more info here:  https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/3917644/"
Con: Tesla Insurance is only available in CA.
Thanks everyone for the feedback!
"It probably depends on the discounts you get with Geico. For example, I have progressive and did their snapshot program. I get 30% off my premium, so no other insurance comes close in price."
"Same here. Last year, rate went way up for no reason, no accidents, nothing changed, etc.. Insurance agent gave me some BS about rates being up with all companies due to hurricanes.... Complete BS because I got a quote from a different company that was $100 less per month"
"I agree. I get 25% off from bundling home and car plus multiple car policy so if I were to switch to Tesla Insurance, my homeowners plus insurance for only one car, goes up around $400 a year which makes it more expensive. Really does depend on all the discounts you already have which makes it hard to compare apples to apples when getting quotes."
"Congrats: Can't wait until I get notified I can get mine.  With regard to your ""accessories,"" Vinyl Console wrap in Matte white
Vinyl Matte Black badges for front and rear
Black / Silver tire valve caps

Why wrap the console, and what are the badges for?  Assuming your responses encourage acquisition by me: from where did you purchase them?"
"Glad to hear about the acceleration on the LR AWD vs. Performance.  I am teetering between the two.  Of course everyone and their brother seems to be getting the Performance and their reactions are always awesome.  Makes me really want one (that and they are a tad bit s3xyer).  But the reasoning side of me says LR AWD will be more than enough, especially not coming from a Tesla already."
Very exciting!  Just got off the phone and I pick up mine on Friday.
is the speed boost available?
"Purchase the wrap and badges from EV Wraps.  I wanted the aesthetic of White/Black/White.  Since its a white car with black wheels and interior, I feel the wood is out of place."
"Agreed, I hardly ever used ""Sport"" mode in my last car and 35 miles is a lot to sacrifice IMHO.  To those that want it though, they are both awesome options."
"Nope, not yet at least.  Hope to see it later this year"
"No, doesn't need it imo"
Does your Model Y have a performance VIN?
"5YJYGDEF7LF0027XX. I don't think so?  I'm not sure, I thought there was a P somewhere to Indicate performance."
"According to the Tesla VIN decoder, the F before the 7 (7 = model year 2020) indicates: F = Dual Motor – Performance. B = Dual Motor – Standard.

My State Farm insurances policy shows mine as Model Y Performance. Does your badge have a red underline? Any indication on the interface that it is performance?


https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-vin-decoder/amp/"
"Nope, no red underline or anything else to indicate that it would be performance.  I went with Progressive and only had a $54 annual increase from my previous vehicle."
That suuuuucks. Better to know now I suppose. 😕
"Literally happened to me yesterday, but they said the paint didn’t pass final inspection"
Blue balled
"I was supposed to take delivery on Friday, but they had to postpone citing the same reason.  Fortunately for me, they gave me a full days notice - which is good, because it’s a 5 hour drive for me to pick it up.  They haven’t rescheduled yet, as there’s no eta on the missing part (they won’t tell me what exactly is missing)... 😔"
"I'm suppose to take delivery in a couple of hours, so hopefully this doesn't happen. It's weird that it's happened as much as it has. Sorry!"
Same thing happened to me today! Annoying!
Dangit! So close!
"First-time Tesla buyers repeat after me: 

“Do not. 
Show up. 
For your. 
First. 
Delivery. 
Appointment.”

They cancel often due to last minute issues that come up when they prep your vehicle for delivery. Save yourself the heartache and just plan to show up the next day."
"Yeah exactly, and with everything going on in the world, this is small potatoes."
Wait ... paint didn’t pass inspection and they still shipped it to a delivery center???
Same here.  He's guessing a week but emphasized that's just a guess
Good luck!
What was the verdict?
"Is it OK to not show up? 
Kind of d*ck move a bit it though, no? Not helping their schedule."
"That's what they said 🤷🏻‍♂️

""This message is in regards to your Model Y delivery today. When we were doing final inspection we found some paint imperfections on the vehicle and we need to send it out to the factory for rectification."""
I've seen other post saying they had to wait because the cars arrived with faulty latches on the rear seats. Supposedly a known issue and fairly simple fix but still causing delays.
Got it! https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/fmo7d3/got_my_model_y_immediately_destroyed_the_rims/
In Layman's Terms: The vehicle was damaged in transit.
I see you added imperfections yourself ;)
"Yeah, totally fair.

For the record though this is a pickup at the Fremont delivery hub.....down the street from the factory"
Same with mine. It came off the semi with rock chips.
And long drives on empty roads
"I literally just said to my husband, too bad we don’t have our Model Y yet. I’d like to go camp in the middle of nowhere for a week or two."
"I was just inside admiring my model 3s sound system. Honestly one of the best I’ve heard so far with the only one that compares that is in the BMW X5 Harmon Kardon. 
I’ve sat in 335s with professional sound system 
Bmw m4 with Harmon kardon 2020
Acura RDX 2019 els 3D
Acura MDX 2010 els 
Mercedes Benz c class Burmeister 2018
Range Rover 2012 with Harmon kardon

The big touch screen along with being able to listen all day without pollution is a game changer. 
I’m sure the model y will be excellent as well."
"ha, i was just telling my wife the same thing. don’t have to worry about carbon monoxide or draining a tiny battery. cmon delivery email!"
"s/Social Isolation/everything/

Just waiting to get a MVPA..."
"Got it today.  So excited.  LR AWD FSD silver with 20"" induction wheels. Rep called me in the morning and told me to accept the loan terms and conditions online.  I paid for the remaining cost via a link to my bank account.  I then called him back and let him know it's all done.  An hour later, my Tesla was there in my driveway."
Saw one yesterday!  Blue of course.  My wife couldn’t understand why it’s so exciting (we were in our Model 3 at the time).
"Same here, also looking forward to getting to sit in one in a showroom."
"It’s fun! Teslas are so recognizable that it’s a great gauge of the adoption of EVs, at least for me."
Y this is exciting.
I don't see a sign of a trailer hitch. Anyone else see one?
[deleted]
The new wheels 🤤
that gap though! yikes
"I see the place you could install one here:

https://imgur.com/a/CeQOe6Z

^ That looks like a removable cover. I’m sure the hitch will be an accessory that you can buy after the fact and have it installed - like the roof rack."
Tell us more!
"It's supposed to be a crossover/suv, what did you expect?"
"Ah, your right. I missed it. I didn't know about the roof rack. Interesting."
I hope this is not the case
Im talking about the gap in the build flaw! Read the article? The build quality error. I have no idea as to what you think referring to.
"At least the roof rack was spotted in the wild:

https://electrek.co/2020/02/24/first-sighting-model-y-roof-rack/"
Clickbait article?
I thought you meant wheel gap
"So was the trailer hitch:

 [https://electrek.co/2019/12/03/tesla-model-y-prototype-spotted-tow-hitch/](https://electrek.co/2019/12/03/tesla-model-y-prototype-spotted-tow-hitch/)"
no
I’m waiting on a white with 20s and picking up in Salt Lake.  Is yours on the semi?
Me too!  White on 20s.  The wait is killing me...
Nope. I don’t have a Y reservation.
Are you picking up yours in SLC?  When did you order?
Ordered the first week they announced.  March 2019.  Picking up in SLC.  I’m waiting on a VIN and Elon is dragging his feet.  They’ve contacted me a few times and said their delivery goal is the end of March.  The wait is killing me!   Are you picking up in SLC?
"Yes.  Driving from Boise.  I’m waiting for a vin as well.  I was assigned an advisor on the 9th of March and basically I’m in a holding pattern.  No clue if I will get a VIN soon but crossing my fingers.  Advisor said (before all this COVID stuff) I would get the VIN in a matter of weeks, not months.  Who knows now that the fremont plant shuts down tonight."
"Do any of you have the MVPA link on your reservation page? It would be on the right in the Documents section below the Lemon Law Disclosure. Mine appeared there one day (it has your VIN) and I've even been able to pay for it, but still no delivery date.

I live in SF so it's pretty unlikely I'll be getting mine anytime soon, but it's so unclear to me how this process is suppose to work. Got a call yesterday and they said everything looked like it was in order and that I would get a text ""any minute"", but yeah... Nothing so far."
"I'm in the Bay Area and last night I was finally able to fill out payment information, waiting on the value of my trade-in (was originally going to sell my car but with shelter in place I don't think that's possible right now). Ordered in February. I wonder if they are trying to get as many cars as they can off the Fremont lot by getting people in the area to pick them up? Just a guess, I don't know.

EDIT: White/White, AWD, FSD, 19"" wheels"
Same boat here in same area. Not sure how things will go. Considering Tesla can't manufacture any cars these 3 weeks. They can however deliver. So unless our cars are built not sure anything will happen. Did you get a Vin?
Specs?
"Did they give you the VIN at the same time they confirmed it was built?  They called me Tuesday but I didn’t answer because I didn’t recognize the number, then they sent me an email with the VIN, but not much other info."
"I received the same call this morning. I asked the person on the phone how delivery would work, and she said that the delivery advisor can help with a touchless delivery. You would need to set up the Tesla app on your phone, then they would leave the keys in the car. The keys wouldn't be activated until you activate the car in the app.

No VIN in my account yet or MVPA. I'm also in SF."
Can you check source code on the website to see if it shows a vin?
Got a call yesterday to confirm. Ordered day one red on black awd 19s no FSD. I don’t think having or not having fsd changes a thing it’s software switch. Got my text on 7th no update since I’m in Florida
Bay Area also. No MVPA yet or VIN. I'm stuck on the insurance page with the Tesla insurance quote greyed out even though I've uploaded by proof of insurance as a JPG.
No MVPA link yet.  It’s definitely going to be an interesting time to take delivery. Let’s see how Tesla going to do it.  I don’t mind waiting if that means keeping everyone safe. But I don’t want to give my reservation to someone else that take my spot anyway . LOL
"similar situation, i’ve had mvpa for 2 weeks with vin but no word on delivery. i ordered day 1 (grey/black/performance/5 seat) and have seen the exact car delivered to people who ordered last month. i’m in reno so 3 hours from factory, what do you guys think?"
"I think now that the factory is shut down from building more cars, they want to push their inventory out ASAP"
Same situation for me.  Waiting on a VIN. It’s been a week so far.  I’m not feeling optimistic.
I didn’t get a vin nor a follow up call yet.  Let’s see tomorrow
LR AWD white ext/black int/ 19”/no FSD order end of feb2020
"No, I was not given a VIN. She said the purpose of her call was to confirm that I still want to take delivery this month. Which is why I’m curious as to when I will get a call for my delivery date. 

I’m thinking Musk is trying to push out all the vehicles this month before the government shut everyone down."
Looks like they are getting to ppl in the bay just to see who still wants it.
I’m curious how that works if there’s issues or work order you need to put in
That’s some forensic work there.  I just looked at the source code and looks like VIN hasn’t been assigned.
Thanks for sharing.  Perhaps they are trying to push it out to Californians were closest to the factory. Let’s see how long it’ll take them to txt me about my delivery
FWIW my insurance step is still visible as well. Not sure what that’s about. I think it just stays like that for some reason. Super confusing though
I was stuck here too so I texted Tesla about it when they reached out to confirm financing. The rep said the he manually approved the insurance step but I’m still seeing the same thing.
So I got my text today! Should get it delivered on Saturday! I’ll keep you posted
You'll probably get a call and text soonish. I received my text today and they say it will be delivered in the next 2-3 days. I'm in SF. Hang tight!
"Factory doesn’t stop building cars until Monday evening now. But yes, they want to get them out ASAP probably."
[deleted]
Someone mentioned it on a different post and a bunch of people found theirs so I was hopeful
Is there a public number you can text?
"Nice! Yes, lmk how it goes!"
Yup. I’m just as surprised how I already have a call from them.
Thanks for sharing that tip tho. I might look at it here and there to see the current situation.
I'm guessing he had a Sales Advisor assigned and had already been texting with him. I haven't gotten any calls or texts.
"At some point, someone will text to confirm your order. I took the liberty to ask a few questions and at some point he stopped replying when I asked “how long from this step?”"
[deleted]
I think you’re right. I got my text today and I could reply to it directly.
I was able to complete the steps rather quickly. Don’t remember the duration on each step tho. But I checked the website on the daily basis to see if they are asking for any new info and would complete it immediately. Now I’m at the insurance step and drafting contract page. The latest since then was the call from yesterday.
"What's your build? Mine is LR AWD, white paint with black interior, 20"" rims and no FSD."
Same here except I drank the kool-aid and got FSD
"congrats ! I have the same config, in So Cal, still no word on my vin or pickup schedule yet, I am happy to see this is moving forward for many with AWD LR"
"Where in VA are you? 

I am waiting for my AWD LR Model Y 19"" Blue ext Black int. My pickup will be Tysons/Tyco"
Just got my VIN 2696.
"Congrats!  Somewhat related question, but what is the general consensus on FSD?  It follows the car, not the owner, and it seems like the current hardware will never actually support FSD."
"Please take and post pics. There are a ton of pictures/video of performance but not many non-p with the 20"" wheels"
When did you order the model Y?
"I recently canceled my model Y order, it was arriving at my door next Tuesday in Northern Virginia. Too much stuff going on right now to take in a car :/"
How can you get a delivery date without a VIN?  This purchasing process is driving me crazy.
"I’m generally curious on the purchasing process for ppl that live in states where insurance is required.  I ordered a non-performance, white exterior, black interior, 20 inch, non FSD, LR AWD at the beginning of Feb and I am stuck in the waiting for a VIN no mans land.  I live in Boise, ID but opted to pick the vehicle up in SLC in order to fast track a delivery date.  Everything seemed to be moving along well, all action items checked registration, credit pre-approval, etc.  I was assigned a delivery person.  Spoke with them several times and they cannot seem to give me any idea whether my Y is built or when I will get a VIN.  Just odd.  I got a call yesterday from someone asking whether I still want the vehicle because I guess some are opting to delay?  I wish I was one of those ppl."
My pickup is near Richmond Virginia
"I pick up my White AWD LR FSD Blk Interior 20"" Induction Wheels Y from Tysons on Monday!"
Well if you mean full self-driving as being able to drive in any conditions that's definitely many years off. But for stuff like city driving and highway driving they're actually not that far off.
Late January.
"Nice, I’m in Richmond. I’m glad to hear someone in the area is getting their car."
"I’m picking up my MY on Saturday in Richmond. Blue, AWD LR, 20” wheels."
I suspect it's the first one delivered in RVA! Can I stop by and take a look see? I'm not expecting mine delivered to RVA for a few months.
"Outside of the visual cues on the display, what does FSD offer over Autopilot (serious question)?"
"It offers navigate on autopilot which will take on ramps and off ramps for you, it will change lanes automatically, you'll get smart summon which really isn't that good, and a few other features The biggest thing though is that you'll get all future updates for free and you'll also get hardware 3. I also do believe that stop light and stop sign stopping will be coming soon like within a month."
Thanks. I thought things like navigation on auto pilot and smart summon were part of  auto pilot only.  Same with HW 3 on a newly bought model 3 with or without FSD.
"My understanding is that it's trying to park itself between other cars. It's not looking for lines, it's looking for obstacles to space itself between. So if you parked in that spot you can see in the background, it might work better. But then you've got real stakes if it messes up :)"
Becareful using those features honestly they are just for random fun. Seen too many videos of that stuff failing and crashing into other cars. Telsa states these features are in betas and do not take responsibility for outcomes.
I don’t use it pretty much ever. Ince the big hw3 rewrite comes out soonish I’ll give it another go. The old hw2.5 doesn’t even use all the cameras technically. It’s also really just using the sonar sensors to see other cars and parks between them so if no other cars are parked it has no idea what to do.
Mine works properly sometimes... other times it tries to commit suicide and I have to stop it.
"Looks good to me... Situation Normal... 

What are you complaining about?"
"Only works decently in parallel parking in my experience. It sucks at regular parking. Like what’s mentioned above, you need to be in between cars for it to work"
"I've never seen it work. In fact, the only time I've seen it activate is in some drive throughs, thinking the space between the menu and the building is a parking space. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
No smaht pack like Hyundai?.. :-)
"No, it doesn’t work well. I saved a Model 3 from taking out another one in the Tesla parking lot when trying it out. Hit the brakes and the employee seemed embarrassed. This was ~6 months ago."
"Come on people !!

This is the neural network adjusting to the virus. It is making you keep your social distance. 

Not a failure /s"
Exactly. I was certainly being cautious to maintain distance from other vehicles. I’ve already put a scratch on one rim. Not ready for a door ding!
"This. Even if rare, there are plenty of reports of it hitting cars or curbing the tires.  I suggest pretending it doesn’t exist."
Just needs a smarter owner apparently. 😀
"Autopark is not something I use, ever. This is because I never want to be parked next to someone who will door-ding me... Which is everyone on the planet. Always park next to curbs or blanked off spots so you can hug one side and put more distance between you and the other dirty bastards... Otherwise known as everyone else. 

Congratulations on the Tesla! I bet you're having an absolute blast!"
Maintain social distance.
So much this. Now I find random people parking by me in the middle of nowhere. Had no idea why until a recent conversation with a coworker. He mentioned someone else at work got dinged up and he liked parking next to me so my car would record it if something similar were to happen to him. Haha. Sigh.
"Yes, except the whole WFH thing means I’ve hardly driven it yet much. (93mi on the odometer)"
"I want mine but it's literally been sitting at ""we are drafting your contract"" for a full 2 weeks. I think they must be figuring out how they'll deliver it to Alaska before they have me pay.

I wish I had it now. I'm a substitute teacher, so I'm not working at all. Long drives would be a great way to break the monotony."
