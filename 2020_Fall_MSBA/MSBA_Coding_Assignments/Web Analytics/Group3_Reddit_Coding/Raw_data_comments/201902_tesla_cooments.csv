Now if only AP will also lay on the horn in cases like this.
"if (goingToCrash)

Glad you and the car are safe.

The folks over at r/roadcam would probably enjoy seeing this.
"If anyone from Tesla frequents this subreddit, I can send them the longer video and my car info if that helps prove that AP is, not only safe, but can help prevent accidents. "
The other car was probably in a hurry to get to Mohegan Sun
"Make it so you can create your own macros. 

Evade car > start honking > flash lights > open side window > eject assault pennies...

Sounds great to me! "
Lol exit 74 East Lyme... How am I not surprised.
Hey Niantic! 95 North is dangerous !
"I consider crawling like this past parallel cars at a very low speed differential is asking for trouble. You spend so much time in their blind spot, they have no idea you're there.

It raises my blood pressure whenever I have to do it. But I almost never _have to_ do it so I speed up to get things done promptly."
"Fucking shoulder check before you switch lanes. It's not that goddamn hard. If you paid attention in driver training it's like one of the first things they teach. The world needs less of these asshats. Learn to drive properly, or take the fucking bus."
Autopilot frees your hands so you can man the front mounted Gatling gun. 
I‚Äôve watched the video for a few minutes now and it looks like he just keeps trying to run you off the road. Seems intentional... s/

Follow the [SAE method](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15131074/how-to-adjust-your-mirrors-to-avoid-blind-spots/) to eliminate blind spots. Glad OP avoided the asshat who couldn't be bothered to adjust their mirrors or look over their shoulder."
"well.. I would say the Autopilot saved YOU from an accident, not your model 3. Life comes first, then your car."
"Wouldn't be nice if data (speed, AP status,...) Was overlaped on to the video?"
"Oh what a small world, this is Flanders/ east Lyme connecticut. 

Where I grew up!"
Does autopilot avoid staying in other driver's blind spots? That's something I try to do when I'm driving.
What a fucking retard
Just a note that the safety features come standard and do not require autopilot.
Did..... Did he swerve at you? 
I feel like ppl are doing this on purpose to test your tesla lol
I would lay on the horn and give that guy the works. I've had that happen several times but I always disengage AP and I've never seen AP actually actively avoid any situation but it seems more capable due to the increased camera coverage (ultrasonics were mostly useless and too slow).
Does every Tesla have an option to review a video of the last drive? How do you interface with this feature? Where does it download or upload to? 
"Ah yes, CT I-95 Exit 74, Classic speed trap there... 65mph speed limit for miles, then halfway down this huge hill it cuts to 50. Cops wait on that on ramp with the radar gun aimed uphill and pullover anyone that didn‚Äôt slow down in time. 

That causes people to drive squirrelly all the time. Most people don‚Äôt know/care that the speed limit gets cut down 15mph so you get a lot of tailgating, fast stops, and sudden lane changes. 

My guess is this Camry driver was frustrated that the guy in the left lane was moving so slow, and just tried to pass him without signaling or checking his blind spot. "
"Honestly I think it would be better if auto pilot didn't have you linger in that cars blind spot. Depending on traffic I never hover on the back corner of a car on the highway, I will try to get in front of it. "
"Is this actually legit ? Last time I saw a video where the autopilot saved a Tesla from a spin, someone in the comments explained that this would be impossible because  there are safety measures that prevent a fast change in steering angle and speed. "
I can't believe there are still plenty of people bitching about Tesla autopilot
Woah
/r/Roadcam
It won't be long before swerving infront of Teslas to see how they react is a new sport.
"My Model 3 did this exact same maneuver, to avoid destroying a Harley rider who thought it would be fun to swoop across 5 lanes of Bay Area rush hour traffic and right into ME."
"People like that make me not want to drive

&#x200B;"
I'd like to see autopilot try a snow covered Wyoming road with worn out street markings. 
"one day there will be lights only at pedestrian crossings and we will be seating in our car, screaming at the computer because we are late but our car will not give a shit because bus 49 just turned right on Poppycock Avenue and it is scheduled to drive at 33km/h to pass before us at the end of the street."
Wtf is that car doing ????
"If AP is going constant speed, this is a semi-fault of AP. It needs to be smarter. When passing another car on adjacent lanes, it has to speed up a bit, especially at the blind spots of other drivers. This is what a human driver would do when driving defensively. You avoid sitting in other car's blind spots for too long. You'd speed up or slow down to avoid it. "
"Ok. Is this i95 going through East Lyme CT? 

This road looks crazy familiar. "
Maybe pass a little quicker so you dont sit in others blind spots.
That other idiot shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to drive.
"I love to drive, I like to think I could react that quickly, but I still want that feature on my car."
Damn I wish my car held the presence like the Tesla... all it did was shake its head ‚Äúno‚Äù and it deterred the other car.
"I know that area! The 395 area in Niantic can definitely be a hectic place to drive through, especially with the speed limit change."
"Oohhh Tesla, I better check if AP works. Oohhh wow, it does work. "
"Gotta Love a Tesla!
"
"Yes that corolla has also tried to get me, welcome to the 95/395 area of Southeastern CT. Also watch out for a silver Sonata with an equally clueless driver."
"Ah, 95 in CT. The worst stretch of highway east of California."
I-95 through East Lyme is full of shitty drivers like this. Whenever there's an accident it gets backed up for miles. 
That is amazing! I‚Äôve always been wondering how it would react to a situation like this. Awesome!
"LOL looks like the other driver was on autopilot, too!"
Has to be Massachusetts.
I'm impressed as hell but it looks like it over corrected. Like the back end looks like it's really unstable. is it purposefully so violent of a response?
"Flanders four corners exit 74 in Niantic CT!! Stop by and say hi to my friend Rick, he‚Äôs an alright guy! "
"Or watch the car and brake without AP going mental and nearly putting you into a fishtail. 

Plenty of clues when a driver is about to switch lanes (without the obvious indicator). Glad all ended well but if you were paying attention AP would not have been required."
people who merge like this deserve a special place in hell
Saves u not ur car.
Yeah this screams 95
Oh East Lyme......
Fucking Corolla drivers I swear !!!!
Now it should chase that fucker. 
Oh I-95N in East Lyme one of the worst stretches for accidents as evidenced by this video. 
95 is the fucking worst
"Nice one Elon, where ever you are on reddit."
How do you know this was AP?
95 by where the Clydesdale statues used to be?
That‚Äôs the exit to my house!
Just noticed that was in my part of CT. Still glad you're OK.
CHECK üëè YOUR üëè BLIND üëè SPOTS üëè
Tesla just needs to make a compilation video of all of these for their next commercial.  
Is this the same portion of road that some dude in a motorbike kicks a car that leads to a series of events that results in a car flipping in the right hand side of the road? 
"pretty dope AP saved u monies and damage to the car. but imho i think the jerk it carried out couldve been more dangerous of a crash.

&#x200B;

but obviously that didnt happen and this post is meaningless"
"That was a bit abrupt. If the road was slippery, you would have ended up off the road."
I want to wire the early-warning chime to an air horn in my frunk!!!
Why is your fov so narrow?
Holy shit that is amazing!!
Off subject...but 95 N in CT! 
I fucking hate people who do this... check if you're clear scumbags.
did these people get their licenses in cereal boxes?
"Really cool. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to not have my car save me, but it‚Äôs nice to know what it‚Äôs capable of. "
"This is great but I can‚Äôt help but point out the poor positioning by the AP in the blind spot.  Or let me be clearer, the AP has a long way to go when it comes to defensive anticipatory driving. I drive on the highway a lot and I can usually see this coming based on several factors that would be hard for current AI to manage. Maybe just blind spot mgmt in general would prevent this. AP could maybe speed past or slow/coast to provide a possible lane changer an ‚Äúout‚Äù. "
Autopilot should be aware of blind spots. 
Now if only autopilot wouldn't hang around c pillar blind spots.
"Niantic, CT area?"
"I think you/people in general should drive faster if and when in the left lane so you dont drive parallell or really slowly passing other cars. At the same time, in most cases, stay in right lane and pass in the left. 
100% idiot in other cars fault for almost causing an accicedent. 
Just saying, it looks like you could up your driving yourself. 
Bring the pitchforks 
"
"Does the Tesla autopilot include a ""not being an asshole camping in the passing lane"" option?"
"Glad you weren‚Äôt hurt.
I would consider this an ‚Äúokay‚Äù reaction from a panicked mediocre human driver. 

What‚Äôs actually scary is AP lazing about in other‚Äôs blind spots in Connecticut. There‚Äôs better gambling at Mohegan sun. 



"
I don't get why the driver on the right just keeps trying to change lanes into the guy
Strong state license plate to inability to drive ratio.
That Tesla autopilot was cruising at the same speed in the blind spot of that car causing the accident and then preventing it imo. Not very safe if you ask me
"I sincerely hope that AP didn't jerk the wheel like that, it seems like something you did OP and then the traction control saved your ass from spinning out. If this was a wet road I don't think that could've been saved. Very lucky on your part OP. "
Looks like autopilot didn‚Äôt save you from driving in the passing lane 
Imma hazard a guess: All-season tires?
"Soon traffic fatalities will reduce greatly and then Will Smith will complain about it, because it's more human to die from stupidity and ego.

Who gets the reference? :D"
Soon there will be a social media viral video craze of people checking Teslas on the highway . . . . Mark my words
"That's straight up quicker response time and more delicious an evasion maneuver than 99% of humans could perform in that situation. Badass tech, saving lives. "
Creeping up into someone‚Äôs blind spot... shoulda approached faster. Be seen
"I was passing the cars on the right. Interestingly enough, navigate on autopilot had actually directed me that way. "
"NOPE, that looked a few degrees off a full spin and crash. You were bloody lucky OP, I think this was traction control that saved your bacon tbh (AP may have hit the breaks for you)"
[deleted]
[deleted]
"Just curious, how did you record this? Is it the built-in software recorder? Glad you are safe. "
That‚Äôs not due to autopilot though. Collision avoidance comes standard.
"I don't drive that often now since I work from home, but the amount of videos that show this feature off tell me this happens a lot more than I've seen it. "
I‚Äôd like to think when it centred back to the road it‚Äôs trying to put that damn car 
"Thanks Elon, very cool"
"Seems like it over corrected a bit but still a good save
"
"Nubkin question.  Will Tesla's only respond like this while in autopilot? Eg, if you were just cruising along without adaptive cruise control or autopilot, would this have been a wreck?"
Anyone know if these safety features come with the car or does it come with the advanced autopilot option? 
"This road looks familiar. Is it the highway going into Canada from Blaine, WA? "
That's my exit! This area has a ton of accidents and is constantly backed up in the summer. Good job Elon! You saved me from 20 minutes of traffic that day.

Wow
Where's the 3rd person view? We all no one can actually drive in 1st person mode. 
I'd like to see more of this video. Did the car signal and OP ignored the signal and continued to pass. I'm not saying OP was at fault but a lot of these types of incidents can be avoided by paying attention and being courteous.
Wtf was the moron next to you thinking and doing? 
"The person in the right car has their left mirror adjusted to see behind them which is improper use of the mirror. It should be adjusted to see in your blind spot to your left. Before you lane change you should check your back mirror, side mirror then glance to the side. At no time should another car not be visible from one of these three areas."
The thing is.. when we have a mix of people and robots on the road it‚Äôs going to feel really unnatural. People underestimate how important it is we all react in the same (sometimes dumb) way. 
Look at these robots stealing our car crash fatality statistics
And you got to do a gnarly power slide. Double win. 
"I can‚Äôt tell you how many times my TM3 has seen things before I did, or avoided accidents like this. Just the other day I was spared from a non-signal dramatic lane change like this and a car pulling out across traffic with in a couple of hours. 

I am happy you avoided an accident. I bet you feel even more confident in your Tesla purchase. "
WTF IS HE DOING? That pisses me off
Another Masshole on the roads. 
I watched that three times before I realized it was looping.
Blind spots no bueno 
"395 down by the casinos?

Also, fucking massholes (masshole checking in)."
"I hate when people do this (swerve over as if you aren't there). On top of that, they usually get mad and flip you off as if you were the one at fault, LOL"
At least they oopsied back into their lane
I hope the other driver lost their license!
"Serious question... if the AP moves the car over like that, will the car straighten itself out, or does the driver have to do it?  Also... if the driver is driving and something like this happens, does the AP take control of the steering wheel?"
Did AP blow the horn?
(almost) r/perfectloop
That‚Äôs impressive 
"There was this time on the 405 freeway when the car on my left decided to change into my lane.  I could not brake in time and had to instinctively move right to avoid the collision.  Thankfully the car on my right was a bit behind me but layed on the horn so I have to move back to my lane.  I honked almost in unison with my elevated heartbeat.

But when I caught up and was next to the offending driver, I see a terrified young girl, not making eye contact but mouthing an apology and shaking her head.  My anger melted away and I thought of all the drivers who don't have Senna-like driving skills, like my family members, my own sons when they just go their license, grandpa, nieces and nephews, the teenage kids of my friends...

From then on, I do give kudos to those drivers who were inevitably gotten cut off and nary flinched let alone sounded the horn.  Was there injustice?  Is the feedback a necessary evil?"
tell me you gave them the bird
Boy I can't wait until Fox News covers the story to show how good Tesla's can be!
"Does it take over while u are driving manually?

Or is this on full auto pilot at this point?"
Dude is in cahoots with Tesla for this stunt
"Wow, that bastard just keeps making the same lane change error!"
"It would be helpful to know which actions were AP and which were driver.  We'll never know because it happened so fast, unless Tesla shares that information (as the system would have already sent this data to Tesla)."
Changing lanes without checking the mirror /r/IdiotsInCars/
"If only that other car had autopilot, a dangerous situation could have been avoided altogether!"
Wow the quality of this dash cam is amazing! Mind sharing the model?
Was this on 395?
"Tesla noob and enthusiast here, what is the difference between AP 1.0, 2.x and 3.0?
"
Woah that was a judo level dodge 
Looks to me like the autopilot tried it's damndest to initiate a spin. But then stability control saved the day. 
This is not an Autopilot thing. Even without Autopilot the car would have yet to avoid the hit.
Is that a Massachusetts license plate I peep?
"I think the correct future use of autonomous vehicles will be either fully autonomous OR allowing the driver to drive themselves but with that Guardian feature working in the background. 

For example for supercars like Lamborghinis, how awesome would it be if you could drive how you‚Äôre meant to drive that car but if the car senses danger of any kind it would be able to avoid obstacles and guide you to safety. "
"OP. Ever think that it's some ass hat who was trying to fuck with your car? People been ICEing in other cities. Also people in Arizona slashing waymo car tires... 

Just saying looks intentional."
"r/idiotsincars for the other dude, not op "
What's with the colors on that camera? Is that how it looked out there that day? 
That's amazing. I am so glad that now a day newer cars have so many safety features and I also wish that more cars had autopilot or a self driving feature.
"Whatever happened there wasn't ideal.  Even if AP can execute a swerve, if the driver has the ability to take over, they'll likely over-correct as happened here.


Braking might have been the best option, and maybe an automated horn or other sound, the moment the car touched the center line or sooner if it had its turn signal on.  "
JESUS FUCK IS THAT DRIVER FUCKING STUPID !? Great footage OP but glad your okay !
Can you please elaborate on how autopilot reacted/maneuvered here?
good bot
"A few months ago I think AP saved my life. I don't drive a Tesla, but one passed one the left the same time a bmw passed me on the right, I was going about 125kph, they were easily 20-30 faster than me.  


They merged into each other in the same lane in front of me, 3 lane highway, 4 cars wide. It happened so fast I think I was the only person who saw it coming. Bmw didn't flinch I don't think he saw until it was over. Tesla at the last second swerved to avoid the BMW, then swerved again the avoid the car beside him. tesla went up on its left two wheels, speed wobbled and then came down and then did a 180 and spun out into the shoulder in reverse. 

I can't imagine the human driver threaded the needle so precisely, and then regained control of the spin facing the wrong direction after a single half turn. 

to bad I don't have a dash cam :( but AP is pretty awesome and I'm grateful.    "
Leave it on autopilot so you can flip him off with both hands.
Does it auto-honk like a true road rage maniac?
A horrible Massachusetts driver?  :O
"Tesla is the future of driving, I swear to god. "
"I'm glad you're safe, but don't hang out in the left lane.  It is for passing only."
Hey have I seen this exact stretch of road in so many accident videos? Where is this? Why is it so dangerous?
You were lucky that obstacle was moving. 
"The beauty of dashcams is the irrefutable evidence of someone losing control of their vehicle.

I often wonder about the legal ramifications about uploading this sort of footage to the local highway or municipal police force. 

A warning could be issued to the insured owner and demerits applied to insurance rates.  
IDGAF if this makes other drivers rats, but here in BC our provincial auto insurance company is in serious jeopardy due to shitty management as well as shitty drivers. 

Obviously we don't all drive expensive cars here but check out this [fucknut](https://bc.ctvnews.ca/800k-spent-by-icbc-on-ferrari-repairs-not-enough-owner-says-1.3839383) driver. "
"Wow, weird when you recognize the area. I-395 near Mohegan Sun/Foxwoods casino"
I'll be impressed when your car automatically beats the shit out of the other driver.
What a Masshole. 
Thank you elon. Very cool
What would happen if the person kept driving into you? Would your autopilot put you into oncoming traffic?
"But car broke his neck, sooooo..."
"Ok, I have to ask. Was this really autopilot and not just OP being aware and avoiding the accident on their own? Because this is amazing. 

Don't you have to have your hands on the wheel to use autopilot, did OP just let go of the wheel when it started making large inputs to the wheel? 

What would have happened if OP tried making corrections caused in the midst of this autopilot action and causing an accident? who would have been at fault, OP for interrupting the system, or the Tesla for spooking the driver by making such abrupt maneuvers.
"
"Brake, never swerve - thats what insurance is for "
That was pretty close though. You‚Äôd have been fine but coulda been bad for that corolla if it weren‚Äôt for inches
Q
Gotta love CT drivers
Damn. That is probably the best footage of autopilot avoiding an accident. I wonder how far it will go in order to acoid a collision - this one looked pretty close to losing control. Will it go for a spin-out in order to prevent a collision?
This is some Code Geass shit
Ll***
The future is looking good
I‚Äôm going to college I guess
i know this isn't the point but is this East Lyme
/r/idiotsincars
Leaves both hands free for using both middle digits
*confused screaming*
Saved you from idiot driver heard !üëç
Did it honk ?
This looks so close to a spin out...
I hope you drove to that guys house and set it on fire in a passive aggressive manor.
Holy shit these tesla cars are amazing. 
"This computer has been playing to much Forza Horizon 4, any other computer would have spun out."
I'd love to buy one but it's almost a price of a dam 1 bedroom house that I also need
More companies now a days should focus on adding collision prevention systems like this.
This exact same thing happens to me today (without the autopilot and owning a Tesla :((  ) but I luckily noticed it before he almost crashed into me and I had to go as closely to the wall as possible
neat but it looks to me like it should have braked a bit before having to swerve.
"Would it make economical sense for Tesla to equip all cars with crash-prevention tech regardless of whether or not the driver has paid for the AP or FSD package?

Think about it. It would mean fewer crashes for Teslas meaning fewer cars to service, fewer people waiting for parts to be ordered..."
Ahhh 95 through east Lyme. One of the worst places in the world. 
Typical Masshole
Don't drive slowly in the left lane... AP is going to drive me crazy. 54 in the left lane! 
Did the auto pilot stick a finger in the air and honk the horn?
Serious question: are Teslas the only cars that can do this?
will AP make sure to not ram you into the median divider?
Wow. Would‚Äôve been terrified to hit that wall barrier too 
"As much as I‚Äôd like to believe these maneuvers were truly due to autopilot, I‚Äôm almost certain they are not. I own two Tesla‚Äôs with autopilot enabled and they do not make quick moves like this. Some day, definitely! But as of right now, we‚Äôve got a ways to go. Still mind blowing, what it‚Äôs capable of. Makes me really excited for the future!"
Are Model 3's prone to Fishtailing? The Auto Pilot seems to struggle a little bit to get the car going straight again. Still better than what i would have done thought
Is that 280 heading to Newark? Because that stretch needs all autopilot equipped vehicles. 
Let me fix your headline ‚ÄúAutopilot successfully avoids a dumbass‚Äù
that was pure luck honestly. 
"That stretch of 95 (near Niantic, CT) is pretty bad. A lot of accidents in that area. Glad you weren‚Äôt hurt."
Was this taken with the Tesla USB camera thing? Or do you have an actual camera?
What a jackass. Glad you're okay! 
"This would erase 90% of my driving anxiety, fuck I wanna have money."
Media: Does not align with paid agenda. *covers eyes and ears*
I drive on this highway by this exit on the way to my grandma's house. Small world
Can't wait to ghost ride my autobot
"""Tesla autopilot, better driver than shitheads who dont use their mirrors when changing lanes""

Sorry, i really hate shitty drivers."
What the hell was he even doing?
"Of all the posts i have seen, this one i know and completely understand. As is i use to drive thru that area of i95. I have family by there, mostly take back roads now tho to avoid those kind of drivers."
What an asshole!!!!!
"Life goals 
1. Buy a Tesla
2. That‚Äôs it"
I know that strip of highway. Oh and fuck out of state drivers. 
This guy would‚Äôve gotten the 10 second horn. 
Yeah its the car that is important not like you are in it
"I don't know much about Tesla and I think this is a good place to ask a question: does this autopilot take full control when an accident is about to happen, or does it only signal it?"
I would need new britches after that. I'd probably take the crash better than the car acting alive lmao...
This technology is gonna kill Nascar.
/u/stabbot
I noticed your car didn't get right in that guys ass afterwards and start threatening his life. I guess Tesla's are really overrated.
"that driver probably thinking ""damn good thing that guy was paying attention."" 

&#x200B;

Looks over to see no one driving. "
What highway is this ? Oregon?
Had this exact situation on day 2 with the car. I was pissed at the other driver but shout out to the car. 
"Im impressed the car swerved, avoided the wall and then again avoided the car"
"Looks like it lost control, it could have just slowed down and leaned left or honked lul. A lot of AP clips look good but this one doesn't. A bit unnecessarily aggressive on the swerve."
"I would live to see the 360 view of this.  Come on, give us a 360 dashcam!"
Seems to me it‚Äôs some of it is your fault. You either pass on the left lane or move to the right lane. You can just ride the other drivers tail
leave it to east lyme ct to have terrible driving. hense why there‚Äôs always traffic
"Happened to me today. Model 3 automatically saved me from an accident with a blind spot merger coming into me.  Incredible technology.  Not going back, Getting in line for Model Y as soon as possible."
Can you hit the horn as this is happening without interfearing with AP?
It nearly overdteered...
"By any chance is this I-95 North by East Lyme, CT?"
r/idiotsincars
"Next time, try actually passing when in the passing lane."
"Bullshit. You almost got yourself in an accident by allowing autopilot to loiter in someone‚Äôs blind spot. 

Autopilot isn‚Äôt safer than a human driver, yet, but the human-machine team can be safer if you and autopilot make up for each other‚Äôs deficiencies. 

A good rule of thumb is to always work to minimize surprise for other drivers, including minimizing time spent in blind spots.  In this case autopilot barely recovered from it‚Äôs own (and the other driver‚Äôs) mistake. "
99/100 drivers would have under/overreacted and crashed in this scenario.
"So I'm glad it worked out for you, but this was very close to ending badly. A driver that was paying attention could have recognized what was happening and avoided it with much less drama. Again, I'm glad it worked out for you.

Edit: I guess people don't like hearing the truth? All praise the all knowing, expert driving AP!"
Did AP honk the horn?
Yikes that autopilot needs some work. It should have just slowed down not swerved. If the road was icy you‚Äôd spinning out.
"A friendly reminder to adjust your mirrors until you can no longer see the sides of your car. They're not there to admire the outside of your vehicle, they're there to peek into your blindspots. "
Know how I avoid this type of accident 100% of the time with no extra tech? Get in the fucking right lane unless you're passing! Works like a charm.
"So the driver on the right made an error, but autopilot did not anticipate that passing someone at a speed just slightly beyond the car being passed could very well lead to this scenario. 

When I pass someone on the highway, I‚Äôm aware of that moment that I‚Äôm living in their blind spot. I try not to stay there very long and I know there is an increased risk while I‚Äôm there. 

Autopilot is sensing constantly and reacts faster than a human can, but will it be able to avoid being in that situation in the first place someday?

"
If the other driver was on her cell phone i would have been livid. 
does AP know when it's in a blind spot of another car? 
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but aren‚Äôt you supposed to go off autopilot in these cases? 
Of course the person almost causing an accident is a Masshole!
"I swear everyday when I go on a drive, Toyota drives are the most retarded. I'm sorry but its like everytime. Glad that beautiful model got saved bud!"
"Bro you‚Äôre cruising in their blind spot. If you‚Äôre gonna pass him, pass him.

"Maybe the autopilot could pass a bit faster in the first place, and not sit in blind spots?"
[deleted]
Looks like it almost caused one. A smart driver would have seen the initiation of that lane change and simply braked. The swerve and small slide was very unnecessary.
Any idea why the other car randomly decided to move his car to the same piece of road yours was in?
Plus it displayed an informative trouble code:  8LL 581.
"You even see the car coming near 3 seconds before the AP reacts, what the hell are you doing while driving to miss that?"
/r/interestingasfuck
"Crash test all they like, this accident is avoidable only in a Tesla."
"Wow what was that guy doing? Huge left swerve and i cant see any obstruction on the road.

"Almost lost one of my parents due to a similar crash a while back, where my mom overcorrected and drove into the median and rolled the car. Glad you're safe OP, but I genuinely hope that it was not AP that decided to swerve into the wall because, if it was, this is not an admirable feat of automated driving. It's a pretty big fail. Looks like it straightened you out pretty well, at the least!"
Sorry this is cool and all but this happens extremely frequently and rarely results in an accideny

"It kills me people don't use their horns in situations like this, it's literally what it's for. "
The car should have been aware that there was a barrier on the left and not swerve that much. Should have braked a little bit more.
How can you criticize a car that does this. This video alone is amazing!

This is something I have been suggesting for a while. Honking the horn would have let the idiot know they are in the process of causing an accident and would have probably gotten them back in their lane quicker.
"Fuggedaboutit package includes:

""Hey! I'm drivin' ova hea!""

""MORON!"""
AP 'horn' should sound different to regular horn also
Now if only AP would give a finger on top of honking 
And call the cops while instantly uploading the footage to twitter @yourlocalpd
"I also tought that but i am not entirely convinced if it is a good idea. Humans handle  extreme situations poorly, a honk could also cause a deadly overreaction. "
I live in Vietnam and horns don‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs like the boy who cried wolf here. Kinda crazy. 
Like spotto for human drivers.
"Also, maybe AP will prevent people from cruising in the left lane as well, which is intended for passing only."
"#this#

The computer could be super fast on this and maybe even prevent the other car from keep invading the lane. "
"Needs to flip off the other driver, too."
Tweet Elon. Probably would make it happen. 
But that would‚Äôve woken the driver up. What‚Äôs the point in autopilot 
And it needs a middle finger installed in the mirror. So when you pass them they get saluted.
With AP you can hang out the window with a bullhorn and a giant foam middle finger. 
"Right? AP might be cool, but when will this technology flip them the bird for me too? /s"
"That's in the EAP II, Enraged Autopilot.

It'll be an extra $6000 if purchased in early access version, $7000 otherwise."
"Phases of alerting:

1. Flash some lights towards the dude
2. Announce: Wow dude stop swerving, I'm here
3. Major bull horn, with middle finger"
"Use dash cam to record license plate, submit evidence, and file charges"
Nah it just uploads the footage directly to the offending vehicles insurance provider.
I think it would eventually lead to a lawsuit. I could see lawyers twisting it around and saying the person was lane changing and the AP Horn feature caused our client to crash after being startled or some shit.
And send the police the footage of careless driving of the other guy automatically...
"Careful, that could get you shot.

As for me, I'm waiting for the pit maneuver upgrade. I just hope we get it before the pit maneuver avoidance upgrade!"
"Yup, those humans suck."
I couldn't figure out what the associated press had to do with his horn. 
Can AP3.0 automatically throw my old Starbucks onto their windshield? 
Inb4 horns max mode
Robotic middle finger extends to let the other driver know what‚Äôs up. 
And automatically raise an extended middle finger.
...and flip them off too. 
Hey I‚Äôm Elon musk our engineers are working on it now
Or not coasting in another cars blind spot. 
AP is not FSD. The driver of the Tesla should have intervened.

I swear I saw something a while ago about Tesla asking for examples of things like this.  Might be worth reaching out to them.
they have all your data. more than you think.
All you have to do is post it on twitter and tag Elon lol 
"That‚Äôs cool and all but avoiding a single accident does in no way prove AP is safe. It is great tech but it is constantly evolving and will never be absolutely 100% safe. There are an infinite amount of variables and situations to account for currently. 

Once it surpasses being safer than a human driver, which it may have already done, then we can consider it as a safe tech, but not completely safe as nothing is 100% safe."
"AP also almost caused an accident in this situation. Given it was a result of someone coming in your lane, but there was no need for it cause a scenario where your car started going sideways. I wouldn't champion this video as a prime example of AP being safe. You got lucky."
It can also cause accidents

"It's not though, unless AP ""knew"" how far out of the lane it can go before hitting the wall (to avoid road hazards?).

"I forget where, but I remember reading once that a 5mph differential is best when passing.  Moving out of their blind spot relatively quickly but not going so much faster that a driver may misjudge your speed or not see you coming."
[deleted]
"> I consider crawling like this past parallel cars at a very low speed differential is asking for trouble. 

I agree.

> You spend so much time in their blind spot, *they have no idea you're there.*

That is an issue of the other driver being an idiot and not ""getting the big picture"" to know there was a car behind that then was no longer there nor performing a safe lane change.  I once heard of a police officer saying during driver's ed classes, ""cars don't have blind spots, people do.""  OP should have proactively avoided the situation by expecting the other driver to be an idiot and passed faster, but that doesn't change the fact the other driver is an idiot."
Yup.  Especially semi's.  GTF out of there.  No telling when one of those retreads is gonna fly apart.  
"LPT: If you set up your mirrors correctly, you have no blind spots.

https://youtu.be/QIkodlp8HMM?t=142"
"Generally yes, but OP was passing at a pretty good rate"
"As a bus driver I've been taught to ""make sure they see you"" - this means a quick toot on the horn when passing parked or potentially hazardous vehicles. It annoys some people but that's much better than a collision."
Thank u
Agreed . This guy probably has a line behind him 
"To piggyback, this is why motorcycles speed. You aren't in their bling spot longer than 1/2 a second. Many bikes could not have made this maneuver and they would have been hit. 

Lane position and speed are what keep you safe on the highway. 

Yes, this means going 10mph faster than cars, because the point is to get through all the traffic and into open road. "
"I agree, but with properly adjusted mirrors there shouldn't be a blind spot. If you can see the back of your car in your side mirror it is way too far in. "
The AP software really shouldn't creep in the blind spots like this at all. Would be such an easy fix for them. Somebody send a tweet to Elon!
"I'll hold off on passing a big truck until there is enough room ahead of me in my lane that I can get entirely past him quickly. I have no interest in sitting in anyone's blindspot, esp a big ass truck "
"That other car was already visibly making moves indicating that they were going to try to merge, inching closer to the center a couple times, finally before the actual merge attempt they took a good while to actually cross the lane divider. Driver awareness to accelerate and pass faster or slow down to let them merge would've avoided the entire exchange. Good for OP that they didn't get in an accident from their lack of attention, but all the signs were there to not need to be saved by the car in this case"
"That's the sad part. You're not supposed to have to speed up to pass someone. You can be given a ticket/ WARNING for doing that. A police officer told me that it's viewed just as badly as someone speeding up to beat a yellow light. 

But you kinda have to in some places, because people suck at driving. "
This video is proof that it's a bad idea to drive in/slowly pass someones blind spot. 
"My driving instructor told me I should try to pass within 5 seconds, so I'm not hanging out in their blindspot. "
"Yeah OP technically didnt do anything wrong, but this was shit driving."
"Definetly. Also a concentraded Driver should have seen that the Car in the right lane ist not slowing down while coming closer to the Car in front of it. That makes it likely that it hasn't seen you and ist going to overtake. While passing a Car should Look at the car in front of the Car you are going to pass. That's The number one rule for overpassing in Germany, where the overpassing Car ist often much faster. The Tesla should have seen that with it's Radar. Seems like there is still a Lot of work to do on the autopilot."
"I hate it too just in case the person I'm passing is an idiot.

But seriously. Who uses their mirrors when switching lanes? "
And to be honest this is exactly the kind of behavior I expect from people driving Tesla's
So your suggestion is to go 20 mph over instead of 5?
"*starts to change lanes* 

*checks blind spot 3/4 of the way through lane change* 

""Oh shit good thing I'm a good driver and checked my blind spot... dodged that bullet."" "
I wish I could actually shoulder check other cars somehow. Not checking over my shoulder but like slamming another person with your shoulder.
"‚ÄúGood luck everybody‚Äù

"
It‚Äôs pretty difficult when you‚Äôre morbidly obese which I assume the driver was. You ever see a fat person be able to move their head to look behind them without moving their whole upper body?
"Modern problems..
"
To me it just looks like they didn‚Äôt check their mirror before changing lane?
"First the ICErs came for our charging spots, now they're gunning for our lanes!"
"> Seems intentional... s/

Not really. Seems to me the Tesla was in the other drivers blind spot. I avoid this type of slow overtaking as much as possible."
"Nope, there are legitimately people on the road this stupid. Go to San Antonio, TX. Idiots do this all the time there. I have no clue what causes that town to have the most careless, oblivious and self-unaware drivers, but of all the 7 places I've lived in 6 different states, San Antonio takes the cake. In my first 6 months, I had more near-miss, almost accidents than I had in my previous 11 years of driving experience combined before then. Eventually after being there for 1.5 years, someone did this exact thing, but I couldn't correct for their stupidity to prevent the wreck and ran me off the road and the pathetic thing, I don't think they even realized what they did. It was a shitty, older white mustang, didn't stop, didn't slow down and I was forced into an exit and slammed into the concrete barrier, car went up on two wheels, but I righted it and ended up okay, but the cars tires and suspension were all sorts of fucked up. "
Not necessarily. I've drifted off due to closing my eyes (tired). But woke up in time to not crash due to sound the wheels made driving over the sideline. 
He was just testing Tesla's auto avoidance software.
"Not sure why you included the /s at the end like you‚Äôre joking. *Are* you joking? Because I came here looking for just such a comment. The other driver doesn‚Äôt appear to be trying to pass anyone (there isn‚Äôt anyone to pass), or avoid something that suddenly appeared in the road. It really looks like they‚Äôre being a dick, risking people‚Äôs lives just to make some dumbfuck point or express how they feel about Teslas. "
"Definitely motivated, and still guessing, testing autopilot response irrationally.  Jealous people. "
Single most dangerous component of a moving vehicle is the monkey behind the wheel.
"And as we know, AP has never caused an accident! /s"
The car already drives better than people 
"This is what a lot of people don't get. Sure it's not perfect, but I don't see autopilot texting and driving or not paying attention, so it's better than half the people out there anyways."
"For those like me who can't access this, you can read it here [https://outline.com/YtMxqn](https://outline.com/YtMxqn)"
I keep my mirrors angled so I can *barely* see the side of my car. It helps to know where the car ends when backing into a parking spot or parallel parking.
"Unfortunately, the model 3 mirrors aren't round or big enough to swing out far enough for this. That was my biggest concern about the car, 2nd to barely being able to see cars even in my rear view mirror. I used this method with my old camry but I'm so sad I can't use it now with the model 3.
 I've found that actually including a lot more of my car in the side mirrors helps me see cars behind me more easily, and now I just turn to check my blind spots. "
Content not available in my region. The fuck is this shit.
"Autopilot saved the car. Had there been an accident, the model 3 would have saved him."
True 
Thanks mom
"I don‚Äôt think that would‚Äôve been a lethal accident, unless the car did a 180 and got front ended by whoever was behind the Tesla"
Is this the exit right before the Casino? I thought this looked familiar. 
hey me too
I have an autopilot trial right now. It does not avoid blind spots to the point that it scares me 
I'm safer in a $300 Ford Ranger with no doors and busted windshield than this guy is with all his tech in a Tesla. Crazy ain't it? Tech can't fix stupid.
"i have my doubts on that, that person would have been 100% at fault if they got into an accident. you wanna bet that much $ on the tesla getting out of your way? i wouldn't."
Oh I did lay on the horn. I didn‚Äôt see the person coming into my lane because she was directly to the right and we were going ~65 mph so didn‚Äôt have a chance to disengage. 
"[Dashcam](https://www.tesla.com/support/software-v9?redirect=no#dashcam)  was introduced ~~for every Tesla~~ in Software Version 9.0 for Model S and Model X cars manufactured after August 2017, and all Model 3 cars."
"Only newer ones. It saves a rolling hour to a USB drive, or you can save the last 10 minutes permanently."
The guy was driving manual in the blind spot...the car then took over to avoid the collision.
"Don't know why I had to scroll so far down to read this, but yeah in the other post (can't find it) where the car seemed to catch itself after the spin in the snowstorm, everyone seemed to agree that it wasn't autopilot. It's one thing for the car to slam on the brakes and it's another to turn the steering wheel that fast and back."
"Must have been old, it's almost common to have crash override systems like this on luxury cars. Whether it's something simple like slamming the brakes for you or active driver assist, autonomous emergency systems are pretty widely accepted now. "
"Well, the bulk of the work done seems to be by the traction control, which is pretty much in every car sold today. Still, the reaction time to avoid the other car might be on the autopilot. The result of which needed traction control to keep under control."
"That guy didn't explain anything, he just guessed that it was only Autopilot doing the driving without any help from ESC/ESP.

Truth is no one knows what happens in edge cases like these two (there are 100s of thousands of Teslas on the road and yet we only have 2 reports of such behavior)."
I think people are just afraid of the future where you aren't able to drive your own car.
Aww damn. Could scored some major points there. 
"and we will be able to name our car computer/driver. People will yell to their ‚Äúchauffeur‚Äù by the name of  samantha, kevin, larry, susan...oh the possibilities. ‚ÄúIm in a hurry, Susan! STEP ON IT!!‚Äù"

HEAAAAAAAVY car
Its kinda funny how many ppl recognize that stretch of road. Yea it has a lot of distinctive land marks but considering How many ppl browes Reddit it's kinda cool.
It's alright bro I'm sure you've seen and driven on worse highways in our neighboring states.
most people don't even know this is a thing to be honest. 
"It's sad you get crucified for pointing this out but it's 100% true. The left most lane is for passing only, and if you aren't currently actively passing and the fastest person in that lane, you need to get out of it. For example, if the speed limit is 55, you speed up to 58 to pass someone and merge into the left hand lane knowing someone is coming up behind you doing 65 and you don't speed up to become the fastest person in that lane,  you are creating a more dangerous environment than the person doing 65 in the fast lane. If you aren't the fastest person in that lane, you need to get the fuck out of it. I'm glad my state is ticketing you fuckers now, I just hope one day they start taking your liscense. "
"It actually does when using Navigate on Autopilot.

A notification will pop up to move over to the right lane to get out of the passing lane.

https://electrek.co/2018/12/20/tesla-autopilot-navigate-passing-lane/


Edit to add URL of sample notification."
Haha
"AP goes the speed you tell it. If you camp it in the left lane and tell it to go 2mph faster than the right, that is what it will do.

Drivers still need to be aware and use it responsibly. Move into the left lane to pass. Speed up and execute the pass. Get the F back out of the left lane.
"
"It actually was passing the other car, you can tell if you look at the shadow in the beginning, the other driver just picked a terrible time to drive like an idiot"
In the passing lane too. First thing that I noticed. AP seems great but little shit like hanging out in blind spots means for now you should use in in conjunction with actually paying attention. Then again I see plenty of people hanging out in blind spots who are boring old organic pilots. 
"The tesla forward camera is very zoomed in compared to other dash cams, which makes it appear to be driving slower. If you look closely at the footage you can see he‚Äôs actually passing at a very reasonable speed"
"OP said it moved slightly to the side then braked. The car looks to have then lost traction due to the fast brake and the tail began to kick out, which the car self corrected, causing most of the ‚Äúswerving ‚Äú you see here. It‚Äôs a bit hard to tell because the camera is so zoomed in"
"I don't get why people keep bringing this up. He's clearly driving faster than the cars in the right lane, *passing them*. What's wrong here?"
Why would you say that?
Literally no one. You're the only person to have ever seen a Will Smith movie. 
"A human paying attention would have sooner. But yes, the Tesla did react when it‚Äôs driver allowed the collision to be imminent. "
Agree. Had a dumb bitch in a Escalade almost run me off the road this morning and for some reason it happened twice in Sunday. Same buddy in the car all 3 times and I joked he can't ride with me anymore. Sunday I was in my 350z and today in my Escape.
[deleted]
Oh my god no it didn‚Äôt. How do you know it almost spun itself out? We‚Äôre you there? Good you see the cars true movements? 
This entire sub is dedicated to the cars wtf. People would want to see this stuff and be reassured the cars AP has worked
It‚Äôs the built in dashcam feature they introduced a few months ago. 
is autopilot out yet on the model 3?
"You need to add ESP to your list. ESP = Electronic Stability Control.
"
"I'm not sure that you need the $5k EAP for this:

> Standard Autopilot Features:
> 
> **Automatic Emergency Braking**
> 
> Detects objects that the car may impact and applies the brakes accordingly
> 
> **Front Collision Warning**
> 
> Warns of impending collisions with slower moving or stationary cars
> 
> **Side Collision Warning**
> 
> Warns the driver of potential collisions with obstacles alongside the car

Doesn't say anything about steering, but why not make that part of the standard package since it's all about safety, and would lead to fewer customers needing backordered parts and loaners?"
Sounds like an excellent plan
I-95 in CT
"AP won't ever take control of the car if a human is driving it, except for emergency braking when you're going to rear end someone, and even then it won't do that if you're intentionally flooring the accelerator."
Needs to be an automatic function built in for sure.  Allows driver to use 2 middle fingers on idiots 
"Looks like it's the built in dashcam feature.  It has a narrow field of view compared to typical dashcam.  And the color is a bit washed out, probably because the system were designed for AP first."

"*In practice* Travel Lane and Passing Lane is growing obsolete, these days it is more like Fast Lane and Slow Lane.  The tendency to be under the speed limit on the right lane seems to be growing yet you rarely see the ticket going to the 50mph driver, who in my opinion causes a substantial number of accidents and just drives along oblivious. "
Are you blind? He was traveling faster than the cars in the right lane. AKA *passing them*. 
Interesting. I would have never put myself in that situation to begin with...
[deleted]
Your opinion != truth
It does not.
That was the driver taking over after autopilot initially avoided the side-swipe.
This ^
OP was clearly passing 
"Yeah, the system is designed so that when there's an imminent car crash, the Tesla shouts ""Jesus take the wheel!"" and immediately disengages."
"Wait, so you mean your problem with it is that it doesn‚Äôt break and honk? Really because this seemed like it was pretty"
Honking would have been way too late. That guy was committed.  And this was clearly not dangerous. The computer had full control. HUMANS would have over or under corrected. 
Probably trying to pass without checking blindspots first.
"It's impressive, but that's just not true.  Accidents like this are avoided every day.

It looks like the Autopilot over did it, a human shouldn't have lost control of a car at 65mph on dry pavement.

AP stops accidents because it is paying attention 100% of the time, unlike people."
The model 3 implemented a dashcam feature recently. 
It didn't hit the barrier sooooo.......??
But it didn't hit the barrier... 
But the car *didn't* hit the barrier. Maybe it was aware and swerved the right amount to avoid the collision with the other car *and* the wall.
"yes, crashing into a car is way better than a concrete barrier"
Very few people criticize the instances of AP working.  It‚Äôs when it *doesn‚Äôt* work as advertised that people get critical.  
"Likely because he was passing.  He posted a video of it, in fact."
"He was literally passing someone in this video. What else would you be doing in the passing lane? Either way, if someone is blocking the passing lane, it‚Äôs probably not advisable to force them into a wall at 70 mph. "
What an idiotic comment considering the video shows him actively passing cars.
I was using the passing lane to pass. Navigate on autopilot had actually directed me to do so. 
[deleted]
"Look more carefully, and remember that these ‚ÄúTeslaCam‚Äù videos are zoomed-in much more than other dashcam vids. This reduces the apparent forward motion. "
Turn that saltiness into determination and hustle for what you want in life. 
That is not cam drivers fault in any way. It‚Äôs the moron who wasn‚Äôt paying any attention and just just switched lanes without looking over his shoulder
If you‚Äôre passing someone you will inevitably be in their blind spot.  What you‚Äôre suggesting is we outlaw passing.  Fuck that noise.
"One day both cars will have driver assist systems and those will communicate wirelessly, plus beep for the drivers and honk at the other drivers. That's some redundancy that could prevent accidents."
Nothing stopping the attentive driver from honking when they see it about to happen/happening.
"Doubt it.

It will likely freak them out and cause then to over correct, causing an accident in the other lane or a solo accident.

You also run the risk of inducing road rage in the other driver, even if it is 100% their fault. "
Quick patent the invention of using a computer system to relay a signal from a motion sensor and prediction system to a speaker! Then y'all can sue! =(
Letting the AI decide who deserves the horn. What could possibly go wrong. 
These kind of drivers... Their instructors should be given fines every time it happens.
"They may or may not be an idiot.  But I think the world would be a little better if we all saw people who make a mistake as human beings who made a mistake first, then reserve judgment on whether they are idiots after more information is gathered.  But I might be wrong.  I often times am."
"*And* the horn would begin way faster than any human could hit the button. Which would in turn scare the driver into submission more, unlike when you hit the horn three seconds *after* a dangerous situation happens because of slow reason time."
"Possibly. But people can react in strange ways when a horn rips through their brain. Depending on the situation, it could cause more problems as the driver panics or is surprised and oversteers, jam the brakes, etc.

If the Tesla can solve the problem without altering the situation with the horn, it should probably do that. People are unpredictable, physics - not so much.

Plus, then you also get the satisfaction of being the one to lean on the fucking horn when you're safe from the asshat ;)"
I‚Äôve had this happen several times where I brake and lay on my horn. A lot of those times the other driver continues to move into my lane without hesitation. I can‚Äôt tell if they don‚Äôt care or they‚Äôre oblivious. Some people really just don‚Äôt react to honking horns. Apparently it‚Äôs just too much work to check your mirror. Or turn your head. Or get into the lane you need to be in sooner rather than later. 
"AP needs to be perfect before this can happen. 

When driving on a curved road, the car often does the super loud emergency collision sound with traffic going the other direction. 

Also smashing the horn in those instances would be a step backward. "
"As my brother is fully aware of, a horn honk can cause the person to slam on their brakes out of instinct. Bad things happen. "
You are experiencing an accident! -I Robot.
"I suggest the opposite, because you need to keep control of the car. In a situation like this, i feel like that is a huge risk going one handed just to honk as someone. The horn should be reserved for stuff you can see prior to jerking the car to get out of the way."
"Honking and (ironically) signalling are dangerous behaviors because they may cause the other driver to perform an unanticipated action.  In this case if the Telsa honked, No Check Norbert may have slammed on the brakes.  The Telsa would still avoid the initial accident (look at how quickly it creates separation when it wants to) but it could lead to both cars being nearly stopped on a fast moving roadway."
"Not driving along in someone‚Äôs blind spot would help, too."
"The whole thing happened pretty quick anyways... i don‚Äôt seriously think honking would have made any difference. 

Personally I think a lot of accidents could be prevented if idiots put more priority on effective defensive driving than being concerned whatsoever on honking. Ive never been in one single accident as a driver and I never honk. When shit hits the fan I‚Äôm just way more focused on my driving. 

Besides honking can even just be distracting. Haven‚Äôt you ever been in a situation where a person was about to drop something or walk into something... and you said ‚Äúwatch out!‚Äù And it caused them to look all around all confused and then the thing happened anyways...? if you didn‚Äôt say watch out, they might have actually been slightly more focused and recovered better. 

In other words honking is for people with road rage, people who don‚Äôt know how to drive, and overpopulated third world countries. 
"
"I personally find honking very bad as it might introduce a wrong or an exagerated reaction due to the driver getting startled. While in comparison a litle scratch wouldn¬¥t have hurt or the driver already notices his mistake and was about to evade anyways. I think the its not worth it and it causes much more damage then it helps. I am also a bicycle driver who rings when wanting to pass pedestrians. And the ammount of ppl getting shocked by the ringing and jumping in random directions (even tho I am already ringing at a safe distance) is just too high. I would assume 1 in 3 is just jumping randomly into the bike lane while another is turning around INTO the bike lane to check whats happening while one 1 of 3 is getting stepping cleanly to the correct side without needing too much time. I would assume this also beeing the case in car drivers, maybe even worse if given the volume of most honkings."
"Same exact thing happened to me a few years ago where I was passing someone on the right on a moderately congested 5 lane interstate.  Guy comes over into my lane when my front bumper was even with the middle of his car and I laid on the horn and had to drift over into the next lane over while hitting my breaks hard.  There was an 18-wheeler in that lane though and I was about even with the front of the cab.  I bumped the 18-wheeler and caused him to drift into the next lane over slightly.  I am really lucky nothing worse than that happened because if he had come over harder, or if I had reacted slower, there could have been a 20 car pileup as we were driving 75 miles an hour.  The guy I was trying to pass only realized I was there after all this happened and he sped off and weaved in and out of traffic to get away... Like, what am I going to do, get out of my car and yell at you?  ""Better do more unsafe stuff since the accident I just tried to cause didn't actually happen.""  I don't think he ever heard my horn, maybe his music was too loud, maybe he had headphones in, whatever the case was, he was clearly not paying attention.

&#x200B;

PSA: People, please pay attention when operating your personal two ton death machine."
It doesn't honk? That should be an immediate response. 
That might make him freak out and actually cause an accident 
Or ya know pay attention

It only has to be safer than a human to succeed.  
">we can consider it as a safe tech, but not completely safe as nothing is 100% safe

This isn't a meaningful statement. Nobody is claiming anything is 100% safe. The question is whether it's safe enough to use. And the bar is pretty low since people in general are terrible drivers and won't have the millisecond reaction time and precision a computer can have."
"Ah, yeah. I forget all the time. Having tea with my grandmother isn't safe. Knitting isn't safe. Typing on my keyboard isn't safe.

Or maybe, when people say ""safe"", they implicitly mean either ""safer than the alternatives"" or ""relatively safe"" and not ""100% safe"". As it stands, having AP enabled reduces your chances of an accident by about 7x.

You're supposed to keep your hands on the wheel anyway with AP, so unless AP is somehow causing more crashes than it's saving you from, it's ""safe""."

"It is here where I live in the US. I used to be in the habit of doing it, but I spent a couple years driving a truck with a service body where you couldn't do a head check. I now routinely am in the habit of looking in the side view, and then looking in the blind spot mirror."
Who the fuck doesn't do that? That a recipe for fucking disaster.
To be fair you shouldnt assume that a human is always going to perfectly follow a procedure. Putting yourself in a vulnerable position on the assumption that everyone around you wont mess up is how you get yourself killed.
My policy is to stay safe given the idiots around me. I find no pleasure in noting that I'm about to die because that guy there is an idiot.
Doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs at fault if you‚Äôre dead. I always keep the mentality that the cars around me are driven by murderous morons. 
My SO‚Äôs driving instructor‚Äôs first bit of advice was to treat every car on the road as if it‚Äôs trying to kill you.
"I don't know how it's in the US, but in Norway we are thought to both check mirrors and blind spot, as well as using blinkers before shifting lanes. If you fail this, you won't get a license.  
This obviously doesn't eliminate the problem, but I do notice a big difference from Norway to Denmark for instance. "
"I agree that it's largely the fault of rhe other driver, but many countries make it illegal to drive in the overtaking lane while not going to specifically pass someone in order to avoid stuff like this. One thing AP isn't able to do yet is assume everyone else on the road is an idiot and about to kill you at any second.

I wonder if in a few years cars like Teslas or those using a similar system will use a network to do all the processing for these systems offsite from the vehicle. Add in far more processing power than is currently feasible to cram into the vehicle itself. "
[deleted]
Allways assume idiots are trying to kill you.  That's my motto. Edit: Sanitized for your protection.
"I have a 2011 Elantra with a huge blind spot towards my back fenders.  

I don't care how much you look around and pay attention, if someone is driving on your fender for miles at a time it can be hard to tell if they got off an exit of if they are still there.  

I cant look at them and watch them the entire time I'm driving, and cant always tell if they are still there because of it.  Granted I tend to play it more safe than sorry but still, there is no reason someone needs to ride in the blind spot of another car.  

Either pass and get it over with or hang back far enough that I can see you.  

It this is the rule of thumb for driving next to semis and should also be the rule of thumb when passing or driving next to other cars.

Agree 100%. Car and Driver has a [good article](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15131074/how-to-adjust-your-mirrors-to-avoid-blind-spots/) on this.

"owner of a 2011 Elantra here... no matter how I position my mirrors I have a large blind spot on my back fenders because the columns between the back windows and rear windows is so wide.

Don't tell /r/cars. [You'll be called an unsafe driver](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/4anvyx/lpt_angle_your_side_mirrors_to_make_a_continuous/) for not wanting to take your eyes off the road in front of you for 2 seconds to do a shoulder check.
I got my mirrors set up this way and it's almost satisfying to see a car go from my rearview to my side mirror to my direct line of sight. Luckily my car's rear window is huge.
Thanks for this!
How are you supposed to be able to park in tight spaces if your mirrors are adjusted like that.. ? Fuck around with mirrors each time when you are parking?
"I always get weird looks from ppl when I do this. Used to drive forklifts in busy warehouses, you would honk before every corner you took basically. Force of habit now when I'm turning into a blind corner or something"

Some cars' mirrors have stronger curving near the outer edge, that helps."

This. I got run off the road in my small town the other day cause someone didn‚Äôt bother to look in their mirror before changing lanes. People are just dumb/forget a step sometimes.

"On Reddit, the ‚Äús/‚Äú at the end of a comment denotes sarcasm. I was making a joke about how the gif almost loops perfectly and it looked like the Toyota kept trying to run the Tesla off the road."
It's a 9 second clip being watched for a few minutes....on loop....thus the joke about repeated attempts
"The fact that he moved back over leads me to disagree.

Some people just change lanes for zero reason. I don't get it either, but that makes a lot more sense than them intentionally trying to destroy their own car in what would be an at-fault accident."

You get more benefit from having them show you your blind spot than the side of your car. You know your car is a few inches inside your mirror already lol

"I can see that. He‚Äôs still lazing about. I see this same thing happen on my commute about once a week to people driving in the left lane while barely inching past the right. 

Both drivers are disconnected and not anticipating the actions of others. One would be legally at fault for it, and the other is subsidizing the behavior with impressive tech.

"In the video the car clearly loses traction, which is why it had to correct through multiple fishtails.

My judgement: 25/75 blame."
All he/she was doing was overtaking whilst driving in the overtaking lane. What would you do different?
I don't. My point is that the driver of the Tesla should have intervened. This kind of scenario is common on highways. Paying attention to the road and those around you will help you avoid from needing drastic corrective action that could upset the balance of the car like AP did here. If you were being attentive you could see the car coming over on you and hit the brakes to let them complete the maneuver or get out of the way. There was 0 reason the car needed to start kicking out in this situation.
You don't think a human driver could have avoided this situation without kicking the ass end around? lol.
"Would be cool if it did though.  ‚ÄúHey asshole, even my car thinks you‚Äôre a dick!‚Äù  "

"I agree with you here on this case.  I HAVE had, though, it see one car ahead that I legitimately could not (who stopped hard on the highway).  AP hit the brakes before the car in front of me did.  Saved me there from a few possible alternate scenarios."
"Well yeah, if you hit the barrier its your fault plus why hit it at all, as I said the car should have been aware of the barrier and just quickly close the difference to the barrier. In the video it looks like it swerved away from the barrier the same way it swerved away from the car."
Not really my point but sure 
"> Likely because he was passing. 

Yeah, but are you sure?  I mean, what proof do we have of that fact?"
"> Navigate on autopilot had actually directed me to do so. 

While I agree it's clear you were actively passing, saying the software told you to is never a good argument."
It's just the stupidity of the donald leaking. 
Can't wait till we can outsource road rage to computers.
Yeah but BMW computers will be assholes. 
If both cars were autonomous you wouldn't even need them to communicate to avoid this accident. 
both cars will coordinate in a machine learning algorithm that will judge which driver was the asshole and the car will slap his face with a robotic arm and tell him he is a bitch
In my vision of the future self-driving cars will communicate that brights are on to human drivers behind them by angling their mirrors to shine the brights directly back into the driver's eyes until they turn the brights off.
"Planes do this. Each continuously protects the path ahead of it and if another aircraft is trespassing on the projected ‚Äúspace bubble‚Äù of the others path, they warn the pilots.

If the ‚Äúspace bubbles‚Äù continue to converge, the two plane‚Äôs systems will communicate with each other, commanding one set of pilots to climb and the other set to descend, based off of which would result in the least drastic avoidance maneuver. Some of these warnings are inhibited in certain phases for added safety.

This is of course just one of several ‚Äúlayers of safety‚Äù in the collision avoidance sector. "
No... One day both cars will have an AP that transforms the cars into giant robots and they will fight to death to see who is right and who is wrong.
"Transponders - TCAS to be more specific. It‚Äôs a safety standard in commercial aviation, I mean it costs between $80,000 and $200,000 but I‚Äôm sure there will be a cheaper alternative at some point..."

I have a pet peeve about this. 

Audio \*is wireless\*. So is visual communication. They're also fairly easy to triangulate and relatively difficult to spoof and are useful things for vehicles to leverage w/or without other techniques. Especially when a significant portion of the drivers out there will still be humans. 

In contrast most wifi/bluetooth/vehicle-2-vehicle methods being discussed will require substantial and complex security infrastructures. And then won't be able to help human drivers. 

I vote for robots that honk horns and use turn signals. "
Insurance companies hate this.
"If only Tesla owned the market completely so all cars just ran on their own network, then we wouldn‚Äôt even have to drive, we wouldn‚Äôt need to switch lanes because everyone would be going the same speed in AP.

"The problem is that people have used the horn as a substitute for ""fuck you, you suck"" for so long that now it's less effective as a way to communicate a common danger.

I think it works in slower traffic when people aren't driving at 70-80 MPH. On a highway, the safest resolution to the problem is to get out of the way. Morally that's not very satisfying (""They suck and they don't know it! I NEED THEM TO KNOW MY HATE AND THEIR INADEQUACY!!!"") but in terms of safety it's much better.

Also they will never know how much they suck, blame themselves for your hate, or themselves for their inadequacy, so there is no point in using a horn as a tool for moral or road safety education."
"It actually makes some sense not to. If you want to build an adaptable model that can handle all situations it encounters as well as possible, what you really want is for the other driver to behave in as predictable a manner as possible. If a driver shifts lanes in a smooth, predictable manner, but will impact another car doing so, that's a simple case to manage. However, honking the horn can cause harder to predict behavior. Maybe he swerves back into his lane and clips the guy who sped up to take his place. Maybe he still doesn't see you and hits the brakes. Maybe he over commits to the lane shift and veers harder towards you. The car would need to recognize, process, and adapt to all possible outcomes on the fly, in a split second or else there's a crash. I think the ideal case is that autopilot does as little as possible to influence the other drivers on the road so that it can handle the simplest test cases. "
A horn is usually used to honk a someone that just made a mistake. Because in the heat of the moment there is no time to honk.

"AP isn't actively avoiding the car again. When AP did the aggressive shift it looks like it put on the brakes as well. This caused the car to break traction and kick the rear out to the right. Then the ESP kicked in to correct which resulted in the car snapping the other way. ESP continued to do it's thing while it snapped back the other way. 

The ESP was making corrective actions to keep the car straight, but it missing the car was complete coincidence and good fortune."

If AP is responsible for jerking the car across the lane near the barrier than AP made a horrible decision.  That is never the appropriate reaction to this situation: the car should have stayed in the lane and simultaneously honked and slowed down.

AP doesn't calculate tire tread and ambient temperatures (grip), road surface conditions - any of which could have made this car spin-out and resulted in a fatality.  When, alternatively, if it just stayed in the lane and slowed down the very WORST thing that could have happened was a slight bump with the other car.

&#x200B;"
It is important to realize that I believe it only avoided the car because it had space on the left
It did give an audible warning but the car swerved. I don‚Äôt think I would have had the reaction time to avoid the barrier and also avoid the car on the way back in. 
"As I understand it, this is just the ""comfortable distance to vehicles in adjacent lanes"" algorithm acting faster. To me it looks like OP took over before the car moves back to center, and it seems there might have been a brief loss of traction."
In situations like this it's common enough that people's memories become foggy. Throw a robot driver in the mix and it makes sense that they suddenly don't know who did what.
"I'm gonna tell you about the day I came within about ten mph of dying. I was riding my bike, a lady turned without signaling, and I hit her dead on doing at least 25 down a hill. I dont remember swerving, or braking, I dont remember *anything.* Not one thing from spotting the car to limping around in a circle. In a high fear, high adrenaline state, you will not remember specific actions. Driving a vehicle at any speed *should be that kind of circumstance or you are not being safe.*

If it was no autopilot or dash cam at all, but they avoided it, they wouldn't have remembered specific actions. So, what is claimed by OP is not only believable, but highly probable.

As for hating on Tesla's owner/ceo/whatever he is now, OP didnt credit him with jack. He credited the software that is shown to be damn close to saving his car at the very least. And it did a pretty good job of it too."

Dash cam footage makes for some great viral marketing. Simply asking people to share it to them over social media is way cheaper and more convincing than an actual ad campaign. 
I'm not sure if their software is set up to upload full-resolution dumps of sensor data from every perceived incident.  I assumed Tesla wanted to know about human verified ones so they could grab the data for further autopilot training data.
i think all the autopilot users with beta is already agreed with the terms&conditions that tesla will collect the data. i didn't read the agreement but i believe that users opt in and send data to tesla in order to use the autopilot
What about that is scary? In the most insane scenario possible what could they possibly do with that data?

"That is the ""legal"" way of doing it here, too, but no one cares enough to do it because they think they're the most important person on the road.

One thing that stood out while driving in Japan... Drivers are polite. Explains why they have trouble driving here in US.
Sadly driver's education training was cut from the school curriculum a few decades ago and about the only thing it requires now to get a driver's license is a pulse.
"Unfortunately in the US, if you turn on a blinker to change lanes, cars behind you in the other lane will floor it to block you, because how dare you be in front of them..."
"Most American drivers never take any drivers training,  they just retake the exam until they pass."
But OP was in the left lane because he was passing the cars on the right.  The dashcam has a very narrow field of view which will distort speed.
I wouldn't take it quite *that* far.

"This mirror setting is way better for driving. I learned about it a couple of years ago and it is great. Cars leaving the center mirror immediately appear in one of the side mirrors.

When you‚Äôre parking in a tight spot, just lean your body left or right to see closer to the car in the mirror. Or move the mirror if you need to see better, but put it back in position for driving.

"I've only had my car for a little over a month now but been an avid Tesla fan for much longer and I definitely agree with you.

"Not sure if you're talking about [Navigate on Autopilot](https://www.tesla.com/support/software-v9?redirect=no#navigate_autopilot) or just using the map on the dashboard display...

Navigate on Autopilot isn't the greatest for me here in Miami due to all the road construction on my typical routes (it disables in heavy construction areas). Also the more aggressive driving style here is pretty challenging for my Model 3 to make it to the on/off ramps. On nice empty roads at nights it's great!

As for using the maps on the dashboard display, it's pretty good. I've compared it to Google maps on my phone and it routes the exact same except on longer trips which my Model 3 will factor in some Supercharger stops automatically. Searching is quick and it allows you to predefine your home and work address. No complaints at all. Never had the opportunity to use Android Auto btw."
"No, you‚Äôre right"

"I agree and I‚Äôve been trying to think of a tactful way to say this. The car to the right had their wheels well into the left lane before the Tesla took action. A defensive driver in the left lane paying attention would have reacted before then.

I watched a Tesla video of a number of instances where a Tesla avoided an accident on its own. 90 percent of those were situations that wouldn‚Äôt have happened if the ugly bag of mostly water had been paying attention.

I love technology and encourage anti-crash systems, but I see AP turning drivers into passive passengers. I‚Äôd like to see a camera on the driver whenever AP is active. I think it‚Äôs reckless to market a technology that allows/encourages the driver to pay less attention.

To me these videos can be summarized as ‚ÄúI was doing something else and the car avoided an accident.‚Äù That‚Äôs just a recovery from a failure behind the wheel. "
Yes. This is the third time I‚Äôve said this and will say it no more. In this situation where should the Tesla driver‚Äôs attention be focused? The answer is the nearest threat (the car three feet to the right). A defensive driver is prepared for other drivers‚Äô stupid.  The Tesla driver should have been on the horn and brakes before the other car crossed the line. No human effort was made if the Tesla took over to avoid the crash and I‚Äôm not sure we should celebrate that. 
"Ohh, well you sell people the replacement parts for more than they cost to make.  Servicing the cars is profitable - you charge people more than it costs to pay the mechanics.

"Well, when practicable, we are spoiled in Maine. Try I-95 from New Haven to Newark or the Atlanta Beltway; any beltway for that matter, here we have light traffic on the busiest of days. the Interstate system in the rest of the country is overloaded and the *best* place to have an accident is in that right lane, but keep on doing what your doing."
"If you don't check your blindspot, that's 100% on you."
">Let's get real, this dude creeped into and **stayed** in the other driver's blind spot



We see literally 4 seconds of the video before the car on the right tries to merge without checking their blind spot. You're making an awful lot of assumptions based on a 4 second video. 

He ""creeped into and stayed"" for a grand total of, what, less than a second?

And in those 4 seconds, car with dashcam was very fucking clearly moving faster than the other cars. "
"Speed up. Overtake with purpose. Check my own blindspot. Return to travel lane. It's worked for the last 25 years for me, never even almost been in a situation like this so it seems to do the trick. "
"Interesting deduction on your part here. Some humans would have crashed and some would have managed it better, some worse. The question to ask is how the average driver would have reacted, better, similar or worse. It's speculative in any case and I wouldn't call that truth. That's my point and nothing else. Your point was to shit on AP, hence your whiny edit."
It leaves the pleasure of that to you
if you watch the shadow of the other car you can see that OP was passing by at a decent speed. 
What‚Äôs your point then? 
Autonomous cars ---> BattleBots
Honking to avoid an accident isn't road rage. Both drivers being aware of an impending collision helps both drivers avoid it.

"I've seen people freak the fuck out from hearing a horn before. The first thing they do when they hear a horn is take their eyes off the road/what they're doing and look around for the source.

It's the reason why I don't honk when someone is in the act of hitting my fucking truck as I'm driving. I do what I have to do to avoid being hit first, then lay on that horn for a good 3-4 seconds to let them know how close they were to a huge insurance rate hike.

I remember seeing an old lady who thought she had right-of-way lay on the horn as she continued to drive right into the person who did actually have right-of-way. In her mind, the horn was going to prevent the accident, not her own intervention. Focus on saving the situation before expressing the rage."
"The horn is to alert them of a dangerous situation, yes. However, in highway driving it's much better to be hyper aware of others and to drive defensively. The horn is a last resort, while moving out of the way is your safest bet. In slower traffic, people have time to react more reasonably.

If the horn adequately made people question their current, past and future life decisions I would use it all the time. Sadly, that's not what happens. Instead people just freak out and continue to blame others and be stupid. "
I mean most accidents can be avoided. But humans are idiots
"That would work, too."
"Take this OP as an example. The car is blocked in by a barricade on the left side, so there's not much room to evade laterally and the main option is to brake. Obviously, the autopilot did it's job. If a human had been driving, there's no reason *not* to honk immediately as you brake to at least attempt to notify the other driver to change course, because it may turn out that the braking isn't enough to avert a collision.

I really can't fathom why I'm having to elaborate on how and why horns exist. They work. Use them in emergency situations. They don't cause mass casualties. "

Would all systems not be working in concert to avoid the other car and maintain control at the same time?
AP does not do aggressive steering inputs.  It does brake hard though. 
"Yea, I wonder what the outcome would have been if this was in inclement weather, snow or rain could have made this a lot worse. "
To me it honestly looked way more dangerous than an attentive driver keeping an eye on the teaffic in the lane over and anticipating a dumbass lane shift and tapping on the brakes.
"Jesus fuck, is driving that fucking hard though?

It's a straight fucking road, its dry, clear, day time. How the fuck can you fuck that up."
"Just want to point out a couple of things. I don‚Äôt think op or ap braked. Even in a stiff Tesla. The front suspension would compress making the camera point more downwards. I can‚Äôt see that perceptively. Also ESP uses braking independently to stabilize a car. What happened there was far to excessive for esp to recover without high steering input in my opinion.   
Initial swerve to the left seemed fine and not too badly upset the cars traction. The hard swerve right while on the dirty part of the road to avoid the wall is where the car broke traction.      

Either way, I‚Äôm really impressed!"
"Was gonna say, I remember Tesla making a statement that AP isn't allowed to make super aggressive wheel motions, and I felt this qualified. Good to know ESC can bring a car back to stability this well."
"It seems to me like this is *only* partially true. If you pay attention to the first correction to the right, it seems like the car slowed its shifting to the right as it got closer to the other car, and made final correction once the car was away. 

It could also be the driver correcting the correction made by the ESP"
"Disagree. The car‚Äôs ultrasonic sensors determined the car to the right was getting too close, moved the car over to the left in a controlled manner to avoid impact, and AP abruptly prompted the driver to take over. Driver thinks autopilot is steering it into the divider so driver takes ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù and way overcorrects to the right. 

The car has electronic brake force distribution and it would take much more (a massive amount) of overcorrection to get the car into a 4 wheel brake slide and activate ESP. "
This is important. The video makes it look like the car is insanely skilled. But in reality its dumb luck. Robots can never replace humans
"> Then the ESP kicked in to correct which resulted in the car snapping the other way. ESP continued to do it's thing while it snapped back the other way.

Did you maybe think that AutoPilot knew exactly how the car was going to behave after monitoring its speed, quality of the tire traction, the weight shift, and the tail kick, and used all of its precise control of the car to avoid the other car WHILE keeping it straight?  

HMM?"
Man. This guy thinks he knows best. 
"Amazing stuff. Glad that you‚Äôre ok and this ended well. 

So great to see how Tesla‚Äôs technology is actually saving people. Too bad this stuff never goes viral!"
I hope that was a brown pants day. 
It was just luck it didn't hit the car during the corrective action by ESP. Sliding scrubs off a lot of speed. ESP was just trying to correct the yaw of your car.
Was any break force automatically applied by AP? Or it just swerved?    Not a single contact? Scratches?
"Lets assume the roads were slippery... say during the winter.  I don't think AP actually behaved properly in this case...  those were pretty violent avoiding turns the Tesla did, when it could have easily just slightly moved over.  It recovered well, but it did so on dry pavement; try that again on wet, or icy pavement."

If anything, AP basically did jack all, and the Bosch ESP was the one that did most of the work FROM autopilot screwing up. AND it is pure and utter dumb luck that the ESP corrective action didn‚Äôt cause him to hit the driver entering his lane, as ESP only cares about getting your car going to the direction intended when there is a loss of traction.

This is the single worst video that Tesla could use for viral marketing as it actually shows a deficiency in their product.

I'm not sure which video you're referring to. The video I watched was 9 seconds long.

From that amount of footage it is quite clear the camera driver slowly enters the blind spot zone and stays there for around 3 seconds. In my experience, that is 2 seconds too long.

"Would some crash? Maybe. Then again you play this scenario with AP enough and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll crash a few times too, especially if there are different traffic patterns. That‚Äôs all beside the point though. 

This scenario plays out a shit load every day on today‚Äôs highways. It happened to me twice last week. Both instances were nowhere near this dramatic. I simply slowed down and let them in. This wasn‚Äôt a particularly abrupt merge into the lane, it didn‚Äôt need to play out with this much drama. 

AP is neat, but it is NOT FSD. You should be able to respond and take over, as someone should have in this instance. Letting AP handle it was irresponsible, period. He/she got extremely lucky. "

"Exactly. That's the whole point of having a horn - to tell others when they're being oblivious that you are *there*. 

Honking to tell someone that they just did something stupid and dangerous is closer to road-rage though. "
No but it triggers road rage instantly. That's a phenomenon I find strange in America. Here if you honk it's the equivalent of giving the middle finger. I was in India and the drivers there use horns as a form of communication. There is an entire system of different honk patterns that indicate what you plan to do.

"> OP just got really lucky here

He didn't get lucky. Technology saved him.

AP did its work of avoiding the other car and ESP did the work of correcting direction. This had nothing to do with luck.

It's like you are saying ""Boy OP sure is lucky a plane didn't crash on his car"""
[removed]
Esp overrides ap. Having the car fishtail is not intended by autopilot and it really doesn't know what to do when you are swerving since it assumes the front of your car is the direction you are going at all times. 
"AP is designed to not provide large corrective inputs, so no. Once the car started kicking out, it was limited in what it would do. Frankly I'm surprised if AP remained activated. I know that when we were on autopilot once and a semi came over slowly AP started moving over, then it played the ""peace I'm out"" alert and we had to take over. "
"I‚Äôm no expert, but even if say all autopilot features are working, and working exactly how intended, road conditions can still fuck it up. It‚Äôs like watching an F1 race, the car, driver, and weather is all fine, but a bit of gravel around a corner sends a multimillion $$ car into the wall. I‚Äôm generalizing but I think I understood and answered your question. "
"Right, this is the ESP. It would provide correct actions through brake inputs at each wheel."
"Worse than if the driver hadn‚Äôt noticed at all and got bounced off the barrier or took action and it went the way most panicked reactions go, which would be ‚Äúpoorly‚Äù? Bad conditions are bad conditions"
"So many variables it'd be hard to say. The less friction available the less ESP has to work with to keep the car straight, so there's that. If this happened at a faster speed it's also a possibility the car could have come all the way around. It looks like that was a 50mph zone, so that's a good thing. "
"I definitely agree. I don't really like how autopilot handled this situation. Applying the brakes at highway speed with steering input is a recipe for disaster. This driver got very lucky it was at lower speed, at higher speed it would have been very possible the car would have gone all the way around. 

Personally it would have made more sense to apply the brakes and just let the idiot come over. Autopilot should be able to honk the horn in situations like this as well. Then again, it's autopilot not FSD, and the meat puppet behind the wheel could\should have honked the horn and intervened before autopilot went and did it's thing."
"Being in a hurry + not paying attention to your surroundings is a bad combo. Even worse, in a lot of these situations, the driver in the left lane will lose control and wreck while trying to avoid the idiot changing lanes without looking, and the idiot will go on driving as if nothing happened."
"Yeah it's hard. What, a million ppl die in autos each year? Not hard all the time, but it's still pretty dangerous. The longer you drive, the more fatigued you become, so things like AP are worth it to a lot of us, and tech companies are pouring billions into this technology to make roads safer."
">Just want to point out a couple of things. I don‚Äôt think op or ap braked. Even in a stiff Tesla. The front suspension would compress making the camera point more downwards.

Traction was definitely upset on the initial turn. I don't think there was a lot of braking, but it only takes a little while at speed and applying some level of steering to upset the car. It doesn't require slamming on the brakes.

>I can‚Äôt see that perceptively. Also ESP uses braking independently to stabilize a car.

Right

>What happened there was far to excessive for esp to recover without high steering input in my opinion.

Not at all. ESP can absolutely correct this.

>Initial swerve to the left seemed fine and not too badly upset the cars traction. The hard swerve right while on the dirty part of the road to avoid the wall is where the car broke traction.

The initial swerve started it, then started snap oversteer and counter-correction by ESP.

>Either way, I‚Äôm really impressed!

I'm glad it didn't go into a wall, but this is an example why you shouldn't trust AP. A normal driver would not have needed to rely on ESP, this was completely avoidable."
"I can tell you right now a car isn't going to stop yaw correction because it detects a car near it. It's going to do everything it can to get the cars rotation stopped and it pointed straight. This looks like classic ESP correcting oversteer. AP didn't do anything to avoid the car. The slide scrubbed off speed which is why it went behind the ""merging"" car. "
">Disagree. The car‚Äôs ultrasonic sensors determined the car to the right was getting too close, moved the car over to the left in a controlled manner to avoid impact, and AP abruptly prompted the driver to take over. Driver thinks autopilot is steering it into the divider so driver takes ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù and way overcorrects to the right.

It definitely appears to me the car broke traction going to the left. We'll never know if it was AP who did it, or whether it was a panicked sloppy grab at the controls by the driver. My main point was not that that was exactly how it panned out, but that AP was not actively avoiding the car while it was siding around, that was pure luck. Regardless, the driver should have taken control way earlier.

>The car has electronic brake force distribution and it would take much more (a massive amount) of overcorrection to get the car into a 4 wheel brake slide and activate ESP.

Yeah, that's called ESP. You don't have to have 4 wheels sliding for ESP to kick in. The computer only has to register yaw and lateral acceleration beyond limits for it to kick in. It certainly would in this situation. This is part of the reason why you can't slide a RWD model 3 around a parking lot without a defeat device. It's not just TC, it's ESP. In that scenario your front wheels still have traction."
I wouldn't say never. We're just giving too much credit to AP in this situation. If AP was as smart as people think it is it wouldn't have gotten into this situation to begin with. 
No. If AP was this smart it wouldn't have gotten into this situation to begin with.
"And he knows pretty damn well. That was a shitty way to react and while it did avoid the accident out of luck, it could‚Äôve caused the car to oversteer too aggressively right into the wall, or off the road of the car didn‚Äôt catch the snap oversteer. Getting on the brakes+horn would‚Äôve been much better and safer."
It‚Äôs amazing how great this technology is. I can imagine a future where no will have to drive and the roads will be safer. 
Too bad? Fred writes an article about EVERY video!

Aren't you not supposed to use AutoPilot in those conditions anyway?
"Let me clarify. If in a near accident, you dont have that fear response, you aren't taking the situation seriously. Your in a 2 ton vehicle made of hard, heavy metal and glass going at least two times faster than the fastest man alive (usain bolt runs 27 mph, most highways are 60). Take it seriously. It's a brush up with death every time you have to swerve or lay on the horn."
"Hey man, gonna let you in on a little secret. 

You're being a fucking douche."
Wow. Such human. Great memory.
"It's called a ""left lane violation"" where, on a 2 lane road, someone isn't actively passing in the left lane (with urgency or making an effort to overtake), usually isn't enforced unless it impedes traffic.

Out here in Connecticut we have one but it's not enforced much.  PA, for example, actively tickets people that do it.

You're supposed to stay right unless passing, as it was explained to me by the police when I got a ticket for it years ago.

On a 3 lane road, if someone clogs the fast lane, you are allowed to pass on the right to go around them, even the far right.

On a 2 lane road, you aren't supposed to pass on the right at all, hence the left lane violation.

"This is really reaching lmao. The autopilot is responsible for all the steering. It cuts to the left to avoid the car, cuts to the right to avoid the divider, slows down to let the merging car get in front. 

stability control just helps the autopilot (or driver) keep from overyawing past a certain angular offset from the forward velocity. 

This is two systems working together exactly as anticipated. At some level, swerving is required to avoid a collision. And at some level, swerving will always cause oversteer depending on the dynamic traction. 

I bet you ESC didn‚Äôt kick in until after the second swerve when the oversteer is actually significant enough to warrant it. "
"If anything it's the traction control that didn't do anything. Traction control has nothing to do with steering. It only cuts power to the throttle when it detects wheel slip. It doesn't steer for you, that's autopilot doing that. "
And the day shit like that starts to happen things will collapse very quickly. There's a limit for a population and doing that kind of shit will be it for ours. Selling our data has no immediate physical impact. Using it to do shit like that is orders of magnitude more extreme than what we have now.

It's not that I wouldn't like for the horn to be useful in that situation. It is that it would not work. I would honk, have slightly less control of my own car while doing so, and their brain would process the following information:

""Oh, someone hates me. Too bad they're wrong, because I'm always right. Maybe I'll try to road rage against them later for not letting me over.""

It would not process ""oh no, there's danger, better check the road!"" That is the problem of having used the horn for a personal stress relief valve and escalation mechanism for so long. Now people only process it as a personal attack. At least in Seattle. I've seen people turn to glare at me while I honked because they were speeding through a four way stop at a pedestrian.

"It does look like based on the camera footage, and from my experience with our own footage that the Tesla was probably in his blindspot.

We have intervened manually every time except for once when wanted to see what would happen. Ours didn't get this dramatic, it just gave us the ""autopilot is off, prepare to die"" alarm and we intervened. "

That goes for regular cruise control as well, but we have seen many people violate the AutoPilot ""hands on wheel"" and ""full attention at all times"" conditions already.

ESP controls braking AND power. It applies braking individually to control the direction that the car is intended to go before loss of traction. And it will reduce engine power. It is effectively steering through brake control and engine control when it senses the car has lost traction.

You must not drive much, and that was far from abrupt.

>I don't believe OP just sat back and was interested how the Car would handle this while another car is steering towards you, maybe he actually was distracted or didn't pay attention.

You're absolutely right, he probably was. AP requires you to maintain attention and be able to intervene at a moments notice. The reason I say it's not FSD is because people should be intervening in these situations. They shouldn't be distracted driving or not paying attention. That's irresponsible to do with AP.

This guy honks. 
[Hand signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscene_gesture) are the traditional method of informing those with whom we share the road our intentions and/or acknowledgment of their poor driving skills and decisions. 
"Countries can be divided into those that mainly blow their horns as ""fuck yous"" and  those that mainly blow their horns as warnings.  The former, in my experience, are the US, the UK, South Africa.  The latter include India, tropical Asia and most of Africa.  


Maybe autonomous cars can have the ""fuck you"" horn blowing as an option."
"I'm not you buddy, guy!"
"I once spent literally an entire green light leaning on the horn while the driver in front had a conversation with someone in the back seat, having turned around to do so. They were the only car to make it through. "
The actual utility of the Bugle Charge! horn has been found.
I'm talking about stopped at a solid red light. I've been in quite a few situations where someone in the back of the line lays on their horn for absolutely no reason. 
"I don't think you're disagreeing with me. 

Reflexively telling someone off after they have put you in peril is *the very definition* of anger and road rage because it's an aggressive and responsive move. 

Beeping to stop someone doing something hatstand-stupid is defensive and preventative, and doesn't necessarily imply anger. 

I definitely agreee that people need to understand when they've fucked up though. "
I have bad news for you. Screaming at people and honking at them doesn't inform them that they fucked up. It only makes them angry at you. I'm not saying you're wrong about being a better driver. I'm saying that just going BEEEEP at people does not do anything to make them a better person or even punish them. They won't feel it.
Agreed. Can‚Äôt learn if one isn‚Äôt aware.
Do you think they care?
Agreed. Learning is impossible without feedback 
"I think that's a natural reaction when there is a threat to your safety or even just your car's bodywork.

"I don't know why all people don't want to, in my case it's because I don't have to care for it (maintain it), refuel it, think where to park, and a long etcetera 

Since I can afford to, I usually upgrade my car every four years to avoid it breaking down for example, it'd be awesome to just not need to have one and just have one transport me everywhere whenever I want (yes, I know taxis and uber exist, in my original utopia post it'd be free for everyone, or maybe a subscription model to have one car available at all times)"
"I like the idea of having a car that is mine - filled with camping gear and ham radio equipment sitting and ready to go for an adventure on any given weekend. Yes, it sits in my driveway unused for most of the week, but I don't care. That car is decked out with my gear and I don't want anyone else touching it.

&#x200B;

I could probably get rid of my second car that is used only for commuting if I could rely on Uber/Lyft, but last I checked, an Uber would cost me close to $80 one way for the 40 miles to work so I have a trash car to put those miles on while saving my good car for the fun trips.

"cars be expensive yo

edit: i guess i should be more specific, ""cars be expensive yo^^at ^^least ^^outside ^^of ^^the ^^US. """
"It really shouldn't take much imagination.  Parked cars are a huge waste of space, a waste of money when they're sitting idle and time takes it's toll.  Parking lots are a waste too.  There's something like 8 parking spaces for every car in America, that's a cost to business and a waste of land.  Not to mention, with autonomous Ubers and car rentals, it will very soon be cheaper to do that than own a car.  You don't need to be sober, you don't need to waste your time attention, etc...

The personal automobile has been more of a prison than freedom for Americans.  Think about how much you spend... You probably have a car or more per family member.  I saved a ton of money without a car in Seattle, and most of the time uber and busses were more convenient than an owned car.  Even in my rural town now, I bet if you convert everything magically from multi car families to single car families with good public transport, we'd all save money.

Narrow-mindedness and status quo bias won't serve you well.  That's the kind if thinking that believed nobody would use PCs or cellphones"
"Because it'll be expensive.  For \*most\* people owning will be nonsensical.  For those of us that want one, I'm sure we'll be able to own one.  Likewise hobbyists will still have their old muscle cars and whatnot, nobody is taking them away."
"Because it's much easier and more convenient to just have a computer drive you everywhere, rich people styles. Don't have to worry about driving, maintaining your car, fueling it up, paying a lot of money for it, etc. I'd be able to nap or play games in the car instead of having to drive it on my work commute. Imagine being able to essentially Uber everywhere, but have it be much cheaper than owing a car."
I‚Äôve seen enough public transportation filth... I‚Äôll keep buying cars.
Biggest tenet of defensive driving is to assume everyone around you is about to do the stupidest thing possible.
"I don't think you are suggesting proving a point. I know that's not what you want.

What I'm saying is that that is the reason most people honk.

As for your last question--do you mean me personally, or do you mean, when do I think people should honk?

If you are talking about me personally, it has to be danger to life or limb, and I have to be unable to prevent the situation in any other way. E.g. sitting at an intersection watching a car about to run over a pedestrian. I will do anything to get them to slam on their brakes or get the pedestrian to look up/ jump away. Or perhaps if someone is headed straight for me and there's nowhere to go to avoid them, maybe in a parking garage or on a narrow bridge.

In general, I think horns should be used as prescribed. We're on the same page there. It's just not happening and I can't change the minds of everyone else on the planet, so I have to deal with them as they are.

I haven't even brought guns into the conversation but I will say that it's pretty worrisome to me that so many people honk out of anger, because I don't want to send that signal out. Whether it's some huge truck or low rider or just some weird beater with a bunch of saran wrap taped to the taillights, I'm not taking my chances getting shot by offending someone. I stay to myself as much as possible!"
What about destabilize the interface with quantum algorithms?
Ruined by what? Finish your joke
The ESP system in ap1+ cars is some of the best I have ever seen to be honest. 
"It is wild and that's the fucked up part. I've had to slam my brakes before a bunch of times, never had a car lose control."
I call it ESP because that's what tesla calls it in their systems. Makes sense since it means electronic stability program. 
">So we're officially calling it ESP now?

It doesn't actually mean extra sensory perception sadly, it actually means (when talking about cars)[ electronic stability program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_stability_control)"
"It‚Äôs been called that for a (very) long time 

https://i.imgur.com/4VFjm8u.jpg

"At the end of the day, tesla vision is still Slam. Which means you are either adjusting everything based off of gyroscopic measures a huge amount, which would be bad when going over potholes/bumps as it has a high potential to pretty much break it entirely and drive you off the road. 

All self driving platforms (and papers) vehicle ego (that I have seen) assume only one dimensions of motion (forward) and doing error correction on slight lateral changes from lateral sway / predicted turning. 

Tesla ap2+ do have a bit of stereoscopic vision for the front, which could account for that, but I am highly sceptical that they do anything. 

On the CAN level that communicates with the EPAS for steering - messages from the ESP override that from autopilot. So even if AP can do it, it currently is not. 

"
Depending on the speed a small amount of input can lead to drastic course corrections. It doesn't take much input to upset the balance of a car at highway speeds. 
Exactly. AP should not have had to deal with this situation at all. This is where the driver should have intervened.
"Lotta ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù.  Personally, I‚Äôd trust a car with sensors‚Äô reactions over an inattentive driver‚Äôs any day. 

I don‚Äôt think, based on that footage, the driver could have initially reacted quicker than the car itself. "
"It should have some lee-way but if the car continues encroaching should force manual intervention. If the car came around, or there was a car following close behind the other car the Tesla would have it. AP is not FSD people, be attentive."
My guess is the sonic sensors detected the car and decided to center itself between the car and the median but then decided to break once it saw the car on radar.
I never understood the big deal with blind spots. You should never rely solely on your mirrors! Get a line of sight before changing lanes.
It's also inattentivness on the Tesla driver's part.  Practicing defensive driving means being aware of other drivers blind spots and removing yourself from them asap.
"Yes, I have seen what happens. It‚Äôs happened right in front of me on the highway before. I‚Äôm not saying it wasn‚Äôt impressive, but an attentive driver would‚Äôve done better, by hitting the brakes and horn, and not creating a dangerous situation oversteering. Jesus this sub gets bad."
"That's probably what people would have said about Autopilot (edit: Tesla Autopilot, as employed in this video) 50 years ago."
Is that still a thing? I haven't read a news story about that happening in a year or two. I don't go hunting for it though... 
"> Sure, but you see videos of Teslas on fire on the evening news

Where is the articles and videos on bmw's sentinel mode on the evening news? Or where is the ~50 articles hyping it up? "
Tesla fans turn around and say there is a war on Tesla when Tesla actually gets way more positive news than negative. Several car companies like BMW already have sentinel mode on their car but did you see any hype articles written on that? absolutely not. Yet there are ~50 articles about elon musk supposed sentinel mode.

If they already have it, what is the point of asking? The point is to get people to share it over social media, not to tell them something they already know. 
  
Aside from that fact, part of the ToS for using the AP beta program is that you surrender ALL driving telemetry to Tesla. They have it, so they have no need to ask for it. 
  
OP is doing exactly what Tesla wants, sharing an ‚Äúawesome save‚Äù to a viral platform and attracting attention to themselves. "
"Esp has no control over steering, ""effectively steering"" by breaking isn't steering, and this wasn't a loss of traction issue. Autopilot takes control of the actual steer by wire system and tells it to cut left or right. 

Esp controls *wheel slip* by, as you say, controlling braking and power. Esp operates through the abs system. Abs doesn't control braking in order to steer. It controls braking so you can stop consistently and predictably, eg. A straight line. "
You've given me examples of fantasy scenarios. In those cases law enforcement would be involved and handle the situation appropriately.

The only thing that's broken is your logic. Why shouldn't it be a good thing that a car by itself can prevent accidents? If you are alert the car doesn't have to intervene anyway. If you are not the car can save your life. So it's just an additional safety layer for the driver.

Give me some numbers please.

>You mean kind of like the driver of the Tesla?

Yes

>You're absolutely right, he probably was. AP requires you to maintain attention and be able to intervene at a moments notice. The reason I say it's not FSD is because people should be intervening in these situations. They shouldn't be distracted driving or not paying attention. That's irresponsible to do with AP. And before you say it, yes, I'm well aware there are people that drive distracted without AP and that doesn't make it right either.

Who disagreed with you that the autopilot is not a FSD vehicle? I haven't seen anyone who says that that and virtually nobody says you can stop paying attention when driving in AP mode. Tesla themselves say you have to have your hands on the wheel all the time. If people are too stupid to properly use the car it's not the cars or Teslas fault, it's the fault of stupid people."

I honked twice trying to be polite and the woman SLOWED down.

"Just the other day I used my horn. Not to warn another driver of my presence, but more for an affirmation of their pronounced stupidity. 

I know he saw me as he carelessly calculated his illegal u-turn. You see the road is divided up to a point, and he was exiting a right turn only. Problem was that there was traffic approaching from his left. So he waited and waited. Then as I approached, I had that ‚Äúoh look at what this asshole is going to do.‚Äù moment and took my foot off the gas and coasted with my foot covering the brake, and my thumb hovering over the horn. 

Sure as shit, he darted out of the Costco at an angle to get around the concrete barrier, then brake hard to make the tight u-turn. So, I stomped my brakes to avoid the collision and leaned on the horn. Sadly my windows were rolled up, and this lazy ass could not hear my expletives. 

He knew he was being a dick and was well aware that I was there. The honk was rather cathartic for me though. All he had to do was go to the other exit and make a left at the light. "

">The only thing that's broken is your logic. Why shouldn't it be a good thing that a car by itself can prevent accidents? 

I'm not saying that would be a bad thing. I'm saying that AP (or reliance on it) in this instance could have caused one. I would love for level 4 autonomy to be a thing, and have it be safer than a human driver. Heralding AP as being safer than human drivers is dangerous and not true. AP has tried to kill me on more than one occasion. 

>If you are alert the car doesn't have to intervene anyway. If you are not the car can save your life. So it's just an additional safety layer for the driver.

Except that we've seen people over-rely on it and AP is causing people to treat it like FSD and take risks they wouldn't normally take on the road. IE not paying full attention, being more distracted with other things. That's why we see people drive into the back of firetrucks, run into highway barriers, or broadside semis on AP.

>Here for you to visualize:

>Car without AP:

>Alert driver - ~~no collision~~ Potential collision

>Distracted driver - ~~collision~~ Potential collision

>Car with AP:

>Alert driver - ~~no collision~~ Potential collision

>Distracted driver - ~~no collision~~ Potential collision

Fixed that for you. This is an n=1 case. You can't cite this as proof that AP is safer than human drivers. Nor can we assume all alert drivers wouldn't have caused an accident. The fact that AP and AP like systems have been proven to cause delayed reactions in drivers and cause more distracted driving, you may be having near misses that wouldn't have occurred before. Hell, even drivers that are paying attention while on AP have longer reaction times than drivers without AP. Distracted driving *will* lead to more accidents, with or without AP. Acting like AP has your back if you are distracted is a dangerous misconception to have, especially since it has a penchant to sometimes *cause* a dangerous situation. IE driving into a freeway barrier.

At least we agree there.

>Who disagreed with you that the autopilot is not a FSD vehicle? I haven't seen anyone who says that that and virtually nobody says you can stop paying attention when driving in AP mode.

Yet you are saying AP is a crutch to make driving safer. While AP has been proven to make people pay attention to the road less. So sure, maybe it'll avoid an accident, but that very accident may not have occured if someone was paying attention to the road because they don't have AP. See my point?

>Tesla themselves say you have to have your hands on the wheel all the time. If people are too stupid to properly use the car it's not the cars or Teslas fault, it's the fault of stupid people.

Agree. This should have never been posted, because the driver of the Tesla shouldn't have been distracted and should have avoided the situation manually. What happened in the video was extremely dangerous and didn't need to happen."

I understand and agree with your sentiments above, actually. Parking real estate is a HUGE issue (no pun intended) and the sunk cost of owning a vehicle is enormous. That said, independent human-controlled vehicles will need to exist as long as we have the autonomy to go where and do what we want. Until you need to apply for an ""out-of-town"" permit, I don't see this changing. Status quo is as it is for a reason, for many good reasons, and sacrificing those in the name of advancement is just as shortsighted as sacrificing advancement for the sake of maintaining the status quo."
"Either way, it's impressive.  I spun an Evo out once in slick weather and totaled it.  The rear hydroplaned while I was changing lanes, and I think I slightly lifted the throttle, and I was in a very slow spin counter clockwise.  I ended up going all the way around.  The only thing I think might have had a chance of saving me was to gas my way out of it, but hindsight.  No ESP on that car, no SAS.  Just lots of locking diffs."
"They are highly recommended.  I got a set from Discount Tire with 18 inch wheels for about 1300ish out the door installed/lifetime balancing/rotation.  

I'm RWD.  The biggest thing is that I cannot start as fast as an AWD car.  But braking/turning is much better.  AWD doesn't help much turning on slippery and won't do anything for stopping faster.  

The traction control on these cars is pretty dang good.  I have been passing a lot of pickup trucks with all the ice/slush starting off at traffic lights."
"You may already know but AWD basically only helps with accelerating, not stopping. If you're problem is sliding when stopping or turning, new tires are what's needed to correct that."
"Thank you for the offer, but I will have to pass. 



"
Idk man. Fish tailing to avoid a simple lane incursion doesn't seem like an appropriate response.  
Lol that sounds cheap on say a 2001 anything lol
"You go live where you live now, that's your punishment lol law enforcement doing what ? Going against the hand that feeds them ? Just how stupid are you ?"
"[I'm not a journalist or a Hollywood actor, so I don't poses those kind of questions.](https://wsbt.com/entertainment/jim-carrey-blasts-donald-trump-for-kidnapping-migrant-children)

No, but the possibility of a police officer kidnapping your kid would really make you question giving them your house keys, hey? Giving them the keys means they could get in if you're in danger, let emergency services in if you have a fall you can't get up from, the benefits outweigh the opportunity for abuse, hey."
Netflix can't say anything. Their whole rating system is a thumb up or down.. absolute shit so they can't be trusted on their 80% number. 
">Not close to that I said (x3)

You're saying it's safer, it isn't.

>Yes, if you handle it correctly

Not according to any research on the matter.

>Not if you don't give a shit about your surroundings anymore. Not an inherent fault of AP, but of people who have to learn how to use it properly. You would probably also argue that GPS is stupid and unsafe when some people drive into rivers, because the GPS said so.

Again, this is not conjecture, it's been proven by numerous studies. Even while paying attention using an autopilot style system reaction times are slowed down. These are also people who KNOW something is about to happen. Being in direct control leads to faster reaction times than the feedback loop where something else is controlling and you are overseeing. Again, not my opinion, documented fact backed by numerous studies, one of which I gave the link to.

>Whatever you were trying, it's completely meaningless unless you believe that the probability of a collision for those 4 scenarios is the same, that's what my point was. 

I don't believe they are the same. I just don't believe in your sweeping ""collision vs no collision."" Your example left out the nuances of delayed reactions of people who use AP, even while maintaining situational awareness. It also doesn't take into account the mistakes caused by AP systems that people have to contend with. You are making straw men arguments.

>I'm sorry if that was too hard to understand.

At least you aren't condescending."
"It's my personal autonomy that gets me and yes, that is a different debate. 

Also, systems glitch. Fault should be assessed as it would for a human driver, as the rules governing fault do not change person-to-person. Things like snow on sensors, dirt, misaligned sensors and illuminator failures would have to remain the responsibility of the occupant to mitigate. Pre-trips would still be required to not assign any and all liability to the human driver."
"I had a similar experience in my Subaru on a track, best thing to do is maintain power and point the wheel. Where you should be going. Can be scary for sure! "
"Gotta admit, that's a pretty solid line of reasoning for a special needs kid. Now get off the computer before your handler comes in and thinks you were watching porn again. "
"An [external report](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers) estimates it at over 75%. They also don‚Äôt have a rating system, those thumbs you see are part of the recommendation engine. The scores are relative to each user so the scores you see are only for you.

But yeah, let‚Äôs just say everything is shit and leave it at that."
Mate you seriously need to read up. Netflix has no rating system üòÇ
Yeah.  I did a lot of track driving with the Evo too.  Press the gas and pray huh.  The Evo 9s actually didn't have a working rear LSD.  They took the stators/rotors in the LSD and stacked them so that they wouldn't actually act like an LSD.  Dum.  More understeer for us in the US....
Very funny retard since you've provided no line of reasoning but gone for name calling only. You deny the fact that the gov pays the police and all enforcement structures ? What a fucking idiot you are.
Their thumb up or down is their rating system. They've called it that on the phone on their support line to me.
"Hah that's crazy. Understeer was always a problem on Subaru and we built our cars correctly, I can only image the understeer on an Evo. "
"Yeah, it was annoying.  I never got around to pulling the diff to restack (which is what you could do).  I autox'd and really didn't have  too much trouble, but the car would just understeer.   With the right tires and the right throttle I could still rotate the car while it pushed but it was stupid.  "
I hope he reported the hell out of that bug!
"I guess sometimes we have to give the benefit of the doubt, even though it might sound ridiculous."
"I knew there had to be a logical explanation for this.  My thought was that the proper space was ICEd, and he backed in so someone else could charge in the same parking space.  The fact is, the car would not let him go into reverse until it received a charge.  He said he charged it for 5 minutes so the car would allow him to go in reverse, and then he turned it around.  I posted this photo with his permission."
[deleted]
weird because we all know going in reverse adds energy and going forward takes energy.
you could also just drive parallel to the chargers instead of off-roading it.
"I've had one situation where I could not disconnect the SU plug no matter what I did.  It would not respond to the button on the plug, the phone app nor the dash display.   I had to wait until it charged to 100% and then finally let it disconnect. "
"It would have been even more fun if the cord didn't reach, and he had to drive all over the grass and curbs to come around and try a different angle.

Hey, he could have parked across three stalls. He had the courtesy to go off-roading to ensure other drivers had access to the adjacent stalls."
We should be ashamed. We judged that poor man too quickly.
That is a massive hazard that you can't shift into reverse because of a low battery.
Ironically mine was stuck going into either park or drive with 80% battery. I had to get out of the car and get back in for it to go into reverse. 
We live in a world where we assume the worst in people.  We should assume there is a rational explanation rather than the world is full of dumb fucks.

"Saw this on r/idiotsincars and knew there had to be a story to it

Can't seem to find the post now though"
This bothers me more than it should 
"I've always had a high opinion of Tesla's, but looking through this thread there seems to be a hell of a lot of bugs and problems with them :/. I've never had any problems like these in any car I've owned... "
"Real pinnacle of technology, there"
I saw this on r/idiotsincars a couple days ago I think. 
I feel like I would put it in neutral and try to push it in the right position before I risk damaging the body or frame
"Improvise, adapt, overcome."
"When you buy a tesla, a little bit of elons intelligence gets transferred to you "
can you not push the car...?
"If it looks stupid, but works, it ain't stupid "
Why not double-park? He could use the same station and still be on the road if the car was rotated 90¬∞ to the right
Maybe ran out of charge and got towed? 
Why would the car require a charge to allow reverse?
Or he could have parked longways across several spaces and moved it if someone else showed up
"Where's Elon, I bet here's posted somewhere in here /u/deffonotelon"
"[Boldly going forward, 'cause we can't find reverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCARADb9asE)"
At least there wasn't a jackass in a lifted truck blocking it.
"It's not a bug, it's a feature. "
That seems like a fun thing to purchase.
"... I just realized he did this knowing he could not back out. One shot, one opportunity."
Wasn‚Äôt there an image of this from a different angle (and during the day) on the front page yesterday ?
*Modern problems require modern solutions*

"Plot twist....  he did it for the reddit points.

He has redeemed himself!
Lmao two sides to every story. 
"I can't see the spaces over... but I imagine there is still a better option... 3-5 minutes of taking up 3 spaces would have allowed for charging.  Also, I haven't tried pushing on in neutral, but is that not a viable option?"
So you chose to do this instead of taking two stalls for 10 mins. 
"Well, this explains the other photo "
Y'all are really beta testers for a car
Boo
Guess the car was forward biased
Recovery 100
There‚Äôs the answer to the other pic.  
Weak sauce he can‚Äôt push it
Um...looks like he had plenty of room to pull up alongside that charge station. But I guess i can‚Äôt see the rest of the parking 
"Still doesn't make sense, it looked like he could have approached perpindicular in the original photo..."
At least we will always have Tesla Gas Station Lady
What happens when you put the car in neutral?
Serious question. Isn‚Äôt there neutral? Couldn‚Äôt he put it in neutral and push it backwards?
"Question, can a tesla ""shift into neutral""?"
Not true 
Is there not a neutral on a Tesla? 
He could have drove around and came from the other side and drove across the curb and made it worst he backed in.
Maybe if he stopped charging his phone around 50% he'd have had enough juice to turn in sideways.
I saw the other post the other day. This really clears up the situation. Possible r/softwaregore too? 
"What possible reason is there to restrict shifting in reverse in ANY situation? What if instead of a supercharger it's his garage charger that can't reach the back? Is he forced to drive into his house?

My EV just restricts acceleration if I drive it down to like 5%, but I can shift into reverse if I want. WTF Tesla?

You don't design a car that's awesome only when the conditions are ideal. You design a car so that it is 100% functional until it completely dies."
"There's always two sides to a story EY? 
Bet old mate from a couple of days ago is feeling like a douche now. "
Ouch
"Man that's crazy. I can put my car in reverse even when it isn't on. How does a new car lose features?

Maybe you guys will be able to pay for ""reverse anytiome"" in the future."
Couldn't he have just driven it close enough and then just push it backwards like normal cars? :) Or the drivetrain for electrics does not allow you to?
So it's the cars fault actually
"I do snow removal at a mall with tesla charging station and a trucker parked in front of it, couldnt get at them at all. I wonder what this fellow would have done in that situation... I would be entertained by his solution, no doubt. "
put it in neutral and push it into place
"I just saw this pic from another angle in another subreddit. r/idiotsincars i think? r/idiotswithcars? Idk, but its there. Interesting. "
So he didn‚Äôt park parallel to the curb?
Might want to get that shit checked out.
I bet a software update can fix that. 
Modern problems require modern solutions
It looks like at least two ports are empty on the left.... couldn't he just parallel next to them?
"Still pretty stupid

Neutral then push it?
Can you  not push them? 
"LOL what garbage

Can't go in reverse because of a software issue?

10/10 reliability "
"Not too smart. They probably could‚Äôve parked across a couple spots like people have done before. Not the best idea but if there were other open spots, and it only took a few mins of charge to go into reverse. I never would‚Äôve driven my car up like that. So dumb. "
put it in neutral and push it then do this..
I've never been so conflicted by a sub's two top posts.
"That‚Äôs weird, my gas vehicle lets me do whatever I want. (Prepared for downvotes, it‚Äôs just a number lololololol)"
"I don‚Äôt buy it. Why would the car have a feature like that? If it‚Äôs a bug, how would he know that charging it would fix it? Don‚Äôt believe everything you read online, kids. "
"Ok, now I want the explication of that woman who wanted to recharge her Tesla using gasoline ... "
"I mean, whats the deal with Tesla reverse?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø."
Ok buylt why didn't he just park perpendicular then instead of driving over the grass... He's still stupid.
"I'll never own one at this rate, so forgive my ignorance. Does a Tesla not have neutral? 

I'd chose to drive it away from the charger and then push it back if possible."
So these things don‚Äôt have neutral? 
Turns out Teslas themselves are stupid. Who would have guessed?
Seems like a case of fear of backing in into the charging spot üòíüòíüòíü§£
Why not put the car in neutral and push the car into the charger parking spot?
Tesla owners are not that stupid. TESLAS are that stupid.
Why tf cabt it go in reverse?? 
Serious question. Has anyone died because of bugs in the software? Having it all be software controlled is cool and all but security is a big concern for me
"""luxury car brand"" "
why didnt he drive in a circle lol
And that's why I don't drive an electric 
He couldn‚Äôt have backed up to the one next to it?
Good luck with your electric cars people. Whomp whomp
"Not that stupid

Buys a car that won't go in reverse


"
It sounds intentional though.  Though why they'd do it in the first place is baffling.
Where do you properly report bugs? My service center just told me to make a Twitter and tweet Elon...
"Do you know what happens when you report a bug?

You wake up to a software update the next morning.

It doesn't matter what the bug is, the fix is always a software update. 
"
I have the same bug right now. Can't switch into drive or reverse without doing a hard reboot.
"""bug"""
OP reversed over from the road for karma.

There's a severe lack of it lately. Everybody just assuming the other person is stupid and/malicious and responds accordingly.
Wrong sub. This is where you be a pretentious asshole.
"Yea, you should just assume that not having complete control of your vehicle is for the best."
I wonder if it could have just been put into neutral and pushed back in.
Not sure why the car would refuse to go into reverse until it received a charge.
"I don‚Äôt own a Tesla, why it won‚Äôt go into reverse?"
Least he corrected it once the car let him.
What is ICEd?
Why would he not just put it in manual and push it?
Totally logical that a car won't go into reverse because it doesn't think it should despite a human telling it to.
Is there an explanation tho? I've never ever hears of an electric motor refusing to go the opposite direction just because of a low power source. All it is is flipping the polarity of the energy flow to the opposite direction.
Could he had parked it parallel to the charger? 
"For next time:

https://i.imgur.com/Ujw70f0.gifv"
"Litterally every mall/department store charger looks the same, but this one looks particularly familiar. Indiana by any chance? "
That was my thought! I was thinking how someone else probably shifted their car and he hasn't yet so it was likely just awkward timing. 
"I've had that happen twice and I'm very certain it's when you use your phone to start the car. Sometimes you might get in and go to drive and it won't let you cause it hasn't seen the ""key"" yet from the phone, if that makes sense."
"Lol, software issue on a car. Man. I remember the first time I had to do a firmware update for the lightbulbs in my house. I had such mixed feelings about the whole situation."
"Mine refused to shift into park.

The cold also makes my rear child-locked door just pop itself open anytime the handles present. At least it doesn't do it whenever I hit 65 mph instead."
I have the same issue right now. Please call Tesla service and report it. Mine has progressively gotten worse and the car will refuse to go into gear without a hard reboot.
I had that in my driveway a while ago. Had to power down (not the two button push) and start it. Not thrilled.

"I always drive my Tesla in reverse, never had to charge it so far."
"Reverse doesn't add energy, it reduces mileage."
Oh right I forgot that's how it works

"""Hey..  we have a car.  The charging port is on the rear.  The chargers are at the front of the space.  We have a software mode that prevents the car from going backwards in low charge.""

They could also just have thought all this through.  Put a second charging port at the front.  Design your charging spaces properly.  Don't use software to forcefully control behaviors unless it would _literally_ damage the car to operate that way."
and the same folks that took a picture of him and made fun wouldve taken a picture and called him a douche
"Or, you know, just push it backwards with your foot out the door..."
And take up parking spots for other people. How nice of him. 
If there enough empty spaces and the supercharging station has enough space to pull in parallel.  I doubt he would have gone offroading had that been the case.
Came here to say this. Why risk damaging your expensive car like this? 
The other stalls were occupied.  He would have done this had it been possible.
What if he pulled in at roughly 90¬∞ for some reason prior to deciding to back in. Maybe it was just too late to shift orientation
"FYI, there's a manual release latch for the charging port. It's right behind the charger port on the inside of the trunk. I had it stuck before too and had to Google it to find out how to release it manually. "
Tesla S will fit in two stalls just fine. 
"I love my model 3, but it's buggy and seems like it's getting worse. Meanwhile we're getting Teslatari and Fart Mode."
But at least he knows how to keep his phone battery charged.  
"If you run out of gas in an ICE car, can you shift at all?"
Whereas an ICE car that's out of fuel will go neither forwards nor backwards unless you push it.
Total massive hazard. We should protest! I've never had a gas car refuse to shift gears. /s üôÑ

How so?  The car not going into reverse?  The whole Reddit world jumping to bad conclusions?
"Probably not. 

Why would you buy something you don't have full control over?"
Remember people tend to be more vocal about bad experiences than good experiences online. I‚Äôve had my Model 3 for almost a year now and have not experienced any of these problems. 
"You wouldn't have problems like these. It's unique to electric.

But other cars for damn sure have their share of problems."
"Yes, and it was cross-posted here.  I had to get to the bottom and post the explanation before people continued to make bad assumptions about the poor man."
If they had there'd be four Reddit posts about it within an hour. This way the charger on the right is almost usable.
It shouldn't. This is almost certainly a problem with OP's car specifically.
I swear on everything there was! I was just thinking the same thing.
This was my exact thought. Pull in sideways taking up 3 spots. Unless there were more cars there
Right?
The car rolls freely. Just like any other car.
If my options were to drive forward onto grass or push a car in neutral alone I would drive onto the grass.
Answer: Yes.
I work as an engineer for a company that makes shifters. There are no circumstances where Drive is permitted and Reverse is restricted. There is something wrong with OP's car that needs to be addressed by Tesla.
Was there snow and a truck blocking the chargers? Because I think the Boring Company not a Flamethrower is the answer to both.
nah tesla drivers prefer to use electricity instead of muscle. because saving the world cannot be hard work
"Yes, it was x-posted here in /r/teslamotors and /r/TeslaLounge.  It's what prompted me to find the answer as to what really happened."
and block everyone else?
"No, the other stalls were occupied"
"Other stalls were occupied, there wasn't enough space to park parallel."
"If a car gets the suspension damaged by that little bit of ""off-roading"", there would be some serious design flaw in the suspension. I can assure you he'll be fine."
You can put Teslas in neutral just like any other car. That's probably what OP should have done.

"Yeah, I'm so angry too.

We all should have to parallel park for minutes then back out and back in just to charge.

In no way shape or form can we increase the length of wire or allow you to change gears while low battery.

C'mon man. This is a huge design flaw and needs fixing."
I believe the car puts itself it park the second your butt cheek leaves the seat.
"It's pretty rare either way, gas or EV, but I have definitely driven gas cars where the reverse transmission was not working."
"I agree. There seems to be many people suggesting that the model 3 has this or that unknown bug. I have been on this thread a long time and bugs are normally well known and logged damn fast. This really feels different.

"It was most definitely fake.  The person taking the video had his phone out immediately before they could have even known she was trying to fill it with gas.

"pulled in normal like, 

oh wait it wont fit ill back out and pull in sideways/backwards,

elon: no my child, you much charge first"
Tesla does have neutral. It is a legal requirement to register a vehicle that it can be removed from the road in a no-power state. Tesla is no exception. I put my M3 in neutral once a week to go through a car wash.
They do have neutral. That would have been the correct course of action IMHO
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting from this entire thread 
"Tesla has a much lower fatality rate than other car companies. This is definitely a problem though. I work as an engineer for a shifter company, and almost every shifter we make is ""shift by wire"" so, this isn't unique to Tesla.

"You wouldn't need to put it in neutral.  If the car as at a standstill in drive, it behaves just like neutral.  If you take your foot off the brake and you're on a hill (and didn't press the brake hard enough to engage hold, or the hill isn't steep enough for hill hold to engage), the car rolls.  It's possible with someone's help, he may have been able to do this.

Because he could only go forward, he'd have to drive toward the supercharger, turn left and away and then line it up with a pedestal.  This would leave the car pretty far away, and they'd have to push it back a good distance.  He may have not have had enough distance to do this, due to the configuration of the parking lot."
or just drove over the curb and grassy knoll and park like a normal person.

Maybe it's time tesla makes a damn extension cord to keep in the trunk like a modern jumper cable for nose first parking.  You wouldn't use it most of the time just only when backing it in isn't happening. 
I'm not familiar with the charging but how long does it take to move up a couple percent? I'd probably pull parallel for the 10-15 minutes to boost the battery up a bit and just hang out then move it after. Unless it won't let you move it until you have 50% charge or something.
"I doubt it was forced to not use Reverse. Staged picture, just like the guy standing there like a gas pump. 

Second charging port at the front is a bad solution. Many charging stations have at least one charger that is intended for people to pull in. "
How thicc are your legs??
"First, there is no-one else in the picture at the station. Second they claimed it had to charge some before Reverse would engage (I'm skeptical on this, looks more like a staged picture."
"not buying that. You would back in normally, so they would drive around so that they can back in. Then supposedly reverse wouldn't engege, so they would have to drive around again to face in the position they are in for the picture. 

The whole thing looks staged. Badly staged too."
It‚Äôs almost like different teams work on different features. 
"Not a Tesla/EV driver, just an inquisitive combustion engine guy. This honestly sounds like a nightmare. Imagine having smartphone like issues with your car, Jesus. "
what's buggy with it? i really haven't had many issues with mine at all in 3 months.. maybe sometimes the handle doesn't work on the door for 2 or 3 attempts at the worst case.. ? 
"Welcome to Tesla ownership. It‚Äôs even more fun when they‚Äôre adding fart mode and video games while an update they just pushed causes your instrument cluster to reboot every minute while you‚Äôre driving so you have no idea how fast you‚Äôre going. 

And the suggested solution is to drive a different car until they fix it, which should be within 4-6 weeks.

It definitely gets worse. Once your car doesn‚Äôt have the latest version of everything, the number of bugs that you get increases substantially since they seem to only test the code on the newest cars. "
And dog mode now!
Yes
the battery wasn't dead...so what's your point?
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs true for EVs too right? I mean.. if you fully run out of charge it‚Äôs not like an Elon genie will materialize out of thin air and start powering the car with the tears of TSLA shorts is it?
"Except that this car still had a charge, it wasn‚Äôt a dead battery, so what‚Äôs your point?


Compare it to an ICE that is really low on gas, then you have an argument. "
*Unless you drive a manual. Always an exception üòâ
Having it refuse to switch to reverse while doing a 3 point turn would indeed be a massive hazard.

I already have beef with Tesla reverse. After finding myself in a bad situation I had to back out quick only to find out it can only go backwards like 15mph! So here I am with a supercar that backs up like a motorized wheelchair. 
True! 
There's a lot of bugs in here that do apply to normal cars. Centre console problems for example. 
"Yea, like they go right into the gear you put them in."
"You could have this problem actually. I work for a shifter company, and most of our products are ""shift by wire"" these days. So other cars could have a problem getting to reverse because there's no physical connection between the shifter and the transmission. That said, this is almost certainly a problem with OP's car specifically and needs service. I doubt very much that it's intended functionality."
"It‚Äôs already unusable with the way he parked lol He‚Äôs using the left one and blocking the right. Double-parking would allow him to charge with the left station (while still blocking the right station), but wouldn‚Äôt force him to curb his Tesla"
Agreed
Why couldn't he put it in neutral?
"I‚Äôm sure it would be much more acceptable than a diesel parking in front, especially if the owner explained it to the others."
!!!!! Touched by virtual fame!
Carry on.... nothing to see here then.

A new Tesla driver rolled back into my girlfriend at a stop light and had no idea what happened.  She went through insurance to get an inspection but he claims she rear-ended him.  She was starting to think she was crazy until we looked up this fun fact.  Not a lot we can do from there :\

You can still turn the wheels even if you're pushing the car. Requires some body strength. But doable.
"I also don‚Äôt go into reverse when it‚Äôs cold. When life gives you the cold shoulder, the only way is forward. "
"Not sure why that's relevant.

If there's enough juice in the battery to go into drive it can also go into reverse.

I don't know if he's telling the truth or saving face but he should be talking to Tesla about it."
"Which really isn't a logical explanation.

Edit: to those who are downvoting me, please explain to me how the cold could cause the car to not shift into reverse.  It's not a mechanical process, is it?  Isn't just reversing the polarity of the power to make the motor go the other way?"
"That seems like a bad idea.  Don't Li-ion batteries start degrading when they go below ~20% charge?  

Does the system prevent users from doing this, or provide a warning?"
That is pretty impractical if true.

Curb isn't that high. Shouldn't damage anything.
You risk damage when someone is pissed off and decides to key your car. Also it's just a dick move.
"I think for that to work the supercharger would need to know the cable is in place and reduce the amount of current provided. The existing supercharger cables are sized to handle the amount of current being carried for a specific length, and an extension cord messes with that calculation.  


Definitely something Tesla could do, but it might not be cheap for something almost never needed."
Still irresponsible to not postpone meaningless updates in favor of putting more resources into something relating to safety. I'd rather have a functioning car than a car that has Easter eggs on its tablet.

"It seems like the working theory on this thread is that it wouldn't go into reverse because.... of extremely low battery power.  So yes, basically it was."
It didn't shift was his point.
Teslas always have a charge.  There's at least 4kWh left after the car completely shuts off and no longer does anything.

I believe the 'Emergency Juice' Function after your car dies for getting it on a flatbed only goes forward.
"Atleast my car does crazy shit in the cold too. The other day parking it in my driveway ""park"" behaved like neutral and started rolling down the hill and threw up an error about the parking break unable to engage, press button on shift stalk to reset. It engaged after pressing the button. I tried repeating it twice for science. It kept repeating the exact same behavior."
"It might be that the battery was so low that it would have prevented the car from going into drive too, but since it was already in drive he could still move.  If he had parked, he might not have been able to get it into drive or reverse."
squeezing your 70k car through that gap up the curb is probably the last thing anybody even idiots want to do.
"It seems as if you're looking for a rational explanation of an irrational ""feature"". You won't be satisfied. 

"
The car doesn't let you go so low that you'll damage the batteries. 
"Li-ion degrades faster at a full charge and at near empty but both effects are over the long term. A few minutes at either end is no big deal.

If you are going to park it at an airport you want it between 50-90% when you leave it. If you are literally about to plug it in and charge it right away you can play around near 0 miles remaining on the dash with no harm done. If you are literally about to drive away when the charge ends you can charge to 100% and unplug and go with no harm done.

It takes a long time at either end to be an issue."
"They're cool and all, but add completely unnecessary complication. This is the only car I have ever had to fix a door handle one, let alone multiple times now.

A while back there was a post about an update, and I confirmed it on mine, they don't bite anymore! I think there are a few unlucky ones that still do, but most now just go limp and springy if there is resistance to retraction."
"If the posts about it being a technical problem are correct, it just took a 5 minute charge for him to be able to get the car in to reverse and park it properly.  I believe I'd understand if he were blocking 1 extra charger while he corrected this issue for 5 minutes, rather than damaging the car."
"Actually, he was still blocking a charger this way, since he ended up having to use the left charger (which was intended for the spot he's not in) and is blocking access to the right charger (by being in the spot).

&#x200B;

Not that it really matters... it was clearly an extraordinary circumstance, not laziness or being a dick."
"It's a dick move if you do it because you are inconsiderate.  If you do it because your car has a legitimate problem, it's fine.  Shit happens and sometimes you have to have a little understanding.  I can't base my decisions on the possibility that someone will be an asshole and commit criminal vandalism because I had a car problem that delayed their charging by a whole 5 minutes.  "
Seems acceptable.  They already have a simple data link between charger and car to negotiate charging rate.  If the extension cord were to just run at a slower level that would boost someone just enough to then get it backed in proper and finish up normal. 
What? 2 metres of cable isn't going to add much resistance

Empty battery usually means going nowhere.  Tesla has reserved the last few electrons so that you can get it onto a flatbed.  That's the intention, and not a design flaw.  To ""fix"" it?

Put it in neutral then _push_ it backwards."
You're making assumptions about him already being in the spot. But anyways the person asked a better way to park and sideways is the better way
Can you put a Tesla in neutral? He could have pushed it in
"To start I think there is no real problem with what he did, however:

He probably didn't pull in front first to start, since they would be used to needing to reverse into the spot. He only would have done this once he realized he couldn't get into the spot normally by reversing. 

If you want my ridiculous opinion, he should have just driven in straight from over the sidewalk, boom problem /solved. "
">Yes because someone in a wheelchair will pull up in that 5 minute window he's parked there

So that's not possible? 

Another Tesla Douche! 
"
Couldn't they just roll it back or.park sideways. Still stupid 
"I guess I am not following you, but clearly I am a caveman ;-)

I am rarely creeping forward from a stop, and if I am it's because I am in stop and go traffic. In those cases I use auto pilot, so I am zero pedal driving.

The selection is totally personal, which I am glad Tesla lets us choose. My Leaf would only creep and it drove me a little crazy, especially knowing it was an artificial behavior programmed in.

I can't speak for why others would turn off creep, but until I went electric my cars were manual. When I turn off creep, I feel I am back to a manual car - it only goes when I tell it to. I never have gotten used to the creep of an automatic."
"That's weird, I get single pedal driving without creep. In your method, you have to switch between the pedals for the first part and the second part. (like a caveman :P)

Stopping or inching forward from a stop or going only a few mph for whatever reason: use the accelerator pedal. Without creep, you learn the sweet spot in the accelerator pedal where it switches from braking, coasting, and accelerating. You only need the brake pedal if you need to do a hard stop.

The problem of not having creep, is that most people are used to automatic cars with creep and having their foot on the brake pedal for the second part. So when they want their car to stop, they instinctually press down. However, using true single pedal driving without creep, pressing down will have them press down on the accelerator. It's a brain slip up, causing low speed crashes. 

I actually had a new Tesla employee back in 2013 dent my bumper because he was bringing it around after they serviced and washed it. He was pulling up, and when he meant to stop the vehicle, he accelerated it into the car in front of him.

After that, I turned creep back on, especially since my wife may drive it. Now I'm switching pedals like a caveman again."
"You don‚Äôt have a clutch pedal, use your left foot for braking, friend, like a race car driver üòé"
"That is not the definition of single pedal driving. True single pedal driving is not possible in a Tesla (but is in other EV's). You need regen all the way down to zero MPH, and then you never need the brake. Doesn't work at all with creep."
You've convinced me to try it with creep mode ON.  My daily commute is city streets.  Your explanation makes perfect sense.
Tow mode
Not an EV/Tesla guy (I drive a 98 Cherokee xj) but still I have to agree: all this tech sounds like a PITA. 
Being in drive provides resistance through regenerative braking. It's enough resistance that the rollers at the car wash would go under my car instead of pushing it forward.  They had to shut it down until we could figure out how to put my M3 in neutral.  No regenerative in neutral
It's a full service wash + detail place so someone was thankfully right there to hit the kill switch. But it was a few seemingly eternal seconds of dragging the car and desperately trying to put it in neutral while it just kept making that damn error sound.
"Is that you, Jimmy Butler?"
Seems like a pretty clear thing that should be fixed with a software patch.
Yeah there should be an override avaliable for this
"Write down the time so you remember it, and email that in as a support ticket to make sure it isn't an ongoing problem - that could be bad.  Tesla can check the logs in 3-4 weeks or however long it takes support to get back to people lately."
There are two modes. Parking brake on and off. The rest is electric. Turn the motor one way for forward and the other for reverse. 
"It not shifting into reverse in the cold is a ""feature""?  Or are we assuming it was it due to low battery?  Because that's not the original explanation by OP."
But it lets you go low enough the car won't shift?
"But going into it, did he know it was *only* going to be 5 min? What if the car locked itself in position, for some unknown bug?"
2 meters of too thin cheap chinese aluminium cable would however.
2 meters of very thick cable. Plus an extra connection. It would be a $800 item for rare circumstances.

"We have a model S, and a 2001 F350 7.3L diesel.  So both ends of the spectrum.  The software bugs are irritating but driving a spaceship is awesome.  The truck has its own set of quirks, obviously, and I feel much more equiped to handle the mechanical issues.  I can always get out some plyers and mess with the electrical until it starts.  But I would pick the Tesla every day to drive if it had the truck's capacity."
"Then you‚Äôre not experiencing what we are. Mine takes 30 seconds to reboot, and it happens often. "
Most modern cars won't engage the starter if the car is in gear and/or the clutch is engaged. 
"I build electric vehicles for a living. There is no clear difference between a dead and low battery, a 'dead' battery still has plenty of energy. The tesla will turn off/limit things if the battery gets too low because either the voltage is insufficient (unlikely) or the battery can't go much lower without becoming damaged.

Id wager that the battery was extremely low, and basically the car wasn't going to let the driver change anything until it reached the point of turning off completely, as any change in drive train settings could draw enough amps to damage the battery. It was irresponsible to let the battery get this low, much like it's irresponsible to drive on an empty tank. "
Not making excuses. Just pointing out facts.
Ask Tesla
do you live in mad max??? 
"Sure, granted it can't go as fast in reverse, but how many times do you need to do that on the road? I've been driving for 15 years and I've literally never had to reverse faster than a walk. "
"What nobody seems to have suggested yet is to make that feature work in reverse as well as in drive, to make cases where you roll into a back-in-only charging station with preposterously low charge left not force owners to make further concessions, like this guy did, risking the underbody of his Tesla.

Most people don't reverse at the end of a drive that leaves the battery fully empty unless it's necessary. Reversing at the end of a drive is really only a parking lot maneuver, as intended by whoever designed supercharging. They made it a necessary part of charging at many stations."
Why the fuck do tow trucks have a winch? 
"You can, it's a tesla.  It has neutral both in D with no throttle pressed and when in tow mode.  "
"> I‚Äôve seen plenty of pictures of people that hit 0% and still drive to a charger. 

You have never seen true zero ""shutting down"" like I was talking about.  No wonder you don't believe it, you don't know that running out is possible.  You get this if you ignore the warnings and keep driving.

That thing you didn't know about, that doesn't have reverse.  The shut down has a completely different mode that is only intended to pull onto flatbeds at a 1 mph top speed."

"Eh, why bother. It's on bags. Just lift it up and go for it."
"Creep makes the car behave like a classic automatic car running on gas. When you release the brake, it will start rolling slowly. For more speed, use the gas pedal. 

In traffic this is useful because a lot of times you don't need a lot of speed, so then you regulate your cars speed with the brake pedal. Pressing it is stop, releasing it is driving slowly."

"Maybe i'm doing it wrong, but I've not been able to get tow mode to work.  Still goes into park when I get off the seat."
"I wasn't there to observe your anecdote but regenerative braking resistance should only be present if the car is at speed. I'm guessing the issue is that you got out of the car during the wash which automatically engages the parking brake again. The manual specifically states that, if you need the car in neutral and are leaving the vehicle, you need to put it into Tow mode:

>Neutral
>
>Push the lever up or down to the first position and hold it there for more than 1 second to shift into Neutral. Neutral allows Model 3 to roll freely when you are not pressing the brake pedal.
>
>If Model 3 is in Park and you use the touchscreen to release the parking brake (Controls > Safety & Security), Model 3 shifts into Neutral (see Parking Brake on page 55).

>Model 3 automatically shifts into Park when you exit. To leave Model 3 in Neutral, use the touchscreen to engage Transport Mode (see Instructions for Transporters on page 163)."

"He didn't, but with how buggy some Teslas are, the excuse, ""my car wouldn't let me go into reverse if I didn't charge it"", the fact that he would at most take up 2 spots, and another tesla could probably back up to his car and still make use of the charging station at the end.

That and if its locked taking up two spots or locked while mounting a curb the dude will be screwed either way, I rather it be the way where I'm not at risk of losing a bumper being towed away."

A Tesla model 3 weighs somewhere between 3500 and 4000 pounds.  A 2019 Chrysler 300 weighs somewhere between 3500 and 4000 pounds.  There is no difference.

> when you can save yourself the trouble and just drive it foward?

"Dude, seriously. You think I'd shut down a car wash because I got out of and failed to see the car went into Park? 

Being in drive turns in regenerative braking, which provides resistance. There's stories online where people have charged the car by towing it in drive."
"The car lowers down if the charge state is too low to protect the battery. If it goes be,is a certain voltage, it cannot be recharged. This permitted forward but not reverse. Or are you saying it never left drive? The tow hook is in front. A tow truck can easily pull it forwards up onto the bed but might need the truck driver to be able to back it out of a spot first. "
Ah that makes sense. Thanks for the clarification
[deleted]
Software engineers need breaks too. These are mindless tasks to amuse and recharge (pun intended) before getting serious again. 
"I'd rather it go a few more miles forward without a reverse gear than it just stop moving all together. If you wouldn't, then just turn off the car when you get low. 

Im not a software engineer at Tesla, but if I were to guess, there's some increase in current associated with switching to/driving in reverse. The software doesn't allow it (or switches back to drive) because the battery sags below the cut off momentarily. I've seen this before with custom electric cars, once the battery is drained it sags very quickly doing anything other than accelerating slowly. For example, switching the direction of the motor or closing a contactor could cause a surge large enough to drop below the cutoff.

There are two solutions: Increasing the voltage threshold (effectively reducing range) or making the threshold leniant for momentary surges (potentially leading to battery damage).

All things considered, the way it is currently is probably the best. The car will give you all it can without risking damage. "
"You can call it whatever you want. 

Assuming that the ""emergency power mode"" or whatever everyone else is calling it was activated, the battery was dead.  The plus side of it is that you could still get it into a flatbed without having to have it dragged.  If you run out of gas in an ICE, you don't even have that. So tell me where I'm wrong?"
"Why were you facing oncoming traffic?? You know what, never mind. I don't think this conversation is very productive. "
Am I holding the gearlever wrong? That's what I feel I'm about to get told next. Last resort should work in any direction up to 4 or 5mph.
You said you didn't believe the mode exists.  It does.  That's why he had no reverse.

I remember needing to push a BMW i3 and that shit was heavy. That's the reason that comment was made. Sorry that upset you. Next time I'll make sure I'll spend hours of ""research"" for a cars weight so you won't get upset.

>Why buy a Tesla at all when you can save yourself the trouble and buy a vehicle that doesn't randomly refuse to go in reverse for nebulous reasons?

Why buy a car at all when you can save yourself the trouble and buy a bike that doesn't develop any car issues in the first place? 

See, that's what it's like trying to have a conversation with someone who wants to throw all rational away and just make a poorly researched and mostly emotional point.. it's just frustrating and a waste of everyone's time.

But are you lonely this Valentine's day, so you're lashing out in jealousy or something? I've never seen someone act so emotionally butt hurt over such a simple made comment lmao."
"Is it honestly more complicated than pressing the ""Tow Mode"" button and waiting for it to change colors?  "
"Look, man... I'm just telling you what the manual says. You can put the car into neutral. I've taken my car through a car wash without any issue so clearly you did something wrong. The only actual issue with running a Model 3 through a car wash is that I had to turn off the auto-wipers and fold in the mirrors. Other than that, whatever you did was on you."
"Actually, you're so locked in, you didn't process his argument. A reasonable consumer would know that Easter egg team and driving team are 2 different teams, so the optics wouldn't be bad like you're claiming. "
"Hmm that could be plausible, but it just seems unlikely to me that it could have enough power to move a 2 ton vehicle around but not enough power to switch the direction of the current in the motor. "
">  there's some increase in current associated with switching to/driving in reverse. 

Doesn't make any sense. Same gearing, same mass, same power draw for the same acceleration, only different polarity. Add a percent or extra efficiency loss from driving the helical differential gears backwards, maybe? 

>because the battery sags below the cut off momentarily.

Absolutely, but then it would sag in both forward and reverse nearly the same, still doesn't explain why the car would need to be able to drive forwards fine (enough to climb a curb and small incline) but not at all in reverse, not even creeping along. 

Discounting some strange, illogical power management quirk, this present a serious downside/problem. What if he couldn't hop the curb, if it was a foot tall like in front of the Superchargers in my city and the other spaces were taken/not possible to reach without reverse. 

Where is the logic/safety in completely screwing the driver in that situation and leaving them possibly stranded, rather than just allowing the car to creep at 2mph in reverse if it has no trouble at all with moving forwards at typical acceleration rates/loads like it has here?

IMO we'll see them patch this feature to some degree, when it comes down to 'doing this may decrease the overall life of your battery by 0.5%' or 'your only option is to cancel your plans, call, wait for and pay for a tow while literal feet away from a power source', adding an acceptance checkbox of 'emergency reverse mode' seems like the far more reasonable, practical choice here."
"Wouldn't the emergency juice mode just be the equivalent of having a gallon of gasoline in your trunk? 

I'm taking a dead battery as a dead, ""I can't even turn on"" battery. in which case it has no power. If it still has power to move that means its not without power. 

Even in an ICE, my car can be reading 0 miles to e for the last 20 miles, its not out of gas until the engine cuts out. "

"Skidding out while avoiding an accident and then trying to get back. There could be tons of other situations like backing out of driveway if your house is on a busy street, taking a wrong turn onto a one way street etc etc etc. you dont want to stay there because those extra 1-2 seconds could mean someone ramming you at high velocity. "
I don‚Äôt see any source for this claim
Nice
"No, at least from what I saw the tow guy do to my S 3 weeks ago.  HV battery went out and otherwise car operated (failed startup safety checks and threw up about 6-11 errors).  He calmly flicked on tow mode and the car started to roll forward within half a second.  He had the presence of mind to also jump in and hit the brakes as the car was going to roll into other parked cars."
"Maybe don't sit down, just lean in a enable Tow Mode?"
"You said that regenerative braking only engages at speed, then copied the section from outting your car in Neutral from the manual. Not sure what think you've accomplished, but you aren't showing that ""drive without the brake"" is the same as ""neutral"" which is exactly what I said."
"I've seen the exact same kind of thing before. The  voltmeter is polling hundreds (or more) times a second. If there is a millisecond current spike, the software will see it. Accelerating is a relatively smooth draw, while switching contractors/reversing polarity is fairly noisy. "
"When a battery is as low as his was, small surges in power draw greatly affect voltage. Again, this is a guess, but I've seen ev's surge very briefly when switching from forward to reverse, especiallywhen the motor controller has advanced TC and sensing features like a tesla. I'm not sure why, it just happens. Best guess is it has something to do with low rpm motor sensing+ rpm control.

I wish I had all the answers. All we know is that this is a direct result of the battery being well past its safe minimum. The car will (and should) do everything in its power to prevent long term damage. "
I'm assuming it's more like you have a couple drops left in the tank.
"Sorry, let me rephrase my whole premise: 

> Assuming that the ""emergency power mode"" or whatever everyone else is calling it was activated, the battery was dead. The plus side of it is that you could still move it~~get it into a flatbed without having to have it dragged~~. If you run out of gas in an ICE, you don't even have that.

"But a 2 ton vehicle climbing a curb somehow doesn't register.

Right..."
"Thanks I will, you just keep editing your replies. Air doesn‚Äôt exist either!"
"It registers, but noisy current draw affects voltage more. "
"Air is a little more extreme to deny than emergency car modes, but nobody can tell you otherwise successfully and you'll downvote people who try to explain how air works anyway.  No pressure, vacuum bro."
You're hard to have a conversation with while you're at work reposting goal posts.
"I don't buy that for a second.  Going over a curb is going to draw real current and meaningfully effect pack voltage.

Swapping contractors will be buffered by the capacitance of the battery.

You're not making any sense.  You're busy making excuses."
Maybe. I'm just trying to explain the reason from personal experience.

"Seems like BMW is the current king, exporting around \~280,000 vehicles from the [Spartanburg, SC](https://automotivelogistics.media/news/bmw-spartanburg-remains-top-us-car-exporter) plant. You would need take this picture x70 to reach that number."
"Nah, US exported 1.89M cars last year.  GM, Ford and BMW (Mfg in S.C.) were the top. Tesla has a way to go but the demand is there now "
"I wouldn't want Tesla to be a large exporter, I'd want to see them produced somewhere in Europe. It would be cheaper and allow faster distribution. That's what other manufacturers are doing."

"This transporter is the [GRAND VENUS](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:406871/mmsi:351034000/imo:9303211/vessel:GRAND_VENUS/) and it's booked route is: https://i.imgur.com/ffRoGWr.jpg

"Start of quarter you ship everything internationally so it arrives and gets delivered before the end of quarter. Near the end of quarter you deliver as close to home as possible so that there's absolutely as few as possible vehicles 'not delivered' as the clock rolls over to the next one.  

&#x200B;

It's pretty standard to how they run things."
"Unfulfilled high end demand in Europe, the European auto market is bigger, and there's still enough time to deliver these to customers in Q1. They'll start focusing on domestic deliveries in the next couple weeks as the end of the quarter approaches. "
"They are
Delivering locally too. My model 3 will be delivered one week after the order was made. "
Best way to stagger for q1 profits 
Short seller: Tesla is planning to dump unsold inventory in the ocean
They have moved their narrative from tesla unable to mass produce to not enough demand for what tesla os producing. I so badly want this company to succeed.
"Thats not the short thesis.

It's that Tesla can not make a 35k Model 3 and maintain gross margins, nor can they sell enough at a higher price to maintain profitability.
"
"Well, they can't keep up with their orders. And 4000 is really not that many."
Through the Panama Canal 
"North pole route? Is that a serious question? There are somethings called winter and sea ice in the way. Contrary to agore folklore, the Arctic sea ice remains in place, summer and especially in winter. "

Winter? 
Yes

Mine had 8. Also keep in mind there is testing. Up to 50 is considered new still
"Common for paperwork (at least in California) to say ""50 miles,"" even if (like in my case) the car had 14."
I work at a NA VW dealership and most German/American vehicles have between 5 and 30 kms on them when delivered from the truck.
Mine had 42
Common to have 50ish miles.

"The Swedish prices are actually pretty much the exact same as the US prices, except with 25 % Swedish VAT and the 10 % EU import taxes added. Don't blame Tesla, blame our European politicians."
"That's damn expensive. Tesla's are US imports in practical sense, they will be more affordable once Tesla has an EU factory."

"Although ‚ÄúAn Inconvenient Truth‚Äù had good intentions, it immediately turned climate change into a right vs left issue because of Al Gore‚Äôs involvement. 

That film was incredibly damaging. "
"Envious*

Also, I don't think many hate Tesla as a company. I think some dislike Musk, some of the practices by Tesla\Elon, and they believe the company is overvalued. There are valid criticisms of Tesla, it ain't all roses."
"You know why people don't like liberals? Because they lose. If liberals are so fucking smart, how come they lose so goddamn always?

e: guess I underestimated the amount of people who have seen HBOs[ The Newsroom](https://youtu.be/16K6m3Ua2nw)."
"In Ireland not really, companies like ford and General motors have European subsidiaries but they make cars that don't sell in the US anyways (the ford mondeo, Opel Astra). You can find some Mustangs or Camaros but they're usually sold with a 40-50% tax on the base price so they're extremely rare to find."
Nope - the US is associated with oversized cars with huge gas-guzzling engines.  The professional versions of those (Indycar?) are built *outside* of the US in the UK
Buick is very popular in China from what I've heard
"The Ford Fiesta was pretty popular for a bit. But the big auto companies have subsidiaries that sell cars specifically tailored to the European market since the tastes over there are different than the US. Ford, GM, etc are truly global companies."
2 billion in shorted stock owned by Americans hoping Tesla fails. All of the doubters who constantly criticize and marginalize the companies achievements. And the hardcore gas guzzlers that hate electric vehicles 
"They are smaller than ICE car companies, but easily the largest EV company in the world. The stock value comes from being an industry leader"
"Not so hard to believe when the first time I needed to use a Supercharger all of the chargers were blocked by a truck towing a RV trailer. I was just barely able to back up in front of the truck and get a charger meant for a forward parking spot to reach. After charging a while the guy and his family came out of a restaurant. He initially claimed there was nowhere else to park (which was ridiculous, the whole lot was open). I called him out on it and he admitted that he did it on purpose and I should buy a 'real' car. Surprise, he works at an oil field in Texas and you can bet he's never voted for a Democrat.

There are *definitely* conservatives who hate Teslas. I've met them personally more than once. Certainly not all conservatives--I was on a road trip, in part, to show my uncle my car and let him drive it, a super conservative guy who also works at an oil field."
I know people who think cordless tools are brilliant but irrationally think electric cars are dumb because something to do with environment which equals liberal or something. Meanwhile drive a big diesel and pollute the environment. That'll fix the lefties/s
"I have a conservative uncle, and I pointed out the success of Tesla to him and he like got sort of angry and proclaimed that ""the Tesla factory was a failure!""

Apparently he was talking about how the original GM plant failed, and liberals where to blame. I honestly don't even know how that was relevant to Tesla at all, and that is the point when I realized I don't care enough to find out."
Absurd that someone would think that or absurd that it's true? I've witnessed it first hand so it's true for sure.

"He also denies climate change though. Has pushed the world back many years in climate policies. Not only does it affect Americans, it affects all people. That's why Trump has lost a lot of respect in the international forums. 

I mean if you think you have some special knowledge about the climate that is contrary to what 180+ nations believe and act on, you deserve no respect. Politics should not supersede humanity."
"Your comment could've been copied and posted from 5 years ago when they barely could bring one car to market, now you're commenting on a picture of them shipping thousands across the ocean. Doubt is the opposite of support and this company has done nothing but good for America, it's economy, our citizens, and the world. It deserves praise and support from our government and people, not roadblocks."
">	Begun the EV war has...

Statements like this always make me pause."
You would spark public outrage if you put nuclear on non-military vessels.
"Wouldnt be the first time.. i would tick the yes please insure these cars option... (I did insure my container when I shipped one..)
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2576179.stm"
"Supposedly they have $3B worth of inventory, so this picture is less than 10%. I could see how a risk tolerant agent might choose to skip insurance."
[removed]
But then you would need to containerize Model 3s which would be a pain in the ass. Ro-ro ships are better suited to vehicle transport.
[removed]
"If Tesla hits their goal of 500,000 vehicles in 2019 that Musk tweeted and over 50% of them are exported due to pent up demand abroad for the Model 3, they'd be right there with BMW. They may not hit 500k this year, but that doesn't seem like some crazy unobtainable number."
Holy shit this is cool to see
It is currently not the start of quarter. 
"It's kind of a shame they have to do it this way just to show good numbers.

If these 4k cars don't make it for some reason, or whatever their last batch is they expect to make it, they'll probably miss their targets and people will yell as loud as they can that Tesla is failing and going to die.

Meanwhile, all these people end up getting their cars in the first week of April, and nothing has actually changed at all.

So what if they misjudged oversea shipping times by a short amount.
"
Ahh I see 
"That argument is so mind boggling stupid- if we follow short logic for a second, Tesla secretly produces a to of cars, moves them (secretly) out of sight to (secretly) dump them in the ocean. There is no scenario in which any of this would ever be remotely rational- even if you allege fraud. "
"I mean Tesla fans have done the same with other EVs. First it was ""oh they just make concepts and don't produce anything"" and ""they don't want to sell EVs"". And now it's ""oh they suck and don't get the same range"" or ""that marketing is stupid""."
"Copy, didnt know which would be quicker. "
"Yes it was a serious question. I know the Canal is a main route, but was wondering if there are alternatives. Say the water clears up, would that ever be a viable shipping route? Around Alaska, over Canada, and down to Europe from the north? What about in a few decades when stuff has receded even further? I know It will create a more direct line from Russia to Canada, no? 

I know it sounds stupid, but I also dont underestimate technology and the drive for progress and cheaper options. I don't know anything about shipping and was wondering if that was a viable alternative, especially given rising temps. "
"Yooooo this is Awesome!! I've been using Flight Radar 24 for the past year or so, I think its so cool to see whats overhead and where its going. I just moved to Long Beach, CA, one of the biggest ports in the country. There was 11+ tankers on the horizon today, now I can nerd out over them too! Thanks!"
"Hey, I don't know what kind of ships we have these days. Idk what kind of routes they take, or what can impede their movements. Just asking. I wasn't sure if the Canal was the only option. "
"Not quite. Glovis Captain to Zeebrugge took 24 days, Glovis Cosmos 23."
That‚Äôs actually way faster than I would have thought! 
"Roros don't go nearly as fast as container ships. Closer to half the top speed, about 10 kts or so"
"Tesla, the universe, and everything. "
"42.0, Elon is a master troll"
Mine had 17km when delivered in Norway. 
"The Bonus Malus system gives you a 60k SEK discount on new cars, so a 600k SEK new car is actually 10k SEK cheaper than a 550k SEK used car."
Which is still an *insane* price.
"I don't blame the EU politicians at all, as I'm comparing against other car brands, both foreign and domestic.

This is 100% a Tesla problem."
we dont need american GPS we have EU galileo now. and i agree we shouldnt be using any of these american products and should have EU alternatives.

San diego checking in
"Not in a part of the country where they're ""everywhere"". Is it still cool to see them driving around?  "
"Until now?

Where do they go now?"
https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-tesla-tracker/
Companies like Toyota produce many more vehicles / day. Tesla should be able to scale :)
Possibly? The stock price is I think pretty insane. It's the same level as 2 years ago. 
Convertible bond maturity in the end of March. 
"Stock price has to do with a lot more than production. You can make a shit load of something and not make any money. It's also forward looking, so market participants are focusing on demand and whether the profit margin can be maintained as they move to produce lower priced models."
Because it was supposed to be higher according to Elon. He has been a serial overpromiser but I don‚Äôt fault him too much. If he never aimed high he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten so far.
"S... so they max at 35k/week? Wow they are really ahead of schedule! /s  

&#x200B;

They have been averaging right around the 5k a week mark meaning that they have to be able to burst higher then that. There has been widely reported 8k/week burst recently which is what he was referencing. That burst rate is absolute bullshit from the way the tracker works but logic states to average 5k a week you have to be able to burst more then that to account for downtime. 6-7k burst rate is pretty reasonable to expect."
"I hear you, and yes: I was painting with a broad brush with regards to WSJ. 

That having been said, I don‚Äôt think they have ever editorially come out celebrating the success of Tesla as a US manufacturing and innovation success story. To me, Tesla stands out as an amazing‚Äîand surprising, and fascinating‚Äîsuccess story. 

I‚Äôm also influenced by local media in California, where Tesla is also based. To hear two TV news producers at a local party shake their head and laugh that Tesla is close to closing, and delightedly covering individual car fires as if they were serious news has given me perspective on what Big News has to do get people‚Äôs‚Äô attention these days.

It‚Äôs easy (and more heartening) to believe that what they choose to cover is unbiased, until they cover something you know a lot about. Out of billions of things happening each day, they will always focus on the fear, uncertainty, and doubt of a situation as a service to help promote ‚Äúpublic safety concerns and awareness.‚Äù

They would be embarrassed to say something good about Tesla if a problem cropped up later. However, if a cautionary concern later ends up having no basis in fact, they can always say ‚Äúwe erred on the side of caution.‚Äù

I get the value of controversy to get attention, but it‚Äôs turning into a sadness machine. And it‚Äôs ruining their reputation steadily over time. 

We have come a long way from Walter Cronkite. 

IMHO. "
Good points but they definitely a negative bias and increasing tendency to go towards poorly researched ‚Äòclickbait‚Äô type articles. The WSJ is far from the worst though. **Cough CNBC
Buzzfeed News is more hard-hitting than WSJ these days. 
Can you not use capital letters 
"WSJ  does not equate to all of journalism. Buzzfeed does not rely on WSJ. Just as Fox can generate views with massive disinformation so can WSJ have similar readership. 

So glad that jpbeans is thinking of ditching  the subscription. It does not cover Tesla fairly. "
"Also advertising.  Every five minutes on TV, big dumb pickup trucks bounce over boulders, enough to buy all these ""journalists"".  Tesla spends zero (aside from providing free sporters to genuinely entertaining EV vloggers).  Now You Know is one of my favs."
"I believe it's not some cabal or conspiracy, it's just journalists trying to get viewers and not piss off advertisers. No one tunes in for good news, and Tesla doesn't advertise, while trad automakers advertise constantly. Also, sprinkle in a little natural shadenfreude on the part of poorly paid journalists with ZERO sympathy for ""billionaire Elon Musk"" and ""wealthy Tesla owners."""
"This. Musk is new money, tech money entering an industry full of old money with ties to all the old money giants. He‚Äôs also disrupting the status quo while competing with super old companies. Just think of how much so many old money companies stand to lose if he‚Äôs successful, GM, Ford, Chrysler etc, and all the oil barons as well. They are friends with the moguls that own the press they advertise and do business with these giants so naturally they are attacking him. "
They will just say they are having to ship to Europe as there is no demand in the US. 
"i couldn't agree more. It makes me wonder WTF is wrong with your country. 

Politics elsewhere aren't as divided. "
"to be fair, [hosting the Olympics isn‚Äôt usually considered a winning financial decision](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2014/08/10/magazine/does-hosting-the-olympics-actually-pay-off.amp.html)"
"Basically everyone in Boston was against our bid. Except the mayor and his rich cronies.   


Not a great way to make your point. "
I'm open to contrarian views most of the time. But denying climate change is incredibly stupid. You are denying what most of the rest of the WORLD holds true. I can understand disbelieving political opposites. But denying something that more than 150 countries are actively working together to combat is narrow-minded minded and sad.
"I guess we should start the nuke war and call it a day right?  Who needs renewable energy, factories aren't clean right?  no one need to try and destroy earth any less."

"Have you seen the education levels in the red states?  They're under-educated, under-informed and they have nothing better to do than marry out of high school and start popping out more of them.  Most smart people move AWAY from those places to cities.  Cities tend to be more-liberal because.

a - most high-paying jobs for smart people are in cities.

b - you tend to get a more open view of the world when you're surrounded 
     by people of different ethnicities and backgrounds.

c- As has been proven in quite a few red states, republicans steal elections and are caught up in massive voter suppression and voter fraud scandals.  Even Mitch McTurtle himself thinks allowing people to vote is bad because he knows that if people can vote they will get rid of the GOP.

I'm not trying to convince you.  Members of cults are hard to educate.

"> In Ireland not really, companies like ford and General motors have European subsidiaries but they make cars that don't sell in the US anyways (the ford mondeo, Opel Astra).

The Mondeo is sold in the US as the Ford Fusion and is a fairly popular sedan.  I believe the Astra is currently sold in sedan form in the US as the Buick Verano, though I don't believe it's as big a seller."
"Just because you think a company is overvalued doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre against the company. The shorts have a valid point. Tesla‚Äôs stock is priced for perfection, that‚Äôs why any bump sends it plummeting. Never invest with your heart.

The doubters have been right to doubt about some things, no? Tesla makes a great product but they‚Äôve never been known for being on time.

I‚Äôm sure the gas guzzlers exist but they‚Äôre probably trucker bros with tiny dicks. I wouldn‚Äôt lose any sleep over them."
"Good grief. Stick trades are not a political statement. I think Tesla is way overvalued as well, and I also think their cars are cool."
"I wish Tesla all the luck in the world, but shorting them will probably make you money, which is why people are shorting them"
"Shorting doesn't mean you hate the company or what it's doing, it just means you think it's overpriced. There is a difference. 

>And the hardcore gas guzzlers that hate electric vehicles

How many of  those people have you met, honestly?

We've taken our 3 to a shit load of auto events and cars and coffees and never heard a bad thing about it. Some will say they still prefer gasser cars, but they didn't say Tesla was stupid. These are ""hardcore gas guzzler"" type events. I'm sure some people hate EVs, but they are not that common. Certainly no more than some people in here who hate gas cars."
"I can see a growth argument, but just because you are an industry leader in a technology doesn't automatically give you a $50b+ valuation. That is why it get's shorted. Tesla is an interesting stock."
"I own a Model 3 and I'm a petroleum engineer in the oil industry.

I've never met someone who isn't interested in the car.

Correction: I've met a handful, but these people were inconsequential: roughnecks and mechanics in the oilfield, not white collar. Useless people who we only use for human labor. The oilfield will be fully automated in 15-20 years and I can't wait foe the day where I only jave to deal with other engineers, finance people, and technicians."
"Here in the UK conservatives are just as ""green"" or greener than everyone else.

"A ""car equivalent unit"" is based on a Toyota Corona from the sixties. That car is about 4x1.5m, compared to a Model 3s 4.7x2m.

3/Corona=1.5666"
"It's still fairly common to containerize cars (this is how it's done for a lot of individuals shipping their cars, freshly manufactured batches are done with roros) and I'm just saying it's absolutely possible to fit >20,000 on one ship."
The longshoremans union would never allow that.  I've delivered cars to Long Beach port before.  Teams of yellowjackets drive them on and off all day long.  Bet the drivers are grateful that bluetoothed car stereos are pretty much standard now.
Was it 500k or 500k run rate?  I thought it was run rate based on the China factory doing 3000/week by Dec 31st?
"If you were a west coast BMW fan, and took up their option to personally collect your new car in Munich and drive it around for 2 weeks, then you'd be aware of this website/route - the new owners would be eagerly tracking their 'new' car being slowly shipped to them from Europe.

Edit: also this shows how the southern part of the Panama canal is further *west* than the northern part."
"My understanding was these were still intended to be delivered before the end of the quarter but looking at my calendar I may be... a week or two behind the times.  

&#x200B;

The fact they are shipping so many though would lead me to believe they still intend to get them delivered in time though (seems tight)"

"Container ship travel about 24 knots, RoRo ships about 16-18 knots."
"Mine had 63,239km.

Then it was definitely not new. No way a car should be getting delivered with more than 150km
"Fair enough, if that's the comparison you're making then you're right.

For the future though, if you have an American car and want to know roughly how much it will cost in Sweden, first convert to SEK (currently that means multiply by 9) and then multiply by 1.35 to add VAT and import tax. For an EV, you can then subtract 60k SEK in Bonus malus.

So if the Model 3 SR ever actually materialises, it should cost around 365k SEK."

"Agree with your point about it being rigged to favor low population states, but calling a delta of ~3 million votes a ""landslide"" in an election where 235 million people were eligible to vote is a bit of a stretch.

"You probably already have seen it, Elon followed up with run rate. "
"Yes, but it also represents about $200 million in lost revenue if it's delayed. That is more than Q4 profit. That means if a ship is delayed, they will go from potential profit to almost certain GAAP loss."
"Probably because ""Whoosh""? "
It's that they are never happy. Once they build a car it's not good enough. And if it was good enough it wouldn't have the supercharger network. And if charging was covered they would say it doesn't have OTA updates and so on.

"TSLA has a bond maturing in March. Maturing meaning it will be paid off. It is a convertible bond meaning that the bond can be paid off with stock. The stock price threshold for paying with stock is $360 meaning that if the stock price is $360 or more by the end of March (the maturity date) then payoff is with stock. If below $360, they they must use their cash reserves on hand. Some people are speculating that the stock price is being kept artificially low to force TSLA to payoff the bond using their cash instead of issuing more stock. Hope I explained it clearly. "
"Right but he referenced burst production, not sustained."
Thanks
"Tesla‚Äôs P/E is high because investors expect the E part to be impressive in the future, and they want in. Maybe they missed getting in on Amazon or Facebook early enough, and they want in on TSLA now. 

The world is awash in capital dying to be put into a growth story. With Tesla building and filling giant factories and pumping out products people are thrilled about, is there a better growth story anywhere?"
"You expect big things. The reality is that it already is a big thing. A really really big thing.  

Nothing makes this more vivid than the OP's picture of the thousands of American  cars heading for  the European  shores. 

So, the share value is high.

"Huh? I‚Äôm baffled how you could objectively look at the facts and see it as anything other than a colossal success. The very fact that u use the word ‚Äòcolossal‚Äô for what a few years ago was a tiny start up aiming to produce like 500 cars in a year destroys your argument before you even begin.

"Like the Bolt (which is cheaper)? That didn‚Äôt even make a dent. 

Jag is struggling to sell many I-PACEs already. I drove it on streets and a slalom course. It‚Äôs just a more expensive E-PACE. They would do really well to sell 10K of those in the US. 

Audi will do better, but neither will do remotely as well as Model 3 did even LAST year. "
Jaguar? It seems someone is not aware what's going on with their financials. 
Yeah it's obvious they are selling higher margin cars first. It makes sense.

Why would someone want them to pay with cash versus stock?
"You're right on the price, but most people fail to realize that the stock price needs to be at $360 a share for more than 20 days prior to the due date. So either way it's not likely to make that in time. The payout is more or less already priced into the stock due to the money being on hand and easily affordable to Tesla but I still expect a little bit of a drop when the payout reaches the 20 day deadline and a lot of doom and gloom articles when that happens. Tesla may very well start displaying new products(Model Y?) as that happens to help float the stock price at this point."
Could you explain how the price can be kept low? I'm curious.
"The I-Pace is direct competition with the Model X. When They release their sedan line, along with Porsche, the model 3 won‚Äôt hold a finger.

Im just saying that the honeymoon phase with Tesla is over. People are finally realizing how terrible of an investment the vehicle is, and they will jump ship. And this isn‚Äôt just some bullshit ‚ÄúI drove it, it‚Äôs just a more expensive whatever.‚Äù 

We‚Äôre talking no standing inventory for parts (still 3-4 week eta on parts with a decent amount of parts still on indefinite back order), parts are delivered via large freighting companies in large batches without rhyme or reason to pack method which leads to damaged, unusable parts, body shops now refusing to fix the vehicles after wrecks, insurance companies refusing to insure drivers with Teslas, outside of warranty defects that occur due to faulty equipment that must be laid for out of pocket (lookin at you model S ‚Äúfailed to present‚Äù fault). Vehicles shipped with such insufficient paint work, the paint chips before delivery to the customer. Vehicles kept in large outside storage or staging areas and leaving them vulnerable to various forms of tarnish (bird shit, acidic, gotta strip paint and treat then repaint. Rail dust. Good luck. Better hope it buffs out.) Inconsistency with gaps in body panels. Broken seals on doors and mirrors. Scratched chrome. Having to get in your vehicle with a promise to pay a body shop to fix your car because it came in with damage due to transport issues. Right now, there is an entire PDC without a fucking logistics solution to alleviate parts order backlog. Lmfao.

Imagine what it would do to an already underproducing company to have to deal with mass cancelled orders in the middle of production.

I mean, sure, some people are happy to have their cars as they upgraded from an 08 Camry and like their new toy. They are fun to drive. But Tesla is not even remotely close to a success story.

"
Cowards.
Drawing Elvis and the Beatles to the billion dollar social media industries is a wild false equivalency. We communicate and learn extremely differently today with the internet. The idea that what we‚Äôre going through today is remotely close to what they went through in the 50s and 60s is laughable. The funny thing is with the Beatles and Elvis those cultural accusations were pointed at the youth when in fact today I think the problem is worse with the older generation who have adopted this tech much later in life. 
the only one i heard/read.
2019 - 2016 = 3. Blocked. i bet you reply anyway lmao
Ok. Tesla is still the most shorted stock of all time tho. Wall Street is only one part of this though. Politically why isn't there more support for Tesla?
"No mother will abort a child near birth term unless there's something terribly wrong. It's extremely risky for the mother as well and is only opted in death-risk cases where otherwise both mom and child might have permanent damage or death.

  


I respect pro-choice views, but you have to be a little objective about it. Democrats/pro-choice people don't take pleasure in killing unborn children. But at a point in a human's life, which can be very challenging, do we prioritize the mom life (a full grown woman who is a part of society) or an unborn child? Me, as a man, cannot fathom the pain of a woman who is faced with this scenario. What do I do? Do I force my views on her? Or do I let her take that call?

  


If a woman is pro-choice she will choose accordingly and we respect that. But if a woman is faced with this horrible decisions where a birth might irreparably damage her life, what right do I have to stop her? It is fair to let her make that call and support her through whatever means necessary. No woman opts for an abortion out of pleasure or casualness. It's painful, hard, traumatic but for that woman, the lesser of the two evils."
So new EVs are negative?
Copy. 
"People unfortunately want them to fail. My uncle keeps sending me the worst of the worst news about Tesla any time some hit piece comes out. He‚Äôs shorting them because of the garbage he heard on CNBC. His investments always fail too, so there‚Äôs that. 

1st the S wouldn‚Äôt come out, then the X wouldn‚Äôt come out, then the 3 wouldn‚Äôt come out. Great investor. "
Maybe the contract states it. 
"Reduce the cash reserves. Without cash, TSLA can‚Äôt fuel their operations and expansion. Luckily even if they have to payout the bonds in cash, they have enough on hand to cover. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but the have close to $4B on hand and the bond payment is approx $1B. "

Don‚Äôt feed the troll folks. 
"Wow. Such a troll. I don't even...

"Mueller investigation started May of 2017, 21 months ago, there are 36 months in 3 years."
"Tesla is a $50b car company that makes no profit. It is normal to have financial skeptics if your company makes literally no profit.

Politically, Nevada gave $1.3B in tax incentives for the gigafactory. We never heard any bad press about that. Amazon just got trashed for getting a similar incentive package. Musk was on the President‚Äôs business council until he left for ideological reasons. The Fed‚Äôs have been giving electric car tax incentives for years.  

Tesla has plenty of political support. I really don‚Äôt understand this victim mentality here. There is no big conspiracy against Tesla."
[deleted]
So they would rather them lose the billion than had to issue new stock?
"Even if Tesla fails, electric cars will be dominating the market in less than ten years."
"Not to mention Tesla can raise capital if it wants. I'm pretty sure Elon just doesn't want to dilute his ownership percentage below 20%, which is why he's been so reluctant to do that. But they very easily could decide that they want to raise several billion and jump start a variety of initiatives."
"It looks like there are a lot of broad brush strokes here... and I can‚Äôt speak from the perspective of the model 3. But as a current owner of a Model X and someone who has historically owned ‚Äúluxury‚Äù cars (BMW and Land Rover in the same price range or more than the X) I agree that Tesla is failing. I would not say it is a colossal failure and I believe these are growing pains that will work out. But I also believe it‚Äôs a bit too optimistic to rave about how amazing Tesla is.  

There are so many bad stories here and other forums about both pre and post sale support.  Yes the forums are the internet version of the bathroom stall wall and highlights the negatives. But the problems are often consistent and show a trend in the issues. In the upper price range that the X and S play, Tesla is not a nice car compared to the competition. The fit and finish is cheap and what gets dismissed as quirks just don‚Äôt exist in comparably priced ‚Äòcompetitors.‚Äô

Just this last week I told our service center I was tired of taking in our X for service and it‚Äôs only three months old. I highlighted that it‚Äôs an overpriced piece of crap at this point and buying the startup car to help drive the future technology has worn out its welcome. Features are neat and yay my car can fart but it‚Äôs now more of a party topic than a trustworthy vehicle. Every time my wife drives it she wonders if she‚Äôs going to have a problem. Yay I paid $97k for this!!  

So now I actively advise people not buy a Tesla unless they are willing to accept the uncertainty and headaches that go along with it. 

Funny thing, and not so funny at the same time, if they‚Äôd properly staff their customer service numbers, not take weeks or month or more to respond to simple issues, and have an actual escalation chain with management that has authority to do things, much of my frustration would be absent and I‚Äôd give them more latitude when my car farts instead of reliably opening doors or shuts off while sitting at a stop light. 

TL;DR:  this thread swings a bit too much between troll and fanboy. Tesla is doing great things for the industry but it‚Äôs a far cry from a raging success. It would be a nice change if people have these discussions with a bit of objectivity and recognize the good and the bad of the company. 

"
"They are currently profitable and could've been years ago if not for aggressive growth. They paid back the loan for the gigafactory early, with interest. Amazon is getting trashed for not paying taxes. Musk left because Trump wasn't listening to his advice. The feds are working to eliminate the tax credit and create an EV tax. 

There is a strong narrative against EVs in our country and a strong opposition to Tesla's success. Our president has never given support to Tesla and continues to push coal and oil"
"Amazon is one of the biggest and richest companies in the world and they don't do jack for the betterment of mankind though :) Even asking for incentives (whether or not bound to specific employment goals like Tesla) is morally wrong in my view. Its like a rich movie star asking for a discount on specific clothes because other people will buy them too. I get why it might make sense, but not if you are insanely rich and especially not if you behave like Amazon often does."

"1. If what you are saying happens, then how is banning abortion a solution? Rather we should strengthen laws to ensure that corner cases where the system is abused are rectified. The same way when someone gets shot, we don't call to ban guns but ensure that guns are lawfully fired and miscreants punished.

  


2. Your claim that PP aims push abortion so they can sell more body parts is pure filth. You should not believe the heavily edited videos which present the case as if PP has a burgeoning business selling fetal parts to bidders.

  


3. Your claim that Democrats get behind this for some reason is just propoganda. Just for a moment think about it. There's a party X which due to their beliefs and policies ends up majorly being constituted by older males of a particular race. Then there's a party Y which mostly welcomes diverse participants from across races and genders. Logic would dictate that Y would have much more thought behind supporting policies that help women and people across the board. "
"I hear you, that's reasonable.

How one feels about Tesla depends on a lot of things like that. If I had been dragged through service problems, I'd feel differently. I've been fortunate there. As have most owners, right?

It also helps that I'm more interested in the software in the car than the upholstery or panel gaps (don't really care, and I bought a black one, so there ARE NO panel gaps, if you get what I mean). 

And if I was someone who really valued luxury, I might feel differently. I'm just SO glad that there's an automaker that isn't still relying on quirky lashed-together dash electronics from Delco and LG. Such a breath of fresh air to have a modern software UI in a car. So nice.

You're right about the fanaticism both ways. Hyperbole and hysteria are all the rage these days."

"We‚Äôre both right. I don‚Äôt know what the short ratio is right now but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs gone down since a profit started getting made in the last 6 months.

Just so you know, $139M in profit for a $50B company is still terrible. They need to get a lot more profitable to justify that valuation which is why the shorts still exist. 

My profession is finance. Our industry requires that you are unemotional about your investments. The shorts exist because Tesla has a questionable balance sheet and income statement. It‚Äôs not because they hate the company on ideological grounds."

I mean they do the inverse in that they will spread fake news meant to inflate the stock price.  Neither strategy works well unless they are trading with insider info because of market efficiencies.

Just look at Tesla articles on Seeking Alpha. There are countless pieces trying to hype the stock based on dubious claims. Just like there are countless articles predicting it will fall off the cliff without much evidence.
"As a Canadian, I love that Tesla is using a Canadian company, allowed them to remain there, and invested into their location in Halifax, NS. Halifax is a great city! "

Maybe when these come out Fred will complain and get a replacement pack.
"All of the results here are based on NMC532 and NMC622 cathodes, which makes sense given Jeff Dahn's previous work. This is much more applicable to powerwall/powerpack (maybe maybe the truck.. though that still has high energy density requirement that these would struggle to meet) than Tesla cars"

Does this mean my model 3 is already out dated??...  gosh.
"Came for the new battery tech info, stayed for the Electrek drama."
I wish Tesla would put out AA and AAA rechargeables. 
"This is excellent news! I was starting to worry that Dahn's team was stuck.

I'm expecting something on the order of a 5% cost reduction, 25% quicker charge, and 40% longevity improvement.

I can't wait to see the specs!"
r/vaping just got a boner. 
Awesome! What's the mAh and voltage of these bad boys? Looks like an 18650... I would love to have a couple!
I want some Tesla AA batteries
Have the short twisted this into a negative yet?
Any someone provide any insight into whether the creation of a low cost battery would eventually bring the price down for a let‚Äôs say a model 3?
"Nice! Hope this tech makes it to Model Y. Faster charge is awesome and longevity is also a plus.

Faster discharging? That doesn‚Äôt sound right...
Wish I could buy those Tesla 18650s.  Would swap out crappy Chinese ones in some battery packs I have sitting around.
"Been thinking about this for some time and I'm starting to think I've been wrong about government subsidies on clean energy.  I was about to make a comment on how tesla is awesome because they use technology instead of government policy to increase clean energy, but it's only possible because of the government's policies.  they lost a lot of money, but its paying off now."
/u/Iinex is this your ceramic cell?
"I love it when the article says:

""Here are a few drawings from Tesla‚Äôs newly published patent application:""

And goes on to show all the different graphs.

Drawings. Lol"
And I just got a email saying my Tesla x 75d is about to arrive Tianjin port. 
Now we wait for Elon to tweet how much better. 
watch the bloody madlad Elon Musk just release the patent on the compounds & shit inside the battery
But can I use it in Amy vape
Can‚Äôt wait for the $10k price increase.
"Jeff Dahn is the best.  I can attest to that.

I had the pleasure of working with Jeff during his mentioned 'research agreement with 3M'.  He is incredibly knowledgeable, kind, inspiring, and the the reason I left industry to go back and complete my PhD."
"Yes, more tech investment in The Maritimes, please!"
"It's been six years since I sailed away, and I just made Halifax yesterday "
I‚Äôm sure Halifax is as wonderful as you have described. Unfortunately my knowledge of Halifax is limited to the content of this low budget youtube montage I saw years ago and had forgotten about until reading your comment.  I actually can‚Äôt believe I found it.  I apologize in advance. [Halifax](https://youtu.be/oz88kJSdT6Y) 
"It's great that they're doing it, but there are also significant tax credits to doing this sort of work in Canada (SR&ED program)."
I love Halifax.
Now if only they could open up a service centre and store for Halifax
"my inlaws live there, I wonder if they have a lab you can visit, would be worth the venture to just see cool stuff at the bleeding edge of tech."
Well apart from inventing the fax machine what else is Halifax known for ?
They are using a canadian company for their batterys? Witch company is it?
Dude Halifax waterfront is pretty unrivaled 
Did not know it was based in Halifax! Awesome! 
Watched a video on you tube. I was fascinated at the batteries in ancient Egypt. I was hard core obsessed in year 8
It‚Äôs not because they care about Halifax or Canada. It‚Äôs because of the tax credits.
My first thought also - that potentially could keep 18650 still for high performance (can output more Amps) but will be ready for Supercharger v3. That would be nice actually...
"Cell composition design isn‚Äôt just for the performance of the cell but also for the form factor. Different form factors have different thermal properties and then layer in cell, module and pack design all of which can be tuned to the cell composition.

This is what makes third parties lives much harder because they lack a fast feedback loop"
I am pretty sure it is. It would make a lot of sense to skip the current model 3 battery version for a more advanced one
"> Just to make sure some corrupt company doesn‚Äôt patent them first?

Yes."
"To stop being sued for infringing others patents. Patents are used like nukes, as a means of defence, sue us and we sue you and we both loose. 

I'm sure tesla has infringed on minor patents from Toyota or BMW etc, but they will not sue tesla  because they wi be using tesla patents themselves "
"Because, last I looked, Tesla‚Äôs patents are not 100% open. Using them explicitly limits the other company from suing Tesla for a variety of reasons and grants Tesla certain rights.

None of this is possible, without the patent in place first. "
It's called a protective patent.  To allow you to use develop tech. and not worry about being blocked by a patent troll.
"In Tesla‚Äôs case they explicitly stated it‚Äôs in order to allow others to use these patents to advance the electric technology industry. Not being sued or being prevented from using these technologies are just a bonus.

See: [All Our Patent Are Belong To You](https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you)"
"They are released with conditions, they need the patent to protect those terms and conditions

In the same way people that open source their code still hang onto the copyright"
"There‚Äôs a lot of misconceptions about Tesla‚Äôs patent program. And most of the comments on this reasonable question just further muddy the waters.

The lowdown:
Tesla *has not* open sourced or waived their patent rights. That was a highly disingenuous description by Elon. What they‚Äôve done instead is created a license which allows a given Firm to use Tesla patents without paying royalties *in exchange* for Tesla getting to use the firm‚Äôs patents without paying royalties.

This deal does not make sense or have any appeal to legacy car companies for good reason. BMW doesn‚Äôt want Tesla to get all their patents without paying licensing fees. 
"
Why would that be corrupt?
What? That's how patents work. Am I taking crazy pills?
"It solidifies them as an acquisition target. Even if they plan to stay Tesla, they‚Äôre building themselves out to be unbelievably valuable if things don‚Äôt work out. Especially with factory in China. It gives them a ton of confidence to take risks. "
"That's not how patent law works.

Another company cannot patent something if it is in the public domain.  Getting it into the public domain is easy including disclosing the details in a news article, website, conference, etc...essentially someplace that can be documented that it was told to people not under a confidentiality agreement.

Tesla has that option of public disclosure but they choose to patent it because they want to trade patent licenses as well as have the option of pulling them back to block competitors if necessary."
[deleted]
"Elon patents new battery techs and then deletes them. (I wouldn't normally reference an Elon/Fortnite meme on r/teslamotors , but considering he's angling to host Meme Review.. perhaps it's a public service under the circumstances)

Edit: It's just a joke. Reference - ""Elon Musk buys Fortnite and deletes it"": [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1053390822991790083](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1053390822991790083)"
You can publicly disclose things cheaper and easier than patenting something.  Patent's are a bit of a scorecard for engineering is the only explanation I can come up with.
"Sure, just open them up and pour it into an AA battery"
"Yes actually. AA just says that you should submit yourself to a higher power, but doesn't say what that power is, so it could be a battery."
Actually though. A neat charger and some Tesla rechargeables would go a long way into reducing battery waste. 
He'd find a way to heat it again
"This appears to be changing the recipe of the meatloaf to make it slightly better. What Panasonic is trying to do is invent a new dish that resembles the existing meatloaf but is way tastier.

Considering how Tesla is making very iterative improvements to batteries to get that cost per KW/H down, this will potentially end up in the cars in very short order."
evidently Panasonic and Ionic Materials are making more progress which should yield batteries in the next 2 - 3 years. They just took down IQLP which takes care of the big hurdle getting to mass manufacturing. 
"This year. He mentioned battery changes were coming, not seven months ago."
"There are Jeff Dahn video presentations on this basically it is the stability of the battery at particular voltages and temp ranges. They aim to prevent gases forming, which improves the stability, hence longevity.
In particular for energy storage NMC the aim was improved longevity, my impression was they doubled the longevity to 20 years, but have been up to  now very secretive except for when Jeff initially said a bit too much.
I was never sure if this was applicable to vehicle batteries  but I am not surprised that it is."
"Typing the article and tweet from inside the Roadster. /s

"This is stupid. You make it sound like my issue with Tesla was simply that they reduced the price as if I would have an issue with them introducing improvements, like a new battery.

My issue was that Tesla took reservations from people waiting for the performance Model 3 for years and then two months after finally delivering those cars to reservation holders, they saw that they couldn't sell the cars to non-reservation holders for the same price so they slashed the price by $5,000 - basically charging a premium to reservation holders.

Virtually, 99% of Model 3 Performance owners agree that it was a shitty thing to do. I was at Tesla Corsa just last week, where they were tons of Model 3 Performance owners, and everyone I talked to were grateful for me pointing out that it was a bad thing to do. 

Even Elon agreed that it wasn't right. 

Yet, rabid Tesla fans still make it sound like I was just complaining to complain. So dumb."
"Makes total sense. The Powerwall is still in a tight spot with regards to cost and durability. Increasing both would make a much more significant contribution to their commercial success than the difference it would make to cars. For cars, we need higher energy density (without increasing cost) more than anything."
"I  initially thought the same thing and I  am sure that was the main reason why they got Dahn involved in the first place.

But Dahn made a brief mention of a car battery that lasts 20 years, possibly that was aimed at the semi.

If they are 4.4v NMC, does the higher voltage help mobile applications?"
I hope that the speculation on the forums that current model 3s will still be compatible with the next level of supercharging holds to be true. 
"When we bought our X, the autopilot 2.0 suite came out a month later. The X had JUST came out too... Sucks but it happens. "
>So Tesla released its battery R&D to the world? Is that what this is all about?
Panasonic eneloops are what you need to be buying. I‚Äôve never had one go bad and have been using them for years. 
Just get eneloops and a quality charger. They are insanely good.
Why do you expect those numbers?
Tesla doesn't make battery cells
"I'll help them out with a suggestion..

""Tesla's battery tech may soon be obsolete"" üòâ"
"If not it will probably be something like this-
Tesla steals idea from someone else, can‚Äôt implement it correctly, on time or at scale, and Elon is a fraud. Did I do that right?

Those shorts have some bat shit crazy ideas. Blows my mind when I read some of them. üòÇ "
The $35k base price of the Model 3 had future cost improvement baked in. I don't think we can expect the base price of the Model 3 to go below $35k in the next 3-4 years.
Dunno why people are downvoting you.  50% of rated range during winter is realistic.
Do you actually prefer the google amp links?
"Thanks, I prefer not to give him clicks."
Doubt it. This patent is 2 years old.

"Faster discharging probably means it can put out more power than current cells, which should mean they can enable faster acceleration/speed since they can supply more power more quickly to the motors. I‚Äôve read that one of the reasons why Tesla may not want to use the 2170 cells for the S and X is that they aren‚Äôt able to match the discharge rate of the older cells, which would reduce the rate of acceleration possible for the S and X unless they radically increased the pack volume to accommodate sufficient cells to make up the difference. "

"Actually, others may end up not using the patents. Doesn't the patent license say that any use or tech innovation stemming from a Tesla patent must be released back to Tesla? (or something like that?) (basically a common open source license). 

It's likely to help smaller companies get off the ground - but larger companies will likely still try to develop something proprietary for the sake of it. 

On the other hand, I think they want to make battery technology ubiquitous to lower costs and have everyone create a supply/demand cost advantage with the same raw materials. "
"But didn‚Äôt Tesla say that anyone is free to use their patents? So I don‚Äôt see how Tesla could sue. And China will steal everything regardless. 

Anyways, I agree. Companies even buy up giant batches of patents just as insurance against lawsuits to make sure that they have multiple things that their competitors are infringing.  I wish we could change patent laws, it would help lower medicine costs and increase the rate of adaption of new technologies. But it would also lower the incentives to invent :( "
"How would this protect you from an independent patent troll? If someone bought multiple patents and found you infringing a few they could still sue you, assuming they‚Äôre not using one of yours. "
No it‚Äôs not corrupt. He‚Äôs doing it to stop some other company from making the patent and sitting on it for 20 years. Because that means two decades with less people using the technology 
"Yeah kind of. If you have a patent it‚Äôs publicly searchable, and then you have to pay for lawsuits to enforce your patent. Tesla said they won‚Äôt sue anyone if they are using it in good faith, meaning that they don‚Äôt sue Tesla or any other EV company"
"That‚Äôs not true. If you make a public disclosure right now, I could patent it. That‚Äôs why I filed before I made a public disclosure with my last invention. 

From Wikipedia- ‚ÄúThe America Invents Act signed on 16 September 2011, switched U.S. right to the patent from the previous ""first-to-invent"" system to a ""first-inventor-to-file"" system for patent applications filed on or after 16 March 2013.

In a first-to-file system, the right to the grant of a patent for a given invention lies with the first person to file a patent application for protection of that invention, regardless of the date of actual invention.‚Äù

"The original comment you are responding is pretty ridiculous to start with but adding the Roadster into is even more stupid. The Roadster has nothing to do with my Model 3 Performance. I bought that car cash in full with no discount and I overpaid $5,000 for having participated in the reservation program. (see response to original comment).

The Roadster is part of the referral program, which has nothing to do with this. I referred over $18 million worth of Tesla vehicle sales in order to win those Roadsters. You have a problem with that?"
"But they DID simply reduce the price and you took it personally. They realized they should adjust to the market. LITERALLY EVERY COMPANY DOES THAT. As Tesla did in the past. 

People are selfish, of course people will thank you for complaining for them and getting them five thousand dollars. Also, you say 99%. That data's from where? 

And you weren't complaining to complain. You were doing it because you wanted your way. And you got it and now act like you're some altruistic voice for the people. "
"> My issue was that Tesla took reservations from people waiting for the performance Model 3 for years and then two months after finally delivering those cars to reservation holders, they saw that they couldn't sell the cars to non-reservation holders for the same price so they slashed the price by $5,000 - basically charging a premium to reservation holders.

"I'm no Fred/Elektrek basher, so don't get this wrong, but where were you when early adopters couldn't use referral codes/get any free Supercharging, but later deliveries could? Isn't that the same kind of penalty to LR RWD folks who got the ""buggiest"" builds?  We essentially paid more/got less than those who took delivery later."
"You were complaining because you're a child that didn't like the fact that someone else got something for less than you did. Tesla's goal is to change the fucking planet and you're just worried about how the next guy paid a few k less for a toy that nobody made you buy to start with. You got exactly what you paid for. Congrats on taking much needed cash away from a company that just had to cut their workforce, enjoy your Tesla and your money and hopefully it was all worth your trashed reputation."
"If you think it is dumb that people think you were only upset because you personally felt miffed, maybe you should look at your consistency over time. You gave us that impression, so don‚Äôt call us dumb for watching your behavior from behind an add blocker. 

At least we all learned that when a blogger throws a tantrum, they can get their way. "
"My issue is you got what you paid for and even made money from writing about it for around a month. I have bought things and shortly after they dropped in price or went on sale. I was willing to pay what they wanted when I wanted it. Chidren complain about how life isn't fair, sometimes you lose. Tesla basically made the statement ""you don't need to preorder, just wait long enough and we will lower the price!"", but in this case it was too fast for you and others, all you had to do was wait.

On that day I closed my electrek tab (and started spelling electric wrong! haha) that would refresh 3-10 a day and only gone back by accident. You have good summaries of reddit posts, other sites, original content about used high mileage Model S and new Performance 3 experience, and put your opinion on the end. You then got pissed you bought exactly what you wanted for what they asked for. I am sure your $5k was worth more than me visiting your site for many years anyhow.

I don‚Äôt think they would have put such beefy charging cables in it if it wasn‚Äôt able to use them.
"I dunno, does charging speed matter that much (as opposed to taper)? Like, I‚Äôve never wanted my 3 to charge faster when it‚Äôs warm and going from 10 to 40, but I‚Äôve gotten impatient when I‚Äôm going from 70 to 90."
Going on the cheap side I‚Äôve been using some IKEA Laddas which some people suspect could be rebranded eneloops.
That‚Äôs what I use and love them. Worlds better than Energizer or equivalent. I‚Äôd just like to rock some Tesla batteries. 
Yup. I bought some over 12 years ago and they're just now starting to go bad. The newer generations are apparently significantly better than those.
"They dont make a standard Lithium based rechargeable cell at a nominal 1.5V? Specifically for AAA,AA,C,D size?

That would require a built in step down regulator assuming it used a similar chemistry?

I recently purchased some ""9V"" but those can be roughly equivalent because they are 2S with a built in cutoff and overcharge circuit, perfect for tools with parasitic draw when forgetting to remove the plug. "
The IKEA batteries are exactly the same at about 1/3 of the cost. 
"Educated guesses.

5% cost because it's less additives, so less sourcing, mixing, etc. Doubt they would bother if it cost more, so it will cost less, but not a whole lot less.

25% charge because it needs to be significant enough to warrant the cost of implementing. If it's only 5% faster it's not worth it.

40% longevity because Dahn seems has some passionate ideas about this. Charge time and longevity are correlated, so maybe he cracked longevity and that let the charge rate be higher.

Anyway, I think it will be something like that. Very curious to hear the experts chime in. I read in another thread that this might just be for stationary and maybe semi, so lots of speculation."
Then how is that guy holding one
"Yah I didn't know that was normal before I bought it...Yes I heard the winter hurts the range a bit, but didn't know it was that much.

Not liking that....at all. As for the downvotes, meh, it's Tesla Sub, you can't say anything critical...or else."
50% is kinda the worst case scenario and certainly not what the majority of people should expect during winter.
"When it's Electrek, yes. Fred has single handedly caused more harm to Tesla customers than anyone else."
"Yeah folks here don't realize that Fred's recent drama means Tesla will be much more hesitant about dropping the price, and they're already gutting the referral program after they saw how their referral program doesn't generate much loyalty even for someone getting two free roadsters.  "
"You'd have to RTFA to know that, though!"
"I can't find this, can you confirm where?"
Cars made in China are for the Chinese market. They're not bring exported to other nations 
"Really wonder if that's due to cheaper labor or due to having an environment that is more receptive to a fully automated factory.  That was the original Model 3 production goal, but the impression I have is that they weren't going to have the bugs ironed out before going bankrupt, hence the mad scramble to build them in a tent in order to keep the company alive.  Some day, a truly incredible book is going to be written about that time period.

Also, nice username."
"Roadster 1, model s, and model x where all once mythical. But no one ever feels any shame once the myth becomes reality.... they just invent the next myth. Isn‚Äôt dat vierd?"

"Tesla‚Äôs vision and mission has never changed since inception. Transitioning the world towards sustainable energy/transportation.

https://www.informs.org/Blogs/M-SOM-Blogs/M-SOM-Review/Why-did-Tesla-Give-Away-Patents-for-Free-An-Analysis-of-the-Open-Technology-Strategy-from-an-Operational-Perspective

Either way letting others use your patents is a calculated business strategy"
A free license to use a patent typically comes with a clause that it‚Äôs void if you sue the patent holder for violations of your own patents. 
">But didn‚Äôt Tesla say that anyone is free to use their patents?

That's not how it works. Tesla will give out a zero dollar cost license of the patent for a fixed term (typically a couple of years). After that, it's back to the negotiating table. It's possible Tesla is issuing them in perpetuity instead of a defined term, but that would be foolish on their part.

Either way, it's not ""free"". There are strings attached. Tesla could very well charge a fee for renewal of the license or even discontinue issuing a license when it expires. 

\-- Source: I don't know any Tesla secrets but I do deal with contracts like this for a living. I never take a ""free"" offer from competitors because they inevitably come with strings attached."
"This is the common misunderstanding.  Tesla did not say, everyone is free to use the patents.  They said, our patents are open to anyone to use, who also opens up all of their patents.  That stipulation is very hard or near impossible for any of the legacy manufacturers to take advantage of because of how much more they would give up than get. "
"You answered your own question. You left out the ""in good faith"" part. Freely using your patents, then suing you for using mine is not using your patents in good faith.

Its basically doing paragraph #2, but being open about it."
"A troll meaning someone patenting an application or process that you use. Not all patents are objects.  

A lot of digital patents are process based. They are easier to abuse .  But Tesla is still using this as a protective patent."
"I can give more detail later. But it's pretty much the Apple samsung fight for touch screen ""swipe to unlock"" functionality."
That's not how it works.  All Tesla has to do is publicly disclose the technology then it becomes unpatentable by anyone because it's public knowledge. 
"Yes, I am asking you why you think that is corrupt?  That is how are patent system works, it is designed to work that way. "
"First to file and first to invent have nothing to do with public disclosure. 

Things in the public domain cannot be patented regardless of who invented it. 

You can't take currently existing things and patent them.  Once something is publically disclosed the patent will be rejected or overturned once someone shows that it previously existed. 
"

Is that true? If you publicly disclose something nobody else can file for a patent? I thought they had one year from initial disclosure to file. And they could also make an improvement and then file

"This is a bit different, though. The suggested improvement doesn't propose doing anything drastically different; just altering the special electrolyte sauce. Matter of fact, it _simplifies_ the recipe. This could even be currently used in their cells since this patent was filed 2 years ago!"
"In this case existing cell lines can probably be essily adapted to the new formula.
Definitely NMC 2170 cells for Powerwalls and other energy storage products.
Possibly new 18650 NMC cells  for Model S/X and Roadster.
They have done extensive accelerated testing on nee chemistry. If they trust it and it can quickly and economically be adopted,  it is a easy decision to make.
I've been bullish on this since I first saw the Dahn video, I could tell Dahn himself was very excited about the results."

"I'm just making a joke, Fred...

That's what the ""/s"" means."
"Your point only makes sense if you treat this like any regular price drop as if Tesla is just a regular retailer.

That's not the case. It's just not what it is. Tesla artificially increases the price just for reservation holders knowing that they would pay and as soon as they went through that backlog (2 months in), they decrease the price down to the real price for regular demand.

Apple did the same thing with the first iPhone. it was pointed out to them that it was wrong and like Tesla eventually did, they quickly corrected the situation and reimburse the early buyers.

This is basically an Indigogo in reverse. Those willing to support the product and order it in advance pre-production are punished instead of getting a discount like those crowdfunding campaigns. 

I never asked for a discount. I just want to pay the real intended price for the vehicle."
"Yes, they did after it was pointed out that it wasn't right to have charged the upgrade package to the reservation holders in the first place.

You make it sound like it was always their plan. They didn't until myself and others raised the issue."
"You have to give up your unlimited supercharging, however... despite whether you received the supercharging through the Performance promotion or through using your friends referral link. 

Still worth getting the refund but overall leaves a sour taste in the mouth of someone who waited 2 years as a reservation holder to not really receive any benefits over a non-reservation holder; and in fact pay $5K more for the car."
Because it didn't directly affect him so he didn't care.
"I didn't like that either, but that was part of the referral program and reservation holders didn't go through it. "
Of course they wouldn't bat an eye because Ford wouldn't have been artificially increasing demand by taking reservation for 2 years. Apple and oranges.
"Maybe not for emergency applications, but for a fully disconnected house with a solar roof, you either have to do full charges and discharges every day for half of the year, or you have to massively oversize the battery."
"$/kWh/cycle .. That's a neat formula!  But you'd need to factor in two other harder to quantify metrics:  
\- battery degradation per cycle  
\- maximum tolerable degradation per application "
350 kw is a lot of power I forget how much but I believe a 30 minute charge gets you a significant amount of range
"Who says it will be implemented?  

I wouldn‚Äôt call this an educated guess at all.  More of a rectal pluck.  "
It‚Äôs a Tesla branded cell from Panasonic. Tesla combines the cells into packs. Using thousands of those cells.
"Tbh, for most long drives (not all), the reduced range isn‚Äôt a huge deal imo.  Unless you like rolling the dice, you‚Äôll still be stopping at about the same number of supercharger, but the batteries will be at a lower state of charger and charge faster.  Yes, it‚Äôs a big deal if your end locale is a bit from a supercharger with no destination charging for the night.

I‚Äôve only seen the 50% reduction in rated range while it‚Äôs been sub 25F, and I‚Äôm cranking the heated seat/cabin air at 72F/and cruising at 75mph.  During this recent polar vortex, I heard numerous stories of people having issues with their gasoline vehicles as well.  The Tesla has no issue starting immediately, and my cabin got up to 72F in no time."

"You sure about that? I could've sworn I heard Tesla state that 1. All the chinese cars would be the SR, that the AWD and LR variants would not be made at Shanghai, and 2. The cars would be ""for"" the Chinese and worldwide market.  

That does not mean they are exclusively for that market though... Tesla is very careful at turning the phrase in their favor."
"I don't have inside info, but cheap labor including the engineers and the proximity of the supply chain were two big factors.  Also, the speed with which things are built in China helps the time-value of money portion of the equation.  

Autoline after hours https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVnRQRdePp4 has a deep dive where a lot of the economics of the situation are given the deep dive treatment.  Sounds like margins on the base Model 3 can be robust if it is built in China.

Other things I expect, though with a chance less than the Supercharger v3 reveal: Smart Summon / Enhanced Summon reveal. HW3 release. FSD update (because this might be connected to the Supercharger v3 -> not sure if Tesla still plans on doing it, but on the Autopilot description page for FSD it still says [1] -> however maybe only some ""main"" Superchargers v3 will get the automatic charging connection enabled). 

[1]:
> For Superchargers that have automatic charge connection enabled, you will not even need to plug in your vehicle."
"Not to defend the practice but if they were going to steal something, I'd prefer it to be something like this to help their environmental issues."
"Just to clarify the above exchange:

Tesla is known to release their patented tech for any company to use because they believe it's part of their mission to help bring more electric vehicles on the road. And they try to argue to their investors that more ev adoption is helping Tesla too, i.e. encourages more charging infrastructure which makes people more likely to buy any electric car, and maybe a Tesla.

Then then your parent comment explains why they even bother with patents if they intend to share the tech ology - because they don't want a patent troll to sue them. 

So in your example of a Chinese company copyingtheir solutions: they don't mind. 


They don't want to make a car for every single person on earth, they can barely build one for anyone who wants to buy it right now."
No they'll sell a counterfeit one that looks like the Tesla cell while actually being an inferior one
"It‚Äôs more complicated than that for years foreign companies wanting to manufacture in China had to find a Chinese company to partner with and even share some patents.  So US companies knew that these companies would compete one day.

My understanding is that Tesla is one of the first companies to not have a Chinese manufacturing partnership.  The general sentiment of China is that the government will enforce their patent laws strategically as well.  There‚Äôs a lot going on there, and I‚Äôm certain I oversimplified the situation and butchered it, just wanted to bring up that it isn‚Äôt just rooms of Chinese engineers copying stuff, although they do that too."
"I mean, Tesla just released all their patents.... to the public.... so China can legally have them, anyways...."
"The whole point is that Tesla has released the patents. China is welcome to copy this and hopefully will start producing them in large numbers. The point is to make many cells, immediately, and decrease our fossil fuel consumption. China needs to do that as much as anybody. 

You say ""copy *our* tech"" as if you had something to do with it. You didn't. ""They"" aren't doing shit to you.

">But... that‚Äôs not how patents work.. at all. They could just publish their findings and have the same blocking effect. They just want more control over the technology, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing, but that is the purpose of patents.

Publishing might win a court battle, but a patent can prevent the court battle in the first place.

Imagine they didn't, and GM simply copied and filed themselves.

Now GM is dragging their asses to court with PTO filings, while Tesla has archive.org screenshot printouts. Hell, they might even win.

...you're a multi-billion dollar corporation. Just file your damn patents."
"US is first-to-file, with a 'first to disclose' asterisk.

This means you can disclose an invention, and have a year to patent it.  But this disclosure isn't trivial.  For it to hold up in a patent challenge, it must to contain particular information and conform to certain standards.  Broadly speaking the more the disclosure looks like a patent application, the less risk there is of someone claiming you infringed on their IP.

So, from a legal standpoint, to defend the use of your IP, you need to basically create a patent application.  This is the majority of the cost for a patent.  Now, you can either sit on this and hope for the best, or you can just submit the damn thing and get far better legal protection, for a minimal cost.

What do you think they're going to do?

TL;DR: Prior art is worth far *far* less than you think it does.  Winning or losing an infringement case doesn't matter; having to litigate means you've already lost due to legal fees."
"Your comment is incorrect. ""Canada, the Philippines, and the United States had been among the only countries to use¬†first-to-invent systems, but each switched to first-to-file in 1989, 1998 and 2013 respectively."" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_to_file_and_first_to_invent"
"Sort of. Blue Origin did file a patent for sea landings in 2010. But they did not sue SpaceX. It was SpaceX that challenged the patent and eventually won in having it invalidated. 

"

"It could be a calculated business strategy, and as a publicly traded company it needs to be justifiable to shareholders. But it could also be a decision made primarily in regards towards accelerating EV progress. By having open patents that are free to use, and by making the stipulation that other companies can‚Äôt sue you or other EV manufacturers you create an environment where everyone is sharing information and effectively working together to make better products. Tesla has said they won‚Äôt sue anyone for using their patents, and anyone using their patents can‚Äôt sue anyone either. So everyone is free to copy, use, and improve upon existing patents and technology. 

Without this, you would have to wait 20 years before using another company‚Äôs patent. Or pay them a licensing fee which would obviously be passed straight onto the consumer."
The strings seem to mostly be that you can‚Äôt sue Tesla or other EV manufacturers. Seems pretty worth it unless you have some super important patents 
"Yeah no worries, I fully understand that. But my point is that me as an individual could also be a patent troll. "
"Oh I see. Because ICE car companies don‚Äôt give a shit about the environment and there has been zero push to get cars above about 35mpg. They‚Äôve known about global warming for about 70 years and don‚Äôt care at all because they don‚Äôt have to pay for the negative externalities their businesses cause to the environment. 

So it‚Äôs much better to have efficient batteries on the market from many companies all competing with each other, than it would be for only one company with efficient batteries for two decades. 

It‚Äôs like medicine. After inventing a new medicine it‚Äôs expensive as hell until the generic versions are allowed to be produced. And if people die from this high cost (or the many people already dying from global warming), then I view that as corrupt."
That‚Äôs not true. What do you think ‚Äúfirst to file‚Äù means then? I just recently talked to a patent attorney last month and filed a provisional 
And yet you completely dodged the fact that only 1-2% max of cars being bought today are EV‚Äôs.
"You're right, but basically only in the US.  Our patents (like Tesla's) basically need to be filed in many countries, so the rule I gave above is in practice correct even if it's not literally true in the US.  I thought this was from a team in Canada (not that I think it matters, but the law firm I work with files in the country of origin first).  

IANAL, just a guy who patents stuff occasionally.  "

[It's already in writing](https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-pledge)
Thank you. This is the best compliment I've ever received 
"Somebody in the article comments quoted Elon on 06/2018 saying he expects an energy density gain of 30% possible in 2-3 years with more gains to come after that. Hell, just 30% more with the same weight in 2-3 years is huge, especially if that also means costs coming down. I wonder if that means eventually the new standard range battery packs are closer to 300 miles and long range pushes past 450? Combine that with V3 Superchargers and the ""I can fill up my tank anywhere in minutes"" argument gets seriously muted."
In 2017 he said his work was already going into Tesla products: https://electrek.co/2017/02/07/tesla-battery-research-longevity-breakthrough-products/
"Right? The article literally says:

>The patent application says that¬†the new¬†two-additive mixtures in an electrolyte solvent can be used with lithium nickel manganese cobalt compounds, also known as a NMC¬†battery chemistry.  
>  
>It is commonly used in electric vehicles by many automakers, but not by Tesla. The company used the technology in its stationary energy storage systems, but it uses NCA for its vehicle battery cells.

I guess that's what I get for assuming people read the article..."
There was a rumor that the Semi and the roadster will be using NMC. Other rumors is that it will be NMAC which would be a combination of NMC and NCA.
That's not an answer. That site is useless marketing wank. After quite a bit of googling I have only managed to decode that lcp = liquid crystal polymer
"Sometimes is a little sensitive...

Edit: /s"
It was a joke too when this whole thing went down and you also brought in the roadster or it's just now a joke?
"> Tesla artificially increases the price just for reservation holders knowing that they would pay and as soon as they went through that backlog (2 months in), they decrease the price down to the real price for regular demand.

Do you have any actual evidence for this claim?"
"There's no thing as an artificial price. They adjusted AWD and white seats after they came out. Did everyone get refunds? They increased the price of MR. They decreased the price of the S75. 

When the Performance 3 was first announced it was even more expensive, they saw it was priced too high so they lowered it and honored the price because none had been delivered. That has always been the case. No one ever got retroactive refunds until this cluster. "
They were probably ready to pull the trigger. You really think that Musk made an executive decision that cost that much money that quickly?
"Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't.  But they did do it.  The end result is acceptable to me."
You had preference to get your car first. And the car will always get better over time. That's how things work. Everyone is so damn sensitive. 
"I (reservation holder) got a P3D- which no longer exists.  So a full performance model 3, at 5k less, and without (tacky imo) stuff like giant heavy pothole vulnerable wheels, lowered ride (in Texas... not a great idea), CF spoiler (this isn't a ricer), and larger brakes (not bad... but not useful unless racing), and metal brake pedal covers, which are on amazon for $40.

So I feel like I came out way ahead, eventually."
[deleted]
That‚Äôs really what they look like?
"If it regularly gets that cold yes, otherwise no."
[deleted]
Entitlement at it's finest. Watch the tone of their coverage starting to change as soon as they get their roadsters.
"I see, I read over it and clearly missed that. Thought they just got the patent and started the work in 2016. This likely what‚Äôs in Model 3 then. "
"Musk said Shanghai was for Asian markets only, not more that two weeks ago."
">Yeah, tons of testing is needed, especially with battery technology

If you're familiar with Dahn then you know that he's developed some highly specialized equipment to test as he goes. I'm confident this patent isn't for some ""kinda works in my lab"" chemistry like we see in a lot of BATTERY BREAKTHROUGH! articles. It's been run through the paces prior to the patent being filed.

>In addition, there is probably going to be some pretty massive upgrades

Not sure why you think this. It's about changing electrolyte/electrode chemistry for (safe bet) the 2170 cell. It's not some brand new form factor with some crazy triple-electrode scheme.

I don't see why this can't be in vehicles in 6-12 months. Certainly not years.
"
"> Megapack

Oh yeah, completely forgot about them again. Wow, so many new things to expect in the future!

"
Plus they'll still be behind the research curve as months/years of research occur before a patent happens.
"China is the world's leading country in energy production from renewable resources. If you seriously want to talk about environmental issues, you might want to look at the US and how the current administration is working hard to curtail the powers of the EPA. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_China"
"Does Tesla license the patents?  If they dont, then Tesla will always be at a disadvantage in China. Will they eliminate the tax they apply to Teslas?  If they manufacture in China I hope they get the same benefits as any other Chinese manufacturer. If not, once China starts building their own EVs with Tesla tech, Tesla will suffer. 
"
"Just to be clear, the Chinese do enforce patent law. Its sometimes just... enforced strategically. If you have a lot of Chinese people on board @ Tesla China, both at the top and bottom, and a lot of Chinese investors, and a lot of Chinese banks, they have more of a vested interest in caring about the health of Tesla China. Just think of it how Trump is thinking of it... If a Japanese auto manufacturer has a bunch of R&D, Design, etc etc. all in the USA and all their cars sold here are actually made here, he loves them right? His thought process aligns well with the Chinese government's. Designing and building them in the USA then exporting to China, they have much less reason to care."
"Yes. I heard the deal is also unique in that sense but the Chinese are not stupid. They will have Chinese management (Sr. Management will probably be American), Chinese engineers and will fully take advantage of this partnership at the benefit of the PRC. They have spent decades copying tech. This will be easy for them. 

As the Chinese say in China ‚Äúyou make it, we fake it.‚Äù"
"‚ÄúThe whole point is that Tesla has released the patents. China is welcome to copy this and hopefully will start producing them in large numbers. The point is to make many cells, immediately, and decrease our fossil fuel consumption. China needs to do that as much as anybody.

You say ""copy our tech"" as if you had something to do with it. You didn't. ""They"" aren't doing shit to you.

If anything, make all products up to the best technological level we have developed anywhere

Goddamn nationalist dumbass. This technology wasn't even developed in the US.‚Äù

Haha.  You might want to look in the mirror before calling someone else names. With your mentality we might as well share our nukes with North Korea. If you think China will use this tech to reduce fossil fuel consumption, you‚Äôre crazy. They will find other applications for it and they could care less about the environment. They do just enough to make people think they are trying to reduce emissions when in reality they could do so much more.  They will take this tech, reverse engineer it, improve it, find other applications and not share it with anyone in return.  They only care about themselves. 

I work in the tech industry and have been to China dozens of times over the last 15 years so I know how they work.  I‚Äôm also an immigrant and a naturalized American citizen and want nothing but the best for my country. So when it comes to a country like China that is striving for world dominance and would do anything to wipe the US off the face of this earth, you‚Äôre damn right I‚Äôm gonna be a nationalist. I‚Äôd much prefer we send that tech to Mexico or Southeast Asia or another poor country looking for an economic boost.....but not China. I‚Äôm tired of doing them favors.  "

"So.... no, it didn't happen. SpaceX disputed a patent filed by Blue Origin. It didn't get sued by Blue Origin."
"yes you could.  You would just need to pay for all the filing fees.  Nothing stopping you from doing it, and licensing your patents to companies. "
"> Just to make sure some corrupt company doesn‚Äôt patent them first?

This isn't corrupt.  It is how it works.  It is like saying, ""Why did you buy this house, was it so some corrupt person didn't buy it first.""  No, that is the process.  Someone else buying it, or someone filing a patent, is not corrupt.

Jesus, you are unhinged."
"You seem to think that just because you are the first to file for a patent means you're going to get it granted.  This is dead wrong. 

The USPTO examiner will do research and if he/she finds someone else mentioned the idea prior to your file then that NO ONE is able to get a patent on it beacuse it is public knowledge.  They won't be able to get a patent on it but neither will you...it's been publically disclosed. 

Anyone can also invalidate an issued patent too by providing evidence that the idea existed before it was filed for.

"
"Sorry for judging your username... but are you in Mexico? If so, I actually need to ask you about securing a Mexican patent "
"He's said price per KwH will be below $100 bucks this year, probably. That requires new battery cells."
Well maybe you should stop spreading the roomers. NMC is not a good option because the Cobalt % is too high and it's expensive.
"If I was to try to make a website with all of the hot investae keywords, that would be it. 5G check. iSomething check. Quantech check. "
The make batter case material. You suck at research. 
"I'm pretty sure the point was that you bitched about being an early adopter by paying $5K more, which I can see why you are upset, but you are also getting 1 or 2? Roadsters for free.

It would be like someone getting a new phone by preorder and then the priced dropped a month later. Ohh wait that happens all the time in the tech world. "
"If you really think that, you weren't following closely when it all happened. Tesla called me when it was announced and I told them that I thought the move wasn't fair to reservation holders. They knew it wouldn't go well. It took a while before they confirmed that they would reimburse owners. "
"Of course the end result is acceptable. They eventually did the right thing, but this guy is giving me shit for saying that they were doing the wrong thing in the first place. that's it. #Teslacandonowrong"
"The price dropped a couple weeks after taking the order. Also, how am I sensitive? 

Not complaining about the product, but about the business practice. "
I don‚Äôt think any amount of good arguments will convince this guy to admit he‚Äôs wrong. Not worth the effort or time imo
"Yes. Tesla takes those cells, that look like big AA batteries, from Panasonic and puts thousands into modules to make the battery packs. The model s and x 100 kWh packs have 8,256 of those 18650 battery cells (18mm diameter x 65.0mm in length; the trailing 0 is redundant). The model 3 uses a slightly bigger cell format; the chemistry is most likely the same or very similar. Having 4,416 of the 2170 size (21mm x 70mm) in the long range pack. 

TL;DR: They are just slightly bigger cylindrical batteries that look like AA"
The context of this thread is winter driving. 
And let this place go into even more a place where the 'Tesla can't do no wrong' attitude is king? No. I've been here for 6 years and help it make a great place for Tesla owners at one point. I'm not going anywhere.
"..and even copying something takes time. Ideally, by the time it is copied the original creator is almost moved onto the next new thing. Otherwise, that is what you refer to as a moat, which Elon *claims* to be opposed to. If he means what he says, his ideology on innovation fits right in China."
"You also need to figure out how to use it, manufacture it, and work it into existing systems."
"Additionally the software, which is something I expect should not be easy to steal and is Tesla's true longterm advantage."
"Yes, I know."
Nah they arent at a disadvantage because china loves name brand imports. They know they make cheap copies and even when the copies work better its fit to have a legit one.
BYD is already much bigger than Tesla.
"Thats how it's supposed to work.

In the real world however things get through all the time that shouldn't. And it takes the courts to sift through it after millions have been spent from both sides.

And large corporations regularly use their size and virtually unlimited budget to force smaller companies to accept poor patent use agreements or bankrupt the smaller companies in the process to eliminate competition."
"Nice though that is, in practise patents are issued despite this and then abused. So defensive patenting is very much a thing."
"Yes, but prior art ends up a subjective call, not objective.  That's why Tesla patents and releases.

Otherwise, you can end up being forced to fight in court vs patent trolls, even if you *should* win, it's not always cut and dried."
"Sorry, not going to dig up links of the whole back and forth. Google can help you here. BO did end up making patent claims against SpaceX leading to the patent being revoked in court"
"That wouldn‚Äôt be a patent troll though, just an inventor/product developer. I mean some ghost companies or people buy up large batches of patents just so they can sue people. If you don‚Äôt believe me I can try to find a video about it "

Corrupt- adjective 
1. having or showing a willingness to act dishonestly in return for money or personal gain.
2. Evil or morally depraved
(New oxford American dictionary)

Destroying the world and killing people for profit doesn‚Äôt fall into this definition? 


Filing a patent is not inherently corrupt, I never claimed that it is. "
"Can you post a source for that? There is a window of time between initial public disclosure and patentability that is 1 year. First to file means who ever files first gets the patent 

You‚Äôre describing the old system where you could mail it to yourself.... now that doesn‚Äôt matter "
"San Jose, CA (formerly Mexico, but not any more)."
"What do you mean by ""new cells"", a new packaging format?  Off the top of my head, there were notable cost and weight savings coming from improvements to the battery pack \[and likely always improved manufacturing efficiencies\], as well as the mentioned chemistry improvements."
NMC cobalt content is not fix. NMC 811 only have 10% cobalt but with the right additive this can be reduce even farther. NMAC have low cobalt content I heard this as possible cathode with near zero cobalt Elon mentioned. Also Tesla is using NMC in energy storage where their battery margin is much lower compared to automotive battery margin so Cobalt is not the major factor that drive battery prices. Nickel and graphite prices specially synthetic graphite is the major factor on battery prices. Automotive battery needs high C-rate which would require synthetic graphite. Energy storage is low C-rate so they could use natural graphite to lower cost.
Why not just post that in the first place? I spent like 3 minutes so you can get fucked. If you can't tell what the hell a company does after spending a minute on their website it's a useless website. Also learn to spell.
"to your first point, what does the referral program has to do with the Model 3 Performance?

To your second point, WTF? that's not true. the only time I remember that actually happening is with the original iPhone and steve jobs actually apologized and reimbursed customers.

Jobs put it best:

>""We need to do a better job taking care of our early iPhone customers as we aggressively go after new ones with a lower price,"" Jobs said in the letter. ""Our early customers trusted us, and we must live up to that trust with our actions in moments like these.""

"1) You didn't mention that they actually gave $5k back while you were bashing Tesla for the move.  It's kinda important.   
2) Neither of us know if the refund was originally planned.    
3) Lowering the price is a good thing for consumers in general."
Winter can mean -10F or +40F. If it rarely gets too cold where one lives there's no point expecting a 50% drop.
"While true, but the capital expenditure and R&D costs are indeed incurred on the developer of the technology, not the one who steals the tech. So even if they lag behind, they still have a competitive advantage in that regard."
And support it with warranty and customer support when things go wrong.

your and my definition of patent trolls are different.   it is the motivation to horde patents that defines it to me.

"That's the US (and Japan) where you have a 1-year grace period to file before your disclosure becomes prior art.  That grace is offered only to the party who publicly discloses the information and not to some random party so no one else can file on your disclosure.

Outside of the US and Japan, there is no grace period so if you disclose, it becomes prior art and no one can get a patent.

Look up 35  U.S.C. 102 sec b.1.a"

So what about when you buy a car from any other manufacturer? You don't pay the same price as the next guy. So if you bought a new Lexus and then your buddy got one a month later for $2K off msrp are you going to go back to the dealership and ask for a refund? 
Uh most phones drop in price a couple months after release. Pixel 3 did this year
"1. Lie. I updated my post as soon as Elon told me that he was going to reimburse us.
2. Lie again. I know. Tesla called me when they made the announcement about the price decrease. It wasn't planned. I told them that it was stupid. They didn't do anything until I posted my article on it and people got upset.
3. Of course it is, but that's not even remotely the issue here."
"The one stealing the tech still has to expend capital to tool up to manufacture it, at the very least (although they might be less inclined to make it as precise or reliable, saving more there at the expense of the consumer)."
First to market usually gets to enjoy healthy margins as a reward. Second to market either needs a more compelling product (so they're still spending R&D) or compete on price.
Honestly I‚Äôm surprised Apple was #2. No wonder their revenue is what it is.
The reason Apple got taken over is that apple stood still. Tesla's philosophy is to keep moving forward and continuous improvement. This way even if your products are copied your competitor is still behind you. That did not happen with apple. Yes they got more efficient in making more money but they did not reinvest that money to invent new revolutionary product.

"What I mean is simply the existence of something that *may* count as prior art is no guarantee that it'll invalidate a patent.  Unless the thing is *exactly* the same at least.

Prior art is not a safe way to avoid expensive litigation."
"No, I think we have the same definition. I was just making a distinction between an individual or fake company who is a true troll, and a large company who does the same thing but as an insurance to protect their own IP.

That‚Äôs perhaps unprecedented in the auto industry and any other manufacturer who did the same may have angered even more customers.

"you can file a patent of a process that you have neither worked on, or developed.  Its not about buying portfolios to license or sue.

May I ask how you feel u/FredTesla flexed his power on the sub through his mod position?"
"Sorry about that.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9x60vl/electrek_tesla_model_3_is_starting_to_show_some/e9pue6x/) and the discussion string below it made it look like (to me) that Fred got upset and banned someone from the site.  I realize I could have been mistaken in that assumption, my bad.

That being said, I don‚Äôt understand why anyone should be banned just for expressing their frustrations.  Really what it seems we have here is a group of people that are not open to any agreement and think more of themselves than others.  A bunch of smart people angrily beating their heads into each other.

I don‚Äôt think /u/fredtesla deserved the drama he got from that article.  I also don‚Äôt think he handled the drama well.  Why not just apologize to people for coming off the wrong way, and then restate your complaint?  That would have gone much smoother I think.

But anyway don‚Äôt mind me, I‚Äôm just a random internet user :)"
"We don‚Äôt ban people for frustrations either or negative comments. Anyone who says that is simply lying.  We‚Äôll only give permabans if they violate rules even after a temporary ban. 

I can‚Äôt speak for Fred or how he handled the situation based on his personal experience.  I‚Äôm not familiar with the ban received, I was not part of that convo/action.  But sometimes users cause an uproar and insult the community, I can see how that can be a temp ban."
"So, to be clear - did Fred ban him or not?  You said in your first message that he didn‚Äôt but now you seem to imply that he did?  I didn‚Äôt see anything in that message thread that looked ban-worthy.."
No. He was arguing with another mod in modmail.

WTH?! 
Damn shorts will go to any lengths just to say that Elon is wrong. gg
I really trusted him. This friendship is over if it starts. 
"Working for Tesla was one of the best experiences honestly, glad I had the chance"
"He said 4500(?) are going to EU, he didn't say there was only 4500(?) in the picture :p

"
"1..2..3..4... 5458 welp my job here is done.
"
GL
"What if there are some already in containers, or inside the warehouse looking building?!?"
How many cars were there supposed to be?
"OMG.. I thought fans are anal in science-fiction world of Star Wars and Star Trek, but can't believe I'm seeing this. But then again, Tesla followings in the early days are like a cult.

To Elon's credit, he didn't round UP.

To Wall Street, they'll say he's inconsistent as estimating for cars  doesn't equate to how he estimates cars sold and future revenues or even date of the autopilot releases..."
Am I the only e who at first glance thought this was from GTA?
"That's enough energy to power 40 average US homes for 1 year.

(Assuming 75kWh per vehicle. And this: [https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3))"
"He had to round down, wouldn't want the SEC to get him"
"7000 teslas were built and all of the 5500 cars were transferred across the ocean. Once 4000 cars arrived, all of the 3500 where moved to distribution centers and the 2000 eagerly waiting customers finally received their 1000 vehicles! We home these 500 cars will serve their owners well and when the tax time comes all of the 100 tax bills are settled in timely manner.  #russanhumor"
You know that some of those cars are probably from other manufacturers 
Elon caught lying about success again. press F to short $TSLA
"Dude, whaaat..."
maybe only 4k of them to Europe 
How can you tell if each is a Tesla?
Are they all going to the same place?
So you put a camera that counts it automatically and sell the data to a hedge fund? 
Needs to charge up his calculator 
Plot twist: this is a stock photo and OP counted employee cars parked at the shipyard
"Did you Tweet this? Because Twitter is God, you know./^s"
What if there was a really bad hail storm? 
Hey y‚Äôall. Is getting a model 3 performance worth it over the dual motor? I mean it would be nice to have carbon fiber and premium brakes but... 
Speaking of Elon and his estimates... how feasible is the level 4(?) autonomy by 2020?
"It's just ""Teslas."""
How do we know every one is a Tesla?
This is absolutely ridiculous. Seek help for addiction.
what a jerk...
lol somebody had a lot of time on their hands
I thought this was a picture of Air Base from Apex Legends.
Why the apostrophe? 
I was REALLY hoping you used computer vision for this.  Ah well.
"There's an old Soviet joke:
A letter to a matches factory: ""I've been counting matches in your boxes for over ten years. Sometimes there are 60, sometimes 59, and I've even seen 58 a couple times. Are you all crazy there???""
The post somehow reminds me of it"
"See all that ""Decreasing demand""?"
Tesla understating the amount of cars sitting on lots. /s
What did he say it was?
You seriously counted them all using drone pics? 
Did you just call out Elon musk himself 
Elon would like to know your location 
Haha
I‚Äôm sure he said 4K screens

"<- out of the loop, what?"
"Elon is often wronf lol

Wasnt the Model 3 supposed to have new and amazing controls? Lol"
"It's not a big deal if just 1 goes missing, right...?"
Does Elon have battleships parked on the side?
cool...
Its funny how something so random can turn you off of something.
That looks like a good spot to land <ping>
Elon has learned to be conservative in his estimates.
Stay offffff the Addy. 
The absolute mad lad! Actually counted them all!!!
ü§î
"Shhh! They are only paying shipping and customs fees for 4k, so the number is 4k."
How did you even count these?
"There are 5,458 *cars* in this picture.  Seems likely that a staging area may include other makes and models as well, and have to presume that Elon wouldn‚Äôt understate by that much."
What if part of the area is just a parking lot and everyone has the same car :o
You have a life???? or?????
"So, no comment on the view of where the picture was taken? Looks amazing."
"Someone need to babysit elon's tweet, this is as bad as 420 funding secured,  FTC has to go after him."
How many years until a middle-class individual could afford one of these fine vehicles?
Sorry. Am total Tesla addict. And I know the first step to cure is to admit it. 
Seriously though...I mean props for the info but Jesus why? Like did you pop an adderall or something to get the urge to do this? I mean damn.
Twice
"oof

Guess a recount is in order."
Is it a Tesla?
Mods - please ban the OP for fraud 
"> He said 4k cars loading, He didn't said total car is 4k.

He said ""4k cars loading **for Europe**"".  So the difference of cars could be going to different destinations other than Europe."
"And Bro That takes some Hard Work. üòÇ. Anyway, Good work."
Also that parking lot generally has cars from other manufacturers as well. 
Proof Elon is dumping 1458 cars at sea to hide nobody buying them /s
I checked.  All the cars are there . You can totally trust OP and me

"BREAKING NEWS by CNBC, Bloomberg, Independent and some others"
"""TESLA inventory System broken, cars being lost "" - the media, probably "
"So ridiculous how the headlines are often negative for this company. Cars parked = ‚ÄúTesla not selling‚Äù, cars with lots of demand = ‚ÄúTesla not delivering fast enough‚Äù they just can‚Äôt win"
HAHAHAHA
"Norway is in the EU, so 1458 cars go to Switzerland."
"A 2000-car carrier going 19.1kt consumes 92.6 t/day of heavy fuel oil, at 41.8 MJ/kg and 20% thermal efficiency that's 215 MWh/day going to propulsion. If they're all 100kWh models, that's 200 MWh of batteries. Journey is several days.

edit: I found another more fuel efficient vessel carrying 6600 cars, service speed of 20.25kt, 60t/day fuel consumption. 20% was a [bad guess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake-specific_fuel_consumption#Examples_of_values_of_BSFC_for_shaft_engines) for thermal efficiency though. At 50% that would be 348MWh/day, carrying 660MWh of cars.

So no. "
"Omg, can I tweet it to Elon?"
"I did the math a while back, I don't think the whole journey is realistic, u need batteries on the ship as well, I think it's possible soon! and with a giant floating solar supercharger at the center of both oceans.. then we're talking"
"Great idea. If Elon gets hold of this idea, he will design the ship himself. He will call it the tesla waverider."
"That's just your o'pinion, man...
:D"
Who are You to get annoyed by small grammar mistake?
"Depends on many factors.   But based on this 

[https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3)

The average US household uses 28.5 kWhs a day.   If all of the model 3s were LR in the picture and they all were fully charged and have 75 kWhs of useable power that means 409,350 kWhs of stored electricity.   So 14,363 average US households could be powered for a day from the power in the batteries.   Again there would be losses and other things but that is just a rough calculation.    "
Tesla put all of them there to be loaded onto ships and sent to Europe.  That‚Äôs the port.

Actually I'm surprised it took so long üòÇ
Somebody call the ftc! 
"Notice the shorties counting cars in lots did not bother to count these.

Hmmm."
"""Length isn't our strong strong side"""
Thats my biggest dilemma. Would make sense tho..
"Fans or one fan, me? I haven't seen such an addict Tesla fanatic, so"
"I just watched ""The Informant!"" and the reverse happens - Matt Damon's character was skimming money from his employer, and every step of the way the amount just increases - as he's preparing to be released from jail, the number is up to $11M."
"You can precisely tell that all white ones are Tesla‚Äôs, so probably there is little to no mixture from other brands in other colours as well"
"HELL FUCKING YES!!!

*Also, don't forget you're in sub where there are a lot of fans like me."
Ideally test drive both and decide that way.  Or test drive the dual motor and see if that is fast enough for you.
"If there are no Mustangs where you live, you might not need P3D.

But there are, so you do."
Not feasible for mass release mainly due to the legislators.
Oh Please... They won't park tesla's between inferior cars ;)
I don't watch tv and  search internet too much so I waste my time differently 
"In fact, it's more math than time"
"It means ""approximately"""
"He's nice dude with internet trolls, so I will be fine :p"
Had to use both fingers and toes I‚Äôd imagine
I bet he didn't waste 10 mins of his time counting them (like I did)
Nah
"‚òπÔ∏è

I don't think there is anything cheaper being planed at the moment than the 35k USD Model 3. Model Y will probably start at 40k USD or something, but very unlikely that it will be cheaper than Model 3. What else is in the pipeline? Obviously the Semi won't be cheaper lol

EDIT: I'm hoping for the used market with Model 3s in a few years though."
"Depends on the location. In Norway, a LR AWD Model 3 is definitely affordable to the middle-class."
Depends on location and many other var
"Next time you pay for an expensive repair on your ICE vehicle, ask yourself if the Tesla even has the part that you are paying so much to have fixed. Likely it doesn‚Äôt. So, 0 years."
"Mid-range Model 3 starts at $42900 today. That‚Äôs available to upper middle class today. It‚Äôs right at the average for entry level luxury and luxury CUV sales. The rest of the middle class should be able to afford a used one in the next 3 years of so, especially after the $35k base models start shipping.

Don‚Äôt plan on ever seeing anything in the economy range from Tesla though. The batteries are still too expensive, they are loaded with unnecessary but cool tech, and it would directly reduce their ability to sell $100k luxury vehicles if everybody could afford one."
Next step is getting a Tesla! :D
"Used to be my flair a long time ago. :)

‚Äú1st step is admitting I have a problem.‚Äù"
Great work bro! 
How do you know every car in that picture is a Tesla?

"Bloomberg: Where is Elon hiding his over produced Model 3's, click the answer may surprise you! "
"Actually car manufacturers are required to make a certain amount of cars to get federal tax credits.  There are stories of the cars not being sold, but it‚Äôs because of the car manufacturers want tax credits as I‚Äôve been told by someone who worked in the industry.  That‚Äôs why we have several car yards around the country with brand new cars just sitting there.

"My opinion is that it mean they won already.

Tesla's mission is to accelerate sustainable energies adoption. Looking at ""big"" names of the auto industry being dragged into the game late and against their will is a rather fun thing to watch. In less than ten years now, Audi and Porsche went from ""EVs can't work"" to ""Look, our E-Tron/Taycan is the future! Go electric!""


In the near future we'll see insanely quick progress in the battery technology and self driving tech... Elon won. And I'm glad he did. "
"Nope, Norway is in the European Economic Area (EEA). Gives them access to EU markets but they're not an EU member country. "
"Welp fuck Tesla then if they can't power a ship


Also thank you for the math"
I wonder how the calculations are affected if the ship is covered in solar panels which can generate power 12h a day. Can it make it then?!
If it was hooked up to wave or wind generators that far out; your idea isn't that crazy
Knowing him?  Boaty mcboat tesla

"Or 40 homes powered for a year.  
It's hard to wrap my head around 14,000 houses. Like, is that on the scale of a village/small town, Manhattan, all of New York City, or Tokyo? But, I can imagine 4 streets with 10 houses each."
*Enhance*
you can't really zoom in when Elon didn't post a high-res picture. or rather zooming in doesn't help.
With that many cars it takes awhile to count them all. 
That's what she said.... wait :(

Teslas.  No apostrophes in plurals.
Are they all for Europe tho? 
"Here use my refferal code, it'll get us both... nothing, but you will end up with a sweet car"
"Okay, thanks for the reply!"
Everybody here needs to admit that they at least counted a few. Or how long the rows were. It's a matter of degree...
"Plus the casual assumption that they are all Teslas, right?"
"No. That's a Tilde.   ~

I'm talking about spelling Tesla's when he means Teslas."
Famous last words before Elon swats you
10 mins? C'mon.
"Wait, I thought a Tesla was like average 100k?"
In Germany it isn't. And so it is in many other countries.
I rent one very often. Need some more time for saving up and there you go.
Isn‚Äôt that like saying to an alcoholic ‚Äúnext step is to buy a brewery?‚Äù ;)

"https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/arysxi/tesla_removed_the_timeline_for_the_standard

Warning that these prices are a bit weird because they try to include gas savings and tax rebates. I think the current base model 3 is $45k before tax rebates which of course are very different depending on where you live."
A top of the line Model S is 100K.
People who think this may not be accounting for the extra cost of maintenance over the lifetime of an ICE car. And fortunately cheaper models are coming which will help even more.
If you stopped renting them you‚Äôd save more quicker! 
How and where do you rent them? I am looking for a reward for myself.
Seriously go online and look at financing options. They offer 84mo financing at some banks and payments would be very manageable and you get to drive it daily vs 1 day a month if you rent...
"Gotta love Turo!

"Stupid questions:

How and where do you rent a Tesla?  Online and locally?

Does it have auto pilot and other features that Teslas are known/attractive for?

What‚Äôs the maximum miles that you can take the rental?"

"Go rent an ICE for a week, and tell me you aren't stuck buying Teslas from now on.

I hate so many things about the company. But here I am in a hotel in Wyoming on the way to pickup another Tesla."
You're implying it was a lot of effort.
I have a feeling the model 3 will be a favourite for the country. Especially as the government ups adoption of EVs. 
"Also a gross misunderstanding of tax credits.

That's like saying ""I bought a Tesla last year for the $7500 tax credit, then pushed it into a pond to rot away""

'Hey bro, don't you still owe $100,000 on that Tesla? Sounds like pretty stupid financial planning...'

"The most you can spend on a Model S is currently $144,500. That‚Äôs a P100D with all the options, including the special request FSD not listed on the web site.

The least you can spend on a new Model S is $85,000. "
"The problem is you can hardly plan with that cost. Maintenance yes. Electricity cost? Not if you are charging public. Also how will savings over time help me with paying the money at the first place. If you don't have 40k, then you don't have it. Even if you are going to save like 5k over the next dozen of years. Oh and even 30k ‚Ç¨ after savings (unrealistic) would be more than most people pay for a car."
I can't. I'm addict üòÑ
That‚Äôs long been my dilemma. It costs maybe $150 to rent a Mo3 for a day in my area. But that‚Äôs $150 I then can‚Äôt put towards my own Tesla.... Decisions decisions.

Not that it was a lot of effort just wondering why OP decided to do it.
Not a lot of effort but probably still an unreasonable amount
"""I heard some Tesla roadster burned down during the entry into the Mars atmosphere. So, you see, Tesla's are too unsafe to operate even on other planets."""
"You may be wrong. People you just characterized are 'investors' that has few thousands put on Tesla's weekly success. Yes, they can be fans as well, but that specific behavior you characterized is common among that contingent.

Similar phenomena can be seen In Apple world - many young, not too dumb individuals invested in the stock and think any negative/kinda true piece of opinion on the internet will result in catastrophe and them loosing all their money. lol

"Some people use financing. Or buying used which will be an option for the Model 3 only a few years from now. Or a combination of saving some money first, then financing the rest.

"maybe you can get one and then use one of those apps that lets other people rent it from you.  if you're paying $150, maybe you can charge $100 per day.  "
Why can't you just take one out for a test drive?
just test drive it for free...?
"The company is called [Trevls.](https://www.trevls.com/)  I rented a Model 3 as sort of a test drive before I got mine back in May.  I was in Minneapolis anyway for work, so why not?  


Their website isn't great, but they're legit.  Picked me up at the airport and everything."
"Sure even lower payments for OP. 
Who would mind driving a Tesla for life? :D"
I think we‚Äôd last longer not getting to that feeling as quickly since we had to take the longer road to get there. 
"Okay, thanks for the info.  Which service/company do you use/recommend for renting?  I've only done the test drives, but would love to have a ""real"" drive to see how it is for long distances when I have to go on business trips."

"You made it sound legit, which made this even more funny haha thank you "
The used market will certainly get interesting in a few years!
I have used up that option. Now I'm renting.. :D
Do they actually let you test drive if you have no real intention on buying it? Ie cant afford it anytime soon?
Big difference between an $800/mo car payment and $1-200 for a weekend rental.

I wish I could do this with more cars too before I buy them, but my area‚Äôs Turo isn‚Äôt that great, and the two nearest larger cities are 2.5-3 hours away. "
"For reals. The financial illiteracy in this post is crazy. Who the hell rents a car!? I get renting out of necessity, but renting a car for fun is just stupid. Find a cheap hobby and save! I‚Äôm proud to have gone from a Prius to an i3 and now a MX. I didn‚Äôt get here by wasting my money."
"Yeah I bumped into a a guy at a supercharger once. He owns an X, S, and 3. He rents them out I asked if it's a.good investment he said it pretty much covers the cost of the vehicles so at least he gets to drives them for essentially free"
"I can, and have, but that‚Äôs only 10 minutes. I want to know what it‚Äôs like to actually live with every day. "
"For 10 minutes? I want to drive it in bumper to bumper traffic on Autopilot, I want to take it on a road trip to Luckenbach, I want to charge it in my garage, and I want to see how it holds up after 50k hard Turo miles. A test drive doesn‚Äôt really help there. (Plus I‚Äôve already done one.)"

Fly to Honolulu and test drive one there.
"Where can you rent a Tesla for $1-200/weekend?  I have looked on Turo and I see nothing remotely to that ballpark.  Many could be $400+.  Also, if there is current financing, the difference is $800-(Current Financing Cost) - (Current Fuel Cost) + (Meager Electricity Price Increase)."
"If you‚Äôre seriously considering it, ask them if you could borrow it in the afternoon and bring it back the next morning. Make sure you have enough coverage on your car insurance, just in case worst were to happen. "
"If you happen to be in Minneapolis, there is (was?) a place in Mall of America that rents them.  Conveniently, that's a short subway ride from the airport. "
"Might be difficult. A supercharger would be installed at some point. Simply borrowing the car for a few days, or even a few weeks wouldn't address where or when a supercharger could be installed. "
"Autopilot in bumper to bumper traffic isn't that great, you still need to touch the wheel like every 30 seconds"
"lol

Great point.
Yeah let‚Äôs hurry on up then!"
"Noted, thanks for the info."
He said he's an addict.
Yeah that's pretty sad.. 
It's an option. Why?
"There‚Äôs a model S P90D on Turo in Kansas City area for $104/day.  There‚Äôs a P85 for $91/day.  

The Midwest FTW.

+ Insurance.... 
"Do you think they‚Äôd go for that? They don‚Äôt have enough cars to do 10 minute test drives for walk-ins, let alone keeping one overnight. 

Honestly, $150 is a drop in the bucket relative to the price of the car, so I think it‚Äôd be worth it. Plus frankly I‚Äôd rather get a person‚Äôs abused and neglected Turo car with 50k in it instead of a showroom car with 5k, so I can better understand how the car will hold up over time. "
"Austin area, but that‚Äôs good to know. Maybe something similar here‚Äî we were first to get the car outside Cali anyways. "
Huh? What does anything I said have to do with superchargers? I have a dryer outlet in my garage for charging anyways. 
‚ÄúNO you cannot test drive the Tesla anymore‚Äù
"SOMEBODY GET THIS POOR MAN A TESLA, STAT!"
It‚Äôs a beautiful drive. 
"Wow, that is pretty good price.  at $104 a day I would rent one for long trips and I own a 3.  BTW, buy one the tesla for kids car.  Not as fast or as much, range.  But still."
Used to work for Tesla - it‚Äôs called an overnight test drive and they absolutely do it. 
"They were willing to give me a Model S P100D over the weekend (of course, I had shredded a tire in the parking lot on my way to the test drive, so it could have been related to the circumstances)."
You said you wanted to know what it was like to live with the Tesla everyday. Tesla's have batteries that need to charged. I hope you knew that. Part of the daily ownership experience of a Tesla involves the charger. 
There are companies who hire people to do what he just did...
"Not surprised, but good to know what the employees think. Honestly losing this kind of figure everyone can unite behind can be devastating to morale. 

I left my last place because they replaced our John Carmack style hero in upper management with a suit and tie MBA type that did everything by the book. It took all of a year for morale to go down the tubes, and fewer and fewer people felt any motivation to stay the night or work the weekend to meet a deadline the big boss set. 

It‚Äôs always hard to balance what investors/shareholders want with what works within the company culture. "
Anyone not confident will probably leave. 
Was there ever any doubt? Pointless survey really.
I wonder what their turnover rate is like
"Tin foil hat alert. 

Is it me or does it sometimes seem like the powers that be are doing all they can to undermine and disassemble everything Elon is doing for EV?"
"Well, he's been right a lot. Why wouldn't people be confident in that? 

And he does display an unusual amount of business sanity in the tech world when he says AI is not going to solve all the problems of the world or businesses. 

I just wish he'd stop tweeting to give the stock market jitters. Rich folks don't take kindly to that. We could all brainstorm some new Twitter Topics for Elon, LOL. "
No one asked me

Of course!  He's the smartest alien on Earth right now.
"Elon musk has a strong ""personal branding"" compared to Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffett "
The only reason Tesla is alive is Musk.  People forget he's a goddamn genius engineer and inspires both companies to work crazy hours like him.
Hmm.. With all the recent lay offs and cutting of services I don‚Äôt think the employees feel so ‚Äúconfident‚Äù about their jobs. I know a few employees and this is not what I have heard from them.
"I was a Tesla employee who has definitely lost confidence in Elon Musk, as well as Tesla‚Äôs work culture as a whole.

Note the ‚Äòwas‚Äô. I willingly left after internally watching the company fall apart, and I was not the last in my department to do so."
Of course. Most people do realise SEC are just being cunts
"Confident, but annoyed."
"Duh, what a stupid headline. He tweeted about a number that was discussed in their quarterly review"
"Blind polls tend to be inaccurate, and they usually fail on the pessimistic side given the reasons most people would find to stay in Blind (to vent). So a 70+% positive image there is astonishingly positive."
Of course....why wouldnt they be? 
Of course they are as are the investors. The only people who want him out are the shorts
[deleted]
Anonymous aka doctored
Still confident even though the CEO reiterated previous guidance? 
Of course they are. Both are doing amazing things!
"The only thing this proves is that 78% of the people polled cannot tell the difference between an actual leader and an entitled, parasitic egomaniac like Musk."
Elon MUSK come through! THEY believe in you.
Did they ask this over company email? I wonder what difference it would make on truly anonymous systems. 
"... ""*Still*""? 

:D"
Truth.  Sometimes it takes more than just money to motivate and inspire an individual.  
"yea if my boss is clearly a dick, i won't work hard at all. ill do the minimum i need to. but when my lower level boss who isn't a dick asks me to do something, i'll go out of my way for him. "
"Very true. The shareholders and investors often seem very separated from the company and it‚Äôs internal company culture. They only see it‚Äôs numbers , and make decisions based on them. "
"Shareholders are the worst. I am now buying shares on a discount from the sellers who lost faith in tesla stock. If i dont suck it up and buy it eventually i will regret it forever.

I dont give a shit if the price drops in a week or a month. I am here to collect as many of my never sells as i can while they are ""cheap"""
Anyone not confident finds a job for the same pay at 40 hours/week.
Anyone but confident would be venting on Blind. Which tells you a lot about what this poll means.
and should leave even if they don't do it voluntarily
"I was contracted at GF1 for a couple months, no surprises from me here. "
Definitely. He‚Äôs been doubted so many times.
"For SpaceX at least, some crazy number like 70% of its employees are interns so I‚Äôm not sure you could account on most of their workforce for turnover rate "
You don't need to wear a tinfoil hat to realize that powerful people will do what they can in order to protect their wealth. I'm surprised it hasn't gone even farther.
"I feel it's a fair assessment.


if you controlled everything would you want something challenging status quo?"
How is that tin foil? At this point the evidence is overwhelmingly obvious they‚Äôre out to get him. 
"Powerful people definitely want him to fail. But, he is also thumbing his nose at the SEC and his tweet clearly violated the terms of his settlement (yes I know the counterarguments, the tweet wasn't approved within the relevant time window).

Musk is brilliant in a lot of ways, and an idiot in others. Unfortunately, he needs to be smarter about his interactions with the SEC or he's going to get a huge smackdown that he can't dance away from."
"Maybe the SEC would just like the CEO of a public company to follow the law? 

It‚Äôs not like his going private tweet significantly moved the stock price at all, and it‚Äôs not like Tesla agreed to  take compliance measures for Elon‚Äôs tweeting as part of a legal settlement with the SEC. And it‚Äôs not like Elon has blatantly violated the agreement since it was made. 

No it‚Äôs big oil keeping Tesla down 
/s "
Yet the SEC is the one who made the market drop.
The SEC is doing more damage than Elon is lol.  Who's policing them?
Are you confident in Elon Musk? 
From what I understand it requires an email account @tesla.com to work. 
My husband's very large company does employee satisfaction and confidence polling every year. Not a single employee that he and I have spoken to trust that these things are actually confidential. They may open up a little about tiny issues but when it comes to the big questions many say what they think the company wants to hear. I wouldn't be surprised if at least some of the employees in this example did the same. 
Everyone points at the number but not at the why.
It's crazy how ex-employees get down voted for talking about how rough it is to work there.

"this üëÜ sad bc tesla has attracted some of the most phenomenal people. you join and toil as a true believer, and you're happy to, because ""lordElon!!! & we is accelerating the world's transition to sustainable transportation"" ... but the faith required gets Kierkegaard-y REAL quick

honestly, some of the shit that went on at that place... üòÖ oh yeah NDA üò∑"
What about the employees who don‚Äôt have equity in the company?
"Not just that.... I‚Äôve never quite understood why disgruntled employees don‚Äôt just leave and find something that brings them more happiness, if they‚Äôve concluded they either can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to fix things and just want to sit around groveling and developing stomach ulcers. "
"Indulge me. What is the difference? Because I see results, and to me that's the difference."
Interesting.  Tell us how you really feel about Musk.
"I‚Äôve always found that money was actually one of the weakest motivators. I used to work at a known game company. We all loved making games. Then during one of our all-hands meeting, our CEO said: ‚ÄúWe are not a gaming company. We are in the business of making money.‚Äù  Everyone deflated. I quit shortly after. They paid really well and had insane benefits. Still, that statement was soul crushing for a lot of people. I think a strong company mission can be very motivational. Tesla is one of the few that has that. There is an enormous number of people at Tesla who work their butts off because they truly believe they are changing the world. That is very powerful and a great motivator. (Source; wife works at Tesla)"
"If your employees have the option to leave, it always takes more than just money."
This.
"Yes, but most who sign-up know what they are signing-up for. It's not the pay at these companies (which is what this hole thread is essentially about), but the vision. Elon is part of that vision."
Basically what I meant.
Doubted by who?
It‚Äôs high but there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs 70%. They have 7-8000 employees now so there‚Äôs no way only 2000 of them are salaried. 
Holy crap
"I'm surprised it hasn't gone further too. 

To play devil's advocate, Elon is in uncharted territory with his candor on Twitter as a major CEO so it's tough compare him with anyone who's come before."
I get the feeling the rich guys cant do anything. If electricity prices keep falling and fuel prices rise there wont be any competition anymore.
"When it is cheaper for them to produce BEVs and they cut their non-renewable losses, they will play on all the criticisms they make about EVs now and claim to have overcome them all, after putting no investment into improving any of it. "
The only thing moving the stock is SEC announcing shit. Elon‚Äôs latest tweet was harmless and after hours. 
"Sorry - I am not going to waste my life studying the SEC. 

The Kingdom reigns. The new kings fight for prominence, just like in days of old. Now it's not with swords and ships - now it's with money and stock prices. 

But in the end, you cannot take a dime with you. So what will you do with your money while you're here? That's all I want to know of the Kings. 

Most of the Kings of Industry and Finance are not doing enough to improve the United States and the world - not at all. I support Elon Musk not because of his fights, or his media behavior, or because I think the fight is Business vs. the SEC, but because of the product he is selling. Period. 

All the rest is just noise. I left Twitter last year never to return. That was a very good decision. I think the people who enjoy Twitter fights are the same types that enjoy video games. I've never liked those either. "
of course 
As a CEO? No. This company really needs a veteran CEO who knows how to run a company. Elon is a great visionary but he has no clue what the average person wants/needs. 
Exactly!
And all Tesla Stores are closing down.. Employees already had a feeling.
High step to the cult of musk or be damned. 
"""Alleged"" ex-employees and any mention of the company ""falling apart"" without further explanation raises suspicions."
"It was probably the ""watching the company fall apart"" comment."
"I‚Äôm not sure about ‚Äòa part‚Äô, but the Cambridge dictionary provides, ‚ÄúIf an organization, system, or agreement falls apart, it fails or stops working effectively‚Äù.

Many, many parts of the company have stopped working effectively, soooooo..."
a part =/= apart 
Everyone got stock options. 
Because you can enjoy your job and not your boss. And how are they supposed to fix that?
"Stomach ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection of Helicobacter Pylori or excessive NSAID (advil, motrin, etc.) use.  "
"Really? It's hard to leave a job for some people. For example, if the economy sucks. Granted, it's supposedly doing well now. But imagine you're and average person with a full time job, and a kid, and a spouse and an hour commute... When would you find time to look for a job aggressively enough to find not just any old job, but one that checks all the boxes and doesn't suck? "
When would they have time? 16 hours days make it hard to go out and interview. It's full blown Stockholm Syndrome for a lot of employees.
I think it's because they truly find happiness in making our lives miserable
"Chillaban, you may grace some men with inclement weather, a fine picnic spread and bottles of the finest vintages upon a beach where the world women's volleyball tournament is just starting and they will just pull out their phones to downvote nature pictures "
What results would those be? The ones that look exactly like bog-standard capitalist profiteering? You exist in a *capitalist* system... that means you don't actually require *leadership* in any way whatsoever to get those results.
"Its crazy how it's all about perspective like that. Whenever a person pays another person for something, it's because the payer believes the payee has or will help them in some way. Therefore, the best way to make money is just to help people as much as you can, because the happier people are with what you've done for them, the more money they're willing to give you. A business leader should know that and have the company focus on making the customers happy rather than just chasing money, because in the long term, happy customers help you make the most money."
"Good pay, good coworkers, good job. Generally need 2 out of 3 to keep people content. "
"That‚Äôs not true. The recruiters lie to no end. Luckily nothing is hidden once you‚Äôre actually working for the company. 

I stayed about 2 years. Definitely not for the money. "
People whose finances are motivated by doubt.  Also maybe fear or uncertainty.
"Iirc the 70% is interns and freelancer, which they don't have to report as part of employee turnover to investors (which is probably why it's such a high rate)."
I‚Äôll just get downvoted again bc Reddit is about popular opinion but- their interns are paid salary.
There is a reason why he gets a lot of shit. Most of it is deserved. Elon is a terrible CEO for investors because he is completely unpredictable and unreliable. I mean how many times has Tesla changed their production guidance numbers just this month? I would never invest a penny in a Musk stock. 
"Fuel prices can't really rise if EVs take off, it will reduce oil demand enough to have a significant impact on the price."
"Going private significantly moved Tesla‚Äôs stock, it was more or less completely false. Because of that Elon and Tesla settled with the SEC. part of that settlement was that there would be more controls around Elon‚Äôs tweets. Elon has been pretty much ignoring the settlement since day one and here we are. It‚Äôs hard for me to blame any one other than Elon"
"Why does he then need to tweet about it?

Any sane person would not antagonize SEC, especially when he first got away with it for: ‚ÄúGoing private at 420, funding secured‚Äù tweet, which was obvious lie!

Plus what was the point of that tweet?!

He made Tesla what it is today, why is he now deliberately trying to get in trouble with these tweets?"
"He‚Äôs the only automotive CEO I see interacting with the ‚Äúaverage person‚Äù online and taking their suggestions and implementing them. Does he have some negative traits? Sure, everyone does. His positive traits far outweigh anything negative tho. "
A veteran ceo who will try to make the company sell petrol cars...
"I think this is part of why people like Elon and Tesla so much. He want to make cars that wealthier people would want, but cost effective enough for average people."
Can you elaborate on that last part and include how a veteran CEO would fit that criteria for you?
Average person as in employee or as customer?
Damn. Why are so many of your coworkers so high on Musk?
"> ""Alleged""

lol

"
üòÇüòÇ
"That /r/iamverysmart answer alone, as snarky as it's useless, indicates that maybe things started falling slightly less apart after they got rid of you."
They can also be caused by stress. 
This 
I like it. 
"I thought it was pretty much common knowledge that the work culture for Tesla and especially SpaceX is pretty cutthroat and somewhat delusional, but that's also somewhat it's appeal, married with the ambition."
Good point. Capitalism strikes again!
They‚Äôd lose the benefit of economies of scale for the distribution network though which would drive the end cost of gas way up and make many existing stations unviable.
"His actual tweet was ""**Am considering** taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."". If you felt you had a strong argument, why did you change what he tweeted into something much more blatantly false?

How I interpret this latest tweet is that his wording initially was misleading and he corrected himself a few hours later. I could be wrong, but this was also after hours, so when trading opened again, he had already corrected it. His tweet was to say how far Tesla has come in a short time. I don't understand how you view that as ""deliberately trying to get in trouble""?"
which oil company you working for?
Yeah he basically asked the Truck community everything that they are looking for in a day to day truck. As well as getting a lot of mentions of not making it look like a Honda Ridgeline.
Perhaps for role of eccentric visionary. Maybe less so for role of CEO of publicly traded company that must comply with the rules and regulations of being a publicly traded company. 
How long have you known him? It sounds like you must be really good buddys. Do you guys hang out on weekends or do you work with him? 
He's not conventional but gets s@#t done.
"Don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt bother pulling out the definition of the word ‚Äòwillingly‚Äô for you... üòâ"
"No they cannot. Either you are a doctor and you aren‚Äôt up to date, or you are a laymen and conflating physiologic stress, like something you would see from a severe burns in curling ulcers with ‚Äústress‚Äù which is considered by the general public (and what the poster was referring to) as psychological stress. "
"Common knowledge for people that follow the companies before they get hired maybe.

I honestly knew nothing about the mission, and very little about the brand before I started working there. And many of my former colleagues can say the same, "
"I didn‚Äôt literally write what he said as practically everybody on this reddit knows what I am talking about.

He got away for that tweet.

So why would is he antagonizing SEC again?

The problem is not correcting himself, the problem is he should not tweet anything similar due to his deal with SEC.

Tell me why some sane person would intentionally antagonize SEC and break his deal?

ps; What does he think, he will accomplish with this? If there is some truth about every big oil and big company against him, why would he even provoke them and whats worse give them ammunition!?"
"Good, I was *so* worried ... and I'll pretend to believe you hadn't been handed your hat, because *man* would I want some douchebag like you in my department! :/"
The latter! Thank you for the education!
"Informative, neat."
"Okay, fascinating. How'd you get into your position at the company then?"
You knew nothing about the mission? Maybe you shouldn't be upset if you didn't do your research?
Where was the antagonizing in his tweet?
"When you put something in quotation marks, I think it is reasonable to expect it to be in line with what was originally said. What you wrote was a substantially different statement from what Elon wrote.

My point was that it seemed like a simple mistake that did not even have any real impact. Surely he is allowed some bragging rights for what Tesla has achieved? Are you suggesting he should post nothing about Tesla on twitter? As far as I know, the SEC did not ban him from using twitter, so his use thereof is not, by itself, a violation of their deal. I think [Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) applies here where you attribute some negative intent from something that looks like an honest mistake"
"I mean, believe what you want. No skin off my back ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I left at the beginning of this month after dealing with the clusterfuck that management had become after the January layoffs. When you fire the -entire- team responsible for making high level, back end decisions, and then wholly replace them with people from another part of the company who had never dealt with your product before, it‚Äôs not going to end well and you‚Äôre going to end up with frustrated employees who only months before sang the company‚Äôs praises. From everything I‚Äôm hearing still, it hasn‚Äôt gotten better.

I‚Äôm talking solar, by the way. I can‚Äôt speak to the conditions/temperaments on the automotive side."
"No problem. And sorry if I came off as curt. As a doctor I‚Äôm on a constant battle of fighting medical myths (including my colleagues). 

To conclude: spicy foods also don‚Äôt cause ulcers, and nuts and seeds don‚Äôt cause diverticulitis. "
"I was selling my company and applied for it on indeed. They called me the next day and asked for a phone interview , told them I wasn‚Äôt available until next week (was genuinely very busy) so we skipped that and did an in person interview at the local Tesla, 

Interview was very much like any interview. 2 immediate managers and a hr contact. 
Got the offer a few days later. Took it as it was decent for an easy job. Got promoted 3 months later and that‚Äôs when the fun but importance started."
"Woah - I‚Äôm not upset. I stated a fact, recruiters lie to lure people in. 

I enjoyed my time with Tesla tbh - and don‚Äôt regret any of it. But I recognize wrong where there is wrong "
"SEC fined him for making false statements!

Everybody, including SEC, can accept honest mistake, however when you are doubling down on it (SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing ‚Ä¶ ü§ó), then it is different story.

And more thing to add, a bit off topic, was Pedo comment also an honest mistake?"
The SECs deal said that he couldn‚Äôt tweet material information about the company without proper compliance for the disclosures so that Elon doesn‚Äôt end up tweeting more statements that are false and significantly misleading to investors.
"> I‚Äôm talking solar, by the way. I can‚Äôt speak to the conditions/temperaments on the automotive side.

You should have lead with that..."
"""Dr. Cum_on_doorknob will see you now..."""
As an engineer I have great appreciation for learning and being corrected. It's all good! 
"You sound like a student, not a staff doctor lol "
"The ""local"" Tesla ? Were you working at a Tesla store ?

Because there is a major difference between working at a store and at the factory."
"That‚Äôs waaay too familiar sir.  That‚Äôs ‚ÄúDr. Strange‚Äù to us common folk.


(If I could‚Äôve upvoted you 100 times I would have.  Lol‚Äôd and startled the dog)"
"Heh, close, freshly minted MD"
"I‚Äôve worked in a variety of roles both service center and corporate type.

I‚Äôve not worked in production, and quite frankly know very little about that side of the business. 

Most of my time was spent helping solve the ‚Äúdelivery hell‚Äù."
":D

Congrats on the car, if your flair it's accurate."
Okay but then I don't understand how you can say that you lost your confidence in Musk without ever working for him at the factory. That's where the challenge is.
Thank you.  Same to you :)
"Where did I say that I lost my confidence in him?

And you realize there are multiple challenges in a company as large and multifaceted as Tesla. What an ignorant thing to say."
"Oh sorry, confused you with another poster.

But you were giving your opnion on how you and your colleageus kne nothing about the company and the sacrifice expected from their young engineers. It's a surprising statement but it's much less surprising now that you say that you worked at the store, not at the factory.

And of course there are multiple challenges but they are not all equal."
"Again, I know you think you know what you‚Äôre talking about. But you don‚Äôt. 

You really have to work for the company for at least a few months to have the slightest comprehension of what‚Äôs really going on under all the public blanketing. 

And I don‚Äôt mean to sound like an asshole when I say this, but it‚Äôs true. "
"""between you and me"" and Reddit "
"I would love to have Spotify instead of Slacker. For those in markets with Spotify already, does signing into a premium account enable song selection and replay?"
"I‚Äôm sure they have thousands of these requests already over the years. 

My guess: they contractually can‚Äôt do anything due to contractual agreements with Slacker. Hopefully that agreement runs out soon!"
Slacker is complete fucking garbage. Music experience is a big thing for most people when riding in their car. Tesla needs to make this happen ASAP. They have a beautiful screen and I cant even use it to choose music. 
Tesla Sales Advisor here - tweeting directly to Elon is another great way to express your interest in adding features!
"People, the reason you have only Slacker is because Slacker is paying Tesla for an exclusive. No other explanation makes sense.

Give me my Google Play god dammit!"
"For what it‚Äôs worth, I just sent them a request."
If anything I hope they release it in the US so that they maybe start giving a crap about fixing the awfully buggy Spotify client. 
"Shout out from Europe...
First it would be great if they fixed several of the issues.

* Still can't play/track podcasts

* Audio disappears and jumps while in sync with the phone

* Spotify doesn't play while you have the app on the phone open at the same time

Just what I remembered...

Still better than nothing. "
"I don't even have my M3 yet and I'm joining in. Honestly I wish Tesla would just do what Sonos did. You can link your music services. It allows you to search through all of them for music. And you can add songs to a playlist from any of the music services you have.

This is exactly what I do with Sonos since I can't upload music to Spotify and stream it, unless my computer is connected to the same network. So I just use my Google play music for the songs I've uploaded and play it through the Spotify app"
"Shoot, I‚Äôd request for the Waze app to be added.

Edit: some words"
"I really want Apple Music, but it seems I‚Äôm the only one :("
"I have spotify on my car, it's a pretty terrible experience. The entire UI needs to be reworked, and support for spotify podcasts needs to be added still. I went back to using my phone.."
What about Apple Music?
Can I just get a service that doesn't keep playing the same 20 songs over and over and over and over again..... 
"+ Apple Music  
+ Google Music
+ Android Auto
+ Apple Carplay"
I want Google music.
"easy  solution, Add android/ios auto  to the system...  like other auto makers have figured out what people want? shoot even Toyota has begin to wake up"
"\*requests Apple CarPlay / Google Auto to have Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, iheart, audiobooks, podcasts, etc\*"
"More reason to have a Tesla...one day...p100d....cause 2.5s to 60 veyron is too expensive, but a tesla is more in the price bracket :D"
I'm pretty much at the point where if a car doesn't have apple or android carplay I wouldn't buy it. 
"It sucks when my TM 3 shows me connected by bluetooth to my phone's spotify premium. And there is no mo f***ing sound. Will flip through songs but no audio. Aargh!

This is what you get as part of your $5k PUP?
Connect  and  audio on my Prius 3? Yes, right away. On my bt headphones? Right away. On the TM3? Nope."
I fully expect them to switch over as soon as the Slacker contract is up unless Slacker makes them an offer they can't refuse.  
"Why not just add Apple Carplay, then you can use Spotify and whatever other music service desired"
I refuse to believe Elon musk doesn‚Äôt already know that we like Spotify much better.

"To be honest, Spotify has been nothing but a very buggy experience for me. I had to create a new account just for my car since my main account has apparently too many playlists and the car wasn‚Äôt able to log in 

Quality is also not the highest, I can hear a different between streaming and playing from a local usb 

I would rather prefer if they properly integrate Apple CarPlay"
Can that person just fucking speak in Engkish instead of academic language
I don't even own a tesla and I want this. What about audible also?
"Indian here, shot one to support you people who are suffering this mess.

If its a contract thing, hope this contract ends soon enough"
"I don't think Slacker is the problem. The way it functions in the car is. If it worked the same way on the Tesla interface as it does on phone/desktop, same as Apple/Google/Spotify, then it would be fine. Getting playlists, moving back and forth etc. is what is missing. An update that way seems the path of least resistance to me. CarPlay/AAuto would be great, but seems unlikely.

&#x200B;

I've audited every music service under the sun over the past 4 years, months at a time. I liked Slacker a lot, they were my silver medal to Google's gold. That included Youtube premium was unexpectedly great to me."

This is a solved problem.  CarPlay and Android auto are supported by almost every other vehicle on the market today.  You can use whatever service you want.  If they would just implement this all of these threads would cease to exist.
"Would be nice to get Pandora and Apple Music added also.  I don't use Spotify.

Honestly the current system works pretty well."
Going to send tesla customer support Spotify request 
"GUYS - if you're going to do this, it makes way more sense to just **request Apple CarPlay/Android Auto support**. This way, we'll all be covered no matter which music service we use. The current music tray could totally have a tab/mode for this."
How about we just get apple CarPlay instead? ;)

Personally I love Slacker. It's a breath of fresh air after listening to Spotify in the office all day to get a different variety of tunes. But I'll still play my part and send in a request for you guys!
Oh wow
"I don't have Tesla car, or doubt that I will ever be able to afford one in the future but yeah I am intrigued.  "
@ u/elonmusk 
"The 'ol feature request, eh?"
Dope. Goodluck guys I still gotta get a Tesla...
I emailed and will again.
"Yea I should do this. Slacker is garbage. I actually rather use my Google Play Music account than Spotify.

Slacker if you pick an artist will play a song or two sprinkled between others. After the third song by the artist it refuses to give you any more on that 'station'. I want to hear that not some other sorta close sounding based on genre. If it is on a fringe genre expect random songs that no DJ would ever play back to back.

I'll be happy to email once a week"
i want waze
"No one is going to like this, or believe it probably, but they‚Äôre doing what Tesla does for everything else: **they‚Äôre making their own music app.**

Trust me, Spotify isn‚Äôt coming to NA for Tesla cars. Slacker and Spotify support will be phased out entirely. "
"I don't own a Tesla, and never will be able to afford one, even if it does come to my country one day, but I sent them an email as well. I'll never be able to enjoy it, but at least you guys will."
spotify is currently broken for all UK tesla customers so... they should maybe fix that first.
"Would quite like Spotify to work, first. 80% of time it just fails for me, and one of the service centres outright said loads of problems with Spotify and v9. 

Symptom is that it simply won‚Äôt connect, followed by much random rebooting once it goes wrong - can‚Äôt discern a pattern. Rarely works on same day it originally failed as well. "
Emailed. 
Is Spotify already integrated into Tesla's in Europe and ROW?
I have sent my feature request emails!
"How about just opening up an App Store :) 
Then let the app devs make the platform amazing. 
It‚Äôs already a tablet on wheels... 
also, it‚Äôs service revenue for Tesla. Just saying."
Email sent.
Just wrote my feature request email! I hope everyone else does the same!
"God yes, do it.

Maybe when they'll have enough people complaining they will finally look into the crashfest that Spotify is (at least on v9/MCU1) and might upgrade the feature set out of 2012 (where are my daily mixes!?$..."
Here in Europe we have Spotify but it comes with a million buggs. Please fix this as well Tesla!
Emailed. 
Lol you want those shtty harassmental ads in ur heads? why not download it for free instead of paying them people for something more than netflix? (prior to hikes) 
"I wish you luck in your quest, but Spotify does nothing for me.  I wish this type of campaign effort were more inclusive.  Unless it incorporates google music/Android Auto, it won't benefit me and probably a lot of others who use some other service.

Again, I support it, but it would be nice if it was less specific to one service (even if it is the most popular, of which I have no clue about)."
Honestly best way is to probably tweet Elon.
"I got a  form  letter back but  I did it.

&#x200B;"
"Sent it to Spotify, they told they are not aware of it."
"Email sent! Thanks for posting this!

""Hello,

I'm writing to formally request that Spotify be added to all US Tesla vehicles. Tesla has not responded to multiple petitions by thousands of it's customers requesting that this feature be brought to the US market Teslas. It seems like it would be easy to add given that it is already available in oversea Teslas. Spotify is vastly superior to Slacker radio and offers a higher quality audio streaming bitrate for it's subscribing customers. Moreover, Spotify has SIGNIFICANTLY more users than Slacker by a large margin. 

Please bring Spotify to Tesla vehicles for US customers.

V/r,

Nathan (redacted)
Tesla Model 3 Owner""
"
Am I the only one who would like Pandora? Basically the same as Slacker but I would at least have my own curated stations...
Honest question: Why are people so intent on getting Spotify in their Teslas when you can just use your phone? 
"This is straight up silly. The only thing you should be begging for is Android Auto/Apple Carplay. Why get a crippled Spotify that will likely be buggy and not updated, when you can just use the Android Auto version, as well as thousands of other great AA apps. GM sells cars for like $14K with flawless Android Auto built in, most other manufacturers are in, Tesla can figure it out if consumers demand it."
"I hope we get Spotify. And by we I mean you guys as I don't own a Tesla or use Spotify. Just a loved software that clearly people want. I'm personally a YouTube Premium guy. I tried Spotify premium, but YouTube offered much more so went there.  "
"First, the operative word is free market. The rate of compensation for artists on Spotify is extremely low. 

Second, Yeah, Taylor Swift does well at concerts. However there‚Äôs far more artists out there that don‚Äôt pull in those crowds and this don‚Äôt make their money from concerts. 

You listen to music for free. But don‚Äôt forget about the amount of people it takes to create a song. Songwriters, producers, technicians, everyone is hurt by solely listening to music for free. 

Yeah, ok I don‚Äôt buy every song I listen to. But I do listen to stations that pay ascap and BMI license. I just know from musicians that Spotify doesn‚Äôt compensate like other delivery means. It‚Äôs like Napster. "
Or how about just supporting Android Auto.
I don‚Äôt want Spotify. I want Google Play/YouTube Music. Spread the word!
Why are you bothering customer service with this?  They have no idea why Spotify doesn't have a deal with Tesla.
I did my part. 
"Music quality is better when not going through Bluetooth. But I generally feel that it would be more convenient to select music from the main screen than having to pickup and unlock my phone every time. If it‚Äôs in the dock charging, it‚Äôs especially annoying. "
"Don't care about spotify, slacker is fine for me and substantially cheaper.  

Would much rather have carplay, or audible.com player, or just better bluetooth media support with playlist browsing and such.  "
I don‚Äôt really care for Spotify. Tesla should just provide their own music streaming service. They need to start creating revenue on software in general. Huge untapped potential that‚Äôs long overdue 
Sent.
On it
If I could afford a Tesla I‚Äôd be upset not having the Spotify app! 
Still waiting for spotify to support FLAC or some lossless format. Spotify's current audio quality is terrible... I'm still sticky to my auxiliary cable from my galaxy S7
I sent in a request for Apple Music integration (via MusicKit https://developer.apple.com/musickit/ )
My 1999 e46 has spotify onboard it haha. I can see why you guys would want it.
TIDAL would be nice.  The 3's premium speakers deserve better than spotify.  That being said I'd be happy to use spotify if it means I don't have to deal with slacker anymore.
Spotify uses non-free software which can spy on the user and send your car in a raging spiral off the freeway at 75 electric miles per hour.
Spotify hurts musicians. 
>Can afford a Tesla but cannot afford Apple Music
"I have it and I‚Äôm in the US. It‚Äôs even voice activated. ‚ÄúHey Siri open Spotify‚Äù

Works all the time!"
"""... and that kids, is how I got a Tesla employee fired""

&nbsp;

ok, probably not going to get someone fired, but if Tesla was sufficiently annoyed then they can identify the parties in this discussion from the email address following the ""via"" despite op's censoring. Those are auto generated and will be associated with the ticket in salesforce.

>According to the Ashlee Vance‚Äôs 2015 biography of the tech entrepreneur, Musk copied the text of the letter and pasted into a Word document, and checked the size of the file. He pored over the office‚Äôs printer activity logs, looking for a document that matched the one he had created. It‚Äôs not clear why this employee would print out the letter that appeared on Valleywag, but Musk‚Äôs hunch proved correct. He got a hit on the logs, and used that information to track down the person who carried out the printing job. The employee wrote a letter of apology and resigned.

>It‚Äôs no surprise that Musk decided to play detective and pursue the suspect in this mystery. And the employee was indeed a suspect, from the moment the 2008 letter became public. Like any business leader, Musk prizes loyalty among his employees. But for Musk, the actions of rogue employees aren‚Äôt evidence of workplace displeasure or disobedience (some of which are not unfounded‚ÄîMusk later confirmed the Tesla employee‚Äôs claim that the company was running on $9 million). They are, regardless of their motive, not just fireable offenses, but treason. Sabotage.

Obviously far from the same situation here."
 I had the same thought 
Enjoy broken Spotify if they ever change it.. my MS Spotify doesn‚Äôt work 50% of the time üòÖ 
I came here to post this
"I recently cancelled my Spotify premium because I can't use it in my Tesla. In the ""why did you quit"" feedback, I said I would subscribe again as soon as they are on Tesla.

For now I'm using Apple Music, since I can tell Siri what to play (and she even gets it right sometimes!) hands-free. Not my first choice, but it works. And it's like a zillion times better than Slacker.

Edit: also have Waze running on my phone. I use the screen for Navigation-on-autopilot, but keep Waze on my phone for useful notifications. It's kind of sad that I keep having to look at my tiny phone screen instead of the 17"" it is mounted in front of.
"
"Yea song selection, suggested and custom playlists, you can download the songs for when you're offline. My only complaint is they don't have some of the more obscure or early songs for artists

Edit: I misunderstood the original question. I'm talking about Spotify in general not in a European Tesla"
"Yes. song selection, no ads, higher quality streaming (if you choose), local downloads, and if you‚Äôre a student, you get Hulu too (it‚Äôs the plan with ads though) "
"I‚Äôm the car comes with a Tesla premium account, you don‚Äôt need to sign up to get song selection or replay. "
Yes. Just imagine a pretty fully featured Spotify client in your Tesla and that's basically what you get here in Europe. Some features are missing such as offline playback and playlist sorting but that's about it.
"Fuck spotify, you need the big 3. Google Music, Spotify and Apple Music"
"Tesla comes with a premium account, but you can also sign into your own to get your own playlists.

However, the in car app could be improved drastically, and lately it has been buggy. I hope spotify does come to the us cars, simply because it will force more development of the app and its reliability."
"> I‚Äôm sure they have thousands of these requests already over the years.

I guess that's true, but I also think the huge majority of complainers doesn't tell Tesla about it and keep it to themselves."
"> I‚Äôm sure they have thousands of these requests already over the years.

Let's get that into the hundreds of thousands."
"They literally provide a Spotify client for EU vehicles. The code to support Spotify has existed for many years, and owners have been emailing Tesla about it basically since Model S launched (there‚Äôs a huge thread on TMC about it back in the day with example letters to send, etc.). 

Given they could just allow owners to sign in with their own credentials and don‚Äôt have to pay for it themselves, the only real reason not to enable it here is that they signed a long-term exclusive contract with Slacker back in 2012. Maybe if we‚Äôre lucky it was an 8 year contract, which are fairly common, and we‚Äôll get Spotify in 2020. "
"In the meantime, email for more pressure!"
My CS rep one year ago when I picked up my car said they had a 4 year contract with Slacker.
The real question is how stupid and out of touch Tesla is for even considering Slacker! It has never been the top platform!
"Are radio stations independent? Because either they're influenced by each other or they have a small selection - I pick some barely-close music and end up getting music I swear would be from another radio that I liked ""over there"".

It just feels not intuitive to me.

For example if I start a playlist for Massive Attack on one channel, then Portishead comes on (which is fine) I thumbs it up.  
Then I start a Boards of Canada radio, and eventually Portishead comes on. Wtf?"
This. Well said. 
When I picked up my Model 3 one year ago I asked about the music streaming and he said Tesla had a 4 year contract with Slacker.  So.... maybe 3 more years of this junk-ass music streaming and perhaps something better will appear in an update.
The Model 3 infotainment system is horrible yet like you wrote beautiful. Phone integration is horrendous. I use my phone on a mag mount for infotainment and just leave the Model 3 screen on rear view camera since the actual rear view mirror is obstructed by the rear shelf and trunk.
"Can't you play music from a USB stick? Real music, not nasty lossy compressed junk."
Send the email
You can choose music.  I'm not sure where the issue is.  You can play any song you want.
I want YouTube Music support
Did this... was ignored. Will try again. 
This...
"Went straight to the source, will check back in if I get through."
Done. Don't own a Tesla and never will be able to afford one. Put my part in so maybe one day one of you lucky bastards will give me a ride.
"Did just this, wrote:

> @elonmusk Huge Tesla fan, it would be fantastic to get @Spotify as an option in my #TeslaModelS as an and/or to Slacker. Thanks so much!"
"It feels so stupid to have to steam Google Play from your phone, right?"
Can we crowd fund our way out of this agreement?
And Tesla is out of touch for signing up with them.
Isn't Google Play Music is being closed down and rolled into YouTube Music? 
"Pretty sure the payment direction is the other way around, Tesla is known to be a huge portion of Slacker's revenue.

I'd be happy to continue to pay my Spotify premium fees, and let Tesla reduce costs by not having to pay for Slacker in Spotify-enabled accounts."
At least people won‚Äôt spam that address to ask Elon to host meme review...
"I just sent one in, too. "
"Sounds just like usual Spotify bugs, not Tesla bugs..."
"Australia here: Spotify is broken and literally unusable since about October. Forgets login, freezes etc. be careful what you wish for!!"
"You can use the Tesla account and have both your phone and car play simultaneously. Haven't tried playing podcasts, but I find it strange if it won't play them. As long as they are listed they should be OK?   


What is worse is that the whole app is a simplified version of the real Spotify app. And it is buggy as hell. Specially when on a poor network or when booting up your car in the morning. Some functionality, like listening to a song in a playlist won't give you the ability to jump to that artist or album, would be nice to have in the car too. Or the ability to create playlists.   


If the US get Spotify, maybe there's more pressure to enhance the app too? I'm all for it! If this rant sounds negative, don't be alarmed. All in all Spotify in my Tesla is awesome! I bitch because I care."
That'd be great. Sonos is a fantastic product all around. 
[deleted]
"Enabling Spotify on North American cars is simple since it's already built into the firmware of the vehicle. In lieu of new apps, I think it'd be better for Tesla to focus on adding support for CarPlay and Android Auto. That way any app that supports one of those platforms will work. From what I understand of the two platforms, they're not that complicated."
"Waze features are being ported over to Google Maps so if they're just using the Google Maps API, I wonder if they also make reporting and such things available for devs to use. "
"That's something different. Pretty sure that will come at some point. Maybe not Waze specifically, but some kind of app store. Thinking an app store is not on their backlog is just unrealistic. Guess they have more important stuff to do right now (implementing Atari games ;) no seriously, it might very well be that those were already used to build some of the code base for it)"
You‚Äôre not fellow Apple Music user. There are dozens of us!
I want it too. But if Tesla adds Spotify I‚Äôll switch to iTunes Match to preserve my library ($20/year) and switch to Spotify. 
I would love that!!! Plus 1 for /r/Apple Music
nope. need AM in the Model 3 for sure. Spotify is just as useless to me as Slacker.
You're not.  I emailed them asking for Apple Music. 
I want it too. It would be perfect if I could log into my Apple Music account on it. 
"I would love Apple Music or Pandora or, if I have to, Spotify.  Slacker is meh and poorly instrumented in the UI."
An apple music interface on the 3 screen would be absolutely killer 
"Need Google, Apple and Spotify to start. "
"As an Apple Music subscriber, I‚Äôm with you!"
I want it too.
I have been very happy with Apple Music.
You mean tesla owners like more than 20 songs? Not according to the Favorites channel. 
so true
"For me:

Apple Music
Podcast Syncing
Easy Text Messaging 

These are basically the only things I‚Äôm missing. CarPlay does offer them ‚Äì but what user interface would even work with it. 

I would settle with Apple Music and maybe a 3rd party podcast app to track progress. "
I really don't get why people want Android Auto and CarPlay.  The Tesla UI already does everything those can do. (minus messaging).
CarPlay in my electric Smart Car is amazing. But could you imagine how terrible that UI would be blown up on a Tesla screen would be lol. Or equally as bad looking a floating window.
agreed!
Isn't that dead or in process of getting killed off? 
"CarPlay would be nice. For such an advanced machine, it‚Äôs disappointing that Chevrolet‚Äôs have better integration with your phone. "
Why hasn't anyone asked at shareholder meeting about slacker contract?
"I think I read the Slacker contract is up this year? I‚Äôve been thinking the same thing. Once that‚Äôs done, they‚Äôll switch over to Spotify. "
More customers is the offer they can't refuse. They should be letting Slacker die a slow death. If they get out of that back room and actually pay attention to what the public uses to stream they'll talk to Spotify whom I'm sure would love to be in any car they can.
I really hope they don‚Äôt. Tesla should create their own service 
Speak for yourself.  Spotify sucks
"""Spotify plz"" that'll be $5"
"I just sent this:

>Hello,

>I'm sure y'all have gotten a few of these today, but just want to chime in that I would also love to have Spotify in my American Model 3! Slacker is...not useful for me and I end up having to stream Spotify from my phone anyway.

It's kinda short and bland, but... ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
backroom deals
Android Auto/CarPlay would support this.
Yep Spotify would be just as useless to me as Slacker. I want Apple Music.
i don‚Äôt think this is possible without hardware upgrade. also i don‚Äôt need that. just give me spotify
">Does the right scroll wheel do anything right now?

It adjusts the speed for autopilot/cruise control."
I had the same thought as you. I sent one for spotify and one for using the left stalk button as a modifier.
slacker has terrible song discovery algorithm
"No ads if you have premium. Quality/bitrate on all free services (Pandora, Spotify and slacker) sucks so there's no reason to use it for that reason alone. "
"Many reasons.

* It's illegal to ~~operate your phone~~ *interact with your phone screen* in traffic in many jurisdictions
* The Model 3 phone holder is much lower than the screen and requires moving your eyes much farther off the road
* Phone screens are much smaller than the Tesla touchscreen, resulting in smaller touch targets
* Stream compression + Bluetooth results in inferior audio quality than stream compression alone.

EDIT: first bullet"
Found the Blizzard employee. 
"> but YouTube offered much more so went there. 

Are you like my dad? Just miss the MTV era and want music videos? ;) "
"agreed on GPM, yes!"
"Well, it's not really an argument for Spotify specifically out of all streaming services out there. It's mainly because Spotify is already built into the infotainment system, but just disabled in the US. Some people who hacked their cars already enabled it. So adding Spotify is basically a flip of the switch for Tesla, everything else would require a lot more work to get the devs to build new apps just for Tesla."
Probably because it's a customer service issue. It's not like anyone else is going to respond. 
Because serving the customers is what they do
i agree with this exact point.   doing from main screen much easier.
Because it‚Äôs crap. Spotify is more expensive because it‚Äôs better.
"Exactly. How about we just don‚Äôt lock down the infotainment system at all and do what nearly every other manufacturer does and offer CarPlay, Android Auto, and/or something that lets you run a variety of apps?"
Premium Spotify is 192kbps iirc. Not awful 
No. Musicians aren't required to be on spotify. It's a free market. 
"How so? Don't they make most of their money through concerts anyways? If Spotify gives them exposure, then people are more likely to go to their concerts. Correct me if I'm wrong. "
"Having it built into the car is a lot better than using it on your phone through Bluetooth without a decent codec like Apt-x. Plus controlling it is easier from a large tablet than from your phone, which is resting in the holder..."
derp
"I don't get it, why would Tesla fire that Customer Service rep for saying that?"
Yeah I am surprised they don‚Äôt have DNS configured to hide the Salesforce address
"They can now search for that text on their customer service/CRM tool and find who sent that. Poor guy. 
Given said that, I have bitched and moan about Spotify everywhere, but have never sent them a formal email. May be we should do just that. "
This is going to be a great scene in the movie.
I call BS on that story anyways... No way you would write a letter like that to the press and then print it out at work. Musk probably had a strong hunch who it was and bluffed them.
That‚Äôs incredible. What an upgrade that would be. Thanks for the info!
You cannot download songs offline...
Wait how can you download song in Spotify ? Never saw that in my S.
Can you listen to full albums?
"The more obscure and early songs issue is one of the reasons why I cancelled my Spotify and got Google Play Music. Not because Google play has them in their cloud library, but because you can upload 50,000 of your own content to your music library. I have lots of custom remixes and my own personal tracks that I've uploaded to my library that even works with my home assistant to where I can say ""Alexa, 'play custom title song' by 'my name'"". Would be very awesome if my Tesla can also do that someday."
"I don't have a slacker account and my Tesla will play any song I request. (USA).

Go out to your Tesla, hit the voice command button and say  ""Play Africa by Toto"" and a few seconds later, it will play."
"I don't think there is a single Hulu plan without ads anymore, regardless of what you pay."
They are currently paying for data streaming on most  cars on the road. 
"When did slacker first show up? I assume with the first model S cars in 2012 (meaning the 4yr contract would have been up in 2016). But I'm new to Tesla, so not sure when it showed up. "
"Probably cost. Back when Tesla was a fledgling company, Slacker probably game them a sweetheart of a deal versus any other music streaming company. "
They probably would have gone out of business at this point without Tesla's deal.
"Many radio stations are run via robots. Look up Clear Channel aka iHeartMedia. Over 800 stations across the US.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartMedia"
I think he was telling you you have 4 years included. Which is what they‚Äôve been saying since 2014 or so.

What mount are you using?
"Speaking of USB music, I‚Äôd love if it would continue playing from USB whenever I get in the car (like Bluetooth does), so I wouldn‚Äôt have to go in and select the source from the menu every time. Honestly my least favourite thing about the car."
Yes but who has time for that? Spotify 320kbps  quality sounds great in my model S 
"Not if you want to charge a phone, and use the dash cam, and play music.  "
"Are you suggesting I BUY my music?!

Nuh uh. Streaming is the only way for me."
"Agreed with your 100% accurate assessment that USB media is higher quality than streaming and/or Bluetooth. But the Media Player  has lots of bugs for USB playback. Plus, it lacks a polished set of features to make listening to music and selecting playlists easily."

"That explanation makes no sense. If Tesla is paying Slacker, then they are stupid. And I think Tesla is not stupid."
"That's the most annoying thing on Twitter. I understand Elon likes memes and jokes around with tweets here and there, but any tweet he puts out people bombard him with bad memes/unfunny responses that are very cringe."

There's a t-shirt slogan if I've ever heard one."
"It doesn't list the podcasts... And all my library is in my personal account, so it doesn't really help as I keep adding music if I listen to the empty tesla account...

I know, first world problems. "
"App Store would be nice but I don‚Äôt think it is feasible.  

Developers would have to create their apps specifically for the Tesla Model 3 interface.  This is often unappealing at first (for devs) so even if a App Store is made it would take awhile for creators to start making apps for it.  Same thing happened to the Windows and Android app stores initially. 

I just like Waze. I don‚Äôt understand why more vehicle manufactures aren‚Äôt trying to utilize it."
This! It would propel Tesla so far ahead of the competition if they were to ever allow basic app functionality.
Or just add CarPlay and Android Auto support like every other modern car
Or just Android Auto support which would be minimal work on Tesla's part and accomplish all of these goals
"Do you really think, that's not on Tesla's backlog? I'd be very surprised if they don't plan anything in that direction.

You remember [V10 will bring video streaming](https://electrek.co/2018/08/19/tesla-video-streaming-feature-to-center-screen-version-10-elon-musk/)? That might already bring an app store or the basics for it."
Android Auto and CarPlay would be dead simple to implement. They just don't want to since they like the lock-in. 
Just sent an email suggesting exactly this. Would be so great to have!
I did see that Google Maps finally added the speed limit on their app. It would be nice to see other Waze like features implemented.
Why preserve your library for 20 bucks a yeat if you now have Spotify 
AM in most EVs is pretty tough - the motors interfere with it.
If apple designed it it could be
"Presumably apps and, well, messaging."
"So that they can use whatever app they want that supports those two platforms. Tesla's UI is definitely the best manufacture infotainment UI by far, but navigation will probably never be as good as Google Maps and they'll likely never get an app store. With AA or CarPlay you can have your padcast app, eBook app, or whatever and have an actual UI on the screen for them. I'm not sure about CarPlay but Android Auto is even going to (at some point) gain support for different screen shapes and sizes than the one it currently supports.

&#x200B;

Also, AA and CarPlay run on the phone and are streamed to the car. MCU1 is pretty slow, so having the phone do the rendering and just streaming it as an MP4 stream allows nice smooth rendering even on MCU1. "
"I can pick songs from my phones library on the Tesla screen and play it? I can see who sent me a text? The Tesla UI has maps, how else is it anything like CarPlay. My head unit that was in my 1998 ford escort had better connectivity to my phone than a Tesla does. "
"> The Tesla UI already does everything those can do.

Like opening Waze or Spotify, calling someone with WhatsApp, or listening to Podcasts?"
I used CarPlay once in a rental and it was such a terrible experience. 
"I don‚Äôt want CarPlay, but AM integration to replace slacker would be fabulous."
It will be discontinued in favor of Youtube Music at some point. They haven't said when that point will be though. 
"should be but google is dumb as fuck. i have switched over due to me losing my grandfathered plan. Previously when you subscribed to one of their services you add access to youtube/google play/ youtube music. Now  they have google play separate from youtube all together.

what sucks is google play music still has podcast some better features over youtube music. Though youtube music did just update a few weeks ago with up to par design. so it does look much better then before  


Only reason i use youtube music is because it comes with youtube premium. I watch a lot of youtube so those features are important to me."
Google Music now. YouTube Music later when they switch.
"Even if it's neither, Google kills off so many programs and does it so often that it's not a good idea to adopt them.  Even the ones they probably won't officially cancel like maps are increased in costs so much everyone (including Tesla) is abandoning them."
"No, its not. and not even close."
Too busy trying to get Elon to commit to leather-free gear shifters. Not sarcastic.
Nobody knows. 
"Why?  I already pay for Spotify Premium so I can listen to whatever I want on all of my devices.  I don't want to 1) (maybe) pay for yet another service, 2) re-curate my music collection and playlists just for Tesla's service, or 3) deal with the inevitably smaller selection than Spotify"
"I would hate for that to happen, Tesla doesn't have the money to license all of the music that they would need, they would also have to do hosting and a whole bunch of other service pieces that they are not setup for."
Found the Slacker employee
How so?
Venmo request me

"Above and beyond, way to go!"
"I think really it's all or nothing.  Giving user just one choice irks people who don't want to sign up for yet another streaming service.

Surprised no one has mentioned Tidal yet."
"Oh ok cool well if YOU use Spotify then Tesla should just focus on that, because you are literally the only use case Tesla should ever consider, amirite? \*eyeroll\*"
Oh yeah! Just so instinctual I can't even remember how I do it. 
"> Stream compression + Bluetooth results in inferior audio quality than stream compression alone.

Good point, this is the most significant IMO
"
Great list. #4 is the biggest one for me. 
I also find that voice commands on phones are more temperamental when trying to unlock via voice.
I manage to not touch my phone while driving. I just put on a playlist or podcasts and I‚Äôm good. Or if I really need to I can ask Siri to play whatever. Also works fine.
"Uh where can you not even interact with your phone screen? You need GPS. Being on your phone and texting is one thing but hands on the wheel and phone on the dash letting you keep your eyes on the road while using periphrials to operate the map is hardly a problem. It's done all the time with the buttons on an ICE console anyway. Most people don't have button locations memorized and they're looking at their info display with periphrials as well.

If you can operate the Tesla screen while driving you can operate the damn phone lol. The Tesla screen is just a giant phone. "
"YouTube Premium has a Service with it called YouTube Music. It is basically identical to Spotify, but it uses Google Algorithms(the reason I switched) and uses YouTube videos as well. So In my eyes it just means I get fed more stuff I like, popular music disappears for me(HATED Spotify sending me trendy rap, when I listen to 0 of it) And as I said it does the YT videos so I not only have every song on Spotify, but old songs the rights couldn't be obtained for, remixed that wouldn't pass, covers, and independents. 

Edit: I want to clarify, there are 3 songs I really like and STILL are not on Spotify, all 3 on YT and now I can listen to them. "
Where does it say that in their name?
Spotify is crap üí© 
"Cool. If you want it, keep asking for it.  I personally don't see anything spotify offers that seems worth the extra money but to each their own. 

Does the Spotify implementation in the car even *support* the features people are all hot and bothered about? "
"Why?  Serious.  Why?  My mom has CarPlay in her CR-V.  It's LIGHTYEARS better then the standard Honda UI.

But better then what Tesla has?  No fucking way.  Even with how terrible V9 is, I still prefer it over CarPlay."
Actually it's 320kbps
"Yup, sorry, I tried to make a bad joke."
"I was mostly joking, and I don't really expect them to be fired, but I don't expect Tesla would train it's employees to take the route this CS rep is suggesting, which is basically ""whip up a social media thing"" and is what the OP is doing with this thread. 

I should add that I'm not saying there's any ill intent by anyone here."
They've fired others for less....
Because his grammar is terrible.
Welcome! It's great and they have a free trial period. Go for it!
"It's incorrect info.  That feature set is for the *phone app*, not the in-car version."
I didn't say that. I said you can download songs for when you are offline. Meaning download them when you have internet connection clearly
You can't. No idea what they are talking about. 
You can't.  The person who said this was talking about the phone app.
"Yeah probably a vast majority of all popular albums are available, including new releases. I just make a bunch of playlists and download them for offline use and then my wife uses it ‚Äúonline‚Äù. "
[deleted]
"On my way home today I told my Model 3, ""Play Pink Floyd One of These Days."" It played Money instead. I tried again, then it played Wish You Were Here. So I went to my Amazon Music and played it over Bluetooth. Slacker sucks."
Paying for a modern online streaming service that still has ads is the stupidest thing ever. Only place where I would be ok to to sit through ads is if the service is free or if it's live TV.
Slacker was available at Model S launch in 2012. 
I think he meant Slacker channels
"Yeah like the other person said, I was referring to the person I replied to in saying stations as in Slacker channels."
Good bot
"I need to post up a video. I placed mine by the cup holder and console. It's a stick on from target. I love it because the phone is right there by your hand. I don't like the Tesla cubby because it's too far away.

  


Sorry I don't have product info."
Lol  Looks like I got downvoted by a nasty lossy compression fan.  Just seems a shame to feed that into a good audio system.
well you could use the 12v plug to charge the phone
"That's not for me to say, but my raid box is stuffed to the gills with cdda, dvda, hdcd, sacd, and all in original formats.  My phone gets the ogg lossy compressed stuff, not that ancient mpeg 1 audio layer 3 stuff. Nothing like some good 24 bit stuff cranked up for my neighbors to enjoy. Mp3 is like watching worn out VHS tapes. Sorry for those who can't hear the difference."
"> Slacker is fucking horrible.

But it is free, and there's nothing stopping you from using your phones to stream whatever you want.

"
"You can't with the *free* version using the Tesla account. If you buy a premium subscription, you can add albums and skip/pause/restart songs. It's a free, stripped down version of the service.

&#x200B;"
"Plus it's so much more fiddly to mess with it on your phone. Smaller screen, smaller keyboard, and a battery that can die. It would be so much better built into the car."
"But we're not paying for an app, we're paying to get rid of one. Hahaha I would love a customizable platform."
"I'd actually be overjoyed at the ability to pay for apps on my infotainment system.

$30 for a Spotify app? Done. $50 a native ""ABetterRoutePlanner""? Deal"
I would rather just pay for my own internet honestly and not be limited by random decisions.
"What would not make sense is slacker giving away free service, or actually paying Tesla to take their service, for the entire Tesla fleet what is what you're suggesting. "
He sais it‚Äôs done.   It‚Äôs just not released yet.
"Yes it does! I can play on my Sonos and still go on my mobile. Or play on computer and then go on mobile to change track.

  
"
"Ja, checked myself yesterday. It doesn't find any podcasts, but have them as a search result filter nontheless. Weird. Have you tried playing one using your phone as a ""remote""?"
This was on the road-map before.  Model S use to have an empty Apps tab.
"A lot of vehicles come with Android Auto and Apple Carplay now, which does allow you to use Spotify and Waze. Developers have the benefit of not needing to create a special app for every car, just one for iPhone and one for Android. I think Tesla could implement this if they wanted to, have Auto/Carplay display like the map does now. You get full access to all the Tesla stuff, and all the benefits like Waze and Spotify that Auto and Carplay provide."
"I mean, with the UI unification it‚Äôs definitely feasible. We‚Äôll just have to wait and see. "
Request was sent 
I think there are a fair amount of developers that own a Tesla and probably have an app or something they want for their car so it might not be hard to get an app store going
They want to own the data rather than give it to Waze?
"Or, Tesla could get its head out of its ass and implement Android Auto, which would open the full gamut of apps for the information center."
"People said the original iPhone app store would go down in flames too. If Tesla takes a more Apple-y approach (strict rules on what gets in the store, but help developers who pay for the SDK get their apps fleshed out) to it versus a free-for-all, it could do well.
"
"Google maps is better. Waze is full of in-map ads, lots of UI clutter, and pop-ups"
No I definitely do think it is. I mentioned it to the mods just the other day that I think it‚Äôs something being worked. 
"I really wish Waze had the ""you must be in this lane"" feature for turns."
Like where the nearest Taco Bell is without you asking or a million inaccurate markings popping up constantly by other users? Fuck Waze. They need to be extremely careful about what they port over.
"Because I‚Äôd like to access my library over the cloud. I have thousands of songs not available on Spotify, including my own music I‚Äôm working on and it takes 1 second to sync it with iCloud and $20/ year is nothing. "
Lol
"Nah, just need the music. "
"I know it's just one of your points, but you realize that the built-in nav _is_ Google Maps, right?"
"MCU1 is a shrinking minority, so you won't see it on that.  MCU2 is plenty fast.

The Tesla MCU OS already has a podcast app."
Honestly Tesla's UI is way way better than Android Auto. I can't imagine CarPlay is any differnet.
What do you listen to on AM radio? Is your AM radio station not available in the built in streaming?
And YouTube Music will be killed off in 5 years in favor of Google Maps Music.
"It wont, count on it."
"Sorry I only have cash app. But if you download it we both get $5! Then, you send me $5 and you technically didn't lose any money. (think I'm on to something here) "
Didn‚Äôt they can it?
Yeah adding support for all major ones would be great. No one option will make everyone happy.
well i am the center of my universe
"I don‚Äôt think this is the case anymore. Sure, in the early days of Bluetooth audio (A2DP) you‚Äôd be getting SBC compression which was sub 128kbit MP3 quality commonly. But now all newer phones and cars use the AAC codec over Bluetooth, which I believe is just a straight bitstream from your audio source on the phone. "
Not as crappy as slackerüí©üí©
"I think it‚Äôs less about the features, and more about not having to hear the same 10 songs when I select a station."
Yep! You can select individual songs from an album iirc. Probably add playlists and such too.
"The option to use integrated third party apps (like Spotify and Waze) is the big reason for me. Can‚Äôt speak for anyone else. 

Edit: So I don‚Äôt inherently want a CarPlay interface, I agree Tesla default is better. I just want to be able to use the apps I want so if that ability could be worked into the current system, even better."
"Even better! I think premium Slacker account is comparison is only 128kbps. That's what I read somewhere. Maybe that is limited by Tesla in car. I paid $12 for 6 months of premium Slacker on Groupon versus paying $10 a month...

    Edit: this site says Slacker is limited by Tesla to 160kbps. Shitty. https://teslatap.com/articles/streaming-audio/

"> I don't expect Tesla would train it's employees to take the route this CS rep is suggesting, which is basically ""whip up a social media thing"" and is what the OP is doing with this thread.

I've heard Tesla people recommend using the tweet at Elon method."
This is probably a copy pasta with the intent of being shared - because it makes Tesla look good for wanting to listen to customer feedback. Tesla in no way looks bad here. 
now you've jinxed it and there will be firing.
"I‚Äôm in the US where we have Slacker. üò©

Was trying to see if we would get a true version of Spotify or if it would be feature reduced. Sounds pretty commensurate to actual Spotify, though! "
I know. You cannot do that. Your Spotify will not work when you are offline. 
"It's not that bad.  Everyone is different but given the free options, I'll take what slacker offers up ad free over listening to ads in Spotify free.

I wish they would integrate Amazon Music, or Pandora, or Apple Music.

My real wish (that will almost certainly never happen) would be MLB network, so I could stream MLB games radio broadcast audio.  I'm sure other sports fans would like a NHL or NBA or NFL or MLS app access also."
"I don't consider Slacker to be generic 'radio'. Radio commonly specifically means AM/FM/SW. Slacker might 'Internet Radio' but not generic radio. Hence the confusion.

P.S. yes I know cell phones have cellular radios in them. Those radios are not included in the colloquial definition of radio used by Average Joe.


"
What if I want to stream Tidal? Lol. Get off the high horse
"Oh, so don't use the dock that is touted as a feature of the car?  Makes sense."
"Then they clearly need to advertise the premium version better. I've never heard anything except complaints about limitations with the version that comes with the car, and had *never heard of* the premium version at all. I assumed Slacker was just what I got with my car."
"My version will replay a requested song about once every 30 minutes or hour.  I don't have slacker premium. I have whatever came with the car.

I'm wondering if the more recent a song is, the longer it will take to replay.   I don't listen to much current music."
I think sonos might be different in how it registers two devices. If I have Spotify playing on my tv and then play music on an echo the tv stops. Same with desktop. 
"If you tap, it will open on Tunein and not all of them are available. To listen to my podcasts, I use my phone and Bluetooth the audio to the car.

Los of quality and the controls are not the same, but I've been surviving. "
This is the right solution. Integrate CarPlay and Android Auto and you‚Äôve solved it for almost everyone. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs 2019 and they‚Äôre still sitting on this decision.
"People made and sold apps just to run in the Model S browser. If a real third party ecosystem was developed, there‚Äôd definitely be interest. 

Despite promising 3rd Party apps were on the way for the Model S back in 2014, they slowly backed away from that over the following year or two and haven‚Äôt mentioned it since. "
"Sounds like you haven‚Äôt really used Waze. 

The ‚Äúinaccuracy‚Äù is caused by users not removing icons when the hazards are cleared.  That‚Äôs not the apps fault because it‚Äôs not the one placing any of the icons, we do.  The more people who contribute than the more accurate the hazards will be.

The ads pop up when you are completely stopped (at a stop light for example) and immediately goes away once you move.  Sure ads are annoying, no normal person would say otherwise, but i feel like their implementation is not that bad.  In order for their app to be free and to be able to make updates, they must make money somewhere.  Pretty common business model.

But with that said, I know JVC car displays and now Ford is adding Waze.  I doubt their Waze apps have ads because they probably have a contract together but I‚Äôm not positive."
"when you're not doing anything, you should upload all that music to Google Music as well, to have a backup. You get 50,000 songs free. Will probably take a while to upload all of that though."
"But Google music will sync your music for free...up to 20,000 songs. Why would you pay Apple $20? Same for photos. iDrones really need to research the alternatives."
"Map data is, but routing is not. "
pretty inferior version unfortunately
"The speed was only one of my points, but you're right. 

&#x200B;

And maybe you don't want that podcast app, maybe you want your own one that you also use on your phone?"
Really? Tesla's UI for Google Play Music is better than Android Auto's? I didn't know they even had one! Excited to use it when I buy my Tesla in the next few months!
"I meant Apple Music integration.  I‚Äôd love to be able to browse my music via playlists, versus just having the Bluetooth integration..."
">I really hope they don‚Äôt. Tesla should create their own service

i mean like, that kinda sounds cool."
Savvy
"Maybe the quality isn't off, but if I'm ever watching videos on my phone or tablet and connected to my car's Bluetooth, the audio is always lagging by .5-1 second. I wonder if there is a fix. In my Corolla I had the option to use bluetooth or alternatively use direct USB, and with direct USB there was never a lag.  "
"It def. is still the case.  Try streaming a song via BT from your phone, then play the same exact song thru the native Slacker interface on the main screen.   Audio difference very noticeable.   "
Stop listening to the same artists.  Branch out a bit.
"Neat. I'd pay $2-3 a month for that but I can't say it'd be worth $10 to me. I'm cheap, though. "
">Sounds pretty commensurate to actual Spotify, though!

The response you got was not specific to Tesla, that's why.  The person who told you this is thinking of the phone app and gave you bad info, as the car version is not the same.   
 Just fyi."
Maybe we're talking about different applications here. I realized I misunderstood the original question. I'm just talking about the phone app not the European version in a Tesla
"But I don't want a free option.  I already pay for Spotify, I want to use it.

Don't you think starting a song over is a pretty basic feature."
Only free for 1 year with my model 3. So ya if I‚Äôm paying $100 a year to have my car connected to the internet I should be able to use Spotify or a better music listening application instead of the $100 just being used for map.
"It's not actually free. Tesla is paying for a subscription for each and every car. Not only that, but it's an exclusivity deal that prohibits Tesla from running other music streaming apps in their cars in the U.S."
"It's not a radio. But they refer to channels as ""stations"" on the UI, and as far as colloquial discussion you may hear ""radio station"" to mean a Slacker channel, or Spotify station, in the same way that ""Rewind"" is still used as a term on Netflix and modern video."
"Nope. The dock sucks. Also the low-current USB ports are not ideal for charging.

I use the huge screen for maps and car settings. The music offerings are just not good. I use a  12V charger for my phone. I bluetooth music from my phone.
"
"Yeah, if you go to Slacker.com, you can upgrade to Premium for $9.99/mo. Inside the car, you can replace the Tesla account credentials with your new login/password. It's not the best deal and I hate having multiple services (as I already have Amazon Prime Music), but if you drive a lot, it makes it much less frustrating."
"Premium version gives you the things you're looking for.  I caved after a few weeks with the Tesla-provided Slacker subscription and purchased my own premium account.  I can play albums, play only songs from a single artist, build playlists on computer which show up in car, etc.   Shame I had to spend that money, but for as much time as I spend in car, I felt it was needed."
"There certainly does appear to be licensing that interferes with a percentage of albums or songs, particular very popular ones. It happens much less with Premium, but some songs/albums can't be added for unlimited listening. "
Yes off cause if you play music in two. But that's not the problem. Problem is that you can't open Spotify on phone while Spotify plays music on Tesla.
They don't want to send their data to Google or apple.
"But guess what Google maps give me ZERO ads and because the markings are mostly useless in Waze it's a useless feature. I don't give a shit whose fault it is that's completely irrelevant. It doesn't work well so it's garbage. I can't mind control users to not be ass at marking correctly so I'm stuck with their spam if I make the mistake of launching Waze.

Google Maps doesn't suck like Waze does. Google bought Waze and I hope they just stick to the few rare features that were better in Waze (like the newly added speed limit thing).

The ads aren't acceptable. You know they make money off your anonymous usage data just like Google does. Google owns Waze so they obviously don't need the ads to survive."
I have it saved on multiple hard drives. I just used iTunes Match (before switching to Apple Music) to not have to manually sync. But thanks!
Google does not store high res photos
"Why? I have google music. I don‚Äôt like it. I like iTunes. I like my music app. I like telling siri to play an album, I like storing that music on my watch. 

Also, google photos only stores compressed, so I use that to share processed photos, I have to look at other places to store my raw images. 

Fuck off with your android fanboy bullshit. "
I prefer the one on my phone.  It has 1.5 & 2x playback.  Just stream it through bluetooth.  Work great.
You can stream it over Bluetooth.
"oh no there's no interface for GPM lol just generally using it. Our Subaru has Android Auto and honestly half the time I don't even use it if I'm only gonna be driving for half an hour, I just use bluetooth."
You can notice the poor quality by adjusting the volume on your phone actually adjusts the volume in the car.  I always leave my phone‚Äôs volume at 80% because otherwise it starts clipping/static.  My old Hyundai had better streaming support from my phone.
Yeah Slacker is garbage no contest
It‚Äôs literally the 80‚Äôs 90‚Äôs and today station. Same shit every day.
The Slacker playlists have like 20 songs on them 
I'd pay zero for that feature.  The setup with slacker is fine.
Thanks for this info! Appreciate it!
"We *are* talking about different applications - you're in the Tesla sub.  The question you originally responded to specifically asked about signing into Spotify from the car, not from the phone.  You responded with features that only exist in the mobile (phone) app, and folks are thinking you're referring to Spotify in Tesla, which is different."
Ha! We've gone at it before lol.  I remember thinking regardless of our differing opinions you have a phenomenal username.
"> colloquial discussion you may hear ""radio station"" to mean a Slacker channel, or Spotify station

I guess I haven't heard it used this way. I know I wouldn't do it.

>""Rewind"" is still used as a term on Netflix and modern video.

I'm familiar with this."
"The way I looked at it, the money I reclaimed from cancelling SXM in the ICE car I had been driving went right into the premium account with Slacker...    Agree with you about paying for 2 services.   I have Google Play Music and Slacker Premium.   Would ditch GPM but my daughter loves the YouTube premium that comes with it."
"Why not just use Bluetooth off your phone? That's what I do, and it works great for the podcasts I listen to."
"Ok, I might also have misunderstood that. Sounds definitely wrong. But not too different from the bugs I usually experience with Spotify on my computer + mobile phone + amazon echo. Discovering a new bug about every day :P"
"Which data? Location? If you have your phone on you, Apple/Google already knows your location if you‚Äôve given that permission. Plus Tesla uses Google maps so Google probably already knows where each Tesla is at any time already.

I don‚Äôt know if any other information leaks from Car to Apple. Not sure about google. I remember reading BMW was hesitant to implement Android Auto because they required deep hooks into the car state."
"Again, it comes down to users not knowing how to use the app.  You can simply turn off each type of notification per your desire.  You can have just the cops and traffic if you wanted; which I‚Äôd assume is what people mainly look for.  The app is super customizable.

If you don‚Äôt turn them off and use it normally, you can hit the delete bubble icon to get rid of the notifications for drivers behind you.  If you think that‚Äôs too much of a hassle then you‚Äôre creating the same aggravation for other people and maybe the app isn‚Äôt for you."
They do
But it would be even more great if you could see the UI of the app on the car's screen through Android Auto
"You don't get the UI and controls for it, just very basic currently playing and forward/back controls"
"I use Android Auto in my existing car every single day and like it 100% more than Bluetooth. I'm not going to subscribe to Slacker, and Spotify isn't available in the US so I'm probably just going to mount my phone, which sucks, cause I had to stop doing that years ago in my current car when I installed an Android Auto capable head unit. "
"Every so often I want to hear a specific song that I don't already own, which means pulling up youtube or something right now.  "
No problem.  I had to say something as the original response was not only incorrect but highly upvoted.
"Yes, I've already made an edit to my original comment to clarify that so they can refer to that and the comment I just made."
"Actually I see in the Tesla UI it literally says ""[band name] Radio"", so it's used by the UI itself, not just colloquially. "
When I noticed the difference in audio quality I knew it would drive me crazy.   I want it to sound the best that it possibly can.   Had I never noticed that I'd likely still be streaming via BT.
"If Tesla really uses Google maps, I wish they'd fire the incompetent navigation voice and use Google's."
"That's exactly it, as far as I had read the reason why many manufacturers were so hesitant is because of the hooks into the car information. Apparently Toyota made some sort of special deal to not have it be so intrusive (rumored). I highly doubt Tesla has the cache that Toyota does in that regard."
"Basically I can have an app with useless notifications that I have to manually turn off and won't ever be useful in the first place because this isn't ever going to be a perfect world with competent end users making those notifications, or I can use one that doesn't have them at all and doesn't have ads, something I already cleared as pointless since they're Google owned and Maps doesn't have ads.

Google Maps for Tesla not Waze.

To go back to what you said about it being nice to have Waze like features added. Remember you didn't specify ads. Who would want that? Yeah very specific features only would be okay. There isn't anything Maps could port over into Waze that would ruin Waze (even more) but Waze has features that would ruin Maps. That should make it pretty clear which maps app belongs integrated.

I'm betting once Google squeezes the few innovations out of Waze they'll shut it down once they've ported the useful stuff over. Wouldn't make any sense for Tesla to pre-instsll an app that will be deprecated."
"Wait til you get your car before passing judegment. I was the same way, used Android Auto 100% of the time, worried what I'd do without it, if I'd have to mount my phone. Nope. Put my phone down and barely looked at it unless autopilot was on.  I'm a diehard android fanboy too, get a new phone every year, watch all the reviews, etc. I'm obsessed.

Couldn't care less when in the car. Tesla's UI/UX is that much better. I just put a playlist on Spotify or GPM and let it go. Or change it up by grabbing my phone real quick (which you kinda half to do with Android Auto anyways because the playlist selection UX sucks).

Tesla still shows what song is playing etc on the screen, and you can still change songs and play/pause with the steering wheel, but it just doesn't show the extra stuff.

When I drive the subaru, I just got used to the seemless Bluetooth experience and now unless I need a map I might not use Android Auto at all simply because I don't feel like taking my phone out of my pocket."
"Just say ""Play <song title> by <artist>"" into the voice command and it will play whatever song you request.


Do people not know this?"
"No problem, but you said ""maybe"" when it was clear you were talking about the wrong thing.  I'm really not sure what the phone app has to do with the discussion here, but from the number of upvotes, it seems you're getting a lot of folks thinking you're talking about the in-car experience, which people need to understand is simply incorrect.

Thanks for editing your original comment, I'm just trying to get the correct information out as that original comment spawned offshoots where people are still thinking all of that response is true."
"I thought Slacker was even worse quality than Bluetooth? Especially for the Model 3 which doesn't have an option to use the higher quality audio from a paid slacker subscription, last time I checked, so it uses 64kbps. It sounds way worse to me than Pandora premium streamed from my phone. "
They only display google maps. Navigation is their own system using some junk mapping system. 
"Google notoriously collects data as well but Tesla uses their Google Maps.

Data collection is far too common now with tech companies."
"I rented a Model S for a week and drove it quite a bit. That's when I decided to buy one, despite the lack of Android auto. I missed Android Auto the whole time I was in it, so I'm probably going to mount. "
Same. After a week of comparing nav to Google I gave up on having it open. Especially since the updates in October with the maps. Only good thing I miss is replying to messages via voice
"With Slacker?  I think that requires the top-level subscription, doesn't it? "
Everything I‚Äôve heard has said the same. Slacker streaming has the worst quality.
Well to each their own ü§∑
"I just own the car, and it does what I describe.  I don't have any sort of subscription to anything (Beyond Pandora, which certainly isn't part of the Tesla setup.)

Go out to your car, hit the voice command button, and ask it to play a song by any artist.  It will (almost always) play the song.  

/edit.  The one minor annoying thing is it won't play the same song twice.  There's some time gap (30 minutes?) before it will play the same requested song again.  I'd complain, but it's free."
I'll give it a shot if I ever get to leave the office today. 
It won't play the requested song even on the next day.
"Finally tried it. Mixed success, even with songs I know are on slacker. Worked more often than not, probably 75%?"
"There is a huge difference in volume between well mastered tracks and ¬´a lot of compressed crap¬ª. For example try a track from Yello, like ¬´Fat Cry¬ª in your car using Spotify. No problem running it on max volume (and sounds great). Then turn on your radio or whatever (turn down that volume first!) - i‚Äôd never put that to max. You should notice quickly how ¬´loud¬ª it sounds on lower volumes. 

A well mastered track (and probably the one they use for sentry mode as well) should be safe to play at any level the car provides."
"Back when the phantom touch problems were happening about a year + ago. My car would often play k-pop at max volume in the parking lot at work.  It was pretty noticeable, even to those inside the building.  The speakers didn't break."

I‚Äôm so far behind you guys.  I‚Äôm still trying to find out the specs of the speakers in my car
I was afraid I damaged the speakers the first day when accidentally turning up the volume. The sound system should have sufficient dB for an alarm. 
Good to know... I‚Äôve ‚Äústress tested‚Äù the sound system in my Model 3 a few times. Each time I think I‚Äôll make it crap out but it keeps on chugging. 
That's really cool! As long as the Sentry mode doesn't blast Daft Punk: The Game Has Changed (which is a notoriously harsh song for many subwoofers) lol.

"You sound like my mom. You're not going to blow out your speakers from a volume the UI lets you select.  This isn't the 70s, modern speaker systems don't let you turn the volume system higher than they are designed to handle."
Does this mean you can crank volumes in Teslas without warning ? I always leave it at 10 instead of 11 because of that. 
Will it go of during dog mode?
This should be obvious. Will Tesla release a feature that will blow your speakers? One would think they‚Äôve did extensive testing on this.

"Exactly. A waveform with plenty of headroom should have no problems being pushed at max volume on any speaker, but one with significant clipping and distortion would cause stress on the physical speaker cone due to being held at one extreme or the other. (Speaker cones like to return to equilibrium)"
"Okay this isn't really car related, but why does *well mastered* equal *has a lot of headroom* to you? Mastering music is all about making sure it plays well on which specific medium or platform its on.

Good question. I wish we could change the volume on lunar lander and such -- so freaking loud 
it protects against the really low <1-20hz frequencies by letting the ones higher than that pass. 
"If they have a ~35Hz high pass, then potentially damaging frequencies below that would be attenuated.  It's common to think about subs having low pass filters, but I guess in this case a high pass is another type of protection to ensure only the approved frequency range gets through to the speaker."
High pass filters block low frequencies. 
"It lets through the high stuff, and blocks the low stuff."
"When a sine wave clips it basically becomes DC which is why an amp with too little power is is more likely to blow speakers due to clipping. AC creates movement from the speaker which actually causes a higher resistance due to the inductance of the speaker coil moving through the magnetic field. 

Blocking low frequencies allows a system to play louder safer, and can easily be accomplished with a capacitor in series. "
Is this bach 1 sem 1 week 1?
hope you are a relatively new student.. Otherwise you might want to hit the books a bit more.
Also wondering this... Maybe they meant low-pass. 
Everyone here is so paranoid and thinks they are so smrt about everything it's truly hilarious.
"To be fair, there's a number of QoL and UX issues I've seen that kind of blow me away - where I'm really confused as to how certain 'areas' of the car's software are tested.

That said, audio hasn't really been one of them. I mean... aside from being able to use more sources to playback music, especially higher bitrate content."
Also I have never heard of speakers going bad due to content played on them. So that should tell something about speakers shouldn't it?
"Seeing as how the blind spot chime doesn't work, even with the newest update, I would not be surprised if Tesla didn't think of the speakers being damaged."
"Sorry, but to be honest, this would be the last thing I would think of when implementing such a feature... I guess it really depends on your background if you think of it or not."
"Most people email heir IDA. I did this when I wanted in the early access program (because I can test well as I‚Äôm a software dev), but couldn‚Äôt refer anyone, and they said it was a no go, but sent me a link t google jobs for Tesla jobs."

"What are you even saying?? Do you think a clipped waveform just holds the speaker in an extended position? And having a lot of headroom essentially means the track is quiet. So, sure, it can be turned up. Where exactly are you getting your information?"
"To me music is about dynamics. A big drum should have a punch, a noticeable punch. It should not feel the same as a little drum right. So, dynamics and well mastering makes sure that the bass drum is allowed to be more powerful than a smaller drum. Now the ""compressed crap"" makes everything more or less the same. A very informative video about this that shows the waveforms and what it does to the sound here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gmex_4hreQ

A well mastered track (for me) makes sure i can use my amplifier to get to the volume i want for the loud parts, without making everything sound the same (and muddy)."
"There is definitely some confusion going on. What they are talking about it the compression level. Modern pop music, especially on the radio is highly compressed.

That means that there is not much difference in volume level between the quietest part of the music and the loudest. Since they do this by making the quiet parts louder, that means that the average volume level of the track is louder.

A compressed track is actually less likely to damage your sound system because there isn't much variance in volume. If  a track started quietly, you might set the gain too high and then damage your speakers with the loud part later on.

Being able to set your system to the max volume level is no mark of quality, btw. It actually means that your gain is too low and you aren't able to take full advantage of the amplifier."

Also unrelated... How does one have **casual conversations** via email with Tesla designers???"
"An alarm that the owner can hear would discourage vandalism, but this would discourage thievery. It'd be very difficult to drive off with this going off. Does sentry mode also send an alert to the app when it's triggered?"

"It's not for notifying you, it's for scaring punks already trying to get into the car"
Yes. I'm not a Tesla owner but I know enough about audio and the human anatomy to tell you that it's really bad for your ears. You may develop tinnitus.

"Cool, thanks for the info. I was thinking it would just happen in an update. Good to know that‚Äôs not possible, not sure I like the idea. "
"Wondering if those are already installed in the EU version. Some time this year they will be mandatory here. But AFAIK the Model 3 doesn't play sounds, yet."
Isn't it s1nn?
If only the subwoofer played any frequencies :)
So why not use a band-pass? 
"Ahh look at this helpful comment right here, what a nice contributor "
[deleted]
"No, high-pass is right. Since I don't particularly like the -pass terminology, I always just switch it in my head to the opposite -cut. So a high-pass is low-cut, meaning it's cutting out the subsonic frequencies (say, below 20 Hz) that could be left behind in improperly mastered audio and affect the speaker's performance."
Hi-pass filter means the highs are allowed to pass the threshold.
High-pass means what it exactly says.... it passes the high frequencies which in turn does not pass the low frequencies. You're probably getting confused with high and low-cut filters.
high pass filters typically let high frequencies (like treble) thru while cutting the bass. sometimes it's referred the other way around. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass\_filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter)

It‚Äôs when your trying to get more power from the amplifier than it can give you.
"Aside from white noise, I never realized there were other colors used in identifying other types of noise. "
I have not had a car where max volume distorted since the 80's.  It just gets very loud.  Maybe some edge case distortion on the bass but nothing hideous.
"> Do you think a clipped waveform just holds the speaker in an extended position?

Well, that *is* what happens, no? The [clipped portions of a waveform](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/audio/clipping/fig4.gif) are sent to a DAC (and, I suppose, a smoothing filter) which moves the drivers. My point was that any extended period of tension in a driver will cause damage to said driver over time. A clean signal can drive a speaker to its maximum amplitude without harming like a distorted signal would.

> Where exactly are you getting your information?

My Bachelor's degree in Music Technology from University of Illinois."
Isn‚Äôt the waveform literally the power output to the electromagnet?   So if it‚Äôs constant then the speaker position should be constant right?
"I have lots of music that I love that has a large dynamic range. But when I listen to it in the car I hate it because all of the fine details get lost in the highway noise.

I'd like to have more compressed versions of the music in the car because without compression friends have complained I listen to generic repetitive music... because you can only hear the loud elements."
"Well the music is being well mastered you're just not its target audience. The loudness wars have been going on for years, people walking around with some shitty Beats headphones will prefer the ""louder"" track even if it destroys dynamic range. The filter is dragged up on the low frequencies and clipped on the highs as well, because headphones are generally just one driver and Beats sacrifice clarity to handle deeper bass, which is what a lot of current popular music focuses on.

Of course for audiophiles there are plenty of recordings with unfiltered, uncompressed tracks. But this whole argument of well mastered=speakers won't explode is ridiculous, a well balanced system where peak power does not deform the cone past its limits is all that stops damage. That can just be lowering the max power of the amplifier, physical filters put in place or even software compressors. I think the only caveat is that your track may only fire that bass drum every few seconds while the extreme loudness equalised track will be peaking and clipping constantly."
"Yeah I agree with this.

I have a few people explaining to me what compression is which is very much unnecessary lol
I make music, and all of this stuff is important to consider. It's of course true that songs can be compressed to hell where the waveform is just a big sausage and everything sounds the same.  At the same time, compression is very important to ensure the listener hears what they're supposed to hear. Like find me a drum track that's not compressed at all in any major release from the last few decades. I think people just latch onto compression and autotune and digital effects for their pearl clutching.

(also whether you like it or not, loudness is important to make sure people won't skip over a song for not flowing well with other songs)"
"Yeah, this is similar to hearing aid technology. I realize you understand this but I'm giving a different perspective for anyone who wants to hear another angle:  


We basically have 85db of comfortable volume ""dynamic range.""  If someone has 40db of loss, you can't simply ""amplify everything 40db"" because then an 85db sound is suddenly a dangerous 125db sound. Just as a car speaker can blow out, the human ear can be damaged in under one minute at those levels.   


So, you have to compromise. You ""compress"" the ""dynamic range of the sounds."" You may add 40db to the softest sounds, but only 10db to louder sounds. To someone wearing a hearing aid with a moderate hearing loss, the difference in volume between a pin drop in a gunshot is much less.  


A properly mastered track, before compression, fills the entire dynamic range based on the reference level in the studio. People tend to want to add more bass than intended so that, with a maximum volume, could cause trouble. In a closed system like a car, there really should be no way to destroy the speakers, though. The speakers should be able to handle the maximum the amplifier can put out.

&#x200B;"
"Just like not going full speed on a new race track, a new song is never played at very loud levels the first playthrough (on my home system).

In regards to ""max volume"" it was specifically referring to the Tesla Sound system in the car (Atleast in my Model S)."
"I can't speak from experience, but I'm pretty sure Tesla's notes on sentry mode advised it will notify you via the mobile app"
"Oh I already have Tinnitus from explosions and stuff. 

If it [doesn't feel loud](https://streamable.com/b3sw3), may it still cause damage? 

Nothing that I'm saying is scientific but the volume in my car is similar to how it sounds when I'm wearing headphones or something when I'm at home.

 Nobody that rides with me says it's an uncomfortable level or anything.

"That is the driver manufacturer for S and X.

I'm going to guess they're not worried about high frequencies damaging a subwoofer
I thought it was hilarious. :)
"As an EE that has done quite a bit to help the tesla community, I tend to think i am. I was giving advice to an EE who doesn't know the difference between low pass and high pass filters - which is a super basic and essential thing to know, and others have already explained it so there's no reason to repost it."
"Ah, makes sense, sorry for the deadpan humor. Good luck on your final semester!"
"This ^^

Subwoofers need a high pass filter to cut out the frequencies too low for the subwoofer to reproduce. (Hence the wording in the email)"
Rui?
In that case I would recommend the WW2 Stuka siren!
"""YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS TO COMPLY!"""
That too. But also happens when the amp is too powerful for the speaker. Both are results of requesting more loudness.
"Oh, yeah! Brown, black, yellow, you name it. YouTube search for each kind. Interesting to listen to. "
Got em.
"Okay let me clarify some things.
What you're talking about is a DC offset. Yeah, a DC input would hold a cone like that, but even clipped signals are AC. So they're just oscillating signals with a little more square character if you will. Speaker can be damaged by high amplitude signals, but being clipped has nothing to do with that. Do you think rock music is more dangerous to listen to than classical? Just playing a square wave ruining your stereo? That's preposterous.

Here's another guy on reddit ranting about the same thing for your reading pleasure:
https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/1ppywn/could_we_dispel_the_myth_that_clipping_andor/

Source: musician, mixing engineer, currently going to Georgia Tech for my BS in Materials Science with a focus on electical components, classes on circuits and signals, etc.

Go ask /r/synthesizers how their stereos are doing with all of the square waves they play"
I think u/orangewool was asking if you thought the speaker stays static at a certain position vs vibrating at a certain frequency to that specific position based on volume. 
Wouldn't you usually have a capacitor in series with the speaker to stop DC currents from flowing?
"Oh snap! My first /r/dontyouknowwhoiam in real life!

Either that or /r/quityourbullshit either way I'm happy. "
"That's interesting. Do you happen to know any tracks I'd easily be able to find on YouTube or the like, which suffer particularly when playing in a noisy environment?"
"Absolutely, even if it doesn't feel loud, it will still cause hearing damage. What may feel like a comfortable listening volume can also cause hearing damage because one is used to the volume. 

For example, the suctions and drills of a dental office aren't annoyingly loud, and certainly don't feel loud, but a dentist often ends up with hearing damage after prolonged exposure. 

Hearing is delicate and sensitive... take care of you ears!"

I always thought it happened due to under powering the speakers
"I concede your point about square waves being an example of a ""clipped"" signal that can be recreated without a problem. But the fact remains that a severely clipped recording puts undue stress on a cone that a similar, non-clipping recording would not. Going back to the original point of this post, assuming they're using a clean version of Toccata and Fugue, it can be played fairly loudly without having to worry about damaging the speakers, vs. a squashed/distorted electronic track, for example."
"Did Georgia Tech get rid of those rabid foxes yet? Heard about it on the news.

"I think at a certain point you guys seem to be arguing semantics. Poorly mastered or compressed tracks that have a high amount of clipping = distortion in the speaker = blown speaker.

  


End of story."
You realize your source debunks your theory right?
"Exactly! /u/OrangeWool got downvote hate for no good reason. Of course, a DC offset would hold the speaker in a ‚Äústretched‚Äù position, but of course, there are capacitors in the system that prevent this from happening! The Tesla engineer even mentions the filters they use to protect the subwoofers: those filters are capacitors that also happen to keep DC offset away from the speaker itself."

"Because others already have?

if you want the answer again, high-pass means that frequencies higher than the filter are allowed to pass, while lower frequencies, which can damage the speakers are blocked."
how is it arrogant to suggest that a student study more about a specific topic?
"Oh, I see, you tried looking them up on LinkedIn or something. You're never going to find them that way. "
"It can happen with underpowering (amp clips), overpowering (speaker clips mechanically), or from bad compression of the source audio (the waveforms clip on the highs and lows when increasing loudness). The last one was one of the biggest complaints when CDs first came out since modern music from the recording industry has the loudness (amplitude) turned up as high as possible."
"One fox captured, another still on the loose. Source: am Tech student"
"This just isn't true though. It's a matter of frequencies and amplitudes, not signal shapes"
"Yeah, this is what I was getting at. You can't just push distorted crap through a speaker and expect it to be okay. Fortunately, it seems the recording of Toccata and Fugue being used by Tesla is not distorted crap, so it should be fine."

&#x200B;

Did you all see his tweets? 

  
Elon Musk: Thursday 2pm..... California.... Some Tesla news"
What store?
"US Model 3 CCS/CHAdeMO adapter, it's so large they needed to clear floor space..."
Solar floor tiles!
Looks like stores are closing. Mystery solved!
Lol well now we know - it‚Äôs getting ready to close down for good. 
OMG THEY FINALLY RELEASED STEALTH CLOAK MODE!!!!
"Uh oh, looks like its just the store getting ready to close up shop. lol"
This didnt age well...
"Tesla Boat, coming 2020."
Is that Tesla Yorkdale?
Semi for sure lol
Well Elon did just say there would be Tesla news on Thursday. 
Sales are going online only. Bye-bye showroom
"Well, this didn't age so well... Looks like they are closing for good..."
""" By moving all sales online, Tesla says it will be able to lower the price of its cars by 6 percent, which is how it was able to finally get to the $35,000 price point."""
"Huge tesla battery for spaceship on the way, may be not sure"
The cars were updated with the AI OS. They are now playing a game of hiding-and-go-seek. 
Looks like enough room for a semi
They're bringing in so many Model Y showpieces tomorrow that they need to get rid of every other car ^^/s
"Looks like online-only ordering from now on.  These stores might be closing actually.  This is per the news release:

""To achieve these prices while remaining financially sustainable, Tesla is shifting sales worldwide to online only."""
"It all makes sense now, lol you were ahead of the curve"
I don't recall because I was distracted by throwing my money at Tesla. But did they move the cars out of the way for the Model 3 pre-order event?
Model y
INVISIBLE TESLAs!!
Cleaning or prepping for end of Q1. Chill the Y isn‚Äôt coming yet 
Ah good old Cherry Creek showroom in Denver. Likely either an event or Floor cleaning. That‚Äôs not a normal positioning for them to move the cars to 
Looks like it‚Äôs going to close; this move was announced today
Hopefully it's turning into a service center because they need the extra capacity....
"The floors are cleaned around the cars so doubt it that, maybe showroom car sold and they‚Äôre just getting it out and putting in the new one?"
Enhanced Sentry mode with cloaking confirmed.
"I‚Äôm calling it the pickup truck is called Tesla Tusk or Tesla T, no it‚Äôs Tesla T it will sound like your saying titty when you call it by that name and as we know musk is a kid at heart. "
"Huh, my local Tesla showroom‚Äòs cars are the exact same colors as yours: a red 3, a gray S, and a white X."
they getting ready for a l o n g b o y e 
"A ""Hot Topic"".... or maybe Auntie Anne's?"
"OP, you should really have included the location (state or country at least if you want to remain anonymous) in the title. The store could literally just be cleaning the area or trying to showcase model 3 for the first time for all we know."
Dope
"Probably need room for Elon's promises. They keep getting bigger.
"
New tile flooring. 
Looks like the Tesla showroom at Keystone in Indy
Is this at the King of Prussia mall in PA? Looks exactly like the one there lol
I tried to schedule a demo drive for Friday in Houston and was told the location I was looking at was closing for the day to go help out at some event in Dallas. Not sure what that is but sounds kind of related. Other nearby location in Houston is still open so I'm testing there.
Which store is this ?
Shutting down the store?
"I can't imagine it would be the Model Y this soon, with such an emphasis on Model 3 sales internationally. I'm probably wrong tho. We'll find out tomorrow I suppose."
semi truck
Where? Thanks
Another SEC sanction. 
Prolly cars.
My mom!
Tesla pick up truck!!!
"To be fair, that‚Äôs probably due to customers buying every last car in the area which includes the showroom/demo cars.  I doubt model Y will be unveiled tomorrow it‚Äôs probably just standard range 3."
What do we all think about Thursday? Y or pickup?
Summon demonstration maybe?
#LONG TESLA
It could be a number of things. Rotating cars into the showroom. Getting new cars. Cleaning the floors. Reorganizing the showroom. An empty room doesnt mean something super exciting is happening.
Maybe sell the show car.
Spotify Confirmed
Making space for my imaginary collection of their consumer SUV/sedan models and luxury sports cars. ;)
They are closing retail locations and moving to online sales only. You may be seeing the start of this.

Probably can‚Äôt afford the lease anymore.  Good bye Tesla üò¢
I believe it's the Tesla pickup truck

Probably a dick n piss party?
"No, this obviously means that Supercharger V3, the Model Y, the Semi, and the 2020 Roadster will be in all stores very soon.

/s"
"It's amazing how little of... Anything there is in the stores. Looks so empty with the vehicles pushed back. Maybe they're cleaning floors, or maybe they're bringing in something new! 


.... Probably cleaning floors"
making room for memes 
That's my bet. Even if model Y premiers Thursday it's probably the only prototype of its kind and nowhere near production. So no show floor units yet.
Making room to dig a tunnel to Fremont.
"Nope, cleaning house..."
Elon musk tweeted about something tomorrow 2pm California
"For real, lol. Besides that, some dumbass would probably leak it before the official announcement. That's what happened with Powerwall 2.0"
Several stores will unwrap the demo only to find it dirty and dented.

Best response actually!
"Can't arrange a loaner for your scheduled drop off time, but they can produce, ship, make room for, and set up some new product without a hitch or a spy shot leaking."

"This looks exactly like King of Prussia PA, but for all I know they all have the exact same floor plan."
"likely Santana Row, San Jose, CA"
Looks like Pasadena too lol
big as an elephant?
"In all seriousness, this would be awesome! I wish the price would come down on the Model S/X adapter too."
Solar freaking floor tiles!
Solar tunnels
"Putting the roofing tiles on the floor would be interesting marketing. Shows how durable they are and allows people to get up close to them.  I‚Äôm sure the gaps and edges would be a tripping nightmare, but a small section with a car parked on it would be interesting.  "
Powered by LED lights!
Solar roads confirmed!
Inductive charging floor tiles would be pretty awesome.
"Dude, if that was a real thing I‚Äôd buy it in a fricken heartbeat! I don‚Äôt even care if it doubles the price of the car, that would be the coolest party trick ever!"
"No... No it did not. They planned a new location north of here, and I wonder if it's going to still open. They already bought the land and everything"
Don't you mess with my heart like that!
"Tesla lawn care equipment, coming spring 2019"
"If they made an electric outboard motor that you could pair with a marine version of the powerwall, a lot of people would get on board for this. My dad would for sure! Boats are fucking loud when you run them wide open, but if the motor were electric it would make boating a lot more quiet. All you'd hear would be the water and the wind!"
wellllllllllllllll don't mind if I hope on the GO train then

Gives me a semi just thinking about it.
"> hiding-go-seek. 

/r/boneappletea"
They sent them out to find parking spaces and they never came back. 
Nope. My showroom made sure to have the S/X showroom cars out because of the increased attention
No but I don‚Äôt think we had theX yet in showroom at that time but I could be mistaken. Either way no car/s were not removed for the 3 preorder.
"When I first started shopping in October, long after my reservation came up (and wasn't really needed anymore) my nearest dealer still didn't have showroom 3s, but you could look at ones customer cars that hadn't been delivered yet. I expect new models to be similar.

They heavily prioritize (and yet seem but to struggle with) delivery and generally have a surplus of demand, so they don't really try to do traditional car sales things."
_Solar_ tile flooring!
Tesla limo
Bad bot
lol
This is funny. Anyone who downvoted it probably got butthurt about the ‚Äúbankwupt‚Äù picture too.
Tesla semi $35k confirmed 
Doubt it. Tesla branded Dragon capsules in all stores seems much more likely. Gotta promote the upcoming Dragon Demo mission.
"No, they are bringing in the pickup truck tomorrow /ss"
"I can‚Äôt wait for the Y. I‚Äôm trading in my RX350 for one. We have a M3 performance now and we LOVE it. 
Edit:Tesla Model3 no BMWs here. "
And the pickup!
With HUD
Don‚Äôt forget the pickup!
"Ooh, 2020 Roadster. Any intel on that?"
"Would be nice to have a little surprise in the midst of the SEC craziness.

Although if Elon did announce that they just cleaned the floors in all of their showrooms, a few people would show up to check that out too."
Model S & X refresh
Nope. Stores are being shut down. It's a moving out and all the staff are fired party. 
Someone needs to go throw a dead dolphin in the store
"To be fair, he only said Thursday.  This Thursday maybe, six Thursdays from now definitely."
"If he is going to announce a car and they already have showroom models, pics would have already leaked. 


We live in a world where phones get leaked before announcements. A new tesla car has no chance of not getting leaked."
So if the announcement is at 2:08 he goes to jail?
"It was a poster in a store, right?"
"Hah, that‚Äôs about what I expected. OP probably caught them cleaning the floor and flipped out.

I‚Äôm expecting something that doesn‚Äôt require any store changes, like short range for 39k, new self driving videos, or announcing the date of the Model Y reveal."
Elon Tusk üêò
"It's not KoP, they don't have that pillar there."
i thought it was kop too
You will need the Tesla pickup or semi to carry it with you.
[deleted]
I like it.. except according to fire fighter safety video.. They're very slick to walk on.
"Regulators, tho"
Nightmare at 4 way stops and traffic circles though.
Almost like it r/agedlikemilk. Go milk that pony!
"You joke but I love my Kobalt 80-volt mower, trimmer and blower.  I may buy the chainsaw this season.

Unless Tesla makes a chainsaw.  But it has to have a HUD."

"Haha, so the stock pumped \~5% today because Tesla is cleaning their floors"
SEC would still demand proof that such a tweet was screened and approved though.
It could be 100s of Thursdays from now. We don't know.
In most places yeah but I think some actually got a demo model.
Elon Tusk
"Ah, good catch. "
Your semi follows you on autopilot
Pow
"That's not a joke. I'd honestly love for Elon to take on another gas industry. Hopefully with his team and battery technology they could go come up with something decent. I'll check out the Kobalt stuff, but everything I've tried that's battery powered has been pretty worthless. "
"I have one of these Kobalt 80V mowers and love it! Electric mowers run way smoother, quieter and kick up much less crap (which helps my allergies a bunch).

On Black Friday last year Lowe‚Äôs had them for $200 each including batteries and chargers! I think it was a pricing error but we took advantage and bought two for my parents üëç"
"Hide-and-go-pee, popular at frat parties."
"Need at least 3 for that price, to run in convoys. Also, that price is after $192k in fuel savings over 40 years."
i have a semi after reading this
Turn it into a pickup
You can tow the backup around in case the first one‚Äôs battery gets too low and then swap them around and tow the dead one around with the backup. ‚ÄúExtended range mode‚Äù
But don't take that as guidance.

Tesla Model Y. 
Hey! I have a i3 and it's nice.
"? Issa lexus

Edit: NVM I got the joke.."
"Seeking Alpha: TSLA fails to notify customers before mopping showroom floors, analyst Mark Spiegel predicts billions in injury lawsuits. Elon should be removed as CEO for incompetence"
"Uh, what? The stock is UP more than 5% today. Above what it was before the SEC announcement."
Oh it was screened alright.
Summation of Thursdays from n=0 to infinity. 
Elon Tusk
I got a semi just thinking about that.
Did he just say pow?!?!
"I‚Äôll second the 80v kobalt, 0 maintenance lawn mower.  Takes 1 batter swap to cut my 1/4 acre, many bumps, changes in elevation, many type of grass, but it does fine. If it gets too long it takes an extra battery swap, but the noise reduction is so nice, it comes with 2 batteries, and they charge in like 45 minutes.  "
"This space has some quality equipment now.  My 21-inch mower makes short work of my half-acre yard, is light weight and quiet.  There are several manufacturers with competitive machines.  There's honestly no market share here for Tesla to grab and little if any innovation (there's already plenty of self-driving mowers) remaining.  This is all good news for the ultimate goal, though.  You can safely ditch your gas equipment now if you are not using it commercially."
Why don't they just put SOLAR PANELS on top of the truck?!?  Then they wouldn't need to use gas ever!!!!1!!
How about wireless charging roads for unlimited power? ü§î
Haha this deserves more credit. I laughed out loud. 
[deleted]
Tow one while the other one regenerates the battery!  Never need to plug in again!
Unlimited power!
"My first thoughts on this comment ‚Äúit‚Äôs getting dark, my power is low, where is Elon, when is he taking me home‚Äù"
"Thanks, Nathan. It was a reply to the root in which the redditor mentioned pricing. Have a great day."
" I think u/DataBoarder was making a joke about a M3 being a BMW, which is not to be confused with a Tesla Model 3. "
Cows are nice. 
It's a good car. But I personally cannot justify buying an i3 over a Model 3. 
Remember Volkswagen CEO promised cars as good as Tesla's at half the price by 2020. So they've got about 22 months to deliver on that before I'm assuming the CEO will be forced to resign right? Or does Volkswagen get a pass from the SEC?
I think that calculates out to an even Friday.
If you remove the battery can they just be cleaned off by hosing the entire thing off?
"Imagine if the retrofitted trailers to have solar panels on top, and another battery inside in the front of the trailer that connects to the truck power. It charges either by connection or by solar during loading and gives further range."
Also put them on the backs so they could also drive at night off other pplz headlightz
"Yeah, solar panels deliver an unlimited amount of energy, given enough time."
r/rimjob_steve
Oil companies hate him!
Power Overwhelming
Why you gotta bring up traumatic memories man...?
"Yes, I know, I was joking."
Oh thanks. I don‚Äôt know anything about BMW. 
[deleted]
"Ok, I see we are in agreement. "
"Agreed. Even as someone who very much enjoys performance ICEs (or, if not performance, something like a Miata with a six-speed stick shift), I can't really see the justification to buy a luxury-priced EV that *isn't* a Model 3 at this point if you're in the market."
"Uhhh... well since mine cost $17,000 and a M3 is 45ish... pretty easy justification there. Maybe you didn't think of that. You really should think about things more often."
"It amazes me that people are so quick to vehemently attack Musk over his promises. There's not even a 50% expectation from other CEOs. Not that, it justifies false promises. But broadly, Musk does deliver, albeit late."
I'm sure Jim Cramer will have lots to say about it when the day comes to pass
"They don‚Äôt actually have to answer to the SEC though - they‚Äôre traded in Frankfurt. Of course, the Germans have BaFin, but I don‚Äôt know what their rules are on this. "
By 2020 could also be taken at 11 months. If Elon said this it certainly would be. 
[deleted]
It approaches a Friday asymptote but never quite gets there. 
"Never tried that or looked into it, but it‚Äôs nice being able to tilt it over and not have fluids fall out.  Clean under with a brush easily."
"They make the semi not the semi and trailers. Most truckers drop trailers off and pick up a new one on the way back to their destination. It would be too risky for Tesla to do now. Maybe down the line but again, they manufacture the vehicle not the trailers "
"5km of range per day, worth it."
Imagine how quickly a semi would stop if the trailer had regen brakes too.
more range=less cargo capacity to an already shit solution offered by tesla. their truck goes ~500km on battery which compares to 1200km diesel iirc and cuts 40-60% cargo capacity due to weight restrictions making this a terrible option in its current form to replace diesel powered trucks 
Omg hire this person for head of development!
And no degradation.
The drowned dolphin in my swimming pool was funnier 
Fake News
"Umm, there are a host of reasons why people would look at over EV's over a model 3.  Not wanting a small car is a large one."
"17K?! That's a steal!  
I checked the MSRP for BMW i3 and it's 44.5K. If you got it for 17K, that's awesome! How did you manage that price?"
"As a M$FT shareholder, it AMAZES me what they get away with.  They promise new shit all the time.  90% of it never sees the light of day or gets killed off after a few years. - Sent from my Windows Phone. "
"> he got in trouble for committing securities fraud.

Why exactly has the SEC determined that overstating your confidence in a buyout is more troublesome than overstating your ability to produce a product?  Both affect the valuation of a company.  If we investigated Volkswagon would we have any reason to believe the CEO believed he could do what he said?  If I lied and said I had a cure for cancer at half the price of chemo, ready for market by 2020, surely that would be securities fraud wouldn't it?  Especially If I knew 100% that it wasn't possible, just like the VW CEO must know of his claim

"
"Actually, an infinite sum is *defined* as the limit. So for example, the infinite sum *1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/2^n + ...* is *equal* to 1. It doesn't approach 1, it *is* 1.

Said another way, the sequence of partial sums *1/2*, *1/2+1/4*, *1/2+1/4+1/8*, ... is what approaches 1, but the *infinite* sum is defined to be the thing it approaches.

It's sort of like 0.9999... repeating. That is equal to 1. It doesn't ""approach 1"" or anything like that, because it's not moving at all (so can't be approaching *anything*). It just *is*.

That being said, I would argue that the sum of Thursdays diverges. You'd have to weight each Thursday by an exponentially-decreasing weight to get it to converge."
Thursday 11:59p
"Not everybody does heavy long haul trucking, it can replace a lot of diesel trucks."
Nobody add this to the equation. Little to nobody even think about inflation for the next ten years.
"Sorry. Let me amend that:

If you‚Äôre in the market for a midsize EV, the Model 3 is the way to go.

If you want compact or large, then probably not."
because they dont sell. bmw fucked up with that pos
It's a 2014. 40k miles. That's the thing about i3s they've been around longer and EVs are incredibly undervalued used.
"The Chevy Volt is the same. MSRP on my '13 volt is ~42k and I got it for 16k three years ago.

If you're trying to start driving electric while spending a sane amount on a car, used plug in hybrids are the way to go."
"Oh the Windows phone.  Thanks for the laugh, and the reminder <sigh>"
Present values of Thursdays...
i work in the industry and I can tell you that most of the cargo maxes out the trailers and the stops are far between
A solar powered truck will take 10 years to deliver your parcel.
That works : )
"Except they sell just fine, especially considering they're a goddamn RWD carbon-fiber chassis EV that came out in 2013. It was never meant to be a 500k/yr car. Obviously the MSRP is ridiculously inflated, but considering the fact that BMW will happily take off ~13%, plus the tax credit, plus you can get $10k off with Costco/corporate fleet, and it's pretty damn good even new, and used is ridiculously cheap."
"Oh! Yeah man, I agree. I was comparing new cars above. I am all in favor of new or used EV. The more new EVs, the more used EVs :)"
What's a good plug in hybrid?
">i work in the industry and I can tell you that most of the cargo maxes out the trailers and the stops are far between

Maxed out trailers, few and far between stops. Sounds like another way to say heavy long haul trucking."
"This is where rail shines. The transportation industry as a whole is better off maximizing the intermodal rail model.


If the facilities were built, most of everyone would benefit. But nobody wants to foot the bill (building more infrastructure, converting operations, etc.). Truck drivers would have more locals to pick up instead of OTR, customers would get a more reliable service,  the public would see less traffic and better/safer road conditions, the rails would get more business. Who‚Äôs benefiting with the way things are now? Oil and the big trucking companies."
"Unless states and the feds allow a certain amount of leeway like what the did for add on generators.
https://www.trackyourtruck.com/blog/apu-weight-exemption-guide/

If they do that, the Tesla semis can haul like any other class 8 big rig"
Post history tells enough.
they sell ‚Äújust fine‚Äù at ~20% of their cost... it‚Äôs a pos at 47k msrp. bmw fucked up my thinking people will pay that outrageously much
"I have to imagine the guy you were talking to was saying he got his i3 used as well.

Eventually we'll have a healthy used EV market..."
"It depends on your needs, but we Chevy Volt owners really seem to like our cars... It's technically an EREV rather than a PHEV... basically it has a motor big enough to do all the driving and just turns on the gas when the battery is drained, while a lot of other PHEVs have a small motor meant to assist the main gas engine. I much prefer having my car operate like an EV with a generator rather than require the engine to turn on if you accelerate too hard."
Honda clarity
"yes and its food: hugely common commodity -> big part of the market, and a lot of food is heavy"
I think it‚Äôs unlikely just because of the sheer weight that would add. but maybe future battery tech will improve and weight will go down on the battery side
"if you must know I work in food distribution, so yes i know what im talking about"
"I don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre talking about food though, moreso relatively short distance trucking. It‚Äôd be great for us over in HK, for example."
"Might not be as big of a difference, we do have more weight to lose than the average sedan.
Some of the big rig engines can weight almost 3000lbs
https://hdstruckdrivinginstitute.com/semi-trucks-numbers/
That‚Äôs more than what the entire original roadster weights. An Eaton 18 speed transmission another 700lbs or so.
Still going to be heavier overall though."
electric motors are also very heavy though as they have a lot of copper and the batteries but if this technology can become good maybe in the next 20 years I think it will be very viable for long-haul and short-haul
"It‚Äôd be better to have hot-swappable batteries for longer distances I believe, that way you can swap out a battery after 400km, and start driving immediately. Then, the next person swaps the battery, and the cycle begins again."
would be nice but you need a utopian amount of tesla semis for that to be viable. edit: at least for now
"Not necessarily, an attachment on the side of preexisting superchargers could be able to do the job, it‚Äôd take a while longer between charges though, and it‚Äôd probably be harder to connect up unless there‚Äôs a space for it behind the truck cabin. Again though, it‚Äôs probably more suited for the short haul, fossil fuels are still pretty great for energy density/kg, so I can‚Äôt see electric mass passenger planes or electric ultra-long distance trucking being viable without significant advances in the technology and infrastructure upgrades."
"whatever you said isn‚Äôt related to the conversation. we‚Äôre talking about switching out batteries in basically 15 minutes. that would require huge amounts of infrastructure that are not viable any time soon

Although your thinking was my original thought. you could maybe plug a semi into two superchargers to charge two cells at once or maybe one larger cell faster given proper cooling or whatever else would be needed"
And the Invasion has begun 
I see at least 10 full carriers going to the port every day while driving to San Francisco. Empty ones head back to fremont all day long.
I just received an email confirming my model 3 delivery 28th of FEBRUARY! I'M SO EXCITED RIGHT NOW. First car ever owned :)
"Lovely!

Also lovely to see all those hatchbacks and wagons on the road too. I need myself a Model 3 hatchback!"
Awesome. Go Tesla. Go Elon.
"Swiss here, still have to see a 3 in person. Can't wait to see them hit the road! "
"And already on the way to Poland, nice!"
Can‚Äôt wait until the car carriers are electric.

Ehhmmm... the way the cars in the left bottom corner are stacked looks very weird to me.... WTF.
Glovis Cosmos docked in Zeebrugge last night with another shipment of cars!
No aero caps? Maybe they put them on at the SC? Seems strange
But for the extra-wide number plates it looks like a lot of roads here in California have for most of a year. Welcome to the Model 3 tidal wave!
"ff: Zeebrugge is the largest auto import hub, I believe the first Model 3 was shipped to Zeebrugge last week and that's why there are so many of them :)"
"1. Orders not open for Poland

How much does it cost for the cheapest one?
Is this the first time Tesla cars are released in Europe?
"In the US, the Model 3 started with a trickle. In Europe, it starts with a literal boatload."

"This seems unlikely, as I'm fairly sure the amount of electricity needed to electrolyze water into H2 is more energy than you get back out when you burn the H2. The advantage that H2 has as a fuel for ships is that its energy density is through the roof compared to batteries. The ship can can carry something like 1/30th as much weight in fuel to get the same motive force as an equivalent amount of batteries."
Hydrogen may work for container ships.    I believe hydrogen has an advantage over batteries when it comes to extremely large volumes.

"Wow, as hominem attacks, now? Pathetic."
"Not the right color, let them know they will fix it"
White is a hard color to match. I had a white bumper repainted (non-Tesla) and they ended up painting half of the car to blend it. They did a fantastic job though. I never even knew until the inspector at the end of the lease was measuring the thickness of the paint and showing me which panels had been repainted. 
"I'm an expert in this. Had a defect on my bumper and first re-paint was too white. Body shop, without showing me, painted it a second time. Was too yellow. Brought it to a different body shop who painted it and still couldn't match it. Tesla finally gave me a new bumper and sent me to the best body shop in town to have it painted for a 4th time, and it was as close as it would ever be.

&#x200B;

My friend is a painter and explained the complexities. Firstly, bumper is plastic and quarters are metal, and different materials show colour differently. As well, they usually need to add a flex agent when painting the bumper so the paint doesn't crack when they re-install the bumper. Finally, because it's a tri-coat, the colour is affected by how much pearl they spray on over the base coat, how the metallics orient themselves relative to the quarters, and even how yellow the clear coat is (differs by brand). There are too many variables, and the worst are multi-coat red and white. If people are picky, the best is to buy a darker colour, but this presents other problems (my blue X shows swirls and scratches much more easily).

&#x200B;

I think another body shop could do a slightly better job, but to be honest, mine was worse. The easiest way to match would be to blend into the quarters, but when you re-paint the quarters, you risk messing up the colour of the quarters and removing factory paint!"
"Yeah, the same thing happened to someone else on here, and they have been going back and fourth with Tesla for months...

I believe it was u/teslamodel3fan?

White paint typically has this issue until UV burn in. The paint for the bumper and body are usually different colors for the first couple days. Source: I work for a car manufacturer.
"Yea, it's not great OP, but don't be 'that guy' walking into the shop accusing someone of being ""blind."" That color definitely wouldn't fly in my shop but there are many variables: was it a new bumper or a repaint, was it a warranty claim, insurance claim, or a self pay. This might not sound important but it makes a difference in \*some\* shops. If someone walked in and said to me ""i want my bumper fixed for as cheap as humanly possible"" then there aren't any guarantees. Some insurance companies refuse to pay the shop more than ""generally accepted"" rates, it doesn't matter if it's a 98 civic or a 2019 Model S. But we'll assume non of this applies to this particular situation

&#x200B;

Just for a little perspective I'm currently sitting in a body shop, I walked back to my paint mix computer and looked up this code (PPSW) just for giggles because we haven't done one yet to see. Our particular paint manufacturer currently lists two formulas for the particular line we're spraying (they sell 5 other lines in both solvent and waterborne compositions): ""Prime"" is the basic formula, there's also a ""Lighter Yellower"" variant. They are both comprise of some mix of the following: white pearl, trace black, trace yellow, trace green, trace blue. The top pearl coat is a (clear) base, white pearl, silver pearl, matte base, and a few other things. The base color is about $8 an oz and the clear pearl is about the same \~$9/oz. Remember all of these things are being mixed in house, by a human, with their hands, down to the 10th (or smaller) of a gram. Trust me: if I could buy paint already pre-mixed from Tesla or, hell any other manufacturer, and have it shipped to me, and guarantee it matches I would absolutely do that but that's not how it works. Someone else mentioned that the substrate of the bumper matters here so if it was a replacement bumper, it looks like they just don't have the right color sealer down first or they don't have enough material to cover the black/grey plastic bumper. 

&#x200B;

Ya know, it's one of those things, like I said, it wouldn't fly in my shop but every situation and vehicle is different. It's the same as ""Can't make chicken soup like mom used to, never comes out the same"" when cars are rolling down the assembly line the ones getting painted on Monday are not quite the same as the ones getting painted on Friday. Tesla may be a bit of an exception to the rule but hell, many other manufacturers get their bumper covers made and painted at a completely separate sub facility, maybe even by a different company all together! 

&#x200B;

This is kind of a rambling rant but in general the shop is going to do everything they can to make it right and that may mean you have to be very patient, which is hard for some people to hear, but it's a fact. My little adage is ""you can have it cheap, you can have it fast, or you can have it 'right', but you can't have all three"" "
This happens sometimes regardless of car. White can be hard to match 
"If you can, you might park your car next to another white Model 3 and compare.  The line between the bumper and the rest of the car is on a crease, and can cause it to look quite different when it's really not because of the angles light bounces off the car.  I have experience here, white car owner too. :-)"
Your bumper is never going to match.. I had mine repainted when it was delivered with a mismatched bumper and it's still not right. Pearl white tesla is synonymous with regret.
"Pearls or any tricoat is very hard to match color.  I had 2 painters that was able to match up to 1-2 shades off.  For reference people can‚Äôt spot 1 shade off.  2 shade only if the person got a really good eye.  I personally can‚Äôt spot 1 shade off.  They don‚Äôt use paint codes, they look at the formula and mix it themselves.  Ever since those two don‚Äôt work for me anymore I couldn‚Äôt find other painters able to match color like them.  It is a skill and very hard to find, only way to get good ones is to poach them which I will not do.

Shops usually blend color to adjacent panels (next to).  I personally don‚Äôt like blending because of the solvent used to melt the basecoat into the clear compromises the quality of the clear.  This is standard insurance procedures.

The paint shops use is different than that of OEM.  Refinishers have to work with what is available to them from BASF, Dupont, Speis, Azol, PPG, etc.  Because of aqmd emissions rule.  For example I was able to purchase different clearcoat products same as the OEM because my business was not classified as a refinisher but OEM since I did work for Toyota Tier 2 supplier.  That is how I know about the different product lines.  OE materials would pass the same AQMD VOC limits.  The clearcoat is much harder with ceramic within the materials unlike the rubbery feeling of the regular clearcoat.  

Also note that all new cars bumper paint doesn‚Äôt match the body because of the angle of light and substrate of the material.  This is why some companies use gray has a primer or sealer color to try and match the color of the panels.  Doesn‚Äôt always work.  It is very weird.  

So the moral is if you want it matched they will likely perform a blend to your trunk and quarters.  I bet if you put a certain cool light like 5,000K the color would look identical.  "
"The color of the bumper is off on ALL white cars.  The bumper is a different material than the body so it will never be an exact match. Paint on plastic vs paint on aluminum. 

Edit; I mean all of Tesla‚Äôs white cars."
They tend to not match on the plastic pieces. Already had mine repainted and it still doesn't match..
"Looks flat, and missing the protective gloss."
"Almost all cars have this, it's especially obvious on white cars. Peek at a few, be surprised! Then let it go. 

It's because the bumper is a different material than the rest of the body. It was probably like this before but you're only scrutinizing it now since it got replaced. Enjoy your car!"
"This needs to be fixed. It's true that the bumper, being a different material from the other panels, may not look exactly the same. But this is way, way off. I've had my bumper redone twice!"
You need to Bump'er!
That's a mismatch alright. Also it's obvious that they didn't apply a clear coat finish like the original. 
An I the only one whose like... Those both look the same color. 
Looks like white bumper on a pearl white car
Quality painters usually test color match on spray out cards before applying to panels.  Panel painting pearl white bumpers without blending quarters is difficult.  
This is why I hate selling cars. 
Yeah they didn't blend that.
"Re painting just a bumper will never 100% match

Source; work in a body shop "
"I'm gonna guess the piece of shit body shop (they all are) put one coat of paint over a grey plastic bumper, probably with no primer. Grey shows through pretty white paint and crappy body shop thinks you won't notice."
"Have them repaint it again.  If it still doesn‚Äôt match after wards, have them blend the quarters as well. That pearl white is pretty hard to butt match."
You can take it back but it‚Äôs most likely never going to perfectly match. 
"Not ""seems"", ""is"""
"plastics or composites show paint differently compared to metals, especially white, black and pearl colours. Without blending the paint into other panels you will see the difference."
"White , especially pearl white, is VERY hard to match (but not as hard as 4 stage reds lol) And when bumpers are painted they cure different than metal. Thus, most cars you look at on the roads will have slightly off colored bumpers (even from factory). Every shop has such challenge, and the good ones will make mistakes occasionally and should re -paint this for you in a heart beat. At least my shop would. Good luck! And nice Tesla !"
"Shouldn't they be blending the paint in anyway?  Or do they just assume that it's new enough, the new paint will still match?"
"Looks better than a lot of the factory bumpers.  Unfortunately, pearl white is near impossible.  Expect half your car painted to blend, which is something you don‚Äôt want."
Off white
Bumper is plastic when the rest of the car is aluminum/steel. Any mismatch in color will be amplified. Let the shop know just in case. 
"Stuff like his is why I'm hesitant to get a door ding I have repaired. It's small, there is zero paint damage and it's got a ceramic coating on it so there'd be extra cost to repair.  "
They got you
This thread has been useful for me as now I know that I‚Äôm fucking blind apparently.
"The bumper is made of some kind of plastic while the rest of the car is metal. Different surfaces result in different colors. At least that's what my dad, who works in mechanics, said at first glance."
I‚Äôve noticed all the paint job issues posted seem to involve white cars. Is this simply selection bias or is white really far more difficult ?
How many versions of white could Tesla have?
How do they not notice that?
"is this flat white, or pearl white?  I would assume pearl will never match, but a base white shouldnt be this hard to correct"
"The obvious part to look at (well, it‚Äôs all pretty obvious) is the sensor (and circle). "
"Wait a minute, somethings not right here."
That‚Äôs a Mat White bumper on a Pearlescent Whit body. Wrong part ordered more than likely. 
"It looks fine to me, The reflection is what is making this appear different in my opinion."
"According to MKBHD, his left side got replaced and bc other paint was 1 year old so even they use the same paint the color will off a little

And he end up replacing the whole paint"
I work at a body shop and bumpers usually dont match well. They should blend the quarter panels tho.
"Definitely needs to be repainted or blended, the fact that they let it out of the shop like that is a sign that they just don't give a shit. If insurance is paying for it, I'd ask them if I could bring it to another shop. And you can bring it to any other reputable paint shop (non tesla) as long as they can get the correct paint color."
"Previous bmw/gm body shop manager here, most makes and models of cars have a difference in colour from bumper to fender/quater panel. The biggest difference is how paint sits on metal and plastic. Go drive through a new car lot and you will see a ridiculous amount of this. The other factor is that some paint colours (especially white) can have many different versions of each colour. The diamond white colour is very popular but almost impossible to match, sometimes having 30-40 ‚Äúmatches‚Äù. A painter has to spray each swatch out and compare in multiple lights. It‚Äôs very common to have 5-10 very close Colors and you make an informed decision.thats pretty much it."
This is why I did not get white. See these issues a lot with all car brands.
Two tone - white and eggshell 
This is the reason I would never get a pearl white...really hard to color match and blend
"Yeah, this is really bad :/ I hope they fix it for you. "
"I had the same thing happen with my red Model 3. After two visits to the body shop they had to fly a paint mixer in to manually add the specs into the paint. It looks about 99% now. 

Good luck. "
"Yikes. That‚Äôs a completely different color!

This is exactly why I didn‚Äôt go white even though it‚Äôs my favorite color :("
It could be that the sun could have changed the paint overtime.
"Lots of ""Well, the bumper is plastic, of course it won't match the metal panels perfectly, duh"", yet pretty much every car has plastic bumpers and I don't see too many with blatant visible color differences like this. I've had several white cars and never noticed any mismatches, and I'm pretty picky. 

&#x200B;

OP: Make them fix it. A good body shop should be able to match paint way better than this, I don't care what the part they're painting is made of."
They supposed to clear coat the quarter panels with the same clear coat they used on the bumper
You may want to chat with @teslamodel3fan on Twitter about this. She‚Äôs been through this on a brand new car.  
"Had a similar problem once with a body shop getting ‚Äúfrozen white‚Äù and ‚Äúdiamond white‚Äù mixed up, looked pretty much identical to this, one had a slight beige tint to it. 

Only problem was they had sprayed half the car before they noticed."
Seems is a grave understatement.
Maybe because what they replaced it with was new and the rest of the car is older and the color is older
Sure they will fix this... but IMO this is a huge lack of quality control !
Definitely
"Don't know if that's a reflection or a shit wrapping job, tho I doubt someone would wrap white"
Paint is off for sure if we can tell from a low res picture on the internet...... 
Needs to be repainted and blended. Looks like they painted just the bumper and threw it on. Even if they used the right paint code you will see the difference. Need to paint the bumper and blend the body.
One part is metal the bumper is plastic. The paint will look off whit certain colors. Look at any new car and you will see they are off too. Metal/plastic. 
"Pretty normal for white model 3's and from Tesla approved bodyshops. 

Depsite what tesla tries to tell you the Tesla approval is BS. All the better bodyshops who do great work in my area tell me it's just a Moneygrab for referred work. "
"Yep, it's too blue. Unfortunately other comments are right. Colour matching is hard on some colours, whites including. I've done colour grading in a powder coating factory and some colours (like brown too) are more difficult than others to match. "
Looks like you bought the pearl white and they gave you the flat white. Plus I know Tesla changes their paint mixtures sometimes so they need to pull your Vin for the right white code.
"""Seems"" is an understatement. You are right and it is off. Hopefully you can get it fixed soon. "

yup
No question. 
The color doesn't seem off it is off. I went to have paint work done on my Silver TM3 and the 3rd party bodyshop told me the colors would be different. So I took my car to Tesla Service center and told them what the body shop and Tesla had me a new bumper installed within 4 days. 
"Here's the deal. I worked for an insurance company dealing with auto dmg claims all day and I may have some insight. Typically when a panel like that is damaged and replaced they paint ALL the surrounding panels with a ""fade"" to blend the the colors of the surrounding panels to the replacement. This achieves the desired effect of looking like one single color.  It ends up on all estimates for body damage and replacement panels but people just assume it's to fix scratches and minor damage but it's not. "
"They probably used the right color, but plastic surfaces seem to reflect slightly differently than metal."
"Good, so are the OEMs. Nothing to see here."
"Dealt with these issues for years...Tesla turns and burns these cars. Worse was when it was a brand new vehicle ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù for delivery...delays are never good, and your vehicle is probably at a local body shop. 

Good luck OP, they‚Äôll fix it no problem, but your faith will take time to recover "
r/wellthatsucks
"Looks like it's missing the sheen
"
I'd like to know what kind of paint they put on there.  My guess would be chromabase solvent
"I hate that,, get it redone f them "
White is the hardest colour to match.
"Yeah the bottom one is more ""eggshell"" rather than just normal white. Definitely have them redo that, that's not okay! "
Put a cool sticker on it. Kinda tattoo after surgery. 
"I'm no professional but was an insurance appraiser for a few years. Most shops I went into had signs up stating that plastic bumpers will appear slightly off color from metal. I'm not familiar with tesla but maybe plastic bumper, metal quarter panel? "
"Bumpers can be a little off especially white. I work at a dealership, every new white Nissan maximas bumper looks a little off, I‚Äôve been told due to the car being metal and the bumper plastic.

If it wasn‚Äôt that different before, I‚Äôd have them redo it. We do have other cars (5 manufacturers), the bumpers look a little off with the white, but I don‚Äôt have Tesla‚Äôs on my lot, so I can‚Äôt tell you 100% for sure"
"Looks like they didn‚Äôt blend the bumper to the quarter panel. Painting pieces at different times will often be mismatched. Blending requires the shop to feather the paint over to the adjacent panel. This tricks the eye that you are looking at one tone. Looks like they cut corners there.

Edit.

I use to paint cars."

Welcome to the pain of a white car.
"When ordering a car there are like 10 colours to choose from.
Why is it so hard to just take a preconfigured colour and paint it on?
Doesn‚Äôt the manufactures care for that?"
I am partially color blind (have a hard time telling like colors apart) and even I can see this is off. Take it back until they get it right. 
Wear vs brand new? Otherwise contact the dealer
"Yes its the wrong color, it seems like it's a matt paint.

If you look at the reflection it seems to be a clear difference between the two panels."
"The color difference shouldn't be that far off, but a plastic bumper will never be the same color as a metal panel. You can go to other body shops and ask. They will more than likely agree"
"How much are you guys paying to replace your rear bumper? I have a small hole in mine and I got an $1,800 quote from a Tesla certified body shop and $1,000 from a regular highly rated body shop. I also have the option to repair for $750 but I‚Äôm hesitant that it won‚Äôt match. "
"Ok so I have a decade plus with paint and auto body experience here and I can offer my input. First, can you take a picture of the front bumper to the hood/fenders? Generally speaking plastic parts will resemble a slightly different color from metal or aluminum when sprayed. One of the causes (and easiest to explain IMO) is paint dries at a different rate on each surface. When it is sprayed onto a metal panel the temperature changes in the metal and cools down pretty substantially often, whereas over plastic it retains its temperature better. Paint typically will darken as it dries so if one dries quicker it will be different than the other. Now the reason I ask for the photo of the front bumper is often the correct procedure in the repair world is to get it as close as possible, but given the color variables it is generally deemed acceptable if the front and rear bumper match each other (as in both look a little different than the car). From my experience tesla is generally pretty good at this, however most people with a trained eye will notice bumpers hardly ever match from the factory.

For what it's worth one of my memories from years ago was painting a black Corvette. We were doing the rear bumper and back half and after first painting it the bumper was a ways off. So we tried tinting the color and after two tries it wasn't getting any closer. So we ended up painting the whole back end with the bumper on, and it's the same story. Professional or not, what most people dont realize is it costs an absurd amount for paint materials, and shops generally aren't paid more than half an hour to tint color, and you could easily spend a full day on a situation like this plus a few hundred in paint and materials depending on the color and other variables.  

Now with all that said, I would still definitely ask about if they can do anything with it. But I would be curious how the front bumper looks as a shop may have to stick to that as that would be the OEM match if the front doesn't match then the rear likely wouldn't have either."
Looks like they used a different clear coat.
I guess this is what happens when Tesla ships the front and rear fascia pre-painted.
Paint lays different on plastic than it does metal. God to a dealership and look at brand new vehicles the covers never match the quarters or fenders. 
"Definitely is off. For the future, this is something you should check for with any car repair before you accept the car back from the repair shop. "
"Plastic absorbs color so even if they paint the original code, it will be off. Nothing you can do. But this is really off. Looks like they didn't use primer. "
Oh you poor thing
Looks like some kind of AliExpress knock off
It‚Äôs the lighting. You can see where the shade starts. Please don‚Äôt bother them with this. 
Why would this be a discussion topic?  This is a simple appointment.
Nice two-tone Tesla!
If you replace a part it's going to look different unless you get a new wrap on entire car. That parts new so no sun damage or anything else. 
"Does it still drive tho? ü§î when u invite your family to eat on the bumper, do u think they will notice???"
it's like they forgot to put the transparent coat....
"In the billionth edition of First World Problems^TM, someone rich enough to buy a car that costs more than a large percentage of people make in their entire lives is complaining.

In other news, water is wet."
Take it back. 
"Any shop worth their salt will, no question."
can someone who isn't blind at this body shop come out here and look at my bumper with me? 
"try getting a car wash first before going back. Esp with the white, the older panels might have some pollen on them. After a wash if you see they're still not same color, then go say something"
"Is it just the color, or the finish too?  It looks more matte, or is it called eggshell?"
"It seems like wrong color and no pearl just a bland white with some clear 
"

"White is the hardest color to match but it's something a body shop should easily handle. 

Ive painted my own car hood and it wasn't noticeable to an untrained eye. "
">until the inspector at the end of the lease was measuring the thickness of the paint and showing me which panels had been repainted. 
  
  
What brand measured the paint? When I turned in my BMW lease, they eyeballed the tires and said I was all set. "
Exactly.  Looks like they didn't do any paint blending.
"They didn't blend the panel, it's often hard to match certain colors. To fix this the panels adjacent to the replacement are usually painted in a gradient to create a smooth transition.

Edit: spelling"
How do they measure paint thickness?
Not just that - this is a pearl white. Those are even harder to match and you do often end up having to blend half the car to get them to match. I used to own a pearl white car ... never again.
"TIL , paint is hard."
"> bumper is plastic and quarters are metal, and different materials show colour differently

This. Every car ever from the factory will show subtle color differences between metal and plastic panels, that's perfectly normal. The OP's case seems a bit extreme though."
"I paint multiple 3 layer pearl white bars a week and while they're Abit harder than standard colours to match theres no excuse for the car to be given back to the customer like that.
That comes down to lack of skill / care "
"Excellent explanation, I would also add a couple of points, the flex additive often slightly changes the viscosity of the paint which can change the apparent density of the metallic flake as well as the transmissive properties of the clear. Metallic is also sometimes directional, meaning that the color may appear different because the predominant reflective angle appears different to that of an adjoining panel, hence the necessity of blending.

&#x200B;

To each their own, and maybe it's my age, and spending time living near Leisure World in Orange County, CA, whenever I see metallic white my mind goes to a 90s Cadillac with lots of gold bits...

&#x200B;

Hopefully it will work out for the OP, it is an impossible thing to unsee when you notice a defect in ones vehicle."
"Even with blending the material difference means it will never look the same.. Tesla should really just not be offering a pearl white paint on parts with different materials that are directly beside each other (such that you can notice the difference). This is why a lot of cars put a plastic trim piece to separate the parts, makes it much harder to notice this issue."
[deleted]
"There are also issues many times with painting on plastics/composites vs metal.  It's all very strange.  Look at older cars and the plastic painted bits will sometimes become different over time.

I got a few sentences in and had to drop to the bottom to make sure I wasn‚Äôt about to get shittymorph‚Äôd. 
"Tri-coat white pearls are tough, but they're not rocket surgery or some new-fangled paint tech. I took a class on how to refinish tri-coat pearls. In 1987."
"It also depends what paint supplier and color matching tools the body shop is using. OEM's don't give specifications on the paint to the bodyshops, so most painters have to visually match the car. Pearl and Metallics are impossible to match visually. With the right tools you can match really close, cheap color matching devices can't detect the right coarseness level used in the paint. Also Tesla paint jobs are generally really crappy (paint is too thin, even with multicoat and basecoat is too rushed, so you get orange peeling, or the plastic bumpers/roof are bubbly). 

Source: worked at a large paint manufacturer on color matching for body shops and high end OEM's."
What are these quarters you're talking about?
"Honestly, does this problem of the color being off also exist for new cars? Otherwise im going out on a limb and be the asshole saying if it has been done before it can be done again and this is not an excuse. Just someone is not sharing material or knowledge.

Then again. I know nothing of paint, but if the car new doesnt have this problem, this isnt an issue of paint and difficulty, but business."
"Sounds like you got a lot of excuses from people unable to do their job.  If your repair colors were as far off as OPs i would suggest you hit another shop, document it, and take them to small claims.  The repair should be flawless.

If the repair goes over a transition and you know you are not good enough to match then maybe you should cheat and blend into the next panel.  But a car this new should be as easy as punching in the paint code and moving on with your life."
"A number of people have also complained about this from the factory, but I've seen far less of those complaints as of late - it seemed more common up through last summer.

From the folks that mentioned it previously (namely, from the factory this way) did indicate it tends to be more noticeable based on lighting.  I believe  a number of folks had gotten them replaced to their satisfaction (some took an extra try) but I don't know if all of them got resolved fully.

I've also heard this complaint from owners of other manufacturer's vehicles.  It seems like white and pearl white can be trickier colors than they'd seem to be at first glance.  I'm sure the material (plastic vs steel or aluminum) may have something to do with it."
"Yup, thanks for the ping. 

I initially went in for miniscule chip on bumper and drivers quarter panel was too yellow. Body shop #1 painted bumper and both rear quarter panels and some doors too. They created ""too much pearl"" issue on passenger's side that didn't exist before and made bumper way too pearl, I made follow appt. 

Body shop #1 tried again, made passenger's side better but bumper was way too pearl compared to how it was delivered from factory (but chip was fixed). I said nope and Tesla sent car to body shop #2 that said they couldn't fix bumper, too many paint attempts or whatever, Tesla sent new one (that body shop #2 painted).

End result is I'm happy with my car. It's much better than it was after first body shop messed it up, but I bet if I looked closely I'd see mismatch somewhere. If it wasn't for the chip I'd say I shouldn't have let anyone touch it  knowing what I know now - but paint shops need to learn bc there will be fender benders.

I was without it for weeks, but Tesla put me in a loaner (older S for last longest repair). I don't think my next car will be a white one. I love my car though, and it feels so good to finally be happy when I look at it! "
this should be at the top
"Was gonna say, if you're expecting a perfect match on white paint after the rest of the vehicle has experienced months or more of UV exposure, you're gonna have a bad time. 

About the only thing that could be harder to match is a metal flake type paint where even if you get the mix perfectly right you have to get the flake to lay down the exact same way, which is nearly impossible. "
"I work at a body shop, and like you said, it takes a while for the uv to burn in. Besides, you have to keep in mind they're different materials underneath as in plastic to aluminum. "
Where's your shop in case I need repaint
"Nooooo... false.  If may be hard to match for you, but any reputable shop can match.  Its even easier when the manuf is still around to supply you with info.

We can even match those 2003 mchrome mustangs with actual original factory paint.

Do not misslead OP into thinking this is acceptable."
"While  pearls do have a ""flop"" to them, that base color is definitely off.

White cars are notoriously difficult to get right, since the color shifts under certain angles and lighting conditions

"
"Naw... look at the parking sensor, that little dot.  Its on the same angle and clearly matches the original color.

Why are so many people telling OP this is normal? It may be fine for you... you may accept this level of bad craftsmanship.  But please stop pretending like this is normal."
Yep our body shop did about 6 or 7 of these. They didn't match from the factory. This pearl white is a difficult color.
"Aluminum bodied cars are still a rarity. That said, I had an Audi A8 with aluminum and plastic next to each other. My paint matched."
"I‚Äôve owned many white cars and trucks from major car manufacturers.  The bumpers always match.  BMW, Chevy, Ford.  Even simple refinished bumpers matched.   "
"I can't say that white bumpers are off-colored for *all* cars across brands, but they're certainly off for my Honda's if you look close enough."
Tesla are way off on their white bumpers. You can argue there is always variance and Tesla isn't the only one with bad bumpers. But if a white jetta that was 25k has better matching than your 55k model 3.... Well... That's where all the justified wtf comes from
"Nooooo... regardless of material the color should match.  If not match, it should match MUCH better than this.  Go look at the front bumber if this is the case... if your car has color mixmatches this bad then i would suggest taking it in for warranty work.

It is important to check for things like this when picking a car up after repair.  Bring a flashlight... look at the panels from other angles.  Feel them... run your fingers over the transition.

Either they got the color mix off, they didnt prime properly, or they got the wrong color period.

 I would not accept that work unless it was seriously discounted.  Ive had better work from a $400 paintjob at maaco."
Badly calibrated monitor maybe? The bumper has a slightly more yellow/green tint compared to the side panel.
Need to blend it
"It could be both, but depending on the age of the paint job, white does tend to get ""warmer"" over time. It's the way UV interacts with the paint."
"He had a wrap on his car. The wrap had faded on the rest of the car and did not match with the fresh wrap, causing a weird look. The body shop decided it would be a better choice to wrap the whole car."
[deleted]
"Bad advice... they should match.  If they do not then you got a subpar repair.  If it was cheap and you are fine with that then okay... whatever.

But please do not tell OP this is normal.  If they agreed to a subpar repair to keep cost down then this may be acceptable.  But if this was a normal repair job then OP should take it back for warranty work."
"Stop being ignorant. You can get a Model 3 for just north of 35K now, which is just a bit above the nationwide average vehicle purchase price. "
Yeah let's all drop our standards because someone is poor.
Tesla approves body shops are usually higher end. I had the same issue on my door after a fit and finish issue and they fixed it. 
"Yeah. Had a tornado go over my house and blow roof tiles over my VW Tourans roof and hood. Pretty big dents. Repaired, unnoticeable and perfect color."
Sometimes sun vs shop lighting makes a huge difference. Sometimes you need someone not blind.
Colorblind* FTFY
Pollen? It‚Äôs February!
Orange peel?
Eggshell car paint? This isn't a wall.
"Yeah, if they‚Äôre just ordering a pre-painted white bumper from Tesla and slapping it on, they‚Äôre never going to get a perfect match. "
"Chrysler. It wasn‚Äôt mandatory. They offer it to you near the end of the lease for free so you have an opportunity to fix anything that needs to be addressed before you turn it in. 

The guy came to my house and went through the car with a fine tooth comb and gave me a report showing that everything was within ‚Äúnormal wear and tear.‚Äù You can just drop it off at the dealership but I‚Äôd rather have some documentation just in case. "
He had some little handheld device that he placed against the paint and the screen would display the thickness in like ‚Äú0.057 mm‚Äù or something of that nature. I‚Äôd never heard of it myself. Google it and a bunch of them come up. It‚Äôs pretty neat. 
Especially paint with depth (ie multicoat).
"There's more to it then what he said too lol

The reducer used in the clear, how the person sprayed it, how the bumper was cooked to cure the paint.

The list goes on.

There's a reason that really good paint guy's name their own price!"
[deleted]
"It is not normal... if you are buying a car and the panels are off by as much as OP's then move on, find another."
"Not sure what color white yours was, but it's important to note that the complexity lies with pearl whites. A regular flat white paint won't have the same extent of difficulty in paint matching."
Quarter panel. The panels that are factory white still that show the bumper color off.
"Yes, this is a common issue with new, undamaged vehicles fresh off the truck, from every manufacturer. Most car bodies are painted on the assembly line, while the soft parts like bumpers are painted on racks, many at a time. Paint is a fickle bitch. Even a shift in humidity level can alter the way a metallic color lays, causing a ‚Äúmismatch‚Äù. Most manufacturers have just accepted that it isnt always possible to perfectly match plastic bumpers to metal bodies. "
"Noo... this guy may work for a dealer but does not paint cars for one.

If the issue was UV exposure and matching then we would simply bake those panels under UV light until they matched closer.

Please just tell OP they do not match, he should discuss it with the repair shop.  It is not normal so unless his contract specifically called for some subpar work to save money the shop needs to fix it."
"OP is fortunate they are that close. I say notify the shop, share the picture, and wait for a little while with your car having spent time in the sun."
"The diff in color here is not UV.  Esp notice that the bumper is the less glossy piece.  If UV was the culprit i would expect the bumper to be shinier than the car due to the clearcoat breaking down.

Please just let OP know its off and if he is unhappy to take it back.  Its close, but if he paid full price for this repair then it should match."
"The only other solution is to put it in a UV oven to simulate exposure.
  
Proper ones are rather expensive and you rarely find them outside of EXTREMELY high end body shops"
"Ohio, I‚Äôd be happy to if the need should arise, but hopefully not ;). "
"I'd get it corrected, but it's not uncommon for it to happen "
"My comment didn't pretend anything, it suggested a closer look with another car as control to confirm. "
"I also drive an aluminum bodied car. The plastic panels match the aluminum ones perfectly. There‚Äôs no reason they shouldn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs what primer exists for. "
"Doesn't happen every time, but the for the record I have seen cars from all these brands with slightly off colors on the bumpers. Once you notice this, you start seeing it everywhere."
"Just curious, how many of those cars are aluminum body?  "
"No... looking at one right now in sunlight.  Took it in the garage and spot lighted it, looks spot on.

Maybe yours needs to go back for warranty work?"
(IPhone 7plus). With my brightness maxed I can see a very slight difference. Maybe I‚Äôm just going blind 
Mb thanks for pointing it out. Maybe paint will fade too?
"I‚Äôd agree with much of that, but most crap posts are not listed as a discussion topic.  I just cannot understand what there would be to talk about here."
Okay where are you getting your new bumper etc to match rest of car colors faded look?

"The certified auto body shop for Tesla Bellevue WA is terrible. My white Model 3 went there to have the front bumper fixed (from Tesla it was mismatching and had a bunch of flaws under the clear coat, including a paint chip). The shop has mediocre Google and Yelp reviews so I was a bit concerned already. They ended up ""spot-fixing"" a dozen areas on my bumper with a mismatching white (different sheen, no flake). It looks terrible and worse than before. I'm still in the midst of trying to get it resolved (Tesla's responsiveness is not great)."
"> Tesla approves body shops are usually higher end.

Yeah, some might be, but some aren't... I have a laundry list of things, not the least of which includes primer on my ultra white seats. Like a lot of primer. Broken clips all around, steering wheel was like 15 degrees off, they crashed into it in their shop, didn't put the bottom cover on the mirror, didn't replace all the clips on the front wheel well so it flapped around, charged my insurance for replacing a wire harness and just electrical taped the old one back together (Tesla themselves found that one out), AEB/Traction Control/Cruise Control/Auto pilot didn't work, tool scratches on the dash from replacing windshield, passenger door soft close broken, chipped paint on rivets that weren't secured all the way... Just to name a few.

The guy at Tesla seemed to suggest that Tesla Approved Body shops would go to the highest bidder and not necessarily the highest end shops."
Shouldn‚Äôt a reputable shop know that?
"shouldn't shops have a lighting which shows this better than outside?

But maybe it also makes it look similar...

I refueld on a gas station last week and they had weird lights that made my bright red car Yaris look very dark red..."
"Sun makes a huge difference, yes.

Not that big of a difference though. "
"I know that but that‚Äôs the best way I could think to describe it. 
Although..... https://youtu.be/DVPCElBAvDQ"
"I doubt it. Most parts come unpainted. And even so, it‚Äôs normal to ‚Äúblend‚Äù so that you don‚Äôt have obvious color differences at seams. Pearl White is notoriously difficult to match, although this seems like it was a3rd party formula that isn‚Äôt even close."
"I've heard of very few people who have managed to get a painted bumper of any kind directly from Tesla.  The only one I can immediately recall was great for the owner, as it was cheaper than even just doing a paint repair.  However, I have to imagine it was a returned part that was never used in a repair job or something similar, as I've directly asked their parts people if getting painted bumpers was an option and was flatly told no.  "
"*OwO, what's this? * It's your **8th Cakeday** GreyTheory! ^(hug)"
"I know this is quite a bit different but I work in manufacturer that stamps metal for gutter parts and shit. We have colors called 30 degree low gloss white, and 80 degree high gloss and it seriously looks like a low gloss version is on the bumper. Low gloss is almost matte in its finish while high gloss is well extremely glossy. I don't believe any amount of uv exposure is going to change this white into a different color."
Saving this lmao
"Fair enough... there are prob enough sub par repair shops around that might try to pass this off.  But OP did go to an approved shop, so i suspect thats why he even posted... they have some credability because they were approved to work on his model.

Op, take it back and see what they say.  They may have just missed a QC step and not noticed.  Or they may have thought you wouldnt notice... but at least find out. "
"Sorry... i placed assumption on your comment that he should do that so that he can see it was normal.  In fact i did the same thing with some google image searches to see if may Tesla was just having QC issues with paint.

Disregard."
Aluminum does not matter.  The paint for aluminum and steel are the same.  The paint for plastic is different and therefore is the problem.  Also there is some curing time where the color will slightly change.  The current owner might need to just wait a week.
"LOL.  Paint doesn't know what it's going on once primer is put over the material.  

And the rear fenders of the Tesla Model 3 are mild steel so your point it moot.

https://electrek.co/2017/08/22/tesla-model-3-body-alloy-mix/"
"S5, alum hood... kia plastic and steel hood.   No issues matching color.

Doesn't matter, it should match.  Regardless of your opinion please don't give this advice out."
"Latest Honda I own is a 2014 Civic sedan. Runs flawlessly, but the bumpers are slightly off-color (white). Warranty‚Äôs over, and it never bothered me enough to have it swapped. I also noticed other 9th-gen Civics with the same issue.

I went over (after posting) to check on the latest 10th-gen Civic models in my neighborhood, and noticed that the bumpers on those aren‚Äôt mismatched in terms of color. Seems they rectified the issue.

My current Mazda3 doesn‚Äôt have that issue either, but it‚Äôs in red so not quite the same."
That's weird. I can easily spot the difference on the one inch thumbnail on my MacBook pro. 
"The rest of the car doesnt look faded enough to even warrant concern.   i've painted bumpers for white cars with rattle can as a side job that matched better than this.  If its good enough for you thats fine, but please don't confuse OP into thinking this is the best a professional and approved repair facility can do.

Here... quick search shows story on front page today with a white bumper by a DIY non professional that came out great.

"It isn't about being Tesla fan or not. Its about understanding where you sit in the grand scheme of things. Relative to the world, everyone in the US is wealthy. Those of us in the middle class who live in the US, know that just isn't so. A mid 5 figure car price isn't a crazy, exotic, expensive car. Its priced just above the mid range options from most manufacturers. This is a fair and valid question to pose. Regardless of it being a $15000 car or a $50000 one, the work should be done right. Many people who work in the industry pointed out as much, in here. "
That‚Äôs pretty surprising for a place like Bellevue. 
I was just in a Bellevue Tesla trying out cars. So this is disappointing to me. Maybe I‚Äôll keep my Honda awhile longer 
geezzz.. any pics??
"If you're referring to the shop I'm 95% sure you are then yeah, they're pretty terrible.  This shop had the owner/son of the owner dating/engaged to the head of Tesla bellevue's parts department last I knew. They hold on to the few brand certifications they have and if they were to lose them a very significant percentage of their workload would be gone because they dont treat people the best nor was their work the best in my opinion."
"It really comes down to using the correct color codes, which they have, and sometimes the mix is wrong. When a customer comes to pick up the car, and it's moved outside, the paint color looks different.  It's more likely, and usually, correct.

In a perfect world, it would be caught before the customer gets there, yes."
"Yeah, they make lights that nearly perfectly mimic sunlight too. "
What lights are better than the sun?  I spend many thousands of dollars per year on bulbs and I havent found that one yet.
"20 year painter here .... there is no color change in a week due to curing..... most modern shops will bake the paint Approximately 120-130¬∞ For 30 minutes. Even the plastic parts. When it comes out of the booth it is cured, and ready to be color sanded and polished."
"If your paint is changing color after you got it out of the shop please go back.  All rep paint shops will cure the paint properly.

It should take YEARS for the suns UV to be able to do anything.  The paint is not still curing to the point of color changes."
[deleted]
"This is what i would prob expect... maybe some quality issues where matches are not the best.  But usually leaving factory the pieces are painted together so there are less issues.

Repair work can be harder... but still, the amount you are quoted includes making it match unless the repair shop is specifically calling out that it is going to be hard.

it prob doesnt bother most people... it would bother me though, unless it was a cheap repair i did to avoid insurance claim due to my own stupidity of hitting a pole or something.  But then there is that tradeoff...

But OPs pic shows a pretty bad transition... enough to cause serious debate in this forum.  If it wasnt bad id expect 99% of the people to reply ""whats wrong with thr picture, i thought there was going to be a dickbut"" or.. a ""when u see it"" comment.  But in this case, we all see it"
Weird. Will get lasik eye surgery and then report back. 
"I don't really care.

> Relative to the world, everyone in the US is wealthy.

You just proved my point. I appreciate that."
"I'm not that surprised. I worked in a shop in Bellevue for a bit and while a lot of the techs were professional, there was still a lot of seeing how much they could get away with because a lot of the rich folk don't have a keen eye for detail. "
They aren‚Äôt very responsive when you call them either. I almost bought from Tesla Bellevue but their customer service was lacking compared to Bmw Bellevue! 
"Despite the difficulty I've had with the Model 3 over the last 4 months, there still isn't anything else I would have considered instead of it.

That being said, if you don't want to deal with fit-and-finish issues, very long service times, and bare-bones customer service, you may want to wait for things to smooth out."
"Yeah, here's a couple. On mobile so hopefully they post okay. This is the auto body shop aftermath. I also have before pics but would be easier posting those on PC.

"Tesla has been sending out solid white paint chip kits for Pearl White model 3‚Äôs, so it might not necessarily be the shop‚Äôs fault."
"Color codes only go so far. Oxidation kills paint and colors will change over time regardless of a paint chip.  A good shop will do color spray outs to do an appropriate color match in natural light.  That said, bumpers tend to not color match the car as there are too many refractive surfaces/curves and paint tends to sit different on plastic vs metal"
"One side of my car is the wrong color by just a shade, the only thing that gives it away is the passenger front quarter panel looks off - that's the section that's the right color.

Looked fine in the shade, but in metal flake is a bitch."
"Wut m8... please for the love of god stop.  Steel panels do not reflect more polarized light than ""abs paneling""."
"I let it go because by the time I took enough interest in cars & car detailing, the warranty had ended.

Now, as someone who‚Äôs hobby is weekend detailing, I made sure to check for these sorts of paint quality issues before purchasing my new car (Mazda3 GT Hatchback).

That all said, there is more leeway in my mind for a Civic and Mazda3 to have paint inconsistencies. They‚Äôre both under $25k (before haggling) at most (top-trims), putting them firmly in non-luxury territory.

A car that I would be paying $50k for? That paint better be pristine and as perfectly matched as possible. I wouldn‚Äôt accept delivery of a Model 3 if the bumper‚Äôs paint was mismatched from the rest of the panels."
Or maybe jus ask the other three hunter__haleys?

*insert Microsoft bug team joke here*
Surprising to hear for sure. Having spent more time than anyone should at BMW of Bellevue I‚Äôd be hard to convince there‚Äôs any place that‚Äôs worse haha

Holy God that is awful.  
"wow, that looks very poorly done. Hopefully you end up getting taken care of by either tesla or a diff shop. :/ "
"While this is true, the keyword is *spray outs*. OP posted two extra pictures and it's not done that way, it's just poorly done spot repairs and some thin touch ups."

Agreed... the amount of people in here that say this is normal is surprising.
There can be only one

"In their defense, these often aren‚Äôt the kind of defects most non-enthusiasts would notice. Heck, even many enthusiasts wouldn‚Äôt notice, unless they‚Äôre into detailing.

I understand that Tesla‚Äôs appeal more to tech enthusiasts than other brands do. Nothing wrong with that.

But, as a result, I think many excited Tesla owners (or soon-to-be owners; congrats!) lack the same expectations from their cars as enthusiasts might.

That is, Tesla fans have stringent expectations for the technological aspects of their cars, and less so for the other bits - like paint quality.

(Not judging, of course. Not everyone has the same hobbies/interests.)"

"No, i just want OP to know he deserves better.  If this is the repair job he got then he should take it back and ask them to fix it.

The paint on the bumper and quarter panel should not be this far off.  Look at his parking sensor... it matches.  

Look at any google search of model 3 rear quarter panels.  This is not normal for OP.  I would maybe let you argue that Telsa has an issue color matching panels, and that a lot of model3 came out this way.  But they didnt.

Please just accept that OP's repair job is subpar.  I bet if he asks they may even fix it... the place prob thought it was good enough and that he wouldnt complain.

  But holycow, it looks like the wrong paint code.  "

Belissimo 
There seems to be a little man in the back seat
"I have been a longtime Ferrari fan, and I keep waiting for them to announce a plan for electrification. Konigsegg has one, and so does Lamborghini, and Porsche.

I understand why Ferrari is dragging its feet about it, but maybe the model 3 in italy will convince them. I really want to see EVs get a lightweight treatment, and not just with carbon fiber bits, but redicing weight where it counts the most, in the battery pack.

Its ironic that while no tesla can be called light weight, I think that tesla will be the lightest comparably weighted EVs for a long time coming, and when the roadster comes out likely with a next gen powertrain using a combo of dry cell and ultra capacitors, I think they can get the weight enough below 2T to compete in every metric with any modern super or hyper car, except with more practicality and reliability on top of being cheaper and faster. It will be the death of Ferrari if they arent careful."
Bella!

"My dream, but the Model 3 in Italy [starts at](https://3.tesla.com/it_IT/model3/design?#battery) 60.000 euros, about 68.000 dollars (for the base model), so it‚Äôs a bit expensive. I was there to see and test it. "

"Italian front plates are smaller than their german counterpart, but already reflect european guidelines. "
That looks like a ‚Äúpromotional‚Äù plate not a real one. 
The smaller front license plates are an option in Spain too. For Italy I understand why it is standard as it fits the Alfa Romeo fronts better ;).

Wow. No 35k...eh?
Look at the plate vs. the plate holder in the picture?
"There‚Äôs a reason I wrote size. AFAIK most of the EU has the same size plates as Germany, including Norway which isn‚Äôt even a member of the EU. "
"No, it's a real plate.

"Ci andai l‚Äôestate scorsa, per provare una Model S con mio fratello... ora io aspetto di provare una 3 performance, invece lui ha deciso di prendere la Roadster. Ottima esperienza, insomma!"
"Did you not have incentives for EVs before, or is it because the Model 3 is new and needs to be added to an existing incentive program?"
"You‚Äôd be correct, and that goes for pretty much all of Europe. It‚Äôs part of the reason why the vast majority of cars in Europe are manuals (you wouldn‚Äôt want drivetrain losses from an automatic, given how small engines are).

And, not just that, but cost. Manuals are cheaper than autos (even in the US, by a couple hundred usually), and so Europeans typically opt for that (since most know how to drive one).

Different market for cars, really.

(I know this doesn‚Äôt answer your question directly, but I thought it was a neat FYI since I used to wonder why manuals were/are so prevalent in Europe.)"
"Pretty sure they do. I checked a few years back for one near me(Bulgaria), but the closest place was Italy"
"Yeah I know, the ‚Äúentry level‚Äù model in USA is  different, Lower specs but for the Europe this is the base model (LR 4WD, almost full optionals)"
It will be about the same price. You have to add VAT and import duty to the price. This adds usually 30-40% depending on area. Then you have car tax which depends also on the country but add another couple %
What do you mean? Our prices are in line with France and Germany. France has a tax rebate of 6000‚Ç¨ but we're getting a 4000+2000‚Ç¨ one next month (4000‚Ç¨ base + 2000‚Ç¨ for turning in an old car) and if you live in Trentino there's more.
"I‚Äòm buying one in the Netherlands. It‚Äòs the cheapest option available right now (black, long range AWD, aero wheels) and it costs me ‚Ç¨65,120 with EAP.

The price across the eurozone is largely the same, the only difference is the VAT and other taxes or fees."
There is no mid-range or standard range with standard interior RWD yet. Then we'll start nearing $35k. Keep in mind that the US prices are excluding taxes and EU prices are including VAT.
Is it the year 2020 already? Ask this again in year.
"Not sure why you're being down voted so much. I came to the comments to say the same thing. It might be the reflections making lines look off, but I got the same ""this looks weird"" impression from this photo too, and I drive one daily."

L'hai preordinata? Facci sapere com'√®!
Roadster 2.0?
"No, we had no incentives before :)
Starting this year heavy polluters have to pay more, while EVs get subsidized."
Historically true but nowadays I don't think you lose much efficiency with a modern automatic transmission over a manual. In fact some automatics actually get better mileage than the manuals.
"I know about model S test drives, i wanted to book one but never did due to other things i had to do. I knew that they didn't provide test drive on the model 3 even when i checked a few months ago, even here in Italy
"
"No, it‚Äôs the same in the USA. We just don‚Äôt call the base model the base model, because that would be acknowledging that the officially-announced base model (which doesn‚Äôt exist) was misleading. 

So instead we pretend that the lowest model available is actually optioned up, even though the options we pay extra for are mandatory. "
"> Our prices are in line with France and Germany. 

Huh?

https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/acgdef/tesla_model_3_orders_are_now_open_in_europe_for/ed7synl/"
Exactly. Plus 10% import tariff and ~2000‚Ç¨ shipping cost.
Genuinely curious. Don't get the down votes... Oh well 
"dunno, not even a bad thing - it looks better than it actually does."
"S√¨, inizialmente voleva prendere una Model S, poi si √® reso conto che per il momento non gli serve un berlinone a 4 porte... non ancora, almeno! "
"I never said you don't get better fuel economy with an automatic. You most certainly do! As someone who drives a manual (and actively looks for manuals), I don't recall seeing a single car that got better fuel economy with a manual, while I was shopping for a new car a few months ago. At best, it's equivalent to the auto's fuel economy. Oftentimes, it's frustratingly due to a short 6th gear, causing revs to be higher on the highway than an auto would be (which is the case for my car: a Mazda3).

But given small engines, you want to make the most of the minimal torque available to move your car. You get more drivetrain losses with an automatic by virtue of having a torque converter. This doesn't mean you'll get better fuel efficiency with a manual. All it means is that power is lost from the engine to the wheels less so than in an auto. As you cruise along, the auto wins because it'll upshift more aggressively to save fuel than a human (typically) would.

It's admittedly hard to explain (and I'm not the best at doing so). Point is, fuel efficiency =/= less drivetrain losses.

E.g., you still get more drivetrain losses with autos, but they get better fuel economy due to having more gears, shifting more often, etc. But there is more power lost from the engine to the wheels nonetheless (than with a manual).

For reference, I get around 33 mpg driving my car aggressively, since I hardly ever shift into 5th or 6th gear while driving around town during my daily commuting. My car equipped with the 6-speed auto would shift into 5th & 6th far more often, and almost always keep revs below 3k RPM. I don't do that while I drive since I like having instant torque available to me at any point, and because I'm too lazy to constantly downshift whenever traffic slows down. The automatic would be far more diligent in using the most appropriate gear for fuel economy."
"For me it's not about the efficiency, it's the gear selection up hills and power loss during changes that I don't want."
Ah well that would suck then. Hopefully now they do
Those prices are after rebate. We're getting one next month. 
We are waiting for that Tesla factory in the EU! Bring it on :)
"I think the expression: 'eh?' might throw people off? 

&#x200B;

Of course its Tesla is no Audi. Do they have an ev car that is selling hundreds of thousands on the road and are people waiting for theirs in the same number also? 

&#x200B;

And no, I did not down vote you. 

&#x200B;"
"Lei √® single? haha

"
"If for nothing else, a manual is preferable because most car thieves in the U.S. don't know how to drive with a stick. Doesn't matter how good your MPG is if your car gets jacked.

I mean, electric is definitely the credible path forward for the environment, in which case manuals are obsolete. But unless you have a home where you can plug in overnight, EVs aren't all that practical. And in terms of dollars per mile, charging at a public station may not be that economical either, at least for now."
"Automatics will effectively ""drop a gear"" if you hit the accelerator hard so I don't know that there's going to be much difference in usable torque either. I'm a manual transmission driver currently and on an open road it can be fun to red line it  (even if you're not necessarily going any faster)... so I take your point :-)"
"You'd be surprised by some automatics now, though!

I drive a Mazda and love their transmissions - both their manuals and their autos. While I chose the manual for enjoyment reasons, I *did* test drive their automatic models, and it was great!

Unlike my experience with other automakers, Mazda seemingly programmed their transmissions to hold revs/gears until you tell it to. While I test drove a Mazda3 with an automatic, I noticed it didn't upshift until I told it to, even when it got to redline.

A good auto is a solid alternative to a manual, and Mazda's got that covered üôÇ"
"I'm sorry, but I don't follow. When I go to the french and italian tesla page and configure the same model 3, i get those price differences.

I'm pretty sure there's one price without any savings/rebates and the other one is with savings/rebates. Without any savings/rebates the difference is 60580 vs 53500, default configuration. The rebates only apply where you live anyway..."
"We already have one in the Netherlands, Tilburg ;)"
Wrong. It's how you'd say it in my language. But now I can see what you mean... 
"*lei √® straricco?

*Fixed =]

Complimenti per la Roadster 2.0! Comunque si la Model S √® ‚Äútroppa‚Äù, la M3 sembra perfetta per l‚ÄôItalia invece!"
"Completely agreed with everything you wrote.

I look forward to the future with EVs. That time is quite far away, however, at least in my opinion. Cities like San Francisco and LA are not the norm in the US.

Hence why I recently bought a new car with a manual transmission. Plus, rowing my own gears is just too much fun!"
"That sounds more like a semi automatic or flappy paddle gearbox? Where you only have an up or down. 

I suppose a semi auto would be OK in that regard because you can select the gear you want when going up hill so you not revving the crap out of a lower gear when you could be in the next gear up fine."
"If you press the ""View details"" button you will see a breakdown of the price.

France:

* VAT: 9.080 ‚Ç¨
* Incentives: 6.000 ‚Ç¨

Italy:

* VAT:  10.924 ‚Ç¨
* Incentives: 0‚Ç¨

&#x200B;

Starting from March 2019 we're getting a 4000‚Ç¨ incentive for the whole country, plus 2000‚Ç¨ if you trade in your car. If you live in Trentino there's an additional 2000‚Ç¨ incentive, and 4000‚Ç¨ if you live in the Bolzano province. We do pay a bit more VAT, but that's in line with any other purchase."
Are Teslas being produced there? Are we (EU citizens) saving on the shipping costs and import taxes? Nop...
"Mazda‚Äôs six-speed auto is a traditional torque converter auto. It‚Äôs just programmed to delay shifting as much as possible, to defer control to the driver when in Manual mode or using the paddle shifters. It will behave like any other auto when in Drive.

It‚Äôs not a DCT, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre wondering about."
"The trouble about the incentive in Italy yo wrote is if the car price is above ‚Ç¨60k is not eligible for the 4000‚Ç¨ government incentive. So if you buy the Model 3 + autopilot you‚Äôll be outside the incentive!

Fortunately the Italian parliament is still debating on this 60.000‚Ç¨ limit (debating on raise or delete it). "
Yes there are X'S and S'S produced in tilburg!
In much of the US the Autopilot doesn't count toward the car price since it is an accessory. Also I bet Tesla would change AP sales to be a 3 day grace period so that you could add it. 
Means we [EU] have X and S without tariffs? üò≥

You totally missed the point of the video.
"gg, ez"
Yay! :)
"1320 video has a few vids of teslas smoking almost every heavy hitting v8 'street beast' you can think of. Chargers, mustangs etc.

"Most drag cars do 0-60 in less than 4 seconds, but what you‚Äôre seeing is pretty much how it looks when a Tesla launches. I don‚Äôt own one, but I‚Äôve ridden in a Model 3 and let me tell you, I‚Äôve *never* felt anything close to that acceleration in any vehicle I‚Äôve ever been in."
That Tesla trailer was awesome! Thanks for sharing the links.
"Well, they should at least not have added the sound of a petrol engine into the video"

You will not find one of these machines within 50 miles of a trailer park 
"Yep, I'm pretty sure it's an allotment "
For the performance model (with pressurized air thrusters) it might actually come close to that.
"Notice how there's no gap between frunk and glass at all?  They're experimenting with different ways to have a wiper and keep that seamless flow, even if it means an ugly wiper because if the wiper is less ""messy"" than the gap it's worth it to achieve speeds over 250, and they're trying to break records with this car.  I'm surprised we haven't seen a dozen different designs already.  They do this with the doors in street cars now, as few seams as possible for better aero."
"Those are going to be thick white air, on a humid day especially."
"Just picture a formula 1 car next to you, and yet still faster than that."
"I hate to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù but it was *maybe* 1/8th mile no prep street racing. Ofc a gutted AWD electric torque monster will beat everything since there‚Äôs no room for any non electric car to get up top.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, P100D‚Äôs with ludicrous mode are fast as shit, it‚Äôs just that a lot of stuff is gonna beat it up top.

The new Roaster on the other hand...def gonna be a different story lol

EDIT: gutted and not gutter "
How‚Äôd they fair against audi‚Äôs s7?
There is no engine noise. 
Thanks for the context.
I know of multiple million dollar mansions within two miles of a trailer park. In one case its an 11 million dollar mansion. Trailer parks are everywhere but you might not always see them.
"Sure - let's play along with that theory... ;-)  
  
Do they have some kind of trailerpark avoidance system?  
If they cannot be within 50 miles of a trailer park, it would make them fairly useless for any kind of travel."
Good luck finding desirable urban  land that doesn‚Äôt have a trailer park within 50 miles. 
"Exactly and go straight out, they are not going to be yellow/brown and curl up easily like exhaust smoke as in
https://i.imgur.com/YQa8opN.png"
Any other street legal car gonna get close? Porsche 918 spyder maybe?
There‚Äôs one video of a guy gutting his Tesla and the rs7 stayed close when he raced it. That car was the only one that could put up a challenge out of all of the cars I‚Äôve seen Tesla raced 
Check Motor Trend‚Äôs YouTube video. They compare both cars 
"Dumb question, why the S7? Are they know for low range power/torque?"
No problem!  And you're awesome!
Seriously.  Silicon Valley has tons of them but they‚Äôre still really easy to miss. 
Try Europe.
"I bet that was a default car plugin in whatever they used to render, it looks like exhaust to me."
"Maybe, yeah. Any modified street car (i.e. corvettes, Supra‚Äôs, EVOs, Mustangs, etc) prob couldn‚Äôt beat it just because of the way power is delivered and loss of traction. 

But a super grippy very powerful hypercar might actually work."
"But muh hellcat

/- hicks"
A mclaren 720s is also one of the only street legal cars that can beat a models p100d in a 1/4 mile drag
Dude üòÇüòÇ
"In Silicon Valley, those trailers are still half a million."
I could see a big single Supra taking it out in the top end provided its tires are big enough
Beating a Hellcat in a street dig isn't exactly an accomplishment. They're notoriously bad in those situations. 
Yeah hellcats never came close 
"Not correct. The 100D will put down a 10.9 at best. A dodge demon will put down a 9.8. There are plenty of cars that will out drag it stock from the factory. A $55,000 460hp Corvette Stingray with drag radials put down 10.9 1/4 mile stock."
"Yup, with Teslas parked at some of them to be sure.  üôÇ"
"Well, a lot of things are going to take it too end considering it tops out at 155 or 160 haha"
"""You know the difference between a 600 hp Supra and a 1500 hp supra?  The 1500 hp supra leaves wider tire tracks setting the same ET."""
I know. I was poking fun of the fact that these muscle car enthusiasts think the hellcat is the greatest car known to man. 
Family saloon vs corvette with drag radials. The fact that the p100d is close to winning is very good. 
"If roll racing, mostly anything AWD would take it over 600hp.  P100D is only good at a dead stop."
"Yeah, it is funny how much people worship them. "
No they don't. Everyone pokes fun at how heavy they are. Kind of like we're doing right now.
The P100D has more than 2 times the torque and AWD. It‚Äôs basic physics that it should be quicker off the line. But a $55k car with less torque and power performs the same as it.  And the P100D is bad on a circuit track. 
"Not really, a lot of reviews say the most impressive part of the acceleration is when you put your foot down at 60mph. And then it would only be beaten if the other car is driving in a gear down which is unrealistic"
"Yeah but a hellcat isn‚Äôt capped at 150mph like a Tesla. I understand the Hellcat isn‚Äôt a come all, end all, but for 60k it really is a performance bargain. "
A 55k car that is meant to be fast. With drag radials. Tesla is not claiming that the P100D is fast around a track. A comparison between the P3D would make a lot more sense. 
"I corrected my previous comment. Just looked at youtube videos. Anything over 600hp and half the torque would take it from a roll. Also, you do realize it's not hard to downshift. How is being ""gear down"" unrealistic? The car is fastest from a dead stop."
"The P100D was meant to perform fast in a straight line. That was the design intent. It has a much much higher torque to weight ratio than the Vette. So it should be faster in a short straight. A Corvettes design intent was to be circuit track focus. It just also happens to be fast in a straight line.

While the P3D performs well, it is only good for autoX or short hot laps before the motor starts overheating or the battery gets very low and starts pulling power."
"[https://youtu.be/BHgh4\_1ksGQ](https://youtu.be/BHgh4_1ksGQ) here it is beating a Mclaren in a rolling race because the Mclaren had to change down. And what do you mean how is being down a gear unrealistic. Most of these cars are automatic and will not hang on to gears for too long unless in sport mode, which no normal person uses regularly."
The Corvette ZR1 has a 0-60mph speed of 2.85 seconds. And it costs $123 000 with no options. And it is made for the track. The P100D is a five seater. And the P100D is still faster than the corvette. No $55k corvette will beat the P100D. The P100D does 0-60mph in 2.4 seconds. 
"That roll race test was just a joke of a test because they knew the 720s would fry it in a roll race. As an example, the P100D will always be quick off the line from awd and max torque, but you saw how fast the 720s caught up. The rate of acceleration from the 720s is far higher. He started in 6th gear and let the computer downshift during the roll race. No one does that. lol. These cars have a semi auto mode which they can gear select. A proper roll race, the mclaren would be in 2nd gear and pull away with ease. 

Another case in point with objective evidence is the 1/4 mile time. The 720s set a 10.5 and traps at 150mph. The p100D gets in in 10.9 and traps at 118mph. That's a 32mph difference which shows that the 720s has faster acceleration. A P100D has the same trap speed as a Mustang GT which means from a roll, their rates of acceleration will be relatively the same after the initial torque jolt from the Tesla's electric motor.

There are not many videos of P100Ds roll racing on youtube because they are not that fast at a roll. For example:

[https://youtu.be/JPs2CoX\_aHw?t=144](https://youtu.be/JPs2CoX_aHw?t=144)

The the 720s is faster than the Lambo. The Lambo has 630hp and 442 ft-lb of torque."
"Everything is not about 0-60. lol. The Zr1 is faster than the P100D in a standing quarter mile by 0.2 seconds with a trap speed of +16mph (+25 km/h). The ZR1 is faster, all while being only RWD.

[https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/a19592831/2019-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-acceleration/](https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/a19592831/2019-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-acceleration/)

A P100D will not get past a 10.8 1/4 mile.

&#x200B;

A base $55k corvette also traps higher speeds than a P100D which basically means it out accelerates it after the P100D gets its torque hit. 

[https://www.corvetteforum.com/forums/c7-tech-performance/3372952-c7-fast-list.html](https://www.corvetteforum.com/forums/c7-tech-performance/3372952-c7-fast-list.html)

In roll racing, you will see the P100D quickly jolt ahead for a little while only for the other car  to start reeling it in moments later."
Ofc a track built car will win over a family saloon. The P100D is 600kgs heavier than the ZR1. It is meant to be a fast accelerating family saloon. Tesla is not claiming that it is the best track car. They are saying that it is one of the quickest accelerating cars to 60mph. 
"0-60 is just a marketing metric and while it measure speed to a point, it's not the ends of all means as there are plenty of cars with great 0-60 times but die after 60. There are heavy 300hp with 300ft-lbs or torque cars that can get low 4 second 0-60 with proper gearing.

Anyways the P100D achieves what it was designed to achieve and it was designed to be one of the fastest cars."
Agreed. 
The Euro style plates look so much better than the ones here in the US...jealous!

"I'm not the biggest fan of the model 3 aesthetics wise, but this is one of the best looking Teslas I've seen. "
Is the right side rear door opened?
Do they transport it or have a local factory?
i want it
I actually was thinking a while back that the M3 front has been designed with euro plates in mind :) 
"It has a license plate on it but you haven‚Äôt taken delivery?  Is this typical for a new car sale in Germany?  

From what I‚Äôve read here getting photos from Tesla prior to pickup isn‚Äôt typical."
Sorry but it‚Äôs not beautiful. But still a good buy. 
Aren't the driver's wheels on the right side of cars in europe since they drive on opposite sides of the road?
But you don't need the Front plates!... Jealous!
"but you have much more freedom for writing things on vanity plates. we in germany only get our city code, two letters, and up to four digits

And nosecone Model S looks much better.

"Right now you only have two options to buy: either the LR AWD (from 56380‚Ç¨) or Performance (67080‚Ç¨).

In the US those models cost 49900$ (\~44000‚Ç¨) and 60900$ (\~53700‚Ç¨).

All prices are before savings (tax credit, gas savings).

So yeah, we're paying quite a bit more for those cars"
I'm ditching the 3ft of snow in CO for Germany next week for 3+ years.

Only working tesla factories are in california. China will be next i think.
"Nope, that's only England."
"31 of the 50 US states do require front-plates.  Some states also require it but enforcement is spotty at best (ie California).

I'm curious about the front plate bracket.  How does it attach?  US plates are not as wide but are taller, and the bracket that comes with the 3 is kind of an L shaped and adheres to the lip of the front bumper, right above the louvers/vents.  Is that also the case on the Euro plate holder or is it mounted differently?  Thanks.

Beautiful car, by the way  - that color was a close second for me, but I ended up with MSM instead.  I still do love seeing it though - can't got wrong with the blue!"
"Honestly the car looks better with the (euro-style) front plates than without.

"Remember that the US price does not include tax, but EU price does. So the difference isn't that high.

Also both prices are exclusive of incentives which in some countries can be substantial."
"Heh. I went from SC to Germany. 6 months, from Feb to Aug. Pretty nice here in Stuttgart :D"
"For what it is worth, mine was badly prepped in the US too. All that annoyance melted away after a week of driving."
What‚Äôs wrong with the old storage hall? Tesla brings customers directly to these autoterminals to be able to deliver the cars as fast as possible. They don‚Äôt have much to invest in fancy locations like other automakers and why should they? 
Could one just visit them? Will it be on display? 
So did it travel assembled? Many cars are disassembled in order to ship them over the ocean. It's less effective any other way.
"There is a factory in Tilburg, but only Model S and X get assembled there."
And England is barely EU...
"I haven't seen the Attachment, will check it out as soon as My friend will pick me up soon!"
">Honestly the car looks better with the (euro-style) front plates than without.

It definitely is more complementary to the lines on the front of the car, I agree with you there.

I looked at a number of aftermarket front plate solutions for the 3 but ended up simply using the included plate holder.  In the end, I was glad I did, as it makes the plate curve slightly and match the lines of the front bumper."
Totally agree. The nose without the plates looks kinda weird. I'm glad we require front plates in EU
"Right, I forgot about the tax not being included in the US prices.

Afaik in Germany you can get a 4000‚Ç¨ tax credit"
"Yeah, but even if you buy a small not-so-pricey Car, you get that first experience in a pretty dealership. That's what I miss here. It was like a mess "
"I think this won't be a problem, they also have plenty of model S and X "
"Er no, ever heard of RORO ship? "
"They are shipped fully assembled, unlike S/X. "
"UK \*and\* Ireland. And Ireland is still very EU, thankyouverymuch :-)"
"I picked up mine and 3 employees had to handle 60 (!) deliveries that day. If they prepared a ceremony for every single customer, you probably would get your Tesla much later. Do your own ceremony by using this great car. "
"I care about what's inside the box, not any fancy packaging that I immediately throw away... But it seems lots of people like the ""unboxing"" experience."
Why haven't I heard of it before? Will check it out.

Here's the Model 3 with the preceding license plate:

"""Why you taken a pic of my baby?!"" "
All cars should have turned on taillight at all time.
"Is this a display model?  February 1st I came across a [model 3](https://i.imgur.com/dLA6pot.jpg) in the parking garage close to the Copenhagen Tesla store. License plate was one number off.

&#x200B;

Edit: And OP's photo is taken literally 200 meters from the Tesla store, so I think it's a test model."
"you: ""welcom to copenhagen model 3""  
TM3: ""Ay"""
Is it true that Copehagen is super damn beautiful everywhere? Sure seems like it- even in this snapshot!
That woman has some serious concerns about you taking her picture!
"Jesus what an ass, they couldn't wait 2 more seconds to let that lady finish crossing with her baby?"
"This rear end view is really growing on me, I used to think it looked frumpy  "
"The stroller or the car? ;-) Tesla should definitely make self-strolling baby carriages, with built in feeding, diaper changing and vigorous defense systems for fending off any stranger who comes near the stroller. ;-)"
Nice architecture!
I love being able to vicariously enjoy the 1st model 3s being delivered in parts of Europe.
That angle looks great and make me think the Y is going to be amazing 
We sure its not the test car? It is a P version in red.
"Love Copenhagen, love M3"
"[Maybe it, when it was being delivered nearby in Copenhagen](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DzRyX72WoAUlQiw.jpg:large).OPs picture was take just down the street from this picture, which was taken at the location where they park Model 3s ready for delivery - ""Ofelia Plads"" (Ofelia Square) on the harbor front."
"Wait why is that model 3 on the wrong side of the road?! Oh...right, crisis averted"
Danish license plates are so nice. Highly visible to older cops who wear glasses. I like that. 
"Bloomington, IN "
"For whatever reason, I just absolutely *love* the look of European license plates, especially on the 3."
"> Welcome to Copenhagen Model 3!

So the battery in that car is either dead or alive or both, depending on whether a cat has been observed in the car?"
"That lady can't understand electric cars, just look at her face"
That car really needs a bike rack in that city. 
that would be a ticket in finland. you don't cross the crosswalk until it's free of pedestrians. especially a fucking baby stroller

I can hear Jeremy Clarkson yelling this.
I'm eco-friendly GTFO my way
A picture of Copenhagen wouldn't be complete without a mother and stroller.
"Im glad to see this as the top comment, it was my first thought. You can't wait 3 more seconds?"
"She doesn‚Äôt look scared or rushed. So clearly the car waited ample time for the pedestrian to clear the road without stress or hassle. Some others here are being rather silly, taking this seriously!!   :/"
"She definitely has a ""why are you taking a picture of me you fucking creep"" face on too, completely oblivious to what that car is that he is actually taking a picture of. "
ay
Yeah I‚Äôd like to see a closeup of the euro tail lights.
Is it different in the US?
So Europe has the founder red?
[deleted]
"If you have a car with different lights than the rest of US cars, you are very easy to follow. Red tail lights quickly blend in. Having tried this, I recommend against unusual light configuration of any kind."
Definitely looks to have badging on it. I can't really tell if has a spoiler or not. 
[deleted]
all EU teslas come through the Netherlands
Actually it could be the display model... But last night I also saw a white one so for sure they started to deliver them
Old downtown area. Like any real old city most things can be up 500 years old and that seems work with the selection
"Yes, someone I know got to Copenhagen for a day and said all the people were gorgeous and so was the city. She's a cute person and even she felt homely beside the Danes. 

Maybe she just has low self-esteem? ;-) "
I spent a week there. Beautiful and clean city. Nice people. 
"It's an old capital city, and we've had some kings that enjoyed their prestige projects more than their treasuries."
Idk just looks like she‚Äôs biting her lip
maybe she shouldn't be out in public then
"It's typical in Denmark to drive after there's enough room. As long as you don't hit them it's fine. You can also see it's a red light, which shows the mom was slow and the Tesla was in the intersection on a red, explaining their haste."
I think the lady is more concerned that someone is taking a picture of her.
"This is completely normal in Denmark, don't get your panties in a twist üòÇüòÇ"
"I honestly think this is more efficient. The idea that you have to wait for the very last footstep to hit the sidewalk before going always seems inefficient to me.

By going at the earliest possible moment, it saves a tiny bit of time. This is not much and almost not worth it until you think about how it compounds in heavy traffic (especially those without turn lanes).

So this will increase traffic flow, without negatively affecting the pedestrian."
"I think it looks really good from a side shot all the way up to about 45 degrees.  But from that point to directly behind, I think it still looks frumpy. "
Well Ted Mosby its K√∏benhavn. Its a very old port city. Duh...
"Why? lol.

If you ride a bike in the city, then just ride your bike."
its like this everywhere in europe

"""I'm saving the environment in a car for a yuppie!""

I think Hammond would be driving a Polaris EV UTV and May would be in a Smart Fortwo EV."
"[No, but..](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/aqyk53/welcome_to_copenhagen_model_3/egl73vb)"
Best I can do for you https://media.autoweek.nl/m/qglyn6gbdbbu.jpg
North American version has the red turn signals.
No. Just the normal red
"Actually in the Model 3 the charge port is a seperate piece from the tail light.

[https://youtu.be/Oi2HkHD0Jqg?t=249](https://youtu.be/Oi2HkHD0Jqg?t=249)

Looks like it's not too big a deal to swap them either. The question now becomes whether it's a hardware difference or a software difference that gets you amber rear turn signals.... I know it's something I want, I hope someone manages to find out how it can be done, if possible."
That sounds super paranoid...
"It has a spoiler, I happened to see the same model 3 today (same license plate, also my first day in Copenhagen!). It‚Äôs at the tesla showroom right now.  I‚Äôd upload my picture of the spoiler if I knew a way to do so easily on mobile. "
Its green for pedestrians and probably also (traffic light not visible on the photo) for the Tesla taking a right turn. There is nothing unusual about the car turning ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the pedestrian. 
">You can also see it's a red light, which shows the mom was slow

Its red for cross traffic putting the lady crossing in the right of way? It doesn't matter if  she's ""slow"" - Elderly a slow too and I still allow them all the time it takes.  Shes a crossing pedestrian with a baby no-less. 

Nothing against you, it just irks me to see people that close to peds."
"Until the event someone loses balance and falls into you (legitimately or not), then you're screwed.  Dashcam footage or not, they will side with the Ped because you're driving too close.

Maybe that's the defensive driver in me, but I'd rather not risk it getting sued.  Especially in the city where im from, Peds **always** have right of way and drivers will be found at fault."
There's a slightly phallic looking church just out of frame on the right. Pretty sure that was designed by ol' Hammy D.
I guess you haven‚Äôt ever been to Copenhagen then.  
"Rule 1, please don't be so trolly/condescending."
I‚Äôve always thought brake lights should be RGB capable and fade from yellow to red based on how hard you are braking. So if someone is mashing their brake you can react to the color rather than having to react to the change in following distance. 
Why? Considering all other cars here have Amber signals. I didn't even think we could have red turn signals.
What the fuck America. I also noticed your cars don‚Äôt have indicators on the side of the car. How the fuck am I supposed to know you‚Äôre trying to change lanes if you‚Äôre next to me?
[deleted]
Hardware difference for sure. The wiring and amber LEDs aren't there on the USA cars. 
Well when using the car for Bank heists and etc you need to avoid being followed at night easily. It gets annoying sometimes
Yeah that's what I was saying? I think you're replying to my comment instead of the original.
"Yeah I get that, (although they love to get much closer, I've had my ass brushed by an impatient Mercedes)"
"Being constantly afraid of getting sued is not something most Europeans think of.

Besides, you wouldn‚Äôt make it wery far in an Europen city during rush hour traffic if you‚Äôre not ready to push your way over a crosswalk the moment there‚Äôs an opening in pedestrian traffic, since most intersections have the green light on at the same time for both turning drivers and pedestrians. Waiting too long will cause a traffic jam and a lot of angry honks at you."
">  I'd rather not risk it getting sued

That's not a thing here, so it's not a concern. I'm not saying go all out on hurting pedestrians by any stretch (and this driver clearly isn't, by our standards there's plenty of room there), 'cause there are repercussions of course, but getting sued for everything isn't something we generally do."
"They can do that even when you wait lol. So it‚Äôs not like it matters if their goal is to instill a lawsuit. Hell, they can physically (and obviously) jump out and make it a he said, she said, and you‚Äôre still screwed anyways.

So if it doesn‚Äôt matter regardless, why not make traffic more efficient?"
"Why would you load up a bike on a car, if you're going to be riding around the city?"
[deleted]
"Technologically easy to implement. Government regulations on the other hand... well, you might have an easier time demolishing a mountain with a shovel."
"That's why I'm really glad that most modern cars flash their brake lights or hazards when braking hard.  
Seeing it gives you an ""oh shit"" moment that definitely wakes you up.   

BMW tried a similar system when they introduced the 1 series. They added a second pair of brake lights which only illuminated when braking hard. But most people didn't know what they meant so the effect wasn't the same as the flashing ones. "
Many (at lest German) cars will flash the brake light if you brake hard.
"European market regulations mandate turn signals to be amber. Carmakers like making rear turn signals red for aesthetics. Examples besides Tesla include Volvo, Kia, VW and BMW among others. Some of their models in the US use red rear turn signals. "
Usually on the mirrors most cars have indicators. But in America they tend to just floor it and force then selfs in 
"Side markers in America are in the front and rear, on the side. Yellow and red, to show the orientation of the vehicle."
Good luck in getting the parts. Tesla is known for lack of parts.
"Rats.. are you sure of the wiring?

I'd have thought the smart decision would be to have one version of the wiring harness and the tail light just responds to the signal pin differently."
"Usually, when doing bank heists, I don't use blinkers at all when driving away. /s"
"No, I think they're saying the opposite of what you said. You said the Tesla had a red. It appears as though the red is for cross-traffic."

"It's possible you're provoking flack because of how aggressive/assertive your comments are. It's fine so long as you're attacking the argument and not the person. 

Edit: The guy you were debating deleted everything he said. I understand your point now. In future, please help us defeat these trolls by starving them instead of feeding them. Cheers"
The flashing is a good alternative for sure. 
"It‚Äôs the dumbest thing, can‚Äôt tell if somebody half hidden by other car is using turning signal or pulse braking "
Model 3 doesn't have mirror indicators. Would be nice if it had.
I never saw any when I spent a week driving in LA. There should be an indicator on the panel just above and behind the front wheel. Makes it MUCH more obvious when someone wants to change lanes and you can see their front or rear indicators.
"He‚Äôs talking about indicators (things that flash with the turn stalk) not side markers (side lights that come on with headlights).

In most of the rest of the world it‚Äôs compulsory to have an indicator on the side of the car, usually located on the fender between the front wheel and door, or on the mirror itself."
"Yes, 100%. I've looked on our car. The tail lights are ""dumb""... just LEDs. There's an unpopulated pin in the USA outer fixture connector, I presume this is for the turn signal. "
"...right, and so I will ask for a third time.  If your method of transportation in Copenhagen is cycling, why even use a car in the first place?"
Really? That's odd. Especially considering all of the tech in the mirror not even a blinker haha. 
"In the US the side marker is in front of the front wheel.

Modern cars can integrate this into a single headlight unit to satisfy the requirements."
"We do have them, but for some reason its usually only luxury cars that have them."
"That sucks! Thank you for the info, though."
"It's very common to transport your bike using a bike rack here. Could be husband and wife where one drops off the other and their bike at work so they can bike home, parent taking a child to school in the city and the child biking home, driving from the suburbs but biking the last bit to work because parking is a nightmare in the city centre, whatever the case may be. Plenty of reasons why you'd need a bike rack in Denmark and by extension Copenhagen, so generally speaking they're very useful. Why OP brought it up in this specific instance, I do not know, but I'm fairly certain that's where they were coming from anyway."
Maybe if you don't live/stay downtown...
My guess is that it is not common in US cars.
People bike more than 50 (ether) to work if they need to around here. I know a guy who is a really good cyclist and he only takes a train to save time after 50.
