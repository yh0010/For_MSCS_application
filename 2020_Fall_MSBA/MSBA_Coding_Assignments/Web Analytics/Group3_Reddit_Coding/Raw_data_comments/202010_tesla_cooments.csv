"Super cool, the details are very helpful! Can’t wait to do this in cybertruck"
This is awesome! Thank you!
"I was recently camping in my 3 and met a S owner at a SC who had his car set up for camping as well. He removed the back seat bottom so the seats lay flat when folded down (I actually like the slight incline).  But he also told me he had a board that he laid across the front seat and console that made a flat area large enough for his son to sleep on, so they could camp with 3."
Awesome! I'm doing the same in early December at a state park here in Texas. Ill hook up to the 30 Amp RV outlet at the campsite and test out the TT-30 Adapter for Tesla Model S/X/3/Y Gen 2 from [EVSEadapters.com](https://EVSEadapters.com) that I just got. Ill post pics/summary when I am done - this made me even more excited to do it.
Love the views!!! 😍
What is the width at the wheel wells?
Taking mine out for a day trip this weekend
"That’s a cool idea. I might look into that for our S. Wont work in the Y, though, unfortunately. I know most people like the center divider area, but I miss it being wide open."
"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1316454051693895680

I thought this was a joke, had to check myself

so the price effectively dropped ~5500$

nice"
"Also the Model Y 7-Seater is about to go into production

6/2019: $80,000  
5/2020: $75,000  
10/2020: $72,000 -> $69,420"
Wait what? Is this for real? Actually dropping another $2500?
"tears for Lucid Air base that's coming out in 2022 with 406 EPA miles and 69,900 USD after 7500USD tax credit."
"Anyone know why the gauntlet must be thrown?
Feeling Out of the loop here."
"Grandma: “why’s it $69,420 and not just $70,000?”"
Thank you Lucid!
"My goodness, I think I have to buy the S now"
"Lol, Elon winging it. 

And I absolutely love it."
This is the way
"> Oh, you have a paper car that's $69,500?  That's cute.  We have a real car that's $69,420"
"Jfc. I bought a new S on the 9/30. Lost $5570 in 14 days

Edit: picked up on 9/30"
"I bet Elon sits at his desk and draw the ""Super S"" all over his documents and draws a penis on his co-workers work and giggles when they see it.

It's just weird Elon is going through this high school phase so late in his life."
TSLA price target updated to $694.20
# N I C E
"Wow. It's be coming super affordable. Very close to what I want to pay for my next car. Not as close as i would like to believe, though."
"Haha epic joke from Lord Elon

The money lost from changing the price will be recovered plus more by the free advertisement, like always."
Nice.
"Why not 42,069?"
"I bought Model S two weeks ago and value just dropped down by $5500... feels bad, man..."
Model X dropping too?
Savage
You have to admire the commitment to the joke or whatever you want to call it.
r/wallstreetbets is losing their shit right about now.
"At 7:17pm it is 69,420 second into the day"
RIP everyones resale prices
What a gem. He's crazy but it's so enjoyable.
[deleted]
*Nice*
"Nice.  Next refresh I can definitely see myself trading in my 3 and getting the S.  400mi and 3.7s is amazing for this price, just would like to see changes to the exterior styling and hopefully interior space."
All praise the meme lord
"Lucid right now is like, “fuck”

They probably were thinking release low price now then raise it later. But they weren’t ready for Elon to drop S price lol"
6.9k upvotes lol
"As a consumer - awesome. Love to see competition drive prices down.

But why? Why is TSLA so reactive to what Lucid is doing? They're competing against literal air right now. You can't buy a Lucid Air, you can only reserve it, and it doesn't arrive until *2022.* Come on, exercise some strength on price leadership. Model S is a better car right now than Lucid Air because it exists. If Lucid announced the Air would cost $50K, would they move the Model S price down to $49420? Of course not, that'd be crazy.

Whoops, Lucid promised that back in 2017: [https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/lucid-air-base-price/](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/lucid-air-base-price/)

I'd like to see Lucid deliver a single car at $70K before Tesla started reacting. Or is the point just to give away profits to drive volume?"
"Q: So how much does your car cost?

A: Oh, I know exactly how much it costs. I never forget the price of my car :-)"
can you remind me of the „prophecy“?
Knock that zero off the end and you’ve got a deal!
Nicccce
Why an S? Air Suspension with active dampers
Do Model 3 awd performance model $42069 next.
👌 nice.
This is a perfect example of why competition is good for consumers.
"Next stop model 3 long range changes to 42,069"
"Who says Tesla needs to spend money to advertise?   A free tweet and tons of free advertising, childish or not.   Musk is a genius."
And I still can’t afford a Model S.....
God I fucking love elon ahaha
At least we know it's not dropping any time soon.
That’s pretty funny honestly
"Wow now i only need $59,420 and will buy model S, can't wait😂"
Internet = BROKEN
Which version?
Nice
Big if true
I’ll be the first to say it.. nice
69 420... Nice.
"A lot of attention here, sooooo

P3D ludicrous or equivalent sometime?"
*cries in UK*
That's pretty cheap considering the 0-60mph.
Nice
Get that down to 25k and we'll talk
"So much for all the ""but our depreciation is less""."
Time for an old-school “blowout” ad like a car dealer. Model S clearance days!
Nice
Nice
Nice
Nice.
"sorry if I sound like a complete noob. If anything I only had aspirations for a model 3, and I was under the impression that the Model S would have been phased out by now...

Does this make the model s worth buying? P.S. I live in Taiwan, where at best I am hoping to buy either a model 3 later on or a Gogoro electric scooter in the near future."
I want this car. I'm kind of obsessed now. But I'd have to sell my current favorite car to buy it. Damn. Tempted.
"Thank you, Damien Thorn."
Nice
Player 2 as enteterd the game
Nice
He is one of us
Nice
That absolutely should have been 69.
69 420... in Elon fashion
Nicee
Nice.
Woot! Been holding off on the Model S since 2012 because it was a couple thousand too expensive for me. Especially compared to the competition that might come to market in 2022 or 2023! /s
Yes! One of the benefits of having actual competition.
"What about Canada? We legalised marijuana first, Elon! Why you hate Canada?"
Elon Musk - the most successful teenager ever 😂
This is awesome.
r/fellowkids
That's fucking cringe
Unfortunately this doesn't apply to Europe. :-/
He said the sex weed number 😳
"Now if only the model 3 could drop a few thousand in the UK to avoid the luxury car road tax. Electric vehicles are free to tax but, because it's so expensive, you also have to pay a yearly tax which sucks ass for poor bitches like me because it makes owning a Tesla unrealistic as I'd be maxed out with just the monthly payments and insurance. Hell of a sales boost I think."
Nice.
I will buy one just because he priced it that
"I’m still waiting for the 42,069 offer..."
"Also live on their site.  
Splash screen even!"
"Elon’s about to push the Tesla engineering team to increase the range to 420.69 miles. 

A Model S with 420.69 miles of range for $69,420."
69 420...Elon likes sex and ganja.
Did the price on the performance S not change?
Good stuff. It's hard to imagine Elon would do this in response if he didn't feel the Lucid Air is a decent competitor.
Sold
I fuckin love him so much.
Absolute madlad :')
"Reduce 2,570 just to make a joke?  👍"
So much for claiming Tesla is an appreciative asset.
Just update the fucking car already.

The man is the definition of MadLad. I imagine his executives have just give up on trying to control him and just rest their hands on their foreheads as does these great little stunts

Elongated musket gun is now the maddest of lads. There no debate to be had. Somebody get the emerald tablets and carve this one in for eternity.

Still too damn expensive for the average American.

Not supposed to be $420 calls not $720
69 and 420? Epic
£74k in the UK ☹️
Is this a Model 3 refresh.
Hahahahaha
Lower the prices on the Model X Elon! I'm very tempted to pull the trigger!
Nice nice
Blaze it
Is this supposed to be a bargain now?
Nice
I have to make changes yourself.
But my genes won’t change the price!”
Tesla’s marketing department is scrambling right now lol

+10% to stock price for added meme lord value.
Nice.
"Is anyone else tempted to sell their dream car and go for the top of the line?

It's like cheating, though. Can't give up my dream husband for a replacement that could be a disappointment. Damn."
Does this change my decision on whether to upgrade to the S instead of buying a 3? Just a daily driver.
Lowered the LR+ but not the P :-(
Not seeing price changes in other parts of the world. The joke is that the rest of world (maybe not everywhere) is expected to pay 15k USD extra over and above tax and import duties.
"Elon, can we please get prostate ticklers on the driver’s seat?"
Does it include auto pilot and super charge? Or do we have to pay extra?
420% of people have similar struggles with weight.
Guys should I wait a year and see if Tesla makes 25k cars?
"$69,710 would have also been acceptable"
How much in CAD?
Still can't buy it 😫
Base Model S or Performance Model Y/3? Almost in same price point. Interesting what consumers will go with. This may be another resurgence of the Model S.
Nice
Elon is as immature as a bunch of high school kids
Think this drop finds its way to used cars from tesla.?
Oh yeah 69....420 baby
"Meanwhile, in Australia the Model S Long Range is still $180k..."
Sweet I'll buy three now.
Lmao
"I find it amazing how so many are unaware of LUCID and their tesla ""killer"" car, they lowered the price of their soon to be sold entry level car to 69.5k so elon responded. the new plaid S was in response to Lucid's top end car.

[https://www.lucidmotors.com/](https://www.lucidmotors.com/)"
"This a joke, right?"
Anyone think this might mean the model s is now using 4680 cells?
Nice
Tesla should focus on quality instead of memes.
Sorry totally miss read this. I thought they were bringing the Apple charger down in price. My bad!
69 420 nice marketing. Get more rich frat boys in. Make it cheaper for the paycheck to paycheck boys later.
Noice
"69

420

Rich millennials know the perfect price when they see one."
"Now if they bring back FUSC, I'd be all over it."
69 420 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
"they should offer custom financing:

69 payments of $420..."
"I see the updated price on the US site, but the price still shows $102,000 CAD. Hoping to see the updated price reflected up here as well, which should be around 92-94k."
Looks like Performance price didn’t change
"question for me now, is the S worth $18K more than the Y?  i ordered a Y but always debated getting the S."
Id be pissed if i just bought it.
This is no man...this is a god.
Nice
"69 - Noice, noice, noice ...

420 - Elon is killing it with no scope...


The meme is freaking real, well played."
"I still can’t get over how “plain” these Teslas are.  

I mean, I appreciate them as cutting edge engineering and sincerely believe that electric cars are and should be what we will (all) be driving in the future.

I can’t wait to get one, when I can actually afford one (an electric car, I mean).

Having said this, the Tesla design language is like “anti-design” it’s like they intentionally set out to create the most featureless range of cars possible.

Even the interiors are sort of unnecessarily “plain.”"
"Is this just Tesla pulling demand levers/passing on savings, or is this a big hint that we're about to see a Model S refresh?"
didnt it drop 2000$ yesterday??
"69,420 

nice"
"Tesla is being forced to react to other players in the EV space. 

First it was Porsche putting the Model S on its heels with performance numbers that were so good that Tesla had to announce the Plaid in October 2019.  Then Lucid came out with the Air with numbers so good that it left Model S over 100 miles back on 3rd party observed range tests. Following up on the range, Lucid then showed performance specs that made Tesla throw in the towel on the 2020 Plaid (coming Summer 2020!) and so now it's Late 2021. Finally, Lucid announced pricing that undercut Tesla by $2000 so Musk announces they're dropping prices again. Why is Tesla so reactive and not leading with their performance and price?"
He should be president
HAHA FUNNY SEX NUMBER 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Haha 😂 epic Mr musk 👌 imagine if   😳 he gave away a free 💲 Tesla car with weed paint on it 🥦🥦,,,,,,,,,,,,,👉👈"
Reddit moment!
We sure this isn’t an attempt at a joke? Prices online have not changed
Just shows how arbitrary the prices are for these fucking things.
Is this a Model 3 refresh.
"haha le funny sex AND weed number?!?!?!?!?!!?!?

reddit moment"
"There’s people that are actually getting upset about this, it’s insane."

"Elon is like the out of touch grandpa trying his best to impress the kids. And from the looks of it, ppl are actually buying his ”people’s billionaire” bullshit."
"All very well doing tricks like this for new buyers, but there was a day when they dropped £40,000 off the Model X overnight, thereby dropping £40,000 of the value of the one I had.

We bought it for £146,000 and sold it for around £75,000.  That's 50% depreciation at little over 12 months old - I don't think I've ever seen a vehicle depreciate so badly.  I certainly won't buy another Tesla for that reason alone."
Elon musk is that fully grown adult that still posts memes on r/teenagers
decreasing the price instead of increasing the quality
Some full on cringe here.
Elon Musk.  The attention whore of attention whores.
[don’t buy out of warranty Model Y
"God what a child. Like, cool, that’s a solid price cut, but goddamn it Elon stop finding new ways to embarrass yourself."
"And? 

Am I supposed to celebrate yachts being slightly cheaper too?"
That’s just cringe tbh

I would not trust a car this guy made
this is the stupidest shit
How some of y'all still think this man is gonna save the world absolutely astounds me
This man is a child. Hes a little too powerful imo.
I will be impressed when we can fully charge a Tesla from a dead battery in less time that it takes to fill a gas tank on an ICE vehicle.  I do think that someday we will get there with electric vehicles.
"Real mature, Elon"
"LoL still around 100,000 USD here in Japan. Sad!"
"But this is with the slower-charging 18650 battery cells, no?"
Is that because of unlimited demand?
Is Elon still trying to help the pentagon use spaceX to have weapons satellites to police the world? Because if so fuck that guy forever
"This makes me not want to buy another Tesla, the brand is becoming too embarrassing."
Elon is so lame
Funny billionaire who has children working in cobalt mines said the funny number!!
How does the board not replace someone making sweeping business decisions based on epic maymays.
Isn't Elon Musk rich because his Dad owned an emerald mine in Africa? Does his money literally come from blood emeralds? Does he have all this money because of colonialism? Just curious
No thanks I rather have a gas burner that costs half that
What a chud of a human being. Why not go spend more time with X A e 0012 you nerd.
"I have an Elon musk shrine in my room but

this was funny the first 24 times. It's not funny any more. He needs a new joke ok. Ok."
"Fucking loser, elon musk"
Elon is a rotten cunt
At this point I'm not even checking if Elon's tweets are real anymore.
Lmfao what a goddamn meme we’re all living in
Nice
This is the way
"I took delivery Tuesday. With the two price drops this week, I’ll be received ~$5k back as a check. A nice surprise!"
It's dropping by \~$2.5k.  Current price is $72k.
Most likely it is because of the refresh coming in Q1?
Too bad it didn't line up with being dropped by tree fiddy
Pic looked like a Photoshop
Has he told the European offices? as they still have it listed at €78K instead of €58k
"Much like the new price of the Model S, Elon is very much a meme at this point and I think that’s what he was going for."
The rumor proves to be correct again...
how about Model Y RWD
"> https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1316454693489516545?s=20

I wish they'd show off a real one. I'd get a 7 seater if I thought there would be room for a real human. Going to be pissed if there is and I didn't hold out."
Oh man I can’t wait to see it
"If it has rear facing seats I’d be interested. Currently looking at a used minivan for my videography business (rolling shots of cars), but an emissions free vehicle would be great."
"Everyone is so excited about this, but it just seems too small for this. I am hoping to be proven wrong"
I think it's going to be a little cramped the back. More like a 6.9-seater.
Any word on that Dorito truck? I wanted to see a production model of that monster
"My model X 7 seater is painful in third row, I can’t imagine in the Y"
Wait has a brand new S price dropped 30k in 2 years??
"oooooh, he missed a big opportunity by skipping over  $80,085"
Mmm don’t stop... I’m almost there
It’s dropping $32 a day on average haHa
Lmao its like the opposite trend of their stocks
"Thank you!  
This post deserves tons of upvotes.  
I’m glad to see that they have overcome the loss of the tax credit... and then some!"
Depreciation...
"Yep!  Just announced on twitter.  Also,  model Y 7 seater available December"
"For people to start buying the S again is going to require a badly needed facelift. 

At this point there is little reason to pick the S over the 3."
"Such a huge profit hit, all for a meme

That's elon for ya"
"By the time this car comes out, the S/X will be on the new architecture with probably 600 miles of range lmao"
"And that’s only RWD. The AWD dual motor version is supposed to come Late 2021 but for $87,500 with same range.

Plaid MS will be out then and I’m assuming there will be a LR version too with way better range. Who knows about pricing but if 18650 cells are already better it’s not gonna be good for Lucid."
Interesting that Tesla is threatened by a car arriving in 2022. Lucid Air seems to be a competitive offer.
"Tesla in 2 years improved the Model S so much and the price decreased 30k, can't wait to see what they offer in 2022"
"Lucid announced the Lucid air at *$69,900 after tax incentives. Elon just undercut lol

(I had it priced wrong @69,500,  thanks to the redditor that pointed that out)"
Lucid announced thier own EV at a similar price
 To **throw down the gauntlet** means to challenge. The term derives from the time of medieval knights when a knight would offer a challenge by **throwing down** his **gauntlet** (a metal glove which formed part of his suit of armour).
"For the memes grandma!

"Bought a 2014 P85D for $43k instead of a model 3, couldn't be fucking happier with my insane speed, luxury, cool factor, and upgraded suspension, sound system, etc. I knew I was giving up FSD, but I only cared about highway autopilot. Put the money I could have used to pay off the 3% interest car loan into Tesla Stock instead along with the other money I have in there. Basically can buy two more Teslas with my earnings alone.

"You didn't lose anything. If they had left the price alone, you'd be in the exact same shape."
"I know it's not the same.. but for peace of mind, it's best to compare the difference in price that will exist at your eventual time of sale. This price drop dinged everybody who currently has a Model S.. although it naturally has a greater psychological effect on you.

For non-peaceofmind.. of course the thing you're doing is comparing how your decision compares to waiting another couple weeks. That's what we all do, but it bashes us around without a lot of reason. There's no way to know.  (at least that's what I tell myself after buying some 2080 Ti's before the 30x0 card reveals..)"
They'll price match you
Picked up same exact day. Model S LR. This is wild
Most news cars lose 15-20% right after you drive off the lot so you’re actually ahead of the game
You should ask 75/60 owners who bought right before the 60 was cancelled how they feel. Was much more painful.
To me it feels like you lost 70k.
"Definitely feel your pain as I was involved in this exact scenario! I had purchased a Model 3 Performance (stealth) in November of 2018 with FSD just before they cut the price on it by $5,000. Then in January, they started giving FSD away for free to everyone who bought EAP.

So it's not an uncommon scenario, I'll just say welcome to the club!"
I'm in the same boat... Picked up Model S on 9/28... Lost $5500 value in 2 weeks.
"I’m pretty sure someone buying a $70k car doesn’t really care about $5k. Like crying over spilled milk

Edit: Wow looks like I hit a salty jugular with this one! So many salty tears in the air, it's so musty lol"
"I picked mind up today 😂😂😂. I feel your pain. Let's just try to enjoy our cars and not think about it

Edit: seeing you guys are saying they will price match within 7 days. But I bought a used Raven 2019. If I had known this price drop would happen I would have gone for new"
"Don’t worry, you will make it right back since your Tesla is an appreciating asset /s"
Well you got an outdated car anyways so there is that
Is it just me or does that just seem incredibly annoying?
Hmm.  Maybe refresh will be called SS ?
Yeh I should buy some more
Lol. I prefer their upfront pricing compared to the tired old dealership haggle
Nice.
That’ll be the long range rwd MY
If resale value is driving your car purchase you’re not gonna have a good time. Very fee vehicles have been good investment vehicles (no pun intended).
I wonder if you can recover some of the loss.  Have you tried contacting Tesla?

"Probably because the model s is selling less than ever. So it won’t have a huge impact on their bottom line. Plus Elon likes to get free marketing whenever he can, and this is def viral meme quality, and he rides the lucid press cycle."
Undercutting Lucid because they can
Nice
"The Lucid announcement was an excuse, not the reason, to lower the price."
"> Or is the point just to give away profits to drive volume?

Quite possibly  - Model S and X sales have been eclipsed by (and presumably at least partially cannibalised by) 3 and Y, and there is presumably spare capacity for S and X manufacture?"
Obviously not.  They would move the Model S price down to $42069

Won't they reduce the price everywhere though? I think that's what they normally do.

Is this confirmed?

Pretty sure those cells are still going through testing and a year or so away from mass production. We should see those soon though.  I suspect the price drop is more to compete with Lucid and to reflect the cost savings from mass production.

Isn't that kind of looking at it backwards? They were leading, and now they are leading again - just others were forced to beat them before Tesla turns around straight away and regains 1st place."
It’s because Elon isn’t just a tired old CEO who’s one goal is to increase the stock. He’s building out a vision that people are buying into.
Model S is the 2nd in Tesla's lineup at the original roadster

"Nasa did have a successful experiment on inertial confinement fusion. Basically a small crystal of erbium was pumped full of deuterium atoms with a diamond anvil until it started fusion.

"> Also the Model Y 7-Seater is about to go into production

hopefully with less quality issues compared to the current Model Y."
They're making more expensive ones not less expensive ones.
"Also checking in for leaks on the RWD, hoping for new tax credits and announcement of the RWD say... Jan 1?"
Probably seasonally weak Q1.
I test drove a Model Y on Monday and I cannot see how an adult will be able to fit back there.
"I have a Y, and I don’t see how it could work. The roof starts sloping immediately after the rear passengers heads. At 6’2”, my head nearly hits the glass roof in the back. 

Maybe you could fit children back there. If they’re small children. 

Even the X is super tight, IMO, and it’s a fair bit bigger inside."
"iam fine with kid size seat, the rare facing seats are sweet in the Model S, how often do you wanna fit 7 adults in a car, and expect it to not be a large SUV."
That pricing history is only for the long-range model.  They have had lower-range models below $80k for [many years](https://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/08/tesla-adds-model-s-70d-all-wheel-drive-75k/).
"Tesla's don't depreciate!

I always found those articles funny. They always compared the used price to the current new but they've been reducing prices pretty consistently."
"Yes, it's great overall, but terrible if you bought ab S in 2018"
"Yep. This is across the board too. List on my Model X 90D was $117,750 with destination. A Model X Long Range now would cost you $92,190 with the closest match of options. That's a $25,560 price drop. It's also faster, with a hundred mile longer range, adaptive suspension, faster MCU, and a bunch of little improvements. Even if you add back in the $7,500 tax credit I got it's still an $18k drop for a better car."
Did you read his comment?
How to devalue your product 101
"Or 80,081.35"
What does that mean?
The performance dropping as well??
"Well, it is a nicer car. Tech isn’t as good, but air suspension, range, the fastback, and the general quality could be worth it to some people"
Do you think it looks bad or are you just bored of it? I’ll give you the plastic oval era was bad but I think it looks great now.
"More range, faster performance, air suspension, proper front display, better materials, better exterior look, status, to name a few."
"I have a 3, but I'd love to have an S.  The longer range, the beautiful styling, and the better interior are all selling points for me.  Just can't really justify the cost of one - yet."
"I was on the model 3 wait list for over 2 years, and it was so sad how they continuously emailed me, saying “did you k ow Model S is our best car? Change your order now!” And the S STILL hasn’t been refreshed.

If you sell one car for twice the price of another, you shouldn’t have to explicitly say the expensive one is better. It should just be clear."
"It needs more than a facelift, they need a complete redesign at this point."
"I like the design of the S better than the 3, specifically in the front bumper. Some days I think the 3’s front looks okay, other days I think it’s the absolute worst. Oddly enough, the model Y looks just fine with it because of the higher profile, but I just can’t get past it on the model 3."
Two words: sun roof
"that was true when long range did cost $96k. Model 3 LR is $47k, so the difference is $22k for much bigger car. That’s like saying there is no point in BMW 5, since there is a BMW 3"
"They're also chasing a particular sales target for the year.   Keeping the price high but selling fewer units could result in a billion stories about Tesla failing to meet targets, Elon ""lying"" about how many cars they could sell, etc."
It's likely pre-planned anyways to clear out inventory and the lucid price announcement was just a good time to announce the cut. The 69420 is all Elon though lol
"To be seen whether it’s less profit.  Certainly less per vehicle, but a volume increase partly offsets that by reducing fixed costs / vehicle in addition to increasing revenue."
"Yeah, but they rode the coattails of one of the darling news companies and got a million dollars of advertising (advertising isn't cheap).

This is Tesla's advertising budget."
Car is cheaper to make now.
This is what the legacy automakers can’t comprehend or match - Elon is looking at a much much bigger picture while they’re penny-pinching on cupholders. Completely different goals and strategies at play.
leveraging tesla for meme stocks
Don't know why they reduced price now if lucid is not coming any time soon. Why not wait for price reduction?
They'll be fine. Sometimes people just want different even if it is inferior.
If they’re threatened by anything it’s the plaid model S. OP was citing 2022 because Tesla will be way beyond that range/price ratio by then.
"not sure if Tesla feels threatened. 

probably more of an opportunity to fulfill a meme and still be able to profit/push towards 500k deliveries this year (or maybe just production)"
">If they’re threatened by anything it’s the plaid model S. OP was citing 2022 because Tesla will be way beyond that range/price ratio by then.

I think they're just piggybacking off the PR that Lucid are getting."
The Lucid is extremely beautiful IMHO and the interior is absolutely fantastic.  I hope the S refresh has some good things in store for the interior or they will lose customers based on that alone.  Lucid should not be ignored.
"Threatened is a strong word.   Elon seems to just want to keep the Model S as the best BEV in the world.   Plaid to compete against the Porsche, and now the price drop to compete against this Lucid.  

Doesn't matter if they aren't really purchasable by most (or any), still have to be the best.

When you're fucking rich and amazingly brilliant, you can have your cake and eat it too."
They're just clearing out the old model s design but this was a funny excuse
Lucid is just another nkla
"69,420. This guy is making memes into reality."
"So much for the “real competition is ICE cars, not other EVs”. Nice price drop though!"

"You don't understand why something you bought two weeks ago lost $5,500 in value? I would be upset if this happened with any car, not just Tesla. If the exact same Volvo I bought was $5,500 cheaper two weeks later, then yes, I expect some good-will gesture."
"Sorry to sound harsh but you're an idiot; your example is not apples to apples. ICE cars don't drop $5k+ in price in a matter of days. Buying a $75k car and then having it sell for $69k 14 days later stings no matter how you slice it. But at the same time, you don't buy a Tesla without knowing this is a very real possibility."
"When you and the guy who got the car for 5 grand less attempt to sell your cars 3 years from now, they will be valued the same and you will have lost more in depreciation because he got it cheaper and is willing to sell for cheaper."

"Bro, they've been having quality issues for a while. I doubt they have it figured out."
"> Body panels misaligned, paint chipped on

Quality is certainly the other concern.  For that kind of money I can buy a pretty nice plug-in hybrid BMW or Lexus that will be running off of batteries for 90% of my driving, have higher quality and not look like someone taking the ""shapeless jellybean"" design trend of the 90's to a comical extreme.

I love the idea of things carrying some of their maker's character within them, but this childish ""nerd culture"" stuff that Tesla constantly keeps adding makes me think that they are more interested in ""wink-and-nod"" references to Spaceballs or whatever instead of making a better car.  

This furthering my (unfair) impression that these are cars targeted at tech bros that are immature and have more money than sense."

Ironic in a thread about a price drop.
The only way it could be remotely possible is if the 2nd row is on sliders and can move forward to allow for greater room in the back.
I don’t even fit in the third row of the Model X. It will be for kids.
"I test drove one Sunday for the first time and felt the same way. Of note, the floor in the trunk opens up to a huge amount of space, so maybe the seats will sit super low...?"
I don't even know how a normal size dog would fit back there. I hated the Model Y I test drove a few months ago. I was hoping for some actual improvements over my Model 3. The slightly taller seating position and awesomeness of the hatch back was offset by the terrible visibility and awful side mirrors.
"Yeah, it doesn't look possible so I went ahead and ordered a 5 seater. Unless they do rear-facing, with feet in the sub-trunk, no way an adult will fit. Still, if they are going to start deliveries in Dec, they could let people look at a prototype. It's crazy."
"Done it quite a few times in my 7 seat RAV4 4, and now that my kids are approaching adult size, I think those seats in the Y would be useless. I don't mind tight if they can fit an adult in a pinch, but I just don't see how that can happen in the Y with front facing seats. If they would, I'd get them. But since they are just going to start selling them without showing people what they are like, it's not worth the risk and I ordered a 5 seater. They know exactly what the seats are like right now if they are this close to production, and it is crappy that they won't tell people."

"The 40 kWh Model S (dropped back in 2013) was $49,990, and they only offered it in order to fulfill the promise that they would sell a base S for under $50k (it filled the same role as the Model 3 SR- in that regard).

Back then,  the S60 was around $53k... kinda funny to think that it cost about the same as a base Model Y today."
they're actually all the same exact hardware though.  The battery limits are imposed by software on the cheaper models.  I certainly don't understand it...
"Tesla's do depreciate. But right now you can go and see that 2017 s100s are only 10k cheaper than a brand new raven. The used market makes 0 fucking sense. Before 2017 (ap2+ really), the cars are sitting around half the price of a new car, which is still holding its value well when a 2014 is still 30k."
"This is the price you pay for wanting the newest tech. Same with anything else, phones, PCs, etc."
Yeah?
...or to say it more positively : how to pass over cost benefits in production to your customers to drive a sustainable Agenda instead of getting even richer. Everyone can chose their perspective.
Tesla is the leader in EVs and it won't stay that way selling $90k cars.

"The S is better than the 3, but not twice as good for twice as much. The 3 is the better value."
"It's just a bigger Model 3 with slightly worse tech and slightly higher range that doesn't handle nearly as well. The interior isn't any more premium than the Model 3 either. 

The Model S name carries a lot of value still but it won't for too long, which is why they keep lowering the price. It just can't compete with the Model 3 otherwise."
LOL general quality. It's a fantastic car don't get me wrong but it's not quite built to the same standards as other luxury cars.
"Maybe 10-15k more but not at the current markup.

My wife currently dives the 3 and she’ll need a new Tesla in 3 years(when her carpool expires and my daughter starts driving). We want to upgrade to the S but just don’t see the cost/benefit as worth it."

"It’s a decade old design. There is a reason why most automakers drop new designs every 7 years(and minor facelift every 3.5) because it gets stale. 

People want a good EV now they’d get the 3. The S which cost significantly more would be for the better styling/prestige but until it gets redesigned it just don’t cut it anymore. 

Imagine if they redesigned the S to look like the new corvettes. That’ll drive sales through the roof."
More room also
"Behind the steering wheel cluster is still the decision maker for me. I LOVE the model S/X screens. I switched with my friend who needed my X for a road trip. He had a performance 3. I do love the car, but hate the spartan dash. He loves it. I love the car, just don't like the emptiness. 

It is a preference thing though. I want a cybertruck, but really do NOT want the center only design. Wish you could option out a behind the wheel display. 

I am jealous of the sound system in the 3. It is HANDS down an upgrade of my X, even with the premium sound.  Plus they have a better heating/cooling system and a better charging tech. 

I am happy with my X though. The wifey wants a Tesla... just not a Y. She really wants my X. I will move to a cybertruck and she can get the SUV she wants."
I keep on seeing and lusting after S's I see around town with the larger wheels. Just an insanely good looking car with lusty big haunches.
"Exterior look: debatable and subjective

status: lmao

front display: actually a con in my book 

better materials: they're made of exactly the same crap

The rest you nailed 3/8"
"I think most would agree S looks better than 3... just not $35,000 better."
"If you can afford a car of that price, would a few grand make that big of a difference though?"
"Probably worth it rather than go $69,995 like every other car manufacturer."
"Good point.  I figured the people who like that meme and have 69k to blow probly already own an S, but i could be wrong."
Stonks
"Because 69,420 nice."
I’m all for the price reductions! Bring it on Elon!
Clearing out stock of Model S before refresh in Q1 (that's the rumour).
It is a busted growth story
"It has its freshness going for it. On top of that, the interior looks a damn sight better than the Model S. If they carry that over to the production model it'll be a very appealing car who want a better luxury experience than Tesla will provide.

Love Tesla, but there are worlds between a Model S and, well, and S. If Lucid approaches the latter, it'll be a great car."
"I guess I was being too harsh, you are correct. Lucid will be fine because it think it’ll take a lot of buyers away from RR, Bentley and Mercedes than anything else. Tesla will sell all its Model Ss and the EV market will grow by however many units Lucid can produce."
Then why lower the price now with no competition?
Max out the S production line? Could be.
"To each their own, I s'pose. I do not like the aesthetic of the Lucid *at all*. That being said, it's very existence appears to have inspired a price drop from Elon. Competition, baby!

I hope Lucid sells a ton of cars so Elon has to find ways to drop prices even further. I love my Model 3, but I'm not married to the idea of a Tesla. When I'm ready for a new car (years from now, as I'm very happy currently), I want to have options and the more Lucids that pop up, the better."
Don’t let you memes be dreams.
The great meme war of 2016 changed history.
"Ah, just got the joke..."
"I spent years investing in Tesla as it sat and did nothing and some months dropped dramatically as everyone said Elon would fail, and I had to watch everyone post pics of their new model 3s with their $20k-$50k in cash I was instead investing. My patience paid off extraordinarily. If you feel cringe, instead of a thought of congratulations to an early Tesla investor, maybe it is because you wish you had the patience to do the same, but lost your chance. Either way, that's your problem."
"Stay around, plenty more to see"
hes elon's simp
I'm definitely the outlier but that is essentially what I am doing. I just sold my used 2016 S in late August and was planning on making a decision between a new S or the Air. Right now I am wfh and will be for a while so we are getting by with one car. Over the last few days I've been leaning to the Air but Tesla is making a strong counter argument now. Just wish they had nicer interior materials or upgrade options.
We are looking at buying an XC90 and this is close enough to that price before incentives. We were loaned a Model S for a long weekend years ago and loved it so I could see us taking a look now.
"Expect Elon just said so in his tweet. Elon got challenged on price finally, so they lowered price while it's still news in the media. Free advertising."
Probably Musk wanted to drop price by $6K but thought wouldn't be good for current owners.  So dropped a bit to let things sink in and then knew could go rest of way when Lucid made their announcement.
"Probably PR/marketing tactic. Getting more people to notice how much more affordable the S has become, and perhaps to help them move current models ahead of the rumored “refresh” that is or isn’t coming."
This is the way
"Ah, that's good to know, I'm in Canada so wasn't sure about the US incentives. I figured the cutoff was the price of the car so I was wondering how Lucid got it, but it must be something else, overall revenue of the manufacturer?"
"I didn't back when I got Fallout 4. Bought it at about 11 at night. 12:01 75% off with all the DLC thrown in. Happens to everybody with everything. Even things that should have no way to improve or get cheaper. Happened with my toilet paper. Don't sweat it, just stop caring. Accept you paid that much and somebody else paid less. The thing is, this specific thing is not theirs, THIS SPECIFIC THING IS YOURS!"
This is the stupidest shit ever. Who cares I am down 90% as Long as I dont sell?
"Did you already pick it up? If not, you can refuse delivery and then have someone else in your family order it (because I believe they prevent you from ordering for a year)"
"If you used a credit card, some of the good credit cards offer purchase protection that would cover this"
"Agreed but on the other hand, plenty of people buy expensive cars that shouldn't."
Used from 3rd party. But would they price adjust the used ones from Tesla?
"I'm 18 suprisingly. 


And no, we really don't eat stuff like this up. Look at the post on r/memes to see what I mean. 


It's mostly the 14 and younger and 30 and older that find this quality humour"
Yep.  Typo lol
Maybe they will give you credit instead.  Seems like a good enough reason to give out FSD to inflate the value.
">I expect some good-will gesture

Assume car price went up by $5,500 two weeks after you purchased it, would you pay the company $5,500 more for good-will gesture?"
"I mean if you agreed to purchase a car for 10,000, you saw the value in it and traded your money for the car. If that dealer then starts selling them for 9,000, that's great for everyone else, and sucks for you, but at the end of the day, you agreed to the terms of the trade. The company owes you nothing."
So where should we put the limit? At 2 weeks? 3 weeks? 4 weeks? 2 months? How much time is acceptable in order for you to not feel screwed?
"Why two weeks? What about people who bought cars 3 weeks ago? What about people who bought the car 4 weeks ago? Etc etc etc.

It's not just you who is affected. Folks who got a car a year ago are affected too, but the saltiest folks are new owners. Just enjoy your new car, and be happy that Tesla is able to make their cars more affordable."
"I've owned nearly 40 cars at this point in my life. What would you say the odds are that 1) I might know of what I speak, and 2) might not be an idiot?"
"I have a few friends that work with selling cars and yes an ICE car can definitely change 5k from customer to customer. I have even heard of higher changes.

Some people pay the full price and others negotiate 5k off. At tesla everyone gets the 5k"
"ya, i recently bought a RX 5700 XT not realizing the AMD announcements where so close. i just curse and accepted my loss though."
Private parties think they're worth more than new models still...
*Nice.*
"Drive up demand, clear out stock for the Q1 refresh (rumors), hit their 2020 goal. It makes sense. Lucid is definitely not the reason."
"One of my friends listed his 2018' and got 39k for it and it sold the following day.  He should have asked a bit more,  but didn't care to negotiate."
Yes
"Well,  obviously the 69 and 420 have their own meaning, That's the foundation of the joke.  Just figured that part was too obvious to bring up.  If the joke is something else entirely,  then it's over my head"
"A couple of weeks later it became 250:

[https://electrek.co/2020/07/12/tesla-updates-model-s-x-supercharging-rate-250-kw/](https://electrek.co/2020/07/12/tesla-updates-model-s-x-supercharging-rate-250-kw/)"
225 kw is pretty fast though.
"Wasnt trying to debunk it silly. It was me making fun of him of being a manchild being cranky and complain about such things xD seems like youre one of those >.> sry elon haters just cringe me, feel like they religious orsum like they so soft and feel the need to show how bad they think elon is.

">Nobody has come close to showing that it is possible to achieve a post-human state. 

Sounds like something a post-human society would want to hide their existence."
[deleted]
Does Steve from Minecraft know he's living in a simulation?
"Yeah you're changing the argument. The argument isn't that ""post human state"" is possible, it is that SIMULATIONS BECOME INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM REALITY and really cheap to run.

What do we have now: 

1) Lots of simulations (video games)

2) They're cheap to run (getting cheaper) 

3) They're not 1:1 scale models of atoms and nuclei (not even close) 

4) They're getting better

5) Nobody would mistake them for base reality.

If you extrapolate #4 eventually it erases #5 and you don't need the computing power to do #3, which is where ""post human reality"" comes in."

Engage!
LONESTAR
That will be the first time I hear of Tesla doing that.  Tesla has rarely done that in the past when they change prices.
"Maybe you’re right. His comments had something to do with a carbon power train for the model s plaid and an s/x refresh Q1, right?"
[deleted]
I meant right now they're making more expensive ones.
"They don't even make the less expensive Model S's anymore, so..."
"This is how my 7 seat RAV4 works, but with how the Y roof swoops down, I don't see how even that would help."
"Small adults can fit in the third row of the X, but yeah, no way an adult, or a big child fits in the third row of the Y unless it’s rear facing, but bigteslaguy said it would forward facing"
"Yep. 3rd row is for our teenager and booster seated youngen... I rode one time back there for 30 min... I'm 6'4"".... never again."
"This is only near the rear of the trunk. There is a sub-trunk where the rear seats would be, but it’s only a few inches deep."
This was denied by the leaked and said it is front facing. The same guy who said 3rd row produced November.
Nope
"Yes.    
Makes you wonder how much resale those original models lost"
The P100D with FSD used to be 150k.
"They're not holding their value though, they're only ""holding their value"" when compared to the current new price, not the price that was paid for them, which is the definition of depreciation.

People are definitely asking for too much for their old S's on the used market. I doubt very many are selling at those asking prices considering the S is not hard to find, at all."
"Yeah, but that doesn't typically happen with cars. You don't see the top 5 Series dropping 30k in price from generation to generation.

The Model S was touted for having small depreciation for its luxury sector, but that is being undercut by price adjustments.

It looks like Model S will settle in this price range. It's now competitively priced with ICE such as 5 Series and E class. Model 3 and Y I would expect to go down a bit more."
But people said a Tesla holds its value and will appreciate even with FSD
Lmao cut that shit out. It's not a phone or a fucking PC it's a car. The cuckery is strong
"I’m going to be “that guy” and say this move isn’t done out of altruism. Model 3 and Y have cannibalized some demand for the S/X and they’re having to drop the price and take a hit on margins to sell cars. As long as their margins are healthy at these reduced prices, it’s ends up being good for customers and the business."
"But it’s not accomplishing that, is it? The car is cheaper and it’s selling worse. If Tesla had kept the price up and reinvested it into updating the car people would still be buying them."
"I’m sure all those investors are just clambering for Tesla to have lower profit margins.

Tesla thinks they cant be efficient at this current price/volume, or they are trying to push market share. because there’s not enough demand at current prices."
"Economics 102: game theory.

Tesla is trying to protect market share with this move, so they are engaging in price competition because other automakers have signaled non-cooperation, and will price competitively reducing Tesla’s revenue at that price point."
It's much easier to make this connection when you're showing a classmate on your calculator with 7-segment digits.
"Yeah, I am outta here"
He means is the performance pricing dropping also. Good question
"I agree, but I listed reasons as to why some people would prefer the S. I would prefer the 3 for the value as well, but I can see why people would still consider the S"
"Isn't the S a somewhat outdated platform?  I assumed that was the facelift he was talking about.  A luxury/premium sedan will never have better value than the model 3, you rarely see value go up as the price does and especially not in the $70k+ range."
"I have a 3, and I had a P90 loaner from the service center. Hated it."
"I agree. There are quite a few people who don't need to think about value too much, they just buy the car they like because they can."
What if it was a performance 3 vs a LR S
"while the base price is about 2x, that is the M3 with 250 range? and the S would have 400+? in addition to the better interior, you'd likely need to at minimum compare the long range version which isnt quite 2x anymore. Then add in all the other things you get for the cost of stepping into the S"
"Very true, but it's common to pay 2x to get less than 2x, especially for a product at the top of a lineup."
">The 3 is the better value.

This. People always strive for better value. The S is for truly loaded with $ people. The 3 is approaching the regular person who wants that new car tech and actually afford it. I am excited to see what will be the case in 5 years, exciting times!"
"I mean, isn't the appropriate comparison the LR dual motor Model 3?  Then you're comparing a 50k car to a 70k car - not exactly double any more."
I did not enjoy going from a 3 to an S.  Visibility in the S is horrible.  Hate the second screen obstruction
"I hear people keep saying the S/X has worse tech than 3, but I don’t see it.  The only thing better on the 3 is the air vent controls, it is a tighter car less flex and roll, headlights could be brighter, but what else?  The MCU is up to par, AP HW should be the same, homelink not standard in the 3."
The S is a much nicer interior.  Bought the Y recently and seriously considered the X for interior finish.  In the end just couldn’t justify the price jump.
"Not true on interior. I have the first 2012 s with Alcantara and it is way more luxurious than my 3.  They newd to bring back the performance interior upgrade.

I don't care about the s screen behind the wheel but the rest is the same tech wise now"
"I guess the range and HP still cary.
Who buys a Standard S?"
"RemindMe! 3 years

""By then the Model S will be the same price or cheaper, it'll have a face-lift and a major interior upgrade (including standardizing to the horizontal center screen)"""
"Interior definitely, my 3 is in the service center so I have a 2015 S loaner right now and the MCU  in it and the autopilot just seem really inferior. Heater steering wheel is a nice touch though!"
Honestly I think the only reason they don't care is because they can't keep up with demand as it is. Not enough batteries to supply a brand new S/X line and the demand that would come with it. Plus they have Cybertruck next year.
"I am excited to see what Tesla could do with the Model S given the huge amount of knowledge they have gotten over the last few years. A completely re-designed Model S would be simpler to make, lighter and an all round better car. I can't wait to see it!"
"If I owned an S and really same goes for the 3 I wouldn’t be a huge fan of the facelift because I’d feel like my car was outdated because there is obviously a new design out there. Whereas if the design doesn’t change your car is still perceived as ‘current’ but I do tend to overthink things..

I also weirdly like that Apple doesn’t change the iPhone design every year so that my phone feels current for longer, maybe I’m just weird lol"
"I dunno. Beautiful design is timeless. The 911 barely changes, but people still love it."
"Well, there is a difference between a 75K$ car, and an under 70K$ car....it just sounds different, and it helps with making more customers buy and get the more expensive ones."
We’re talking about it so clearly this PR stunt worked lol
"Nice

^I'm ^a ^bot. ^Join ^my ^community ^at ^r/nicebot2."
"This also some people might be waiting for the Lucid Air car, many of them will change their mind with this price drop."
Makes sense. Thank you.
"It's so rare all those things from the concept carries over ti production, sadly."
Cost savings or to stimulate demand because nobody wants to buy the old tech before the new Plaid model (and presumably updates to other models) comes out.
They compete with every ICE manufacturer. That is the competition.
"From what I understand they have a lot of production capacity for X and S, and they are dropping the price to move more of those cars so they can more comfortably cross 500K cars for this year."
For the lutz. No reason why the price won't go back up tomorrow.
Agreed!
[deleted]
Yeah just wait a couple years when the Model 3 hits the used market so hard. This forum will be filled with all sorts of cringe. Enjoy it now while it lasts.
But you haven’t even see the true interior of the air to compare it to right?
[deleted]
"Are you buying it in anticipation of going back to in-office working?

I’m in a similar situation (albeit smaller budget) and figured I’d use the opportunity to start owning random cars that wouldn’t be practical to commute in (due to age, reliability, or safety), but I thought might be a novelty to drive for a few months. 

Once it’s back to needing a practical safe commuter a Tesla would be perfect, but in the meantime I feel like I just want to buy a Miata, maybe a random classic British sports car or some other nonsensical crap that would quickly lose it’s charm if I had to commute in it. 

I may be wrong but I just get the feeling that WFH is still going to be a thing for at least the next year and a half here in North America with how badly the pandemic is being handled."
You don't even know how the Air will be inside when it finally comes out.
"We’ve had a Model S for 7 years and were looking at the XC90 when it came out as our second car. Neither of us were big fans. We almost got a second S, but held off for a few years. Just welcomed a Model Y instead. Pretty happy with the decision so far."
This is the way
"Yes, picked up on 9/30"
Would you really buy a $70k car on a CC? Does it still cover you for eg $5k depreciation if you pay only $1k deposit on it?
"Oh probably not lol, this is on new cars"
[deleted]
And probably a lot of programmers / tech geeks.
"Looks like I don't get anything. They told me that I can vent to the Board of Directors, but nothing else I can do."
"They don't ""give out"" FSD. If you take delivery of the car and you're outside the 7-day return policy, you're SOL."
"If you bought an iPhone from Best Buy and 2 weeks later the price dropped by $200, they will actually give you money back (this happened to me). If the price went up, they don't expect you to pay them."
"They don't owe me anything, but companies in general like happy customers who don't feel cheated in order to retain their loyalty and to share their positive experience with the company."
I would still be upset that I could have saved several grand if I had just waited a bit.
I hope you are right but I wouldn't call that official.
Thank you for informing me!
But he brought up a valid point
Nobody plans to dig a pit. It’s just a pit.

Now make twin roadsters land simultaneously and we'll really be cookin!
Very true. I saw it live on cam. It was really wild.
"Agreed, for me the side by side landing was the moment I knew I'd made it to the future."
"I’m still living in hope that one day we’ll have the core booster, AND the two side boosters do an RTLS landing back at the launch site. The core will come back later than the sides, but it will still be a wondrous sight to behold.
Edit: wonderous."
"No, that would be the tri-wolf shirt."
"It's pretty cool, but I'm not sure if it is 'the most' mind blowing technological feat ever."
"YUP :( Actually soured me on the whole BTC thing. I realized while things were still ""processing"" but there's no mechanism to stop it at that point. Downside to me - personal responsibility for fraud is tough to swallow"
"The literal written premise is that either post-humanity is impossible, or we are living in a simulation (or the third option which I won't go into because it doesn't affect this discussion really).

Therefore the only thing the matters when trying to figure out how likely it is we are in a simulation is figuring it how likely it is that post-humanity is possible under there laws of our universe. 

Post humanity is basically defined in the argument as ""then magic happens"", because it's entirely made up BS with no real scientific justification. Nobody knows if it can happen, or even what it would look like, it's just this completely made up thing. So yeah, until we have reason to believe that is even vaguely possible, I really don't see how the simulation side even begins to hold up.

I admit my number is a bit arbitrary, but arguably it should be much worse odds, so I don't feel bad.

To put it another way, based on what we know today there is  only about a 0.000001% chance (or a similarly low number) that this post-human thing is possible, and so that is how much we should believe in post-humanity. And by the simulation argument itself, if we therefore 99.99999% believe post-humanity isn't possible we must 99.99999% believe we are not in a simulation, because that is literally what the argument says."
Nice
I think they've always done it if you haven't taken delivery yet. The surprise is that he's taken delivery already.
"yes.

He/she said it was weird that Plaid timeline does not coincide with refresh scheduled for Q1. Also that Plaid versions he saw were all 100kwh.

I shared carbon powertrain on TMC and got ridiculed.. we will see what the new powertrain is"
"They said a new Model 3 steering wheel with metal roller wheels would be coming soon, and a heated steering wheel would coming around December, along with some other things, but I forgot the rest lol"
He also said USB port in glovebox.
"mostly things that we know already now, metal rollers on the steering wheel, and heated steering wheel scheduled for December this year, but not greenlit yet, and 3/Y being the first ones to get 4680 battery whenever they start making their way into those 2 cars."
"K, but you didn't answer the question.

Question: When will we get the RWD Model Y?

Your answer: They're not selling the RWD Model Y now.

Yes, we know, that's why we're asking when we'll get it."
I mean maybe the new rear casting somehow scoops a bit more room somehow
"I know. But it seems physically impossible to have them front facing, so it will be interesting to see."
How many hardware upgrades did they miss?
"the older the car the less significant this is, as most of the depreciation is in the first two years anyway"
I don't think the owners of those are worried about that
I’m planning on selling my 90d 2017 model soon and I really don’t want to know 🤦🏽‍♂️
"I got $32,500 in trade on my 2015 Model S 85D (that originally MSRP'd in the $90k's) when I upgraded to a Y last month.  So a lot."
You can go look pretty easily.
Yeah.
"Just sold my 2016 Model S for more than I paid when I bought it off lease (I held the original lease as well) a year and a half ago. I was shocked at the way it held its value, I added 45k and drove it a year and a half and still made a profit..."
"Agree it doesn't typically happen with cars. It also says a lot about the rate of innovation of traditional car companies. Just slap a new shaped bumper on a 2018 car and call it the 2019 version. Any tech that constantly innovates rapidly will have this problem. 

It's a good problem to have though. Tesla remains true to their vision of accelerating the adoption of EVs as with every price drop more and more people can afford these cars. 

I do sympathise with early adopters though because I was one of them - bought a M3 LR AWD at 49k list price and it dropper to 46k right about when I wanted to sell mine"
The 5 Series would have dropped $30k if BMW had introduced a superior in several ways 3 Series that was $50k cheaper.
"Fair point, but Tesla's are not your typical car. 

They're also probably more technology than car."
"The cost of technology decreases as it gets easier to produce, that doesn't mean the vehicles won't hold their value. But I'm not an expert, so"
"Hard to judge in these challenging times. A world wide pandemic in conjunction with economic crisis doesn’t really help selling luxuries cars, more a switch to affordable / more rational EVs like the Model 3. let’s see whether the price drop to below 70k will set a stimulus."
That’s a good assessment. The world could use healthy competition in this field.
I like the S but wish it felt as nimble as the 3 on the cornering.
"I have an S and did an overnight test drive on a 3. Hated it. 

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
"Even for equivalent price (used S vs new 3), there are reasons why some ppl prefer S over 3, not just because they have the money to burn. More room, hatchback, screen behind wheel, air ride suspension etc. I'm personally debating over used S or new Y and wouldn't consider a 3. Have a young, growing family, and the 3 wouldn't be the best fit for us. It's a great fit for others though."
"Phone key, faster charging on the 3."
"If you frequently road trip (I have), the extra range on the standard S would be very nice.   I also really like having two screens in the Model S.  That is the hardest thing for me to let go of in regards to replacing my S with a Y.   Styling, I think the Model S is the best looking Tesla."
"Heated steering wheel and self presenting doors from the X is the only two features I think the S/X have an advantage on.

Otherwise it's no contest with 3/Y. Turns out tech advances quickly."
I think the model 2 takes priority. I could even see the S production being put on hold for a while. It has served its purpose. Not it’s time to do what VW does and build larger numbers.
But this is Elon. He does a PR claim stunt and then it comes true.
"Agreed. But Teslas are almost intentionally spartan, skirting the line on what's acceptable for the price class: when I look at the accoutrement one finds in even mid-level cars from Germany, the fit-and-finish details are simply way beyond Tesla: better seats, more luxurious appointments, nicer materials, and wider option packages that include much better headlights and even night vision and other tech.


I understand why Tesla is prioritizing differently and why they are making those decisions, but when a manufacturer comes along that understands and leans into that game, it will be a very appealing option for many."
"A commentator below explained that he had waited explicitly because of the Lucid Air on the horizon. Demand has to be low due to competition on the horizon (and Plaid), price reduction makes no sense otherwise."
Models S and X have had their sales drop for some time even before the announcement of Plaid.
Good explanation but why did he say the gauntlet was thrown down then? Who do you think he was referring to?
"Everyone thinks Tesla has no competition, but they absolutely have to convince ICE buyers to switch to EV, and competitive price is like #1. Maybe #2 behind range anxiety, but I hear less about that these days."
It wasn't that bad until I saw their username.
Personally I was looking at the $87.5k version and you can see the interior online. My big question is the option pricing which they aren't showing yet. The version I have looked at had much superior interior materials and feels more like a luxury car. At this point my waiting had paid off though either way I go.
I mean I get that but I think the $87.5k version will be out towards the end of '21. Trust me I would love to just get the S as I really loved my previous one but it's starting to lack as a luxury sedan. The underlying tech is fantastic though which is why it's a contender at all. As you can tell I'm very on the fence still but my waiting has saved me at least $6k so far.
"One of the big draws of the Air would be not having to deal with Tesla Service anymore. So awful now. 

I suspect Lucid service will be as good as Tesla’s was in the early days. But of course that’s a gamble."
Yeah my company is definitely going neck in the office at some point. We are building a brand new multi million dollar building so it will happen for me. I like your idea too though. I looked into leases for 911 and stuff like that I couldn't normally get bc of the milage limitation but ultimately decided against it.
You can go look yourself online. I've no don't it could change some but the are very close to production on the dream edition and don't see it changing significantly.
This is the way

"I recently bought a car and the procedure I used was to put it on my credit card, then immediately pay off the credit card. For the purpose of racking up those sweet points. But you are right, it definitely was not a $70k car"
Yeah probably.

Do you live in a place with a cooling off period on the purchase? Threat of returning might be enough incentive.
"The difference is Best Buy is a reseller. They didn’t manufacture your iPhone. They can offer you 14 day price guarantee on phones because they have policies in place with the manufacturer (Apple). So they can offer you a 14 day return policy on iPhone which translates into a 14 day price guarantee. https://www.bestbuy.com/site/help-topics/return-exchange-policy/pcmcat260800050014.c?id=pcmcat260800050014&CMP=ocss

Go look at Apple. Their own return policy is 14 days so their price guarantee on iPhone is 14 days https://www.apple.com/shop/help/returns_refund. If you bought an iPhone, 15 days ago - too bad. 

Tesla: 7 day return policy. So their price guarantee is 7 days. https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-return-policy

Manufacturer price guarantees have nothing to do with “good will”. It’s explicitly a function of their return policy and wanting to avoid returns solely for purpose of getting the new price."

"Why is post-*human* even necessary? The simulation only has to be of a mind. Not necessarily a 1:1 digital / post-human entity. Just a mind that thinks it's human. A sort of ""inverted"" Turing test if you will.

E.g. ""I think that I think, therefore I am.""

While I agree we haven't necessarily proven even *that* is possible yet, that's a significantly lower bar than what you seem to be proposing."

"I think the point is the 2020 model is almost 30k cheaper. Or -30%      
So the 2018 model probably needs to be -50% or more for me to consider if instead of a new 2020."
I'm surprised this comment is getting upvoted. 30% drop in the new price is going to have a significant effect on depreciation over and above what you're saying.
Can confirm. ☹️
But what about all the depreciation you paid over the course of the lease?
Umm what improvements were there to the Tesla Model S long range in those 2 years? Didn't they slap a new front bumper on it and call it a day lmao
"I don't see how the Model 3 is significantly superior to the S. You get more range, performance, room, and comfort from S than Model 3.

Are you talking about the 3 getting newer battery tech or the minimalist interior?"
"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the continued sales decline of a car approaching 9 years old and has been on the downturn since the introduction of the Model 3, hasn’t got much to do with the current economic climate."
Well the world certainly has. Tesla is behind in EV market share in most of the world besides the US. But absolutely the more makers the better bargaining power consumers have. Unfortunately new entrants know this so it’s a bit of a equilibrium.
Yep. Definitely glad we have options. We all look for different things in vehicles.
Do you mind me asking why? Hate seems a bit strong
I don’t ever want to go back from phone key. It’s crazy they are still building new Teslas that lack this years-old feature.
That’s the problem when you essentially build a PC on wheels.
"Sure, personally I prefer the more spartan look. But the lucid does look very good. I hope it carries over to production! Not that I'm gonna buy it, but someone is and then they will be happy, and not in an ICE."
"Right. Spartan and good quality are not mutually exclusive. And for most parts, when comparing 100k of Tesla to 100k of BMW, MB or Audi, Tesla’s point of reference is Lada-style of spartan."
That commenter also thinks they were going to work from home until 2022 so they sold their car and are waiting for the lucid to come out. I’d argue that’s not a scenario most people follow when buying a car.
"Yeah because they’re older and Tesla can produce enough for the entire market to have one. That’s the demand curve cars generally follow. Model 3/Y has been going up because they’re supply limited on what they can produce - so sales get higher every quarter, but for normal car companies they typically pop up at the start and never get to that level again. S/X demand will move more like this in the future because Tesla can easily satisfy total demand."

"Becausethrowing down the gauntlet means to challenge someone. He had been waiting for a competitor for a decade. Now he takes up the challenge and shows they still aren't cutting it.

"I read that as Elon saying he’s throwing his power down to change the price to a meme, even though it doesn’t make business sense"

"When I see these numbers I always wonder what is happening with those folks. The cars are great for sure, but the service is awful. And they need tons of service.

"The post-humans are the future-human REAL beings who have so much power that they can trivially build millions of computers capable of simulating every person who is alive today and the world and universe around us (to the degree needed for the simulation). 

The simulation isn't of them, it is of us, the pre-post-humans."
"The word posthuman appears 47 times ""Are you living in a computer simulation?"" by Nick Bostrom, so I am not sure how it can't be a part of the theory.

Also, you are entirely wrong about this statement: ""our civilizations exponentially advancing technological growth curve"". Our use of technology is growing pretty rapidly, but the pace of actual advancement in physical technology has actually slowed a bit over the last 40 years. For instance, we have run into physical limitations such that we haven't really been able to make computer processors run at higher clock speeds for years now. Tiny increases have been achieved, but there is a technical limit with transistors that we can't overcome. There may be a better way, people may have come up with it, and someday we may have a solution, but this serves to demonstrate my core point, which is that every technology has its limits. EVERY SINGLE ONE, and this is not arguable, this is a simple fact.

I will say again, according to Nick the entire premise behind posthumans is that it is a certainty that technology CAN advance to the point where it is completely and utterly 100% trivial, like building a laptop is today, to build a computer that can simulate the world to a certain reasonable degree. Not 1 such computer, or the work of a thousand years and billions of people but TRIVIAL. Without it the theory falls apart anyway. 

I am merely arguing that the idea that this stage can be achieved is a certainty if false. This is not a certainty in the slightest, and since it must be a certainty for the simulation argument to be a certainty, then the degree to which it is currently uncertain is the degree of uncertainty we must have in the idea that we are in a simulation. This is literally written directly into the theory as ""the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage"". If a posthuman stage is impossible then not only are we very likely, but by definition we must go extinct first. 

Nick argues that since people have proposed that computers of certain sizes and capabilities can be built in theory, it is merely a matter of time until they are built (assuming humanity lasts long enough, but if not us, then aliens a/o ""the original us if we are simulations""), but lots of things can be done in theory that we can't do in reality, and which may never be possible in reality.... Someone figured out how to make wormholes, but there may be no physical mechanism by which anyone could ever control enough power in the right manner to actually create one, let alone a directed one of a size you could travel through. Someone figured out how a warpdrive could work in theory, but there may be no physical means by which any being could actually build the necessary drive a/o generate sufficient mobile power to run it. 

Admittedly we are closer to the simulation of a single being's consciousness by far than these other examples, but that still doesn't mean that the necessary power, speed, communications interfaces, etc. to simulate 7 billion such minds, and the world and universe around them (which must still be simulated to some degree, even when unobserved), are actually possible under the laws of physics. If you could build a computer the size of a sugar cube that simulated a single being, could you still build the 7-billion plus of them, interconnect them, connect the billion more needed to run the rest of the simulation, and have it all running at a reasonable speed? How much power do you need to provide, how do you get it there, how much heat does this put off, how do you deal with that? 

And if you can do all this, can you build it all TRIVIALLY, and in massive numbers that would likely take the resources of thousands or millions of star systems (depending on the size of the final computers)? 

I am merely arguing that we have no clear evidence that this stage is possible within the laws of physics. Indeed that based on what we know today it seems extremely unlikely it is, as a lot of other things have to be possible to support it that we also don't know are possible (such as reasonable interstellar travel and communications, or beings that live so long that doing things over tens of thousands of years is trivial to them) and as such the idea we are in a simulation, being based on the premise this is possible, is correspondingly as low as the inverse of the likelihood this is possible."
Nice.

This is true because you can get a >3 year old S or X for around 50-60k
"Well the depreciation was a known factor that I agreed to when I leased the vehicle. I also assumed the resale of the vehicle would be roughly around the buy back price at the end of the lease, just like it had been with every other vehicle I had ever leased. I was shocked when I was near the end of my lease and could see similar vehicles selling for 20k more than my buyback. Had I handed it back I also would have owed 3K in mileage overage so buying it was a no-brainer. I have leased many vehicles, but never had any of then hold value even close to what my Model S did.."
"Uhmmm... The very fact that they are able to sell a car at 30k less keeping the same gross profit margin around 20%? 
People tend to forget that making something cheap while maintaining quality (and improved performance in this case) is harder than making a 1million $ super car. 

Also performance has gone up - better suspension, more range (402 miles instead of 335 miles 2 years ago) better 0-60 performance, HW3,  etc etc."
"Redesigned adaptive suspension? That's not exactly trivial. There's the other smaller stuff like MCU2, the Raven motor, faster Supercharging."
"Model 3 at intro had faster charging (miles / minute), better handling, more agility, landscape screen, higher end processors, better efficiency...

I said superior in several ways, not in all ways.  I know the model S has plenty of advantages, but the market didn’t think it had enough to justify its disadvantages, plus the much higher price."
The price difference was just too big. I think a few more people will now look at the S again. It has gotten really affordable.
"The trunk was the biggest part. The hatch on the S (and X/Y) are an absolutely massive improvement. Really rough ride. Single center screen is a big step down: it’s nice to have turn-by-turn navigation in the cluster and a North-Up map in the center console. There’s a bunch little stuff too, but those are the big ones. 

Maybe hate is a little strong (I just mirrored the poster above me), but I don’t even think I’d trade my nearly 8 year old S for a brand new 3. It’s just not even close to being the car for me."
"Yep. It really makes the car feel more futuristic not having to carry an extra keyfob. 

I can't wait for the day that the State lets you have a digital ID. With that and mobile payments, all you really need is your phone during normal daily life."
"Exactly. Spartan can be gorgeous. But Tesla interiors are inferior to just about all luxury cars. The cost comes from the battery, drivetrain and tech."
"Elon:sorry guys, switching to silicon, nice video though"
Really it is exactly the same situation as the 3 or even the S when it first came out. It's the production version not a concept and it's what they are promising when you make a reservation just like when I reserved a 3. I get it you are a fan of Tesla and you should be I loved that car and had it 4 years with minimal problems. But lucid is taking reservations just like Tesla did and put out a production example. They have had a launch and are showing the final version of the car. If it was mostly different then no one is going to take delivery. They are in this as a business to make money. Feel free to go watch the launch event and point out where it says things are pending or there will be design changes or differences.
Wrong way

Nice.
Could be referring to SiC MOSFETs which are currently used in the Model 3/Y inverter. Also known as Silicon Carbide MOSFETs. Current gen Model S/X are using IGBTs. The SiC FETs are more efficient although their part cost is a little higher (relatively new technology)
It does suck to be the guy who purchased a Model S just 2 years ago though.
"It definitely seems to have worked out for you, but you can't ignore the fact that you already paid a bunch of depreciation during the lease. That's mostly what a lease is.

Tesla just seems to have set the residual value too low for you. Tesla was unique in that instead of reducing the capitalized cost by the $7500 federal credit, they reduced the residual value. That's what made it attractive to buy and resell the car probably. If they had done it the normal way which is reducing capitalized cost then your lease would have been cheaper but your residual buyoff price would have been higher.

What was the purchase price, residual value, and new price at the time the lease ended?"
"Also felt the same after test driving a brand new 3 a few weeks ago (coming from a 2014 S). Decided to just get a 2017 S instead. About the same price, and feels much nicer overall to me (screens, wheel, speakers, looks, etc)"
Exactly. I just returned a loaner 3 and had the exact same observations. I'm gonna be bummed if cybertruck only has the center screen. We'll probably always own an S or X at this point.

"He also finished up the tweet by saying the car would linger in ""deep space"" -- not in Mars orbit. If he wanted everyone to understand what the plan was, he could have worded it a lot better.. but he knew what he intended."
"Specifically we *don't* want it to crash into Mars if at all possible. That would contaminate the surface.

Anything we land on foreign planetary bodies we ensure is as sterile as possible. It's the only way we can know for sure when we discover organic molecules or compounds only known to exist on Earth that they're actually from the other place."

"I would agree a single person being simulated would be considerably easier. But it means that only I am simulated, and you are just something created to make my simulation more real. It also is not what Simulation theory is about, so we are now entering into an entirely difference discussion I am not interested in."
"This is exhausting. First, I am going off the paper on the simulation argument website. 

Second, I don't know why I am discussing anything with someone who thinks computing power has been growing exponentially throughout the entire history of civilization. That is such a ridiculous statement to make. 

I will take another stab at this though, then I am done. 

My issue with ""trends"" and current and historical growth as an indicator of future potential growth is that it is bullshit. You were once a single cell, you turned into two, then four, then eight, etc. You were growing exponentially. Are you now the size of our galaxy, which is roughly what continued exponential growth would indicate you would be by now? No, because there are hard limits to things. The raindrops falling outside my house were X size 10 minutes ago, 5 minutes ago they were 2X, now they are 4X. Should I assume in an hour they will be large enough to crush my home? Sorry, but nothing real grows anywhere close to forever, including, and especially, the speed of processing in a given volume of space. At some point this will hit a hard hard hard limit, and even currently we are very close to having to make a giant leap in technology to continue our current growth rate, and no scientist believes we have the answer for that at this time, though there are some theories out there.

So while past trends and current science give us a peak into the near future, they say nothing about the distant future other than that it is at or greater than what we know about the near future. 

We can theorize many things about computers, and Nick does this. Yeah!!! However, all that he does is demonstrate that THEORETICALLY you could build these devices. What he hasn't done is demonstrated that anyone could ever REALLY build them. For instance, while you could theoretically build a computer the size of the moon with modern processors that could theoretically simulate our world, what hasn't been demonstrated, or discussed at all really, is that a technology and the necessary materials can EVER be created to enable the necessary communication interfaces and throughput for such a computer to function as an actual simulator of our world. If the data is physically bound by universal laws and limits on materials to traveling at X when it needs to travel at X\^10, then you can't run the simulation, or you have to run it at 1/1,000th speed.

Then of course people respond ""Well they would just run it at 1/1000th speed"", however then a year of our time would take 1000 of their years, so it is no longer trivial to run such a simulation, it takes 1000 years, and a ridiculous amount of resources to do it. Is it really likely that any civilization would have the lifespan and interest needed to do this? Again, this is not addressed and needs to be to make your argument if you are going to do the ""slow simulation"" thing, and nobody has a compelling argument for the development of humans into a long-life species at this time. 

I could go on, but you won't get the point. The thing is that it is NOT on me to prove that this stuff can't be done. I am not even saying it can't be done. I am saying that at this time our CERTAINTY that it can be done approaches ZERO, and since the ""we are in a simulation"" portion of the theory hinges entirely on the certainty of two ideas, that simulations can be run and that they definitely would be run, it is up to the person presenting  the theory to present a truly compelling argument that they can and would be run.... 

The current argument that they could be built is ""In theory they could be build with future technology we don't have, don't really understand, and that we can't prove at this time is actually practical"", and the argument that they will be built is ""Once the computers we can't prove can be built are able to be built, a society could exist that will find building them so trivially easy that they will have the computing power to spare on building and running these simulations in somewhat large numbers.""  He then goes on to prove such a society could exist by...... doing nothing. A large part of my problem with this entire concept is what this proposed society is implied to be. The power level here is astronomically beyond anything we can demonstrate is possible. Again, I don't have to prove this, Nick has to prove it, and his follow-up discussions have completely failed to do so. He has shrunk the size of the theoretical computer, which helps as the smaller it is the smaller this society needs to be, but still it must be capable of harnessing immense amounts of power in tiny spaces, it must be capable of working on moon-scale construction projects trivially, it must be capable of interstellar travel, it must be capable of very long lives, or of maintaining long-term projects with very very low value through multiple lifetimes, etc. He just simply does not adequately address whether this civilization could ever actually exist, he just assumes it. And that is my core issue, and despite what you say about me proving things, it is his theory, he and those who believe it in it need to PROVE the likelihood of the theory, and they don't. They handwave away this entire issue and carry on like it is resolved, when it is not at all."

Appreciate the sympathy vote.
"yeah that was me, 2018 sP100D resale is less than half of purchase price now."
"I get the feeling someone who pays $96,000 for a car, isn't sweating the depreciation."
Actually less devaluation than a comparable BMW in Norway at least.
"I don't think the buyback was exceptionally low , It was just over 50% which I believe would be pretty standard for a 3 year lease. Rough numbers I bought it for 95k (CAD dollars), buyback was 50k at the end of 3 year lease. I just never expected a new vehicle I purchased for 95k to still be worth 70k at the end of three years. Now I drove it for another year-and-a-half before I sold it and that wiped out that additional 20K resale, but there is obviously value in driving a vehicle  for a year-and-a-half for free. I also received an 8K provincial rebate with the original lease, plus had significant savings in operating costs so it ended up being one of the best purchases I ever made.."
Back on track.
"If you get all cranky and triggered about Elon making a meme out of himself, it says enough hun. Get some help. Can tell your life based of depression and hate towards others"
"Yeah, to get FAA approval to do the launch they had to make sure it wouldn't crash in to Mars for at least 50 years, so..."
that's just reading too many conspiracy theories online.
"Stop listening to Qonspiracy Theories. We've been to the moon. We've landed rovers on mars. Dropped probes into Saturn, Titan, and moons of Jupiter. And yes, we (the royal we) launched a friggin' roadster with a fake mannequin astronaut, complete with a bobblehead version of the same on the dashboard, into space and around the sun.

I watched the Falcon Heavy Demo launch from Kennedy Space Center... the one where they sent a Tesla Roadster on a heliocentric earth-mars orbit, and then watched the two boosters fall from the sky and land simultaneously on the landing pads. It was a bummer that they lost the main booster at sea for that launch, but that was kinda expected.

If you can afford it, I highly recommend getting tickets to a launch and watching it live from Florida/Texas/LA... It's a sight to behold, and you will start believing in the truth again and appreciate how far humanity has come from conspiracy gossiping lunatics."
"No, its exactly what simulation theory is about. Like I said, its basically Descartes just dressed differently. Also I guess it goes 1 step further.

In this case, the dressing is that ""thinking"" can be simulated, and the additional step (which is an optional corollary BTW) is that if simulations can be done, and simulations are something an ""intelligence"" (keeping intelligence intentionally vague here, don't want anthropocentric thinking clouding our conjecture) would be interested in doing, then barring any unknown unknowns the conclusion is the likely outcome is that ""we"" (again with the intentional vagueness) are likely simulations (... of a simulation, of a simulation, of a simulation, ... etc.).

I was merely offering a counterpoint to your statement that given the complexity of simulating minds, it is unlikely that we are simulated. 

The counter being, the simulation doesn't have to be as complex as the ""original"", just complex enough to fool the mind being simulated (and if you've been around the internet, you'll *know* humans aren't *that* complex lol).


Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

TLDR,
""99.9999%"" chance of this being base reality isn't a number we can be confident in because its founded on assumptions about simulating minds that we just don't have an answer to yet (namely, how hard or easy it is to do if it was doable)."

"Sounds like Tesla does the incentives a little different in Canada, or maybe that's just how it works there with the rebate. 

But sounds like you're saying the 95K vehicle (87K after rebate) depreciated to 50K after 4.5 years. 50/87 is about 57% or a 43% depreciation. That's not bad, but it is significant. I was originally making fun of the ""Tesla's don't depreciate"" articles. What they'd be doing is comparing your 50K sale to the new price, which was probably something like 70K at that point, and saying it's just a 29% depreciation."
"This way, hurry."
I don’t think making fun of someone’s immaturity and disconnect from culture equals depression but you’re the expert
"Yes, indeed"
"I know all this. If doesn't change anything really. It can be 100 times less complex, and be running at 1/100th speed, so it is 1/10000th the computing power. It still doesn't significantly impact the likelihood that it is possible to achieve a society that can trivially build computers that can simulate this for 7 billion such entities at once."

My thoughts exactly...
"Mass market EVs are still a burgeoning technology, lots of change is happening.  Imagine buying this [auto buggy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Success_Automobile_Manufacturing_Company#/media/File:1906_Success_High_Wheeler.jpg) just two years before the Ford Model T comes out.

And then beyond that it took Ford about 20 years to put out their second successful model, the [Model A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_A_(1927%E2%80%9331))."
Why?
I'd go so far as to say the majority aren't millionaires.
"Moving so fast, everything’s blurry."
"Idk, i think you’re not happy currently. If things trigger you this easily about a cringy guy sayign a funny number, youre just a very irritated hatefull person. = and ppl thag loves to complain about bs, usually been through depressed ass moments."
"Again, we only ""need"" to simulate 1 mind. And the simulation doesn't need the same fidelity as the intelligence that produced it.

And 16 orders of magnitude easier to simulate isn't trivial in the least (1/10,000th the compute * 1/7,000,000,000 the number of minds to simulate). If we apply that to the original value you proposed from thin air, namely ""99.99999%"" or ""1x10^-6 : 1"" odds, we would get 999999999.99% chance of being simulated (or 1x10^10 : 1 odds). Thats a billion simulations for each base reality.

Whether that's a thing that's of value to a higher intelligence doing said simulations isn't the question. The question is; if its possible to simulate minds, what's the likelihood any particular mind is simulated?

Spoiler: the actual correct answer is = ""we literally CAN NOT know because we don't have enough information"". But since you wanna argue based on assumptions made on more assumptions, I obliged with the above rebuttal."
Nice
But we do know that This Is The Way.
No ones triggered man lmao
You can't simulate a society with just one mind. You just don't get it at all.
Nice
You do you hunny :p im sure youre not triggered
"The rest of the minds don't have to be actual minds. Just approximates. The free market is one such approximation. Also the democratic process.

Quantum wave functions also neatly serve as a great compression algorithm if you're simulating at that level of granularity. Quantum states being this vague probability cloud until you observe it and collapse the wave function screams ""save on compute until the Mind decides to observe it and we need to churn out actual Quantum states"". Food for thought."
Nice.
Correct
"Then we aren't living in a simulation, one of is is, and in that case you are talking about something else entirely and I am not interested in that."
Nice
"You're arbitrarily constraining parameters to suit your own preconceived notions. And here I was thinking this'll be an interesting discussion and that I might learn something new. 

Before you go hide in your self affirming echo chamber though, look up the ""one electron universe"". Its a similar concept to simulation theory but instead of living in a computer, its a wacky way of viewing how space-time works. Might be something that interests you."
nice
"I was confused earlier because you said we were talking about the same thing when we clearly are not at all. I am talking about the Nick Bostrom simulation argument which is the genesis of the simulation discussion, and specifically is about whether ""we"" are in a simulation. 

Whether a single individual is simulated is a related, but entirely different, topic. I wasn't talking about that to start with, and at this point I am merely trying to help you understand the difference, and I guess why you shouldn't bring up lone individual simulation and claim it is the same thing. Hopefully you get why they are different by now and find that understanding helpful.

The one electron universe is indeed wacky."

Elon B. Goode
i havent had a cousin marvin in a long time.
You played it on a guitar that wasn’t invented yet so how are we supposed to trust you
"To be fair, the presentation itself sucked. 

Other companies *cough* Apple *cough* would be able to take even a single one of the innovations mentioned and run away with it. Then create a video narrated by Johnny Ive saying how this is revolutionary and never seen before in humankind history and yada yada. Then they would pull a ""one more thing"" and drop something else. And say ""available <date>""

They had the right idea by showing what's the percentage improvement each of the advancements brought, but they should have held that for the end. Do a recap (because people have the attention span of planaria) and add up the numbers with a big fanfare. 

Other than that, a little more focus should be spent on translating all that to beancounterese. What does it mean for profit margins? Or are they going to be using the advancements for even more range to widen their moat? When is all this going to be available, and for which cars? 

Heck. If they announced any form of subscription service the stock would have jumped. Because all the excel pilots would be able to plug numbers that they understand - or at least, think they do."
"Two years maybe, four definitely."
What's wrong with the guitar in the background?
[Such an epic scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1i5coU-0_Q).
"Like the actual OG Tesla!

Edit: I like to think of Elon as a re-incarnated N. Tesla. This time around he's making sure he gets paid."
"This is very true, he is setting his company up for the future and all the consumers care about is the shares and money."
Exactly! I can't believe people thought it was a dud
"The thing I love is that they’re doing all these advances in the new few years, and I’m not going to be able to afford a Tesla for at least a few years and by then they’ll be even more worth it"
And then say the same 2 years later
Hahha perfect
This is true to every EM announcement. Announces his new rocket plans to the space community and I could just feel they were all thinking is this guy nuts? Most people can’t imagine a different future but they adapt when it is there. They even think it is normal.
Looks like Richard Hammond.
They can literally pour liquid metal into a mold and put comes a car frame that houses the battery and all the attach points.
We’re still at the development point where moving to axial cooling on the pack can increase efficiency noticeably. I’m stoked as hell. Can’t imagine what some ceramic based ultra dense battery will be like 5-10yrs out.

"some people knew what it meant  me and my friends were on discord losing it I didn't think id go over Investors heads like it did and stocks would Fly to the moon.   


DRY ELETRODE!?! THAT MEANS YOU CAN ROLL AND CUT !! (batteries will be able to be made at speeds of Alkaline/Zinc batteries)   
OMG DID THEY SOLVE THE SILICON EXPANSION ISSUE!?!? NO WAY!  
TABLESS=LESS RESISTANCE MEANS LESS HEAT, LESS HEAT MEANS LESS COOLING, LESS COOLING MEANS MORE BATTERY, MORE BATTERY MEANS MORE RANGE!"
"Reminds me of this:  


When the English prime minister asked scientist Michael Faraday what the usefulness of his electromagnetic device was, Faraday replied, “Someday  you can tax it.”"
"Because until it's in production, it's a science project.

Musk has a reputation for over promising and setting unobtainable  deadlines.

Battery Day is a PR event. It's Tesla jerking off into your ecstatic face, and then you coming here to discuss the taste, temperature and viscosity of the jizz."
For a lot of people two years is just too far out to comprehend. And Wall Street analysts are only interested in the next quarter anyway.
"I run a *moderately-sized* investment firm, and even though we all knew that **Battery Day** was coming, I was legitimately asleep during the announcement.

Like, I think a temp watched it, told me it was going on, we had reminders come up in the boardroom, and somehow we got distracted doing something else.

The funny thing is -- so did everyone else apparently, even Internationally, because the stock didn't move at all on Battery Day, when normally it jumps +15-30% on *absolutely no news.*

I think it all comes down to how Elon worded his Tweet, he wrote something like: ""This technology is revolutionary but it won't hit full production until 2023.""

The robo-traders must have taken that as a sign that they're having production issues or something (a speculative announcement rather than -- HOLY CRAP GUYS BATTERIES MK2!!).

The timing was just wrong is all.

We uh -- we're going to watch the Announcement *eventually*. Maybe today, I dunno.

I love Tesla."
"Probably understated too. That was tech they were probably working on years ago, and are going to incorporate for sure. But the stuff they are discovering today would probably melt our brains."
It’s because they were waiting for the words “million mile battery” and were to stupid to realize that what was shown was better. Lmao
The presentation was ass. Elon is terrible at communicating technical jargon's significance in a way laymen can understand. I really wish he'd stop making these things about himself and let someone else take over pr duties at least at formal events like this
"The problem is that anyone can announce stuff like this if it doesn't have to exist in production yet as a reliable product. Solid state batteries have been stuck in that world for a long time. This might not end the same way, but no one can reasonably assess the odds from that sales pitch day."
"He just uses poorly implemented ideas from the past, breaks down problems using 1st principles thinking where possible, applies lessons learnt to date and executes,  inspiring peolle to follow. He does have big balls to execute it all with grand vision in mind, making corrections to grand plan on the fly"
"He’s just taking advantage of the innovators dilemma. I don’t mean to trivialize it, because it shouldn’t be. But that’s what’s going on with Tesla, spacex, and the boring co. 

Read Christiansen’s “innovators dilemma”"
"I am limited by the technology of my time.

Is the guitar not time appropriate? I've never heard that. Thanks for a new piece of trivia.
"But it wasn’t a consumer presentation, it was for investors and this was better than most in that regard. Problem for Tesla is they are so popular investor only stuff is exposed to a wide audience. Much like how WWDC isn’t only for developers now."
"They kinda did give a financial related number though, the percent reduced capital expenditure for the battery plant IIRC. Of course how that effects profit margins is maybe still up in the air with nothing said about how it would reflect in the prices of vehicles."
"Apple presentations post-Steve bore the shit out of me. This presentation was actually way more engaging than I thought it would be, since the innovations presented were Just That Cool. It’s like Steve’s “one more thing” all over again, whereas Apple presentations these days are more “we courageously removed the headphone jack, now pay up pls.” That’s not interesting in the slightest."
They could have kept the original line.

No
"That happened like *one* single

"Additionally, more range means you can use less batteries than now to get the same range (400m), less batteries weigh less which means even more range and even less heat!"
Yea. Those that understand the science were fucking blown away. It's unfortunate that so few people can appreciate what they are actually doing.
"I was listening to it while flipping g the fuck out at the new model s plaid, and the battery technology, and OMG"
I haven't dumped the stock when it's plummeted or cashed-out because I also recall exactly what kind of minds went into Finance in college. The price more or less reflects that. IMO it should be a lot higher.
Just the graph they showed on Tabless vs. tabbed battery heating is fucking wild.  Tabless batteries basically make charging speed a nonissue
"In general, many investors are idiots with too much money but they think they are smart because they have more money than the people at the companies actually doing the work."
Anywhere I could more read about this?
"never mind..many people don't have enough science or understanding of production to ""get it""  , even if you spell it out in caps!"
Since when were the mainstream investors smart and capable of understanding the importance and impact of Tesla tech? The world is STILL sleeping on Tesla’s tech and the meme just gets better and better.
"Less parts to build it, less parts that can break. So many benefits. That’s ok, I bought the dip with my wife’s IRA. The normies will get it eventually. Plus they just announced opening up a new market (India)"
Well that certainly painted a vivid picture.
"1. It is in production at their battery facility, albeit on a small scale. So that already proves it's beyond the 'science experiment' and proof of concept phase. It is now a small-scale manufacturing product that they need to prove can be manufactured at a huge scale, which is an enormous challenge, but let's not pretend they are at level 1 out of 100 here. They are clearly further along than that. 

2. Musk has a problem with deadlines, 0 people in the world including himself would argue that.

But everyone always gets this problem confused with over promising SPECS and PERFORMANCE. In reality, Musk and Tesla almost always comes through with products that are usually better than originally touted. If you look down the line at S,X,3, powerwalls, efficiency, 0-60 speeds, battery degradation, charging speeds, drag co, they almost always overdeliver in these areas, even though their timeline is almost always late. Don't get these two concepts mixed up.

So, let's say they hit these goals but instead of 3 years it turns into 4-5, will they still be miles ahead of their competition? Most would argue YES in a big big way.

3. Hilarious analogy omg you are so cool"
"even if ONE of the the Battery developments Pans out. its a Success  


which IMO  Tabless its a SURE THING i've said it for years, to friends and anyone who will listen Cells Hate heat. Internal Resistance creates heat, its in the name RESISTANCE  the lower you can get it the more power you get out of the cell, the faster it charges the safer it is, the Longer it lasts the Less cooling you need which means more space for Battery material.   


if nothing else Tabless does 2 things, Lower the IR of the cell. and speed up the cell making process to the point where econ of Scale can take over. which means cheaper lower cost cells. think about this too. Assuming you have 18650's in a Hexagon (9 cells) that's about the same size as one 4680 in width. Look at the dead space inside, and dead space used for the casing. now Picture you only have 9 electron highways in and out of those cells.   
now look at the banner on the top of the sub and tell me how many electron highways that is?"
"Tesla has never over promised on the product, always delivered above. The only thing they don't hit is their delivery time(except on the model Y and their factories)

Also the cells are already being produced."
I keep hearing the markets are forward looking. Maybe it's just been priced in already?
"> over promising and setting unobtainable  deadlines.

AND delivering.  Even if not to the deadline, he delivers what he promised, and generally they are things that just don’t exist otherwise"
"PLEASE keep your graphic metaphors in your own little private space

too rude"
"Thank god, someone here with some common sense. Yeah, the reason people aren't shitting their collective pants about this is that Tesla has a history of promising huge things like this and then taking 5+ years to deliver. Its amazing technology, don't get me wrong, but it's only going to be implemented on new their new cars making all the other batteries ""obsolete"" also adoption will take some time since they aren't just giving these cars away."
You have a point
"It's target audience was engineers, as its main purpose is recruiting. And it's working, Tesla and SpaceX are the two most desired companies for engineering students."
It is in production. Just at small scale. They have an actual functional manufacturing line turning out small numbers of these batteries right now. Scale and manufacturing efficiency are the problems they are solving for now.
"You realize the batteries that Elon was talking about were in trials, where solid state battery’s haven’t reached anywhere near that point"
"I feel like you should research the area better, because they are already mass producing them at their pilot project. They even have cars drivning arround with the batteries. This is already far ahead of solid states. It has also solved the problem that solid state tries to solve, but cheaper."
"I feel like 80% of what Elon does, he does because he is annoyed other people haven't done it already, or that they are too slow."
It just feels like he realizes that living a successful life isn’t just about accumulating wealth.  He’d rather risk everything to make all his childhood dreams come true.
"I think the most significant difference between Musk and most other business leaders is his willingness to fail. You try something, screw up and try something else until you get it right. That just isn't possible in most of today's corporate culture where failure is heavily punished so people mainly concentrate on avoiding mistakes."
"yeah. I think one of his biggest risks the last couple of years was announcing those solar tiles for roofs, and they didn't exist. Some journalists claimed they were having trouble getting them to actually work/manufactured. The actual presentation was a complete scam in that respect, none were working.

I think he just kept hitting it until they got something that met a solid standard. You put enough solar shingles on a roof and you will get > 6Kw so I guess that was outcome."
">the innovators dilemma

good read."
"I'm not much of a reader but that sounded interesting so I tried finding a video. Found a [4 minute summary on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUAtIQDllo8). I've got a terrible attention span but this seemed to get the idea across. 

Basically, large companies are often incentivized to do small incremental updates (Galaxy S20) rather than massive R&D on niche products (Galaxy Fold for example) because it's safer when they already have such a grasp on a large market. 

Meanwhile, smaller companies and startups are incentivized to innovate on niche products because larger companies don't care to compete in something that mass markets don't want, so it gives the smaller company time to perfect a product before big companies swoop in and throw cash at the product to steal market share. They gave good examples such as Uber killing taxis, Netflix killing Blockbuster.

Very interesting concept, thanks for sharing. Since you've read the book I'd be interested to know how accurate this video is if you get a chance to check it out."
"Marty McFly's borrowed Guitar in ""Back To The Future"" was a Gibson ES-345TD retrofitted with a Bigsby vibrato. Interestingly, this particular Gibson guitar model was not introduced by Gibson until 1958, and that part of the film takes place in 1955."
Wait.. Elon Musk went Back to the Future?!? Great Scott! That madlad achieved 1.21 Jigawatts!!??
It was an existing guitar-he borrowed it from the band. He was just playing a style of music that didn't exist yet.
People don’t forget.
You fuck one goat...
Twice if you count that time with his grandpa.
Cheaper for the same range please?
"I’m super impressed with overhauling and rethinking the entire manufacturing process. They aren’t just innovating their product, they’re innovating the way eeeeveryone will build factories and make anything in the future. Building the factories AROUND the capital equipment is a novel idea."
That.  Is a very astute observation..
"The graph only showed that ""time to charge"" at a supercharger:

* For the old cell would increase (dramatically) for diameters beyond 21mm
* For the new cell would (only slightly) increase for diameters beyond 46mm

The graph did not show that, for the new cell, charging speed could be increased without issue."
Could someone explain what tabless means to a lay person?
Many of the investors I believe were scared off by the investor QnA prior to the battery presentation where dozens of people were asking for things like labor unions and workplace social justice policies.   Stuff that can stifle or kill a rising business in an extremely competitive market.
"Check out The Limiting Factor on YouTube, he goes super in depth on the battery tech"
"A warm and viscous picture. 

Ty daddy"
">It is I'm production

That's misleading, as long as it isn't in a product available to the general public it's still a project.

Otherwise you could say that Samsung's carbon batteries have been in production for a decade."
"You say most would argue yes, but I have argued with quite a few that are 110% sure that even if Tesla do it in 3 years(personally I think it's gonna be 1 to 2 years) then Tesla would be where all the other battery manufacturers are, and they would even be behind because now they have used massive capital in factories and solid state batteries will throw them out the pack.

Obviously they don't understand the science or technology."
"You will have roughly equal dead space between cells regardless of using large or small cells due to geometry.  If anything, the large cells have more wasted space at the edges of the pack.

My biggest question is how do they plan on cooling these batteries?  Are they cooling the tabs directly?"
"> Tesla has never over promised on the product

Really? Superchargers were all supposed to be solar powered. AP1 was supposed to be able to ""drive anywhere across the country to meet you, charging itself along the way. It will sync with your calendar to know exactly when to arrive."" (not to mention just being able to pull out of your garage and go around the corner to your front door). Model 3 was supposed to have ""spaceship"" steering controls."
"> Tesla has never over promised on the product, a

You've got to be kidding. 

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/823727035088416768?lang=en"
Model Y was shipped too early and should have been delayed with how much of a mess the first wave of cars were. They robbed Peter to pay Paul. I say it still counts as an overpromise.
You must be new to the internet.
"Just because it's eloquent, doesn't mean it's true yet."
"That's the 4860 battery, which will only have a fraction of the announced improvements. Everything else is still early under development and might or might not turn into a viable product."
"Watch the part of battery day where he says very clearly that the Maxwell dbe process has not yet worked. Supposedly the steps to get it to work are understood, but ""hard"". There is absolutely no guarantee of that process making it, especially on their promised timeline."
"All the times we watch movies like 2001, BTTF2, Blade runner, etc and laugh that they were overly optimistic about tech progress.  

Elon gets pissed and goes ""WTF hasn't this happened yet?"""
"Yup - he views money as a means to an end rather than something to be hoarded and preserved.  He wanted to visit Mars, but when he finally did the math on what it would take, he realized just getting dirt cheap space access would not by itself ensure we visit the red planet before his death.

So he knew he needed to make more money than anyone else had ever done before.  *Lots more*.  He was concerned at how little progress was being made on climate change, and saw that nobody was doing EVs seriously.

Right place, right time, right person.

Now Tesla is positioned to become the largest company on Earth by the end of the decade, and probably one of the biggest “contractors” establishing infrastructure on Mars."
"And he’ll be richer for it if he maintains his ideals.

It’s when he settles that we’ll have stagnant technology. We need multiple entrepreneurs so we’re not all dependant on Elon musk types to keep our faith in the future alive.

Imagine if we didn’t have Tesla?"
"Mars?!  Fuck yeah, let’s do it!"
"Risk everything?  He comes from wealth, he was never risking anything."
It’s pretty accurate. The examples in the book are a bit antiquated now (e.g. the digital camera and death of Kodak). The other value in this book is the discussion of a disruptive versus a sustainable product. Christiansen defines a disruptive good as something that offers a new value proposition and probably underperforms when it is introduced.
Next you’re gonna tell me the flying cars shown in 2015 didn’t exist then either!
"Yeah. He makes a cameo in each of the three films. It’s one of the reasons that there’s a fan theory out there that he’s actually a time traveler, and not just fictional."
I love how you went to the effort of setting up your own joke.
That is what he said.  More range for the same price and volume or same for less and smaller.  It probley how $25k model z and 500 miles S happen.  Both ends of spectrums.
I want the same range and less weight.
"Tabs are basically small conducting strips attached to the battery electrodes. These connect to the cell wall as connection points. The electrodes (both anode & cathode) are long strips which are rolled together.

Problems with tabs are:

1. Lower charging speed as current has to travel farther
2. Energy losses due to higher resistance & heating
3. It is a separate component, so costs more
4. While manufacturing, the process has to pause for a few seconds to attach the tab and restart. This causes slower manufacturing line

In the new design instead of the tab at the end of the roll, the made entire one side of the electrode stripe as a connector. I assume one side of the strip is anode and other side is cathode. This way the connection surface is larger, and the current has to pass only the width of the roll not entire length. As the connector is now part of the roll itself instead of separate component, there is not need to pause to attach the connector. 

So manufacturing is faster & cheaper, charge speeds are higher with lower energy losses.

Edit: One more benefit - The size of cell needs to be thinner in old design, as the length of electrodes need to be limited. But with new design, length can be much longer without causing resistance losses. Hence the new size of 46x80mm. So you can pack more energy into the single cell, improving overall energy density and reducing cost further."
Workplace social equality shouldnt be affecting your productivity unless your company is filled with misogynists like Facebook.
"Exactly. No ones saying the tech isn't exciting but so are graphene batteries and where are those? Well, they technically exist but remember when graphene was first discovered? Battery tech was expected to (not literally) boom. Samsung touted 0-100 charge time in 12 minutes. Well it hasn't quite flopped but a decade later and it's proven to be much more of a challenge to put into production. Those two guys that discovered graphene won the nobel prize in physics. It was and is a huge deal, yet here we are 10 years later.

This is an example of why people are (and have a good reason to be) skeptical. We all have dreams and hopes for theoretical tech, but wait until it exists and is obtainable before you start jerking it please."
"So, they would use new and patented technology to get batteries that are double-digits % better on all metrics, and yet they would be behind other battery manufacturers? How do you figure?"
"Cooled from the tabs at each end, they are like highways for heat.  ‘Plate’ cooling instead of wall cooling.    There will be no need for cooling between the Cells, so they will use that space for structure instead.

The lost space of large circles va small circles is identical. For the same area covered."
The steering controls were supposed to be optional on the model 3 because full self driving was supposed to be that good
"No, Elon said that over time almost all super chargers will be converted to solar/battery.

No that wasnt a promise on AP1 but on autopilot in general, which they are insanely behind on.

Changes tend to happen. Never heard anyone complain about missing spaceship steering(what is that even?). Changing things dosent really say what you are trying to claim. They didn't do battery swap or snake charging. Simply because people didn't want it and that it didn't make sense.

They have certainly have over deliverered on specs and performance more than they have missed a few design stuff."

"Yup, and even everything tesla do is based on other people be slow. Tesla insurance, Teslas own battery cell production, Teslas own lithium process plant. Even Model 3, Model Y, Semi, solar products, battery storage is coming from that.

I'm sure Elon expected the car manufacturers to start chasing him when he launched Model S. They said they would but they didn't."
"When you have a billion ending up with only a few million is still risking “everything”. If you have a $1k risking everything but $5, also risking everything.  They both hurt and yes I get they are very different."

"Yeah I don't get it either! From. What I gather, they base it on that what Tesla is presenting is just the industry average improvement."
The tabless designs lower electrical resistance is a x percentage better maybe 2-8%. The cooling improvement is 100x-200X better maybe more. Both of these reduce battery degradation.
I wonder how they cool the ends without short circuiting the cells?
"So, as long as he says ""some day"", you'll keep moving the goal posts for him?

"Nothing. So watch back to the future, it's great.

But he's looking at the guitar like that because Marty just played a shredding guitar solo, like 20 years before that would be a thing, so the guy is like ""What the hell did you just do to my guitar."""
...which IMHO is most definitely not the case
"The battery is a single cell with cathode and anode layers separated by a thin film before being rolled up into a cylinder.   The cathode and anode layers are offset so that when rolled up the anode layer sticks out one end only, and the cathode sticks out the other. So there is no opportunity for them to short out."
">Accountability is an important quality in a mature company.

Tesla is still a pretty young company by industry standards. I wouldn't expect to have mature company expectations of them just yet."

"> If you do the math, you will see the 4690 is only about 2.5x larger than the 21700 cell or about 3.2x larger than the 18650 cell

Do you not understand how volume of a cylinder works...? Your 'math' is multiplying the length and width like it's a two-dimensional rectangle. 

Volume of a cylinder = pi\*radius^(2)*height

4680 cell: pi\*(46/2)^(2)*80 = 132952.2mm^3

2170 cell: pi\*(21/2)^(2)*70 = 24245.2mm^3

18650 cell: pi\*(18/2)^(2)*65 = 16540.5mm^3

132952.2/24245.2 = ~5.48x bigger than a 2170

132952.2/16540.5 = ~8x larger than a 18650

The 4680 having 6x the power of the 2170 cells is a ~9.5% improvement accounting for the size difference."
"Wow that literally increased range across the board. Model 3 is up to 353 up from 322, Model Y is 326 up from 316, Model X is up to 371 up from 351. Model 3 SR+ is up to 263 from 250. No increase on Model S, but it's been slowly increasing over the last few months as well as getting a huge price cut to $69,420 (lol) this week. I don't think its got anything to do with roadrunner cells but I think Tesla partners are increasing their battery density which is good news for Tesla and the industry.

Edit: Model S performance too."
does this mean the model 3 gets a heat pump?
I just took delivery four days ago. I’m really happy with my car but I won’t deny that these exterior changes look very clean. I love the wheels
"Includes chrome delete, new center console and wheels too!

Edit: my first gold on my cake day! Thanks so much!"
"
Ooooh it hurts my model 3 is 8 days old 😂"
SR+ is now 263. Was it 250 before? I forgot.
I literally got my model 3 today SR+ today.
Are those new aero covers?
"Laminated glass I’m hoping? 

Honestly, all this together is a pretty significant update"
As a model 3 owner who received his car 29 days ago... fuck
"That looks siiiiiiiick. And the range increase.

Almost makes me want a new one, especially if the range increase is not software but hardware based.

Either way, really cool things by Tesla."
Looks like 0-60 decreased as well. -0.2 for the long range and -0.1 seconds for the performance
My car feels like a cell phone.  I want to trade it in for the update specs even though I know its a waste of money. The new awd lr has 70 more miles of range than my 2018 awd lr has ( i only charge to 280 miles).  Keep those improvements coming.!
Disappointed in the performance wheels.  I much rather preferred the old gunmetal performance 3 wheels to the model Y style performance wheels.
Why is the center console in the white interior still BLACK?!
The new sport wheels do not look great.
Likely a combination of getting the heat pump and that [5% 2170 improvement by Panasonic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panasonic-tesla-exclusive-idUSKCN24V1GB)
Took delivery two weeks ago. Ouch.
Damn. This whole “I’m gonna hold off on getting a Tesla for a few more years” thing I’m trying to do gets harder everyday.
"My 2018 P3D+ is just fine.

My 2018 P3D+ is just fine.

My 2018 P3D+ is just fine.


My 980ti is just fine.

My 980ti is just fine.

My 980ti is just fine.

Oh, sorry, wrong sub.


Whew!!! Just saved myself a lot of money.  Go me!"
Does Model Y have auto dimming side mirrors?
Ehat about the new steering wheel and double layer glass?
power trunk ??
I do wish it showed less range for 19” vs 18” Aeros though..
This is the way
"This probably also means that the updated tails lights will likely be used. Question remains if the SC can install them onto older Model 3's (hardware wise it should fit, but it may need a software flag change for the lights to work properly).

Also those caps look awesome; it's not too different from the old aeros but the change is noticeable enough that I would like to get them. Wonder if they'll fit on the existing rims."
"So I literally clicked the buy button on monday. I paid the 2500$ and filled all the documentation. It says 5-9 weeks delivery. What are the odds of getting this version and is there any way I can contact a vendor or something and insist Inget this version (even if I have to wait more)?

Edit : no VIN yet too"
Is the front end different at all? Not sure why it looks like something is different. Could just be the wheels and chrome delete throwing me off
"Does the SR get the power trunk, chrome delete and the new center console too ?"
"I bought my Model 3 in April 2019. I can't imagine not having it over the past 18 months, but man these are nice updates! Looking forward to seeing the range improvements and other enhancements when I'm ready for a new one many many many years from now."
"I still have my 2018 LR RWD 3. I fully charged up to 307 miles tonight, then drove 195 miles at around 85mph and had 17 miles left. I wonder if the new version will be any different on actual range. 

In other news I drove 190 miles straight without having to steer or brake at all. Bring on the new codebase."
I wonder if you can get that power trunk installed at a SC.
"fuckkk meee. Just paid for my M3P and picking it up on Monday, praying that it's over the air updates."
"Tesla EVs are going to be like the yearly iPhone release where there is always the latest and greatest hardware refresh, and the software the powers it released for everyone to use, but some features might not be available the older your hardware gets.

I took delivery on my 3LRAWD a little over a year ago.  It's still the best motor vehicle I've ever owned.  I'm glad Tesla keeps improving the hardware, design, and especially the range/battery.  Some day, when I choose to replace my 3, I'm looking forward to the innovations of their vehicle line up at the time."
All glass roof? Did any Tesla’s not come with a glass roof?
"For the record, I took delivery of my LR 3 in mid September and my app now says the acceleration boost goes from “4.2 to 3.7” now. Wonder if that’s been updated across the board or September deliveries got lucky."
"Great! I should be upset because this will take my almost three-year-old LR RWD  resell value way down south. 

But I am not. This will bring and sustain another wave of a massive number of people switching to becoming EV car owners. 

THAT is music to my ears."
The app says acceleration boost will drop my 0-60 from 4.2 to 3.7. I have a 2018 model 3...
Probably had a mode to do 0-69 in 4.20 second
"I was about to buy a Model 3 a week before the pandemic was declared that forced me to work from home. So glad I didn’t. Since waiting I got the chrome delete I wanted, matte center console, $2k price drop, and 30 mile range boost. Can someone confirm if this range boost is a software based improvement or due to battery density updates?"
Do existing owners get a range increase as well? Is this software or larger battery?
For once I prefer the aero wheels over premium wheels.
"I'd just like to extend a big ol' F YOU to all the people who told me over the last 3 months that waiting until Q4 to take delivery is foolish. I took delivery 2 weeks ago and love my SR+, but these improvements are significant. I feel cheated."
Goddamn.
"Can't wait to see when people test it. I am very, very doubtful here about the real world range, but I will be happy to know if I'm wrong.

/ed mistakes"
"They got rid of the good rims? That hella sucks. You pretty much have to buy the performance now, or you’re sitting on some bulllshit. 

Edit: they got rid of the performance wheels too? WTF? For those ugly ass model Y ones? Lame."
Performance gets uberturbines
I wonder why the LR got double the % increase in range than the SR+.
"Wow, I didn't realize the peformance trim has uberturbines"
Heat pump alert

"These upgrades are great!  One thing still missing though - cooled seats.  Elon, if you’re watching - cooled leather seats would literally make me upgrade my Model 3!"
"I know the 353 miles is not really accurate, but the fact that it SAYS 353 miles is crazy. Other manufacturers are shitting their pants.

Btw, add 54% and it's 544 miles, 870km."
I'm so happy with these steady range bumps!  My 2018 model 3 is already down from 310 to 293 miles.  I can't wait for the day when I trade it in for something that will likely have around 400miles of range (in like 10 years :D )
Tesla REALLY needs to bring back the LR RWD. That car might be at 380 miles EPA.
"Is it just me, or do the new wheels look butt-ugly? I’m sure they help with range, but wow the Sport wheel is a massive downgrade."
Unpopular opinion but I honestly think the Chrome delete looks cheaper. There is probably a reason they're keeping the chrome on the Model S and X. But the increased range is always a plus!
"Well below €40k (with incentives) in Germany now for the standard+. Buying an id3 over this Model 3 is now a sign of severe delusion, dementia and negative brain cell count."
Oof I just bought one 2 weeks ago
So that’s about 300 then in my experience 😂😂
Don’t have karma to post but the x got 371 as well.
What was the range before?
"Placed my order September 29th, hope when I get my car in late November early December it’s the refresh!!"
Very impressive Tesla!!
"Great for the new buyers!
I still love my 2020 Model 3 LR AWD :)"
i wonder if the parts for the trim ever leave tesla...i would be totally willing to install black trim that isn’t painted or vinyl installed. happy to see big update for the 3!
Just got email from Tesla saying my order has been updated. The picture on my account has changed to the new design. Lovely
"I just ordered my model y on Tuesday, and I just finished all of the steps required on the website. I'm just waiting for them to write up the contract, for me it says 4 to 8 weeks for delivery, is it safe to say that by the time I get the car it'll have extended range?"
"Is it just me or do the areo wheels look different now/ Maybe it's just the new renders, but they look tweaked and more flat/less rounded ""spokes""."
I hope my Subaru doesn't see the eyes I'm making at this car...
"I would assume if the range increases were actually software related and not hardware, we would have heard about it and would be noted in that last update...right?"
"So many great upgrades! Range increase, performance improvement, upgraded interior, new wheel options, and power trunk finally! Awesome!"
Anyone know if you could buy the new aero covers and pop them onto an older model 3?
"That's pretty insane, especially with the heat pump.

I could live with the old electric heaters by using the steps below to minimize battery drain, but it was always a compromise.

* Apply anti-fog product to inside of all windows.
* Use heated seats.
* Wear Extra socks, sweater, gloves, and hat.
* Keep heater at fan speed of 1, No AC, and always manual (to prevent defroster from turning on)
* Turn off air recirculation (to reduce fogging)"
Great and I just got my model 3 lol in September
[deleted]
Is Acceleration Boost no longer available on the LR model?
"I have a model Y on order as I live in the mountains and the heat pump makes a big difference, but now the model 3 is an option. Not sure what to do here. Model 3 just got a lot more attractive."
Those performance wheels are a bummer. Not a fan.
Do you think we would be able to buy the new aero covers down the road? I like the new ones compared to the old ones.
Is the range for existing owners going to be updated via a software update?
"This and all the other news is great.  Does anyone know why Tesla upped all of these changes? I understood the S price decrease to compete with Lucid but Model 3, Y, and X?

Anyways this is great news for raising the bar. Great job Tesla employees &/or Elon."
Any news if the M3 is being upgraded to “double paned” glass windows for a quieter cabin?
Oof. They got rid of the gunmetal performance wheels and replaced them with the Y ones.
Anyone with one of these that can update us on the USB situation. It mentions 4 USB-C ports in the center console and wireless charging. Does it have the USB in the glove compartment? Can you put the USB cables in the phone charging area from underneath like before?
I want to know if there is going to be an official retro fit for a Lift gate for old model 3s. This would make me happy.
Missed opportunity to make it 351 (420-69) 😎
r/chargeyourphone
Can someone buy my 2013 honda civic already so I can order my model 3?
Cries in 280miles of range on my ‘18 P3 with Aeros.
What real world mileage are m3/mY owners seeing from 90% charge down to 10%?
*cries in mid-range*
What that page is sadly missing: a nice Emerald Green Metallic!
I am so happy I did not pick my order up and pushed the delivery date 🥵.
I have a 2018 Model 3 LR AWD now known as a medium range AWD. That’s ok. I love my car but I will say this. The next few years are going to be brutal. My five cents is that battery tech is going to make a 400 mile Tesla a very real possibility. That said in IMO OTA Software Upgrades are critical for keeping the existing tribe satisfied in the face of  these hardware upgrades rolling out which obviously will only be available to new buyers. No more BS tweets you only get this new software feature if you pony up for FSD.
Take their range estimates with a grain of salt. I’ve never gotten 240 miles in my 2019. And it has never even shown more than 225 miles estimated when fully charged 100%.
"The new 19"" wheels look much cheaper than their previous versions. I also really dislike the look of the new center console.
It used to looks futuristic, now it looks run-of-the-mill. Sigh..."
wow
Are those Aero wheels new?
It seems the auto dimming mirrors are not part of it after all?
"Does anybody know when they expect to deliver the refresh? I ordered mine the end of september (Europe, Holland). This looks way better!"
When can we expect real world tests?
how close is the listed/EPA range compare to real world driving?
I have mine since 1 Year now. Its amazing to see how much Tesla improves in only one Year! Also more Range for all Models! 30-50 km :)
I cannot describe actually how excited I am for this!
competition is coming /s
I’ll never understand why you guys don’t use the metric system 😩
"Heated mirrors on the premium interior are a new feature, right?  I know my 2017 Model 3 doesn’t have them."
My wife and I took delivery of an S and X this week. She missed out on the 30mi of range. Hoping we don’t both miss out on chrome delete... but all good. We’re so happy with our cars.
"The question about the range difference is: Is this a measurable difference, or did they just file new paperwork and/or go through additional testing and the car's performance w.r.t range remains the same."
Chrome delete as well.
Is it just me or was the Y at 316 and is now 326??
Did they change the model 3 picture? It looks different
"So I'm a sucker that took my model 3 AWD LR  delivery about 3 weeks ago, love my car, but really jealous of the extra 10% range. Is it possible to get a heat pump etc. installed and get that extra range, or am I basically SOL?"
"Cries for my Mid-Range hahaha, still love my 3"
"Well, I was scheduled to pick up my SR+ on Monday. I'll be having a conversation with my sales rep today and seeing if I can get moved over to the new 2021 model."
"Man, now I’m even more torn between the 3 and Y"
Does all glass roof mean no beam across the center now?
Got an appointment to test drive a M3 next weekend. What are the odds that these updates will be on the ones I look at?
"The X is at 371 now too! Given that I picked mine up 17 days ago, this is annoying..."
Don't forget the 4.20 second 0-60. 😎
wait we can now order the refresh now?
"This is great news! I’m not in the market for a new vehicle anytime soon, but by the time I’m ready - battery tech will have improved again.

For me 340 miles of range is like the bare minimum for a car. Glad to see more range!"
Is the range increase due to battery tech or an OTA update?  Wondering if my '19 SR+ will get any additional range.
"am i crazy but with no chrome, black paint looks meh?"
Does it include a heat pump?!?
"For only $2000, I'm game."
Hopefully this helps drive down the used market prices a bit!
"Do we have official word if this is a result of the heat pump and octovalve?

My personal opinion, it’s a result of the higher density Panasonic batteries as well as the octovalve. I don’t believe the heat pump has any effect on EPA established range, but has a significant effect in real world range especially in cooler and cold temperatures between 30-50 Fahrenheit. With that said, I really hope that the heat pump is included as I live in a colder climate from Oct-Mar. 

Just my thoughts."
OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Lets hope this longer range rolls into the CyberTruck, would really love to get a lot of miles of range on that bad boy since it will be my road trip car."
That's awesome! I go on there everyday to try and pre-order a model y with 7 seats. No luck yet
"Nice updates, but those wheels do be ugly"
"To me, the bigger deal is the SR+ at 263m. That's enough to be a decent road tripper, at least on interstate routes. For $38k."
Wonder if this also has the updated double glass pane windows
That's about as much as my civic.
Maybe it can charge your phone
Is it just me or did they change the performance model’s wheels as well?
"Don't suppose anyone has ordered one today? Curious what picture it shows in the order screen - I put in an order a couple days ago and it shows the pre-refresh version there. Guessing the picture just hasn't been updated in that part of the site, or that it's based on when you ordered it, but I'm assuming since I literally just ordered I'll be getting a refreshed version."
So glad I just got my car on the 29th and it doesn't have any of the new stuff. Other than the qi charger and I got to pay the exact same price. Thanks tesla.
Is the speculated heat pump something that can be retrofit on to existing M3s?
"I just check SR+ Range and it shows 263mi, was it already like that before?"
Any way to retrofit the trunk? Cuz that’s all I’m really missing
What’s it cost?
Is this the standard range?  And you'll love that red.  Wife gets tons of compliments on hers
"On the UK store, its displayed at 352 miles for some weird reason.  I guess it might be a round up from KM conversion.    


Also the aero covers on the standard and long range, and new rims for the sport version.  However the sport upgrade on the standard and long range versions are still the old sport rims?"
Man I'd love to have 40 extra miles on my model 3
Looks like it has new headlights as well.
"That's amazing!

Now could you please modify the app so that the purchase of an upgrade requires me to type in my password again, to prevent me from butt-purchasing additional multi-thousand dollar upgrades?"
"dang, i wish i waited now. lol"
Come back when it's 420.
Someday. Someday I will own a Tesla. I love this company so hard
"Btw, it has been confirmed officially by Tesla spokesperson in Norway that Model 3 does indeed have heat pump now. Excellent news all around!"
makes me want tesla even more
"Heated steering wheel ommmmgggg

https://www.google.ca/amp/s/electrek.co/2020/10/16/tesla-launches-model-3-2021-refresh-range-features/amp/"
Whew still too expensive but I don't expect that to ever change unfortunately.
Do the new Aero wheels still have the removable cover exposing the actual metal wheel underneath?
"360 miles for the long range in the UK

Standard is 267 miles"
"Honestly, I would pay money for different aero wheel caps."
is that with extension or is that base?
So it has more battery than your phone
"I know people who got the free color and then used the $2000 to wrap their vehicle, can be any color you want and it can be changed 😉"
"Weird that there's been 0 word about the SR+ AWD that's been rumored to come out very soon. Wonder if that's been delayed/fell through, would've been a great seller IMO."
"Sounds petty, but I’m holding off until they add ventilated seats as an option. I made myself a promise that my next car would have them, and I’m sticking to it ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

California summers need butt coolers. Period."
Awesome! What was the range before?
I wish these started at $20k.
Are the aero wheels black underneath the cover now?
Showing 360 miles on UK site
"So I'm probably late to the party on this but have anyone else noticed the LR msrp is not $42,690? To go along with the 69,420 Model S."
Shit now I gotta put in an order and park my Truck for utility work only.
"Havent even got my model 3 performance yet and its already getting upgraded lmao 

Love tesla"
So tempted to sell my LEMR and get an AWD LR. But kinda want to wait to see if they ever release a 400+mile LR RWD.
"*meanwhile in DIO’s mansion*
serect ur cur"
"cool, can't wait until I need a car again..."
"Is this for existing LR model 3s too or just new?

Never mind just read the rest of the comments :("
Nice increase!
"If I’m due to take delivery for the 2020 model in the coming days, is there anything I can do to re-order for the 2021 model? Without losing my deposit or having to buy a different model."
anybody know what’s the easiest way to get power trunk on existing M3s?
x to doubt
Anyone else take delivery recently and get the new steering wheel like I did??
It's like 80k in Canada though with the self driving feature. Just ouch. I guess I have to wait.
I have a 2018 Model 3 LR AWD now known as a medium range AWD. That’s ok. I love my car but I will say this. The next few years are going to be brutal.

That said in IMO OTA Software Upgrades are critical for keeping the existing tribe satisfied in the face of  these hardware upgrades rolling out which obviously will only be available to new buyers. No more BS tweets you only get this new software feature if you pony up for FSD.
"The new Aeros look so much better!  Not bubbly like the last ones, a little more clean looking IMO

And I am so happy For the 20” Uberturbines.  Sooooooooo badass on the Model 3."
I wonder what bumped up the Ys range. We already have the heat pump. I’m curious if that is a software efficiency and the bump will show on the next update!!!
"I'm around a year out from buying a M3.  I was thinking of going with SR+ to save money but now considering paying up for the LR.  30 miles increase in range for the LR is a significant improvement but SR+ is only 13 miles?  Also, it seems the LR version holds its value much better than the SR+.  Looking forward to the double-pane windows!"
I have no idea how they get 353 miles of range. What kind of tests are they basing this off of? What speed and temperature?
"It's the EPA estimate - no one will get that. I've got a 2018 LR 3 and it has never even charged up to the estimated 310. And now the best I get at a full charge (trip mode) is 290. And that's just sitting in my garage. Start driving it and I think the most I've gotten in the real world (with flat roads, no storm or rain, summer driving is about 260. Not impressed."
Both rims for long range and performance are ugly as hell now and the center console. So it gained in performance but lost in aesthetics.
[deleted]
Check your app. pay to play is now 4.2s to 3.7s. It's possible this range increase is software update ( I hope)\_\_:)
"If the range bump is just due to the heat pump then this won't have any effect on summer highway range, only winter range and the EPA test numbers. I'm holding off until tests show more usable kWh."
"RIP Chrome Trim 😢

On the other hand, the 18” wheel without aero caps now matches the car very well. 100% the way to go."
"Cool cool the Sr gets power trunk but we who paid 60k + get unbearable road noise.

Hopefully they sell all this aftermarket"
353 is nice but I'm waiting for the 50% longer lasting battery-day batteries. A 450 mile battery using a 80% charge/20% discharge cycle would get me to my sister's and back without stressing the batteries.
"I’m jealous. And expecting at least 400 in several years. The 3 still needs a new frame and simplified wiring. With the latter, they should be able to reach $35k price or a bit lower. Just wow."
You have to pay extra for red paint?? WTF!
Thats with the dual motor though
Awww man I was selling my 3 to get a Y
I’m beyond disappointed at the forced uberturbine wheels on the performance. I personally believe they’re god awful hideous. The old black sport wheels were infinitely more attractive than those abominations. What a piss poor shame.
Someone please make a side by side comparison of all the changes!
"What’s the price on this one? $42,069?"
Wow. I should’ve waited on my SR+. I got mines two weeks ago :(
Looks like a great upgrade. Not too fond of the chrome delete. Judging by previous times it's odd that you'll still get that even if you ordered your car when the order page showed it looking different. My car came with different wheels then ordered because of something like this. It wasn't a big deal but if given the choice I'd probably have gone for the original ones.
"DAMMIT ELON

I could now get a Performance top-of-the-line M3 fully loaded with better everything for the same monthly payment as I'm paying now on my LR RWD from 2018 that takes 5.4 sec to get 0-60"
FUCK I JUST GOT MY CAR 3 WEEKS AGO FK MY ASS
man i wanna trade mine in just for the chrome delete
So what is the estimated price range for this model 3? I've gotten to ride in a model 3 performance a year ago. Pretty impressive!
Estimate. Real world is much less.
"All these constant prices decreases, range increases, and physical updates only make me put off getting the actual car. Is there any reason to not put off buying the car if this keeps happening?"
It should be noted that this is with their 'long range' optional package.
Yes but not for the base model...
It's like 80k in Canada though with the self driving feature. Just ouch. I guess I have to wait.
I have a 2018 Model 3 LR AWD now known as a medium range AWD. That’s ok. I love my car but I will say this. The next few years are going to be brutal. My five cents is that battery tech is going to make a 400 mile Tesla a very real possibility. That said in IMO OTA Software Upgrades are critical for keeping the existing tribe satisfied in the face of  these hardware upgrades rolling out which obviously will only be available to new buyers. No more BS tweets you only get this new software feature if you pony up for FSD.

So does this mean now Tesla is doing model year refreshes?
"Got mine M3 three weeks ago. Asked about the rumoured heatpump upgrade and they told me nothing. I really wanted the heatpump.
Now I hate my new Tesla and Tesla as a company... It's really annoying."
"So, real world miles is now 300"
It looks like a Ford Focus tho lmao
If you cant remember to charge your phone how are you going to charge the car
Does this have cooling and massaging seats? If not it’s a really expensive Honda Accord.
All good but if the steering rack fails or the roof blows off and isn't covered by warranty...
[deleted]
Did not bother to include price.
I don’t even know why Tesla bothers selling the model 3 in Canada. 353 miles won’t even get you to the next city over LOL
Didn't tesla just get called out as basically the worst cars by a long shot reliability wise?
"God damn guys that’s like 151.5 miles of range for every inch of penis you have! Combine that with a top speed of 72.5 mph for every inch of penis you have and this is a midlife crisis machine for the ages!

Edit: Math error it’s really 62.23 mph for every inch of penis you have. Many a-PO-logies"
"Hmm, previously Model 3 on norwegian page showed 560km for LR, now it is 580. But on us page it changed by 31 miles or almost exactly 50km? And it uses stricter EPA cycle than our WLTP. Why was the range increase only 20km then? What am I missing? 

But goddamn this is an amazing update across the board, just hope the mysterious heat pump will really be there too."
So does anyone know if an order was placed before today: would you get the specs based on what you ordered or is your car going to be up to these new specs?  IE when do actual deliverable cars match the updates on the website?
Check model s performance
Yes Panasonic has increased it 5%
Any idea what is causing the range increase for the Model X? Software or hardware?
[deleted]
Just a curious question but how accurate is the miles you have left while driving? Would you be comfortable taking it down to the last 5-10 miles or stop when it's at like 30 left or something?
">I don't think its got anything to do with roadrunner cells but I think Tesla partners are increasing their battery density which is good news for Tesla and the industry.

That’s wonderful news if true. It would mean battery day was somewhat of a kick in the pants, so the cost curve should accelerate downwards even faster than tesla was projecting."
">**Model 3 SR+** is up to 263 from 250. 

> **Model 3 LR** is up to 353 up from 322

> **Model Y** is 326 up from 316

> **Model X** is up to 371 up from 351. 

> No increase on Model S, but it's been slowly increasing over the last few months

Formatting"
I wonder what a Model 3 LR RWD range world be now. 385 miles? That would be awesome if they bring it back...
Range increase comes over the air on next update 2020.40.7. So it's certainly control software optimization.
Do you think we can get similar mileage with an update ? 2020 m3 LR is currently 322
Very likely. They likely got a bunch of that extra range by making the HVAC system more efficient by switching to heat pump and octovalve.
"I am pretty sure the heat pump was what caused the range increase, along with the new wheels."
"I wonder if the HVAC changes will reduce its effectiveness in hot weather. I know many Model Y owners had issues, not sure if that's still a thing or not though"
My sales rep confirmed the heat pump has been added
7 day return policy
[deleted]
You can chrome delete your car and get new awesome rims from T-Sportline. Exterior changes can be made on any car!
"The new performance wheels suck, I was wanting to buy one but now it’s ugly rims"
Got mine in the 8th. lol
"My two least favorite part of my model 3 is wind noise and inefficient heating.

I would return."
Do the new rims look a little better in person?
Did they change the aero wheel?
"Hey, if you're still in the return window I would try my luck and give them a call, ask if they can throw in some free supercharger miles, something from the Tesla store. 

I wouldn't be bothered actually going through with a return for a small range increase, but if I got a price cut, some swag then I would probably be happy."
Power trunk as well
Auto-dimming side mirrors are officially back too.
"Probably need to stop calling it chrome delete, since it never had it."
What is the new center console?
Is that the 2021 model year?
How much you spend total?
Is it chrome delete if it wasn't chrome in the first place?
+ new headlights too it seems
"Since you're the top comment can you edit to add more range, auto dimming side mirrors, and possible heat pump?  If I didn't already pay for FSD I would 100% upgrade my 2018 LR RWD."
The car comes with wheels? No way!
"> Includes chrome delete, new center console and wheels too!

Damn, Tesla's selling cars with wheels now? What will they think of next!"
It’s not chrome delete. It’s just no chrome. Chrome delete is wrapping chrome. Chrome delete does not mean black trim!
"Center consol is just matt color instead of piano black, just change in color dude nothing big"
The Tesla experience. Welcome to the club.
I share your pain. Mine is 9 days old. Oh well.
"Model S, 2014.  No AP, AP arrived shortly after. 

Model S, 2016.  New seats and APv2, I had V1. The week after.

Model 3, 2020. Ah well, at least I had a few months."
Part of the game!
"2 week club, m3p. Don’t care about cosmetic changes but speed and range kill me."
"Could be worse, your Model S could be 8 days old (and $5,5000 more expensive than it needed to be)"
"Isn’t their return policy pretty good? Can’t you just send it back and get a new one?

Edit: I’m asking because I almost bought one and wondered about doing this if this situation arose."
"If it makes you feel any better, for the same amount I paid less than 2 years ago you can now spend the same and get two motors instead of one and over 100 miles more range.

That one stings a bit."
20 days old here. I feel ripped off since I payed the same price and got less.
"my parents got a Model S right when they switched to the MCU 2.  They should have probably returned it but I know they didn't really care or wanted to go through the buttpain, so they just kept it.  Worst case they will upgrade in a few years anyway"
"Next time buy a Ford, Dodge or Chevy - the 10-years-later model will be just as shitty, though possibly in different ways."
"Well if you even could return it, you probably would have to wait until end of quarter to actually get a delivery."
And here I am feeling bad when mine is 4 months old lol
Two weeks for me!
Mine is 2 days old!
You’re correct. It was 250
"Important to note this says ""Est"" not ""EPA est"". This is not EPA certified and internal testing. Again, though, range means nothing. YMMV... literally.

Edit: SR+ range change is Est.

[https://imgur.com/a/8ivXIlW](https://imgur.com/a/8ivXIlW)"
"EPA rated ranges for the SR+ by model year:

* 2019: 240 miles
* 2020: 250 miles (+4.2%)
* 2021: 263 miles (+5.2%)"
What does this mean for us midrange Owner’s 😂
"I mean, I don't invoking it is a *good* idea, but they *do* have a 7-day, no questions asked return policy."
The used market on low mileage SR+ is like the same as buying new. You might lose less than thousand or even make money if you sold as a private party.
"Return it and buy it under another account or under a relative’s name. You can always title the car in your name and take over the tesla account later. 

You don’t want to take the immediate depreciation on an older tech car if you can help it and in your situation, you can help it."
Enjoy the car! You're going to love it
"Any updates? We’re in the same boat, picked up our delivery 5 days ago.

Seems like thread is encouraging return but the strategy to get the newer version isn’t clear.

I bought my Tesla with my girlfriend, we’re both on the account and loan agreement. Any advice from people on this thread to handle return situation and order same spec Tesla?"
Looks like it
Yup. New aeros
Will the new Aero covers come off like the previous Model 3?
"Yes, I want this too. Can somebody in the know get the facts on this one?"
I just hope they *glue* the glass on.
I feel you. Just got mine three weeks ago. Still love it though!
"Same here, always the risk with technology. You'll still get the performance increase, and maybe a little of the range increase which wouldn't be the case with other manufacturers. 

We also benefit from a mature production run. Which is often important... Especially with Tesla."
I've had mine for a year and still totally in love with it. These upgrades do not make me want to change at all.
"If you waited, you will always be waiting. The centre console in the old one is much nicer. Just get it wrapped. I have mine done with Matte Black, it's so much nicer. DM if you want pictures. Cost me £80."
"I am sorry. 

On the bright side, you’ve had an awesome car for 29 days and counting; it hasn’t become anything less than awesome."
I like the chrome and the OG center console 👍
Took delivery 3 weeks ago :(
"Exact same timing here. The added range and improved glass for sound dampening are my biggest misses. The cosmetic upgrades aren’t huge deals for me. Love the car, but this does make it feel like a cell phone cycle."
"That’s ok 29 days after I got mine last year. They reduced the price of the performance by ~5k and made the previously expensive white paint the base color knocking another 2k off of what it would cost to buy it a month later than I did 🙃


Always something better around the corner. I just reminded myself what I will suggest to you now. The car you have is safer, more technology packed, and significantly better driving experience than a vast majority if not all other cars on the road and these new trim features (minus small range bump) don’t change that 👍🏻"
I feel yoi
I got mine 350 days ago and still feel that way ;-).
"Thank you for you sacrifice.

That said, it's kind of shit that Tesla isn't more transparent about this stuff. It's anti-consumer behavior and they should be called out for it."
[deleted]
Got mine in late august. Fuck.
Got mine in late august. Fuck.
Got mine in late august. Fuck.
"2.9 days for me, but that is the way the tesla cookie crumbles."
"I hear you I ordered a couple weeks ago, and got a call right away that they were able to find a match from another location in my area, I’m sure it was because someone else knew and push their delivery, at first I was a little conflicted, and thought about telling them that I want to stay in line.

I took delivery middle of last week, I just don’t care, I love this car, and I’m happy I didn’t wait, my Benz was depreciating like a stock market crash, but because of Covid limited production had just got a few thousand bump, waiting a couple months would have probably cost me several thousand and it would have deprived me from driving my new car. I love it.

3’ish years seems like the timeline, so I’ll just keep an eye out, and look to trade for new in about 3.5 years."
"I’m right there with ya. Took delivery on 9/19. Did the chrome delete myself, so that’s whatever. I’m ok without the power trunk, but it would be nice. Actually prefer the older style console... but the extra range and new glass would be great to have."
"It most certainly is the hardware changes 

Especially the heat pump/octovalve"
thinking about it but no...i shouldn’t. it’s not worth it.
Acceleration Boost got updated in app to say 4.2s to 3.7s. I wonder if that means even older models will do 3.7s with Acceleration Boost
The previous range for the performance was a compromise. Now it truly is the best.
"They might have just updated the 0-60 times, my early 2020 LR+ consistently does 0-60 in 3.7 even on 60% battery. 0-60 in 3.5 with rolling start."
It's only in the US tho which is wierd. German store and canadian story both have the upgraded model but still.4.4sek. call me crazy but my new m3 (2months old) feels faster since the update yesterday. My wife texted me today if I bought the acc boost. And I was no I just installed the new upgrade. Super wierd
wonder if this is a sw or hw change
"Huh, is it heavier?"
"Best to treat it like a PC (and not fall into the constant upgrade trap) and just do a big upgrade after a few CPU cycles. (Or in this case, after a few big refreshes)"
"The biggest downer is you can’t transfer the software you purchased (FSD) like you can with a phone.  If I could move my FSD, hello new M3"
My 240 mile Sep 2019 SR+ is at 220 miles. Kinda sucks when that charger is riiiiiight at the limit. The southeast US needs some more SCs sprinkled around to fill in some gaps.
This is a big reason why a lot of people lease their vehicle instead of buying. Every 2 years or so you'll be driving the latest and greatest car from X car company no matter what.
"> The new awd lr has 70 more miles of range than my 2018 awd lr has ( i only charge to 280 miles).

That...seems like a ridiculous way to compare the range of the two. Why wouldn't you use the maximum range (310)? I also have a 2018 dual motor, but only charge it to 160. I'm not going to pretend like the refreshed version is double my current range."
No more Michelin pilot sports too.
Agreed.
"Yeah, honestly I think these are very heavy, and I don't like their looks much. Don't look very good on the Y"
O my. I loathe those wheels. Such a bummer they got rid of the other wheels.
I actually *much* prefer the original silver wheels (which I had on my Dec 2018 P3D+).  Had I bought another one with the dark wheels I would have immediately powedercoated them back to silver.
I bet you could find someone who likes these better and already owns the others to trade with?
There’s always the track pack wheels 👀
I hope they are less fragile than the old performance wheels. A moderate pothole could destroy those rather easily.
"Was on the old one too. Except there you could get a wrap easier.

I'm sure people will find a way here eventually though"
Seriously.
So all your elbow grease doesn't show up.
I would like to find out how difficult it is to swap in the new center console
The spokes? have a flat termination instead of angled where they meet the rim. That is what is throwing everyone off.
I like them when matched with the pearl white paint
Yep despite all the other goodies (really wish I had a power trunk) I’ll take my current 3 and it’s silver sport rims over the new ones every day.
This is why Tesla doesn't announce stuff like this.  They just do it so people arn't waiting in the wings holding out.
Me too
"Haha same.  I'm holding out for Cybertruck... I'm holding out for Cybertruck.... I'm holding out for Cybertruck


If I keep saying it maybe it will happen."
It’s much easier when you can’t afford it!
while this is a major update you get updates every few months. no point holding out. My model 3 stealth performance doesnt feel like anything less of a car now even though it has 100km less range (with degradation) than a new 3. And no powertrunk. Dont like that anyway. And old centre console which imho looks better.
"According to the Tesla site, no."
"Since the model 3 does I’m going to say yes. 
You can also look it up in the Cars manual."
My sales rep confirmed double paned glass was not included in this refresh.
Yup. Says it right in the screenshot under “Select Your Car”.
What updated tail lights? I didn’t read anything about that 🤭
"The 18"" rims under the caps look the same, so I'm guessing they'll fit."
On the Model Y there was no SW change. At least one car accidentally came with the old light on one side and the new one on the other. Oops!
"Chances are high you'll get a 2021 version, in the off chance you get a 2020 L VIN, just call Tesla, speak to a service advisor and have the VIN unassigned."
"Looks longer/slimmer than in real life, but that's probably just the lens/angle that made it look like that"
I don't think so. It looks just like all the white Model 3s that I park next to at work each day.
Looks like it
Yes
"The range difference driving 55 vs 85 is huge. At 55 I get like 200 whm, at 85 it’s like 300. 50% less efficient."
"Well, 85 mph is way above the usual testing speed (and probably also above all speed limits unless you drive in Germany's autobahns)."
"I'm guessing this was in some sort of adverse conditions. My lifetime average wh/mi is 270, or 10% worse than the car is rated for due to excess speeds on my highway commute. If I keep the speed at 70-75 mph with my mix of 60/40 highway driving I will typically hit the 245wh/mi rating and my car seems to perform pretty close to the theoretical range of the battery (295 miles on LR AWD, 5% degradation at just under 50K miles)."
"Drag is basically exponential with speed, so you might want to drive a safer/slower speed if you want better range.  You'd gobble up a lot of gas in a combustion car doing that as well."
My appointment for something else is in two days. Going to be my first question along with the glass
"If you haven’t picked it up, you can reject pick up. Also you can check if your vin is a 2021 model."
"If you haven't gotten it yet, then reject the car if it's not a new one.   You'll get assigned a new VIN and you don't have to wait a year."
I called up my sales and they are going to refund the difference!! amazing Tesla!!
Maybe you get one of these. Also according to Elon you can give your bought car back if you don't like it (up to 7 days and less than 1600km driven). Now if you want to go through with this hassle is up to you.
I'd think you'd get one of these
The base model 3 was supposed to have a Metal roof but they scrapped that as the engineering wasn’t worth it of making one roof for all Model 3 models.
Model S for many years was metal top or opening sunroof.
"Wow think you are the first person I've seen point this out. Mine says the same, very close to pulling the trigger."
Same!
Those things always look better on paper than in person and vice-versa for the premiums
"Mate, if you wait for the next best Tesla before purchasing, you’ll never ever own one."
"Yeah... Had my M3 like 2.5 weeks.... Still love the car but also feel a bit cheated.... Although on my first road trip already and smashed abetterroutepanners estimates, in some cases arriving with 10%+ more than estimated (granted used conservative values)"
"This happens with everything though. I bought a highlander some time back, and the next year there was a significant upgrade to the infotainment, and a transmission upgrade that got it 3 additional mpg. I missed out on a 12% fuel economy boost. It happens with everything we buy."
"I know the feeling sucks but you will get over it I promise.

Many of us took order of a midrange M3 end of 2018 when they ushered us in to get the tax credit. Well, not long after the credit cut in half they decreased the price of the car by $4000, eventually added autopilot for free, and ended up including all the things we paid for the premium interior anyway (except heated back seats but who gives a crap lol)

So yeah, you still got a great car and a good deal"
"If it makes you feel any better, I like the chrome more."
Right there with ya
Yeah because everyone knew there was an update coming.
"No vehicle’s advertised MPG/range is real world. The problem is with the EPA, not Tesla. The test needs to be revamped across the board and should be made to be more indicative of a real world scenario for all vehicles."
But wouldn't it still make the real world range ~5% better?  Like I know it's not going to get that full 350+ but neither did it get the full 320+ before.
"I wonder if this is at least partially software, a possibility since it has two motors compared to the SR+'s 1. 

That said, maybe not needing to use two motors to generate heat inefficiently makes the octovalve and heatpump doubly effective in the AWD?"
In 3 years most likely.
"I agree, the new sport wheels are extremely ugly."
"I think they look pretty good on the white car, not as good on the other colors."
Y had the blacked out trim. Now they only need to produce one trim style for both cars.
Chrome doesn’t belong on any car made in this century tbh.
"The base ID3 with 45kwh usable after incentives will cost €26k vs €34k for the sr+, so I dont really see your point
Edit €26k is for 56 kwh. The 45 kwh will cost from €21k after incentives"
Oooor just wanting a more compact car. Your comment is the exact reason why a lot of people think tesla drivers are entitled pricks. There's a million reason for why choosing a product over another one.
Has been like that for several months now
"But insurance for Model 3 is not cheap. A version with less power would be nice.

My insurance would take 3000 € a year for the Model 3 because of the power. That is quiet a bit more than my Toyota."
That’s the downside of not having real model years. You never know when a refresh is about to take place. Legacy auto has a more predictable schedule when it comes to these things.
322 mi for long range AWD.
"And 250 for SR+. So a solid 5% increase for SR+, and an incredible 10% for the AWD LR."
"It seems highly likely - and if it's not, then don't accept it and they'll assign you a new car."
Did you get a vin assigned?
"That 4 to 8 weeks is a lie.

I got 4 to 11 weeks and they notified me that I had to get my car in a week and a half."
This is about the model 3
"I noticed that too, if these are the new aero wheels is a huge upgrade"
"Definitely different, at least in the renders. The silver part is less pointy and more rounded in the center. The silver doesn’t look to be as dark either."
"Yes, this is why you bougt a 50k car, to sit in the cold wearing extra socks."
"Interesting, I actually only like the black trim when it’s on the midnight silver version. The other ones look like hot wheels to me. I wonder why that is"
Only after you download more RAM
My sales rep confirmed the double paned windows are not part of this refresh.
Probably 85% for me.
I think what’s really missing is a silver metallic.
The cheapest model S is already over 400.  And the price has been lowered twice lol
"It depends on how you drive it, and the estimate also has certain climatic assumptions"
Yes.
auto dimming mirrors are back as of september
autodimming mirrors dont matter at all.
You can get EPA easily with AC/heating off driving around 95 km/h usually.
"Hi, please dont destroy pussies,  I still need them. 🍆"
"I think the costs of switching probably outweigh the benefits of switching. 

Academia (biology, chemistry, physics) is already mostly metric anyway."
My 2018 that I got in may of that year has them.   There is not a dedicated button.  They turn on when you turn on the rear defrost.
Always had that. They just turn on with the normal defroster
"Just checked, I'm sure it's new."
Unlikely. Would require too much reconfiguration.
I'm in the exact same boat as you my man.. Very disappointing to see.
i mean its the same with BMW. The models get progressive updates throughout the years including i.e. xenon headlight etc. if you order before you miss out but usually get a slightly cheaper price.
well youve had your car for like 3 years now.
or some serious discount.
I struggle with this all the time.  Space vs handling.
I’m kinda hoping for this.
Almost 0
You mean 0-69?
That slows considerably if you’re 420.
Looks awful
Yes
"Cybertruck was already advertised to have 500 miles of range before all the battery advances.  I love the S price drop and the increase in range on the 3, but the Cybertruck is what I'm (trying) to hold out for."
"Agree with road trip part especially in winter. That was IMO biggest issue with standard range plus. 

But I remember when they made 3s range “250” miles and literally saw zero difference."
I doubt it would be an easy process at all... The frunk size would have to change and it's a complete system overhaul
Previously it was 250 mi.
There are mods out there.
"The long-range (the model with the above range) is $46,990 without additional options."
Doesnt Europe have their own agency that rates the range? In US its EPA. Isnt it like NEDC in Europe? they would run their own tests and give their own rating.
what does a heat pump do?
"I found some Google AMP links in your comment. Here are the normal links:

Long range version
When they put 4680's in it I predict a 400 mile version. (or more)
Contact your advisor and tell them you want the 2021 model. You can get a new VIN assigned.
What’s the new steering wheel?
"There is already a 406 mile Tesla you can buy today. The added range is nice and all, but hardly necessary."
"It's possible that this range increase is mostly reflecting the cold weather improvement with the heat pump. In which case it won't really go any farther in warm conditions, it's jut being penalized less for cold weather range loss.

As usual with EPA range ratings to actually get it you've probably got to go 60mph in warm weather on a flat road with a tailwind."
"This is the EPA standard test, similar to the “combined mpg” test of gasoline cars. And like that test, it doesn’t represent any specific real world condition, and is more like in between all conditions."
It has to be a tightly controlled environment so that cars can be compared between manufacturers. It's good for the consumer as long as they understand that it's not a real world figure.
"Interesting. Can I ask what your lifetime Wh/m is? I have the same 2018 LR and get 240 spring / summer miles on a trip I usually take at highway speeds 70-80ish. And I make it home with 10-15% (if I charge to 100 before I leave). 

I’ve never taken it from 100 to 0 but I feel like 280 or 290 wouldn’t be a stretch."
Probably a battery chemistry change
"Unlikely, there is almost certainly a heat pump in there."
"Some bits will be. Maybe performance, might get a marginal improvement in range but nowhere near the 5-10% quoted here."
"I hope so too, but this being Tesla it’s probably just as likely that they didn’t mean to update the app for the “old” long range owners and it’ll change back"
That would be quite a range increase due to tweaking firmware in motors and inverters. Would be really hard to believe.
I took delivery in mid September and mine also says 4.2 to 3.7. Wonder if we got lucky.
It's gotta be the wheels or something because the performance didn't get the same bump
heat pump has no effect on epa.
road noise?
Same here. Battery day improvements were just too good to not wait for. 2 years isn't that long for super high life and super range batteries.
"Sure, where and when?"
"Because you'll always be waiting and you'll miss out on years of enjoying the car. There will always be improvements in the future, including improvements far more substantial than these."
Go away you troll
It did. It was 299 miles before.
No.
Canadian Model 3 page shows 568Km of range: [https://www.tesla.com/en\_ca/model3](https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/model3)
"Will these ranges increase in current models when you update to the latest software? I know I’ve had a few mileage boosts with that in the past, but I don’t think it was anything this big."
"Some people are reporting getting emails that their order has been updated.  If you get that email then you know you are matched to a 2021 VIN.  If not, I'd call my sales rep and ask for it.  I'd probably give it a day or two to give them time to catch up first though."
My sales rep called to confirm the changes on the update on my order. Delivery will be late December.
"Yeah I just noticed that, amazing."
sauce?
"Their were software and bearing improvements earlier, and I don't think they were added to the model X stats.  They probably have been in production for months though."
"Given how Tesla has been in the past, prices will drop when competition gets close."
I frequently pull into super chargers with 1-2 miles of range haha
"Better practice is to switch display to percent and begin thinking in location based on percentage of trip. 

Ik my commute is 40% round trip based on my driving habits. Healthier mind game than worrying about the fact that is 120 ‘miles’ of battery on an actual 100 mile round trip."
"Yeah I mean it’d be pretty insane if they were already mass producing roadrunner cells a week after battery day, I don’t think it’s possible otherwise they would have said something. Also the range increase would have been a lot more than just 10-30 miles."
Ugh I just checked and my LR RWD is 292 at 100% I really wish I had 385 haha
"Not similar, but I'd expect a small increase from software."
"That wouldn't make any sense though, based on the way that the EPA estimates range.  They test at room temperature only, so running the heater or AC do not factor in to EPA range estimates."
"AFAIK the heat pump wouldn't factor into the quoted range because the quoted range is based on the EPA test specs, which don't include using cabin temperature controls.

It'll factor into actual range because people do use cabin temperature controls in the real world. Or at least that's my understanding of it."
I thought if you return a Tesla then you couldn’t buy one for a year.
"True, but you can’t reorder the same configuration. Would just need to have someone else be the main owner on the account (ie. spouse)"
"If you return, you are blocked from re-ordering the same model."
This post unfortunately didn't age well :/

Not anymore
If your going to wait that long you'll probably be getting the benefit of the new batteries too. People keep saying they are about 3 years out before they are the norm.
"I wonder if these are backwards compatible, I do like the look a lot more than the original aeros."
I just added power trunk to my 2018 model and am in the process of chrome deleting my 3. Before all these were announced.
[removed]
"Also, the charge port has defrost and the sentry mode storage device can be locked in the glove box."
Damnit all. I just got my car and I don't have these :/
Heatpump as well
Man I hope those become available as a retrofit upgrade at some point...
So crazy that these almost standard budget-car features are only being introduced to a vehicle of this price range just now!
4.2 0-60!
Fuck. That’s what I really want :(
"yep, those actually appeared in September Model 3s too"
Were they ever gone? My Model 3 from November 2019 has them.
That's one thing I wish I had. Got my 3 in March. I've never had a car with dimming side mirrors.
Finally! Felt so silly to have to downgrade to but a new car
"I honestly don't see the point, the borders of the side mirrors are, well, also mirrors. So even if the side mirror dims, the edges don't, and the edges still reflect light right into your eyes at full strength.

That's one of the design choices I never understood about my Model 3."
It didn’t have that standard prior?
"It's chrome addition + chrome delete, optimized away at the factory by the compiler."
The Model 3 has chrome trim tho?
it’s a common term
It’s where they put all the chrome they removed from the outside of the car.
Ha! I meant new wheels!
"All brands do this. They make small improvements to their models over time, although they don't announce it."
Mine is 369 days old. I still wish that this was a software update.
Mine is July 2018 and I’m glad I got an old one
Tell me next time you’re planning on buying one and I’ll be sure to wait a few months.
"Can we set up some sort of alert system for when you buy a car?  I can hook it up, you just ping the automated system and everyone subscribed is notified.  That way, we don't buy before you do.  We could also time stock purchases based on your automotive expenditures. =>8-D"
"I think you can send it back within 7 days, but you can’t order that same trim for a year 

So if you return a standard 3, you would either need a relative to buy it or have to get a performance model"
"True, but you had federal incentives!"
Neato. I wonder if there’s actual battery capacity increase in these models or if that range increase comes from something like the heat pump. Does the heat pump have this kind of effect on EPA ratings?
"Interestingly, 5% of 250 is 263 rounded up. If the entire range increase is due only to the 5% energy density for the new Panasonic batteries then the SR+ might not have gotten the octovalve and heat pump that the other 3’s got."
Happy cake day!
"Not sure what you're referring to here. The image does say ""(EPA Est.)"""
"Range means nothing?  Sure then buy the Honda EV with 150 miles.

Also, Tesla’s official EPA results always match or exceed estimates."
Aren't all EPA range test done internally?
"Lmfao, i get 239 miles and i got a 2020 model, smh"
"I only get 216 on a 2019 SR+ 

I’m convinced they software locked me to a non plus version (I’ve seen the internal tech note regarding this occurrence and my car was manufactured in the time frame they noted) - but I also saw the setting was set as it should be. 

I drive like a grandma in good weather. My 15k miles have averaged exactly 200Wh/mi (on the screen data)

I knew they’d update stuff, but damn I didn’t know how much I’d want.  I’m guessing they’ve addressed many of the rattles with their interior refresh too."
Would I still have to wait 5-9 weeks cuz these aren’t in inventory?
And is there an software update to increase the range
https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/jcf37r/tesla_cancels_its_ballsy_no_questions_asked_7day/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
"True, so I’ll just have a different sign in but the car can still be under my name?"
Called Tesla said mine was manufactured 9/20 so I have everything in the new ones except power trunk and chrome delete. Reason for the 13 more miles in increase is because the new cant soften the regenerative breaking.
Is there a comparison pic floating around?
"If I didn’t order the all black Orbital covers, I’d be looking these to replace my covers on my early 2020."
Also appears to have the Y's chrome delete.
"Yea, same. But still... damnit."
"18 months about 23k miles here, and I kind of want to.  I'm waiting to see what the Cybertruck ends up being like/looking like in final form, but jumping from a Dual Motor + Acceleration Boost is looking really tempting."
How did it only cost £80?!
Wrapped my own for $10. 🤷‍♂️ 🤣
"No but if you’re like me and work from home and can afford to wait, then it’ll pay dividends like this"
"Same, but I also like more range and heat pumps....

My 15 month old 3 has already degraded to 280 miles :/"
"I've been looking at used cars (not a Tesla, can't do electric in my current rental house), and it's like this with every brand. I'm literally looking at cars going ""hmmm, the 2016 has improved fuel efficiency due to the new transmission over the 2015, the 2017 has the superior upgraded Bluetooth and a slightly more reliable transmission over the buggy 2016 version, the 2018 is a very mature design... but the 2019 model is the redesign, and has emergency braking and TACC included in the version I want, while the 2020 model fixes most of the odd issues introduced in the 2019 redesign...""

It's infuriating because there is no right answer, only tradeoffs."
"Good perspective. Awesome cars, abusive company.."
"That doesn’t matter to me. I mainly would like the additional mileage. The glass upgrade would be nice too, but the cabin is already pretty quiet"
"I think the majority of that range increase is the new Panasonic battery chemistry. They were claiming a 5% energy density increase, which would equate to ~16 miles, all on its own. The rest is probably octovalve, heat pump, and other efficiencies that they've been able to engineer."
"Mm, even though there may be hardware changes, not sure if the heat pump is what's driving the range change this much. It makes your car go from like 200 miles to maybe 250 or 300 on a cold day, not make it go 350 on a regular day (just as an example). Heat pump should theoretically increase the bottom range floor, not increase the upper limit.  I don't know. Either way, I don't understand, and I'm still excited. Whatever Elon has cooking, this is sure to ruin the mood of all the other automakers. He's really lapping them all!"
But in that case shouldn’t it say 4.4 to 3.7?
The Tesla app now says 3.7s for my model 3
"Here are some before/after pics from Canada. I wonder if we’re getting a free 0.2s upgrade?

https://imgur.com/gallery/0UaVcEN"
"Mine is a 2018 LR Dual. The app now says 4.2s to 3.7s. It used to say 4.4s to 3.9s last time I checked. 

So maybe we all got .2s boost...?"
probably that is the most important info - thanks for sharing.. poor BMWs...
I really hope this is the case!  There are a few documented cases of them hitting 0-60 in 3.6s but this would make it much more achievable consistently.
Same for me. I’d assume that means we all get a minor speed bump OTA soon
"I would assume it does. My M3 from late last year has also regularly gotten sub 220wh/m efficiency that would equal 350 miles, so I assume it's mostly just they got around to updating the official numbers."
Do you have the acceleration boost upgrade?
"> decreased

meaning it's faster .. not the phrasing I would have used :D"
"True that. As tempting as it is, it doesn't make financial sense. My car is still a blast to drive.  Its just so damn tempting lol."
Have they indicated that these types of components can be upgraded in the future? I’d hate for battery degradation to eventually render the car somewhat useless for the older models.
"That's how I wound up with my 2080 TI less than a year before the 3090s came out. Boy am I glad to have updated when I did! 😭

(ofc it maxes out my monitor anyway so I don't really care)"
Buy my 3080......that I can't find anywhere except on eBay for over 9000 - _-
Inductive charging will be the big thing worth waiting for. In 20 years there will be pads everywhere.
True or my unlimited connectivity either.
"This is a good point.  I think with ev's, leasing is probably more beneficial since updates like this are more substantial than with normal ice cars and like you said, you'd always have the updated version"
You choose to charge to 160. Im saying mine displays 280 at 100% soc. I'm not choosing it...its all it can give me at maximum. Brand new I could charge to 306 max.
Pirelli is a big step down from the amazing Michelins :(
Those were the best hands down.
"Track pack wheels and tires are awesome.  I wish there was an option to upgrade to those for a price when you order the car rather than pay the full $5,500 to purchase them separately."
Let's hope!
I'd bet that they are more aerodynamic and were changed to help get the longer range.
This was definitely rumored a few weeks ago
My main hope is that in the next few years the battery technology will be even better and cheaper to make (which would hopefully lead to the vehicles seeing price reductions). They can only increase battery range so much through software updates right? I’m also not really in dire need of a new vehicle so it makes sense for me to wait for now.
Holy shit degradation is that bad? So if I get the sr+ then I’m my range will be less than 200 in a couple years??
"It doesn’t. Model 3 didn’t have them until about a month ago either, though it had them in the past. They were gone for awhile."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ifti3m/model_y_updated_tail_light_comparison/

This is speculation, but as the Model Y is now using them, I would think that at some point the Model 3 will as well; this is the perfect time to do the changeover."
You sure?
"So if my VIN is a 2021, it automatically mean the car will have these changes/heatpump? I live in Quebec where winters are harsh so it sounds like a nice improvement!"
For all the tech that’s in their cars they still lack interior and exterior photos 😢
"Larger batteries suffer from this issue less though. The more the car relies on efficiency, the more that inefficient (fast) driving hurts it. 

So for example, a big model S with a 100kw battery takes less of a per-mile range hit when you use the AC than a model 3 SR does. Ironically, being less efficient in the first place gives the S an advantage there. 

For this reason, every time a range increase comes out, it’s a valid question to ask: was it due to efficiency, or battery capacity? Both are good, but the latter is better."
Speed limits between Idaho and Utah are 80mph. My experience is only getting ~200 miles as well
"There are places in Texas where the posted speed limit is 85 mph
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_Highway_130

Also many highways are 75.  85 isn't that unreasonable in a 75."
"I lost my data before HW3, but I'm at 5029 miles on HW3 in my LR RWD 3 and I average 296 wh/m. Driving back from Big Bend today I'm averaging 311 wh/m driving around 80-85mph. I also have cross climate's which are a little less efficient than the MXM4's."
Please share your findings!
What’s the verdict?
"Yea this.  I would reject if you can wait whatever time it's going to take to get a new one. That .1 sec faster 0-60, new rims, and more range (potentially heat pump?) Would be worth the wait for me."
refund what difference? the price didn't change
Someone over at r/teslainvestorsclub has a June 2019 and their app also says 4.2 to 3.7 so I’m assuming now that it was just a change across the board. Maybe the speed will increase for everyone and the range is just these new models.
If you don't need a car right away you can absolutely wait until point where Tesla either updates or drops the Price. They seem to do one of those 2 things about once a year.
"I get that, but waiting one quarter for a major update line this is much different that holding out years for a different USB port or something."
Was that with a SR+ or LR?
"I've had same happen with Ice cars but the difference is they don't usually hide the coming changes, and you often get big discounts on previous model years. I bought my car 3 weeks ago and if I knew changes were coming I would have waited, like many others.

If only one of these changes came, I would not have been annoyed... But that is a lot of improvement. 

If these charges came next spring I wouldn't feel so cheated. I basically paid the exact same price for a less advanced car.

Certainly hurt my perception of Tesla and I won't hide this opinion with others... They protected their stock over their customers. Interesting choice. 

I like my car, but after spending $60k, it sucks being even a bit unhappy."
"It doesn't, because I literally bought a chrome delete kit 2 days ago"
"There were a whole lot of clues. I've only been around here since July and it seemed imminent to me, but people who have been following Tesla much longer than me convinced me otherwise."
Hey at least it’s way more accurate than the NEDC range we use here in Australia (Not Even Damn Close).
"That's true, not arguing here. However, I think the EPA standard should be reviewed and updated somehow. The EPA rating is usually showing 30-35% more range than it is available 😔

I'd like to see some stress tests at around... let say, 85mph and 50F'"
"Because it all depends on your driving style and speed, and there's no simple way to boil that complex equation down into one number that the general public understands, so they had to concoct a standardized test procedure.  I agree the speeds they test at are no longer realistic (the highway test tops out at 60 mph and only briefly).  The standardized test data is still useful ([mostly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYMRXlRoHyQ)) for comparing one model of car to another, and if you want a super accurate mileage gauge use the trip consumption graph which takes your current driving and power draw into account.  

I've [measured](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/iws58g/model_3_factfinding_an_endtoend_efficiency/g628al1/) my efficiency though and can and do achieve ""rated range"" on highway driving at 105 km/h in warm weather with properly inflated tires and no HVAC.  Stop and go city jaunts are even more efficient than rated range thanks to regen and lower overall speed."
"Ah, I meant that I'll hold onto my car for 10 years.  I think you are right, though, that once the Terra factory goes up we are likely to see 400+ mile range model 3s."
"Is that why people don’t like it? It has a dated vibe? I’m trying to figure out why people like the chrome delete. I am trying to psych myself into liking the new look, but right now it feels like a deal breaker. And I was just seven months away from being able to get one"
"To make that base 26k car usable people will have to buy 4-8k worth of addons. Do you see my point now, or do I have to list all the reasons why Tesla makes a better EV?"
"All y'all arguing about the model 3 being ""too big"" and I'm over here waiting for my Cybertruck 🤣🤣"
I dunno id 3 is pretty big on the outside.
Where do you live? Because I pay €800 a year for insurance on mine.
"Yeah that's not normal some german insurance company's have completly missed the ship on EV. They do not cover anything EV related and use ICe metrics for your payments.
But there are some who esp target EV drivers and they are 800-1000€ for new drivers etc. They also cover stuff like overcharges etc. Don't buy a normal car insurance"
Same her 800 Euro for a year in Norway.
No not yet
"Interesting. 8 weeks would put me around December December 15th, and I was told by my advisor that they guaranteed the car would show up before the end of the year. But for all I know that was him just saying that eight weeks is still 2020. I don't know if there's actually some sort of guarantee. I'm so used to Amazon tracking and what not that I really wish there was some option to see where my car was in transit or if it was still being made. At this point I just want it to have no defects, be a 2021 Vin, and if there are any hardware changes for the extra 10 miles then I want those.

I'm super excited though. It's basically all I've been thinking about since we went for the test drive on Tuesday."
"The model y also got a range booster though. Which is why I'm assuming that they either optimized the software in which case they would come with it regardless or it's a hardware change in which case I probably still want it.

It's not much but considering that this is a car I want to have for like at least 10 years. That 3% range boost that the model y got, if it is Hardware would be nice."
Although who knows the range boost on the model 3 might have just been because they retested the model y when they tested the new model 3 and they noticed that due to previous software updates it had gotten more efficient.
"I heard battery efficiency is mostly controlled via software these days especially in stuff like our phones and such.

Plus the model 3 got more range from a software update last year no?"
Lmfao look at update 40.7 yeah you go download some ram
This!!  Why do we not have a silver metallic..  Some new colors would be great.  I still see some Silver Model 3's driving around and they look fantastic!!
Model S is a great vehicle but big. Hoping the projections we heard at battery day come to fruition and the additional density of the tabless cells make a reasonably priced 400+ mile Model 3 possible.
For you maybe
"I think you’ll find I do what I want! In this case, as you asked!"
"I guess. Sorry it was more letting off some frustration because I never remember what’s the conversion 🙂 anyway, it’s not a big deal, I guess"
Mine must not work then.
"Thanks, figured that would be the case, FUCK"
We will get through this very hard time together. At least we've got each other
"Oh I know, I'm still loving my car"
Right. No clue what to do.
Yes the Tri-motor one says over 500+ miles but I'm in the market for the base Cybertruck advertised at 250+...Hopefully the + is HUGE!
It will indeed be interesting to see how close these new ranges are to the real world.
Damn that’s expensive. Rather get a taco :)
True it is a different body. You’re probably right that this is why.
gotcha thank you friend
"Thanks, if last years Q4 is any indication, would you think I’d receive delivery by December 31st? On the site it currently says 5-9 weeks, but any delays would put it into next year, meaning I wouldn’t qualify for my province’s EV incentive, which is pretty substantial"
Basically uniform all around with no stitching at 10 and 2 o’clock. It’s on the website under the Model 3 section but not pictured in design studio yet.
Yes. You are correct. However IMHO to accommodate for the range loss in winter etc I really think ideal is 450 miles. For every day commute use what we have now is totally adequate.
">lifetime Wh/m

Of course - mine is 270. I'm a very conservative driver."
nope its different batteries.
Pretty sure heater use is taken into consideration in the formula.
"The early edition Tesla's (and pretty sure still) have a lot of wind noise. I posted at length in the past. Essentially there's a wind tunnel forming between the mirrors and the windows which I believed was causing the issue.

Suspect I was right because they are now using double panned glass aparently to reduce it"
"All Teslas, especially the model 3 and y are very noisy at higher speeds.
Basicly my model S is okay up until 120km/h then I need loud music. At 150km/h even music isnt enough. And the model 3 is way worse :/"
"""Consumer Reports, which has a complicated relationship with Tesla, says it can no longer recommend the Model 3 because issues with the paint, trim and body hardware raises reliability questions. CR members reported the results in an annual reliability survey that includes data on about 470,000 vehicles""

I was mostly right actually."
"Well, yeah, that is not surprising. 353 miles = 568km, it is under same cycle, up from 518 km or so. So 50km increase under a more strict cycle than WLTP. Range in Europe went from 560 to 580, so only 20km increase?"
"Fuck, bought 9 months too early"
"No. These are hardware changes. You cannot download better cells or heat pump, unlike say, RAM."
"Current Y yes. Current 3 no.
The reason being Y has a heat pump, old 3s did not."
Tesla battery day
Yeah it’s not hvac range. I’ve turned off everything and gotten exactly epa on long trips
"Yeah, as the other commented mentioned, the HVAC system isn't just about the cabin temp. It's also tied into the battery cooling and heating. So making that more efficient means the battery warmer has to spend a lot less power during the winter, which increases range."
"But the results from the EPA 2-cycle test get multiplied by a fixed value to account for cold weather performance and other factors. By default this is 0.7 aka 70%. 

However a manufacturer can do additional testing cycles and present additional data to the EPA showing that their multiplier should be better than 0.7. Tesla already does this, and having the heat pump likely lets them adjust this multiplier even higher. 

This is also why some EVs get much worse EPA scores than EU WLTP scores (ie the Taycan), because they took the default multiplier instead of doing additional tests. 

So in the end this increases the overall range rating even if the improvement wouldn’t be noticeable in warm weather."
"It probably has an effect on the battery heating/cooling as well, in fact I’d wager that this is where much of the gain is coming from."
"Use of HVAC is an optional test a manufacturer can elect to run.

[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/FTP-75#:\~:text=The%20EPA%20Federal%20Test%20Procedure,and%20heavy%2Dduty%20vehicles](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/FTP-75#:~:text=The%20EPA%20Federal%20Test%20Procedure,and%20heavy%2Dduty%20vehicles))."
They increased traction battery to 82 KWH
You can’t buy that specific trim for a year.
"So if I have a M3 SR+ that’s currently on order, will it be this new updated version? Expecting delivery in 2-6 weeks.."
"Or return it, and use relatives name to buy one.

If you don't plan on reselling or ownership transfer anytime soon"
Different color?
"Well if bought before the change, he’d be one of the last ones to use it."
How’d you do the power trunk?  Really wish I had one on my 3
The website doesn’t say it. It mentions heated seats but not steering wheel (yet)
That’s still in R&D according to leaks. But Panasonic had long announced the new battery density
"All these manufacturers add heated seats, steering wheels etc...But I just want air conditioned seats!!! Or at the very least offer a cloth option instead of fake leather."
"apparently did not make it this time around. 

the rumor said its scheduled for december though so might see it this year"
"Haven't seen this anywhere

Edit: Confirmed in my chat session with Tesla that there's no heated wheel in this set of updates. :("
"That's my #1, 2, and 3 wish. I'm holding out until then."
I know this was rumored but actually confirmed anywhere?
Both of those are coming with the latest software update to existing cars.
Don't worry. You already have the best car in the world. These are very minor changes in the scheme of things. Enjoy the new ride!
"Same

I really want the auto trunk because I have 2 very badly injured shoulders and I’d rather get an OEM tesla Install vs aftermarket"
Yea it’s insane my 74k car (2 years ago) didn’t have these basic features
"Heat pump & Octovalve is probably a factor in the big range increase - plus higher energy density cells. Also explains the acceleration increase on the Performance and on the AWD Long Range.

Plus winter range is going to be like a dream."
"Can confirm, they are in my m3p from september. :)"
yeah just took deliver 10ish days ago and I have it on mine -\_-
Yeah they stopped including them back around March 2020.
"Yep, I didn't find out until about a week after delivery. Was pissed."
"They actually suck if you have the windows tinted, and there’s no way to disable them short of unplugging."
"It did, but they removed them around March 2020. Now they’re back again."
I am hoping we can soon buy these black trims and replace the chrome trims.  That should be much easier than wrapping.
"Doesn't look like it to me.

https://www.tesla.com/model3"
Doesn't make it right.
"Yes and others generally save them up for the next model year so you can more or less plan accordingly as a buyer whereas Tesla just generally does it constantly, regardless if it’s big (new AP hardware) or small (better heat pump housing) with 0 notice. Heck, imagine if you recently ordered a 3P and you show up for pick up and you see different wheels, center console, etc."
Right? That trunk motor is already there just needs to be unlocked /s
Why is that?
"To be fair, the 2014 one was one of the first into the UK and a LLLLOOOONNNGGG wait. 

2016 was at a pretty healthy discount and AP2 was a backward step at the start.   In fact, it's only after a few months of Model 3 ownership that speed signs are now read."
"Yes it does.  Cold weather driving is one of the major testing factors of the EPA.  Other major testing points include city driving, highway driving, air condition, fast acceleration and high speed."
As a Canadian this is huge.  Now I actually kind of regret purchasing mine last year...
Increased battery capacity must be involved for this kind of bump. Heat pump and other system tweaks alone wouldn't give this kind of bump.
Yes there are real increases because Panasonic already announced this months ago lol
"Tesla doesn’t like to have multiple configurations like this.

My guess would be the new SR+ has fewer cells than it did before. This offsets some of the range increase and increases margins. 

In fact I would have expected the SR+ to not change range at all, but I guess they decided to give it a little boost. 

Does anyone have a comparison of the old weight to the new weight for both SR+ and LR?"
It probably did but those things don’t improve epa range since it’s never tested in cold weather for epa. Heat pump will show biggest power savings when it’s 40-50F outside. But that’s a real world improvement not an epa
"I should have specified. SR+ says ""Est""

[https://imgur.com/a/8ivXIlW](https://imgur.com/a/8ivXIlW)"
"Find me 10,000 Performance owners that get their exact specified range or more.

And no, range doesn't mean anything. It's just a marketing technique. Your range will go up or down depending on a variety of factors. Rain, headwind, temperature, tire pressure, weight in car, tail wind, elevation, etc. 

It's the same for ICE cars. MPG doesn't mean anything because those same factors affect ICE cars. There's just a gas station every mile so no one looks at those things like they do charging. 

I have an SR+ and I never get the 240, let alone 250 or now 260 miles they're claiming. Don't kid yourself, dude. This is the same for every car. This isn't a unique Tesla problem."
"Changes a bit depending on how you drive and the climate. Also, depending on how long you let it sit with sentry mode on, etc."
2019 SR+ - 236 when new 1 year later I sold it and I was at 220 which in reality was 198 for a 90% charge and if I drove ti till it was at 10% remaining my actual range was roughly 175 miles.
What are you complaining about? Not everyone gets EPA rated efficiency in their cars.
"No, this sounds right for a 2019 SR+.

My 2019 SR+ currently maxes out at 220 miles at 100%. The 2019 SR+ was EPA advertised as 240 miles range, so 220/240 is 8.3% loss. However, keep in mind that the 100% range shown in your car today is only a representation your car's built-in Battery Management System (BMS) estimate of range based on it's estimate of the health of each of the battery cells in your car's battery pack.

There are ways to fully cycle your battery from \~90% to \~10% and the BMS will re-calibrate and give a more accurate estimate. But, you really just don't need to worry about all this.

Just enjoy the car and the BMS will continue to do it's best to estimate range. Drive conservatively (<70 mi/hr) when going long distances and you and your car's BMS will find you have quite a bit more range in your battery than estimated.

Cheers"
You'd have to wait a year if you return a car.
"You'd probably have to wait until around the end of the quarter, yes. Which is one reason that it's not a great idea. :)"
"if you're in the US, probably"
"I personally doubt it. This range boost is likely all from hardware changes to the drivetrain and temperature control systems. 5% range from the new Panasonic battery chemistry, another chunk from the Octovalve/heat pump, and perhaps other minor efficiency boosts."
"I said that mere hours before Tesla canceled their return policy, lol."
Yes. You can even change the email address later if needed but not to your original account email.

When will you get those.  They look like they would be awesome.
It's a pretty small area?
"Well yeah, you can also do that if you have a small amount of patience 😂"
"I work from home too. If I waited, I wouldn't have had my S for 3 years, and since switched to a Model 3 😂"
How?? What are your charging habits like?
"For sure. The main frustration is that there’s never a line in the sand date of what/when/where changes are being deployed. Should you wait? If I do, will I even get the changes? Etc."
"You guys all think it's some heatpump, battery or drivetrain change and I'm here thinking it must be the red multicoat paint."
"Incorrect 
1) Electrek’s sources state range increase is from an efficiency package.
2) Model Y’s range was upgraded from 28X miles at the reveal to 30X miles at launch due to heat pump."
"The Y also got a minor range bump, but it always had a heat pump."
Correct. When I shut climate off completely my consumption doesn't change a terrible amount when it's 65* outside
Elon did mention that they had to add the name Long Range Plus to the name because of some regulation since the battery was different.  However on these cars the name are still the same.
"My interpretation is it’s either a static description and it should say 4.4s to 3.9s or 4.4s to 3.7s for older models, or we’re going to get an OTA update so all LR can do 0-60 in 4.2s."
Attn: u/wugz
"I hope so! It would be what, the 3rd or 4th free speed boost update since Model 3 launched?"
Yes
They do.
Well the 0-60 time did decrease - I think that's totally accurate to say.
"Oh, duh. I should have actually gone and looked, to make sure I knew what he was saying."
Wait two (or three I guess) more years for the real new batteries to come out and buy yourself a 400+ range Model 3 that can charge even faster than it does now.
I just checked mine. If I sell privately I can do it for less then 6k which I would do. But through Tesla it's 13k
Battery modules on the 3 can be replaced.
Well in the future it won't since the battery will be the link between front and back frame.
"I doubt it. Wireless charging is just too inefficient when you're talking about this much power.

What we're likely to see is automatic plugs. (Though personally I think simple ones that the car aligns with are more likely then the snake charger)"
Ditto and ditto
"Oh, I see. Apologies for the misunderstanding. That's fair, then."
Yeah it would be nice to not buy two sets of wheels
I’d still appreciate the choice
With the amount of people involved in making this happen I don’t think they’ll ever be able to truly keep stuff like this a secret up until the day it happens
"Eh, I think he’s comparing an older performance to a newer long range, that’s about 70km of the difference with this new boost in play. I’ve had about 25km of degradation on my LR over two years of pretty heavy driving. And from graphs I’ve seen, you get most of the drop early on then it flattens out which matches my experience it’s been holding steady lately, so I’m not too worried.

But getting a longer range is always nice... faster per mile charging, more flexible road trips, more headroom for degradation or adding a roof rack. If you can swing it, you’ll appreciate it."
no not that bad. you get around 5% after a year. but the new 3 has more range of course!
"Makes sense, thanks for sharing"
"Yup more than likely, you can always ask once you have the VIN assigned to confirm it's the refreshed model. I guess technically we haven't received confirmation that the heat pump is actually in there, but i think safe to assume."
I'm not sure what you mean?
"Yeah. I am on the last leg of my big bend trip and I just assume 1.5 miles of range per mile driven on the highway for my ballpark estimate. 

Right now I am at 443.7 miles driven today at 311 wh/m in my LR RWD 3. 85 on Texas highways is normal, but I did get a warning for no front license earlier in a small town. My lifetime average after HW3 is 5029 miles at 296 wh/m. I think the cross climate's aren't as efficient as the mxm4's. All my previous day's was wiped before HW3, but no biggie. I used to deliver pizzas for my first job and I have never been a slow driver."
"Precisely. I was booking it for my Big Bend trip. From my house in Fort Worth to sweetwater is 195 miles and I skipped a charger. Right now I am in Terlingua after my trip since Fort Stockton to the chisos basin uses up over half the battery. Basecamp Terlingua just installed a Tesla destination charger, but it's for customers. They plan to add one at a cafe soon, but my friend does the electrical work so I have access."
"Consider teslamate on a raspberry pi, awesome data for nest to no cost."
"Lol good follow up. They have no official word on if any of the changes can be retrofitted. 

Im 99% sure the glass will be able to be so it's very odd they can't confirm any."
Honestly the new interior is the only thing that makes it a good deal.
"sorry i forgot to mention im in Australia, priced dropped from 109k to 101k."
Exactly.
"Mines Aug 2018 so yeah probably across the board. 

God I wish I could have that new range. Mine has already degrades to 280. Makes commuting such a pain some days. Luckily no commutes right now haha."
The speed was already 4.2s if not faster in real life due to the several power increases via software.
Next year they are putting the headphone jack back in.
It's the awd lr
"To be fair, most of the ""whether to hold off buying until X"" questions and answers I've seen here are related to Battery Day and speculation of the announcement having any chance of short term impact on the current lineup, and the argument against waiting is quite sound for those giving that advice, and it's still mostly true as much of the improvements announced aren't present in this refresh. 

That said... it really was only a matter of time that the new updates in the Y are going to find their way back into the 3, because of the whole shared components/reduced complexity concept. Unfortunately, there's simply no way to accurately predict when such a big refresh is gonna happen unless you're an insider."
Same. Figured just one small change coming ( like heat pump)
"There's few if any roads in the US that are above 70 mph posted speed limit, I'll concede on the 50*F though."
"You can get the epa range if your traveling at 65 - 70 mph can’t you? I’ve never seen anyone say it’s 30% less

The videos I see on YouTube from people on the interstate seems like 5% - 10% less range than epa"
Good financial choice. But I’m sure it’s gonna be hard to stay on course with all the new changes coming ;) I used to say that but at year 6 the itch starts
"Sportier, modern-er. I love chrome delete."
"Bit of a dick comment.  We’re all Tesla fans here, but I can see why some people would prefer the ID3."
"4.69m vs 4.26m

43cm is A TON. Model 3 is mode than 10% longer than an ID.3
In Europe especially a Model 3 is a BIG car, while the ID.3 is way more easy to drive and park."
"But no frunk, less range and less cargo space for some reason"
"Neither did I. Ordered on oct.5th.

I think it's a good sign we didn't get Vins yet.

Chances are we will get the refresh. Fingers crossed!"
"My car was accidentally sent to Chicago and not NY so my car disappeared from the portal the day before I was going to pick it up.

My sales advisor found me a replacement car the same day and had it ready on time.  So I think they can pull one out of the air if needed, but you want to be careful that they don’t give you a 2020 if they are scrambling to make you happy before the end of the year."
Yeah but not this much.
agree. those silver model 3's look stunning. doesn't make sense. I mean they could charge more for it like they do for the red....
No I’m totally with you. The metric system is like a million times more intelligent. But I guess old habbits never change
It's not a great one tbh. If you have a little line going around the perimeter of the glass about 2 mm in then you most likely have it.
"

Honestly, I'm unsure how I feel about the look of the new aero wheels and I definitely like the interior we have more than the updated model.  
Now, if they could just figure out a heatpump retrofit I'd be perfectly content."
I think the SR has more range than our MRs now lol
"I'm hoping that too.  I live in an area that will require AWD/4WD, but a bump in range on the other models will always carry over."
"Canada? If so, the heat pump is probably worth it alone. Your call, but I would wait. I have no idea on delivery timeline. Do you have a vin?"
September builds actually already had no stitching at 10 and 2. But they didn't have the metal buttons.
"Oh I forgot to put mine in the first post. Mine is 239 with the 18” aeros on. 

Do you have the 19” sport wheels? Just curious where the difference might be coming from."
"The performance also got the bump apparently.

So most likely 5% battery improvement, more aerodynamic wheels, heat pump, and probably some other tweaks."
apparently if you dont accept default EPA modifier it does come into play as there is a cold weather test but I doubt the heatpump will have much effect.
Will be interesting to see back to back tests done with the newest builds and see if there is any real improvement over previous models.
"That is cosmetic stuff.  My 2019 is 18 months old. It has never been in for service. Nothing has ever broke.  Someday maybe, but at this point it is the most reliable car I have owned."
I guess it's good news either way :)
Should get Elon working on that 😂
...so you’ll be forced to get the M3P.  :-)
Why
"Check you assigned vin number. As I recall if the 10th digit is L, it is a 2020 model. If it is M, it is a 2021 model."
"The odds are very low that it is the older version.  Cali had like 30 of the old ones left in inventory as of now for the whole state.  If yours is coming in weeks, it is almost certainly not one of the existing ones."
"Did you order it in October or September? It'll be a 2021 for sure, if in October."
I know some places allow tax free transfer between immediate family.
"Nope. Also, as of today, they’ve removed all mentions of 7 day no hassle refund completely from their website."
[deleted]
It’s an increase because of a new efficiency package according to Electrek sources.  We also know the heat pump significantly bumped Model Y range.  So no it’s not new batteries.
"It's a heated steering wheel.

Just buy one from the competition and copy it."
Boggles my mind that the S and X don't have cooled seats available. You can get them in pretty basic cars nowadays.
"I’m with you... I need cooling on those leather seats, i sweat too much."
Can’t wait for that update to magically install a USB port in the glove box. I’m just going to route a usb cable to the glove box for my 2018.
So cool how these software updates can now conjure new hardware into existence on models that didn't have the hardware before. Tesla never ceases to amaze
30 miles is not minor
Is it confirmed that heat pump is now in model 3 or are we guessing?
Higher density cells from where?
What cells?
GF3 2170 cells have 5% more power density now.
Sounds like a COVID supply shortage
They dropped them earlier in the year.
Damn I was lucky to get them then... I took delivery in late March here in Ireland but production would have been early April.
I know how you feel. Got my car in August then I hear September cars have auto dimming.
Or maybe just recompile with the new config?
But they used to us what I’m saying. You’ve never seen one in person?
"100% Agree.  Received my model 3 less than a month ago and the collective updates here are pretty significant. Had I known they were also increasing range on the LR M3, I would've waited but now Im sitting with an outdated vehicle which I paid full price for.

To own a Tesla, you have to be willing to out up with the punishment I guess..."
[deleted]
"I like the chrome trim, old center console, the old USB ports, the old wheels, and the unlimited free super charging and data.  I wish I had the heat pump and new battery tech."
"Yeah, which means the highway range won't actually go up unless you're driving in certain conditions!

I'm done with EPA range."
"SC03 is a supplemental test. It's not mandatory.

[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/FTP-75#:\~:text=The%20EPA%20Federal%20Test%20Procedure,and%20heavy%2Dduty%20vehicles](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/FTP-75#:~:text=The%20EPA%20Federal%20Test%20Procedure,and%20heavy%2Dduty%20vehicles))."
Old SR+ was 3550lbs
"That's what I thought too. FWIW, my understanding is the heat pump will improve range well below 40F. There are studies from the Fiat 500e with and without a heat pump. With the heat pump, it saw a range improvement of 13% at 14F. I don't think we've seen details (especially A/B testing) of the Tesla system's performance, but expect the new Model 3 can be tested against the old one and someone (Tesla Bjorn??) will do that.

I expect it will be pretty useful down to 20F."
"Ah, good call."
You’re confusing range variance with range meaning nothing.
"This is a conversation I’ve had many times about my 40kWh Nissan Leaf. 

A 200km isn’t usable. 170km or so is really the limit because you always need to leave something in the ‘tank’ and are limited by where you can stop to charge. 

Currently tossing up an SR+ or LR and my wife is leaning very strongly to the LR for the extra range in that 80-20% general charge range."
Well damn lol. I emailed them to see if they could do anything.
Lol maybe I can email them and see what they say. Maybe some free miles
"What’s the consensus, should I just email them."
Oh ok that’s good to know
"Any idea when they are switching over to the new chemistry? I have a MY ordered with a 60xxx vin (2021), and it would be pretty awesome if it had the extra range!"
"Wow, what an upgrade 🤨"
I ordered them too. Supposedly next month...
Oh I thought you did the whole dash or something. Makes sense now. Got a pic?
"Charge to 80% on level 2 95% of the time, 90% on L2 3% of the time, and supercharge 2% of the time. Also in Texas, so no extreme climates. No clue how that happened."
"No no no, painting it red makes it *faster* not farther. What kind of Orc are you?!

:)"
Put a VTEC sticker on we could get 50miles more range and 50kw more power on the electric motor lol
WEEZ MAKING IT ORKY!
I’m hoping that the new range will apply to the 60xxx vins (2021 model year)!
They're a new model year so they can make whatever changes they want.
"The OG AWDs with the 980 rear motor are still capable of outputting P3D-levels of performance when hacked, and the front motor also has headroom compared to P3D, so they probably could tune them to match the new & improved AWD's performance (if not efficiency).  I don't expect Tesla to do that, since the newer 990 motors have lower current limits and (unless they were sandbagging) that could create a perceived disparity where both the oldest and newest AWD cars go faster than the rest, but on the other hand their marketing team presumably just overwrote the description of the Acceleration Boost update that appears even for older cars, so maybe now they'll have an obligation to make it happen for all AWDs?

/u/WarrenYu if that's your app, what model year is your car that you saw the change?"
Yup or even a cybertruck
Nice any idea what that’s priced at?
Do you have evidence for that? My understanding is the losses are surprisingly small. But I would be happy to be shown that I am wrong.
No worries.  I probably could have explained it better.
Agreed. Just does not look good.  The grey color on the outgoing rims looked fantastic too.
"exactly what you said. i got 25km degradation but the new car had 75km more on top.

most model 3s seem to get av average of 5% rangeloss within a year followed by another 5% over the next 5 to 10 years"
When you go to other car manufacturers there’s a gallery where you can see interior and exterior shots of the vehicle and most times a 360 camera. Tesla photos are limited.
"I can’t believe that a trunk wouldn’t be able to as well.  IIRC, before any news of a refresh broke, Elon mentioned a m3 power trunk install."
Really?  You think so?  Such a minor change IMHO compared to the range/speed increases.
">sorry i forgot to mention im in Australia, priced dropped from 109k to 101k."
Definitely across the board. I got my M3 in July 2019 and the performance boost is updated to the new values.
"OMG, I'LL WAIT"
"My problem is that everyone said the model 3 won't see any notable changes until after S/X, which could be years. These changes are pretty notable. Not groundbreaking, but certainly something I was willing to wait another 2 months for."
Ever been to Texas?  Plenty of 85mph speed limits on divided highways.
Lot's of 80mph roads in South Dakota.  Just drove to Rapid City.  80mph speed limit most of the way.
"I wouldn’t say that: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:US_Speed_Limits.svg

Anywhere in green has higher posted limits. Mostly in the west but not always. Michigan’s highways are 75 mph outside of urban areas for instance (not just one or two - most of them)."
"Yes, but we're talking about the real world usage. A very little percentage of people travel at 70mph and 25C'. And the speed and temperature are the most significant factors for EVs.

Would be great to see a minimum range (stress tested) + EPA. It would be more useful than just EPA that's being used mostly for advertisement"
I'm really curious to see if I can do a battery replacement in the future.
"Yeah model 3 is longer but right about the same width. Width is what really matters in EU. The parking spaces tend to be long enough, but not that wide. Same with the roads.

Yes the model 3 is longer but it's only 10%, ID3 is still a fairly big car, which was my point."
"Yeah, I mean the 30 to 40 cm difference in length is probably why there is no frunk."
"Early quarter shipments usually go overseas first, so if you're in the US, you're almost for sure getting the updated model."
At this point I won’t accept anything less lol
That's kind of my biggest worry. I'll need to make sure but I'm pretty sure if the VIN letter thing is the letter M then it's a 2021. I forget off the top of my head now but I'm definitely going to make sure.
"Yeah I have that border, but I always had to scrape the snow off even after letting it heat for a while.  Oh well.  I live in Florida now, so I don’t need to worry about it."
"That's really all I care about haha, I could live with not having all the other changes"
You got that right. My Model 3 lost the 10% so ya... More range then me hahaha
"yeah Montreal, Canada. I'm supposed to take delivery tomorrow but a tesla rep just called me and I need to decide in the next hour if I stick with the 2020 model and get a 1500 rebate (although it would be half that since I'd chrome delete it), or just change my order for a 2021 model where delivery is at 5-9 weeks. But anything longer than 10 and I lose an 8000 dollar incentive."
Really? How do you know? There is not much online about it. Hoping this new design is an improved version with heating potential via software update.
"Nope, have the standard wheels with the aero covers on at all times. Tesla says they've remotely checked my battery and find no faults. But facts are facts."
Ok but your car is one car. Obviously for them to make a strong statement like that there are issues. And fir the price i would not want to have and of those issues be somewhat regular things.
I see this as an absolute win.
Seems like a win win in my book
Okay awesome. How do I check my VIN number that’s been assigned? I can only see my order number at the moment.
LoL good one.
Thanks Nikola.
Their new cell size allows for better power density. I've heard 10-15%. So that's about 30-50 miles extra range. The heat pump is also awesome and will allow for better track performance as well :)
"No! We must design the heating element from first principles, and make it in a vertically integrated way, from mining the material upwards!"
The S has one too.
Yep!
"They used to, and they weren't great."
"Mmmm, the smell of fried ass."
"Exactly! I live in the Southwest, I don't need heated seats."
"Pin lock for glovebox definitely makes sense.

I was surprised about the charge port defrosting. They prob just figured out how to use the circuits/sensors there in a novel way."
"My neighbour here in Ottawa, Ontario received his model 3 about 2 weeks ago and it had a heat pump in it."
"Guessing. But it's a good bet. 

Model 3 started to receive smaller Model Y style frunk needed for heat pump/ocatavalve a little while ago. And while a portion of today's range boost is likely due to batteries (Model Y got a range boost as well), Model 3 got a much larger range boost. So it's likely much more than just the updated battery chemistry that's driving the range increase."
wtf is a heat pump
Confirmed (work there)
"Confirmed, heat pump and octoclave system. Articles everywhere. Also heated wheel confirmed."
Confirmed! [https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/jcc80e/model\_3\_heat\_pump\_confirmed\_in\_refresh/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/jcc80e/model_3_heat_pump_confirmed_in_refresh/)
https://electrek.co/2020/07/30/tesla-batteries-energy-density-increase-panasonic/
Nevada Gigafactory.   Chemistry improvement.
"They actually changed the harness, so it was a deliberate design change."
"Well what actually bugs me about this is: it's not a new fearture.

All model 3s had it at launch and for like the first 2.5 years and then they removed them randomly for ~6-9 months and now they are back?

And Tesla is not very forthcoming on what's even in the vehicle anyway...whereas other automakers show you features pretty upfront. Tesla seems to hide it.

IDK, I don't like it. Feels sktechy and cheap."
What?
"not the ones being produced though.   So the new ones dont have chrome deleted, they just don't have chrome."
"They are now made without the chrome trim in the first place though. He’s not saying the Model 3 car has never had a version with chrome trim. He’s saying the current Model 3 does not have chrome trim, meaning you can’t delete what isn’t there."
Much worse with other brands where you have 3 million options
"That’s been the used market for for S/X for a while and arguably the 3, as well (this is the 2nd big range update now but there were also different rear seats, suspension, mirrors, etc.)

It’s just a different focus as a buyer. Now you don’t search for the “20XX” model year but for the features you care about - does the car have AP2.0, MCU2, etc."
"Cool. I'm in the opposite mentality. I have a 2020 stealth performance, but I like the chrome delete, longer range, and powered trunk. Free supercharging would be nice but I've only used that a few times anyways so not a huge money saver for me."
"That’ll show ‘em.  Just use the fantasy WLTP figures or non reproducible, non Scientific YouTube anecdotal results!"
"Yes it will continue to improve below 40F, I’m just talking about the peak improvement"
"If you want to get technical, yes. But at the end of the day, the number on that screen is a marketing tool and should not be taken as a end-all-be-all for what you're going to get. Wildly misleading for new buyers."
"I loved my 3 but the declining range was an issue for me.  sold it for almost what I paid for it because I needed a truck now.  I'll be back but I will choose max range over any other option, going forward."
"It’s a very valid issue. SR+ is approaching the territory of being usable for that consideration especially with a heat pump. But as it is... LR offers some of these benefits and it’s hard to overlook it. Transit agencies that use BEV buses expect a 10-15% degradation and they just build that in. If you know you don’t use the top or bottom 10%, and you want a 10% headroom for future losses, you really want to size the battery on just 70% of stated range.... that’s where the user has to decide how much is enough and whether they might need further buffer due to HVAC use too. Better to size appropriately up front."
Same here. My egolf was like 110mi on a good day. At 20% SOC or below you get significantly reduced performance and Heating. So that's more like 85mi in real life.
"Return it, call a relative and tell them to buy your trim and get it from them \*taps forehead\*"
can't hurt.
"Probably not. Who would they sell it to, if not you?"
"Honestly, I doubt it. They know that demand is still extremely strong, so they'll be able to very easily sell your car if you return it. But it's worth asking."
"Impossible to say until Tesla officially announces it.

However, it's possible that the new chemistry is in all the cars they've been making for the last month or so (Panasonic announced the improvements they'd made quite a while ago), but Tesla hasn't updated the cars' software to display the longer range.

That's something they did with the LR AWD Model 3 in 2019. They said ""Hey, you know those 310-mile range AWDs that you guys bought over the last few months? Well it turns out we made them better than what we told you. The next software update will show that your max range is actually 322."""
I'd love to see some real world pics that weren't from the manufacturer.
Sure: [https://imgur.com/a/gLNAJlR](https://imgur.com/a/gLNAJlR)
"I agree with you on the marketing angle. I have a June 2019 AWD and my app shows 4.2 down to 3.7, and can confirm that it used to say 4.4 -> 3.9"
I have a 2018 Model 3 AWD. VIN is 1068xx.
"Any chance you continue to test power output on an old and new AWD+ ? :)

I don't have accurate gps measurement for 0-60 but my max power output matches yours listed in TeslaMate on my 2020

Edit: looks like you are already on in will stay tuned to see if a future update changes it. Thank you! https://redd.it/jcc2xx"
"Yeah personally I'd rather wait for a whole new type of vehicle.

Thinking of a Cybertruck when we've got to replace our second car, as I think it would be better to have a larger truck or SUV then two sedans"

"Most wireless chargers have an efficiency of around 80% and advertise as such.

Not a huge deal when you're talking less then a kilowatt. Very much a big deal when you're talking 50-100kw."
"The black sport rims contrasting on the white body was SUCH a look, and now we have this grey, non-contrasting, bulky looking aero-esq rims that just don’t appeal to me at all."
"Yeah tesla for sure lack that. Also none of their pictures look like the car in real life. Or maybe they just press them together before shipping them to EU.

Their car always look long and slim on pictures but in real life they aren't that long, slim, skinny."
Yeah but considering the power tap required and replacing the trunk cover since they probably won't drill a hole it's going to end up being ungodly expensive.
Should I do.....or that money can go to a trade in for the new m3
"I get that, but in reality, there's simply no way of knowing in advance. Realistic predictions are based on past behavior, and for the past few years, there really hasn't been any major updates to the 3, just small improvements and increments here, a few cost cutting measures there, and again, given the timeline, speculation that we won't see major changes this year was reasonable."
"Yeah, I'm in Texas for 6 months this year.  Even in bumfuck texas I haven't found any roads that are (legally) above 70 mph.

*Correction: Lots of roads were 75."
I think that's the exception and not the rule.  I'd imagine the areas with the highest adoption rate correlate directly with urban centers / more densely populated states rather than rural settings.
"But what roads receive the most travel per year?  Population density plays a huge role in this; Something tells me Cali and the tristate see more miles in a month than Nebraska sees all year.

Montana has limits or 80, but their population is about the same as Staten Island (the smallest borough in NYC).  So the average road in Montana is going to see magnitudes less traffic vs a random side street in Shaolin, nevertheless the BQE or something similar."
"Every where I’ve traveled the highest speed limit I’ve seen is 70, so the max I usually go is 75 I rarely go over that

You must get a lot of tickets lol"
"With structural battery on the plan, don’t count on it."
"In Europe parallel parking is the most common parking by far in cities. Length is key around here. ID.3 is the same length as the Golf, which is already big for our standards: keep in mind that the most common car length here is about 4m (Polo, Clio, Sandero etc) with a lot of really common cars being below that (Picanto, Twingo, Panda, Yaris).

In the US the average car is about 4.5m, which is considerably longer, so even parallel park space is sized for that across the pond."
"Ahh, I see. That would explain the right sided steering wheels shown on trucks/parking lots?

I'm in Canada, so I'm assuming its the same deal as US?"
I called my tesla dealership this morning (in canada) and they said my car hasnt even been built yet and will definitely come with the updates and nothing to worry about. So I imagine you're in the same boat.
You get your vin before you show up so you will know.  The sales person just wants to close the sale so they will find you the correct car ASAP.
Funny. I always had to scrape as well but moved to Florida as well. Used to be in the northeast. I could see it working but never fast enough for me not to just brush it off real quick.
"Damn, 8000 is tough pill to swallow. I’m nervous about my visiting my parents in Northern Vermont in my 2020 model 3. The heat pump is a huge plus for northern climate. The rest of the stuff is just nice."
Because I got one :)
true but they are marking down for cosmetic issues which technically aren't reliability issues.  I agree it's a problem for some and i look forward to the day their robots can consistently build cars so this doesn't happen.

You usually get an email that says you have it assigned. Also should be viewable on your account if it has been assigned.
"That's still 2 years out for the 3 and Y though. First the semi gets it, then the Cybertruck, then the Roadster, *then* the existing lineup. I'd also bet that if the X and S last that long, they'll get it before the 3 and Y, because they need it more to boost falling sales."
"1) Better Energy not Power Density.
2) No one has confirmed the new cells are in the vehicles.

We’re all guessing, but I’m going with the known fact that there’s a heat pump which made a very large difference on the model Y, plus Electrek’s sources.  We’ll know which is correct when the efficiency figures are released."
"So conflicted, want my heated steering wheel, but your post was so funny I have to upvote."
And you ***didn’t*** tell us!?  What kind of monster are you?  Sorry
"Maybe stupid quotation on my part, but how did he notice?"
So I just got my model 3 about that time. How do I know if it has the heat pump?
"But EPA Test isnt with winter conditions, not?"
"Batteries not involved.

3 got a bigger boost than Y, because 3 went to a heat pump. You are seeing all the benefits the Y had over the 3 copied back to the 3z"
Basically a reverse air conditioner. Sucks heat out of the ambient air to pump out into the cabin.
A pump that pumps heat.
"So you know how an air conditioner basically works to move heat from one area to another so that one area is colder, and another area is warmer? Well you can set it up so that it switches on command from moving heat out of the car like a traditional air conditioner, to moving heat into the car like a heater. The advantage of that is that it requires less energy than an electric heater that's required because of the lack of large quantities of waste heat from internal combustion."
Rather than converting energy from one form to another it simply moves energy from one place to another. That’s my best version to someone who’s never heard of one.
The best way to heat and cool anything really. Got a new heat pump at my house and my power dropped significantly.
Very unlikely substantial upgrades already rolled in. Electrik seems to suggest its an efficiency package. Sometime next year we might see another jump from the bigger battery.
"Damn, that’s coordination. Good eye."
"Agree - this should be standard on a 30k car.  When I brought it up to the service advisor (took my car in for a paint issue), he said I could install an aftermarket tint on my side mirror - my car is barely two months old and that was the solution.  I told him I would've waited two weeks if I knew I'd get auto-dimming mirrors. There is so much to be desired with this company sometimes."
"The comment you replied to was a software engineering joke. 

>optimized away at the factory by the compiler

I was simply expanding upon that joke :-)"
Ahh I see what you mean
Yeah I get it now
I just put a piece of tape over the range so I don't have to look at it = infinite range.
"You’re making a claim based on a few anecdotes.

Questions
What is your sample size?  What were the mean and average ranges at various temperatures and speeds?  What were the largest and standard deviations in the results?

I.e. what you state without facts and evidence based on a few anecdotes, can be completely dismissed.

You’ve provided zero evidence the cars don’t achieve the ranges, and meanwhile my Model 3 easily exceeds it."
The EPA range is a standardized testing method so you can compare ranges between different manufacturers.  Obviously range goes up and down based on many factors.  Everyone understands that.  No one is confused about this but you.  The fact that range will vary in no way diminishes the value in being able to compare the range (under certain conditions) of one car to the range (under similar conditions) of a different car.
How much of a problem is the declining range?  Model S tends to trend 5% first year then 2% per year after that.  Nissan Leafs degrade much faster typically.
Completely agree
"I’m hopeful but remaining skeptic about them. I had my chrome deleted glossy black and these will match perfectly if they turn out like the pictures...I’m just glad that on top of these changes, they didn’t make a 400+ mile battery because I would have been tempted to trade in at that point..."
Looks great. Did you also wrap the doors to match?
Mine is also May 2019 build and can confirm the same.
Oh man this is exactly what I wanted to hear. Thanks!
"True, but could a first party solution really be more complicated than some of the third party stuff that’s out there??"
Acceleration boost is not just speed increase. It's also a range decrease and a tire cost increase.
Interesting.  I just drove from Austin to San Antonio and the toll road was 85
"You said there are “few if any roads” above 70mph in the US.  Two different people have pointed out two states where that’s clearly not the case.  The US is a big place.  I’m sure there are more.  Not sure how your point about urban adoption rates is relevant.  Clearly that are Tesla owners in every state at this point.  So the need to test at higher speeds is relevant.   Of course, we’re also completely ignoring the fact that in many places a 70 mph speed limit results in 80mph flow of traffic."
"Sure but Texas, Michigan, Colorado ... these are decently populous states with speed limits higher than 70. Not arguing that they are the “majority” but *certainly* not “few if any”, which was the original contention."
"In many places, a 70mph speed limit results in the typical flow of traffic being 80mph.  Illinois, around Chicago, is a great example of such a place.  Further, there are several 80mph roads in the US.  I know there are many places you can legally drive 80+mph in Texas and South Dakota.  I think testing range at 80mph is very useful information for a lot of people."
"Yeah, that's my major fear is that I'll end up with a car that has a defunct battery and no option to get a fresh one in place.

Obviously... I can probably wait until the structural battery comes online and do a swap then. But then, I don't know if that will even be possible with the new heat pumps."
Why are you trying to disagree with me when you are agreeing with me that the ID3 is still big?
Thanks! That’s a relief 😅
Paint issue is reliability as it may expose the body to the elements and accelerate wear and tear. Same for body gaps.
"Heat pump makes more noise than a resistive heater.

Or he just removed the plastic cover and saw it."
"To be faaair, I don’t have 100% confirmation. I based it strictly off of photos of the frunk with heat pumps. [Here’s a pic of his](https://imgur.com/gallery/nRgqchm)

Edit: and for timing purposes, he picked his up from Toronto, Sept 23rd. SR+"
"I believe they do test efficiency in hot/cold weather and while using the A/C. At least it looks like they do according to their website, but I'm not an expert.

https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/fe_test_schedules.shtml"
"Generally, it's a \*reversible air conditioner. 

They can run in either direction, providing either heat or cooling."
I imagine a reverse air conditioner to consist of a human blowing hot air into a car vent.
"so current model 3 just uses fresh air and heats it and spits into cabin, rather than using a warmer air source to begin with?

didnt know that"
"Goes both ways, bud. If we could get everyone to link their TeslaFi or Teslascope and their longest drives with the battery percentages done, then I could prove it. But I don't have the time to try to rally these answers for someone that is obviously simping over a manchild who sets a cars price to $69420 because another car was going to beat their price.

Do you have any proof with a sample size greater than 100 cars that they exceed their range every time? And doing actual highway speeds and real driving. Not no a/c, no heat, 45 mph, 0% incline bs where they try to squeeze every bit out of their battery?"
"I used Teslafi, and for me, I was in the bottom of those reporting.  For my use case, I was fine as my round trip to work was 90 miles,  it was more annoying than anything else that others were still rocking the same range or close to it as new and I was declining.   I needed a truck and traded at near parity to my purchase price so I got out OK, Ill be back in 5 years or so and without a doubt will forever more choose max range over any other option."
Haha I almost bought a 3/Y in March but then covid hit and we didn't need a second car anymore.  This is tempting me... But I'm holding out for the Cybertruck!
"This company sells 2 sets of the center console wraps for $35 and have a bunch of options to pick from. Doors not included.

[https://tesbros.com/products/center-console](https://tesbros.com/products/center-console)"
Naa
Note that's the modules not the whole pack. That said the batteries are likely to far outlast the car so it's not a huge worry.
The third party one is ridiculously simple tbh and uses additional parts so unlikely. But install requirements and less creative installations could make the service cost more then double the cost.
Don't care about tires. What's the impact on range?
I drove from new england to the border and I didn't see anything break 75.  Didn't stop me from going 85-90 during those empty swaths of nothingness.
"Texas has a population density 1/12th of NJ.  I'm stating that the majority of the 4.2 million miles of road are 65 or lower, especially when you consider how often people actually use roads that are rated higher.   Remove the ""if any"" and it's still a true statement."
With structural battery it won’t be backward compatible at all. At that point your car isn’t worth much. Might as well keep the existing battery or buy another one. Look at your 3 years old iPhone. Do you want to swap a battery and keep using it?
"The ID.3 is NOT big. It's SLIGHTLY longer so when you park you have to manoeuvre just a little bit more, while the Model 3 is straight too long to even fit most of the time. That's a gigantic difference.

It's the same as saying two persons are both really tall while one is 179 cm and the other is 195: yeah, they both are TECHNICALLY above average, but one is slightly above and the other is waaaaay over."
"They unified the trunks in the Y and 3 a while back to simplify production, that was never an indicator of heat pump presence."
"A good way to think about it is that a heap pump is an air conditioner that can:

- either cool the inside air (and pump hot air to the outside),
- or can cool the outside air (and pump the hot air on the inside).

So when it's running it does the same thing, just to different streams of air."
"Current model is is basically an electric space heater.

It doesn't necessarily need to use fresh air, it can grab it from inside the cabin.

The heat pump is basically like a window AC, the outside part blows heat and the inside blows cool air.  Flip that so the outside is the inside."
"No it doesn’t go both ways.  You made the original claim with no evidence.

What is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence (OBVIOUSLY)."
Good luck!
"Probably true.  Although afaik the parts would likely be the same, struts, some wiring and an actuator in the trunk.  I’d guess about 1k tbh."
"Was curious so I looked it up.  Seems I stumbled upon the highest in the USA 🤷‍♂️ and then assumed there were more.

https://www.cnbc.com/id/49520151"
"Oh, I'm not expecting it to be backwards compatible.  What I'm expecting is that Tesla will have some back inventory of the old packs. I think they'd want to ultimately ditch them.  Hopefully those older packs will have more range in them than my current pack.

The question would be price.  Is it going to be 24k (which google says it was previously)?  If that's the case might as well get a new car.  On the other hand, if I can get like new range for 6k or less, that'd be mighty tempting.

With the Iphone example, if a battery swap was $2 and that's the only real issue with the phone (so assuming it's still getting software support, the screen still works, and it isn't too slow), then absolutely I'd keep using it.  If, on the other hand, the battery swap costs as much as a new phone (or close to that cost) then I'd not go with it.

&#x200B;

I'm in the process of ditching my trusty Pixel 2XL.  I'd totally keep using it but it's falling out of security support here soon."
"No, I said that the ID.3 is big and it is. It's 40 cm wider and 30 cm longer than a polo. The width is way more important than the length. Just try drive on roads that are narrow, or parking in any parking spot. Even the ones on the side of the road will suffer, but it's mostly the parking houses where it's a problem. 

Why do you want to disagree with me when you have already said that the ID.3 is big compared to standard EU size cars? 

179 cm is average height for males, if not slightly below). Besides that you once again agree with what I'm saying."
"Thanks for the info!! I didn’t realize that.
Though a bit of a bummer that they’d shrink the frunk with no need, outside of reducing a part."
https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/jc9ez4/realworld_driving_range_model_3/
I'm thinking there will be another big change to the 3/Y right around when CT releases to justify the prices being so close.  Either they lower the prices of 3/Y again or up the range.
1 less actuator. I hope Tesla just make a do it yourself kit. 1k I'd probably do but anything more I don't know
"Yeah. I get your point now. If they’re responsible, they need to at least produce some parts for a while to maintain the existing fleet. Chances are some battery formula update could go into the part. It is a possibility."
"Are you sure on your sources? The ID.3 is only FIVE cm wider than the Polo (180 vs 175) and 21 cm longer (4.26 vs 4.05). The width of the Polo is actually slightly BELOW average (Clio is 179, Golf is 179, Punto is 177 eg). And Model 3 is even larger at 185, but that's just 5 cm above average which is almost irrelevant given that the marks are, by law, between 12 and 15 cm wide. The length is the problem here. 

What I'm saying is that the ID.3 is longer than average but the added length is still shorter than the parking marks (~10 cm per side vs 12-15) so it falls in the wiggle room people takes when parking, while the Model 3 with its massive 64 cm added length is waaaaay longer (32cm per side vs 12-15 for markings). The ID.3 is probably in the 55-60th percentile in Europe, while Model 3 is probably in the 80-85th, dimension wise. That's a HUGE difference, the same between a Nissan Juke and a Fiat 500. Length wise, the ID.3 and the Model 3 are VERY different in Europe... The Model 3 is still a better bang for the price by a long shot, yes, but in Europe the ID.3 is by far easier to drive. 



Also, the average human male is 170 cm tall, being 177 in Europe and 175 in the US. So no, 179 is not below average, is above average but SLIGHTLY, which was exactly my point."
Probably in prep to add the heat pump (which also reduced the number of parts.)
"Too funny.  You lost your own argument.  Reread the thread.  People get roughly the same range.  There’s even a published database.

Even though your own link proved you wrong, it’s still not evidence.

Learn the difference between evidence and statistics vs. random anecdotes."
Agreed
"Its very rare that I see any parking spots that are limited by length, its all by width. 

Besides if you look at best selling cars in EU,a fair amount of them is pretty lengthy. At least more so than a Polo or UP."
"The glass is more interesting imo. If they sell me the glass I might just take a day off of work and install the trunk, auto door handles, soft close, and glass myself.....but god I would be a happy camper after."
You’re way more handy than I!
Lol I'm almost out of warranty so just willing to take the risk tbh.
Is the Model Y going to get this updated console too?
Satisfying AF!
I didn’t understand how it worked until they did it the third time
I like the look of older design but that pull back is smooth as butter bahd baby.
"You know.. at first I was a bit upset that the car I picked up a month ago has an older interior... but now I think I prefer mine

There’s more accessibility with the old layout - being able to move the charger and door gives me a full view of everything inside. 

Also, the car charging port.. the new ones don’t seem to have a cover. I really enjoy the fact that I can charge my car and close the door for my phone to be hidden. I left my work phone by accident in my car, but did have the door closed. No one would have known I left my phone."
"I love the sliding console cover, it looks really slick. But overall I think I prefer the original dual cover (minus the piano black) for the phone charger and console, I think it gives it more of a future vibe whereas this gives more luxury-vibes. Just my personal preference though."
"Dang, they just missed Apple reviving MagSafe.  Would have been nice to have an iPhone ""lock"" in magnetically. 

I think the modularity of the old phone holder design was a big win, too bad that's gone."
"The new USB location might be an issue.  (shown at 10 secs in video).  Its basically in your way when reaching down inside. Unless you use super tiny ones, you will have navigate around the sticking out drive.

I use those bigger sticks for work, and they are easy to bend when they stick out like that. This also means that for any connected device, the cable has to do a 180 loop."
"You cant access full storage and no lid to keep the phone from flying when you have fun in performance mode. No sir, I do not like it."
"Looks nice.  

Can the phone still drop into the console below like it does currently on the Model Y?  That's one of the main gripes that I have it currently. Along with the charging speed leaving a lot of be desired, but that's a problem with wireless charging overall currently."
"Personally, I hate it. Not only does it look uglier and out-of-place (IMHO), it's also a downgrade from a functionality perspective.

Firstly, I like being able to close the lid on the phone charging area, especially when parking in SF or other areas where I'm worried about people breaking it. I also think it looks much cleaner with the lid closed.

Secondary, the old style allows you to open up the storage compartment much wider. Meaning you can easily fit bigger things (like my iPad or Kindle) inside. This is especially helpful when I'm traveling on long road trips and have extra stuff with me that I want to hide (or not have moving around while driving).

Thirdly, the old lid leaves a gap that allows you to easily run wires through it. I often drive with a expensive radar detector plugged into the cigarette lighter. But, I usually take it down (and hide it) when I'm not safely parked at home or work. With the old design, I can put the radar detector in the center console while still leaving it plugged in, and the lid closes perfectly, with no fussing. With the new design, that's not at all possible.

Fourthly, I can foresee the new lid getting stuck if you jam too much stuff in the compartment. I had similar issues with the sliding cover on my previous car. With the old design, this isn't something you have to worry about.

My only gripe with the old lid design is that if you had something resting on top of it (like a parking garage ticket), and the lid gets nudged opened somehow, you lose the item into crevice that you can't easily reach into."
I’m liking the door but the charging pad just seems really out of place and ugly
Yup. I don’t like it.
"Thanks, I hate it."
Only refreshed thing that I dont like over what they already had.
"Mark my words.  Next big third party accessory people will be buying is some type of cover to cover the phones. 

That looks cheap AF the way it is."
Looks like it belongs in a Chrysler 200.
Cool. I still like the current design though.
So glad i have the old version.  Its too easy to scratch but it’s a bolder design.
"It looks worse, but the lid closure is okay and I feel like the storage area is a little more useful

Overall, I can't say I really care"
"Chrome delete those silver edges, Tesla!!"
Meh..looks cheap. I like my OG console better.
"Do NOT like at all. Looks very cheap, like we're looking at a Chrysler or Ford. Yuck."
I don’t like how you can’t hide the phone anymore. I prefer to hide it so it doesn’t distract me.
I think I prefer the current version! Something about the clean lids
I kind of like how the old one hides the phones...
"I prefer the looks of my old one better. The 1 thing I do like is the lid looks slightly recessed. 

The lid is such a natural place to set things down and then they go sliding off as soon as you make a turn."
The suede looks super tacky.
"Close

Lid


GENTLY!!!!!!!!!"
Def slicker and more luxurious but not being able to close the phone area really sucks. I don’t want to see the phone lighting up with every text or notification. It’s a bigger issue in a Model3 vs other cars since the phone faces you.
"Any word on what happened the the USB ports in the center console?  I know a port was being added to the glove compartment (for some small amount of security), but what happened to the existing port?

Did the move the 12V accessory receptacle to the forward compartment?"
Old one is so much better
"That's honestly quite ugly.   The wireless charger looks like unfinished molds of the final product 

The slide mechanism for the drawer is quite nice but the chrome accent looks a bit tacky.      Much prefer the original design they had without the piano key finish."
"And thus, the age of Tesla bucking trends and creating their own interior design language is over."
Wow! So it both opens and closes? That's insane!
I recently got a kia optima as a rental with the same console cover
"Has anyone heard whether this will be coming to Model Y anytime in the near future? I'm waiting on the 7-seat configuration, maybe the new production line will include this updated console from the Fremont factory?"
How’s the phone staying there when doing a fast acceleration?🤔
The Note 20 Ultra in a case would not fit in that cell phone spot.
Your phone flies back when you hit the juice..
there goes wraps and shells.  won't work on that sliding mechanism
This looks great but what about the space under the charger? There used to be a large section compartment with USB chargers.
So you can't put your phone horizontal now.  Great...
"New message: 

""Please slid lid **up** gently to **open**"""
"Now instead of people complaining about scratching the cover, they'll complain about scratching the chrome surround instead. Personally, I prefer the outgoing style. Quick wrap, and done. Sleek, clean, and no interior chrome/plastic,"
Was expecting another monitor lol
There is an update on the car and all you see is videos about the centre console. If that is all the car has to offer it’s not really worth talking about it
Have an s20 ultra big phone and a wireless charger on my 3 that allows it to charge horizontally. Looks like this setup will only work for small phones and eliminates aftermarket solutions
I think the last version looked better than this one. This looks far more plain in comparison.
To me this is the only downside of the refresh. (Old one with matt black mid console cover though)
Cant believe it but the previous one was better even with the piano black
"Don’t like it, I also dislike the chrome delete and the new premium rims look cheaper as well, maybe we are going to see a price decrease for model 3s."
"yup, phones are gonna be flying"
"That wireless pad looks so shallow, and now there is no way to add a deeper shelf to it.  It will be very interesting to see how securely it holds phones with thicker cases."
Thanks. I hate it
Glad I have the current style in my Y. I’m not a fan of this new version.
"Bleh, omg why did they ruin it. Wtf happened to spartan minimalism?"
"I don't like the looks of it.  I want to be able to cover up the phones if want to, this doesn't seem to allow it."
Those phones aren't staying in place when I drive.
"I like my classy piano black openable console a lot better. Thankfully I got it before all this and chrome delete which I don't like. 

I like the nice classy chrome look and piano black classy console"
"Why is everyone flipping their lid over this? Doesn’t look as sleek as before, more awkward to reach the bottom of the console, and everyone’s talking about how satisfying the lid is like other manufacturers haven’t had the same thing for years."
I hate my last gen center console now. :-(
Where does the USB flash drive go now?
"So this video seems really hidden, haven't even seen it on any other forums, is there any confirmation of the heat pump being in this car?"
"I hope Tesla revolutionize the Cybertruck interior. Trucks have things like a workstation, more than 2 cup holders, easy to access storage, etc.

I hope they make the Cybertruck the most utility rich interior ever designed."
"I see a market for an accessory that covers the phone charging pads. I like that it’s easy to get to, but don’t want to have to look at two slots all day.  Maybe a nice monogrammed insert in matching metal or pleather."
Thanks for sharing!
Seems like a stupid question is this MIC Tesla Model 3 Y? sr+ long range etc? More infos please
No FOMO! I gotta say I like my old style better. Phones hidden and you can customize better.
"wow that phone cradle looks incredibly shallow, they should add some magnets or something to secure the phone in place.

i'm not sure that would even be legal here as every electronic device must be securely affixed or put away completely"
Huh?
Can the old center console attachments still fit into that space?
You know Mercedes have had this sliding lid thing for years right?
I think he just called that center console the N word. Future reply: I know! It was a joke!

How can this be wrapped in white?
"The models being released right now are these ones?

Or is this unreleased ?"
Did they put pedal covers on their car already or does it come like that from the factory now?
"I see the USB ports are now on the ""front"" (cupholder side) wall instead of the rear."
"Not a fan of the spring-loaded lid. Don't get me wrong, I like the feature, but I know that in 5 years the spring will either be broken, weak, or the track gummed up and won't slide smoothly anymore."
1420 haha love it
Console ASMR
It better have the ability to tell if I'm struggling to close it so it can give me a neat tip in the UI
Please someone do a full review of the changes. And do someone know when the next changes to the model 3 are estimated to come? New bigger battery? Other things? What do the rumors say?
Does the USB-C support USB3 speeds and Power Delivery now ? It would be great if it could charge my laptop in a pinch. Edit: Is the Wireless charger directly powered or does the wireless charger use the front USB port(s)?
What if your phone can’t wirelessly charge?
I guess this is all because people complained enough that the magnetic way of closing the lids required too much attention.
"The interior is pretty underwhelming imo, except the giant ass screen lol"
Makes me want to get a newer phone for wireless charging.
"WOW they got moving lid now, time to buy some stonks!"
Finally they got rid of that magnetic lid which was super sensitive
Still no dead pedal I see.
I thought the wireless charging spot costs extra. Is it free now?
Not sure why I kept audio on through the entire video
"As a current model 3 owner, this is NICE!"
Maybe I just drive harder than most. No way my phone would stay put on that lol. Good means I like my 2020 better :)
"I’ll admit it looks significantly better, but I prefer the current to this to be honest."
"Looks nice, however I prefer the way the older consoles works. Not the look of it, but the way it's opening, magnets and so on. Visually it has a better engineering imo"
not digging the open cell phone spot - needs a lid
Tesla really highlights how much every other car company in the world has been slacking / intentionally shafting customers by hardly updating cars at all
Eh. I think I like my flipped lid better. And it doesn't look like you good put your phone horizontal in the new charging panel
Much slicker than the current design.
So it has wireless charging built in?
Are there still usb ports?
"This is such a minor change that it's hard to care either way. (seriously, a storage compartment lid). It looks nice though.

Did they add the dual-paned glass?"
What do you do if your phone doesn't have wireless charging?
420 nice
The only thing I don’t like is you can’t put your phone in landscape- I have a wireless charger in my car and I use landscape charging all the time when I’m stopped somewhere to charge or just killing time before going into work and I’ll landscape my phone to watch something on it while charging. Small nit pick but I’d miss that option
Does it come with an attached roof?
Is there another car company I'd spend a minute of my life watching a video showing off their all-new center console?
"I don't really understand the Tesla naming conventions... 
If I order a Model 3 today (Oct 2020), will it be a 2021 or a 2020 with updated features?"
"On a performance 3, those phones are gonna go flying!"
"I’ve never seen a 2020, or even a 2019 for that matter hahah. So I can’t tell what’s different."
No piano black?
I'm actually going to miss the yacht floor in my S whenever I move up. The little change drawer is enough space for knick knacks (which I try to keep few of). The open yacht floor is then great for a purse or small bag to save having to open the trunk or something. Also makes the car feel super open in a nice way.
I would retrofit this in a heartbeat on my m3
i like this much more than the old one. Sure it looks legacy but it works really well
"Still getting over the accolades and admiration for what is just a freaking storage bin, of which same design has existed in some form for years.  :-)"
"Not going to lie, I’m glad I have the old M3P, I think the old rims look better, and that sliding door on the center console looks like a nightmare, I put my oversized bottle in there and it bangs around ever corner, I’m sure the bottle would be hitting and closing it all the time. It also looks like there is less room where the phones go, mine is a much deeper pocket. 

That being said, if I didn’t know about the old one I would love this just the same, but as an owner who just recently bought, I’m not phased at all by this update, power trunk and black out package would Be sweet tho"
"No-one here to explain that this isn’t official, but rather a Tesla fan in China that made this based on the pictures?"
I have the old one. I prefer the new one.
Am i supposed to be impressed?
I don't like it. It does look chinese taste
"Gonna be hard to wrap the center console now.

Also I'm not a fan of the wireless charging. Not many phones out there support wireless charging. The charging speeds on the prior model 3 USB ports are piss poor. That's why I bring my anker powerbank with me to charge my phone."
"So if you have an old cellphone without wireless charging, time to upgrade."
Will current owners be able to swap the old console for this one?
Holy shiz! Post this on r/oddlysatisfying
That's really cool.
Much better than the old
"I prefer this, I remember like every Tesla review I watched mentioned how sensitive you had to put the old lid down."
Lmao and?
Guy looks like a skinnier Asian Elon Musk.
[deleted]
"so it's like the model S

which is the better design"
"I think moves like this make it clear what Tesla’s long term plans are for their cars. They have no plans to continue to try and compete against the likes of BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, etc. 

They’ll continue to push to make their cars cheaper and cheaper and give Wall Street what they want. That is, higher volume sales and high stock prices. 

Can’t say I blame them for wanting to be Honda over BMW.  Was good while it lasted."
"If you don’t mind, where did you find this video? I’ve searched on YouTube and can’t find - I just realized YouTube was a mistake. Lol."
Looks very nice
"Okay that's pretty cool.

&#x200B;

Hopefully springs don't lose tension."
"I would want a little strap or something to keep my phone from jumping out of that shallow nook when I turn or hit a bump.

That said, this is awesome."
"That ""1420"" on the clock. Well played China, well played."
"Keep the software updates, can I update mine with this instead??"
"I don't understand, isn't opening it backwards with such a unique ""magnetic"" behavior that so many people get wrong they have to include a notification in the console JUST to teach them how to use it and a charging phone pad \_buried\_ under the lid that it's almost impossible to lay your phone down and pull it up back up without dicking around better?!?!

Source: MYP and the entire center console design annoys me."
"How do you switch from drive, reverse, park & neutral?"
Are the magnets in the charger strong enough to hold the phone in a M3P during 0-60 acceleration?
"I thought Tesla model years matched the calendar year, but I see this referred to as 2021. Who chose that year? Has something changed?"
I'll tell you guys what I really like - no hard shiny plastic in the center console.  I can't tell you how many times I've been blinded by the reflection of the sun off of the center console.
Apparently it is 2021 in China?
"Does it only have wireless charging or can you still use USB-C, Micro-USB, or Lightning cables?"
Xie Xie
Can I pay to have this retrofit on my M3?
Que?
I barely know anything about Chinese but this accent seems kind of peculiar. Can somebody comment on that?
"This is cool, way better than glossy sunlight reflector, but I kinda liked the magnets too. When someone tries to slam it, it doesn't close fully and pops back open. I told my friend ""softer"" and works like a charm. I just liked that experience. lol"
Litterally perfect
How long until you don’t pay your Tesla bill and they lock you out of your center console?
The guy in the video said this is a aftermarket modification by the owner. Not from Tesla.
English Please... We need English
There have been 2021 Model Ys delivered that don't have the new console. It makes sense that it will get the same updates in the future since it shares so many parts with the Model 3 but we don't know when that will happen.
"Yes. I like that lid closure. Also seems like they retained much of the storage underneath the phones. That’s good. 

It doesn’t seem like there is much of a bottom lip for the phones, could be the angle, but that may be an issue on hard accelerations?

Edit: The current design causes my phone to pop out, may be more related to the lip it rests on (jeda charger) and the battery case I use (Apple battery case for iPhone XS). 

Also typos."
Will this be the same center console for the 2021 model Y
this was exactly the reply i was going to post.
Itd be nice if they showed what happens after you push the door in when its in the open position.
It’s essential to Model the features 3 times.
[deleted]
Old was more expensive to produce and better quality and style. They went to a cheaper unit to save costs and pass the value down. Gonna see the old ones seller for more as it should be a direct swap if you wanted the old style.
"I agree, just got mine and I'm kinda glad I have the old layout."
"That's just the reality of buying the latest tech.

Just gotta remember you bought your car because you liked it in it's current config."
"Especially if you just put on a $20 vinyl matte wrap over the piano black.  I love the white vinyl look that I did for mine.  Completely matches the white dash trim, and looks way better than this design that looks a little dated IMO."
"Looking forward to potentially something from Nomad or someone else to add that functionality in the future.

Would be nice with the increased charging speeds at well (15W)."
You could place a magnet sticker on the pad with your new iPhone and it’ll stick still and wireless charge at the slower Qi rate. Not exactly mag safe but almost identical
It looks like the new MagSafe charger still has a tiny bit of magnetic attachment to regular phones. Not enough to lift it up but enough to centre itself.
They probably thought putting in Apple-specific connectivity would not be the best use of the money
"> reviving MagSafe

As if adding magnets to a Qi charger has anything at all to do with MagSafe.

Fun fact: This ""groundbreaking"" ""new"" functionality existed in the Google Nexus 5. Apple released the iPhone 5s that year. MacBooks still had actual MagSafe chargers and Apple wouldn't ""invent"" wireless charging iPhones for another 4 years.

I realize I sound pretty salty and maybe I am, but FFS adding magnets to wireless charging is almost as old as wireless charging itself! I do hope their magnetic accessories work out better than Motorola's did though! 

Honestly I'm just really disappointed that not only did they refuse to switch to USB-C like **every** other cell phone uses, they stopped including chargers and play like that was some amazing environmental accomplishment and not just cost-saving. If they really cared about the environment and not just the money then they would have dropped their proprietary connector so we could all have one less cable in our lives.

/end_rant"
does the lock in also wireless charge too?
I'm sure there will be some kind of thin mat with conveniently located magnetic strips from 3rd parties in no time.
"Tesla wouldn't put Apple-specific features in the car.
They wouldn't discriminate one platform over other, look at their marketing photos, they put both kinds of phones in there, indicating they treat them as equal.

If you want to buy an Apple-shilling car, get an Audi."
Apple is trash
"I don't like where they stuck those USB ports in the center console too, but the easy workaround is to get some mini USB extension cables, then you can route the cables better; maybe some right angle or curved ones would help.

Depending on the placement of them as such, I wouldn't be surprised if someone made a 3rd party accessory to better hide/route them, though the chances may be lower due to the USB port in the glove box."
"That was my first thought too. Then I realized that for most people, there wouldn't be any need to use those ports other than to plug in a gaming controller. 

The glove box holds the drive for the cameras, and you CAN add a USB hub to add more drives there as well (for music and maybe future games/apps). The wireless chargers have their own power and don't need those ports."
"There’s a new USB port in the glovebox for your storage drive. 

The ports in the center console are probably something you would use when someone needs to plug in an additional phone to charge."
This guy accelerates
Own a Y. Never had my iPhone drop into center console....not sure how this happens.
Definitely agree on the old style allowing larger items to be stored. I have a tissue box in there and my wife also puts her purse in there as well.
"Agreed, this is monumentally worse for all of the reasons you mentioned. Biggest for me is the inability to open it as far, followed by the phone cover making everything so minimalist."
"Leaving your phone in your car in SF sounds like bad idea in general. I don't think keeping it in your car, even with the lid on, is a good idea."
"Yeah, I'm a fan of the old console too.  Looked much slicker and I have mine wrapped in white to match the white interior.  I love closing the phone cover and it looks extremely clean and minimalist."
Yep I’m glad i got the original because I don’t like this at all.
"Agreed, not sure why Tesla made the change. Just a waste of development money and changing materials. Unless the new center console is significantly cheaper somehow, which I doubt."
"The extra storage is the best part about the old design. 
 
My favorite example of a spur of the moment use case was fitting 2 quarts of ice cream in there while i drove home 5 minutes from the store."
"If you're keeping your phone in your car does it continue charging? For that matter, if you plug in a USB device will it keep charging?"
I like it - so I can see who is calling me and see my notification
I like it. I typically throw my phone somewhere visible when I get in the car
[deleted]
Fuck having to put your phone into a compartment everytime you get into the car.
Yea it looks strange to me too. Looks too shallow but too wide as well? I know its to accommodate the biggest of phones but it doesn't look elegant at all. Imagine a iPhone 12 mini going in one of those huge slots
[deleted]
"I agree.  But I'll take the battery, range, and factory chrome delete!

Having said that... Is the factory chrome delete indeed better?  Wasn't there an issue with the first batch of Model Y's where the black trim looked really bad, or maybe was susceptible to certain types of carwash soap?  

I recall reading that the black trim could look shitty real quick.  Did they ever fix that?"
lollll
[deleted]
That lid closure mechanism will break after regular use.
Put dnd on
Just turn on car mode on the phone then. You’ll miss all the notifications.
Most people I know just leave Waze running on their phones in the charging area. Only on reddit have I seen so many people complain about it.
More Luxurious? It looks like something out of a cheap base-model Honda Accord.
"Wait you cant close the lid? 

You telling me that tacky suede is out in the open with no way to hide it?

Ewwww"
Fuck having to put your phone into a compartment everytime you get into the car.
"They are inside the center console storage bin now, I believe. Total of 5 USB ports I think.

2 in center console + 1 in glove box + 2 for rear passengers. (and you get 2 wireless phone chargers). So technically, you can charge like 7 devices at once!"
In the video it appears that the ports are in the storage compartment but are now on the cupholder side. You can see a thumb drive sticking out from the cupholder side into the storage area.
"The 2021 model year Ys that have been delivered don't have this console, so we don't know when. I'd expect it, as Tesla has shown they like to keep these 2 consistent but I expect some wait."
"It was similar before, it is slanted enough that it has never been a problem for me. I am in an M3P."
Jesus Christ. How do you people drive????
???
Why? It’s better
"Any of the 5 USB ports. Your choice. 

Two inside central console, two for rear passengers, and there's a new one inside the glove box. 

I presume that now you can put a PIN on your glove box most people will opt for that one."
"Glovebox. 

Where do the remote controls go?"
"In this specific car, or in the refresh? Because it's officially on the Tesla website that new model 3s have a heat pump."
17 usbs and 14 electric outlets
Needs 20 cupholders to beat the Subaru ascent.
Performance comes like that
"I believe it’s been said the ones for the rear passengers are still there, in addition to the two inside the drawer. There’s also one inside the glovebox now."
Yes like they did previously on newer models.
That's what the 15 inch landscape screen is for....
"They switched to the 2021 model year and new features on October 5, so you would get a 2021. Notice that the online order page shows the new wheels, range, and center console."
"USB C ports should help with charging speed assuming they’ve been implemented properly. 

But... not many phones support wireless charging? Wuh??? The two largest smartphone manufacturers have had wireless charging on the majority of their devices for at least the last 3 years, I would be shocked if a significant majority of phones *didn’t* support wireless at this point. 

Now does the wireless have enough wattage to be functional? That’s a better question..."
"I think all ports are high speed, probably 9V USB C ports."
You can buy an adapter that makes it wireless.
Its really not an issue lol
" if the new center consoles can be swapped with the old one, I’m pretty sure you’ll find a person to swap with easily"
Bimmertech makes a great powerturnk upgrade for the M3.
"The right stalk on the steering column controls gear selection and autopilot activation.

That was actually the normal location for most automatic vehicles until about the late 80s/early 90s, when everyone dropped bench seats and went to bucket seats."
"That changed starting with the 2020 Model Year. I’m not aware of any official statement or tweet announcing it.

They still slipstream some changes, but with high volume like Model 3/Y it just makes logistics easier to batch changes."
"From my resource, they have not anounced the 2021 refreshed one yet. The shanghai factory is exporting 21 refreshed to EU."
sounds like Beijing dialect. i may be completely wrong though.
Tesla uses partners for financing.
"No it's not, it's the new 2021 refresh...they already showed it off and you can order it right now"
2021 Model Y's with the range increase?
They're probably going to do a bunch of changes all at once. My guess is when the new 7 seater version of the Y rolls out that they'll start using the new console and maybe a few other changes. They have to finish up all the parts they have.
"The phone won't fall over under hard acceleration. However, for hard turns/if you track your car, definitely it'll slide around imo."
"M3 gets less than 1g longitudinal acceleration so as long as it’s less that 45 degree angle it’ll stay put. 
Like someone else said, turning is what I’d be concerned about (which you might have been referring to)"
It will probably make it to the Y but since Tesla doesn’t do model years it likely won’t be all 2021s.
woosh ;)
"Yeah, isn't this slider standard in Model S and Model X? And don't most people think the S and X need an interior refresh? Does that make this a ...defresh?"
"Well, as far as ""style"" goes, that individual. I like the new center-console way more, but i also hate piano-black."
"That’s an issue with technology. I buy my electronics when they’re the best currently available. I’d buy the better version if it were invented yet. Lol. 

So every 2 years you gotta deal with that brain-itch feeling knowing you don’t have the latest and greatest. 

Luckily it doesn’t bother me enough to spend unnecessary money."
"For the 1st gen console, a MagSafe module is totally doable, and I'm sure one will ship (modularity FTW!).  To get 15W to the iPhone, you'd need to tap into the 12V supply, which is awkwardly placed.  Would have been a lot nice to have that in the forward compartment.  That's why I'm curious if they moved it in the 2nd gen console design."
"That's true, but it'll depend on if there is an adhesive that can stick to that material without damaging it.  With that near field magnetic stuff, the closer you can get to the coil, the better."
I reeeaaally don’t trust myself to do that
"Wouldn't be Apple specific, the charging would still work for any phone with wireless charging capability."
"Apple literally juste came out with this feature, they couldn't have known and these designs have to be months if not years in the making. Now if it's not in the new cars 5 years from now your comment will be 100% valid."
I’m pulling this figure out my ass obviously but I’d guess Tesla owners are probably 80%+ iPhone users? Not a crazy idea I think.
">reviving MagSafe

How about reviving the MagSafe brand?

Yeah, inductive charging is nothing new.  My toothbrush did it well before the first Android or iPhone OS (before the iOS rename) device shipped.  Apple did add NFC to the charging mix (in addition to the magnetic alignment/attachment mechanism), it's a really small change, but we'll see accessory makers come up with.  

MotoMods looked cool, but like Project Ara, I guess people people didn't want modular phones, or at least not at those prices.  The killer mod wasn't found (bingo, a weapon!).  

I agree that USB-C would have been a great move, considering it's adoption in the iPad and MacBook line.  Maybe next year (as said for the last 4 or 5 years)."
"Just curious.  Do you own an iPhone? Because I have since the first model and I have so many bricks and not the 5 watt ones that I disposed of a long time ago. I have 20 - 60 watt USB-C bricks from all sorts of electronics. 

And as for your contention that what Apple is doing with magnets “is almost as old as wireless charging itself,” Apple often is not the first to do something - they are just always the best.  Not the first OLED phone panels, not the first 4G and now 5G phones.  I can on and on.  Just watch as Samesung comes out with their magnet based charger :)

As for your rant on USB-C, I guarantee you Apple’s plan for the iPhone is to get to a place where it is totally wireless and this is where the magnets come into play.  A big concern was that if Apple got rid of the lightening port (or any power port), is that the user would have no way of holding the phone while it is charging.  That problem just went away. Now it’s only a matter of time till they get to safe and effective wireless charging in the 30 watt range. So you would have them totally redesign the phone around a port that will likely be gone in a year.  And candidly, that would be silly."
"Yep, same as how Nexus phones back then also had face unlock but people didn't like it because it's a battery drain and feels like a security risk so they scrapped the idea, then Apple turns around and ""invents"" that 5 years later and people decide they love it now."
"A MagSafe charger will still charge Qi devices, it doesn't lock anything in to Apple or hurt anyone using other devices."
"If they won't put apple specific features in a car, why did my model 3 come with a lightning cable?"
People say the same thing about Tesla and it’s equally ignorant.
That was my initial reaction also.  Then I remembered that they are putting a tesla cam USB port inside the glove compartment.  Which really is a better place for security your teslacam drive.
Don’t we all
"The lip on the bottom of the wireless charger isn't enough to hold the phone up sometimes.

I would go over a speedbump (probably at ~5 mph) and the phone falls off the lip into the compartment below.  Happens pretty frequenty.

And I don't even have a thick case on the phone."
For me I have a PopSocket on the back of my iPhone and it slides into the console due to the raised back
"which it needs (the purse), because literally anywhere but the passenger seat causes spills to happen. i’ve thought a million times it’s the only car i’ve noticed it a problem that there’s NOWHERE safe for my bigger purses."
"Just parking your car anywhere in SF in general is a bad idea. Especially if it's a nice car. Yeah, nah. I lived in SF for 5 years. My car got broken into many times. Even when nothing was inside. Just don't do it. SF is a s**thole."
"Unless Superman is coming around with X-ray vision this isn’t a problem. 

There’s a reason why no other luxury car leaves phone storage exposed. People leave phones behind all the time. This is a huge inconvenience."
Yes it keeps charging.
"You can do that same thing with the old. Having no option to close, is a downgrade to me."
While you are parked of course and not driving.
Does Tesla not have any phone integration on the display while connected to your phone?
"Perfect, more distractions while driving."
"Yeah, the whole thing looks like something out of a base-model Honda Accord."
? It's the new 2021 design. Not an option
"It’s literally a charger, you don’t need to put it there unless you want to"
"If anything they should of kept it as is, but just make the materials feel more expensive. Textured Metal closures instead of piano black or something."
It looks like an unfinished molding.   So bad
The first person to try to pull it down and you'll hear all the gears grinding and then it'll never be the same again. Talk to a Model S owner.
So run an application each time you get into the car? No one wants to do that
It’s nice to be out of site.  No distraction.
">Most people

\*in America."
You’re telling me alcantara looks like it’s out of an Accord? Alcantara feels amazing and looks great. Almost all luxury cars manufacturers use it and this micro suede looks very similar in the pics.
"Yes, there is no lid.

And I don’t think it’s tacky at all. Most ppl will agree it looks better than the plastic charger that shows now but being able to close the lid is useful and now ppl can’t do that."
"You don’t HAVE to. This removes the option for open or closed phone compartment. Just something that might bother some people, but not all."
man RIP to jeda. Tesla basically added all the features that Jeda focused on selling at exuberant prices
Does that mean if I don't have a wireless charging phone there is no way to charge my phone in the doc?
"Bit awkward to have USB drives or cables sticking out into the storage space, whereas before they were below the charging pad and out of the way"
It was not similar before at all. It had a cover that you could close over the phones.
Like we have a Tesla
"In places with speed bumps, for one."
take a turn with any speed and your phone is gonna go flying out of that shallow charging pad
It’s def better. This looks cheap to me. The minimalistic old center console was very Tesla.
[deleted]
I don’t think it is.
So much better that it has a special message on the screen to help you when the center door bounces back open because it’s a cheap feeling piece of plastic with a weak magnetic latch.
they just want the latest (even though it might not be greatest)
"I don't think the rear USB have data, just power."
"In the 2021 models, just wanted to see confirmation that these pumps are being installed on them."
Not if I’m browsing reddit watching videos off there or something- honestly it’s easier for me to watch phone then load up on car screen. But if it’s full movie or something- yeah- I’m gonna watch on Tesla’s screen
"Great, this is helpful. Thanks!"
">But... not many phones support wireless charging? Wuh??? The two largest smartphone manufacturers have had wireless charging on the majority of their devices for at least the last 3 years

I'm curious as to what manufacturers you're referring to. My only assumption will be Apple and Samsung. But those who don't have Samsung's or iPhones, rely on direct charging. I for one have a Google Pixel 2 XL which doesn't support wireless charging. A lot of non flagship phones don't support wireless charging."
Well yeah now they're fast. I was stating prior models before this upgrade had slow charging USB ports.
"I mean with the 2021 refresh, doesn't seem to have the charging adapters mounted in the phone cradle anymore."
"Not a big one of course, but clearly the design was changed so somebody at Tesla saw it as a big enough issue to change.

Personally I love that I can slam my center console lid. Sometimes a nice heavy clack is satisfying. Just thinking about it makes me happy. Like when you let go of a 2x4 and it hits the unfinished plywood floor. So nice. Neither model 3s have this, but I wish they did. 

I have a volvo not talking about any tesla vehicle."
"Honestly, I just don’t like the glossy, shows everything piano black of mine. Outside of that, I love it and was mostly joking.

I don’t think the consoles could switch out that easily though due to the difference in the phone charger area with the built-in aspect vs changeable charger panel.

Honestly didn’t expect to be downvoted for that comment though. Guess I should have indicated the 10 years old thing was a joke better lol."
"I am aware of the 2021 refresh. The guy in the video said it's aftermarket, even Tesla doesn't have it yet in China."
"Yes, although at least part of the range increase on the Model Y was via a software improvement that is also being released to 2020 model year owners.

"Tesla seems to be doing on-the-fly changes with things like this, not in batches like other automakers.  If it fits in the current design, no reason to wait.  Munro went over this with the MY teardown."
"When I added a charging pad to my earlier Model 3, there wasn't enough lip at the bottom of the phone. When I accelerated, the phone would slip down every time. It didn't fall over.

Luckily, I was able to 3D print an adapter that extended the lip out by 10mm. That was enough to stop it from sliding off.  From the looks of this video and playing around with different thicknesses of 3D printed adapters, it looks like this new design has enough of a lip to prevent it from sliding down. A thicker case with a rounded bottom could be problematic, though."
Is it not a grippy material there?  Hard to tell with the terrible video quality.
Do people typically try to wirelessly charge their phone when tracking their car?
You are sure about that my phone goes flying on the regular in the old console. This looks like it would be way worse. I live in germany so driving a bit faster can happen. Tracking the car also happens from time to time but I don't put my phone in my car I would be in bad shape regardless of where you put it
Look close.  There's a lip at the bottom.
Assuming the phone isn't particularly tall and top heavy.
my iphone 8plus definitely falls out when i floor it
That's assuming a perfectly flat surface which isn't always the case.
What do mean they don't do model years
that is exactly what i was thinking.  its like 3 steps forward and 1 step back.
Agreed needed to wrap mine
">  To get 15W to the iPhone, you'd need to tap into the 12V supply, 

Get a pass through battery pack.  I have one, it provides USB-PD even with the car off, then charges itself off of the USB port when the car is on."
I think the front USB-C port is already 27W.
You could probably put the sticker behind it instead of trying to stick it on suede

"Not super realistic if you include the worldwide population of Tesla owners, in the US, sure why not"
"True, inductive charging is far older than Qi (which is inductive charging itself) but other than the accessories, their new MagSafe rebrand is a blatant ripoff of what the Nexus 5 Qi charger did.

As to relocating the NFC sensor, I'm not sure it really adds any meaningful value to the concept. I get that it can ""recognize what device you attach"" but NFC is not capable of sending any reasonable amount of data so it won't be doing much beyond getting an ID from the accessory. It certainly won't be transmitting pictures or video from a camera add-on or anything like that. Also, MagSafe was called that because it was **safer** since the cable would detach if suddenly yanked. I wouldn't suggest trying that with these new Mag""Safe"" chargers!

That said, I actually both like and approve of the new functionality, I just think it's a tad dishonest of them to call it ""new"" or ""groundbreaking"" or especially ""MagSafe""

Edit: I really should just stop ranting cuz I sound like one of those Apple-haters and I'm probably embarrassing myself by not just letting it go"
"I don't completely disagree. Wireless charging is great, though it will always be slower than direct. While other phones are moving towards the high Wattage PD charging that can charge from 0-100 in 15mins, Apple wants you to be happy with wireless which will always be much slower.

I don't think completely ""redesigning the phone around the port"" is as big a deal as you make it sound.. they just did it with all their other products.

And as to the extra usb bricks, I completely agree. I just think they could've done one better and swapped the proprietary cable for the C2C one that we all have laying around as well. I just think it would be better for everyone if we didn't need an extra cable specific to the iPhone. 

And frankly, going wireless-only means you'll need to carry around a wireless charging puck everywhere instead of just a lightning cable. At least with a USB-C port we could finally have a 1 charger, 1 cable solution."
"Yeah, at least the Apple face unlock used better sensors that weren't dependant on daylight to function. But tbh I think the trend of scrapping fingerprint unlock for face unlock is a mistake. I was glad to see the Pixel 5 go back to fingerprints. Hopefully Apple will consider doing the same now that masks are here to stay.."
"You can charge all Qi devices, but a holder designed to magnetically hold the iPhone likely wouldn't that good of a job holding a non MagSafe device."
You mean the right angle one?
Diddnt Tesla hide a software update behind a pay wall and make it so they are the only people allowed to service their car?
Weird. I have lots of bumps in my area. Never had this happen. But it will likely happen with new console as well. I keep my lid shut most of the time when the phone is in there. So that is prob why it’s never happened
I’m going on four years and I’m ready to leave. I want the housing market to somewhat bounce back so I can sell and get out 😩
"Cars get broken into even without things being visible here. If they see a nice car, they may break in just to see if there’s anything good hidden away. I just wouldn’t trust leaving anything in the car, period."
I personally don’t know anyone that leaves their phone in the car.
My opinion exactly. I often dont keep mine on the charger and instead have it in the cup holder where it's closer. I rarely find myself needing to always charge my phone (iphone 11pro with chunky battery) so it's nice to have an option to hide it all. M3's minimalism was 100% up my alley and this seems to go against it.
"I guess each to their own. I had a 3 for two years and now a Y. I have probably closed the phone cover 3-4 times in total. Looks kinda nice but not very useful, for me. I can see notifications and I’m more likely to forget it."
"This comment just reminded me that mine does close, I have had it open a year and forgot all about that."
"I get the inconvenient of it but I just mean most people I know will always turn Waze on before they leave.

Waze generally does a much better job routing than Tesla's navigation (really any navigation system), not to mention the cop notifications with Waze. Personally I don't drive without Waze open nowadays"
Just turn it over. I never have the screen on my phone facing up when I want to be free of distraction.
Enable 'do not disturb?'
"I mean I did say ""most people I know"". I'm Canada but I get your point."
I thought you were referring to the new console as a whole. The Alcantara is nice but the whole thing together looks cheap.
You can use any of the USB ports for sentry/teslacam. I just makes sense to put the drive in the glove compartment because you can now use a pin code to lock the glovebox.
"I’m not sure if there’s much more risk to Jeda than any other accessory manufacturer. Sure, Tesla makes changes whenever they want and when compared to the model year change approach of other manufacturers, it seems risky, but they still wait a bit of time between updates so they can produce products at scale.

I think the bigger issue may be that they haven’t sold at high global volumes initially, so there’s less potential for used market sales latter on. How many model 3s are out there without the new console or wireless charging capabilities? If it’s enough, then there’s a long-tail of used vehicle owners to sale to. 

Of course, Tesla offering products like the wireless charger accessory, is painful to these types of companies."
This isn't a new thing for any third party manufacturer. They release solutions that fix poor stock design ideas. They'll come up with new ones for the updated design.
"That's why Jeda charged what they did, knowing Tesla would implement it if there was a market.

At the time the 3 was being designed, Sentry Mode and gaming controller were probably not even considered.  It's good that they (Telsa) acknowledged the value of these things and the placement of USB ports."
That seems to be the case.
I was talking about the angle. My cover is open like 95% of the time and I have never accelerated enough to get it to lift up.
Mine has never so much as shifted during even spirited driving.
Think that ones a bit of a stretch unless you’re on the track :/
No it doesn't. 0 problems with the old model 3 wireless charging my phone on the pad (third party accessory) while driving with the lid open.
"Honest question: have you ever had more than 4 devices plugged in at once? Because I can't think of ever needing more than 2 usbs at once. 

My model 3 does have the factory wireless charging and that, I agree, is super nice."
Yeah it's sad that it's still better given all of that lol
I should have specified this was for the 2021 model year ones. It appears manual says you can plug in your drive for sentry cam in any of the 5 USBs.
"I'm sure they will be cropping up soon enough. Looks like most of the cars we saw built were right-hand drive so they are bound for Europe. Meaning they'll take a few weeks to ship and get delivered into the hands of customers. 

But... you believe that Tesla would advertise and list a feature as prominent and requested as the heat pump and deliberately not install them on cars?"
"In the US yes Samsung and Apple. Globally, Huawei is growing quite quickly as well. Granted there are plenty of low/mid range devices out there that don’t support wireless. But I don’t think it’s correct to portray it as a little-known boutique feature either. 

I would wager that the Venn diagram of Tesla owners and high-end smartphone owners is a near-circle."
"Samsung, Apple, Oppo, OnePlus, google all support it. There are other companies to. But the majority of companies you would feel comfortable buying from do support it"
No I mean to upgrade your phone so it can charge wirelessly.  It goes into your charging port and a thin wire goes into a black sticker you put under your case.  Boom wireless charging.
"Have you considered getting a wrap or cover for the glossy? I’ve honestly forgot what the original even looks like these days since that was the first thing to go. Fairly cheap, too."
Wrapped in micro-suede based on what a sales advisor told someone last week. There is a screenshot of the email exchange that highlights all the changes.
"Nah, the point was that if you take a very hard turn and the phone is just chilling in the holder, it slides or tips over. 

Side note, it’s pretty fun to have your phone fly away under P100D/Ludicrous acceleration haha."

"Tesla continuously improves the cars. They minimally have a model year in the VIN but they don’t usually make a full refresh coincide with a new model year. They may do it middle of the year, or just not at all, or add one or two things here and there, then announce retroactively that they did it. Remember Tesla isn’t a traditional car company."
Which one do you use? This sounds like a nice project. Can it charge two phones simultaneously at high speed?
Can you link an example of a pass through battery pack?
Just don't leave it in your car during the summer. That fullly charged battery exposed to 75°C will not last long
"That'd work too, but summertime heat might be an issue.  Are there battery packs that are built to take the heat?

There are a couple of methods of routing 12V to the forward compartment, one doesn't involve drilling, so that's good."
"Really?  Nice. Good to know for my next car, currently looking at routing 12V to the forward compartment to power something like a Jetson Nano for a side project (that I’ll never finish)."
That’s good because the Apple MagSafe Charger box recommends (requires?) 20W.
"Does the USB-C support USB3 speeds and Power Delivery in 2021? It would be great if it could charge my laptop in a pinch. Also, is the Wireless charger directly powered or does it still use the front USB port(s)?"
That's why he got a Tesla. So it drives itself.
MagSafe is just a Qi charger surrounded in magnets
"The comment is referring to the new MagSafe that has been publicly out for less than a week. It is Qi charging with a magnet around it. Other phones can charge on it too, they won't snap into place though."
"I know, but I'm saying that a magsafe charger could charge a phone without magnets too.  It just has the added benefit of holding the new Apple phones in place."
MagSafe is hardly proprietary. It’s just a magnet with Qi inside of it. And then a magnet in the phone. It’d still functionality be Qi.
"Haha I think you’re allowed to your opinion on Apple.

I think they didn’t bring USB-C to the iPhones this year because they plan to cut the cord next year and remove the charging port altogether. USB-C is bulkier than their lightning cable, so they’d lose valuable space by implementing it on the smaller devices. I think this year’s MagSafe push was just to get more people into wireless charging. It’s a smart move for them if they do plan to go fully wireless next year.

Also, I am aware that both chargers are also used for data transfer, I was just focusing on the original topic of wireless charging. Apple has newer patents for methods to increase the speed of Airdrop, so we’ll see what data transfer rates they can pull off. Although, in typical Apple fashion, I’m sure those high wireless data transfer rates will only be available between Apple devices... 

I’m more annoyed that they didn’t bring Touch ID back and integrate it into the side button like they did the iPad. Gonna hold onto my X and see if they bring it back next year. 

*Sent from iPhone* lol"
"I know we are in the wrong forum for this but I don’t disagree with you about the ubiquity of the USB-C cable. Every major device I own (including my MacBook Pro and iPad) has USB-C. 

That said, I can’t remember the last time I plugged my iPhone into a charging cable.  I have wireless charging disks on my nightstand, my desks (work and home) and coffee table. My Tesla has wireless charging. Whenever the phone is not in my hands, it is charging. And I think as the tech gets better it will be incorporated everywhere. And as it gets faster it, we will think how odd it was that we once plugged our phones into these fragile cables."
"It's just a Qi pad with a ring of magnets embedded around the coil. For other devices it would just be a flat wireless charging pad like any other.   


I think the main reason Tesla wouldn't do it is that it would cost them extra, and the current version works just fine."
Yes
">I keep my lid shut most of the time when the phone is in there. So that is prob why it’s never happened

That may be why.  I always keep mine open."
"I was renting and left in August. Bought a home in the suburbs, got my Model Y Performance and am loving life 😍. So glad I didn't buy in SF, I almost did... put in offers that weren't accepted."
"In the rare time something like that did happen. Is the $600-$800 a new phone is going to cost once they’ve smashed your windows out and ripped the insides of your car to shreds going to matter?

It’ll all be one deductible and suck just as bad either way.  Plus, in most cases people do leave their phones it’s pretty brief (think grabbing a mobile coffee order or something) but it’s never brief enough to leave a phone exposed."
"same, i have an 11 pro max and literally have never needed to charge my phone during the day (i just place it on the wireless pad at night), so the old design is perfect for me."
Very true. But to not have the option is a downgrade. Option to close or leave open make the old console better
Some of us would prefer to not have it always open as a distraction.
Side topic: why’d you go from a 3 to a Y? Anything you miss about your 3? I’m thinking about going from my Y to a 3. 🙊
"While i do know quite a few Tesla owners that use waze also, they all have a phone mount by the screen and don't put it down in the console area."
Won’t charge then...
Touché.
Wait a sec... there's a USB port in my glovebox?  That makes a way better spot for  my USB stick.
"my issue with Jeda is their piss poor customer service, attitude towards warranties, and extremely high price points. I bought their first gen wireless pad and was plagued with delays, product issues, and malfunctions and all I got out of it was a $30 discount on their new, overpriced wireless pad.

Other companies like Nomad, Taptes, etc have a ton of other products they sell- so they are less affected by this change.

Jeda? Its only the USB Hub and wireless pad. Sure they are US designed but that won't stop people from just buying a clone for 50% cheaper. Even if Jeda did sell volumes of product, no reason to buy a used Jeda product over a brand new product from another company"
"Mine does. Granted it has the bulky Apple battery case but it very easily jumps off the lip and into the cavity below. Even with the lid down.

"I don't disagree that *someday* we will not need to plug in devices. But that's still a long way off for more power-hungry devices like laptops.

We have the technology and the capability **NOW** to have a single charger, single cable solution. I don't want to always have a charging puck or carry one around. Especially when I *could* use the same charger and cable for my macbook, ipad, AND iPhone. Hell, you wouldn't even really need to have one at all since you could even borrow a charger/cable from anyone who owns a modern device.

Except rather than do the right thing, Apple has decided we should all buy into a whole new proprietary charger system. I'm honestly not happy or excited to buy another marked-up charging product from Apple to do the same thing for extra cost. USB-C is great and there's no reason they couldn't have their modified overpriced Qi charging *AND* USB-C."
"yeah exactly, this works just fine"
And they just gave you one out of the blue inside the car when delivered? Afaik it's a part of their paid accessories where you can buy all types of cables.

"There will probably after-market options to add something like that. Seems like a simple thing to even 3d-print. They have sensors in the entire car and this feature was probably rarely used and the cost-savings would be huge. For the people who really care, they can just buy a 3rd party lid"

True. My phone doesn't do wireless charge so I didn't think of that.

"Oh, sure, I’m not advocating for or against Jeda as a company. More about the accessory market in general and Tesla’s different approach to updating their vehicles.

That said, I did buy a no-name charger from Amazon and it worked for about two minutes and died. I was annoyed and there wasn’t anything else with good reviews, so I spent the money on a Jeda charger and haven’t had an issue in over a year.

That’s just my experience and I’m begrudgingly happy as I did not like the cost."

"Yea I know but if it didn't fall out on the old one when it was on a wireless pad, what makes you think it will fly out of this one?"
"If you would like 1 more slot, I found a device developed by a fellow Tesla owner in the Tesla Motors Club forum thats sold on amazon. The device splits the port into a powered port and a data port. The data port takes care of the SD card (with minimal power) while leaving the majority of the power for the other port, which you can use to charge devices.

Unlike a traditional USB hub, which splits the power evenly. 

Just look for ""navak usb splitter"""
"I posted this elsewhere, but check out Navak usb splitter on amazon (if that's available to you) if you need to free up one more USB. 

I split my usb-a port into a data and a power port, letting me plug in my usb drive and my wife's phone into the same port without any loss in charging speed."
"It does seem a bit moot with that added usb in the glove box. Almost everyone will plug their sentry device there. 

I guess maybe they want to let rear passengers plug in some music?"
Not clumsy as at all.  Not noticable as it has a 90 degree cable and it's all slim.  I stopped using mine though because I was constantly unplugging it to mainly charge my phone with a USB-C adapter when it didn't have a wireless one handy like in my car for example
In this forum - https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/jcdttw/pretty_cool_updates/
That’s very cool. Thanks!
"But I don't think it would be ""discriminating"" or ""Apple-shilling"" if they did it.  


Not wanting them to put in a feature that's nice for iPhone users when it does no harm to Android users seems petty."
It came standard in every single model 3 until they switched to wireless charging.
I want to move states! To an income tax free state ideally! But not sure if my employer will let me. I'm hoping I never have to go to an office again lol.
Either my pocket or I stick it in the cupholder. I actually just ordered a phone mount for the model 3 so I have a place to put my phone that’s closer/actually usable from the drivers position

What magnet? There are no magnets in the original tray.
this one looks alot shallower
"Damn fast response, thanks man"
"I know it sounds petty, but why put in the magsafe when a normal Qi pad works just fine. 

If they were making a magsafe pad, it would likely make some clever use of the tech, like a steeper incline so the magnets hold the phone in (and a non magsafe phone wouldn't stay there securely)

Or it would place the magnet ring + coil in a position where other phones (even older iphones) couldn't charge on it because it wouldn't align without magsafe compatible phone."
Just lightning and nothing else?
We are like the same person
That’s the reason I always (even for a 5 minute drive) put it on the charger. That extra distance helps dissuades looking at/ using my phone during waits.
Keep the Y it's better
bro slow down
"It sounds petty because it is.

It would be of 0 detriment to android devices. It would help secure the phone during higher speed turning, and acceleration.

This
"As said in the other comment, given how MagSafe works and is designed, a pad optimized to use MagSafe would likely work poorly for non Magsafe phones (even older iPhones).

When you have 4 phones, each a different size, you would need to suspend the coil in the middle (or so) of the charging pad and rely on the magnets to align and hold your specific device.
This would make a lot of phones incompatible with the pad, because there is a ton of different sizes and they couldn't center themselves over the coil coz they don't support the MagSafe tech."
Yeah? So they come with a cable for both platforms?
"As far as i know, lightning only works for Apple products so I would consider that a ""Apple-specific feature"". It's actually much more apple specific than the MagSafe charging system, as no non-apple device can use lightning connectors. Any Qi phone can use MagSafe charging, but will not have the magnets snap in place."
"Yeah, I know magsafe is Qi 15W, but when I thought about it from an engineering POV, creating a magsafe pad would likely compromise charging of anything that doesn't have it.
You have the new iPhones from extra smol to quite large, so you would need the coil suspended in the center (roughly) of the charging pad to fit all of the sizes and rely on the magnets to align your exact device properly. This would cause issues to non magsafe devices as they couldn't align with the coil properly."
Need a video if it opening. Assuming it slides under the charger?
Anyone have an image of before and after updates so my monkey brain can understand this?

Looks clean. I prefer the original design though because it's stealthier. Most people don't realize there's a compartment.

That looks very Chrysler-like. I prefer the current minimalistic design. I have mine wrapped white in my model 3 to match the white seats and it looks so clean
I muuuch prefer the single panel flow of the original.
Wow that’s so much nicer than the current one. And no piano black. Really impressed with this. Wonder how the white interior looks tho
Interesting. Not what I expected after hearing a description of it. I like the phone holder spot. Not sure I like the rest.

The current center console is so much more minimalistic and in style with the dashboard missing the instrument cluster etc.

Of course my center console has had wood veneer which I am very happy with from day one, so YMMV."
Nahhh I prefer my current original center console
"I think the original is better, it's stealthier, wider lid and because the charging place lifts up you get easier access and more room. At least that's what it looks like."
Someone pointed out elsewhere that it looks like a Dodge Charger / challenger console. I can see it. I really don’t like that. Took delivery not even a month ago and I’m so glad I don’t have this new console
Should have just changed the finish on the existing design.  My wrapped console looks way better than that.
"Just got mine in March, not mad about missing this I prefer mine. But boy was I heated when I saw dimming mirrors are back and I don't have them."
Surprised by how cheap this looks. I greatly prefer the previous design even though piano black is a finger print/dust magnet. Plus...I actually love the door that closes over the phone chargers and use it often.
Preferred the minimalist design
Looks like a 2011 ford focus now. I hate the sticking out button for the door. I much prefer the stealth look. People go wow when you open it up.
"I'm glad piano black is gone, but I don't like that the door cover for phones is missing."
Will the Y follow suit?
I can’t believe how many people here like this design over the old one. This looks incredibly cheap. The old one looks sleeker and more refined. If they kept the old design and made it matte instead of piano then I’d be all over this. But for now I’m glad I have mine with a wrap on it.
"Looks not as minimalistic and quite ugly. Can’t wait to see it for real. 

A lot of people in my country commented that is looks like a Toyota."
Plz don't come to the model y until I get mine
Not a big fan of the oval tab it makes it look less modern
"It’s gonna be a no from me dawg.

I got the white interior and wrapped the center console to match. Took less than an hour and love how it looks.

I’m starting to think tesla “leaked” this to gauge how the community feels.

The answer is no, Elon. Keep the single panel minimalist design. The interior is what made me fall in love with this car in the first place. Clean and elegant, it’s perfect.

Give us that S and X interior refresh instead."
This is a departure from the minimalist design of everything the Model 3 came out with.
Like the original one with a wrap better
Yuck. I much prefer the clean lines of the original console.
"I actually really like it. I had no complaints with the old one, but this one seems to make more sense to me for some reason. Thanks OP!"
"Am I the only one that absolutely loves the piano black?  Yeah, it's easy to finger print, but just keep a microfiber in your center console, takes two seconds to wipe down and it looks STUNNING when clean."
What an atrocious interior.
Not a fan just based on the pic. Franz hiring Chrysler designers?? Update the material but stick to the minimalist theme.
I’m very happy that I didn’t wait to get a Model 3. Prefer my center console 10/10 times.
"Looks cheap to me personally, glad I have the old version."
Looks bad
That's quite horrid.
"honestly aside from ridding the piano black, i’m not that keen"
"Glad I bought my Tesla before this refresh, I like current a lot"
"Wow... that looks incredible... Nah, I’m just kidding, you’re all off your fucking heads, it basically looks the same as the interior of a 1999 ford falcon"
"Damn, that is like 100x better"
What about that huge space under the charger? Looks like that will be much harder to access if it even exists?
"Looks aftermarket. Especially the phone charging area. Like something you’d find on evannex

https://i.imgur.com/gkojxqo.jpg"
That lowered center area is going to collect every bit of dirt/dust/crumbs.
Looks like something out of an old Chrysler.
That's nice.
"I like most of it, but if I ever replace my Model 3 with a new one, I'd try to find an aftermarket lid for the charging spot. Love the minimalist look with everything closed."
Glad the photographer was sure to capture Spotify failing to load. Lol
"I actually prefer the old one. :(

I know everyone practically hates the piano black but I like how modern it looks. I do hate how easily it scratches however, so I’d put a clear film over it.

I wanted to save a little more on the downpayment before ordering my Model 3, but I really want to get one with the old center console design, and I don’t want to buy used. I feel I may have to order now to still get the old one."
"It's nice, but I think I like it less.... The current design is so clean and unique."
"I’m glad they did this.  Doesn’t matter to me, as I have the old one and like it and am not planning on getting a new car any time soon. But I am really enjoying the discussion - some think it looks more luxurious than the piano black, some think it looks cheesier. Taste is so subjective."
I prefer current one actually. That exposed phone dock is loser.
This looks way better but also way Chrysler/Jeepish...but its better than what it is now.
Wonder how you access the usb now or if it is moved.
"I think I'm gonna miss having a door that closes over my phone while it was charging, and the ability to fold up both doors for a larger cavity.  The door has come in useful a couple times, where I was leaving my phone outside to tether-download a car update, but didn't want to invite break-ins."
"Personally I like the old look more, but I do like that the gloss is gone, and the sliding lid seems neat."
"Not bad, it’s an evolution, maybe not an improvement. I really like the current design, especially wrapped, it looks very streamlined. This design has a slightly more ‘upscale’ look that reminds me of certain domestic cars. 

I have to say I don’t like the open phone cavity. Now it just looks like a place to store things, which invites prying eyes. As a security measure, having all the center console doors shut the car makes it less appealing the thieves, as it looks like there’s nothing inside. A big hole under the screen is like ‘I keep my expensive sunglasses or my extra credit card in here’.

And I like the new leather sides. That’s a nice touch, especially if it matches the seat leather. Would look very nice with white. 

One last thing I didn’t see anyone mention: the wood on the dash lives on! I thought they would get rid of the wood veneer on the dash and replace it or match it to the new console. I feel like very few people like the wood and opt to wrap it with black or carbon fiber. I love that my dash is white to match my white interior."
That’s nice.   Well done.  Just that little bit makes a world of difference
What’s the source of this picture? Is this one that’s been delivered?
...I just want the cabin air filter easier to reach.
I see they still didn't fix the cup holders
I hope they come out with a center console for the Y that takes full advantage of the additional depth that the Y console can have.
"I wish my model s had literally any center console at all. I hit the ~~gas~~ acceleration and everything goes flying out of the little cubby they gave me onto the floor.

Edit: someone reminded me I’m stupid"
"Likes: Looks more integrated, stitched material on the sides

Dislikes: Doesn't look like a Tesla, not as customizable"
If only it was stock matte.
Dont love it personally. But it makes sense to get away from the finger print magnet that exists in today's 3s.
ewe
The old one looked better.. they should have just just put a protector on the piano black.. hope this cut costs for a cheaper model 3
Looks like it’s straight out of a Chrysler minivan
"With this new design, can people still put in the hubs like the jeda or taptes?"
Now all we need is the ability to turn off passenger air conditioning
"Pretty cool what a heated debate there is about something, that at the end of the day, doesn’t matter really that much. What other automaker would have these many comments on an updated center console? =)"
Is the phone dock area open all the time or is there a lid like the current style?
"I gotta say, those cupholders look like it'll send your cups for a ride if they're not wide enough."
Did they move the 12V receptacle to the forward compartment?  It’s currently location isn’t ideal.
This is not a. Update it’s a Downdate! 1990s is calling they want their designs back
I like it.  More luxury looking.
Handsome.
"Cant wait! Ordered mine 3 weeks ago, delivery in Nov/dec (still no confirmed date) everyday is pain till it arrives."
"Looks nice, especially the additional padding on the sides. 

It’s hard to tell but it doesn’t look like they actually improved the functionality of the cup holders though."
I prefer the current design but definitely like that there is no piano black. This design is very nice and wouldn’t/shouldn’t have any impact on whether you buy one but I’m happy mine has the older console. Do with i had a power trunk though.
Sweet. A flat surface to roll joints.
I see they kept the shitty cup holder design.  Take a page out of many other automakers and make some adjustable holders that securely hold multiple cup sizes.
Yessss! Its finally reached Toyota Corolla luxury level!
It’s gonna be a no from me dawg
I hope model Y Berlin will come with this too
i'm getting a strong chrysler 200 vibe from this but it's not a bad thing
[deleted]
Looks great
Curious to know when the model 3 with the new updates is for sale. I’m in market but I’m in no rush. Would prefer to wait and ensure I get the latest and greatest.
Is this concept art or will tesla actually do this?
They went to all that trouble and didn’t add springs or rubber fins to the cup holders? aaaaaaaaaa
"Dumb, and only slightly related question.  If one wanted to completely remove the center console, similar to the original model S, is that even remotely possible?"
I feel wrapping the current lids with black alcantara would have been the best solution.
Big discussion about not much.
Really want to order the Y any day now but I’m wondering how quick the updates to 3 will make their way to the Y.
"Became an IPhone marketing exactly! e.g. : Night mode? Omggggg, already existing in android  for years."
"I think a smarter move would have been to remove the piano black, and opt for a different material perhaps. This feels, outdated.

Issues I see:

Wireless Charging: The Model Y charger is finnicky as hell already and doesn't always work. What happens if this charger breaks down or isn't compatible with all phone sizes? We have to schedule a service appointment and wait weeks for wireless charging? Also, what is that SUEDE? Do you know how hard suede is to clean? Good luck with dirt, scratches, and wear. That stuff ages AWFUL. 

Console area: the space below will likely be limited and cut. Access will be harder. If i need to charge a phone wired, good luck finding the usb ports.  Want a sonsole oganizer? Good luck finding one that'll fit now and have room for things. 

I don't know how I feel about this. It seems less minimal which is why the 3/Y appeal to me. 

TLDR: they should have just removed the piano black but kept the current setup. They should have focused on other improvements, like maybe a S/X refresh!!!!"
"So given they're changing this part, they have an opportunity to put some controls within reach of the back seat passengers for things like... heated seats. Who bets they don't do it?"
"All Tesla needed to do on the current design was upgrade the material quality of the two plastic doors. This redesign looks fine, more traditional, but doesn’t jive with the minimalist as well as the original."
Wow. Definitely a step in the right direction to make it feel like an actual luxury car inside. If they keep this up I just might lease another Model 3 when mine ends in a year and a half.
Wow that’s a step in the right direction. I wonder if opening and closing mechanism has been refined as well.
"Absolutely prefer current one. The awesome piano black smooth shiny finish is elegant and looks classy. This looks shitty as fuck with matte dull finish. 

Also, when are we getting chrome for Y? Looks crap without the chrome finish."
"Seems to be 50/50 in the comments on whether people like it.

Personally I really like the change. I think it looks much better."
"Having owned our two Model 3s now for about 18 months, my wishlist of future improvements has little to do with the center console lid design. I would like to see how you access the USB ports behind the charging pad now that it almost looks fixed in place. I do wish they’d redesigned the cup holders with a decorative cover, and put rubber grippers in the cup holders to keep different sizes of cans or bottles snuggly situated which will also reduce buzzing or vibration. 

Secondly, the Model 3 and Y need a heated steering wheel. It’s insane that they don’t offer it as an option or include it as a standard feature on “premium” interiors since there’s literally no difference between standard and premium other than software deactivated rear seat heaters and missing subwoofer. I could keep the heat off most of the winter if my hands didn’t get cold. That’s why I’m so disappointed they don’t even offer a service-installed heated steering wheel. Tesla needs to just ditch their awful camera based auto wipers and put in a real rain sensor. I’ve never had a worse automatic wiping system as the one in either of our Model 3s. They don’t come on for too long after it rains, then once they do activate you can almost guarantee they will wipe at full speed in even the lightest of rain. I often just manually control the wipers because they work so inconsistently. My old VW Golf GTI, Land Rover LR4, and Honda Accord all had flawless auto wipers with adjustable sensitivity. Tesla needs to at least allow adjustable sensitivity as a setting for the wipers. A rain sensor would be so easy and cheap to add to new cars. I’d also like a HUD, 360° cameras (requires better placement of cameras), real blind spot detection with front and rear cross traffic alert. In my opinion FSD will never be possible without the side firing radars that make blind spot detection and cross traffic detection possible.  Tesla’s current camera and sensor suite has many blind spots that are going to always pose a major problem for city driving where visual obstructions like tall parked cars/trucks, buildings, etc. are the norm. A full self driving car needs to know what’s coming at it perpendicularly even when it visually can’t see because of an obstruction or poor lighting. That’s why these side firing radars are so important. 

Obviously we can all agree Tesla needs better paint quality, more color options (bring back SILVER!), I would appreciate having the option to choose 18” or 19” wheels on the Performance model vs. being forced to go with the 20” wheels with summer tires. The stock 20” size tire has next to no tire options and the sidewall is so small ride quality isn’t the best and bent rims are not an if but a when. That also reminds me how badly I want adaptive damping (not air suspension) and believe it should be standard on both 3 and Y. Not everyone wants a punishing ride 24/7. Adaptive dampers are a cheap (relatively) way to increase ride quality and are used on everything from Honda Civic Si/Type-R, VW GTI/Golf R, Honda Accord Touring, BMW 3/4/5/6/7/8, Alfa Giulia/Stelvio, etc. There’s not a single luxury sedan or SUV on the market doesn’t offer at least some sort of adaptive suspension (either magnetorheological or more simple variable valving in the dampers) as standard or at least as an option. Model 3/Y need adaptive dampers more than most cars in their class because they are very firmly sprung to counter the excess weight of the battery pack and all of the cars ride on very low profile tires. It would be so nice to be able to select a comfort suspension setting for long highway rides, while a normal or sport setting could be used for spirited driving. 

Finally, I would like a powered trunk (with the leg-kick opening feature) and at least a soft-close frunk that gets pulled shut once the frunk is lowered."
"I'm curious how that new door opens, someone had said it slides but now that I see it im skeptical"
"You guys think it slides open? Dunno about that, looks more like it might pivot open vertically"
Don't like the lip thing. Matte black it's nice. I wrapped mine for that effect
Any before and after?
Love it because I just bought the old one :(
"Not sure why people don’t like the design. There’s way more premium materials with extended upholstery, far less flimsy plastic, a more integrated charger, and (hopefully) fixed door mechanism. Looks far more refined and premium. And, even appears to have less plastic than comparable BMW models 👀"
"Dammit, I knew I shouldn’t have ordered in 2018 /s"
"I have to say that I like both of them equally well. Hate the piano black, but wrapped (I’m doing mine in white this weekend) makes it just fine.  I’m curious how the door works and what the storage is like below, but I can see pluses on both versions"
This is so much cooler. I like it
"Soooooo, Where's the shifter?"
Happy to see the matte material. No idea where the piano black idea came from but it should not have made it into production.
So is this coming on new orders or is it something for the future ?
Oh good they realised people drive with the phone cover up all the time?
I really hope they can do a retro-fit of this because it's way nicer.
"I wonder if they’d do a screen upgrade later on. Maybe when MicroLED becomes a thing? So they could possibly add smaller/no bezels and 120hz like how a lot of TVs,Monitors,Phones,laptops are making 120hz standard in the future. Battery drain would be minimal for Tesla’s and we’d get to experience 120hz gaming when we supercharge or simply navigating."
Looking forward to the many piano black wrap upgrade threads
I like the current look more but that phone area may be better if it has a lip. My phone always kicks out on hard accelerations.
Did they also get rid of the corresponding piano black trim around the window switches and door opener button?
Does it come in white
I like the futuristic design more but this is cool
I personally love it more than the OG design.  Different strokes though 🤷🏼‍♂️
"Refining the design bit by bit

well done"
This is an improvement over the gloss black lid. However the original console in matte black is definitely cleaner and sleeker than this.
Ugh in a way I am glad I waited a bit to buy a model 3... But this all means I have to wait even longer. Le sigh
I don’t like it. I liked what we have now.
Is this real? Or just a concept...?
average
No more gloss black? FUCKING SOOOOOOOLD
Can only be opened from pressing a new button introduced in the screen.
That looks so good omg
Can you charge your phone in the center counsel?
So which software update will come with this?
So a 2009 C class
"Gosh, what an exciting post of an amazing and sumptuous interior. Thank you OP"
"OH MY GOD THIS IS INCREDIBLE!! THEY'VE DONE IT! THEY'VE REAAALLLLLLY DONE IT!!
People said it couldn't be done but here we were. Mind. Blown. 🤯"
Oh wow nothing is there how fancy!!
No me gusta... 🤢
It looks so cheap imo. Why should such an expensive car have so much plastic
"From what I'm seeing here, it's really basic, quite minimalistic too. Of course there is no spot for a shifter needed, but still, I don't get it why people overhype on this. The stitched leather and brushed aluminum is what you see in the basic higher-end vehicles. I'd certainly say a Volvo V90, at base coming at around 3,000 dollars more and even if it doesn't have the same performance, has an absolutely amazing interior, one full of nice details, and compared to the Tesla Model 3, is way better."
What’s the point of the crooked square that juts into the right cup holder?
"I love the simple and classic design concept but this is boring.
Tesla needs to fix their whole interior if they wanna compete after the Tesla hype is gone."
"Is this wrap-able? I'm having trouble imagining how someone would put a white wrap on it to match the white seats, for example. Perhaps just a failure of imagination on my part."
What about that white stitching?
That is better. My phone slides into the hole this will fix that.
Wonder if larger phones will wirelessly charge better than they do with the current setup.
Is this going to have that card issue where someone places their card within the slider and it getting lost or stuck underneath?
"This design is superior IF the lid slides and does not end up cutting off half of the whole space. I thought they would cut out most of the space for this design, but the cubby is just a shallow pit for the phone so the space under is still available. Very nice."
ermahgerd! ner cernserl!
I’m glad Tesla didn’t pay half of you to be designers. The other half has good taste.
"Man, I really really like this!"

"This looks better, imo"
"At the very least, I just hope this is a new trim option..."
"Its much better, thank god, I hate the piano black..."
Idk if I like it or not yet
Are they now going to offer a third interior color or is the color of the photo just off?
"Way more sensible. Much better refinement, too. Very nice."
Did they upgrade to a wifi charging dock?
I think that looks more in line with their S/X model.  I like that waaaaaaaay more than my Y.  Think it looks classy!
Fantastic improvement
Can I gtade mind out for the new one?
Dang this is nice
"remove  chrome from the outside, add more to the inside."
"Looks better. I think it’s about time Tesla do some tweaking with the 3/Y interior mainly for function’s sake. I still want some sort of display in front of my driving sight, maybe if they could put two screens or glass displays on both sides or something."
That’s a million times better than before.
Damn that is so nice
Sauce?
Breathe... Trust me
Revolutionary
"
Nice"
Looks fine to me. I like the stitching around the console.
Are the whompy struts fixed in all models now? Any updates?
Whats the difference?
I wonder if that can be retrofitted into existing models like the model Y.
"Big fcking deal wow lol, every little thing gets people exited here"
Tesla interior is straight garbage. As well as their paint.
Uh completely normal.
FUUUUUCKKKKK I just took delivery two weeks ago! I knew this would happen. I knew it.
Looks more luxurious I guess?
"Still to minimal IMO. I get that’s what Tesla is known for and designed for. But the only thing luxury about Tesla at this point is their price tag. Especially with Porsche coming out with their all electric vehicles for near the same price (model s and y), Tesla will have to do something to compete."

No evidence this is real. Doubt they’d refresh interior this soon. Would be more believable if they made center console matte instead of glossy. This is most likely fake.
RIP “close lid gently”
I would bet it pivots the same way as the current one?
The change looks entirely cosmetic to me. It even looks tilted up a bit in the photo.
This certainly looks more “ car” like

"I fucking hate piano black.

Worst automotive trend of the 2010s"
Are we sure this isn’t a pic of a [Chrysler Town & Country](https://pictures.dealer.com/o/odanielmotorsalescllc/1666/c8e2a8b2a2c9afe28f2e8e7258de50d6x.jpg?impolicy=downsize&w=568) that somebody is trolling us with?
Absolutely the wrap was the best $29 I ever spent.   It was easy to put on and got rid of the piano black.   Been on almost 2 years with 0 problems.
"I’m with you, I prefer the current version..."
In my country’s Tesla group there seem to be overly negative reaction. We Scandinavians love the minimalistic thou and this is less that.
"It made sense to get rid of the upper closing compartment lid. While my brother likes that for keeping his iphone completely out of sight while driving, he also doesn't keep his phone in a case.

For most owners that lid is just straight up superfluous, so I can totally see why Tesla got rid of the added complexity for the value it offered."
"I wonder if this was a reaction to all the legacy auto fans’ complains about the “non-luxurious” interior. Will have to see more pics of this but as of now, I really do prefer the old one, too."
"Ya I agree.. I don't like the rounded bottom of the wireless charging section.  I like the clean straight line.  But both honestly look good.  

Is it me or is the cupholder bigger now?   They need to add moulds that contract based on the cup size.   A lot of premium cars have those."
"I wish the piano black was a proper hard lacquer instead of cheap, scratch-friendly plastic.  IMO it only looked bad once it far-too-easily got damaged."
"Same. Prefer my current one but it is wrapped in white to match my seats.

Edit- the more I look at it, the more I very much prefer the current design.  Does the top phone part not have a door anymore at all?"
"What wrap did you use, if you don’t mind me asking? I want to do it but am afraid I’ll screw it up."
"I agree, the new one looks cheap to me."
"I carbon fiber wrapped mine, along with the center console and haven’t looked back. Love it."
"Same.  I hate the piano black (also got it wrapped) but I like the current design.

This new design kinda breaks the whole minimalistic feel of the M3 and MY.  Kinda makes it look like an older car too with the leather trim."
I would love the piano black if it didn’t get scratched by a speck of dust.
"Yeah, I normally get fomo pretty hard when new stuff comes out that I don't have on mine. (Dumb, I know) This time though, I'm glad I have the old one. :)"
"removing the top phone lid makes sense. It’s so much always open on mine that I ""discovered"" it again a week ago. ""Oh yeah right! That thing exist!""

Totally legitimate to redesign and remove."
I wrapped mine too - absolutely necessary IMO. Did it the first couple weeks I owned it. I did mine in a black brushed metal finish. Love the elimination of finger prints and the texture. Highly recommend. It was tedious to install but easy.
The cup holder definitely needed attention.
"Grab one of the rubber drop ins from evannex, fixes the cup holder for smaller drinks."
"I cant fit big drinks in there either, just throw my big bottle in the compartment in front of the cupholders as I'm sure many others do and just have to hear the bottle bang around after every corner I take, annoying."
Yeah agreed if only they changed the materials
Absolutely. This is a very sad and disappointing update.
Hell yes. This is a good design!
LOVE it!  Wondering how hard it would be to retrofit into my Y...
"Still looks simple and clean yet with the added depth and aluminum it looks so much more premium than before, love it!"
Any pic of this? Sounds great
"Same. Took delivery a month ago. There are some new features I'm sad I'm not getting, but this is one that made me happy I already bought."
Hopefully the white interior actually comes with white leather on the center counsel now. But... that’s probably wishful thinking.
"they mostly moved the chrome trim around, the main upgrade I’d say is the loss of the stupid piano black dirt magnet. But I dislike the loss of the door"
I wonder the if piano black is gone from the doors too?
Makes sense to keep the phone spot open. I literally never close mine.
agreed
"i use the phone holder for my Sunglasses, the lip charge pad bottom seems shallower in my new Y than my former 3, so this would have been an appreciated change."
This deserves it’s own post to get some traction and get this done but might get deleted.
There you go!  Much less Chrysler/Dodge-y.
"Wait, they are back?"
Previous design looks WAY cheaper.
"I think the overall aesthetic is still minimalist but this adds a little bit of refinement that will be well liked. As someone who has put three different wraps on my piano black, I really do like this look."
same
yes.
"I like the stitching and no piano black, but i agree. It looks like any other cheap car wanting to look premium."
"Agreed. Not happy since we still need to buy a Y in the future, and this looks terrible IMO."
What about after you look at it and it scratches?
Yes confirmation bias. Lol
the old one also looks very slick/minimalistic when completely closed. Plus everyone covers the pianoblack up anyway. Mine already looks like shit so I just put some matt covers on it from aliexpress. Looks similar to the refresh.
It looks exactly like the latest Chrysler style... in that it looks cheap.
Do it. The new console is fugly. Or buy barely used and save a ton of money at the same time.
"Get the old console but lose the heat pump, the power trunk and improved sound isolation? I say wait. I wish I hadn't taken delivery in September."
Most people have bad taste.
Crazy that a Chrysler design is an upgrade 😂
"I like the wood, only wish it didn’t look so obviously and hilariously fake."
Good enough for a trade in?
This is the real head scratcher...
You hit the what?
Even better if we could control let and right fan speed all the time
Head on over to /r/cars sometime....
"I think it's cool to see the discussion too, but lots of other brands would have it. Pretty much an luxury or sports car manufacturer had die-hards like Tesla that will debate this."

It doesn't? I have a Quadlock case on my S10 and it charges just fine in my 3.
That's a picture not a rendering.
no.
The current closing mechanism is atrocious. The fact that it needs to give you a notification to shut it gently...
chrome finish is tacky as fuck. so is shiny interior pieces. matte is always the way to go even if its white.
I think the answer to heated steering wheel is to just turn the heat on from your phone before you get in the car?

Old one looks way better. You got lucky IMO.
"The simplicity of simple lines and a monolithic console when everything is closed (or even if the phone door is open), was a very clean modern design. This removes the minimalist aesthetic and looks more busy like all other shitty domestic “luxury” autos. It looks terrible IMO."
"cant tell if trolling. no shifter needed, its a one speed transmission"
I love being able to put things like my airpods or wallet on the passenger side phone slot and close the cover so no one breaks in. I’m glad I have the original console. They should have just used a satin finish and tried to solve the stuff dropping in the door opening problem and kept the original design IMO.
"love getting downvoted for enjoying the way something looks on a car refresh, lol."
Real
"Because the high preformance electric car would cost more if it wasn't using plastic, battery is not as cheap as an engine."
Looks like the keycards resting there unevenly
That’s the key card
That’s the only functional thing I see that’s better
Just get a wrap or cover.
I picked up my 3 about 3 weeks ago and it has wireless qi charging dock for 2 phones. I believe this is a relatively new upgrade though
https://twitter.com/jstesla/status/1314739304770412545?s=21
"That was in the Model S and X, and the cars have had a couple significant suspension updates since the original design. No recall was ever issued and there’s still a debate as to how widespread it was.

Model 3/Y have had no significant reports of suspension breakage, although many feel it’s tuned too much for sport over comfort. I find mine perfect for a sport sedan."
This new console looks worse IMO.
Design looks cheaper IMO
what would you prefer...?
I hope so.
This is on an actual Model 3 that is being delivered
"Tbh, of all the attention to detail, this message won me over on day two.

I did a double take, and thought why would Elon's team put a sensor there?"
It's supposed to slide according to the rumors.
Rumors suggest it’s more like the Model S/X console that slides open. Not sure how I feel about it but it doesn’t matter as I won’t be getting a retrofit anytime soon.
"I actually kinda like the original lines better, it better mirrors the line on the dashboard. I think practically speaking the new one is better in that you won’t accidentally leave your phone in the car as often because it’s under a door. And no more piano black is a big plus though that’s wrappable"
"Thanks. It’s less minimalist, but more refined. I like it."
New one is notably worse
It looks like arm rest is further back? Or that must just be the illusion from the seats?
I hope the new one has some type of bottle grab pivots within the cup holders. I'm so annoyed with my bottles and cans always rattling.
"Yes this. If you rest your hand on the underside of the screen without taking your eyes off the road and make a quick glance to place your thumb on a button, the current bezel match’s a thumb length nicely right now. I thinner bezel would actually make this harder."
I steady my hand on the back of the screen actually
I’m on my third wrap... I dislike the piano black.
Nah it’s nice if you put PPF or something to protect it. It’s the scratching that gets to me.
"Includes the word *fucking*

**gets upvotes**"
The most crazy thing is that the key fob for VW id3 is piano black.
"Yeah I figure I will wrap mine once it gets ugly and scratched but so far no scratches at all. I’m only at 4 months ownership though. 

I like the new console look but obviously not a big deal. I’m wondering more if the headlight/taillight rumored change is true."
"Nah the worst design trend was using excessive plastic chrome trim. Piano black plastic looks good imu til you touch it, fake chrome looks gaudy and cheap."
Big agree!!!!
It sucks on pianos too! Gimme that sweet sweet carbon fiber baby grand
I knew something felt dodgey about that design... 🤔
Design inspiration
Pics? Can you link to the product and how you did it?
"100%. I love Scandinavian design, and the old design fits the Bill for modern and clean lines. This is horrendous IMO."
Yes it does make sense. 98% of the time the lid is up. Other 2% is when I’m bored at a red light.
Yeah my mom didn’t even know she had one in her Y. She bought the covers for the top to make them white and asked me what this other piece was for. I had to explain the phone part had a cover she just never puts it down.
"I wonder if the Jeda usb hub will still fit, and if there is still storage underneath though."
"When I think luxurious interior I think heated steering wheel, cooled seat, adjustable thigh support, blind spot monitoring built into mirrors, etc.

Not really center console redesign."
That’s a valid idea. I’m surprised it happened on the 3 before an S refresh. Though maybe there’s a massive S refresh planned around the time of the plaid launch (pun intended)
This honestly looks more “cheap” maybe it’s the angle I don’t know. But I don’t like it
Nope.  No top door. This change is a cost cutting effort.
"Abstract Ocean! They’re fantastic and will send you a replacement if you screw up. Take your time, watch the videos a few times, have plenty of light, and you’ll be just fine!"
"Yep, with ya. I’ll be getting a chrome delete for my birthday, so the only thing I’m sad about this time around are the heated charge ports. Though I rarely charge outside."
"I like leaving the lid closed unless I’m charging. It looks cleaner IMO. But, the rounded edges on the new one make the charging setup look very nice."
or get bigger drinks :)
"ehh, I slapped on a carbon fiber plastic cover on there and it looks and feels just as good as my Audi's carbon-fiber interior felt and looked. For only like $40 bucks too. I thought I would hate the m3 interior but I love this car since I've got it, haven't missed my auid since."
Here’s someone else’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/bam6cu/satin_white_console_wrap_on_white_interior/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) with the same thing
I'll be jealous in that case.
"Imagine the Performance Model 3 comes with red stitching/piping on white leather.

One can dream..."
I thought the door for the phone mount was neat. But mine is always open. Haven‘t closed it in two years.
I like closing mine to avoid getting distracted from my phone's notifications and on hot days where the sun's beating down on the phone and I feel like wireless charging is struggling.
I literally can’t sit in my car if it’s open. It makes me crazy when my wife takes her phone out and leaves it open. It’s an OCD nightmare.
"I was trying to figure out what you meant, because I forgot our Y has a lid there that closes. 😂"
"Good idea

https://reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/j8ngx5/for_those_who_dont_like_the_new_center_console/"
"Yeah just saw an article two days ago

I agree so maybe I’ll take some downvotes with you but the stitched leather vs hard plastic is a definite upgrade in materials.
"How soon though? Would it stand to reason that these changes are already in production for the Y as well in this new production cycle? It would make sense if this is one of the parts that are shared between the two, and from what I've seen it seems they are."
"I've had my m3 for 7 months, not a single scratch on it 🤷‍♂️"
"It’s more that you get an extra door that you can choose to hide the phones or not hide them. So I suspect this is largely to cost cut that door out along with the magnets and whatnot. The lines don’t match the dash line as well on the new console.

I’m honestly much more curious when the tweaked 2170 batteries reach production"
Pretty sure most used are close to new in price. Some owners took big tax credits from certain states like Colorado and are probably selling for a profit
I talked to a Tesla body shop yesterday and they don't see the new laminated glass yet in their system. They said to call back in two weeks. Might be an easy upgrade for a few hundred bucks.
Most people think everyone else has bad taste.
The wood on the dash? It’s not fake.
"Hahaha.  I have been waiting for the stealth to come out again.  4K more than AWD and 4 less than perf.

Also i can have same payments or lower because I’d so much for my trade...though that may drop now."
No
"Shit, I’m a mess"
"Man, not even a 20oz bottle will stay put? That kinda sucks, actually."
[deleted]
"Oh sorry, let me just rephrase my question: did someone change their interior to this or is this something that tesla will do?"
"Probably saves some money not needing a fancy canbus connected magnetic switch there, lol"
Yeah. I think that might be a more worthy change than even gloss black which you can at least wrap.
"You do not know elegant or classy. Chrome finish and piano black look amazing. 

The dull matte finish looks like bland shit. The black border without chrome looks muted and meh. Compare a blue X with awesome chrome finish next to a blue Y with muted finish. Ugh....

I'm glad my 3 has both. And I wanted the chrome for Y. Shame."
">ity isn’t the best and bent rims are not an if but a when. That also reminds me how badly I want adaptive damping (not air suspension) and believe it should be standard on both 3 and Y. Not everyone wants a punishing ride 24/7. Adaptive dampers are a cheap (relatively) way to increase ride quality and are used on everything from Honda Civic Si/Type-R, VW GTI/Golf R, Honda Accord Touring, BMW 3/4/5/6/7/8, Alfa Giulia/Stelvio, etc. There’s not a single luxury sedan or SUV on the market doesn

he doesnt want to use internal heat. In subtropical climates you dont really need the heating but it does go cold enough that a heated steering wheel would be nice as fingers can get a bit clammy"
"I can see why people don't like the piano black, but the original design just looks so much better."
"Actually, there is a “shifter”, it’s the stalk. Of course it’s not a manual transmission, but transmission control is just not located on the center console. :-)"
"Ye, just trolling. Prolly shoulda put a /s."
"Ye, just trolling. Prolly shoulda put a /s."
"Real, as in you custom made this, or real as in Tesla is doing this?"
Doesn’t cost much to put a few square feet of nicer material.
Right on! Thanks for the info good Sir!
Any word on if these are being produced in the us now? I have an order in for November
Sensor to turn off the light in the cubby
"> why would Elon's team put a sensor there?

User testing! I guarantee that *every single person* who interacted with that thing before they put the sensor in got intensely frustrated until they figured out how to close it properly."
Money
Unlikely IMO due to the curvature of the end towards the screen.
Just need to wait for it to hit the parts catalog something tells me it all bolts the same
"Who closes the door while their phone is in there? Or ever, for that matter?!"
"Yes, used to make a nice little ‘T’, didn’t it? But I can see how this is more practical."
"For me, it means my dream of replicating the [prototype](https://imgur.com/a/bRzhITe/) from 2017 is dead 😞. Oh well, change is the only constant in the universe."
"I love Teslas but the one thing I secretly despise about the interior is the minimalism. In a world of screens, I really just want some real buttons to control things, especially A/C and music."
"But they could still make smaller bezels on the other sides, right? My computer screen for example only has 1 larger bezel which is the bottom one."
"That's why I don't like full touchscreen, I like to have some real buttons."
Does the wrap wear off because it’s a high contact area?
It’s not the scratching so much as the dirt and fingerprints...
[deleted]
It's nice if you replace it!
whats PPF?
This.
"Oh my god that's awful, I can only imagine what it's look like after just a day in my pockets!"
"Fake chrome has improved over the years though, or at least on European cars it has whilst piano black has remained horrendous."

"It's the opposite for me.  Closed 98% of the time, open only if it's a long trip and my phone is low."
I think I had my car a few months before I even realized it folded down.
I've actually found a use for it. You can very easily put empty koozies back there.
It really seems that the model 3 and Y production lines are more adaptable
"I don't know why it took until now to want it, but I suddenly crave a plaid interior plaid model S."
It does look less futuristic and more like legacy autos. Guess people weren’t ready for the minimalism. https://i.imgur.com/c122jQl.jpg
"Remove door, add vegan leather trim. I doubt the the net is a savings."
Do you have a link? I hate most of the stickers I got but a nice solid snap on would be cool.
It’ll be okay. I’m here if you need someone to talk to.
I went out to the car to go check this. I had no idea it had a lid that closes.
"Weird decision. On the other hand I don’t know how trustworthy that article is. Maybe Tesla simply found an old stock and used them up and someone thought they are back now, even though they aren’t?

Or maybe it’s an updates version. Missing information here..."
"If I can do the powered trunk, the better insulation and the heat pump all as chargeable upgrades but keep the current console, I'll be a happy camper."
Then how do they manage to make real wood look so obviously fake?!
"No worries, guess you were gassed when you made this post."
"To be fair, it is a lot more narrow than most bottles."
"What exactly do you mean by printed space? I'm curious about what the problem is. I wanna be clear I don't mean this with a bad tone, I do wanna know what's wrong."
Oh okay! This is a refresh from Tesla.
"preference is preference. everyones is difference so if you like piano black and chrome thats your choice, i personally do not like it."
finger prints are very gross & having to constantly wipe down your center console is pretty annoying
Tesla did this
" material cost is one thing, installation and warranty on the meterial is another. Plastic is just so easy to work with and manufactur in mass."
"Right. Every car has this, except for most other cars it’s just a dumb switch."
"I might be the odd one out. I found it immensely hard NOT to close it properly. The magnet is very strong, so it clicks into place very affirmatively.

It's also a bit hard to open as a result of the strong magnet."
I literally almost turned around on my drive home from the dealer because I thought it was a click system and didn’t know it was a magnet. Lmao.
"Well it does slide just like a Model S or Model X center console so, it isn’t unlikely."
"However, the top part that opens to allow access to the space below and the USB ports?   What happens with the ports, I assume they must come forward somehow but we have no clue about the wiring."
"Ha! I had to inflate the tires the other day and was looking all over for the 12v outlet and came across the door.  ""WTF is this?"", I thought, not remembering that it even existed."
"I keep mine closed unless I am driving and I have my phone on there.  Minute my phone is removed, closed. I love having the ability to close that spot off."
I did the other day and forgot my phone in the car when I got home. Phone needed some charge. I try to keep from being distracted while driving so I closed it.
I do
"with a black iphone, i forget it in my car at least 1x a week even with the lid open (dark garage)"
Me. I mounted a magnet on the underside of the flip door.  Another magnet is on the back on my ipad mini case. It fits on top of the door perfectly and my phone provides hotspot. Great for trips.
"Well, we use the wireless charging and on hard acceleration with the door open there’s a tendency for the phones to slide down. Less of a problem if you have the cable dock and don’t launch your car super hard or corner super hard"
You can alway buy a used one.
Oh wow that UI has changed
I've got white wrap and white interior. It is great!
"Hey, I replicated it accidently on my y with this [center console kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V45ZYWN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and this [arm rest cover](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000236567185.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.39504c4dvnbMnD)."
"Everyone has a preference. For me, that minimalism is what made me instantly want one. Two years in and I still love it."
"You can control both through the steering wheel. Curious if you own one or not because I think once you’ve had the chance to set the car up how you want, it’s rare that you ever need to do anything with the touch screen."
"I thought is miss those two things too but I don’t, because volume on the steering wheel is a scroll wheel and touch and slide works fine for HVAC. 

The windshield wiper controls, OTOH, could be much better."
"Seriously? The only music controls I need while driving is the volume control and that is on the wheel as with any other car. AC, I have not change the temperature or fan positions, well hell I cannot recall.  
  
I tell my friends this, go put a sticky on each button in your car. ALL of them; you may find forty or more!  Then each time you use a new button you can remove the sticky.
   
In a world of automatic climate control, lamps, and such, I do little more than drive and enjoy it far more with so few distractions.
  
Regardless, muscle memory works on screens too and if you want to get really silly you can let the car drive while you get confused by one of the best UIs in the industry."
"A shame you’re downvoted but I agree. I love the car and actually like minimalist design in almost all aspects. They just went a *tiny bit* too far in the Model 3 I think. A couple of tactile buttons for the HVAC (and a real button to open the glovebox) would not ruin the minimalism and would make the vehicle nicer to use. Most other things can stay on the screen but I use the HVAC controls basically every time I get in a car, easily more often than any other controls. And voice controls don’t work great if you have a car full of noisy people with music blaring, or have an accent other than “typical American”.

Real buttons need to make a comeback - you can feel them and use them without looking and you know when a press has registered. Touch screens just can’t give you that.

The lack of a dash in front I’m still not sure about. Sometimes I think “yeah, it’s ok I can get used to this”, but other times I’d appreciate having a little info in front of me. Some kind of projected HUD that you can use optionally would be nice."
You can use the voice command to set the temperature. Same with music. It’s not too bad
They are on the steering wheel and voice control.
"Yeah it would be nice if they took the approach of the Algato Streamdeck... buttons that have their own LCD screens, so they can change on the fly. That would actually be amazing!"
I’ve had the same wrap for almost 2 years now. No signs of wear
"Mate, the moment you even attempt to remove those fingerprints, it bloody scratches.

If I *look* at my center console wrong, it scratches. Madness."
"Could be small things that rub on it, depending where it is. But for me it must have been when I vacuumed around it. I thought the brush head I used was soft, but sure enough I scratched it anyways."
Take a bright light to it and check again. I’d be genuinely surprised if there aren’t any swirls.
I was going to say the same thing. Mine is wrapped but not because of scratches or fingerprints. I was bored during lockdown back in Apr/May so I ordered the kit.
my wife's diamond rings scratch everything within a 10-foot radius of wherever she waves her hands around. D=
"Scratches aren't the problem, fingerprints and smudges are."
"My wife tosses her purse on the console, and drags it off - metal buckles and all. Pure cringe. 

I need to wrap it."
They must have put one hell of a protective coating of something on it. I took a side gig detailing brand new cars at a dealership a few years back. The piano black on the cars would literally get scratched from a CLEAN microfiber towel if you put any moderate amount of pressure on the cloth. Best you could do was go straight up and down so you at least don't make swirl marks.
"Hands, and skin. Skin scratches it. Breathing on it scratches it. A aideways glance out of the peripheral vision sratches it. The air blowing from the AC scratches it. Dust mites and naval lint scratches it. 
You must of been one of the lucky ones that got
the rocket stainless steel prototype center console."
Literally anything
I made the mistake of vacuuming it.  Scratched like crazy.
Ooo look at me I'm thr 99th centile of godliness I haven't scratched mine so it dosnt happen to anyone.
Mine holds napkins and extra masks. My phone is mounted by the screen with a magnetic wireless charger.

"I don't think the heat pump can be an aftermarket option, too many down stream changes would be needed. The trunk and laminated glass will appear, not sure if OEM or aftermarket but I am sure they will happen. I know there is an aftermarket trunk today but having it integrate into the software properly is worth waiting for something closer to OEM. On the window piece, from what I see the laminated glass is only the front driver and passenger window, so it is just two replacements. That is typical unless you're in a real luxury car where all the windows are laminated."
Did you see a wrap instead?
[deleted]
"I already love it, the piano black was a fingerprint magnet apparently. I don't understand why they haven't refreshed the model s and x though, its been since about 2016 or somewhere around there"
"Yup, totally agree. Just wish they kept the original design / layout and just made the plastic matte"
"Real as in Tesla did this in an actual car, or Tesla did this very realistic render of what it could be?

/s"
"A magnetic sensor (which I think Tesla uses) is more reliable than a mechanical switch that eventually wears out. Not sure it’s really concern statistically, but it does happen on older cars that switches wear out. On my 94’ Audi 100 the door/off/on light switch just fell out of the roof on a bumpy winter road. Car was around 17 years old at the time, but still."
"You must have a broken one, lol. Or maybe you're like, exceptionally weak? Because I would not consider the storage compartment to be even remotely close to ""difficult"" to open or incorrectly close."
"Care to show me proof that it slides? Not saying you're wrong, but you're claiming it does for a fact and nobody has yet to show proof."
That's pretty much me. I never close that door. Just seems pointless.
"The 12V is truly in the dumbest place imaginable. Can't even use most accessories with the tray still in place, or at the very least you need to remove it to plug/unplug stuff. Really hope that's fixed with the new console."
"What do you need access to an iPad for while driving, especially in a Tesla?"
"Yeah, I think the current center console comes out with six bolts."
"Oh man, this is weird, Apollo didn’t tell me about your message, saw it as unread when I logged into desktop. Thank you so much for sharing those! I will definitely be getting them."
You can control the AC through the steering wheel on a 3?
I have a model 3. 50k miles in and I do want a more buttons. It’s a pain to switch stations or go from radio to streaming to audio book. Rather have a dedicated fav button for that.
"Yeah I’m curious if you own one or not because I’ve had the car for 2 years and it’s got one of the least flexible, least usable (while driving), and *definitely* least customizable interface out of all the new cars in the segment.

Hell, the iDrive 2 system from a 2007 BMW with the capacitive buttons have far better customizability than a 2020 Model 3’s control. The very fact I have to tap the screen *more than once* to navigate to a saved location is infuriating."
Some things just dont work well with the touch screen. Anything you need to tap with precision is challenging when on any road with slight bumps. I prefer my BMW interface i had before getting my 3.
I don’t own but I’ve rented a few times for vacations and such. I understand you can control some things with the wheel but it’s just not the same. I’d also like my copilot to have the same functionality without trying to figure out a screen (i.e. my mom).
I refuse to talk to my damn car while I just want to drive alone in my thoughts. (And slightly more cold.)
The scratches are very easy to get out. Just rub them with your thumb.
just wrap it - DIY for $30 - pro will do it for $100. Its money well spent

First world problems.
It's almost like diamonds are really hard and your wife is a clumsy hand waver :)

You shouldn’t talk about your wife like that!"
my napkins go in the little napkin shaped bucket tray under the leather lid
"Why not just place your phone in the built in

What mount do you have?
My roommate in 09 had a gti with plaid seats and I've been a fan ever since.
"Very aware of what it is, just using Tesla’s official description of their seating and steering wheel material."
Vinyl is a different plastic.
Is that the only changes on the glass? No change to the roof? I was hoping the heatpump would be easy since I have the new frunk.
"Huh? I mean it looks (and feels like) plastic, from the factory."
"*Oh!* I didn't realize you weren't referring to the wireless charger. Yeah, that original phone dock was garbage. I much agree."
"ooh i'm sorry i read your comment wrong i thought you said ""cant understand"" rather than ""can understand"""
"It rolls down hills, too."
They took the effort to wire the switch up the CAN bus. When they could have just connected the light to it and call it a day.
My 2007 VW Polo trunk opening button / microswitch failed. And that’s a common problem. But why would VW care? Long out of warranty and now they can sell an overpriced part for 50€ or so.
"Not difficult, just a bit stiff."
"Design intent. No reason to put a raised silver grip on it if it flips open, as that accent would be functionally useless. The design indicates that it slides forward underneath the phone charger."
Some have two more screws to remove.
Spoken commands
Being able to customize the bottom bar with *any* desired function would go a long way.
"What BMW iDrive had capacitive touch in 2007? It was iDrive 2 at the time but the capacitive buttons didn’t show up for a few more years on the 3er. But you’ve said this with such certainty and specificity that I assume you have something in mind, the 7 series maybe?

I don’t disagree with your comment about the comparison to Tesla, I just am genuinely curious or if maybe you were thinking of a later year."
Hahha behave!
"Aaah damn, I set myself up for that one!"
Hahaha totally.
You mean talking about scratched center consoles on a Tesla?
"She would agree that she should probably be bubble wrapped, for her own protection."
A square box of Kleenex fits perfectly into the large opening while two pairs of sunglass cases slide right under the phone charger.
"1. No wireless charger
2. I use Waze, Pandora, and/or YT Music. With no CarPlay/AA, I want the phone by screen so my eyes/fingers don't go far from the road when using phone."
Because there isn’t a built in wireless charger for most of us
"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088FJF6K3/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_9rHGFbSFCVVM8

Prior to this one I had a Xvida mount that well with suction on back of screen, but I like that the above one let's you put any ball/socket mount on it."
"Roof is already laminated glass. I have the new frunk too but I just can't imagine how they would do an aftermarket install of the heat pump. I could be wrong, there are many mad scientists in the Tesla world. The heat pump is not one I am going to be hopeful about."
Whatever. It’s wood. Oh well.
It's real real center console.  You can touch it.  It's gonna change the world.
"Yeah, but l think Tesla has a huge case of FOMO on new ideas. If it doesn’t have a digital interface/is controlled by a computer it’s not going in. 

Plus it gives them (or could, at least) stats on actual consumer behavior. If users don’t use a feature they can drop it in future products and save money on every one they make. $2 saved on 100,000 vehicles every year adds up. The more you shave off the merrier."
Everything has to go to the BUS as there’s no fuse box to protect the wiring.
"I once had temp at Audi accidentally sell me a button at internal cost, paid $4 for a switch and $5 for a blind cover. I later had to replace a similar switch and paid $47 for it."
"This, the previous design did not have that grip."
Oh. Duh.
My 2007 E92 335i had it.
"> Plus it gives them (or could, at least) stats on actual consumer behavior. If users don’t use a feature they can drop it in future products and save money on every one they make.

Guaranteed they have metrics on tons of things like this that we don't even know about because it doesn't have any sort of visual notice like the flip door."
I think that’s exactly why the refresh doesn’t have the door to hide the phones anymore. They looked at the stats of how many people closed the door and decided it wasn’t worth it as a feature + wiring.
Nice. That sucks.
2007? Are you sure? Was it retrofit?
Agreed. In the last year I've closed mine once when I left my SO's phone to get charged while we were shopping.
"I use the door to hide my phone because I listen to YouTube while driving and charging my phone. Since the screen stays on when YouTube is playing, I hide my screen while I drive to avoid being visually distracted by the screen. That's the only use I can think of for the door."
"Not as much as paying $200 for this part from Audi and later learning I could have gotten it for $30 from a third party. It’s one of those parts you usually only can get from Audi, so I never bothered to look. \*cries in hindsight*

https://i.imgur.com/K5Q7CDP.jpg"
"Yeah I’m sure, it’s not retrofit. It looked like the row of buttons here: https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/aR39xWyxjns2B1YvKXcHoMbkNU5_UvE5geVF3ILONOVmAiQYI4ecd99gpEDAqj3lh7wQ67FdncM4ZR-hCGsRBqTDDBLVAZ3SRFvGT95-a3n62-JFWuxEbG_fDyU__EYodaAaMA

But apparently not all of the pictures had them, maybe it’s a package/option/market thing? I’m in the US if it makes a difference."
"Ouch, what a ripoff.

The worst thing is: Compare such things to parts from BMW and other ""more premium"" manufacturers and you'll find that the VW stuff is comparatively cheap -.-"
"I totally forgot about that! As I recall, you could program those buttons for *anything*, not just a radio station but a completely different screen. 

I didn’t realize that was a 2007 change (we didn’t have it in ‘06 E90). I remember being envious but I thought it was a couple years later. :-)"
"Yeah, and they are capacitive touch too, if you just put your fingers on them without pressing down, the iDrive screen would quickly bring up a contextual menu telling you what it was programmed for, it was brilliant."
Looks like the North Charlotte Supercharger
Would a wrap like this not get all banged up and torn by dirt and rocks? Curious did you take a look to see if the wrap was in tact?
What a coincidence if it really happened like that
Take any pictures of the car?
I really really like the look of this.
I don’t think I realized there was a supercharger over there!
r/spotted
Always cool spotting a Tesla Youtuber in the wild. I met Dærik here in Colorado omw back from CA. He was on his way out to LA for this racing event.
"Haha, he lives in one of my friend's neighborhoods. I see him all the time in public, he's a nice guy."
"Finally a proper SUV haha, is it lifted or just new tyres?"
What color is this?
Oh I’ve seen that one in NC once.
Lift a 3 and I can’t tell if it’s a 3 or a y.
Sorry but that thing looks awful IMO.
Yep!
Thought I saw that Y up in Mooresville a week or two ago.
I saw the [Dale Earnhardt Model 3](https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar-fan-turns-tesla-dale-224233954.html) there a while back too.
Man do we have an owners meet in the CLT area?  I know it's covid time but I'd be down to stand in a parking lot in the cold and drink coffee or something
Better to replace the wrap than having to repaint the car. I am having mine wrapped this weekend to help protect it a bit from the winter gravel that has destroyed the paint on all my previous cars.
"Yes.  The idea is that the wrap serves as protection for the clearcoat and paint beneath it.  I've used both vinyl wraps and plastidip coatings for that purpose, to great result."
"
He got an extra thick rap for that reason. It's in one of his videos"
my guess is that they pulled up a i1tesla video specifically for this reddit video.
That video is too old for that.

Teslarati calls it a cobalt green
Agreed
Use that charger all the time!!!
I saw him not too long ago on north Tryon.
Saw it at the street side chargers on south Blvd a couple months ago
"A friend with a model 3 and my husband with our X used to go to [Cars and Coffee.](https://m.facebook.com/Cars-and-Coffee-Charlotte-131205780279743/) It isn’t just Tesla owners, but there were a few other Teslas too."
How much is your wrap costing you?
Painting is cheaper.
You guys are getting clearcoat?
Wraps are a lot thinner than PPF. If the goal is solely to protect the paint PPF will do a much better job.
"That's neat, didn't realize that was a thing. I imagine there probably significantly more expensive?"
The extra ‘thickness’ is the material. 3M Matte vinyl has dual color layers. I wouldn’t go two coats of vinyl because that’s just asking for moisture bubbles to form.
I’m not sure why anyone would think that’s not what happened to be honest.
Best comment
That’s just a still from the video
"Woah, so pretty."
I've been to cars and coffee but it's a little big for me.  I like the little supercharger meets.  :)
"By me, greater philadelphia area, starting at $3,000 for a single color wrapped Model 3."
CAD $2498.00 to get it all professionally wrapped Matte white using 3M vinyl.
not if you have to keep repainting :)
"No, that's not the case... at least not in this context.

* Standard vinyl wraps, such as 3M 1080, are ~0.35mm in thickness at most.
* Standard PPF films, which are polyurethane -- in this case using 3M Scotchgard as a reference -- are ~0.15mm for the base, ~0.2mm when including the adhesive itself, and ~0.28mm when including the liner -- in almost every case less than ~0.3mm in total.  Even the SunTek Ultra Defense is only 11.5mil (~0.29mm).  Only Vito Irmen approaches 0.4/0.5mm with their films.
* Plastidip, when properly sprayed with 4-5 even coats, yields an application ~10-12mils thick, or roughly 0.3mm.  I applied twelve coats when I needed offroad durability in addition to aesthetics.  It was cheaper, more resilient, and more flexible in application than the other options. (edit: my result was roughly 1.2mm in thickness)

"Isn't the main cost of wrap the labor and not material. With what he is doing, I doubt it makes a difference."
The guy has expel stealth ppf under the wrap.. double wrapped insanity and it still didn’t protect him from a tree
yeah i thought it was pretty obvious
"> That’s just a still from the video 

yes that's the joke"
Damn thought it looked familiar
r/whooosh
Username checks out
It would be cheaper to just repaint the front of the car.
What about having to keep re-wrapping?
I had no idea you even could Plastidip an entire car body. That’s awesome!! Thanks for the shared sources
A vinyl wrap is NOT 3.5mm thick. That’s like 35 sheets of copy paper. Your link below says 110 microns with adhesive which is 0.11mm. So PPF films are thicker.
Correct. You can pay $500-1k CAD and have enough material to do it myself depending on the wrap you get. Will I do remotely as good a job as the guys I’m paying to do this? Lol I didn’t even put the registration sticker straight!
lol I don’t think anything would protect you from a tree.
How is that a joke lol? I get what ur saying but you’d be surprised on reddit and if that’s a joke cool just don’t make it so dry and obvious... im not I’m my 30s wearing thick framed glasses being a piece of shit on the internet so yeah whoosh
So that’s a joke? a still from the video.... Maybe I don’t understand lame old guy humor I guess. And by your response it’s more telling that ur a douche more so I can’t get a “joke”
"Yeah, I was looking at the 3 with rims and wrapping it.... but the new rims are quite, bleak. So I may just go caps with a color instead."
"I doubt that, not with the same factory quality anyway."
it's more durable against chips and swirl marks
"You just re-wrap the panel that’s damaged for a fraction of the cost of painting. Heck it can be rewrapped in an hour sometimes depending on the panel. Painting you are looking at a couple of days if you want it done correctly.

If it’s a major panel they also would sand it down to smooth it, that ends up weakening the panel over time."
"Yo!  Go check out the DipYourCar channel on YouTube.  Fonzie and their crew have fantastic instructional videos and try out cool things like thermochromic pigments and other unique finishes.  It really is underrated.

Edit: sort their videos by most popular to find the good stuff quickly"
".35mm not 3.5mm. Decimal places, decimal places!"
"Yes, I misplaced the decimal.  That's fixed.  The 1080 series in particular has a minimum base application of 90 microns (0.09 mm) and a standard applied maximum of 0.35mm.  Even accounting for my error, it's not fair to say that PPF is thicker.

1.  This entire post references a Model Y which used a dual-application vinyl wrap, which is roughly twice the thickness of a standard layer (edit: which will therefore effectively be between 0.4mm and 0.9mm in total -- this is twice to four times that of a PPF film).
2.  In my initial comment, I said I had used both vinyl and Plastidip for this same purpose, and with the latter achieving a depth of ~1.2mm.  PPF will not approach that."
Practice makes perfect just buy a lot of extra material
That’s my point you can protect it all you want but there is only so much that can be protected. The cost of replacing Xpel is about the same it cost to repaint the panel!
I'm gonna assume you're not trolling. If i were you I would just quit the internet now; you are really not ready for it
"""factory quality""

Sorry, had to."
"So like little kid watercolors or some other shitty oem paint,  tiny little mosquito dicks at 30mph scratch the soft jello ass paint????   The wrap will not only last but can be easily be repaired in sections by rewrapping each individual panel.  I put 40k on a car in two years and the wrap still looked fine a year after I sold it.  Maybe not for everyone, and not permanent, but it's definitely not as bad and temporary as the actual oem paint, which is atrocious.   I worked at Honda assembly and would have been fired for sending out a car with such bad paint and panel alignment as the model 3 I took ownership of, and yet I love my car , fixed my panel alignment myself, and just deal with rockchips until I(the wife) decide what color it's going to be."
I tried plastidip on my rims a year ago. It came out terrible on the first try but I emailed Fonzie asking for advice and got a reply 15 min later. 2nd try worked perfect and Im now a fan.
Yep!  That's my bad.  It's fixed.  (It was a typo.)
Yeah I plan to learn how in case I have to redo a piece.
Yeah if I were you I would just quit life lol.. you’re a piece of shit
Out of curiosity how much would it cost to replace a section
"Yeah, the DYC guys are awesome.  And the devil is definitely in the details when applying plastidip, particularly if you're using special pigments or finishes, or covering a complex surface like wheels."
"Nah dude, you seem unable to accept that essentially everyone here is telling you that you have missed the joke, yet you’re insisting that you couldn’t have been wrong. 

This was very easy to detect blunt humor."
"I had paid 250 for the front bumper of my Chrysler 300, grabbed a curb and tore the factory bumper loose.  It was nice to grab an aftermarket unfinished bumper and have it wrapped with not much prep required, total time to swap bumper and wrapped was like 2 hours.  I think they kinda work under the guise that they get you on labor the first go around, and do little things to keep you happy until they rape you on the next full rewrap.   It was also a bit more than 3k in my area for the chrysler, closer to 5500 iirc.  This is at the most expensive and well known shop in my area, however.  For those curious, material cost are close to 300 for a model 3.  If you'd like to try yourself, id recommend buying a cheap console wrap kit on amazon, getting frustrated at the application, and then imagining the difficulty of doing the whole car."
"Everyone here? What two people? Lol ok yeah.... wow

“Oh you want a photo, hah heres your photo haha it’s a still from the video how you like that haha”  

Thats not a joke doucheface, how lame do you have to be to think that’s clever or funny? More so me responding to you being a dick then me “not catching” that that was supposed to be a “joke”. You clearly have a lot of time on your hands which is pathetic so just let it go old timer. Leave the jokes to people who actually have a sense of humor"
"That’s not bad, I like the idea of wrapping more and more after your comment. With regards to doing it yourself, I don’t need to try it on the console because I’ve already failed to put a screen protector on my iPhone without bubbles about 20 times. #neveragain"
I can manage those all day.   A console vinyl wrap had me damn near suicidal 4 sweaty hours and 12 beers in.  Kinda like window tint but 10x the difficulty.
"I at least appreciate Daimler's honesty, but it just shows they can't think outside the box. They believe business problems have business solutions. Tesla has shown that sometimes business problems have engineering solutions. Better technology makes products cheaper, safer, and of higher quality."
I'm convinced.  Selling all my TSLA holdings and buying Daimler stock
"Don't wanna be 'that guy' lol but that was part of the Battery Day presentation, not the Shareholder Meeting.

*ducks*"
"I think the shareholders want to know about markets, sales and breakeven point etc."
"Who runs automotive companies these days?

Tesla: autist engineer, meme lord

Others: presentation clowns, MBA elites"
"Engineering vs MBA.

MBA = Masters in Bullshit Art

And if you’ve ever met MBAs, bullshitting is quite the art.

Wall Street analysts learn to interpret MBAs, but when you actually give actionable data, they are like deer in headlights."
"I always love to see random redditors deride Elon as not being an engineer.

He's the biggest nerd ceo of all time. (Including debating about stupid topics he knows nothing about online, lol). But it's always refreshing to hear him speak because there are specific details and policies, even if some never come to pass. Less marketing language."
Wow....the douche called their employees legacy headcount.  That means people close to retirement will be let go.
"Tesla's battery event was not an investor presentation. Compare the actual investor meeting before Battery day, and the Daimler presentation looks amazing."
You're comparing battery day presentation not the shareholder presentation.  Tesla's shareholder presentation was a train wreck.
"Anyone mentioned yet about Daimler being a very early investor in Tesla, hence why the Model S shares many components with some Mercedes.... so don’t bash them too hard, they believed in Tesla when everyone else didn’t."
This comparison between the two is hilarious but it goes to show you that legacy automakers are going to have a very rough time if they hope to survive the transition to EVs.
"“We have a head count we need to address”

Y’all getting fired for working hard for Daimler

0:06 and 0:46 pick one or the other Mr. Daimler"
"Everytime ""increasing"" is not in the same sentence as ""headcount"", that means layoffs. Gl middle and working-class of Daimler."
This is hilarious
"""We have legacy headcount issues we need to adress"". 

It's called laying off people who were driving your profits all these years until management decided to disregard electric vehicles."
"Tesla doesn’t use MBB! The difference shows, and we love the tech in your face approach. 
Daimler’s presentation looks like a bunch of MCKinsey slide titles read to the camera. Too much MBA bullshit, not enough substance"
"That’s because the ice market is saturated and ice technology is already as developed as it can be (unless you are trying to push the boundaries like koenigsegg or Bugatti might try and do, which Daimler’s most definitely isn’t doing)

Daimler is slowly realizing that the only way to “provide share holders with more value” is not with car sales. Lol.

They either electrify or go bankrupt."
No bullshit from Elon musk. That's why he is so successful
Engineering vs business mindset. I notice that Tesla is thinking more in a supply chain management mindset. We can see which one is growing faster
"What most people seam to miss is that Daimler has investors that actually count on getting something back from their investments, within a REASONABLE time.

Tesla has managed to get investors to continue to treat them like a startup and not demand a return on their investment. But at some point their demands will come, and then the question will be if Tesla manages to  keep doing their fancy public shows.

The same thing is true for Tesla owners, nowhere else would people buy a consumer product (FSD) and still after 4 years not get what they paid for. For anything else there would be massive lawsuits, but not Tesla.

I like what Tesla has accomplished for the whole EV market but I think other companies are getting to much unfair criticism. Simply because no other company could go to their investors and say ""we are going to stop giving you a return on your money for the next 10 years"".

Just wait and see, when Teslas investor eventually come knocking, then Tesla will be like everyone else.

Edit: Corrected the years since FSD launched, thanks for the feedback."
"Our product complexity is excessive. So we plan to introduce multiple new architecture that are not even fully EV and launch multiple new models in the next couple years. Like 4 different SUVs.

Also, our legacy car will be even more profitable because we will fire lots of people."
We’re cutting back on today vs. here’s what tomorrow looks like.
"I think Daimler was being fairly straightforward, but every time I hear marketing jargon in an investor meeting, I think the [Jabberwocky project from Better Off Ted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spyJ5yxTfas)"
You need spreadsheet warriors behind the scenes. Not in front of the camera.
What is the actual intended takeaway here?
Marketing guy and the engineering guy

Honk!!
This is the difference between a company run by business people vs engineers
"Are you trying to tell me that a German, ultra serious, corporate type guy is more serious during their presentations than an on the spectrum, Silicon Valley, eccentric, Steve Jobs, type guy? No way!"
One of these presentations really required a PR team.
The entire car industry is an example of how if you don't disrupt yourself someone will do it for you.
"That's the difference between a company driven by:

 product and engineers vs marketing and MBAs.

The dumbest people I've met in my life are people that went to ""business"" school."
"Something slightly negative is posted.  Mods we need proof, last 4 of your social, mother's maiden name, etc.

Something positive is posted breaking a rule (No Low Quality Content). Mods = no near to be found on sight."
"This is why I was all in on Andrew Yang. He wanted to be the first prez to give a state of the union address with a PowerPoint stack. Super cool things :,)"
“... and creates value for our shareholders” well there’s your problem sir - if that’s your premise of existence you’re not gonna go anywhere
"It's quite honestly the contrast between Startups and Corporations.

It's just such a sad theater on Daimler site
"I've always thought that one day Telsa will buy Daimler for their coach building expertise.

Looks like the odds of that being an option are going up..."
"This is the battle of the century between the Engineers and the MBAs.

It’s about time that the bean counters served the inventors. It’s been the other way around for far too long."
MBA corporate suits are stuck in their ways. Their conservative approach to solutions is diminishing and hurting their companies; just look at Intel. New blood is badly needed throughout the corporate world.
"Cars are the least evolved products over the last century. Televisions, phones, airplanes, ships all have changed a lot.

With Tesla coming in car industry is just paying for not being more innovative."
"Yeah ofcourse German automakers had their heads up their ass, now they are scrambling to put together electric units, but Germany still have worlds best engineers so they’ll catch up quick."
"well, its understandable when you consider the 2 very different target audiences..."
"To be fair, no one in the world presents like elon musk. The odd mix of introverted awkwardness, with an excellent understanding of all aspects of what he's talking about and bringing SMEs to present. The focus on the tech achievements with marketing being a necessary evil in the background. It's the opposite of most large companies."
"TLDW: Daimler is run by business school ideologues who ""manage"" by tweaking parameters, whose meaning is mostly opaque to those who are not indoctrinated.

Tesla is run by engineers who have deep comprehension of what their company makes."
Nice
When you have engineers run your car company vs MBAs who cant do an oil change to run your car company

"The problem with your argument is that you believe there is no place for ice. Until battery can match ice in ALL. Aspects, there will be a market for.

Easy to shit on Daimler but don’t forget Tesla wouldn’t be here right now if it wasn’t for Daimler
Tech company vs. legacy company
The greatest irony is that back in 2008 Daimler saved Tesla’s ass with a lifeline investment when they were about to go bankrupt.
This is comparing the battery day part of the Tesla presentation to the investor meeting of Daimler. This is not a true comparison. Almost car companies don’t do technology showcases.
"Daimler was produced in studio with mutiple takes tesla's was done live.

Also Daimler was done for the investors while tesla's was done for consumers.

I can list a ton of things why are we even comparing the two?"
engineering vs business
I’d still work for Daimler rather than Tesla.
"“Hi, I’m a douchebag in a suit.” vs “This is how our future technologies will work.”"
"It's an unfair comparison imo but Tesla has been innovative while Daimler hasn't.

Sure its buzzwords and boring bullshit but Tesla can also be said to have nonsensical buzzwords no one cares about or understands. 

But overall Tesla felt more comfortable but Daimler wasn't bad as such."
This comparison doesn’t make sense. Of course Daimler won’t be showcasing their tech since it was made a 100 years ago. They’ll talk about business during an investor presentation.
You just compared a battery presentation for public with Shareholder's Meeting.
"I like Elon but he shouldn't do presentations, he's a worse public speaker than me and I'm bad."
"Words, words, words."
Daimler is moving numbers while Tesla delivers innovation.
"not for nothing, but (not knowing anything about Daimler) I doubt any of the executives shown are native english speakers which doesn't help sell their points. Both sides are discussing rather boring subjects. In Elon's case, I think he gets caught up in explaining the engineering aspect of things and tends to loose the average person. I don't recall the name of the other guy durning the battery day presentation, but he did a pretty decent job. With more practice or a few more presentations under his belt he'd be a pretty good speaker."
"is this really a fair comparison? the other auto ceo’s make millions of dollars a year. if the companies had experts in ev competition as their ceos, that would mean the current ceos would not have a job or make millions of dollars per year. would you rather make millions of dollars per year or zero dollars per year?"

What is Daimler?
Guess which one brought down the share price 10%?
Muski Boy doesn't only boult rockets on a field he also has his Tesla presentations on one. Nice
"To be fair, Mercedes is a large company that makes a ton of cars all over the globe. I don't think they are worried just yet because Tesla is poaching the C class customers more than their more expensive and profitable vehicles sold in the US at least. E class was hit a little but not as bad as BMW's 5 series and midrange IIRC. Which makes sense to me at least as the Mercedes brand is a little stuffier, less sporty and more lux. And anyone who owns a Tesla knows that luxury isn't yet their thing. I fully expect Mercedes to electrify when the time comes as their customers don't mind dropping $80-$100k on a car."
Bean counters vs car guys all over again. This time the car guys are the only ones who can technically do it.
" **Daimler** AG reported **net income** of around 2.7 billion euros (or about three billion U.S. dollars) in **2019**

&#x200B;

kk"
"Excessive focus on profitability while giving up market share doesn't sound that great a strategy. And despite what they say, their EV goals are not that special."
"Think, maybe. Communicate and execute? No."
"Totally agree. I work with Daimler as a tier 1 supplier, and they are totally caught up in their ecosystem. It‘s like they cannot let go of the combustion engine as central to what their vehicles are all about.

Of all the German premium automakers, I give Daimler the smallest chance of surviving. BMW is also in a bad state. No real EV lineup in either company."
"This video (and/or title) is 100% bullshit. The Daimler presentation was a true financial investor presentation. It's being juxtaposed with a presentation designed to educate people about the nuances of Tesla’s battery. We are talking about apples and oranges here. 

Not that investors wouldn’t be interested in hearing about the battery, but in a presentation to investors you aren’t supposed to go into details as to how your product works. Go look up any investor presentation, they talk about the company’s financials."
"I don’t know about the argument that the totality of Mercedes’s problems could be fixed with some clever engineering. That isn’t a knock against them or a declaration that they are in some unique form of trouble, I just mean their overall situation is different than Tesla’s."
"Whoever coined the phrase ""you can't have your cake and eat it too"" clearly was not aware of the existence of engineers."
"Best solution if you're taking an MBA course I suspect.  Top Marks.

Never mind me while I buy some more Tesla."
"Actually, business problems **always** have an engineering solution. The Business is about selling better services and products, and engineering is about making them, inventing, fixing, and optimizing. Here you go 🤷‍♂️"
"I read this more as, “we have problems...we want to solve them” vs “We’ve focused on the solutions, let me show you what we’ve come up with”.

well said
"Are you seriously saying teslas have higher quality than mercs?

Merc can't think outside the box? For a start they invented the car, developed pretty much every major safety feature used in moderns cars and continuely push the envelope with their performance cars and racing teams."
"> higher quality.

Oh come on."
Tesla and high quality. Are you joking?
"I’ll be happy when Tesla starts to realize the quality side of that statement.  As someone who recently took delivery of a model y, I can say it’s not there yet."
"The thing is they do have business problems that require business solutions though.

&#x200B;

Regardless of what you think about their investment into EV and tech, winding down ICE manufacturing and ICE employees is a business and PR problem.

&#x200B;

Tesla can come into Germany and say ""we're going to hire a shit ton of people to make electric cars.""  They leave out ""We're going to hire a shit ton less people than the ICE manufacturers we're replacing.""

VW and MB have to say ""We're going to need to fire a shit ton of people if we want to be competitive in the EV market.""

&#x200B;

That's what the video is about.  ""We need to stop throwing money at a huge ICE R&D team. We need to stop holding up cash flow with ICE plants.  We need to reduce our workforce to be at parity with Tesla as far as number of manufacturing jobs. etc.""

All of which is not going to be popular in Germany where the automotive industry is a huge source of jobs.  Also unions will very much resist that change.  They certainly have for US ICE manufacturers with unionized workforces."
Sell sell sell!
I bought some Daimler and some Tesla couple years ago +500% on Tesla -50% on Daimler.
"Fair point, but battery day was for investors. Also like the Daimler presentation it was about how they plan to add shareholder value over time.

I think it’s a reasonable comparison if you can make that leap."
*throws milkshake*
"I agree, this is funny and Tesla is innovating at an amazing pace... but I don’t think it’s a fair comparison. I bet you could creat the same contrast within a single company by editing Apple keynote media against Apple quarterly report media."
"You're absolutely right. There was another section of the Battery Day presentation that was all spreadsheets and numbers. The part from Tesla here was the sexy, exciting part everyone tuned in for. These are two distinctly different presentations for different audiences."
"First thought too. 

A lot of companies have talented engineers and individuals who yearn to do more, but it’s the multiple levels of upper brass that’s likely the problem. Musk is unique because he spends much of his energy staying in touch and helping to drive the technical aspects of the company. Bean counting is important but it’s secondary."
"Elon can talk to me about tech. All the figures you can put into a pdf and send it to me, I'm good. Don't need Elon to read spreadsheet to me."
"I’m an accountant and even I don’t give two shits about markets, sales and breakeven points."
"> Tesla: autist engineer, meme lord

Which one is Elon?"
Ok that was funny 😄
A reminder that Musk is not a qualified Engineer.
"While engineers will spend their days modeling and forgetting about their hundreds of millions of upcoming loans due, launching the company into bankruptcy once it’s too late to do a recap at good rates. 

Each group has their purpose, no company can operate without both finance people and engineers/developers/makers. 

This is an investor presentation after all, it should revolve around what investors want to hear (what their money is doing). Tesla focuses on the engineering feats because that’s the only “story” for an investor to use to rationalize equity. Their current financials are garbage so they focus on the growth opportunity (from the engineering)."
Very well said...
This guy over here pretending tesla doesn't spout bullshit all the time lol
Few years working in the real world will make you more knowledgeable than a MBA.
"I remember at one point he talked about switching from the NVIDIA solution to their own chip. He said NVIDIA's solution was fundamentally running code in emulation.

I've worked with CUDA and Elon is exactly right. You're constantly copying data back and forth data to run between GPU for parallel processing and CPU to act on the data. That bus gets constrained. People who haven't used CUDA before have no idea that this is isn't going to work long term. I don't think a Tim Cook-like CEO would have caught that."
[deleted]
"> He's the biggest nerd ceo of all time.

Bill Gates would give him a run for his money, but I think Elon would probably pip him to the post."
Valid point.
What?  It was called Battery INVESTOR Day.  Just like Autonomy INVESTOR Day.
How was it a train wreck?
Anyone mentioned yet that they bailed and gave up their stake in Tesla ? That is some poor judgement right there and just shows how little foresight Daimler has.
That is the intention of the video to convince you that way. Could be also called propaganda.  That is all what you can take away from that compilation. Tesla-haters may compile similar the other way around easily.
Not really. They are currently doing it.
"Daimler isn't trying to push the boundaries of ice technology? What utter shite, they have develop the most efficient combustion engine off time."
"Daimler isn't trying to push the boundaries of ice technology? What utter shite, they have develop the most efficient combustion engine off time."
forgot the /s ?
What? He bullshit more than anyone.
Their stock price is up massively from where they got it. The investor return is doing pretty well
"You cant complain about these companies also losing out on profits, they were in a way better position to start an electric car companies and had the investor confidence behind them because they were already established, now that tesla is clearly ahead because everyone stood around talking about how electric cars are not worth it we can judge them. Im sure its easier now convincing investors to go electric seeing how successful and big of a threat Tesla has become."
"Could be wrong but I’m pretty sure if you put your money in any car company’s stock 5 years ago, Tesla would have given you the best return as of today."
"> nowhere else would people buy a consumer product (FSD) and still after 8 years not get what they paid for.

I see we have a true Tesla expert in our midst. 

So Tesla started selling FSD when their first Model S rolled off the line in 2012? Funny, it wasn’t an option on our 2013. That car didn’t even have parking sensors let alone FSD.

Tesla sold AP1 in conjunction with Mobileye between 2014 and 2016 before the companies split ways. This was a single camera system but finally has parking sensors. We still have our 2016 S.

FSD has been available for sale on and off between 2016 and today. We have two cars with FSD and the system’s abilities have improved greatly over the past few years. Is it fully autonomous? No way. Is Elon time real? Absolutely. Am I ok with it? 110%.

I hope you found the timeline helpful. You can’t make mistakes like that on an enthusiast sub and not be prepared to get called out for it every time."
"FSD has not been for sale for 8 years. Autopilot was first offered for sale in October 2014, and claims that FSD capable hardware went on sale in October 2016."
"Tesla hasn't given anything back to shareholders? wat????

Tesla will start printing money soon, people will be surprised. But no dividend for the next then years?"
Ola Källenius is actually Swedish
"If you are talking about Tesla's, we really don't need souless robots presenting us with buzzwords, thanks. I'd rather get it real and raw."
Did it? I got all the information i expected and more so i don't see the problem.
That's the difference between redditors that actually attend earnings/investor calls and those that don't. I bet those dumb business school people figured that much out.
We could have had a bad bitch.
"And this is why people say that tesla fans know nothing about the car industry.

Its literally there requirement as a buisness to generate value for your shareholders."
They literally have a fiduciary duty.
Have passenger planes really changed that much in the last 40-50 years?
Daimler profited handsomely off their investment
And if I want a car that doesn't fall apart I know a silicone valley based start up led by an ego maniac is not the best option.
You don't say...
I think it's related to Mercedes
">	I don’t think they are worried just yet because Tesla is poaching the C class customers more than their more expensive in profitable vehicle sold in the US at least.

If true, then this is why they will be going bankrupt and asking for bailouts this decade.  The world is going to decarbonize, and it’s going to happen fast whether Mercedes likes it or not, and whether they are ready or not. Should have taken it seriously 10 years ago instead of investing in emissions cheating technology."

"Very MBA mentality tho, and usually one held by management more concerned with racking up consistent performance metrics to justify their compensation than taking risks and innovating on behalf of shareholders. Common problem with large companies. Most often the incentives for advancement sound great on paper, but turn employee's self interest towards  maximizing short-term spectacle at minimal personal cost."
"Engineers running a company vs management people. Tesla still does launches and announcements like they are trying to win VC. I remember when my grandfather, who was an EE for Atari back in the day, told me why he left. When Warner bought them and the ""Harvard MBA bean counters"" came in. The development team wanted to develop PC's (a brand new market in their day) and the management wanted to continue pushing games. They cored out the soul of the company and drained the brain trust. These guys were visionary - they wanted to change the world not fill their pockets with dough (though that happened too).

https://youtu.be/bfFGrQLuY8s

Edits for Grammer/spelling etc."
"they are behind on technological standpoint, but luxury, comfort, reliability and comfort features are pretty good, so even if they design EV with shitty range and slow charging, it can still be a good car"
A public companies job is literally to make a profit. That’s how you maximize shareholder equity
"in the 60s IBM gave all its employees a notepad to carry at all times to both work out problems and write down any eureka moments in. They called these notepads ""thinkpads""."
Tesla's presentation shows it's hard to communicate. People don't want to listen.
"Diamler is not an engineering company like Tesla. They are a catalog assembler. Their entire playbook is moving money around, negotiating deals, negotiations with suppliers, logistics, timelines, resource and capital management. They just happen to do this with car parts and cars. They rely on bosch, ZF, continental, VM motori, LG Chem, CATL, (and previously ATD / Grumman before Tesla acquired them) etc. to do the actual innovation and engineering. They provide specifications and price targets. They do have engineers, but it's nothing like Tesla. 

VW and Ford are two standouts I've seen doing more on the home-grown engineering innovation side of things. But they still aren't close to Tesla."
"If they were smart, they'd subcontract Tesla to build the battery and sled, and focus on making the rest of the car amazing.  Image if you had Tesla underpinnings with BMW performance parts and styling, or Daimler interiors."
"> I give Daimler the smallest chance of surviving. BMW is also in a bad state.

Daimler has a huge commercial vehicle business; buses, trucks, vans, that will keep them afloat for some time even if their EV strategy wouldn't work. BMW is fucked if they don't get their i-series running."
"What are Tesla investors interested in?

What are Daimler investors interested in?

I think it's the investors that are apples and oranges.  The meetings were just tailored to the investors."
"I just think that this video compares the type of person who is right for the job versus the type of person who usually gets the Job. 

We live in a world of institutions whose leaders are more politicians and snake oil salesman rather than transformational leaders and thinkers. People who worked themselves into a position and plan on dying there or retiring at 85 and will not take risks. 

I have seen it over and over in various companies and institutes, people who see institutional problems with company policies, plans and agendas are seen as ""negative"" and push out or aside. The ""yes"" men and women are escorted to higher ranks, while the true nuts and bolts of the company are kept somewhere quite, out of the spot like, patronised, pacified. 

Some people are trying to portray an image, contrast to Elon who just wants to talk about and explain the ideas they have and why they are important. Elon never comes out with a PR tested script to read. Hes not wasting time and energy worrying about what the vocal minority is going to say or tweet."
Nope.  Tesla’s investor presentations always talk mostly about the engineering and products.
Part of the problem in Diamler inherited many of Chryslers bad habits during their merger. Chrysler for instance designs a body first then decides how to fit a drivetrain in it. Others build a drivetrain and design a body around it.
"If they were more innovative on the engineering side than Tesla and their product was better-engineered, they’d have a superior product. Currently Tesla’s products are better and the market is demonstrating this"
A few years ago Daimler held 10 percent of Teslas stocks but they sold them. They just don't want to make a transition
"To say that Mercedes is the best because they created the first automobile in the 19th century is like saying Ford has the most efficient manufacturing process today because they invented the assembly line. The Model S has been smoking every other vehicle on the market, in terms of performance, for the last 8 years. It still has the longest range of any EV. The Model 3 is the safest vehicle on the road in terms of probability of injury. The Model S isn't far behind in that regard, either. 

Bottom line: until Mercedes can market an EV that is competitive in terms of range, safety, performance, software/features, and with some sort of reliable charging infrastructure, and do it at a relatively similar price point, then you cannot say they're objectively better than Tesla at this stage in the game."
"There still isn't a product on the market with their range, technology, software, safety rating, and charging network- especially at their price point. 

There are a million Tesla owners out there who will tell you they can't go back to driving anything else."
"The last time someone said that, they went on to argue that panel gaps and drivetrain failures were essentially equal as failures because they were both potentially caused by lack of attention to detail... Is that where you are headed with this???"
"There still isn't a product on the market with their range, technology, software, safety rating, and charging network- especially at their price point. 

It's not even close."
"I took delivery of one a few months ago. Quality was pretty good, though I did have to bring it back to get a couple things adjusted. I'm still thrilled with the car, especially now that everything is how it should have been on day 1; it's the best car I've ever driven. But I understand the position that buyers of a new car shouldn't have to deal with that kind of issue in the first place."
[deleted]
"This isn't remotely true. First off, autonomous assembly has advanced in nearly all manufacturing sectors. That's what technological advancement does. It always ultimately leads to a net gain for society.

Secondly, jobs do not simply *disappear*, they evolve. For example, Tesla is still hiring at least 5,000 people for the Texas factory; that figure includes a greater number of engineers and technicians rather than just assembly line workers as you might see at a typical GM plant. Elon Musk has recently said multiple times that people are still far better than robots at identifying and implementing solutions to manufacturing issues."
"Yeah, the first half of the meeting was pretty dry in comparison and was a bit more traditional. However, the battery day presentation was absolutely relevant. Even as a low dollar stockholder I'd absolutely want to see that kind of content and technical discussion, it reinforces the idea that they actually have a plan and are doing more than just squeezing milk out of a dying cow. As high dollar investors become increasingly technically literate, this is a great strategy, as the traditional bullshit investor meetings aren't useful and provide no meaningful feedback. You can see through the corporate shit-speak in that particular segment of the Daimler video, and while there was other content, that particular section was completely useless."
This is one of the things I love about Tesla:  Their sole goal is NOT increasing shareholder value and they're not afraid to admit it.
"Yes I know, I'm just being silly."
No it wasn’t. They made it clear it was to attract talent and suppliers.
"In the Steve Jobs days, I'd agree.  He was a dick, but a good showman.  These days, since stuff is always leaked well in advance and Tim Cook is about as vanilla as a bag of rice, the keynotes are all pretty ho hum...

On the flip side, the Apple quarterly calls are pretty entertaining.  As investor calls go..."
Then please provide any Daimler presentation on a technical par with battery day.
Yes but it's a shareholders' meeting. The investors need to know more about the financial situation more then the tech aspects.
What? How could you possibly not care about sales lol
Yes
"What is ""qualified""? He is not a PE, but that is small potatoes when you are the lead engineer at SpaceX."
"What is he then? He's at least a software engineer, right?"
"I somewhat agree. But this is about leadership and focus. Tesla, Apple, Google, and most big tech companies are engineering-first. Big Auto is MBA-first.

There was a time when Microsoft was MBA-first, we all know how that went."
"Current finances are better than many other automakers, just take a look at the debt of the big three USA automakers. The declines in sales for virtually everybody else but Tesla  Tesla has plenty of cash on hand and has major investments in manufacturing that are and will continue to pay big dividends. Yes the P to E ratio is crazy but with 43% Year over year growth, Storage, Solar and Uber taxis, Tesla can rightly claim their long term prospects are good."
"You apparently haven’t graphed Tesla’s Operating Cash flow vs Daimler’s.

Please tell me you don’t think P/E a relevant metric for high growth companies?"
If you can get the product out the door and its good then you can pay for those loans.
"Exactly. Both companies are in very different positions right now, so it makes tons of sense they’d focus on different things. 

When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in the 90s, he had to have a lot of hard conversations with investors about survivability and future products and direction and how he was planning to turn the ship around. Compare to today, where every shareholder meeting can be summarized by “lots of great products in the pipeline, here’s our earnings guidance” and that’s about it. Same company, different context."
"Of course you need MBAs in a company, we're talking about leadership of a company here. You hire some MBAs and keep them in their pen and poke them every quarter to prepare quarterly reports and shit, just don't let them control the company. That's when it all goes to shit."
Also pretending that Musk is actually an engineer (he has a liberal arts degree in fundamentals and business applications of physics).
"TBF to other CEOs, there aren't a lot of CEOs whose side job is being a chief rocketry engineer either."
"That's not what Elon must have meant.  What he must have meant was that CUDA kernels compile to PTX which then get JIT'ed to whatever the actual hardware supports.

Having to move data in and out of chips is fundamental.  Nobody avoids it.  Some can handle it better and nicer than others.  Intel GPUs handle it very well by being on the same chip as the CPUs and participating fully in the caching scheme.  Being on separate chips and a PCIe bus makes the task harder, but it can be worked around by having more on-chip memory or by scheduling the data movement better (and possibly overlapping it with the computation).

Tesla has their own compiler for their own chips which compile down from Tensorflow (I think) to whatever their chips actually run so it is relatively easy for them to schedule data movement and computation really well -- and to look at what the actual code really does.  Having a JIT in between makes it a lot harder."
A Tim Cook ceo would also not have got fired from PayPal for insisting PayPal should switch from Unix to Windows.
Elon's degree in physics not good enough for your big pp?
"Because it was for investors. It was not a shareholder meeting, which is what that video is. 

The shareholder meeting was before the battery day, and it was incredibly boring."
"I listen too or watch as many shareholder presentations as i can of the companies i have shares in.  Ive never seen such a total lack of public speaking experience nor seemingly total lack of preparation as to what was going to be said.  These people make good money...if part of your job is communicating, take some bloody public speaking lessons...the Rotary Club is pretty cheap."
🤦🏼‍♂️
"Yes, I'm aware of the intention given the editing of the video. Nevertheless it was worth the watch."
The pace isn't as rapid as it needs to be.
They must sell at some point to get those profits though.
"These companies are still in a good position. There is still some time (unfortunately) until the electric revolution is really here. They have the time to phase out their old products and develop new electric ones, and that's what their investor expect. 

And they have decades of experience in the field, which shows when basically their first EVs are good enough for most people to turn in their ICE-car and never look back. Sure Tesla may have the lead on technology, but not everyone will want a Tesla no matter how good or cheap they are."
"Thanks for the timline, I have corrected my text.
My point is still valid though, and you proved it for me.

In the end I will probably be closer to the thruth with my erroneous years when FSD is approved for the general public."
Oh only 4 years of fraud then.
"Shareholders are not necessarily investors, there is a difference between investing - > expecting dividends, and speculating - > expecting high stock price. 

High stock price represents the expectation that Tesla will be giving high dividends aka ""printing money"", so not surprising at all.

My comment about 10 years was for the time it will probably take for ICE-manufacturers to transition  to electric.
But it's 8 years since the model S launch, and Tesla has reinvested almost everything into RnD, that is a long time without dividends. But once they start giving out dividends less money will go into RnD and their lead will  get smaller."
"No, I meant Daimler's attempt at sounding like they have their act together, required a good amount of PR spin.   Tesla doesn't require a PR team at all."
"Not so much post jet engines, but over 100 years, definitely"
Your politically motivated comment has no power here.
"Right, no excuse for their cheating.  Mercedes in a couple years is going to drop a couple billion into battery manufacturing and then they will just start cranking out EVs. Honestly one of the biggest barriers is in the US market, half the population is still brainwashed into believing global warming is a hoax. In about 10 years I think that will be done."
"The post is comparing the two and mocking one - the one that has $3.8bn in net revenue over Tesla.

\*net income"
"I’ve heard the opinion on here before that legacy car companies for the most part won’t ever proactively pursue EVs because in marketing any EV they make as both being more affordable to operate and having crazy better performance specs than ICE cars, you are essentially telling the consumer “95% of the products we make are obsolete horse shit, but please buy THIS EV we make instead.” And they won’t be willing to go down that road until it’s too late and they’ve been left behind. I think Volkswagen is the only one legitimately that will be able to grow as EVs start to dominate the market organically; GM and Ford will survive but I think it will be through acquisition of startups like Rivian, Lucid, Lordstown, etc. once the mustang mach e, etc. all fail to offer consumers a compelling reason to buy one."
"This is documented very well in The Innovators Dilemma. 

Market incumbents refuse to innovate new products that will cannibalize their main revenue stream, so instead they are disrupted from a niche/smaller competitor."
[deleted]
"Also, Daimler's shareholders don't give a shit about Daimler, they just want the numbers to move in the right direction. Tesla has a significant number of shareholders that believe in the brand and what it can accomplish, as such are willing to invest in the long term. Just my take on it anyway."
wish i could upvote this a 1000x!
This is analogous to how the changing of the guard in the US retail world has come about as well.  Who it is that is embracing and driving the paradigm shift.  Sears (sexy catalog?) -> Walmart (logistics) -> amazon (tech) -> whomever comes next.
"Management is Existentialism.  You are brought on to solve a business problem, and if you are good at your job, suddenly you have technical and manufacturing teams operating so smoothly that you sit at your desk and you ponder ""if my boss walked in right now, how would I justify my continued role here?""  So you invent things to manage.  You make spreadsheets, and you call meetings to show people those spreadsheets.  You become master of your domain.  Before long, your spreadsheets support a whole ecosystem within the company.  They become infectious.  Someone uses them for an investor presentation.  All hope is now lost.  The investors must have the spreadsheets.  They start to crave the seamless projection of number macro to slide deck, as if their hearts beat only four times per year.  You have become a parasite, siphoning off technical prowess and innovation for the sake of the almighty spreadsheet.  Reducing the function of a complex organism to an non-falsifiable basis, laughing in the face of god herself.  Chaos?  You are chaos.  To remove you would certainly kill the host.  But you are growing too fat.  
  
Two words: Head Count."
That mentality will when when companies record loses and if they don’t they’ll gradually die.
"You have ""comfort"" twice, and calling Daimler a leader in reliability [strikes me as off the mark](https://www.osv.ltd.uk/are-mercedes-benz-reliable/).  They do luxury well, and comfort well, but if your competition is good enough in those areas, and light years ahead in others, it's just not good enough."
a good car to sit in at a drive-in movie?
Short term profit maximization at expense of long term profit maximization.
"They said ""think"" on them. I think they still sell stuff like that."
"Honestly, I wasn’t planning to watch past the first few minutes, but ended up absolutely rivited. No, Elon isn’t the greatest presenter, but the content itself was almost as good as Steve Jobs presenting the iPhone."
"It astonishes me that people don't have the capacity to digest information unless it is spoon fed to them in small bites with a wipe of the napkin after each bite. 

I was utterly transfixed through the entire presentation. Blown away when it was over, and still had the ramifications of it churning around in my head when I went to bed. To the point that I dreamed about it. 

How do people not get it?"
And Tesla will take the time to try. And not treat people like idiots who can't understand. Looks like Mercedes and GM won't even try. Remember Ultium?
"Yep, most people will take ""entertainment"" and presentation over content and depth every time. Just look at the presidential debates. :-)"
"Its not that people don't want to listen, its that they don't know how to communicate ideas to laymen. I get that the presentation was for people more versed in engineering as a recruiting pitch of sorts. But they know damn well the battery day had been marketed to *everyone*. The presentation was a failure at communicating how ground-breaking the tech was to *everyone*"
"> VW and Ford are two standouts I've seen doing more on the home-grown engineering innovation side of things. But they still aren't close to Tesla

VW is outselling Tesla in BEV's in europe."
This is how they survive. And I think that’s what VW might do. I would love a Tesla/Audi combo. RS6 Avant but electric.
But that would be incredibly dumb on Tesla’s part so long as they’re battery constrained.
"Yes, combine the performance of the roadrunner with the styling of bugs bunny!"
"Good point! It‘s possible that electrification of commercial vehicles could move even faster than passenger cars because it‘s easier to accomplish (more space, less range required). Amazon didn‘t buy a major stake in Rivian for nothing."
"Agree, but it’s not just the presentations being tailored, it’s the entire companies."
"Excellent point. Also we still have legacy manufacturers designing EVs with a grill in front of the ""engine block"". Why? Apart from a small slit for a vent, there's no mechanical purpose for a grill. They just don't want to challenge a consumer's preconceived notions of what a ""car"" is and looks like."
"> Chrysler for instance designs a body first then decides how to fit a drivetrain in it 

Oh wow, I never knew that. That's an ass backwards way of doing things."
"> Part of the problem in Diamler inherited many of Chryslers bad habits during their merger. Chrysler for instance designs a body first then decides how to fit a drivetrain in it. Others build a drivetrain and design a body around it.

That may be the case in other platforms, but it is certainly not the case in Daimler's electric platforms."
In what sense do you think that Tesla generally has superior products to Diamler and how do you see that manifesting in the market?
"ummm, maybe you are from the future, but right now, Daimler sells 3 times as many cars as Tesla. Also, while Tesla is ahead technologically, comfort features, materials and exclusive feeling of Mercedes is unmatched (except for exotics of course). Also, reliability."
Either that or they decided they didn't want to be in business with Musk.
"Except we weren't just talking about ev but the company as a whole.

And in that comparison telsa loses out massivly. 

The model s doesn't come close to there performance cars. 

If tesla can use a modified model s that is nothing like the actual car then merc can just pull out there racing ev's and absolutely smoke them.

""The Model S has been smoking every other vehicle on the market, in terms of performance, for the last 8 years""

If your talking about ev, while wrong Its almost the truth, if you mean cars in general that's just stupid. 

EV the taycan has better performance is almost every single metric and the rimac blow the teslas out the water."
"Oh I agree the cars a great.. but let’s face it, there are serious quality issues"
So what about the thing he actually challenged your comment on?
"100% agree.  Best car I’ve ever driven in a lot of ways.  I think Tesla put their delivery center employees in a tough spot, and it takes a little away from the excitement of acquiring a new car."
"Can’t speak for others, but I went into the delivery ready to just pick the thing up and go home and enjoy my car.  VERY noticeable body panel alignment problems as we walked up to the car.  Spoiler not affixed to the car properly.  Huge issues, no? Drivable, yes?  Acceptable from a $63k car, hell no.  Congrats on your model 3.  I hope later buyers of model Y have a better experience.  I haven’t owned a Ford since I was 18, but several Audi, VW and BMWs over the years haven’t had these kind of problems. Don’t be dismissive of legit issues that people are experiencing just because your sample size of 1 doesn’t match."
"You're completely missing the point.

This has NOTHING to do with automation.

It takes less people to put together an electric car than an ICE car.  Full stop.

You don't need to build big complex transmissions, engines with many parts, etc. 

Tesla, I'm sure has gained some efficiency from automation.  But it simply requires less people for VW to build an electric car than it does for an ICE equivalent.

And just because new jobs get created in silicon valley, doesn't mean that the displaced german workers will get one that pays the same."
"Agreed.

Although it is clear, with Elon’s compensation package, that he needs his personal wealth to increase.  Even if it’s only to help him achieve his other goals."
"They didn’t invite engineers and suppliers to see their battery line, institutional investors got a peek.

They have multiple motives.  Yes, every chance they get they ask for help, but having a high stock price pays for it."
In today's market's I think the stock price is driven by what you have to offer in terms of revolutionizing sectors rather than how much profit you can make. TSLA stock price is a rocket ship that has little to do with making actual profit. Everyone wants to be a part of the revolution and Tesla has shown itself to be the undisputed leader.
the shareholder meeting had finished
Yes
"Qualified is having a degree. Engineering is a professional discipline. Like being an MD or a lawyer. Not just anyone can call themselves that, no matter how many titles they give themselves. Do you honestly think he is making engineering decisions at a rocket company on his own engineering expertise? He is managing engineers who guide him with their knowledge. There's nothing wrong with that. He's obviously doing a great job of managing them, but it doesn't make you a thing just by calling yourself that."
No. He has a liberal arts degree in physics. This particular degree is an education in the fundamentals and business applications of physics. He has no engineering qualifications. I do not know what his software development background is but I suspect it is at a conceptual or management level.
">There was a time when Microsoft was MBA-first, we all know how that went.

"That's some very broad generalizations. Many leaders at these companies nowadays have both an engineer background and an MBA on top.  

Mary Barra at GM is an electrical engineer, with an MBA.

Tim Cook is most well known for supply-chain optimizations (MBA type) , but also have an industrial engineering degree.

Steve Jobs despite being known as an ""innovator"", is not an engineer."
"different compnies different priorities. Let’s recap a bit:  
Microsoft: we cater businesses, because that’s where the money are. As long as businesses pay, we do anything  
Apple: things must be nice and fluid, so people love our products. User experience is top priority. As long as they use our product in an intended, curated way.  
Google: let’s try all the good ideas and see what sticks. Then make money of it.  
Mercedes: Luxury and comfort are top priorities. Who cares about driving.  
Tesla: engineer the shit out of it. Release ASAP, deal with the problems as they come. Bleeding edge engineering is much more interesting as choosing interior materials

"To be pedantic, he got his bachelor's degree in economics and physics from UPenn, and dropped out of a PhD in energy physics at Stanford. While physics isn't technically engineering, it is a pretty technical and related field, and probably wouldn't be considered ""liberal arts"". It's also fairly common in many types of engineering for people to cross over into engineering from other technical fields through work experience."
"The CUDA kernels are essentially the emulated instructions that Elon was talking about, yes. I found myself constantly trying to take pieces of my CPU code and figure out what block size would be optimal given the data. I was spending too much time trying to make the NVIDIA card happy satisfying all of their constraints and not enough time solving my problems. NVIDIA created a virtual ""unified"" memory to make life slightly easier, but then you get stuck in NVIDIA's walled garden. 

I suspect Elon realized this too and knew they had to make their own chip."

"i am a shareholder too for (7+ Years now) and i have no issues with excellent engineers being poor public speakers, as long as they let the products do the talking.

Also as an engineer myself i loved battery day and Tesla's AI event so much, i have watched both many times over from excitement."
"You’re apparently taken in by smooth talk and slick presentations.

Those things used to be way more important, but people today (Nikola investors aside) are too savvy for that gloss.

The wisest of investors, far prefer Elon’s style."
How does that logic not apply to any other stock?
"Daimler is not in a good position. 

VW is in a good / alright position. But not Daimler!"
"These companies are terribly far behind in many ways, not just power and drive train. When I get into my Tesla, it is unlike any car I have gotten into. The technology is integrated into the car in such a way that it will take other manufacturers years to catch up on. The sensors, computer, mcu, and everything else. On top of that, they have been incrementally improving their software over a decade. Other manufacturers are going to be the furthest behind in software in my opinion and will have to adopt Tesla's model of Over the Air updates and incremental development. By the time other manufacturers finally step up to the plate, Tesla will have already completed their neural network and their FSD will outclass any late comers."
"Stocks are always future looking, you always combine current dividend and future growth. You can't separate it into two different groups. Buying stocks in expectation of future stock price growth is just as much investing as buying stock for its dividend."

"Yeah, and thats bad for short-term metrics. Gonna eat shit for a few quarters until the whole lineup is EV. Most CEOs don't have the balls or stockholder trust to execute something like that."
"I love how we all leave Nikola out of the question now, as it should be."
">That opinion doesn't really hold much water. Those dinosaur ICE companies have more money than they know what to do with. Ford could go full EV right now if they really wanted to. They drag their feet as usual because at present, there is no pressing need to change. Car sales were down in the U.S already because everyone wanted those half-pint SUV's. That and Toyota and the other asian brands had really put a dent in their sales with far better cars than any other brand. But Ford and GM could snap into action at any time and roll out EV trucks and SUVs. There will come a point when that happens. The only reason they haven't yet, is quite literally because they don't have to. That's why they'd have been perfectly happy to use internal combustion for another 50 years."
"The whole ""95% of our products are shit, but this EV is the best"" mentality is true in terms of things like maintenance and operating costs.  I feel like there is a pretty big trade off though in that you are basically trying to get consumers to switch platforms to a whole new way of driving, commuting, thinking.  EVs can go anywhere but it takes planning...something most people never think about.  Most people know ZERO about charging infrastructure, differences in charging options, winter effects.  We need education.  THis is like switching from analog to digital, flip phone to smart phone, cassette to CD."
"I'd argue Kia and Hyundai have a shot too. They're genuinely trying hard at it, even going so far as to spin out the ""Ioniq"" brand as it's own thing."
"Eh? The new Hummer EV doesn’t seem to be positioned as worse than their ICE trucks - it’s clearly supposed to be the most badass truck they’ll be selling. Plus GM isn’t run by MBA types, it’s run by an engineer. The only real issue is their legacy structure but they’re hard into EVs and their technology is also quite good even if they haven’t gone into batteries themselves yet.

VW has obviously gone in hard on EVs but after the dieselgate fiasco the new team running it had really very little to lose gutting all the old tainted diesel powertrain programs and pouring that money into EVs, nevermind the legal requirements."

"my problem with a lot of automakers is the move to plastic parts have destroyed long-term reliability. where in the past a metal housing may have lasted the life of the car generally a plastic one does not. one thing good and bad is smaller journals in the engine. its great for keeping the engine lubricated or cooled but the small journals also plug up easier. i have a coworker with a diesel gle he bought used. the turbo blew right after he got it. after that was replaced the engine went, i want to say less than a week later. he was pissed and had to fight to get it covered under the warranty."

"What I've learned from watching Elon. Your presentation doesn't really matter if the content is cutting edge. Time and time again his presentation is absolutely bottom 20% quality. Speaking, eloquence, timing, content structure, all of it. His presentation support is pretty decent but stark and simple. You can tell his brain is struggling to bring his communication down to a different level but his material, process and insight is far beyond what others bring. This is frustrating for someone who works in presenting other people's material and making it more presentable. Its like 99% of what I do doesn't matter because at the bottom line the material is shit, I just shine it up."
Elon Musk is the worst presenter for Tesla.
I was transfixed as well except after they started showing the cost decline slides and I became busy logging into Fidelity to buy more shares:-)
"Yeah, I try not to. I can't remember the last time I watched one. 

I think that debates aren't really a great format for exploring any idea. Their main benefit is when they manage to get sides to interact so you get some synthesis. That is sparse even in very cordial academic settings with brilliant opponents. In a political debate it is all posturing for the cameras and lowest common denominator. 

Maybe you get a little sense of diplomatic skills under pressure, but not much. And the reality is that any politician leaves the thinking and diplomacy to others. They're going to make decisions, but 99% of the time they don't need to think on their feet."
"If someone doesn't understand how groundbreaking it is when they are told...

""For 100+ years nickel has been separated using this long complicated process involving tons of dangerous chemicals, and we have figured out how to do it with just water.""

or

""The current process for doing (whatever) involves this massive number of giant buildings and a long and complicated chemical process, and we have reduced it to 1/5th that size, made it faster, and we use far less chemicals""

or

""All batteries are made with tabs, we have made the first one every without tabs, and that makes it way more efficient, so the battery can be larger and cooler at the same time, and therefore just way better""

...then there is nothing to be done for those people, they will never get it, and there is no point in talking down even further (and this was SUPER SUPER dumbed down already) to get down to their level. What do you want them to say ""We smart, we make battery better, you drive our car. durrrhhh."" or something? This was the perfect level of explanation to actually describe what they did without giving away too much, and while making the innovation and impact extremely clear. 

So yeah, that presentation was incredibly simple and straightforward from a ""we are breaking new ground here""  perspective. The only problem I saw was that they didn't drop their microphones about a half-dozen times, because every single tech change they described was microphone-drop worthy. In one presentation they slapped half a dozen industries in the face and made them their bitch, and did so in laymen's terms. It was ridiculous."
"You can't present details so that literally everyone can understand it - that's impossible.  Instead you need to pick a level where people outside your company can quickly learn enough to understand it.  

It was presented well enough that if you wanted to better understand it you could go look up what was presented and then watch it again."
That's because teslas are HUGE! Even the model 3 is larger than most cars on the road in Germany.
A little skewed since they have recently released a huge buildup of inventory on brand new models that people have pre-ordered and been waiting months / years for - which they are also not yet exporting to the Americas or Asia. But it will be very interesting to see how annual trends compare on a continental / global scale over the next 24 months.
What car the ID3? I have never even seen one here in Madrid. Plenty of Tesla’s though.
"And your point is that Europe is bigger than the world where Tesla outsells VW?

Did you not know Europe is just a part of the world?

P.S. Were you also unaware Tesla does all European production in the first month of the quarter and therefore lost ALL Q2 European production because of a forced Fremont shutdown?"
"VW's global EV sales are going to pretty quickly surpass Tesla's, and at much lower manufacturing cost thanks to their MEB platform.  You really think they are going to give up and license the battery and drivetrain from Tesla?"
This happens with ICE cars too. Many cars have huge grills cluttering the front end. But in reality most are fake and blocked off.
"**It's ass backwards, but it's how literally 90% of companies work:**

Marketing:  We are paying you to find solutions, not bitch.  

**Nothing different with auto manufacturing:**

Marketing/Design:  We want a car that looks like this.  Go figure it out.

Engineering:  That's ridiculous and has the aero properties of a kite tied to a brick.  Also, literally where do the people sit??

Marketing/Design:  That sounds like an engineering problem.  It's ""pretty""."
"He doesn't need to as ""superior"" is a subjective term and the only place it matters is in his head because that same brain makes buying decisions.

Doesn't matter if his perception is correct or incorrect, whether his opinion can be supported or is unsupported by facts.

This is what companies 'don't get' about today's economy.  Every product has a potential market of 7 billion people.  You no longer need to make products or services that are factually superior to other brands, just make them good enough so that a certain % of those customers give you money.

Of course, if you really DO have a factually superior product, all the better for you, your market cap is now in the 10 to 13 figure range.  Go get it."
"Oh, just safety, efficiency, performance, technology, value, customer satisfaction...  You know the unimportant stuff."
Mercedes. Reliable?? Lmaoooooooo
"Although Tesla has a lot of room to grow in the interior space, i  just cannot go back to buttons. Mercedes just feels to busy inside now, so even with better materials and presentation I still vastly prefer Tesla's interior."
I'd guess they didn't believe it would work out. As all of Teslas competitors did back then.
I guess having a safer car that travels farther and has better software capabilities has absolutely nothing to do with quality of a product....
"Yep. Customers shouldn't have to go through a QC checklist when they buy a new car. And my service center experience wasn't great either. Issues were resolved and they never tried to charge me, so all is well... but I wish Tesla would shift focus from delivery numbers to high-quality production."
"During the Q&A, wasn't it clear they kept discussing the need to hire good talent and get access to raw minerals for what they want to achieve? If their ambitions are legitimate, and I can't imagine anything else, then they have to change the whole supply chain around this new process. They are also likely telling their battery suppliers and competitors what to do. It takes a big force to change the structure of the industry. I would compare their signaling to be just as valuable as when the Federal Reserve makes comments that move the markets without actually changing interest rates. Sometimes, it's the threat (in this case, Tesla making their own batteries) that will push their suppliers and competitors to find ways to get prices down.

We may differ on who we think the intended audience was, but I think there's very little being asked of investors and this was more focused on future employee and material sourcing. Tesla raised a lot of money this year and I'd hope they've got enough for a while..."
"This is exactly why TSLA is considered over-valued. Non-Tesla EV’s are already outselling Tesla in Europe, and the companies that are doing it consistently turn profits.

Don’t get me wrong, Tesla has the best tech in the light duty business right now, but that high stock price relies on people’s willingness to believe they can effectively monetize their lead. They need to outline a plan to do so before somebody else beats them to the punch."
"So while I agree, the title ""engineer"" requires a professional certificate blessed by other ""engineers"", I don't think there is much doubt that Elon Musk can do actual engineering work, even without the blessed title.

I don't have a linkable source, but I remember reading about ex-employees saying, if you had trouble meeting your deadline, Elon Musk would come finish your task while also doing his.

Now there is a good reason that Engineering is a blessed title, as there has to be someone to yell and and blame when the bridge falls down, etc. So I'm not trying to knock engineering as a discipline, but to think that only people blessed can actually do the work is not reality.  The blessed title is so that someone gets stuck holding the bag when the lawyers come to collect after the bridge falls down."
"Ah, that makes sense then. He probably picked most of it up on his own. Definitely seems to be good at those business applications though..."
"Absolutely; he's got a great deal of managerial experience. He's not sitting around all day running all these companies, *and* designing new Teslas, *and* engineering new battery chemistry, *and* designing a rocket, *and...*etc.

From what I remember, Elon had already quit coding and was moved to an executive position at Zip2. That was the company that preceded x.com (the company that became PayPal). So he's been in management since the early 2000s if not late 90s.

I have no doubt he's got a ton of information in his head, as being involved in the way he is in these businesses he has very likely studied or been tutored on advanced concepts so that he can keep up with the engineers he hires."
Ewww a liberal??!? /s
You mean McDonnell Douglas
Boeing is still engineers last
Jobs was an incredibly good salesman - but not an innovator.
Supply chain optimisation is a industrial engineering field. But I think cook has an MBA too
"People don't even understand the financials of Tesla, so what's the point?  As an MBA (it's fucking useless) in the finance industry, I look at Tesla's working capital equation where days inventory is less than days A/P, which is insane.  But the analysts don't pick up on that, even when Elon yells it to their faces.  So why even bother any more?  Tesla should just talk about whatever they feel like.  Elon could talk about his fucking breakfast and I'd still be invested nearly 100% in Tesla.

Daimler needs to talk about their financials and what they're doing to cut costs because shit looks scary right now as the global auto industry shrinks.  They need to find a growth sector (EVs).  If they just shifted to EVs a long time ago (or just keep their stake in Tesla as a hedge), they could just be talking about tech as well, but instead they're desperately trying to explain the downtrend."
"Android funeral, DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS."
"While entertaining and even potentially technically correct, his coked-up gorilla act was not their finest hour..."
"You need to separate financials of the company (solid) from the stock price. Company financials based on maximizing capital investment, something bean counters are uncomfortable with but is a very wise decision in growth phase.  Tesla could capture a major fraction of the market!

Fast growing companies are very difficult to price. Basically the sky is the limit until they prove otherwise."
The question is how you evaluate if something is profit-wise. And also when its worth developing in the long  run even if it hurts your profit in the short run.
That's how you fall for the sunken cost fallacy
"That's where you go wrong. If MBAs gets to decide what projects are profitable and not, you're fucked. They don't understand the projects. They don't understand what the fuck ""cold rolled stainless steel"" is, or why this truck have to be so weird ass looking. Just make a normal truck that we know people will buy. 

That's your MBA talking. They should have no say in the company operations, they don't understand the operations. Keep them in their pen and let them check the numbers the engineers produce and run their excel spreadsheets, handle financing, generate shareholder reports and so on."
"You are playing up the importance of those people, MBA's should never be in charge, they dont understand any of the projects they will manage which require an esoteric understanding to appreciate. Reason like that are why SpaceX is the first private company to take americans to space."

Yes I do. The one he got before Stanford admitted him as a PhD student.
"Did we just go down the ""He didn't get a BS he got a BA"" route?

I honestly haven't heard that since freshman year lmao.

Also, the difference between a BA vs BS is, like, a few humanities classes and maybe 10-20% more engineering courses, none of which add more fundamentals.

Decades of applied experience trumps all of that."
"I didn't complain about batter day...i'm complaining about the shareholder meeting being a shit show...you're communicating with your shareholders...thus, learn to communicate.  Batteryday was fine...geeks geeking."
"Again...for the 3rd time...i'm speaking of the shareholder meeting and not the battery day.   And no, i've been at this a long time...shareholders deserve good, clear, precise communication about  their investments. 

For the FOURTH time, to be clearer than clear, IM NOT TALKING ABOUT BATTERY DAY."
"It does, but a lot of stocks also pay dividents so you get profit without selling and doesn't need to lower your % of the company ownership. A lot of stocks aren't growing more than the general market but pay high dividents because they're profitable and that lowers the owners risk since they are constantly making a profit.

If an unprofitable company's stock crashes you havent made any profit at all."
Yeah and Tesla's market cap is so forward looking they won't catch up before 2100 lol
"Exactly my point, Tesla came and shook the fundamentals of car design and powering system which should have been done by major players long back."
Can't help but think they had planned this in order for them to make it easier to switch en-masse to EV production...
"Tesla ate shit for years, a “few quarters” is real optimistic"
"It's worse than that.  A company which has spent a hundred years curating institutional knowledge, culture, and technical leadership around building ICEVs cannot just flip a switch and start making EVs.  They literally have no technical management with any expertise in the area.  They don't have the margins to stand up an entirely new R&D structure which will ultimately cannibalize the rest of the company.  Doing so would require raising capital (read, dilution) or diverting assets from ICE R&D.  Which means you have to go tell Bob, the 50 year old engineer who has been with the company for two decades - who is named on 100 patents which have created a billion dollars for the company - that his division is being downsized so that you can hire one 30 year old Stanford battery scientist, and an army of 20-something software engineers.  
  
It's almost an impossible thing to do when your entire technical and management hierarchy is filled with people who not only haven't a clue how to build an EV, but who are actively hostile to being replaced."
They were never in the question. Red flags from day 1.
"Haha for sure- I have to say I’m proud that when they IPO’ed I had a couple friends who asked me what I thought since I own and EV and pay attention to the space, and I told them it was a company that would never get a product to market. Drive a BEV for a month and then tell me whether you want to go back to visiting a station to fill your car with liquid sloshing around. Stupid. 

Anyway neither of them bought the stock and thanked me later"
"I agree with some of your points but I stand by my opinion. I think the oil industry has more influence over the boards of those companies than you are estimating and a board can replace an exec championing a cause they don’t like pretty quickly. I could be wrong and only time will tell- obviously those companies employ a lot of people so I don’t wish them ill, but I do sadistically enjoy watching companies who have been able to be lazy and produce mediocre products for decades starting to slip.

I think ford will start to panic if/when the cybertruck goes into production; boomers and many others will still buy F-150’s and it’s a great fleet car for construction companies, but they will see that they lost 90% of gen z coming into the market because they want new tech, speed, and the thing is a bulletproof tank."
"Honestly I had not thought of either of them but that’s a good point. I’ve heard Toyota is going the hydrogen route which IMO has zero chance of becoming a new standard, but I don’t know the efforts of other Asian manufactuers"
"Certain automakers also deliberately use (likely for cost savings) inferior rubbers when making gaskets as well. BMW is well renowned for this sort of behavior. They just don't last. And when you bring it up you're met by all brand loyal fanatic apologists saying things about how bmw is ""on the cutting edge"". Yeah sure, they're so cutting edge they can't even  figure out how to make a gasket last past 5 years."
">where in the past a metal housing may have lasted the life of the car generally a plastic one does not

I disagree. Provided they used decent resin, plastic is incredibly durable. Easily the life of the car. There are issues with other materials like plasticine and almost any rubber based parts. Most soft things (including leather) and anything which flexes is probably not going to last the car's lifetime without some maintenance. Of course metal is *more* durable, and it feels and looks nicer."
"service work Yes. but after 3 years High end Luxury brands Like BMW, Merc, Audi and others are usually in the shop a lot. As they age they are in there with Increasing Frequency that's Assuming they make it that far. This Seems to be Par for the course as an Automaker, they focus on the first owner. not the 2nd or 3rd. they could give 2 Fucks about those people. 

that's why the lease Program is so Popular with High-end markets. after 2-3 years you can dump the car and its now the Used car markets problem."
"Their excessive focus on short term profit during a revolutionary phase in global car market will NECESSARILY hold them back from the transition and thus their position in the next iteration of that market.

They might have been around for 100 years but that is 100 years of ICE market, and no EV/Autonomy. Also, the people are not actually the same as those from 100 years ago. Those in control now are used to a certain type of situation and that is their frame of reference.

Many old companies fail precisely because of this and every single time people defend them with 'they have been around for a long time, do you really believe ...'."
PSA: Lenovo is a Chinese company
Not laptops. Actual paper notepads.
"lenovo is the hardware branch of IBM that was spun off. 
so even when it was IBM. What is currently Lenovo was still the manufacturer."
"But you can SOUND smart. Then theres us sparkies & welders & engineers who cant communicate to C levels a simple change that would save time and monet, while you can convince them to do damn near anything you want.

Oh and YOU get to go to the paid cocktail parties and have the nice company mercedes while I dont even get a gas card for traveling 50 miles 1 way to the jobsite.

Yes i am projecting on you."
"In most companies that shine matters a lot. I've chatted with big 4 consultants I've worked with and they actually have art departments for their presentations. Oh, their SMEs know their stuff (at least the ones we've hired), but they create a presentation and then a graphics artist polishes it. That cuts down on wasted time for the SME while also giving a much nicer output. And the artists understand visualizations of data and so on - it isn't just clip art. 

The visual polish definitely makes a difference with the PHBs. 

Obviously I try to polish my own stuff for the same reason, but it can get really time consuming and I don't have some huge library of templates to dip into or the same flair for doing it. 

I'm theory it shouldn't matter internally, but it does. And the promotions go to people who present their stuff well, or hire consultants to help them do it. 

Elon is like a breath of fresh air."
"Christ on a bike, ""You can tell his brain is struggling to bring his communication down to a different level but his material, process and insight is far beyond what others bring""

For a start he isn't some genius god talking down to mere morals, for another the guy isn't an engineer, he ain't designing shit, he has far more inteligent and capable engineers doing that for him."
"False. Elon is the best presenter. It's good for him to have a sidekick, but Elon's the man."
"Model 3 isn't very big at all. I think having experience producing ten million cars per year is more of the reason. Tesla is rapidly advancing on that front though, but at best they'll produce 1/20th of what VW produce in a year. Give it a decade and they could very well produce a similar amount."
Is that the ID3 where the wifi update did not work?
"That is because Tesla has been selling cars in Madrid for several years, while the ID.3 has been out for less than a month.  In Q3 VW sold 577 EVs in Spain, while Tesla sold 477, despite the ID.3 only being available for about 3 weeks."
Totally depends on how sales go. At the moment VW does not have an EV that interests me. They are all pretty ugly.
"Haha lets see about ""much lower"" manufacturing costs.. 
No other car manufacturer than Tesla has demonstrated the ability to build EVs profitable to date."
I asked his opinion because I wanted his perspective. I didn’t ask him for a list of specs or anything like that.
"Alright. 

Whether or not I agree with that, it’s interesting to see your perspective."
"Performance, value, customer satisfaction, customer service, quality control are all better with merc.

Not to mention, cutting edge tec? Tesla doesn't even come close."
"have you had both the Tesla and Mercedes?  
I can only tell anecdotes, but from my point of view, Mercedes has about 1 part failure in 5 years, while Teslas about 1 per year (almost all of them repaired under warranty or goodwill though). Internet forums and surveys shows it probably isn’t just an anecdote. But yes, Mercedes would probably not win any reliability contest, but still much better than Tesla"
No. But more reliable than Tesla.
There was an article today about a new model Y roof flying off while he was driving home. Not sure if Mercedes has had that particular issue. I’m a Tesla owner/fan just pointing this out for fun.
"I agree on buttons, but materials, comfort features, ride quality (in comfort, not in performance) and just ""look and feel"" is in my opinion vastly superior on Mercedes. Would prefer Mercedes without buttons though"
"Well you could say it has to do with quality of the design of the car. Obviously the range of the car and it's safety don't depend on the build quality of the car, which is what people are meaning when they talk about the quality. The designs of Teslas don't specifically state that that the paint should be thin and have imperfections, it's just how the cars turn out. The engineers are not making plans to create inconsistent seals that let water through or panel gaps that sometimes touch metal on metal. But you're trolling anyway and know what people mean."
"As long as suckers like us keep buying the cars, they don’t really have an incentive. Yes, I feel a little like a chump for enabling their poor quality.  Just don’t ask me about that when I’m driving the car.  😎"
"> It takes a big force to change the structure of the industry.

If Tesla isn't a big force in the battery industry, who is?

Now that Tesla have shown the world their tabless large format cylindrical batteries, how long until the rest of the industry starts up their photostats, even if they aren't aiming to participate in the Tesla supply chain?"
Why do you expect Tesla to outsell Non-Tesla EVs in Europe?
Yes.. but all of this means he should be calling himself something other than Chief Engineer. Like MD of product development. Even MD of Engineering. And there's nothing wrong with that title. It's a higher role and it's accurate! But he is trying to CULTivate this idea that he's the brains behind every single thing and it's insulting to the people who work these jobs.

"Please point us to one assembly on a car that Musk designed. And I'm not talking he discussed, and someone else designed."
No way in hell would a smart investor in TSLA want them to move towards dividends anytime soon.  They have the jump on 5-6 different markets.  Any resource they have that isn't going into R&D is against their MO and a reason to pull out imo.
"They didn't change the fundementals of car design, they have a better electric power train and batteries but that's it. There were electric cars build the same way before tesla but up until a few years ago we didn't have the battery tecnolgy to make electric cars viable.

Why should it have been done long ago? The range would be piss poor major car manufacturer have been working on more important things like building cars that don't fall apart and actually work for a long period of time. 

Solid constant reliable car manufacturing has only been achieved in the last few decades that's been there main focus and without it, tesla would never have worked."
"Tesla also started from nothing and developed most everything in-house. An established manufacturer has a several faster alternatives to bring a similar product to market, especially now that Tesla has largely established the viability of the technology and demand.

Not saying you're necessarily wrong, it could take years, but its also not unreasonable to say the transition could be made rather quickly with sufficient will and wherewithal at this point."
"Totally agree. Hydrogen seems really dumb given how much progress we've seen in EVs already. 

Kia and Hyundai are pushing the prices down in their own lines... they're still expensive but cheaper than a model 3. Lots of trade offs of course; the tech isn't as good... but then again you may not expect it to be if you can save 10-15K and get close to the same range. 

Both the Niro and the Soul claim to get 385KM range at about $42-45K (CAD). Compare that to a Model 3 in Canada, which starts at $53K for 400KM range. 

I still think Tesla has a way cooler car, and comparing it to 45K for a budget compact with an electric motor is not a bargain by any means. But if they can keep pushing on these offerings and finding optimizations I think it will make the idea of going EV a lot more compelling for people like me who just can't afford to spend 40, 50, or 60K on a new car. IMO $30K (CAD) for 400km range is the magic number."
"Fwiw my BMW has lasted 14.5 years so far, everything works great and the car is running strong. Now, maintenance has not been cheap but the car has been utterly reliable and durable. 

My Tesla, OTOH, is a nice car but it does not feel as solidly built. NFW it lasts nearly as long but whatever, it has sold me on EVs. My next car will be an EV too. But I’m probably never getting rid of the BMW."
This is exactly right.
"I had a 2012 Audi (bought in 2017) that I constantly had in the shop. Finally sold it (only got $10k for it) and I bought a model 3. The model 3 car loan is about 2.5x more than my initial loan on the Audi, and yet my model 3 so far (9 months in) only costs me 80% of the 2019 average months costs of my shitty worthless Audi. I’m factoring in gas, oil, maintenance, and the car loan itself. Constant electrical issues with the Audi and I only bothered fixing half of what went wrong with it at any given time so there was always something about it that I was unhappy with. The model 3 I literally would not change a thing about and it’s the most fun car I’ve ever owned."
Daimler AG is a massive company that didn’t get where they are today by not innovating. EVs are not the first major change in automobiles. A car from 1920 is vastly different than 2020 and all of the major companies adapted over the century to meet current and future demand. Tesla is in no way a unicorn in their approach to the future. They were just the first movers. You’d be absolutely foolish to discount the rest of the auto industry. Tesla absolutely lags behind them in quality control. Just look at the Porsche Taycan.

"i know what you mean. its worse when you can explain the problem and solution but they arent going to listen anyway. i drive a forklift and at my job we are recently switched to a wms system from good ol pen and paper and there are times i can tell its much slower than what we used to do. i used to be able to go to a location, grab however many full pallets and pick what i needed from the last one. now they split that up and the way the computer directs you to pick it is dumb. it goes by location and itll have you put really heavy stuff on light boxes thatll crush if you do. but its being forced on management by corporate and we cant put it off any longer. we have tried to provide input and were told to shut up. now were trying to fix some of the problems that may have been avoided if we could have provided input before the system was put in place."
"Hmm yeah. I've learned to really appreciate Elon's talks, but its like black coffee, its an acquired taste. Observing him has been an awesome learning experience in prioritizing what matters and resource allocation. He's just a master at it. Just so far beyond its hard to grasp. Personally, I'm a designer, animator, motion designer, and most of my clients are in the pharma or educational sectors. I work from home for myself, so I drive a Mazda 5 for the fam. Doing okay, haven't lost my house or health or sanity. My work ends up being creating materials for companies with really good fundamentals, doing the same old thing in crowded market spaces... similar to Daimler. When compared to Tesla or Spacex doing something completely disruptive the companies I work for are successful for other reasons... certainly not their presentations. I have however never been to a cocktail party, and if I had been, it would have been terribly awkward being around other people. Some of my clients do however do this kind of thing, schmoozing with each other and going in on business together.  So my self-employment is a tradeoff of freedom and stress. When it's good, it's far better than my alternatives, when it's bad it's terrifying. I've just gotten comfortable that if I ever let go of my work, there's nothing but the abyss below... or salaried employment at someone else's behest... which does absolutely suck from my early life experiences. I considered going into engineering and trades, and often regret it. I do woodwork as a hobby... like a few times a year and sit in front of a computer for 8-10 hours a day on projects that I know ultimately won't change the world and its been 3 weeks since I had a day off so when its rendertime I make stupid comments on reddit."
"Lots of janitors have great ideas, and terrible ones. There’s a skill set to abstract intelligent ideas into attractive ones, the problem is to be a decision maker you need leadership skills as well (and a desire to execute them). I throw ideas out and sometimes they stick, I throw even better bigger ideas out and they fall on deaf ears. But I don’t wan’t to be a supervisor to even gauge if I can be a good one. This is the institution of most companies, its how management has been trained to run things for hundreds of years. What I’m trying to say is its not the individuals fault, its the process within."

"He's no genius god. He's a fallible imperfect human with a lot of unique abilities. His job title at Spacex is literally 'Chief Designer' as well as CEO/CTO and at Tesla he is the 'Product Architect. He absolutely is designing and engineering shit and has gone into heavy detail about it pretty frequently. Maybe not every last actuator, but his primary skill isn't business leadership, though he's good at that, it is engineering. I think most people who follow Elon closely would agree."
I feel like I was the only one but having that other guy up there frustrated me to no end. I don't even know who he is and what he has done. Yes they might deliver the same content but Elon understands it on a totally different level and getting glimpses into that is why I love listening to him.
Now he hates media. He needs to book a course on presentation from apple or some else. Stutters like crazy and really doesn't know what the hell he is on about especially with regards to AI and FSD
Model 3 is bigger than Skoda Octavia. That is the most generic sedan in Europe. Most people still buy hatchbacks and small cars.
We’re they not on hold for ages because the over the air update would not work? And all these were pre orders?
"Some people feel the same way about Tesla, which is part of the why the e-Tron is outselling the Model X and the Taycan isn't too far behind the Model S despite being significantly more expensive.  I agree the styling of the ID.3 wouldn't play well in the US, but the ID.4 looks pretty good to me."
"Well vw is currently beating tesla is sales and they havnt started major production, 3 million evs a year across there brands in the next few years."
"Tesla hasn't been able to demonstrate the ability to build EVs profitably to date either (remember - they lose a lot of money without selling regulatory credits).  I think Porsche is probably the only brand that is really making a decent return on their EVs, but basically no one else can charge the premium Porsche can."
Sorry if I platformed ya mate. :(
The nice thing about facts are that they exist whether you agree or not.
"One year in on my model 3. No failures yet. Obviously this is anecdotal, but I think it’s wise not to compare rates from the model S and X, which are much more complex (and traditional), than the model 3 and Y. 3/Y are clearly built to reduce complexity, which ought to be positive for reliability. 

A friend of mine that has a Mercedes B250e (electric) hasn’t had that many issues either. Changed the motor under warranty last year, and the radar had to be changed the year before that. Other than that i think it’s been issue free. Battery, motor and other EV components are obviously courtesy of Tesla in that one though."
There was a time about a decade ago were Mercedes had rust problems everywhere. I think they're fixed now though
"You're not a chump, just an early adopter. I think we are just assuming that the corrections will indeed be made, one way or another. In Elon we trust..."
Couldn’t agree more.
I don’t. I mention that to reinforce that they’re no longer the only reputable EV brand.
"The issue really comes in with synergies. If you look at ever engineering choice as a individual choice its hard to make these arguments. The amount of variable quickly grows exponentially and blows up every model.

Doing it is easy if its like '2 million investment and we can replace these 3 plastic parts with 1 plastic part'.  However going from stamping to casting for example is the type of change that is gone impact every part of the car, the amount of evolution you can have in the part, the weight and so on. When the amount of variables increase the an analysis of future cashflow gets more and more complex. The uncertainty of each of those variable and how it is gone impact future cashflow is also gone grow.

Because of this, I think many companies turn to conservatism. If you have running buissness, such analysis for individual projects will often say 'most likely this is not worth it'. 

You need the visionary leadership to say, we need to drive towards this goal making many individual decisions that are hard to justify, but we have to trust that the overall product of these changes can come together in a better way even if we can't model exactly how this is gone happen. Maybe on some projects we spent to much money, but we also might find some easy wins along the way. 

No of course, there have been many failures of companies that had to much believe in their technology where they should have said 'lets make some money with this product before spending a bunch more money on it'.

So I am not on the MBA hate train, financial people are important as well, but I also believe sometimes you have to say 'fuck it'."
You mean present value of money “used to be” worth more than future value:-)
"I think it is less obvious with Tesla, but (thankfully) sunk-cost is not a fallacy you have to deal with much within Elon's blast radius... He is pretty ruthless about that shit..."
But is he wrong?

"I'd be shocked if he can't. I've watched him discuss physics and engineering in plenty of interviews, and SpaceX has been wildly successful with him as chief engineer. Saying there's 'controversy' around his education and speculating about random 'I took E&M 201 last term' questions doesn't mean anything.

I shouldn't be getting into internet arguments, I'm just annoyed when people with any amount of science knowledge puff themselves up by poopooing people like Musk."
"That's not his job anymore. He and Bill Gates are still considered engineers -- and great ones of our time. I'm an engineer. I've been an engineer since I was 6. If I retired today, would I no longer be an engineer? What if I had a medical degree and decided to solve a very specific engineering problem tied to the medical industry? Would I no longer be a doctor? Perhaps not in role, but definitely in terms of my individual identity & its affects on my worldview.

Musk and Gates definitely bring the perspective of an engineer to solve problems in ways that others normally wouldn't.

Pointlessly gatekeeping who is/isn't an engineer is really counterproductive. The post I responded to made petty remarks about how Musk has a BA instead of a BS which is like.. really? lmao"
I agree with that. My point wasn't that Tesla should start paying dividents anytime soon. My point was just that you ain't making a profit before you sell.
"an established manufacturer has metric fuck-tons of inertia. 
I think you are underestimating that. all car manufacturers have operated on a iteration and refinement for so long that its rare that they ""waste"" any actual cash on independent R&D."
"One of the things I think gets overlooked is the supercharger network. Tesla has something like 15k locations allowing long range travel in various locations around the world. That network took years to build, and even if the other manufacturers catch up on battery technology, they are years behind in building a comparable high speed charging network that allows long range travel comparable to what you can currently do in a Tesla."
"What faster alternatives? If you're talking about buying in expertise from outside, all that will do is hurt profitability. It will also hurt integration, and that is one of Tesla's strengths. There is no room on with an EV to give up *any* efficiencies. Evey scrap of waste power means more battery to give the same performance, and that means more weight, which means less range, and, and.....

The biggest problem is battery supply. Tesla has the most batteries, and now has a solid plan to make sure they keep it that way. They have the best prices, and that is going to get *much* better.

It will take an *enormous* commitment to catch up, and even bigger risks, I simply do not see it happening."
"You’re right, the fit and finish of Tesla definitely isn’t as good as BMWs, but I can definitely accept and understand Tesla having production quality and maybe even reliability issues. They really are doing cutting edge tech on a scale never seen before. 

But what’s BMWs excuse? Some nice upholstery somehow seems insufficient for having to deal with the negatives of BMW ownership, especially once outside the warranty period."
"Now you are just making up stuff.

>  discount the rest of the auto industry

I didn't say that. I said, Daimler specifically, focusing on short term profit was a bad idea during a revolutionary transition. 

> EVs are not the first major change in automobiles.

There is no question that going to a different type of engine and storage system is the biggest change. And autonomy is if anything even a bigger change."

"No his primary skill is investing and marketing not engineer.

He got fired from PayPal for being an idiot. 

Chief designer and project architect aren't real titles, they are honary ego boosts, he has hired some really legit aerospace engineering that run the technical side of spacex and a launch like the crewed dragon involves hundreds of thousands of people. 

He has no education in engineering, he's a buisness and physics major not an engineer. 

He might claim that but he claims a huge amount that mostly turns out to be bullshit."
"Honestly, I wished Elon would stop interrupting him. Usually he didn’t have anything of substance to add during his interruptions (or would say what the other guy was clearly about to if only he hadn’t been interrupted), and the other guy was a better presenter and better spoken."
That just seems like an incredibly shallow argument. Substance over surface.
"Living in Sweden I see model 3s all the time. Nothing strikes me about them being out of place by any means. We have lots of SUVs around, so they're pretty small where I live."
"VW said they would be released in the summer of 2020 and they were released on September 11th.  That isn't ""ages"" to me, particularly since we are on a Tesla forum.  You are correct that the pace of sales will likely slow a bit, the factory making the ID.3 is only going to have capacity to make 330k per year, and the current sales rate so far is more like 360k annualized."
But are model S sales not down since the 3 came out? And the Y is taking away from the X? I mean numbers for tesla are increasing by the looks of it. But who knows. For me it’s all good as long as the others are serious about BEVs.
It’s not a bad thing. It’s what tesla set out to achieve. Drive the adoption of BEVs. They have shown that it can be done.
Wrong.. https://twitter.com/jpr007/status/1314197117313802241?s=19
Great.
"That may be true. I have an experience with Model S 2014, Model X 2016, Model X 2018 and Model 3 2020. Model 3 have panel gap issues and fit and finish issues, but so far no other, but it's still new. Model X 2018 had about 8 issues (AC not cooling, no power steering, some squeaky things and rattles in the interior, falcon wing doors not closing, passenger doors not opening, yellow screen issue, infotainment crashing frequently, squeaky front suspension), Model X 2016, while I don't have details about every issue, owner told me he is in service 1-2 times per year and my Model S, 2014, had yellow screen, not working door handle, squeaky suspension, MCU stopped working and had to be towed to service (was not charging), changed power steering, changed charging port, changed motor, some steering clicking sounds that needs to be checked, not working sunroof, very slow supercharging (less then 5 minutes above 50kW), motor in mirror was changed, and it cannot be unlocked via an app. All of the issues were fixed under the warranty or goodwill.
Our family has a long history with Mercedes, but there was probably about one issue per five years. Same with the BMW."
You’re right.  I knew what I was getting into and made the choice.  No regrets.  We love the car.  Just sucks to see the company deliver on amazing advances in technology and fail on the fundamentals of building a quality car from the factory.  The people at my DC looked exhausted from dealing with shit that they really shouldn’t have to.

"This is often the mindset of young graduates. They think they are much more knowledgeable because they just learned a lot, however they really haven't mastered anything. It's one thing to be able to hold down a technical job and calculate your functions while it's another thing to be able to dream up new technologies and create new industry segments. Elon doesn't need to be able to calculate the precise measurements and parameters to make something work. His greatness comes from seeding ideas and bringing bright minds together to meet his goals.

Many bright engineers concluded that EVs are not feasible while Elon broke things down and said let's make this work."

Anymore? OK so you should be able to point to me one assembly he designed before it stopped being his job.

If you wanted to call yourself a Doctor you would require education and certification. Engineering is the same, it is a professional discipline and a controlled title, like MD or lawyer or CPA.

I disagree.  If you want to sell covered puts or something like that you could continue to make money without selling.  It depends what your goal is.
"Interesting how I think about it completely differently. I'm certainly not correct but here is my thought process. Tesla is going all in on battery manufacturing and design. The plan has been to double lithium battery manufacturing for the whole world and I don't remember all the numbers but thats a lot. Now they have also invested heavily into refining the process and chemistry. At the same time they can hide the important secret sauce and I think it will take a long time for anyone else to catch up to same battery performance and especially the battery manufacturing capacity and cost. While if I think about the charger network I think anyone can compete with that. It is far from mystery technology it is just some cables, transformers and electricity. If they want to compete they just need to find land for the spots and roll an extension cord. (Exaggerating but I mean electricity is everywhere) The land is probably the hardest part. But even there they can partner up with the dying gas stations or grocery stores or any parking spots available. Just say ""Hey I want to install a charger on your parking spot"" I think thats an easy sell. It will likely raise the value of that spot. But hey thats just my two cents. :) Let me know what you think in the comments below. ;)"

"No it's what musk said tesla is trying to do.

Big difference, if that's what they really wanted they would scrap there shity cars and instead sell the powertrains and batteries to manufacturers who can actually build quality cars. 

Not to mention they wouldn't revoke fast charging on any car that deem ""unsupported"" which is theft.

And they wouldn't attach rediculous conditions to the use of there super chargers for other manufacturers.

Musk can claim what he wants but his actions point to a different conclusion"
"Maybe I'm just bad at twitter, but I didn't see anything in there saying Tesla was not losing money without selling regulatory credits.  The company's financial statements confirm the same."
In the Middle East a Mercedes Drops in value like crazy the moment it’s out of warranty. The issues are just too big and costs or repairs to expensive. I am not saying tesla is better. But Mercedes certainly ain’t no Toyota.

Oh god it's this gatekeeping conversation. I guess it's to be expected if we're going to squabble about whether a BS is more elite than a BA. Whatever makes you feel superior, I guess.

There are a LOT of engineers who are a hell of a lot more knowledgeable in their disciplines -- and who will have meant far more to the world when they die -- than people who have degrees.

What's next? Are you going to bring up certification count? lol."
"From a technology standpoint the charging network is definitely easier for companies to compete with, but my point is from a timing standpoint I don't think they have really even started. That puts them well behind Tesla even if they start tomorrow. Also don't underestimate the importance of  being first in major technology transformations, as once a customer is invested in one it becomes increasingly difficult to switch to another."
No problem. 😊
Ok thanks. That’s interesting.

Yeah I don't come here to be bitched at. If you want a civilized conversation I'm all for it but trying to talk down to me will just get you ignored. If you talk to people like that IRL I can only imagine you don't have very long conversations either.
"I agree with you. I love my Tesla, but don't really love the company ( customer service ). But the real reason I would not consider an EV from one of the other manufacturers is the Supercharger network ( and that they all were dicks, slowing the adoption of EVs ). It's well integrated into the car ( trip planning, supercharger battery conditioning, on map status display ). Oh, and very high speed charge rate with my Model 3... Before my Tesla, I would spend a bunch of time with PlugShare figuring out my recharging for a trip. Now I just plug in the destination and go. I don't see any other manufacturer addressing the issue the way Tesla did..."
"I would also add, the Model X is clearly not production constrained either, given they have demonstrated the ability to produce 30-40% more than they currently are each quarter."
"Did you not miss the part where I gave credit to the power train and batteries, that's bits good, but everything on top is build like shite, and is really cheep."
There is probably more interviews that would convince you of him being a blowhard than an actual technical person.
"Do you gatekeep others' degrees IRL? How does that generally go? Do you think you are a more accomplished engineer than Elon because according to you, he isn't an engineer?

Cmon, stop projecting lmao."
"I want a car that gets me from A to B no matter the distance I want to go and does it as an EV. The rest i do not really care about. I am not a car snob, for me it’s a tool. The Tesla’s build in Germany will be much better than the American ones."
"Engineer is a protected title for liability sake, it's an accreditation provided by a institution.

That's like bitching about not being called a doctor because your self taught and didn't go to medical school"
"Then get a vw id3, it's cheaper, better built, has better customer support and will be far more reliable."
"> Engineer is a protected title for liability sake, it's an accreditation provided by a institution.

That highly depends on where you are from. Words are defined differently in the UK vs Canada vs the US for example. If the word ""chef"" referred to an astronaut in British parlance, I, someone living in the US, would not be incorrect in saying ""Gordon Ramsey is a chef"". Musk isn't incorrect in calling himself an engineer given he's from the US, where an engineer is someone who practices engineering, and engineering broadly includes chemical engineering, software engineering, electrical engineering, environmental engineering, etc and isn't narrowly defined to ""one who builds engines and physical structures"" or ""one who has received an iron ring after passing some arbitrary certification process"". And even in places which have such protected classes, that's still a pretty dated definition given we're not living in the 1800's anymore & STEM now is a bit more developed than STEM then. To put it one way, the fathers of any engineering discipline would not have passed whatever arbitrary processes we define -- yet we'd still consider them engineers.

At best, in the US you might say Musk isn't a licensed engineer. Which is like, meh. It's generally a bit cringeworthy if people brag about their licensing / accreditation to dismiss others' actual accomplishments. 

I've heard numerous arguments for gatekeeping non-mechanical engineers, e.g. ""they don't do anything that can kill people"" or ""they don't do fluid dynamics"" but like... a mechanical engineer who designs a structurally sound audio-jack isn't really doing anything that can kill people either. A material fab engineer would not necessarily practice fluid dynamics. Such narrow definitions are going to be even more dated and silly 100 years from now, like saying that programmers are just ""people who enter inputs into machines"" (1950's) or even further back, ""someone who plans events"" (1900's)."
"How is it cheaper? All the prices I have seen are about the same. And there are no chargers for the ID3 in my area. There is several for Tesla’s. VW is just not there yet. Maybe in a few years. But by that time Tesla will have the cheaper batteries and made in Europe cars.

Until then I will just keep driving my ICE car on long trips and car sharing Renault Zoe for the city driving. 

Also I do not want to buy VW anymore since the diesel thing. I do not trust them."
"Please show musks engineerimg achievements then, cause as far as I can tell he doesn't have any."
"One doesn't actually need engineering achievements to be an engineer. You're moving the goalposts. This is basically a no true scotsman argument.

Also, you already know what Musk's achievements are. I'm not interested in a recursive discussion about whether leading a privately-funded rocket to orbit or optimizing factories are engineering achievements, since they clearly aren't as they don't involve building stone bridges or towers."
"So your saying you don't have to be trained or an ccredited engineer, or actually do any engineering work to be an engineer? Wtf?

Not I don't but musk didn't do that himself, being an investor and buisnessman doesn't make you an engineer. He hired far more talented, intelligent and capable people who are actually engineers to design the products at tesla and spacex.

Calling it his engineering achievement when it was the works of hundreds of thousands is just disgusting."
"> So your saying you don't have to be trained to be an engineer engineer?

You don't need formal training according to the definition used by a significant part of the world. That might not align with your country's definition of an engineer. I'm not sure what's the disconnect here.

> So your saying you don't have to be accreddited to be an engineer?

Nope. The process varies from country to country. Some countries consider software engineers programmers. Others consider them, material engineers, environmental engineers, etc to be engineers. 

> Calling it his engineering achievement when it was the works of hundreds of thousands is just disgusting.

Okay, it's... their collective engineering achievement then? Including his."

As someone completely unfamiliar with charging rates can someone explain how this works in the US? How much would a full charge normally cost you? Do you fully charge or just charge enough to get home? And are charging stations not affiliated with Tesla compatible with a Tesla and do they cost more or less than a Tesla charging station?
Finally Canada can brag about something being cheaper there than in other countries. Their internet prices are stupid high for what they offer.
"Huh, about time Canada got a good deal on something"

UK doesn’t exist?
That Switzerland flag is bothering me
"Interesting.

But we all know that the very best electrons come only from IONITY, for the very low price of €0.79 ($0.93) per kWh. /s"
Where’s the uk?
Go Canada go! All those hydro power plants are sweet!
in Germany it's cheaper to ride diesel
*MOM! WE'RE MOVING TO CANADA!*
"So, if I understand this correctly...

If you have a 100kWh Tesla Model S, it would cost $27.50 to go from 0-100% at a Korean Supercharger currently?"
"AFAIK, it is free in Italy. At least I paid nothing when I was there in February."
Ireland comes it at around 0.295 USD per kW which isn’t as bad as I thought it’d be.
"Newb question....so, what would be the total average charge cost for a Tesla owner then? In the US...."
What’s the US numbers?
Did you factor in that taxes are already added in Europe?
"OP here. Correction. The caption should’ve been “per kWh in Tier1 in USD”. I made this plot for my video explaining recent change in Superchargers rate in Korea. [https://youtu.be/Sw\_dLtlDy28](https://youtu.be/Sw_dLtlDy28) .There's no Tier 1 or 2, but only a flat rate of 313 KRW/kHw (or 0.275 USD/kWh), so I was confused which one is 60 kW or below. Also, Netherland”s”!"
"***Netherland***

&#x200B;

lmao"
I thought I was having a stroke whole reading the title
Now add gas prices in that chart.
So how much would a full battery cost?
"These need to be adjusted for average income or, at least, vehicle price."
I love Canada
So how much does a full charge cost in average?
"Post peak prices, it’ll be interesting to see the same chart with everyone’s peak pricing. I rarely 0.28 anymore, typically like 0.34 if I remember correctly"
Go Canada! We’re last so really we’re first
Why is there only one Netherland?
Every thing in denmark is expensive. We also pay a 180% VAT on cars.
"These actually send expensive... Electricity around me is around 8c - 12c a kWh....

I understand that delivering more current at once it's harder, but damn.... A 3-4 tones increase in price?"
Ofc Germany is always expensive
"""Average charge rate per minute or kw"". So then this chart shouldn't be comparative since we don't know which ones are which. And charge rate per kw? Shouldn't it be charge rate per kwh?"
You forgot Mexico. It’s still 0.
Theres something canada doesn't pay an insane amount for. Now do one for internet and cell phone costs.

I've never used a supercharger (only had my car about 8 months).  But it appears that a super charger costs almost as much as gasoline...
Ireland price? Per kWh?
How much money does this translate to fill the car? And how long does it take?
"CANADA FTW!!!!!!!!

...sorry for the swears, eh."
"I feel like Canada is only so low because there’s still so little EVs here. 

We’re still in the free part pf the freemium game."
"Tesla just raised prices. So in Sweden we pay up to 0,54 usd per kWh. Really sucks..."
How come Germany is so high and Canada low
"WHy so expensive in Germany, Denmark, Spain and Hong Kong?"
*Early buyers laugh in free*
here to Greece i assume it will be around 0.22 to 0.30
"I was under the impression that Germany is entirely running on clean energy, which i would assume could bring prices down.  why is it so expensive?"
When you’re grandfathered in to free supercharging >
"Internet und Strom, das können wir..."
"Yay, finally Canada isn't the worst on a ""world's most expensive something"" list!"
Serious question...what makes the costs so expensive in Germany? Accessibility or?
why is it so cheap in canada?
how many miles on average can you get out of $0.28 per kwh on a Model Y?
"Damn we Germans made the first place again, are the other countries even trying? /s"
Is it actually cheaper to charge in Canada VS USA? Canada has some weird charging scheme.
Wow surprised to see rhat Canada is at the bottom of the list.
And the uk thanks to a shit brexit deal is £2.89
"The graph should instead compare it to the price of energy in each respective country. In Canada, in my province (Quebec) the kWh is sold roughly at $0.06 USD so it’s almost 3 times the energy cost."
"my country is expensive but shit at something so they charge the highest while improving the slowest

bigger examples:

transportation (bus/train/subway)

internet..."
"In Québec it only costs 0.07$ (CAN), it's super cheap here"
"For your pleasure let me remind you that really common travel is from Norway to Italy so we are missing Swedish and Italian low prices. When ever someone from Norway drives to Italy it must be such a rollercoaster ride.
Danish prices will lower over time as our taxes are going down quite a bit over the years."
i guess United Arab Emirates wins with 0$/kw until 2022 at least
Wow.. go CANADA ;)
Oh Canada - high gas prices and extra low electricity prices.  U guys should be leading in BEV adoption like Norway.
"Canada pays for time, not consumption, so inclusion here is false."
"Holy shit... So I don't own a Tesla yet (waiting on the Truck before I break the piggy) and just always assumed the charging stations were free. .275 is over twice the cost for electricity. I work in the energy sector and know energy costs inside and out. Tesla in the USA at least probably pays .05-.07 for the commercial rated energy and then resells it at that cost?

I'm actually shocked. I always assumed the electricity supply was part of the incentive infrastructure of buying a Tesla. I had no idea they are upcharging so much and turning a direct profit off of it. I guess I just assumed it was a marketing and operational cost they absorbed."
why is korea highlighted here?
Supercharging is actually free in italy afaik (no tesla for me yet) thanks to a legal quirk
Well Home energy  prices in germany are 0.27 to 0.36 $ cents/ kwh... So supercharger is only slightly more costly as it should be. Most of that are taxes and fees.
"I pay 4.5c per kWh in Minnesota from 11pm-7am. Dream come true.
Or normal rate of 13.7c at normal hours. (Connexus energy off peak program)"
"Live in a rental building and Im paying nothing since. Long live HOA, just for this one time."
"Comparing rate at home to rates at a super charging station is really not a fair comparison. Most people pay the premium for supercharging is for the speed and the convenience and while they are on the go, I don’t think people use supercharger daily unless they have long commute daily. Where I live in California we have tons of free charging stations but they are slow and inconvenient."
I pay ~0.10/kWh for 100% renewable in TX... wouldn't think of paying that crazy amount
"To be fair, Germany gas prices are about 2x the prices as USD. So this is consistent to the savings you see for swapping from gas to electricity in the states."
"Where do you live to get such cheap energy? I have a special EV rate at home in California, after midnight it’s 17¢ per kWh but between 3-4 pm and 9-midnight its 36¢ and 4-9pm it’s 54¢. Before getting on my EV rate I was paying 28¢ per kWh at home as the starting tier, going up to a max of 56¢!"
"I pay 5p/kWh between 00:30 and 04:30 here, in the UK.  Or about ~$0.065/kWh.

It's about 3x higher outside of these hours."
"Chart is incorrect, I paid 0,39ct kw/h in Germany and 0,33ct kw/h in Switzerland in September during a roadtrip. In the Netherlands I pay 0,30 at a supercharger and 0,25 at home at average (all prices converted from Euro to dollar cents at current rate)"
"About 14 cents go to the building fond for renewable energy production. If you got solar panels you can make a contract with your local energy company, so you are only paying about 10 cents at home. You deliver energy at day in the public network and get this amount cheap back at night."
Where
"I pay the same in Huntsville, AL."
More like 16 cents after fees.
"> Germany certainly makes me appreciate the ~$0.08/kWh I pay at home. Actually, all of those do.

Well, you certainly don't have 350kw outlets at home."
"Germany had a robust nuclear program.  Major political campaigns spanning decades led them to decommission all of their reactors in favor of renewables. Don't worry, their coal consumption spiked to pick up the slack. Meanwhile, France next door has 1000% less emissions


If you ever try to argue with a German about this, they will tell you that nuclear waste will end all of humanity and it cannot be contained. The rest of the world just piles the couple hundred square feet of it out back in hopes of reusing it in the next couple decades.  Russia is already running two commercial breeder reactors."
£ 0.26 per kWh (\~ $0.34)
"Was wondering why the fuck we’re left off, being one of the leaders in green vehicles."
"Hey you at least have CCS, right?"
CZ and AT didn't even make it to the list
"The UK hasn't even made the list, quite possibly because the chart doesn't go high enough."

"Danish politicians:

>Yes more green and electric cars, haha do the good environment

Also Danish politicians:

> marks up the tax of ev's

> puts one of the highest prices for charging your car in the world

> marks up tax of ev's again

> taxes solarpanels for corporations for solar power so highly that no company can possibly make it a viable solution"
"Our reinvestment to refurbish some of our CANDU reactors and to build modular reactors to phase out natural gas plants also makes me happy. I want to see more renewables though, outside of hydro"
Im actually surprised! For once Canada doesn’t have the worst rates!!
"I don't know where they got the numbers though. It says rates are for Tier 2, but here in BC the lowest Tier 2 rate I've seen is CAD$0.44/min, which is about USD$0.333. Not even close to $0.17."
Can't forget about the unlimited premium connectivity for certain Canadian Model 3 builds!
"Considering it works out to about $65,000 for a base Model 3, I guess this makes me feel a little better as someone considering purchasing one Q1 2021."
Canadian prices are misleading... Tier 2 is 44 Canadian cents and that's not 0.17 USD!
"Come on man, spoilers /s"
Fun fact: Canada has the 2nd largest nuclear power plant in the world (Bruce generating station).
You are. We yielded with our super idiot president
Electricity is one of the few things that’s cheaper in Switzerland.
Our taxes are also lower
Dams... dams everywhere. We also have a few nuclear power plants which covers the rest in this small country.
"Germany appears to be pretty crazy regarding power prices. It’s neighbor to the south, Austria, has only a 0.27$ fee at the supercharger."
That's what you get for banning nuclear.
"Don’t know why you got downvoted. It’s true.

2.9 DKK = 0.46 USD"
"Ye our tax on electricity is bonkers. Just looking at the split of your bill for electricity is like 10% the actual cost, 25% network fee and 65% tax or something."
Hydro in Nepal is also allowing such rates to be possible. Although the number of charging stations can be counted on two hands .
"Our revenge for those internet prices!

&#x200B;

(or consolation prize?)"
At least it makes the roi on solar like 1year lol
Was Energiewende a mistake?
a euro is worth more than a dollar and the picture in this thread is in dollars.
"that's a single approximation.  ive seen the prices fluctuate on the same day across multiple locations in the same country, including germany."
"Maybe it's pre/post tax. In Germany prices are normally given including taxes.
With 19% VAT this would make sense. 35*1.19=42
But idk, if all the other prices also include tax it would still be the most expensive"
"This chart is misleading as the rate is not constant throughout each country. It depends on location and the price of electricity there locally.

A full charge is battery capacity * price/kwh. Model 3 has a 75 kwh capacity. At $.10/KWh that’s $7.50 to go 325 miles or 2 cents a mile. Gas costs 7 cents a mile for a 25 mpg car at $1.75/gallon

You charge as much as you want at a SC but generally enough to get to your destination.

All charging stations types work with a Tesla. Most that charge money cost about the same and are far slower"
"Yup - just got 1000/500 Mbit for cheaper price and my good friends over the big lake there just cried. The ""telco"" mafia makes Denmark look like early 2000's Sweden. How I hated playing MMO's with Swedes back then on my ADSL."
"A good chunk of it is hydroelectric, so pretty clean too :)

""Hydroelectricity accounted for 25.7% of Canada's total  energy consumption (37.3% of non-oil sources). It is the third-most  consumed energy in Canada behind oil and natural gas (30.9% and 28.1% of  total consumption, respectively).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity_in_Canada#cite_note-2)"
Yes we are such an advanced country here in Germany. It’s such a joke how far we are behind in digitalization and energy.
Can't wait for Australia to copy this model (not). The government has been toying with the idea of adding a new fuel tax for electric cars. They already have a flat rate of 40c per litre of fuel as tax and are annoyed because EV's bypass that
"You just wrote 12+10+6+1% are non taxation related stuff besides the fee's then writes its not. Stop spreading confused and maddness - we already hate this type of misunderstanding here.
Also tax part e.i. the 39% is going down and being removed entirely when primary heat source etc. plus that means VAT part of that is also going down. No matter who is in government as far as I can tell.

Stop spreading FUD"
"Well it only makes sense for them to tax electricity which is obviously an optional thing that people can live without, unlike a free college education which is a mandatory human right."
OP here. Sorry there was a typo.  I meant Tier 1. It says 0.22 CAD per minute at or below 60kW without specifying it is Tier 1 or 2.
Look at the price for gas you'll be even more surprised.
Probably close to nothing or they're even paying on top
"Nope generally not. As for everything you have to  compare to what you get for your buck.
Now in this case actually there is about 50% you could and they will, finally mostly, cut. Took them about 20 years too long but better than nothing.

But say our healthcare system is like 1/3 of US prices with only slightly lower service level. We actually have IT scandals about using off the shelf US healthcare system and how the whole payment structure fucks with work flow when you don't need it. There is shitty corner stuff and issues like some don't want to spend 0.5 or 2% more tax to get it to a near perfect service level so they can't improve much outside new buildings etc. But generally the coverage is everything except dental with no hidden traps so we just are whiney compared to NA standards."
As a Swiss it makes me happy because it's as it should be.
Come on Tesla Nepal! 🇳🇵
Lol
"Not anymore, now the prices varies from 0.30 to 0.33 euro, depending on location. It was free because Tesla couldnt legally sell electricity in this country."
Depends on how often said owner relies on the supercharger. There are plenty of people who own Teslas but never use superchargers. It's not intended for regular use.
"It's on the graph as 28¢ per kw hr, but it varies significantly based on your location."
charging for charging!
"Price comprison to travel from Seoul to Busan (~400km) in KRW. From the top, gasoline, diesel, Korean EV charger rate, and Supercharger. [Gas price vs Supercharger in Korea](https://imgur.com/gallery/p4USqXR)"
"$10,000

the price of electricity matters very little compared to the materials, manufacturing and shipping"
Why?  Does electricity get cheaper based on the national wage ?
"You’re not just paying for the electricity as you would at home.  You’re paying for the costs in building the site, maintaining/repairing the site, a high capacity grid connection, possibly the cost of leasing the land.  All of these expenses run in to the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

It’s perfectly reasonable that the cost for supercharging (or any sort of ultra-rapid charging) is 3-4x the cost of charging at home."
"not everywhere has access to enough hydro electricity for the surrounding industry and population.

I do expect power costs to lower worldwide as solar and batteries mature and get installed.

right now if you spend$10,000 on a 10Kwh battery and cycle it everyday for ten years before throwing it in the garbage (i imagine that the 'core' charge of a battery like this will be significant - but there aren't many details available today!) it will add $0.27/kwh to your power.

so if solar was free and the batteries are that expensive (they aren't) then the price for power would be a minimum of $0.27/kwh. [Solar is getting close to 'free' - companies are winning bids with prices \(tarifs\) of around $1.3c/kwh](https://ieefa.org/why-india-cant-match-the-gulf-regions-record-low-solar-tariffs/)

How was that math? not bad.  1:1 makes math easy, but if we are looking at bigger batteries today you are looking at $127K for 232kwh

https://electrek.co/2020/03/31/tesla-powerpack-price-commercial-solar/

plus if you have solar and wind you might never need as much batteries as you have production, but its still a good place to start.

Coal is expensive - but you pay for it with global climate change and other externalized costs."
"well, premium connectivity is $0 for me. 2019 SR+

I pay $15 a month for province wide calling, unlimited texting and 12 gigs/90 days

I pay a portion of $45 for 250mbps internet.

Are we really doing that bad?"
"In an example I just provided in another comment, I once added 170 miles for $11.18. I used to pay about $33 to add 520 miles to my Accord. Doing the math, that comes out to $34.19 to cover the same distance under those conditions.

That's about as close as you can get with so many variables at play."
"You're never supposed to drain the battery completely, nor are you supposed to fill it. The version or tier of supercharger, size of the battery, whether or not you are sharing on older superchargers, battery temperature, whether or not you preconditioned the battery, and current battery charge level all play a role in how long it takes to charge.

An example ""typical"" charge in my history took the battery level from 21% to 76% and the expected range from 66 to 235 miles. I was at a v2 supercharger, so it took 25 minutes to add 40.8 kWh at a cost of $11.18."
"You're misinformed. Germany god rid of nuclear power in a hurry after Fukushima, and instead switched to clean, beautiful coal. Good times."
It’s not even a profitable business yet. People really assume that setting up a charging station is cheap and don’t factor in demand charges.   On the road charging will be 2x the price of home charging with no subsidies in a competitive market.  Tesla is playing very fairly.
"You really shouldn't be using superchargers unless you are traveling. You will be doing 95% of your charging at home, and most hotels have free charging spots for EVs. The only time you should be using these is for long distances. I take an over 800-mile round trip about every month and it only costs me about 25 dollars in supercharging fees in my M3SR+. You can't really beat that in any ICE vehicle."
"Electricity isn't the only cost in running a supercharger.  There is the cost to deploy the charger, and maintain it.  It also uses land, and the property owner may receive some of the money.

Then you have just general supply/demand - they probably want to have enough of a premium to discourage people from using it if they have an alternative, that way there aren't lines at superchargers all the time, impeding those who don't have another option.

I think supercharger pricing is great.  If I'm on a road trip the cost is reasonable and spending a few dollars to charge up isn't a big deal - I'll probably spend as much on snacks/etc for that segment of driving.  However, the cost is high enough that most people aren't just going to use it as their primary way to charge.

Keep in mind that nothing is ""free.""  Free chargers are a frustration for me, because they're ALWAYS occupied.  If I'm driving 150 miles to some location where I'll spend the day, and they have free chargers, that means I'm going to arrive, find all the chargers occupied, and then I have to park and let my car sit all day.  Then I have to try to find a supercharger on the way home, which is more expensive, more wear on my battery, and requires me to sit around for 20min waiting.  

On the other hand, if the chargers charge a 50% markup on electricity then chances are most of them will be free.  The locals whose batteries are at 80% won't be leaving their cars plugged in to get $1 worth of free electricity, since now it will cost them $1.50.  Those whose batteries are at 20% won't mind paying a bit more for the convenience of being able to leave with a full charge.  

You need to charge something just so that people don't tie the thing up all day.  The local driver has lots of options.  The person coming a long distance doesn't.  You need to try to accommodate the latter."
"that was only in the very beginning and only for the super expensive model s and x you basically paid so much for the car that all the electricity you will realistically use over its lifetime was already priced in so it was not really free.

beside this even with the high cost superchargers and all other charging networks operate at a loss or break even at best, even Ionity chargers in Europe that charge 0.79€/kWh are not profitable because the cost to install and maintain the chargers is high but the number of EV´s on the road is tiny."
And those other chargers you see at office buildings and such can cost as much per mile as gas.  I remember plugging my car in for the first time at work and was shocked to have a $20 charge for 150 miles.

"That’s fairly close to what energy prices are here in California. $.23-$.50/kWh

I’m paying $16/month for an EV plan that reduces electricity from 12am-6am to $.09/kWh"
It’s why a home solar system makes so much sense in Germany.
">0.36 $ cents

gave me a stroke"
[removed]
Germany has to subsidize it's coal industry somehow...
[deleted]
Taxes and fees for what exactly. 'Special big oil middle finger electricity'?
"Wow that's awesome, I don't have time of day pricing, think I'm paying about 13c per kWH.

Do your numbers include distribution or is that a separate fee?"
That's a bit cheaper than Wright-Hennepin's off peak program at $0.06/kwh.
Aren't you paying indirectly though together with all the others that pay for your cars electricity?
Wow you're paying $10 for that drink at this fancy bar we're at? Pffft I get vodka at home for $8 a whole bottle!
Yea I pay 0.07c in alberta. These rates are whack.
"Is this distribution costs and taxes included? I pay around 0,23€/kWh all included (electricity + distribution + taxes + averaged fixed costs) in Belgium for 100% renewable."
"This isn't home electricity rates though, it's supercharger rates. You're also paying for the convenience."
"Not really no. Especially not now.   
Using a diesel car is currently cheaper when doing long trips."
So around $6 a gallon?  Diesel is still $3 a gallon here.  I have to go to two stations to fill up our 3500 since they lock my card out at $80.
I live in Florida. According to my bill my cheapest energy is .08 cents up to 500kwh anything after that is .09 cents.
we get bent over in CA with PG&E but it still beats gas at nearly $4/gallon
">If you ever try to argue with a German about this, they will tell you that nuclear waste will end all of humanity and it cannot be contained.

I mean, even if that were true, it's still a more stringent line of reasoning than what the average nuclear bro has.

""nucular is, like, cool'n stuff.""

I'm pro-nuclear, but i have to admit that the average anti-nuclear german tends to have spend an absolute minimum effort on trying to understand the pros and cons of nuclear power, which is something i'm absolutely not seeing on ""my"" side.

Pretty frustrating."
24p at the superchargers near me
"Yes,indeedy."
I'm not sure why people think CCS is better. It's a fatter plug and doesn't slide in as easily and the US doesn't use CCS anywhere anyway so there's no point talking about it.
"&#x200B;

AT is \~0.33€. Was 0.28€ before the recent increase."
"The UK would actually be between New Zealand and Finland (0,34)"
I remember maybe 10 years ago I had someone from the govt doing a survey call me to “get my opinion on CANDU.” I asked “the reactors?” “Yup!” “lol they’re fine?” Does the average person know enough about them to even form an opinion? I’m all for nuclear.
"Wait really? I've been saying nuclear is the way to go. I've seen videos of modular reactors and they look amazing. 

So far we got hydro, wind farms, solar, tidal power and hopefully nuclear soon that's not ""scary"" to the public.

Only one opposing it I'm assuming is Alberta"
"You are at a big disadvantage with respect to solar, isn't it?

Edit:
Maybe you guys can help us build a pillar to the sky and harness the solar energy

https://www.space.com/25120-pillar-to-the-sky-book-william-forstchen.html"
Why hydro is the bomb for the northern hemisphere.
"The bottom of the chart says per minute or per kW, but I think that part is wrong.

If you take the $0.44/min rate, and convert it using V2 supercharging speeds:

    $0.44/min / 150 kW/60min = $0.176/kW

My brain is still waking up, and those units don't look right to me, but the numbers seem to work. Can someone verify my math here?"
Yeah uhm here in Québec power is 6¢ the kWh so we skew the average quite a bit...
Yeah I was wondering about this too
Which ones? I had no idea
Internet is a pretty good deal too. Also COL/income in a city is pretty cheap compared to some places I've lived.
The cost of producing the electricity only accounts for a tiny fraction of the price. The majority of the price is just taxes and fees.
We germans want the moaning rights on this one
"Exactly, 2/3 is taxes (including VAT) .. you even pay VAT of the taxes"
"in BC electricity is used for heating homes (not exclusively) and warm homes is a basic need, and therefore all the taxes are waived on electricity.  Pretty nice.

amusingly, houses aren't a basic need, so to hell with the homeless."
Yes but they already but some and they are coming down. If you had electric heater say ait to water pumps you get a huge discount being cut to 0 so only pay transmission and VAT some time soon*TM*
"That’s what I was thinking!

Wait till bell and Rogers figure out a way to fuck us!"
True. Unfortunately Solar roof is going to take 9999 years here as well.
The way it was started I think so. Rushed out of nuclear energy but kept coal alive until 2030...
"$0.42 is about €0.35, yes.  
And with the link I provided you can check the price in other countries as well, so I thought it useful."
"No, it's just USD not EUR in the picture"
"True, for all the fees and I will call it ""price-premiums"" on everything you could think we could advance further in those sectors... Sure hope that prices will drop at some point once there is a good renewable energy production established... Even though I highly doubt something like this will happen..."
"but running all over the city to collect and submit piles of paperwork and forms to different government agencies is one of my favorite hobbies in Germany. Not to mention, I carry Francs and cards so I can't even purchase food at some locations (this is improving)."
"Before someone who doesn't understand tries to point it out PSO is not a TAX it's a way to get cheaper and faster conversion into green electricity by investing strategic outside local grid owners. Prices would be worse and transformation slower without so noone who understands the industry would like to be without it.

It's the kind of thing people point as an example to follow. Leaving it all up to local grid and producers is not smart. That's why we have stuff national transportation and grid agencies."
Yup normally Denmark can't up too much or people will just drive to Germany for candy or gas but here our electricity per giga joule costs more than our gas.
Any update available on how they are doing building this grid out across America?
Exact same in Portugal.
Sorry I guess I didn’t sleep enough last night. I’m pretty sure I thought I read them all. 😅
"Yes, often. Everything's in dollars, but not everyone earns dollars, so you're seeing effects of the foreign-exchange rate, not the effective price of the electricity to someone who is domicile in those countries."
"Ahhhhh. 

That makes sense actually. I didn't consider that aspect."
"This actually makes a lot of sense and seems much more clear. 

Thanks for taking the time to reply so in depth :)"
"You are correct, not sure what I was referring to.  An article about them selling their excess energy to surrounding countries probably"
"Success story, coal and russian natural gas"
Also the original commenter price ignored the fact that commercial energy isn't usually green in the US. At least initially Superchargers are supposed to use green energy.
Tesla just had its fifth straight profitable quarter.
"SO the reason I quoted .05-07 was because .03 is the retail rate for electricity, so I padded in a bit more to take into consideration the rest of the hands down the line. I think that's a pretty accurate pricing considering the value a charging charging station brings to an area when the are set up non-intrusive spaces. 

When Tesla is competing against combustible engines, they really should make the cost per mile significantly lower. Using a charging station at that rate is barely below what a combustible engine delivers."
"My current ICE gets ~30 mpg. Gas is like $2.20 a gallon in my area. Your $20 in electric is almost double what my cost for gas would have been.

Luckily electricity in my area is ~$0.10 a Kwh, so when I get my tesla I'll just charge at home with the exception of road trips."
"Oh, thanks lol."
"O cool!! I'll need my gf who is korean to translate for me, haha"
"Do you have power walls (or similar on site storage?) Based on my rough math, you'd need to use at least 7Kwh per night to break even on the $16/month fee.

Edit: math is wrong. And I’m not smart enough to figure out what a f’d up. Sorry"
Wow! Are you in SoCal? I'm up north and we pay an average of $.17 kWh in the summer time.
9 cents pwer kWh.  It's not PG&E is it?
"That's higher than Atlanta 24hr rate of 0.07/kWh however I should add they also add a connection fee and a small penalty for the highest usage during peak. It's complicated, but as far as charging its 0.7 or 0.13- 0.04 on a tiered plan"
Nothing makes me feel smug quite like having a relatively cheap ($0.10-$0.12/kWh 24/7) municipal power provider that's surrounded by PG&E territory.
"In Silicon Valley, I pay about 28.1c/kWh - that is including all taxes, transportation fees, etc. etc.. Basically calculated by taking my full electrical bill portion and divided by the number of kWh. This is the tiered use plan, I don't use enough electricity to switch to the time of use or EV plan, especially during Covid. For non-Covid times, my employer has free Ev charging."
Is california one of the more expensive states for electricity? I know they have significant grid issues - but here in illinois it's like half or less that
Holy shit that's more than I expected
Sadly if the new eeg regulation gets passed in 2021 you'd have to pay 3cents/kwh for power you use yourself from your residential solar :(
I feel like a whole solar system is hard to fit into an average middle class plot of land
At retail cost about the same as diesel and slightly cheaper than gas....
"Germany leads the world in renewable energy in terms of % generation to % consumption.

https://www.bmwi-energiewende.de/EWD/Redaktion/EN/Newsletter/2019/07/Meldung/direkt-answers-infographic.html"
No it's all the subsidies for nuclear and heavy Industries. Not for coal.
27-36 cents/kwh
"Electricity meter, line usage, VAT (Sales Tax), Electricity Tax (Used to Offset the CO2 footprint from coal and oil powerplants).

You know, communist stuff /s"
Coal industry subsidies and just generally Germany loves to tax it's citizens
"I’m not sure what you mean by distribution. I have the charge for my electricity usage, Govt tax and a 13$ a month charge for service.
Edit:
They don’t just automatically have time of day, it’s actually something I had to sign up for. Not sure how it works in most areas. But the circuit actually ties into the main service panel, goes into another separate meter then to both of my garage outlets for my Ss. When I signed up they had time of day and off peak (so I have a meter for each). So the time of day the circuit will actually shut down if I try to use it outside of those hours. But I also have a switch box installed to switch over to a time of day meter which has variable rates.
Definitely see if your power company offers a program like that though. They want you to use most of your power at night since there’s less demand and grid load so electricity is cheaper since you won’t be charging off a peak plant or anything. Most do but not all."
I have a similar plan in from a different utility in the same area.  The meter is powered from 11pm to 7am and my rate is $0.06/kWh.  My regular rates are $0.095/kWh with an additional power cost adjustment  of $0.029750.  So basically paying $0.125 this time of year.  We have a $17.90 basic charge and I got a $19.79 credit for off peak AC.   Taxes were about $13 last month.  If I apply all of those to my non-EV portion of the bill it averages out to about $0.135/kWh.  I used 1057 kWh for my regular usage and 454 kWh for my car.
Im not paying the HOA. Rent directly from landlord/owner.
You should probably be spending a bit more than $8 a bottle.  Have some dignity!
Lie !   I saw you sneaking in that bottle and pouring free drinks to impress the hotties!
Plus distribution fees which scale per kWh consumed (“hi!” from Alberta.) Still only like CAD$0.15/kWh depending on your provider and area.
"Yeah, you need to compare apples to apples.  

My generation rate is something like 7-9 cents, but if I take my total bill and divide it by total usage it is closer to 14 cents/kWh.  Transmission, distribution, billing, and taxes/fees/etc add to the total.  All of that scales with usage, so when considering the cost to operate my car I include all of it."
For the next 2 months. Than there will be a increase.
100%
Makes a nice change that we aren't getting ripped off like usual.
"Which OK, IONITY is like 35p/kWh or something. More or less diesel cost"
"Hmm interesting, it's 26p according to [Teslas website](https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/support/supercharging)"
They changed recently.
and petrol prices are also double US petrol prices so the value is still there over ICE cars.
"It's not as elegant as the Tesla plug that's true, but it's the open standard that all other cars are or will be using. Check out Plugshare and sort by CCS in the US."
"eh, still pretty expensive."
Surprisingly not terrible. Assuming you can find a supercharger. Which sadly you can't where i live.
"It’s 35p/kWh which $0.46 so that doesn’t that put UK at the top of the list?

We’ve (unfortunately) left the EU but we’re still here, in the world.. lol"
"Do they know enough to form an opinion? No

Will they form an opinion anyway? Yep"
"That’s the kind of candu attitude we need, soldier"
"We need to vote out Ford, but that’s my bias, living in Ontario. I think maybe NB might lean on dinojuice-related power? But I’m not certain"
"Terrestrial Energy is the leading modular nuclear company, they are currently targeting 2025 to have their first commercial reactor on line.

Terrestrial Energy was founded in Calgary Alberta, so you can stuff your anti-west attitude."
"Take a look at the solar farms being built in Alberta, they are massive"
"Ontario certainly is, and on wind too. But that’s our current premier’s fault, a lot of the rest of Canada is much more progressive with renewable energy

Edit: a word. Additionally, for the person who downvoted this, Doug Ford cancelled multiple contracts for wind farms that were close to completion, then paid to have them torn down. Quebec and BC are largely hydro powered, while Ontario still gets a good bit of our energy from gas. It would be hard to reasonably argue that Ford hasn’t held back renewable energy in the province"
"Hydro is pretty great, don’t get me wrong. It’s just that we do it a lot, and it isn’t free of side effects. It interrupts migratory paths, divides ecosystems, heats water downstream, and interrupts drainage and watersheds

We could stand to diversify into wind and solar, as we under-exploit these. I’m also a fan of nuclear as an intermediate measure until we figure out renewables with peakers. Nuclear would be sustainable a long while, and the new designs are safer than most electricity generation"
"Well, then they say average charge rate too. You can't pull 150kW for long, or even at all in some places still (120kW cap).

If I take 100kW as a very generous average over Tier 2 delivery,

    $0.44/min / 100kW * 60min/hr = $0.264/kWh

That's in CAD, so about USD$0.20/kWh.

Part of the problem is comparing per-minute rates to per-kWh rates. There's just too many variables to properly compare them in general, and you start needing to compare specific charge sessions.

Taking Tier 2 ideals is not very representative of most Supercharger sessions. Urban Superchargers will also make the equation far far worse. Use 72kW above instead of 100kW and see - it's CAD$0.40/kWh.

And yes, you can of course game the normal Superchargers to get a higher average power in Tier 2 thus making it ""cheaper"" per kWh delivered, but I think most people are Supercharging out of necessity (to whatever percentage they need) and not frugality."
"It's 9¢/kWh where I am in BC, but the equivalent rates at Superchargers vary from $0.25-$0.50/kWh depending how you hit them with the per-minute pricing. 

What are Superchargers rates there? (Actual price from charging history, not the website - it only gives a single number but each station has different pricing)"
"In theory, it should be on Canadian Model 3s with build dates prior to December 2019.

There has been some speculations that a class action lawsuit was filed in Montreal, that argued Tesla never mentioned any sort of trial or paid subscription for premium connectivity on their website until December 2019.

Tesla is just honoring it."
"Agreed, internet is relatively cheap and fast. I have 1 Gbit for ~70 CHF/month."
"The internet in germany is expensive and slow, in Italy its faster and less expensive which is surprising."
I have district heating. I live in a city where it is extremly favourable.
TELUS enters the chat...
With a government that knee-jerked out of atomic energy I think we've got a long while until things change. Same goes for paying 90€ per month for unlimited data plans when in the czech republic you get unlimited for like...20€.
"I mean they basically started the whole solar energy revolution. And that costs a lot of money. Early installations get some ridiculous high prices per kwh when they feed back into the grid.  
I knew people who didn't use it because it was cheaper to sell the energy and buy from the grid again."
"They've been roughly doubling every 2 years, so I'd expect similar growth for the foreseeable future unless any other big players step up on the charging infrastructure."
"The problem in Portugal is that for tesla to charge, they would have to open up the system for competition."
"I too am spoiled by getting to use hydro power.  built in the 60's with 60's labour.

It generates 13,000GWh and cost 750 million dollars.  (Inflation makes this equivalent to 5.4B dollars!) Thats the WAC Bennett  Dam.  We are currently constructing a new dam - still labeled site C.  For about double the money - 9B projected, it will produce less than half the power - 5,100 Gwh annually.

So even large hydro products have a big cost these days.  BC can borrow at around 4%, and with a 50 year mortgage its going to work out to $0.10/kwh for the build.  add operations, maintenance and delivery costs to that to get the real cost of power.

9B would have bought a lot of solar panels, especially if they just used it as a 30% rebate to homeowners footing the bill. But eventually that leads us back to the issue of batteries :)

(Solar $2/W installed. A watt creates 1,100wh/year. 9B/0.3=30B budget, =15BW installed, = 15GW installed (billion and giga are the same thing) = 16,500GWh for the same upfront cost!

Good luck getting a 50 year mortgage on a government program rather than a government asset - even if it has cost overruns and expensive annual budgets!

I like arm chair engineering.  I like that Musk helped make it accessible in his ted talk, speaking to breaking it down to the fundamentals."
"> When Tesla is competing against combustible engines, they really should make the cost per mile significantly lower. Using a charging station at that rate is barely below what a combustible engine delivers.

I think that's the point.  

They DO make the cost per mile significantly lower - IF you charge at home.  If you're supercharging all the time then you're really just going to be breaking even.  Plus you're wearing out your battery - if you supercharge all the time you'll probably hit the limit and be blocked from supercharging."
"Yep, we have one. So on a good average day with solar I don’t pull from the grid until 3am or so.

Having an EV makes it easy to justify that $16 fee (it is an EV plan after all)."
"If we choose the middle of the range he gave, and use $0.35/kwh, that would cost $24.50 to fill up a 70kw battery. The cost to do it at $0.09 is $6.40. 

So basically as long as they use the entire battery once a month the $16 plan makes sense."
"This is a small thing, but: Thanks for admitting you were wrong!"
"114kwhr at 0.09 will break even of $16/mo so at the third charge he should start seeing a saving. Not counting the home's night consumption which can be increased by setting dryer, washer, AC to work as much as possible at night."
"Yep.

SDGE, time of use plan.

Standard summer rates after the baseline are $.50 peak, $.30 off peak, and $.26 super off peak. It’s $.07 less in each tier for energy used under the baseline - so $.43, $.23, and $.19 respectively.

The EV plan is $0.50, $0.28, and $0.09"
"SDGE, EV-TOU5 plan. 12am-6am is 9 cents per kWh"
"Ga Power's plan is .20 during superpeak (June-September 2-7pm), .01 during super off peak which is 11pm-7am, and .07 all other times. It's a good deal if you can limit AC as much as possible during the hottest days."
"I get free charging at work too, but still tend to charge a bit on weekends and such at home.

Here with SDGE we were forced to use TOU plans, I miss the tiered plans."
That’s crazy. Even if your house is not connected to the grid?
"Well that’s your opinion and all. But I am going to do it, with black Jack and hookers."
[removed]
"That's true, because they decided to outsource their coal generation. 

Now the coal generation doesn't count against their generation numbers."

How does the government stealing extra money offset pollution? Do they do anything to vombat the problem or is it literally just charging people money to use polluting things as if the government is the planet's accounts payable for damages?
Dont they tax like age 20-30 a flat 60% or something rediculous?
I have no idea how renting in your country works but where I live (Austria) people have to pay rent+utility bills to their landlords so if electricity in the general areas of the house would rise the utility bills would rise too and would be forwarded to the tenant
You're still indirectly paying that cost.  It's just not itemized at your level.
I also never exaggerate. Ever. In my whole life not even once.
Shhhhhhh don't cramp my style!
Yes indeed. The fact is people from the EU will usually take the whole price while people from the US will only take the electricity price. I guess it's due to how prices are marketed in the US.
Diesel has been this cheap since at least December last year. And I honestly don't count on price increases until mid to late next year.
IONITY has cranked that up to 69p/kWh.
Ionity are expensive.
Depends on the location?
Maybe they've raised the price recently?
"Interesting, thanks"
"Double? Try again bud. In Texas we're paying ~€0.329 per liter. So I haven't checked prices, but last time it was ~4x."
Hardly. Driving diesel is actually cheaper than going with supercharger. Charging at home is very similar to the cost per km of diesel. You only save money with repair and service.
The US CCS isn't CCS though. It's a frankenstein thing. It doesn't support DC charging like the European ones.
"for the region and considering electricity pricing it's ok i guess. also, the SuC i use in Austria has a pretty neat lounge for EV drivers with very low cost snacks and hot beverages"
"England looks pretty electrified. Scotland looks Decent.  As does Ireland.  Its really only Wales that doesn't have any.

Or are they just always busy, California style?"
tesla.com gives me £0.24.
Mate I'm in BC. The amount of coal loving people that come to BC during slow times is insane. I work construction and I swear all they talk about is their oil and how everyone else is a hippie
"Just because you can build them doesn't make them a good idea. Canada get's a lot less solar, but it's no weirder than much of northern Europe building them. https://globalsolaratlas.info/

They need to be massive to get reasonable energy out of them in Canada. Canada could do with a lot more nuclear power and wind power. https://globalwindatlas.info/ Go put a bunch in Hudson Bay."
"If you think Ontario is fucked now, wait till our 2 big Nuclear generating stations need to be replaced. it's coming up soon."
Isn't most electricity in Ontario nuclear and they pay the most for power in all of Canada?
"100% agreed. I wasn't saying that their calculations were correct or representative of real-world costs, just trying to demonstrate how they arrived at that number."
After translating a few websites it seems that they were free as a campaign for a while and then went back to about 26¢ the kWh or 13¢ the minute. But they are supposed to change soon. Rather unclear I must admit.
Oh! I’m presently paying for premium connectivity after my first year’s preview (Oct 2018-2019). How does one move over to the free plan?
Hmm I was not paying for premium in Canada but it showed up on my car for free last week. This could explain it. I am Dec 2018 build
oh thats really great for those that got their 3s earlier
Yep. I have 10 Gbps for 50 CHF/month. Mobile data is also pretty competitive.
"Me 2 mate - I have one of the poor ones where we have to pay extra for a few more years as they bought back from malicious owner and sold to larger area municipal heating organisation before we got this house.

Still water to water or air to water is going to be cheaper over lifetime for a long time until our rather good remote heating setups change to real green sources and not greenwashed imported biomass."
"To be fair this is probably because of how Germany is set up to snoop for legal reasons. I had to give my passport, DL address of where I was staying and my grandma had to sign herself that I was indeed staying with her to get a Sim for 3 weeks. In Austria I walked in and out of a Deutsche Telekom in 10 mins and could have been anyone on the planet."
Any material I can read on this?  Interested to see what the plans are
I see no problem with this..
"The more accurate calculation would be what I would’ve between paid between 12am and 6am with the original TOU plan, which is $0.26 in the summer and $0.24 in the winter.

But same idea."
Sdge is absolutely brutal. I hate being on this utility.
"Yea, I'm on the same plan, still paying 2k a year to SDG&E, even with 7.5kw solar install.  The 50+ cents per Kwh really kills me when I have to run the AC durring peak hours.  And we bought our solar before the battery thing and SDG&E changed the rules (used to be 1kw in = one kw out).  Now the solar produces for pennies on the dollar."
"You really need to charge a lot as well. For anyone working from home now, the better plan is standard rate since home usage is constant and charging is low.

That's what I've found. I'm now charging once a week or even less depending on what comes up."
"I don't think so, but residential without power connection ist Not allowed in germany as far as I know."
"Don’t forget about the theme park!  

You know what - forget the theme park!"
"Yes, diesel at 5,5 liters/100km about 5,5€
Ev at 18kwh/100km ( including charge loss) ~6€ (0,30€/kwh)"
"https://www.bmwi-energiewende.de/EWD/Redaktion/EN/Newsletter/2019/07/Meldung/direkt-answers-infographic.html

Lots of other sources too.  USA and China are technically the largest VOLUME in renewable energy, but in terms of % of consumption Germany is tops.

edit:  Remember Siemens is a German company, who is pretty much the leader in Wind Energy technology (Germany's biggest green energy source is.... wind energy)."
"The money is used to subsidise solar deployments. The fee is not the problem. That most big industrial power users are exempt from that fee, is."
No.
Top tax rate is 42% if you earn more than 60k a year. VAT is 19%. Capital gains tax rate is 25%.
Not to me. Guess Im lucky. Landlords can decide themselves but luckily I dont get charged. And also that would be divided over 50 people so the increase in HOA fee would be minimal to nothing.
Landlords can decide what utilities to charge or not to charge. I have a few rental properties and I don’t charge for water or EV charging. Though EV charging is only at one unit.
"Haha, no."
We are at record low oil prices with slower demand so it makes sense now that it's lower. I was more speaking in general and averages.
There wiill be a gasoline and diesel tax increase next year in germany
I was more referring to the national averages of €0.49 in the US vs €1.24 in Germany.
"Unless you have solar at, home ;)"
US fuel prices are incredible
Diesel is definitely more cost efficient than petrol. I don’t think petrol is competitive with charger rates in Germany right now.
"That only works out when you drive a super efficient diesel car. That's not really a fair comparison to a Model 3. Also, had prices are lower than they have been in years right now. They'll go up again once Covid is over."
Yeah it supports DCFC. All the other EVs aside for leaf charge on CCS. I would be screwed on trips if it didn’t!
"I did the math for CZ and it should be under $.30
Sounds good, definitely better than to be stuck in the car while charging. I mean Austria is pretty damn nice so I wouldn't expect anything less"
"Ireland's not part of the UK. Northern Ireland is. And there's bugger all charging here.

In all of NI, zero tesla chargers here and only a few proprietary, many of which are in out of the way hotels or commercial properties and not necessarily where you'd want them (eg motorway service stations).

Plus after years of under-investment the grid here wont really support latest gen supercharging and most of the chargers are low kva.

If i cross the border into Ireland on my way to dublin, there's an applegreen motorway service station that has about 16 tesla chargers. Ireland seems to have a good charging infrastructure.

The saving grace is that NI's not that big (it's 85 miles (135 kilometers) north and south, and about 110 miles (175 kilometers) east and west) and even allowing for the road network not being straight lines you can pretty much drive across it and return twice on a single charge."
[deleted]
"I honestly haven’t followed relative prices, but yeah, we’re largely nuclear, followed by hydro, then gas, then renewables in change"
"Yeah I guess it's close... given a more ideal conversion rate day, it would round to the $0.17 they have.

And yet, the US numbers don't seem derived from that strategy, so I'm confused. Those US prices more closely match the per-kWh rates available in the US, I guess meaning they avoided the flawed method that used for Canada prices?"
"It should move you over automatically. It's possible your car already migrated over if you haven't checked it in a while.

Go to your Tesla account, and press MANAGE on your car. There should be some text that says Details, under Subscriptions, do you see  ""Premium Connectivity Free Unlimited""?

If so, wait a few days, your car just needs to sync up with Tesla's servers.

Additionally, when you check the Premium Connectivity section in the Software menu in your car, you should no longer see an option to renew the subscription, instead it'll just say ""Included package""."
"10 Gbps? That’s pretty nuts.

That’s definitely a waste and completely overkill but im jealous."
"No, it is because the government drives the price of the usage rights for wireless frequencies up immensely. The last auction of the 791-862 MHz band netted the government more than 3.5 billion euros. Carriers pass this cost to customers. Mobile internet in Germany is so expensive because the German government wants more money.  

The anti-privacy and censorship issues are an entirely different topic."
"https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/findus

is a map interface of chargers, including coming soon ones."
"The problems are:

1. Most competing cars cannot charge quickly on Tesla superchargers, either due to lacking DC fast charging or needing to step up voltage. The only car that can properly supercharge on a Tesla supercharger is the wonderbox-enabled Lucid which doesn't exist yet. This would create long queues since competitor cars would need to charge 2-6x as long, or require entirely separate chargers for these vehicles.
2. No POS infrastructure exists for superchargers, since it just bills to the account linked to your VIN communicated through proprietary tech. This adds additional cost infrastructure, since with their current model they have little to no chargeback and fraud concerns but with an open network, this infrastructure is needed. And that costs money.
3. The entire network only exists as a value addition to Tesla, as they lose money on the supercharger business in isolation. By selling electricity at such low margins it will never pay for the land and construction. Opening it to competition makes it worse for Tesla owners, by lengthening queues, while also eliminating it as an advantage.

So for Tesla to open the doors to other brands, they need some way to offset the disadvantages as not to be hemereging money since, despite having a green goal behind their business, they are not a charity. This may mean raising prices, getting government incentives, or being compensated by the competitors."
"We have one Powerwall, I’m not sure how much it’s actually saved us.

We have a 8.2 kW solar system, and run the AC throughout the day. Covers all of our electrical useage typically, we don’t pull from the grid until like 3am if we had a good sunny day."
"Yeah probably right for most people who work from home, especially in summer. But if you work out of the house during the summer and get home around 5-6 you could actually save a lot. 

Personally we'll probably break even depending on how this summer goes. We do drive about 40-60 miles a day  so we're using around 10-15 kwh each night."
"Is there a grid connection fee on top of that? 

My local power company (in Canada) doesn't charge per kWh for your own solar, but they do charge a flat connection fee per month, and having a grid connection is mandatory if you're inside their service area. I'd imagine that the fees work out to about the same amount either way."
It is allowed but then you need to register it. A Neighbor is using the electricity and is heating his pool with the rest of the energy. He isn’t connected with the grid but it is registered.
"they have a great percentage of renewable, but in terms of CO2 emission, they could do much better, because they still burn a considerable amount of lignite (brown coal -- about 20% of the total production)\[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity\_sector\_in\_Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Germany)\]"
"Ah, the solar thing makes sense. The whole exempting the root of problem from paying for the solution is uh, a tad fucked."
"The only devils advocate explanation i can come up with is that the companies that are exempt operate on too thin of margains due to existing taxes to be able to stay afloat if they had to pay another tax. But idk if thats true. I do know that a lot of industry in germany is autos and car companies have notoriously low profit margains . If they couldnt operate with the tax well enough to be competetive, the jobs that pay the tax would also dissappear, making the incom for solar tax even lower.


Idk, but thats the best argument for it i can come up with besides the companies just have better lawyers and fucked over the public as a result"
"But, i want to hate the commies. Please validate my reason my reason tp hate the commies /s"
Nothing is free. They probably know the rough amount it costs and have that included in the overall fee. And if you use a lot the utilities they'll make less profit.
You don't think the owner is paying a fee towards the HOA and that cost is passed along as part of the rent?
Oh I haven't heard about that
Woah national averages even here are higher than I thought...
"National averages aren't very useful because there's widely varying prices in the US. The US federal gas tax is only 18.4 cents/gallon (€0.041/liter) and states vary widely on how much they tax gas, if at all."
and had it installed this year instead of in the 80's
In the Netherlands it isn't worth installing panels anymore. They're changing the rules on selling energy back to the energy company itself so within 5 years from now on it's deginetly not worth it anymore.
"still not worth it, the cost to install solar is too high it takes easily a decade to break even.

Also if you install solar in Germany you get a guaranteed price for many years but only if you sell the power not when you consume it by yourself.

and obviously installing solar means you have to own a house which is not the norm as well."
"people say that all the time and while it may be true that the prices are going to increase a bit the gas prices in general have not increased a ton over the last 10 years.

meanwhile my electricity price is 50% higher than it was 10 years ago."
never been to CZ for charging so i cannot say anything about SuC there.
"I apologies for being dumb. And sounding dumb. I am pretty far away and international sports took a pretty hard break this year.

hows the one in lisburn coming along?

and sorry - i didn't even notice the NI didn't have anything. I blame the service centre near Belfast and the Supercharger(s?) in Dendalk

Wild that more people in NI didn't vote in the brexit referendum.  I feel like that region has more change on the table than most."
"Which one? 

Bruce has 2 of 6 reactors online (2012). the remaining 4 are being worked on now. 

Darlington Refurb is expected to finish in 2026

Pickering will retire 2/6 in 2022 and the remaining 4 in 2024, leaving us with a 3100MW deficit."
"I think all of Canada charges per-minute, while most of the US charges per kW. They probably either averaged all values, or they just skipped all the per-minute US rates entirely."
"My options jumped from standard at 50 Mbps to fiber at 10 Gbps. It’s overkill for residential, but it wasn’t much more than standard so I don’t mind. It pays dividends when opening up an old program or game that decides it needs to auto-update first."
Perfect! Thanks so much
I thought competition on who supplies the electricity... Not which cars are permitted to charge..
"   Our whole house is electric, so dryer, water heater, stove, and oven.  It adds up really quick.  I think the house was built in the 60's and they thought they were going to get cheap San Onofre power or something."
"even if it is not required by law, you don't have much chance going off-grid in Germany (and probably Canada as well). Your highest usage, unlike California, tends to be in winter, since you use more light, maybe even electric heating, you stay at home more etc. But solar in winter is dead in most of the Europe. In here (Slovakia), it is like 10% of summer. So you would need about 13 times more solar panels for winter than for summer to really go off-grid"
Thanks for that. I want to go off grid in Spain. There are many very remote homes that would be great for it.
"How can I make this clearer, I dont pay more even my rent went down by 10% year over year.. thanks for explaining to me how I pay more when I dont. Lol"
"I think your comment makes about as much sense as the shops which have a sign telling people to not shoplift because they will have to raise prices.

You really haven't thought this through."
"Likewise, I didn't realize just how much Texas prices benefited from the proximity to the oil fields. In California, the gas tax is $0.42 higher per gallon, but the average gas price is currently $3.19 per gallon vs $1.85 in Texas, a $1.34 increase.    
California itself produces as much oil as Alaska, but I guess even that isn't enough for the largest car and largest truck markets in the US."
False. Please don't spread dogma. It is very geographic based. In Texas it's 4-6 years
"Fossil fuels have never been priced fairly, if you take the externalities (i.e.environmental damage) into account. In Germany we still burn a lot of lignite coal (Braunkohle) for electricity, which is absolutely inexcusable. We have a long way to go before we even begin to really address climate change. But you have to start somewhere."
"Right, just checked and the official price is 0.36 USD per kWh"
"Nice research. Impressed. But no-ones dumb for not knowing much about NI. We're a tiny little place that's only famous because we've been trying to kill each other for so long. And we have hexagonal rocks. Oh, and game of thrones.

You should come though. Now we've largrly laid off the killing and blowing people up, it's actully really picturesque and we're really friendly to visitors (if not always to each other). And you haven't lived until you've had an Ulster fry, Irish stew or a full soda. Plus Northern Irish Tayto rock. Not like crappy Irish Tayto."

"Gonna be honest, at 10 Gbps you're likely being bottlenecked by your storage or CPU so you could still not be hitting your potential (unless you have a recent CPU and NVMe with PCIe 4.0).

Also, out of curiosity, did they provision you with a switch so you could hardwire your computer's 10 Gb ethernet port? Not a lot of afforable 10 Gb-capable consumer switches out there. I'm assuming they wrapped the cost of one into your contract somehow? Or did you have to pay for it up front.

I also am not aware of many consumer-PC motherboards with 10 Gb ports built-in - I've seen some 2's and 5's. Did they give you a 10Gb PCIe card or did you also have to buy that separate?"
"How is that supposed to work? Don't electricity utility companies have a monopoly in their specific areas of operation? For example where I live (Phoenix, AZ, US) we have a few utility companies that serve the city but your home will only be able to use one of them."
That's where wind comes in.
People who want to completely replace thermal power plants with solar don't seem to take this into account. Until massive scale grid batteries are available solar is gimped.
"Yep, but I would check local law. We got some EU Standards but these things depend on local decisions."
Why do your facts out weigh their theories?
We found the guy that thinks free shipping exists!
"My comment is from the experience of having rental properties in the past.  Whomever is the ""owner"" is still paying the HOA fee.  That fee is considered in determining the cost of the rent.  When costs go up, so does the rent next time it's time to renew a contract."
"Alot has to do w added taxes in states like CA. 

Fun Fact: Texas is one of the leaders behind CA in solar and wind energy.  And world's largest BEV company moving there."
So you're not quite correct. In California the gas tax is actually $0.505 but there's significant local taxes on gas and other types of taxes as well. It goes out to around $0.70 per gallon in taxes in California for gasoline (Diesel has even more).
this comment chain is about Germany and here it is not true
"Sounds delightful.  I definitely enjoyed my fries in Brussels, and I had a friend who made a mean irish stew (with american guiness - so he was never as satisfied as we were)

This map is 'my research' and I like it a lot:  
https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/findus"
All those refurbs cost money that will be passed to the consumer.
"It’s definitely bottlenecked somewhere around 6-7 Gbps, but I don’t really care about that speed since I would have been more than happy with 1 Gbps. I do have a 10 Gb card installed in my PC and an external [combo box](https://fiber.salt.ch/de/fiber/equipment/fiber-box) that includes a 10 Gb Ethernet port, 2.2 Gb WiFi, TV channels, and Apple TV. I’m more than capable of installing my own switch, but I decided to rent the combo box instead primarily for the included TV service. The box is 39 CHF per month so overall I pay about 90 CHF per month for symmetrical 10 Gbps plus some side benefits."
"wind is strongest in february-march, november-january is still weak. And it is just 2x more in winter than in summer, so you would need like 80% of generation in wind and only 20% solar to somehow balance it out  
edit: even worse if you would like to heat ecologically. Then, since you need more energy in winter than in summer, you need to get close to 100% wind"
normal batteries won’t be enough. you won’t be able to store half a year of electricity in batteries. You have to produce something which you can later change back to electricity - something that you can store at scale
"Nobody wants that though, the solution that makes the most sense is a combination of the renewable energy sources, solar, wind, and water, as well as large scale battery grids. We're probably a couple years away from them, if people weren't so brainwashed by companies that have their money in oil"
They be jelly
"he doesn't think it's free. He is saying that basically other are paying for him, probably not even knowing about it."
"So the owner of the unit is chipping in $1 for $100 worth of electricity and you consider that ""paying for it?""

Wow, I'm sure that tenant feels sorry now for all that charging.

As I said, you really haven't thought this through. I really hope you are never put in charge of your HOA."
You’re welcome.
"That's what I was including. I recently located the [American Petroleum Institute's state tax list](https://www.api.org/~/media/Files/Statistics/State-Motor-Fuel-Notes-Summary-July-2020.pdf) which includes everything from sales tax to wholesalers' tax. The total tax on a gallon of gas in California is $0.8087 and in Texas it's $0.3840 per gallon. The taxes don't make up for the price difference and California has had higher gas prices for decades so it's not cap and trade's fault either. It has to be some other hidden factors driving it up and my suspicion is that most of it's the insanely high demand.    
    
Btw, I have no personal stake in this conversation (I no longer live in the US), but it has been covered here in this sub that Elon's announcement to ""move"" Tesla's HQ is more of just building a new location with no plans to fully move engineering, development, or other HQ functions from California."
"See my other comment for the explanation and link to the American Petroleum Institute source. The figure is $0.80 tax per gallon which includes everything from a underground storage tax to sales tax. In Texas it’s $0.38 per gallon, hence the $0.42 difference. Yes, certain California localities impose local sales tax, but so do some Texas localities so it’s kind of a wash in that department."
Pumped water is about the only thing I can think of until we can get extremely long-range lossless power transmission going.
"You're still a renter, not building equity (long term returns) in the home you live in. I used to be a renter for many years - so not jelly."
Bingo and they know. Just fyi.
One of the primary contributors is that California requires a special blend of gasoline that's more expensive that's not used in any other state.
High demand sure. But also real estate... Prime real estate here is pennies compared to most of california.
"lossless, yes. But if you have two options: either overbuild solar, to have enough for winter, but waste 90% of electricity in summer (because you produce too much), or store non-efficiently excess summer energy for winter (in hydrogen, methane or any other substance that can easily be converted back to energy), even 50% efficiency seems good."
"if it is split among 50 people and they don't break it down per apartment, they might not notice. If one person has higher bill by $100, he will notice. If 50 people have higher bill by $2, they won't"
"Thank you. I knew it has to be something. Do you know of Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Washington have something similar going on? They have lower taxes, but they also have disproportionately high gas prices."
"Sorry, I live in California so I only know about here."
Wow nice. Wonder if these are similar enough dimensions (thickness) that these can be retrofit?
I'm so jealous! I wish my 3 was a bit quieter.
Front glass only
"Noise is my biggest issue with my 3. Good to see this coming to future owners of both cars, including me whenever the 7 seat Y becomes available"
wow look how thick those suckers are. i wonder how big a difference those make?
Guys. Stop calling these double pane windows. It’s laminated glass. Double pane is a different thing...
Acoustically laminated. Not double pane.
How's noise level? I've noticed I can hear the tires of other cars pretty readily just sitting idle in my 3. I can't tell if it's the side windows or the windshield though.
Believe this is in the new Model 3 as well. Good stuff.
"That's my biggest complaint about model X - too loud compared to other vehicles of similar price (it's a small complaint, car is awesome)."
Still got the old center console?
[deleted]
"LOL just took delivery yesterday. 61997. 

Missed it by *that* much"
"2020 performance Y here, dynomat is your friend. I’m a car enthusiast and rattle hunter. Couldn’t deal with all the rattles so I removed the door panels, ripped apart the dash and shoved foam/applied dynomat everywhere. It’s literally dead silent now."
How is the rear bumper color matching wise? I saw that the shade can still be off even with VINs in the 50K range.
Has Franz tested these?
"lol, almost looks like bulletproof windows!"
Thanks for reposting my picture with no credit
Maybe make a picture of the wheel wells maybe it’s more clothy and more dammed
My 60xxx vin :(
lets go!! this is a great tid bit to new buyers
Wow interesting. I did not expect it to literally look like two panes stuck together.  Hope they beefed up the window regulator a bit.  We need someone to test how quieter this is.
I hope the window motor is stronger too. I've had double pane swapped into a car before... The motors struggled hard.
Goes to show you how poor I am... I didn’t even know this was a thing
I can’t seem to understand what’s going on with your shoe
Has this one got the HEPA filter and BWDM aswell?
Thicc boi glass
"We’ve had one pane already yes, but what about *second* pane?"
Triple pane windows for the Cybertruck!!!
"Sweet! Waiting on my delivery, hopefully I get this too!"
Is it quiet?
Does this improve cabin heating and cooling efficientcy?
Laminated! Not double pane. Shame on whoever use the wrong terminology and now everybody is.
Laminated glass*
Can glass be laminated by third party/aftermarket?
[deleted]
"For someone who doesn't have the VINs memorized, what month/year was this built?"
Why in the world would they need double pained windows?
I would take the alon glass over the double pane any day.
Added weight hmm... checks Model S windows... well isn’t going to work unless they plug the black triangle seals up too
Damn. Bet I won't get this in the 61xxx I pick up tomorrow...
"WTF? This is a thing? I didn't know anyone made double panel windows that rolled down.

My Y has developed a lot of wind noise on the driver's side that was not there before."
Sweeeet. Delivery scheduled in a week and a half and my VIN is in the upper 63K. Excited I didn't miss out on this.
Yeesss great news for Road /wind noise and heat!
"Ooooo I think this same batch is coming my way next week!

Any issues?"
What's the benefit of the double pane windows?
I potentially take deliver on a 65K VIN MY in two weeks. I’m interested to see this in person.
Damn! 60k and delivery is next week 🤷🏻‍♂️
That Prius in the back looks jelly
"Damn, the window sealing and wind noise is really my only complaint about my Model Y. I do have an appointment for November sometimes, maybe they can retrofit"
try smashing those bullet proof cyber truck balls
Throw a metal ball at it
I hope someone who picked up a new Model X can tell us if they have it too.
"The problem with laminated glass is that it won't shatter so the glass breaker tools for rollovers won't work.

Example:

https://youtu.be/aAsUG-jbLlM?t=125"
Looks bullet proof lol
"Won't this affect the weight quite a bit?

Glass is some heavy shit normally, and if all windows are changed I see some range being reduced."
"I'm so glad my current lease isn't up until next year. Seems like Tesla is updating something new every week. Last week it was the range bumped up by 10%, this week is thicker glass. What's next? 

Also =, anyone know when they're going to start using the new battery packs? I'd really love to have a 400+Mile range Performance Y"
Elon doesn't wanna look stupid again on stage lol
"Great news for Canada, and therefor the world."
Do you think this applies to the roof as well?
I would be real bummed if i bought a model y and just missed out on this...

What if I put it in a large body of water and try to break the glass
what is your vehicle weight?  curious if it changed.  double pane windows are heavy.
I hate the wind noise in my early 38xx Y.
Soon enough we won't know the difference between a new feature quietly rolled out and a manufacturing defect.
🙌
"I’ve got a September 2020 Model 3 LR and it is a little noisier than I would like, especially at 70mph+

I had the etron for a week a while back and that was quieter. Does anyone know what the Ipace is like noise wise?"
Put the best tires on you can afford.  I run cooper discoverer off road tires on my truck and you can barely hear them ....because they are properly engineered.
They are realizing most people sleep in their Teslas
Double laminate or is there and air gap?
"Is this for noise, heat, both, or something else?"
Soo is the road noise eliminated?
"I bet that helps with the noise, but I bet that's going to be a pretty penny to replace if it's ever broken."
"Oh damn, tesla is finally into mercedes s class realm of 30yrs ago."
"I feel like this might have something to do with the news story on model y's rear window shattering, not sure though."
Noise cancelling headphones
"Probably better for window breaking safety, but I wonder if it’s still safe for intentionally breaking a window to free yourself from the car?"
So how bad is your cell reception inside the car?
"Uhm, why?"
*Accidentally shatters window and. Calls insurance
It looks pretty thick so there are likely some other changes needed  even if it’s just trim. I’m just going to hold out for enough changes that it’s worth the trade in
Would be nice but doubt it.
i really hope so. My X has terrible wind noise. Double pane windows would make a HUGE difference m
Highly doubt it
I added the extra door seals and trunk liner. Much quieter now.
Try these methods. I suggested putting a foam upwards behind the front fender right below the A pillar wind is traveling up into the cabin. I cut much of the cabin noise at high speeds doing this. Try it out!: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/solved-wind-noise.177619/
"the windows are only one area where the sound dampening needs to happen.

hopefully they have also added a ton more dampening in the doors and used thicker carpet in the car."
A bit? I wish it could be as quiet as a Corolla which is a lot quieter.
Just turn the music up!
I can’t hear shit over my music playing.
I don’t. I already hear enough rattles and the road noise drown them out a little.
Do you mean this is only for the front driver and passenger doors?
"Yes, now they just need the quiet glass in between the front and rear seats and so I can listen to my music in peace. /s"
Lol it is all perspective I guess. My 3 seems incredibly quiet but I have loud cars I guess.
What year is your 3? We got a 2020 in March and it seems quiet enough to me. I mean of course I hear the road and other outside noises more clearly but I figured that’s due simply to not having an engine and transmission rumbling.
Are you me? Same exact situation. I hear December! I want that heated steering wheel though too!
Is it road noise or what kinda noise is it?
Yup let’s put our kids in the cramped crumple zone in those extra seats. Sounds like solid plan lol
Road noise is more of a problem than wind noise at least in my P3D anyway.
It adds crash safety too.
I want to throw a big ball bearing at one like the cyber truck announcement.
By the photo it looks to me like it's just 2 normal pieces of driver side window glass put together. I think I even see the convex tops on each. Is this how most laminated glass windows look?
"What are you, the window police?"
"Do any cars actually have that?

Would be funny if they had separate window controls for each pane. You know, first lower one pane, then the other."
"I've wondered why so many places refer to this as ""double pane""... it's not at all what I expected the first time I heard that term applied to a car."
"Hey, owner of that car and shoe here, it's hard to say because this is my first/only tesla. I'd be happy to do a comparison with another owner in the Denver metro."
"Yes, Model Y did not receive the updated console."
Nah ppl been saying the noise is an issue at high speeds
Lol same. It's funny because I also said the trunk and piano glass were signs that Tesla would have to start adding amenitites and real attention to detail to compete and got shouted at .....and here we are
Those fuckers must’ve been driving shit cars if they think the model 3 and model y are “whisper quiet”. That and they need to learn how to use hyperboles too.
Wonder what the people taking delivery today are just missing? Maybe lower weight and longer range because of the front casting. Or air suspension. It's always something. I just missed the tow bar on my Model 3.
"625XX here...not sure if I will get it, will find out next week."
Return it
"He said 63k, not 62k, so not as close as you think."
[deleted]
Like you also took apart that leather area of the dash? Or just the wood trim?
I’ve got a 58k VIN white Y and the bumper seems identical to the body color
Getting color to match on plastic and metal is difficult. Most of the cars I've owned had different shade on the rear and front bumper than the rest.
"Like my Hilux?

https://imgur.com/a/C0ZCJbR"
"Hey!

I actually did [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/jgv219/model_ys_are_starting_to_come_with_double_pane/), but was then asked to remove it.  Might have been due to mentioning the subreddit it came from?  

My apologies regarding that.  I tried to."
"owner of that car here, took a brief look at the wheel wells and they look similar to other Ys i've seen on reddit and youtube"
Are you sad because you don't think you'll get it because yours is a 60k and not a 63k? Have you already received your model Y and you don't have it? I haven't gotten my VIN yet so I'm kind of hoping that I'll have to double pane.
Old creased leather at a weird lighting angle
CHONKY
"Shatterproof!

YMMV"
"Owner of that vehicle and shoes here, yes, it is very quiet. I only have this car though so I don't know how it compares to other Teslas"
"Is it warm at -30c?

Actually that might be an issue for melting ice off the window..."
"The 3 is atrocious. As soon as you get above 50 it's noticeable and then if you have a cross breeze I sweat you can hear the wind funneling into the cabin. 

This glass might help but I find it odd that so many other cars have frameless windows but don't have this problem."
my max range is 324 instead of 326. Doesn't seem to make a huge difference. Source: own the car in the OP
Would love to know. Can you update this thread either way?
Did yours have it?  I'm supposed to take delivery on MY Friday and it only has a 60XXX VIN
"In this case, a quieter cabin."
"This is only the front two, range doesn't seem impacted"
"Then you drown

Edit: but actually....my understanding is the laminate is only on the front so you can still break the back. Also the emergency release has stated there's a chance to shatter the window, I'm assuming there's something in there to deal with this as well."
"Shit is horrible. And of course, the SC technicians like to pull out the “within spec” bullshit."
No air gap between the two sheets of glass
Probably heat. Can't imagine noticeable reduction in noise.
Lol more like kia of 20 years ago
What would the two have to do with each other?
Lmao a guy came on here and said he wore noise cancelling headphones while driving and he got downvoted to kingdom come
"No.  But the number of trapped in the car accidents is way lower than injuries from ejection and intrusion that the glass will protect you from.  If windows were impenetrable, deaths and injuries would go down.  Some would people will die differently though."
Soundproof
*Oopsie*
"Hi, it's me, ur insurance agent..."
"Former insurance fraud investigator here and still in the industry. Please don't do this. You will get caught, you're not the first to think of this."
"I mean, I did max out my glass insurance coverage soooo"
"maybe they accidentally got the ""Foreign Despot Bulletproof"" Model Y."
"It's already a fantastic vehicle. Incremental improves won't help much. Start living the dream and get it NOW! Also if you plan to get FSD, that will continue to get more expensive."
Got a link to the product you used?
I did the same and it made no difference. The dash is a rattley piece of shit no matter what it seems.
"I added door seals but the main problem is the top of the window seal.  It’s right by my ear, and the wind noise there is pretty bad.  I haven’t found a solution for it yet"
Now I'm wondering what it would take to hermetically seal it.
Any idea if the door seals where more helpful with road noise or was it the trunk liner? Also did the trunk liner affect that bass?
"Interesting, I'm going to give this a try. Thanks!"
Why shower when you can just slap on extra deodorant!?
Yes front left and right.
"Yeah, why are Tela not keeping my kids quiet by now??"
You need [Homer Simpson’s car](https://laughingsquid.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/homer2.jpg).
"Soooooon cash cab?

Or the other ""taxi"""
I use AirPod pro’s in my P3D.  Too noisy on concrete interstate for music to be enjoyable with the sound system.
"March 2019. On highways in steady speed it's not the engine for gasoline cars, it's the wheels and the wind. Not a biggie for me, but the only thing I don't like about the 3. Think the iterations since have put more isolation in, so a year after might be better.

Aaand I'm writing this from Norway, having more rugged roads to tackle the snow season"
"No model S and 3 is pretty noisy. I have been in an etron and it's dead silent. Especially at high speed.
You can be driving 150 km/h and won't notice it. Model S is real noisy at that point. Or at least it was on 2018."
March 2020 Model 3 here as well and I get pretty bad wind noise. Far more than I’m used to on any past cars I’ve owned. Seems to primarily come from the front corners. Can’t tell if it’s the door or windshield area?
"It will make more noise in a year or two.

Unfortunately we have a lot of creaking and rattling that we’re not there in the first 6 months or so."
It’s tires and wind
"Yeah. Car itself is of course quiet. But above, say, 40 mph, the noise is worse than my old gasoline car.

Again, I love the 3, this my only minus"
"On the Y, it's wind noise, there are aftermarket products that help.  One is simply a rubber seal you put on the roof under the glass, it makes a surprising difference, I'm shocked Tesla didn't do more to reduce.  It's not so bad you can't drive or something but when you consider it's a $60k vehicle, you wouldn't accept that from any other manufacturer."
People don’t realize it’s road noise not car noise
There’s a reason industry called it NVH!
"Maybe at low speed but anything over like 40mph and I start hearing the whooshing, especially where the top of the window seals."
Disagree.   Take your side mirrors off and go 80mph.  You'll blow your mind how much quieter it is.
Would this not help with both though?
"How much of it is that you don't have the ambient noise of the engine, transmission, and exhaust?  No matter how quiet those three are, they will put out some sound and vibration that you're going to pick up on."
Mine too
"road noise is the main factor for basically everyone who is not in Germany as you will never reach speeds where wind becomes a huge problem overall.

And even in Germany you will probably never have wind noise problems because driving fast cuts the range down so much that its not really worth it."

What are YOU? The window internal affairs?
Double pane also refers to windows that have an air gap (typically filled with argon) for noise/thermal insulation.

Have you been on any bad roads at high speeds? Denver roads are pretty high quality. I rented a Dodge Challenger out there once and it rode like a luxury car on those great highways.
"Tesla build is trash still that’s why. We’re paying for the tech, not quality."
"Just wait. The seals on the triangles in front of the window may come worn and let in more noise than the double pane windows can keep out.

Did not. Great build though.

Porsche has upgrades for this type of glass throughout the car and it is for both noise and heat.  It makes a noticeable difference.
"No, it's for noise. It's acoustic laminated glass windows. Honda does the same thing for the Ridgeline with their windshield and marketed it heavily as significantly reducing the sound in the cabin. It's very common on high end luxury cars in particular.

There may be a small side benefit of added insulation but I wouldn't expect much. The primary purpose is certainly noise reduction."
"Idk just a guess, I'm most likely wrong"
"Then it’s not worth the compromise. The family who loses a loved one from not being able to escape will have wished this never happened. Tesla usually doesn’t compromise like that, because safety is number one priority.

The likelihood of getting struck by lightning is low, but you don’t walk into a lightning storm wearing steel-toed boots."

"Former sarcasm investigator here and still in the industry. Please don't do this. You will woooosh, you're not the first to woooosh."
How can they figure out if you broke the glass vs someone being malicious ? Honest question
"How would you know? You're biased by only knowing of the idiots who don't fool you. For all you know 10 people get away with it for every one you catch.

And how on earth do you think you can tell if a window was broken by the customs or by someone else? You can't."

"Yep. White noise from wind and tires is not a problem for my ears and brain.  
But i hate rattles.  
And only single rattle in my model 3 is from the dash between the windshield and the driver A pillar.  
the weird thing is that there is no rattle when the car is hot inside , but it starts again when is cold."
Have you done a window calibration? Sometimes this will help a lot.
Trunk liner for sure. That rumble from the trunk and the overly fat bass are fixed by it.
That's what I say every other morning 😂
That’s what the creators of Axe were planning. I’m convinced of it
Wow...that’s disappointing
"Foam in the tires seems to really cut down the noise, wonder if the same could work for kids..."
"_Computer, deploy sleep power_"
maybe you should turn on the rear seat heaters from the front until they quiet down.
This is why they have OTA updates. Other automakers couldn't do this.
Dane here. Norway roads I can totally relate to the M3 noise problem. I was shocked how much noise our M3 had once entering Norway.
The etron is nuts how quiet it is.
"I drove a 2019 Leaf SL Plus and it was so quiet.  Concrete highway,  80 mph and you could hear a pin drop in the cargo boot."
"The wheels and tires are also a big factor. Model 3 model with 20"" rims and sport tires will be louder than the one with the 18"" wheels and regular tires."
"Model S is about the 10th or 15th quietest car you can buy. 

Should be better though."
"Same month and year build, I get that gush of wind at highway speeds seeping in through the windshield and front window ends. One of my main complaints about the car."
Ah well. We are on a three year lease so I guess that works out for us. But hopefully they’ll resolve these issues going forward.
"Yup, it’s kind of nuts how big a difference even tires can make to road noise"
I think they do now that electric cars are getting more common. They see/hear that it's not the quiet car that people think it would be. You can hear one coming just like an ICE car.
"Not really, the road noise comes up through the suspension. Tesla has done some work on that too adding sound deadening in the wheel arches too I believe."
"Clearly you’ve never ridden in an actual luxury car, and then compared that to the Model 3 (or even Model S). Seriously, they’re both terrible for cabin noise. 

My Model 3 is absolutely deafening at highway speeds compared to a 2004 BMW X5. At highway speeds, you can’t hear the engine or the exhaust. All you hear is the buffeting wind noises and road noises from the rubber on pavement. 

The all glass roof does not help this. My X5 had a front to back moonroof that had a fabric cover. And this is a proper luxury car with thick windows, tons of sound deadening foam and it was STILL extremely noisy with the cover open. Glass is an extremely poor insulator for noise. 

Teslas are extremely expensive drivetrains and electronics encased average to below average bodies. And I’m fine with that - If I could go back in time I’d still buy them. I just don’t appreciate when people stretch the truth due to fanboyism like “oh there’s no engine so you can hear wind louder” 

Hell, my 2012 Leaf with a hilariously degraded battery is about the same in terms of noise levels at highway speeds than my Model 3. And I have supposedly the “revised” model with the better NVH (although I do not have double pane glass)."
"Yep, it does mean other noises are more obvious than they are in a fossil car. The issue with the stock model 3 was that these noises had an irritating range of frequencies. The seals and deadening I’ve put in doesn’t reduce the sound all that much but it changes the tone so it isn’t so prominent. I could probably put some more sound proofing under the carpet and in the wheel arches but for now it’s quiet enough and I would just be adding weight."
"I would say almost zero. Most competing luxury cars comes with 8+ speed transmissions these days, so they’re running pretty quiet at freeway speed. My 2015 Acura could cruise at like 1500rpm, and it was MUCH quieter than my 3 overall. 

It’s all road noise, the engine is a non issue."
So there are two panes of glass right?
"Nothing, the lighting is weird so a tiny crease in the leather looks enormous in the pic"

What’s even more insulting is that they don’t show us the spec. They could be lying for all we know.
"> The likelihood of getting struck by lightning is low, but you don’t walk into a lightning storm wearing steel-toed boots.

That analogy is incomplete - you would walk in a lightning storm in steel toed boots, if you were walking through an area where heavy objects randomly fell on your feet with no warning, with a probability of incident > p(struck by lightning).

Relatedly, the similarly fallacious 'trapped inside the vehicle' argument has been used against seatbelts since their inception, but lives saved by seatbelts>>>>>>>>>>>>lives ""cost"" by seatbelts. As the person above said - if the risk of injury due to weak glass is greater than the risk of injury due to strong glass, then it makes sense to strengthen the glass.

Anyone who is truly worried can buy a window breaking tool and fix it securely in the car within reach of the driver. All sensible drivers should do this as a precaution anyway, but the tiny number who actually do, tells you all you need to know about how the relative risk is perceived."
Buy a window breaking tool.  Do you not wear seatbelts as well?

"The trunk sound deadening kit is a gimmick. You can't hear anything from the trunk area while in the driver seat. Installed it and noticed zero difference.

&#x200B;

The door seal kits however do help in wind noise reduction. Not drastic but you do notice it's a little more quiet .

&#x200B;

Also the roof noise reduction strip is also useless."
Does that trunk deadoning foam actually work? I've never thought about that.
Tried buying it but it only ships to New Zealand
Damn actually that’s really quite impressive.
"Yes I have this temperature related rattle too, only mine comes on when the dash itself is hot."
Not a tesla but I have the same issue in my car. Makes it a bastard to track down and fix the rattle.
I have the exact same problem. Have you come across a solution? I have even taken the vents out to see inside the dash...
"A lot of my rattle from the dash that seems like it's coming from the A pillar speaker grill, turns out its coming from the steering column's plastic covers. Unscrew it just enough to sneak in some cloth tape solved 75% of it."
How do you do that?
I'm not sure I can hear/identify the trunk rumble. It's the wind noise on the highway that I hate. Do you think one item or the other helped specifically with wind noise?
"Wait, you guys have showered since the pandemic started?"
Totally normal for auto glass. I’ve never seen laminated glass in rear doors
"Not really.   Most of the noise in a car is from the side view mirrors, right next to you anyway.  Removed the mirrors on my old car and was AMAZED how much quieter it was on the freeway."

"I'm kinda jelly. I wish Tesla weren't as OTT on extracting the last mile of range and worked on sound insulation.

Maybe there are some decent third parties who specialize on this sort of thing and can insulate the car for a fee."
Why were you riding in the cargo boot? Kidnapped?
Absolutely. I switched from the OEM goodyear touring tires to the Continental PureContact LS touring tires and it was a night and day difference. The Contis are insanely quiet.
"At 0-30mph, sure.  

Tesla has a huge advantage by virtue of being electric, but unfortunately that means they’re really terribly soundproofed."
You guys should try the foam up the front fender under A pillar method i used and suggested to others in Tesla Motors xlub forum. Other ones help too. Here: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/solved-wind-noise.177619/
"They may have in a 2020 model I guess. I forget mine is old now.

Cheers on the lease! Have fun with the brand new car in a few years."
Would the rumored air suspension improve this?
"I can appreciate this take. I think that a lot of people are coming from a non-luxury car to their tesla, so from that perspective, it very will might seem ""whisper quiet"". I used to drive a 2001 Honda Accord, and I can tell you that going from that to a 2020 model 3 is a lot quieter. I doubt I would have the same perspective coming from a BMW or an Audi. I really don't think that the model 3 really even qualifies as a luxury car. I have not been particularly impressed with the car body or interior, but I would buy it again for the drivetrain and technology."
"What’s even more stupid is when they say, “I don’t hear wind noise. Or road noise. It’s whisper quiet”.  Like shut the fuck up dude. Model Y (which I have) and model 3 are noisier than a 2015 Prius"
"It doesn't help that this is the line Tesla employees use fairly often. No engine so you hear the other nosies more. Tesla has used that line on me two separate times. I guess if you're coming from an old truck or something. My Accord was quietter than the M3, and it was not a particularly quiet car. Sure at idle the M3 is much quietter, but once you're moving it's mostly road noise."
"I came from a Jaguar XF-R which has a 5.0L V8 supercharged with a mild exhaust system on it.  It was very quiet inside cruising on the freeway.  My Model S is definitely much louder on the freeway (and a Model 3 is even louder still).  In the city, no contest the Tesla is quieter."
"Porsche offers an upgrade of “thermal and noise insulated glass”. Mercedes has a similar upgrade. Those cars are like tombs, even when flying down a poorly maintained freeway at 85 mph. 

Honesty only louder car I’ve owned than my Model S was a STi with terrible summer tires."
Road noise is also dependent on the type of tires you use. It varies on tread and softness. That's why you hear jeeps with off road/mud tires  forever away.
I appreciate your perspective. I came from a Lexus to my Model 3 and there’s a big difference in road noise. The noise is more pronounced in the M3 because of the lack of engine noise IMO but it is still louder than my Lexus. I drove a S recently and it was significantly quieter than my 3 but still not where a $80+k vehicle should be.
"I think you're a bit harsh, I wouldn't call the overall quality of the body below average, more like a pretty damn mixed bag. But I still agree with the overall sentiment, I love my Model 3 but the wind and road noise are the biggest disappointments with it.

It seems like Tesla are aiming to innovate with the chassis just as much as with the drive train, e.g. super bottle, octovalve, mega casting, structural battery packs, weird molding tech, reduced wire harness, exoskeleton and ""transparent metal"". Hopefully Tesla bodies will be cheap, light, silent, durable, and overall amazing in a few years."
"Bjorn on YouTube had somebody put in tons of dampening pads in the doors, wheel wells, trunk etc and he was still underwhelmed lol"
"It really doesn’t. Unless your ice car has a super loud exhaust or a otherwise loud big engine you only hear road and wind noise at highway speeds. 

I had to put on noise canceling headphones sitting in the back of a model 3 for a few hours. So loud."
"This, so many people say “EVs are so quiet since they don’t have an engine”. Well no most cars at freeway cruising speed when the engine is under light load you can’t hear the engine. It’s all wind and road noise"
">Door seals

Since Tesla is a luxury brand you should be comparing apples to apples. My alpine white BMW did not have bumper color mismatches. Not sure if it makes sense to compare it to Nissan and forgiving Tesla about the mismatch (not saying you are). But we should hold Tesla to higher standards given the money you pay. I feel for the people with Teslas with mismatch bumpers."
What do you do for fun there?
I ordered mine on the 27th of September and am in Long Island New York. My suggestion on dealing with the wait is to just try and forget about it. When something important is gonna happen tesla will contact u.

What time? Mines at 2pm at the Americana in Manhasset!
"Uh yeah, it’s called literally every trade job outdoors. So thank you for detailing my analogy and making it more complete for me to strengthen my argument.

If we start removing seatbelts because they’re uncomfortable like some cabin wind noise over safety, that’s a problem. That helps my case. Dual-paned glass isn’t going to prevent an object intruding into a vehicle anymore than one does."
The original commenter’s point is that a window breaking tool won’t work on these windows...
"Uh what? Your second sentence helps my case lol. Yes, you should have seatbelts. Removing them because they’re uncomfortable like wind noise to give up safety is wrong.

And my question is with a window breaking tool as well."
"Uhmm, Car keys?"
Yeah that it. I'm totally wearing khakis.
I did. I'm right behind you
Really? These floating windows are flimsy to begin with. Accidentally broke one after just two weeks of ownership.
">Not gonna spell it out

Because you made it up?

>but cars have sensors and people commiting insurance fraud are generally self-aggrandizing and stupid.

Sensors? What sensor can tell who broke the window? A camera is the only sensor which can do that, and you'd know if there was a camera or not.

More importantly, what insurance even checks that for something like a broken window? Every time I (or someone I know) has had a similar thing happen they haven't even so much as asked for proof it broke, other than maybe a picture. They certainly haven't sent people out over a broken window."
"To state the opposite, my extra door seals make almost no difference. Wind noise comes through the windows and their seals.



The most prominent road/tire noise comes from the back, and i'm planning to get some noise insulation in the trunk area. Model 3 build in may 2020."
"Roof seal kit changed my wind noise drastically. Not every car has the same fit and finish, sadly."
"Model 3?  The roof strip was only useful for early models.  Tesla fixed the noise issue shortly after they started making them.  I have VIN 27666 (something like that) and mine didn't have the issue so they fixed it quick.

I installed the door seals and didn't notice a huge difference but it was slightly better."
"It does, yes. I notice a couple of things, there's less rumble from the back especially on rough road surfaces and also the sub doesn't boom so much so the bass sounds better. Fitting was a bit fiddly but that was mainly because I had to put the seats down and lie on my back to fit it. End result looks like it was factory fitted though. The seals were a bit of a pain to do and they initially caused the doors to be harder to shut but they've bedded in now. As with the trunk panel, the effect is subtle but changes the tone of noise. Overall the car sounds mellower I guess."
"Don’t get your hopes up. Model 3 is the loudest EV I have driven. My Mini SE is significantly quieter - and I did all of the DIY seals and whatnot for the Tesla. 

The double paned glass will be a huge improvement to Tesla’s cars, assuming they also improved the factory glass seals."
"YouTube ppl say it doesn’t work w their decibel meters, but it looks nice"
"What is most noticeable is the snow tire noise now. I was told you can't buy the foam tire inserts, and snow tires are already inherently noisier."
"Well, I’m in NZ but these are products that are imported from the US. Other places will do them which will ship and likely a lot cheaper than ours are."
"No, I think the problem is in the dash grille near the windshield. When is cold the plastic is more rigid and rattles, when is hot the plastic is more 'gummy' and doesn't vibrate.  I have tried to put some foam sheets under the grill but without success."
Check out [this] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/j6gu50/comment/g7ytw72) thread.
"Not wind noise. I guess I’m lucky with mine because wind noise isn’t an issue. Then again our roads are terrible so the roar from that drowns most other noises out and that’s why the echo chamber at the back was bad. The door seals do help with ingress of dust into the door sills though. I also have the seals fitted to the frunk and trunk which may make a difference too but the main reason for fitting them was finding so much dust around the edges. Given the choice of one or the other, the trunk liner is the best bang for the buck."
"What is this ""showering"" you speak of?"
"Many luxury cars have laminated front and rear side windows. E400 wagon, s class, ls460, a8, 7 series, etc. those cars are truly dead quiet"
"Is noise suppression only for first class, or do the kids not need hearing protection? It seems pointless to me why only half the car would get it."
"They chose not to, which is a shame. Most road surfaces are crazy loud in a 3 or even an S conpared to similar priced german cars."
"Wondering about this one too, Tesla seems to be fixing all the complains customer have over the years hopefully they'll fix this too."
"I doubt it.  The main issue is the noise generated by the tires making contact with the ground.

So if you reduce the energy dissipated by the tire contacting the ground, you reduce road noise *and* improve efficiency.  Unfortunately, that's a hell of a trick to pull off."
And that’s a 20 year old Honda. Try a new accord and I bet it’s quieter but can’t say I’ve tried one.
"YMMV, but my 2014 Prius is significantly noisier than my 2018 3. It's less obvious because of the engine buzzing along though."
"I saw that. The dB-meter showed no difference but Björn said that subjectively, the sound was a tiny bit less unpleasant."
Exactly. The “surprisingly quiet EV no engine” thing is really noticeable under like 5-10mph. On the freeway it doesn’t help even a tiny bit.

"> So thank you for detailing my analogy and making it more complete for me to strengthen my argument.

LOL - not only are you wrong - you're delusional too! :D

The question of how much the extra strength of dual layer glass will help is not known by you or anyone on this thread, but the point you were *incorrectly* trying to make, was that they would worsen 'trapped in the car' scenarios, which are already so rare as to be statistically insignificant oddities, and thus the window strength will have no *significant* impact either way there.

However, you can go on YouTube and see any number of car crash tests, dash cam videos etc., where car windows are getting broken, which often results in glass flying at the occupants, and thus we can infer that these are much more common, and any strength increase that reduces these number of breakages will have a positive impact on injury rates.

You may not agree, but your argument from incredulity neither strengthens your original fallacious claim, nor your incoherent and incorrect analogy."

"Same here, but that's because the only other EV I've drive is a rented Model S. Oh, and a golf cart once."
"Yes! Your best bet is a dealer trade for an existing mini on the lot somewhere. You can tell your local dealer what you want, or better yet start by finding something close-ish (500 miles?) on Autotrader and bring the listing to them. Do not contact the dealer that has the car!! If you do they will be less likely to hand it over to your local dealer. Shipping yourself from the other dealer is a PITA and expensive. Dealer trade is the way to go. 

It’s a fairly rare car. Some of these may be cancelled orders (speculation). Don’t expect a discount off MSRP. 

I was going for a base model, but they were able to locate a mid tier. Glad it worked out because the audio system and interior is awesome. 

It’s a genuinely amazing EV and so. much. fun. to drive!"
We get stiffed on import duty unfortunately. I tend to support our local suppliers if they have the product I’m after but sometimes we have to buy from abroad and shipping plus duty usually doubles the cost. Lots of places won’t even ship here so we have to go through an intermediary and that adds to the cost.

"Let us remember a 100kWh pack used to cost around 40k by itself not too long ago, it's not like there was much room left for these whereas how expensive would an engine be or a chassis sharing a platform with much larger volume models? 

Now that they can sell the Model S starting from 70k they could throw 30k at it worth of luxury upgrades and bring the price back up but is that what we want? Would also not be less people willing to buy? That's the point of reducing cost, to increase volume."

"Actually, Tesla is very reasonable compared with the likes of BMW. The price of a Tesla here is basically the same accounting for exchange rate and GST plus a bit for shipping. That’s why you can have a Performance Model 3 for $100K and a BMW M4 costs $174K and you’ll lose half that in the first year of depreciation."

"Even the phase out of 7k tax incentives hit their sales numbers and had to adjust the price. You can find out how small percentages of the final cost has influenced demand all over the globe where EV incentives were removed. Back on the topic of where the money went into the car vs an ICE car of similar price, it's clearly the drivetrain.

Now that it's much cheaper they reduced the cost of the car and we know the plan to increase the price again by making the car with newer cells, likely more storage capacity, more motors etc., it's not going to go to luxury features when they upgrade to 4680 cells, structural packs and megacasted front and rear."

"One thing I don't understand: how is this more simple than the normal batteries? Tesla said it's tabless and therefore simplifies manufacturing. But from what I understand, it seems like it has lots of tab-like things every few inches in the ""jelly role"". I understand the benefits (shorter path for the electrons, less resistance, etc.) but it seems more complex to me. Anyone know what I'm missing?

"my understanding is that 2170 and 1865 have tabs soldered on and the line has to stop during the soldering process.

4680 has the contact area as part of the manufacture of the actual sheet that is rolled. There is no soldering and the line doesn't have to stop.

It still has a contact area but it isn't a separate object and isn't attached or added on, it's just part of a simpler to manufacture design.

Think of it as the difference between baking blank cookies and adding chocolate chips after they come out of the oven vs putting the chips in the batter before baking and just making the cookies without having to add chips manually afterwards. Both are still chocolate chip cookies but one is much easier to make (if you are going to make large batches).

So ""tabless"" could have been called ""integrated tabs"" or ""integrated contacts"" instead? But they choose ""tabless"" to highlight that it removes a step in the manufacturing process."

"Big Clive did a video on them I think that explains them. I'll see if I can find it

Edit I misread he doesn't talk about manufacturing them. Here's the video anyway https://youtu.be/mYP1sIuOKGY"
"The old style tabbed battery could never be this big because the tab or voltage choke point, would lead to hot spots.  

This new design has no single tab to act as a bottleneck, hence the “tabless” designation.

The new design appears to have many tabs.  That is because this design allows for multiple points of voltage entry and exit.  

This multipoint distributed design allows for a much bigger battery."
"Welding a tab is a very slow point in the assembly process, and a tabbed design has higher internal resistance since the entire current has to flow through the width of the tab.

Tabless just folds together like shingles when the jelly roll is pushed into the casing. Less internal resistance since current (as well as heat) can flow through the entire edge of the current collector without a bottleneck."

The cake is a lie.
I’m considering installing an 18650 inside so it can power things
Not sure what you mean.. but the battery pack will have a few thousand of these.
I don't know the science behind it but a lot of it is just the use case. There wasn't a huge need for a battery like this in the past. Now there's a massive use case that's probably bigger then the old battery market combined so they can push forward.
"They were too thick to properly cool their insides if you drew currents from them that were commensurate with their capacity, meaning several times that of an 18650 or 21700 cell. It wouldnt have been an issue with low power appolications though."
"round ""jelly roll"" is easiest to manufacture"
The non-round are called 'prismatic'. Apparently the industry has been expecting prismatic cells to become cheaper than round cells for a long time but it hasn't happened yet.
Funny enough. The round shape improves surface area for cooling with their wavey aluminum cooling channels. So very little space is wasted after adding in the cooling channels.
"I thought the same thing! But I guess yeaj, it's for economic manufacturing"
Electrons travels better/shorter path plus heat dissipation rate is better
I’m contemplating housing an 18650 inside and turning it into a powerbank haha
There are dozens of us!
Yeah true but modeling those “tabs” in CAD would be kinda painstaking and difficult. Sharing STLs are easy.
It has to be consensual
"Just bought one!

Hope you make a ton of cash this is awesome."
I see. That makes sense. Thank you.
"Since you seem to know some about cells I’ll ask you.

In the presentation they said the anode, cathode, and separator are attached to the tabs in the cell. The anode, cathode, and separator layers being the “cell” part that holds the energy and the tabs being the positive and negative terminals like on the ends of a AA/AAA cell.

So these tabs in the picture are the +/- terminally thingies.

Where does the anode/cathode/separator go? Don’t the tabs take up a ton of internal space? And how are the layers connected to the terminals? Don’t the tabs take up space that could’ve been taken up by more anode/cathode/separator?"
"I get the gist but still don’t understand the exact detail of how this is being manufactured. 

In the tab design, they have to solder it in on both ends of the roll. 

In the “tabless” design, shows that it actually has a lot of tabs. But they don’t solder it. What do they do then? And couldn’t they use that same technique right now on tab design?"
"Oh, I figured it was because their programmers are using four spaces in their editor, like civilized people."
"Tabless is less about the manufacturing process and more about resistance and heat during charging. The many ""tabs"" folded over at the top are normally just a single tab at the end of the jellyroll. In a tab design, the larger the diameter, the hotter it gets during charging. But with tabless, the heat is relatively constant."
"Adding on to that, with taps you need to restock machines for taps and soldering wire. That means the productionline will have downtime."
"I ended up watching until the end. The guy explains it very well, but he concludes by saying that the new batteries are now on par with the pouch cells in terms of thermal resistance and other metrics. So that begs the question of why Tesla didn't just switch to pouch. Are there other advantages to cylindrical?"
Thanks. That really clears it up. I didn't realize it was all one piece of copper (or whatever metal they use) and the ends are just laser cut rather than welding on the tab. At least I think that's what he was saying.
"Elon didn’t mention it, but I would image having such a large contact cross-section could also allow for much faster charging."
"I'm so happy that Elon called out the 0 on 18650 and dropped it. That extra 0 was such a stupid thing to have in the name. I don't care what excuse someone tries to use, an excuse isn't a good reason. 

Consistent, effective naming conventions are really critical, and a huge help at practically every level. Look at how good USB was with it's generations, until the USB Consortium ruined it - that ruining of it shows just how stark the difference between good and bad is."
I want them for electric unicycles. So far we have to use 4p or even 5p configurations for high capacity packs. That is a LOT of soldering points and (pack-)internal resistance for a 84V or 100V battery.
Probably around 1k.
"Ah gotcha, thanks!"
"And stronger, right?"
It seems this cell will not be using that method of cooling.
"Batteries do and always have cooled more effectively up-down than they do through the side. 

Make note of the square-cube law, increasing the size of the object increases the surface area squared, but the internal volume increases as a cube. The bigger the object, the less surface area there is relative to internal volume."
Dozens!!
well at least 3!
Pow right in da kissa
"The tab is also a separate part that can fail, and in production, this is fewer failure points. A ""simpler"" design will have fewer points of potential failure."
"apparently the contacts on the ""tabless"" design start out continuous like the bottom stripe on the US flag before being cut, the cut sections are the things you think look like tabs. Or as another example think of a poster/flyer on a cork board with phone numbers on tear off sections at the bottom. They started out as a flat piece of paper and someone cut slits around the phone numbers. If you don't tear it off it's still attached because it started out as one object.

On a tab design there is no contact section to cut, you have to add the tab onto a blank looking area by way of soldering a stiff wire onto the jelly roll."
Well I'm not as focused on code as Richard. If the girl is hot I'll sleep with her no matter what editor she prefers or what programing language she uses.
Well normally you can feed these machines while they are running. I worked at an SMT plant and my main job was “hot” splicing new reels of components to the almost empty reels. The machine would never stop. The solder printer could also be topped up while running. If you were good and doing a long enough job your line wouldn’t stop for the 12h shift. Of course the machines would error out every now and then but that was usually once an hour or two so very few stops.
I think manufacturing speed and compactness.  Cooling on the tabless design is also another big plus.
"Manufacturing efficiency.

If you think of manufacturing as a highway, you want to keep things running as fast as possible.

Fabricating a roll of a single layer of *stuff* is generally faster than trying to stack multiple layers of *stuff*."
Dave from the eevblog is my favourite engineering guy. He has been a great asset of my engineering journey. He has a way of explaining things.
"There are 3 types of cells, cylindrical, pouch and prismatic.

The reason Tesla chose cylindrical was the massive price difference as everything else was way too expensive.

In general, there is no one-size-fits-all, perfect solution.

Cylindrical cells for example are extremely cheap and since you have lots and lots of them you can afford to lose some of them without ruining the battery which means lower cost as you don't have to make sure 100% of them are perfect.

Pouch/prismatic cells may offer longer life, less wasted space, lower internal resistance (less heat), higher energy output, etc but are more expensive and difficult to manufacture, require redesigning the entire car as they may be bigger/thicker, etc.

"There are trade offs in all choices, this design removes some of the disadvantages of the cylindrical cell, but leaves the advantages. Which I think are mostly simpler manufacture, and cooling."
That's pretty much what he says (and it's based on what we know about these cells but things may change as Tesla keeps working on them).
"6x the power per cell, with significantly less heat generation.  Like 1/10th of the heat (from resistance alone, that is)"
"The extra zero is important when you consider that it's part of a naming convention that also applies to very thin batteries. A CR2032 needs that extra digit because it's fundamental to the shape and therefore use of it. 

You mention consistent naming conventions -- that's exactly what the ""extra"" zero is. It's consistent with all other cylindrical battery measurements. 

Otherwise, since people usually remember their weights in multiples of 10 pounds, you may as well say that X person weighs 13 pounds and Y person weighs 14 pounds -- which is fine until you need to weigh a 5lb bag of flour."
I missed that part. Was that in the battery day event? Do you remember around when?
What? The sides of an 18650 and 2170 have much more surface area than the top and bottom.
Gaggles!
"It’s ok, we will print more of us"
"Just a point - this actually has a \*lot\* more potential failure points, as each of the ""microtabs"" could fail - but it is massively resilient to those failures as a system, as the next ""tab"" is only a tiny distance away on each side and can continue to serve as much current. In a 16850, if a tab fails, the cell is dead - in these, you would have to lose hundreds before the cell would completely fail.    It's a gorgeous bit of engineering."
Thanks. So the entire strip or layer is made of copper? I believe I recall reading that it’s laser cut to have those “tabs”.
"Ohh okay, I have only had experienced with machines that had to be stopped to be refilled."
👍thanks. Good chart.
"Ya, if you can get 6x the power out, you would wonder if you can get 6x the power in, as well?"
"wow, that is massive. Those batteries will be absolute beasts. I ride a r/electricunicycle and the EUC fanbase is already pretty excited about those puppies."
"If the extra 0 is important, when why not call it the 180650?

Your comparison with weights isn't a good comparison, because we're talking about specific units (mm, or pounds) - there is no reason to either add or subtract a 0 from that and arbitrarily turn it into tens or tenths. Especially as the cell name uses mm for one dimension and tenths of a mm for another dimension. For your comparison, it would be more like adding or dropping a digit when talking about men's pant sizes - which (in the US) are in inches (but not quite inches, because people are fat yet don't want to feel fat). Besides, in the UK people often describe weight in stone, if you just want to get a number with lower magnitude."
"I think was mentioned as being cooled on the bottom, Sandy Munro recently did two follow videos to Battery Day. In one of those he answered some questions, one of which was why cool from the bottom and not the top, since heat rises. He said, IIRC that the heat in this cell would be headed towards the bottom."
"I don't remember. There have been several analyses showing the advantage of cooling from the ends, rather than round the middle. This will also make assembling the pack simple and cheaper."
"Yes, and heat transfer is much more effective through the bottom and top than it is the side. Cooling the small bottom/top is better than cooling a larger portion of the side. 

Also note that the 18650 has the most surface area relative to internal volume, so the 2170 cells cool worse through the sides and the new even larger cells would be worse still.

Note the 4870 has >5x the volume/heat generation than a 2170, but only 3x the surface area."
"It's not really a failure point if one of the micro tabs doesn't work, there's no complete battery failure. A failure point is something that would cause the battery to fail."
"https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tabless-2-1600867099.jpg?resize=768:*

shows the roll has 4 layers and the contact layer is full width with the other layers being shorter to expose that single layer of contact where the cut will be made.

It also shows a view where there are 3 batteries worth of layers being made at once. I assume in a prior step they separate 1/3 of the master roll to make a single 4680 roll and maybe cut the notches during that step or after that step.

If it's copper it is copper the close to the full height of 80 mm but it's probably a thin foil not a super stiff layer? I don't know."
"Because thin batteries are more common than narrow batteries?

That's not really the point, though. There is a convention for a reason. If you want to use fewer significant figures than feel free to use a different unit of measurement. Hence, people weighing themselves in stone. 

But the cylindrical battery measurement standard is already established. You literally said that consistency is good in your post -- mildly but substantially altering an existing standard (so that the new convention is indistinguishable from the old) is the exact opposite of that. It creates the opportunity for confusion and unit mixing. 

For instance, there is a currently existing 2050 battery and a ""1865"" battery. One is a coin cell. One is not. Do you see the issue? At a certain point, deviating from an established standard for a mildly better alternative is actually worse. It's what leads to issues like the Mars Climate Orbiter. Units and measurements need to be consistently used and distinct from each other."
"Heat only ""rises"" in a fluid like water or air. In a solid it just goes wherever there is less heat."
I was looking into this more and the advantage is space savings and cost savings in both materials and manufacturing while sacrificing cooling ability. The tabless design has a lower resistance so it will produce less heat so they can use the less good end cooling as the batteries won't generate as much heat.
I'm going to need some sources on that because it doesn't sound right.
"Then, as I said as an alternative, everyone (ie the people before Tesla) should have called it an 180650 battery. That keeps it in line with the 2050 battery's naming. Unless you want to say that the 2050 is a ""250"" or a ""205"" battery.

180650 is a perfectly fine name IMO. It's a bit long, but it gets the job done and is internally consistent, using the same number of significant figures for both dimensions. I think we both agree on that."
"Correct.

""Heat rises"" is actually ""hot matter in a liquid rises"". Where a gas being a liquid, and ""rises"" means the opposite direction of gravity (or acceleration, in general). This is an effect which is called convection and happens because the hotter the matter the less dense it is, so it tends to ""float"" within the larger volume.

The heat movement that will happen here is conduction, which isn't affected by gravity's direction. There will be next to no convection as all the ""empty space"" in the pack is filled with the structural epoxy."
"I understood this to be incorrect. In the cooling system used in the 3 and Y, you're trying to get the heat out through multiple layers, whereas with end plate cooling, you're *exposing* multiple layers to the cooling plate. The tabless design does cause less heating, *for a given length of jelly roll* but you have a much longer jelly roll in the larger diameter of the new battery, so that's a wash."
"Why do you think Tesla is moving to these cooling systems on cells that create more heat with less relative surface area?

Cylindrical batteries are [hottest in the centre](https://i.imgur.com/pFLlwbf.jpg), so a cooling system that can access the hotter top and bottom of the cells works better than one attaching to the already-cooler outside edge."
"The thing is, it doesn't really matter what previous people ""should have done"", because we can't change that. I would have personally picked millimeters for both measurements with a further delineation for precision where required. But it wasn't up to me and the standards were driven by industry needs when they were established. 

What's important is that, because those standards have already existed for decades, we follow them, or change them wholesale. I'd be fine with calling it a ""18x65"" (pronounced as eighteen by sixty-five), because that is visually and verbally distinct from the existing convention. But we can't call it an ""1865"" because that naming is already taken and thus **ambiguous**. Even if it ""makes more sense"" from an outside perspective, it makes less sense from an industry perspective. Because now we have two naming standards -- the industry standard and the Musk standard. And every time you hear a cell size you then have to ask yourself which convention it's following. And god forbid you get it wrong -- in engineering, mistakes are often very, *very* expensive."
"The new cells create less heat because of the reduced internal resistance from the ""tabless"" design. They are moving the cooling to save on manufacturing costs and improve battery density.

Thank you for the info on top/bottom cooling."
"Pause for a second. So you're saying you're completely opposed to calling it 180650 (notice that there are two zeros there) because.... someone made a dumb decision in the past to call it 18650 **which violated the standard that already existed for those 2050's** and you want to stick with the arbitrary decision to go against the pre-existing standard of the coin cells? 

I said ""180650"" was fine by me, it works.

Besides, I thought you'd be more bothered by the fundamentally terrible fact that AAAA/AAA/AA/D/etc batteries are all 1.5v, but the rechargable versions of those same sizes are 1.2v."
"You’re not getting it mate. Tabless cells create less heat *relative to their internal volume*. 

A tabless battery is still going to create significantly more total heat than a tabbed battery 1/5 the size."
"No, the 18650 is congruent with the standard. It is 18 millimeters wide and 65.0 millimeters tall. The 2050 is 20 millimeters wide and 5.0 millimeters tall. 

This is not an arbitrary decision. It is in line with industry standard. That's *why* it's called an 18650. 

Calling an 18650 a ""1865"" makes it completely ambiguous with a 2050, even though it's more than 10 times taller, and it breaks industry standard with no clear demarcation thereof. That is what I am against.

Edit: and yes, I am against calling it an 180650, for the exact same reason."

I want the option to have the car delivered with the track package wheels.  I feel like the uberturbines are too polarizing to be the only choice available.
"oh i bet you i will! Unfortunatley it won’t be in the very near future, but one day!"
God I want so bad
Looks a bit greenish to me! Which brand of wrap? 3M?
"Yep, it’s midnight but thanks! 🙏"
Is the vehicle lowered or stock height??
"No wrap, it’s stock paint. The tint is from the green grass around being reflected in the paint"
"Everything is stock, I didn’t make any changes...yet 😅"
Performance model is slightly lowered
Is it a performance model ?
Yep.  2020 the Factory 20” wheels came dark grey and has the performance red brake calipers
I haven’t loved black M3’s until now.. what a difference those minor details make!
I am one of those chrome-loving rebels but this looks sick af! You might convert me
Hawt. Are you a fan of smoked headlights? I think it would look good on all black. Murdered M3!
Super clean! Great job! #teamblack
Looks sick! like a modern batmobile
Looking good! Gotta powder coat those calipers tho
"Looks nice!  Prepare to be at the car wash frequently, as I have learned from my blue Model 3. ;)"
Looks fantastic.
"Reminds me of a future ""Knight Rider"" car from that 80s tv show."
"Wow, makes me regret getting the blue"
"Beautiful, what % tint is that on each window?"
All black everything! This might be the best model 3 I’ve seen.
stealthy mane !!
Is this the refresh model 3?
Beautiful! My black Model 3 Performance is coming in December! I can't wait!
That looks so clean 🤙
Beautiful
So so gorgeous
Dude... can we see the interior?
How's the powder coated wheels hold up? Those the sport upgrade wheels?
This is the closest to the matte black prototype they had at the M3 announcement. Looks amazing!
Do you have a before and after?
Smoke the headlights
How is the new heat pump and power trunk?
Straight up Bad Ass!
Thank you! I was thrilled by how it came out. Definitely looks a lot sportier to me.
"If you do, Nikola Pro has a great kit. Never wrapped in my life and was able to get a great outcome. Need to be slow, careful, and have the videos ready"
"I'm definitely not against them! As I mentioned in another comment, the shop recommended the smoked headlights as I was picking it up (so AFTER they had done the powder coating and chrome delete). Had they mentioned them when I dropped the car off, I'm sure I would've said yes. But by the time I saw how good the car looked I just couldn't wait to take it home haha."
"Help me clarify something please. How does tinting the headlights not affect the brightness?
Thanks"
"It would also dim the headlights.  
Reduced functionality for day time looks."
Isn’t there pretty strong sentiment against this from a safety perspective?
Thanks! And I think that will be the very next move.
"Thank you! And yep, haha I've already accepted the fact that I'll be getting washed quite frequently. Worth it though!"
Are there certain types of car wash you want to use or avoid with these cars? I thought I read somewhere that this is the case but I never bothered to look further.
Thanks!
"Haha blue looks great too. It was a tough choice between blue, black, and midnight silver for me. Appreciate that though!"
Naw
Thanks! And i believe the front is 35% and the back is 20%. The photo makes them look pretty dark.
Thank you! Really appreciate that.
Thanks!!
"Nope, unfortunately I ordered this before the refresh announcement (in August). The chrome delete was after market."
The performance model 3 will be SICK. Congrats!
Thank you!
"I can probably post something later today of the interior- I picked this up in September so it doesn't have any of the recent upgrades, I do love the center console wrap I put on it though."
"So far so good! And yes, they're the 19 inch sport wheels."
Thanks!!!!
"Here is the only decent ""before"" pic I've got, sorry that I'm in it and it's taken at a different angle. The car looked great before too, I just liked it a bit more with the added black. 

Hopefully this link works, first time using imgur. 

[https://i.imgur.com/BVVcjXF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/BVVcjXF.jpg)"
"They offered that too at the shop, at that point I just wanted to get the car home to show it off haha. Not against smoking the headlights, they showed me some examples that looked sweet."
I should have clarified that I picked this up in September- no power trunk or anything like that :/ still love it though!
Thanks!
Good to know! I was thinking about doing this myself and wasn’t sure If I was up to it. I struggle with screen protectors sometimes.
"I went from a 2011 Silver Acura TL, to a 2020 Blue Tesla Model 3, and discovered, Silver hides dirt a lot better than Blue."
"For **all** cars automated car washes are not the best.  The rotary brush type are the worst since any trapped dirt or sand can scratch your paint.  The touchless spray kind are better, but also not good since the detergents contain harsh chemicals and it'll eat away your paint over years and years of repeated use.

Hand wash is best making sure not to use a lot of pressure when wiping, but even then touching your car risks marring the paint.  If your rag has dirt and you apply pressure into the paint as you wipe you can scratch it.  Usually will show up as spiderweb scratches.

I use deionized water to wash my car to minimize touching the paint while drying and limit washing to once a week max and try to go every other week.

More washing = more opportunities to accidentally scratch your paint.  You're not talking deep scratches like a key to your car, but imperfections to your paint that you can see at a certain angle.  Since most cars have an orange peel paint job it might not even matter anyway.

Most people do not care about this level of detail and you'll probably get rid of your car before you start hating its paint job so it just depends on how anal you are about it."
"I just use a normal automated car wash.  Have not seen any issues since using it.  The only thing I discovered, the automatic windshield wipers go on, if I don't forget to turn them off."
See the other guys comment to you on why the automated isn't good. I wanted to add in if you do wash it yourself. If you want to keep your paint in the best shape possible make sure you are following the two bucket system.
It really does! Black interior?
Thank you my friend! What % tint is on the back?
Going all black is the only choice!
Do it bro
Super helpful. Thanks!
"Yep, black interior. The only other edit I did was wrapping the center console to get rid of the shiny black surface. I used a brushed metal wrap kit (Kenriko)... It was surprisingly simple to get on and looks great IMO."
"The tint on the back is 20%, the front windows are 35%. The shop had 4 darkness/shading options, so i went with the second darkest in the back and the third darkest in the front. I haven't noticed any significant lack of visibility either."
"Hahaha peer pressure at it’s finest.

^I ^think ^you ^convinced ^me ^now ^too"
Nice! Great look! And thanks for the info. I’ll be sure to put mine up here when it comes in.
"Thank you! And awesome, can't wait to see it :)"
"Damn you must really hate the aero cover, took that off right off the bat"
"looks familiar, is this in Carlsbad?"
You look so happy! Congratulations!
Congrats - glad you got that life stuff sorted out! Carlsbad was the closest they get to us (Mission Valley) -- the folks in CBD are infectiously happy about their product!  :D
Congrats! The white interior with the black looks extra luxurious in this photo. Have any modifications planned?
How does cancelling work with Tesla? Thinking of ordering soon but won't take delivery until end if December and there's a slim chance I might need to cancel. And when did they run your credit? At delivery or at order?
"CONGRATS!!! This pic is so cute, you look so happy. Enjoy the new ride!"
Picked mine up from Carlsbad as well! Congrats
Congratulations!
Congrats!
Grats! Enjoy the sweeeeeet ride
🤝🤝
awesome man! its an expensive purchase but completely worth it!
Congrats! Thought that location looked familiar!
Carlsbad!
Why didn’t you wait until order the new refresh?
Congrats bro!!!!!!!!
Way to go! It’s the best feeling in the world!
"Did you give it a name yet?  I've had mine for over two years and immediately named her ""Paloma"". Nikola Tesla was in love with a white pigeon as he described as a man loves a woman, little wierd. I wanted to name the car after that pigeon but was unable to find the name of it, so naming it pigeon sounded odd, but the Spanish word for pigeon ""Paloma"" is used as a female name. Thus I named my four wheeled luv ""Paloma"" as Nikola would've. I have already come up with a name for the Cyber truck I m waiting on it will be ""Nikola"" that way he can rejoin his Paloma."
Happy for you buddy. Life can be a bitch sometimes but also beautiful in moments like this. Enjoy your M3 can’t wait for my MY!
Congratulations ! I plan on buying one by the end of this year hopefully
congrats! i got mine in Carlsbad too 😄
"Way to stick to it! Great dedication, you made it happen! I don’t think anyone has to tell you “enjoy it”. Lol"
Congrats!!
"Congrats! I always say: a decision can either be the best one of your life or the worst. Just wait for the right timing and you'll never regret it!

I got myself a used one - waited a year for the perfect, perfect deal. Got it now and I don't regret anything!"
Congratulations! Just in time for the refresh!
Haha they actually just took it upon themselves to take them off when I asked to buy the cap kit.
Yes!
Yes
Thank you! ☺️ I still can’t believe it’s real! Haha
Thank you!! Yes they definitely are! The Tesla center in Palm Springs is so small so It was really cool to see such a huge facility with so many people excited to be there.
Pretty much just going to tint it and maybe do a chrome delete down the road. I drive around with clients a lot so I can’t do everything that I would like haha.
"When I first ordered they were doing the refundable deposit, but the last two times I ordered it was $100 that I lost when I cancelled. One time they ended up refunding me the money because of my situation. They ran my credit pretty close to my delivery. I went into the store to order and they actually had the configuration I wanted in stock so my order process was less than 48 hours and not a few weeks like most, but I did do the credit application right before I went to get the car."
"When I was talking to one of the Tesla representatives at the dealership near me, they said we can also delay delivery for up to 6 months with no penalty. It might be worth looking into that if you do order!"
Thank you!! It still doesn’t feel real haha! 😊
"Thank you! They called and said I could either wait like 6 days for it to be delivered to the Palm Springs store, or drive 2 hours to Carlsbad and I could get it same day. Obviously I chose to get it same day. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep had I waited the 6 days haha."
Thank you 😎
Thank you!! ☺️
Thank you!! So far it’s been a blast!
100%! It was hard to finally make it happen but it is 100% worth it and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience!
Haha I’ve only ever been to Carlsbad I think like 2 times in my life and both times were car related if you can believe that!
Yes!! It’s so nice there!
I got 2k off and I found out I had equity in my old car so I didn’t want to miss that and be upside down by waiting a month or so.
Thank you!!😎😎
Right!! Still doesn’t feel real!
That’s really cool actually! I wasn’t able to get any more creative than “Normie” for mine. My little brother started calling me Normie when he first started talking and a few weeks ago when I told him I was thinking about buying one when I was visiting him he made me promise I would call it Normie since I grew out of that name as I got older haha.
Thank you! It took me forever to make it happen but all I can say is that it is definitely worth it! You will love yours once you get it😎
Thank you! And Oh man haha yeah I was torn between waiting for a refreshed one or getting the 2k discount on this one. I opted for the 2k discount haha.
"have those mf'rs put that shit back on if you plan to do a bunch of driving! Having them off takes about 10% of your range! Cool if you're just cruising around town and all that, but not if you're actually trying to go places far enough to grab snacks. 10% could be anywhere from 20-40 miles!"
Ayyy this is where I got my Model 3 too! Congrats!
I’ve had mine for 3 months and I still have to remind myself it’s real. And I’m still so in love with the car! I’ve put 8k miles on the car because I can’t stop finding day trips to go on.
Yes that is exactly what I’m doing. I placed my order in September but I am delaying delivery until late January
2k off sounds nice. Kind of wish they were more aggressive on the discount. Congrats though. What is it sr+? lr? Fsd?
Thank you!! It was nice to be able to drive it home through the mountains on my way back to Palm Springs!
You average 88 miles a day damn. I probably average 20 a day. I should drive more
Just SR+! Essentially the 2k off made up for the options I wanted. The broker that hired me when I first started selling real estate had a model x that was black with white interior so I wanted to match her.
I’ve driven my model 3 2500miles and only had it 4 weeks.
I’ve been taking 300-1200 mile road trips almost every weekend since I got the car - usually 300-400 miles.
"Ha nice it’s a great look. I ordered SR+ blue / white interior. I have to wait but I guess that makes it even more exciting. How’s the RE world? Rates are low, we r getting clients under 2.5% now"
"Oh man I love the blue with white, that’s a great choice! It’s been really good out here!! Prices are averaging 24% higher than a year ago and inventory is super low. Most of my business has been listings (thank god) because working with buyers right now is extremely frustrating and competitive. I just had a buyer miss out on 19 houses before we were able to nail one down."
Sounds like you will get to drive him around a bunch though 🙃
I hate you in the best way possible.
What red did you use? I want to paint my garage soon and haven’t started looking at colors.
Nice setup. Why do you have a mirror below your inverter?
"Anyone else OCD kicked in that the cable is not wrapped firm on the wall charger? 😂🤣
Sweet setup."
More garage porn please
This guy Musks
Nice 👍🏿
Envious. My garage is still just concrete foundations 'cos we spent all our cash on the Tesla :D
Sweet!
"Tell me more about your solar setup. As someone who does not geographically live in an area that services Tesla’s solution, I am looking for alternatives.

Edit: I now see “solar city” is a Tesla product.. nice.."
SolarCity flex I 👀👀 it
Oooo i love the red wall backing 😍
That’s legit I’m over here with my mobile connector just hanging out
What’s the black tube to the right of solar city panel? Vacuum? Bank chute?
Just need to add the retracting ceiling hanger
Do you have both a X and 3?

"""Hey there sexy, I'm looking at you!"""
"Haha, I'll go wrap it nicer in the morning. I had it looking good originally, but it shifted since then."
I’m more about the random logo placements.
Haha. Yes.
"Yep, I’d have to box all the electronics into a cupboard 🙈"
"Yeah, I got mine installed during the transition from SC to Tesla, so my experience was mostly Tesla."
"Haha, it's just the hose to my shop vac."
"Nah, no need for that. I have the cable wrapped just right that it's plenty easy to step over or unplug and hang up without needing to wrap it around. I'd only do the hanging thing if you need to go over the car, but I had a lot of flexibility with where the charger could go."
"No, I just really like SpaceX"
Thanks!
Covering all the angles!
Where would you have placed them?
Username checks out  :p
In a grid? Stacked vertically? Grouped together as unit? Anything but willy-nilly.
"Total coincidence! I've had this screen name for 20 years. 

Holy shit, I'm getting old."
"I don't think this is willy nilly, but okay."
"Got all the parts from my service center, there's 4 in total needed.  They changed the pins on the USB hubs so adapters are needed.  smatthew on Tesla Motors Club makes them for $15 or so each.  Both hubs use the same adapter so 2 are needed if doing front and rear.

Rear was easy, the old vent/hub just pulls out and you connect the new one with the adapter and snap the new piece in place.

The center console you have to remove the carpet pieces on the side, 2 bolts on each side in the front and then 2 bolts in the back under the rear AC vents.  Disconnect 2 wiring harnesses and the entire console slides back with enough wiggling.  The front USB hub is attached to the back side of the console with T20 screws.  Simply needed to replace with the new USB-C hub and connect using the adapter and put everything back together.

Put the Tesla OEM USB-C wireless charging pad in place, connected to the single USB-C port and now I have fast wireless charging and 27W USB-C Power Delivery ports in the back."
Now you just need to add the extra usb connection to the glovebox and you almost have the new car!
what speed is the fast charging? is it still 5w?
"With the front all taken apart, how difficult would it be to clean the a/c condenser and replace the filters? Is it one of those ” well, while you're in there, you might as well..."" Or a totally different effort"
How much did that cost you?
Damn that looks nice! Note that if you have a thicker phone or phone case that it will not charge on the pad without a riser under where the phones rest at the bottom of the charging pad. I had to 3d print a riser that bumps it up by about 6mm.
Oh god you have balls of steel for attempting to do this yourself. Props to you!!!
How much for a junk yard MY console. I'll do the rest.
This is great to know is possible. I just want the USB-C out back and now I see the path to get there. Thanks OP!!
Huh. My 2020 model 3 doesn’t have USB-C. I’m fine with that tho. Most everyone I know uses apple phones. My bf can charge his Samsung on the wireless pad.
Yes! We need more DIYs on this sub. Thanks for sharing.
"I was thinking to do this, happy to see it is possible."
"Haha good timing, i pick up the rear USB hub from service center in an hour."
"Total parts cost to replicate what u/SK360 has done is **£325.00** in the UK, if anyone is interested.

The gloss ""phone dock bar"" alone is £55.  Apparently this has gone up in price recently.

It's less than half that cost if you're only buying the front USB hub and rear vent assembly (i.e. if you already have a wireless charging mat)."
"For anyone following along... I bought a USBC power tester...

Getting 25w+ to my MacBook Pro

And 15w fast charging to my iPhone 11
https://i.imgur.com/NqOm98i.jpg"
wow so it’s possible to remove the entire center console. Might be having a lot more ppl attempting to do this to replace the new center console 2.0 with the previous version
Looks like the rear vent/hub also fits better on the new setup - doesn’t have that gap on the top like the old one does. Looks cleaner that way!
where did you get the matte console wrap?
That wireless charger is shit. Hate mine
Are you in LA? Would you do mine too!
RemindMe! 3 months
"I went in to the Santa Ana service center and was looking for a suspension part that was lost when installing coilovers. The guy I spoke with told me they don’t sell parts to customers? I know the parts catalog is online. How did you get these parts?

Great work btw."
Did you need a wire adapter for rear ac vent plugs?
Do the rear USB-C ports support 27W? That is very tempting if they do. Kids drain their iPads all the time and annoying to get USB-C to USB-A cables. Could also charge my MacBook.
Well done!
Awesome install!   Could you please post the Tesla part numbers you ordered?
I'm definitely going to try this.
"Thanks SK360. Very helpful. 

I thought it would be a pain to remove the center console but not bad at all."
"Would love to see photos or better still a video of how you take apart the front, more specifically what you need to take apart to actually do this job. Other videos I’ve seen talk about taking the entire console apart."
"this thread is awesome - thank you u/SK360 for doing all the leg work to answer this question!  


can you do the same with the powered trunk now? :D"
Couldn’t you just buy an A->C adapter
A lot of work for what???
"Didn't know this was possible. Saving this for later. You might want to think about doing a youtube video, unless someone else has already made it. (But I guess you probably don't want to un-do everything just for the vid)"
"I scratched the inside sides of my center console below the phone dock when inserting the TapTes USB hub, and being OCD as I am, I couldn't stand looking at the scuffs so I ordered a new top center console.

I had to completely remove the whole center console out the car to remove the top center console part easily, and man it was a BITCH! But hey I learned something new!"
">The center console you have to remove the carpet pieces on the side, 2 bolts on each side in the front and then 2 bolts in the back under the rear AC vents.  Disconnect 2 wiring harnesses and the entire console slides back with enough wiggling.

The service manual mentions that you gotta remove two torx under the phone caddy - were they not there?"
So is the usb-c for power delivery only? I wonder if you can split off and run it into the glove box
There's no way I'm not doing this once a method becomes well established.
Each USBC port supports 27w.
"If you look at the 7th image with the orange, there's just one screw there (hard to see and get to) that you unscrew, then a plastic cover comes off and the filters are right there. 

Getting to that step is legitimately no more than 10 minutes though, so it's not a big deal either way. If I do this retrofit I'd probably redo the filters too, but the net savings is still small."
The filters are a pain to replace on the model 3 compared to most cars.
"Good question, I didn’t even look to be honest."
"When people first started looking at this project parts were $240 in total for all 4.  Tesla increased price in the last couple of weeks and it’s now $345.    Not cheap but I’m a big fan of using OEM parts and I LOVE the single USB-C dual charging pad 

Front hub - $60

Rear vents/hub - $100

Wireless charge pad - $125

Black plastic bar for the charge pad - $60 😳"
This is why right to repair is getting destroyed. It’s really not that big a deal.
Yeah the back is literally a minute install.  Just need the adapter
iPhone 11 and newer have come with USB-C to lightning cables in the box.
"Figured we needed more than hedgehog pictures, bitching about phantom braking and panel gaps"
"Yeah, you can 3D print a spacer for the stock phone bar or buy one for $15-20.... I should have done that but I didn’t even think about it at the time"
Yeah as long as the mounting points are the same it should be trivial.  Was really easy to pull
Do we know what parts we need to replace the center console and how much that will cost?  I think the new center console looks a lot better
To be fair I think I had popped it off already when I took the pic. I wasn’t expecting it to be so easy
It’s wrapped in XPEL Stealth.  My PPF guy installed it when he wrapped the front of the car
My wife's wireless charger in her Model Y delivered in June is bad.  My wireless charger in my Model 3 delivered in September is good.  Maybe hers is broken or the newer Model 3 one is good?
"Interesting, I expected it to be slow but my few week old model 3 charges quicker than my indoor Samsung wireless charger.  I was surprisingly good with it after planning ahead to need to upgrade it."
Other side of the country!  Sorry lol

"I followed the pics in this thread here

https://tff-forum.de/t/usb-c-retrofit-fuer-tesla-model-3/70243/114

2 10mm bolts on each side in the front.  USB cable on the passenger side.  2 10mm bolts on the back of the console and the big wiring harness in the back.  The 2 screws they show under the phone dock there are unnecessary to remove.  Some people have 2 screws in the recessed area that have to come out but my car didn’t have them."
"> can you do the same with t

Thanks!  I can't take credit as there were some smart people that blazed the trail and made the adapter to make it possible.  

I will be watching the OEM powered trunk stuff closely, I'm not too hopeful though."
USB-A can’t support anywhere near the power output of C.  Adding an adapter does nothing but change the form factor
For 27w USBC ports that support Power Delivery and the OEM Wireless fast charger 🤷‍♂️
"I thought it was pretty straightforward, worst part was the 10mm bolts in the rear with how close the seats are.  A gearwrench would have made life easy"
Yeah so I have seen where there are 4 T20 screws under the phone caddy.... and the guides I saw online said take the 2 inner recessed ones out...   mine didn’t have the inner ones so I tried to pull the console out without touching the other 2 and it came out no problem.
"This is only on older 2018 cars. I started that thread on TMC. We did a pretty deep dive into figuring out what was needed. Smatthew did a great job with the adapters. 

Now I'm looking at the refreshed model 3 console and wondering if it can be retrofitted. Just a thought experiment and a browse of the catalog"
"Front one does data as well, I’m sure you could"
"Not sure how you’d do this practically. The two ports in the front ARE the USB hub. There is one cable coming into it, so you’d have to work out the pins for power and data for both ports, to then run them to the glovebox instead. I presume you’d lose one of the two ports in the console then too.

Presumably the 2021 car has a different left hand side loom."
What speed is the wireless charging?
I believe you have to use a small torx screwdriver (t20?) on that screw.
"Rear console for $100, eh? Sheesh... My 5 year old has scuffed up mine pretty bad, but not ""*it $100 bugs me*"" bad 😬"
How did you place the order? Were they willing to install the parts for you?
"First off, bravo, this is awesome. Second, do you happen to have the part numbers for these items?

[Edit] 
I'm an idiot and actually read the whole thread this time, thanks for listing those!"
I guess they have to make up the added cost of including it somehow
"Only the ""Pro"" models IIRC. This year all usb-c cables and no bricks."
"To be honest I've just decided to buy the OEM part.  I won't dwell on the actual likely manufacturing cost of it vs cost for us to buy, just wanted to get my car up to spec - as you have - with OEM stuff all the way.

Are you able to see how much watts your phone is pulling whilst charging?  I'm going to replace my Jeda wireless mat (which uses 2 USB-A anyway) with the OEM one.  Hoping that as it only uses the 1 USB-C that it will still do a decent job of fast charging..."
ah okay. looks clean!
Charge rates are horrible. That is wireless charging in general though.
In FL to do mine?
"Pittsburgh? If so, I saw your post on the FB group."
The shop lost one of the rubber yellow bumper stops for a shock. Can you DM me his contact?
Awesome! Ordering that adapter and the rear ports from service center today. Thanks for the informative post :)
These are only the Tesla OEM parts right? You still need to get the adapters from smatthew from Tesla motors club? But that's it otherwise?
"Probably a dumb question but you might be able to answer - do you think these part numbers are likely to be worldwide ones? Was there other similar ones on there when you decided on these? I can’t think of any reason that these parts wouldn’t be worldwide, but you never know."
"Thanks.  The linked site, besides being in German, talks about disconnecting the battery, and a few other things that you don't appear to have done?  Or maybe I'm misunderstanding it.  He's also ringed something in green in the first photo too, but doesn't mention what to do with it as far as I can tell.

I've actually been speaking to the German guy who wrote that post on eBay, once I spotted his version of the connectors on eBay (I'm in the UK, so easier for me to get than from smatthew, although he's a star for doing parallel diagnostics on getting this working."
Don't think you said it--how long did it take you? You did all the exploratory work so I'm actually more interested in doing it now.. thx!
It's pretty straightforward until you have to remove the top center console portion. It's very difficult to remove it with the whole console being in the car. I had to MacGyver the whole piece out the car by myself without ensuring the corners didn't see the interior of my car.
"Not sure, I googled it and it looks like 15w on the wireless pad...  my work Android shows fast wireless charging when I drop it on."
"You'll get fast wireless charging  on Android, 10W.

My S20U won't pull 15w even thought it supports it.

Just be aware that yes it will fast charge for a while but the phone slows down the charging rate because it gets hot -I'd say after 20 mins or so the charge rate slows down considerably (even when the phone is still at low-mid SoC). If you pick up the phone you'll feel how hot it get.

These fast charging pads really a fan."
Yes need these answers too. My pixel doesn't charge fast enough.
"Yeah forgot which one. Someone recommended a tiny right angle one for me, but using a regular long one was the easiest for me. If you can get a magentized one too then you're in business. 

Also, some people say the recommend ""Kool it"" canister doesn't have enough, so consider getting a different one. I got a different one that was larger and didn't use all of it, so maybe the regular one is big enough."
You can always get a third party cover for it for way cheaper too
"Contacted parts department at my local service center.  I’m guessing they wouldn’t touch it since it uses 3rd party adapters, didn’t ask as I knew it wasn’t that bad."
Yeah sorry they’re buried but there lol
"I was thinking about ordering a usb power meter thing but I didn't...  I have a 10w wireless charger in my living room and my Galaxy S8 reported the exact same time remaining when I took it out and stuck it on the Tesla OEM.

The Germans showed that each port is capable of providing 27w so I would think each side could still provide more than 10w if both are in use... but who knows."
Yup
Yep that’s it.  Saw a German guy is selling them on eBay as well but ship from Germany
Hummm not sure if they are worldwide but I would imagine so.  Someone posted them to teslamotorsclub so that’s what I ordered
"So I didn’t disconnect the battery, I went into the car settings and powered the car down.  Figured it would be good enough and nothing blew up lol.

The green in the first photo is the USB data cable, there’s a quick connect right where he circled that needs to be disconnected."
Just over an hour.  If I had to do it again I could probably do it in 30-40 mins.
Awesome. All of the new iPhones just released support 15w wireless now. You’ve got me thinking....
I had no idea! Gonna start googling...
"Thanks, I’m going to call them tomorrow 😋"
"Good stuff, thanks. I'll probably be doing this eventually."
Ordered them from him off Etsy! Thanks for this!
You only get 15w on the iPhone 12 if you use MagSafe. Otherwise you’re at 7.5w which basically is what 2.5w more than the current usb A ports? Not much of a difference for the hassle and costs.
"But, it’s something that’s now done and is relatively future proof. If/when there’s something to plug in that uses more watts in the future he can just do that without thinking about whether it’s going to work or not.

As retrofits go, cost notwithstanding, this seems to be as simple and effective as it gets."
"Oh dang, I'm so sorry to see stuff like this. 

First & foremost sounds like you're OK. Hope the car is back on the road & good as new ASAP."
Friendly reminder to look into diminished value claim.
"You and me both brother, hoping you’re back on the road ASAP"
Luckily the wheel and tire came out unscath....... crap. So close.
[deleted]
Oh no :( So sorry to hear that.
"I hear stories about the dashcam never capturing any footage of the accidents drivers are involved in, is it the same case here?"
"Pray for it to be totaled. Mine suffered less damage, took over three months to be ready and insurance screwed me in diminished value"
just curious but did it really need towed?
Damn Damn Damn 🤬
"Def lost again, before and after and good luck?"
"Glad you are ok!

How did the car act to protect you?  Air bags helpful?  Structure helpful?"
"Looks very similar to the damage my 3 got in June.  Took about 6 weeks and $19k in insurance.  Your wheels look untouched, so hopefully there is no trouble with the suspension / alignment."
"I love the look of gray cars, but on an overcast day they can become invisible to a quick glance. I am always conflicted when it comes to picking a car color because that gray just looks so good, especially when it's nice and clean."
Big yikes
You are not the only. A tram can-opened my Tesla 4 years ago... her fault but did not admit it. If i had sentry mode it would be a different story. My insurance had to fork out 35k in repairs...
"I have the same car, was thinking of red calipers...now I am sold"
"If you haven't driven a regular ICE vehicle in awhile, gas station visits feel weird. I haven't been to one in awhile, and it felt weird to visit one."
"That looks expensive. looks similar to Marques Brownlee's S getting sideswiped which was $70,000 in repairs. obviously the car was worth a lot more as a P100D though."
That'll buff out.
"The other driver was a very nice older guy who just didn’t look enough. Unfortunately living in the southern Midwest, the closest Tesla service location is Tulsa... a bit of a drive for me, unfortunately the closest Tesla authorized body shop is Oklahoma City. 

I was actually surprised, while neither window appeared to be broken, when I opened and closed the rear door there was clearly glass shaking around in there. It appears all of the damage is located on both doors shown, the rear quarter panel, and there’s rim/tire damage (right rear wheel). I didn’t notice anything leaking. I sure hope you’re right, the sooner this is back home, happier my wife, the owner will be.

Edited for minor update on locations"
Thanks. I’ve had that experience with a prior vehicle also. Thankfully the other persons insurance is the same as mine (and that he had insurance).
"I asked my adjuster and he keeps giving me bs answers about how only Georgia does it, might have to get an attorney involved i don’t get the resistance the other parties insurance already claimed full responsibility."
I tell everyone this. And if it gets totaled you can’t claim DV
"The biggest concern to me is the rear quarter panel. Doors can be swapped out, but it’s the rear quarter panel and the attached lower running board that will need replacement."
Very similar damage to my RWD LR last year was $27k :-(
25k easily. Mine was headline quarter panel and hold.  13k
I've got the footage...
"I limped the vehicle (drove slowly) about 100 yards to get it off of the major street. The vehicle drove, but there were a ton of alarms (TPMS low, advanced braking, etc.). The rear tire was missing a dime sized chunk of rubber, and there is an odd piece of metal missing from the rear rim. 

So 100% yes it needed towed."
"That is a sincerely good question. Having been in a very similar accident about 10 years ago, I think the car did phenomenally well. Windows didn't shatter, airbags didn't deploy, we have no bruises or sore muscles. The car really felt solid during and after the accident. 10/10 would not recommend getting in an accident, but I would recommend the Tesla.

After thinking about this question overnight, I didn't notice any ""evasive"" driving maneuvers that the car injected prior to the accident. I also didn't see any notification on the display that the car took control.  There was a vehicle turning right, which blocked the Tesla's view of the SUV that ultimately hit us. I think I hit the horn immediately (1/2 second) prior to the impact, but I'm not sure there was any vehicle correction that would have avoided the impact. 

Edited for car's reaction."
Silver lining. We’ve received more compliments on the red brakes! Do it
"In his case, the entire side of his car was destroyed. Seeing the state of that car, I was very surprised it wasn't written off.

This one doesn't look nearly as bad, seems like maybe the offending driver wasn't going too fast. I'm guessing this will still cost around $12-15k all said and done. 😕"
Which shop in Tulsa?
That sucks. Hopefully they total out the car and get a new one into your hands quickly. It's almost never worth it to repair a T-boned car.
"my mom did one of those for a bumper cover getting dinged in the ass. they gave her 1000 bucks, not much but better then nothing"
"Yup, that's the big one. It means a ton of disassembly and cutting/welding.

FWIW, damage that looked very similar to my LR RWD last year was $27k and 6 weeks in the shop. Only about 2.5 weeks was active repair though, there was some waiting on parts and shop backlog."
"Initial estimate is 25,200"
Did you save it manually by clicking the icon?
"I see the little chunk missing from the tire now, I wonder how that happened because it's so far away from the actual impact and nothing around it looks damaged. Interesting"
"If OPs car gets totaled, PM me, I'll take them..."
I *think* 6010 S 129th. At least that’s where it was towed.
Lol. Well we’ll see what’s next.
Considering my other car was 4 months old and got T-boned on the freeway and it wasn't totaled out. It was just under 1/2 the value of the vehicle to repair and they wouldn't total it.
"Yeah I took a $10,000 hit to depreciated value in a VW Golf R about 4 years ago and insurance refused to total the vehicle and offered no depreciated value help because I hadn't opted for it.  DA FUQ USAA?  Carfax had it listed as a major collision despite being cosmetic damage only (major due to the cost of the claim) and I was able to get lucky by the dealer I was trading it into had a buyer who was willing to overlook the carfax after they saw the body shop repair invoice with parts replaced and confirmation from the VW dealership body shop manager that no moving or mechanical parts were damaged.

Needless to say, I've got it now on all our cars and dropping the deductible from $500 to $250 was only about $10 more every 6 months."
"Initial estimate is 25,200"
Nope. Was auto saved. I’ll see if I can find it on my usb
Wheels turn. :-) I had to limp the car off the street.
It better not be totaled!
Tesla doesn’t list any certified body shops in Tulsa.
Were you at fault? If not and the other person had a different insurance company your car insurance will normally sue them if they refuse to pay the depreciation claim because it's the at fault drivers insurance that should cover it out of their property damage liability insurance. If you were at fault that is key because the property damage liability on your own policy doesn't cover your own vehicle which makes sense because if it did fraud would be easy. I'm not one to defend insurance companies but that rule makes sense. So going by what you said I'm going to make an educated guess and say you were at fault?
"Like other people said, it tends to cut off the part where the accident part actually happens, so I’m just thinking ahead in case it happens (which I hope never will🤞). 

Do I click the camera button during the time of accident, wait 1-2min to click save, or not click at all to then find it in the recent dash cam footage?"
I get that but I wonder what damaged it because it looks like something pierced it
"You are correct. Curiously, when I did the roadside assistance to have the car towed it asked if it was in an accident and if the car was drivable. Yes it was in an accident and no it wasn’t drivable. The location it was towed was why was recommended by Tesla. Appears a certified shop is in Oklahoma City."
"Technically yes.  It was a multi-car pile up on the interstate where one car hit the one in front of them, the car behind them slammed into the car in front of them and so on until it was my turn to eat the rear end of the truck in front of me and then I got hit from behind by another driver.

Cops basically said everyone was at fault.  We were all doing the speed limit~ish but that doesn't help when you need to go from 70 to zero in 20 feet (length of my tire marks)"
"Well I'm wrong. It was available a few minutes after it happened, but NOW in reviewing the saved files, it apparently was overwritten by newer videos."
"Is that related to the honk to record? I've seen videos where it freezes on the honk which is right where the accident is happening. 

I thought you had a rolling ten minute window where you can click the icon to save the last ten minutes. Not sure if I'd be composed enough to remember to push it."
"was in an accident as well, i waited a couple minutes to save it (got out of the car to check if the other party was alright and then went back to my vehicle to click save)"
"So I took off my asshole hat. If you turn the wheel so the puncture is right next to the quarter panel with damage, it’s appears to only be an inch or two from the area of the damage, so it seems most likely part of his bumper or radiator caused it."
I’m dropping off my X in OKC this Thursday
tesla just within the past month opened a tesla service center in tulsa! it’s the 129th one you were talking about. both tulsa and okc locations are very new
That's how it works. Those are ironic situations because even if the person did something wrong in front the onus is still put on the person in the back who rear ends them because they should have technically been paying attention and at a safe distance so they could have stopped. The reality is most people don't drive with enough distance in front of them to do anything in these instances.
😢
\*sad trombone noise\*
"I jumped into the car shortly after and watched the accident. Unfortunately, I didn't press the dashcam button to save the file. (DAMNIT). I also didn't have the Save on Horn feature enabled."
Yes... unfortunately it isn’t a collision center
We can watch the fire truck parked behind my vehicle. :-)
You need more storage if it overwrote that quickly
"So I guess we should just lay on the horn for a moment after we get hit so the footage saves, huh?"
"Hmm, it’s a 256GB microSD. Lots of activity for about an hour around the car so I’m sure it was recording the whole time. I should have had Record on Honk enabled. I also should have just pressed the dash cam button."
"Definitely not, a honk can very much save you from having an accident in the first place. I would suggest honking as usual and click the dashcam icon again after 1-2 mins or try to disconnect the drive ASAP so your most recent dashcam footage doesn’t get overwritten"
"I wasn't suggesting you intentionally wait to honk until after an accident, just saying a quick beep could get the footage saved easier than hitting the save button on the screen if you're in shock after an accident."
"If you don't mind my asking, what did everything cost? I've had a quote for $600 to $800 for windshield, all sides and rear. Probably not doing the roof.

But loving my black 3! Have the chrome delete kit coming in about a week"
Looks awesome! Chrome delete would tie it all in nicely in my opinion.
Happy to see another black model 3! :)
"Damn. I went 20% all the way around, no windshield, and still nervous I'll get stopped for tint."
Wonder what it'd look like with chrome delete.
Looks nice. Are you going to chrome delete?
What's it like looking out the windows at night?
I’m so jealous of the dark rims every time I see them lol. I got mine a few months before they started offering it
You don’t like seeing nature or getting sunlight?
Love it!
"Looks gorgeous, low profile, and eye catching.  

*get them pretty rims replaced ASAP before they bend*"
I should have gotten mine that dark now seeing yours. I do love the dark tint. Also welcome to team Black! Any other mods you gonna add?
More pics?
So good!
"Looks good!

I wanted to do the Air 80 on the windshield, but it is too blueish and I have a whole black and white thing going on.  I ended up doing a ""normal"" 80% on the windshield."
Looks awesome
Well that was more obvious than I thought it would be
Looks great! Is it tough to see at night?
"I'm so glad you posted this. What color interior do you have? 

I got the same exact tint on the sides, back and windshield put on my model y 2 days ago as you have on your M3. On my car, the 15% IRX on the sides looks more like what I have known 35% to look like however I did not get any tint added to the roof and I have white interior which I was told reflects a LOT of light making the tint appear much lighter. (I can see right into the sides during mid day sun)."
SICK! looks so good
I’m curious why you tinted the roof if it already has tint. Just not as dark as you want it?
[deleted]
Looks so nice
"Southern California prices are a little higher in general. For something like this, I was quoted $1200 (+- $100) from multiple shops. That is for OP's exact tint types. here is a cost breakdown I recieved (includes all 9 windows and windshield): 

 $805 LLUMAR ATC with AIR windshield 

$960 LLUMAR CTX with AIR windshield 

$960 LLUMAR AIR  with AIR windshield 

$1165 LLUMAR IRX with AIR windshield 

$1215 LLUMAR IRX with IRX windshield "

I paid $750 for ceramic tint 20% on all side windows/rear/roof with 70% on the windshield. Central Cal
I just had full windows and sunroofs done in UV protectant XPEL film for $1250 - Texas
Chrome delete will be the next project. Gonna try gloss black.
Impossible. Have to roll the windows down.
is there any way to make the white sport wheels black :(
It is not a drastic difference IMO. Only slightly reduced
This is the black interior.
Not sure about OP but I tinted my roof so the tint would be uniform from the roof to the back windshield.
I tinted my roof. It cuts down on heat for the kids in the backseat. It does also cut down on visibility although I don’t mind too much.
Essentially. The direct sun from the roof will make your tint on the sides “appear” lighter. That’s why I went 5% up top.
"Agreed, I'm also curious why you would tint the roof. 

Wonder if he keeps the car cooler."
"Keep a dunkin donuts gift card in your console, when you get pulled over just pull it out and put it in your cup holder so they can see it."
Would you mind sharing which SoCal shop you ended up going with?  I’m considering going this route and trying to get a feel if the shops in my area are on the higher or lower side.
"Also in Orange County. Completed about two weeks ago, $800 llumar ctx with air windshield and $1,300 ppf"
"I got the LLUMAR IIRX all around including roof + Air80 windshield. All for $1k out the door. Located in Santa Ana, CA."
"Oh damn ok. So the $600 to $800 price point was primarily based around what type of tint. Like I think the 800 was double ceramic and shit. Something crazy.

One place quota me $1200 😂😂😂"
Was this in San Antonio?
I must be in a small minority who prefers the chrome. Car looks great either way though!
I've been really curious how red trim on black body would look. Probably a little sith.
"I did mine in satin black.  IMO gloss is too matchy matchy. 2020 performance 3 with 18% on sides and 5% on back window and top glass 

https://imgur.com/a/pCZErno"
"Absolutely, you can take it to the body shop and have them powder coated. Price I usually see is like $500"
"That's what I thought but was hard to confirm in the photo. I'm going to run a test tomorrow if it's sunny out. I'm going to put a blanket over the roof glass just to simulate a darker roof and see how much that affects the ability of how well I can see into the vehicle from the sides. 

That will isolate the variable of the seats to test if the white seats do in fact reflect so much light that I need to go darker tint to compensate. 

If that does make the side tint appear much darker then I'll leave the sides alone and just add the roof tint. However if that does not make much difference then I'll need to go darker on the sides as I was looking for a result like your car has as far as darkness from the sides.

Would you mind posting or sending a photo sitting inside looking out of the sides and rear window during the day? I'd like to get an idea how dark it is while driving."
That makes sense. I haven’t had passengers in the back for very long so no complaints yet. But with the hot summers I get I may consider it down the line.
I didn’t think about that. I’ll keep that in mind when I do mine. Car looks great by the way.
"I'm thinking about adding the roof after my test i'm going to run tomorrow that I mentioned in my other comment. Are you still able to see out the roof? 

Everyone that sits in my model Y loves to look out the roof, it's an eye catcher so I wouldn't want to change the wow experience too much but I do need it darker inside the cabin."
It does keep the car cooler.
This is from signature tint shop. They have done a lot of my cars and do great work.
"Have a name for the shop? Would be cool to check out for others. I personally have done my tints yet, but this is what I was quoted by the guy I've gone to for my other vehicles."
Dallas
"I chrome deleted my fender cameras, handles, and very carefully the side mirrors. But left the trim of chrome just around the windows. It’s perfect"
Sure. Ill try when I get a chance.
I can still see out of the roof and back window pretty clearly. I think it makes it more enjoyable.
Thanks!  That’s the one in Costa Mesa?
">  got the LLUMAR IIRX all around including roof + Air80 windshield. All for $1k out the door. Located in Santa Ana, CA.

"Not a Bot but I Googled:

$79,279.11 CAD = $59,758.21 USD total cost
$1,001.39 CAD = $754.81 USD charging cost"
"One month in, all I’ve spent is on accessories #shameonme

Thanks for the post!"
"I’m waiting for my Y to be delivered in Ontario so this is super helpful, thanks! That rebate, though (*cries in Doug Ford*)"
"One tip regarding tires: I used to live in Toronto myself and at first I also had one set of rims and two sets of tires. After the second time changing them out when the seasons changed, I was told that my rims would suffer a lot if I kept changing the tires 2x year. They advised me to buy a second set of rims instead (which I did and I just got really plain ones with hubcaps for the winter, and kept my ""fancy"" aluminum ones for the summer)."
Thanks for the good post. Only issue I found was you said the windshield cost you a $500 insurance premium. I think you mean deductible.
"Thanks for posting!  Now that rates are 12.7c sustained how much has your charging bill gone up?


Also, how was the process of getting your class replaced?"
"I noticed a lot of people outside this post also don’t post their locations which is a big factor .

I see people posting about $3-5 for a full supercharge .  I tried it on Long Island and was $13-14 ."
So all that gas money saved went to insurance you can say
I appreciate the write up - thank you. What's your verdict in the end.. Do you love the car or have any regrets?
"Thanks for this. I bought mine in 2920 so no rebate. I paid $75,000 plus taxes LR AWD w/FSD, Blue paint.

My daily driving is about 2,000 KM per month so similar to yours. Charging at home costs about $50/mo compared to about $240/mo fuel for  a Honda Civic. Haven't paid for Supercharging yet. I just used up my 1500 free KM. (Due do Covid I haven't been travelling. BTW Tesla gave me an extra month to use my free KM.)

My insurance is quite a bit less. 

I've been thinking about wrapping the front bumper. I would like to know what you mean by partial wrap vs complete front."
That $14000 Ontario EV rebate was sweet. I would have loved that.
"You can put this stuff in [Keemut.com](https://Keemut.com) and get a report that shows you your cost/mi and more.

Did you pay up front cash for the car? Or are you financing?
Great post. Getting a Model 3 soon and this is immensely helpful!
To predict my cost vs my xtrail I did very similar. 1.5 years I am saving in comparison according to it.
"Was there an expense to enable charging at home? Upgraded breakers, wiring, panel, etc?

Otherwise great write-up."
"Stellar write up, thank you."

Thank you! :)

Good human.
Good bot.
"haha, every day I'm tempted to buy something new for the car. Then I look at how much I've spent already..."
Less than two years until you can vote him out.
"Yes, that was my bad there. I meant deductible."
"I haven't driven much since March as I switched to wfh. Apart from the trip to Saskatoon, I haven't gone anywhere, so not enough data to understand the change. 

The process of getting the glass replaced was... okay. I got a loaner and it took a couple days to replace the glass. However, soundproofing isn't as good anymore (it was never great to begin with). I tried to raise that as an issue, but I was told that it was well within in the Model 3 range."
">Thanks for posting!  Now that rates are 12.7c sustained how much has your charging bill gone up?

I think I can address that. I picked mine up Feb 29 and everything changed within 2 weeks.

For the first couple months I was on off-peak hours. I think it was around June that we went on $.127 per KWH. I track my usage closely and I can say the difference in barely noticeable."
"I love the car and I don't regret the decision. I wish AWD was available when I was trying to get it. I'd have definitely paid the extra money to get it, but RWD has been good in Toronto.

Also, if basic Autopilot was available back then like it it is now, I probably wouldn't get Enhanced Autopilot. Summon is just a party trick most of the time and navigate on autopilot isn't very reliable for me. Lane change is good, but not $6600 good."
"2920!? What’s the future like? Is covid still a thing?

That’s a crazy difference in “fuel” cost even compared to a civic! That really makes me excited to get out of my lease and into a model 3!

As far as the wrap goes, the earlier you do it, the better it is. It takes a lot of work to fix rock chips and remove scratches before applying the film. Best bet is to do it when brand new. I don’t know exactly what OP got, but there’s loads of options when you go to get your front end paint protected. You can get the simple 16” hood-fender-mirror, which is what a lot of people get. From there you can move up to 24” hood-fender-mirror-bumper-headlights-fog lights-grill-pillars-roof. This range is considered partial to full front end

After that you can add full hood and fender, and every body panel after that if you so wish. This is when the film gets expensive to purchase, making the job more expensive."
"I paid upfront. I am planning on keeping it for a long time, so didn't want to take a loan."
I had a friend take care of it and I've been using the Mobile charger at home. That's why I didn't include it.
"Yeah, the rebate ended in 2018. Now we only have a $5000 Federal rebate as far as I know. :("
"*hear, hear. Autocorrect fail?"
FREEDOM BUCKS.
I think this bot eats.
The wraps here in Spain cost so much... everyone is content with having their car all scratched up :(
"Cool. 

I've got a 2014 Honda accord with 237,000kms on it, Looking to get a standard range plus.

I have a 62km commute each way from Hamilton to Niagara and figured the cost savings over 36,000kms I drive every year would make it about the same price as buying a new accord. I'm just paranoid of ""surprises"" 

I didn't think I was super serious about it but I just bought a 50 amp breaker and 50 feet of 6/3nm wire to run a panel in my garage... so I guess I am, lol."
"I love my FSD. It just keeps getting better by degrees. I do 90% of highway driving on AP and about 50% in town and on sideroads. 

Yes Summon is a party trick but when it works as it should, it blows everyone's minds. So cool."
"in 2920 there are no diseases. That's probably because our bodies have been replaced by ""machines."" Elon Musk's neuralink evolved to the point of making bodies obsolete. 
In the current time-space continuum I appreciate your advice on wraps. I really only want to protect the front bumper. That snout will take a lot of scatter shot."
"So $3300 per month over 24 months.Will be interesting to see you revisit each year.

Even at 96 months thats a $900 per month payment.

My 2020 LR AWD was $73K after taxes..."
freedom LOL
Pretty expensive in Toronto as well. A full wrap is $4000-$6000. The guy gave me a discount because I was his first Model 3 and he wanted to use it to promote his business.
"First of all I want to say, I hope nobody buys a Tesla to save money. But the savings on service and ""fuel"" are pretty nice. 
I wouldn't worry about surprises. Unless being constantly amazed is a surprise. 
Sounds like you've already made the decision anyway. You won't regret it."
"Dang, that's a lot less than what I paid. Did you get autopilot?"
"Yeah, I’ll concede it’s tragically ironic at this point."
"Lucky, in NJ (close to NYC) most places charge like double or more just for the front. So like $1200 USD."
"Came with Autopilot but not Enhanced Autopilot.  Summon, autopark etc. They were just offered for $5600 I think..."
"Nice! 

I wish Autopilot came standard like it does now. Not worth paying $6600 for summon and navigate on autopilot."
I remain skeptical.
"Adding a ""heater"" button to Model 3's will help range.  That way, I can increase the A/C temp without the heater kicking in.  The A/C is always ice cold, or the heat kicks in if you go past like 74 set point.  I also want the fan speed to go to 0, so just ambient air comes in, like every other car made.

This is honestly my biggest gripe with my 3.

They could also add fan speed buttons on the bottom tool bar, so one click fan speed adjustment."

Context: We were talking for a while about my specific car (2020 M3P), the new features of the refresh, and my main concern with the range bump.

It’s easy to ask Tesla chat, anyone else want to confirm? I wish Tesla PR (now dissolved though?) or Elon could officially come out and say it too. Maybe during the earnings call on Wed?"
"Wow I would love this but I find it extremely hard to believe. 

The Battery Management System in my 2019 SR+ is saying my range caps out at 100% at 220 miles versus the (then) advertised 240 miles. 

A boost to 263 miles seems impossible without the other hardware improvements that Tesla had put into the new 2021 models.

The 2020 SR+ increased its advertised range to 250 miles (+10 miles vs 2019 model) and there were some rumors back then that older SR+ would get the bump in range too, but that never happened, at least for mine."
"I’m stoked, I literally just picked up my 2020 AWD two  hrs. ago"
Skeptical. But I have a 2020 LR AWD that I picked up in March/April. Would be nice to have this update since the car is not even a year old. If I get news of an update I’ll let you know
[deleted]
I just talked to a rep from Tesla and they confirmed that 2020 model 3 cars will get the range update. That makes me feel better after just picking the car up 2 months ago. I didn't ask if we should get a bump in speed as well. But I did look at the acceleration boost upgrade on my app and it says it will take the long range model 3 0-60 from 4.2 to 3.7. I was under the impression the 2020 long range 0-60 was 4. 4. Maybe they will change that as well.
Did they just keep a bunch of spare mileage in the battery on reserve? It’s hard to believe they can extract more efficiency unless some of the initial code was horribly inefficient to begin with.
"This is what I don't understand. Tesla chat in previous posts have stated that the addition of the heat pump and octovalve are the reason(s) for the range boost and not battery tech.

If that's the case, if I completely turn off cabin climate control, am I not capable of getting the increased range? If not, it must be new battery tech.

2019 LRD"
Tesla support doesn’t know anything. I wouldn’t take their words for much.
I just spoke with someone from the Tesla support chat who told me that there are no plans for the range updates to roll out to my late-2020 Model 3
Sad mid range owner :(
Ya right. I wish I can get the range update on my obsolete 2018 LR RWD
DoubtPressX.jpg
What about the base SR (non +)?
I’ll keep crying myself to bed at night with my 2019 sr+ showing 210 at 100%. Very doubtful of this hitting mine
"As a owner of the, I believe, discontinued Long Range RWD I will expect not to get it and then be presently surprised if I do."
I’m running 2020.40.4 with no range increase. 2020 Sr+ picked up mid September
Can confirm. Got it. Or it seemed like I got more range yesterday.
"A response I got from Tesla chat as an additional data point:

""Got it, right now we have no clear answers as to if the range will be part of our over the air update we cant speculate as of now but once more information is release you will be notified with the new updates."""
This might not be the case in Canada for the “budget” trim
"I have a September 2020 M3 LR AWD and it has the new frunk, but I doubt it has the heat pump. I would gladly pay for Tesla to fit one if I got better winter performance."
Do y'all think this is coming in Version 11?
[deleted]
I’ll believe it when I see it!
Not gonna happen. Tesla chat support knows little to nothing. Never rely on them for data like this.
How?  What can they change with software that will make my car go further than it currently can go?  I've got a brand new 2020 M3P so I certainly wouldn't mind but I don't see what they can do to change what the car currently does (also I know nothing about how this works so I'm probably wrong)
who said this? what's the source?
I think it's Bullshit that you took a screenshot of what Tesla Support Chat had to say. People's livelihoods are on the line when you do that. Try calling them and having a real conversation. It's like recording a conversation without the other person's permission.
"They seem to be talking about a 2020 model.  In the past, Tesla often rolled out changes before publicly announcing them.  I think in this case, the new battery formulation has been in some cars for a while (Weeks? Months?).  If so, then it would make sense that they update the software *in these cars only* at a later point.

It also softens the blow to people who purchased recently.  At the point that this is officially announced, anyone who doesn’t get it will have made their purchase at least several weeks earlier, so it will not seem as though they “just missed it”.

But I agree with you - I have a 2018 with 310 range.  I didn’t get the boost to 322 and I don’t expect to get this boost either."
I remain a pessimistic skeptic.
As do I. I don’t think my ‘18 model has the equipment involved in the efficiency gains.
"Yeah, the fact it's rolling out to all trim models for *new* vehicles doesn't mean it's going to be rolled out to *existing* vehicles.

Plus a chunk of that extra range will be things like the new wheels (lighter more aerodynamic) or new, lighter components I guess.

I can't imagine that my March 2020 (Built in Jan/Feb 2020 I believe) is suddenly going to get a 50 mile range update"
Yeah I live in Texas and I would love to replace the useless seat heater buttons with fan speed.
"if your outside temp is close to your desired temp range, say around 74, I like to turn the A/C off and just activate the fan, it saves power and prevents the heater from coming on, I think.  It does let the moisture in though and you get some condensation inside sometimes"
"Do you use auto climate? I set it to 70-72 + AUTO and have never thought about it, just like a home thermostat."
"That's useful.  Also, a mode that disables AC but keeps all other automatic settings active would be useful for moderate dry heat.

Living in moderate climate with temperatures around 0°C (32°F) with high humidity during most of the winter, I'd also  like a mode that automatically keeps the windscreen fog and frost free with minimal heater and AC use, but does not attempt to heat the car - that's what the heated seats ate for."
"I just use the temperature to change the fan speed. Put it up a couple of degrees and it reduces to fan (in summer) or reverse in winter. I wish there was an 'always sync' button for the temp though.

It's definitely a workaround though as you still have to switch it back when it reaches desired temp."
I love everything about my 3 except for the auto AC feature. It doesn't seem like it does a good job of maintaining airflow/temperature.
This guy drives a Model 3.
"I'm not sure where else to mention this, but my 2020 M3P that I picked up a few weeks ago is now showing a range of 505km (314 Miles) on TeslaFi after the 40.4 update. Before that is was showing 467km (290 Miles)."
"My understanding was the heat pump only helps heating efficiency in cold weather.

Sounds like you are experiencing battery degradation? But it’s only a 2019 model. That seems to be too much of a loss?🤔"
"Yeah, same model (probably) and I cap at 232"
"Dude I’m going to be completely honest with you and suggest you RETURN it. 

Unless you have the updated model or had a price readjustment before receiving it, your car (brand new) was just reduced by ~$1900 according to the inventory stock pricing for “new” vehicles."
"I agree this is how I was feeling. I just updated and my range is showing the same as it was before... so not sure if it’s real or if it needs time to “calibrate” or something? I don’t know... I’m new to this, but really hope to get the increased range."
"I posted this above. My M3P range has already been reflected in the car.

> I'm not sure where else to mention this, but my 2020 M3P that I picked up a few weeks ago is now showing a range of 505km (314 Miles) on TeslaFi after the 40.4 update. Before that is was showing 467km (290 Miles)."
"Same 2 months age, my biggest concern on the update was the range, all else is ok"
"Yeah I wonder if those of us with the 2020 M3P will get that 3.1s 0-60 bump.  I honestly feel like they were already capable of that (or quicker).

Curious what changes were made to the refresh 2020 M3P for them to give them that speed bump."
Did they say when and what software version? I have the latest installed but haven't seen a range increase..
"Several ""drove my tesla till empty"" videos I've seen show the car having a bit extra range left in it after it hits 0%.  The car's not happy with you but it still moves.

I think it was CarWow that drove several EV's until they died and the Tesla went like an extra 20 miles or something like that.

If that's the case (that they're simply showing you what the battery ACTUALLY has left in it) I'd kinda prefer that extra buffer of a few more miles when at 0% vs the car literally being empty when it hits 0%."
"Yeah, I would love to know this as well. 

What causes the extra range?"
"That seems hard to believe, I frequently don’t use climate or seat heater and there’s no way I’m getting that range lol"
I talked to Tesla chat as well. The customer support guy talked to the IT department and was told we would get the update. I guess we are all getting mixed messages.
MR here as well ... My max has been reduced to 240.  Is that worse than you guys?
"Based on anecdotal accounts, I feel like those of us with MR somehow got screwed on battery degradation. 

I thought my 250 was poor and I’m a little anal about keeping the battery in optimal state."
Same here + 10% range loss.
"Obsolete? Our 18s, mine is also LR RWD, are better than anything that’s come out since. I have the frunk bag clips, I have home link, etc, of things they started taking away in 19 and 20. A few extra miles doesn’t matter to me and I use my car, I picked mine up in Nov 18 and I have 57K miles and still love driving it everyday."
"Don't think of it as ""obsolete"". Think of it as a ""collector's item""!"
"Who needs all that extra range or performance boosts when we get lifetime premium connectivity, homelink and the special roof tinting!"
I would love to get a performance boost for LR Rwd
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/876/044/065.gif
Yeh mine gives the same when i calculate theoretical range from the display energy/distance toggle. However on long road trips i am getting average efficiency in the 210 to 220 kwh/mile range at about 10 celcius which is very close to the 206 kwh/mile to get a 240 mile range. During the summer i was getting 200 to 210 kwh/mile on long trips at 60-70mph on autopilot. Think the calculation for range in distance is just a bit weird as i can easily get the stated range at highway speeds.
[No mention of increased efficiency for Long Range RWD in 40.8](https://imgur.com/a/9kpzS8o/)
Firmware 40.4?
Strange. I’m on 2020.40.4 and see no range increase. 1 month old performance.
It's not that hard to check if you really want to know.
Took delivery last month (9/2020 M3P) and there is definitely no heat pump (got a good look under the frunk when my homelink was installed).
I’m so confused by your comment who’s livelihood is on the line over a 30ish mile update? You need to relax
That’s why I mask the support’s name🤔
Same. My 2019 SR+ (max 240 miles) didn't get the rumored +10 miles range bump that the 2020 SR+ (max 250 miles) got.
"I have a 2020 picked up less than a month ago, but I'm still preparing for getting none of the updates in the new model. If there is any range or performance bump then that will be a bonus, and slightly soften the blow of missing out on power trunk and heat pump. Not bothered about aesthetic upgrades especially since I have a white which is the best looking with chrome and worst paired with black delete in my opinion."
Same here.
"Mine either. But now sometime I am able to charge to 315.
Same year mdoel as yours. 


Maybe it's because we have range loss already, so adding it up to 322, actually is only mitigating the range loss we have experience on our two year old model ?"
My 2020 picked up after they'd announced 322 but ordered before never got the 322 update.  I'm skeptical that it actually exists.
I also have a 2018 (RWD) with 310 and did not get the update to 322 or 325. I assumed it was because it was RWD. Don’t expect it this time either
I have the 2018 also. I got an update and did not get more range. My range is down to 286 when fully charged when it used to be 310.
I have a 2020 that never showed 322 so you aren't missing much.
Damn.  I was hoping for an over-the-air heat pump upgrade!
"Texas here too.  But, actually the seat heater buttons are nice for part of the year, when I don't want to use cabin heat.  But I still think there's enough room to have fan speed on there too."
GA checking in with a yes vote
Switzerland here - seat heater buttons are nice.
"Alabama here.  I use heated seats maybe 2 or 3 months of the year.

Maybe they should just look at the temperature outside and **change it dynamically** 💡

Is it below a certain temp (that maybe we could specify)?  Show the heated seats button.  Is it above that temp?  Fan speed it is."
"I still do that on a lot larger temperature deltas. I'll run the fan-only down to just below freezing. When you start out boost with the seat (do wish I had a heated steering wheel) for a couple minutes and then off. On extended drives a single body can easily keep cabin temp high enough in the face of Fan speed 1, on the windshield only to keep it from fogging/frosting."
"Doesn't work for me.  I want less cold air, but not slower air speed.  Can't get that with auto.  It will also switch to the bottom vents if you go too high on the temp setting."
"Well, that does really already exist in that you can turn off the A/C with the A/C button, and then you just have ambient air coming in, unless you set the temp too high, of course.  I do turn off the A/C when I can, when it's cool enough.  But the heater turning on when I don't want it to is very frustrating."
"Yeah, it pretty much blows.  Ba dum tss!"
Is there a way to check max range without a TeslaFi subscription? Just got my model 3 a couple weeks ago and still learning the ins and outs.. I did receive the software update.
Interesting. My 2020 M3P showed 310 when I bought it.  That week a software update came out and it showed 284 at 100% SOC.  Tesla said that’s correct don’t bother with the miles range use %.  LOL. hasn’t changed since will have to check now that I have 40.4
Yep 14 day old P3D+ showing 500km on 40.4 at 100% here. Tbh never even checked what it was before
"It’s more likely my BMS just needs to be calibrated. I typically only use 10% daily and charge daily. But still, didn’t get any bumps."
"No I have the same ""problem"". The first 1-2 weeks of ownership my range was ""up there"", like 230+ but I haven't seen those numbers since. I think 100© gives me like 218 max. Not sure why I got the SR+ if I can't even get advertised range.

Driving habits blah blah blah.  There are some interesting things with this car that kind of irk me. My GF's 75D X gets better range than I do."
">Tech

I looked for that pricing within 200 miles of my zip code & couldn't find anything. What zip did you use? Do you have a screen shot you can send?"
Tesla got rid of the 7-day refund policy this week.
Can’t buy same model if you return it.
20 miles is 32.19 km
I would assume it’s similar to a patch that causes a game to work smoother or faster. Reprogramming how the energy is used could give them extra range to squeak out. Purely speculation however
I think in an organization as large as Tesla it’ll be hard to pin a source of truth down. Support is probably 2-3 degrees away from the truth holder (team) in the organization that can report factually what the situation is.
"About same for me, which I’m fine with.  I just don’t want to be forgotten if there are simple OTA opportunities for us too."
Mine at 232 right now. But I haven’t tried the recalibration thing... has any of you tried that?
Come on Elon!   Help a MR brother out!
Not to mention they are still the longest range Model 3/Y out there.  Even with the new 353 EPA rating I seriously wonder if they will beat the Model 3 LR RW real world?  I think at best it would tie.  I wish they would start selling them again.  Everyone I've talked to that is looking at Tesla pretty much is forced to bump up to the AWD.  Many can't justify that big of a jump or the extra speed is too much for them and they go buy a BMW or something.
Aye. A “unicorn” as it were!
Just checked my app...it is 2020.40.4
Mine is 2 and a half years old...so maybe im just tripping. I don't always charge at 100% but i did the other night and saw it had 312 mile...havent seen that in a long time.
Do you have the updated “smaller” frunk?
My 2018 LR AWD didn’t get the 322 from 310 either
"My 2019 SR (220 miles) never got any of the rumored “all trims” range boosts either. I’m 1000% sure I won’t get this one.  

It’s sad, because it’s well-known that my car has extra unused battery capacity. But that’s sort of the point, and Tesla has no intention of ever rewarding a lowlife like me who spent less money and bought the standard model."
I have a 2020 SR+ and never get 250 either. Max 230-240. I only charge to 80% too to prevent that issue.
Nor did mine. June build 2019.
"You get to keep the nicer classic center console though, so there's that."
"I bought 1 month ago too...

We did already get faster as far as I can tell.

In Canada... we had the option to boost from 4.7 to 4.2 to 100KM for $2700

Now the option is 4.4 to 3.9"
"I think I am in the same boat, I picked up 8 days ago with a 9/20 Build date

&#x200B;

If I get something- that would be cool, but no deal-breaker for me."
"You likely have 320 range and can only charge to 315 due to degradation. Mine is older and has more degradation - I get to about 290 (although some of that is just BMS inaccuracy. At any rate, I am below 300."
"Your actual is probably between 290 and 300, the rest “missing” not due to any real degradation but inaccuracy in how the BMS calculates your range.

This is a very good article on how the BMS works and why your displayed range is low:  https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/how-i-recovered-half-of-my-batterys-lost-capacity.204712/

I started doing some of what he described in the article and have seen my top range go from 283 to 291 (and still climbing).  Keep in mind, this is just what BMS is calculating, not your actual range, so I am not actually getting back anything, just trying to make the estimate more accurate.  No real reason to do this, but I am a numbers and tech geek, so why not?"
"yeah mine shows 290mi @ 100% charge.  Driving 70mph avg on the interstate back and fourth, according to TeslaFi, shows me 265~270 real world miles on a full charge if I stay around 70mph and keep the wh/mi around 280~ish."
The dock should be user customizable.
I'm with you on this.  It's a solvable problem by making the auto setting more complex.  I think you could do it in a way that wasn't a complete mess so maybe they will one day.
"No, I do want the fans running at automatically regulated speed, and I do want automatic air distribution and recirculation, just with the compressor disabled. Like every VW/Audi climate control I used in the past umphteen years had."
"I think if you have your display settings set to miles instead of %, then your app will show you the EPA miles when you set it to different levels."
"Assuming it's the same data, you don't need Teslafi at all: Go into charging on your Tesla app, drag the little arrow to the right, and it should tell you the max range on the left"
Unsure. I'm still just using the trial.
"You get a month free. After that, it's only 5 bucks. Well worth it for me.  I can skip a Starbucks for all that juicy data."
"312 when I got my M3P in March. Now shows 300 at 100% SoC, and has bounced between those two figures a couple of times after various updates"
yeah never use mile range.  It's useless and always changing.
"The range assumes 230wh/mi. If you are above, then your range will be less."
"[Updated “new” 2020 Model 3 LR pricing ](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZrS2vG8)

This configuration (last month) was $55,990"
You can buy a different color. I’m sure a significant majority of Model 3 owners would be willing to pay $1k for a heat pump.
"ha, that would be awesome! I would be happy to see it, I am new to Tesla (8 day in so far) but updates are always welcomed!"
Lol unicorn!
"2020 LR, smaller frunk on mine it looks like 9/20 build date"
"I have the beaded basin, yes."
"Neither did my 2019. It's usually in the high-270s/low-280s if I check the potential at 100% charge, though that's due to the battery reading being out of calibration, not an actual loss of range. Actual max range after re-calibration is 300 (down from 310), which makes perfect sense given over 1 year and ~22k miles."
I got mine LR Model 3 in December 2018 and my range drop to 290 from 320 😭
That's odd. Have a 2018 rwd LR (one of the earliest delivered in my area) and it got the boost.
Yeah - that was only for 2020 models.......... You're thinking about 2018 LR RWD models that were upgraded to 325 early on.
My SR+ after 17k miles now reads 220 at 100%. Has your range lowered at all? Maybe we have the same battery range after all lol?
"I have a 2019 SR as well and it’s pathetic. In the past few days mine is now at 198 when it was 207. Maybe that’s temperature or maybe it’s miscalculation, but my 2014 S 85 I had before was 258 out of 265 after 70k miles. Losing 10% after a year is not good especially given how it’s not even using the full battery capacity. This has to just be a situation where it never calculates it right because of the software locking the range. Even lithium batteries that are charged to 100% everyday (like my phone) don’t degrade this much."
Yes I’m not stressing it. I charge at home and it’s plenty.
Agreed!
"True, it would be nice to have auto without the compressor or heater turning on."
Thanks. Mine is still reading 322 miles with the latest software update..
"Who the hell is managing 230 Wh/mi? Maybe if I was permanently in slow traffic at 20c exterior temperature

My 3000 mile average is 310 Wh/mi, and that's UK summer so I expect it to get a little worse over winter. I can be a touch heavy with my right foot sometimes (It's a M3P, so I'm not gonna drive like a granny), but most of the time I'm being pretty sensible."
"Mmm yea I got it for $46,990."
"If they are happy with it and want to keep it, the price difference is irrelevant.  I got mine the day before they removed the 7 day return and it’s in my contract so I can return until Wednesday of this week but I don’t like the new interior and have no use for the heat pump living in the south.  

The price is only good if you’re trying to sell the car, if he plans on keeping it for several years or more then the $1900 difference in book value right now is completely irrelevant."
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/tesla-return-refund-policy-seven-days/

Axed that before the refresh."
Oof. All the cons of the refresh without any of the pros. I’m in the same boat 😂
"Oh wow

I’m at 22k miles at 2 years and my battery shows 289 fully charged 

Interesting stats 

I just keep it in percentage honestly"
How do you do the battery recalibration
"How do you recalibrate? I read mixed things online but since you actually go from 280 to 300, your method is working. I’m at 296 at about 11k miles."
Is the range estimate based on your personal driving efficiency? Or just the EPA test numbers and battery capacity?
"It lowered pretty fast right off the bat, and now is around 205 at 10k miles. It’s never gone up. Unfortunately, I’m afraid it was a misconception (of mine, and the salesman, and plenty of people online) that the SR might be “software limited to 220” in the sense that it uses all battery cells, but simply turns off charging when it hits 220 (thus, it would experience less degradation since the battery essentially never is maxed out). In actuality, the nature of the software limitation is to fully deactivate some battery cells, so my SR started showing signs of degradation from day 1."
ouch! 231 @ 100% for my SR+. 33k miles
"Well for me, part of the problem was that I DID charge to 100 each day for the first month or so... because I was told 100% on the meter was really 90% at the cells. I no longer believe that to be true though, so I was doing damage the whole time."
322 miles is 518.21 km
"322 mile is equivalent to the combined length of 1727.4 Eiffel Towers

"Why did someone downvote you?!!! Ugh. People, downvotes aren’t for facts you aren’t happy about. This is irritating. 

Happened to me. Someone asks “did elon say something” and you post a link to the tweet... 💥downvote."
"Same, but I like to check on it periodically.

Your ""289"" might be more lack of calibration than actual lost range."
Providing another data point: My 2018 LR RWD has 25k miles and my battery also shows 289 at full charge. 18” Aeros with covers off
"Going off of memory from prior Tesla advice:

* Run battery down to ~20%.
* Park, let sit unplugged for at least 2 hours.
* Plug in, charge to 90%.
* When charged, unplug and let sit for at least 2 hours. (though this last step, unplugging, seems unnecessary in my experience)

Wil have to repeat multiple times in a row, depending on how bad the calibration is.

NOTE: This has zero impact on actual range. It just makes then battery meter more accurate."
https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/je5dvh/some_good_news_for_model_3_owners_we_will_be/g9dhe68/
"The latter. And when the calibration gets off, the numbers are off."
Well I just picked it up today... so I'll email my Tesla Advisor and see about getting a credit or (or should I use it towards the acceleration boost LOL) ?
"I check miles every time I charge to 100% (\~once per month). 2018 LR RWD, 40,000 miles: My last four checks were 306, 314, 314, 299. 306 being the most recent."
"I take road trips often so I go from 10% to 95% pretty often. But I also only urban charge/supercharge the last year with sentry mode on 24/7

The first year I was all 110v charging in a garage with no sentry mode and I have like 5 miles degradation"
Is there a way we can calibrate on our own? Mine is 2 years and shows similar. 285 last I checked
"Well that's weird.  My 2018 LR RWD (VIN: 547x) has ~29k miles, 18"" aeros off,  and my battery reads 318 at 100%.

https://old.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/j0mkgm/33_months_and_28k_miles_and_21_range_loss/"
"I’ve read to do a true recalibration it needs to go down below 5%, which nakes sense."
That makes me feel better. I’m paranoid about overusing super chargers and going past 90%
5 miles is 8.05 km
That’s awesome! I have a 2018 LR AWD and the highest it’s ever been is 301. It’s now 280 at 100% (24k miles).
"I just leave it in percent and let it do it’s thing really haha

I don’t see any issues using only super charging. I only use the 250 KW ones whenever I canb"
good bot
It hurts to see other people living out your dreams. Congrats tho!
How does the y feel compared to the 3 both in terms of comfort and performance?
We will be getting there soon! Just waiting for the RWD Y. Congrats!
I recognize the hotel!! Hayes Mansion San Jose?
Congrats on the new rides! That looks a lot like Hayes Mansion in San Jose. Such a nice backdrop for the cars regardless.
Congrats!  Wife and I both switched to Model 3's in Oct 2018.  Haven't missed gasoline at all.  Switched to battery lawn mower as well.
Yay!
We have the same. Living the T life.
"my gf wont ever get a tesla, unless i just outright buy it. i doubt she would even truly want it. jealous that my dads household just switched entirely to two 3s and one Y."
"Coincidentally I just traded in my Tesla model 3 for a Volvo. 
I loved the Tesla but the build quality wasn’t really up to par to what I’m used to from other cars in the price range. 

Door rattles when driving over some road surfaces, tail light started fogging after 9k miles, paint issues on the drivers side door panel, and annoying door rattling when music with bass is playing. 
Mind you I had the SR+ which, was 42k out-the-door, and it didn’t come with floormats, foglights or footwell lights, which is just ... mind blowing for a $40,000 dollar car. I’ll buy Tesla again in 4-5 years when they include more mileage for the price and work out the kinks. 

Congrats on the model y tho! It’s a beauty"
"I still go to my local gas station.... just to use their touchless car wash, and maybe grab a soda/coffee while I'm inside buying a code."
It should be my brand new model y and my husband's 6 month old model 3. ;)
So jealous
Are you white
"Naw, just more motivation. After wanting one for over 6 years I was finally able to get my SR+ this past June. Have a plan and just keep working towards the goal."
"Honestly they’re pretty similar. The height at which you sit is the biggest/most noticeable difference, though the acceleration and range differences also pop up depending on the circumstances."
Yup!
"You’re right, Hayes Mansion!"
Thanks for your honest opinion
"I had the speaker rattle.  Tesla ranger came to my garage and replaced the broken clip in about 10 minutes.  I bet they would have done the same for a foggy brake light.  Not a deal breaker, to say the least.  To each his own, I guess.  Enjoy you gas stations and oil changes!"
"Ha! We just pulled the trigger and did the same thing except have had the M3 for 2 years, same colors. For those that don’t have one yet don’t worry, your time will come for sure!"
Are you racist?
You might want to get your screen fixed if you can't tell that the Model Y is white
Does it matter?
"I had wanted a Tesla Since 2012, Work and hustle and sacrifice got me to my Model 3, Dual Motor, with Full Self Drive, back on Earth Day, 2019.  Figured that was the best day to pick up my car.

Thinking of working a trade-in on a CyberTruck....  


  
Nice Call on the Blue.... It is truly the Best of the Model3 Colors."
How does the sitting compare? Is there more room above your head?
"Tesla told me the condensation is normal and will dissipate which isn’t something I want in a near 45k car. My 2002 jeep doesn’t even condensate. Either way, I have 5 years of free oil changes and the car I have is only 30 bucks to fill up and drives 390 miles city/480 miles highway. Similar to Tesla. 
According to Tesla it costs 16 dollars to fully Charge the SR+ at a supercharger which is 250 miles (which, I never got. I usually get 190 on a full charge). So 17 bucks for 190 miles. So basically on a road trip, my gas car not only gets to point B faster, but also costs the same. 
In the city tho, charging at home - yea for sure the Tesla is champ 😎"
"Bold of you to assume I was talking about race; you must be racist if that’s your first thought.

I was asking if OP is team white or team blue."
I can tell but was just wondering which was OP’s preference.
No but I’m curious
"In the front seat it’s not very noticeable to me (I’m 6’1”), but you can definitely tell in the back"
"$30 for 390 miles!  Ha, you definitely don't live in California.   Bummer about the brake light, tho.  I can't imagine that happening at my SC, but I really haven't been there enough to know for sure.  One thing I will say is that my M3 is going to need new tires a lot sooner than any car I've ever bought.  Other than that, there is no comparison.  I've never spent less time maintaining/repairing a car.  Wrt paint, Giga Berlin is likely to make some breakthroughs, so maybe you'll be back sooner than you think."
"Jesus. I apologize! As well as for the other 19 people who downvoted you.  No im not racist, these are just crazy times and I took your comment to mean someone with 2 Teslas in a nice area (by the background) couldn't be a person of another race. 

You're right it was narrow minded of me to instantly jump to that conclusion. I feel a little awful for the way my brain is programmed. ""Are you white"" could clearly mean which car is yours."
Mine is the blue 3. Just came off off 2 white cars in a row and I needed some color in my life.
Hahah nope! Not in Cali! And yeah omg my m3 ate tires like no business. It’s almost unreal how quick they run through them - it’s all that torque.  Let’s see how Tesla does on QC in a couple years and then I’ll see about going back
Black interior?
Yup. Husband’s is the white and black
"Had a model 3 as a loaner, was a LR RWD. This was at the end of July."
Service loaner fleet?  I wish!  Uber credit from and to service center is all I get.
[deleted]
Team blue!
The only loaners here in Iceland are white model 3 LR
"All loaners are limited to chill mode, dropped my P3D off recently for the day in Vaughan, Ontario and got a Model S P100D couldn’t help but feel like it was a joke that it was permanently locked to chill..."
"Can confirm this. I had the control arm squeak and they gave me a TM3 AWD with chrome delete with FSD and with VIN in the 600,000s. I was told he traded it in for a Model Y. It was kind of cool seeing the stoplights with HW 3.0. This was about 3 weeks ago."
I am riding in one right now while our Model 3 gets the the FSD computer upgrade.
Thought they only provided Uber credits?
Omg you’re so lucky. My loaner (p85 model S) when my was getting repaired was terrible. The whole interior was dirty. Shoe scuffs and a little bit of mud on the mats. There were leaves inside. The outside was terrible too. Not washed in weeks. There was dents and scuff marks and scrapes on every panel and every side of the car
"Had a White Model 3 VIN 86 as a loaner back in July.  Tesla put a matte wrap on it, and heavily tinted the windows.

"I wouldn’t accept it, I would never accept a temporary use Tesla for any reason. Because I know that once I drive it once I’ll never want to give it up."
now we're talking !
It’s about time! But will they supercharge for free like the ratty 5-6yr old S60-85 loaners we usually get?
::Cries in Uber credits::
"My SC in West Palm Beach, Florida, they give you a Tesla Model S loaner that has way more service issues with it than your Model S you dropped off to them.  My latest had wipers that didnt work, and a bubbling, yellowing screen, reminding me what will likely happen to my 2014 Model S before too long.  Sad.  They also do Uber credits when they run out of there beat up, worn out, unserviced loaners..  Even sadder.   
I clearly remember Elon Musk stating publicly that they were going to fix that problem, it shouldnt be happening, and that they were going to use newer P100D Model S and P100D Model Xs in order to up sell current Tesla owners. This was over a year ago.

What happened that plan, Mr. Musk??"
"A picture and a headline with no context is worthy of a post?

Edit: What I was getting at (albeit clumsily) was if there was a bigger picture here. Like, does OP have information about whether this is now everywhere for example. Without the context that OP has now provided, we had no way of knowing."
Oh nice! This ones kinda a unicorn. It’s a Mid Range rwd.
"Yeah, I got one in August at the Oakville service centre."
Too bad my SC stopped doing loaners and now just does Uber credits. :sad:
"Hold up. The uber credit can only be used for rides from/to the service center?!

I’m taking my car into the Littleton SC within the next week. That’s pretty upsetting if I can’t use the credit for personal errands."
What area are you in? I’ve read from other posts that loaners are fairly spotty.
I usually get Uber credits but if your car is in the shop for more than two days they can then try their best to find a loaner. My car was in the shop for a paint issue for a week and they provided me an older model S. That model S got me hooked on passive entry with the FoB that I just bought one for the 3. Total game changer for me. Also the phone never really worked for me unless I physically pressed buttons to open.
Same here. The S I had before killed my back because of the way the headrest came out. I was actually kind of dreading having to get an S for a loaner again.
"Me too!! I took my 3 in for some maintenance and they  gave me an S as a loaner and it was not as intuitive as I thought it would be. I was excited to try out a different Tesla model, but was quite underwhelmed. Also had to pull over because I couldn’t for the life of me figure out how to adjust my mirrors. Ended up having to look it up."
That’s pretty cool!
Seriously! That’s stupid.
Wow seriously!? Haha yeah my loaner is 2.5 and I relied a bit heavily on the stoplights in 3.0 (6’7” tall so the lights sometimes get blocked by the headliner).
Nice! You’ll really like HW3
They were able to do that at my house via mobile service. Took a bit over an hour.
Good fucking luck to them giving me enough Uber credits to get home from the SC and then back to pick my car up. That’s gotta be about £500 worth of Uber’s!
They do only if they are out of loaners.
Depends on the location and how busy they are. The one time I had to take mine in for service (February this year) they were providing Enterprise rental cars.
I didn’t know they did that haha. The ones around me have loaners thankfully.
Oh jeez that’s not good!
... don’t test drive one then... fell into that trap after one drive. I’m now the proud owner of a Blue M3 LR.
Happy Cake Day!
I think he found that it was economically unviable. However as more 3s return they’ll replace the aging S’s on loaner duty.
"The headline basically is the context? My M3 is in the shop, last time they only had model S’s for loaners. I didn’t know they had 3s as loaners until today when the rep handed me a keycard."
"Ok that makes more sense. Loaners are still spotty in the US, but my SC only had Model S’s as loaners when I was last in a few months ago. From past readings I knew SCs were originally supposed to only get S’s and maybe the X as loaner vehicles so when I was handed the keycard I was genuinely surprised to see a 3 in the loaner fleet. 

For location reference I’m in CO."
[deleted]
"Don’t accept this. Insist on a loaner even if you have to reschedule. Make it known on surveys,"
"They can be used for anything, but don't include a tip."
New Orleans.
Not OP but I've been to the SC in Dublin and Fremont (down the street from the factory) and no loaner for me. Just Uber credit when they expected the repair to take all day.
I had a S loaner and couldnt wait to get back on my 3
"Yep, the advisor told me people were crashing the cars and driving recklessly prior. I would atleast have like to see the standard or “sport” acceleration. Would have been okay without ludicrous but with chill mode in a model S. 0-100 in 2 business days was difficult adjusting from the p3d"
Can’t remember how many miles but the person must have really liked the Y cause it didn’t seem that old!
I should have mentioned that I also needed a new windshield due to a rock impact. Killing two birds with one stone :)
They gave me 500 bucks of credit once so don’t be surprised
"We tried to tab up once how much Uber credit I would need to get me through a week. (~$1,600) — and that’s if I can even pick one up on the other end.

Ever since then a phone call is all it takes to get a loaner served up."
Last time I turned my car in they gave me $800 in Uber credits. Definitely made use of Uber Black for a few days.
Yep:/
I won’t be able to afford one for another 10 years. Life sucks knowing that you’re gonna live paycheck to paycheck.
"Now *that* is cool to know! I'm one state over and last time there were no loaners at all. It was Uber credits or a shitty rental for choices. Hopefully this is widely implemented and will result in more availability. 

And sorry about the harsh, no excuse really."
There are dozens of us!
Haha nice!
"Tried it, no dice. But I do let them know on every survey that I don't consider Uber to be a safe alternative. So thankful my Model 3 almost never needs service."
I wonder if they have loaners where they are more popular... like in CO Tesla’s are basically everywhere (and I think may be in the top 5 states for deliveries?). Idk just a thought.
"I found the weirdest part of an S loaner to be the windshield/visor. The visibility is like driving a normal car with the sun visor fully down, even when it’s up, the top of the windshield starts so low. Very odd. 

That said, I still liked it more than my 3. I really liked the quieter ride and better speakers."
Even from a regular 3 LR or S LR... sub 4.5 seconds to two century’s is not fun. chill is good for carrying your grandparents but not on a daily basis.
Haha sounds like it. Mine rn is a 19 with 6k miles.
Uber black!!! Love to ride in style. (non Covid times)
"That still might legitimately be cheaper than buying and maintaining a fleet of high end S loaners. The last one I got was a P90D that retailed for well over 6 figures. Less so nowadays with the prices falling, but 3-5 years ago those S’s were EXPENSIVE."
Always time to change ur future careers! Never too late!
I'm from the other side of the country (Atlanta) and we also had S's only in the loaners. It's great to know 3's are/can be available.
It’s fine haha. I hope it does too as they are still not easy to get.
If you can just schedule mobile service.   The mobile guys in my area are much better than the SC.  I always request mobile when possible.
"I've been to the SC in Dublin and Fremont (down the street from the factory) and no loaner for me. Just Uber credit when they expected the repair to take all day. Surrounded by a 1000 Teslas in Fremont but not one to spare, I suppose."
That makes sense. I see more Teslas every day but they are not everywhere down here like they are in CA and CO. We still don’t have a super charger.  Kind of a scary thought considering the hurricane scares we had this year.
"It appears to be tied to how many cars have been traded in to Tesla at that SC. 

I know my SC told me once that they used to have a lot of model S in their loaners because some people traded them for model 3s when they came out."
"My SC is in Northern California, where I can't go 4 blocks without seeing another Tesla. They just stopped doing loaners a few months ago and now just do the Uber credits."
I agree with the visor set up and quietness. I’m surprised about the speakers tho. What speaker set up do you have in your 3? The premium audio in the 3 knocks the S off the podium for my ears. But all ears hear differently.
I’m gonna start working as a CNA soon hopefully
"Believe me, I always opt for mobile when possible. Mobile doesn't do everything though."
I feels there’s some sort of irony there.
Are there any plans for a super charger over there? I agree that’s kinda unnerving.
Interesting! It makes sense. I’m kind of guessing that a majority of the ex lease 3s will become loaners. They’ll have a bunch coming back in the next few years and it’d be really easy to turn them into loaners
There is only a service center here not a sales lot. No sales inventory here.
"That’s not good. I get the appeal of Uber credits, but nothing beats a loaner."
"I have a partial premium interior, so I’m lacking several speakers and have no sub. :/

The S has the combo of quieter ride AND better speakers though. So even if the 3 premium has great speakers, I’d still be skeptical of how good they sound on the freeway with all that road noise."
"Keeping going, LPN is a huge jump in pay, RN just a little longer and even more."
You are in the right path there. Hope it all works out for you!
We were supposed to get one this year.  Not any update on it. Not even under construction.
"Exactly. If you think about it, some of the early 2017-18 model 3 leases should be coming due right about now."
Garbage. Make it known on the reviews.
"Ahhh gotcha. I deduced that the audio set up in an S is the HK set up in the older gen MB models. I’ve driven quite a few of the HK set ups that have a similar  audio profile. While great systems they aren’t the best. 

The 3 is a lot (underline and bold) louder than the S but you can still hear a difference. That’s only at higher volumes though. Below a certain volume level they both sound about even to each-other at hwy speeds, but with some sound proofing the 3 would be quite a bit better. Especially considering the audio set up was specifically designed for the 3 by ex B&O engineers."
That sucks!
Hard to believe the 3 has been out for 3 years honestly. Still feels like a car from the year 2030.
Compared to the competition it is.
And I still have none ☹️
"What is this, A CAR FOR ANTS!"

I have a collection myself. Unfortunately they all fit on a small shelf.
"I keep waiting for my wife to pick me up one of these. I'm wearing her down to get a Y or 3
With my birthday coming up I'm expecting to get a tesla matchbox car as a gift ☹️"
What is this?! A model 3 for ants?! It should be at least 2-3x bigger.
it'll turn into a real one like the ant-man movie right?...

did they used to give away one of the die cast ones with new cars?
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR EXCUSES! The car needs to be at least ... ... ... 3 times bigger than this!
Ah gotcha! I am currently waiting for them to release a black version was hoping this was it!!!!
I just bought a “black” one to match my black Tesla on eBay only to have a silver arrive 🙃
Thanks brother!!!
I think they used to for some reason we had one when we picked up our vehicle

Brembo put out an official statement a while ago presenting the dangers of caliper covers.. I just think they’re tacky.
Came here to say this. You dropped how much money on those wheels and then covered your nice calipers with cheap covers??? Would be better off just painting your own. Would look way way better

?
100% believable
"Yeah, I just don’t get it. It’s solely a color thing because the shape isn’t there, they’re never cover the entire caliper, and they always just look wonky. Powder coating is only a couple hundred, painting even less."
I agree it is not my car there were many of them at the event and it was my first time shooting a Tesla.
"Very few, if any, manufacturers paint calipers in this price range stock. It’s almost always an up charge option (which would be fine) or a cool differentiator between models, like in this case. When you get above this price range and start talking Porsche’s and shit you’ll get pretty caliper paint stock lol."
Sweet 🙌🏼
"No no not like that.

The love shines through!
"When you post on reddit, it compresses or lowers the picture quality. I want to set one of these as my background so I was asking if you can send me the full high quality pictures with a link thru Google drive or sum"

"Wait a second, are you saying the Calipers are not painted now?  They totally look like they are painted with the letters ""tesla"" on them..."
That would be a dream come true. I wonder if there are any Tesla dealerships in NY.

"Is your car ceramic coated? If so, which brand?"
"The model 3 has been around for 2 years now? Still, every time I see one I hear my neck crack. The car design is really nice."
Somebody forgot to bring their tape measure to work that day.

No coating yet but it’s on the wishlist. I did wash it yesterday so that probably helped.
"Well, just crossed two months of ownership and this happened tonight. Deer just strolled out onto the highway. Hit it at about 72 MPH. The model 3 took it like a champ. The  deer did not even leave his information before leaving. I got the whole thing on the dash cam. Looked like maybe an 8 point buck if I had to guess?"
How about Ctrl + Z

F. I got rear ended after 2 months. It all works out in the end. Just be sure to submit claim through the insurance  and app. I highly suggest following  up with your adjustor prior to bringing ti to tesla because they can be awfully slow at repair. Mine was delayed for almost a month because my adjustor needed to view it before it got to telsa
Damn dude. What the hell happened?
Was AP active? I wonder if it would have stopped the car faster.
"F. 

Pour one out."

D'oh! A deer!
"I hit a deer going about 55 last night in my 2019 Jetta, and your model 3 looks a lot better than my car sir!"

Good job 3. We’ll get you back on the road and fixed up in no time (3 months thanks to Tesla service centers)"
I’m sure that guy with a bmw got his answer about avoiding a deer going 75mph lol
Any videos?
But now you get a 2021 Model 3 performance 🙌🏻
Hope she makes a full recovery <3
Is it totaled?
Glad you good
"This happened to me in March, out of the blue in the dark.

M3 was reborn."
"This exact thing happened to me but at 78mph.
Got an appointment to be fixed, while waiting hit another deer and it just worsened the existing damage. 
Once it got fixed it can’t even tell. Looks brand. Hang in there OP"
Better than my daughters car after spinning out on the track. You are actually quite lucky and that will buff out... with a new bumper.

Hitting a deer is my biggest paranoia when driving. Not that electric vehicles are completely silent but they’re definitely not as obvious when driving around and animals have less of a warning that I’m coming.

"Why would he take it to Tesla? They have like 2 places in the country that do body work, one of which is in Freemont. If he's near there then fair enough but he's more then likely not taking it to Tesla but an authorized body shop"
What happened during that month? Do they hook you up with a loaner?
"Added my comment. Short version, Deer meet car on highway."
"AP was active. The Tesla did alert and give the ""beep beep beep"" warning, but it just wasn't enough time. It was at night and raining, visibility wasn't amazing, and I just didn't expect a deer to be taking a leisurely stroll on the highway."
A female deer
Sorry to hear about your jetta. I think the deer I hit was pretty young. It didn't seem very large in the video.
"Thank you. The model 3 took the hit and kept rolling. Could have been worse, but I'm glad I was driving a Tesla when it happened. Love this car."
"I sent that deer flying like a bird, does that count?


Looks like I'm taking my girlfriend's Kona EV....I am not looking forward to using dino juice again."
"For me it was 4 weeks, during the pandemic."
I did have the dash cam active. I'll upload when I download it from the SSD.
😂 I wish that's how it worked. I'm totally happy with this one. Just out winter tires and wheels on it too. Hopefully it's just fixable and looks as good as new when it's all done.
"I don't think so, but I haven't been to a service center to get an estimate. We'll see how it goes."
"Sorry that happened to you. That's great to hear though, I'm glad it got fixed and repaired well. Do you mind me asking how long it took?"
"Thanks for the positive vibes. I know it'll be just fine, I'm just gonna miss the car for a while."
Do you need special insurance for a track accident? I'm gonna assume regular insurance wouldn't be too happy about that type of claim.
"I don't know how much difference it would have made. The thing is just walking, not even running, on the highway. It was like it's never seen a car ever, which may be possible. It was not a big animal, may be young."
Tesla really hit it with a quickscope there.
"Thanks. I'm optimistic. There are plenty of service centers and authorized repair shops in my area. I think I should be  back fairly soon. The Tesla didn't even flinch though, took it like a champ."
"Added my comment. Short version, Deer meet car on highway"
Thanks. I did get a little 🎁. So generous.

Hood is bent really good. Doesn't show up well in that photo. That was taken right after the accident.

"I didn't pull it from the SSD yet but I didn't record it on my cell phone. I'll be pulling it in the morning. Love the cameras, it captured the whole thing."
Mine has a taste for venison now 🦌
Not the steering wheel so OP had a loophole
Airbags did not deploy. Overall the impact wasn't terrible. The car would be somewhat drivable if the passenger headlight wasn't now aimed at the moon
Ouch. Did the car stop working or give any warnings?
"I would have been tempted but he didn't stick around. The bastard took a good hit though, hope he's not too messed up, but I can't imagine he's in great shape."

Really? Didn't know i was so lucky
"No loaner from tesla had to get a rental through my insurance. Was driving a kia soul for a month, it was a terrible down grade"
"Damn son. I can see that now from the pic. Your night was bad, deers was worse."
Car deer meat on highway.
Sometimes there’s nothing you can do.
Ray a drop of golden sun!!
"Ahh, I think I hit a more mature doe if I had to guess. Car still drives luckily, and from what I can tell, both you and I are are physically okay! Can’t quite replace body parts like you can body panels. Wish I had the camera features like you have on the M3 to go back and look."
Video or it didn’t happen. Damn. F. What other letter is worse than that?
"3-4 weeks.
It was towed on a flatbed to Tesla approved body shop 120 Miles away, none where I live.
Tesla emails the list of parts ordered.
Comes back as new with original parts and calibration.
Please let the local tesla service center know to help if needed by the body shop.
You can find which ones are Tesla approved body shops.
They did a great job."
[deleted]
"fudge, its realllly hard to find a undamaged hood on the open market, if you go through insurance this is a 9k fix"
Yeah its amazing to catch things on the dash cam. Post the video when you get the footage from the sd
You can rename it Joe Rogan!
Haha I'm pretty sure the 2020 steering wheel is vegan now.
I'm really glad to hear that. It should help you get your car back quicker. Everyone (minus the deer) okay?
It reduced power to 50mph or less and provided warnings on the center display. I drove an additional 10 -15 miles to get to my hotel. I couldn’t charge since coolant was leaking. It eventually pumped all the coolant out through the punctures. Had to tow it to the Las Vegas service center. Tesla roadside was beyond useless. $1k for the tow.
F
Yea they're are very few Tesla Service centers that do body work
Fuck that sounds awful.
Bastard was walking on the highway like he owned the place too.
"I'm definitely uninjured, which is what's important. I'm glad you're okay as well. I'd be able to drive the Tesla but the passenger headlight is out of commission and I work at night, and have about a 50 minute drive, so it's not gonna be all that safe, at least in my opinion. Not to mention the sensors up front are going nuts over detecting something that's not there."
Video will be coming soon. Get your 🍿 ready.
"That's awesome, really. That makes me a feel a lot better. I've heard the horror stories of these cars taking forever to get fixed. I'll definitely take your advice. I am lucky to be located near a few service centers within an hour drive. Thanks for shedding some light on the process."
"Many thanks.

It would have been better to get some meat out of this, but the suspect was no where to be found. 

Now for the Tesla repair experience. I can't wait...😐"
I definitely will. It's actually a bit embarrassing. It looks like I should have been able to easily avoid it but I just didn't see the deer at all.
Good to know. I have 2020 M3 SR+ and always thought steering wheel is still leather.
F
"Tesla currently has more than 110 U.S. service centers, with more than 30 in its home state of California. "
He does. You’re just the one visiting.
"That is what’s important! And my driver side headlight got shattered, so now I have a warning light on my dash... as if I didn’t notice there was something wrong lol. Forgot to mention I’ve only had the car for two weeks, so I feel your pain very closely with you right now."
All popped and ready.
"You are welcome, wish your car a speedy recovery."
"If at all you are considering a wrap, you might want to ask them if they can do it after the repairs and before you pick it up.
I never wrapped my car."
Do you actually live near a Tesla Service center that does body work? I ask because there are like 2 of them in the country.
Did you have autopilot on? If so was there any attempt to brake?
!remindme 1 day

"we are talking about the ones that do body work homie

there are 4 of them, [https://www.tesla.com/support/body-shop-support](https://www.tesla.com/support/body-shop-support)"
"😂 yeah thanks car, I'm aware my headlight is out. 

Yeah, it's especially painful being so new. We're in the same boat there. We'll get through it and back to normal soon enough. Good luck with your repair, I hope it doesn't take long!"
"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-C5vVGbJe_kZ5Y3uIoGVWy0Ry3asY5Vf/view?usp=drivesdk

A short clip recorded on my cell phone while still on the highway. Still haven't gotten around to pulling the SSD. I won't be able to get around to it until my days off in a few days. 

Nothing spectacular to look at though."
"According to Tesla's website, service centers can do some more basic repairs for hoods, glass, front and rear bumpers and the like. I do happen to not be too far from Rockville, MD which is one of 4 Tesla Body Repair Centers. I'll see what the service center has to say. I may end up going to an authorized body shop if the service center can't do it. I can't imagine there being any structural damage, but I guess I'll find out in a few days."
"AP active, no attempt from the car to brake. I did get the beep warning about 1/4 second from impact."

"Things change homie. They started doing body work at service centers. I got mine done in dallas

https://electrek.co/2019/06/21/tesla-own-bodywork-service-centers-mobile/"
Ouch. Poor Bambie.
MY BOY GOT YEETED LMAO
let me know what they say please because if I'm ever in another accident that is where I'll be going
"Did you have the audio warning set for beep at an early, late, or medium level?"
Sucks to hear AP didn't auto brake :(.
F
"uh that article says nothing but that they are going to start doing body work at service centers which isn't the issue at all, it's that most people have no access to it, also tesla says they have 4 total, post evidence the service center in dallas is doing body work"
Early. It doesn't go off that much so I don't mind it being set at that level.
F
Why would I lie? Many Tesla service centers started doing body work probably not all are capable of structural damage.  Believe me or not I'm just trying to help someone out.
F
"just prove it, I'll be happy to believe you if you can present something that would back this statement up because I can find nothing on the internet stating that the Dallas service center does body repair and I also know for certain that Tesla does update the page I linked to because I was rear ended in February and the Rockville MD service center was not on that list yet."

"[https://electrek.co/2019/06/21/tesla-own-bodywork-service-centers-mobile/](https://electrek.co/2019/06/21/tesla-own-bodywork-service-centers-mobile/). Note the June 2019 date of this article. My local service center says they fix bumpers, but when they got pictures of my bumper, they told me to take it to the local Tesla body shop, which is a couple of blocks away from the service center. I took it to an authorized body shop instead. The body shop did a great job of matching the red paint of my car. The manager said they had to paint it a couple of times to get it right. One advantage was that the body shop was also an authorized estimator for my insurance company so they could do that work and the repair at the same time."
Thanks for all the Fs. 🙏🏻 I have my estimate appointment on Wednesday. Wish me luck with a timely repair.
"interesting, I would be interested in seeing a actual full comprehensive list of locations though because like I said it was not available to me in rockville md 8 months ago. I might email Tesla for an actual list because I doubt all of them do it."
yes the other guy pointed to that same article and I needed a new bumper cover after I got rear ended in february and the rockville service center was not doing any body work at the time so they must have started in the last 8 months.
Ah very nice! I miss visiting Colorado. Stupid Covid.
I stayed in the Tech Center for 9 months and had a chance to run around the state. Just beautiful up there. My mother-in-law saw concerts there in the 60s.
"Nice picture! Was just out that way last weekend, no better feeling than gaining battery coming down the mountains."

This one hurts.

Had tickets to see Jason Isbell at Red Rocks last month, unfortunately it was postponed due to the pandemic :("

Sorry to hear that. I really-really miss concerts at Red Rocks :(

i fucking love it!! and 3k sounds like a good price
“I kinda like it” after spending 3-5K. I’d hope so.
"That wrap looks really nice, so sad that it's almost impossible to get something like that legal here in Germany. On the other hand I could imagine seeing a wrap like this everyday would be too much very quickly imo"
Looks fabulous
"It's great that you support LGBT causes, OP. 👍"
Looks amazing! How much does something like this cost
I like it!
I adore this. It was a strong consideration for mine but I decided to keep it subtle with bright yellow.
Cost?
Love it!
I have this wrap on my center console.
Yeah. Nope.
Did you do it yourself? Any tips?
Glad that you like it. I would like it for all of 15 minutes.
I LOVE this.

"$3,000 installed"
Nope. I found an installer on 3M’s website.😊
I'm fully certain I'm neutral about this.
"Wraps are fine as long as you make it so your paperwork is being changed accordingly (the primary color of the vehicle is noted in our paperworks)

If you get pulled over by police they can deny you to drive further if you have a reflective wrap since they deem it unsafe for others. There has been quite a few court rules against it, so your chances of it getting approved are almost none."
Where?
I just found an installer on 3M’s website.. in Salt Lake City
beautiful pups
"Is one laying down on the job? Or, part of its compensation package?

Also love the littler ones face"
11/10 would pet
That's a cute thought... another would be that you prefer them being in the cold and the only way for the cute pups to heat up is by being around your epic and hot Model 3
"Thought it was a promo for The Boys on Prime when this popped up in my notifications, but sadly I don't think we will be getting Amazon Prime anytime soon.."

"I will!! Gave them a few pets and a treat ! The third pup isn’t  pictured, a rescue German Shepard who was beaten a lot."
She also confirmed my next question around the heated steering wheel. That did not make it into this update.
Updates announced just after the return window for all the Q3 deliveries.
"Last time I trusted a random rep in a chat box, I was disappointed. Dont take this as too official"
Looks like power trunk included too now along with chrome delete!
I regret my life. I took delivery 1 month ago.
"Honest question... What is up with heated steering wheel requests? I lived in Michigan for most of my life. If the inside if my car was that friggin’ cold I wouldn’t take my gloves off until it was warm. You own a Tesla. Turn the heat on before you get in. Point the heat at the wheel, and your hands. The wheel is also not bare metal and it’s insulated so it doesn’t just freeze your hands. 

I just don’t get it."
I can confirm most reps say whatever you want to hear. “When do you want to place your order?”
"Is this the reason for the range increase, or does anyone know whether there's a change to the motors or battery?"
Im hyped! Ordered my m3p yesterday lol
"Does the refresh have a bigger battery? Or can we (before refresh) LR Model 3’s expect to get the increase range in a software update? 
Another question: The steering wheel is different, does that mean it contains the hardware for heated steering wheel that will probably be revealed in a future software update?"
So all new orders from this point on will get heat pump?
Is the new acceleration an OTA update or more of a battery upgrade in the new M3s?
"So if its a heatpump now, what was it before? Surely it didn't use resistive heating?"
Is this only on the performance model or on all trims of the M3?
"Heatpump eh? Is that the same heatpump people spent all of 2017, 2018 and 2019 swearing blind wasn’t necessary in a Model 3, but now it’s being introduced is absolutely necessary in a Model 3.

Heating steering wheel though... that’d be lovely. :)"
"Hey check out the confirmation there is a HeatPump in the 2021 Model 3 SR+ REFRESH!!  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrNMNxLBWU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZrNMNxLBWU)"
What about laminated glass and newer seal for better sound isolation?
Aw darn. Heated steering wheel would probably make me switch my Model Y order back to the 3.
My Tesla rep told me new headlights as well.
"Hard pill to swallow but one that must, to maintain sanity.."
"seriously?? i took delivery september 30, is the return window finished for me?"
I asked a tesla advisor today and he also confirmed heat pump
This needs to be higher up.

I test drove a car with a heated steering wheel and it felt gross to me.
You made me think beyond being a spoiled 1st world bitch. Good point.
I'd take air conditioned seats over a heated steering wheel any damn day.
"Same. As long as my body is warm I’m good, and I actually like the feeling of a cool wheel since my hands get sweaty sometimes from driving/gripping the wheel."
"I currently drive a Spark EV (stalking Tesla subs in hopes I can spring for a Y in the spring) with a 26 mile commute each way. In the winter it's tough because that 90 Mile range is eaten up quickly by the heat. If it had a heater steering wheel though I wouldn't need to run the cabin air constantly once the edge is taken off which would greatly ease my winter range anxiety.

Granted a 300 mile power pack makes that mostly a non issue, but I can certainly see someone with longer winter commutes at highway speed making great use of a heated steering wheel.

.02"
"I get the cynicism, but right after that I asked about the windows and door seal improvements and she said those did not make it."
i was reading that was the case and the cause for the acceleration improvement also.
"Not a bigger battery but likely cell improvements from Panasonic, so not software. I wouldn't expect anything for existing model 3s.

Where do you see the steering wheel is different?"
Apparently so
"I don't understand it all, but this compares ICE vs regular EV vs Tesla Model Y/new 3

Tesla fanboys are just like Microsoft fanboys. Every time Windows lacks something it's not needed...until it gets it 20 years later then it's a must.
"Asked them that too and there's no changes to any of that in this update apparently, but never know maybe it snuck in."
"I think it is, and will be enabled with a software update."
Indeed! In all aspects of life it is best to appreciate what you have rather than what you might have had or what others have.
How long do you think you can borrow the car? It’s 7 days or 1000 miles. Pass either one and you own it forever.
Yes. Best just to move on and enjoy your car.

"Correct me if I'm wrong, however at that cold of a temperature wouldn't a heat pump be worth jack anyways? Also, celsius or fahrenheit."
You totally made LOL in public reading that to myself.
"Hah, not at all what I meant to do! I have skinny fingers. Cold makes them f’n hurt. Grabbing a heated wheel wouldn’t help me as they are still exposed. Again, I just don’t get it. Is it just a “look what I have” thing? A problem that never needed a solution, IMHO.

😃"
Gloves get you that extra mile. :-)
https://electrek.co/2020/10/16/tesla-launches-model-3-2021-refresh-range-features/
"Thanks! So it really is resistive heating in the old version. Strange choice, must be cost driven."
Only one way to find out for sure! *Cuts open steering wheel with handsaw*
spoken very true-ly.
But if you return you'll be blocked from purchasing the same model for a year
Then you can still return it
-18 isn’t that cold.
Nah I don't think it's that. I have it in my Jeep currently and love it when it's cold out. Something about the wheel being warmer than the ambient temp
Yeah until you realize all you have a is a touchscreen to run your car
"I see. Who knows for now. Could come in a future software update if the hardware is there. Makes sense that it's not a priority at the moment, since no existing model 3s would get any benefit if they had developed the software for it today."
I’m wondering if I return and put it under my brothers name and then switch over to me in a couple months I’m sure Tesla wouldn’t know
Idk how could that is in freedom-degrees but in celsius that's really ducking cold
"I have capacitive gloves. And you can use voice commands for a lot of things. Why is your car so cold inside? You know you can heat them up remotely. 

Or you could just try a gummy bear stuck on a pencil. 😃"
Lol love the creativity
"I’m Canadian, but I grew up in northern bc so I guess I’m used to it haha. Still hate it though. LOL@ Freedom Degrees"
I’m pissed because my car is turning 2 weeks tomorrow if I would of known I would of waited I just want the chrome delete that’s all
"I hear you. I got mine less than a month ago but what frustrated me was the increased range and new battery tech. Then of course taking that, all the updates and the deceptive effort to push out old models really frustrated me.

Don't get me wrong, it's fantastic car but Tesla as a company is a mess. I still believe in it's mission and all that shit but it needs to work out it's issues.."
"Please stop that ""would of"" crap."
"I come from Toyota and I like how they announced what the next year model will have and you have a choice to wait or buy now  I knew Tesla had horrible quality but dang when I picked mine up it’s just like here’s your car it’s all dusty on the outside and no paper mats on the inside 

The inside was all dirty with shoe prints I was pissed

"This! 

Don't use a thumb drive."
Thanks!
Thank you
"Oh, how come? Thanks :)"
"Thumb drives crash, quick. SSD does better with all the rewrites and can usually handle quicker write speeds. I got a 500GB on amazon for not that much."
Makes sense. Your reply is appreciated
"Wait, don’t you have to plug something into the USB port?"
The SSD drive will have a usb cable. Usually usb 3.0
Oh gotcha
Bit limited in used on the X with all the right stuff.  Only option is 2019.5 or 2019 Raven and newer. Not really old enough to have a good used market of availability quite yet.  And even then not that drastic in price differences IMO.
"Raven refresh happened in 2nd half of 2019.  It upgraded the electric motors, which gave more range, had the latest MCU and AP hardware which if FSD is what you're after then you want those to be latest.  Drive shafts and I want to say air ride suspension but don't quote me on last part it's been a minute since I looked that up.  We bought our 2019 Raven Model X Long Range with 6 seat and FSD.  Love it can get up to 328mi on a trip with 4 people and luggage front to back.  Funny we went to buy a M3 or used S for my daily upgrade ended up leaving with a new Model X for the wife... WTH lol"
Is that range difference even worth mentioning in practical terms between Raven and Non-Raven? It’s not even 10%
"I got a 2019 model X pre-raven (hw2.5), and am happy with it.  (100D 7 seater)

It should be nearly identical, the range is probably  less than 10% different like someone else said, it has air suspension.   If you opt for FSD they will update your hardware from 2.5 to 3, so there's no issue there.  

It has one major plus, free supercharging.  The newer models dont have free supercharging from what I hear.

I saved about $40,000 (AUD) on this model, and it only had 5000km/3000mi on the clock.  I would not have paid full price for a new model."
"Avoid anything that is out of warranty. Your best bet is to shop on Tesla.com and they will throw in a new 4 year warranty from the time of pickup. Also try to get a 2018 model or newer, they come with the newer media control unit (MCU) which is more responsive and has the entertainment and games.

Avoid the FSD option, it's a huge beta feature and is not worth the money right now. I wouldn't trust it, especially with kids in the car. Although, if you buy from tesla.com, they upgrade their cars with it. On the listing, look for ""full self driving capability"", this means the car has FSD.

6 seater is definitely the way to go with kids.

Another site to shop is onlyusedtesla.com, but you should only buy a car there if it's still within warranty."
"I bought my 2019 X Raven from the dealer at the mall. It had 500 miles on it from test drives. It was end of quarter so we got unlimited lifetime supercharging and a $300 store credit if we took it home that day. We love it, but we also have a Y and the Y is just so much easier to get the kids in and out of. I hate the falcon wing doors. The Difference between the X and the Y screen and UI is also so different. I like the Y better in all ways except the ride. My Y is performance so not as smooth as my long range X. I imagine if you got the king range Y you’d be better off. If I had to pick one I’d pick the Y."
Try Swapalease.
"You still still shopping?

I just bought a used Model X, and to be honest I ultimately used ev-cpo.com to get to the meat.

One issue I had was trying to find somewhere that had the specs I was looking for.

From what I can tell EV-CPO scrapes Tesla's website for used vehicle fairly frequently.

EV-CPO has ""premium features"" which are free for a year when you register with the site.  Near as I can tell the registration is to weed out people taking advantage of how useful the site is.

You can use EV-CPO.com to set filters to filter out the Tesla's used inventory based on the features you want.  In my case I wanted a 2017 model year Model X with FSD, but I wanted something with either AP HW 3.0 already installed, or AP 2.5, which EV-CPO allowed me to filter on.  I then also filtered based on 6-seater, clean history, and less than 35,000 miles.  Furthermore, there's a little dollar symbol you can click on that will show you the price history (Premium, but again premium is free). 

So, in my case I was watching a Model X in Burbank, California.  It was at 71,400 earlier this week, then dropped to 70,400, and in looking at the price history graph I noticed a pattern of Tesla raising the price for a day, before putting it back where it was, before lowering it the next day.  So, I saw that we were on the cusp of a price drop and I opted to go to bed.  Woke up this morning and it was down to $70,000, so I went ahead and bought it.

But had I not used EV-CPO.com I likely would've bought something more expensive.

THAT BEING SAID, if you click on the gear of the vehicle you're looking at it'll show you a break down of ALL the features the vehicle has, tow package, sound system, battery type, etc, etc.  So you can do a granular comparison that way, but the columns showing the differences should be enough.

The price history graph also show what price it started at, and how long it has been on the market for.  In my case with the X in Burbank it had been listed September 30th for $78,200, and I managed to get it for $70,000.

I will throw a *huge* caveat in there in that I am paying $2,000 to have it shipped from CA to FL, so *technically* I have bought it for $72,000+tax, but it was still about $3,000 cheaper than the next one on the list, after the shipping costs.

So, a fair chunk of it is playing the waiting game and either getting financing and hoping you can score, or score then hope you can get financing in time.

In my case I got financing 90% done, then took the shot."
I’m not sure what you’re asking?
"Curious about this.  I've heard that free connectivity and supercharging goes with the owner, and not the car.  I was told used X does not come with these things.  Did you negotiate?"

We rented a Y for a few days to try it out and the visibility out the back was awful. We were seriously considering the Y until we discovered it was so difficult to see everything behind us.
"Agreed I would kill for a Model X with the Model Y dash... We’ve had the 3 forever and I love it, but we’ve been holding out for years for an X refresh... starting to lose hope but we really want one."
It comes with the car. Older Xs (I’m guessing S as well) have free lifetime charging grandfathered in. They stopped it at the end of 2019 or early 2020 I believe.
You’re supposed to look out the windshield. 😂😂😂 we have no problem seeing. I wonder if they had dark tint or something.
I thought they announced one. For early 2021
"Nope no refresh announced, it’s been rumored for years. The interior looks so dated it’s the only part of the X I really don’t like."
"Personally, I think the X will get a Plaid version, but in 2022."
"4680 cells coming out will be for Semi, Cybertruck, Roadster and Plaid Model S. Those should start in a year and will take a while to ramp up production.

It will probably take 2-3 years before they start to replace 2170 cells in the current lineup."
"I placed at order for X sep 2nd. I told my rep that I can only pay for it after battery day sep 22nd after I hear what Elon has to say. Once I heard that new cells were more than a year away (Elon's tweet on 21st) I went ahead and paid for the car. No way I am waiting that long for the ultimate ride, 7 seats and 371 miles of range ;)

I am super pleased w/ the ride. Like riding in a spaceship. Super smooth. Getting my full body wrap on the X. Excited to see how it look in 2 days. Disclaimer: this is my 3rd Tesla car. I replaced S with this X and have a 3."
"Hopefully early 2022, but Tesla is usually later than hope."
https://electrek.co/2020/10/07/elon-musk-tesla-structural-battery-cells-model-y-giga-berlin/
"Thank you for the info. I have a 3 at the moment, upgrading to an X. I'm most likely going this route as well, just have to bite the bullet here I think."
Are you getting the wrap through the delivery center?  What color and what are they charging you?
"They just bumped the range of the x up from 351 -> 371 (news came out 6 days ago). I am hoping it is a software change not hw. My ride came with an official range of 351.
https://electrek.co/2020/10/13/tesla-model-x-range-increase-2021/

if you go to the order page right now you will see the 371 range x. perf got a boost to 341 too. so doubt they will be doing another range increase anytime soon. great time to buy just after range bump."
"Got it via third party. Came out pretty good. I am in  texas. DM me if you are interested. The sticker on the windshield is not part of wrap although i am tempted to get a bigger version of it ;)

Disable child lock in settings
There should be a button on the pillar
I have the older lever style as well. You can definitely open it from the inside by “pulling” on the lever from the bottom side
"As someone else said child lock. I sat with my son in the back a few days after I bought my car and got stuck. Then a traffic warden came and gave me a ticket whilst I was trying to work out how to get out! Eventually used the keys which were in the front passenger footwell, not a pretty sight! I wasn’t yet familiar with using the touchscreen or any of the cars functions!

Anyway child lock still on in my car as my kids or visiting kids aren’t trustworthy enough yet. But I am never in the back without my key fob on me."
Ah I'm sure that's it. Thanks to you and ilovefireengines. :)
"That's what I'm saying, that button won't open it, just close it."
"Ah, didn't realize older models had a ""close only"" button. Hm, I guess the other way is from the app"
No picture...but you’d be surprised at what a good shop can fix. My buddy had a chunk missing from his and they repaired it. Looks like new.
I am new to reddit. How can I post pictures.
"Try editing your post and look for a button to upload a picture. That or upload it it
Imgur and put the link in."
Got it Thank you :)
"I’m in love omg, looks beautiful!"
For those asking:  Total cost of wrap and ceramic coat was approximately $4500 Canadian after taxes.
Nice! Now black out the logos and tint them windows and that think will be looking sexy as hell!
Looks deadly
Do they wrap the door jam too?  Can you post a pic of the door jam
"I’m not normally a green person, but that’s sexy."
Looks sick. Should do the calipers to match
Looks great. Which front license plate bracket did you go with?
Awesome.
"Wow, that looks just plain Tough AF. Very nice!"
I can dig it
That is absolutely gorgeous.
Great color! I would have done the door handles too
😘
🔥🔥🔥
"It looks amazing,, love that color."
Love this color.
What was the original color?
total cost?
Looks great !  I’ve always been curious what the interiors of wrapped cars look like.   The body colored bits that are visible... is anything in the interior done as well?
Reminds me of my wife’s iPhone - stunning colour and finish
How much does that cost
Have to tint the front windows. It doesn’t match.
"My wife has always wanted a green (color) car.   This was how I accomplished getting her a green (color), green (environment) car."
Unfortunately we have issues around tinting out the windows in BC.    By issues I mean costly tickets and have to have the tint removed :(
"They could have, but I didn't opt for the extra cost.   I'll grab a picture tonight."
What color would you do the calipers though.... the standard 'Ferrari red' just doesn't seem quite right.
It's the standard bracket Tesla provided for British Columbia.
"I'm not sure why you responded back to yourself, BUT.... base color was Tesla base white."
Does it matter was the base color was when you paint over it?
Agree. We have done a lighter front tint before. But certainly not this drastic.
"Your wife sounds a lot like me! I’m a big sucker for green, also a big sucker for not having to go to gas stations :) my MY is a lease though so no wraps for me!"
PPF or vinyl?
Aww that sucks... Looks great either way!
"I think a deeper red would go great with the red of the taillights. Looks wicked, do you work in the military? :p"
"This might be way out there, but I would say bright white calipers :)"
"This isn't painted, it's a vinyl wrap that goes over top.   The base color doesn't matter."
All of the windows are actually stock.  Didn't do ANY window tint.
"Not in the military.  There is a military green option though!

I'm going to have to think about the calipers now.  ANOTHER spot to sink money into!"
"It matters to the extent when you open doors you will see the base color, some combinations look really bad with say White if exterior is darker etc some work well (e.g black base color) any pics of the door sills and metal thats not wrapped?"
"This color is pretty awesome, so how about a neon green caliper? Ya know, to be even more different?"

"That's a great point.     My base is white.   A darker color may have done a better job blending when open, but white did not involve any extra costs from Tesla when purchasing :)"
Any pics?
Just got my Y a couple weeks ago and me and the Mrs. Have already been talking about ditching our other ICE vehicle. Crazy!
Joining that trend this week. I have had my MY since late June and we pick up my wife's this week. :-) Bye Bye gas stations!
"When I bought my S back as a daily driver back in 2015, it became an issue for my wife to keep driving our Ford Flex. It took a year, but we finally went 100% Tesla and haven’t looked back."
"I love that name ""escape pod"". One of the best I've heard!"
Generally unimpressed by car names generally and most of the corny names here but escape pod is 🔥🔥🔥
Nice!
Coronado Island?
Is that your house?!?! 😅 ooo you rich rich lol
How much are your car payments?
Just did the same. Got my 3 in May 2019 and picked up my wife’s X last month! Now our almost 4 year old is begging us to get solar so we can charge our cars with the sun’s energy. Love seeing kids get excited about a green future. Just want it to happen faster!
"Same... Within a month of getting our Y, we were contemplating this idea. Decided to postpone it until we need two cars on a regular basis again post pandemic"
Same here!
Was it difficult to choose a color? I’m torn between blue and white smh
Thank you!
Thank you!
South San Jose is flattered by that guess! Hayes Mansion in SJ
"Lol if that was our house we’d both for sure have Performance models. It’s the hotel down the street, makes for much nicer pictures than our condo complex 😂"
 came here to say this too
"Sounds like we’re on a similar trajectory. I started with solar, now the Y and I see a 3 in my near term future as soon as that heat pump rolls out. :)"
"For us it wasn’t, but we had been thinking about it for a while, so any flip flopping was long gone. Go team blue!"
Wooo san jo!
Came here to ask if OP lived at Mar-a-Lago or something
Congrats!😊 Doubled pane windows?
Quality report and delivery experience?
Double pane glass in the front ?
Auto dimming side mirrors or nah?
Beautiful.
"I have the same car on order white/black 68,XXX VIN.  Very happy to hear you got the double pane windows... I am expecting them, but can't get any info from Tesla advisors."
The background with all the palm trees makes this Tesla look so nice.  A little jealous as I’m wearing a winter jacket here in Washington DC 😊
Congrats. It’s beautiful
Congrats beautiful car enjoy it.
Awesome... looks pretty tough the way you shot the pics.  Congrats!
Congrats! Any plans to tint those double panes front windows?
Did it come with a heated steering wheel? I have mine ordered but am waiting for the heated steering wheel. Gets cold up north!
Thanks so much for sharing!!! Enjoy!!! 🙃
Does your Model Y have the 2 Regenerative Braking options (Low and Standard) or no option to change it?
"I want to get this exact configuration, looks sharp! Congrats dude! Hope you’re enjoying it."
No way! They're shipping 2021?!? I'm happy I ordered mine 2 weeks ago so I'm assuming I'll be getting a 2021!
Congrats! Did you get the USB Port inside the Glove Box?
"Congrats! We just ordered our LR Y this weekend, blue with white interior and Gemini wheels. How long did delivery take for you from order to delivery?"
Hi not sure if someone had asked this already but are the scroll knobs on the steering wheel metal or rubber? I saw that on the model 3 refresh it’s now made out of metal.
Could you include the whole VIN sans the last 3 digits?
I'm assuming the center console is not the new redesigned version?
"Thanks! Yes, double pane windows but only in the driver and front passenger windows. The rear windows are still single pane."
"Delivery process was very smooth. Our car was sitting in their huge warehouse/service center so it was not baking out in the sun. Great lighting allowed for close inspection. They let us take our sweet time examining the car and did not rush us in anyway. I signed my papers sitting across the table from one of the workers (so your touchless/social distancing mileage may vary). I’ve seen people signing papers outside in the car by themselves on YouTube, so who knows.

As for the quality...

Exterior:
Minor door gaps/misalignment on both sides that was quickly adjusted on delivery day. We just went to lunch while they did that before coming back to sign the papers. Improved after the adjustment but it wasn’t perfect. However, I wasn’t going to have them continue to mess with the doors and possibly dent/make it worse. 

Small scratch on right rear view mirror trim (that glossy triangular trim - not sure what it’s called). And a loose left rear view mirror trim. Not a huge deal. They did not have any on hand to fix/replace on delivery day so told us to make an appointment for service center.

Rear bumper color is very slightly off, but you’d have to look super closely to even tell the difference.

Otherwise, no other issues with the exterior. Hatch and frunk lined up as perfectly as Tesla can line them up with no problems opening and closing. Door handles sit flushed. Taillights and charging ports are flushed. No paint issues.

Interior:
Interior of my car was pretty flawless. Some dirty plastic trims in the hatch which I just wiped off real quick. Otherwise nothing loose. Everything worked as it should. Most importantly the back seats lined up perfectly, and folded down as it should when pressing the buttons in the back."
"Yes, just the driver and front passenger windows. Rear passenger windows are single pane."
"No auto-dimming side mirrors. Center console is also the original version, which I prefer anyway."
"For sure you should be getting the double pane. From reading the forums, 64xxx and beyond are getting them."
I’m pretty sure yours will be double pane.
"The setting really makes a difference to this car imo (and the m3), it looks amazing in the sun, showcasing the paint colours. They look pretty bland here in the uk :("
"I am getting all the windows tinted soon, including the front. I think the double pane helps with insulation, but installing good heat rejection tint would have a greater effect overall."
No heated steering wheel unfortunately.
"No, there is no option to change up braking strength. All good though because I like the stronger braking anyways for better one pedal driving."
Thanks! Loving it so far!
Yeah you should be getting the 2021!
No USB inside glove box.
It look a month exactly!
Mine was still rubber. I’m sure the steel ones will be rolling out to the Model Y soon.
"Hi, sorry I'd rather not but I think all you need to look at is the last 5 numbers as it is the production number off the line."
Center console is not the redesigned one.
Nice!
"my VIN is 68xxx and was hoping with higher number, it will be imperfection free. Wishful thinking"
Rear bumper looks real bad in the right light (cloudy).  I've been living with it since June and would love for some one to lightly bump into me. 😄
You mind sharing some pics of the rear bumper? Curious how it looks compared to others I’ve seen with the color off quite a bit.
That’s a lot more issues then I would think they should have at this point...
Honestly fine w this.  I have 11k on my car and the wind noise on long trips can be a nuisance on phone calls or podcasts.
"Thank you good sir or madame. I take delivery later in the week and that was my final lingering question. 

Enjoy!"
Why do you prefer it
"That is awesome to hear, I'm really excited.  Congrats on the new ride... looks great!"
"Man, I wonder how long I’m going to have to wait on that?!"
Thanks for the info
The first bit just includes production location and the year. Wondering if Tesla is actually coding these as 2021.
What's the hype around double pane windows ? How does it help ?
"I don’t think any car is imperfection free, much less Teslas (which I do believe is a bit overly scrutinized). But the fact is that the imperfections are pretty minor and have drastically improved - which is all we can ask for from Tesla at this point."
"For sure. I’m new to Reddit so not sure if I could reply with a pic or not (can’t find the option), so I just did another post with the rear bumper so you can compare color. Link is below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/jlnqt0/rear\_bump\_color\_model\_y\_vin\_68xxx/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/jlnqt0/rear_bump_color_model_y_vin_68xxx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)"
"TBH I don’t think so? I definitely think that some of the issues like loose trims, and door misalignment is ridiculous to be having at this point in production and at this price point. However, the number of issues isn’t that large for a car that’s been in production for less than a year? They are also quick to resolve them. I’m sure legacy car markers have a lot of issues that most people just don’t care enough to post tons of videos about - but maybe I’m just making excuses for Tesla haha"
"Well the new one is supposed to be similar to the center console for the S and X, whose instrumental cluster is a little more busy so it works. The whole point of the single touch screen for the 3/Y was to go minimalistic (or for Tesla to cut costs...haha) so I think the pre update console plays into that theme more."
I would think the rest of the updates like dimming side mirrors and heating steering wheel will come within the next few months.
......I am sure it will be along with FSD 🤞
"Not sure about the coding, but on my paperwork it lists it as a 2021 Model Y."
Hopefully less road noise
"As long as the panel gaps arent bad, no rattles and no real noticeable paint ill be ok.

What accessories did you get in advance? recommend floor mats?"
Damn. That’s not just dirt that will wash off?
Gotcha. The redesigned  phone charging cubby looks dope though
I asked my Tesla advisor today and he said that he has no indication that was coming ever. :(
"Could you confirm if the 10th character is an M?  I'm guessing your VIN looks like.

5YJYGDEE5**M**F019xxx

https://teslatap.com/vin-decoder/"
"Panel gaps were good for me, only area was the doors which they fixed on the spot - although still not perfect. There are no rattles and my paint was pretty flawless. 

The one thing I did notice was this deep vibration sort of sound when I was backing up slowly out of my garage. It felt like a bass drop and had some uncomfortable pressure in my ears. We’ll see what happens with this. And I do understand that electric vehicles these days are made to have a humming sound on back up, but this is a bit different from just that.

As for accessories, I got the Maxpider Kagu full set of floor mats. They seem to be the best fitting and durable. I got them before I took delivery so I could install them right away and avoid dirtying the floors. So far so good. I also got the Samsung PRO endurance 128gb microSD card with the SanDisk MobileMate USB 3.0 microSD card reader for Sentry Mode and Dashcam. The Pro endurance card is built for continuous writes and rewrites of dashcams so I figured it was the one to get. Otherwise all the other accessories are nice but not necessary to have by delivery day."
"Haha no it’s not dirt. I don’t know, maybe it’s just me but I don’t think there’s much of a difference. I’m planning to do a full Xpel Stealth wrap too so probably will hide it a bit. I do think it’s ridiculous that such an expensive vehicle would have this kind of issue..but what can you do?"
"Yes, it is an M."
Cool thanks. Yeah floor mats were the main thing I was looking to have in advance for the same reason.
What made you choose the Maxpider Kagu mats instead of the Tesla all weather mats? Just curious what the considerations were...
I’m sure you can only see it in really good sunlight. It would probably only bother me if I was washing my car.
Perfect. Thanks!
Honestly I just thought they fit better and overall looked sleeker. I’m sure the Tesla all weather mats work just the same. Floors meant to get dirty anyways haha
"I'm still undecided, so thanks for the feedback! 😉"
"Damn that looks amazing. I'd love to charge my car by the sun. Doesn't really make sense where I am.

I'm in Vancouver, BC. We are far enough north that there isn't much light in the winter. Plus our power is cheap, and produced mostly by hydroelectric (93% clean energy, and moving towards 100%). So it doesn't make sense to go solar yet. But man I would love that setup, just to know your car and house gets powered by the sun. Amazing."
Goals!
How do you like Tesla’s solar?
"Looks great! MSM, white interior? Got any more pics?"
Sweet set-up!!! 👌🏼
"The only reason you would ever want solar based on that is just to get ""off the grid"" or so to speak. Sounds like your city/government is already doing a great job.

I live in the south where 90% of our power comes from coal.. it sucks."
Does BC Hydro give rebates for solar? Or how does it work?
Love it. 16+kw system (50 panels) and 4 powerwalls. Just had it installed 3 weeks ago and already seeing savings.
I’ve got plenty of mine! Dm me if you are considering it!
"Yeah, BC consistently has the cleanest electricity in North America."
"Don't think there is a rebate, but they'll buy back extra electricity at market rate:  https://www.bchydro.com/work-with-us/selling-clean-energy/net-metering.html"
Crikey.  That’s a lotta chedda
"If I can ask what is the time frame for return on investment, only looking at the money side?"
Would love an update in a couple months.
Living the dream!!
"I’m considering 👀, have you posted an album already to the subreddit?"
For me - 6 to 7 years.
No. there was a paint chip under the clear coat that I took in to get fixed and I’m away from her for over a week. Once I get PPF on and windows tinted I will
Damn. Last I had it quoted it was 16 years for me.
I would actually be interested in seeing what a paint chip looks like so I know what to look for when it’s time to take delivery.
"It was actually a metal shaving under the clear coat. Pretty easy to spot. Just check for marks on paint. Mostly it will be adhesive leftover that they wipe off right then. But if they can’t get it off then you can have them fix it.

Lots of horror stories about Delivery. I think it’s overkill. just look over things, send concerns in an email to your delivery specialist, then make a service appointment to fix all of them. They will do it for free and it’s not a big deal. There would have to be major major issues for me to refuse delivery"
"I pick up my 64xxx tomorrow, so I'll verify whether I got the double pane windows or not.

**Edit:** it has it!"
"Man, I may just sell my MY AWD (VIN 44K) just to get this double pane windows."
"Thanks for reporting! Do you know your car’s build date? If not, Tesla should be able to provide it if you ask them.

The build date should be a more reliable way to determine when Tesla switched from single/double panes than looking at VIN numbers.


EDIT: I had a Model Y on order (2021 VIN, 60xxx, build date October 11th) and it arrived at the service center today. It does NOT have the double paned windows.

If folks could post their build dates and whether their windows are single or double paned, it would be much appreciated!"
Can anyone with a 62xxx vin confirm if their glass is double pane?
Can you take pictures of the door/windows rubber seal? Does it feel much more elastic/stronger than the current seal?
"I am so jealous. My VIN 601xx seems just finished production last couple weeks, I hope I will get the same thing ...."
"I got a 62xxx coming on Nov 2, so hopefully I made the cut in. Looking for anyone that can verify."
"Just placed MY order yesterday, hoping to get double pane windows 🤞"
O.M.G. I am picking up in a couple weeks. I really hope mine are double pane windows!!! Thanks for sharing totally didn’t even know about this! Fingers crossed 🤞
"Thanks for sharing your news. I also have 63XXX MY on the way. I'm picking mine up in Nashville in the next couple weeks.

Have you noticed any other differences/upgrades mentioned for the Model 3 like the new center console, USB-C port for Sentry in the glovebox, etc."
What is the reason for this- better sound insulation?  Why only the front?
Can you do a sound test? Maybe with a phone app. Or grab a friend who has a 3/Y
Just the fronts?  I wonder if anything other than the glass was changed. If an old Y breaks a window can they get the new glass.
I wonder what a refit on an older model would cost.
"It’s only a matter of time before the new center console rolls out. Can’t wait! These features definitely make the car feel more luxe—probably because they’ve decided the car will be in the 45k+ range rather than 40k (as they axed the standard range), which makes sense."
Thanks for sharing!!!
Fuck
"Nice, congrats on the new Model Y. 

Quick question, does your car come with the new taillights with the amber turn signals? I recently saw one with temporary plates in NYC and it had the old style taillights. Thanks!"
"I was told today that my 66XXX MY should come off the line any day now, so I'll be looking for this!"
"Taking delivery today, they had to fix some cosmetic things but vin 64xxx with new windows"
"Great, I am scheduled to pick my 64xxx vin tomorrow as well, hope to see the same. How was your build quality?"
"Maybe it’s because I came out of an ICE car but I don’t understand the point of this. This car is already so much quieter than most cars I’ve been in. 

Wish they would have stuck that extra money into a CarPlay license or Homelink module."
Any confirmation that this is also on the refreshed M3?
Woah! This is a major upgrade. Curious to hear the difference in wind noise
I have a low 63K vin... I hope I made the cut
"Picked up 640xx today. Near perfect condition. 
And yes...double pane front windows. 
Backs are still single pane."
I have a 634xx coming next week and will try to update here if it has double pane glass. Curious if any mid to low 63xxx folks have taken delivery and can confirm.
"Picked up VIN 635xx today, double pane!"
"Definitely not hating, I think this should make the car incredibly quiet. But personally I’m glad my wife’s model Y has regular tempered windows. Here in South Florida there’s a bunch of Canals and God for bid she ever hydroplaned into one. I want her to have the option to break the window."
"Congrats! I pick up my 60xxx tomorrow, hoping I have double pane front windows too"
Nice.  Do you also have a USB port in the glove box?
I wonder how much flex these have now and might be better for sealing out dust.
"Is there any indication on the sticker label on the glass that anything has changed?

Also, what's your month of manufacture? VINs don't appear to be entirely sequential."
Do you have the new HEPA filter? See if you have biohazard filter mode enabled?
63xxx picking up nov 1st week. Hoping this change will be in that one.
Would This be considered a 2021?
Does the console receive the same update as model 3 as well?
"Nice! It kind of looks like you have black door sills - this was one of the changes in Model 3 (""sill plates are now satin black to match the exterior trim""). Is that just from the lighting or is the plate actually blacked out?

Any chance you have the ""graphite finish seat controls"" and ""metalized steering wheel scroll wheels"" as well?"
That sucks for me. I’m picking up today 62xxx . I would’ve love a double pane window since I’m in Midwest. Better climate control def needed here
Dang. That would help on noise. Is it coming to the whole line up? model 3s too? S and X?
"*
Cry in 46XXX"
"I wonder if that glass is ballistic, like the Cybertruck?  Maybe let's throw a brick at it to find out :). (suggested by a jealous 2020 MY owner)"
Picking up my 639xx VIN next week. Fingers crossed I made it in! Pirate43 - can you share if your VIN is also 639xx?
Any news from anyone with 635xx-63999? Picking up my 638xx next week and want to know what to expect ahead of time!
"I am picking up my new Y tomorrow. October 12th build date, high 62s for VIN."
How can you tell it’s double pane?
"Wait I thought this was an undesirable flaw? Like they put double glass by accident ?

Or is this something MY owners want now?"
Suspense is killing me
My 642xx should be in first week of November. I'm kind of nervous. Hope it has them.
Did you get it yet? We are waiting 😬
"if it makes you feel better, it appears like it doesn't require anything more than the updated glass and the window regulator (what holds the glass up) so it may be retrofittable"
"Lol.  I know how you feel, I am also VIN 44K.  Hopefully, the windows are the same fit and in the future if a window breaks you (or I) can get the new ones."
I’m 62k vin. Didn’t tucking get it. Triggered
is it really that bad? I just ordered a 49k VIN.
"I just got assigned a VIN in 68Ks (no delivery date yet) and based on this reddit I decided to call Tesla. I have not validated it but here is their answer: ""If your MY is 2020, it won't have double pane glass windows but if it's 2021, it will. The way you can tell is if you see ""MF"" in the middle of the VIN before the last 6 numbers start then you have 2021 model and most likely you have double pane windows."" Hope this helps and looking forward to find out in person."
I have a 62x will check next time I go out with the car and report back.
"I just checked, 624XX and no double pane, fack"
628xx and no double pane windows :(
Exact same situation
No double pane 63xxx VIN.  Build date 10/16.
"center console is the existing version, not the new version. No USB-C port that I can find in the glovebox."
"This is my first Tesla, I don't have baseline to compare against. Unsure, that's just how mine arrived."
"It’s usually referred to as “acoustic glass” on cars, and it does provide improved noise isolation. 

It’s also common to just have it on the windshield and two front windows, I guess that provides the best bang for the buck for the driver and front passenger comfort."
I think the main reason was better climate control efficiency
I think the most noise comes from wind hitting the front windshield and then coming around the mirrors which create a lot of turbulence so front side windows seem high yield.
I'd be happy to do a sound test with another model Y owner in the Denver metro
Yes just the front. Rear passenger windows are single pane.
Id totally be willing to pay for this
"The window itself would only be a few hundred. But how much thicker is this, and do you need totally different doors? And a different motor?"
"Thanks, and oooh good question. I want to say yes just from memory watching it lock from a distance. Maybe 85% sure of this. I'll have to check tomorrow."
"Very nice, hope they get all those issues fixed for ya. Enjoy your new spaceship!"
Thanks!!! Getting 642xx in a week or 2
"Front door on both sides aren't flush when closed, panel gaps aren't great but aren't awful, headlights fit isn't great either and some dried paint droplets on some edges. No deal breakers and I've already scheduled service."
Getting a 642xx In about 1-2 weeks
did yours have the double pane windows?
One minor point:  CarPlay licenses are free for vehicle manufacturers. Apple does not charge for them. It's just work for the manufacturer to support it.
Would need another older model y to compare against
Same boat
When are your delivery dates?
Only front?
I have a 60xxx Vin. Not sure if I have double pane (picked up 10/22). Attached is the identifier on the front driver side window. Can someone with double pane compare against the indentifier on their window?
Just picked up my 634xx and it does not have double pane window. Born on date was Oct 16.
Congrats!!!! Amazing news! Thanks for updating here! Still fingers crossed on my side
Any chance you know your born on date?
"awesome. mine is a little higher. hopefully it has it. 

My car has arrived at the dealership but it is offsite, SA has asked someone to check and confirm."
"Double pane windows still shatter unless they've been reinforced, which in that case it would be security glass."
"Congratz!!!!

Can you confirm if it also has the double pane?

Could you also take a picture of the black text printed on the glass? If it has an ""A"" it indicates the plastic inside is an acoustic one."
Thanks! Please report back if you have them!
Following..
Same and same
Interested in hearing as well!
No glove box usb port
Is this an update in the 3/Y? Haven’t heard of this one.
"Not present in the software, but the filter could be there. Haven't opened it up to check."
"Yes, the VIN has the M character right before the serial number"
The sill plate is actually blacked out. Don't think so on the other two things
Me too. I m picking up 628xx in 3 days. Please check yours and report back if you see it
Reverse your vin. Very close. 46. 64.
I'm 638xx
\+1 to this. this suspense is killing.
Interesting. I have a 620xx vin and my SA confirmed today that my build date was October 13th. Pick up date of 11/7. Good luck with the windows!
"You can see the two layers in the photo, separated by a third presumably filler material as opposed to a noble gas gap like you’d see on windows on a house."
this is seen as a desirable way to improve climate control efficiency and potentially (but probably not) noise reduction.
No. This is called laminated glass or acoustic glass and is a somewhat common feature on premium vehicles since it provides some improved noise isolation.
I have it!
Mine has it!
I did get it! And it has the double pane glass!
Now that is something I'd want to do
I wanna do this with my model 3 so bad...
"This representative is trying to generalize something that cannot be generalized since Tesla didn’t do a clean 2020 single pane/2021 double pane switch. My Model Y is a 2021 “MF060xxx” and it is single paned.

There are a small number of 2021 Model Ys with single pane windows. Anything with a more recent build date probably has the double paned windows."
Awesome please take a pic if possible
Same. We’re all sad. Fuck would’ve loved this in Midwest
62xxx - single pane. Delivered this last Monday.
"Same here, 636xx built 10/16 with normal glass."
[deleted]
"It’s different than acoustic glass.   That’s usually single and with a acoustic film....

Yes it’s commonly on just the front passengers on a car with this price range."
"Strange. If this is for sound dampening, you’d think they’d do all 4 side windows. Wonder why just two. Did you happen to ask Tesla? Thx for posting!"
Take my money
Yes it did
"Never knew that. Thanks!

An even bigger kick in the gut then. I’ve had my car two months and I’m on the verge of giving up on Tesla maps. It’s led me into traffic way too many times where apps like Waze would have guided me around it."
"I tried today on my MY (VIN 44xxx). The range is 67-72 db on a state route at 60-65 mph speeds. Haven't got chance to check on a freeway. I compared with my Q7, which was 69-76 on the same route. 
I used the app called sound meter in google play.

With windows closed, fans off, park mode, the sound level is 34-37."
This Saturday
"Only front. I drove 100 miles and noticed that even in full sun, I didn’t feel the heat in my arm like I do in my friends MY (55,xxx)."
SA called me today and said mine doesnt have it :( Not taking delivery; will wait for the next one in a few weeks.
"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/the-sordid-history-of-auto-safety-glass-19112

“DuPont concluded tempered glass was completely ineffective in retaining an occupant if the glass cracked in an accident. This stands in sharp contrast to laminated glass which retains great penetration resistance, even after it is cracked.” 

So basically it states that the safety glass is better for ejection protection. But obviously, does not come out of the frame and stays relatively intact. I guess you got to choose your evil. Do you want ejection protection during rollovers, or do you want easy escape during a submerged event."
"Unfortunately, my 60xxx does not have the double pane windows. But thankfully the paint and panel gaps were perfect. FWIW, I had a one hour drive on the freeway to get home and I didn’t think there was any excessive road noise at all."
There is hidden software that suggests that the HEPA filter is coming to the MY at the same time.
Negative on double pane. 628 vin
Thank you! Hopeful mine will have it too- they might have been built on the same day :)
"I texted my SA, hoping to hear back tomorrow if they know the answer. I'll let you know if/when I hear!"
Interesting indeed! You too!
Actually you usually only do it b/c of the reduction in wind and traffic noise today. The climate bonuses are just that - bonuses.
Improve climate control? Put a metal roof on. The double glass just on the front two windows won’t do squat when the cars a greenhouse.
"Awesome! Thank you, I was about to lose 2 weeks of sleep. 😜"
"Aah, thanks for clearing that up. Probably he wanted to move on to the next call real quick. :) I will find out on the day of delivery I guess then."
Sadly not on mine. But probably for the best because I plan on retrofitting wide angle mirrors. The stock ones have a disappointing viewing angle.
I didn't ask because I didn't notice the double paned windows until the morning after my delivery date :)
Happy Cake Day!
Thank you! Would you mind updating us here if you have it or not? Many thanks!
That’s good!! At least tint serves the same UV blocking purpose.
"Nice. I was unlucky in that my doors don't sit flush, my headlights are asymmetrical with paint droplets on the panels around them, and something sounds loose on the front driver's side behind the frunk.."
guess I’m SOL...625K on Tuesday..
"I'm 636xx and pickup next Tuesday, can't hardly wait. Born on 10/16. I'll report back Tuesday afternoon."
"Nothing to lose sleep over! Though I won’t lie, I could barely sleep last night 😅"
I’ll try to remember!
I pick up tomorrow! Will report back to you first. :) Mine was born the 17th.
Just picked up. It does indeed have the double pane (or whatever we’re calling it... laminated?).
"Making the switch won't be easy, coming from a big truck, I might have to invest in a second family car sometime soon but I didn't make the switch to bring cost down, it's just so I have autopilot which just makes my day easier. This will be car #13 in 9 years for me."
So...?
"I'm about 200 lower VIN number, sure am anxious now. Not that I feel like I really need the double pane but really don't want to feel like the last guy without it."
Thats great.
It will be worth it! I’m blown away by how amazing this car is. You won’t regret it. And autopilot is definitely a plus!
Wait for Cybertruck.. big truck again lol. Keep the Y also
I just got 63XXX without them
"636xx born on 10/16, no laminated glass for me..."
"Hope so, I test drove the M3 a year ago and was disappointed in the seating position, the MY seemed to be alot more comfortable. Really looking forward"
Would only get the Cybertruck if it's gets me solid 500 range.
Exact spec I (and thousands more people) have on order. Looks so very good.
"Cake cake cake! Mike D Zeeeee keeping it EZ.  

Ended up getting the inductions also for my M2M.  

Cheers and congrats!!"
Nice! Congrats. Lots of delivery today. Home delivery too.
"Mine's on order, same color and wheels too.  I'm stoked and I hope I don't get a lemon.

I just picked up my charger today."
Did you spot any quality issues?  Looks beautiful by the way.
"Do you have the performance or are your door handles blacked out?

I wanna black mine out when i get our MY delivery"
Get the tints on front windows! Matches the look of tires so good
"I just ordered this same exact one minutes ago. 

I think your photo made me just go for it. 

Did you have any interest in boost/performance model at all? What made you decide on this one?"
"We got ours Sat and it’s the same spec as yours. Tesla was so busy on delivering cars for the quarter that we had to go to the Tesla service center in Dublin California to pick it up. Catch this the Tesla Rep said they had 250 pickups sat alone. The ‘temp’ employee basically gave us the key card, could not answer questions, and said call Tesla. That was a bit of a let down. Car is sure fun to drive!0"
"Nope. Overall super happy. Only thing I might take it in for is the charging latch isn’t PERFECTLY flush with car. But honestly if I wasn’t looking for it, I prob wouldn’t have noticed it."
Chrome delete is stock on the Y. I didn’t do anything to this.
It’s def on my to do list.
are those the 20” induction wheels?
Yes. 20” inductions
"Blue Model Y named Mookie? Lets check the username... LADojerz...yeah I know where you got that name! Congrats!

Edit: Lets go Dodgers!"
Congrats. We have the same blue Y and red 3.
Love it! Go Dodgers!
"I’m probably doing myself a disservice by asking this question, but what was your order date? I’ve got a blue/white interior on order, and it’s taking forever. :("
Dope. How long did it take you to choose a color
"I am deciding between the Y and 3, would love to hear your perspective on their differences and how that impacts how you use them?"
Shame the way Detroit stole the Dodgers D.
Ha my kid named our future cyber truck Mookie!
"I think, I THINK he might be a Dodgers fan."
Lol! Correct!
Aug 19th.
4 seconds due to the internet lag.
Mookie? I’m guessing about 2 seconds.
"Everyone has their own perspective on this hot topic. Honestly, they both drive amazing and have the same functionality. We chose the Y over another 3 because of the extra cubic space you get. The extra range was a benefit as well. The question to ask yourself is spending an extra $10-15k worth it to choose the Y over the 3."
Go Rays !!!
"Umm, as a Red Sox fan, we got you recently, if you've forgotten, but I'm now ready to say Go Dodgers. Sort of, kind of like. Uhhg. You can't treat Mookie bad, not that you would or could, but he's our baby. Congrats on the Y/3."
Thanks! Sounds like others are debating the same things as I am. I appreciate your perspective. Might as well get both haha.
"But did you pound on the glass to break the ice, wipe a little snow off with a broom, try to use the iced on windshield wipers, and try to drive with summer performance tires? lol!"
"Took her up to Steamboat Springs, CO for a couple days. No range anxiety here with all the amazing supercharger stations!"
Any idea how much the cold affected your range on the drive?
How’s the efficiency with the roof rack? What’s the wh/mi? Great looking car
We all need to know how much this heat pump helps.
"What is the range decrease % in the winter compared to your regular use? 

Please tell us about Winter Range 

Btw nice setup.... I’m really indecisive as to how to setup my MY but I’m gonna roll with the PUP white, this is too nice"
"I have 20” inductions with the Goodyear AS tires and drove about 12 miles today running errands in Boston/Cambridge. There was around 2” of snow but most streets were plowed clear.  Outside temps were around 34-37 degrees and used 12% battery / 7-8kwh. 

I averaged around 385 wh/mi. 

Temp was set between 70-72 and had my seat heater on at level 1."
"That new Kremmling charger makes a huge difference.  Before that, I would make sure my car spent some quality time at the level 2 chargers around town and at the resort."
"Damn, that’s sexy"
PPF?
"What tires are those, the stock Goodyear’s?"
How do the induction tires perform in cold/snow?.
Daam those bugs on you front bumper.... how much time it took to clean?
*EV Dave has entered the chat*
Lol I just got done watching his video like 20 minutes ago
You forgot his trusty metal ruler to scrap the ice off.  No worries he has ceramic coating on.
Who...?
Are those the tires that came with the car? Should be taking delivery Nov 8 and I’m wondering will the stock tires work in NYS or should I get snow tires
I lost like 40 miles
It didn’t seem too bad but I didn’t pay too much attention. I just let the nav tell me which supercharger stations I needed to stop at.
Roof rack has been fine. I read something about a 1% efficiency loss. I didn’t have the car for long enough without to tell the difference.
So far 30 seems like 90 in terms of range loss. Curious how it goes below this...
They are badly needed in the Montrose / Cortez / Pagosa corridor too.
Yeah it was a really convenient stop. 250kw too!
Just on the front bumper. I recently put sealant on the whole car so hopefully that added some extra salt/mud protection.
They look like the goodyears
Yes the stock Goodyears. They did fine in light snow.
They have been fine! Not snow tires by any means but I have not had any issues.
Haha good eye. Thankfully I have PPF on the front so the bugs come off real easily! I did a basic spray down with a pressure washer after coming down the mountain. I haven’t done a full detail yet since I’m expecting more snow within the week.
"Yeah, forgot about that and make sure you get the snow off your shoes/boots by kicking the door sill as hard as you can!"
"In NYS. Car comes with all season. Though, I have winters on. Once you go winter you don’t go back."
"Yes, the Goodyear all seasons that came with the 20” induction wheels."
At what temperature?
That’s great to know. Thanks for the reply.
What winter tires did u go with?
27.. someone else said I should preheat it before
"I got the same as my Audi. Bought from tirerack.com.

255/40R-20 PIRELLI WINTER SOTTOZERO 3 AO AUDI XL"
Ah.. around -3 Celsius. Yeah would be very interesting to find out if there’s a big difference if you preheat before the trip.

Ok I was looking at these last night..at this point it probably makes sense to order and ask that they be put on at time of delivery lol
Hah. Yea. I had a mobile truck come mount and balance. It was awesome.
"Love the look! I have TST’s in my garage, same size, same tire for winter. Since I’m still waiting on delivery, did you happen to notice how long it took before the car detected and calibrated the TPMS? Also do the tires and wheels feel pretty balanced? 

Thanks for sharing the photos! Looks awesome."
"I like those 20"" TSS wheels. Is that a standard winter tire/wheel package they offer? Mind linking if you have it?

Also, did you swap them yourself? (looking at the jack)"
What kind of range do you get with the new wheels?
i think tsportline makes the best tesla rims. they look so damn good
"Whoa! I have the exact same look, except white interior and the 19"" TSS tires. Near twins!

https://imgur.com/a/IhiJ2q3/"
If this can help I got another set of TPMS sensors (original Tesla) for my winter tire. It took a few KMs to detect. Around 10 minutes of driving lets say.
Still happy with getting your MY in white? Or was there a color you regret not getting?
"So I went into the settings and calibrated for 20 vs 21s and it rebooted the car.  After about 10 minutes or so the tire pressure started to show.  So far they feel pretty balanced, they did seem to make some vibration noises around 60 when I went on first ride but seems to have warmed up now and sounds/rides great."
"So the package I got came with the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3 which was listed second on the tires list/price but looks like now it is replaced by the pirelli p zero all seasons.  I swapped them myself which was easy, I ordered some of those pucks off Amazon for the jack and was good to go.

"I went from estimated high 250s to around high 270s.  I had also just got the update, but I also have a lead foot.  I could probably get better range but so far so good."
"This helps in my case, appreciate the insight!"
I love the white pearl to be honest. I came from a black Mercedes previously and I feel this is much easier to keep clean.  I originally wanted the MSM but when going to test drive the white stood out the most in person.  I like the grey wheels but I have to say I like the matte black wheels the better at this point.
"How are you liking the as3+ on the Y?     I'm trying to decide what tires to put on the 20"" wheels sitting in my garage."
"Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.
Here's a copy of

Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)"
"I like them really good so far.  Haven’t got to test them in any kind of bad weather yet, but I’m sure will get to soon."
"[Here is the link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MYDXD43/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_tjkJFbFP0CTNG) for the air mattress on Amazon. $60

I had thought about cutting up a memory foam mattress, but this folds down to such a small size. The memory foam mattress would take up so much space. 

This can fit in the wheel hub storage in the trunk area. 

Filling was a breeze. Versatility of sleeping arrangements is a great feature too. 

A super solid pick for camping."
What are the dimensions? Looking on Amazon at the product and I am not finding it.
Same one I just used to go camping. Love it comes with the pump to inflate and deflate
Got my air mattress at Walmart for $6.87 and it has done great for a few years now
What do you do for the gap where your head goes? (Gap behind front seats)
Just ordered.  thanks for the link.  Happy camping
"The only negative experience I've had with it is when I laid my phone on the mattress just inside the driver side back door as I was getting in, then launched the phone right out the door and on to the asphalt when I got in and put my weight on the mattress. (Yeah, it broke. At the beginning of my Yellowstone trip. And it's also my camera.)"
I don’t ever go camping but I want to go camping in my Tesla. I don’t know why.
How comfy is it?
Comes with a 12V inflator as well. Love mine.
"76x51.2x4.7 inches

A Queen is 80x60"
You can click the link I provided in my first comment. 👍
"The deflate option was interesting to me. I’ve always just pulled the black plug out as well. 

Neat option to have though. ✌️"
How well does it fit in the back of your Model Y?
I’m just planning on using a pillow to keep it propped up.
Just move the front seats back a bit.
"Excellent. Lmk if you are as happy with it as I am. 

I know it’ll get a lot of use here."
Oh dang it! Bad luck for sure.
Its part of the addiction. I had to talk myself into a $90 hotel room (with an EV charger) on a recent outing.
"😂

We can use it for the kids in the summer. They are going to watch movies on the screen end camp overnight. 

I think this will get us to actually camp a bit more now too."
"My dog and I have done a couple of test run nights in the driveway, and I also slept in it in Yellowstone one night. Very good experiences all in all. And it's also cool to think that as long as I have the time, on any given day I can just take off and not have to worry about hotel reservations or anything."
"I'm used to thin ultralight air pads for hiking, and this thing is 10 times better. It's not as good as a good memory foam mattress, but I sleep just fine on it, and I'm a side sleeper who usually has issues with my hip and shoulder digging into the ground on air mattresses."
I don’t see it being an issue for a night. It’s an air mattress. It works.
Yep. That’s why I got it. Easy peasy.
Thank you!
I see the packaging dimensions of 15x10 but I am not seeing the full dimensions anywhere.
Then you lose that precious head space!
Argh!
"Sorry. My apologies. 

I don’t see them listed there either. 

All I can tell you is that it fits the Model Y."
"Just enough to snug up to the top of the air mattress ""pillows."" Hard to describe what I mean, but it works perfectly.  


It's also nice to have an extra pillow or two to shove down between the mattress ""pillows"" and the back doors. Just kind of keeps arms from falling down there and feels more secure."
"Thanks for sharing your experience. I was been debating between 2020 Q5 vs MY myself but last night I pulled the trigger on MY. Awaiting VIN etc. 
There is so much out there (positive/negative) that sometime you get overwhelmed. Reading your experience gave me calmness. 
Now I have to sort out the charging situation. I am thinking for the dedicated wall charger since I'll be putting 90miles in daily commute. However there is plenty of 120v outlets at work where I can easily charge for 9-10 hrs. Not sure which direction to lean."
Great summary! Where did you take delivery? I’m curious how far you have to be from the factory for them to put on protective film.
"I'm not sure if I'm in the majority, but initially I found the regenerative braking to be too much (first time EV), but after getting use to it I now find it to not be enough. I always keep my car charged between 40-80%."
"Great write up! Thanks for sharing

For Regen braking it is dependent on state of charge. How much are you charging your battery up to?

Also it depends on temperature so if the battery has been sitting all night on a cold night you will have significantly reduced Regen until it warms up."
"Nice write up, thanks for sharing!"
"Pretty much spot on with what I have experienced. love the MY, very few issues and I do not have any regrets."
"Awesome! I take delivery tomorrow and I'm excited. I also plan to document my experience as well, just to add to the wealth of knowledge we're all sharing for other prospective Model Y owners."
"Mine had few issues in the beginning. After 2500 miles, shit is starting to fall apart and it’s throwing a rattle parade. Newest issue, passenger side window speaker became dislodged because whatever was holding it broke."
How many miles (approximately) do you get from a “full” battery? Anything close to the estimated >300 or is that just wishful thinking?
You will learn the difference in regen available when you have 3 limited regen dots vs 12. It's useful you get a metric for how much regen is avilable!
"Thanks for the write up! I'm also currently in a Q5 and waiting on a MY. I'm not a big fan of my Q5, so unless the MY is a POS, I'll be more than happy.

Question - do you find it annoying to have to go through the screen for literally \*everything\*? AC vents, wipers, seat heat, etc, etc. Everything is at least 2 actions away. Sounds silly, but I was a UX (web) designer in a previous life, so things like this still bother me. :)"
"Thank you.
There's lots of posts like yours out there, but I think the more there are, the more accurately people like me can see the statistical spread of user experience and have realistic expectations.
I placed my order last night and am just about to burst with anticipation."
"Hey would love to see another post on just accessories, if you have a bunch. Like usb hub/ssd for sentry mode, the vinyl wrap, floor mats, etc. if you bought a bunch."
"Coming from a Lexus, look out? That would be me.. Please explain"
"Congrats!  Hope your process goes smoothly and you love your new Y.

Charging is a bit of a personal choice, but for what it's worth, I might suggest you do the same as I did.  That is:

* Get a 50A circuit with a NEMA 14-50 outlet put in your garage
* Order the 14-50 adapter to attach to the mobile charger that comes with the car.  This will be good for about 30 miles of range per charge hour.  So for your average daily use, only about three hours of charging.  The car has a handy feature for charging where you tell it what time you want to leave and what level of charge you want, and it will start when it needs to overnight.
* This saves the $500 for the dedicated wall charger.

You can still use the mobile charger at work if you want, but expect only about 4 miles of range per hour off of 120.  So you will still need additional charging at home."
"I'm in Columbus, OH.  I am unsure what policies they have around transport and protection.  I do know that some cars go out by rail to central drop off points (in my case Chicago?) and then trucked the rest of the way.  

Paint is often called out as an issue on Tesla's, but after taking home, washing and then detailing it myself.... I found it was in good shape.  Now the trick is keeping it that way :)."
"I think we are similar then. I also was surprised at first, but now I like it and feel ""disappointed"" when I have to use the regular brakes (if that makes any sense at all).

I also charge up only to 75-80% as I have a pretty short commute and can charge each night easily.  Biggest regen factor for me has been lower temps recently.  This can be offset by ""preconditioning"" the car in the morning before leaving.  This not only warms the cabin but brings the temp up in the battery.  Still though, in my experience it is somewhat reduced on the colder mornings.  Will be interesting to see when we are truly in winter."
Which isn't unique to Tesla either. I drive a Spark EV (hoping to order a Y in the spring) and it's the same way. Freaked me out at first because I thought the system had failed. I love one peddle driving though!
Congrats and good luck!  I hope it goes very smoothly.
"Sorry to hear that, that's super frustrating.  I will keep an eye (and ear) open to see if I start getting the same issues."
"That's tougher to answer than it should be.  From what I can tell, the magic energy usage number to get full range is around 250wh/m.  Might be slightly lower after the range bump.  So... Like a gas car, much depends how you drive it and other environmental conditions.  For the last week, going back and forth to work, no ""spirited"" driving, I have been averaging right around that 250 mark.  So I should see a bit over 300 miles if that stayed true.  However.... On a highway trip, at 75 mph, 3 adults in the car, some ""spirited"" driving.... I was like 330, which would fall well short of 300 miles.

I think being realistic, I wouldn't plan for more than 275 miles unless you are conciously driving in a conservative way."
"Quite true!  I am developing a feel for the ""available regen"" line.  I pay attention to where the solid line ends under the ""PRND"" indicator as a visual reference.  I find braking force is pretty decent if the solid line reaches the ""N"" or further left (if that makes sense)."
"Keep in mind you can use voice commands for a lot of stuff to avoid clicking through menus.

“Wipers to 4”

“Temp to 68”

“Make it warmer”

“Increase fan speed”

“AC to auto”

“Back seat heater to medium”

“Take me to the corner of Main Street and Maple Drive”

“Where’s the closest supermarket?”

“Play Bohemian Rhapsody”

“Play some classical music”"
"At the beginning, yes, I felt it was a bit cumbersome.  However, with use I have found that many actions can be done without going deep into a menu.  AC temp, seat heater, mm usic volume, all can be done from main menu.  Wipers I leave on auto and use the button on the end of the left stalk if I need to initiate.  So I think that with some practice it becomes quite manageable."
It gets worse. I pick mine up tomorrow and the feeling is pretty intense.
That's great!  I hope you also have a good experience.  I think the Model Y is getting better all the time.  Even my car already had the updated rear tail light assembly and it has only been out six months.
"Like a bunch of people here, I started buying accessories pretty much the minute after I placed my order.  So that's a good idea to put something together on that as well.  Thanks for the suggestion!"
"Sorry, I was being a bit tongue in cheek with that comment.  What I was referring to was the difference in driving feel.  The Lexus, being a very nice luxury car tends to have a softer suspension and a lighter steering feel.  The MY will seem a bit harsh in comparison."
"I'll +1 this. Even if you eventually want the wall charger, you'll only be out a few bucks for the 1450 outlet, and the rest will work great for the wall charger. There is almost no down side to starting with the 1450 and putting in a wall charger later."
Thanks for the info
"Haha ya, when you get to the stop sign or red light and realize u need to press the brake a bit to get it to stop in time. I always think to myself, ""wasn't the regen brake stronger before?"""
"Does the spark give you any kind of indication of this?

At least with the Tesla there is a bar near the speedometer that lets you know how much Regen you have available."
"Yah.. under 30 or 35, it doesn't need much regen.  When going 45 or 55, it matters a LOT how much regen is left."
Ah okay... ty for the insight.. hopefully I’ll be happy as you and I am making the right decision. Not sure space wise if I’ll be happy as I have two kids and i am coming from a RX.
Just be aware that to get full power out of a Wall Connector; you’ll need a 60 amp breaker (50 amp used for 14-50)  and higher (lower number) gage wire.
"Not at all, still catches me by surprise that first cold fall morning. And it should be noted that the Spark is charged 100% every night due to the battery size limitations. Having an indicator would be nice."
"I had the same concerns about space coming from a Q5.  However, now I think the space isn't a problem, the additional space in the lower trunk and the frunk definitely adds up.  Takes perhaps a bit more space planning than just having a large trunk area behind the second row."
I’ve heard this about upsizing the wire to get faster charging but am struggling with the concept. When you plug in how does the car know what size wire is supplying the outlet?  Do you need to tell the car what rate the outlet can support and if you are wrong the house burns down?  I would think the NEMA 14-50 adapter would tell the Tesla cord what it is plugged into and Tesla would only charge at one max rate to go with one max rate for the outlet. Of course upsizing the wire for added safety buffer is fine but I don’t understand how one outlet type can have two current ratings.
Thank you for summing it up for me. Congrats and good luck with your new ride.
"I just had my wall connector installed the other day. There's an option in the setup to choose the power source - in my case was a 50 amp since I also have a 14-50 outlet. So when you choose that option, it'll automatically regulate the power going to your vehicle."
I have a question about the wrap. Do you know if there’s a difference between getting a dark satin wrap grey vs getting a xpel satin paint protection over a MSM colored car?  Thanks.
"Very nice!

I ordered the same one....waiting for the VIN number. But without the wrap. :)"
Looks great. Wish this was a stock color.
"Oooo, this is exactly what I was thinking of getting for my MSM. How much was it?"
"The XPEL is thicker and offers some protection against scratches and rock chips.  It’s self healing so scratches that don’t completely penetrate the film can be rubbed out by pouring hot water on it or leaving it out in the sun.  Disadvantage is that being thicker, it can be harder to wrap perfectly around certain surfaces like the side mirrors for instance. 

The grey vinyl wrap is thinner than XPEL and doesn’t offer the same kind of protection.  But being thinner it wraps more easily around the more difficult surfaces so it can look a little nicer than the XPEL.  Plus it’s cheaper."
"Got it done by Dreamwork Customs in City of Industry, California. Smaller, newer shop that does fantastic work. Paid about $3300 for the full wrap, Ceramic coating, and our center console."
Thanks!
Thanks!
"How long did it take for them to do it? Just checked them out on IG, this is the exact same color I’m wanting to do on my MY 🤞🏾"
Did you wrap the center console? Is that a thing? I’m outta the loop
"This is PPF correct, not vinyl?"
"Carson is a great guy. He’ll take good care of you and communicates well. Mine took 5 days, and he was kind enough to send over pictures during the process."
Yea lots of people don’t like the glossy black finish because it gets dirty so easily. I bought a kit for like $20 and wrapped mine. Highly recommend.
is this ppf or vinyl?
"It's an amazing way to camp!

I did a 5 day 2500 km trip with my dog through Sweden in April this year. At the time I have had my Model S for about a year but we never got any real winter in south of Sweden and I really wanted to test the car in snow ... and wanted to take my dog for some awesome walks.

So we pandemic-packed the car so we had everything we needed for the entire trip and when we went along. Took one major stop at a Swedish national park every way, where we'd explore and hike for as long as he could, then he'd curl up in a ball on the back seat while I drove. Picked fantastic camping spots along the way, where we'd open the trunk like that in the morning, to enjoy the sunset. Always picked remote spots so he could just jump out and run around.

The only ""civilization"" stops we did, was at super chargers. I disinfected all the stalls while we charged up :)

Such a memorable trip"
"Went camping this weekend for the first time in the Y using the Tesmat. A little firm but still comfortable, plus I love how well it fits in the sub-trunk with even some room to spare.

[Even the little one had a great time watching the sun rise](https://imgur.com/UJmnI2k)"
How do you find a location to do this? What’s the right term to google? Me and my wife are going insane being trapped inside with the kids for months here due to the pandemic.
Do you guys have major range anxiety when camping? Especially if you drive off the beaten path?
Can you share the overnight settings for the vehicle to stay comfortable? Camp mode? How did you deal with the screen being on? How much of your range went down?
2500 km is 1553.43 miles
I love this photo. These stories really inspire me to finally go on the long road trip I’ve always want to. Can’t wait for my Y to come in.
"""free dispersed camping near me"""
"Not sure where you're located but I just searched for camping near different locations I thought might be nice. We camped at Washburn Campground in San Simeon. With the pandemic and having a baby in the middle of it, we've been overly cautious and this was the first ""normal"" thing we've done in a long time. Felt great."
I was a little worried about camp mode since the campsite didn't have any power hookup but I found that it only used about 1% per hour which ended up being totally manageable.
"Not OP, but: Camp mode (easiest way is just press the right steering wheel button and say ""turn on camp mode""). You can either put the display in screen cleaning mode and it'll stay mostly black (there's a button in the Display menu), or just lay a shirt or something over the screen. You can use the Tesla app on your phone to control climate, etc. while you're in the back. In my experience (and it wasn't cold any time I've done it), I've lost between 1 and 2 miles per hour of camp mode."
Good bot
"I took my Y on a 4,100-mile round trip a few weeks ago. I could not be more pleased."
Did you mostly stay at campgrounds or just find a remote spot to park in?
"Informative, thank you."
"Haven’t tried it yet but due to the screen staying on, what about not using camp mode and instead use the climate ‘on’ setting? Does that keep the screen on?"

"How was autopilot! Did you also have FSD? I’m planning a Texas to Cali (with Arizona, Utah, Vegas in between) road trip. Don’t know if it’s too ambitious but I’d love to spend a couple days camping in my car just like the above img!!"
FSD was awesome. The car drive 99+% of the time. Autopilot alone would have been almost as good.
I’m holding off on FSD but gosh now I want it.
"Nice! If you don't mind me asking, how much was the PPF and did you just get the front done?"
"I’m doing the front full hood, full bumper and mirrors next week and this is estimated at 1500 in Chicago. Full front is 2k."
We got the ppf right after the dealership as well. We were gonna be driving 3 hours back home and wanted to avoid the paint getting damaged !
Have any of you PPF'd the headlights as well?
Is there any value in getting ppf if you're leasing?
Nice clean job!!!✨
"Nice!

Out of curiosity, what were the minor issues they fixed?"
Johnny is the man.
In Florida we did the whole car with ceramic coating for $4500
But.... The Model Y comes with front and back bumper PPF already - take a good look! 🤔
[Here are the prices I got in Maryland] (https://photos.app.goo.gl/KScmnWT8cbDvgAhf6)
"Hey man sorry for the late response. 
I only got the full front end cost was 2200 for 8mm.  Full hood, Fenders, grill, mirrors.  The ceramic coating cs2 titanium hard was 1200 full car."
"I got my first quote for $1950 for the full front here in northern CA, so that sounds about right."
"I live in Chicago as well, and looking to do the same. Which place are you taking yours?"
I just felt paranoid might ass we’ll get a little peace of mind!
How long did it take to get the ppf done?
I got it done. It was a precut piece
Headlights were included with my full front end.
I personally wouldn’t. Feels more like something you do if you are keeping the car long term. The dealer knows they will get leases back with rock chips.
"Most were fixed. I was in a rush during pickup so didn’t get the chance to go a great review of the car. The charge port cover is still misaligned pretty bad. I just made another service appointment and they are coming to my house. 
I also had 3 paint Nibs ( speck of dirt under your paint from the factory) you can tell when you PPF the car. I chose not to get it fixed because I didn’t want some techs messing up my paint for a little spot not noticeable for most people. 
All and all i am happy with the car."
Yes he is!
Great deal!
Where did you see that?
Man it’s to late for me to check now!  Hopefully someone else can confirm this. You saying the whole front bumper has PPPF or just the bottom portion.
Following!
"No worries! It looks great, digging the white/black"
i didn't do the fenders because i don't think they'll really be impacted considering how wide the hood and bumper is
Chicago Auto Pros. Kind of expensive so I might go somewhere else to do Tint and Ceramic in the future
I would recommend taking it to umbra tinting in Schaumburg if you don’t mind traveling a bit. Full front should be About 1.5k
They did it in like a day because they knew we were from out of town and were trying to help us out. We only did the front but are actually getting the back covered now with a different company and they are going to take about 2 days.
2 days. Check out Detailership if you are in norther Ca
And it didn't mess up with the light refraction. (I think that's the word)
"Yeah, that was my thinking as well.  Thanks for the input!"
Just got our MY Full front PPF and the whole body titanium Ceramic done by Johnny! A+ job
"Picked up MY at the end of August - vin in 35Xxx range - doing full 3m wrap - folks were complaining bumpers looked slightly off in certain lighting on white paint. While wrapping I looked closely at the edges of bumpers, PPF film is there. Look for yourself!"
"It is  the ""off"" color part - so whole front and back bumper that seems to shift color in different light"
"Thanks, that's where I was thinking of taking mine too. Overall are you happy with the job they did?"
Ah yeah. It wasn’t. Thank you.
"Yea, not worth it at all.   Depending on the states, you can return leased car with damages in paint that can be covered by a credit card without penalty.

Good call."
"I literally just sent my car for a front PPF today for $1800, I get it back tomorrow"
I actually see the little lines for some type of film on the rear bumper. As far as the color being off on the bumpers that is a common thing with white because its made of plastic and will always have a different look. I have a good friend that is a tech at tesla I will ask see what I can find out.  thanks for sending me down this rabbit hole hahah!
I haven't done it yet. PPF is next week and then idk when ill do tin or ceramic;
"Same is on the front bumper, I suspect the color is the same but PPF reflects slightly differently."
Literally submitting my order tomorrow. Guess I seriously need to go through that 70 point checklist or whatever lol
"Just talked to Tesla chat, they informed me that orders that were already placed will honor the 7 day policy, but new orders will not."
"All the more reason to reject cars even if the issues are minor.

Really losing my faith in Tesla in terms of reliability, fit & finish, and customer support/service."
"Seems to me like they no longer feel a need to generate goodwill/peace of mind in order to secure sufficient orders. They are overbooked and can afford to be shitty like everyone else. 

I do wonder though if someone (or some org) with lots of free cash might try to stitch them up.   Order a ton of vehicles, give them all back just to screw with the policy.  They were certainly exposed cost wise/risk wise with this policy. As ridiculous it might be."
"I'm just going to assume that they are removing this policy due to high rate of returns on the Model Y.

This is not a policy that you remove if you have any confidence in your product."
"If true, I plan to be extra diligent at my delivery, with a hair trigger on rejection."
A bad link seems a quick jump to a policy change. Was the lingo removed on any pages?
"That’s not really good customer service, seems the more money Tesla is getting, the stingier they get. Hardcore Tesla fans will defend this change somehow."
"I have never heard it discussed, but does Tesla allow you to test drive your vehicle on delivery?"
Yikes. This is kind of indefensible given the number of (thankfully mostly minor) issues model Y are still showing up with.
"Sad to hear this. I love my Y. I pre ordered it and had to get it shipped to me (5 hours from SC that sold it due to taxes) but never would have without the 7 day return policy. I'm 1 hour from SC for fixing but if I got delivered one with major issues I would have wanted the option to return it. 

I just think that going forward, I would probably not buy one since I don't have a way to test the one I would actually be buying. Kind of sad because I love this car so much."
"I suspect they just got inundated with calls from people that just took delivery of a new model 3, only to see an improved one just get released and now they want THAT one instead.  That's not a good enough reason to accept it back IMO."
Interesting question now is anyone who previously returned do they need to wait the year for same trim?
"With no 7 day return policy, I would not be a Tesla owner. 

I couldn't get a test drive (I don't live in a city with a sales centre so the first appointment available was over a month away and I had to travel, during a pandemic, to a hotter-spot than home - no thank you.)

Because of the return policy, I had my MY 2 weeks before the proposed test drive appointment. I could then make sure it fit us (I had seen the interior of a locally owned MY and talked to the owner but had not sat in one or driven in one.) 

The idea that you have to buy a car, sight unseen, untested, is ridiculous. The cancellation of refund policy, I suppose works in cities with sales centres. Outside of that, it does not work at all and will slow the spread of Tesla ownership across Canada for sure. (I don't live in a backwater, I live in a city of over 1 million and enough Tesla owners to warrant a service centre, but no sales centre.)"
Uhohhh
Including cybertruck orders?
"Whew, good thing I ordered last week, even though I told them not to match me till Feb"
"Same..... took my delivery about 1 month ago. So far I have issues with the touch screen, different parts of the car not assembled well, and now they fucked up my financing. I can tell that everyone working in customer facing positions are trying their best, but Tesla management is making it hard for them."
Huh most people have no issues and if they do they have free service appointments as long as it's under warranty.
"Reminder that Elon Musk, the guy who is all over social media and will say anything, never addressed the people who’s roof fell off their Model Y."
What other auto manufacturer had or still has such a return policy?
"Same.  My threshold for accepting car is going to be much, much higher without the 7-day window."
"That's what I did and I don't regret it at all. If I have to wait for Tesla to get their shit together, I  will. Especially with competitors like the Mach-E, ID.4, etc. coming in the next year or two."
"Was mentioned on the purchase pages previously, but also removed from there.

A few of the EV Blogs supposedly confirmed this information from Tesla, but no official statement has been made."
It’s not about how much money they’re getting. It’s about a growing public company and increasing pressure from shareholders to squeeze profits.
For all the work that goes into make and delivering the cars. I don’t blame. I can’t buy a home and take ownership just to return it in 7 days
"Good question. I would assume so but I don't know the answer. When I went to get my car I drove it around and came back and signed the paper work but my advisor was like ""I didn't know you left!"" So not sure."
"I don't think so. The way my delivery center (Buena Park, CA) was set up did not allow for you to repark in their delivery section. HOWEVER I did manage to drive off, and then circle back right away because the wooden dash panel was NOT snapped in. They took care of that right away which was great."
You still have a warranty and these minor issues are fixed easily.
From what I recall the 7 day policy was when Tesla briefly attempted to go to a no showroom model. I guess since they gave upon that it makes sense to get rid of it eventually.
">due to taxes

How does this work?"
"As it states above, this change wouldn't apply to any of those people at all, though. New orders from today on."
"As it states above, this change wouldn't apply to any of those people at all, though. New orders from today on."
"Not sure, good question to ask Tesla Chat."
A deposit for reservation is not the same as an order.    There are no orders for a cyber truck right now.
I would also get it in writing from your service advisor just in case. Always good to have it on record since it is not listed on their website.
My experience so far has been 1 rejection because the Model Y's windows were not functioning properly. I'll certainly update when my second one comes - praying it's perfect!
This truly does not get enough press. Whole place seems to be going to shit
Because it was a scam.
What other automaker doesn’t go through qc of their own or have dealers go through qc and iron out cars before presenting them to their customers? What other automaker doesn’t let you test drive the actual vehicle you will be buying new?
"Yeah, I want the Y, and I want it soon. But I don't need the Y. If I have to reject several times, that is much better than living with issues for a car this expensive."
Interesting for sure. Going to make accepting delivery REALLY important.
"Not only are homes way more expensive, you don’t buy a home without a professional inspection from both sides."
Buying a home is wayyyy more in-depth and picky than buying a car. Not a legitimate comparison in any way shape or form.
"That's not a fair comparison, a home vs a car."
[deleted]
Yeah they don't let you test drive your own car. Also have BP as my service center. It seems like they're improving their customer support!
Tesla SC refused to fix over half of my minor ussues.
Interesting! I thought there was always a 7 day return. I would be fine with it if I could test drive the actual car i would be buying.
"I live in New Hampshire and there is no sales tax. So you would think all Massachusetts residents would just but their cars in New Hampshire, but the rule is you pay your sales tax when you register a vehicle. So a MA resident buying a car in NH, just pays his MA tax, and I would pay my NH tax (which is zero) when I register. 

But let's say I buy a TV in MA, I pay regular MA tax. And if a MA resident drove to NH and bought a TV they pay no tax.

However with Tesla I was told if I get the car from a MA showroom I would pay tax, as it isn't a dealership. I don't really understand why that matters or why the law works that way. 

So NH residents buy it from NJ and for whatever reason (that I don't understand) I don't have to pay NJ sales tax. 

I'm sure I'm missing some of the why, but that was how it was explained to me!  😀"
"They're not going to stop improving the cars. Think we can all agree that's a good thing. 

Going forwards: Gotta be happy with the product as ordered at the time of the order and hope for software updates."
You could have just gotten it fixed.
Explain?
Not what I asked.
You can test drive a Tesla...
No doubt. I get annoyed having to just go in for regular oil changes on my current vehicle. No way I'd take something that needs immediate service appointments.
"Yeah this just made me 100% sure that I'll be fully testing everything in my Model Y come delivery day. I don't care if it takes 2 hours, not gonna sign anything until it's fully checked out."
"Tesla has been skirting lemon laws by reporting repairs as ""good will"" vs warranty. So be cautious if your plan is to go the lemon law route when you are choosing to reject delivery or not"
"Yup, the ""no cooling off"" provision."
"Yeah, but at least normal cars, you can negotiate the price. The only reason why Tesla doesn’t use dealers is so Elon doesn’t have to share the money, not because of any customer conveniences."
">It seems like they're improving their customer support!

By sheer force of will of the CS staff. I felt so bad for everyone there since you can tell they were under pressure to get out Q3 delivery numbers but the cars have issues here and there. Doesn't help that QC isn't emphasized as much as it should be for the price tag of a Y."
There is a limit to the nitpicking at some point. Nobody else is looking at your car with a magnifying glass.
Yeah they only added it last year (https://electrek.co/2019/02/28/tesla-is-changes-entire-sales-strategy-makes-sales-online-only-closes-stores-w-layoffs/) but I definitely wouldn't buy one if I couldn't at least test drive that model. Most of the QA issues at least don't seem to effect the actual driving.
"Problem is I rolled it into service and even after re-calibrating the windows, they had no idea what was causing it. I never even drove it more than 500ft. It could have been a symptom of a larger issue. No one should be selling, much less paying for a brand new car that's not working properly from the factory. 

Would you accept a tv that came with dead speakers out of the box, just because it was a cool new type of TV?"
"Shortseller attack on Tesla, happens regularly. It was the same with the water in the door."
That’s not what I said. Test drive the exact car that you’ll be purchasing
i switched from merc c class. Bloody oil change cost $560. I am happy switching to tesla
"that is more an accounting item? Does not matter if something is goodwill or warranty. None of the wording ""good will"" is used for the lemon law case. Just how many times you had to return for a defect to be repaired."
💯
"But you can do that if you arrange it. When I test drove a 3, one guy bought the actual car next to me. But also when you place a custom order from any other manufacturer, you're doing the same thing tesla does. Test drive one, then order one with the exact trim you want."
"Dang. I've had my current RAV4 for 12 years. I paid <$2k for lifetime oil changes, and that has been *amazing*. The Y I have on order will be better, but this has been pretty good."
"Goodwill repairs implies the vehicle is too old to be covered under warranty. Ultimately you *should* win a lemon law case despite that, but Tesla has ensured it will be as difficult as possible to discourage people."
"The model 3 is supposed to be a mass market car, but I guess it's a custom order.

Anyways, if you can test drive the exact car you want, that is definitely not widely known: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/iv1szf/test\_drive\_before\_accepting\_delivery/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/iv1szf/test_drive_before_accepting_delivery/)"
"That might discourage some people from pursuing a case if they don't consult a lawyer, but it's not really going to make much of a difference once a case is filed."
"I guess I should clarify what exactly happened. It wasn't a prearranged purchase. The guy came in for a test drive and said he wanted to buy it and take it home. Perhaps it's not something they do often, but they did it that day for that guy"
Ah I see. That’s a cool service that they provided them then. That does sound much more like what a traditional dealer would do. I wonder if supply of cars will ever reach that point that you can buy cars off the lot. In the meantime having a return policy makes sense in lieu of.
I’ve got it installed already. I love this car.
Ah so as I suspected. The new model 3/y doesn’t have  improved battery density or a larger battery but instead Tesla likely just refined some of their epa modifiers even more.
"Curious how much range the FULL battery pack can give us.

Is 350 a likely outcome for the Y? 375? 

Not using the new battery pack, just the one currently installed."
Ahh yes! Can’t wait to get this
"So I got 2020.40.3 a few days ago -- was anyone who got the 2020.40.7 update already on 2020.40.3, or were they going up directly from a 2020.36.x?

Very excited about this -- going for a lot of trips up in the Catskills visiting friends where Superchargers are fairly far away from where we staying"
Still haven’t got this yet
Is there anyone getting this for 3?
"What does refined epa modifiers mean? 

Like did they actually make improvements to real life range? Or just realized they can get away with stating more even though nothing has changed?"
"There are definitely cars with the new denser batteries, since Panasonic has already upgraded some of the 2170 lines at Giga Nevada. They're likely just phasing them in and only the LR Model 3 seems to have gotten the new 2170's so far. Unless you really believe that Tesla is just not using the new batteries at all which would be pretty bizarre.

I think the SR+ Model 3 is the only car where it's really unclear what they've done since it got a range boost but not as much as the LR. So it's hard to tell which upgrade they did to it, the heat pump or the cells. Probably just the heat pump would be my guess since they probably just made one type of new pack."
"Depends what you're doing. If you're driving 45 MPH on flat ground with no wind against you and no stops and the climate off, you can probably hit 350+. If you're driving 80 on the highway, it'll be more like 200."
Awesome!  My range has been decreasing every other day.
"As of last night, teslafi was reporting that they were all long range dual motor model y’s going from 2020.40.3 to 2020.40.7"
Mine hasn't gotten a range boost either. Pretty sure software is up to date. Not sure if I need to do something to the car....
Some 3 owners are seeing the increased 0-60 times when looking at the blurb in the performance upgrade. Not sure about range though.
"I’m not sure why Tesla always keeps this information so closely guarded, which is why it leads me to believe that nothing has actually changed. But I am just extrapolating from everything noted in this video: https://youtu.be/aZJba_oNhT4

My guess is that since the heat pump was introduced to the 3, they ran through all the epa tests again and got favorable modifiers in the cold weather portion of the test to get the better model 3 range. The model y likely used the same modifiers as the model 3 with resistive heaters due to the fast development cycle. This can be corroborated if a model 3 owner can chime in if they got increased range as well or only increased 0-60 times."
"I think this is your answer.

"That would be true if the range update didn’t bring the model y to the same as the new model y, which it appears that it does

https://electrek.co/2020/10/16/tesla-software-update-increasing-range-existing-vehicles/"
What happens when you drive it
For the first time I’m beginning to regret dropping $8k on the Performance option
"I have faith we'll see 2020.40.7 soon, supposedly MYP 303m now"
"why? we are getting the range increase as well, it was 100% software increase for the y's"
"Why? I got the Performance and absolutely love it!

Also, realise, you can just get the 19"" Gemini Wheels, put them on, and you'll have the same range as a LR AWD? And I think it will boost our 0-60 times too! (the wheels are lighter, lower rotational mass, etc.)

I bought a set of 19"" Gemini Wheels + hubcaps from a LR AWD Model Y owner who HATED the look of them and immediately bought aftermarket wheels. I found him selling them on craigslist and got an absolute bargain! So now I have the best of both worlds. I plan to put them on this weekend. Just waiting for the jack and jackpads to arrive.

It also gives me more options such as all seasons or snow & ice tires which aren't available for our 21 inch uberturbine wheels."
Oh. Oh! Sweet!
"May I suggest a few handy accessories?

- welcome mat. I put one of these outside whichever door I am using for access in and out (Model 3 so I use the side doors. Then I can take my shoes off before I get in. 

- prop rod for electrical box - the one you show allows the cord to exit through the bottom, but most I have used do not, so it is handy to have a stick handy to hold it open. I struggled to find a stick on the ground at dusk a few weeks back, so I cut a small piece of wood about 26”

- prop rod for well cover - I store a few things down in the well and with cushions and blankets on top, it is good to have something to hold the well lid open. In this case, I cut a piece of wood about 18” with a 45 degree cut in each end. Then a coated the face of the cut end with some caulk to prevent it from slipping. The dried caulk grips well on the carpeted surfaces to reliably hold the lid open. I have made two of these. The second I labeled and wrapped some blue painters tape around so as to not accidentally use it as kindling, as I did with the first. 

The prop rod is handy not only for camping so now it permanently resides in the trunk well."
In a day how many miles can you get on that charger?
You have the right NEMA converter so it’s full 50amps?
"If you still have,  can you take picture of the plug and the adapters you used? :)

Also, how late can you enter an RV park? Sometimes it’s 10 or 11p at night and I don’t want to risk going there and it not being possible to rent a spot"
Nice car how do you like blue? Debating Blue vs white.
Should be around 4/hour so 96/day
">	prop rod for well cover - I store a few things down in the well and with cushions and blankets on top, it is good to have something to hold the well lid open.

Unless I’m misunderstanding what you mean by well (rear under-trunk area?), doesn’t the car have this built-in? Mine tips up and then slots into a groove so it can stay mostly upright: no additional prop required."
Depends on the plug.  If it is a 14-50 available at most RV parks then you can charge a full MY battery in 8 hours.
I was getting about 20 mph!
This particular Koa had the correct plug in.
"Hi I usually call the campground or Koa in advance. Since I have kids I need to be able to plan vs just winging it. Most camp grounds are going to have the 30amp or the 50 amp. Also Tesla has such a good infrastructure of super chargers, that even if you charged to 90% and did not plug in on the camp ground you would probably use 20 to 30 miles max. I tested it I had my car set at 68 degrees and the out door temp thy night got as low as 33. But I new there was a super charger within 20 miles of me as well. Picture will be posted. Thanks!!"
"My Model 3 was white, so when I got the Y I didn’t want white again, and honestly it’s a really nice blue!"
This car was charging at 20/hour. Most RV campgrounds will have 30 or 50 amps
"Not mine, late 2018 Model 3. Could be that it was added later. Or maybe just on the Y because it has more “headroom”. Or it is one of those things that I managed to not find out about in nearly 2 years. 

My guess is that it’s a Y only feature."
Thanks for your help. I do agree blue looks great.  Also the white mismatch issue would drive me crazy if it would happen.
"Just a few things to be aware of (as I found from experience)

1.  The TT-30 plug that is ubiquitous at most camp sites is 30A but only 120v so you will get 15 miles/ hour, or 10 with camp mode on. 

2.  The above stated charge rate is under ideal conditions. You may be more likely to have that at a KOA but my experience at state campgrounds is that I get less. This past weekend, it was so low that for the few early morning hours where I bumped it up from 69 to 70 degrees, I actually lost a mile of range. 

It’s still great camping this way, but I’m just saying, be prepared."
"Oh, ok. I was assuming Y since that’s what the OP has. Yes, it sounds like there’s a new design for the Y. It’s handy for sure."
"Sorry, I am lurking in this sub where I don’t belong ;)"
good to see there aren't any parts from home depot
Where's the carburetor?
Any wood shims?
It’s naked. Should probably have a NSFW label on it. 😝
What is this.....
How easy is it to clean the air condenser if you’re suffering from the musty smell?
Looks like you’re low on blinker fluid
"Wait, is this the story about the person that was driving down the road, their frunk popped open, and then the liner for the frunk flew out while they were driving, and then they took this single frame video, and went home to bed, then the next morning called the police to say “hi”?


Anyway... neat. Seems more “organized” than the 3."
Oh man a Korean 12v?  Where does windshield water drain off to?
You beat me to it.
I see some sink drains!
The guts of the heat pump.
"Search YouTube for how to.  Here’s the product: Lubegard 96030 Kool-It Evaporator and Heater Foam Cleaner https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007PHD0S/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_kn9HFb9GXS49Y.  

It is easier to get to in the Y then it is in the 3.  But still a bit more involved than I would like."
I took my 3 in for that issue when I first got her and they fixed it up nicely at the SC.
"Looks like they drain to the side. If you look at the first photo, they just stop."
I think it’s a maintenance issue from what I understand so I believe it’ll keep on coming back at regular intervals. So would be nice to just do this oneself rather than deal with the sc.
It’s possible this is a software update. Look at the acceleration boost upgrade in-app. It’s improved from 4.8-4.3s to 4.8-4.2s for my MY.
"Just talked with support via chat. I have a 2021 Model Y I'm picking up Oct 28th. I asked if it will have the updated range to which they responded: "" Yes all vehicles are getting updated range."" Which to me seems like it was a software update for the Model Y at least, assuming they are giving me good information of course."
"Sister picking up Y today. Any way to know if will have longer range? VIN showed 21 model year and nearly at 63,000"
"Feels like a software unlock.

Wait model 3 didn’t get any increase in miles?
Edit: oh it sure did. 353 miles"
What they change... i just picked up my Y!
All models S3XY got boosted.. it could be software...
"Just checked my app and it looks like the acceleration boost is down to 0.6 sec, it was 0.5 secs before right? If this is true then it means the range boost is a software unlock ."
"Man, they need to just add the auto dim side mirrors and heated steering wheel since they just added it to the 3"
"I assume these changes are made even if you ordered a few days ago? It's not like it's starting on orders today, correct? I have a registration number assigned. that is it."
"not sure about the uberturbine wheels, but everything else looks pretty cool."
"This is probably due to either some tweaks they made with the heat pump, slightly improved Panasonic battery chemistry, and/or the huge weight reduction switching to the new single cast rear end structure."
Hope it's a preview of RWD launching soon to soften the difference in range from the AWD.
"Sounds like from many messages here that the range upgrade is only for 2021 models. I am picking up my 2021 Model Y next week, but when I asked my sales advisor today about the change, this is what he said.

**My Question:**  

""I just saw the Model Y range update online (+10). I am supposed to receive my Model Y next week, and was wondering if this is a software update that I would receive or if this upgrade is part of new cars that I would not have? 

Also, the website does not list what has changed, outside of the range, are there any other updates to the Y that are not on the car I will be receiving next week (double paned windows, etc).""

**His response:**

""Thanks for the email.

Every Model Y Long Range AWD ever produced will get the range improvement in an upcoming software update.  


There are no other updates for the Model Y.""

Seems like some conflicting information going around."
It's about 0.3% of charge. Not totally sure it's worth it unless the software update was cheaper. I'd pay maybe $100.  But that's a few months of charging for me. So is it worth it? Depends if it even actually is a software update. But awesome the range is going up!
"Anyone heard anything about the interior refresh coming to Model Y? Seeing as how 3 and Y share the same interior, I wonder if they’ll keep costs down and manufacturing logistics efficient by keeping everything the same?"
"I ordered on 9/21, but don't yet have a VIN. I wonder if that means mine will get the new range?"
"I asked my Tesla advisor about this since I'm taking delivery of a Model Y this weekend.  Response is below:

&#x200B;

""It will! All Model Y's  will get a software update increasing the range."""
I’m really curious too if this is a software or hardware change. Can seem to get clarification anywhere on the internet. But again 10 miles is not a huge deal
"Here's the response I got :( Talk about phrasing.

Great question Matthew! Unfortunately, you received the incredible car that you ordered at the price you expected. The 2021 Models will come with the new updated range only."
"Best way to find out: road trip!

I have my 60xxx ordered as well with a scheduled pickup at the end of the month. I’m also hoping that it comes with the extra range!"
"Hopefully. I just got mine a few weeks ago. But I’m not really stressing over 10 “EPA” miles

Yes. A pretty big one for long range 3. 322 up to 353. I don’t think these changes are software locked."
"No it’s a new chemistry from Panasonic, it’s about a 5% increase at the individual cell"
Not sure. Could be new cells from Panasonic or a software update coming. More likely the new higher density cells from Panasonic. 10 miles really isn’t a big deal IMO. Model Y won’t see major upgrades for another year likely.
Could be. But I think it’s more likely the new Panasonic battery packs with 5% density increase. 10 miles isn’t that crazy though. Model 3 long range getting 353 is a big increase.
No. It’s not. It’s only 2021 cars and it’s confirmed.
3 has a heated steering wheel now? Source on that?
You gotta think these things are coming to the MY once they run out of inventory on the old parts. The point of sharing so many parts between ME and MY is so that you can... share parts. You don't change one without the other.
"From what i've read, range boost is available on all MY trim levels produced so far, so yes"
"Big time conflicting info. I guess there isn’t a company wide memo that goes out.

He is very clear in his statement though. All LR AWD ever produced get the range increase. That’s pretty clear."
That’s free PR right?   Get us talking and questioning and researching and YouTubing.....     They gotta outsource the PR to us since Tesla fired their own.
"Make no sense to make the change for Y.    They decided to do this to M3 to keep up with sales as people flock over to MY.    While newer and piano black removed, the new assembly for M3 is more cost effective to product and less complicated to install.

The real kicker is the USB port in glove compartment.   My 10 yr old MB truck has that, don’t know why the Tesla engineers didn’t think of it.   Oh wait, cause they were probably 10 yrs old when German/Japanese put USB ports in glove compartment, Tesla is probably the first car they ever owned, let along worked on.

The reality is that American just doesn’t want sedans unless it is drastically cheaper.    We are in love with our SUVs."
Maybe next quarter for the Y. Changing assembly lines isn’t quick or easy. I’m guessing they will keep the same interior for this first run of 2021 Ys and then refresh the interior starting next year. But still just a guess. They could leave the Y like this for another year. No one knows.
everyone with Y will get it
Great news
Not massive but 10 miles is 10 miles. Would love to have them if it's a software update.
10 miles is 16.09 km
"Tweets have confirmed that all MY's are getting the update pushed with the range boost. 

https://twitter.com/teslascope/status/1317187684427689984

https://twitter.com/teslascope/status/1317188701248577536"
"I was hopeful, but that is why I added that last sentence about assuming they are giving me good information. That sucks."
I'm starting not to believe that Tesla rep.
Agreed. 10 isn’t going to do anything to normal day to day use. Just means I’ll charge up at 70 miles left on the battery vs 60 miles haha
"Wow. Ya. I just checked! 353!!!!! Come on Elon. Give my poor LR RWD a software update to 353 miles too!

30 miles. Might not be software. Re calculation for EPA? Or more battery density. I can only wish for software update."
10 miles isn't a 5% increase
Hoping you are wrong and it gets the center console and USB port in glove compartment.
10 miles is 16.09 km
Don't Model Y and Model 3 use Tesla batteries and S/X use Panasonic?
My car is a 2020 and it’s on my upgrade page or are you talking about the range?
Different people being told different things. I think there’s some chance it’s an software update.
"Another random guy in the telsamotors subreddit mentioned it, seems like it's unconfirmed at the moment"
"Yes, agreed, i can't fathom why they would source autodim and non autodim side mirrors if they both can use the same part. I suspect they're pulling a demand lever to push more model 3s now that Y is the new car in demand, and have assigned the remaining non autodim side mirrors both were using to Y production until they run out since there's no shortage of demand for the Y, then they will use autodim on the Y as well.

I just hope they run out of non autodim side mirrors in the near future, placed an order october 1st with no VIN yet!"
Nope. Only 2021 Model Y will get increase.
"2020.40.7 I guess is the software update that will give model Y owners the extra 10 miles

https://driveteslacanada.ca/software-updates/tesla-2020-40-7-software-update/"
I feel like converter bot is trying to pick a fight with you.
Thank you for the confirmations!
70 miles is 112.65 km
353 miles is 568.1 km
"that is correct, but they have said that they have increased the energy density by 5%

https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/panasonic-boosts-energy-density-trims-cobalt-in-new-2170-battery-cell-for-tesla/

> A cell with greater energy density means that engineers figured out a way to pack more energy in that space. The 5% improvement in energy density in the cells should result in the same gains in Tesla’s battery packs. The upshot: Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y could see improvements in range. The reduction in cobalt content, a rare chemical element that is expensive and has social and environmental costs, could also help reduce the price of the cells."
"Tesla doesn’t product their own cells yet, everything is from Panasonic right now."
Range. Sorry. But I would think the increased times are related to new tech in the 2021 models. Not sure though. Tests will determine.
I noticed that too. Very odd Tesla doesn’t send out memos to their reps and chat agents when this stuff drops so it’s easier to confirm with existing owners. Time will tell if there is any bump for new owners
"my theory is that these cells have already been in these cars for a while, they just have made other efficiencies that have raised the range, such as the heat pump and other electronic efficiencies"
Yeah I’m confused because it would be false advertisement if that was the case.
Nope. Only 2021 cars get the new range. It’s confirmed
That or they just added rollout to the number. Rollout on the boost was about 4 seconds. No rollout was 4.3.
"well a heat pump is a hardware change, so yeah cars without it wouldn't get the new range..."
"I got a phone call today saying that the fixed all of my panel gaps but they need to schedule another service appointment for a dent.

I was like...what dent? Apparently, they dented the car while fixing the panel gap on my passenger door.

I dont even know how to feel or what I can do about it except accept that it's gonna be another 5 days the car is in service? 😔 should I even complain at this point to them?"
1 good thing is at least they were upfront and honest about it.
"On my *delivery day* at a service center, I asked to have a piece of trim fixed and when the car came back there was a big dent in the front passenger side wheel arch.

I was gobsmacked, the car had been nearly perfect before that, but just said whatever, we'll fix the dent later. I scheduled an appointment a few weeks out, at which point I had to send it off to a body shop on Tesla's dime. Luckily got a loaner, but it still took 4-5 days."
"As I can see from the pic you provided, it is at an area that will probably won’t affect your car’s functions. Most PDR techs can repair that with zero issues. You probably won’t even know it was dented in the first place after the repair is done.

The silver lining here is at least Tesla techs owe up their fault and offering a repair. Time is the only downside."
Ouch that’s worse than a panel gap.
"I’m curious, does that repair then show up on a future CarFax as an accident?"
"Had mine in SC today for wheel alignment and some gap issues and was told they are mechanics not body shop people so I have to go to a Tesla certified body shop tomorrow for an estimate to fix the frunk hood (gaps fine but it’s twisted and one side sticks up from bumper when closed) and both front doors stick out a little when closed.

At least the service manager was truthful about the little experience they have and sent me to some professionals."
These things happen all the time. It happened to my husbands BMW twice in one year where dealership broke smth. In one of those cases their service person backed up with the trunk door open and damaged it enough that they had to replace the entire door. Honestly it was kinda hilarious and we actually laughed quite a bit. If it’s their fault they’ll fix it and these things do not get reported to carfax or anything. It’s life.
So I had a similar issue happen on driver side front small round dent. Debating leaving it cause paint less dent repair can’t fix that. Needs to go to Bodyshop to get pulled primer repaint. What do you all recommend ?
I’m curious as to what the repair process is for something like this?
Tell them to give you a service loaner
"Thanks for the response guys and reassurance. Definitely okay for their mistake and im glad they're fixing it as well. I had a calm reaction and everyone was telling me I should be pissed. It happens, although quite inconvenient. Just my first time buying an expensive car and never gone thru this before."
Did they at least give you a loaner?
Why do we complain about these things. Mistakes happen. They are going to fix it.
"Not excusing it, but at least they were upfront about it. Would rather have that than having to discover it a month later and schedule another service appointment. I'm sorry you have to go through that."
"Mistakes happen. It's less about the mistake and more about how they handle it.

It sucks, but their response is what you want to hear."
"They admitted it. If someone admits to me they made a mistake and are straight with me, and fix it, I respect them 10x more."
Yes this is correct. The dents can happen because they beat the sides of the panel with hammers or rubber to align them.  This can be seen by Tesla in a service videos for MY.
Bruh that looks like the frame itself.
"They have to bring it into a body shop to get the dent fixed and that's why its taking about 5 days long.

To me, it sounded serious when they said they had to bring it to a body shop and hoping it doesn't affect the function or the frame too much"
"Not sure if it would, but it’s generally a good strategy to keep details and pictures of anything like this that you can show the buyer when selling the car. Even on trade-ins I’ve heard people being able to talk their way out of “accident on Carfax devaluations” with good pictures to provide context."
"No.  It's not that kind of accident.  The kind of accident that shows up on CarFax is a vehicular accident (a.k.a. ""car wreck"", ""traffic accident"",""fender bender"", etc.).  They get the info from insurance claims and police reports.  This is a mistake made by a tech, fixed by a contractor, paid for by the manufacturer.  CarFax wouldn't know about it, and wouldn't classify it as an accident if they did."
Probably knock down any high spots and body filler for the low spots.
Yeah I've been on a loaner for a week now for the panel gaps after them running out of loaners for the first 3 days. I had to uber around. It was super inconvenient.
"“Here’s some Uber credits, come back in a week.”"
"Did they give you a loaner?   If so, I agree with u/jaykresge"
That's not the frame
"Yeah, that doesn’t look like an easy fix."
"Negative. They contract to dent fixers. Everyone does this (BMW, Lexus) etc. 

Most likely the dealerships change procedures due to COVID where they don’t allow contractors on site. It depends on the stealership."
Tesla service centers specifically do not do body work. The idea is that everything they do is stuff that you could reasonably do on someone's driveway.
"What did you get for a loaner?  I had one back in Feb. I wanted my car back, but I also enjoyed the S-Ludicrous."
They gave me a loaner after 3 days if ubering. I told them I really need a car since I have a small child that I don't want to out in an uber.
They gave me a model s. Super fun to drive but miss my y for sure.
Yeah I enjoyed the switch. Downside is my wife wants an S now.
"Lol. The s looks great on the outside but I really hated the long screen and the window controls being so low and at an angle. 

The door handles are supercool."
I posted this because it will probably come to the Model Y at some point.
yeah i’m not a fan of this at all tbh. wish they would have just made the old version matte or satin and left it alone
Ok looks better than the pics haha they could’ve simply made the original design not gloss and I think it would’ve been fine too haha
"I like the old style better, it's sleeker and I like that you can close the phone compartment. I hope they don't bring it to the y immediately... Especially because I was going to put the wood overlay on it once I get my car. Hopefully they'll make a wood kit for the new one."
"Looks nice, i like the door. But I prefer the older one, if they can do the older one without piano black that would be ideal. The new style is probably easier to manufacture though. Less parts."
wtf this looks like a 2003 vehicle center console
A wrapped or covered old model looks better IMO. Like was mentioned having the option to close the lid is nice.
"I like this, but I like the older design more... but that's what I have. would be interested to hear what others like or dislike about it once its more prevalent"
"Looks good to me! Has its trade-offs but that center storage area seems a lot more intuitive to open and close, and the wireless charging pad looks really nice."
Wow that looks amazing! No more cheapo plastics.
I like lifting the wireless charger access. Seems like a cost cutting measure. Also it’s still cheap plastic just not glossy lol. It seems easier to manufacture but loses some flash.
I’m curious if you can still use wired chargers with this? There doesn’t appear to be enough space to allow for the connector on the phone side.
Don't like it at all. Glad I have the current version on my Y.
I like it! Thanks for sharing.
"Wow. So the phones just stay exposed like that? How obscene!

But seriously. Not a fan at all at. Does anyone know another luxury car where phones are exposed like that with no cover? Looks so cheap to me."
"I think it looks nice. I slightly prefer the old style, but this looks pretty good."
You’re right. This eliminates the storage access underneath the phone. This new design is less functional.
Audi
Yeah the sliding door is nice but I don’t like the new charging area for the phones
"I will admit, it looks better on video vs the pictures posted, and may look better in person. But at this point, I slightly prefer the old version too."
I’m with you.
Model?
Q5
"Looks like the Qi charger is an accessory add on, so really more of an afterthought by them, but still it slides under the armrest? Or am I looking at an older version?"
The one i test drove had it built in the same place as wireless pad with no cover. Only difference is it alertts you if you leave it in the car
Santa clarita?
"I was scrolling through reddit and was like, ""thats a sick looking car!""

..I got the same car! lol"
Moreno Valley
Same. I see a white model y with Induction and I'm like dammmmmn.
Yeah Riverside was very foggy this morning!!
Right.  It's a great design.  I don't feel the same way about the m3 oddly enough.
Yeah. Made me detour from going home to instead supercharge. Great vibe
"None listed yet, Guess Tesla is going to off the 7 day return cars?"
Today sales person was pushing hard. I ended up ordering.
Those are gonna get snatched up so fast lol. I wish I had the option to purchase used when I ordered mine.
Congratulations! What config?
"Talk to a sales rep at the store, that's how I found mine. There were like 8 in the local area when I checked."
Long Range with towing attachment. FSD for now we will see... white and black interior.
Did those include boost and FSD? Did Tesla add it like its doing to 3's to boost price?
Some of them had FSD like the one I got.
"SEXY!!! 🤩 that blk on blk setup is really poppin, IMHO. Congrats!"
Oh H E L L Yeah!  Looks sick!
Love it.
Amazing. Congrats!
how much were they including the tires?? those look amazing
Awesome bro I remember your older Post I asked if you had a pic and you didn't know how to post LOL. Looks awesome!
How’s she treating you so far? Miles?
"Nice!! looks great!!  


I’ve got HF-3’s on my MY and love the look."
"Those wheels look great!  Do you know what offsets you ran in the front and rear?  Also, did you stick with the OEM tire size or change?"
HF-5’s ?
Thanks bud!
Ugh the tires were brutal lol. I used to be in the car custom game so vossen to good care of me with the wheels. The tires if I wasn’t getting them at cost would probably retail around 2k alone.
Hahaha yea still don’t know how to post in the comments 😂. And thank you
Fantastic. 581 miles. Battery could be better. Long range doesn’t mean much lol
That’s awesome! I almost went with those. Did you do 21x9.5 front and 21x10.5 rear too?
38 in the front 42 in the back. And yea I went with the factory size tires because 21’s are hard to find. I actually wanted to do 22” but I couldn’t find the required sizes anywhere and I own a shop lol
Yup! In gloss black
holy HAHAHAH
PS4S? are they performance tires
"Nice! Congrats!!  Glad no issues!

Yea battery life will get better in time. The question is how long?!?"
"No, I stuck with 19x9.5 front and back. I occasionally go off-road and tow things (have the factory tow hitch) so I wanted the high-sidewalls of the 19”.   


I did get the calipers painted though, haha!! Here’s a glamour shot my shop sent me when the were doing the work.

So range is about the same ?
Hahaha yea rough. Pirelli P zero 4
Looks awesome. Hahaha I gotta get that shop to show me how to take pics
Pretty much. Honestly it’s only been a few weeks but I kinda feel like it might be a little better. The Vossen’s are lighter for sure and I went with the oem 21” tire size
Time to peel off those tire stickers!
"Nice! What made you go with the Performance over LR?

Although dang..... actual performance aside the Performance looks dang good aesthetically with those wheels and brakes wow"
No paint issues?
Haha - these were taken on delivery day.
I don’t drive much and don’t need the range so I went with the performance.
"The only paint issue was the mismatch between the metal and plastic rear bumper. They fixed it by repainting the quarter panel, the bumper and the rear hatch."
I still have the “screen protector” on my 3 - 1 month shy of 2 years.
"Wow - that's a little surprising as it's known that the paint looks different on plastic vs. metal (across all cars), but maybe yours was worse? My doors are off - Maybe I should push for a complete new paint job."
"I'm not sure if mine was worse or not, but it looked very off as you can see in my second photo (which was before the repaint)"
Early ones were [really bad](https://photos.app.goo.gl/cqDd3jPMCzYRtWTd9). New ones don't seem to have this problem.
"I'm glad they painted it for you. I heard they were saying ""in spec."" I held off ordering for weeks because of this. I wanted the white, but I wanted it to look right. I'd stop by the delivery center and check every couple weeks. When they started to look good, I pulled the trigger. Pick mine up on Saturday. Guess we'll see."
/u/OrbitalATK can we pin this?
No. No one cares it seems.
Did you test drive a non-laminate window Y? What kind of difference does that make?
Thicc
Mine’s a 66xxx. On its way. Fingers crossed for double pane. 😬
What is the yellow car?
Are the rear windows like this?
"I'm listening to my vin40 my... jump in my audi > Toyota > subaru... 

The tesla is still the quietest...

I wonder if they're competing for driver seat db noise levels versus competitive evs, and making drivers side window thicker cheats the tests lol"
"It’s NOT called double pane, they are LAMINATED. Double pane is what you find in your house, those windows with an air gap between them. Laminated is what you see in your picture, two pieces of glass with a laminated layer of plastic between them. Elon must laugh every time he sees someone call this “double pane windows.” 

“Laminated glass is a type of safety glass that holds together when shattered. In the event of breaking, it is held in place by an interlayer, typically of polyvinyl butyral, ethylene-vinyl acetate, or Thermoplastic Polyurethane, between its two or more layers of glass.”"
Nice! Should be like this for all cars.
"I test drove one a month back, so difficult to recall now to compare unfortunately. Too early to tell benefits, but in addition to possibly better sound dampening, it is supposed to improve cabin insulation thereby allowing less energy usage by the heating/cooling system. Although the back windows are not double-pane, so YMMV?"
"According to all the posts, it seems that 64xxx and above are getting the double-pane windows. So I’m pretty sure that yours will be coming with them. Congrats on the car!"
"It’s a 2019 Chevy Bolt in the Shock color-way. I call it the tennis ball. Not the most exciting vehicle, but it’ll get you places - fantastically cheap lease deals and a good intro to electric cars."
"No, rear windows are single-pane."
"For sure, I think the road noise in Tesla’s are over analyzed. Just about everything Tesla is over analyzed and scrutinized TBH.

I think the fundamental issue with road noise for electric cars is that there’s no engine noise to drown it out. However, obviously higher end luxury vehicles like the Mercedes S class, Lexus LS, etc will have great noise insulation with quieter cabins - but they’re built almost specifically for that purpose, which is comfort. And their price tag is pretty damn high too."
I believe that laminated glass falls under the umbrella of double pane as it contains two sheets of glass between the plastic layer. But I could be wrong and am just another fool erroneously calling it as such.
Ya. The benefit is likely small. But still an improvement none the less.
Sweeeeet. 😁
We got a 63xxx last week. Single pane. Should we have waited?
Nice-Love the color!
"Debating if it’s better to get a cheap bolt lease deal vs a MY, especially since I’m not driving much during this pandemic. Is the MY a big upgrade over the Bolt? Is it worth the premium?"
Just the driver and passenger windows are double pane?
"Once again:

“Double-paned windows have two sheets of glass in a window frame instead of just one. Between the glass panes is a small space to provide insulation. The small space between window panes is filled with insulating gas to further increase insulation.”

And....

“Laminated glass is created by bonding multiple layers of glass together while under pressure and heat, with a resin called polyvinyl butyral (PVB.) This process creates single sheets of glass that have multiple layers. The PVB produces high sound insulation and helps keep the glass from breaking apart easily.” As seen in the OP’s picture. There’s no space between the glass layers in the picture that the OP posted. But my original definition above is better than the one I pasted above."
"For sure, I will take a small improvement over no improvement any day. For the cold at least the heat pump on the Y is more efficient than a resistive option. As for the heat, the best thing to do is full window tinting anyway."
Huh that’s interesting. Does it cost more to manufacture or offer higher strength or something?
I received my Model Y 65xxx.  Can confirm that the front windows are double-pane.
"The double pane is nice to have and is definitely an improvement. However, I’m not sure how big a difference it actually makes in reality. With a company like Tesla that is continuously rolling out improvements without a yearly refresh like legacy car makers, there’s always going to be a sense of FOMO. I’m sure a couple months from now will come the heated steering wheel, auto dimming side mirrors, and refreshed center console. Then a couple years from now the upgraded batteries. But at some point you just gotta  forget all that and just enjoy! Congrats on the Y!"
"The Model Y is a huge upgrade over the Bolt in terms of luxury, comfort, and performance. With that being said, they’re in different classes and have widely different price ranges, so it’s difficult to compare. Whether it’s better to get the Bolt over the Model Y depends on your needs/wants, and importantly budget. I can tell you after a year of driving the Bolt, I still enjoy throwing that thing around. Acceleration is pretty decent - instant torque with about 200 HP and 0-60 in 6.5s give or take. 360 camera, rear cross traffic alert, big 10in center screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto all makes for a very enjoyable and safe ride. Efficiency that I got is 4.1mi/KWh mixed driving, so with the 60KWh battery pack the estimated range for the 2019 version of 240mi is accurate. The Shock color also allows me to quickly find it in a parking lot! A big issue that you’ll find people talking about online though are the seats, and it’s all true - minimal padding and can be uncomfortable for some especially during long road trips. I am 5’8” 160 lbs and find the seats to be okay at best, but I am not too bothered by them. The leases are DIRT CHEAP so it’s a great intro to electric car.

With all that being said though, I don’t think any electric car really compares to a Tesla as of right now (maybe the Lucid Air when it comes out in a couple years). But this was a huge splurge, and something I’ve definitely been contemplating for a while before pulling the trigger."
"Yes, only the driver and passenger windows."
"I would assume it costs more as higher end cars tend to have them. In terms of strength, I guess it would depend on the type of double-pane window you are referring to. For the Model Y (and other automotive double-pane windows in general I believe) there is a solid clear insulation layer (unsure of the material) sandwiched between two thin layers of glass for the two front windows. The overall thickness is greater than the single-pane rear windows, and I would assume stronger. But in any case, I don’t think that is the foremost goal of double-pane windows - glass is glass and an impact/accident strong enough to break a single-pane would likely break your double-pane window."
"Dimming side mirrors are rolling out now :)

Also, whats the benefit of a laminated or double pane or whatever window? Just so its harder to break into the car?

Seems like a easy thing to retrofit too? You would have to pay for new windows, but its doable if you want to.

Wonder if the glass (seeing how there are 2 now) is heavier? So the car is heavier? Every pound counts for range."
Interesting. I guess my music is always up loud so I don’t hear any road noise. I wonder if it makes a difference.
"Seems like the windows are more for ambient/wind noise reduction in addition to insulation improvement. Otherwise I don’t think the purpose is to make it harder to break into.

Yeah auto dimming seems to be coming out in the 74xxx. That’s unfortunate that I don’t have it since it’s now standard, but not a deal breaker."
"Doubtful that it actually makes a huge difference. With music up I would say most people probably can’t even tell. Tire size would probably be more critical. If someone was super worried about road noise, I think going with the smaller Gemini wheel would make more of a difference."
It’s left over soap residue. Just clean it off you don’t need any fancy trim restorer.
"https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/hx256a/any_luck_getting_tesla_to_address_the_black_trim/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Had this happen also. Any trim restorer should work

I got this stuff from Walmart and it helped quite a bit: 

https://imgur.com/a/ylheG8o

I basically apply it now after every touchless carwash. Takes it right off."
how'd you wash it?
"Ok so I actually figured out how to fix this issue....read below to find out how I did it.

&#x200B;

Everytime I would wash the car these would appear. Even if I dried the car immediately they would appear and have the streaks. So I tried removing it and nothing would work. Later that week I decided to use ""Adams Graphene Ceramic Coating"" to coat the car. I tried coating the trim as the coating is rated to be applied on all surfaces and to my surprise applying this product completely removed. After getting multiple car washes after and looking at the trim it doesn't do this at all anymore! Not only did it initially remove but it prevents it from appearing again even after subsequent washes!"
"I have the same.... It comes off with some rubbing with your thing, but I just keep it...  Flowers, instead of chrome...

Edit Grrr thumb, not thing..."
What color is your car?
"the trim is treated with a preservative (like armor all), and the car wash uses aggressive soaps which has removed some of this protectant. reapply protectant."
"I've experience the same issue with my local touchless carwash, it's definitely soap residue. Using a damp cloth to wash it off is not enough. I re-washed my car on the driveway the old fashion way and the soap spot issue disappeared, so the good news is that it isn't permanent."
"That’s just spotting caused by wash wax or soap, it’ll come right off with a wet cloth."
WD40. That’s what I use. Takes it right off
Had those spots as well after wash. Baby wipe to dampen it and dry microfiber worked for me.
"Sucks...it happened to me too. Luckily the Tesla service center crew took a look at it and knew exactly how to fix it. They fixed it and it’s gone. They let me know not to use the premium car wash, the one that includes the clear coat protectant or wax coating. They said to purchase the cheapest wash that is only soap and water. I’ve done that and haven’t had a issue since. I’ve been so paranoid that I also keep a drying towel to get the excess drops wiped up."
Tesla!!
That's on you son.  Touchless car washes rely on chemicals to remove dirty and grease.
"This is a known issue from washing it, particularly in automatic washes due to the soaps. There are a lot of cleaners and protectants that will make it look new again. I have seen 303 Aerospace Protectant frequently recommended in the Y Facebook groups with success.  A few others mentioned in this thread.

I do a 2 bucket ONR hand wash on mine and have not experienced the issue personally."
Tried no go
"Some Tesla rep at the service center suggested rubbing alcohol to clean off the trim...if anyone hears that, please don’t follow it, as rubbing alcohol is a very abrasive chemical. Rubber compounds in general should not be cleaned with any sort of alcohol as that would dry it out and make it brittle over time."
Thank you
So weird. But this isn’t the standard plastic or rubber trim on other cars right? Isn’t it painted or anodized aluminum?
At a touchless car wash... The car came out very clean except around the edges as you can see it's now discolored
"I've never rubbed my Model Y with my thing.  Usually use a microfiber cloth.  
  
On the Model Y, that is."
Black

The trim OP is showing is painted aluminum.
"Not sure honestly. It’s not standard because if it was we wouldn’t have this problem lol. All I know is that just wiping it with a dry or wet towel didn’t help much, but this stuff makes it look brand new right away."
I brought it back to Tesla and they said the pH levels was too high...
"This is the reason I stopped using touch free. My chrome started to die. Turns out, it was the pH level. Can't use a touch, or touch free. Ugh."
"that’s unfortunate, wonder if it could it be that the car wash used something too strong"
Ding a ling thing thing?
"Oh well, throw away the car. You’re not even OP!?"
"That’s fine, but I’m saying you probably shouldn’t use it just because there’s a lot of stuff on the outside and inside that may be damaged by IPA. Why risk it...there was a post just a few days ago about the center console being ruined by rubbing ipa with a microfiber cloth. You use ipa to prep a surface for welding or painting, seems overkill to use it for regular cleaning."
Yep. I'm forced to wash myself now but winter is coming and that'll be an issue washing in the cold
Do you think Tesla will replace mine
Touchless car washes use very harsh chemicals.
Tesla told me that the pH levet are too high
[deleted]
I think if was the cover that was installed on top which got ruined luckily.
"Got a garage?

Optimum No Rinse Wash & Shine lets you wash your car in the garage."
You’ll be able to clean it off..
Unfortunately I'm not sure.
"No, because it's residue from the cleaning solution.  Soap scum.  It can be removed easily with trim restorer, or regular car wash soap, followed by a prompt drying/buffing pass with a dry microfiber cloth.  
  
It's not damage, and it's not a defect in the material, it's just leftover stuff that dried onto your car."
There are solutions that have been posted in the comments above.
I brought it back to Tesla and they said the pH levels was too high...

This is what I was referring too. Have a great weekend."
"This looks really good actually compared to others I've seen.  

Even other car manufacturers have a difficult time matching plastic bumpers & metal panels in the white colors.  Take a gander at other white cars when you're out, and you'll notice it's more prevalent than not. 

Congrats by the way!"
"Mine is in the 54000 range and looks similar. Still a bit off if you look for it, but not that obvious."
Looks great. Usually the color mismatch stands out in cloudy lighting. Full on sunlight makes it hard to tell.
Depends on the light. You’ll see stark differences in different lighting. This looks like all the others.
Thanks to everyone for their help!
"They definitely get a lot of flak because for a while they were shipping cars with cracked A pillars, really messy paint jobs and panel gaps that actually created problems (besides just aesthetics)."
Thanks! Yeah I totally agree. I definitely think Tesla’s are a bit overly scrutinized!
"You’re so spot on with that. I think only under certain lighting it would be really obvious, but nobody’s actually out to try and catch the color difference..."
I agree it’s slightly slightly off but honestly looks pretty good! Hope you’re good with it.
"Yeah man, absolutely. 

Folks need to relax a bit and just enjoy their cars.  

Bottom line: no other car company on the automotive scene (EV or ICE)
comes close to what Tesla has going on."
"Deservedly so! You know how that age old argument goes “if I’m paying $$$ then my car should blah blah blah”

But regardless of arguments the quality was atrocious in the beginning with lots of rattling parts, mismatched paint, roof flying off etc.

I took a look at my ICE car and the panel gaps are nowhere near as tight as what comes with any Tesla today. But I didn’t have any issues either (Honda).

Tesla bit themselves on the ass with the subpar quality reaching customers that could’ve been solved with experienced QC.

And their brand will be paying for those mistakes for years to come. It’s like Apocalypse soccer. If you make a goal, you get one point. If the customer makes a goal, they get 10,000 views on YouTube."
"I'm good with it. Heck, after some dust settles on it, it'll all be the same shade anyway."
That is infuriating. FYI; I went the SD card route and it hasn't failed me yet. Only wish I got it sooner bc I got dinged by a car door.
Assholes... what’s wrong with people.... sorry man!
"First, I’m sorry that happened. That really sucks. I hope karma gets them. Second, I did a lot of reading through the sub and bought the T7 SSD for my Y whenever it delivers. Was the issue with the drive and anyone care to chime in how a SD card would be better in this case for this particular sentry error? Mostly what I gathered was they don’t like the constant write and rewrite but it’s not my area of expertise. Thanks"
Assholes who do this should have their car or prized possession taken from them.
That really is a bummer. Sorry to hear that.
That stinks.  It’s always on my mind as well.  I have the same SSD but am getting the Sandisk iExpand Drive.
"They envy you, stupid idiots."
"Man, I’m so sorry there are people like this! I’m also hoping Karma gets them. Imagine how you’d have to feel to want to do this to someone...this person must feel like that all the time."
“They hate us because they ain’t us!”
"Well, if they did it to you twice, they are likely going to do it again. The good news, is if they are stupid enough to do it to a Tesla, next time your sentry cam hopefully will catch them and you can prosecute them once caught on camera."
"I'm so sorry to hear this!

My Samsung T7 500GB has been giving me trouble as well. Only have had the Model Y for 9 days, and when the car would get hot, the drive wouldn't save the data. Sometimes it happens at night too. I re-formated the drive, and so far it's ok."
"Ooofff... i'm so sorry man. I'm worried sentry will fail me when I need it most as well.

Can you set up more camera's around your home, and pointing at your car?

For sentry/dashcam, I am using an Intel Enterprise 800gb SSD I had laying around, and just used a USB 3.0 to SATA adapter, it works like an absolute champ and has far better performance than any crappy consumer usb stick or ssd. It's also designed to be written to constantly all day long, because its an enterprise ssd designed to be used in RAID Arrays."
"Did anyone call for Karma? Here I am. 
But seriously though, sorry that happened man. That’s just nasty. Karma will get that person back. 
For future, get a PPF on your vehicle"
Damn sorry that happened to you. I have the same drive and have not had any problems with it yet
Sorry to hear that. Karma is a bitch!
"Sorry this happened to you! Hope karma comes back. 

I did some reading before choosing an ssd for the recordings. I read the T7 gets very hot and could sometimes cause problems. I ended up going with the older T5 ssd model which hasn't gotten hot and I haven't had any problems with sentry mode recordings."
Thank you. Which SD card setup did you go with?
What would you do with the footage in that case? Why would it even matter?
"That’s the drive I got as well (Samsung T7 500GB). I’ve only had the car for 7 days, but it’s worked flawlessly every time but this instance so far. Hopefully I dont have another issue..."
"> anyone care to chime in how a SD card would be better in this case for this particular sentry error? 

Not about this particular error but the 'record on horn honk' freezes in the last minute (i.e. right before you hit the horn) on our SD card (one of the ones recommended in the manual.) As far as we know, the sentry videos are fine, though (we've had fun watching our parking garage neighbours check out the car!)"
"My thoughts exactly. I’m hoping if they try again, which I’m positive they will, it will catch them. Oh man do I hope I catch them..."
Seems like the neighbor only does it once per car that he owns. A jealous neighbor perhaps.
Thank you.. Currently looking at Outdoor cameras that I can point at my car. I’m going to catch them!
I’m still learning my way around this. Do you leave the SSD connected to the car 24/7?
"Thank you, what’s PPF? I’m assuming a paint protection?"
"SanDisk 128GB High Endurance and Rocketek USB adapter.. only costs about $35 total. My only concern is that the adapter is aluminum and does run hot when in constant use but so far its worked flawlessly. The fact is both solutions will last a long time but I know that those USB cables the SSD dangles off are prone to failure, especially if you use the storage cubby for other things in a moving vehicle where things are constantly moving around. That's what tipped the scale for me."
Yup. It's just sitting down there connected to the usb.
"Yup. Paint protection film. Does wonders. It’s like the screen protector you put on your phone. If it scratches or anything, it’ll be the film and not the paint."
That’s helpful. I’ll look into it. Thanks!
