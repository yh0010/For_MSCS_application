"It isn't quite the Model X's panoramic windshield, but it goes up pretty darn far before there's a cross beam:

As a tall driver this design makes me very happy.


Edit: Interior shot, seriously awesome:

There are multiple styles of door handles. That is different.
Such a clean interior. Love it. Where's the dashboard?
Yep. This will do...  This will do... :-)
That matte grey one looks really good. Not sure how to feel about the wheels though.
As an 18 year old going into finals... nothing has ever made me want to study harder.

"My mouth literally said , "" holy shit "" by itself when i saw the whole placement of that main control screen. if that is not futuristic , then i don't know what is."
I am in love with the interior!! I think it looks awesome!
It's like a cute little baby Model S. I love it. It kind of reminds me of a shark. I don't know why.

"Only thing I don't like is the iPad on a stand bolted on. But, for 35k I think I will survive. "
"I noticed there is no screen in front of the steering wheel, so will they be using a HUD?"
"Unless the car has an amazing HUD, I don't see how that instrument panel (If you can call it that) is even remotely practical."
"Love it! The front is excellent, we don't need no grill imitations. "
"For $35k and possible reimbursements, you can't go wrong."
"that's quite a short nose, eh - http://imgur.com/JRR0Ak5"
"They stole my blacked out matte grey look! At least I won't have to wrap my next Tesla... :)

"I'm not always one to love matte finishes on cars, but compared to the other two on stage, the matte finish is clearly my favorite based on what I've seen so far.

What do folks think of the wheels?  I'm interested to see more photos in better lighting, but it looks like they tried new designs for each of the models on stage."
[deleted]
Look at the dark gray car's wheels!!!! They can change shape depending on speed. You can clearly see that the blacker surface can slide over to cover the gaps in the rim. That is an elegant solution to rear wheel well covers 
"1. The interior was amazing when they first panned over it.
2. The full length glass roof will be crazy, I can't wait to see pictures of it, and more so, I can't wait to see it in person.
3. The shape looks great, I was worried it might look bubbly in order to cut costs and still create a good mileage range
4. Is that a new red color? It looked so much richer and dark.
5. The new wheel rims look amazing as well

In summary it all looks amazing and has surpassed my expectations. I look forward to hearing about the different options and specs that will follow suit hopefully soon."

"Many french cars have the gauge cluster in the middle of the dash and it works very well, oh and that interior is amazing i hope it doesn't change for the release!"
Actually looks very nice.
No lug nuts.   How?
[Official model 3 photoshoot pictures from the verge here](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/1/11342104/tesla-model-3-announcement-photos)
"That interior is mind blowing. Honestly this is game over.

Tesla is here to stay."
SOOOOO NICE!!!
"I love the design. It really feels like the culmination of everything they've done. The front looks a bit like the roadster, the rear looks a bit like the X, the main body looks like the S. "
"So does a gas powered car have any pros compared to a Tesla? Or is this thing 100% worth buying?

Serious question."
"The front end of a Ferrari. The back end of a MS.  The look of sexy all around.

Nice job Elon."
I gotta replace the entire roof if my windshield cracks?
ok time to get back to work
I fell in love with the wheels of the red car! They look like turbofans!!!!

Am I the only one most excited about the center console with forward cupholders?
It looks like the love child between the model S and model X.
"I've been in love with the Model S for so long... now I'm so thrown off. I thought I would *like* the Model 3 but not enough to hold off on getting an S.

Oh god. "
"Here is another picture of the silver one. Quite beautiful might I say. It is almost like they took what was great from the roadster, the S and the X and this is the result. 

I cannot wait to see what changes will be made to the final production version

That's a beautiful car that I'll never be able to afford
"Wow, tablets now come with cars  

Amazing"
[deleted]
woof!
It looks like an Aston with a botched nosejob.
Glass roof - wouldn't that get unbearably hot in summer at low latitude locations such as most of Australia?  I doubt that the tinting could block enough of the heat.
"I want to see a picture of the whole line-up, I can't tell the difference in the exterior from the Model S. 

I'll need to check it out in person. So tempted to pre-order."
I gotta be honest. I HATE the look of that interior. What the heck is wrong with the standard setup visible through the steering wheel?  I'm not a fan of the high roofline either. 
"I think it looks very underwhelming overall and the front is ugly. The interior looks really nice though, but where is the main instrument cluster?

I'm looking at buying one too, but can't say I'm all that impressed."
"Not realy feeling that front end at all, tbh. "
"BEAUTIFUL, JUST ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL"
"Love Tesla, but this is so plain and ugly.  I'm almost disappointed in a way.

Love the X, Love the S... but the Model 3 :-("
This is more arousing than any secksi time subreddit
So what happens to my priority if I preordered one at an east coast address but will be moving significantly west well before it would be delivered
"When my '04 civic dies on me I will buy this, or whatever car Tesla has out. I think it's still cheaper to drive. As a 20-something, the opportunity cost of a car purchase is huge so I'll be doing it when absolutely necessary. Happy for everyone who is getting one now though."
"That charcoal color, with lots of tint and smoked tail lights is going to look amazing!"
SWEEEEEEEEET!
[deleted]
That is the kind of car you would not eat snacks in.
No grills allowed.
"Next up, the Tesla Model T"
I want to see the rear hatch open.
I don't know. Not a fan of cars without dashboard. I hope this is AF
Only thing I would change is the steering wheel - put the one from the S in there!
"Yeah, that car definitely puts the 3 in s3x!"
The future is now 
I look forward to this costing about 50k in the UK. 
"I doubt it gets delivered looking like that.

RemindMe! 1 year"
"Once again, looks kinda weird. Someone hand me the ""I have no mixed feelings"" reaction image please."
"Oops, there goes my wallet.."
It definitely has an Aston Martin feel to the front. Overall it looks fantastic!
These are the worst pictures I've ever seen. 
this is a thing of beauty...
"Between this and the Chevy Bolt, EVs have gone mainstream. Ten years ago it seemed impossible, some still can't believe it. But if it weren't for Tesla Motors, we wouldn't be here.

&nbsp;

Thank you Elon Musk and everyone at Tesla Motors."
I really think this will be the car that changed the world in a fundamental way.  
Ferrari FF + Porsche Panamera + Tesla Model S = Model 3 and I am completely okay with this.
"Looks absolutely amazing. I wish they'd kept the grill like the one on the Model X, but it's such a small thing that it's really not worth complaining about. I absolutely LOVE the matte grey. Makes it look much sportier than the glossy colors. The overall style is so fantastic, I can't get over it.

I'm still wondering what Elon meant by ""It won't look like other cars."", though. It looks like a normal car to me, with a little Porsche and Ferrari accents. And maybe a little more futuristic."
Looks slightly wonky but I'm okay with it. 
"One thing to keep in mind, these are preproduction models. They have the general design down but they will still change details and iron out some stuff by launch. Many of the criticisms you guys have, like with the touchscreen will likely be resolved by launch. Don't stress out too much about the little things :)"
"Thank you Elon for not making a weirdmobile.

I can't wait to put one in my driveway."
It looks like a 2000's Citron 
"idk how to feel about this... front looks like ugly Multipla, one screen in the middle is crazy in my opinion, it completely disconnect driver from the car and makes all passengers and driver at equal position. I want to feel as a driver, I want to be a driver of my car. mehhh... I guess I will pass on this one and wait for Audi & BMW electric cars for masses. Also Elon talks about air pollution like everything is happening because of transport, it is not true, what about food production?"
"I'm sorry. But I hate the front of it. Please, Tesla, put a fake grill. Please."
[deleted]
"Ladie and gentlemen, the Ford Fusion"
"No way this isn't the best looking car at or below $35,000. I know that's a sweeping generalization but that's a damn fine looking car!
"
I don't like the front without the accent piece
"Can't get myself to like the interior with that steering wheel :( Also, not criticizing at all, but first look at this reminded me of a Porsche Panamera!"
"I think it has a roadster front, body S and roof X...cool!"
There really should have been more shots from the top. I wasn't crazy about the front end and lost enthusiasm until I saw it from above. Wow...
The front reminds me of a Porsche 911 http://imgur.com/uPs5mk9
I'm wondering what the next S will be like now.
I love it.....too bad I am not in the US....
"So, it can fit a 7 foot surfboard, Elon said.  That confirms it's a hatch, which I'm pleased to see, although we didn't see any of them with the doors open...

We really need to see these in daylight with the doors open (and better shots of the interior)."
Colors and options ... least there's time to decide.  Plenty ... of ... time.
I love the car. I feel like she's the love child of a Model X and S that had a baby not knowing their genes also have Porsche Carrera mixed in. 
"How much?
"
"Holy crap, that's **RED**!"
"did they say anything specific about the dimensions, full length wise?"
I will own one of these cars in less than 3 years. Someone set a remind me
Holy shit! For that price it looks looks like a Porsche
🔥
There doesn't seem to be a speedo. Has it been confirmed if this will be using a heads up display?
I'm ready for S3X model 
Can't wait to have this shipped to me from out of state too.  Thanks free market society!
Looks like Aston Martin... Focus. 
"I'm not too hyped about the dashboard, the rest looks great however."
"Soo, Electric Camry Lotus?"
Look how easy it is to imagine the steering wheel done away with.  
"I'm probably the only one, but I don't really like the shape of Teslas.  Looks sleek and sporty in the front and then the back just looks kinda bulky.  "
One jerky knee and that ipad thing is coming off. 
"I'm torn between putting down the $1,000 or investing that thousand in TSLA..."
White interior so delicious. Untill you've driven in it for a few years.
"This isn't a Toyota competitor, it looks like a C class competitor. 

 They could've went with regular windshield/rear window, regular doors handles, no autopilot, smaller screen etc and most likely can go as low as 30k 

But this is a nice technique to keep their brand elevated and firmly in the luxury department.  Otherwise it would've gotten diluted if you insert cheap option less models. "
What a beautiful car!!
So the rear ends kind of just got rounder? 
What's the solution to these if you don't have a driveway/garage? I can't run a power cable into my street.
"I'm a big fan of Tesla.

But did they really just slap a monitor to serve as the whole dashboard?"
"So, I have two years to save up? "
Oh my god that black one gives me a Bat-Boner.
It looks like a Koi Fish.
"The more I look at the car, the more it looks like a prototype.

Super excited for Tesla though. The shape of the car is amazing! Hopefully the interior will be more fleshed out in the 'final' production model."
I assume this one won't have 40 inches of headroom either :(
"Elon Motherfuckin' Musk.

In a few years the whole road will be filled with these. 

He actually did it. A cheap electric autonomous car.

Think of the next iteration. Cheaper, more efficient and probably a better design too.

The future is bright."
"Are all three cars they showed the exact same trim package? It seems like the middle one is angled a little different in the back, but it could just be the angle the cars are positioned on stage."
"With RAD/3d printing, why can't we design our own car bodies for these?"
"Great looking car, fantastic lines. However, car companies need to stop with the mentality of getting rid physical knobs, buttons for the sake of making everything touch screen. People like being able to change volume of the radio without looking and just using muscle memory to adjust volume. Same with radio stations, AC, fan control etc. Going touchscreen with everything may seem more fancy, but it is really undesirable to many people."
"Front is completly ""stolen"" by Porsche. Asked different people all said immediatly Porsche."
"Looks like a regular car, though shiny!"
I really like the nose. There's a little nod to the grill without having a fake grill.
"Posted minutes after midnight on April Fools Day.... 

I'm super excited and yet highly skeptical.

15 minutes earlier and I would be ludicrously excited."
What happens when the display gets stolen? 
I'll offer up my first unborn child so the Musk can mold him into a proper apprentice. 
That matte color is absolutely sexy. I want one so badly.
"Looks great. Only issue i have is the slightly high roofline.

Also wouldnt it be distracting for all the info to be in the centre console? I prefer the usual tesla interior."
Interior minimal 
Matte Black here I come!
Who else thinks that they could have done better job with dashboard. Just one gigantic tablet looks lame.
The car grill is iconic. I wish they kept the S grill. 
"Holy shit, there are going to be Teslas everywhere in a few years. Besides being extremely economical, this has to be one of the most gorgeous cars in its price range."
Personally this is the best looking Tesla design yet imo. Looks better than I anticipated.
"Can someone explain why relying so heavily on a touchscreen is a good idea? 

It seems really stupid to me. A distracting thing that you have to take your eyes off the road in order to mess with. Seems like a huge safety hazard that is driven by techie fanboyism rather than practicality.

Hoping they have more physical controls in the actual model 3."
Could someone photoshop a shot of the Model 3 next to a Leaf (which is what I drive) at the exact same scale to see how they compare? Maybe even overlay them on top of each other. I'm really curious how the size and shape and wheelbase compare.
"It'll have to grow on me, I'm sure it will. Right now, I'm not a huge fan of the exterior and interior. It just looks to abnormal.

The Model S is amazingly cool because of how nice it looks inside and out, and keeps relative normality with things cars have (like a grille in the front). "
"I have a question: If I buy Two Tesla Model 3 vehicles will I be eligible for Two $7,500 Tax credits, or Only 1? "
When I first saw it it reminded of this car from Mad Max. http://imgur.com/WwQl4uH

You da real MVP. 
no driver display (behind steering wheel) on the silver car...must still be in concept?
"dat clean, minimalist, almost skeleton interior

Best looking regular-(wo)man's electric car yet! Go Elon!
Yep. Looks like a car alright.
"I think it looks bad. The front is just so empty. I already wasn't fond of the X, but this is just terrible. A faux grill would be nice, or other styling fetures to break the bland look. Also, the interior is just awful. An iMac stuck to the dashboard and that's it. What a terrible idea. It also looks like it's not even OLED, so it'll be terrible at night."
"I REALLY like the interior.  A simple digital interface is what every car needs.  

I don't see a speedometer in front of the wheel, is the speed displayed on the display?  Projected on the windshield?  

Ugh I wish I could have one."
i need gauges behind my steering wheel. only complaint
Am I the only once that really dislikes the interior? It's completely devoid of instruments and feels empty to me 
"Yup, Tesla's share price is going to skyrocket."

"Poor Chevy bolt will be a decent car, but definitely the ugly step sister."
"While everyone is saying the interior is a work in progress, I sat in a Model S over the weekend for the first time, and I couldn't believe it had no steering wheel controls. For things like switching between radio stations I would rather not look away from the road. On my car my stations are still physical buttons which I can feel, but when I drive my dad's car which has a touchscreen control, I am ever thankful for the ability to change volume quickly and channel as well on the steering wheel."
It feels unfinished. Concept car-ish.
"Ugh, Tesla. Always look so ugly, boring, and soulless."
Looks like a piece of shit.

Can't wait to hear about how terrible the build quality of this thing is
damn seems like its gonna be hella sunlight in that car and heat
Am I the only person skeptical about preordering a car that nobody has driven and has already been announced to have less features than subsequent models?
"They played it safe - wise move. It's not practical for me, but it will have its market."
Im not a fan of the LCD screen
So ugly. The model S is sleek but this is UGLY.
Is their any proof to this.... I can't trust anyone on the internet today...
"I feel like Im living in a different universe from these comments. The interior is plain jane and the outside reminds me of a Ford Fiesta.  I think some people need to take off their Tesla goggles. I was really looking forward to this car, but what a let down. "

The joys of living in the Bay Area. Most people have seen only pics. I saw one at the movie theater tonight.
Awful design with that screen in the center. ITT: take my money. All hail Elon Musk.
"are yall niggas serious or is this some kind of joke? you actually think this car looks good? LOL what the fuck

the back of the car looks straight up hideous

edit: downvotes telling me that you guys are serious. holy shit. it's actually blowing my mind that people think this car looks good."
But does it suddenly and without any kind of warning burst into flames?
"Everyone here like ""where is the hud?"" 

And im like ""where is the clutch?"" 

In all seriousnes, are teslas always automatic because i would love to drive in a tesla with clutch. "
I'll stick with my evo X thankzzzz
That range though. Yuck.
Me too! We can see traffic lights now!
"This is the most concept car like production model I've ever seen.

The interior looks so...futuristic.   So... Beautiful."
"I said it in a previous thread pre-reveal, but it's absolutely a game-changer for us tall drivers. As in, it was my last reservation before taking the plunge. Small cars have always been more or less off-limits.

This car is perfect."
Maybe production tooling will go higher?
"> As a tall driver this design makes me very happy.

Me too! No more hunching over to see the traffic lights!"
"All those windows would kinda suck for driving in the hot bright texas sun.  But if im rollin at night in the city,snorting cocaine, and getting hand jobs from a male prostitute, this car is awesome.  Is it compatible with iPhones?"
"Honestly, I am a little bummed.  The full view roof would seem to eliminate the possibility of an S-style hatch..."
I love everything about the interior but the fact that there isn't a dashboard in front of the steering wheel where I can see my speed and all that kind of bothers me.
"I'm guessing different trim levels. Some handles looked like S handles that autopresent.  Maybe the other shape doesnt autopresent, like more base level."
"I would be surprised if they didn't eventually settle on one style, these are basically realistic concept cars. The details will probably be pretty different by the end of next year. "
"The reveal on screen video had the elongated L shaped ones. I assume they are the current design. The car on the left on stage had model s style ones, I assume they are older ones. "
"They're all unfinished version. They'll likely settle on one design. It's a good way to get the publics opinion on each vehicle's aspects which vary. N amount of people like (this) car's handles, but those people didn't like (that) aspect. 

They've got a while to decide what they want to do and how to test the public on what we want out of it. 


I really don't like the no gauges behind the wheel. It's on par with Apple considering removing the headphone jack. Yeah it'll be a logical decision someday, but I think today is too soon. "
Thats what I want to know.. Is it some sort of HUD or is everything just on the large center screen?  Or is there just not one in these prototypes?
"The Prius and Yaris do not have a dashboard as a cost-cutting measure. I fully expected this car not to have one either because they're trying so hard to keep it at $35k and apparently did not compromise on range. For comparison, competitors like the Leaf are about $35k but have a range of only 80 or so miles."
"According to the test drives just now, there isn't one. All info on that center screen :/"
"> Where's the dashboard?

If you can find the first drive experience through periscope right now they ask the guy driving about that and he says that everything is done through the big screen, he mentions that they didn't want people having to look at two different areas and just focus on one display."
"There isn't one! I am guessing they didn't want to show it at this point. Unless it has heads up display, you wouldn't want to look at the console screen to see your speed, etc..."
"Its a concept car, real dash will look nothing like that.  This car is still 18 months away from production."

"Reminds me of the Saturn Ion [dash](http://images.gtcarlot.com/pictures/41152255.jpg).

I used to have one, you get used to looking in the middle pretty quick."
Where are the air vents? 
"Wouldn't put it beyond Tesla to have no dashboard as part of April Fools. Tomorrow we see the ""real"" dashboard. "
not a fan of the display placement. it looks tacked on when the lack of dash behind it. I know they are trying to change how we perceive interiors but the screen size is even more distracting with so little around it. Perhaps lower it a few inches?
I really hope they add a dashboard behind the wheel.  I never liked a center mounted speedometer or instrument cluster for some reason. 
The minimal interior bothers me.... 
"No dasboard, no (adjustable) air vents, no glove compartents, no buttons for emergency lights or lock the doors,... 

It looks really neet but also pretty freaking scary. I hope they didn't go too much style over function here."
It might be on the huge panel in the middle. And I would bet it has a HUD for at least speed.
..It's not even close to completion..
"Without a HUD, I think it's dumb. I'll still buy it though. 

Make any argument you like, but I don't think looking to the centre screen makes a whole lot of sense.

"
"No dash, you have to plug in your iPad pro."
"It's a concept car at this point, there will be a presentation before it is sold with a closer approximation of the production car. "
You realize this is a mock up?
I saw a periscope of a test drive...there is no dashboard apparently it's all on that one big screen.  Not a huge fan of that (and one of the more obvious pieces of cost cutting) but for the price I'd rather they cut the normal instrument cluster and give autopilot and supercharging.
"Lol, ""dashboard"". What, are we in the 20th century or something?"
https://youtu.be/rjQtzV9IZ0Q
"Oh shit, I LOVE [those wheels!](http://i.imgur.com/r0duucV.png) Look very aggressive and futuristic. They're basically the aero wheels done right. I can imagine they're not everyone's thing tho. "
Those are the energy efficient wheels....ugly....but will not come standard. So dont worry :) 
"Yeah, not a fan of the wheels on that one. The others rock, though."
Giant concept wheels
Those wheels change shape to be more efficient at high speed which I think is just the coolest. At low speeds/stop they will look like the just recently discontinued S 19'' rims. But the wheels on the red one... wow those are beautiful.

With  [sharkie grille](http://i.imgur.com/a80FLcm.jpg)
"I have to admit, I'd like a faux grill like that. "
That makes the front look like an Aston Martin
I would laugh if someone actually did this once they got theirs. 
[deleted]
Ohhhhh shit this is good
Aston Tesla PB7
that looks like a boring ICE car!
"Did you hear some guy in the crowd yell ""YOU DID IT, ELON!""  ?
"
"Yes, yes they did.  Honestly I was expecting a dinky little car like a Fiat or Leaf.  Something along those lines.  Was so not expecting something that looks almost exactly like the Model S.  Well done Tesla!"
Made a prototype?  Everyone does that.  Every year.
">and hats off to the designers for going all in on removing the faux grille. no need for that regressive design anymore. we're in the future now.

I'm not sure I'm over it just yet but electric cars still have components that need to be cooled."
I can't believe it but I think it's their best looking car. I really didn't expect it to be so nice. I just figured they'd compromise on styling for mass market. 
"Yeah, I like it, it gives a sort of more refined Ford Focus RS vibe, my brain does expect something in nosecone though."
"Grills look good. It's not ""regressive"". They're better than a blank space. "
More like vestigial parts. My coworker was really upset there was no grill on the front. I asked him what he wanted to cool. He took it back. 
"We need screenshots of the center screen to see if any info is hiding on the control panel
"
I'm a little concerned about it for theft purposes.
"Yeah same, I really like the huge sunroof: https://twitter.com/LanceTheDriver1/status/715749545611624448"
I agree! It looks like they rethought and improved the center console.
"don't get too attached, that will change.

probably not the touchpad post mount, which I liked. 

but there weren't any dash instruments and a lot of the center console looked roughed in. "
I would never get a bright white interior like that. All I see is a stain magnet.
Shark nose! 
"Sigh, I'll take your Model S..."
"I actually like it without the nose cone, but I was expecting more like the X front.. I think it will grow on me though, like the model x did. "
"I bought my S in December. I was kind of hoping I'd hate the 3 so I wouldn't feel bad. The 3 is awesome. 

The wait time is the only reason I'm not selling my S and buying 2. "
"I love the 3, but I'll probably end up swapping my S for another S when the time comes. Only because I have two kids and the space comes in handy. Really curious to see how much the top-spec 3 will end up costing though.

"
"I'd personally rather have the S.  The 3 looks a bit too...sporty?  I don't really know how to put it, but I'm not a big fan of how it looks, especially the back.  Of course, it's the only Tesla option I can even consider."
I'm guessing this isn't the final form of the interior.
"Yea. And as much as I love big screens.. Idk, it's huge. Rather keep it slightly smaller and built into dash. "
"Yeah, I wish it was more integrated into the dash."

Maybe it slides away?

"Oh I actually really liked that.

My first thought was that it must be an off-the-shelf 1080p touch panel, and that was partially how they would bring down the price of the console, etc."
Is it actually a iPad? Sorry if that is a dumb question. 
I think that's just a concept mockup. The actual screen will almost certainly be different. I would be impressed if the final screen were that large though. 
No.  The monitor setup on the model S looks dumb.  This is really cool.

"Well then don't look at it, as the car drives you to your destination ;)"
Tesla doesnt really do interior ergonomics. 
"Have they said anything about what happens if that screen fails? The car seems like it would be bricked. I don't know how you would drive or control anything with no buttons or speedometer/battery level. 

"
Apparently we don't need a gauge cluster either!
I wish that the line of the front was more pronounced. Like a shark.
[deleted]
"Just to remind everyone: In a normal car, more than 75% of the total energy escapes through the radiator! The grill is the symbol of inefficiency. "
"Removing the grill was a good idea, but I think it could have been done better. There's still a place where ""the grills should go"", and it looks like something is missing, which is jarring. Air-cooled Volkswagens pulled off the ""no grill"" look really well, as they were designed in a way that the grill didn't look like it was missing. Besides the Bug and Bus, the Fastback, Sqaureback, and Karman Ghia all are good examples of how to design the front end of a car that has no front grill."
"Lack of grill kills the look of the front, that's precisely what it needs. It looks like a plastic toy atm. "
Idk the flat nose doesn't appeal to me.  
I like it. The motor is in the rear. Both rows of seats get way more legroom this way.
It makes it look kind of like a mid-engined car. TBH I don't like it.
That thing is beautiful. Well done.
How much was the wrap? Turned out amazing!

"I was close to buying Mazda 3 at one time.
 Beautiful car."
"It looks like a Panamera and a Ferrari California put together.

I was thinking it looked like a Mazda with Porsche headlights.
"Here's what the roof looks like from inside:

I hope so too I likethe flush screens in the S/X
Look at the old x prototypes and they had a screen that was similarly not flush with the interior.. 
"> because I'd be stupid enough 

you don't have to be stupid to break it.

you just use it, tap it, swipe it etc etc for a few years, and it would start breaking.

im confident this is just a protoype tho, no way they'd be so stupid to leave it as is."
"thats one thing i cannot approve, the gauge cluster should never be in the middle."
Could be a center locking hub like you have on Porsche or other higher end sports cars.
Fancy caps to hide them. Look closely.
[deleted]
It has LTE! and the chrome handles are not extended so they will work like the ones on the X if they make it to the production verrsion
"Thank you, Elon, for not making one available in ""Rose Gold."" "
"The interior is very much work in progress. The Model X had a similar minimalist layout and the center screen sticking out of the console, and it changed quite a lot until the production version. Don't expect the interior to look like this when the car goes into production one and a half years from now."
Looks extremely plain to me. 
"I love it so much that they've taken the look of the hood from the Roadster. I like the Tesla logo on the S and X, but I love the flat logo on the Roadster and now the 3.

Edit: Not like the entire roadster with the air intake."
... I can't think of any. This is going to be my next car.

I'm as hyped as the next guy but let's not get carried away. It's got the front end of a porsche panamera http://imgur.com/fMUZF0e
"I lol'd when some guy in the crowd yelled ""YOU DID IT, ELON!""

I was thinking that the front end looked like a cross between a new Porsche 718 and an old Aston Vanquish
"back end still looks clunky though, looks like a sleek lil bug carrying around a huge thorax"
"ferrari front and model s back is just what i see too, so stoked"
Exactly what I was thinking about the front when I saw the red one. It would be so cool if regular cars started looking like sports cars.

"35,000 is a lot more affordable than a 70,000 model S. Plus used ones will be even cheaper"
"35000 initially, five years from launch a pre owned one should be nearing 25000 at the max. That really isn't bad at all."
"If you make 31,000 a year, you can easily get a loan at 1.99% interest (~518 usd a month). At that point you're still following the 20% rule for budgeting a car. 

I didn't do this math btw, I saw it on a website."
"In [this](https://i.imgur.com/pPt6hbt.jpg) angle it definitely looks disproportionately small. But other than that I like the design, especially when viewed from the [side](https://i.imgur.com/DvDTvVD.jpg). Looks like the front has some [Aston Martin](http://cdntbs.astonmartin.com/sitefinity/Reviews-Images/vanquishgal5.jpg?sfvrsn=0) genes in it."
Special UV coat blocks the vast majority of the heat. I've spoken to people who have driven through the Mojave in one with no problem and very little effect on range due to air con.
"Just do it.  It's refundable, and Tesla will take your interest more seriously.  I ordered today, and I expect to test drive an X and an S in the near future just for kicks.

edit: I put down a deposit on a 3 today, I mean, of course."
I totally agree. It is boring. But I think that is their target audience. 
"I was wondering when someone would say this. It looks to me like every other car on the road. Very nice, but it doesn't stand out. At least not in photos.

The marketing is amazing to make people (men) so gaga over an average looking car. By the time it comes out, other manufacturers' styles will be even more updated. "
"So different. The grille is totally obsolete with this, though. "
"It's a prototype, I thought the same of the X prototype but now it looks sick. Give it time."
Why not take a road trip? The supercharger network is going to be pretty sweet by then :D
There's been more than a few people who've moved after pre-ordering Model S's and Xs.  It should just be a case of emailing your delivery specialist and letting them know. 
"That's ironic, actually... a car that's rushed into production like the 3 will never last 12 years+ like your Civic :)

"> As a 20-something, the opportunity cost of a car purchase is huge

This is what a lot of the college students and 20-somethings in this thread who preordered are missing. Factoring in opportunity cost, the car costs more like $70k in lost wealth *per decade,* which is pretty damn significant.

I'm hoping the 3 drives used S prices down, and I'll pick up a used S for like $20k in 2 or 3 years. Still a ton of money, but not *as* bad."
"No these are top of the line models(dual motors, longer range, and the wheels are definitely not the standard ones) they are more expensive."

Electric doesnt need a grill.

Not a huge stretch to assume if you look at the Model S and X concepts. 
"The shark nose and basically an all glass roof are very unique but I do agree. I think Elon and Hanz toned it down a bit so as not to shock everyone all at once. Elon said they would play it safer than the X at a later point time after the ""it won't look like other cars"" comment. "
Obviously he didn't take Homer's suggestions.
"i was worried that they didn't put the HUD into the prototype would switch some people off. They don't put HUDS in prototypes: http://blog.ebayimg.com/motors/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tesla_model_x_prototype_5-533x400.jpg

Model X didn't have one... when it was a prototype."
"No, my son..."
"Trust me, it will grow on you. To me it just seems so.... right. 

The grille you know today only exists on ICEs out of necessity. No ICE car designer sat down and said, this car needs a grille 'just' because it looks better, they did it because it has to be there to allow air to the radiator. "
Were you off of this subreddit yesterday? 
Let's see if it sells like the Ford fusion...
Interior is definetly work in progress
You can watch videos of people taking rides in it to see the doors in action and all
$35k
Panamera mmhmm. 
Do not take my steering wheel from me. You may build it in a way similar to I'Robot but do not take it away.
"TSLA won't rise much more for a while. Most of the value of the M3 announcement came in the prior weeks, it's already an overvalued company as it is in terms of revenue and profit."
"Exactly, nothing kills resale value like dirty scratched white/cream interiors."
I don't know where you live but in the UK you can actually get a free charger from the government installed.
What car does? In the ama for one of the guys who had a test drive he mentioned that it had excellent headroom (this is from a guy who is 6ft with v short legs).
"3D printing aluminium is crazy expensive and slow, you could theoretically do it yourself at home if you have half a million lying about for the machine but it makes no sense for Tesla to do it in factory. Especially when they have experts designing the cars instead of Bob from down the road."
"You need to look at the reality of button and knob control. Tons of wires, tons of complexity, tons of failure points. Have you ever pulled a dash? Re-wired a car? It's not easy or straight-forward. And it's not lightweight or cost-effective. And it's fixed. 

You can't change the behavior of a switch, or add a new one on-the-fly. Tesla pushes over-the-air updates all the time, sometimes adding new features or behavior to the user-interface."
"You are right, but I think that won´t be a problem for long as autonomous driving is arriving faster than ever."
Call off the production guys we have 115k pre orders but this guys says it's shit!
The info is on the center screen. Probably to save money by avoiding a separate gauge cluster. 
Better be.  That's bordering on unsafe.
Top left corner of the display. 
"Very probably there will be something added in the usual ""gauge cluster"" area, unless they go with some fancy projection system. The interior was ... spartan (except for apparently proper drink holders?). I expect that is part of the ""part 2"" reveal closer to launch."
They'll probably be there in the final production
It's not the final version. They will change stuff before it's ready to be shipped next year. 
They are gorgeous!! And functional.
ELI-dumb? 
Wtf does that mean?
"The Model S does have steering wheel controls.

https://www.teslamotors.com/support/walkthrough-steering-wheel-controls
"
"Almost, as if, this is not the final product"
They had to go with what they had - it was not an option.
What's your ideal looking car then?
From who? 
UV coating stops that. They do think about these things...
Is refundable.
"Nah, but a lot of people have hold tesla with high regard and are fairly confident that they'll make something they like. "
"It's worked well in the hobby world for ages now, it's just moving to the car market as we speak..."
"Less features because of much lower price, seems fairly normal. But yeah, people have a lot of faith in Tesla"

Whats not practical about it?
Google.. this was streamed and you'll see these photos everywhere.
The announcement was yesterday so you're safe
"They're at 35,000. I'm guessing thats the price without any options though"
Its always been $35k don't know where people keep pulling this 30k from.
As real as it gets :)
Yessir. 
No it isn't. Has a normal trunk 
"You can put that 13K toward your AWD, because it won't come on the base model "
"It's funny you re-iterate the ""no warning"" statement when in reality the few Teslas that caught fire literally displayed a warning to pull over and exit the vehicle. Nobody has been hurt or burned in a Tesla fire. Compare that to the 410 car fires a day. "
What are you talking about? Clutch? Gears? I don't think you know how an EV works. You have one ratio from stop to top speed. 
[deleted]
So you drive over 215 miles a day and aren't a truck driver? 
At last! Just in time for when we won't need to (autopilot)!
"So white and easily scuffed :D

That is seriously the first thing that went through my head when they rolled out on stage. ""White upholstery, great, that's going to be impossible to keep clean""!

I can never focus on the important issues."
"The interior is just a concept, no air ducts etc. It would also be a terrible idea to not add any instruments but just the screen in the middle."
Another thing that helps is that your feet can go where the engine was. I completely believe it can fit 5 comfortable adult passengers.
"Looks like they have a cross beam where the visors are for structure, which makes sense. I'd love it if it went all the way up like the X but this seem like a pretty decent compromise."
"From the pictures of the rear it actually does seem to have an S-style hatch. Or at least, the rear glass is part of the hatch."
"Yeah, seems like a design that's really looking forward to lots of autonomous driving. Some sort of HUD for the driver would be nice. "
I think the x's push handle is the way to go. Efficient and to the point
I personally don't like the auto present handles. It was cool at first but it just feels like something extra I can break on my S. 
">Some handles looked like S handles that autopresent.

They sure do look like it, but surprisingly they don't!  [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4cueuo/lets_compile_all_our_model_3_facts_in_one_place/) 

I can see why they went with a mechanical handle. In some ways the Model 3 design is simpler than either the S or X. It eliminates both the motorized handles and the motorized door. This simultaneously lowers cost and raises reliability (to the delight of /u/ippomaka, /u/the_boomr, and /u/thatsmyaibo upthread). 

>It seems that perfection is attained, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take away.

~~My theory is that the mechanical handle is the same shape as the retractable one so Tesla can easily offer a ""Retractable Handle Package."" That way all the Model 3 door panels remain identical, with a single cutout that fits both mechanical and motorized handles.~~

~~So what about the other handles, the ones that *don't* look like the Model S?~~

~~They're the old mechanical design, before Tesla realized they could do that. ;)~~

edit: according to [this sibling comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4ctt9t/model_3_reveal_pictures/d1ljb2t) (props to /u/bret_with_1_t) my theory is incorrect, since **Tesla reps confirm the L-shaped handles are the newer design revision.** Oh well!

[deleted]
"If you can find the first drive experience through periscope right now they ask the guy driving about that and he says that everything is done through the big screen, he mentions that they didn't want people having to look at two different areas and just focus on one display."
"The interior looks unfinished.  Looks like a concept car.

I'm guessing they will add another screen closer to production."
"Looks like it'll have a HUD. The content on the screen looks to be Spotify on the right side, ""night view"" of a map on the left side, and menu options on the bottom. No room for vehicle information. "
I'd say either HUD or similar to the new Prius with everything centered.
"What does ""HUD"" stand for?  "
Nissan Leaf just shit its pants.
axing the dash to keep costs down is just about the worst way of cost cutting in a car of such magnitude of importance like the 3
"Okay, how much extra for the dashboard?"
Leaf is over 100 currently and this year's model is rumored to be closer to 150.
[deleted]
How would I know how fast am I going?
That's the only thing I don't like.
It's possible that they could have a HUD on the windshield like BMW does. I can't imagine the safety issues with having everything on the center screen and taking eyes off the road.
[deleted]
Surely they don't actually think that it's somehow *more* convenient to look at the center console than to look through the steering wheel.
Really? That can't be right 
"The Mini Cooper has the speedometer in the middle.  The tach and a few other warning lights are behind the wheel, but it's not a huge deal.  Most people have a pretty good feel for what speed they are travelling at anyway, and most often you are just flowing in traffic.  It would be fine if the speedometer in the 3 was only in the middle, but i'm guessing they will have a package that puts more info like autopilot status behind the wheel."
"Maybe they are preparing for autopilot to pretty much take over at that time? In a car that can drive itself 99% of the time, do you need a dashboard?"
"https://www.periscope.tv/w/1OyKAqOnNvNKb

No dash confirmed."
I wouldn't call this a concept car.  Late stage prototype is more fitting.

Graduating soon; so glad I picked computer science.
"In college right now, how does one afford a Tesla model 3 now?"
"Got an exam tomorrow, let's do this."
"As somebody who fucked his life up and might not ever be able to get a model 3, study your ass off and don't fuck up. Get a good job and don't spend too much money on dates until you can afford to do that while still paying off your house and car or whatever. Be careful about what you do and don't let other people make critical decisions for you. "
College Sophomore. Just pre-ordered! Work hard and you'll be there 
"Didn't go to college. Followed my heart. Could actually afford. 

I hope you're both there because you want to be there. Not just so you can potentially buy things later. "
"wow . you guys, can you ask your dad is he adopting a  42 yr old IT consultant ? i am completely independent  but no family. i would like a dad who can give me Model 3."
"Way ahead of you, don't have gf"
Who needs a girlfriend when you have a 3 anyway?
I told my bf months ago I'd be pre-ordering.  He was unimpressed.  I just flailed during the reveal and made him come look.  Now he asked if he could have one.  +1 to don't tell your SO. :P

what was you career path out of college tldr? Im a curious recent grad.
"Do you know of any studios that i could send my soundtrack music to? I worked on an indie feature and write singles, both genre and soundtrack (w/ o a film) and upload them to soundcloud. People tell me I'm decent but I don't know where to send the music to for review and so I can be judged. 

I've also heard of film composers having agents. I know nothing about that but it sounds great. "
What city/country?  Also how rich are Parents? 
"well actually tesla doesnt pay for advertising. They think the product is so good that it shouldn't need it. And they take all the money that other car companies spend on super bowl commercials and whatever else and put it back into research and development to make the product even better. We do in fact need to change to sustainable transportation, it isn't just a luxury. However, It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything. "
It's a good thing I love my job then. 
"As someone who graduated with a bachelors in advertising I couldn't agree more. But that fact does not make me want this car any less. 

If this car had an exhaust pipe if fuck it. "
But Elon Musk doesn't advertise. He does and we follow because he is awesome. 
It's not advertising's fault your job sucks.
You don't need a car? Especially one that will save you significant amounts of money in the long run?

Good call. My friend that became an electrician is only a couple years out of college and makes well above 6 figures.
"Well... the point of going to college is to get the education to get a job, to get money, to buy things... so I don't think it's unreasonable?"
Feel free to live in a box in the middle of a the woods.
Some people Will for sure make that to their model 3s. 
Someone actually stole this pic and posted it on the tesla twitter page.
That is actually kind of awesome.
yeah if you aren't going to put a grill in it at least do something with that space. You need something to break up the view of the front end. It just looks wrong having such a huge unbroken part in the front.
Aston Martin or a sportier Ford Fusion.
"I would consider it, which is probably why it's a good thing I'm nowhere close to affording one.  Though, I do like how it looks as is."
"It scores better in the test, that's why they have it"
The volkswagon xl1 has a coefficient of friction of 0.189 and has a fairly [flat front](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/2013-03-05_Geneva_Motor_Show_7986_zoom_in.JPG)
"I have choosen to overwrite this comment, sorry for the mess."
"He seemed so nervous, and that guy seemed to make his day."
"Other than that, that guy was fucking annoying."
"If the motor is in the back, a grill won't really help with that. "
"Neither the S nor the X have a front grill. The S does have a kinda faux-grill plastic nosecone, though.

There are actually air intakes and radiators in the front of both the S and X... they are just much smaller than their ICE counterparts and don't need a massive intake in form of a grill."
"Most cars now a day get most of their cooling from underneath the car. You can block the grille it won't do anything. 

But imo the grille gives a face to car with out it it looks bald. "
Grills must create serious drag  and energy waste?
"Yeah, but they don't have a radiator behind the grill like a petrol car.

They can arrange airflow over the motors via other routes. "
">yes they do.  There is an air intake on the front of the 3, it is very low and not very tall.

"
"Some reviewer told on the top upper left corner you have speedometer so no dashboard, that is so cool."
I think that may be the one design feature (perhaps along with the screen) that I am not fully sold on yet.
Don't park that thing outside in SF. Can't imagine how expensive it would be to fix a broken sunroof that big. 
The only think I do t like about my S is the cup holders. 
awww
A greater favor has never been granted.
Hopefully the S will be face lifted with the updated design language.
"ya, probably just a simple way to afix the screen onto a placeholder dash. I'd expect it to be integrated by production."
"yeah, they probably would have showed that off more if it was anywhere near final."
i was gonna say that the interior looked a little ..... too minimal for my taste
Wish we would get pictures then.  No way I would order a car with the interior shown.  Buyers remorse would be extreme once the novelty wore out.
Look at the new Mazdas. They have the tacked on iPad too. 
"Keep in mind that it is a touchscreen that drives pretty much all of the controls in the car.  Sometimes you need to touch something while driving, and having large touch targets makes this much easier.   I'm pretty coordinated in general, but I definitely miss the icons on the screen sometimes while driving just because the car is bouncing a little and you are mostly looking at the road in front of you.  A bigger screen is really easier to use.  Also, it doesn't seem so big after a week or so.  :)"
"I hope its oled, that way at night only the necessary things on the screen will be lit."
"Maybe it will be removable and you will have an option for what type of screen to put in there
"
It's smaller than the Model S. 15 vs 17 inches.
So mostly everyone seems to be in agreement on that. I prefer the slightly smaller more out of the way screen on the S. Under most circumstances I'm spending most of the time looking at the road and not the screen. 
Will agree with you on that. 
No. Just a large tablet.

Um...no? They only has cruise autopilot don't they?
But it doesn't yet sooo....
"In the periscope of the first test drive, the Tesla employee states there will only be the one central screen where gauges can be displayed. "
"Yeah an HUD seems like a solid speculation right now. Hopefully we see some test ride footage soon.

Edit: Looks like no HUD. The gauge cluster appears to be at the top right corner of the 15 inch horizontal screen."
"Sharks never look back, because they don't have rear view mirrors."
you aren't the only one the obvious place to have a grill just being flat plastic with rounded edges yuck!
"The front is the worst bit, if it had an imitation grill it would really finish off the design. The fanboys are going to love whatever Musk shits out though. "
Do explain.
Just wanted to remind you that electricity production is also quite inefficient. 
"Lol, and do you think the electric energy for this car is created without heat? Come on."
I thought it was out the tailpipe...
">  The grill is the symbol of inefficiency. 

this is a strange comment

the grill's there for oxygen intake.  you need that for ICE. it's not there just for show."
yeah it's kinda weird
Thanks!
"Hey thanks. It was $5,500 for the main wrap plus $500 for the blackout."
"Thanks, gonna have to come up with something new, at least I have 1.5 years to think about it :)"
That explains a lot. 
"I like the porsche-looking front end.  

The Model X looks too fat."
I actually don't like Panameras but I definitely think the 3 looks better.
It looks like The Future.
Can it be covered? I'm picturing that straight overhead summer sunlight fucking my shit up.
To be honest my Auris with full glass roof looks a bit better on the inside. But it a smaller car.
"It kinda makes financial sense, when you need to make cars that will work for both sides of the road. A flat dash with an instrument cluster in the middle only needs to be made once."
"As a [Scion xB](http://cdn.pinthiscars.com/images/scion-xb-interior-wallpaper-1.jpg) driver, I agree with this."
"I've never run out of fuel as often as when I owned a Buick with a fuel gauge in the middle.  Out of sight, out of mind."
"That was my thinking as well when wifey bought her Citroën C4, now I kind of like it tho... Seriously this is something that has to be tried, I HATED the idea initially now it's good. The middle of the steering wheel doesn't move tho, I know I know, better airbag and whatnot, it just makes me nervous when I turn the wheel and all the buttons won't."
Similar to the audi design.  
we it's not like they glued them on so other than some sort of new fangled F1 racecar mono lug I don't see how they attached the wheels. 
This is just a prototype there's no knowing whether they will have S or X style handles.
"Meh, I'd still have a gas powered car. "
The Panamera's front isn't what's wrong with its styling though
That was my first thought as well. It doesn't look unlike that one Ferrari whose name I don't remember right now as well
"I have choosen to overwrite this comment, sorry for the mess."
But smoother
"I think it looks more like a [Porsche Boxster,](http://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/styles/gallery_slide/public/Box11.jpg?itok=jyPEEttB) what with the smooth hood."
I more see Cayenne/Macan than Panamera
"That is *exactly* what I thought when the first shot of the nose appeared on screen. Very first word in my head was ""Porshe...?"""
"This is what made me think Ferrari:  http://i.imgur.com/kXSTsBV.jpg
"

"I heard a few ""Take my money!""'s."
what ferrari do you look at. It looks like a ford fusion and a porche had a baby.

MS is the Model S...
"No, they cut out the XS to get the price down."
Well I'm jobless so there's that
"Found the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAsW6o1cYWE 
Helped me get a better idea. 

If I pre-order am I guaranteed the $7500 tax credit?"
Only sort of. Electrics still have components to cool. You can still put a radiator in an electric car. 
"It's doesn't matter if it's mechanically obsolete, it's the aesthetic value it brings. The car needs someone in that space. "
Do you really think so? Teslas seem like theyre high quality construction. 
well that's not completely true if you factor in gas savings year-by-year
"Well of course, I'm an investor, so I believe in Tesla :D.  I just meant, next stop, Tesla Model T for truck.  "
Youtube is blocked for me at work. Can't watch it yet.
"hmm okey, we will see however I still dont know how to feel about look of the front ;/ "
"Grills look good though. Having a design where the grill is so obvious to spot, but they just decide meh cover it with plastic."
"Yeah you're right, it kinda grew on me, but I still like the Model S more."
But the front looks like it's missing something. If they just made the front more flat I'd like it more though.

"I've seen the periscope feed.  It's just a night time test drive.  Have not seen video of the doors in action...

"I'm 6' 4"" and need more than 39.5 inches of headroom. I don't know what its published specs are but I sat in a Model S and my head was in the moon roof. Stuck with Subarus for now."
"you could use milling machines or carbon fibre over configurable moulds. And you are telling me they can make a self driving car, but not a design program that will let people customise the bodies safely?"
"I prefer buttons and knobs with tactile feedback thank you. Sure it costs more to make, but it isn't all that complicated and not likely to break. Ive never been in a car where stuff stops working besides when people fuck up installing a new head unit. I'm not saying get rid of the touch screen entirely but leave the basic functions as physical buttons. People are going to discover how much they miss physical buttons and knobs when they are forced to use nothing but a touchscreen."
"There are still people who prefer to drive themselves, you know?

"Hm. Either the Model they had at the store didn't have this, or I missed it completely. It was my first time sitting in one, and I spent less than a minute in there. "

"I wasn't sure - I thought that Musk was giving a hint that it would NOT be just a slightly smaller Model S. But that is what it seems to be, and I think it was a wise move as it was the least-likely-to-offend move. It is a nice looking car, but I don't think it is very space efficient for its size."
"For me, there is not enough space in the back to carry things - this was no surprise to me as they had already said it would not be a hatchback. I imagine they will get to a hatchback someday."
"Omg, whoa. This was supposed to be lighthearted. I love Tesla. I just also know of some phenomenal melty-car videos that only involve Tesla."
"And also, since you've brought it up, the first Tesla's to go all melty dodn't have a warning. It was an issue with charging the vehicles, and they were already pulled over because they were charging. There was no warning because the vehicles were ""powered off""."
What? The single-speed reduction is a major feature of not only all Teslas but all EVs
"The Roadster was a 2 speed, but the S, X, 3 all have a single speed transmission attached to each motor.  I guess the dual motors technically have 2 gears, but they are in both gears simultaneously.  You don't need a clutch because electric motors have 100% torque at 0 RPMs and can't stall."
"You've never had to commute in and out of NYC, have you? Can easily be more than 90 miles each way without detours or traffic. Then I can get a call from my wife: Hey! Can you swing by the store on your way home and grab some milk?
  Me: Sorry honey, I've only got 8% charge left and if I hit too many red lights I might get stranded. If only I had a vehicle that I could refuel in five minutes!

I would love to get a Tesla, but it's still not practical for everyone. Maybe the range is enough to commute with... But then I'd need another car to drive if I wanted to do anything after work because charge is depleted.  Not everyone is a robot that only drives 2 trips a day then parks at home."
They had a fabric version that was grayish blue. 
well im sure theyll have color options for the interior at launch..  id go with black or dark grey myself
"I mean, if you can do the tan leather you can do the white."
"Hey, I still love leather interiors.  Like, LOVE.

So, it's a win to me!"
"That'd be welcome news to me.  It appeared that perhaps the trunk/hatch was a non-functional part of the demo cars yesterday, so  was a little disappointed to not get to see that, but if your suggestion is in fact the case I think it'd be nice.  I mean, how else am I going to fit my surfboard in it? ;)"
Yeah but then the doors have to be motorized too which I'm pretty sure costs more than just motorized handles like the S.
"they also get very hot, at least here in sunny California"
"From what I hear, that's something extra that *does* break on the S. I like the idea of push-to-present handles better."
"I'm sure you appreciate the lower drag on a daily basis, whether you're conscious of it or not..."
"I think the handle mechanism is more simplified then powered windows, and therefore more reliable. And nobody wants roll up windows or worried about powered windows breaking."
I wonder how well the mechanical handles will work in climates where they could get iced over during the night. I know people have issues with the motorized handles in that situation sometimes.
">Don't think they could release it without anything there due to safety and stuff.

Not really. As /u/geo32 [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4ctv8o/potential_for_headup_display/d1lexwl), check out the Prius: http://www.moibbk.com/images/toyota-prius-interior-8.jpg"
"Where we are going we don't need a hud https://www.periscope.tv/w/acyZNzFQbUVxeG5Sb0Rqb1l8MWRSS1p5UmtwZ054Qr6Kg1f5323v3DA_KJM1Qqs2jHlk7fO4GSVSokkd43UC

My guess is that it's not ready yet."
That's what I'm hoping for too!

The current Prius doesn't have a gauge cluster in front of the driver - it's all in the middle.
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.5357  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/90605)
What is this periscope crap? I've never heard of them.
That is such marketing talk.  They did it to reduce cost.  A speedo is really all the driver should be paying attention to for the majority of the time.  The other instruments and accessories should only get occasional use from the driver.
"Not according to watching the test drives. This is planned production and air flows thoughout the entire dash. Still possible, but watch the periscope and mashable test drives. They discuss a lot.
"
"agree, but i love the simplisity, hope it ends up close to this"
"The reveal of both Model S and X had unfinished interior. The X even had touch screen buttons on the steering wheel.

Other then horizontal screen i doubt the 3 will look much like this. Elon said things will change between now and next reveal."
HUD
Probably an additional option though.
Heads-Up Display
"I don't think so to be honest. You can lease a Nissan Leaf over here in the UK for the same price as a cheap petrol engined car too. 

I think even at $35k the Model III will remain out of reach for many people.

I earn a reasonable salary and have an extremely strong desire to own a Tesla but think the Model III will still be too pricey for me to stretch to :( "
"I can get a leaf for 13K and upgrade the battery to do 150 miles for 8K
"
it's most likely two years away
"What exactly is on the dash that you actually need? Particularly in an electric car.

Range. Speed. That's about it..."
"At first I found it a strange choice, but the more I get used to it the more I like it. It feels like an intermediate step towards autonomous driving. And I almost always just use the dash for my speed. So it shouldn't be hard to get used to glancing at the top left of the touchscreen for that."
"The Prius and Yaris have a center dashboard as shown in your picture, and so does the Model 3. They do not have dashboards in front of the driver."
Look at the screen?
You and me both. The exterior is awesome. The interior design is leaving a bit to be desired.
"Same here, It's the one ugly the car has, I don't mind the screen, just integrate it into the dash/console, so it doesn't look like an iPad attached to a stand."
Pretty sure the Prius and Yaris have everything in the center screen and there isn't really safety issues with those cars. At least not in that regard that I've heard of but personally I really hate having just 1 center screen for everything. 
"its very strange

like if i wanna check my speedo, im forced to avert my eyes to my right, then down.  not only that, it's gonna be mixed in with a buncha other info, meaning it's gona be a crowded screen."
"Plenty of cars going this way. [Prius dash for example](http://www.iveho.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2405-Toyota-Prius-v-dash.jpg), which is what I have - it's odd having nothing behind the steering wheel at first but you get used to it during your first drive. My Prius has a small HUD that I use just for displaying the speed, so I imagine that will at least be an option for the Model 3."
"You're taking your eyes off the road regardless of where the display is positioned...

Also, with it being in the middle, the information can't be obscured by the steering wheel. :)"
Why do you need your eyes on the road in this car?
"Your eyes are going to be off the road either way. Since its slightly further away, it will take fractions of a second longer to look. Accidents are rarely a difference of milliseconds."
"Except  in the mini it's massive and much closer to the driver. Either way, just because they did it doesn't make it a good idea."
"The Mini Cooper also has a big stupid looking clock in the middle of the dash, but nobody is trying to emulate that. "
Minis have a digital speedometer behind the wheel too.
The first generation of Model 3s will all be in a junkyard before driverless cars are allowed to be used by the general public.
Should've just removed the steering wheel then also.
"No way thats the real interior. Cant imagine the screen will stick on such a thin connector like that...could break off too easily.

Just means a concept car in the sense that the interior hasnt been worked out yet. No problem with that. Kind of what was expected. They show us the car, confirm the specs, and now we wait 18 months to actually see the finished product."
It doesn't even have vents.  I would assume the 3 will at least have A/C
Sure looks like a concept car to me.
"I don't think this is anywhere near the final interior because there needs to be ac vents. I'd be surprised if you can't at least option having a HUD or speedometer in front of you (instead of looking at that center screen).

I think the base model interior might look like these picture, except with a/c vents."
"No A/C vents, eh?"
My bad I thought they were two overlapping plates where a rotational force above a certain level would be enough to compress a spring and let the plates slide forward. I saw a higher res image and its clear they are one solid piece.

And two, I have an urge to help people directly. "
"Nope. I'm buying my model 3 with my hard earned money like everyone else. No, I can't buy it right now, but I will eventually. "

He might have a job lined up already.
"My parents don't pay for anything. I worked hard, got myself a full ride through college and got myself an engineering job! Hard work pays off.

*Edit because you comment was nagging me and I felt the need to say more...On top of graduating with a degree in engineering (which is a ridiculous amount of work) I worked throughout high school and college to have enough money to be able to just drop $1000 on something like this. I worked construction, I waited tables, I worked full time at internships. Don't just go around assuming every young kid is just a spoiled brat of rich parents. Instead of complaining about what your parent's don't give you, go out there and get it for yourself...I just hate when people attribute everything I have for myself to my parents when I am the one who has gotten myself everything. 

Cheers :)"
"To be honest, I wasn't really thinking about money when I was making that decision. I've been back and forth on careers all my life and my test scores pretty much say I can go for anything not social. Working with electricity is pretty much the best mix I have of things I enjoy doing and things I can make a good career out of. I'd rather be happy on shift than rich."

"They said it was like, $4,000,000,000ish in the first 24 hours"
Both the air conditioner and the battery cooler need and have radiators on the S and X. 
"They showed a motor front and rear, actually. It's AWD."
Never seen a Porsche 911?
Radiator up front.
"I saw that video. I was kinda hoping for hud. Surprised there isn't some regulation that mandates an instrument panel behind the steering wheel. Hopefully, with gen 2 autopilot it won't be missed."
"The screen and dash are likely to change IMO, considering this is just an early prototype version."
I could see that.  Didn't someone make some add on cup holders that everyone liked though?
The Model X also had a sort of floating-screen design in the prototype but ended up with an integrated one like the Model S.
As it stands right now that screen is just begging for a kid or dog to put just the right amount of leverage on it.
"May... be guilty of engaging autopilot to make sure I can interact with the screen those rare moments I need to while driving. 7.1 gave me a lot more confidence in its abilities, but still try not to be unsafe/stupid. "
">Sometimes you need to touch something while driving

You shouldn't ever *need* to look anywhere but at the road while driving, or touch anything but the steering wheel. That's why we have controls on the steering wheel, projectors on the wind shield etc.

We're probably missing some information, voice input maybe?"
"I don't like the idea of a touchscreen while driving. Tactile feedback is extremely important - esp when you want to keep your eyes on the road. 

"
"It's just the screen probably lol I wouldn't call it a ""tablet"".  It's how the car is controlled."
Why call it an Ipad lol. 
"Wat. Maybe in cars, yes, but in general, hell no."
Not a dream. Elon has already said that Tesla will be capable of full self-driving by 2017.
"For now yes, but there is a reason this is just part one of the model 3 unveiling.

Go onto youtube and look for MobileEye's latest videos - they are the supplier for Tesla's automation sensor suite."
Autopilot does a lot more than you think. It also works in stop-and-go traffic.
I'm really not sure how I feel about this. Currently that's the only potential negative I see in the car. Everything else is bloody perfect.
"Can be? driving without a speedometer sounds incredibly dangerous. Why would they allow people to turn it off?

And I can see it now. New Tesla driver gets pulled over.

Cop: Do you know how fast you were going?

Driver: Nope. My speedometer wasn't turned on. 

Cop: ಠ_ಠ"
Model 3 is better than sharks
"I can't vouch for the number, but I'm assuming he or she means that ICE cars produce quite a bit of heat. The heat is dissipated through the radiator.

ICEs are generally 20-30% efficient so OP's claim probably isn't far off."
"Internal combustion engines are around 20-25% efficient. That means that of all the energy contained in the fuel, only a fifth reaches the wheels. The rest is almost all heat losses, mostly radiated through the grill, the engine bay or the exhaust.

Electric motors are more than 90% efficient. Around 85% for the whole car, when you factor in battery losses."
I think he means heat loss from the engine.
"At a much greater scale, with efficiency easily over 50%, with waste heat often being used for residential/industrial heating in winter time, massive sophisticated filters to capture more of the pollutants etc...

Also, EV charging happens dominantly at night, when power production tends to come largely from hydro, nuclear and wind where possible.

As a final point, you know the 90 in Tesla Model S P90D? That's 90kWh, or the energy contained in about 4 gallons of gasoline. It manages to travel nearly 300 miles on that. EVs are bloody efficient. "
"I agree, model X is bloated. Actually, I'm not so sure about the 3's back. "
"Yeah, definitely. I'm actually starting to digg the model 3. It's easy for me to like new designs, specially when I want to. "
I believe the window is tinted to block most of the sun
"Yeah, that's my biggest concern...that and the lack of a dash. "
"I have sat in a prius and a yaris with the gauges in the middle and thats where my hatred started. Toyota does it i believe to save money for left and right side drivers. I really hope they have an optional HUD or something because I cannot do that. 
Just googled that, and its very similar to the Prius. I definitely want a gauge cluster in front of me. "
In the little pre-reveal video there was a shot of a wheel with a center locking hub like you describe. Who knows if it'll make production. It's sure to piss of Porche dealers they tried to upsell my friend on a GT3 because of the sport inspired center lock hub design.
snap on cover(s)
True! I actually saw how the handles work from Bjorns video he posted on Facebook. The hockey stick handles seem to be mechanical which I am sure many will prefer I just can't wait till Elon shows us part 2!
That's cool. Though I don't think that ICE cars have a good future ahead of them.
F12 berlinetta?
Have you ever seen a Ferrari? That's such a Porsche look.
"I mean, we're getting near Ferrari F50 acceleration in a $35k car, it seems appropriate."
So which chromosomes are left?
"Well I believe in you, good luck with the search if that's where you're at in life. "
"No, you are not."
"Unfortunately it does not guarantee the $7,500 credit."
"Not guaranteed, but [this](http://imgur.com/9G17Plz) might help explain how it works.  Bottom line, if you do it tomorrow you're likely to get partial tax credit.  If you wait much longer after that you're unlikely to get anything."
By the time the car comes out the limit in the federal tax credit will very likely have been reached. They've already sold well past half of the limit in the S and the X. 
">You can still put a radiator in an electric car. 

They did. But there's no reason to make the radiator bigger than necessary (which would increase drag)."
"Agreed. It does look strange, but I wonder if that's just because every car I've ever seen has a grille or some kind of air ""intake""? I'm also sure they made a ton of design decisions based on aerodynamics, costs, and weight. Also, the final appearance could change between now and late 2017."
"Dude.. When they deliver X and S to customers, they purposely space them apart do you can't see that the doors and panels don't align the same from car to car.  Safety-wise they're fine, but fit and finish is horrible.  "
Electric engines are much less susceptible to wear and tear
"I spend like $750/yr on gas. Saving that money each year while spending $35k upfront really doesn't make a huge difference. Plus add back in increased electricity costs and the savings are even more negligible.

No, I can't think of a single rational justification for buying a Tesla. But I will anyways, because I want one badly enough."

No I'm saying as an engineer the costs involved both time wise and financially make it a poor business decision. Carbon fibre would increase the cost of the materials astronomically and milling takes days for one piece as opposed to seconds using a press. All of that because a couple of people want to have a unique panel is crazy. 
"I think they look badass and aggressive. They're basically what I hoped the aero wheels *would* have looked like originally. Apparently they also close shut at hwy speeds, improving aerodynamics without needing wheel-well covers."

"I know many owners who have had to have the handles replaced. Plus, I can deal with a window motor going out for a weekend. I don't want to have to get into my $75K car from the passenger side. "
At least the Prius has heater vents. This is so not finished.
That prius has something projected right on the screen in front of the steering wheel though.
"There's a massive difference between putting the instrument panel at the bottom of the windshield and sticking it on an ipod at steering column height. The current design probably isn't final, but if it is, it seems like a really bad idea."
I remember thinking the new Prius interior looked pretty nice. Now it looks so... cluttered.

"I was just watching the stream of the test drives and it seems that you are correct, from what the guy said. And he also said that the car is very close to production so little to no big changes.

Seems odd to have to look at the center console area to read your speed."
I would be much less likely to buy the Model 3 if that sort of information were displayed on the center console. It would take much longer to view that information and would make me more likely to be in an accident.
This is what they said in the test drive.

"Millions of people buy BMW 3 series and Mercedes C class every year for more than this. Sure, there are still billions that can not afford them, but that would be true even for a 10k car. This pricepoint is a well established price and performance category that is defined as affordable. Not cheap, but affordable."
"But electric cars have rebates and stuff. And if you get access to their charging stations that's more savings. If your house has solar that's more savings.

While in the model 3 it's where the nav screen is in the Prius, that's just bad design."
"Yeah at the very least allow me to check my speedo without diverting my eyes from the road too much. Maybe battery status isn't a bad idea as well. 

I understand putting most of the stuff on the big screen like GPS navigation but it's a bad idea to put everything there. Some cars do the same thing but even then the speedy is much closer to the edge of the windscreen than here's the case. "
hopefully its got a holo speed hud for the windscreen
"One of the major reasons I didn't get a Prius was this.

[In comparison I felt the Leaf had an amazing dash](http://media.caranddriver.com/ez/images/features/10q1/2011_nissan_leaf-feature/gallery/2011_nissan_leaf_interior_photo_38/3535272-1-eng-US/2011_nissan_leaf_38_cd_gallery_zoomed.jpg)

The speedo is as high as it can get and is very easy to see without taking focus off the road, as is the clock. Behind the steering wheel is the other basics you want to see like battery level and range, warning and notification messages, basic information."
"Hmm, I think I ought to argue your last statement, considering the speeds involved. "
"The further away you look from the road, the less you can see it peripherally. Maybe they'll have HUD as an option? "
"Well, I won't argue with you about it being a good idea or not, but it's acceptable if they decide to go that route.  I think the thing that i look at the most behind the steering wheel is the current song playing and what autopilot currently has the blue highlight on.  In general I know my ballpark speed, so that is at least one thing that actually isn't that important for me.

I personally hope they add another screen behind the wheel, and a lot can change in the next year so we will see what happens."
"It's probably for economic reasons. Less things to swap when producing the cars for countries that drive on the right side vs left side of the car. Makes sense that Mini would do this being that they were founded in the UK, but Americans love them too."

"I expect the same, although folks getting test drives have been asking and at least a couple have been told that the positioning of the screen, etc are near final.

"Charging an electric car costs about 1/3rd of the cost of gas relative to a 30mpg car, so that will save you thousands per year already. Further, there is less to repair in an electric car, and they are expected to last far longer, too, way past the 100k mile limit most traditional cars face. Lastly, electric cars have better resale value at the moment than traditional cars. 

All told, you can pay 35k instead of 25k today, save as much on gas within 5-10 years (depending on how much you drive), save thousands on repairs, and if you decide to sell it in 10 years, you'll get an extra $3-5k for your money. It's a no-brainer."

"I'll believe it when I see it. If they can deliver, so much the better, but I'm skeptical of that claim."
"I think the point is that the Model 3 [won't be capable of fully autonomous driving](http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/10/10746020/elon-musk-tesla-autonomous-driving-predictions-summon). When fully autonomous vehicles arrive, it won't be in the form of a software update they can just push to existing Tesla models."
"It keeps you in your current lane, slows down / stops and accelerates again when the car in front of you does, and changes lanes safely when you put on your turn signal. 

It doesn't detect traffic lights or stop signs and it doesn't make turns for you, change lanes automatically, or otherwise follow a GPS planned route in any way. It's the pinnacle of cruise control but it's a long way from being able to drive you from A to B without any manual driving. "
"I'm with you on that and I think all but one comment I read about it was with you on that too. Even for a demographic that likes the S and the huge console in it most people seem to be in agreement that the big monitor sticking out of the dash in the 3 doesn't really work for them.

I /could/ get used to it, but I much prefer the smaller screen in the S.

As for a gauge cluster most the info that's there on most cars is useless with the exception of the speedometer. "
"I think they're getting us used to it for the future. Autonomous cars won't need a standard dashboard, and they want to get us there as soon as they can."

Pretty sure you won't be able to turn it off. It'll be a persistent overlay.
"A lot of modern ICEs are actually in the 30+% realm of thermal efficiency, nowadays though, like the Prius which is 40% thermally efficient with its little Atkinson cycle engine. But yeah, sounds like that was what OP meant. Still nowhere near electric motor efficiency."
"So not really ""through the radiator,"" but the entire combustion process. The thermal efficiency of the engine. Your first comment was confusing, not to mention a lot of modern ICEs are actually in the 30+% range of thermal efficiency.  The new Prius' Atkinson engine is 40% thermally efficient. 25% is closer to something from the 90s. Still nowhere near electric motors, but yeah."
"Right, but it should be said that you're not comparing apples to apples here. The car's electrical power is largely coming straight from the grid. The vast majority of the United States is still getting most of their electrical power from coal and natural gas plants that are operating at less than 50% efficiency. Then you're looking at transmission and charging losses as well. 

I'm sure that someone somewhere has done a comprehensive analysis (and it's still almost certainly better to use the electric car), but you're oversimplifying the situation and presenting a very inaccurate view to the layman."
It's more the heat I'm concerned about. 
I have a hunch that it being in the top left of that huge landscape screen puts the speed in a more comfortable position than the actual centre of the dashboard in other cars. Having the screen in landscape helps bring that top corner closer to the driver. 
ahh
"Honestly, I don't hate electric cars. The day I'll buy an electric car is the day when it has the same range and same weight as a similarly sized ICE car. I do think 100% ethanol cars have a future though. I love E85."

I think you need to take into consideration that the build quality increases with every car. So a general statement like the build quality is awful and the car won't do it 12 years are not really appropriate.  Especially considering that you can not know the second part because 12 years haven'passed yet since production start of the Model S .
"Yeah that's what I thought, also the aluminum construction is rustproof and durable"
"Yeah the car is seriously good-looking. I actually like it a lot more than the S and it's competitive if not better compared to BMW/mercedes, which is a pretty good-looking car in my opinion. Really dig the silver and normal-looking wheels options. But alas, I want to retire early and my civic has at least 150k more miles left on it."
"Thanks!  Camera was all over the place, but there were definitely some good tidbits in there.  I still didn't get to see much of the rear of the vehicle and hatch, which was what I was hoping for, but that included more looks at it and even some extra info about the 3 I hadn't heard earlier.  Appreciate it!"

That seems a little crappy actually. The driver should be able to easily view their speed and various gauges without directing their vision too far from the road. A central HUD seems to require just that.

"The rebates aren't THAT substantial. And if you don't do that many miles per year, then whilst the free electricity is very nice, it doesn't add much to the overall cost per month. 

A Model III will probably run to about £450/£500 per month here - you can lease a Leaf for £200. Don't get me wrong, the Model III will be a better car in virtually every way - but my point is that the Model III is still a way off being the 'everyman' electric car unfortunately. "
Rebates won't last forever though.

It is legally required to be a dedicated gauge cluster. Speedometers are not optional. It can do other things as well but must show the dashboard gauges at all times.
"Oh yeah, I just meant they're all in the center which I really dislike instead of the typical driver's dashboard and then a center for not really essential things. I really don't see why that was even implemented in the first place. "

"Well I don't really have a problem with the screen itself or its positioning (a Tesla employee on Periscope said that it's actually a 15"" screen rotated, so in fact it's smaller than the Model S screen), my problem would only be with the instrument cluster being in the center, especially on a screen even smaller than the S's. I remember my friend had a Mini Cooper and that has the speedometer in the center and it didn't bother me at all when I drove it, but that's a fully separate gauge above everything else in the center, not part of the same interface where you also have A/C, radio, and other controls as well. I think it's going to be way too cramped fitting everything on that screen, and unlike I've seen a few others say, I do like to frequently look at my speedometer to see my speed, especially in a car like that where I'll likely be going faster than I realize fairly frequently :P"
"Agreed on the console/dash.  I'm going to reserve judgement until I see more pictures, but I'm just not sold on it yet.  Definitely one of my sticking points at the moment.

That said, it should be noted that the screen in the 3 is **smaller** than the one in the S.  The 3's screen is 15"" (versus 17"" S screen).  However, the 3's screen is in landscape orientation, and it is mounted higher along the dash, so it does look larger."
"The screen on the S is larger (17"" vs 15""). It's just oriented in landscape in the 3, and portrait in the S."
I thought this was a 15 inch and the S has a 17?  The 3's screen is in landscape which makes 
"I don't think it's a cost-cutting measure, at least not exclusively. Elon mentioned in his speech that they squished the ""firewall"" and moved the front seats forward, so there may not be quite enough space up there for a dashboard."
"Yeah, that is a slight negative but for me not a huge deal. I'm still going to keep my CR-V around as long as it keeps running so for moving bigger items/cargo I won't be using the Model 3. I am conflicted though, because that seamless glass means rearview mirror visibility is probably way better than the S and it increases rear headroom, but it also makes that trunk opening smaller and will be more expensive to replace if necessary."
"Thanks, I wasn't aware of the Prius fact. Even with that in mind, I think it's safe to say that the average efficiency of all vehicles on the road is well under 30%, even in the US, not to mention globally.

Besides, I believe the vast majority of the heat is released through the radiator. Anyway, my point is that the grill as a part of the design of a car is sort of engraved in our collective image of what a car should look like. That's why the Model S has a grill imitation, so people wouldn't think it's weird.

Now that Tesla has very strong brand recognition and a massive following, they're finally ditching the ""symbol of thermal inefficiency"" for a brave, clean design, as seen on the Model X and 3.  
I'm willing to bet we will see a Model S redesign in the following year featuring a similar front."

I was shocked when I played with the numbers trying to find a worst case scenario. EVs are vastly more efficient as a whole than we appreciate. 

Don't forget the entire process of extracting oil, shipping it, refining it, shipping it again to a gas station as a finished product, and THEN you burning it.

The process for nat gas and coal is more efficient on the extraction and refining side of the equation, which adds to the lifetime efficiency of the process."

"I too am in the ""retire early"" camp (plug for /r/financialindependence) but I've incorporated a Model S into my plans :) (decided I'd rather have a used S than a new 3)."
The model 3 is 35k not 100. I agree that the aftermarket is huge but compared to average people that want a standard car it's nothing. Honestly what proportion of people who buy a car these days spend any more than 20k on mods? Because that's what you're looking at the very minimum for a completely unique set of carbon fibre body panels.
This one looks SP modern. It puts the Bolt to shame. 
"Now see that to me is oddly proportioned. I'll try and explain why.

The roof - instead of being a single continuous sleek curve, is a mixture of curves. Secondly, the centre line crossing the door handles also 'droops' down towards the rear of the car, rather than appearing straight. Thirdly, the nose doesn't contour around the front wheel, but instead awkwardly 'box-shapes' its way around at a slant relative to the bonnet.

Thanks anyway for looking that up."
That looks boring and boxy imo.

There's a difference between central speedo and a glaring screen though. A huge difference.
Wholeheartedly agree with this. 
I don't think speed is what folks are worried about. It's basically like checking your phone. If you have to keep looking at center console for basic read outs.
"Ridiculous. It wouldn't matter if driverless cars were the norm tomorrow or a hundred years from now, this isn't one."
"Well the mini cooper has the main speedo and instrument cluster in the middle of the dash at about the same position (but they also have  a tach and i think the odo are in the ""normal"" spot).

And in my wife's old saturn ion the whole cluster was about at the same height as the screen in is the model 3, [just further back](http://images.hgmsites.net/med/2005-saturn-ion-ion-3-quad-coupe-auto-dashboard_100259117_m.jpg)"
"Hang on a second, the price of the leaf you quoted is **after** the government grant of £5,000. The true price is £22,000. The suspected £30,000 price of the Model 3 is before incentives, with the government grant it would, of course, be dropped to £25,000. I said the prices are similar, if you can afford £22k, you can probably afford £25k as well, especially if you consider how much better the Model 3 seems to be, compared to the Leaf."
and this car has the autopilot safety features included even in the 35K base model so you should be fine...
"It's not great, but it might pick up a truck hurtling at you. But then so might the autopilot. "
"Fun fact: The display would have to be on your cars ceiling for your blind spot to actively ""fill in"" road data.

The blind spot that ""fills in"" data is a very small, and specific region of your visual field.

Peripheral vision is actually very good at detecting movement. In fact, the photoreceptors and processing of data from peripheral vision is specifically evolved to detect changes in motion - this cues a person/animal to shift their attention toward the area of movement.
"
"The mini is not a concept car. It has a gauge cluster that is [practically symmetrical](https://www.google.com/search?q=mini+cooper+dash&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgqae0te7LAhVJ12MKHecyDtkQ_AUIBygB&biw=1280&bih=887) with the exception of the tachometer in the American version and speedometer in the UK version. 

I don't know exactly why they did this so that's why I said I guessed they did it to save money in production because they would have to change less things around. 

I was guessing Tesla plans to do the same. "

And then more fuel to transport that refined product to a local gas station for someone to pump into their tank."

"This is a great point.  If you have both, why would you look towards the center dash.  There is no way that is more convenient.  I don't see a way to argue the central screen monitor speedometer as superior unless you are talking about cost savings."
Yes actually yes it is.  It will be outfitted with the requisite hardware such that it will be driverless via software updates.
"To my eyes, the positioning of the Saturn cluster looks a lot more comfortable than the way it's set up in the Tesla. Could be the recessing. Crazy about the mini, though--I just googled pictures of the instrument cluster, and it looks to be placed similarly to the Tesla. It looks terribly uncomfortable and I really hope Tesla changes this. Even a small shift would go a long way."
"Lol your math is just as bad as his, you just skewed it the other way"
But we are taking a few milliseconds here. You don't stare at a speedo. The difference is moot. The time it takes for your brain to process and respond is far greater than that.

"I was in a similar situation as you when I graduated college last year.

I guess by better I meant more practical. Do you have an emergency fund with 3 months salary saved up? Have you gotten your current car thoroughly inspected (what if it needs $2k+ repairs within the next year)? Do you have your monthly expenses budgeted (I know I didn't for the entire last year, not including rent there are some pay periods where I spend almost $1k)? A $35k (minimum) brand new car is still a brand new car (which means it depreciates like crazy and as far as equity goes is a terrible investment). But it's your life, I'm just some stranger on the internet, you can do whatever you want. I'd just ask your parents (assuming they're fiscally responsible) what they think. My parents didn't own a brand new car until this year, and they're 50 & 55, and it's a Ford focus, which is pretty practical."

Although I will give you this, to call it radiant cooling is misleading, negligible heat is being transferred via radiation, heat transfer is still taking place via conduction."

"From your own source:

So they didn't really innovate such a large screen working in a car. It just already did.

> Tesla also started working hand in hand with the Asian manufacturers to perfect their then-immature capacitive-touch technology and to find ways to hide the wiring behind the screen that made the touch technology possible.

This may be true, but the iPhone had been released in 2007 (and in development since 2004), using a capacitive screen just fine. And the technology scales relatively easily (though I'm not sure about scaling cost-wise)."

"Yes, the latter. With the wrap I got it is actual clear satin on top of my factory grey. It's actually a little thicker than automotive vinyl, which is what the blackout material on the chrome is. Minor scuffs just wash off, it doesn't pickup fingerprints, does fine with organic debris (aka bird crap), and no worries of scratching it while washing. In fact, I found someone or something had caused a little pull in the material; I applied a hair dryer for 10 sec and it was back to normal."
"Burn the rest for humanity, keep this one."
But why are the doorhandles on the satin black one different from the others? This is bugging me
Helllll yea
I really hope that those pop out handles can be an upgrade.

I'd say it's not the final car. Much like the first Model X they showed us had cameras for side mirrors and a host of other things that were either changed or removed entirely.

While there are a few sticking points with the design for me, I think all things considered I liked what I saw and heard.  Now if they can meet the challenge of completing development and delivery according to their stated timeline, the 3 should do very well."

"In the following video by Jalopnik the man driving the Model 3 said that they fully intend to bring the interior to production. They don't want a traditional set of instruments in front of the driver apparently. In the video he mentions that the speed is in the upper lefthand corner of the screen just within the peripheral vision of the driver.

Idk, I am not a big fan of the straight steering wheel at all but with something so modern I am not sure if a more traditional wheel would look good here. I hope they change that a bit as it is just so.....bleh. And people though the Model S was minimal."
...ew?
You know it my friend. Who need's sleep anyway. 4 hours is what I got.

What Lexus are you buying for 26k?
Keep in mind that you may not get the taxincentive. It is capped at 200k cars per manufacturer(I believe) so unless they change that policy all the cars that will get the incentives are already reserved.
That is super reasonable. Too bad there are no chargers relatively close to where I live and I have a long commute.
I saw.
That's highly unlikely.

"No, and even if you could somehow scrap up enough money to get approved for a loan, you shouldn't do it. At your age there are far, far better things to do with $35k."
"Base is 35k. So you'd need to take a loan out and likely pay it off in less than a decade, with insurance. If you're making what most 17 year olds do in a part time job, you'll likely not be able to afford it right now."
"If you're going to save a lot of money for something at 17, save up for a plane ticket to somewhere in the world you've never been. Cheaper and guaranteed you'll get more out of it than a cool car would give you. "

"I own a leaf and it looks horrendous. The white ones look like a clown face. I randomly put rudolf noses on my friends white leaf to remind him. we hate our cars... But $100 a month lease with no gas payments is awesome

Edit: removed weird italics and clarified that it looks horrendous. The car is actually quite good"
"I'm pretty sure those style headlights help the aerodynamics around the mirrors.  Kind of agree, not my favorite, but overall the car looks quite good."
"Also, there's a good chance this isn't final since this is just the prototype. I'm pretty sure the S changed between reveal and final production release. "

"
Those headlights remind me more of the Roadster than Leaf. I like them.
"Friend of mine send me pictures from the event, the headlights are LED and they're really cool looking. This car is going to have a very distinct design you'll be able to catch from a long distance, just like a Model S is easy to pick out. I love it."
"Is this what you're referring to - the way the headlights create a 'bump'? See my post, where I photoshopped them to how you might have wanted them to look: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4e5a0n/m3_nose_job_do_you_prefer_a_or_b/"

Stop staring. You'll go blind. 
I actually wondered if they did just plastidip it. 
I wonder if the Aero Rims make up for the range penalty the low profiles would give. 
"Unless you were a very early reservation, I highly doubt you'll get the federal tax credit, since over 100k cars already got reserved in the past 24 hours alone, which puts Tesla far far past halfway to the 200k limit for the federal tax credit. You *might* get a smaller credit though as it phases out over time after they pass 200k cars sold."
"In the USA you get $7,500 off your tax if you buy one of the first 200k teslas, then in your state you may get one as well ($2,500 in California).

If you didn't preorder the Model 3 you will probably not get one of the first 200k cars, and those who did saved at least $7,500. Unfortunately for me, that jumps it from the higher end of my price range to ""I need a new job""."
"Given that production starts at the end on 2017, at this stage these details are almost certainly design experiments. Having different door handles will only increase the cost of production unnecessarily. "

"Yeah, both time they showed a car for the first time it ended up having noticeable changes. So the 3 is probably going to change a little bit. "
Of course
No. If you watch the video Bjorn posted on his Facebook.  The hockey stick handles are mechanical handles. U push in the back part (bottom end of the hockey stick) and the door opens I think.

I'm sure he'll find something...
Turning off the headlights doesn't turn off the rear lights.
"If you've ever been to /r/AdviceAnimals, you would know that if your lights are not on at all times, you're a monster and deserve death."
"I'm still not 100% sold on the dash, to be honest. But I'll need to see more pictures to be sure. "
"Yeah, now that a lot of people have pointed this out in other comments, I'm reconsidering. 

The glossy black looks pretty damn nice too, though. So maybe that one instead? 

I mean there's still a good two years to decide."
Definitely not. There would be so many blown tires in the first month.
"IMHO, this is the next step to fully autonomous driving. Who needs a dashboard when the car is driving itself?"

"$1000/mo and your payment will be around $300, assuming November/December 2017 delivery. I set up my automatic savings plan today. :)"
"Honestly at this point in the dev stage, it probably makes much more sense to lease a Model 3 (or any all electric new to market) instead of buying. Do you really know you want to own one of these longer than 2 or 3 years out? 

At any rate, the all matte 3 is absolutely ridiculously compelling. Hilariously, I'm in a toss up for my next vehicle which I want to either be a Jeep Wrangler or a Model 3. The two could not be more opposite each other. 

I've bought new cars before, as I generally prefer to drive my cars for many years, but this could very well be the first *lease* I sign..."
One day :D

How did you get your flair to display the 3 like that? 
"Where are you leasing a leaf for $100 a month?!? After reading your comment I immeaditally googled leaf lease, and all I can find is $199/mo with ~$2500 down/ 36 mo 12000mi/yr... Not that that's bad, but if they were actually $100/mo I would be visiting the Nissan dealership today..."
"I hope you mean you hate the design because I own one and love driving it, but am not a fan of the design."
😂 love the username!
"Yep, that's exactly why the Leaf has them. ~~Just sucks because everyone I know *hates* how the Leaf looks specifically because of the headlights, so I'm not sure how well this will go over with them :/ I'll try and make this the first pic they see :P~~

Edit: Looked at a pic of a Leaf again and changed my opinion. Didn't remember how extreme the Leaf's headlights are."
It's kind of for aero. Technically its for wind noise. It redirects it around the cabin. 
"I'd be curious to know where they are in the design phase. If they're rolling it out late 2017, they'll need to finalize designs soon to get the tooling created for all the manufacturing given that they are aiming at selling much higher volume than previous iterations. "
"I'm pretty certain that their 115,000± reservation figure includes their international sales, so we might not be AS close to the 200k as we think. But I'd just hang tight until our numbered reservation comes out since the $1000 is fully refundable, if the tax credit was the main factor in placing the reservation. "
"I was in the first 100 reservations at my store this morning. I paid around 10:40am Pacific in California.  
  
**Open question for the community:** If you were to factor in sales from 1. Employees, 2. Tesla Owners, 3. Model S and X purchases, do you still think I'll make the first 200k and get the tax credit?"
[deleted]
"Depends on how fast they make them. Prolly won't hit 200k until model 3 deliveries start... And the phase out is based on time, not quantities from there starting the second quarter after the 200k is reached, 50% for the next two quarters. So basically, depends on how fast Tesla can ramp up production"
"I read on their site $7,500 in federal tax credits another 2,500 if I live in Arizona. "
How many of the 130k+ actually end up purchasing though? Most likely we'll see a six to eight month delay. I bet 30%-40% drop out for one reason or another. 
I ordered as soon as it came online and I'm Midwest so hopefully I'll be one of the first 200k
Agreed. Remember the[ Model X-Alpha](http://blog.ebayimg.com/motors/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tesla_model_x_prototype_5-533x400.jpg)
"This is a valid point and makes me slightly sad because I really wanted it to have self-presenting door handles and thought this confirmed it, but nothing is set in stone.  I have thought for a while that's something they could drop to save cost, but maybe it helps enough with drag coefficient that they can't justify it?  Please, Elon? >.>"
"And a bitch to maintain. I've got a friend who works sales in automotive paint and he regularly talks down the matte finishes to body shops because of their short lifespans. They can't be waxed and generally hold gunk more readily so they get crappy looking pretty quickly. 

It does look cool though, I've got to admit. But I keep cars for generally a decade or more, so I'd never buy a matte finish car."
I'm sure they'll work out those issues before launch. 
That's why we can't have ICE things?

Always 
"It should, until you press the brakes"
Headlights and tail lights are synced. It's the DRLs that are the problem. 
"Its such a shame because it looks so awesome.  There use to be a matte grey S-class that i walked past on my way to work and it looked great except for the spot on the hood where some bird shit on it like 9 months ago, its just not the same.  I think it was a while before the guy got it cleaned and it never looked the same."
"Having had a black car in the past, in Florida, if you're in a warmer area, consider how much heat it will absorb, and how that might affect your cooling. Maybe these days insulation and such are better, but I won't ever buy a black car again, no matter how nice they look. It's amazing how just a dark color, like a blue, is so much cooler."
But it's not. So I want my instrument cluster. 
"They could do a projected HUD for important driver info.

"Super late on this, but I'm in the same boat... Almost pulled the trigger on the sarge green unlimited wrangler, then realized $45k wasn't practical for the features I would miss out on at the price point."
It's just a weird character that isn't on your keyboard. Easiest is to just copy and paste it
"In California. One of the dealerships was running a deal through the Leaf enthusiast user forums. I couldn't pass it up. 
It was either $99 a month with 2 year lease or $199 for three years, but you also got the $3500 back from the state. Almost pulled the trigger on the $199 cause it's a great deal due to the rebate, but I wanted a shorter test for an electric car with my first go around. 
Only thing I don't like is the 100 mile range. It's my primary vehicle so it makes things tricky. "
Maybe he's talking about the 100/mo battery replacement program? I'm also curious because hell yeah I would trade my car for $100/mo with no gas
Yes the design. My bad. 
"I think they got much closer to the Aston end of the spectrum than leaf, which is quite a good place to be."
"To me, they look nothing like the Leaf's?."
"I'd guess between PDR and CDR; closer to CDR.  They're working long lead items (Gigafactory for batteries; Fremont production line startup) and taking advantage of similarity with Model S/X right now to mitigate risk.  They do not seem to be at a point where they're ready for a PRR (that's Production Readiness Review) but frankly there's plenty of time, given the annual production throughput they're going to be capable of and the amount of time before ""late next year.""  They're likely doing some early PODs (Proof of Design); the three cars you saw on stage and folks got to ride in last night among them."
Videos posted from people that test drove it had the tesla employee saying the car was pretty much finalized
"Full tax credit isn't a *huge* factor, obviously it'd be nice to get the full thing but if not then that's ok. I still get a 6k tax break here in CO on top of whatever federal tax break I get :)"
"Also, does the Tax credit include when the car will be sold. According to the update on their website the car will start shipping on the west coast and move eastward."
"It's not only the first 200k, that is just when the timer starts.  So if they time the 200k car sold in the USA at the very beginning of a quarter, Tesla will get a little under 6 months to sell as many as they can for the full credit."
"Well, considering that the figures are worldwide, then I think, yes, you should be good."
"That's what I've been wondering as well, though I haven't placed a reservation. I'm now resigned to definitely not get the full federal tax credit, although at least I live in CO where I would get a $6k state-level tax credit! And hopefully still a smaller portion of the federal during its phase out period."
WestCoast instore will be number 4 in your list so
"It is more complicated, will you order maxed out car with all the options?  The more options the better your position in the delivery line. Are you on east coast or west? The West coast will get them sooner."
[deleted]
I think someone else around here said if you make 57.5k or more you'll get full advantage. Just look at your taxes from last year and if you paid more than 7500 in federal taxes then you will get full advantage of the tax credit.
"I'm not sure I Follow your logic. Tesla has already sold...what, 50k electric vehicles so far? And let's say 150k preorders have been placed by now, or by the end of tonight. That's already 200k vehicles. Yes they won't have been *sold* yet, but you have to physically take delivery of the car before that second quarter after 200k have been officially sold, so once Tesla passes that 200k total tally including Model 3 preorders, everyone else is fairly shit out of luck. I mean not entirely cause you still get the phase out periods, but if you didn't place a reservation first thing this morning then I highly doubt you'll get the full federal tax credit."
"Right, but you only get the full 7500 federal credit *if* you take delivery of the car before they've already delivered/sold 200k cars in the US *total*, including Roadster, Model S, and Model X sales. Preordering now does not lock in the 7500 tax credit."
"The table is a little misleading, the $2500 is for CA, not AZ. AZ doesn't have any state-level tax credits as far as I'm aware."
"That's just speculation. It could happen that way, but preorders are still increasing, past 150k by this morning all ready, and imagine how many more preorders there will also be between now and the end of 2017? If you didn't preorder early yesterday morning, do not hedge your bets on getting a full federal credit."
"Given their design studies all had self presenting door handles, and even of different kinds, I think it's safe to say they're planning to include them. They were also I'm the video, and I think they help the aerodynamics. "
They could always go with the button that the X has.

Can you turn off the DLR's on Teslas?
Thankfully I'm up in NY. Doesn't really get that hot on long island. 
I just googled it and quoted the last part haha 
"if you really want to go level 11 on this, have 55K saved up, work 2 jobs if you have too and dont dick around for the year and a half.

you will not regret it, the money you save can buy a fully loaded model as well as solar panels, and you are set to drive on sunshine. 

sustainability is what its about and someone has to take the first steps, might as well be us."
"Ha. I actually just went to the bank this weekend. I decided I'm going to buy a stripped 2-door JK, manual trans, with literally the only options being a hard top and A/C. My plan is to get this Wrangler and keep it forever, and take good care of it. By the time it's paid off, The model 3 will be a couple generations in, and they'll have worked out any kinks and with the performance curve EVs are on right now, it'll be even better. So basically Wrangler now, and in about 3-4 years Tesla, but won't sell the JK. I'll have a classic that will just get better with age, and can then have the latest tech in a daily driver in a few years."
thanks!
I'd take that two year lease in a heartbeat. Thank for the reply. Congrats on the good deal!
"~~It's more the angle of them combined with the hood bump. [Specifically this angle](http://i.imgur.com/DvDTvVD.jpg). But it's just my personal opinion anyway :)~~

Edit: Looked at a pic of a Leaf again and changed my opinion. Didn't remember how extreme the Leaf's headlights are."
"It's over 20% of the cost of the car. It's a huge factor for some, like me"
"Can you cancel the reservation, if you do not qualify for the credit?"
Screw you guys. I'm going home. 
Good point. Finding out when the official timer/release is going to happen is going to be key.
"Yeah, that CO credit is still pretty great though. And I think that the 130K reservations will shrink because you could put the money up online and then back out later (because deciding to finance a car is a huge decision for most people!)  
  
So even if you're looking at 6K for state, and 3.25K for federal, that's about 10K.   
  
So you could realistically get the base car for under 30K  
or  
go up a few batteries and get a longer range vehicle.   
  
Should be interesting to see how it all plays out."
"I'm on the West Coast. I'm sure I won't max out my car, but I'm interested to see what the next step up is in battery / range. It might be worth it to put another 5K in if you get 240 Mile Range AND I'm moved into a different delivery range.  
  
I think there is a very real possibility that Tesla misses the ship date (knowing the history of the company) so it's just something I want to think about."
"When you get your reservation confirmation email, it has a number on it, but I don't think that's the final one. No one really knows how we'll be able to tell where we are in the line."
Joint? or Single? I'm curious because I'm graduating from college this semester and have a job lined up and last year I was just under that.
"I apologize if I get any facts wrong working from memory but I recall:
1) the 200k is cars delivered in us, so they are unlikely to reach before the model 3 deliveries start
2) the full credit stays in effect until the 2nd quarter after 200k is reached. So if they deliver the 200kth in December 2017, I believe that all deliveries until March 31 2018 would get the full credit.
3) the next 2 quarters would get 50% of the credit. So anyone talking delivery by sept 30 2018 would get half the credit. Then you would get 25% for one more quarter.

So how many model 3s can tesla deliver in the first year? That's how many get at least some tax credit "
"Interesting. How does Tesla do their financing? 
"
"Yes, but that would require actuators to open the doors, which are likely a $500+ part to get ones that are quick enough."
"Next car I buy I'm getting it wrapped, so worth the cost and it protects the paint from chipping and dirt"
"When you say ""never an issue"", is it literal? I'm assuming you mean the pains of maintenance are a non-consideration with a full wrap?"
They still don't look *anywhere* near as bumpy/awkward as the Leaf headlights.
"Oh I know, I was just saying for myself it isn't too huge of a factor."
"Yes, fully refundable."
"Having the full tax credit is a nice bonus, but getting less of that credit is enough for you to completely cancel your reservation? It's not that big a percentage of the car cost."
"Yeah, I've been hovering over the reservation page all day today haha. I know I might as well just do it since it's refundable, but it's obviously a big commitment even still.

For me the 215 range is already amazing, my commute is only 10 miles round trip, and if/when we move in a year or two it's only going to increase a little bit. And superchargers will be *doubled* by the time I receive the car so road trips shouldn't cause as much range anxiety with 215 range as they would with today's supercharger network."
"Tesla can afford to miss the ship date simply because there is no real compettion.  GM's Bolt was targeted at 30k in sales a year, Model 3 is looking at 300k this week.  Tesla was preparing to build 125k cars, they may not know how to build 300k yet."
Single. If you're married and joint income is 57k I don't think you'd get full advantage.
"Yes, that's all approximately correct. But you're only proving my point. Preorders are already past 130k (shown on the live counter at the event in a post here) and going incredibly fast. Maybe if you have just preordered you'll still get in on the full tax credit, but you do have to factor in Model S and X sales during that time too, as they should be selling more of those this year and next year than they have in previous years, and all those sales count toward the 200k total before any Model 3s are delivered at all."
[deleted]
"Honestly, I just looked at a picture of a Leaf again, and I feel like I should delete everything I said :P I didn't even realize how exaggerated the bulge is on the Leaf, I don't remember it being that extreme. I hereby stand corrected."
"So is there any chance people will be receiving their Model 3s, and they have no idea if it's above or below the 200k limit?

I just don't want to pay the other 34k not knowing if I will get the federal tax or not. It's a huge factor for a lot of people and I'm sure many are hinging their purchases based on if the 200k is reached or not when they get their Model 3."

"I thought it's based on how much federal taxes you pay per year. So a joint income would have to be higher, but as long as you pay more than $7500 in federal taxes you get the full return.

Could be wrong though, but that's what I read."
"I think the tax credit is based on delivery, not preorders. Someone here had some pretty convincing math that they sold not hit 200k US deliveries until model 3 hit the streets even with model S and X. If true, it all boils down to how many tesla can churn out in the first year. If they can do 300k, all the current preorders + 170k more will get something"

"Ugh, that brush.  I can't tell you the number of times I've tried to stop people at the local pay n spray from using that foamy, sandy brush.  No-one ever gives a shit though..."
"Haha right? I mean I've gotten used to how the Leaf looks when I pass them on the road but every time I look at the headlights I'm *still* like wtf, mate?"
"Correct, it is based on deliveries, as that is when the car is actually officially considered ""sold."" My point is that all these preorders will turn into deliveries. You don't magically get the full tax credit just because you *order* it before the tax credit starts phasing out, because when you order, that's the same as these preorders essentially. It doesn't count as a sale yet, so you're not locked into getting the tax credit until you take delivery of the vehicle."
