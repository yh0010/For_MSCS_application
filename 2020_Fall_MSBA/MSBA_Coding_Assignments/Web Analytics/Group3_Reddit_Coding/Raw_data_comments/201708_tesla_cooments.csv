The differential has oil.
"I'm currently at 165,000 miles. I change my oil at every 5k miles using synthetic oil. I have had on average 33 oil changes at $100 each for a total cost of $3300. Counting spark plugs modifications to increase gas mileage I'm guessing $10k which is still much cheaper than a Tesla. "
/r/hmmm
"If it costs me $0.23/kwh to charge a Tesla and can get 250m range from 75kwh of charge, doesn't that come out to 6.9c/mile? Even at a supercharging cost of $0.20/kwh, isn't that 6c/mile?

And if gas is $2.70/gallon and a Prius can get 50mpg, doesn't that cost 5.4c/mile?"

"Yes, there is lubricant.  But this is not a transmission.  The gears do not change automatically.  Just a 10:1 reduction gear.  Not a transmission."
This si funny but I guarantee someone comes in and asks for an oil change on their Tesla
Is this place shooting itself in the foot. They are literally saying that if you got a tesla you wouldnt need them anymore
A locomotive has what they call a wheel. Its a large ac or dc motor that has a gear reduction down to a straight axle. They use oil
If there is motors don't they still need motor oil cause of friction between motor to wheels gears?
The shopkeeper probably wants to see a Tesla as he might don't know about the negative charge in oil. It almost takes 6-7 hours to do so.
No one with a Tesla will be driving in that area.

Payments on your tesla
"There's no differential, there's a 1 speed gearbox attached to the motor which sits right between the wheels.

Differentials are what transfer power from the driveshaft (forward/backward) to the axle (sideways)."

What kind of oil are you using that cost $100 per change?
"One of the reasons for using synthetic oil is extended oil change intervals. Changing synthetic oil every $5k miles is like burning money. 
"
So what are you saying? 
How much are you paying for gas though? 
"Where do you live that your electricity is that much? The national average is half of that at $0.12/kwh. Let's take that and the Model 3's efficiency of 310 miles at 80kwh (we don't know the exact specs yet but that's probably a bit worse than reality), which is 3.1c/mile. But if you live where gas is way more economical than electricity, then the Prius might be a better choice in terms of operating costs. But it's also probably not nearly as fun to drive."
"That's true, although 50 mpg is not very common.

There are also many places that provide free charging (in my case, I'm lucky my work does). I can't think of an equivalent where one could get free gas."
"Math looks right, but $0.23/kWh is higher than most places. I'm ~$0.095 for the flat rate plan or $0.056 overnight on the time of use plan. I think superchargers in the mid-Atlantic region are about $0.12/kWh.


"
"The math depends on where you live, I guess, but your numbers are pretty weird. Your gas price is a bit higher than some of the numbers people pay in more expensive areas, but your electricity number is double the national average.

I pay 11¢ (slightly below the average of 12¢) per kWh. Given your numbers (I assume they are correct), I would pay roughly 3.3¢ per mile. With a Prius at 50mpg, and me seeing prices around $2.20 per gallon for gas where I live, the Prius would cost around 4.4¢ per mile. 

Of course a Prius is much less expensive than a Tesla, even when compared to the more economic upcoming Model 3 costs more than a base model Prius (that gets the same mileage as any other Prius.) You also don't have to buy a new Prius, a Prius that's only a few years old will run about $10k.

This is just taking the cost of Gas into account. I'm sure there are other factors that would play into the long term investment of either vehicle that differs heavily given the drastic differences between the two."
"2.70? That's expensive as hell, I literally saw it for 1.82 earlier today and 1.95 on the higher side. E85 was 1.42 but my car doesn't get as much MPG if I use that so it's better to just use regular unleaded"
"Thank you, As I Lay Dying, for teaching me what an adze is."
Your fact wasn't really that fun. Was more of just a regular old fact. 
Teslas don't use oil.
How ya doin bud.
"Tesla's don't get oil changes, it's a joke.

Like saying ""free hamburgers for all vegetarians""."
You know there are people who want to work on thier own vehicles or cant afford a tesla or want to be able install thousands upon thousands of watts of equipment or go offroad or.... Well theres alot of reasons shops will be fine and you cant just force standards like that.
Look up transmission in the dictionary or Wikipedia. This is a transmission. 
"Ok?.... it still doesn't need engine oil after it's made. A regular car need all that to be made. But oil and petroleum are different. Those are all petroleum products, which include gasoline. The oil in reference is refined oil for lubrication. People always think that oil=oil=oil. There's differences "
That's the joke...

One moving part though? Can't be too much oil 
Would you want 500+ HP going through a gearbox which is bone dry?  The gears would tear themselves apart without lubrication.
Moving parts need lube
Why wouldnt it?

Is this a joke?
How come?
"That link clearly says, Drive Unit(s) fluid service: Year 1 or 12,500 miles....."
Your Nissan Leaf gearbox handles significantly less power than a Tesla's :-)
"Leafs have a reduction gearbox just like a Tesla and that will require servicing.  You should always check on the status of the trans fluids, they can go bad pretty quick in stop-start city environments."
"[You're supposed to inspect the reduction gear oil every year](http://mynissanleaf.ru/docs/service-maintenance-guide-leaf-2013.pdf) (along with your tire rotation, brake fluid inspection/replacement, and other inspections). It doesn't look like it needs replacement during the maintenance schedule though."
What do you think lubricates the gears? 
"It most definitely does need oil. The trans would overheat and seize without it. 

But since the gearing is very simplified on a Tesla, the service intervals are pretty long."
Not sure if serious..
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

Don't have one yet. But I know MD will screw up like that
"I don't have my Model 3 yet, but MD is getting better with superchargers. There's two under construction for east-west trips (Cumberland, thanks to the deal with Sheetz, and Graysonville, just east of Kent Island), two under construction on I-95 north of  Baltimore.

And with Halethorpe (just south of Baltimore), Gaithersburg and Beltsville all getting ones soon, MD is looking pretty good. I bet in two years Towson, Frederick, and Cambridge will have them too.

I still can't decide between the 220-mile Model 3 or 310 one. When Cumberland is in place, that means I'll be able to do Deep Creek Lake (and back to the supercharger) with the 220 one."
I use the Laurel SC occasionally and find it's pretty popular due to being in the town center near a bunch of restaurants. Most of my charging is free thanks to MARC stations having chargers available so I can come back from DC to a full charge.
"It's Maryland, they'll find a way to screw up something good. "

So I wonder if they'd actually live up to their advertisement and attempt to change the drive unit oil or not. You should ask them. 
I laughed when I drove by there too.
Another Tesla owner already texted me. He was up there and thought it was mean.
Had another owner text me who was up there.
"You're mistaking the [differential](https://youtu.be/yYAw79386WI) for transmission, teslas are 4 wheel drive having a motor at the front and another at the back each powering the respective wheels, if teslas had 4 motors, 1 for each wheel, or had two motor powering only the front or rear wheels, no differential would be needed, but since each motor powers either front or rear wheels, teslas have not just one, but two differentials."
"It isn't a diesel if he's paying for spark plugs...

Although it could be and they just REALLY like spark plugs."
">> I have had on average 33 oil changes at $100 each for a total cost of $3300.

>Holy shit man that's too much for and oil change unless it's a diesel truck.

There are different grades of oil and some are more expensive than others. Additionally, not all engines require the same volume of oil, just so you know. I had an RS4 which took 9.5 quarts of 0W40. Back in '08 before Walmart carried it, oil alone was $90 + $20 for the filter. That's $110 just for materials. "
Must be nice huh. 
"Spark plugs are iridium and require 16. Mods are cold air intake, chip and other mods. Oil change is royal purple and is the best oil I've found as it adds HP. "
Nah cabdrivers are buying them (netherlands) cause theyre so much cheaper to run.
">My dude no one buys a Tesla to just save money, they buy them because they look cool as fuck and are really fast.

Unless you buy a P85D or higher, there are MUCH cheaper ways to go significantly faster. Hell, even $50k can get you into the 9's while retaining all the comforts you expect in a modern car, but that's not why we like Tesla.... "
True. 
"Legally, oil only needs to be 30% synthetic to be able to be labeled as ""full synthetic"" where I'm from, so, no, you need to chance it a lot more frequently than that, especially if you have an older car. "
"I just recently found a high mileage synthetic oil filter so I should be able to get to 8-10k miles per oil change. Also, each quart of oil is $10 my truck takes 7 quarts. Oil plus filter ($15) plus oil dump charge and tax is about a bill. It's ridiculous but necessary.  "
I had an Audi RS4 which takes 9.5 quarts of 0W40 full synthetic. Back in '08 before Walmart carried Mobil 1 0W40 it cost me $110 just for the oil and the filter. 
Royal purple. 
My A8 takes ~8.5 quarts of synthetic. Changes would be at least $80 if I couldn't go to the dealer.
$5k miles are very expensive.
Gas guzzlers are still cheaper than a Tesla...for now. 
Costco has premium at $2.35
"I pay anywhere from 2.65 -2.35/gal. 

Edited. Ahhh now I get what you meant. Yes I have paid about $28k for gas so far. "
"NY, CT, MA all have electric prices around $.23 / kWh. CA can too, though depends on many things. I know 12 is the national average, but tons of people live in places where it's 2x the average and it really changes the math on EVs (especially since gas is so cheap). My Volt is about the same cost per mile on gas or electric right now, but luckily I can charge at work for free. "
"It's not really reasonable to talk about the pricing of the Model 3 considering the limitations around availability. I've only seen one in the wild, but they aren't *generally* available.

The bottom tier here in palo alto is ~$0.12. I know that in Berkeley, it quickly goes up to $0.33 with even moderate usage (tiered system from PG&E)."
"SDG&E's super saver electricity, between 12AM and 5AM is $0.19/wh.  Electricity during peak hours is twice that. "
I live in southern CA and I pay $0.20/kWh. 
"I don't own either, but I do believe 50 is pretty common for commute driving in a Prius."
"Around Palo Alto, that is the new rate for public chargers (libraries, city hall, etc). And as I said: superchargers at still $0.20/kwh, although that is effectively derated by some amount with the yearly credits. But not much."
"$0.23 is what it costs at all public chargers around Palo Alto now. I think much of the Blink network is $0.59 or $0.69 per kwh.

And in Berkeley, the top usage tier is $0.33/kwh. I do not know what the fee structure for bulk purchasing is.

My point is that the cost of electric driving is now *at best* on par with the cost of gasoline driving. I mean, I literally fantasize about getting a Tesla, but it seems like everything has been intentionally priced to only be equal to gas driving."
Not having to drive a garbage car is worth at least 3 cents a mile.
[The majority of the country has gas over $2.00 right now with a lot of places over $2.50](http://www.gasbuddy.com/GasPriceMap)
Where do you live with 1.95 on the high side? 
"If you think that's expensive, I invite you over to the Netherlands; over here it costs USD 1.91 per litre, that's a whopping USD 7.21 per gallon.... Electricity on average sits around USD 0.20-0.25 / kWh, so driving an EV here is really beneficial

*prices converted with EUR 1 = USD 1.18*"
Your fuel mileage drops by 25% using ethanol? Looked it up as I was typing this and it looks like that would be true by the energy density of those two fuels!

"Yes they do, just not as much and don't need it replaced as regularly as ICE cars.

Tesla recommends the drive unit fluid need to be replaced after the first year, or 12,500 miles, then again after 5 years or 50,000 miles. There's also transmission fluid and differential fluid, but these probably wont need changing before 100,000 miles, there's no recommended maintenance period for these."

"They have a transmission, but it's just a single-speed reduction transmission.  It also has a differential, which needs oil as well.

[You can see the gearcase in this picture](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w6qlJ5yoPkA/maxresdefault.jpg).  Large cylindrical bits are the electric motors, geartrain and differential is in the cast aluminium bit between them."
they have 1 gear
"A multi-speed transmission could be designed for their electric motors, but it was found to be useless in the early days of electric cars. Electric motors have more linear rpm and torque graphs, so there's just no need for a multi-speed transmission."
Whats the oil change interval? 75k?
But do they have to be re-lubricated? I can't imagine it would be easy to get oil into the gearbox.
"Didn't think of that, LOL."
"Hold my tranny, I'm going in dry!"
"Thanks for that clarification.

Nope. Gears need oil. 
"Nope, Oil is a lubricant. You gotta lubricate gears. You probably haven't heard it much because even the eldest Teslas aren't that old even though the few roadsters out there are several years old. Also they do that as part of a general service. Just like how with any other car you can take it in to a dealership and they'll do more than just oil like fluid top-offs, cleaning, etc. "
[deleted]
"Tesla oil becomes negatively charged over time due to the polarising effect the rotation of the electric motor has on the oil, so since it becomes negatively charged I just made all this up and none of it is true whatsoever."
As far as I know you can't do that when the car is assembled like with ICE cars. The oil just doesn't usually need changing so they didn't made it simple.
"It's only on the chart once @ 12,500 miles, I wonder if it is it mainly to remove metal filaments that may come off the drive unit during initial wear?"

Smooth metal shavings.

Royal purple makes a decent product so by all means keep using them but if you think it's adding more than a theoretical amount of power then you're fooling yourself. You'll gain and lose more power day to day just from varying weather than you ever will from just using a better oil."
"And way more reliable, as well. Also, I think they get a crazy subsidy for buying electric."
"What is the price of electricity there? Depending on that and the really low maintenance cost, Tesla's the smarter choice if you can afford the up front cost.

I also heard something  else that seemed a little less believable, and that is if you need an immediate charge, you can take it into a Tesla shop and they'll replace your battery with a charged one (for a cost). "

"Maybe in very specific parts of America, but Tesla's aren't 'cheap' cars so that's kind of a non statement either way. Still cheaper to run."
So you came on the Tesla sub to say This? Lol
That's not quite what I meant.
"It's perfectly reasonable to discuss the efficiency of the 3 since that's the car that will have the most buyers of any of the Tesla lineup. It's also about as efficient as other EVs, although a little better, whereas the S and X are relatively inefficient due to their size. It isn't available now because it hasn't shipped to customers yet (save for the 30 employees who got theirs earlier), but will likely outsell the Bolt before the end of the year, making it more available than pretty much any other EV. I don't see how it's bad to compare against a car that is in production, it's not like we're comparing to a concept, and anyone seriously considering a new car in the next year or two would probably be able to get one.

But fine, let's compare the LEAF, which other than Teslas is the only car available everywhere in the US (the Bolt still isn't). For my 2015 it's rated at 84 miles at 24kWh, which is actually 21.5 kWh useable. That gives about 3.9m/kWh and at $0.12/kWh that's 3.1c/mile. At your rate of $0.23 (you don't have off peak times or anything?) that's 5.9c/mile. There's also no oil changes, which add 1.7c or so (assuming $50 and 3k miles) to whatever you figure for the Prius."

"I'd drive a Tesla there for an oil change, just to mess with them... but wouldn't actually want to get work done there"
Yeah but you'd think with all that low RPM torque that it'd be more efficient to have crazy high gears and leave the motors running at low RPM. But there doesn't seem to be a benefit to doing that with electric motors.
"It's actually grease not oil. Don't really remember the duration tho. Also the brake oil is there but it's not really oil, rather a fluid"
"Yeah. It's supposed to be changed after 12 months, then not until 4 years later."
Iirc Tesla said somewhere 12yrs or 150k miles.
"On most cars it's a simple drain plug. It usually has to be refilled with a hand pump. Not nearly as easy as an oil change, but certainly not something to lose sleep over."
You change oil in normal gearboxes too (sometimes)
"Even the space shuttle had oil filters.

Source: I read the friggen manual."
Post or pre op?
No Tesla block you from accessing them. 
There's [this](https://service.teslamotors.com/) but it seems to only be available in Massachusetts (and not cheap).
"Lol no that's a myth. There is a single ratio reduction gear. Otherwise the motor would spin at the same rate as tires, and your tires would either shred to pieces, or the car would get to 600mph lol."
I thought the same thing. After a quick Google search it turns out it has no transmission but still has a gearbox with one single gear.
[deleted]
Charged up is hilarious 
There's magnetic coupling but then you'd need cooling fluid
Does Wiseau need oil to run?
"Compared to engine oil? I'd agree with that, but it obviously still does need to have better lubrication properties than hydraulic fluid."
"Automatic transmission fluid, for automatics with torque converters, is pretty similar to hydraulic fluid...because the transmission is driven by the engine via hydraulic coupling (the torque converter).

Manual transmission fluid and gear oil are much more similar to engine oil than to hydraulic fluid, with some manual transmissions simply using engine oil.  (I had two Hondas that just took 5w30 for the transmission.)"
Unit attached motor that transfers power to a differential via gears = gearbox. 
"and if you put the reduction gears in a box that box would be called a gearbox.

I never said Tesla's have a multigear transmission."
Becuase a 1:1 with the engine would be nearly impossible due to rotational speed of the tires.  Also gear reduction = more torque.
"Yes, there is a gearbox in all Tesla's."
Teslas have a one speed fixed ratio gearbox.
"Yup. And looking at the upvotes, I'll need to share it around a bit. "
"Yes I think so too, I also believe you need to do it again on year 5 but can't really find much on that."

About 23 Euro cents per kWh according to a friend of me. That's about $0.27 per kWh."
Our current price per kWh is $.10 but that's from our local coop provider. If I remember correctly the Tesla sales rep said installing a home charger was about $8k. 
Came across the post in my feed and wondered if all my gas and vehicle maintenance and mods could justify spending the money on a Tesla and helping with the environment and after doing the calculations I realized it's cheaper to drive a 15mpg truck. Not hating just sharing research.

"AFAIK that's what Mercedes do with the AMG Electric Drive.  Chances are they have a clutch that links the two sides in the locking differential situation, but they do four-wheel torque vectoring with that setup.

I would suspect adding another motor controller/driver and the associated control systems would be more expensive than a differential.  And since you need the reduction anyway, a diff with a single geartrain probably wouldn't weigh much more than a pair of geartrains anyway.  Also, diffs are super reliable.

The other option is putting the electric motors inside the wheels, but that's not ideal for sports cars due to the increased unsprung weight.  It would probably be an option for little hatchbacks or whatever though."
"I don't know who taught you that higher gears are more efficient. It makes no sense that a higher power input would yield a completely disproportionate power output. Gas motors are an exception because they have a sweet spot between torque, friction, and heat."
"Its probably DOT3 like every other car, or DOT4"
"> brake oil 

That's a type of hydraulic fluid, not a lubricant.

Ninja edit: Though I suppose it might actually be an oil in certain cases.

Ninja edit 2: But not this one. [It's polyethylene glycol.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_4)"
Grease is not good for high rpm gearboxes / differentials. Also its a pain in the ass to work with... I highly doubt it has grease in it. Also Tesla actually refers to it as oil. I would imagine its standard gear oil just like any other differential. No reason to change what already works and lasts hundreds of thousands of miles.

Bobistheoilguy.com will give you way more info and discussion on the matter than you ever wanted but in general using a good oil and changing it before it's worn out/contaminated is good enough.

I have a Mazda6 which has historically gotten me 31mpg (I keep track of every pump visit). At ~$2.29/gal of gas and $0.12/kWh of electricity over 12k miles/year, I end up saving about $500/year. Not as drastic of a savings as Tesla states, but it adds up. Makes the Model 3 feasible.

Edit: I can't read since you put gas as the first thing. Should probably sleep... Leaving comment in case it adds anything to the discussion...  "
"If you really want just the best savings you should look into EVs that aren't Tesla's. I doubt you like the looks but just as an example you can lease a Soul EV with 15k in leash cash. You're getting quite a bit of features, and the $35k price drops to $20k.
You won't have performance worth a shit, but you'll have a super low priced EV that needs nothing but tire maintenance until 100k miles."

"There was a study done in Germany on some common VW model (Passat maybe?) where they basically installed ballast weights inside of wheels to simulate hub motors.

"With a gas engine it needs more fuel to turn fast because the engine components themselves have inertia and friction, so it's better to have it in a high gear at low RPMs if you're not accelerating. I'm guessing that an electric motor requires the same amount of energy to keep its rotational speed at high RPM as it does at a lower RPM simply because there aren't any parts moving forth and back.

Maybe I'm understanding it wrong though."

"They would need the battery design (as we still do today). Do you think a desire for electric cars could have motivated the research, design, and production of more effective batteries?"
"the inertia of the gears doesn't affect the continuous power transfer function because there is no energy gained or lost. 

Any inertia in a stopped electric system would continue turning the motor, which can cause a current backflow, then deceleration (note regenerative braking).

The power transfer function for an electric motor is constant at a much wider range of speeds since there's much less friction to slow it down. The speed of an electric motor doesn't need to maintain a small range of speeds, like gas motors do."

"Oil free vs oil reduction is definitely something worth understanding.

Over the lifetime of a vehicle, a car will use maybe 2,000-8,000 gallons of gasoline, which an EV can completely remove through solar/wind/hydro, or a more efficient use of natural gas.

Plastics mean we still pull the oil out of the ground, but it isn't combusted, so it's not really like plastics are contributing to global warming. The grease in the motor is the same really, but oil changes in ICE vehicles is the same as well, so no improvement there really, but that's a minimal portion of the oil that an ICE uses.

So yes, it's not oil free, but if the energy is sourced sustainably, it's >99% reduction in total lifetime oil used, and the oil that is used doesn't contribute to global warming.

So I get your point, but it's a lot like arguing that running 10 miles is the same as walking 100 feet because walking 100 feet still makes your legs go through the same motion.

I say let's take our improvements where we can get significant improvements and not try to stop progress when it isn't perfection.

Tesla will have to keep updating the car's OS and infotainment systems, but the processors are likely permanent. They'll either have to make a different version with less features, let the multimedia system slow down, or just pull an apple and drop support.

"I specifically said personally. I don't go out to dinner with all of my customers. I've met people who have had problems, but not a lot. I mostly do rebuilds, I don't typically fix broken ones. Also, there's a fuck ton of shit on cars other than engines and tires. "

You've clearly never worked on an older car then. You can get the starter out without removing anything but it's own bolts on almost every car I've worked on.

Taillights look a little red to me
"nice. what model do you have?  

I wrapped my matte black as well back in February. I used XPel - who did you use? are you happy with them?  I didn't change my badge to red. Nor did i change my wheels.  I may change my wheels just lazy to do so. I just did the wrap. I sincerely hope you enjoy it.  

I really enjoy the matte wrap on my tesla. it makes me **very very** happy.  I had another tesla before; but i upgraded and then did the wrap right away as i normally don't keep cars that long.  I think I may keep this one for a while.  Someone said cheers to being rich and ratchet at the same time.  **YEAH!** - cheers to that.  and now this:

*All black everything*

*Black cards, black cars*

*All black everything*"
Did you go for the base option if you knew you were going to wrap it? 
Yes
Nice ride!!
beautiful.... that satin finish..... I was going to do satin on my MX but went glossy at the last minute....
Holy shit! That looks nice af. I've got for years of work to do.

Looks great seriously!!!
I feel like I saw this car driving on 75/85 Thru downtown Atlanta today
That is a gorgeous car. Have fun! :)
Was trying to figure out why the front looked weird to me. I'll admit it was only on second look I realised there was no license plate.
Wow. That is one beautifully sleek vehicle. I would love to have one in that color!
The rims do bot match perfectly imo
This is freaking me out because all my eyes can interpret is a shiny grey car. This is some blue and black dress shit.

That little touch of red with the badge on the front is the hotness! My wife and I have seriously considered some steals products. Mostly the solar roof and the newModel 3. Enjoy it! 
the red logo looks awesome. great car OP
"I see a lot of Tesla's where people make the logo red or add a custom paint job in general, interesting trend. What made you want to do it and did you have to find anywhere special? Overall very nice!"

I'm not usually a matte or a black rim fan... but that is a fantastic looking Model S.  Congrats!

The red logos look great. How did they do those in red?

Did you also get your window tint done at the same place?"
"Looks great. Personally, I'd add on a spoiler (I like the Tsportline) and do a light tail light tint. "

Matte wraps look good new. After a few months they look like shit. Still a pretty car.
"All black? Or Brown?  Only tires look black to me, the car and wheels look brown in these photos."

Looking for this comment lol
"Now that you mention it, it is surprising that he hasn't wrapped his car. Maybe he's waiting for Dbrand to branch out."
Yessir!
Looks like it's wrapped in a dark gray condom.
You should get some black exhaust tips too....
I actually like how the lugs tie in with the brake rotors. 
Was wondering where those were..
I hear ya. To each their own my friend! 
">All black everything

>Red logo

I call shenanigans"
"I, for one, really like the red logo.  Though it is not generally the look I'd go for, I think it's sexy for someone else. "
Red and black hardly clash.
I bet it doesn't look so jarring in person. The colors are just really saturated.
I was about to say the red highlights are the sickest thing about the car. LOVE everything he's done to it. Basically the most badass Tesla I've seen.
I wouldn't say I hate the red but I would like to see a darker red in the same matte or satin finish.
Would be sick to get the Tesla logo in matted black too. 
Except it's fuckin rad
"You gotta have a focal point on your car to keep it interesting, give it some contrast so the black really pops. If absolutely everything was matte black it wouldn't look as good.

Maybe the red logo is a bit tacky, but you gotta have a stripe, how hook, something, anything."
Dislike the lights as well then?
Chrome spinners would complete the look!
"All yours, my friend"
Powder coated the stock silver ones. 
Thanks! Yeah the gold dust makes it shine a little more than traditional matte 
Good bot
5% 😁
They're on the way!
Thanks! We've seen each other quite a bit since then :) 
"To each their own, my friend! Nothing wrong with having a vehicle look the way you want it. Not much different than remodeling your house to your own specifications and desires. "
Some people customize their cars. Some don't. Not a big deal. 
Part of me thinks you are a hater.  
To each his own. Leaving the original chrome lettering on it would have thrown off the look of the car imo. Kinda nullifies the purpose of the chrome delete. White would have been an interesting choice though 
"It is satin, not matte. "
Disagree heartily
Red logos on cars always make me think of Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. 
A light tail light tint would be great. 
"I'm glad someone knew the song haha. They used 3M for the wrap I think..or maybe Avery. Pretty sure it was 3M. I wanted Xpel at first but was afraid it wouldn't have that slightly glossy but still satin look at the same time so I went with just the vinyl wrap. Definitely happy with how it turned out! Its a S 60 upgraded to an S 75. I plan on keeping this for a while...unless I decide to bite the bullet and go P100D. Drove a P90D the other day and was blown away! Now I have the itch. That damn unscratchable itch. 

What color is yours? Black also?"
"Basically yes lol. It was a New inventory vehicle so there wasn't any customization as it was anyway. S 60 software 
upgraded to 75"
"I researched and called different shops before making a decision. I based it on reviews, reputation, etc. the particular shop I got mine done at is contracted by Tesla to do their memorial/veteran themes wraps so that helped me decide. I already knew what color and finish I wanted and they had it available. Most shops can order anything they don't have. "
"""I'm in construction.""

""You hands don't don't feel like you're in construction...""

""I'm a union delegate."""
Hahaha. Could probably actually put some matte vinyl over it for the purpose of seeing how it looks  I'm pretty satisfied though. 
I'm sure someone good at photoshop can give it a go?
Where does he work? Wondering why he would need to be lifting Teslas
"Looks like it lifts like any other car.. by the lift / jack points:

http://teslaliving.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/screen-shot-2014-06-28-at-8-17-15-pm.jpg?w=193

I work at a shop with lots of random cars being serviced. We have a bunch of pucks, plates and adapters we use for different shaped rails/jack points. "
"Much easier cleaning and maintenance than painting the car in a matte/satin finish. Basically hand wash it every week or two, depending on your environmental conditions. That's what I was told from the shop who did it. "
Nothing special really. Just depends on how dark you're comfortable with getting and your local laws (if you care about those haha)
Both actually haha. I liked the actual style of the wheels and didn't want to change those 
From stock to that was about $6k
"These are the stock Tesla wheels my friend, just powder coated black"
Google Tesla Memorial Day and there's images of it. The shop that did mine got directly contracted from Tesla to do their military edition. Has for the past couple years. 
Haha nope. Wasn't me today. Maybe next time!
No sir. They actually wrap the door handles separately to give it the flush look. Functions like normal. 
Na I'm actually in the Bay Area
There are a few satin black Teslas in Del Mar I've seen as well. 
"Depends on your state. California is no tint at all. If it's a light tint, you probably won't get hassled but if it's dark, get that license and registration ready. "
Understandable. I guess a lot depends on where you're located. Personally I've only seen one or two wrapped ever. 
Completely stock. https://imgur.com/a/R0ZnG 
Haha let's track her down. I'm just her type 
"Somehow, it happens!"
Purchased 
"Have you ever seen one on the road? I always think ""man thats a sexy car"" before I even realize Im looking at a Tesla. I have never done that with a mazda "
Yeah all the chrome trim was wrapped individually 
"It's either would **HAVE** or would**'VE**, but never would **OF**. 

 See [Grammar Errors](http://www.grammarerrors.com/grammar/could-of-would-of-should-of/) for more information."
I'm a jiggalo
Nevermind - I see now from other replies you're in the Bay area. 
"When people wrap their vehicles, auto body shop will wrap logo in red. Doesn't come from Tesla  like that. "
Nice work! I took mine to a shop in Redwood City
"Thanks man! A lot of it comes down to working hard, prioritizing, setting goals and doing everything possible to accomplish them. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made but in the long run, it can be worth it. Budgeting and planning for accomplishing your goals is key. Each persons situation is different. I'm single right now and no kids so I don't have the same responsibilities as others. When I do get married/have a family, my priorities will of course change. "
"Yes got the tint done at the same place. They're actually the silver 19 inch wheels, just powder coated black. "
Definitely considering the tail light tint!
Good thing it's not matte then...
"No they don't. 

Source: mine is wrapped. "

It's the same reason most people can't have civil discussion with people who have differing political views, or religion, etc. all those button issues that set people off are tied into their identity. They are a Republican, or they are a Christian, or they are a Ford guy. It's who they identify as. 

All this to say, stop tying identity with ego and it becomes a lot easier to have conversations and think rationally. "
How much did it cost? Is it easy to maintain/clean?
Did they say what damage is caused on the stock paint job for the wrap?
Hahahaha you win!
"fuck, I went to go look at the picture to see what color they were now..."
he should wrap the brake rotors too ^^/s
I think it looks sick
ITT: people who think somehow black and red don't go together. I can't. 
"That dude is retarded. The little bit of red makes it pop, looks sick! Congrats!"
"Could you get a nighttime picture? How does it look in low light, because the red looks very bright here.

I like it, but I think I would've opted for blue instead of red."
Man I love the red logos
"You can always go black if you want, I'll let you borrow my crayons"
It's not black though
Hahahahahahaha please tell me you're that guy who wore a red tie with a black dress shirt!
Cool. You can put that on your car. 
Very polite!

"
Sure. Exactly why I made the comment with half me agreeing and the other half hating. 
They hate us 'cause they ain't us. 
"Well, I like the red logo.

Sidenote: are you going to call it Rudolf? "
The red logos look great. Chrome would have been awful. White would have been awful.  Lack and red is a classic combo. Most people here have no aesthetic for customized vehicles. 
"I'd do mine red if I could, just like you bro."
"Make tge logos gloss black. Or black chrome. Itll pop with the glossiness. And youdd really have it all black.

You could do black headlight housings too, but thats a lot more work.

I like the red, but gloss black would be SICK"
Do the red letters light up? I saw a similar looking tesla and I remember it having red LED lettering.
"Curious, did you see how the chrome logo looked with the wrap before you made it red?


One thing I've learned about dark cars is that's there is something that is the focal point. With a red logo that is the very first and maybe only thing people are going to notice, which is fine if that's what you want. This is just me, but if I had that car I would want to do something with the wheels to make them stand out as well."
"Tinting any vehicle lights is just asking for trouble.  Not to mention, if you're involved in an accident, it's going to be used against you."
yes mine is black on black w/ carbon fiber. this one is a p90d. i had a p85d black on black with matte wood but no matte exterior wrap; had it for 2 years.. loved it. i looked at the p100d; didn't think it was worth the cost difference between p90d and p100d. honestly i was ok with the p85d speed and offering.  now just impatiently waiting for autonomous driving. enjoy your ride man. regardles of battery - it's an amazing machine inside and out.  **rachet on! :)**
Smart :) and thanks for the reply!

Michigan is a bitch.  Up to 35% in rear windows. Nothing in front without a prescription.  Not sure how hard that is to do 
you actually made a tesla look nice
"Well hot damn, it's a fantastic look. :-)  I'm impressed."
Lol. No I get that. I've been doing vinyl graphics for like 15 years. But they are touch activated. This didn't mess up the capacitance touch sensor of the door handle?
Very nice brah.  Definitely looks way cooler!
Did they open the lights? How else would they get to the chrome parts inside the lights themselves? Do you have any close-ups of them?
Good bot
I believe it
That makes sense. Thanks for the info!
If it's not matte what is that called? 
I work at a car wash. I've seen the life cycle. Just wait.

"Much easier to maintain than getting a car painted a matte or satin color. I'll PM you some details 

Edit: price was around $6k"
None. It actually preserves and protects the paint underneath. 
Well in all fairness he should make the gas cap be black too.
"Dude, listen, dude, like, black, like windows! WHAT!! I know. Dude."
Me too.  Like Night Rider.
"There isn't really a color that black clashes with, so yeah… That is a weird statement. Then again, reading through these comments it appears there are some people that don't know that contrast is a thing."
It is though?
"That's not clash, that's contrast, whereas it's more acceptable in fashion to compliment."
That is a stupid comparison. 
Thanks!  It would look dope!
Anytime! 
Lol no. There's no tint on the windshield. Angle and background just make it look as such. 
"Hahaha when I do, you'll be the first to know!"
Aha. Here we have the pot calling the kettle black. You bummed on your success? My S is chill and a wrap is pretty cheap in comparison. You get bent real easy. 
Hahaha. Right now the car's name is Boss but Rudolph would be fitting 
"> Most people here have no aesthetic for customized vehicles.

And that makes them wrong!"
Lack and red. So good much colors   
"Black out the logos as well. The red doesn't work because there isn't any other red on the car besides the tail lights, it looks random and out of place. "
"I had the car for a couple weeks before I got it done so I saw how the chrome looked. Some people love chrome, some not so much. I'm in the latter category"
Plenty of new high end vehicles come with a very lightly tinted tail light. I'm not talking about making it a dark burgundy or black. 
[deleted]
"Great, thank you!"
"Yep, I can see how that would become tiresome. I assume shops will begin installing specialized lifts for EVs that can't be held by a standard lift in the coming years."
California is nuts. Technically we aren't supposed to have any tint on the front windows. 
Ohhhh sorry. No touch still works like it did prior. Nothing seems to have changed functionality-wise
I'll take some close ups soon. No clue if they opened the lights or not. Wasn't present for when they did that part.

"> price was around $6k

It would have cost you $3000-$3500 here in Atlanta.  "
Oh that's exactly what I was hoping. Would you mind if I pm you to ask how it is to upkeep in a month?
Has this been proven? What's the longest they've left a wrap on a car and removed it? I'm extremely skeptical of that claim.
it's actually blue and gold. 
"I gotcha, was going to call you insane hah. Looks great all around though. I've done tint on the windshield and it isn't the best move. Sure nice during the day but even with LED headlights has it's moments at night. "

Doesn’t this car have built in airbags to lower the suspension too?
"I can tell you that when I had 5% on the front windows I got pulled over multiple times. Went to 35% on the front after I got sick of the hassle and haven't been bothered! Good luck and find a CHP officer that will sign off without you removing the tint so you can just pay the fine and not have to rip off the beautiful tint every time. :-)

$6K
"Basically to go from completely stock to that was ~$6k. I'm sure prices will dif based on where you're located. I'm in the Bay Area. The shop has a good reputation and actually did the wraps for Tesla's Memorial Day vehicles 

Edit: shop is SS Customs in redwood city"
Then he would have had to be in Atlanta 
Gotta love the California sunshine tax! 
Even that’s stupid expensive. This is maybe $250 worth of material. Looks like I need to get into the wrapping business...
"Of course man, no problem at all"
"Sounds like you are getting plastidip and a 3M vinyl wrap confused. The wrap, with minimal proper upkeep (like washing your car) is rated for 7 years.

I would go so far as to say that if you purchase a car, new or used, that is worth north of 30k, and the paint is good, that paying a couple grand for a proper 3M wrap is very smart. Even if it's just clear. Your paint will look brand new 7 years later (or whenever you sell it). 

"
"There was an article from Car and Driver (? I think?) where they wrapped their senior editor's car and it was okay except the car was old original paint (80s paint) and did do some damage to the plastic painted parts. Mind you this was 5-7 years ago right when wrapping was getting big. So could have been the old car paint or the fact the vinyl tech wasn't great then. 

Searching for article will post. Please hold.

Thanks!!
But what's the cost? Jeez
I've seen your car on 880 a couple months ago I believe.  I had a feeling it was wrapped by SS. love their work. Driven the memorial day vehicles and had my car done by them as well. 
"Every time I go to the bay it is cloudy and I end up getting rained on. Still a great area, and I have a lot of fun up there, but we all know SoCal is BestCal ;)"

$5k
'bout $3.50.
I think it was 6 million dollars 
"They do make matte, yes. That all being said, there are lots of low quality wrap manufacturers and even lower quality cheap shops. So it is possible to get a bad product/install. If you are paying under 2000.00 for a color change (meaning a ""paint job""), you are getting ripped off either in product or workmanship/skill. 

And if your car is weird shaped with odd curves or edges or corners, etc (BMW i8, new Civic Type R, Lambo, etc) Expect a high cost.

Tesla would be a fairly low stress wrap job for an experienced person. 

"
Haha. I get pissy too. My comment was half pissy. My ex just took the S as I would rather buy more and more rentals so I can sit on a beach with $$ bills in my future. I'm not a car guy anyways.

I'm guessing charged at the top of the alps or something?
In my leaf I typically average 13.2kWh/100km although this goes up to 15kWh/100km at motorway speeds. To get down to around 10kWh/100km as these guys did requires very gentle driving and low speeds and no hills. Not terribly realistic sadly.

Question. How long does it take to charge to full?  If it's longer than 8 hours is that practical?
"Okay sorry can someone explain to me what this means? Does that mean if i buy a tesla, I can go 1000 km with just one full charged battery?"
How far is that in freedom units?   /s
Sure but the distance will be much shorter if they measure it using miles. 
Is that a GM?
"Let's call this the ""megameter milestone"".  It'll be cool once Mm on a single charge is standard."
"""The pneumatic suspension needs checking, please call support"""
I thought a TESLA had a 300km range. Has this increased?
Shame 90% of the population will never be able to afford it. Completely useless to the average family.

"Italian here: the start area was mostly with low elevation changes, but once you get to the area of san marino (the finish point)... may god have mercy on your batteries because the hills there won't."
"I can get over 50 miles per kilowatt hour on my electric bike without pedaling.  Depending what source you use, a gallon of gasoline has between 33 and 36 kilowatt hours.  Taking the low number, 50 miles multiplied by 33 is 1,650 miles per gallon equivalent. "
"No, it will never be more efficient to move a 4000lb car around than 30lb bicycle. Electric cars already have >90% efficient drive trains, there's not a lot of room for improvement on the efficiency side... Meaning even if there were zero losses, they wouldn't be much higher in that table than they are now. "

"Now if we could only get that energy density up as high as gas, then we can fly electric!"
That’s not how energy efficiency works. Even in a vacuum with a 99.99 efficient drivetrain you can’t move 4000 lbs of vehicle at an efficiency of 984mpge. It’s not physically possible. 
"OK, but when can we get in shape by driving a Tesla?"
"That's ridiculous.  Even if a vehicle was 100% efficient it would still need to weigh far less to overcome what a human could do.  They simply have too much mass.

It doesn't matter, though, until we are able to start photosynthesizing."
Well yeah but how efficiently are you getting the electricity in the first place?

Why is biking so efficient? Is it just because of the low speed? I can’t image our body is very aerodynamic.

"Too bad there was no comparison for folding scooter($20-60) and electric scooters($100-2,000)."

"You could use MPGe, which is miles per gasoline-gallon-equivalent, which is based on the amount of energy available in each gallon of gasoline.

So in this case 10 km / KWh converts to about  209 MPGe.

"
"Depends on which charger you use, if you use a supercharger it may take am hour to an hour and a half (please note that a supercharger slows down once you get to about 80% to protect the battery, 20-80 is well under an hour), at home using a wall charger you can get a full charge overnight. 

Most of the time you won't (and shouldn't) charge to full, though, as that can damage the battery, causing lower range. Most of the time people will only go as low as 20% (even lower if Tesla's navigation system decides you can make it to the next supercharger, I've seen planned routes get to a charger at 7%) and as high as 80 or 90%."
"Technically, yes."

"hmm, do you mean per charge? Quickly searching the internet yields many electric bikes and mopeds which get around 130 km per 33 kw charges. The Brutus V9 gets 280 on a single charge. Impressive, but not anywhere near 1583.59 km/gal or 984 mpg of a human powered bicycle. "
What bike do you use?
"Electric bikes and scooters are truly amazing for commuting. My 300w electric scooter can go 15 miles on a charge, battery is ~190 Wh. When I need to go farther than ~5 miles I'll take my electric bike with a 1000w BBSHD motor with a 60v 20 aH battery (this is overkill and too much capacity but I bought the bike used and this is what it came with.)"
 EVs spend 90% of the energy healing drag (air resistance) and road friction 
"I mostly agree. But I guarantee that if you figured out the total embodied energy in the average bicycle, and the average human diet, bicycles probably aren't *that* efficient.

Of course, bicycling-around helps keep people fit, so the efficiency side of things isn't as important. But my intuition says that 1000 human calories expended represents a whole lot more farming calories that aren't taken into account."
Electrical bicycles? :p
"You are correct if you get the electric power from a power plant. People have to eat food which has to be grown and harvested and transported and stored and cooked, etc. This requires a huge amount of energy.

An electric car with more efficient solar panels, someday, will get the potential energy straight from the sun and then directly convert it to kinetic energy. Meaning, you would waste more energy pedaling your bike then driving your car because humans don't run on photosynthesis, yet anyways. "
The link I provided says 700 mpg.

"I think that is why people like Elon Musk are also investing so heavily into solar. Efficiency, currently, is somewhat about saving the environment by lowering our dependency on fossil fuels, but that becomes irrelevant if you simply get the vehicles electricity from burning fossil fuels at a power plant. 

While electric vehicles may never achieve super human levels of efficiency, if energy from renewable resources becomes ubiquitous enough that it becomes essentially free, then efficiency no longer matters so much."
"It's not like gasoline has no energy costs associated with it's production. You need to mine the crude oil, transport it, refine it, then distribute the gasoline around. Nobody mentions that when they talk mpg figures.  
  
The whole process is hugely inefficient, gasoline just happens to have such high energy density it's still worth it. Overall it seems better to use the energy to directly power electric vehicles than to use finite resource like crude oil."
"This is actually a more relevant question than a lot of people want to admit.  Although I like to brag about it, the MPGe figures are nonsensical.  It is just how far you would go if you magically turned a gallon of gasoline into electricity.  

Here is how to get a more realistic number.  Let's assume coal powered electricity like a lot of electric vehicle critics like to do.  Coal plants in the U.S. average about 33% efficiency.  The U.S. grid system averages about 95% efficiency.  Then let's assume an 85% charging efficiency.  0.33 * 0.95 * 0.85 = 27% of the coal energy stored in the battery.  The equivalent to a gallon of gasoline that has 36 kilowatt hours would 0.27 * 36 = 9.7 kilowatt hours in the battery for 1 gallon of gasoline.  The Model S gets about 3.2 miles per kilowatt hour, so 3.2 * 9.7 = 31mpg.  My electric bike would get 485mpg by this calculation.

That is worst case scenario because of coal plant efficiency.  A combined cycle gas turbine plant can get over 60% efficiency and would raise the Model S efficiency to around 60mpg.  That's real mpg.  Combined cycle turbines are expected to use natural gas because it is cheaper, but they can also use liquid fuels like gasoline or diesel.  So if you took the gasoline that is used in cars and instead used it in a combined cycle gas turbine to charge electric vehicles, you would get considerably more miles out of that gasoline than you would by using it in ICE cars."
"Walking has no mechanical advantage. All your weight is on your feet at all times and the potential energy is quickly converted to kinetic energy and stopped by the ground. Once you stop moving you stop moving (for the most part). However, a bike has two main simple machines. The wheel and axle, and the gear, which is like a modified pulley. 

Wheels can convert a much higher percentage of potential energy into sideways kinetic energy than things without wheels. The same energy required for your stride now can take you ten or twenty feet. 

Gears help reduce the load required to do a certain amount of work. This is why you shift gears in a bike when going up a steep hill. You pedal a lot more rotations, but the load required on your legs is less so it is more efficient. If you left the gears in 1:1 you would be pushing yourself at possibly 80% maximum capacity and would be dead tired at the top. Shifting helps you conserve energy by sacrificing speed/time.  "

"That's fine but it is a problem when people expect to get that range from a car in normal driving. For example, my 24kWh LEAF is rated at 250km in Japan. Realistically it is more like 140km. I've seen plenty of people complain when they buy the car that they felt there was something wrong with their car as they're not getting near the rated range. The EPA ranges the US uses are more realistic because they take a mix of highway speeds and town driving. This is why I feel happy that Tesla is rating the model 3 long range at 310 miles (500 km) because there's a good chance of getting that in real driving."
To get enough benefit you have to be too close for safety. Not worth it. Can't see past the truck to react to anything happening further down the road. 
"Amateur.. 

Obviously you tie a rope to the truck and let it tow you, while breaking slightly. Full charge at destination."
Why wait for Tesla to do something they (likely) never will when you can buy one today? Zero makes the [DSR](http://www.zeromotorcycles.com/au/zero-ds-dsr) and [FX](http://www.zeromotorcycles.com/au/zero-fx) for adventure/off-road fun.

"Dude's an engineer at heart. They think in metric. There's absolutely no way they talk about how far it is to Mars in Miles at Spacex.

"uhm, yes, instead of 1000m you say 1km... and instead of 1000km you say 1Mm.

I don't understand why this is so difficult to grasp.  Especially considering we do this with data size measurements as well so people - even americans - are familiar with the concept: 1000 B = 1kB, and 1000kB = 1MB

"Electric bike, not electric motorcycle.  One charge on my electric bike is around 0.8 kilowatt hours.  I can easily get 40 miles per charge riding at over 15 miles per hour (sorry for using freedom units).  My bike is a Citizen Tokyo steel framed folding bike with 16"" wheels.  I installed a hub motor kit from Leaf Bike and built a battery from lithium ion cells extracted from old laptop batteries.  The hub motor kit is rated for 48v, but I overvolt it to 60v.  My top speed on flat ground is about 35 mph.  I'd probably only be able to make it about 20 miles per charge at that speed.  The total price was probably around 800 dollars.  "

"But it takes tons of energy to mine materials for and then manufacture cars, batteries, and solar panels. Humans are extremely efficient (which is why weight-loss is so hard, you can run for half an hour and only burn 200 calories) *and need to eat anyway to live*, the marginal difference of 1-200 calories to bike to work vs driving is going to be small. I'm willing to be proven wrong with some math on this, but it just seems order of magnitude away from being true."

Optimistic.
"It's also worth noting that...it's _far_ more efficient to get power from burning fuel at a power plant than by burning gasoline. Like, even the dirtiest coal is far better than any car engine."
This is also why the coal industry is making a lot of noise. They see an opportunity to stay alive.
And then you put solar tiles on your roof... 
"Efficiency of turning coal into electricity is kind of irrelevant, no? The relevant part is how much better for the environment is it to burn coal (or anything else) at an industrial scale power plant versus to burn gasoline in an individual internal combustion engine. It's much less polluting, even losing 5% of the power moving it to your house and another 15% charging your car, to produce the power in a larger facility than in your car. Unless internal combustion engines become much more efficient or our power grid became much less efficient, that would remain the same no matter what form we get the energy in.

Obviously as our electricity production switches to greener methods, that will be better. But even in the meanwhile, electric cars still pollute less for the same vehicle miles."

"That still doesn’t explain why biking is so much more efficient than driving. A car is pretty slipstream in terms of aerodynamics compared to a person isn’t it? When we’re biking, there’s a million inefficient parts adding to drag."

With Motor turned off 
No you still need to actually travel somewhere. Otherwise its completely pointless. This shows how far you can drive in optimal conditions.
Most regular people don't have access to those labs and those stats aren't ones manufacturers care about.
Elon isn't saying the car is rated at 1000km. He's saying someone went 1000km in one.  There is no confusion here IMO
That's what auto-braking is for! Right?
"Well hopefully the truck will react to it, and you'll brake faster."
Not true- Autopiloting behind a truck must be the safest place to be. They don't brake suddenly as the the truck driver has a perfect view of traffic from his elevated position. TACC is better to detect sudden braking than any human.
"I recall reading that you got non-negligible aerodynamic advantage following a truck even at 3 seconds following distance

But then you've got to drive at truck speeds"
Not good enough yet. I need something that goes 100 miles at 85mph before running out. 
"No.  Electric cars are more efficient (and very powerful) at a very low speed.  For the Tesla S, it's around 23-25 mph for maximum range.  These records generally take over 24 hours of continuous driving.

The range on my LEAF gets better the worse the traffic is.  It has little tree icons to show you how much you saved by driving electric.  When I see 3 trees, it's always a sign traffic has been hell."
"According to the Twitter release, it did take about 25-27 hours"
23-25 miles an hour. Such a huge difference. I took the lower end of the most efficient speed given because I didn't want people accusing me of inflating numbers.
~500km
"Yeah, the English still use stones for weight and horses are still measured in hands. My favorites are rods and staves (for distance), hogsheads and butts (for liquid volume), and knots and fathoms (for nautical measurements). 

A lot of farming and surveying terms are still based on older forms as well. You have an acre (the basic unit), a section (640 acres or one square mile, a township and a few others). I believe this is still the case in the U.K. as well. [An acre was the amount of land one person with an ox could plow in one day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre?wprov=sfsi1).

"Now you just have to put that rig on a TT bike and get your CDA down .23. That battery would last forever, or put your top speed at 45pmh."
"Well, yeah, that was my point haha."
"You are correct in that it requires a lot of materials and energy to make the cars, but the same can be said for all the farming equipment, transportation,  or even the energy required to cook the food you eat. 

All energy on Earth started as energy from the sun or heat from the formation of the earth. The point with solar-powered electric cars is that they get their energy directly from the sun. As I said, humans cannot do this and thus have to indirectly get energy through other means which decreases efficiency. Humans require a constant intake of food and water which require a lot of energy to produce. A car requires a lot of raw materials, but after the initial cost, require very little maintenance after traveling thousands of miles year after year. 

Currently, solar panels and batteries are just too inefficient to be viable in the sense we are discussing, that's why electric cars must be plugged in after so many hours of use. Eventually, however, solar panels will get efficient enough to power smaller vehicles without the need for charging and would only require basic maintenance to function."

What noise?
"Yeah, there's not really an efficiency calculation then.  Solar panels actually have pretty poor efficiency, but they make up for it because they are tapping into an energy source that is otherwise being wasted.

I just like to point out that if you are going to use gasoline, then there are better ways to use it."
"~30% of the power generated in the US is from coal, and Canada buys US power during some times of peak demand (just like the US buys Canada's during other times). The grids are interconnected at multiple points. I guarantee you you've purchased coal power within the last year unless you're storing that solar overnight."
"Yes, I was just explaining why bicycling is more efficient than walking or running. 

The wind drag of a human running 5 mph versus a human on a bike riding 5 mph is going to be negligible. A bicycle's profile is just too small to make much of a real difference. So the wind drag of a bike is essentially the same as a human, but the benefit is a bicycle can move a lot farther and faster. 25 mph on a bicycle versus maybe 8 mph running. If energy and time being equal, the bike is three times more efficient.

Cars, however are just incredibly poor at converting potential energy into kinetic energy. 

For starters, Regular 88 octane gas doesn't even burn 100%, so you are left with unburned gas and CO. The human body is extremely efficient at converting potential food energy into kinetic energy. It will even save it for later dates. Even if you use electric energy, car engines still get incredibly hot, several hundreds of degrees. They have thousands of moving parts which rub and cause friction and more heat. A car is incredible heavy ten times more than a 200 lb man, more so with electric because of batteries. Where as a bike is only 1/10 the weight of a 200 lb man.  They have 10 times more wind drag at the same speeds. They have four tires instead of two which causes more friction with the ground which causes more resistance which the engine must overcome. "

Stuff like this has a habit of getting out of hand though. There will be people saying the car can do 1000km when it can in just special circumstances. The number of times people who aren't into EVs abuse the facts troubles me. Realistically the car can do half that which is still amazing for an EV.

"Fair to mention that while that's the sweet spot, they are still extremely efficient up to about 80km/h after which the combination of reduced efficiency and air resistance really starts taking it's toll."

6 inches? Lemme check…
"If a Hamster is 6 inches, 2 hamsters equals 1 foot. 

1 Mile is 5280 Feet or 10560 hamsters.

621 Miles by 10560 Hamsters is 6,557,760. Which is lower than 7 million."

"This is a picture of it when I had a generic hub motor on the front.  I don't have any pictures of it with the Leaf Bike kit, which is a rear hub motor.  I had both hub motors on for a while.  The front hub motor has more torque but a lower top speed.  It added extra power but was actually restricting the rear motor at speeds over about 25mph, so I removed it since the rear motor still had plenty of torque by itself.  I do miss a cool trick I could do because the rear motor could be set to reverse while the front motor was set to forward so I could do a dual wheel burnout.  Technically the dual motor Teslas should be able to do the same thing.

A recumbent bike would be even better.  They don't allow recumbents in most bike races because it would be nothing but recumbents then.  You could also put an electric kit in a velomobile and have what would feel like an ultra efficient car. 
"Batteries are not inefficient, they just aren't energy-dense enough (compared to gas). There's a big difference. Charging and using a battery is around 85% efficient right now, that's not a lot of room for improvement. Common Solar panels are 20%, so there is room, though even if they were 100% , you still couldn't directly power a car with them, you'd only get a couple kilowatts at peak conditions, maybe enough if parked in the sun all day to go 20 miles (not bad, but super efficient solar will most likely require very exotic, costly materials).  Again, a human has to eat anyway, so a few more calories running or on a bike is *very* hard to beat with technology. "

"Sure, but ""people misrepresent facts"" has been a problem since the invention of language, and isn't really limited to EVs. Even if you have the admirable goal of eliminating that problem, I'm not sure ""chastise people who discuss or share facts that could be misrepresented"" is the best strategy."
Meh. I normally would disagree and say only a total moron would say that but I just replied to one on twitter who was saying Elon promised free autopilot to everyone. So I guess he should just never say anything about the cars for fear that some moron can't comprehend what it means 
Depends on the EV.  :-)  The Nissan LEAF has bad aerodynamics relative to a Tesla.  So its efficiency drops quite a bit with more speed.
How'd that work out for you?

"**Binary prefix**

A binary prefix is a unit prefix for multiples of units in data processing, data transmission, and digital information, notably the bit and the byte, to indicate multiplication by a power of 2.

The computer industry has historically used the units kilobyte, megabyte, and gigabyte, and the corresponding symbols KB, MB, and GB, in at least two slightly different measurement systems. In citations of main memory (RAM) capacity, gigabyte customarily means 1073741824 bytes. As this is a power of 1024, and 1024 is a power of two (210), this usage is referred to as a binary measurement.

Worth noting is that these 18650 cells are Panasonic brand and were manufactured in 2003 and sat new in some office store room until I bought them on Ebay last year.  My testing shows they have only lost about 5% of their maximum capacity from sitting around for 13 years.  
"Absolutely, batteries and solar panels have garbage efficiency compared to humans, but the premise of the article is that it is improving by leaps and bounds. No one could have imagined batteries could be as energy dense as they are now compared to twenty years ago. 

There are new technologies being developed now that there is an interest and money to be made such as with molten-salt batteries which are cheaper to produce than lithium and have a thousand times better discharge and recharge rate without the danger of catching fire or exploding and they contain no rare metals. There are many other problems, but demand for better batteries is increasing, so the technology will eventually get there. There is money to be made now in making them more efficient and solar panels depend on good efficient batteries. This is why both technologies are improving at what seems hand-in-hand. The gasoline engine car has had over one hundred years of industrial size manufacturing, availability/variety, and improvements which the solar-powered electric car has not. Just like computers will eventually surpass the human brain in all complex tasks, so to will we create a means of transportation which surpasses human efficiency. "

RIP Hamster…
"10560 hamsters x 49 miles is 517,440. 6,557,760 hamsters + 517,440 hamsters is 7,075,200.

Only if you know it far enough - better to just remember the golden ratio (~1.6) and voila.
1 mile is definitely not 2km.
Alright. Thanks.
"The internet, I guess.  There are plenty of resources out there.  You can find hub motor kits for just about any bike.  There are also mid-drive kits that are better for bike with larger wheels.  Building a battery is probably the most work, but also probably saves the most money since a battery can easily cost as much as the rest of the bike.  "
"Nah, the car would just drift around in place as all four tires spin out.  It would be the first all wheel drive car that can do burnouts.  Imagine the big cloud of toxic tire smoke.  "
That would mean the tires have enough grip to do that. I doubt it. 
That's sweet. 
That's crazy. Those batteries gained a lot of value as they are the main batteries used in the electronic cigarette market now. 
"My whole point is that battery *efficiency* is **not** improving by leaps and bounds, just energy density (and it's not even leaps and bounds, it's been a slow 3-5% per year for many years so far)... you keep confusing the two and they are **not** the same (efficiency is how much power you get out of something vs how much you put in, energy density is how much energy you can store per unit weight). Lithiums have become much more energy dense over the last 20 years, *but their efficiency hasn't really changed*. Even if they were 100% efficient, that wouldn't move them up the table in that article very much, because they are already quite efficient, and you can't get over the physics of moving a large mass around vs a light bicycle.

For the record, humans are about 25% efficient, so they are pretty much the same as solar panels. But we're very low mass compared to a car, so moving us around takes a lot less energy. Batteries are around 85%... far from ""garbage""."
"Yes, faster than I can walk"

"I'm not saying its an entirely practical thing, it's part whimsy and fun, as driving can be.

It's a nice little reminder that it's possible to squeeze more mileage out of a car by how we drive it even in lesser situations."
Dangerous driving? Hypermiling most likely means you're going really slow. Not exactly what I'd call dangerous. 
Wasn't this in the alps?
">buy the car for this,

They'd have to miss the mileage rating plastered all over the site, ordering page, confirmation page, and emails. I'd be impressed if someone dropped $100k on a car without reading anything."
"Fibonacci is easy to remember, you just add the last two numbers to get the next one. I suppose 1.6 is easier though."
"That is why it says ""approximately."""
"> the first all wheel drive car that can do burnouts

Hahaha. No. Unless you mean electric car. Turn off traction control and the common STI or Evo can spin all four easily."
"Battery technology has improved and will improve considerably. Cycle rates are improving, density is improving, weight is improving, etc. Lasting longer, performing better, and costing less are factors in efficiency. However, it seems you are now talking about discharge efficiency of which yes lithium-ion are about 99% efficient with little energy loss. On top of all of that, most consumer electronics are switching from alkaline batteries to lithium to someday perhaps as I mentioned molten-salt. Of which, the battery efficiency rates are different. 

The 25% human efficiency you are referring to is mechanical energy such as lifting a box or running. The human body has a multitude of other functions such as regulating hormone levels or basic brain functions which account for an additional 20% of energy consumption alone which is chemical not mechanical but still requires energy and this doesn't factor in all the other functions required to just exist. 

It seems you are now bouncing back and forth between which side you are arguing for. If humans are inefficient, being that 25% would be so, then cars could easily overtake them in efficiency as they are already around 30-40%. So regardless of total energy input, humans weighing less would waste energy because of inefficiency compared to a car at 30% efficiency over time. 

The idea with humans is that we have to eat which is indirect energy which requires processing which requires energy. Solar panels even at 25% energy capture, don't have to be grown and consume food daily. Sure, solar panels require energy to be made, but so do humans, the benefit of solar panels again, is they don't eat, require very little maintenance and can and will continue to be improved upon. Human's are not capable of increasing their own energy efficiency. So, as I have said, cars will someday surpass humans with the aid of solar panels and more efficient batteries. "

"This is why electric power trains are a core technology for autonomous vehicles, because they are going to have 10X higher utilization rates which puts 10X more priority on lowering operating costs and extending average vehicle lifespan. For some reason, a lot of analysts don't fully appreciate that one of Tesla's biggest advantages in autonomous vehicle tech is their significant lead on electric vehicle power train production. Tony Seba's RethinkX did a case study on the company featured in this article, Tesloop, and tried to extrapolate [just how significant the operating cost advantage](http://i.imgur.com/iB2LNVE.jpg) will be for electric vehicles vs ICEs once autonomous driving software is sufficient for full-scale transportation-as-a-service (TaaS). [Here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/585c3439be65942f022bbf9b/t/591a2e4be6f2e1c13df930c5/1494888038959/RethinkX+Report_051517.pdf) is his entire white paper on the subject and [here](http://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/Self-Driving-Cars_ARK-Invest-WP.pdf?hsCtaTracking=e1ba6de4-092d-49d3-96f1-4842a8352a59%7C6b53c09b-7846-4e6f-90be-340a674f20f7) is another white paper from a different investment firm that reaches the same conclusions."
"Would love to see this same analysis with having to pay for the electricity. Assuming 320kWh per mile, I estimate they used 96,000 kW of electricity over 300k miles. If you are paying $0.15/kWh to charge that means you spent $14,400 in fuel. Additionally, I assume their employees are paid by the hour at a rate of $20-25/hr and having to wait at superchargers would cost money as well. Assuming an average of 45/min of charging per 200 miles of driving, you have a total of 1,125 hours spent charging. At $25/hr that is a cost of $28,125 in labor. 

Now add to this the lost revenue of the car not being in service for 1,125 hours a year - that is about 560 trips to Las Vegas at a rate of $60 per trip - that is $33,750 in lost revenue. 

Now I'm not saying all of these numbers add up, but there is always more to the equation than meets the eye. Just using the cost of electricity + labor you get a cost of $42,500 over 300,000 miles. That cuts into their savings by 2/3. Add lost revenue to the math and they may have actually lost money depending on their occupancy rates. "

It's odd for the superchargers to apply when you use it for business purposes.
That's an extreme exaggeration. If you have cars you drive like that you'll have someone do the maintenance. It's not that expensive if you're not paying a luxury dealer ridiculous amounts.

"I think people are over looking the fact that most cars see less than 200,000 miles before they go to the junk yard and this car is over 300K and still going. I'm honestly really curious to see how far it gets before they finally replace it."
"$2.50 per gallon, 30 miles per gallon = 300,000 miles = $25,000 in gas cost. So it cost $35,000 in maintenance for this car? My 100,000 gas car maintenance checkup is $1200 plus new tires $500 = 1700$ total. How much does it cost to up keep a Tesla?  "
That seems like a sweet deal.
"And 10,000 gallons of fuel."
"Comments here are awesome and mind boggling but forget about gas savings and think instead of driving 1000km a day every day for 2 years, any car would break down.

Tesla is not only electric but a damn reliable car. "
"Anyone notice that the company is forecasting another 600,000 miles of use? That's insane.  A gas car is pretty much done by 300k, let alone another 600k on top of that."
"They saved on maintenance because Tesla picked it up through warranty. It's not indicative of anything, especially because the Model 3 will have a less generous warranty for example."
"**25% of Tesla owners used to own a Prius.** At 50 mpg and $2.50/gallon, a Prius owner would have a fuel cost of only 6,000 gallons * ($2.50/gallon) = $15k, or 5 cents per mile. At 333 watt-hours per mile, and 12 cents/kWh, a Tesla would cost 4 cents per mile, and thus have a 300,000 mile fuel cost of $12k. The 27 synthetic-oil changes in the Prius (the first two would be free), at $55 each, would add $1,500 to the Prius cost, but the difference in tire cost (favoring the Prius) would exceed that.

Conclusion: **driving a Tesla vs a Prius doesn't save $60k in fuel and maintenance over 300,000 miles.**"

"But remember, you pay $100K for a Tesla.  I can buy a combustion engine car for $25K. And would never spend $75K (the difference) in gas over 20 years.  The Tesla owner is still out more money than a regular car user.  The OP is experiencing whats called in economics the sunk cost falicy.

I'll buy it for $10 K but I'm certain that's not how the use car market for EVs work. I'm curious how devaluation calculates on a vehicle slated easily for a million miles.
"It all depends on the mpg and price/gal of the car you were driving instead of a Tesla.  It doesn't matter how long it took you.  Without considering maintenance cost, you could save $60,000 if you were getting 20 mpg and paying $4/gal. "

"Also interested. 300,000 mi/ 20 mpg = 15,000 gallons.  At $4 a gallon that's $60,000 on fuel.

"Just a quick googlin'... http://clark.com/cars/2014-list-cheapest-cars-own/  says $0.40/mile for a Prius or Fit. .... times 300,000 miles..."
"The Model S competes in the Large Luxury category against the Mercedes S class, BMW 7-series, the big Jaguar, etc.  Determining the maintenance costs of those cars is as easy as looking up the cost for each recommended service, which is determined by mileage.  

The costs are heart-stoppingly high.  Mercedes has an 'A' service every 10k miles then a 'B' service every 20k miles (so A & B alternate every 10k).  On my old C class the A service was something like $300 and the B service was almost twice that.  These did not include the more irregular service items like fuel filters, belts, hoses, brakes (couple thousand $), etc.  My BMW is similar and I suspect the Jag is also.

Consider the monthly mileage and that this company would service the cars more than once a month, spending cash hand over fist.  I have no problem believing their maintenance estimate."
"but that entire whitepaper was garbage.

They, like here, do a whole bunch of extrapolating for how long an ICE vehicle in a similar situation can last then divide.  Since the ICE has a falsely low denominator, costs per mile skyrocket.  Tesloop is doing the same thing in this article.  How exactly did they get to $86k in maintenance on an ICE in two years?  A huge part of this savings is from the uniquely free energy use, which is not scalable."
"> don't fully appreciate that one of Tesla's biggest advantages in autonomous vehicle tech is their significant lead on electric vehicle power train production.

Significant lead?  Its a [motor connected to a single speed reduction gear box.](http://d2ojs0xoob7fg0.cloudfront.net/evtv-word-press/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IMG_3988.jpg)  It isn't exactly the most mechanically complicated thing in the world to design.  

What I think many do not fully appreciate around here is the biggest advantage the rest of the industry has is in pure manufacturing ability.  If we go back to WWII, GM pivoted overnight and became the worlds largest producer of [airplanes](http://www.adbranch.com/wp-content/uploads/ww2_cadillac_magazine_ad_1943-610x613.jpg) and [tanks](http://cdn.barnfinds.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1940s-WW-II-Era-Cadillac-Tank-ad.jpg).  If we go back to the 90's, they became the worlds largest communication satellite manufacturer.  (they designed and built Direct TV and its satellites.)

If you look at recent examples, the brand new 2018 Equinox just went into production.  Completely new chassis, dimensions, and powertrains.  Its basically an all-new vehicle.  GM shut down the Ingersoll plant for two weeks for retooling.  It came back online and instantly started producing around 5,000 Equinoxs a week.  With excellent build quality.  No 6 month s-curve ramp-up shenanigans like Tesla is fumbling through trying to get the 3 line up to speed.  

That is the biggest difference between the established car companies and Tesla.  Designing a car on paper is easy enough.  Producing 100's of thousands of them through market ups and downs **at a profit** is the real trick and something Tesla has not come close to mastering yet."

They reached into their ass and just grabbed for it.
Seems like 20mpg @ $4/gallon which = $60k at 300k miles. That's fuel so another $10-$25k in repairs. 
"Without looking at everything this isn’t exactly indicative of superior maintenance costs. They drive a lot of highway.  I’d like to see the run time or “engine” hours.

An ICE run purely highways racking up lots of miles will normally go just fine with fluid changes. Very minimal costs. It’s the hard miles that add up to more maintenance. Lots of idling and stop and go driving is horrible. With all things equal I’d rather have a 300k mile highway car than a 150k mile car that’s been purely city driven. On top of that many cars can get 30+mpg on the hwy and see that number drop drastically while it’s putting around. 

If this Tesla was driven like an inner city taxi and accumulated that many miles it would paint a better picture as to how it can handle long term abuse.

"Warranty is not maintenance. You still have to pay for yearly maintenance on the Tesla, and it's not cheap ($475-$850+ every 12,500 miles). However, it's also not mandatory so technically you can save those costs."
They are using free supercharging in this specific article example - but otherwise you are correct if it was a regular consumer that pays for electricity/has that efficiency/etc.
Check your math there... tell me a car this size that costs that much to drive 150k miles per year. 
"At 150,000 miles, with gas costing $3/gallon, and resulting in $3000 /year total fuel cost... that means the car would be getting 150MPG.  I agree $60,000 is too high... but the real number should be around $15,000. "
"I don't know the expected battery life, but it does state that the battery in this car is still charging to 93% capacity. I think that's pretty damn good for 300k miles. The battery *should* have quite a lot of life left in it yet!"

Das good mane
Thanks I must have skimmed over it. 93% sounds really good to me if that's the case. 
That's good as fuck. Smart phones would be at 80% after 2 years. 
I agree with your conclusion that claimed maintenance price is very high but fuel isn't $4 per gallon where i live and cars that only get 20mpg are limited.
">  At $4 a gallon that's $60,000 on fuel. 


Gas is $2/Gallon where I live, and in every surrounding State.  Pretty sure that's the case in the majority of the US right now. "
"City driving, car idle, and loss of efficiency over time all impact fuel usage.  On average, cars get about 84% of their stated efficiency. So, about 16.8 mpg for a car with 20 mpg. At $4 a gallon that would be: $71,428.57

https://www.honestjohn.co.uk/realmpg/

National average for gas is: $2.40 = $42857.14"
"Oil changes alone would add another grand (at least) to the total price tag.  Spark plugs, timing belt changes, etc.  Doesn't seem like that unrealistic of an estimate.

What I wish they'd shown is a breakdown of what warranty service was done.  12 days in the shop isn't bad, but I'd still like to know what was done in those 12 days."
really it's like the third paragraph where they set the savings into context with a similarly priced ICE Vehicle... how does nobody read this?
"Holy shit, that's 5 YEAR TOTAL OWNERSHIP AVERAGE, you can't compare it, this list is from real data with lots and lots of people. You can't say that a tesla won't break down in 5 years when EVs in general are still a fairly unproven market and don't have a track record to talk for them. 

The technology inside of a tesla is much more pricey if something fails and is not as easy to replace as a part of an engine is. Sure, you don't have to do regular maintenance, but if in 5 years time 2% of the cars have a need for batteries to come out, your estimate is fucked. 

I'm not against electric cars, but when something sounds too good to be true, it is. And comparing real long term ownership costs to an ""estimated fuel saved"" number from one car that drove **more than double** of what an average truck does, **does** sound too good to be true.

"These comparisons are usually done against similarly luxurious/large cars, which makes sense. 

We're many years away from a new Tesla being the cheapest way to drive 300k miles. You're still better off buying a used Fit or Yaris and running it into the ground. But if you want a great ride in a luxurious car, you aren't looking at Fits."
"That number I'm sure includes depreciation, which I'm sure Tesloop is not accounting for. "
[deleted]
"*maintenance and fuel.*  From http://clark.com/cars/2014-list-cheapest-cars-own/ it seems that a Prius or a Fit cost $0.40/mile.  At 300,000 miles, that's 120,000 dollars.  Remember, most people drive 10k/year.  So 300,000 is 30 years' worth of driving.  Edit: Also, electricity cost per mile is quite a bit cheaper than gasoline; not free as you point out, but cheap.

Edit: Oh, I'm learning... $0.40/mile ""is not the number you're looking for.""  It assumes only 15k miles / year, and includes ALL costs over the 5 years, not just variable costs."
"I think that includes fuel usage over 300k miles vs 2 years. True the free energy doesn't scale yet, but is roughly half the cost if paid for per Tesla's calculations on a per use basis.

Though at ~ 30MPG fuel would be $20,000 at the current $2 per gallon average. so 66k maintenance

According to Edmunds.com, the cost to own a 2009 Nissan Quest 4-door minivan over 5 years (assuming 15,000 miles a year) is approximately $47,500 broken down through fuel, taxes, maintenance, repairs, financing, insurance AND depreciation.  

A Jetta 2010 is 35k per Edmunds."
True because I've had my previous car for two years and only did tire balance and an alignment twice and didn't spend thousands. Cost me less than $300 within those two years. I rotate the tires myself and didn't replace the calipers and breaks within those two years.
"Why are you saying they use a falsely low denominator? Because the ICE vehicle lifespan numbers and cost/mile for ICE used in both of these white papers are consistent with multiple independent sources, including [AAA](http://theapopkavoice.com/what-is-the-true-cost-of-vehicle-ownership/), [Google](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&q=what+is+the+average+lifespan+of+a+vehicle&oq=what+is+the+average+lifespan+of+a+vehicle&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i30k1l3.309.309.0.462.2.1.0.0.0.0.149.149.0j1.1.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.1.149.0.T7J3k0era4g), and [my own research](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5s8562/real_talk_about_the_cost_of_maintaining_repairing/).

"If it is so easy and quick for them to make cars why are most manufacturers not expected to have long range electric models until 2020+?

I think a big point your missing is Brand. Tesla has a strong brand and followers who freely push that brand because they believe in their mission. I think the best thing established manufacturers can do is start EV-only brands, ones where they don't have ICE cars being pushed alongside EVs. That way the salesmen have one mission: sell and educate people on EVs. "
"Significant lead in electric power train *production* . Tesla is already the world's largest OEM BEV producer and has higher BEV production growth rate targets than all other manufacturers combined. Since BEVs are a core technology for autonomy and on the critical path for development (for the reasons stated above), that puts them at a huge advantage. All they have to do is stay on par with competing OEMs in software and they can capture the most market share.

Tesla hasn't scaled yet, so its profit numbers now are basically pointless to focus on and definitely pointless to compare to a mature OEM at full scale. I don't know how many times this point has been explained."
"The only real lead is in battery technology and production.

Remember that Teslas goal is to accelerate the move to electric cars, the profits later down the road might have to come from their lead in battery tech. Their competition in this field sits in Asia, not in established car manufacturers. "
"I think you make some really good points, on the manufacturing front Tesla cannot compete with GM. However I do think there is a false equivalency between your examples and an electric vehicle. The Battery/Power pack. The only reason electric vehicles have never worked out (and they have been around for well over a hundred years) is because of energy storage. 

Producing airplanes? Aluminum goes in, airplane goes out. New car? Materials go in, car goes out. These things can be replicated once the tooling and knowledge is had. Where i have trouble believing this argument comes down to the battery and software.

The single most expensive thing with the electric vehicle is the battery pack. If you cannot get it to last or be reliable, you cannot make a profit with electric vehicles. Tesla has recognized this from the very beginning and invested heavily in it. Their partnership with Panasonic has lead to the creation of the gigafactory to keep the QA in house on the battery production. Their software and inverter tech leads the world. These things mean the battery can last for hundreds of thousands of miles while giving excellent range and charge performance. This is the real reason I think Tesla will remain the leader with electric vehicles. 

I do not think Tesla's battery tech and management can be easily replicated or matched."

Chauffeur between Los Angeles and Los Vegas. In some cases it may be better to drive than fly. Private jet hire is still many times more than a chauffeur. 
"Average of the total, yeah. But in a peak month where they're doing 17k, it's 600 mi/day. "
"17,000x12=204,000

204,000/365=560"
It's supposed to charge itself along the way.

Good bot.
They drove fucking 9 hours every single damn day? Must be either a taxi driver or some test unit? 
Mind = blown
Big if true.
Tell me more. 
"I mean, it can drive itself, right?"
"Paying a relatively minimal amount to test the durability and limits of the cars you make? Strategically funding stress limit tests of your product in order to better market it?

Pretty obvious play by Tesla tbh, I bet every car manufacturer performs similar durability tests on their vehicles. Props to Tesla for having such strong results. They're doing a really good thing. "

Ah. Yeah that is crazy. They must be supercharging I don't think you can get that many miles a day with normal charging. 
Average for new privately-owned passenger vehicles is 15k in the first year. The average person aged 20-44 drives 15k per year.
There's a policy for supercharging to often?
Isn't that the point of charging stations though???
"Not sure why you got downvoted for asking a question, but it was started by a 16 year old (18 now I think) and is run partly by him now and his father. He was on the latest podcast episode of the pitch."
"yes, although it's quite generous to call it a business.

it's entirely subsidized by new Tesla owners because Elon reneged his promise to punish Supercharger abusers.

but yeah, same dude."
He's probably 18 now.
No?
Tesla just calls it a TPC.
It would be cool if it disengaged the lock on the cable once charging completes. There'd still be a little room for abuse if you decided to bump from 90 to 100% if you 'needed' extra time but still could be an improvement

"Different battery chemistry. This proves EVs can be just as reliable and go just as many miles, if not more, than ICE vehicles. By 300k most would be looking at what, a transmission rebuild, 50 or so oil changes, multiple gaskets for multiple parts.

Damnit I want an EV. ❤️"
Mine goes from 100% to 10% in 5 hours
Worse.  My S7 edge which is only about 18 months old is already at 76% capacity.  Supposedly the newer model will last longer but we will see.
"80% after 2 years? That's not even close. You'd have less than 80% just by the time degradation alone, without any charge cycles at all. You'd be lucky to be at 50% after 2 years of daily charges."

20 mpg or 12 L/100km - that isn't exactly good mileage. I get 27.6 mpg or 8.5 L/100km in my 2006 Nissan Sentra...
"Hrm, 

$4/gal is rough, but not unfathomable.  Although last I checked not too long ago CA avg. premium gas price was $2.88/gal (now it's ~$3 --http://www.californiagasprices.com/Prices_Nationally.aspx?d=metro see Los Angeles.)  I've seen >$3/gal in MV/SF area.  I figure people renting Tesla's are in pricier areas so premium gas well above $3/gal is not unexpected. (SF/Hollywood/BeverlyHills prices can be well above $4 and approaching $5/gal for outliers) see: (http://www.californiagasprices.com/index.aspx?fuel=C) 

Given: 300k mi; using 6erGC awd's 20mpg:

"This was operating in CA, where fuel is nearly $4 a gallon RIGHT NOW, and probably going higher soon. A BMW 540i is rated for a combined 24mpg, so estimating 20mpg is probably not too far off."
Over the course of last 2 years average might be closer to 3 total but yeah 4/gal is a little rediculous
"NOT FOR LONG
"
"You know, except for California. Where this service runs. (it's a chauffer between LA and SF. Gas here ranges from $3 to $3.50 a gallon, rarely 4 though). "
just around 2.80 here in wa. for regular anyway.
"Prius owners achieve the EPA estimates, and 25% of Tesla owners used to own a Prius. Also, your source is in the UK, not the US. The US has the strictest fuel-economy estimate standards. Try [Fuelly](http://www.fuelly.com/)."
"Oil changes would add **$1,485** to a Prius (27 x **$55**). Spark plugs would only need to be changed twice on a Prius (iridium plugs @ **120k** and **240k**). There are no belts anywhere in a Prius drivetrain."
"If, 5 years down the road, your battery needs replacing Tesla will cover that for free.  Battery (and drive unit) is warranteed for 8 years and unlimited miles which is longer than most buyers will have the car.   This is the equivalent of an unlimited mileage engine and fuel system unlimited warranty for the same amount of time on an internal combustion vehicle, which no manufacturer offers.

If this car continues to drive the same rate for the entire 8 year span and puts 1.2 million miles on the car, that battery is still a $0 replacement as long as the owner gets it in to a Tasla store before the date of the 9th year starts.  Your battery estimate is not fucked, that's still $0.  

I would expect a lot of other not-8-year-warranty stuff to go out in that million mile insanity drive that will be out of warranty, but the battery is free."
Maybe with insurance added?
"1 Mile = 1.6km.  
26 x 1.6 = 41.6 cents per mile. "
"Maybe I'm simply taking your bait, but $.26/km is $.42/mi.  Nearly spot on the estimate.  The fact you're mixing ""cents"" with ""km"" tells me maybe you're fishing/trolling here.  But there it is anyway.  Are your ""cents"" Canadian?  In that case $.42CND becomes $.33USD."
"Interesting... I have a similar car but have never done the calculation. 
 Out of curiosity, did you include depreciation and interest costs?"
"You're not taking into account depreciation though. Not super easy to estimate until you actually sell or scrap the car, unless you do as I do and assume it blows up and is worth $0 at a given mileage. So if you assume your $28k car will last to 300k, that's another 9.3c/mi in depreciation. Not far off their estimate for a Fit, and my guess is they assumed it would last to only 200k (my own personal standard estimate)."
Also worth noting that the Toyota Prius has literally the [cheapest maintenance costs of any car in the world](https://d3vl3jxeh4ou3u.cloudfront.net/Which%20Models%20Start%20Out%20the%20Most%3ALeast%20Expensive%20rev.png).
"A large part of that $0.40 per mile cost is depreciation.  Depreciation is not linear and stops becoming a factor once a car is higher mileage.  

So if you're trying to calculate cost for 300k miles, it's going to be way way lower than $0.40/mile average cost. "
"It's actually not really that much cheaper, and in many cases, it's more expensive in the US.

It costs roughly $0.12 per kWh on average in the US. Averaging out, you get about 300 wH/mile in a Tesla, or $0.04/mile.

Gas is between $1.89 and $3.50 per gallon, depending on where you live.

A decent car will get 30 mpg, or $0.063/mile to $0.12/mile. 
A good car will get 45 mpg, or $0.042/mile to $0.08/mile.

This is just fuel costs. Obviously, if you use solar, you come out ahead, if you pay more than the national average, you might come out behind. If you pay significantly more than the national average, you might be losing money on fuel. This would happen if you are paying more than $0.36/kWh at 30mpg or more than $0.54/kWh at 45mpg."
"So $20k in fuel and $66k in maintenance.

Stating $66k in maintenance in the first two years of ownership for a fleet vehicle is nuts.  Literally what is being done to get to these cars?

"
"Depends where you live... Electricity is very pricey in some parts of the country. In the northeast, it costs the same per mile to run my Volt on electric or gas right now. But our electric is about twice the national average :( Luckily I can charge for free at work a lot, which cuts down my electric average a ton. "
"False. According to your source, that's total cost of ownership: ""The 2 hands down winners based on **total 5-year ownership costs** are theToyota Prius and the Honda Fit."""
"So $66k maintenance how?

The Edmunds includes so many other things (financing, insurance, depreciation and taxes) that i'm not sure why you posted those numbers at all.  Do you have a maintenance only cost for a Jetta over the very first 2 years of life?  My guess is ~$1k.  Oh, but Tesloop is predicting $66k!

Final note, a fleet vehicle has much different costs than a home use vehicle. "
The whitepaper used 200k usable life on an ICE.  That is dumb.
"> If it is so easy and quick for them to make cars why are most manufacturers not expected to have long range electric models until 2020+?
> 

Because they actually want to make a profit with the cars they're selling. 

Also the customers won't be as forgiving when it comes to other manufacturers - Tesla can sell a luxury vehicle without auto wipers, with horrible panel gaps and misaligned chrome, without adjustable seat belts(!) because it's a new hip startup (at least in the eyes of customers). 

If Mercedes would offer cars at a similar price point with similar flaws they'd damage their reputation AND not find buyers."
"> why are most manufacturers not expected to have long range electric models until 2020+?

You know how Tesla is losing $400 million a quarter?  Before any investment in CapEx?  Thats a big reason why.  Once real maket demand is there, and EVs become economical ($35K base model 3 is not) for mainstream consumption, everyone will be in the market overnight."
">Tesla hasn't scaled yet

Exactly, and that is my point.  Being number one in something that only makes up 1% of the market isn't much more than a marketing bullet point.  As we are seeing, the rest of the industry is just starting to enter in force and whatever default lead Tesla has now will quickly be surpassed by everyone else.   Scaling is the hardest part.  Thats why they are called auto *manufacturers*.  Its the manufacturing that is the hard part.   Figuring out how to bolt a motor to a single speed gearbox isn't going to slow any of the rest of the industry down one bit.   Tesla figuring out how to actually produce cars in mass while keeping quality up and actually turning a profit is going to be a minor miracle. "
"Significant lead in electric power train production? Wait, is that supposed to mean something?

Anyone and their momma can go out an build an electric motor, serialist. It's a very simple piece of machinery."
">Their competition in this field sits in Asia

And even there, they rely on Asian manufacturer Panasonic to make all their batteries.  Further more, everything that goes into them comes from Asia like the cathode material they get from Sumitomo.  The only thing they manage to make onsite is the casings."
They are also way ahead in autonomous driving tech.
"I agree with you on Tesla's strategic advantage in battery tech, but that may not be a big inhibitor to the big autos.

GM is able to buy batteries from suppliers that will be good (see Bolt).  That battery will likely have cost more than Tesla, but it just reduces margin in that area.  If they can make up that margin in other areas, then it is a wash.  If they cannot, then they could simply work with thinner margins and higher units for same profit dollars.  Or, they take it as an area where they underperform long term, but still are profitable and keep moving forward.

If GM is able to release 3 new EVs in the time it takes Tesla to get one new style done, then it won't really matter how much bigger Tesla's margin is because they will be a niche player while GM goes on to create a good-enough EV in many different styles."
[deleted]
Correct - but my math on the cost is accurate. I just mixed up my naming. 
Jesus....just replaced my Subarus headlight for $100...
The way you capitalized Turkey makes me believe you hit a country.
I'm guessing you have the dope ass infinity lights. Totally worth
"Correct.

That's also a fairly slow rate.  An empty battery can be around 300 mi/hr.  As the amount of charge of the battery increases, the charging rate decreases.  I'd guess he's nearing 70% charge, but could be wrong.  There could also be another car plugged into the same charger (reduces the rate of charge). "
"Yeah I had no idea what it's been or where they are I just know Cali gas had been very expensive in the past. I don't know how hey got their numbers so I used numbers that fit. If they're too high we know they had to be using a lower mpg or much too high repair costs. I think 20 mpg is fair though or low enough. 

At $2.50 and 20mpg it's only $37,500 for fuel. "
In Canada it's about 4.50$/gal :(
Not for premium and in California

"TL;DR: WRT to fueling costs, I concur on econoboxes (differs on powerful cars), but keep an eye on incentives, off-peak rates, taxes, and regional bans too in addition to non-US gas & electricity prices (e.g. Norway: ~$9.50/gal Norway & ~20c/kWh residential / ~10c/kWh industrial)

It's approx 13c/kWh stateside avg. now IINM.  A MS 75D would be ~$4.29/100mi (~$13c/kWh US avg) vs BMW 6 Gran Coupe (note it is 4dr) ~$12.95/100mi ($2.88/gal CA premium avg.) [comparable weight, footprint, cost]

Hyundai Ioniq (Hybrid) will do $4.23/100mi.  Ioniq BEV would do ~$3.25/100 mi.

Prices will fall on batteries in < decade such that BEV premium will be comparable or even less than hybrid drivetrain premium (e.g. 50kW @ $80/kWh) [http://wardsauto.com/ideaxchange/two-tidbits-ces] (i.e. instead of adding hybrid premium to ICE for $2k for example; skip combined ICE & hybridEV components and go entirely BEV for same cost.)

I think major wildcard factors will be: 

(1) Off peak charging can put it at 10c/kWh on dedicated meter in California or even 6c/kWh allegedly in competitive bid locations in Texas.

(2) Carbon taxes (if they're ever implemented; more likely in CA or other progressive or pollution-concerned states/countries.)

(3) BEV incentives if carbon taxes don't get sufficient traction.

"Just saying if you have solar you come out ahead is not necessarily fair. If you own the system, you spent a lot of upfront to buy/install it so that cost has to get amortized out over the expected life and production of the panels, and what you consume for charging you car is also electricity you could be selling back to the grid, so there is lost personal revenue there which can be another indicator of the fuel cost.

"Why are we compare to fuel economy of Prius and why are people compare to average US fuel cost?  Tesloop based in Southern California.  The premium fuel price around here is over $3 on average over the last 2 years.  With an average 25mpg (being generous) for a Model S size/weight/price class (S-class, 7-series).  That's over $12/100 miles = $36k in fuel alone for 300k miles - $70k fuel/maintenance savings = $34k for maintenance.  With luxury ICE vehicles' fancy 7- 8- 9- speed auto transmission, will be shocking if they don't need to replace or rebuild for thousands before 300k miles.  Brakes?  30-40k for 4 will be 7-8 times $1000.  Motor oil, trans oil, plus add an engine rebuild to improve ever-degrading fuel economy (be paying extra for fuel anyway even if you don't).

"> Figuring out how to bolt a motor to a single speed gearbox isn't going to slow any of the rest of the industry down one bit

This is a ridiculous statement. The difficulty in manufacturing EVs has nothing to do with motors or gearboxes and EVERYTHING to do with batteries.

The other manufacturers can re-tool to assemble commodity motors and gearboxes and other car parts all they want, but where will they get their batteries? They're stuck relying on suppliers like LG Chem or Samsung who aren't making anywhere near the level of investment in production that Tesla/Panasonic is with the gigafactory(ies). If and when they decide to start large-scale EV production they'll most likely have no other choice but to buy batteries from Tesla."
"> The rest of the industry is just starting to enter in force and whatever default lead Tesla has now will quickly be surpassed by everyone else.

Keeping this on record. I'm saving this comment and enshrining it on my wall. We're going to revisit this in 2 years so that I can make sure you understand how horrible terrible this argument is."
"Motors are not really on the critical path for electric power train production development, I agree. Batteries, however...."
"I dont think that companies can just buy batteries on the maeket and call it done. Especially li-ion. The software and management is crucial or the batteries can be destroyed or have their longevity greatly reduced. If 1 battery goes bad, then every battery in that series is bad...it becomes incredibly complex to make it robust."
"Why are you assuming that an autonomous vehicle fleet would be owned and maintained by a single company? Tesla has already made it clear that it intends to use *consumer owned vehicles* that the *consumer is responsible for maintaining*. So of course you need to factor in maintenance costs, because it directly affects the profitability of the people who are lending their personally owned cars to the system."

"> Your point here being that $60k could be spent on fuel. Got it.

No prob.  I wasn't trying to harp any point; was just adding data points to help foster discussion and direction attention to {ICE vs HEV vs BEV; comparable premium ICE; variations in cost; US vs foreign costs} to make readers cognizant of variations in implicit boundaries/scopes' impacts on this discussion.

> So, a more accurate title could be ""A Tesla Model S hits 300,000 miles using superchargers – saving an estimated $60,000 on fuel""

I think they could have left it as is and noted a majority of savings was from energy costs (although premium dealer timing belt, sparks, and brakes could add up to pretty penny I'm assuming whereas the BEV should have minimal wear on pads due to regen --and as long as brakes are actually used on occasion there should be no actuator seizing repairs either.)  I'm wary of Audi S7 & BMW 650i AWD's turbo engines WRT to 300k mi life however; I imagine they're a (probably exhilarating) sword of Damocles.)

Edit: see related: 

- 6er (http://dashboard-light.com/vehicles/BMW_6_Series.html) & 

- A7 (http://dashboard-light.com/vehicles/Audi_A7.html)

- S6 (http://dashboard-light.com/vehicles/Audi_S6.html) (S7 not in database)

Earlier comparisons with Prius seemed apples to oranges so I added a reference more in line with Teslopp's [comparable ICE] line.

I incidentally also noted econobox (Ioniq) comparison (both hybrid, BEV, and equal weight ICE) which gave ~2:1 #s (ICE vs BEV) and nearly same #s (hybrid vs BEV) you may find of interest (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6wysxp/a_tesla_model_s_hits_300000_miles_in_just_2_years/dmc5q84/)

> Which is great for Tesloop, but which is not a benefit of EV over ICE (how it is billed), is only a benefit to Tesla Model S and X users

By my estimation; the 6erGC awd would be ~ 3:1 cost ratio @ $3/gal and 4:1 @$4/gal vs 13c/kWh.  Not including off-peak and incentives, those should be non-trivial advantage BEV vs ICE.  I'm also under impression that performance luxury ICE vehicles likely have lower issue-free powertrain lifespan as they're designed to maximize perf. rather than low-maintenance longevity.  These together should be worth considering.  

Similarly MX100D (4.7s 0-60) is more akin to Mercedes GLS550 4matic for street purposes (e.g., non-track/non-off-road.) [16mpg combined; 6.3gal/100mi]\(https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2017_Mercedes-Benz_GLS-Class.shtml) 

Couldn't find Model X 100D, only P100D (39kWh/100mi) vs (37kWh/100mi for MX 90D); (https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=38530)

That's ~4:1 fuel cost ratio @ $3/gal for MX 90D & 3.7:1 ratio for MX P100D @ 13c/kWh (5:1 ratio at $4/gal gas.)

> and which is a significant cost passed on to Tesla's other buyers.

I'm guessing the net impact is relatively minor on aggregate vehicle price basis since most folks are charging at home and not utilizing the cross country feature often.  It's a non-trivial amount of the electricity cost savings certainly (e.g. MS: ~100MWh = ~$13k & MX: ~115MWh = ~$15k over 300k mi.  GLS 550 would be ~$55k-$75k gasoline over same 300k mi. @ $3-$4/gal)

Note: EPA combined city/highway fuel consumption estimates used for calculations above for both ICE & BEV."
"https://www.napaonline.com/en/auto-parts/toyota/prius/2016/belts-hoses

I don't see any belts there.

It's been many years since any new Prius has shipped with a belt: http://www.carstuffshow.com/blogs/a-beltless-engine.htm

""The 2010 Toyota Prius is going to be equipped with a beltless engine. According to Toyota's press release, ""The 1.8-liter Prius engine is the first Toyota power plant that requires no belts under the hood for better fuel economy and less potential maintenance."" That's right, no belts. And that means no more chirping or squealing belts under the hood when you start your car in the morning. No more belt tensioners to adjust. No more belts to slip off of various pulleys and the expensive component (or engine) repairs that are sure to follow. And increased fuel economy, too? Personally, I think this is a good development.

All of the accessories that are normally powered by the engine (via a series of belts or a single serpentine belt, in some cases) are now powered by electric motors. That means that the power steering pump, air conditioner, alternator and even the water pump all are electrically driven. In addition to the reduced maintenance and increased fuel economy, this means that any (or all) of the accessories can remain functional -- even when the engine isn't running."""
"Correct, range loss over time is considered normal within an expected dropoff curve.  Fall outside of that drop (which is far better than I thought it would be going in) and they service the battery."
"The upkeep is absolutely not $0.  My car goes through tires in 5000 miles, and at the price per tire for ab21"" plus pack Tesla 300,000 miles of driving would put me over $90,000 in tire replacement cost.

I made and make no claims in regards to $0 upkeep and definitely had no idea you were discussing Nissan or Chevy rather than the 300,000 mile Tesla - and by extension every other Tesla -  this post is about.  I merely wanted to educate you on the incorrect assumption that battery costs were even a slight concern before the ninth year of ownership for the car that is the topic of this discussion.

Battery - and electricity if you're willing to *only* supercharge - are free for Tesla owners... Forever, for those of us with cars over 9 months old.  The oil change at break in is free, and there are no more oil changes that I'm aware of though they may call for another eventually, so the expected ICE annual drivetrain maintenance is zero with a probably diff oil change on the high mile car in question, with question marks of that being free (and probably not).  Motor replacement if necessary is free.  But on year 5 all the suspension, steering, and moving parts that aren't battery or motor have a cost like any other car.  And that tire cost is ridiculous - though this was a  base S that uses cheaper tires that last much longer this car still has a measurable expense in tire replacement behind it and probably ahead of it.  And of course this article outlines the $6,900 spent on scheduled maintenance and $3500 for a headlight replacement as part of those 300,000 miles that are well above $0 as well."
"Depreciation is actual spending! It's just a ""silent cost"" since you tend not to amortize purchase price over the life of the car, only thinking about it when you go to sell/scrap it. "
"I'm pretty sure it does take into account depreciation. It *has* to, because otherwise my 11-year-old Chrysler minivan is cheaper to operate than a Honda Fit. No way is that the case. 

I actually find the depreciation calculation most useful when I'm buying a car, so I can conpare TCO vs other cars that might be even more expensive but depreciate slower. Something like a 10-year-old Lotus Elise ($30k) kept for 2 years can actually be cheaper than a new Chrysler 200 ($22k) kept for the same length of time, for example. But you wouldn't know it unless you estimated depreciation, so you might pass up the Lotus in favor of the Chrysler just because ""it's cheaper."""
"Still a little early to know if Tesloop's experience is indicative of the aggregate owner experience, but that's an awesome first data point!"

"Sure, you should factor all of those things in to your buying decision, but we are talking about the fuel costs. 

Electric vs Gas is not as big a gap as people think it is in many places and depending on what they would be driving instead. 

A good example is myself. I pay about $0.12/kWh before taxes, comes to about $0.14/kWh after taxes and fees. Before I got a Tesla, my fuel mileage over the past 200,000 miles was about 39 MPG - it would have been better if I optimized by fuel economy instead of power - so I actually come out slightly behind in cost when the fuel price dips real low. I'm usually at about break even at ""normal"" prices, and I come out slightly ahead when it jumps up. In my area of the country, fuel prices are on the low side... if I lived in CA or somewhere else that had high fuel costs, I'd be in much better shape on a cost per mile basis as far as fueling goes.

I'm not complaining though, I love driving the car and it's worth the premium as it were. There's not much for incentives where I'm at, so there's not much to offset that. The one major factor, though, is that my city has an EV initiative where they have installed about 1700 free charging stations around the city... so I use those as often as possible and it has offset my fueling costs immensely. I saved about $4000 in fuel costs last year using the public stations instead of my home.

"I agree, and it is the issue I have with most of the analyses here.  Much maintenance is due to time as well as miles.  There are typical lifetimes on components but driving 300k miles in 2 years is not typical.  One cannot simply take the average lifetime on a pair of breaks and divide that out to determine the number of pads they would have gone through.  This car is driving mostly on the highway and therefore not using the breaks as much as a daily-driver over the course of 300k miles and 15 years."

Their accounting for maintenance cost is not reasonable.  "

"Your big paragraph is hard to read, but i think i see some numbers in there.  Bottom line, you are mentioning transmissions, brakes, and oil, then spending a big chunk of money on an engine rebuild, for no other reason than to be absurd.

BMW has all that covered under [BMW Ultimate Care+](https://bmwusaservice.com/ultimatecare), available for a 2017 7 Series, 125k miles and 7 years for only $4,549 ($0.0364 per mile).

Needing a comparison point, we can [look at Tesla's service plans](https://www.tesla.com/support/maintenance-plans), a Model S gets 50k miles and 4 years for $2,325 ($0.0465 per mile).

Tesloop said their standard maintenance was $6,900 over these 300k miles ($0.023 per mile). 

I have stated multiple times that Fleet vehicles need less service than a typical daily driver and it appears that Tesloop agrees.  They have serviced their vehicle for nearly half the cost as the service plan.  Imagine what a BMW fleet car may be capable of then.

To sum up:

* Tesloop gets free energy.  This is awesome for them, but not an intrinsic benefit of EVs, just the super good deal they are getting right now from Tesla and which they could turn off at any time.
* Tesloop is spending $6,900 on maintenance
* an equivalent ICE would spend that $36k in fuel.
* and have maintenance costs of around (but possibly less than) $11k."

"Probably less profitable than the other cars they produce. That's why they don't advertise it too much, because they'd rather sell a ICE car with a bigger margin. 

EVs still can't compete with ICEs on their own, mainly due to battery cost, especially when it comes to small cars. No matter what else is in the car, you still need to pay a substantial amount of money for the battery, so to compete with ICEs the manufacturers have to either save money elsewhere or accept lower margins. The problem is that small cars already have extremly tight margins and there's only so much you can save on interior without damaging the company's image. That's why most manufacturers plan their long range electric models for 2020+ - it's not because of technical challenges in developing an electric drivetrain but rather because it's just not economically viable just yet.

Tesla is burning enormous amounts of cash  *despite* selling a 50000 dollar car for 90000 dollar - what they get in return is a head start in a market that is just about to get big. If this gamble pays off and everything works out as planned they'll be the first company in ages to compete with the traditional auto manufacturers, which itself is impressive."

"after cars like the Bolt/3 sell around $20K without federal incentives.  

There are a few greenies out there that want to buy EVs under some pretense that they help the environment (studies show otherwise), but the vast majority of consumers will buy EVs only when they are cheaper/better than ICE vehicles.  Right now a base 3 is comparable to a mid-level Chevy Cruze both in terms of size and interior appointments.  Heck, a diesel Cruze gets 52mpg and starts under $25K.  That gives it a range of over 700 miles at a price $10K less than a 3 and diesel ""charging stations"" are everywhere around the world.   You really need the long-range version of the 3 (currently starts at $44K) to base low to mid $20Ks before you'll see mass adoption."

It's not really fair to compare that to a car that makes less performance to start then put shitty gas in to cut it even further. The cars in the class of a Tesla for ride comfort / size mostly use premium (MB, Audi etc), and especially if they're anywhere near the same performance.

That being said tesla is coming for cars like the 3 series and A4.

This entire study is crap, how much of the general population drives a car for 300k miles? I want to see total cost to own for the first 5 years of a model 3.

"Let's see, if you go by manufacturer's recommendations on the ICE but not the Tesla:  shocks every 60k miles, spark plugs, wires, timing chain, water pump every 100k or so. Brakes much more often than a Tesla. But probably less on tires.

That's 5 sets of shocks (front and rear) at probably $1500 for all four installed on a BMW. $7500, plus about $1000 per 100k, that's $10,500. $100/oil change is more reasonable for an expensive car, at 5k per change is $6k, so we're at 16,500.

So conservatively like 20-25k if nothing significant breaks. Hope to God you don't spin a bearing or have to rebuild a transmission or something.

Yeah I have no idea where they got $60k+ either."
"Maybe they're factoring in the cost of buying a new car every 100,000 miles ;-)"

"Just for funsies: =)

TL;DR: MS now closer to aggregate E-segment on size proximity basis due to competitor size inflation; it's closest to E/F straddler $70k base premium sedans rather than clearly E-segment^[1]; F-segment comparison still not w/o merit since it technically falls under F-segment (depending on various established metrics.); E-segment grouping works well w/ new CA rebate legislation.

Model S is a segment straddler and is more akin to SWB F-segment vehicles (more popular in EU) and stretched E/F straddling vehicles (BMW 6GC, MB CLS, Audi A/S7 which share E-segment internals but are near F-segment due to cost of entry, premium status, weight, 4doors, and footprint.  MS overlaps some SWB F-segment but exceeds the E/F since MS arguably kerned the balance toward F-segment (mildly) whereas competitors kerned toward E-segment (mildly.)  This is not surprising since (per Elon biography IIRC) Mercedes CLS skeleton with ICE ripped out, chassis lengthened four inches, and BEV components stuffed in was used as an original Model S mockup to demo to Daimler reps (they also swapped out some A-class vehicles IINM.)

Furthermore, E-segment size inflation has resulted in Tesla Model-S relative drift toward E-segment vehicles, but size metrics put it as technical F-segment (EPA: >=120cf; HLDI: >101sqft@ >4000 lbs; FCAI: >[102.26sqft|>9.501sqm] + >$100k AUD base; [GoodCarBadCar](estimated): >= $68k USD base + HLDI metric) Tesla Model S is 4647.3lbs & 105.2sqft (195.9"" \* 77.3"" /144)

MS is shorter than LWB F-segment vehicles but has comparable footprint (used by IIHS and FCAI standards bodies), weight(IIHS again) and interior room (EPA metric^[2]) depending on the F-segment model compared (Lexus LS SWB for example) and F-segment cutoff base-cost-of-entry (which starts at ~$70k USD GoodCarBadCar and $100k AUD FCAI.)

(A8 SWB was 115 cf vs. MS @120cf excluding 5cf MS frunk, and interior legroom was w/in inches of MS and 107.5sqft vs 105sqft footprint; A8 LWB is larger @ 122cf and 110sqft footprint; all the LWB chauffeur biased vehicles have naturally longer legroom .)

E-segment is more flattering of MS dimensional specs, juxtaposes it with higher unit growth ceiling, and positions it to qualify for new CA EV legislation credit (which is based on the car's 'premium' over ['equivalent'] ICE.)

_____

[1] FCAI size (http://www.fcai.com.au/sales/segmentation-criteria) + pricing (http://www.caradvice.com.au/511197/2016-vfacts-wrap-new-sales-record-set-winners-and-losers-detailed/); [E-segment is 'Large'(9.001-9.500sqm) >=$70k AUD; F-seg is 'Upper Large'(>9.501sqm) >=$100k AUD]

HLDI: ""Large"" (~E-segment est. >=45k USD) is: [91-100sqft @ >=3501lbs] or [101-110sqft @ 3001-4000lbs]) (http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/vehicle-size-and-weight/fatalityfacts/passenger-vehicles).  ""Very Large"" (~F-segment est. @ >=$~68k USD) is: [101-110sqft @>=4001lbs] or >110sqft.

F-segment prices uses lowest GoodCarBadCar Genesis G90 vehicle as baseline ($68k) = ~85% x $100k AUD -> USD. (http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2017/01/usa-december-2016-large-luxury-car-sales-stats.html)

E-segment if priced in same manner to $70k AUD w/ same conversion as above would be ~$47k USD which lines up pretty well w/ {Audi A6, BMW 5, Jag. XF, Lexus GS, Infiniti Q70, Cadillac CTS, Volvo S90, w/ MB E-Class & Acura RLX at high end} base msrp and in the just under <4000lb or very near 4000lb range.

Lexus ES, and Acura TLX skew #s below the ~$47k point as low at $39k USD.
 
[2] Tesla also excluded frunk from storage measure.  (1) I think they were intentionally aiming for segment straddler status and too much storage would have bumped it too high and (2) frunk storage at least on MS cannot be locked so it's got caveats.

\* The standards bodies exercise discretion as they please, so this is more an arbitrary academic discussion than anything and is more about public and media perception and standards/comparison creep/change.

BMW 6er GC is often considered large luxury car (footprint; sedan; entry price; branding) so it's hardly a surprise to see Model S (a larger vehicle) considered in the upper strata likewise because MS was a copy of Panamera which was considered in GCBC ""Large Luxury Vehicle"" category where MS was a very close dimensional analog of it on initial release:
 
(https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/31805.shtml) Panamera '12 (195.7""x76.0"") ('09-'16) 123cf-124cf.
(https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/38525.shtml) Model S (195.9""x77.3"") 120+6cf.

Lexus LS (SWB & LWB) & Audi A8 (SWB) were also EPA mid-size; LS (SWB) smaller footprint & LS(LWB) at comparable footprint.  

Consumer reports still classifies Model S in exclusive ""ultra luxury"" class shared by S-Class/A8/XJ/7er/LS/G90/Quattroporte/FlyingSpur .

Car & Driver likewise categorize Model S along side S-Class, 7-series, and A8 (http://www.caranddriver.com/features/2014-editors-choice-the-best-cars-trucks-crossovers-and-more-awards)

Motor Trend puts Model S under mid-size luxury car (http://www.motortrend.com/class/hybridelectric/) but G80 at near identical dimensions at full-size luxury.  My WAG is Motortrend perhaps works with the manufacturers a little on how the manufacturer would like to position the car (within sane boundaries) since I'm assuming they're all have a mutualistic, amicable/friendly relationship."
"Tires yes, but brakes can extraordinarily long on EVs with regen (e.g. on Prius at 200k mi you can have 85% pads still remaining (https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/how-long-do-brake-pads-last.64161/) )"

I also want to see the average lifespan. Somebody told me that a Tesla is likely to last you longer without repairs getting too insane. 
"$16,500 is a good estimate on total mainteance costs sticking to the manufacturer recommendations.  Given that it is a highway car, i think many of those could be stretched out.  I actually took a look at the [pre-paid maintenance plan cost/mile](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6wysxp/ac/dmchmyc/?st=j6zqsfyz&sh=89996c63) for each vs. what Tesloop reported and they are spending very low on maintenance, so they must be stretching it out as well.

"Because all construction services do, and the grid is a giant construction project that needs regular maintenance. Like housing construction costs, car prices, etc. it all depends on skilled labor and raw materials, which all go up with at least inflation. "
I wish but its not practical for me right now since I'm house hacking a duplex. I hope to install solar in my next home.

It would be ridiculous to judge the cost per mile based on the miles driven by an outlier vehicle.  JUST AS IT IS IN THIS CASE WITH TESLOOP. "
"You're the one that's not paying attention.  The cost-to-own numbers are simply not applicable at all for fleet vehicles.

Look at the breakdowns.  It includes maintenance, repairs, utilization of customer warranty, limited mileage, depreciation, financing, insurance -- none of those things are going to be remotely similar in a fleet vehicle as they are in a customer vehicle."
"Again. That's an AVERAGE. Cars depreciate both as you drive them and as they age. So the per mile depreciation of a household Prius will be much higher than one used as a taxi or a TaaS. 

There are tons of Camries on the road that have ~400,000 miles on them because their owner drove a lot. "
"> Prius [...] has an average operating and maintenance cost of $0.40/mile

False. That's total cost of ownership."
"Believe it or not - Tesla is not the only company doing battery research that drives prices down. It's not Tesla that's making it profitable (although they may have a part in it), it's technological improvement in general. Tesla is not creating a market, they're entering a developing market ahead of the curve (which probably *does* speed up EV adoption, I'm not even contesting that).

I'm also not criticizing Tesla for it, I was merely answering the question why other manufacturers have a 2020+ timeline rather than selling more EVs right now: because it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for them to lose money on it right now, while it does make sense for Tesla just for the opportunity to break into the car manufacturing market.

I'm just trying to counter the ridiculous talking points of *some* hardcore fans that pretty much declare other manufacturers as incompetent and basically dying if they don't switch to EV production *right now*. I'm glad Tesla found it's niche so far (not traditional car people, often tech-y, willing to spend a bit more for newer tech while compromising on other parts), in the end healthy competition is good for the customer."
They also have a massive revenue stream coming from hybrid and traditional ICE sales to support their capital venture into electrics. 
"That will be the big argument to come.  Were EV's inevitable, or did Tesla force the issue.  

My $0.02:  I think Tesla may have sped things up, but not by decades.  Maybe a few years at best.     

The Leaf came out in 2010, 2 years before the S.  The i3 came out in 2013, shortly after the S.  That means it was already nearing final development when the S first came out.  The Mitsubishi i-MiEV came out back in 2009.  Then of course you have all the hybrids like the Prius that came out way back in 1997 or the Volt that came out in 2010.  

The pivot to EVs was already underway.  Tesla made EVs aspirational with $100K+ vehicles for sure, but the industry has been around since way back in the mid 90's with the EV-1 and RAV4 EV.  The issue has always been, and continues even today to be the price of batteries.  In that respect, Tesla is just using Panasonic as a supplier.  They certainly haven't made any breakthroughs there.  The price of batteries still needs to be cut in half before these become mainstream and Tesla is not pushing that metric down despite all the hype over the gigafactory."
"I think what is happening right now is that traditional manufacturers are not convinced that the mass market is ready for electric cars, so they aren't investing too much into it. If the model 3 is a success and the market is big enough, then other manufacturers will definitely take notice and throw lots of money at it. 

Right now we have a few affordable BEV in the 200-250 mile range, and there is nowhere near enough demand to make them on the scale that Musk wants to make the 3 on. If the demand is actually there (using sales numbers, not $1k refundable deposits), then Tesla will face competition like it never has before."
"I know financial disclosures and reporting are seen as ""fake news"" around here.

But lets follow through on this.  Most, bears and bulls, agree that Tesla is going to run out of money again sometime around Q1 of next year.  Institutional appetite for more equity offerings has plummeted.  The bonds they just offered have tanked making any further debt offerings expensive.  So where do you see the next round of financing coming from?  How do you think they are going to make it through 2018 hemorrhaging cash once the free-money faucet has turned off?  The company is a dead man walking at this point."

Please read the context. This is about staying at the supercharger AFTER your car is finished charging
"The problem is the death spiral. As the grid become more expensive to be connected to, it incentivizes people further to move off the grid using their own storage. As more people move off the grid, the grid costs have to be distributed over fewer users, causing additional users to go off the grid. If the grid wants to remain relevant it will have to lower its costs or the remaining users will need to become accustomed to much higher charges. "
Do you not understand that autonomous EV networks are going utilize customer owned vehicles? Tesla is not going to own the fleet of cars that first encompasses the initial Tesla Network. Fleet owned networks will not be able to compete with customer-owned networks . They are essentially dead in the cradle.

Bob Lutz kept asking his team at GM why they couldn't do it and they said the batteries weren't good enough. He pointed them to the Roadster and they said ""hmm, well maybe we can do something"", and the Volt came out of that. "
"This is a common argument that basically says traditional OEMs are choosing a ""fast follower"" strategy to avoid risk and stay profitable. The problem is, autonomous BEVs are not a mature technology nor a core competency for any traditional OEM. Especially in systems that involve a lot of software, you can't just throw money at new technology and expect to pivot successfully to a marketable solution and also remain competitive. We have seen this exact same scenario play out dozens of other times in other industries. The exact same arguments were raised for Kodak, Blockbuster, Nokia, Blackberry, Myspace, AOL, etc etc. People assert that vehicle manufacturing and cars are somehow not technologies and are immune to the same level of disruption faced by these other industries.

I lose my patience so quickly with this argument because it willfully ignores the dozens of examples of history that prove it isn't true. People with virtually no experience with business or technology or engineering development blindy nod their heads and agree to it because it's easy to understand. But the truth of the matter is that OEMs are very clearly and obviously facing a significant existential threat and most of them will not stay solvent induring this transition. They absolutely are **not** just choosing a fast follower strategy. They are sincerely incapable of adapting and they will be disrupted, just as other industries were. This truth will become vividly clear to people over the next 24 months when demand for EVs sky rockets and traditional OEMs (all except VW affiliates) do almost nothing to respond."

"The pricing for consumer owned daily drivers is different from fleet vehicles.  It is not different because it is owned by a consumer, it is because a fleet vehicle is used and experiences costs in a much different way.

You are posting data, which is good, but it is the wrong data.  $0.40 is not applicable to this situation.  When you force it into the argument as 'look data, everyone else is wrong' you are behaving irrationally.  "
"I understand that you want data, but most private companies will not open up their books like that.

Just thinking logically about how costs are incurred when operating a vehicle, do you not see the obvious difference between the long hall 150k miles a year and daily-driver 15k miles per year?

"Somehow the industry got hybrids off the ground without Tesla, the idea that Tesla is the sole reason companies are pursuing new engine technologies right now is a bit silly. There would be concerns about oil and climate change in the market pushing this development even without Tesla. Tesla really isn't even a blip of a competitor to these companies financially speaking today. Their sales are measly. 

You're also forgetting the rise of renewables and fall of coal. Electrics really weren't a good sell when people knew they would be coal powered. The grid becoming cleaner is a big reason why it's spurred development. "
"Not only that, Tesla proved electric vehicles can be desirable and not something only environmentalist who are willing compromise on style and performance want. Tesla made them sexy while out performing some of the best ICE cars available. "
">The problem is, autonomous BEVs are not a mature technology nor a core competency for any traditional OEM

So what? We have seen manufacturers make electric cars in the model 3 price range, and we have seen some impressive self driving tech from other manufacturers also. While Tesla's self driving software may be the most public, it's not the best by a long shot. The difference is that other manufacturers are going to release their stuff when it's finished.

>you can't just throw money at new technology and expect to pivot successfully to a marketable solution and also remain competitive

Tesla and the model 3 have competitors today! You don't have to match every single feature to be competitive. We have also seen that other manufacturers are well into developing BEV and self driving vehicles.

>We have seen this exact same scenario play out dozens of other times in other industries

We have also seen competitors succeed. Think of Uber and Lyft, Lyft wasn't really a thing until Uber showed up and proved ride sharing is profitable. Or how about Google creating Android to compete with Apple's iphones? Also, you are literally comparing apples to oranges trying to compare a video service to a car manufacturer. Each industry is different and has its own rules and challenges.

>I lose my patience so quickly with this argument because it willfully ignores the dozens of examples of history that prove it isn't true

It's not ignoring, its realizing that there are failures and there are success stories, and that each market is unique and you can't just compare them against each other. Also, there are examples of competitors succeeding in times of drastic market change.

> But the truth of the matter is that OEMs are very clearly and obviously facing a significant existential threat and most of them will not stay solvent induring this transition

Did you forget about all the other self driving systems being made and the other BEVs that you can buy today? Since other OEMs are making electric cars and self driving software, Im sure they can figure out how to put the two together. Do you think Google will never succeed with their self driving car tech because they don't know how to make cars? I think you are underestimating what other car manufacturers can do.

> They absolutely are not just choosing a fast follower strategy. They are sincerely incapable of adapting and they will be disrupted, just as other industries were

It sounds like you are saying Tesla will be the only vehicle manufacturer because they are going to put every other car maker out of business and no other competition will ever be able to catch up? Ford was once in a similar situation when they invented the production line, completely revolutionizing the whole car industry. They made cars cheaper and faster than anyone else and quickly dominated the market. Surprisingly enough, other manufacturers did exactly what you think they can't do: They adapted, survived, and still compete today.

>This truth will become vividly clear to people over the next 24 months when demand for EVs sky rockets and traditional OEMs (all except VW affiliates) do almost nothing to respond.

OEMs have adapted before to drastic industry changes, they can do it again. It's not like they just sat around and died when Ford started producing cars with the assembly line. I suspect that **IF** EV demand increases drastically, they will adapt like they have in the past."
"Can you explain the ""bonds tanking"" part of this argument?  I'm not up on bonds at all, but I thought that Tesla sold $1.8B of them already.  So, largely, them ""tanking"" on the secondary is immaterial to  Tesla's current state, correct?

It *may* make it more difficult to sell future bonds (e.g. higher yield needed), but it's not decreasing the amount of money Tesla has on hand at this point, right?

Also - why would someone buy a bond and then immediately sell it for less than they paid (or is it more than they paid, but less than projected yield if they held it to maturity)?  I guess firesale if you don't think the company is going to be able to pay it back, but then why buy it in the first place?  I feel like there's something obvious I'm missing here.  Thanks for insight."
"I doubt going to that well again will be so easy after what is happening to the bonds just issued. Just for a second, try to pretend that the company we're talking about is not Tesla, but rather Acme Widget Company LLC. If you approach it from that mindset, you will see that Tesla is indeed in a bit of trouble.

I love the company and want them to succeed. I invested at around $33 and sold at around $330, but it really pains me to see people try to pretend that basic business principles don't apply to this company.
"
"$30 for the pair. 

I spent $30.  Is it a mod ricers do. Yeah. But my car is an SUV so no one has tried to race me for pinks. But the light they put out is just so great. The highway signs really pop. So much better than the stock bulbs. 


So aside from your critique I like my head lights. They've been bullet proof for 3 years now. Made driving at night more enjoyable. For just $30. "
Just saying the price probably has a very large margin. That's all I was trying to convey. You know when stuff like a floor mat is $800.

Then we change the laws or use eminent domain to nationalize grid infrastructure.
"Why don't you provide data on the average operational and maintenance costs of fleet owned vehicles, then? You keep insisting they are lower and the insist that you must be right because nobody is taking the time to prove you wrong. And somehow that is a rational argument to you? I am telling you what the average lifespan and costs are for a consumer-owned vehicle. You insist these numbers are higher than for fleet vehicles. Please provide the data so we can continue the discussion and compare it to projected EV costs."
"What exactly is different about a fleet vehicle vs a consumer vehicle that would have any appreciable difference on operations and maintenance costs? Is the cost of gasoline cheaper for fleet vehicles? Is the need for regularly scheduled maintenance (oil changes, filters, spark plugs, etc) somehow different for fleet vehicles than for consumer vehicles?

It seems ridiculous to me for you to expect there to be any appreciable difference between an ICE fleet vehicle and an ICE consumer vehicle when it comes to operating costs and scheduled maintenance. "

Current, yes, but as you noted, they're going to need another Billion or two sometime around Q1 next year and then probably another Billion or two later in the year.  If you haven't paid attention to the Tesla story, they run out of money quite often and either offer up stock or issue debt to keep the lights on.  The last two quarters they have had operational losses around $400 million with the next two expected to be even worse.  Throw on top of that the billions of CapEx they are spending and their cash burn rate is approaching something like a $1.5Billion a quarter.

Whiskey is of the camp that thinks that even though Tesla has never come close to profitability with the S/X, the 3 will suddenly 180 the ship later this year, Tesla will suddenly become cash flow positive, and their will be no need for further capital raises.  I am of the camp that thinks that's preposterous. "

They forgot over the air software update capability. I believe this is the most important spec.
The c300 has a really impressive coefficient of drag. Tesla is better but I didn't expect the MB to be so close.

Now compare interiors
"Not exactly a good comparison. For example, no one is paying MSRP on the BMW or Mercedes..."
"Flawed comparison. The appropriate BMW to compare it to is the 330i/340i, matches up closer to performance and price. Also the 330i and up comes standard with power/memory seats and ""alternative/vegan/fake leather"" which requires premium to get in the model 3. Once you factor in Teslas increased fees for delivery and color etc it gets very similar for similarly equipped models. 320i is a base stripper model that doesn't sell as well as the 330i in the US.  "
Why is there no hp listing for the Tesla?
"There has to be a better way to measure Tesla's MPG than ""100+"". Do something like miles per watt, or megawatt, with total range in parentheses. That way we can compare electricity cost/mile to gas cost/mile. I know it's very favorable to Tesla (that's the whole point of EVs) but ""100+ MPG"" is useless. Even ""N/A"" would be better."
"Isn't the warranty listed a false narrative? Yeah The Model 3's battery gets the 8 yr/100k miles, but the limited warranty for everything else is 4 years/50k."
they forgot to mention that the price of BMW and Mercedes are a bit lower than MSRP
At 35000$ does the Model 3 have any autopilot features? Isnt that like 5000+$ to get the basic one and then another 5k for autonomous?
"They forgot range...

But if you look at the other numbers

- It is faster
- It has more trunk capacity
- It has the most legroom in the front and rear
- Warranty is way better
- Autopilot Safety Features by default

So why even buy the other 2 cars? :-p

"
The new [Audi A4](http://www.caranddriver.com/audi/a4) should also be included. It actually matches the Model 3 with a 0.23 coefficient of drag. The BMW 3 series hasn't been updated since 2011 and is due for a revamp next year. 
"I'm 20 and got a 2017 Ford Fiesta because it was in my price range at the time. As soon as I'm done paying that off and have enough money saved up I'm getting a model 3, it's gunna happen."
"I'm out of town this week in a rental car.  They gave me a Chevy Cruze Premier.  Stickers for right around $25K.

[Exterior if you dont know what one is](http://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2016/06/2016-Chevrolet-Cruze-Premier-front-three-quarter.jpg)

* Thats a leather wrapped dash......

* 8-way Powered AND Heated AND Leather seats

* Heated Leather steering wheel

* Center armrest

* Power adjustable side mirrors

* 14.8 cubic ft trunk

* Slightly more legroom than the 3

* Exterior styling is right on par with the 3 (both are nondescript looking sedans)

* Has a nice entertainment system with Android Auto/Apple Car Play

* Has a mobile app to control the car

* Is a 4GLTE WIFI hotspot

* I've averaged mid to upper 30's mpg giving well over 450 mile range

Size wise, its almost exactly the same as the 3.  As equipped, your looking at $25K for the Chevy vs $50K for the Tesla 3.  This is the kind of comparison the average buyer is going to be making when deciding if they want to stay ICE or go EV.  I bring up the Cruze because I'm in one this week, but I'm sure its the same story with the Corrolla, Civic, ect.

"I don't believe 35,000 will get you autopilot. In mkbhd latest video he claimed +5000 for lanekeeping and other safety features and another 5000 for full autopilot. We will see in the near future what the actual price will be.
 A fully loaded model 3 will be more like 60,000 from what I can gather."
Does the Model 3 trunk capacity include the space in the front?
"The C300 and 320i both average ~26 mpg, and the Model 3 around 4mi/kWh. If you drive 1000 miles a month, That means 'fuel' will cost around $80/mo for the BMW/MB and around $30/mo for the Model 3.

That means lower fuel costs is roughly equivalent to ~$3,000 in asking price if you're financing it for 60mo."
"The annoying thing is the notion that the Tesla Model 3 has to be the best at everything... 

The Germans, British, and Japanese all have different goals in mind with their cars.

Audi tends to prioritize standard features, doing outstandingly well compared to anyone else, but at the expense of FWD and mediocre 0-60 (looking at the base A4 and A6). 

BMW can get you into a RWD luxury car for less than other brands and includes complimentary maintenance your first 3 years/36,000 miles, but with mediocre standard features. 

Lexus sits in the middle as far as standard features, but they have legendary reliability and low maintenance costs. 

Jaguar offers diesel variants (for those interested in range) and delivers a 5 year/60,000 mile warranty. 

Every brand has its advantages and disadvantages, however, and Tesla is no exception. The standard features don't match with Audi, the reliability doesn't seem comparable to Lexus, the warranty period isn't as long as Jaguar, and the first three years of maintenance is included with BMW. 

Yes I pointed out the strongest points of other brands, but that's the point--other automakers are doing certain things better than Tesla. Tesla is amazing at certain things, but not at everything. "
I'd rather make a road trip or long commute in an BMW or a MB over the Tesla. 
"Taken from Bloomberg's recent article on the Model 3.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-29/tesla-s-model-3-arrives-with-a-surprise-310-mile-range"
"I think ""Cost to drive 100 miles"" and ""maintenance costs estimates"" should also be included.

Cost of Oil Changes

Cost of Brake Jobs

etc... "
"The Tesla isn't necessarily a luxury sedan as it's a very minimalistic version of the S, which is their flagship luxury sedan. Unfair to compare it to these luxury brands (as cars in the 40k price range are mainly luxury). There's obviously a premium to pay with autopilot and being fully electric compared to a nice luxury car such as the C class. No one can deny those type of cars are nonetheless nice and premium as well. (lol downvotes coming from people thinking I'm a Tesla hater when I'm a shareholder. I absolutely love Tesla and Elon)"
I know this is going to sound fanboy but... I wonder if the drag numbers on the Mercedes are accurate

"Still I believe it competes more-inline with the 328i, being as the 320i is an outlier in the class. "
"Damn it is looking really good now, it seems like people were just thrown off by the poor presentation (like me). "
"They should be comparing it against a 328, not a 320.  They sell a lost more 328s than they do 320s or 325s.  That's really the BMW entry-level model.

Can't wait to here how it drives."
Who gives a shit about software nerd stuff. That things faaast
Those wheels on the Model 3 are sexy 
So what is the horsepower?
[deleted]
Why doesn't it have horsepower when wattage has a conversion ratio for HP?
This entire chart is useless. Go onto the website and see what you get for a $33K BMW and $40K Benz.  A 33K BMW 3 is unrealistic.  They need to compare prices of similarly spec'ed versions of all these cars.
"yall are so blind to the fact. 
Why dont you compare the model 3 to a Honda Civic Touring Edition. Its $27k and it literally has more features than these three being shown lmao. "
"Like the rest of that bloomberg article that is clearly biased, you have to take this with a grain of salt.  No mention of options and features included as standard on the other two.  I think BMW autopilot is only about $1000-$2000

I am still waiting for an unbiased review."

"This is how I solved the riddle:

C300 - disgustingly ugly.

BMW 320i - not electric.

Tesla - Tesla."
"Clearly not the thread to state this on, but i don't care about internet points. The BMW and the Mercedes look good. The tesla looks like the model S but with a few too many cheeseburgers"
"Well, I'd still take a five minute fill up at any gas station selling 93 octane than trying to hunt down a plug every 400 miles and waiting however freakishly long that'll take"
"STOP COMPARING THEM! One car is the car of the future, it has hardware capable of driving itself, completely. It has no emissions, meaning it doesn't further worsen global warming. It is the future of fucking cars and I am so sick of people comparing it to BMW's or Mercedes. Just stop, one is saving the environment, the others are not."
I thought if you wanted any other color it was an extra tag on the base price? Or did I hear that incorrectly? 
Why go with the 320i. Seems to me the 328i is a much better and closer comparison to the other 2.
I would buy one of these in an instant... if I could afford it and if I didn't have a rule that I only paid cash for second hand cars... (driving a $50 1994 Ford Ranger). 
Is the $1k referral discount on the model 3 a thing? I vaguely remember this being an option on the model S. something to do with needing a referral code. 
What about range?
Seems like the 3 would be more along the lines of the Mercedes CLA instead. 
Man i wish model 3 is more like 3series. It’s bit ugly but nevertheless good value for money.
"What is the difference in *""fuel economy""* between the S and the Model 3?"
Too bad I won't be able to get one for 3+ years. 
"Where is the comparison between distance you can travel with one charge/waiting time for each km traveled at advertised MPG/""ampere hour per gallon? 
I'm extremely interested in buying one, but those are also important factors to consider. "

I wonder why they didn't exclude Audi A3
What about range?
"The auto pilot is $8,000 extra i believe"
Will I get one for $35k if I place an order today?  I thought the subsidies were going away.
Sold.
Was looking for something like this. Thank you for posting.

"The 100mpg I will not believe. In the lab or on a perfectly flat road okay, but I'm from Scotland and there's not a chance it will manage anything like that. It will run out of battery in the middle of nowhere and you'll need a day to recharge. 

I am all for electric cars! But comparing these is irrelevant i think. Combustion engines are just so much more practical in most of the real world, also if you maintain an engine properly, It can last 20 years easily. The battery probably not.

Good luck to tesla, what they have achieved is unreal, and if I can buy one of their cars that can manage 1000km without charging and can be recharged in 10 minutes I will be sold!"
My c350e is faster :-)
"I really want to buy one. 
But I live in apartment building with no parking lot and no chargers in my neighborhood. 
It's still a ""car for your own house"". Sad. "
My understanding is you don't get autopilot assist for the $35k base price. 
Tax Credit! Mention the Tax Credit!
"The biggest difference (apart from the whole ice versus EV thing) is that you can buy the 320i with a proper 3 pedal manual transmission, which many of us who still enjoy driving vastly prefer.  Bloomberg isn't exactly an automotive enthusiasts magazine, though."
Or you could get a Carger R/T Scat pack...4.5s 0-60. Nice cars inside now a days to
"Let's not forget that the biggest chunk of cost associated with owning any car, but especially a luxury car, has to do with it depreciating a lot over time. Sure, the Bimmer and the Merc are both going to depreciate quite severly, but who's buying used Teslas with 100k miles on them? That consumer does not exist afaik."
"I don't think you get all the options you've heard about for $35K, that's just the base price. No autopilot, for example. For comparable features you're looking closer to $50K.

And superchargers.
"My 2015 BMW gets over the air software updates.  Because I live in an area with truly terrible cellular phone coverage it tends to take 3 or 4 attempts but it does work.  

They do less than the tesla ones of course, but there's less to do.  They're a couple of months behind on the new highway extension and still don't have some newly built subdivisions.  

In that regard android auto and apple car play are key features for future used petrol engine cars, real time traffic, reading text messages, that sort of thing.  Which you just can't get on even Model year 2015 and many 2016 cars, and I suspect the manufacturers who went with their own in house solution (including BMW) are going to regret it.  "
"They forgot a lot off - you should read this article to get it:   
[https://electrek.co/2017/07/31/tesla-model-3-vs-bmw-3-series/](https://electrek.co/2017/07/31/tesla-model-3-vs-bmw-3-series/)   
- Tesla Model 3 is almost $9000 cheaper at the same feature level as BMW 3.   
.    
UPD. BMW 3 Series doesn't have power-adjustable seats & as well as the steering wheel at the even not a base (but comparable with $35k Model 3) config too. Also BMW 3 Series doesn't have Cold Weather Package in the base too. And so +- in every freakin entry level luxury car in its class."
BMW has OTA
"Not to restate, but they left out a ton of ""features"" like heated seats, power mirrors, windows, seats, and tons more. You could pick any 10 things and make one look much better than others."
"Who cares about updates for infotainment... They should find a way to OTA update the AP like technologies like ""distronic plus"" or whatever, otherwise they will become obsolete. Dealers should agree this update scope extension."
Along with supercharger access.
"God damn, German auto makers warranties suck.  "
My Hyundai can do that. It's not a huge deal 
Also forgot to include number of options.....  Some people don't want a black car.  Having only black as a base color is very disappointing.
"And federal/state incentives. While temporary, its a significant amount of money for anyone getting their model 3s in the next year"
Yeah no. A car that can only be connected to with a wire is a lot harder to hack than one with integrated wifi.
"Its even more impressive if you look at a Prius having the same drag and them telling you it has to look that fucked up to get it.

http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/2017-toyota-prius-liftback-sept16.htm

I hate the Prius."
"Car and Driver did an aero drag test a few years ago, its an interesting read if you'd like to learn more about car aerodynamics. In that test, the Mercedes CLA performed worse than the manufacturers claim by a good amount. Wind tunnel tests are not accurate to compare across different wind tunnels, so the manufacturer specs are not a good tool for comparison. 

http://www.caranddriver.com/features/drag-queens-aerodynamics-compared-comparison-test"
"Googling the C300 drag coeffcient also returns values 0.24 - 0.26, so not sure which source should be trusted.

Also, actual drag and therefore the car's efficiency is a function of both the coefficient and the surface area of the vehicle."
It's impressive because it's false.  The real coefficient is much higher.
I was also surprised. Especially given the huge blunt grille on the front! I thought that think would be like a brick wall when trying to push forward.
"There's a lot of variability between wind tunnels and ususally you can't compare drag (or lift) numbers between two tunnels without a significant correlation study.  From historical ones I have seen MB tends to under report pretty heavily, on the order of 50 counts in Cd (0.050).  That would put them around the BMW which would be expected.  Also there's a lot of variability in content, a C180 is generally a lot lower than a C350 due to tires and aerodynamic shielding.  Tesla does well in this regard with flat underbodies."
No kidding. I wonder if retracting handles really buys that much lol.
"Never compare drag coefficients unless the numbers come from an independent tester, measured in the same wind tunnel. Manufacturer numbers and measurements in different wind tunnels have a lot of variation. 

Not applicable here, but also be careful about comparing drag coefficients across different vehicle classes. Manufacturers have different downforce targets for certain vehicles, which will significantly impact drag."
Mercedes have a really good Aerodynamics department and a lot of their research and advancements come directly from their F1 division. 
I was just wondering if  that was right-- I was on the Tesla site before coming here and I had read 4 year/50k.  I assumed it included everything but the battery.
"The S/X pages call it a ""Battery and Drive Unit Limited Warranty"" specifically, seems to be a bit of a reach that Tesla simple forgot to include the ""and Drive Unit"" language for the 3, so I'd conclude it's just the battery covered."
"California has a longer battery warranty mandate of 10 years/ 150k miles on partially zero emissions vehicles 
https://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/warranty.pdf
Not sure if this would apply to fully electric vehicles though "
"Yeah, I was genuinely surprised that the battery doesn't make a difference here, when it makes such a drastic difference with other EVs. And the Model 3 isn't even built with an aluminium body.

What are BMW and Mercedes making theirs out of, lead? :D"

"Thanks for putting all the effort into this. I think it's a bit more fair because it includes the range of each on a full charge. Given that only a portion of car owners park near outlets, I think it's incredibly relevant. I don't have infrastructure for it without spending thousands and so range is a real concern. As EV's increase in range, I can make them work without having charging infrastructure, but until then, I'm likely stuck to an ICE. I'm not the only one in this situation either."
"Awesome, thanks for including range. Seems kinda dishonest (at the very least, incomplete) that it was omitted from their comparison."
"Incidentally you may want to contemplate adding the misc. cost options Tesla has bundled.  GPS is included whereas it's a $$ option on BMW (and Tesla includes lifetime upgrades) whereas there's a service fee on BMW (no idea on cost off-hand); same with rear-backup camera.  Automatic Emergency Braking is included by default on Tesla whereas it often requires added options on competitors (at least with Volvo) which sometimes only support ""low-speed"" automatic emergency braking.  Or premium charge on larger rim wheels on BMW that are included by Tesla.

Of course there are likely options bundled by competitors that you have to pay extra for on Tesla.

If you want to go nuts you can include dealer discount on competitors (slightly offset on occasion by Tesla {display & loaner model & post-model-update} discounts); lifetime gas savings (avg. 13.5k mi/yr 93mo avg. car ownership $2.90 - $2 / gal non-premium gas stateside; 13c/kWh electricity) --savings avg. $3.5k to $7.7k IIRC; charger costs (w/ & w/o rebates?).  Not to mention state and/or federal rebates which can be substantial nor power company rebates and ToU (time of use) nighttime discount rates."

[1] Jaguar XE (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_XE) is 72.8"" width not 77.4"" width.  Please double confirm if you'd be so kind. =D  The manufacturer page lists 1967mm (~77.4"")(https://www.jaguar.com/jaguar-range/xe/pricing-specs/index.html) so there seems to be disparity.  ~~I am at a loss to explain...~~ seems like the larger value is advertised in error.

The XJ (much bigger) is only 74.8"" wide (http://www.caranddriver.com/jaguar/xj)

Car and Driver puts Jaguar-XE at 72.8"" width as well (http://www.caranddriver.com/jaguar/xe)

http://www.automobiledimension.com/jaguar-car-dimensions.html Lists Jaguar XE as:

1850mm (= ~72.8 inches) without mirrors

2070mm (= ~81.5"") with mirrors 

I think 77.4"" is a case of erroneous manufacturer web link.  It would make the entry-executive car as wide as the widest upper large luxury cars (e.g. Audi A8 76.7"" & Model S 77.3"" width both without mirrors vs 86"" with mirrors on MS
converting mm to in) (http://www.automobiledimension.com/tesla-car-dimensions.html)

Edit: noted 183.9"" x 72.8"" would yield 93.0ft^2 footprint much lower than the hypothetical 98.8ft^2 if Jaguar were unprecedented (for an entry-level-executive car) 77.4"" wide; Edit2 added missing links for segmentation metrics."
"Where did you get your 0-60 for the A4? According to Motor Trend it's 5.3s. Also it's not a fair comparison showing the MSRP for the car vs Tesla's firm asking price. People typically pay 10-12% less than the MSRP. And for the love of Zeus, don't use the 320i, but rather the 330i. The only reason Bloomberg used the 320 is that they wanted to make Tesla look competitive."
"I'm confused. Are we comparing full electric against plugin hybrids? If so, you could add the Prius Prime.

Can we include the range of 100% electric?"
"Only thing I notice is the drag coefficient for the C300 in the Bloomberg graph is .24 while it's listed here as .30, not sure which is accurate."
"Hrm.  ~~Can you double check the source of your Jaguar #?  I'm seeing 6.6s for the XE 2.5t~~.  See Motor Trend Review (http://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/xe/2017/2017-jaguar-xe-25t-first-test-review/) $34,900 base MSRP 240hp.  ('18 model will have ostensibly 247hp but no review yet.)  Likewise at Motortrend mass comparison (http://www.motortrend.com/cars/alfa-romeo/giulia/2017/alfa-romeo-giulia-bmw-330i-audi-a4-mercedes-benz-c300-cadillac-ats-jaguar-xe-lexus-is-200t-volvo-s60-comparison/)

Edit: update 6.6s likely came from not-available-stateside XE-20t (also 4cyl turbo petrol) that has RWD 0-60mph of '6.7s' in manufacturer brochure vs XE-25t RWD 6.0s 0-60mph in same document (https://www.jaguar.com/Images/Jaguar-XE-Brochure-1X7601815ACSBXBEN01P_tcm76-353753-v2.pdf) "
Compare looks overall
"Yes, but there's no really comprehensive data on WHAT people are paying, or where. MSRP is a known, objective number that cannot be argued against."
"I LOVE how some people think the opportunity to negotiate with your dealer over the price is a benefit. The conventional wisdom is that almost everyone is getting screwed by the dealership. How many buyers are ending up paying for features they don't want or need? Most of them. Are their ""discounts"" enough to make up for it? Probably not. The dealership is a middle man. They make money by squeezing as much money out of the buyer as possible. They're not your friend, trying to help you get the best deal possible. Not by a long shot."
Yes they are. Particularly in metropolitan areas.
BMW 330i with the same feature level as base TM3 will cost [almost $9000 more](https://electrek.co/2017/07/31/tesla-model-3-vs-bmw-3-series/). Or the same - if you need to buy TM3LR. Just said.
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.7877  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/88978)
"It's not *that* much closer. According to Consumer Reports, the 0-60 of the base 330i is 6.9 s. That's only 0.2 seconds faster than the 320i's (as reported by Tesla). Consumer Reports tested a 328i in 2016 and had a 0-60 time of 6.3 seconds, even faster than the 330i.

Edit: For anyone who doesn't go down the chain of comments, the apparent reason why CR reports a slower 0-60 time than other magazines is because they don't use the brake-torque technique to launch the car from a dead stop. If you look at those magazines' 5-60 (rolling start) times, they're similar to the CR 0-60 time. Most people don't use torque-loading in their typical driving which is why CR doesn't use that technique either when measuring a car's 0-60 time. Also, CR uses a very fair technique to measure the 0-60 time for each car with a high degree of accuracy. If they say the 328i was faster than the 330i then it absolutely was (given that they didn't use any racing techniques to launch either car). The only way I can imagine this failing is if there was a problem with their 330i, but I can't find any report of BMW contesting CR's review."
Or the 330e as it is a PHEV.
"Sorry, I'm confused. For the Tesla, do you get leather as standard or vegan as standard?"
"On the other hand, the gas mileage comparison is based on US fuel prices. Gas prices in Europe are much, much higher, so the equivalent would probably be 200+MPG. "
"Curious about that too. It is literally printed on every electric motor I have ever seen. It is how they are rated. It is how you size the wire. N/A is not applicable in this situation. 

It might not translate well against the hp output of a traditional engine, but it's certainly n/a. "
"Probably because the motor is capable of more horsepower than the battery is capable of providing, so the actual HP rating of the motor is somewhat irrelevant.  More interesting would be the maximum current of the battery.  If you want something for comparison though, using curb weight and 5.1s 0-60 it's possible to estimate that the hp that is produced is around 320hp.  It might actually be less due to reduced losses in the electric drive train.

Edit: also, it's likely that Tesla is still determining how far they can safely push the new cells/packs.  It may be that a year from now (or whenever they've gathered enough data) they'll push a software update that allows the car to draw more current from the battery and therefore produce more horsepower.  It already happened for the S."
Because Tesla has not published the power output of the motors.
"The real measure for acceleration should be Torque. 
And for an electric vehicle, this is pretty much infinity regulated by the software that caps it to not burn the tires in the first drive"
"It's tough, because electricity prices can vary so much, and gas prices have a fair amount of variation as well. There are some places where you can get TOU billing and charge overnight at a couple cents per kWh (which makes ""fuel"" cost a fraction less than a cent per mile), and there are other places where you can end up paying 25+ cents/kWh and end up paying more for electricity than you would for gas.

Unfortunately, I think the only way to really compare them is to have a calculator where it figures out what you would personally pay based on your local electricity and gas prices, which doesn't fit a table like this."
"I propose: MpB. Miles to the Buck.

"
"I don't think Tesla has yet to publish the MPGe, but a guess at 100+ is as good as any considering most EVs are around 110 - 120 MPGe."
"It says ""powertrain warranty,"" so as long as the 8 year/100k warranty also covers the motor, it's correct. That remains to be seen, but is likely to be the case."
[deleted]
Cost of gas is way more than electricity
The problems is they can't list a price below MSRP because not everyone will be able to get that price. MSRP is known and published and not an amount that can be argued.
"5k for enhanced. That gets you lane assist, lane change, controlling speed by itself, and auto parallel and perpendicular parking.

FSD is another 3k (on the model s and x), but there are no features currently."

Because in the premium segment there is much more than just these numbers. "
"- You can buy the other 2 today & actually test drive them
- You know their reliability & quality history vs taking a chance on a company's first mass produced car
- If you need service, you can get it serviced quickly
- Has greater range
- Can come with AWD

There are many other reasons as well but the Model 3 isn't a slam dunk car for the price. Once optioned the way most people would like it to be, its going to cost upwards of $45K. If Tesla wants to prove the car is worth that type of money, they need to ensure the cars they sell don't have issues. Judging by the issues that the Model S & X have had at launch & beyond, I would be catiously optimistic about the Model 3"
"> Autopilot Safety Features by default

Wut? Don't you have to pay 5k for the autopilot?"
The 3 interior is going to turn a lot of people off. 
"You wouldn't. You'd buy either the A4 or the 330i, the cars they didn't want to show you because they beat the Model 3 in most categories and options."
">  why even buy the other 2 cars?

Because quality.

Because easy to get parts and service.

Because you don't have to plugin every night.

Because you can lease either one of these cars for less than $500 a month with no cash out of pocket.

Because convenience, especially if you live in a state that doesn't have a Telsa store.

Lots of good reasons, really..."
I guess the people that aren't ready to embrace an electric car. It still isn't feasible for some people. That's the only thing I can think of.
"Range is kind of irrelevant in this comparison- you use electric cars in a completely different way to ICE cars so the way range compares doesn't give you any useful information.

"
Biggest reason right now is that you don't need to be on a waiting list to get one. In a few years though there really won't be a reason. 
Because simply they have HUD.
"Because they have other features that also make them good. Personal opinion on driving feel matters too. The ability to go over bumps and dips and not feel them is something the Model 3 does not have. The small features such as being able to have your high beams on without blinding other cars isn't included either, being able to tell when a stop light is going green, the ability to use gestures for AC,heat, music etc being able to touch the fans to auto position them on your face instead of moving them. A whole lot of comfort features. The list goes on. 

Not saying the Model 3 isn't a great car- it's just you can't say that it outclasses these cars in everything, that it's much better in every way. "
"Just to clarify, that warranty number on the TM3 (8 yr/100k mi) is on the battery. Not the overall car, which is only (4 yr/50k mi). That puts the general warranty right in line with the Mercedes."
Because the c300 looks beautiful.

"Customers routinely pay extra money for engines that are larger and faster. Look at the 3-Series. Even that slow ass girl is quicker than the Cruze and starts at 10K more than even a tricked out Cruze. That's what a premium sedan looks like. Things like leather wrapped dashes is person preference, I personally hate the generic pseudo premium interior of the Cruze.. or it's bigger brothers for that matter.

Buyers are not comparing a Cruze to 3-Series, why would they cross shop to a Tesla?"
"Standard cars with high trim levels are great. They have been my preferred purchase for years, but they are in a different segment than a BMW, Mercedes, Audible or Tesla. 

You don't have to buy the idea, or the cars, but that is the reality of these vehicles. 

A top trim Honda is better equipped for less cost than a low trim Acura but there is still a market for the Acura. 

"
And how does it perform? From what I read the model 3 performs and handles like a european. It is also at a price to compeate with them. 
"> Stickers for right around $25K

And they'll discount them like crazy too. TrueCar says you can take about $3k off the sticker.

I'm *not* saying that the Cruze and a new Model 3 are competitors (they clearly aren't), but I think it's important to point out that the Model 3 has a long way to go before it's going to compete with entry-level ICEs."
"If you notice the comparison, Tesla Model 3 is basically going to be entry level Mercedes and BMW. It is still luxury brand pricing.

This is not a going to be cost effective for people when you compare to Chevy or Toyota"
"The Cruze, Corolla, Civic, crowds aren't the market, those are compact sedans.  This is a full-size non-luxry sedan. That makes its competition the Camry, Altima, Impala, LaCrosse crowd. "
"Your post is full of misinformation.  

The base 2018 A4 0-60 is 7.1 seconds (audiusa.com).  You can grab the upgraded engine trim, starting at $40,500, but even then it's rated at 5.7 seconds (still slower than the Model 3).

The BMW 3 series is notoriously bare bones when it comes to features (compared to other competitors).  Whether you choose the 320i, or the 330i, you will still have to add lights, rear camera/sensors, and the navi for thousands more on top of the base price.

Ironic that you claim they distort the facts, but isn't that exactly what you are doing?"
"But the German cars aren't Teslas.  You just wouldn't understand.

I thought it was 4 years for the car and 8 years for the battery?
It's an options package on the others too. It seems like the 3 is cheaper if you try to add the same options to all of them. 
"If you were going to compare all the available options, the table would have to be way bigger."
BMW and Mercedes charge for driver assist too
"$5,000 for enhanced autopilot which is equivalent to what the Model S has now. $3,000 on top of that to add full self-driving capability when it becomes available."
yes
Yes
"Agreed! I think ownership costs are really poorly presented in all vehicle comparisons.

They should also talk about expected reliability."
"This made me curious... 

I expected maintenance to be less expensive for a Model S compared to ICE, but Tesla offers a 4 year year maintenance plan on the Model S for $2,325. 

Meanwhile, a 4 year plan for the Audi A7 is $820 and BMW includes the first three years of maintenance on new cars, complimentarily. 

I know there's savings in miles driven because of fuel costs, but maintenance is 3 times more expensive than Audi. "
I would think the Model 3 is still an entry-level luxury sedan at $35k. It's definitely not a budget car. 
It's not a version of the S. Different platform.
The first three [google search results](https://www.google.com/search?q=MB+c300+coefficient+of+drag) seem to show different numbers between 0.24 and 0.26.
Active grill shutters and a bigger budget for aerodynamic testing combined with German efficiency
"Yes I am also questioning those numbers, looking at the benz design, just doesn't scream aerodynamic to me....
BMW makes a lot of sense, those cars were never aerodynamic, BMW can't really part from their typical BMW ""Design"". Lately I have been super disappointed with BMW. Their i3 is just a mess of an EV."
The way i look at that presentation is it was a staff handover party that we were invited to watch. Don't expect anything but an indiference sell when they are 500k orders to go. Also maybe they have confidence that the car is good enough to do the talking. we will just have to wait and see.
">They sell a lot more 328s than they do 320s or 325s.

"The only optional thing for the model 3 in this table is autopilot.. Therefore, the given spec with autopilot is no more than $40k"
"Sure, a loaded economy class car will give you the same or more bells and whistles for a lower price than a base trim entry level luxury car. But there's still plenty of people buying the base BMW 3 series, Audi A4, Mercedes C300, Cadillac ATS, etc.  Why do you think that is?"
"You must be referring to the BMW and Mercedes, too, because they easily reach into the 50K range with a few option packages."
"Where does that put the Audi?
"
"How much do you drive before going home?  400 miles is a long drive. At 65 mph, that's over 6 hours driving without stopping. 

So yeah, if your commute to work is 3 hours of driving, then you're in trouble. If it's less than that, you're covered because you go home and fill it up there. The thing is, you need a garage. If you live in a city and park on the street, then this car is a non-starter. Unfortunate as it may be, it's just not practical. 

In short, I need a fucking garage. "
91 not cutting it for you? 
"For the Model 3, you can only get black at the base price.  Metallic grey, blue, silver, white, and red are all a $1,000 upcharge.

For the BMW 3 series, white and black are the base price.  They have 9 versions of metallic paint for a $700 upcharge.

Mercedes also offers white and black standard for the C300.  They have 7 metallic options for $720, a red for $1,080, and a diamond color for $1,515."

"Considering Mercedes separates their cars by size, it'd really be the C class.

Plus the CLA has an incredibly small backseat. "
I'm not sure about that. The insurance is a lot higher and you are losing a lot on features to save on gas. 
I don't believe they've released any specs with regard to kWh/mi for the Model 3.
It would have to be the A4.
"$5,000; $8,000 gets you autopilot + full self driving when available."
"$35k is the base price before federal tax credit, which phases out over time.  If you ordered one today, there's a pretty good chance you'd still get $1,875 worth of the tax credit."
Yes.
The Accord looks to be the bigger car but still similar on the inside to the Model 3.
They’re coming. 
"I think a school bus would be a great market to tap. Busses could charge overnight and again during the school day if necessary. It would eliminate concerns about emissions from busses that are idling for an extended period of time.

Imagine the safety improvements that Tesla could bring? Low center of gravity to minimize rollovers? Cameras everywhere (inside and outside) to help driver see kids? Autopilot safety features? Built-in GPS tracking?"
"Tesla havent qouted official power mumbers yet, and maybe will not. Someone might dyno one at some point, and get some figures."
"All in all the chart isn't really an accurate way to compare these cars. An EV like the 3 and luxury cars are sort of difficult to compare value wise. There's obviously a premium price to pay to get an EV. No hate with the Tesla or EVs though, I adore Tesla and EVs. "
I don't think you can get a new manual in the US.
"You know I was this close to getting that, but if you look at Charger forums there is a lot of talk about quality of these machines and how it's sub par in the recent years. Even consumer reports had few points on long term ownership issues with this one or something of that sorts. "
It's 30% more expensive and slower. Some people care about that.
Technically speaking the other two could get better over time you'd just have to take them to the dealer for updates. Massive gap in convenience.

This is absolutely the thing that will have need buying a Tesla.  No more cars that fail to improve after purchase.
"BMW does actually get software updates but I still don't know what for. 
It's also not $33,500 .. mine cost about $44,000"
"For a lot of people, a <5min refill for 1000km is the bonus."
"Yeah, Fred forgot range, but if you need it you still can buy Long Range, that for $44,000 vs $43,950 for BMW 330i even without tax rebates is a great deal because of ~$1000 savings only (don't forget about oil, fuel and oil filters, etc & also warranty stuff & FSD capability in a base in the future) on gasoline and this is true for every year of use, so about $15000 for the car's lifetime."
"> BMW 3 series doesn’t have power-adjustable seats

I haven’t driven a current model year Bmw in over a year, but before that it was 10+ different bmws every day.   I’ve never been in a modern (2000-present) Bmw that didn’t have power seats. My dads 1995 5 series has them and it’s pretty base. 

EDIT: not that I would take a Bmw over a Tesla, or that bmws are better, just pointing that out

EDIT2: forgot about coupes, need to be able to slide those seats to get into the back. Oops"
Can you elaborate? What can it do? Improving BMW autopilot and infotainment console? Is the car connected to wifi or has a dedicated data line?
"A large part of the Prius' design is branding. If you see a Prius, you know what it is immediately, and it makes a statement. Sure, it doesn't look great, but it's much more valuable to Toyota to look distinctive. "
"Nissan claims they couldn't eliminate the wind noise without making the LEAF look weird, so yeah, that's fucked up."
"I've been a Prius owner for the last 7 years and as much as I hate the thing it's been incredibly reliable to the point where I've only done changes for the first 150 thousand miles and one brake change at 100,000 MI. I probably shoot for a model 3 once it's easily available but for now the Prius gets the job done well"
"Dat bubble....
As a tall person I've been loving the big bubble top for the last 8 years of driving.  The new Gen3 lights though...they look fucking ridiculous.

"IIRC, there was discussion that Euro drag. tests were allegedly commonly done with oddball mods permitted like taped seams and mirrors omitted.  Mercedes omits dynamic louvers on US models and tested well in excess of their advertised spec. (0.30 Cd measures vs 0.23 claimed|advertised) before (http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-s-wins-wind-tunnel-wars-2014-5) so I'd be wary of any Mercedes spec unless it's in a wind tunnel on an un-modified stateside retail vehicle.

It's all the buttons and switches weighing things down.
They're built like panzer tanks to withstand an autobahn crash.
"They've made some improvements to the battery chemistry to reduce weight. Once the new cells make their way into the other Tesla EVs, you can expect their weight to come down too, though that may be a while."
"Lightweighting costs money, not only to design but also to produce.

My guess is that BMW and Mercedes-Benz will earn a lot better margin on their older, heavier platforms selling for $35k than Tesla earns on a base Model 3 selling for $35k."
"Energy source and motors equal each other out:

In EV, motor is like 100kg and energy source (battery) is 900kg.

In ICE, motor is like 400kg, exhaust like 200kg, cooler, pumps and oil like another 300, (all together 900kg), while energy (gas tank) is 100kg

*Note: weights are not to scale, I just wanted to give comparison*"
"Do keep in mind that the curb weight is for the base model. So that means it's lighter because of manual seats with no motors in them, no covered center console, and no glass in the front roof.  Adding in all those features will likely increase the weight by 200 pounds or so.  But Tesla likely saved some weight by getting rid of all those switches and gauges and minimizing the dash size, etc.  Still, I suspect the car is more aluminum than they're letting on lol"
You have to realize they add a lot of features into the car itself. The ability to go over bumps and not feel them probably weighs a ton itself then the other features probably add up too.  
sub 3500 lb curb weight isn't all that heavy.  
"Insulation, and sound dampening is most of the weight of a BMW, I can guarantee it. BMW has been using unibody construction, and aluminum components for over 15 years, newer models are aluminum/magnesium. I can't speak for Mercedes. But BMW's attempts to make their cars quiet and comfortable, by adding sound deadening material, lots of leather, and lots of option, even base models."
Technically Model 3 has way smaller motors and more efficient design than the Model S. BMW and Mercedes don't put in tiny Civic engines and transmissions.
"I think there is a overlap of people who have acces to an outlet and people who can afford a 35,000 $ car."
"I think it makes sense not to include in the comparison since refueling works so differently on electric. The range is only relevant for road trips or extremely long commutes, but otherwise just plug it in each night and you're good."
"It'd be a VERY long list if going into what's standard, and how much the options cost!

My impression after an uncomfortably long time ploughing through all these websites to build the table is that the Model 3's very competitive in terms of its pricing and spec. There are several standard features that are paid options on most rivals, and very little goes the other way (yes guys, most of these cars charge extra for heated or powered seats).

The only extras that really look like rip-offs to me are the pricing for Autopilot, particularly given that the MMI screen is designed for autonomous driving, and maybe the cost of non-black paint."
How much for an actual luxury interior on a model 3 though?
"I'm pretty sure the reason for Jaguar's inflated width figure is because it's for having the wing mirrors *folded*, whereas with every other car it's *not including* the mirrors at all.

Thanks for finding the like-for-like width figure, I'll amend the chart in a minute."
"audiusa.com

The A4 has two engines, the base engine is 7.1 0-60, the upgraded engine available on the $40,500 trim is 5.7 0-60.  Magazine numbers aren't used, since we don't have a comparable magazine number for the Model 3 yet.  Likely it'll also come below Tesla's estimate.

And I have yet to see a comparison where MSRP isn't used.  I mean, what else can you use?  Not everyone can get 5% off MSRP, let alone 12% off!.  Try getting invoice on a 2018 Audi A4 right now, thats only about 6-7% off MSRP.  And you want to use invoice plus 4% off as the comparison price?  GTFO!"
You calimed Bloomber without any reason because my friend even base 330i for $38k doesn't look competitive to the base Tesla Model 3 - but with additional almost $9000 - yes it is:   [https://electrek.co/2017/07/31/tesla-model-3-vs-bmw-3-series/](https://electrek.co/2017/07/31/tesla-model-3-vs-bmw-3-series/)
"No PHEVs there, just comparing it with combustion engined cars in the same size/price class. Could make a separate comparison chart with other EVs, I guess, but my brain's currently melted."
"Well, 0.30 is what it says [on the Mercedes website](https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/vehicles/model/class-C/model-C300W#!layout=/vehicles/model/specs&class=C&model=C300W&waypoint=model-specs), I'm not sure where Bloomberg got 0.24 from. Not sure about the weight either, Mercedes doesn't quote a figure."
"It's very easy to find out. If you can find tons of new cars on eBay or Autotrader under MSRP, then it's pretty straight forward. I bought someone a car recently and did just that. Told the dealer the cars are the same as the one I'm interested in and they are all $X. He said no problem and that's what I paid.

I've done this for low-end and high-end cars."
But there is comprehensive data on what people are paying. Edmunds and to a lesser extent TrueCar both do a great job of collating said data.
"If you suck at haggling then simply use a car buying service. For a few hundred bucks a professional will locate a car with the exact options you want and negotiate a pretty good deal for you. It's extremely quick and easy, all I had to do was show up with a cashier's check."
Who ever said they were? I'm simply stating the fact that you can easily buy cars under MSRP. I had a dealer offer me a car $20K under MSRP the other day without negotiating anything at all.
"I live in LA and you're nuts. Everyone here gets at least $5k off a 3 series, $8k or more off MSRP is common."
A Chicago dealer offer me $20K off a new car the other day without negotiating anything at all.
"Again that's not a fair comparison. The BMW has premium seating and power seats at that price along with power folding mirrors which the model 3 doesn't have. On top of that BMW prices can be haggled at below invoice. Nobody ever pays msrp for the cars. And with lease numbers you can score some seriously great deals as compared to Tesla leases. For BMWs you can find $45k msrp cars for $399 a month with 0 down. Model 3 will never touch that level of pricing as Tesla puts out lower residuals and doesn't discount from msrp, basically you eat all the depreciation. If you get a BMW or benz at a hefty discount from msrp that helps you get great lease rates and eat less of the depreciation sting. Go to leasehackr if you want to learn more. 

I'm not bashing Tesla at all, I love the product. But Tesla can't compete at pure value standpoint other car manufacturers without their tax incentives. If you can pay up, then get a Tesla and enjoy in good health, but from a pure financial perspective there are better values out there. "
Thank you.

Go back to whence you came!

^^Just ^^kidding ^^:)"
"Specs are the only thing known right now, so it's hard to judge anything else. But you're absolutely correct, you can get an accord or Camry with better specs than the model 3 for much cheaper, but that doesnt look as good for stock prices as BMW and Mercedes"
"Just a note on the powertrain: there isn't a whole lot to go wrong with it, although you do seem to be correct on working on it being a pain. The only time I've seen a widespread issue with motors in cars, they replaced them under the warranty rather than repairing the existing parts.

I reckon by the time there are cars old enough to need powertrain maintenance, getting to the motor might be a bigger issue than working on it. "
"I wouldn't trust CR on that number. Official BMW website has it as 5.5 seconds and others have reported real world numbers slightly faster then that. BMW is conservative on 0-60 and horsepower numbers compared to Japanese and other counterparts, and they try to upsell to the higher engine trims and M series cars."
"6.9s? Yeah no.

https://www.0-60specs.com/bmw-330i-0-60-times/

More like 5.4 or 5.5 depending on who you believe."
"Tesla once got in hot water for judging the motors that way, because the battery was limited to less than the sum of the front & rear motor. So the motors could handle X horsepower, but the battery put out slightly less than that. Then they later made changes to the firmware that made the batteries more powerful, so...

There was something slightly similar with the first Model S as well, where 85kwh was measured as like 82kwh, and they've held some of the batteries to software limited charges which might not have made the full battery useful at one point which later becomes useful. 

So I think they're just saying ""we're not going to add a bunch of numbers that aren't relevant to non-engineers, here's what the car can do.""

And really, that's what people should care about when buying a car (though there's something to be said for knowing cost to fill a tank)."
Waiting on an explanation here
I'm pretty sure electric motors don't supply infinite torque...
"Having miles per kWh would be useful, as most people know what they pay for electricity. Can easily be compared to miles per gallon. Alternatively both average wh/km and liters/100 km are available for most cars online. "
"Electricity prices are regulated whereas gas prices are not. You're right, you can pay more than gas, but I've also been to places that charge $6.00 per gallon simply because they're in the middle of the desert. I think it goes both ways and you have to take what ""most"" people would do. Most people are not going to pay $0.30/kWh, nor will they pay $6.00 per gallon of gas."
As the other person who replied to me pointed out: gas and electric prices vary dramatically from place to place. Electric prices can even vary from day to night. To make a true dollar to dollar comparison we need mpg and mpwatt to do the math for ourselves.
IIRC the Model S is generally 90-100 MPGe. 
"This is true, and upon quick inspection, BMW and Mercedes share the same 4 years/50k New Vehicle Warranty. So not sure why they didn't bother including it."
"I don't think it covers the motor, but I hope I'm wrong!"
"Hasn't it been stated that the 8 years is a Battery Warranty? If that's true, battery doesn't encompass the full powertrain (drive units, motors, control hardware), so calling it a ""powertrain warranty"" is misleading.

Per the press kit:
""Vehicle: 4 year, 50,000 mile limited warranty
Battery warranty: 8 year, 100,000 mile (120,000 mile with Long Range Battery)"""

"You have to pay for the Enhanced Autopilot convenience features (the thing that steers for you, adjust speed to traffic, etc.).

Safety features such as automatic emergency braking are standard regardless."
"I just test drove a C300 over the weekend. Since my internet is to actually drive the car and not operate it autonomously (which I do not think will be practical any time soon anyway) the Model 3 interior seems to come up short, and in a big way. "
"Probably. Me, I'm ready for the future. Especially since the 3 is ultimately meant to be an autonomous car. That obviates the need for as many user facing dials and controls. But I can see my wife being annoyed by having to use the touch screen to control airflow. "
Some categories are more important though. The savings on fuel is massive and there's less need for maintenance.
"I agree. A4 has some short comings, but has leather seats, powered seats, heated seats, ambient interior lighting, 10 speaker sound system, sunroof, homelink, autonomous emergency braking, and LED DRLs and Xenon's standard... 

Yes, the A4 is FWD, but a lot of Tesla enthusiasts don't seem to understand what comes standard on some of these luxury cars, like BMW's complimentary three years of maintenance (since Tesla fans think *routine maintenance* is a big downside).  "
"Thank you for a little bit of sanity in this sub.

I hate these comparisons. The German cars are monsters, the Tesla is an electric runabout with an interior that barely rivals a Kia from 6 years ago.

I hate these comparisons.  "
I don't agree with that at all.  I think most of us are interested and we know at some point we will get an electric car but it's just not the time for some of us right now.
"TBH range is kinda important, the only reason I don't have an electric car right now is that I can't drive to my parents house without having to stop somewhere for an hour to charge (fast charges are few and far between where I live).

The best electric car for sale right now leaves me 40 miles short of my parents house while my current car gets me there on half a tank."
"Yeah, but the comparison right now creates the impression that Tesla is a bit better overall, but for many people the Tesla might be a lot worse because of range, charging speed and infrastructure."
"Nah man, I top off my ICE car every night with my personal in-garage gas station."
">  you use electric cars in a completely different way

Completely different? How exactly? If you use an ICE to commute like most people do, how would an EV change this if the commute is within the EV's range? Or if it isn't, if you can charge at the office?"
"Could you explain the completely different way you use an electric car from an gas car? I've been a long time investor and Tesla enthusiast, but I never heard about this. Do tell."
What? I dont think the target market of the Tesla 3 is people who own an array of cars to choose from based on need. People who own one for getting around town arent going to want to go on a road trip ever?
"I disagree, Tesla has a small window (until the rebates run out) to be even remotely competitive with other offerings. That article and graphic are a red herring, because they compare the Model 3 to the weakest offerings from legacy manufacturers rather than the strongest in the price range. If you actually compare features, acceleration and price, the Model 3 is blown out of the water when you don't factor in any kind of rebate."

"Yeah, it's kind of the dirty little secret of the auto industry that a loaded economy class car will give you more bells and whistles for a lower price than a base trim entry level luxury car.  But there's still plenty of people buying the BMW 3 series, Audi A4, Mercedes C300, Cadillac ATS, etc."
I think his point is that mass market penetration requires the Model 3 to attract your typical Cruze customer.
"> Customers routinely pay extra money for engines that are larger and faster

Not as much as you might think. The V6 variant of the Accord accounts for less than 10% of total Accord sales. "
"> Things like leather wrapped dashes is person preference

It is? Is your preference plastic?"
"All we have on the 3 is some quick test drives in hand built, basically pre-production models at a press junket.   We have no idea how it performs at the moment."
"Right, people like to deride the Bolt for being a $18K car sold for $37K when the very same argument applies to the 3.  

There's all these claims that the 3 is a luxury car and should be compared to other up-market cars, but it really doesn't compare any better than the Bolt does.  "
"> those are compact sedans. This is a full-size non-luxry sedan

Not so much.  Look at the numbers, the Cruze has a bigger trunk (the 15 in the chart includes the Frunk) and a bit more leg room front and back. 

The 3 is very much a mid-sized car.  Something full sized like the Impala is much larger in all dimensions.

I'm not sure honestly. 
[Yep](https://electrek.co/2017/07/31/tesla-model-3-vs-bmw-3-series/)
Yeah I've shopped the 3 and S against heaps of cars here in Aus and the maintenance is actually more expensive on the Teslas. 
My total maintenance cost has been $30 for a set of wiper blades. In 44k miles. 
"> It's definitely not a budget car.

In what way? Manual seats, manual side mirrors, no center console? Seriously, in what way is it not a budget car?  "
"Yeah, I didn't say it's budget either. Of course they are a step above the average Camry or Sonata. But the Model 3 doesn't necessarily compare with these established brands though as they still make nice cars for the price as well, like Mercedes's C class. There's a premium to pay with features like being electric and having autonomy. That's undeniable for sure. (And no, I'm not a Tesla hater if anyone is assuming that. They're my favorite brand and I hold a good amount of shares of them along with being a reservation holder. I'm still an unbiased car enthusiast as well.)"
"It's a ""basic version"" of the S made for people who can't afford or don't want the luxury price. Takes some design notes from it. It's trimmed down to make mass production simpler."
It looks pretty aerodynamic to me... just not Prius level 
"Even the first Honda Insight (with the rear wheel panels) had 0.25, so 0.24 on the Benz can't be real, also considering the grille."
"Just the experience of working in the auto industry for more than a decade.  Go to any BMW dealer website or used car website.  Compare the number of 328i in inventory vs 320i models.  You'll see more than twice as many 328i models.

I just checked Long Beach, CA on Car Gurus.  Just over 200 320i models available for sale.  Compared to the over 1,000 328i models for sale."
I feel like a lot of people here are really trying to justify the Model 3. When in reality you're really not get much when it comes to features etc compared to a car in the same price range. 
Edgy. 2nd place.
"If it makes you feel any better, I had to do a lot of part replacement before I could use it. "
I talked him down from $100 :)
Design wise. I forgot to mention. 
"i've heard good things about the 2015-17 revision, nothing but bad before that though.

There's Also the Chevy SS, another high performance 4 door, but that starts at 45 with a V8"
"and in other models the software is usually outsourced and they stop working on it when the car gets out, they might do some minor updates, but nothing major, they move on to the next model. 

The one saving grace could be support of Google and Apple car offerings. They might even do OTA updates."
"Well the other two you can actually hack yourself if you're so inclined and take control of your car, software and features. Not so much with the Tesla. The Tesla is basically the iOS of cars, designed for people who want to be completely hands off and not play around and customize their cars in any way. Which I know is perfect fine with 95% of people out there."
Honda wants to force my parents to bring their 2016 pilot to the dealer and pay for software updates. 
I actually updated the multimedia software on my 2011 335d via USB the other day. 
"But when you go to the dealer they get to maybe up sell you on something else. Or at least make busy work for the labors. Pull car in, plug in port, upload, take car out, wash car, return said car. Oh, you might consider new tires, or how about a hat for the grandkids? "
But their business model doesn't rely on constant updates. There's no incentive. 
Friend had a BMW with navigation. The menu and maps were severely outdated. I went with him for fun to the dealership as he wanted to ask. They said it would cost several hundred to upgrade. To make the already underwhelming interface slightly less shitty 
"I have an older 5 Series Touring. You update the software by downloading and sticking in a USB key. It's not OTA, but it's not 'take to the dealer' either. "
"Well.. in my BMW 5GT there was a software defect in the transmission and they initially wanted to bill me 500Eur for upgrading it. This car was less than a year old mind you. After making quite a fit , they kindly agreed for BMW Germany to take up the tap for the dealer.

So much for easy updates at the dealer"
go to the dealer and get annoyed as fuck by them trying to upsell you on shit. 
That was a 320. Are you sure you dont have a 328 with some options?

"But you need to add another 5k in premium package to the Model 3 to match base equipment for a 330i.

And BMW comes with free 3 years maintenance plan, the price for Model 3's maintenance plan is unknown, but considering Model S has a pretty high maintenance plan cost, Model 3 is unlikely to be cheap.

Oh, and only one of those you can lease for $399/month, and that ain't the Tesla.

"
"Range is huge though.  If you really want a commuter electric, you can get a used nissan leaf for 10k that will work for all your local driving.

Teslas enable long distance trips.  It is ok to point out the 35k base model 3 has no real point(thus still a luxury car for the elite).  You need to add supercharging at a minimum and many people would need the extended battery to make it work for average use, but then the price is way too high for the average person."
"I have a 2016 BMW without power seats. I bought it right off the lot and although I'm pretty surprised it didn't have power seats, it doesn't bother me all that much. "
I had a 1996 and 2002 3 series both with manual seats. To be honest since I'm the only driver and the seat never gets adjusted I'm perfectly fine with manual seats for all my cars. 
"I also have pretty new BMW - not 3 series but based on it X1 (not base model plus some premium stuff included) and it's doesn't have powered seats as well and I'm more than ok with it. I belive this is actual not only for BMW's/Tesla's entry level luxe cars. Again special for you:  
> And so +- in every freakin entry level luxury car in its class.    

Don't confuse base luxe cars with cars from budget brands (chevy, ford, etc.) with their maximum configuration with all the packages and options included with a base entry level luxe cars - because in the base they have almost nothing as you want to be in Model 3 in it's base and so it's works the same for the entry luxury cars as well - despite the difference in price. It's was like that 10 years ago, it's what we have today too. This is just how the market works and makes money - it works by selling options in the first place and it doesn't matter how much the base cost - is $20k or $30k, or whatever. But it's only valid for neighboring classes of cars..."
"It's updates all the software elements within the vehicle, so if you do have lane assist or co pilot then they are updated. It uses the SIM card built into the car and they've been on new models in Europe for just under a year, although not yet activated in every car it's installed in..."
"You are right about that.  Its like the Jeep thing.  They make the most horrible vehicles all around.  Off road and on road.  But they have an image for that rebellious stripper who puts a bumper sticker on her wrangler that says ""when it gets hot I take off my top"".

"There's a difference between distinctive and terrible.

It looks awful. The design is not cohesive. The lines from the headlights droop downwards like a melted dab of butter, the folds along the front fenders jut vertically for absolutely no reason. 

The badge is shoved onto the front of the car like a little beak, the wheels look like something from 1994, the rear end is a total train wreck and literally looks like someone copied and pasted parts from different cars together, then used the 'content aware' autofill to blend them together, sort of. Just... Why make it look so shitty? Why can't it look, you know... decent?!

Improved:  http://i.imgur.com/gZhPLvz.jpg

- First off, the side profile is fine. In fact.... it doesn't quite look like a Prius anymore, it looks more like a traditional sedan. From a design standpoint, that's cool, but from a branding standpoint, I think you're missing some of the identity/DNA of what you've created. Like it or not, the Prius is an iconic car. The profile is unmistakable, to the point where when Honda debuted it's 2nd gen insight, everyone claimed Honda was 'ripping off' the Prius. Do you really want to throw that away? But again, it's not offensive so I'll move on.

- The headlights have been improved, no more dangling melted portions that stick down for no reason. They look more like traditional headlights, albeit a wedge shape.

- The vertical crease on the front fenders has been removed, this cleans up the front end a lot and doesn't make it look so needlessly busy

- The center badge bothers me. Place it in the grill or something, but when it's that far forward it just looks like a nipple.

- The lower grill has been enlarged, upwards. This makes the car appear more aggressive, and less.... weird? Now it has a decent 'face', and yeah, I realize that impact requirements probably mean it can't all be grill, but just cheat and paint whatever actual BUMPER part you need there, black.

- The foglights are no longer shoved in an arbitrary place on the front end, and are now located within the grill like god intended them to be.

- The wheels don't look like 1995 called anymore. I just threw on some VW Austin wheels, because I like them, and it seems like everyone is obsessed with painted/machined rims lately.

Basically, it looks more like a normal car, and less like some LSD-inspired hallucination. Is it the best looking car ever? No, but it sure as hell looks better than what Toyota did.

The prius looks like shit.  The proportions of the headlights and taillights, the round nose with the toyota logo, it just looks like asshole.  

So again, please back up your opinion with constructive criticism instead of just stating an unsupported opinion."
I think its just lazy engineering.  Mercedes is willing to put time into where the other car makers are not.
[deleted]
It's a deliberate choice they make to have them look like that.  I know its hard to find a comfortable car for tall people.  A friend of mine ended up with the Prius V because of its high roof.  He used to drive some F350 and he could not fit.  He told me those trucks are made for short Mexican contractors (a little racists but not entirely wrong).
"They seem to be down for the past 4 years.  The entire Prius family combined not just the one model.

Frontal surface area is the important factor. Cd means nothing unless you factor that in.
"The extra 20,000 mile warranty on the LR is an interesting thing to add given the battery should cycle less than the standard battery. I suppose it'll come in handy for companies, but still seems unusual to me."

"That'll increase the gap between the M3 and S/X as well - those two models will be faster, even if they lose only one or two hundred pounds of the CW."

That is one fat exhaust
"> BMW and Mercedes don't put in tiny Civic engines and transmissions.

They all use turbo i4s in their base models.

It's the body, suspension, and drivetrain that makes the difference. "
"Interestingly enough, the base Civic engine (along with the most high-end one in the Type R) is the same size as the base BMW 3 series engine, 2.0 liter, so at least BMW *does* ""put in tiny Civic engines"""
"Of course there is. There is also an overlap of those without an outlet and people who can afford more than a $35,000 car. The point still stands: There is a segment of the population without access to charging.

Further, isn't the goal to get it to all segments of the population? If so, there's still a lot of work to do to enable that. "
"You're right... you also need a ""time to refuel"" comparison. 1-8 hours depending on amperage vs 3 minutes.

"> It'd be a VERY long list if going into what's standard, and how much the options cost!

Yah... it may be an insanity inducing exercise.  Not necessarily recommended.  XD

> My impression after an uncomfortably long time ploughing through all these websites to build the table is that the Model 3's very competitive in terms of its pricing and spec. There are several standard features that are paid options on most rivals, and very little goes the other way (yes guys, most of these cars charge extra for heated or powered seats).

Indeed.  For example, on Volvo S60 ($34k base) you have to pay $1,670k for GPS Nav; 

BMW you have to pay $1,950 for GPS Nav (https://electrek.co/2017/07/31/tesla-model-3-vs-bmw-3-series/)

Autonomous Safety features are included on base TM3 trim whereas you usually have to upgrade (sometimes heavily) to get it on competitors. (Although that sometimes comes with autosteer equiv. on competitors as well; some don't offer AEB ala carte.)  AEB is $1700 additional on BMW 330i (ibid).

So when I saw that Model 3 came with GPS Nav & AEB stock; I thought that was in some ways a remarkable perk vs other premium brands. (basically a bunch of nice must haves already in a base model {e.g. backup cam., AEB, paid supercharging, GPS Nav}.)^[1]

> The only extras that really look like rip-offs to me are the pricing for Autopilot, particularly given that the MMI screen is designed for autonomous driving, and maybe the cost of non-black paint.

I think paints were a $700 option on BMW according to Electrek IIRC.  

AP has oddball tradeoffs since you get AP safety features in base model.  e.g., Instead of charging [$1.5k park-assist + $1k lane change + 1.5k for AP autocruise & emergency braking on hypothetical competitor^[2] ] , Tesla bundles AP safety ""free"" and charges $4k +($1k for lifelong continuously evolving AP convenience features) for all AP convenience is another way to view it.  It's more in line with their safety centric mindset and conceptually easier to standardize and test for them.

____

[1] Split folding seats, internet access, parking sensors are included too; if so, that's even more ideal; I'm somewhat surprised (perhaps I shouldn't be but I tempered my expectations to begin with ;D ) .

[2] Volvo had price ranges in that ballpark (near $3.5k-$4k and charging for each piecemeal option separately in similar manner with some variations depending on which vehicle starting point was chosen.)  For example:

~$3.5k when starting from ~$34k ($33.950) S60 ""Dynamic"" trim.  [https://www.volvocars.com/us/build/sedan/s60/dynamic/t5/personalize/packs?s=arnr]

~$4k when starting from ~$37k ($36,800) S60 ""Inscription"" trim. {$925 blind spot assist; $1,425 parking assist; $1,500 technology package (Automatic Safety detection/warning/braking + ACC(autopilot-like-cruise-control) )

(https://www.volvocars.com/us/build/sedan/s60/inscription/t5-inscription/personalize/packs?s=aJrl)

Incidentally it costs $800 on-top of $4k for ""Convenience package"": {keyless drive, power-retracting mirrors, homelink, grocery bag holder})

Edit: added TM3 marker to disambiguated base trim reference.

Edit2: quotes sections added to disambiguate what I was referring to when I said ""indeed"".  Volvo S60 example price added."
"I honestly think it's a matter of different tastes for different folks perhaps (for some folks) some vague passing parallels to [rococo](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=rococo+manhattan+penthouse&btnG=Search+Images&gbv=2&tbm=isch&gws_rd=ssl) vs [minimalist](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=luxury+minimalist+manhattan+penthouse&btnG=Search+Images&gbv=2&tbm=isch&gws_rd=ssl) ; Some people will strongly prefer one or both and or loath one or the other (or both.)

"> I'm pretty sure the reason for Jaguar's inflated width figure is because it's for having the wing mirrors *folded*, whereas with every other car it's *not including* the mirrors at all.

Good point.  I can def. imagine you being right on that.

Yah I wish the manufacturers would consistently list:

(A) Width w/o Mirrors

(B) Width mirrors folded

(C) Width mirrors extended

Their stat publications are sometimes needlessly confounding.

And XE (D-segment auto) dimensions on their web page being wide than both XF (194""L x 74.0""W) E-segment car
 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_XF) & XJ (201.7-206.6""L x 74.6""W) F-segment car --the later of two (XF & XJ) being their larger size vehicles.

'17 XJ spec has 82.9in/74.8in ""(inc./exc. mirrors)""(http://www.auto-brochures.com/makes/Jaguar/XJ/Jaguar_US%20XJ_2017.pdf)

"Actually, yes, everyone can get 6% off of the Audi MSRP just by joining their car club. I think BMW has a similar deal. I would use something like the Edmunds TMV, which for example in a car I just quickly spec'd shows an MSRP of 35,850 and an actual cost of 31,667. So that comes out to about 11.6% off of MSRP which is pretty standard. It's the only way to compare apples to apples really."
".24 does seem rather slick, it's a bit concerning if Bloomberg is more or less making up numbers "

"Completely agree, there is no value in a tesla right now, especially since the autonomous driving is nowhere near close to coming out, I will wait 5-10 years and once tesla can compete with my s4, Ill consider switching, for now, I don't even consider it a real car, just a prototype which will eventually be the future, but not quite yet. "
How does the price get that low when leasing and does it also work outside of the US 
"Base BMW3 doesn't have premium seating and power seats as well - this is all the options too & also BMW 3 Series doesn't have Cold Weather Package (w/o buying option). Just go to the official site and found it by yourself.   
P.S. TM3 have power folding mirrors at the base - you get it wrong.    
.  
UPD. About MSRP and other stuff - if you so want to see the WHOLE picture by financial part- you also need to consider tax credits & gas savings for the EV's.  
UPD2. It's will NEVER be fair comparison as long as only Model 3 (even at base hardware) can be over-the-air update to a Full Self Driving capability & can get by time other major software updates for free (or not).  
UPD3. Also you forgot about the warranty period for a car itself and car's hardware - BMW here not even close to Tesla."
"Just between you and me, I don't think a lot of potential Tesla owners are exactly what you'd call 'car people'.;)

Oh I just realized, the Bloomberg graphic is also wrong about the 320i. It's 0-60 is 6.6, not that anyone buys that car, everyone goes for the 330i."
"I made a longer post elsewhere, but I think the difference is for the reason [this guy](https://www.consumerreports.org/luxury-cars/sports-sedan-showdown-bmw-3-series-vs-mercedes-benz-c-class/) posted:

> Those of you challenging CR's performance stats: they don't brake-torque cars like enthusiast magazines do. Check out the enthusiast 5-60 mph figures for more accurate real-world performance--they're right in-line with CR's.

I verified that the 5-60 time reported by other magazines is close to the 0-60 time reported by CR.

I also don't see anything wrong with CR's methodology. If their test results show a lower time for the 328i than the 330i then I'm sure under identical conditions the 328i they tested *would* be faster than the 330i (without using any racing techniques like brake-torquing)."
"It is what they reported:

> Most 3 Series are the mid-grade 330i, which comes with a 248-hp, 2.0-liter turbo four-cylinder. This engine delivers a healthy punch and effortlessly propels the car. Throttle response is immediate and consistent throughout, whether at low engine speeds during normal driving, or during spirited driving near the engine's top end. We measured 0-60 mph acceleration at 6.9 seconds, falling right in line with turbocharged four-cylinder competition from Audi and Mercedes-Benz.

I don't know why CR's test was so much slower. I found [this response](https://www.consumerreports.org/luxury-cars/sports-sedan-showdown-bmw-3-series-vs-mercedes-benz-c-class/) for a possible explanation:

> Those of you challenging CR's performance stats: they don't brake-torque cars like enthusiast magazines do. Check out the enthusiast 5-60 mph figures for more accurate real-world performance--they're right in-line with CR's.

That seems plausible to me. He's correct, the 5-60 times reported by other magazines for the 330i are pretty close to the 0-60 time reported by CR.

I certainly don't see anything wrong with CR's methodology [which is](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars-how-consumer-reports-tests-cars/):

> The staff at most publications spends a day to a week getting to know a car. We drive each vehicle we rate for 2,000 break-in miles over several weeks before we even start formal testing. After that, we do more than 50 tests using state-of-the-art measurement tools.

...

> Acceleration tests are conducted on a smooth, flat pavement straightaway at the track. The test car is rigged with a precise GPS-based device that’s hooked to a data-logging computer and a display that’s mounted on the windshield. This equipment creates precise records of time, speed, and distance. We use it to measure sprints from 0-30 mph, 0-60 mph, and for quarter-mile runs. 

It's possible something was wrong with their car I guess. But I couldn't find any complaint by BMW which would usually occur if they suspect something was wrong with the car they tested.

So long as I'm comparing CR's performance stats to other CR performance stats (which I was), I'm pretty confident that they're accurate relative to each other. If they found that the 328i was a bit faster for its 0-60, then I'm sure it was as they make their tests very fair and repeatable."
"It's a lot harder to talk about ""most people"" when it comes to electricity prices, though.

For gas prices, you can look at the national average and be decently close for almost everyone. If you calculate the fuel cost of a car by assuming $2.31/gallon of regular gas, you'll be within ~25% or so for probably 99% of the population. Yes, people in California will be paying more, and people in Texas will be paying less, but it'll be in the same ballpark.

With electricity it's way different. You can use the national average price of 12 cents/kWh, but you'll be *way* off for a lot of people. There are people paying 4x that, and there are people paying a tenth of that to charge their car.

Yes, there are some gas stations with absurd prices, but the vast majority of people rarely if ever buy gas there. Millions of people have these super-high or super-low electricity prices."
"But some are.  In some cases I've paid .40/kwh to charge at home.

In addition, what is the cost/kwh to charge an electric car away from home?  gas prices in comparison are flat, but some 3rd party ev chargers are remarkably expensive per kwh.  It's not uncommon to pay .59/kwh at some chargers. "
"Yes, that is about correct."
"I agree, it's an odd omission. The non-powertrain warranty is pretty important for most buyers. Stating that all three are the same for that would be useful information."

Sis and I had this debate for much of our cross country trip in Nicki. She kept saying how much easier it was to stop for gas. I countered that I did not mind the additional planning and we were stopping any way. While charging you can plan something else to do. Out of about 24 stops to charge we had two times we wanted to go before the car was charged. Probably 20 mins tops. Much less time than sitting waiting for gas car to fill 24 times. Destination chargers rule! No one will fill your car with gas for free while you sleep or eat.
"90% of a Tesla is no different, any wrench can do it. So far my Service Center is OK with me working on my car. Although I have only done rotors, pads, brake lines and added gadgets.

As for reliability, Nicki has 10K miles and in once for wheel alignment that was bad from factory. Across the street has Leaf he swears has zero service visits in three years, his Mercedes SUV is a different story though. He claims tons of shop time, about $1500 per month since warranty lapsed - he is scrambling to dump it."
"> I mean i have never heard anyone praise the ""reliability "" of a bmw or mercedes

Agreed!

Also, never heard anyone talk about that with a Tesla. Have you?"
Ill praise the reliability. You may get reliability and maintenance costs confused. Maintenance costs are high. But ive never been stranded in mine. My father had a 740il for a decade without anything more than maintenance and a trim piece here or there. 
So does the BMW frankly. The C class refresh was very kind to the interior. 
"Savings on fuel is dependent on how much you drive. My wife and I combined put less than 8k on our cars. Also, what do you suppose will happen to electricity prices if everyone starts driving electric cars? Anyway, EV's never make economic sense. Whatever you save in gas is more than paid for in the premium you paid up front."

"Same here. Whenever I have to fill it up away from home, I use the extra time my Tesla has gotten me into the habit of waiting as a buffer to let the fuel settle for a good hour or two before pulling the pump out and starting the engine up again."

Good for you. 90% people in my city can't charge at home or work.
"It's different in the sense that few people concern themselves with range when buying an ICE car since there's a gas station around every corner, and it only takes a few minutes to fill up.  

Range is not even something advertised- you'd have to look at a spec sheet to find gas tank size and do some math with the MPG rating to figure out range.  When you go on a road trip with an ICE car, you don't have to plan out your gas station stops ahead of time.  You know you'll be able to find one.  "
"If you charge at home, you wake up every morning with a full ""tank"".  The only time you need to charge away from home is if your are traveling a long distance.  For most people, the inconvenience to charge occasionally will be lower than having to fill up frequently.  I recently drove a Model X over 1,000 miles in a weekend, and it wasn't that much of an inconvenience."
"Really?  This graphic is comparing the base model of three different brands without taking any tax credits into account.  These are the cars that get budget conscious customers to look at the brand, how is that a red herring?"
"People who want the badge but don't want the A3. The AWD version is $40,500 and knocks that down to 5.7."
"No one, because that 0-60 time is incorrect. The actual time is 0-60 in 5.4 or 5.3 seconds depending on the source, faster than the Model 3. I'm not sure where anyone got that 7.1 seconds, but it is a Tesla sub after all."
"That may be because there can be a difference in qunatity and quality. Yes economy cars can have more stuff, but is it as good quality. Obviously some people think there is a difference. "
"I guess it depends on what your definition of mass market is. The 3-series sold 411,000 units last year. Is that mass market?"
"Why? The bmw 3 series ia a mass market car. From most the interviews I have watched. Tesla seems to indicated that that far down the market is for the likes of nissan and vw. They want to make a fast exiciting mass market car that gets people enthused about EVs. They beleave they are at the right price point, i guess we will know in a couple of years. "
Thats on an accord not a sporty sedan. There is a difference in the market. Rember the m3 (bmw) is a 3 series at heart. 
"And yet BMW sales have increased year after year for decades. One could argue that BMWs are not worth paying more money for, that you could get more luxury with cheaper cars with smaller engines, and that they sell way fewer cars than Honda, and yet they sell millions of cars a year... I guess I do t understand what's wrong with competing in that market."
"I like the wood accents currently in the Mode 3, and then that soft touch plastic often used in luxury cars."
"We have the reviews in places like motortrend. Although i also want to test drive the car and will before I make up my mind. But we do have the reviews that suggests it hadles like a european and we have the top speeds and acceleration. 
This is no camry or chevy, its up to the indervidual to decide if thats what they want or not. "
"I don't need to argue with them, it clearly states on their website that the 5.7 0-60 trim starts at $40,500 (https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-a4/trims-and-specs)

2.0 TFSI Ultra $36,000
0-60 7.1

2.0 TFSI $40,500
0-60 5.7

The 320i doesn't come standard with heated seats, power seats, or even a sun roof.  Not sure what point you are trying to make, but it's uninformed."
"You can’t just mix and match base price and higher trim specs. The base $36,000 A4 has a 7.1 0-60, and if you go for a more expensive trim with a better engine and AWD, it’s 5.7. 

That’s like trying to make a comparison of the Model S and saying it starts at $69,500 and has a 0-60 of 2.5 seconds. Technically true, incredibly misleading. "
"That price is for the TFSI Ultra engine, which has 0-60 of 7.1s. The ""TFSI"" engine has a 0-60 of just barely higher than the rating given by Tesla. "
Sounds like you're missing out on Tesla's recommended [maintenance](https://www.tesla.com/support/maintenance-plans) unless you're getting it for free or ignoring the recommended maintenance altogether. 
"I was comparing it to true ""budget"" cars like the Camry or Civic. I think it's still a step above that tier. 

> Manual seats, manual side mirrors, no center console

The Model 3 does start with manual seats but I don't think that sole reason constitutes a luxury/budget car.

Manual side mirrors? You sure? I'm fairly certain those are adjusted by the steering wheel buttons.

And no center console? I've also seen test ride videos showing the center console being open as well. "
"Manual seats? I actually think it's automatic because I recall a video of the VP driving a Model 3 and it had the controls at the bottom. Could be wrong. As for the other stuff I don't know. But yeah, if I can simply describe the Model 3, its a super trimmed downed minimalistic mini Model S. It makes sense. Tesla needs something easy to mass manufacture and the 3 makes it easy with less parts and all. "
"It's not a Model S at all from an engineering standpoint. Now, maybe you meant that ""It's a less expensive Tesla for those whom a Model S is too expensive,"" yes, that's true. But compare the specs vs. the Model S and you'll see they're very much different cars like the BMW 3-Series and 5-Series are different vehicles."
"The Prius has the same 0.24 drag.

http://toyotanews.pressroom.toyota.com/releases/2017-toyota-prius-liftback-sept16.htm

The Prius is just a fucked up car that nobody should buy."
Coefficient alone can't tell you the whole story. You have to also take frontal area into consideration. The number on the Benz is probably real. 
"To be fair, nobody's working on AP1 right now either"
Yeah I think OTA updates for entertainment systems is fairly common nowadays. Anything beyond that either isn't updated or is only done so through dealers. I think I remember this being the arrangement manufacturers have made with dealerships. 
"Software for most OEMs, including those two, is actually done in house most of the time.  I'm not sure where you have your experience from.  Most OEMs have have been working on over the air anyway, though they're a ways behind. 

To be fair some suppliers will do occasional controllers for major companies, but it's pretty rare from what I see."
"Not to mention they save major updates for next year's model, because pretty much nothing else changes."
"OTA updates for Android Auto happens on the smartphone app, not the onboard system. I have no evidence, but suspect the same is true of Apple's CarPlay."
"I've seen a writeup of someone who had hacked his model S (purely file system access AFAIK), he showed what looked like the code for Performance modes were in the base model, etc, so one *could* hack their own tesla, it just isn't being done actively.  That same guy also wrote about how Tesla reps contacted him and told him support from Tesla would become null and void if he continued to hack his car in the future, which is probably why owners aren't inclined... Your car tattles on you!  I suspect used car owners might do this as the price of the cars fall, but right now I'd rather keep my OTA updates coming in, not lose supercharging for life, and so on.   

Tesla cutting off supercharging for life on future cars basically guarantees hacking will happen eventually, that's the only incentive used car buyers will have once OTA updates stop rolling out for out of warranty cars.  

This isn't me disagreeing with you, by the way - my Audi had some awesome aftermarket tweaks to the base software, these things really would be welcome in Teslas as well."
"If you hack it you own it, no warranty."
Yup I own a 320i x drive .. the only options I added was heated seats and a sun roof. 
"And this is why I actually think in general a plug in hybrid like the volt is actually the best option for most people. You drive it on electric 99% of the time, but if you ever need to go a long distance then you just use gas like any other car on the road, no requirement to plan your trip around superchargers or wait the 30 minutes. "
"My issue is the lack of data when driving at 120 km/h in -40 C with a strong headwind. My current commute is 200 km, if we assume I'll get 50% of my battery life with those conditions the small battery won't be enough for me to make it home. The larger battery would work well, especially if work follows through with getting chargers in the parking lot.

However, by the time I do buy a Model 3 I'll should have a much shorter commute. I don't expect to see any in Manitoba until 2020."
"Worse you get screwed over at the pump, since they change prices all the time . You would have to invest quite some mind share each day/week to get the best price available ... With electricity, which it not cheap here in Germany,  at least I have to check only every two years, investing about an hour to get the best offer for the next two years. And then I have peace of mind."
"Lots of cars do 5L/100km (47mpg) on mixed driving. A lot of cars, incl. my Volvo, have an official tank capacity of 60L but take about 65.

At 65 liters you need to make 6.5L/100km (36.2mpg) and you have 1000km. In other words it's 1000km easily.

5L/100km with a 65L tank will do 1300km!"
"Worth noting that real leather seats, heated seats, backup camera, keyless entry, navigation, upgraded audio, and moonroof are all options on the 330i as well.  It's a bit bare in its own right.

It does have folding mirrors and power seats standard.  Not sure how their ""leatherette"" seats will compare to whatever the base seats in the Model 3 are like, but they very well may be nicer."
"I stand corrected, doesn’t make much sense to me that a high end car brand doesn’t come with those things default.  

In my opinion it’s like xenon lights, the halos are kind of their thing, there’s really no reason to not include what is essentially your signature. 

Oh well."
"BMW anal probes it's customers on options, it's quite ridiculous.

"I firmly believe it's aesthetics, or the lack thereof, that drive this.  Automakers view people who are concerned about efficiency as weirdos, who want weird looking cars.  They aren't willing to take a chance on the reaction if they made a clean, efficient, good-looking car.

Or at least they weren't.  Tesla has kind of forced everyone to revise their notions.  The new Leaf looks a lot less alien, for example."
"It's got electric torque, so it's fast off the line, but the acceleration sucks after about 20mph.  It can still eventually get to 90mph."
It's still a juggernaut. Compared to the Camry hybrid with a very similar system (and similar models in Japan/other markets) the Prius constantly outsells by a huge margin. The Prius look/branding is super effective.
"> (Alexlam24 wrote) Frontal surface area is the important factor. Cd means nothing unless you factor that in.

Neither as default trumps the other; it'd be like saying length matters more than width WRT to footprint; both are equally important on absolute basis; each plays non-trivial role in resulting air resistance.  Real world, it depends on situation.  For example at speed, Cd (50% improvement) of comparable sized vehicle frontal|coronal plane (< +/- 10% area difference and ~ very similar weight) will play bigger role if hypothetical drivetrain has identical flat efficiency since air resistance becomes primary energy drain vs. low speed where rolling resistance and hvac has outsized impact on battery consumption.  On Chevy Bolt (Cd ~0.32 vs Model 3 Cd~0.23) there's almost 30% drop in air friction power drain but their cross sectional areas are nearly the same (approximated by width sans mirrors x (height - clearance) and nearly same weight.)  So when Cd differences are large on otherwise similar vehicles, Cd can situationally play an outsized relative role in contrast to your assertion.

Of course frontal **cross sectional** surface area A is needed to determine final impact, but I'm simply discussing Mercedes' (and occasionally other manufacturer's) questionable record(s) of having significant disparity between claimed vs. real-world stateside measured Cd which is no less applicable to their CdA.

E.g. Varying Cd with same A will create in generalized case a linear impact on their power consumption needed to maintain velocity.  See related: (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4g01pb/it_looks_like_the_300mile_highway_range_epa_has/d2e0y1k/) :

"All cars have crumple zones that are designed to, well, absorb the impact. They will crumple and crumple until you get to the cabin - the cabin is designed like a *panzer tank*, to prevent intrusion and protect the passengers.

[Something like this.](http://www.toyota-global.com/innovation/safety_technology/safety_technology/technology_file/passive/images/sft_43_02.jpg)

Now, I don't know how the above 3 cars differ in cabin strength, and I don't know a lot about Tesla and MB, but I do know that BMW sedans are pretty heavy for what they are. For example, with the 5 series, E60->F10, they took a step backwards. The E60 was built with a part aluminium part stainless steel monocoque, yet the F10 was built with SS only. It was noticeably heavier than its predecessor and handled worse. With the new G11 7-series, they are integrating carbon fiber into the car structure, noticeably reducing weight.

The F30 3-series is nearing the end of its production cycle, I assume, and the successor will have at least *some* weight saving due to carbon fiber integration."
"Don't conflate strength with rigidity or mass.  Optimally the passenger compartment will be very strong and rigid, while the crumple zones will be designed to decrease both acceleration and jerk."
It is. Model S/X are still using the old cells.
"A fully dressed 2.0 litre turbo motor isn't exactly light. In fact, it's probably about the same as an LSx (which is partially a reason people like to swap LS1s into Miatas and 240SXs)."
"On the surface you're right, except if you look at the ""time to wait for car to refuel"" for most driving it is 0 with Tesla, ""3 minutes"" for a gasoline car since with an EV you refuel at home/work when the car isn't in use anyways and no extra stop is required at a fuel station unless you're doing a road trip.

Ps. You must be some type of Formula One pit stop person if it takes you 3 minutes to gas up. I've got a small tank and it's always 10+ minutes. With my driving that's 10 minutes a week that I could be saving by refueling over night."
"Just to add to what u/drainconcept said, the 330i BMW is on the table, it's the performance upgrade.

The main stats are the base specs/engines for every model, so the BMW isn't getting mistreated. Also worth pointing out that the 320i is priced closer to the base Model 3 than the 330i is."
Who cares? It's easier to use a car buying service than it is to buy a Tesla. For starters you can get the exact car you want within a few days instead of months.

"BMW 330i does have standard power and memory seats. Also standard seats are the ""vegan leather/fake leather."" I just think the comparisons that electrek and all the tech websites are putting out are not accurate and don't understand how the luxury sport sedan market works.

Theres no way you could possibly get consistent results without brake torquing an automatic car. 
"That's unfortunate, you should look into EV rate, it sounds like you blew through your toes, and that's totally unrelated to your car.

Gas prices is totally volatile, very misleading to say that they're flat. They were 4 per gallon in 2012, now they're running 2.80. that's a 40 percent increase in four years. If electricity prices fluctuate that much, people would revolt.

">When you go on a road trip with an ICE car, you don't have to plan out your gas station stops ahead of time. You know you'll be able to find one. 

You do have to plan a little bit, even in an ICE. Otherwise I wouldn't keep seeing people carrying little red fuel cans along the highway."
Because of how far they go. That's is the only reason why. If Electric cars could go for 500 km or 2 weeks without needing a single charge we'd think about them very similarly.
"Meh, I don't know. When I get home in an ICE car, I get out and go in the house. You have to fiddle with a charging port and a hose to fuel your car, every time you get home (if as you say you start with a full tank every morning). And then when you leave you have to disconnect it again, hang up the hose and close the port. Every time. Overall, I think the experience isn't that different, maybe slightly more time involved (certainly more times you have to fuel the car) over the course of a week for you. So really not much different."
"Number one, they didn't put in the strongest competitor to the Model 3, the A4. Number two, the 330i is not that much more than the 320i, is quicker and can still be had sub $35,000. Otherwise, why not put a VW Beetle on the list? Lastly, the base Model 3 is lacking in several basic luxury car staples, such as heated and power seats, heated mirrors, sun roof, etc. The graphic doesn't take this into account at all, yet those types of features are far more important to the average consumer than the friggin wheelbase. I think it's pretty clear what they were trying to do with that article. Further, they compare the price of the Telsa, you know, the one that everyone pays, to the MSRP of the other cars, you know, the price that no one pays."

From [Audi.com](https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-a4/trims-and-specs) probably? The ""ultra"" engine says 7.1s 0-60. You have to go to the non-Ultra AWD version starting at $40,500 to get 5.6s."

They're referring to the A4 Ultra running on 2.0 TSFI-Ultra 190hp (better mpg) but only advertised 7.1s 0-60mph.(assuming FWD)

You're referring to the A4 regular running a more powerful spec. 2.0L TFSI-**non-Ultra** @ 252hp advertised at 5.7s 0-60mph.(assuming FWD; even faster w/ $2100 AWD option e.g. 5.2s according to C&D '17 review of A4 AWD upgraded to non-""ultra"" trim http://www.caranddriver.com/audi/a4).  Specs match on manufacturer page.  The germans often sandbag, but I doubt they're sandbagging by nearly 2s here (7.1s vs 5.2s).  You may want to double check your sources to confirm.

As far as I know this might have started to change, since it became more important lately, but it's still not completely integrated, i.e. music players are made by one company and it has some hooks to the OS that is run on the car and that OS can give commands to the music player. 

"
"The problem with other manufacturers, such as Audi, is that they treat the whole thing like Nokia and Sony Ericsson did back before Apple came along. Holding back features, a new model with a tiny incremental update, and no (at least very little) updates or backports. Like when Audi introduced graphical view of the parking sensors. Even though older cars could get the update at a dealer they didn't turn it on. Sure, if you have the equipment you can code it in yourself, but for 99% of the owners there's nothing becoming better. They cut off support for AMI (which was a crap idea even when they came up with it) a few years back too, and finding software updates for AMI (or Volkswagen's version) is more or less impossible. 

Then there's MOST were all the third party stuff is kind of crappy (at least on my first gen) and the manufacturer protocol isn't open. Imagine how much cool stuff would be made if a proper peripheral interconnect bus was created for cars and the manufacturers agreed to a common standard with very little room for manufacturer customization from the interconnect up to the HMI and screen. "
"Exactly. With most existing cars you could make modifications to the registry and roll it back if you needed to take it in, then re-enable the mods after and never void the warranty.

I hate to be a pessimist, but it's probably only a matter of time before insurance companies request all that data being sent back to HQ."

"All true there, the 3 series is a 7 year old model and their option lists are kinda weird to be honest.

The premium+tech package would add another 6k to the 330i, but with that you get a HUD as well.

To be honest I really think the F30 3 series is long in the tooth and the new A4 is a much better value proposition.

The Model 3's biggest value proposition is that it's an EV, everything else is kind unimportant and can be a little bit worse than ICEs. "
I definitely agree with you that it's odd for a high end car not to have them! I bought an almost base model and my back seats also don't fold down..another weird feature to charge extra for.

- Headlights have pointless and jarring hook on bottom edge, contributes to very busy, non cohesive design

- Foglights have VERTICAL orientation, along with (another) pointless verticle slit that leads into headlights.  Vertical motion makes a car look tall and tippy, horiziontal lines make them appear wider and more stable.  

- Lower front grill is not large enough, leaves front bumper as very large expanse of surface, looks like a giant upper lip on the face of the car similar to a rat

"- it's ugly and circular and is a giant focal point.  Does tesla do this?  No.  And their cars are attractive.

- More light is better, especially when foglights tend to be options.  Options = more profit.

- No they don't.  Lots of cars have faux grills.  Small surface changes on front facing slabs like bumpers have basically no aero impact.  Hence why I said it could be primarily black plastic.  It does not have to be an actual larger opening.

- Yes, you can.  See the original Tesla Model S.  Or the Nissan GTR.  Both are doing what I was suggesting; changing the parting line higher.  You can keep the same area closed off, but make the grill appear larger and make the body colored area appear smaller.

- Neither one are aero.  

What's your job again?"
Very surprisingly I think the US automakers figured this out better than the European and Japanese.  I love the Ford Fusion Energy and even the Chevy Volt looks rather pedestrian next to a Prius or i3.
"I agree, electric vehicles have been treated as somewhat of a niche market. Similar to how pickup trucks are explicitly marketed to a tough/masculine market, electric/hybrid has a target demographic. And to people outside that demographic, it can look, well, kinda smug and alienating 

It won't be until we get several cars meant to appeal to a general audience (think Toyota Camry), that I think we'll see widespread acceptance of electric and the demise of combustion. Certainly, the Tesla is one step in this direction."
"It is.

Its hard to search for but I wonder with all the hybrids Lexus sells as well with the other Toyota (Camry and Rav4) if combined they come close to Prius numbers."
">A fully dressed 2.0 litre turbo motor isn't exactly light

Definitely not. But a Civic with a 2.0 turbo (and a bunch of other heavy stuff) is still 300lbs lighter than a C300.

>it's probably about the same as an LSx

An LSx is pretty much cheating if we are comparing weight.

"Actually the 330i is closer, coming in at round 34.1k on average for a base. Sure the 320i is cheaper, but it's also slower and has less features. Not a good comparison."
"I agree it is faster, but it isn't easier.  With Tesla, just go on the website and order it right there.  They will deliver it to you.  Also, the haggled price you get with a dealer is a wash vs the savings on gas and maintenance."
"I think the model S is a great car a co worker owns 2 and he has driven me around in one. I was more referring to the Model 3, and calling it ""not a real car"" is off, I mean they still arent up to par with what I consider a car I would want to drive but it all comes down to the handling and how well it sticks to the road for me, the dual motors is a good start but my reserves for Teslas so far are their handling, I will wait for track results though and see how the real world tests go "
"I mean, sure, they've got them on BMWs. I've got them on my BMW. I've used them exactly twice: the first time I went ""oh, that's what that button does"", and the second time to see how much space I saved by folding them (literally a half-inch). It's a junk feature.
"
"Oh, yeah... Exactly. I was get it wrong."
"> you should look into EV rate  
When this happened there was no recourse (submeter)

I was saying that mostly gas prices are flat across an area, but EV charging rates vary widely.

In my area, it could cost from 3 cents/mile to almost 20 cents per mile depending on where I charge.

Some people have ev charging at home and can pay 10c/kwh (after installing a meter), while some public fast chargers cost up to .59/kwh.  If I charge my current car at a $1/hour L2 charger, it costs me .28/kwh.

gas prices might conceivably vary 2x, but not 6x."
"good grief ____/¯(ツ)____/¯

did that work"
[removed]
True. And it still feels nicer than even the Model S interior (sweet glass roof aside).
"By the time I start to hit the limits of my car's range, I'm ready for a break anyway. If you're the type of person who wants to drive straight throw with minimal time for bio breaks then yes, the charging overhead will hurt. If you're like me and want to actually get out of the car for a little bit every couple of hours, they have almost no impact. And yes, I speak from experience, with multiple 1,000-mile road trips under my belt."
But they would be able to charge more because of the demand. Not being able to satisfy demand is a problem you want to have.
">If Electric cars could go for 500 km or 2 weeks without needing a single charge we'd think about them very similarly.

Good news!  500km = 310 miles, the rated range of the Model 3."
You get used to it pretty quickly. Takes about 10 seconds to plug in/out. It's way better than going to the gas station. 
"1) It will never be a direct comparison. Show me any traditional manufacturer that comes close to the instant acceleration or low cog of an electric car.  The 330i doesn't have the ""standard"" features such as rear view camera, parking sensors, navigation. Those are upgrades that start making the cars comparable with a 50k budget. Stop looking for a perfect apples to apples comparison, it doesn't exist. This one isn't perfect, but I think it gets a lot of things right.

2) 6 way powered/heated seats will be standard on the base Model 3.  The upgrade gets you 12 way seats in the front and heated seats throughout.  Power adjusting mirrors are standard in the 3, you just get heated and power folding with the upgrade.

3) Model 3 is priced and spec'd in a very interesting way.  It will probably attract buyers of the entry luxury sports sedan market as well as buyers of the Prius, Camry, sonata, etc.

4) You may be right on the actual cost vs MSRP. Depending on demand, some pay more than MSRP, some less.  Avg is usually less but it varies on location, model and brand.  Not sure what a more direct comparison would be.

5) Does BMW still sell a model without folding rear seats?"
Manufacturers are notorious for underselling the specs. Real world tests are what matter.
"Ok, point taken. I was making a generalization. I apologize. 

Thanks for pointing out the difference between the Ultra. I'd still argue that at an MSRP of 40k and a real purchase price closer to 36k, the A4 is a far better value AND quicker.

Edit: But wait, then what's this on the Audi page: 

Starting at $36,000

???"
"Woah Tesla fanboys even hacked Audi's website to give Model 3 an advantage.

Short $TSLA"
"Well then no, it won't be mass market by your definition. However it might meet Teslas expectation of 500,000 per year."
500k people is a good start and thats all. There are a lot of drivers out there that still think of evs as slow and ugly. The fact other makers insist on makeing ones that look like basket ball shoes (bmw im looking at you) does not help. 
"They are not that sporty on the twisty nz roads they come out a little dull.

"Do you actually not understand that the A4, like any other car, has a base model with one engine and more expensive ones with better engines, or are you just trolling?"
This is incorrect.
Ah okay. I forgot to ask that since I was thinking maybe it was a premium option. 
Eventually buyers will be able to configure the premium package with the base range for a total of $40k.
"Don't listen to him, I got a prius 3 months ago and it's a fine car. Nothing to write home about except for only having to fill the tank once every 2 weeks. "
"For the price its the worst choice among hybrids.  It was always the worst choice even back in the early 2000's when you could get a normal looking Civic hybrid that got the same mileage and its the worst choice now when its own Lexus sibling is way nicer looking inside and out for the same price on the higher end.  On the lower end the Civic hybrid still beats it with many other competitors like the Chevy Volt or Ford Fusion Energy.

"I'm not as familiar with infotainment systems, but more with control modules like engine and body.

"I don't think you know much about the onboard computers in modern cars or how they are configured.

"Look at the Prius though, it is one of the most reliable cars on the market right now, probably way more so than any tesla."
"That definitely is super weird, unless the fold down seats are more comfortable or different in some way aside from the folding aspect. I mean, I get the business appeal of making customers who really care about folding seats pay extra for it, but it's not the greatest value proposition for the customers."
"Yeah... The answer is difference in volume of production and quality - it's just different markets for a different people so that there are cars cheaper from another class and market for sure, where they (entry level luxe's) are - automakers doesn't take this in itself because it's different market wich follows from the differences in the quality and price categories and so this is just products for different target audience and thats it. Just do not to compare luxury cars with a mass ones - Tesla was and will be a luxury brand for years what ever Mask said about TM3.

"I may be biased as an e46 driver myself, but I think comparing current model year 320i’s to 2007 and older M series (especially e46) is kind of an unfair comparison.  They’re definitely going to go more for performance than comfort/luxury in the car they designed for the track and enthusiasts. But for more mainstream (320-328) models that they build I don’t think performance is at the forefront of their plans.  

Obviously, the more you spend on the car the more you’ll get of each performance and luxury, just look at the v12 760Li.  But I consider them a brand that focuses on the blend of performance and luxury more than anything."
"> Maybe in the 90's but now there are so many more options. I see them like Harley motorcycles. Everyone knows a Honda is better but if you want to be a ""real"" rider you get a Harley.

I actually don't think the Harley analogy holds. Harley is selling heritage and design. If you want a road bike, there are vastly superior choices if you don't place a premium on what HD offers and value technical ability.

On the other hand a Jeep quite literally IS the machine that can do what most other vehicles simply cannot offroad. Arguably no other vehicle is built with rough terrain as much in mind as a Jeep. It's just that most owners never take them off road. But just because most owners don't use a Jeep for what it is superior for, doesn't make Jeeps not superior for that thing. 

You just can't call Jeeps ""horrible"" off road and be taken even remotely seriously. It's an erroneous statement full-stop.

">It's a junk feature.

Not on the Model S, at least. It saves a bit over 6 inches in wingspan. I couldn't fit mine in the garage without them. 

Weird that BMW would go through all that trouble and save so little width."
"Again, you're not comparing apples to apples. Those rates are if you charge at a public place, and the rates include maintenance and profit. Off course they will be more expensive!

One of the biggest draw of owning an EV is being able to charge at home, where the rates are regulated! Your argument is akin to ""Let me fill up at a gas station in the middle of nowhere that costs $8/gallon! It's not a fair comparison. There are times you need to do it, but it should not be a norm. If you don't buy an EV that can get you to work and back (or charge at work at a reasonable rate), then you probably picked the wrong EV."

"1) Who cares about instant acceleration when both cars get you to 60 at the same time. I would actually prefer smoother acceleration during daily driving to be honest.

2) Where did you read powered and heated seats are standard? This is the first I've heard of that.

3) I'm currently deciding to buy an A4 or wait for the Model 3, although last night we pretty much decided against the 3. To compare what I'd get in the A4, I'd have to spend around 47.5k on the Model 3. Yeah no.

4) Honestly if you pay anywhere close to the MSRP you are either desperate for some new model or a terrible consumer.

5) I'm not a BMW expert, why do you ask?"
"Interesting on point 2. Everything I've heard is that you need the premium interior package to get powered/heated seats. Is there any source for this other than Tesla employees? I would love to save $5k on my reservation, but I can't imagine dropping a ton of money and having manual seats"
"So you think Audi is advertising their performance as 7.1s when it's actually 5.3s, almost 2s faster? Any source? Otherwise that's as useful as me saying the Model 3 is probably really a 4s 0-60 because Tesla could be underselling it.

"
"> Ok, point taken. I was making a generalization. I apologize.

No worries.  I think it's an easy honest error since their (Audi) page sucks so badly.  Audi's page and car configuration was rather headache inducing.  

They default advertise their regular non-ultra 4cyl turbo A4.

You have to click on (The Trim and Specs button) for A4 which leads to:

""https://www.audiusa.com/models/audi-a4/trims-and-specs"" 

Then ""2.0 TFSI(R) ultra(R)"" rather than ""2.0 TFSI(R)""

Then ""View technical specifications"".

Scroll down to ""Engine"" subsection.

You'll see:

> Horsepower (@rpm) - 190 @ 4,200-6000
> [...]
> Acceleration (0-60 mph) - 7.1 seconds

Did you find that one above?

> Edit: But wait, then what's this on the Audi page
> ""Starting at $36,000 Engine type Four-cylinder 0—60 mph acceleration 5.7 seconds EPA-estimated combined mpg 27 mpg5""

Hrm... odd.  Can you point me to the link?  Edit: found.

I was going by: ""https://www.google.com/search?q=google+audi+a4+msrp"" which yielded $34,900 for ""A4 ultra premium"" 

Similarly:

https://www.autoblog.com/buy/2017-Audi-A4/specs/

2.0T ultra Premium starts at $34,900 msrp

2.0T Premium starts at $37,300 msrp

Confusingly Motor Trend notes 5.4s 0-60mph Quattro(i.e. AWD) 252hp noted Prestige trim as ""$8100"" option which contradicts how little Prestige trim added to Google & Autoblog's search results unless they throw that word around for nothing (hence I said the search was headache inducing.)  The same page cites $34,900 base at $190hp(of the ultra) yet notes 25city/33hwy mpg of the A4 non-ultra (http://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/a4/2017/2017-audi-a4-20t-quattro-first-test-review/) in contrast to the 27city/37hwy of the EPA ""ultra"" (https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2017_Audi_A4.shtml)

Any mismatch is likely to be data organization error on Motor Trend's part for the ""first test review"" web page.

As for Audi's page, I think that can be chalked up to being kind of douchey over-liberal web wording\*.  Clicking on the link shows: 

> Starting MSRP of $36,000 for a 2018 Premium A4 2.0 TFSI® ultra® with automatic transmission.   Model shown is a Premium Plus 2018 A4 2.0T quattro with automatic transmission shown in Florett Silver metallic with available Black Optic plus package, Sport package, Black Optic plus 19” wheel package and Navigation and Telematics package with a starting MSRP of $45,200. Prices exclude $975 destination, taxes, title, other options and dealer charges. Dealer sets actual price.

> Always obey all local speed and traffic laws.

> 24 city/33 highway mpg (2018 A4 Sedan 2.0 TFSI® with six-speed manual transmission).  EPA estimates. Your mileage will vary and depends on several factors including your driving habits and vehicle condition.

Taking your earlier reply: 

> Edit: But wait, then what's this on the Audi page
> ""Starting at $36,000 Engine type Four-cylinder 0—60 mph acceleration 5.7 seconds EPA-estimated combined mpg **27** mpg""

corresponds exactly to 2017 non-ultra AT/MT combined mpg (https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2017_Audi_A4.shtml)

See ""A4 ultra"" review http://blog.caranddriver.com/2017-audi-a4-ultra-goes-lean-under-the-hood-nets-31-mpg-combined/

\* I'd argue they are advertising the price for the ultra (perhaps with added doc & destination fee) and just putting in non-ultra ""Model shown"" cop-out.  There is a chance EPA '18 will continue lacking the 'ultra' (see link below) line but I'm skeptical; I expect it to show up in <year once it's tested unless one get's dealer confirmation that ""ultra"" ed is gone for good...)  

*Note:* One conceivable alternative could be they dropped prices on non-ultra, offering same price for both ultra and-non ultra FWD w/ $2100 more for AWD quattro (available for non-quattro only).  However given the autoblog config. page I'm much more inclined to believe they either raised the price of the ultra and or added in destination&doc fees.  For instance, Autoblog notes $36,000 for A4 ""ultra"" FWD (ultra now only comes in FWD) 27cty/37hwy ; and $40,500 for non-ultra 24cty/34hwy(AT) (https://www.autoblog.com/buy/2018-Audi-A4/#) which matches up with non-ultra EPA mpg (https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2018_Audi_A4.shtml)"

If you go to school for industrial design, like I did, and it's my career, you learn design is anythign BUT subjective.

The fact you think it's all just personal opinion just shows how fucking ignorant you are.

Good design has general rules and aspects which are fairly straightforward.  The current prius and most of toyotas lineup ignores most of these rules, which is why their cars tend to look like dogshit."
"- no, you don't.  You can apply it on a clean surface and not make the logo protruding from the front like a dog nose.  Tesla doesn't do this, it looks like shit.

- And traditional priuses have always looked like shit.  Always.  Larger grill = more aggressive = emphasizing width = will look more attractive.

- Incorrect.  You could also mold a plastic grill where the top half is literally closed off black plastic.  See:  New honda civic fake vents.

- I am a regular at ecomodder.  If you want a wheel that is actually aero see the original honda insight; needs to be a fairly flat disc.  Having a traditional 5 spoke with rounded edges will cause turbulence.

I also owned an aero-modded LF sedan, grill block off, kammback, etc.  I know a bit about aero.  More of a hobby but I am not just guessing in the dark with my statements."
"Why isn't it fair to use actual transaction cost? Do you imagine Tesla will knock 10-15% off MSRP when they have half a million pre-orders? 10-15% is also conservative, the 3 series right now has discounts of up to $8-$10k off MSRP.

You don't have to haggle if you don't want to. You can use a car buying service where for a couple hundred dollars someone will do the haggling for you and get you a reasonable deal."
"Ah, Tesla also imposes a destination fee of 1k. And NO ONE pays the MSRP. That's what I'm talking about. Typically you can expect to pay about 12% below the MSRP if you know what you're doing. That brings the price down to 34.1k. Whereas with the Model 3, you know you are going to be paying 35k no questions asked. Plus the destination fee of course."

EV prices are less consistent and in the last year I've paid from .5-.17 cents/mile.

wait, actually... I have charged at a number of free L3 and L2 chargers, and I actually paid a lot more sometimes.  One trip I documented well I used an evgo fast charger and got 8.5kwh for $9.95 on a trip where I got 4.2mi/kwh = .28 cents/mile

so .0 - .28 cents/mile EV  :)

You connect your computer or phone to the OBD adapter, and you can change options that can't be changed in the car's infotainment/settings menu.   It can get REALLY granular, to the point you can see that the manufacturer would confuse the fuck out of most folks if they had THAT MANY options in the car's settings menu.  

"
"Yeah, I know how it works. I do it. Every parent company has their own tools for programming, coding, and testing. Many of these tools require you to know exactly what module to talk to and what hex bits to flip. Some of them are abstracted to be easy to use, but not generally. This is not something amateurs should be doing, and it for sure voids your warranty, at least on that module. There is no easy rollback in many cases - code the module incorrectly, and you may need a complete reprogramming with dealer tools/firmware images."
I don't remember the details .. it was 2 years ago. Maybe the headlights ? 
"I wouldn't say underpowered .. there's still torque by the twin turbo engine. 
You really get little over 5 seconds 0-60 mph .. 

Anyway I still reserved the Tesla 3 and waiting for it "
most car purchasers are not designers
"Okay then, please give me an **objective** reasoning for this statment, other than ""My professor said so"":

> Factory wheels are just flat out fucking terrible looking and belong in 2001 on a modified civic with a bodykit."
"So, you are implying that one of the largest vehicle manufacturers in the world doesn't have employees that are extremely versed in design?

If anything, we need manufacturers that steer away from the dead boring sameness the car market has turned in to the last 20 years. I truly miss the days when cars were somewhat unique. That doesn't happen today."
"Mod note: comment removed for rudeness and reddiquette.  You can disagree without being obnoxious and calling people ""fucking ignorant"".  Further violations will lead to a ban."
[removed]
"* Then do so in the Render. You need a badge of some kind
* So you are saying the Mirai design should have been the Prius?
* The moulded plastic is fairly obvious and the Civic still has a horizontal bar for the bumper
* OK fair enough, but i still assume the VW wheel is more expensive."
"No, you don't know that. No idea yet whether there will be another referral program for the 3, and if so, how much it will be. It'd be less impressive than the amount you can knock off other cars by haggling, sure, but the fact that a haggling discount has to be qualified with ""about"" and ""if you know what you're doing"" just shows that it has absolutely no place on the chart. There's only manufacturer data up there.

-

*(Edit: d'oh, a more obvious example to point out would be regional EV incentives.)*"
"You just bought a car and you weren't in the market for the 3 anyway. As long as you like the car, that's great!"
"So here's what I'm seeing:
You're comparing public gas places (0.09-0.11) with public EV places (0.05-0.17).

What I'm saying is that it's unfair to make that comparison since you can always charge at home, akin to you can always charge at your local gas station near your home.

It would be more fair to compare:
1. Local gas stations price to price charging at home (the primary source of your daily EV charging needs, or at least it should be)
2. Remote gas station price to public EV charging places. This is where you would see prices of up to $5.00 per gallon (you can convert that to $/mile but I don't know what care your drive) for gas or 0.17/mile for EV charging.

Does that make sense? Remote vs Remote and ""Local"" vs Local. A home EVSE is like having your own gas station at home."
Well why not rent that explorer for your daily commute then? What's the difference?
"I would agree. They depreciate far worse than other cars in the class. However, I sincerely doubt the Model 3 will fare any better in that department."
"I've driven many different electric cars, some for a week at a time. EV's have instant torque sure, but the ICE has just as much of a kick in the pants (with the exception of a high end Model S), if only delayed half a second. Also new transmissions that you'll find in BMW's and Audi's are silky smooth and indistinguishable in smoothness from a 'single gear' EV motor.

On point 2, where can I see some official information on standard features that include those options?

I will either go for a new base A4 for arond 32k or a used 2017 prestige with all the bells and whistles for around 35k.

I'm happy for you to take my reservation, although it's telling me April, so you may already be ahead of me. Look I want lots of people to like the Model 3 and enjoy them. I just don't think objectively they make a lot of sense from a smart consumer perspective. Then again, most cars don't.
"
"It feels fast, but you never use that quickness. My Volt has a 0 to 60 that's abysmal (7+ seconds), but a 0 to 30 between last year's Model S 85 and P85. 

You never actually use that acceleration though. If you do the tires squeal a little and you get a funny feeling in your gut, and if anything is in any reasonable distance to you you'll be slamming the brakes pretty fast (and you'll look like a jackass).

I test drove an A4 and a Model S before settling for the Volt, and the A4 is as quiet (if not quieter), and feels just as quick as the Model S I test drove. I single out those two traits because they're the biggest two I attributed to EVs. I think test driving the A4 and seeing how refined it was compared to the S was what nudged me away from a Model 3 or S CPO, and towards the Volt, which in my use-case is 90% of the Model 3 with 100% of being here today"
"That review sounds like they tested the AWD version, which costs $4,500 more and has a listed 0-60 time of 5.6 seconds. So if they tested it to actually be 5.5-5.3, that’s hardly the massive undersell you’re talking about. "
"Hrm... no I'm stateside. (albeit somewhat befuddeled now.)  

But yah the whole thing is somewhat confounded mess trying to integrate the data from your link.  I updated the parent post with more details from the sleuthing you may find of interest. (EPA/MT/Autoblog/C&D links) w/pricing, mpg, engine, and perf spec comparisons.

> But even the better engine will only set you back about 35.5k after a little haggling.

No real disagreement I don't think I was contending that or at least had no opinion.  I was merely trying to get at least base price comparisons on same page or some form of consensus to work from.

If one's taking haggling and manu. incentives into account, there's other misc TCO and feature mismatches that heavily impact price and that quickly turn it into confounded mess so I omitted them from my comparison.^[1]
____

[1] e.g. (at least for BMW) GPS, or rear camera, updates, AEB (BMW), low speed only AEB, leather seats, auto-seats, heated seats, LTE wifi, EV incentives, AWD availability (now), EV charger costs, avg. $3.5k-$7.7k over avg ~13.5k mi/yr alleged US avg. 93month\*  car ownership at current gas prices (assuming non-premium) longevity (IIRC), that all can heavily tweak the #s in my estimation.  

\* I'm assuming luxury car ownership is well shorter than this but that's just my gut feel.

"
The issue is buzz around the model 3 was the electrical car everyone can afford. Turns out to be an entry level vehicle for a luxury brand car maker. So it is an expectation vs reality thing here.
"> they're not making 20k cars

*yet*

One can hope they'll come out with an even cheaper car. with 150-200mile range standard. Then again, they might only want to go this far down-hill, and anything further will be up to others."
"And what did it take Tesla to get the GF up and running? Aside from building the building, which other manufacturers have plenty of. A year or less? I just don't see a huge advantage here. And you assume that other companies are not doing any research of their own. It only takes a small team of engineers to make a significant break though."
"Maybe I want better milage, a real, two-mode hybrid instead of Honda's glorified auto stop system, a hatchback with more cargo space, and better reliability?

You're shitting all over the Prius in this thread, and it all comes down to ""I hate how it looks, check out this other car that's almost as good and looks better"". Some people don't care what their car looks like, or, gasp!, like how the Prius looks."
That proves nothing. She only drove one car. The Prius gets better mpg
"> and it for sure voids your warranty, at least on that module. 

Under the law, it voids nothing unless tesla can prove your changes damaged something.  Cars are one of the few places consumers are protected from garbage company policies."

"- The wheels are too small.  If you look at the original sketch, the wheel will generally be much larger as designers work on principles like proportion, and bean counters reduce these things to save money.

- The wheel design itself is very dated, having large radii similar to a mid 90s ford taurus.  Modern wheel designs tend to have flat machined faces to emphasize the diameter of the rim.  By adding such large radii it makes the wheel appear smaller.

- Traditional 5 spoke designs are not modern.  Modern wheels have more of a sawblade or kink to the spokes, such as the VW austin wheel I photoshopped in.

- Multi colored wheels are also very dated.  This was a brief trend in the early 2000s, but was quickly abandoned.  It does not look sporty, and instead communicates low quality aftermarket wheels like American Racing or other cheap brands.

But hey, keep arguing with the guy who went to school for this. What is it you do again?"
"I'm implying there is a reason why real enthusiasts think toyotas line up looks abysmally terrible.   They don't have a good direction, lack a cohesive brand language and don't really know what they are.  

For a good example, look at Audi. "

"I do disagree. If the Model S is anything to go by, resale will be quite decent. Obviously there's different production scales at work between the S and 3, so I don't reckon the 3 will be quite as good as the S, but I think it'll still be better than Audi's. Even Bimmer's resale is way better than Audi's. We shall see though."
"Honestly, I would do the following, but I'm too lazy, unlike yourself. I'd look at the A4 2.0 TFSI with an MSRP of 40.5k and the 330i with a base MSRP of 38.7k, then figure out a way to match options to what the Model 3 has on offer, which is tough, because the A4 for example comes with a ton of stuff standard that you can only get if you option up the Model 3 another 5k or more. Then I would set the prices to the Edmunds TMV, which will give you a good rough estimate of what people are actually paying for the car, vs the Tesla price.

Good luck!
"
"Interesting.
On one hand you had Tesla owners thinking the Model 3 was going to be just as good as a Model S but cheaper, and on the other hand you had everyone else thinking the Model 3 would be an econobox and the starting price of the car meant the max price. No one is happy.
I guess we'll just have to see whether they accomplished enough of what they promised to still meet their own expectations and sales goals."
"Maybe they'll do an Economy Marquee like Toyota/Lexus.
Edison Motors? "
"Time is all tesla have and commitment. Btw i am not even saying Tesla will succeed in getting us away from fossil fuels. I am yet to be convinced of that I am just pointing out until some one cuts ground on a factory comparable tesla has at least 2 years lead. 
We need the other companys on board now if we want to succeed in stopping all the issues related the fossil fuels. I just dont see it happening and will remain pessamistic until i see evidence and results rather than a new concept car."
"Toyota has a better hybrid system where Honda has a better engine.  Reliability between these 2 brands is, especially on the hybrids, is almost perfect.  They all run despite their owners maintenance and treatment of these vehicles.

Your argument for better mileage is mute.  It never was that much better (if you wanted a hatch with the best MPG you got the original Honda Insight) and now with series hybrids and full electrics there is no Prius that can out mileage even a full size SUV like the Model X.

I think my points are valid outside ""I hate the way it looks"" and I also hate the way it looks."
"Yeah I understand that they have to prove that whatever you did was responsible for whatever you are attempting to get fixed under warranty. What I meant was that if you've been coding your security/alarm/locking module, you can't expect them to honour warranty when your door locks start popping open while you drive (as an example)."
Plus no one pays near MSRP for a 3 series
I'm not sure about the new models. I have a 2016 one and it probably had a higher base price. It does say turbo charged.

Too small for what? For your aesthetic liking? That's not objective. In what way are bigger wheels objectively better than smaller ones?

>The wheel design is very dated

>5 spoke designs are not modern

>Multi colored wheels are very dated

...so any design that doesn't adhere to current fashion is terrible?

>It does not look sporty

..to you. And maybe to many other people as well, but you can't just claim I'm *wrong* for liking them.

"LMAO. People like you, with no concept of physics, *think* it's bean counters making wheels smaller. What you don't know is that large wheels mean you have a small sidewall tire. The smaller the sidewall the harsher the ride, and the weaker it is, resulting in more flats."

I doubt they will sell 500k in the first year. I am sure they have enough demand at the moment because supply is limited.
"Well the one benefit of Tesla is that they operate like a startup, grinding their employees into the ground with ridiculously long hours to advance things at a break neck pace. This is not the way companies like Ford, Audi and BMW work. So if anything, Tesla is pushing these other guys hard to improve their tech quicker than if they didn't exist."
"I would if the software is restored to normal and things are still wrong.

Remember, they have to prove your changes broke something, otherwise it is still under warranty."

"lol.  Dude I posted this when the Prius came out and got like a shit ton of upvotes.  You guys just like to argue.  

Tesla is doing everything I am suggesting.  They aren't putting shitty oval logos protruding from the primary surfaces, they aren't having random vertical creases and headlights with melted fangs, they aren't using wheels from 1994, they're emphasizing horizontal lines and clean surfacing, not disjointed incoherent design language.

You just like arguing, downvote all you want."
"That's not quite what they said, they said they hope to be at an annualized rate of 500K by the End of 2018. Meaning they hope to be producing 40K+ a month by the end of next year.
Even that is ambitious though, Morgan Stanley doesn't think they'll be there until 2025!"
"Greenfields advatage. BMW and GM have captial invested in their ice tech. Its still pulling revnue and is still their cash cow. So while they can see the future they can't undercut their cash cow. So they can release incremental EVs that can out perform their current ice cars slightly but only in some places so as not to undercut themselves. So in time they can make the switch when they have to. 
That way they can point to their token efforts to show they were always on board, while not pissing of the shareholders by dropping their lively f150 sales. 
Problem is they started doing this to late (EXCEPT nissan renout).
Tesla has no such problem and thats their advatage. Not saying its enough but its something. "
Also as for the long hours etc. I work in IT and prefer to work for R & D companies anx startups. As a rule the long hours are worked because the team beleave s on the team/ company goal/ etc. In my oppionon i would rather work the hours required to make that happen than be part of some normal IT shop where my work and life end up meaning nothing. I suspect they feel something like that.
"And again, you're not giving any objective points, you're just trying to establish yourself as an authority. (And you're also being rude and arrogant)"
"Mod note: also removed.  You are very rude.  You'll get a temp ban to learn your lesson to be cordial in discussions.  If you don't think you can do that, I can make it a permanent ban."
"You laid it out very nicely. But I would suggest that once they start feeling the pinch in their market share as they are about to, you've got an inflection point and they will pivot and take EV's more seriously. Hopefully that will lead to better offerings 3-4 years down the road and at that point they have the resources to easily catch up with Tesla."
"At the end of the day, we're all just making widgets, not curing cancer. Even Tesla.

Agreed especially for the europeans who have a bigger market in china and have Tesla nibbling on their lunch.
And thats another issue. Sooner or later the koolaide gets spat out.

It would be funny if you upgraded your battery and if you drive your friends tesla it releases the bigger battery only when you're driving. 
"My buddy just bought an X and is getting a 3. 


Think how cool this is for a family of 4 drivers sharing 2 Teslas. 

One day you'll be able to go to San Francisco and rent a Tesla and when you get in it will know who you are and become ""your"" car. 

Think how important that is now when you get a new phone, to have everything transferred right over. 

As cars get more and more sophisticated and have more an more tech it will be SO much better to be able to get into a car and it have your settings. "
"Ok, now hang on. He is literally going through our list now! I'm so excited this is finally happening. Although the actual feature request was store settings on USB, the cloud idea is way better.

"I like how he subtly denounces stupid marketing buzzwords like ""cloud""."
"So in a car, which settings would you really want customised to you?

Apart from seat and mirror positions, and everything in my phone (contact list etc), I'd really want my music selections and radio stations. But with software, what other things could they store on the cloud that you would want access to? 

(Obviously the language)"
Jesus Christ this man is completely revolutionizing the auto industry in every possible way
"I love how features like these keep coming out.  Here is a feature request. Put a small port on the front of the car to plug in a 7 pin trailer brakes plug.  Make it so rvs or trucks too can flat tow the car.  Make it so when the trailer brakes are activated it only engages 
Regen braking otherwise it's in free roll.  Would be so nice to go on an RV trip and everywhere you go your battery is getting charged."
"Just more support for the push to ""cars as a service"""
make it open-source and put it on a blockchain like Etherium or something
"I wonder what this means for the $5000 autopilot/EAP upgrade option?

If you buy this option for your Tesla, will you then have access to autopilot when you borrow your friend's (or spouse's) EAP-disabled Tesla?  

At that point, if you resell your Tesla, trade up to a newer Tesla model, I wonder if autopilot/EAP comes with you to your new Tesla.  Maybe it won't be passed on to the buyer of your old Tesla, who will have to purchase it again for $6000 from Tesla..."
Finally! Such an obvious move.

This is actually ingenious idea but uhhhhggg what if the internet goes down? Would I have to manually adjust meh seats ? "
Am I the only one that doesn’t like the sound of this? I’m growing more concerned about how much of the car is accessible via the internet.
"Hey, another Elon tweet talking about future features, while his backlog of past statements of things that are absolutely going to happen very soon but never did sits completely ignored and neglected.

But this one is totally different, mmmkay?"
"You're not using the ""cloud"", you're using Elon's computer. "
"So happy about this because every day I get rid of the old Tesla and buy a new one, and it's a pain having to reconfigure every flippin day."
Imagine a time when government can hack your autopilot to kill anyone they want and make it look like an accident...
"This seems like a very smart infrastructure move.

Once they are self driving you could hail a Tesla ala Uber and it's tailored for you. "
Do they they already have this like a black box recording all drive data
"too bad my base model model 3 will not have automatic seats adjusted, so when I hop onto another loaner, it won't be adjusting my seats."
What sort of info and settings?
You might want to contact the Sia team 
Until killer robots destroy the internet. 
/r/iota
Guess we're planning on getting driverless taxi's sooner rather than later. 
I wonder if they'll be using Microsoft's Azure servers?
"Hope they use blockchain tech, so it's decentralized , and harder to hack."
"But this makes too much sense. Everything Elon does is so... not human. Humans are selfish, humans wreck the world, humans don't care, humans are lazy, in it for themselves, always out to screw each other. I am used to the world fundamentally not making sense at every turn."
"This will have a huge positive impact on our business! Return customers, and customers who already have Tesla's will love them even more! "
Unless of course you don't have a signal which is not that uncommon in a lot of places.  But the fanboys around here will just ignore that and believe everything Elon says.
"Srsly...I want to know how his mind works. I never got into a car thinking, ""Boy, wish my bluetooth could sync up so my seat and mirrors would adjust."" He's already in 2050. We don't deserve Elon. "
"One step closer to the ultimate ""Zipcar"" network.   Won't even require self driving to be incredibly useful/profitable."

Centralized control. What could possibly go wrong...
but why? I don't see what kind of setting you would store... seat settings? lol that would be so over the top
"It's a terrible idea.  Most of the US doesn't have ubiquitous, always on internet available.

Put storage on the keyfob and sync settings to that.  More likely a user will have it on them and they won't be subject to random internet dead zones."

"I literally was going to post something like this. Ie, when you get for example FSD, you still can access it when you borrow someone else's car (or participate in ride share), or any other software features, such as battery capacity, ludicrous, EAP, supercharging etc etc"
"Fantastic feature! 
A little sad about the buyers  (including me) who will miss out by not purchasing the $5000 premium package."
This is fucking dumb.  I hope to God Elon is smart enough to make this feature optional and non-critical.  The day my car won't start or drive because Teslas server goes down would be the day I sell my Tesla. 
Cloud != Server
There really aren't that many settings you can have in the car to make this ground breaking.... its not like a phone or a computer where everything is tailored to your needs.  
How predictable. More unnecessary cloud infrastructure for a market which would be better off without it.
Sure it's not skynet?
What other tesla would you be driving. Clearly that article was right. Also what a huge over reply from musk
And one step closer to the return of the Reapers.
That sounds terrifying.
I would pay my friend 50$ for his password then. 
You wouldn't download more battery.
">  it will know who you are and become ""your"" car.

So I'll still have that coffee stain on the passenger seat? Nice touch, Tesla!"
"> Think how important that is when you get a new phone

I drove a loaner Model X on Friday, and it took me less than 5 minutes to go over all the settings and get it all to my liking. It doesn't compare to a phone, especially if you have to transfer data as well (such as contacts).

I'm still excited about this feature, though!"
What settings are being saved? People sound like this is an amazing advancement but is it just remembering how far back your chair sits?
"my car comes with two key fobs, each tied to a driver profile

no cloud necessary"
"It's just like iCloud backups. I love it when I lose my iPhone, all I have to do is sign into iCloud and wait for everything to download, and it has everything just the way I like it."

Thing is, I would never trust an online service for this. Ever."
Not too long till the Tesla Semi comes out. Then you'll relax.
You can't blame Tesla for that. 
"Psst, hey buddy!  Want to buy some Tesla enlargement pills?"
"Can you explain why ""the cloud"" is a marketing buzzword?"
"As someone who works in Iaas(Infrastructure as a service) and Paas(Platform as a service), cloud has a specific meaning.  

A cloud abstracts away concerns from the customer.  Previously, a cloud generally described Iaas, which means a customer needed to have no concern at all over the underlying infrastructure, i.e., virtual servers, virtual storage.  Consuming an Iaas cloud, means I can request a specific type of server, and it will be ready within minutes or seconds, rather than having to purchase a server chassis and physically plug in components.

Now, clouds can be used to even described Paas solutions, where the underlying operating system and core dependencies of an application are completely abstracted away from the customer.  In a Paas configuration, I can take an application, deploy it to the cloud, and not even have to care what kind of operating system or virtual machine it is running inside of.

TL;DR:
http://hostingadvice.digitalbrandsinc.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pizza.jpg"
"""Cloud"" is a perfectly valid term, not a buzzword, at least in the context Musk used it.

Because, what would you use instead, ""a server""? That's just one specific implementation of the cloud which is not even correct in this case. The data could be distributed across Tesla's servers and disk arrays, Amazon Web Services and cached at Google's CDN.

So instead of specifying all of the technical details, which may not be even known, you just say ""the cloud""."
"You can hardly call ""cloud"" a buzzword anymore. It's a pretty well established concept."
Excellent touch. Lol. 
"I think he denounced CPO as a way to avoid saying ""used."" ""Cloud"" isn't a sterilization of ""online."" Neither has any kind of leg up over the other. They mean the same thing and are interchangeable and neither has any kind of bad connotation. "
"Navigation history. This is what I miss most when I have a loaner Tesla.

Climate settings, which with the Model 3 will include vent direction.

Depending on how they've implemented keyless locking, it might be possible for your phone to unlock a loaner without any manual setup.

Center screen layout (and Elon please will you add a pref for those of us who *hate* the full-screen nav mode? I put my nav on the bottom pane just to stop the icons from disappearing, but it tries to move it up top every chance it gets).

Charging prefs, including start time per location (and please make range charge a one-shot setting!). Actually please let me tell you my TOU plan for my home chargers so the car can determine when to charge without making me read inscrutable PG&E rate sheets."
"In the future, auto driving features like how fast to accelerate and slow down, distance to keep, etc."
With a feature BMW has had for like 5 years?
Such a specific use case for a very small minority of users. I would never need this and I still really like that idea. Seems like a better solution even if most won't need/use it.
"Except this feature is not out. It's tweeted, not implemented. There's a huge list of tweeted things that have never shipped."
"Cars as service?  What is that, please?"
"I'm sure they would only disable your car for good reasons.  Only if your charging bill is late, you insulted Elon, or you were speeding."
"It helps abstract it for technological dumdums as well. A lot of people just shut off and refuse to even attempt to understand anything technical sounding. Cloud though, that doesnt sound scary at all!

How many times do you change cars?  It only needs to suck it down to the car when you change cars.  It still will have profiles as it does now.  The cloud (ugh) is the backup or for when you want to use that data *elsewhere*.
If the internet is down your car just won't unlock
there are always risks. nothing is impenetrable. Tesla has some of the best engineers working on the security though. and always listening closely to groups that try to hack teslas  and is always patching the security holes as soon as they're found. 
He never said when. Just that it's on the list.
"doesn't have to be government. 

how about hack your autopilot and make it look like your fault."
I noticed that Elon thanked MSFT Azure for an OpenAI project. I indeed wonder if and which cloud Tesla uses...
"At least for Model 3, the phone will communicate with the car via Bluetooth.  It's possible a local version of your profile can be pushed that way if cell service is not available.  Also, your own car would probably cache the settings anyways; that's an easy fix.

But the haters will just ignore that and shit on things for fun..."
Chill. Not everything he writes are his ideas. Remember he has an army of geniuses working for him. He is taking center stage because he understood what Jobs got decades ago. People love mesianic figures. I love the guy too but I try not to be blindsighted.
I'd imagine once you're in a car that is entirely controlled from one central TouchPad it's going to be little things you don't realize yet.  A bit like using your home PC versus logging into a public machine.
Have you heard of caching?
BMW has this feature and it lets you import/export settings via USB as well.
"No. It is clear that electric seats are in the premium package only. There are other settings to adjust, wheel, screen UI etc."
[deleted]
"I imagine it would be stored locally on any car that you own as well. Also, the settings being missing wouldn't prevent the car from starting."
My guess is the system will be redundant so your settings are saved to the car and will work without constant access to the server.
"That's like saying the day my iPhone loses signal is the day I sell my iPhone lol. First, you won't. Second, what's the difference between that and your battery being dead or a flat tire, you going to sell the car because of that too?

Of course, it's just settings and i'm sure they will be local as well, but just for the sake of argument."
I avoid electricity for the same reason.
it's not skynet ... that would be google.
The servers at SpaceX are called Skynet.
Teslynet!      .....Sorry 
Loaners when yours is being worked on etc 
This points to ride sharing. 
"Maybe you, your wife, and a kid all 3 have Teslas. You could get in any one of them S, X, or 3 and have it adjust to your profile."
You might be driving 50 different Teslas. This wouldn't just be for *owners*.
In case you lose your Tesla or drop it in water and you have to buy a new one  
"Ok, but wtf happens when the cloud is done?"
There are many SX owners that are getting a 3 as their second car
"Don't be silly. Ideas don't have to make sense, they only have to be different."
“It looks like you’re already driving another vehicle. Would you like to disable it to continue your journey in this one?”
The Buttscan-3000 cannot be hacked.
It worked like this in Black Mirror.
"Off the top of my head, probably things like seat position, steering column position, side-mirror positions, regen braking aggressiveness, creep/no creep, regular driving mode or distance mode, etc."

This is for it you transfer cars. Tesla cars have a lot things you can set on the huge touch screen. It will be nice for that to auto sync.
Tesla key fobs are getting phased out. Those are going to be collector's items pretty soon. I'm sure soon the S and X will move to phone based keys as well. 
Yup. Ive had the same ring tones and shit since the iPhone 4.
You need to come to grips with the future. 
You can't tell me that your contacts aren't in the cloud
More like climax
Doesn't that get unveiled next month?
Microsoft offered us a tour of their 'cloud' datacenters in Chicago. Pretty sure it looks just like every other datacenter on the planet.
"Because ""the cloud"" is actually just somebody's server farm. They're called ""the cloud"" to make online services sound more special and magical.

You're not uploading copies of your data to Microsoft or Google, you're storing things in The Cloud^(TM). How is it not a marketing buzzword?"
The cloud implies a separation from hardware of the type Amazon does.  But for something like this that is totally unnecessary  for a static individual set of data 
"Cloud Architect here.  Really, the technical term for the cloud just means that instead of managing your own physical servers to do things, you're renting someone else's in a data center.  The privacy concern is valid, but a huge technical advantage is that you have access to a near infinite number of servers that you can scale up to in seconds.  The real innovation today is in the ""server-less"" world, where the datacenter handles all the servers for you, and you just give it code to run.

One popular ""server-less"" service is S3.  It's used to store all your dating profile photos (as an example).  As a developer, I don't want to worry about which hard drive it's on, I just want S3 to store them for me.  So S3 automatically spreads your files across hard drives across the data center, and knows exactly where they're stored when you want to swipe on them.

But of course, execs love their marketing BS, and corrupted the meaning of a beautiful technical concept."
It's meant to gloss over the privacy and security issues with storing your files on someone else's system.
https://www.xkcd.com/908/
Because half the time you could say 'online' or 'the web' and it would be the same. 
[deleted]
"Because not everyone is familliar with servers and how they work, so uploading something to ""the cloud"" might be easier for some people to grasp."
"Exactly - for all we know, Tesla already keeps its data on AWS or Google Cloud, and likely does its machine learning there, too."
I never give up.
"It's not a bad connotation, just an unnecessary term."
"That's a great idea! I like speedy driving, and the girlfriend gets carsick. Specifying a less intense autopilot setting when she has the car would be wonderful. "
How on earth have I not known about this feature for 5 years? So BMWs upload their driver profiles to a central system and you can just sign in to it from any BMW?
"You have to initiate transfer, while in the Tesla it would be get in and the change is immediate."
"""Here's a feature request"""
"""--- as a service"" means that the end user doesn't have to pay the fixed cost for the service they're getting. In this case, to get somewhere on a car, you only pay the variable cost + a bit extra, instead of increasing in an entire car."
Less requirement to own a car and instead just rent them.
"Cars-as-a-service is the idea that you would pay a set monthly cost, say $800/mo for premium, and have access to a fleet of cars at your disposal. If one day you wanted to take out a Corvette, you ring it up with your app. If you need a Minivan to take the kids to soccer, ones shows up. Instead of having to own a car, park it, clean it, etc all of that would be taken care of for you. 

The self-driving economy will mean about 60% fewer cars are needed because they sit doing nothing 90% of the time right now. "
"That's where every time you ride in a car you have to: load and unload all of your personal items, charge it, play is that mayo or semen, and deal with animal hair and smoke from the previous user.  I can't wait to have to wait to get picked up to go anywhere for only $800/month."
"Cool, he solved a problem for 25 years in the future.   Meanwhile AP2 owners still wait for AP1 parity and windshield wipers."
And the fanboys will believe in unicorns if Elon says they are real.
Let me live my life. 
"Do we know that standard has manually adjustable seats? The wording for the premium package just says ""12 way power adjustable seats"", which could mean that standard still has power seats, but minimal forward/backward and seating angle adjustments. "
"I have one with the competition package. Has manual ""speed cloth"" seats. Was an extra option.  "
"Knowing BMW, I wouldn't be surprised if they are optional. "
No the actual settings won't be but a lot of this IOT stuff requires a connection to the server as part of the boot process and will fail if that connection isn't present.  If Tesla does this it'll be a huge setback for what they're trying to accomplish. 
"Thats how many building security systems work.  The list of ""permitted"" fobs is cached on each individual swipe controller, so if someone swipes and the link to the central server(s) is down it still knows to let you in."
The difference is I can fix a flat tire and a dead battery by myself within an hour meaning I can call my boss and say hey I'm gonna be a little late today.  With a server issue it's anywhere from 0 minutes to half a day and no way to know how long it will actually be. 
"Yeah but people are far more trusting of tesla than Google. All seems to fit the bill really with tesla, company coming out of nowhere and it's branches taking over several key industries from space travel, automotive industry and now construction. Tesnet will rise!!!! /s"
"Some network not beeing skynet because some other network would be skynet, thats something skynet would try do convice you to belife. "
"Google is everything. If you own a company that relies on sales, Google owns you. "
"Nice try, skynet!"
Coincidence that Elon and Larry are BFFs? I think not! 
What about when they merge with Amazon?
Yet Elon hates AI... that's ironic.
And rentals when travelling
"yeah the tesla network is ride sharing.  That's what I was saying.  I guess the person mentioning loaner cars has a point, but that seems pretty limited use case."
"In case anyone hasn't heard - Tesla has already shared some of their Tesla Network vision. Part of it sounds like it is roughly a self-driving Uber in the end, exclusive for Teslas (and they've said that the car owners may share in the profit). It's not entirely clear to me if Tesla owners may get some kind of exclusive access/benefits, or if it's simply as open to the market as Uber. They'll do it in part because they expect self-driving cars to lead to better vehicle utilization, and hence less car ownership. They need their own network for future viability/growth (having you as a loyal user of their network is the real profit driver and assurance of need for more production once your rides are all commoditized - most people take whatever's close/cheap) and they're forward-looking enough to be strategizing for it today. It'll also make the cost of Tesla ownership lower over time, since you can profit from it - and they've stated that this is the plan.

Just sharing this point in case anyone thinks what you're saying is just speculation - it's actually public knowledge.. although Elon is very much a visionary the vision only makes sense after a few major future developments occur - and so the story doesn't filter down into the media very well."
First world problems.
"Heh heh. I can just see valets able to have their own profiles so they can adjust the seat and everything to their specs. Maybe they tap the keycard to unlock the car and then tap their phone to the pillar to configure the car seats and so forth. When the owner gets back, the settings revert. "
yeah it has to be car sharing
You change the settings when you get in it?
Yes
"""Upgrade to a two vehicle plan for $34,999"""

"I'll come to grips with it if 9 companies out of 10 wouldn't snoop on me with their ""online cloud services""."

"You're missing some important historical context.

TL;DR: A ""cloud"" is a pool of servers that can be automatically provisioned via an API, and billed by the minute.

*The Story of The Cloud*

Before 2006, if you wanted to provision a new server you had to email  customer support at your hosting provider. Maybe there was a form you could fill out. Some system administrator at your hosting provider would see a notification, go figure out which servers were free, assign one to you, email you back a password, or copy over your public key onto the machine.

If you had a responsive, 24/7 provider, maybe this takes 30 minutes. Often it would take a day or more.

Not only that, but billing was daily or even often monthly. If you were expecting a big press event, you couldn't just request 100 servers for 24 hours, and then spin them all down when your traffic went back to normal. You'd have to pay the whole month. Or if it was daily billing, you'd often have to pay a fee for each new machine you had set up.

Meanwhile, at Amazon, Jeff Bezos decided that, for some reason, every individual team at the company needed to act like it was a separate entity. Need some code that processes photo uploads for the Amazon Store? Needs to be a standalone service that any other team can submit photos to for processing. Need to expedite packages to Air Freight? Needs to be a service any team can expedite packages through.

Every piece of infrastructure needs to have a programmable interface that you can use it through.

Including, as you call them, ""servers"". 

So the team at Amazon that was setting up servers, and answering all of those emails for teams, assigning a dozen boxes here and a dozen boxes there, Jeff made them write a programmable interface, so that instead of filling out a support form, teams could just press a button, and have however many servers they needed assigned to them, within minutes.

Amazon programmers loved it, and it became obvious that programmers outside the company would too, and so they released EC2, the **""Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud""** as a product in 2006.

And it was glorious. Startups stopped buying huge blocks of servers ""just in case"" they go into Good Morning America and had 10 million people trying to access their site at once. They just provisioned a couple boxes from Amazon, and if they needed 100 more for a 12 hours, they'd just  push a button, copy over their code, and then 12 hours later push a button to decommission them. Then they'd be billed for 100 servers × 12 hours.

\* * * *

*Epilogue*

Of course, there's a reason why so many people think ""the cloud"" is Pure Marketing™. As more and more ""cloud providers"" came online, it became the cool new buzzword. Companies that weren't even web hosts started referring to their products as ""in the cloud"". You started to see ""Your contacts, in The Cloud!"" and that kind of thing. And people like you, /u/zurohki rightly pointed out that this was nonsense. Your contacts are on a server. Your photos are on a server. Your customers don't care about how the server is provisioned.

Larry Ellison came out hard against ""the cloud"", mostly because his product offering was built around single giant database instances. He had no automated provisioning offering, so by decrying ""the cloud"" as nonsense marketing bingo, he tricked a few coders into turning away from the idea that there had been a major change in provisioning, and not all providers had made the transition. This bought him time to get Oracle's automated provisioning product up and running.

This was a good play on his part, because nowadays *all* provisioning is automated, and so looking back on history its as if nothing happened, and cloud never meant anything. [This is water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcAhZ5JzYJY).

That dude is a bastard. Smart, but a bastard.

Don't be like Larry Ellison. Know your tech."
A cloud has been the symbol used in software system architecture diagrams since at least the 1990s. I've never considered it a buzzword. It's just what people call a collection of remote services.
"I was a ""Cloud"" Technician in 1999. All the cloud deployment models (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS etc) were possible before it was a term. I don't see why we needed a term for this. Where I worked, we used to sell anything from virtual machines, physical servers, database accounts etc. All these were running in a virtualised infrastructure (ok, maybe we switched to this in 2001). What is different now except scale?"
So why would someone go with a CDN instead of S3 then?
"> and corrupted the meaning of a beautiful technical concept.

I hope it doesn't go too far as latencies and sheer bandwidth transfer will always ensure it's a slower solution than local processing. "
How does one become a cloud architect?
On the other hand it concentrates the privacy and security issues most business can't or don't handle into more capable hands.
Because small to medium sized business are super NetSec experts and trusting their security to real experts would be a terrible idea?
"About a year ago, working at a company that has everything in AWS, a developer copy/pastrs some debug output into a public gist. He didnt realize that the dump contained an aws secret key.

AWS emailed the account root within an hour with the gist url and the identity of the key. I was floored. People accidently copy/paste passwords all the time. How often do you get an automated notice about it? 

Putting your eggs into a basket that really does security correctly is fantastic."
"What issues specifically? I would imagine AWS engineers designing the security of S3, for example, are more experienced in the field than the average developer creating their own file server."
"How are those words any better? Cloud is fine.

Even the web is taken from nature, as is the cloud."
"But anyone can have on-prem physical servers and be ""online"" or ""on the web"".  Isn't virtualized instances with all it benefits different than just being on the web?"

"Wow you're assuming the Tesla programmers are pretty dumb. The FIRST thing this subsystem would need to handle gracefully is ""what if my server goes away"". "
"No it doesn't. There are lots of places in the country where the car doesn't have any cellular data connection. Do you really think that it requires communication to a server to boot properly? That's factually incorrect. All that will happen if there's a server problem is the car will day something like ""Driver Settings Unavailable"" and you'll have to move your seat yourself like some kind of peon. "
A lot of this IOT stuff doesn't make sense without a web connection anyway.
Why wouldn't it have a local cache? That's pretty basic.
"That's evading the point. I don't mean a dead battery in your driveway where you just plug it in, i mean somewhere you can't charge it. The point is sometimes things don't work... differentiating because it's offline or physically broken defeats the point of owning a connected car."

So you're not using a smartphone then?
"People think ""the cloud"" something special and different and new when it's just rooms of servers like every other company has been doing for decades"
"Neither do they...

Sure it looks like any other datacenter, it is one.  The what and why that makes it a cloud, is the design, infrastructure and architecture behind it all.  

Any single component can fail and nothing is lost.  The computations are spread across multiple CPU's, across multiple servers, across multiple racks, disks, drive chassis, and eventually datacenters.  There is no single or even handful of points of failure.  The data and results are never kept in a single place, so you can lose a drive, a CPU, a server, a rack of servers, scaling all the way up to losing entire datacenters, without losing data.  You will lose capacity, increase latency, or lose bandwidth, but the data is fully redundant.  

It scales as needed based on design and how intensive the workload is.  Scales down to save money (pay by server/processing power needed) when under less load."
"Yeah as someone else said, ""the cloud"" is just a term for renting someone else's servers instead of using your own."
"Thanks for writing this. People who don't work with distributed environments don't seem to ""get it"", even many programmers (surprisingly)."
"Never heard anyone before correlate the means of provisioning servers with name such the cloud. If that's the definition you want to go by that's fine but I don't think most anyone thinks of that. 

Not to mention it's silly to make a new word for automated server provising unless you are looking to create buzz. "
"The marketing buzzword part is where people started talking about the cloud as though it was something real, rather than just a shorthand way of writing ""we're not talking about the details of this part right now""."
"You might be thinking of **distributed mainframes** aka ""the cloud"" aka any distributed platform since about forever. Yes, these services have evolved, but they are also fundamentally the same as ever; a bunch of servers and disks in one or more places linked together via the Internet. "
So how will you describe your work if you don't want a general term. Do you describe every detail and functions every time you need to tell someone what you are doing. A word is invented because there is a need for it cloud is good term for layman without getting lost in technical details. If you tell them that their data is on the cloud they know that someone is taking care of it.
"This is off-topic and not something I know much about, but S3 and a CDN (like CloudFront) have complimentary roles.  S3 is where you as a developer put your files, then CloudFront takes care of duplicating those files across servers across the world, and distributing them to the user (faster than S3 might be able to on it's own) "
"You need to understand thermodynamics.

Jokes aside, you need to have programming experience, knowledge of networks, databases, distributed computing, (likely) Big Data, and I'm sure I'm missing a few core skills b/c I'm not a cloud architect, but I sit ~10 meters from folks who work with them. :)"
"Lots of experience with AWS, Azure etc. There are certs, but it's still just a job title so experience is what it takes. "
Become a developer and then get put in charge of architecture for your cloud infrastructure.  The title is informal.
Yeah AWS is great in that regard. They save a ton of money by preventing account credentials from leaking because they generally won't charge you when someone spins up 100 large instances with your stolen credentials.
The people at the hosting company having access to your files.
Virtual severs are in most places with a systems administrator now. I have seen small offices with four servers go virtual. Pretty much every big company uses virutalization. 
"Not saying it makes sense but a lot of people have no idea how the internet works and for them it's just associated with their browser om their computer.

Wow. I mean, BMW's iDrive has always had the reputation of offering a lot of advanced functions that practically turn your car into a computer game, but I'm kinda impressed they had this way back then."
I wonder if they have it auto push/pull new settings or if it's a manual thing.
"Self driving is much closer than that, I think. There's so much big-money financial motivation to make self-driving happen, I expect legislation will move quite quickly once the technology holds up. "
"I expect the technology and legislation for level 4 will be ready by 2020 in CA. If the deployment of model 3 goes as planned, Tesla will have enough data to pursue legislation in terms of safety enhancements saving thousands of lives. "
Source?
Not necessarily. Look at how the 0-60 for AWD and performance Model 3 are conveniently left off the S vs 3 comparison even though both will be available next summer. The S is still the fastest but showing only the standard 0-60 on one side vs the quickest on the other is purely to upsell the S. It very well could be the same thing happening here. 
They thought they could program away the need for an $8 sensor. Obviously they don't always make the right decisions 
I never said the car wouldn't start without a connection to the server.  I'm saying that Tesla should not make a car that requires a connection to the server to work.  
A lot of the IOT stuff doesn't make sense even with an internet connection.  Very few of the internet connected things are actually improved with an internet connection.  
I like the idea of the car being connected for updates but I hate the idea of the car needing to be connected to work.  That's my only point here.  I don't want to spend several thousand dollars on a car if it stops working because Teslas servers go down.  I'm not claiming this is the case just that if it does turn out that way it will be a very bad move by Tesla.

"I believe it has quite a bit of merit. 

It may not be flawless, but to say it 'makes no sense' or 'hasn't been well thought out' is inaccurate. 

* (Arbitrary numbers) if each car costs $100 to produce, and can generate $50 in revenue by sharing. It takes them two years to recoup their investment. If they can sell the car for $150 and generate $25/year, and give the owner $25/year, they recoup their investment and a profit in the first year. 

* Even if it all breaks even by the unit, by giving a percent to their users/owners/drivers, they might get a smaller piece of a bigger pie.

"If we assume it's a ""race to the bottom"" situation, a company that chooses not to take part in the race won't do well if they're too slow to strongarm it to an end while they're leading. I think it's a good idea to try and prepare to be competitive if that's what may happen.. and then if they choose to be bastards in the long run like most corps, they can still lobby in their own favor against public interests in the hopes of maximizing profit - but only after they're a Goliath. I basically think Tesla's still an underdog, so this is a way to undercut the big guys and beat them at the new game instead of the old one - but that's my two cents. I look forward to not owning a car and not needing to park or drive.

You may be right that it would ultimately make more sense for them to control the cars themselves. That occurred to me as soon as I heard the plan as well. However, they need to transition us to the new system somehow, and we're currently still buying and driving our own cars. I would assume they'll be continuing to monitor how things are going (in terms of progress and public opinion) and will be ready to adjust their plans if/when appropriate. Helping buyers profit from their cars when not being used themselves is a natural step in the plan before self-driving is mature and the network is still small."
"It's a good idea, though I am kind of doubting the implementation.

This is essentially ""franchising"" the ride sharing business. McDonald's is profitable, but instead of collecting the revenue themselves they sell you the business."
I live in the first world! This is relevant to my interests!
Just get them to buy their own games and then it isn't an issue... 
">A- you can use a keycard that you keep in your wallet for valets and backup. 

So basically the same as a keyfob.

>B- you can use ANY smart phone. Just install the app and login. 

That still puts you in a clinch if you're alone. Sure,  it would be alright in most situations, but a major pain in the ass in some.

Complete reliance on a phone is just a bad idea. If your phone fails you on a trip you absolutely need your car. Wether the back up system is on your keychain or in your wallet is fairly irrelevant though."
">Obviously, you'll be able to use the car. Come on.

Then obviously they're not gonna phase out the keyfob and replace it with a phone app, because that would lead do me not being able to use my car.

I have no idea what your quote had to do with that."
"Considering thumb drives are already much smaller than car and house keys? Why not?

Edit: of course the answer is no. That doesn't mean I have to like these services."
"Of course they would all move in that direction. And that's not all they'll do given a chance.

Once teslas become popular enough, we'll figure out a technical solution for it. (Thank God for the hacker culture) No need for any usb. You can store it all in your own personal cloud."
"But ""the cloud"" doesn't reference the actual, physical storage, but rather just idea that is isn't depending on your device. A lot of devices will use both local storage and servers to function, but if you tell me that it uses ""the cloud"", I will immediately understand that the specific device is irrelevant. It's not a useless term."
"> The what and why that makes it a cloud, is the design, infrastructure and architecture behind it all.

No.

The term ""cloud"" has been used about any kind of mundane remote storage or processing. If your two bits of javascript in a browser sends text to a server, which then stores that as a plain text file, which you then could retrieve again later through the same bit of javascript, that was at one point suddenly called ""cloud storage"".

Arguably, running a remote X-Windows program on a UNIX user terminal from 1985 against a similarly aged mainframe could 10 years later be marketed as a ""client-server system"", and 20 years later be marketed as ""cloud computing"", because the user interface is separated from the hardware it stores information on, just like web apps.

Such architectures for remote storage or processing have been around since the 1960s, and that includes when what's happening server side is quite a bit more complicated than what's going on in the client side.

But, using ""cloud"" as a buzzword started being used for doing stuff remotely around when AJAX became a thing, so salesmen could repackage and sell you the same old services with new ""web 2.0 apps"", and it annoyed the hell out of a lot of people back then."
"Not even necessarily, you have both public, private, and hybrid cloud situations."
Yeah why don't more people know this?
"Using modern terminology, to a technical guy, I'd say I was doing ""dev ops"". To a non-technical guy I'd say I was an infrastructure engineer. "
"How realistic of a threat is that? They have a very clear and profitable business model - companies pay huge amounts of money for the storage. 

Also no matter where you store sensitive data, it should be encrypted or you're asking for trouble."
Virtualization alone isn't a cloud. Cloud is virtualization as a service... most often an application specific service.
"Almost no non-technical person uses the term ""the cloud"". The term is used by technical people and by people in tech business when they discuss their services/needs. Think about it. As I said before, people just use the name of the service (gmail, Facebook, reddit, dropbox etc), rather than anything else. Where the data is stored does not matter for the non-technical user, as long as what they're using works."
/r/HailCorporate 
Can you elaborate please? What sensor?
"Yes. That was the implication I was responding to. The map doesn't work if there's no connection to the server. Neither does the trip planner or the radio. I don't understand why you're frustrated with the concept of conveniently transferable user data that would happen not to function without a connection to a server. None of this means the car ""doesn't work"" without a data connection. Just that some services would be unavailable. "
All wear hair nets! 
Depends on the privacy agreement. We are getting way to comfortable giving away all of our personal information to private corporations with no real oversight.
"I do think about things like that: Autonomous buses that use A* or whatever to find the most efficient route. They'll have the smell, time delay, and danger-from-violence of buses now just without a human driver.

(Not everybody will be able to afford a daily private autonomous car.)"
"Where and when I travel daily is a big one. My contact list from my phone is another potential one (they probably don't currently save that). The driving details would be worth a lot to insurance companies. Tesla is public, so there's no guarantee that some a benevolent as Musk will always be in charge."
"IDK if you follow Tesla the business.  But everything they do loses money.

This is a company that has gold medal in the cash burning Olympics.  You don't think they would put CapEx into a 50% margin cash cow?

The reason Elon puts out these ridiculous ideas is to pump the stock and deflect from the hot mess that is Tesla.

"
"With the exception that MCD is also selling the consumables to the franchise on a day-to-day so MCD has a good cashflow stream.


Its more like Uber/Lyft except the revenues comes from selling cars vs operating the infrastructure.


There's a lot of problems w this business model.

The major problem is scaling.  Why would the consumer use the Tesla network as opposed to Uber/Lyft?

The novelty of robocars will not supersede fare price.  So then without customers whats the incentive for entrepreneurs to use Tesla vs Uber/Lyft if their imperative is to earn money from ridesharing?

The model only benefits consumers who want to by a Tesla anyways and trying to subsidize the cost thru this network.  But its a terrible loss for Tesla.  So how long can Tesla sustain the losses of running this network just to sell cars (at a loss already)?"
"I don't mind sharing as he shares his with me, it's not an issue often at all because I work nights and he works days, but my library it's several hundred games of which I play one or two frequently, and a ton he's interested in so I don't mind sharing, his is only 15-20 but all AAA titles I enjoy. it saves us both money in the end, even if I do occasionally get booted, it's worth it"
Honestly don't understand Tesla's thought process here... A deeicated device specifically designed for the car makes more sense. 
How is it a bad idea? We're always with our phones. What are you scared of?
Obviously there will be a workaround that won't leave you 100% needing use of your phone. COME ON. That's NOISE bruthaaaa.
"Cause that's simply not the way it is going to go. 


I know it, and you know it. "
This guy gets it.
"Things were in ""the cloud"" before the term was widely introduced. For example, and from the user's perspective, gmail existed before ""the cloud"" was popularised, but now everyone refers to gmail as a ""cloud service"". From a technical point of view, virtualised infrastructures, automatic resource allocation etc also existed long before the term.  
I said it is a marketing term because it was indeed popularised by marketing efforts like Amazon Elastic Cloud."
"Not saying the term is always used correctly, but categorizing how MSFT's CHI datacenter isn't really a cloud datacenter is a gross misunderstanding of how the company does Azure and what cloud computing is.  My breakdown is highly accurate, considering my profession, background, and employer - you can choose to disagree with me, but I actually know what I am talking about.

Certainly there are those who choose to rebrand something new, hearkening back to the ages of AS/400, SNA server, and pre-Windows. "
"On the back end though it's the same idea. Whether it's AWS or Azure or a proprietary server farm in the middle of the desert, it's all just warehouses full of computers"
"I don't think it's a realistic threat, but that's the concern people have and the reason why words like ""cloud"" are used for marketing."
Most people think web/datacenter=cloud. I have a buddy who runs his small business the old school way. Physical servers that he owns running in a third party data center. He has to handle all of upgrades/patches. Need more performance or capacity? Servers have to upgraded.  I told him put his crap on the cloud.  He told me he's is and has been on the cloud for years.....
"I think it was a rain sensor.  It came up in the post regarding automatic sun roof closing when rain detected.

One model had a sensor, the one without would need to use its camera?

I don't recall accurately though."
Umm I believe in my original comment which was so hated  I said only that I hope Elon is smart enough to keep this feature from requiring a connection to the server.  Jesus I love Tesla as much as the next guy but I'm not going to immediately get all butt hurt over even the tiniest of criticism.  Not everything they do is gold. 
Wall ear hat reins!

And what nefarious purpose could the do with your car settings? Paranoia is a thing.
Blockchain ftw!!
"I'd be shocked if Tesla engaged in this kind of thing, so far they seem to be benevolent. 

That said, the corpus of current Tesla owners represent lots and lots of money. Being able to mine their favorite radio stations, driving habits, destinations (which stores? when? what % go to the local game?) even if anonymized would be very valuable to marketers. Especially if anonymized information were available such as gender, age, education level, profession, etc. Tesla would easily create such a dataset and sell it if they wanted to, but hopefully they won't.

Maybe not as much once the model 3s are in full production but even then I'm sure the data or metadata will include which model is involved. "
Traveling salesman is a million dollar problem. It's probably not going to get solved ever.
"Oh, I see."
Lol wow. /r/conspiracy is leaking
"I'm fairly certain Tesla will take a 30% cut and run the infrastructure at a profit, just like Uber on a day to day business. 

I do agree that there really isn't a case where Tesla > Uber for the consumer, so Tesla will have to somehow have it be cheaper vs Uber. "
Can't you both just use steam family sharing?
Fair enough. I suppose if it's mutual that makes more sense! 
Lotsa bitter VMware guys around here eh
"> My breakdown is highly accurate, considering my profession, background, and employer - you can choose to disagree with me, but I actually know what I am talking about.

So do I with my background.

The use of ""cloud computing"" is pretty much never accurate. It cannot describe a relationship between computers accurately. Doing something ""in the cloud"" doesn't magically make things better.

But, it's used in a way that makes people perceive something mundane as a new thing. Trying to use it in software patents, for example, as something new is a real problem."
"That's true, my circumstance is just that it isn't necessarily someone else's hardware. You can have multiple data centers spanned around a state/country/etc for redundancy."
"Yes, even a hosted server in a datacenter isn't really cloud... cloud implies a level of service along with the infrastructure... and that's really the lowest level of cloud. Most of the time cloud refers to an application specific service, like backing up your phone, or storing driver profiles. That includes hardware, virtualization, distributed application services and all of it managed."
"Yeah, tesla engineering removed the $8 rain sensor that worked perfectly fine on older models with a view to replace the feature using only the cameras.

 The sensor is back for the model 3 it appears but there is still 30k model a and x drivers who haven't got the functionality of auto sensing wipers that was advertised as being available in 2016 when they bought the car.

The only issue is that tesla can't seem to get it to work, which suggests they removed a feature without even checking they had the data they needed to replace it - that's quite a bit of engineering arrogance imo and shows they don't always think before they do something. So to claim that designing the system to fail elegantly would be the first prio isn't necessarily true. 

"
"I don't think anyone is suggesting that. I think they're suggesting that you're overreacting to how this feature is apparently going to function. The reality is we have no idea how this will work yet. If it's totally cloud-based, I imagine the areas where you will be picking up a car that isn't yours (e.g., service center or a Tesla dispatch depot) will have adequate connection. If not, I'm pretty certain there's going to be a solution. "
"What about when and where you drive? What stores you go to? Even if they don't sell this data to marketers, they will get hacked eventually."
"Wait until a scientific studied determines the temperature you prefer while driving is an indicator of heart failure.

This also gives police identifiable information to tie drivers to vehicles.  Get ready for subpoenas that say give us the driver information of the 4 red model S that crossed the intersection during a given time period."
"They might know how warm i like my seats, thats personal."
"You know it captures a lot more about you than your seat position, right? Like when and where you drive, which would tell someone what stores you shop at. What does it capture when your phone connects to the car?"
"Big data AI would have a field day with all the data a car could capture, and Musk is the one warning us about it. What happens when he gets forced out or leaves? "
"If they can generate revenues without drivers.  Why do they need you to buy the car?


They can just build the cars and let the cars collect revenues from fares.  Its better than their current model where they lose money on building the cars because of all the SG&A expenses


Musk stated publicly that Tesla Network will be cheaper than public transport.  This is why you can't take the guy seriously.  A MTA subway fare in NYC is $2.75.  The avg NYC taxi fare is about $15 (so Uber is prob similar).  There's no way they can get that down to $2.75 without losing a shit ton of $$$.

Everything that comes out of his mouth is to pump the stock price.  He's never accomplished anything he's promised.

If you didn't know already he gets paid with stock options on milestones based on $TSLA stock performance NOT business performance

BTW Uber is not profitable either.  Another bloated tech unicorn

"
"That's what we use to share but only one game can be played per account at a time

Family sharing is more designed around everyone in your family having separate accounts and not multiple computers."
"Family sharing is also kind of dumb in that only one game per account can be played. So, if one of you has hundreds of games while the other has one, I hope one of you wants to play that *one*. It doesn't work like with physical media, where you could play one copy *of each game* at a time. Family sharing in that sense would make a lot more sense, I'd think, because then everyone in your family would actually share one combined game library. It would be like driving to the library to check out a book and having them tell you, ""Sorry, we rented out one book already today to one of your neighbors. Once they return that book, we'll let you look at the millions of books on our shelves. Until then, please wait outside.""

So it's not ""game library sharing"" so much as it is ""you can play on my computer while I'm not playing"". The only difference is that you can play ""on their computer"" on your physical machine instead of on theirs."
Not sure what you mean ...
Do you not carry a phone with you?
"Yeah,  and?"
"Again, so what?"
"> He's never accomplished anything he's promised.

Never?"
"Each milestone has both a market cap and operational component. At the moment he's reached all the market cap goals. His next target is to improve gross margin, and then the two targets that follow are to produce a lot of Model 3's. To build Gigafactories and quickly ramp up Model 3 production, Tesla does actually require absurd capital - and so pumping market cap serves an important purpose. They can more easily raise capital through equity and/or debt with a higher market cap - and they have done both quite a lot. So an odd truth is that if the market cap weren't so high, the chances of success would be considerably lower.. and so ability to prop up value and keep confidence is essential when pursuing expensive and audacious goals that take time to bear fruit. As I've said before, those who remain invested with him expect him to put out some hype - because that is what is necessary under the circumstances.

As a lot of people see it (myself included), Elon Musk is the poster boy for achieving audacious goals. The Tesla Network is an audacious goal - so if we're going to make predictions by who is at the helm, that ought to be a consideration. Even just the fact that neither Tesla nor SpaceX (electric car company and private orbital launch company respectively) have gone kaput is totally absurd.. and then you look at the fact that he's got Volvo execs saying their top competitor is Tesla (partly because of Tesla's safety, on top of everything else) and they're going to have to go all electric, while his rockets are routinely landing on autonomous boats. It's bloody ridiculous. However, his timelines have often been an issue - he rarely meets his publicly-stated timelines (for example, the Falcon Heavy is years behind schedule, and the schedule has been pushed back many times in an always-coming-in-six-months fashion). I'll admit that it is in part his track record that has caused me to generally expect him to accomplish the gist of his goals by this point (except for the timeline), even though the past isn't always a good indicator of the future. Most experienced people will find that the past tends to be a more reliable predictor than reasoning from first principles, so I'm not particularly ashamed of it though. I seriously don't understand the ""Elon is a fraud"" meme that's all around (which often comes along with unfounded accusations of him living off of government handouts - despite the fact that Tesla is constantly at war with car dealership and anti-solar interests in many states, and SpaceX had to fight back after they got locked out of military launch contracts in shady fashion). If reusable rockets, an SUV beating sports cars off the line, major car producers in a sweat, military launch contracts, and promising self-driving tech aren't enough, then I don't know what it would take to prove otherwise.

To address the business model part - I can't help but reason that any competition who chose to stick with the traditional model of selling cars direct to consumers may find themselves even more royally screwed than those who build ride-sharing networks (since if you try and look ahead a couple steps, it seems likely we won't be needing as many vehicles anymore).. so I'm not sure I see the point. It's necessary to prepare for some inevitable changes of the future. It turns out that drivers expect to get paid for their time, and AI's don't.. and so self-driving is going to bring a world of hurt to Uber (with drivers), truck driving, much public and charter transport, and a whole bunch of other things. Not having to pay people makes things cheap."
"Tony Seba and Larry Burns, two researchers on transportation as a service, both believe that fleet services will be able to operate at costs / mile below $0.20 (to operate, not to the consumer).

If that's the case then certainly Tesla will not be competitive producing Model Ss or even Model 3s new for fleet usage, since their luxury features will be overkill for most trips. So they wouldn't be cost competitive with other cheaper and more specialized cars that will be produced later. So that model wouldn't work. 

If they do want to create their own network, they'll have to create a dedicated platform for doing so, either micro cars for urban transport or multi-person shuttles that would offer more competitive cost per mile. 

However, I do think that *used* Teslas could be competitive from a cost per mile standpoint, since their owners could effectively convert their old(er) cars into full time fleet vehicles instead of selling them. A Model 3 with 75,000 miles on it in 5 years still has a lot of miles left, but its owner might be ready for another vehicle. They could simply put it out into service to earn $40-50 / day (~50-70 miles) until end of life with a $1 + $0.30 / mile pricing to throw out some numbers.

Because they have presumably already made the Model 3 ready to use as a network vehicle, they could effectively turn hundreds of thousands of Model 3s into fleets all across the country with zero capital outlay over a 1-2 year period. 

There are a lot of unknowns about the model and I agree with you that Tesla could not produce a *new* vehicle of equivalent quality to the 3 that could compete with the NY Subway system (note public transportation is unusable in much of America because of lack of population density), but I do think a critical component of this program will be *used* Teslas. Will ride sharing be totally commoditized such that the price per mile is so low no one will use Teslas, or will  they be able to offer *cheap enough* cost per mile that it still offers a pleasant experience at a lower price than ownership for many? Those are the interesting things we'll learn I guess. "
"Its a joke, buddy."
"I kind of trust Musk not to use or sell the data collected in ways I don't want.  But he will not run Tesla forever.  Even if we assume that we can trust Tesla in perpetuity with this data, they will eventually get hacked.  "
"I kind of trust Musk not to use or sell the data collected in ways I don't want.  But he will not run Tesla forever.  Even if we assume that we can trust Tesla in perpetuity with this data, they will eventually get hacked.  

You should operate under the assumption that any data you give to a company will eventually be either A) sold on the open market; B) stolen by cyber criminals; or C) used by the company itself to market to you.  I don't know exactly what data Tesla collects, but I'm sure it tells people a lot more about you than you would expect."

Let me rephrase that.  He's always underdelivered what was promised 
And... I'm failing to see the danger here
So I assume you don't use a smart phone then.
Fine. You're paranoid. I get it. 
If you can land rockets on a barge in the middle of the ocean only then you have the right to belittle his accomplishment. It is pretty clear you can't compare you can't even understand why letting Tesla owners pay the capital cost of building the Tesla Network is better than acquiring the capital to have enough cars for the network to function. You know building cars is costly but you want Tesla to build all the cars then slowly wait to recover the cost from rides fare when they can sell the cars to owners and recover the cost so they can build more cars. They will earn more profits because they can grow the network faster. You need money to earn more money. Tesla + Owners money is greater than Tesla only money.
[deleted]
The OPM (Other Peoples' Money) angle is a good insight. Tesla's risk (and required capital) is greatly reduced if they don't have to buy all those cars themselves and wait for it to get paid off.. so it's a much safer way to begin even if things look bright and settled. Perhaps they've learned a lot from SolarCity (I keed - but Tesla bears may enjoy framing it that way).
I think you should just quit using all electronics. Only way to be safe

Nice false equivalency
"[I'm a big fan of the white on dark sport rims.](https://imgur.com/8peUHmv)

"
I'm not a fan of blue cars but I'm drawn to the one with the silver wheels for some odd reason
"I'd get the black on black in a heartbeat, and bonus is the standard configuration.

I don't get all the aero wheel hate, they obviously serve a purpose for range, and they look cooler than the regular alloys it looks like you can get in any car these days"
"I also made this bad 30 second Photoshop of what the Aero wheels would like if they were a little bit lighter, and I wish they actually looked like this:

http://i.imgur.com/pliNiqA.jpg (real wheels on top, edit below)

Maybe they'll look lighter in real life?"
"I think I am stuck w/ black on black. Can't justify 2.5K on cosmetics that also decrease range & ride quality, however if we see serviceable wheels under the aero-covers I might lean Red. "
"I've obviously been driving cheap cars for a long while (as in, <$10k) - bc my first reaction to learning that the aero wheels cover is removable is to plastidip the covers to a darker color for the black body."
"From a mega-fanboy's perspective....

I'm so perplexed that Tesla could produce such a beautiful car, and then just absolutely gimp it with those wheels. The whole selling point of a Tesla is that it's finally an electric car that looks like a real car and not some cheesy chintzy sci-fi knock-off. Those aero wheels completely ruin the look."
Anyone know the efficiency difference between aero and non-aero wheels?
Midnight grey with black sport rims =💣🔥💙
I feel like the aero wheels go better with the darker color while the normal wheel fits the lighter ones.
no green?! what do car companies have against green ><
"For people wondering about the color/appearance of the Aero wheels, they are dark gray, almost a perfect match to the Midnight Silver paint option. 

These pictures are slightly pre-release, so the color MIGHT have changed slightly for production.

https://goo.gl/photos/TsiK4vjkKVQWXJieA

https://goo.gl/photos/DBoDswk6w1htrkhx7"
"The black wheels only looked good on the matte black car.   
If the point was to force people to buy the upgrade, well done."
Anyone know what the wheels on the left look like without the cover?
"If you're like me and think the aero wheels are hideous and the sport wheels are ok, not great; just note that you can get a set of aftermarket 18in forged wheels that may match your taste better for far less than the $1500 and you won't need to sacrifice range. Of course you still need to pay to install them if you don't have the tools/knowledge but you can definitely come out ahead when compared to the sport option. Also, later in the production ramp Tesla will most likely have additional options"
"What's the name of the darker grey? I love that color.

Also, which wheels are which?"
Which are standard?
"What I want to know is... why are car color options always black, grey, grey, white, red, blue now? What about yellow, green, purple, or any number of other colors? Didn't the model s have more color options?"
"Are the Aero wheels actually black?  They always look dark grey to me.  They match the Midnight Silver IMO, makes the Black look weird."
the wheels on the left are horrible. look like honda civic hubcaps
"I don't understand why there are so few colours. Dark green would be nice,dark red, bright yellow etc"
Wish the ten spoke wheels came in black as well. Red body paint and black rims would look so good
"My god Tesla needs to broaden the palette a bit. These colors all look great and classy, but they're boring. I'm not saying they have to go add hot pink, but some interesting/unique colors that are still tasteful would be nice. Even some brighter colors. We all have different personalities, and sometimes I feel like these colors only cater to a small subset of those personalities."
Can you do this also with interior? 
"Decisions, decisions."
Thanks! I didn't have time to go back and do the sport wheels last night.
Mas sexy!!! Mas sexy!!!! Mas sexy!!!!!
"4th down on the right.  

You will be mine."
That blue and silver is a sexy combination! That'll be my first choice. Second choice will be black on black on black
I bet green would look pretty rad.
I honestly can't pick a favourite!! Tesla makes every color look fantastic!
That black on black is sick. 
"I like the aero on the darker cars, I like the normal on the lighter cars. "
"My two cents.

White, Red, Black, Midnight - Aero Wheels   
Blue, Silver - Sport Wheels

Now this isn't necessarily because the Aero's look great, it's mainly a dark color wheel I'm talking about."
"So $1500 aside, and little less efficient on range, can anyone chime in on what the cost of ownership would be for the sport wheels over the course of five years vs Standard?"
"I actually like the cheapest one the best, hmm"
I'll just go ahead and ignore that that left hand column even exists...
The silver wheels make such a difference!
"I guess I'm another one in the minority who is digging the aero wheels. They remind me a bit of the [previous gen GTI stock wheels](http://www.cstatic-images.com/stock/900x600/251384.jpg). I also really dig them on the white body, creates a cool contrast. I think that's my combo (for now.)"
Those wheels on the left just look awesome. Are there any disadvantages to having wheels like that? I just never see anything like that on other cars. At least that I've noticed anyway 
"Thanks, I will take one of each. "
What's up with the wheel issues?
White with aero wheels please. 
White car black rims looks great 
The only car that looks good in silver 
"All the cars on the right (silver wheels ) look better with the same paint, is that a manipulation of the brightness in the photos or because they wheel color affects how we perceive the paint color? 


someone with some Photoshop skills want to weigh in?"
"Midnight Silver Metallic with 19"" wheels is hard to beat"
That red one looks fantastic 
"Beautiful front, weird looking back though."
no matte finish :(    I don't like the darker colored wheels both in design and in that they look like hubcaps.

Too bad everyone is going to get black because you have to pay $1k for any other color

The bright colors look better with the black rims.

Collect the whole set! ;)
Looks like an Austin Martin 
So I don't know much about cars or wheels. What's the difference between the two kinds here? Is one bigger (and why? (if it is))? Or is it just color?
"How hard/rational will it be to paint the wheels aftermarket? I dislike the black wheels under a silver car, but not enough to pay 1.5k and the downside to the larger tires. 

So, talk me out of after-market painting (of the wheels alone)."
Interesting. The company I work for manufacturers forged aluminum racing wheels and we have actually recently released an aftermarket wheel engineered for Tesla. Looks awesome and in my opinion significantly cooler than the factory options. 
Are the ones on the left standard? They look pretty ugly IMO.
This car will bankrupt the company 
White wheels would be dope
Those aero wheels are hideous. The dark color only makes them worse. Blue with the chrome wheels is my favorite.
which black coat doesn't cost the $1K upgrade?
I really like them all actually. 
The wheels on the left are no bueno
Looks great. I wonder if they'll ever come out with a cheaper model that I can afford.
The one above blue in the right side.
Love the black on black. My choice. And will get it wrapped in black rose. 
"All black with dark aero wheels for me, since it's the cheapest option 😂 and actually goes together
in a futuristic ""Tron"" sort of way."
Which wheels are better in snow?
"Ugh - when did Ford become the only car company that has interesting colors?  Mini used to have vibrant and fun colors, now it's all the same grey, grey2, grey3, white, red, and black like everybody else.

Blargh, these are all just so bland."
"Are the aero wheels 18"" only, and the Sport wheels are 19""?"
Amazing! Any plans to do the aero wheels without covers?
Would love to see the same stack of colors with the base wheels and hubcaps removed.  Anywone have this?
"Just saw a white in person today, i dont think i like it, the white shown above has some fancy shadows and stuff to it, in person its super bland looking, almost looks unfinished, far different than the black one i saw, i might have to switch my order to silver or midnight silver."
"Are the 18"" a single bolt or 5 bolt?"
"Nope...this just makes the color decision even harder...I just can't decide.  

Edit: thanks for the downvotes. WTF? "
It would be ludicrous to get the aero wheels and wrap them in plaid. 
Looks like an ugly Porsche 
"Ooh, boring colours with ugly wheels or boring colours with not so ugly wheels. "
What's the MSRP? Asking for a friend. I barely make 1000 a month lol
"God forbid you offer other colors. 

What if you want one in green? Or purple? Or Orange? Yellow? Nah.  Who would want that?"
"If I were to buy a Tesla off Amazon, would it be under Cars, or Technology?"
I'm already sick of this car. :/
"Wow, that is a ugly car. "
"Still not sure why they decided to make this car so ugly when they clearly have the ability to make a good looking car (Model S). 

"
[deleted]
This.  I wish the sport wheels came in black.  Add a chrome delete and it's good to go.
Same rim and red paint is even better IMO! Also I hope the other prototype rim will make into production very quickly! https://c.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/tesla-model-3-17-1.jpg
"Would Tesla service centers be able to swap out the Model S sport rims onto a Model 3? They're also 19"" right?"
"That's incredible. It's a photoshop, right? How close to the actual pearl white is that?"
"It's what I want but I think I'll regret 19"" rims on crappy Michigan roads"
the reason is because it looks amazing. thats the reason. welcome to the blue club
Cuz it looks like it belongs in every ad Ford has put out in the last 15 years ?
"Nothing odd about it, it's just basic color composition: Silver and blue (or black) go well together; silver and different shades of gray not so much because they're close but not the same so you have an awkward low contrast. In a vacuum, the better fit for red would be gold but you can't have golden wheels without looking like a douche so that's not an option."
It's sexiest IMO
It may be the silver wheels shine making them more white in this photo light setup. White and blue pop as a color combination. the other combinations don't have the colors that compliment each other. e.g comic books with a few base colors often use blue/white background/foregrounds 
"same, i've never liked blue cars but the blue tm3 looks amazing"
Because it looks amazing.
Power of tesla design :)
I used to own a BMW 5 series that came in a very similar blue with silver rims. It looked so classy. I think it’s just 2 very nice colours that compliment each other that aren’t the typical black/white.
What is the added range? I can't imagine it is actually that much. 
The only real argument I've heard against the standard configuration is that it's really hard to keep the black paint clean.
"I think the prototype aero wheels looked so much better than the current ones. They had lot more black and less gray. Now they flipped the colors around and also they get rid of the carbon look. http://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2016/03/Tesla-Model-3-wheel.jpg

"
"Agreed, the darker aero wheels looks a bit odd now "
Light gray plasti-dip can be had for less than $50 for the wheels.
The darker the better for me
"Much much better in silver. Currently, it reminds me of the space grey version of the Apple Watch, which doesn't pair well with any of the band colors other than black."
"Would you be able to Photoshop what the Black and White Model 3 would look like with Sport Wheels changed to grey, similar to how the Model S has it on the 21"" turbines? "
"My hacked-together contribution:
http://imgur.com/ZlfBrsi"
Still not great but definitely better!
"Getting anything other than black on black costs 2.5k extra?

Sounds like black on black it is then."
I've seen those too. Really hoping the 'aero' part of it is a removable cover on top of decent looking rims.
"Personally i really like the White paint with 18"" black wheels."
So... wait is it basically just a crappy steel wheel with a hub cap? 😱
"I don't think the Aeros have removable covers, there was speculation a while back but I seem to remember recent photos of production cars suggesting otherwise."
Or a shiny silver
[deleted]
"The problem is not the shape of the wheels, the problem is that they're two-toned in a way that makes the shape look shit. [This](http://labs.web3d.co/_tesla3/) configurator posted earlier allows you to see the wheels in one tone, and they look a lot cooler."
"Yeah, I agree, but as others have noted before, it's probably done so to tempt more people to upgrade to the sport wheels."
"Hideous. 

Especially in person. 

I was shocked when I first saw them first hand. 

Hubcaps on a $35k car is NOT ok!!!"
Almost like they want you to upgrade and spend more money 
Sometimes I feel like the only person who couldn't give less of a shit what wheels are on my car 
Are we even going to need wheels in self-driving mode?  Elon himself said we won't need a steering wheel. 
"Well the good thing is that you have options. I do like the aero wheels, serve a purpose and look original to me."
aero makes it go faster or some kind of science
"I think they look okay from far away, though I wish they had a darker spoke option for the 19""."
"It's just like a 5 spoke wheel, but inverse. The negative space is filled, and the space that is usually a metal spoke is open.

I think it's a clever way of doing aero wheels that will be copied in the future."
i need to see the aeros in real life. im torn.
"It's also the first run, and they're trying to make as many as physically possible. Wheel options are probably limited due to this."
I've never seen a painted wheel I like. And these aero wheels are atrocious.
"I agree. It's great a lot like it, but it pushes their margins making more people opt for the $1500 upgrade rims."
Coff coff Prius 
"I dunno.. my girlfriend thought the sport wheels looked too plain. I have to agree. They're fairly boring, especially for having to pay extra to get them."
"Agree.   The 19"" stock rims remind of those terrible, late 1990s rims you'd see on your local 1991 honda civic with the fake tinted windows and different colored spoiler.  The 18"" rims look like they go on your grandma's Chevy malibu that she drives 2x a year on Easter and Christmas.  

Everything else is fire.   "
[deleted]
5% extra range I think. So about 10 - 15 miles
"Yeah, I feel like I'm getting bargain getting to go with aero wheels on my midnight silver. "
[deleted]
"And orange, and purple. The 3 rare colors."
Does anyone know what ever happened to the matte black car? Was hoping to get that color option..
I think they look great with red as well.
[This is the rumor](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QWHj9Vi2F_rWMhcM3s4TD7hqNdGx5Pr7Io_5gYTcjSsPUMF9gk-HZtOdotjNb5hsRtGW3_z6SWCY7VqXhNdAf9I8T1_qef260O5Tw7TYr6Ez9-4AEI-Kh8wikSaQX6C3Jrop97EO2TZLTHjGpALU_50yPb4ML8RVze_KGzjuN7rveFoe2shu0SRYOcfkfCGdft1ZirtlaxRaFcqCgrpWO1hvpuZLwStFBHscMV_WjYmiF2OwWsB4pdd5TZKGT3doqours07Uo7KYJtxMHAT5e8iEtfTTitGbmvpo7546A1jHfcEGhpMBOgFYmBKXEiHcPdRx94hUtXouygBL8d6l1jvxN2X5dRs5LGmCmtT8q81bfsRbiSHroZeDVC95ZlUpgDPzMtwZ_drIFHo5284vM2O9bL5gytqgdokeZK3HIz_TNEsj2dvODRSbtfU6dflRWnrRKL4cGasJYwVIbWU2TIWOMdYI8T8gwUkvO0OFRJaEEmbOmxtGors7nKN5fgVR-_QrDTQtkc_Gv1hbxLkb9VkP-uVy1-0x090yKj_EJQhHx25bPfaDvwlRSgSLKHH_c-Gmdc4fCBDX7Idy2v-zxNU4tn0veCtqzUX3rBilVKwg3Y1IWonR_rT5UBvFFkLbQ2JZL20_2I5lTXIZGJVIVKb29-lAL-4xXLJlOQhlWyY=w1024-h605-no).
"Standard Aero wheels on left, sport wheels on right.

Paint is Midnight Silver Metallic"
"Top left is standard, black and aero wheels.

Other paints cost $1000, sport wheels on right cost $1500."
"Those colors rarely get ordered, and it adds a lot of manufacturing complexity. I bet they'll add options later, but for now smooth manufacturing is key."
"Probably the most popular colors. Most buyers don't want a yellow, green, or purple car, so manufacturers don't make them often, especially when cost is a factor. "
Basically anything that isn't that doesn't have enough demand to justify doing it outside of custom jobs
Don't forget orange.
They're grey.  Terrible choice.  Silver clearly matches every color better.  
Nah - you can actually buy a Civic. 
"The more options, the more headaches for manufacturing. "
"I agree and would love a green Model 3. 

Unfortunately painting vehicles is one of the most complex parts of vehicle assembly, batches of vehicles are made in the same color. To switch paint colors you need to bleed and clean the lines that feed the robotic spray machines. In order to make as many vehicles as quickly as possible Tesla chose to limit the number of colors to increase batch size and limit the amount of time spent switching colors.

Usually companies add colors to increase demand of a mature product. For example the iMac color, the ipod color, etc. Tesla will add more colors when they need a way to increase demand."
You could just do a vinyl wrap. I think a really good one that is just 1 color with no extra bits like decals is like 3k for a good job. I've heard they can last over 5 years if it's not a shit job. Definitely cheaper than getting it painted. 
You could paint them or plastidip them for much less than they would charge to sell them to you black
"Truth. I feel like a burnt orange would've been quite nice.

"
"I don't think there are good identical shots of the interior with different options (I don't think there are any shots anywhere of the non-premium interior).

If / when there are I'd happily throw them all together."
Why limit yourself? Get 18s for the winter with some winter tires and 19s for the summer.
The only other cost of ownership would be tires but thats really up to you on how much you want to spend. I don't think there would be any other change.
"You don't see wheels like this very often because the primary advantage is lowering drag, which is pretty valuable in electric cars. The Aero wheels add about 4% to your range, according to Tesla and independent tests done by Model S owners when a similar wheel style was available on that car.

Also, because they are 18"" (The sport wheels are 19"") they should offer a slightly smoother, more comfortable ride."
You must be really young. Grey wheels will have the same fate as chrome wheels a few years ago. Short lived trend. 
[deleted]
Just did that [here](https://redd.it/7aaqt7)
They'll offer plaid paint option once they unveil the Model 3 with Ludicrous mode.
"Eh, the Panamera might still be the ugliest car ever. This doesn't even come close."
The only ugly thing is the aero wheels. 
"What's ugly about the car, except for maybe hubcaps?"
The configurator screenshots page has them all individually if you'd prefer: http://imgur.com/a/7VVtz
"I'm strongly considering gettin the sport wheels and having em painted/powdercoated/whatever they did to make em pretty like that.  

I was right along with ya on the chrome delete for the full on stormtrooper look, but the sheen on those wheels match the chrome nicely. maybe its just the lighting.  "
#
They could or any tire shop could if they have the same lug pattern (probably all Tesla wheels have the same). Changing wheels on a Tesla isn't any different from any other car. Idk if they'd sell you Model S sport rims though so you might need to buy from a third party.
"Bigger wheels increase weight, lower the vehicles efficiency, decrease acceleration, worsen the ride quality, and you pay more when it comes time for new rubber. I'm not a fan of anything over 18"". "
"I'm with you (but in Western NY); I'm thinking of getting the 18"" aero rims from Tesla, grabbing some aftermarket 18"" rims and using the stock ones for winter 

edit: added a word"
"Any idea what specific tires are used in the 19"" wheels?

How about the 18""?"
https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/18-or-19-wheels
"So get the 18"" wheels, and buy 18"" aluminum aftermarket wheels. 1500 will buy you a LOT of really nice choices. And then you can have separate winter and summer sets for dedicated snow tires. "
Ha I showed the wife and she said you can't get the blue one it looks exactly like your Ford Fusion 
I would MUCH rather have [THIS](http://www.tran-zam.com/1979/Gallery/79TAMayanRed-Gold.jpg) than any of the Tesla 3s pictured.  
It's between that and the red for me
"Somebody said 5%ish, but I don't think they had a source. Either way, it's highly dependent on what kind of driving you do. They make almost no impact on city driving, but if you're up over 60mph they help quite a but."
"""really hard"" is a bit of an overstatement. My current car is black and yes, you DO have to wash it a little more often but it's not a big deal."
"Yep, those look much better. If it still had those, I'd be OK with leaving the aero wheels."
"Wow, I've never seen those.

It'd be super simple to get that same look with some [carbon look viny](https://www.amazon.com/3M-CF12-BLACK-CARBON-FIBER/dp/B0058DIDTY)."
They likely will have these down the road but limited configurations to help scale production... one year form now will have so many more options!
why did they not launch with that?
Man actual CF wheels would be awesome. Minus the ~$15K price tag.
Those are a lot better than the current offering.
The only one that they look good on is the grey car third from the bottom.
Makes them look like hotwheels cars
"Different paint color is 1k, sport rims 1.5k"
1k for not black paint. 1.5k for the sport wheels
Based off the wheel designs of other hybrid/electric i would say its highly unlikely. Steel wheels are really heavy and would kill mileage. Most use alloy wheels (some even forged) with a plastic cover to be as light as possible.
> So... wait is it basically just a crappy ~~steel~~ *looking* wheel with a hub cap? 😱
"many modern cars have alloys with hub caps. Fusion, Prius...RAM"
Same here.  There are dozens of us!
"I have to admit they are growing on me. Also, something about the fact that they are different appeals to me. "
"Yeah but he's a mega fanboy, his opinion carries more weight"
Yea they look pretty cool
Same. Initially didn't like them but their futuristic look is growing on me. 
TBH before the reveal I was almost hoping for spats. 
"Or to make people consider aftermarket options. Personally, I don't like the aero wheels but I don't want the 19s. I'm going for the aero wheels and will probably buy aftermarket 18s."
"I suppose, but it just seems like a bad idea to me (a marketing genius I am not) to have cars with ugly wheels like that rolling around town or to be a purchaser's first impression. "
if the aero wheels were also in white it would be perfect.
This car is all about aerodynamics
i don't give a shit either.
Longer
For sure. The upgraded wheels probably cost them less than $100 extra to manufacture which means it's almost pure profit.
British racing car green. 
"same thought it looked amazing, disapointed it is gone   "
I hope it's true.. these wheels look really good for base stock imo
Can someone with Photoshop skills show us what these would look like with lug nut covers? 
"I would like to think they'll add more options later, but I sincerely doubt it. The model s once had a wider array of colors available. Now it's monochrome, red, or blue.

Honda claims, for example, that the most popular color for the Civic is grey. Except, when the 2016 Civic first came out, all you could get was black, white, or grey. It took 3 months before the blue ones hit the market, and even now they hardly make any. It seems likely ""popular"" colors should be more properly defined as ""common"". I find it hard to believe people are walking onto car lots thinking, ""you know what I want? A grey car. I love grey. It's so cool.""

But maybe that's my bias against grey speaking. When you deal with reduced saturation in colors everywhere due to depression, you start wanting more color in your life."
Is it really that most buyers don't want them or that most cars just don't come in those colors? The last three cars we've had only came in the same array of colors as the Model 3 has and I have a tough time believing that ⅔ of buyers want monochromatic cars.
"Haha, I had a coworker with an orange car years ago. Sometimes I see that same orange on another car and think it's hers"
If they made a v8 maybe I would get one
"Yeah, that's what I'm looking to do as well. Only problem is that you have to get rid of the 18"" stock tires... I think I'll be fine with 18"" aftermarket summer wheels and 18"" aero winter wheels."
Im talking wear-and-tear as well as replacements. Aren't you more likely to get flats with performance tires as well?
The larger wheels on the S wear much faster (sport tires) so they are much more expensive bc of time between replacement is less. 
I actually had not noticed the darker grey of the wheels. I had only noticed the different design of the wheels.
Exactly.  Black looks better AND it's the only free one.  So now everyone is going to have the same color car.  I wish they would change this
What?? I think the red looks fantastic! 
"Oh come on, with [cars like the Multipla around](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Fiat_Multipla_silver_front.JPG/1200px-Fiat_Multipla_silver_front.JPG) the Panamera isn't even in the running."
"The grille blank is ugly and the roofline rear end with a lack of a trunk deck is ugly. 

It reminds me of the ugly GT 3 series BMWs which are obviously the ugliest of all the 3 series BMWs.

Well it's photoshopped so sheen is put in by that. The chrome and door handles are also made black in this.
They would need the same offset as well.

"Goddamn, you're so right I even hate the 18s on my current car, love the 16s on my suv"
Looks 10 times better with 19's
"yeah but you are forgetting the most important part of 19 inch wheels, they look a shit ton better than 18, design aside, but personally I think the 18 design is atrocious "
WNY native here too -- wonder how many Tesla's we'll be seeing on our roads 
Yeah I started looking at aftermarket rims the other night but didn't find any I liked.  You find anything yet?
"I wanna believe they have a big impact, I really do... but the fact that every single F1 car (the cars with the most advanced aero in the world) have classic hub and spoke wheels leads me to believe that any claim they make a meaningful difference is simply good marketing buzz words doing their job well. "
"Disagree. Have had a black car. Currently have a pewter dark grey car. They show dirt instantly. Silver and lighter color cars I've owned look clean for noticeably longer. Dark cars will look clean for 2, maybe 3 days before it looks like it needs another wash. The dew condensing on my car in the mornings is enough to let streaks of dirt show by the time I reach work. "
"Those look like cool aftermarket wheels you would pay a ton of money for. No clue why they didn't keep them, they look awesome."
I'm surprised to say that but I agree!
I wouldn't recommend and vinyl doesn't hold up well on wheels. 
You probably don't want to vinyl your wheels....
"True. And I think it's because the car and the wheels have about the same colour. On the black one they still look okay-ish, but there, if they have to be dark, they're still a tad too light."
"And the matte black from the alpha reveal.   
But yeah, Midnight Silver is the only paint choice that works for me with those wheels.
"
"I have never encountered that before.  I've always seen either proper alloy wheel or super ugly, heavy steel wheel with hub cap.  Good to know though."
I believe he is confusing wheel covers for hub caps. 
Dozens!
I think they look better irl. In photos they kind of don't look real. 
"The ""mega fanboy"" bit was just to satisfy the people who get upset whenever the design aesthetics of Tesla are criticized."
"The Model S shares BMW's 5x120 bolt pattern so I'm still surprised we don't see more experimenting in that area. I've seen BMWs with Tesla wheels, but never the other way around. "
Do aftermarket wheels hurt the range?
Just take the wheel covers off.
"There is no way they intentionally offer ""bad/ugly"" options to entice upgrades. Style is subjective, I personally think the regular wheels are boring and am excited to get the aero wheels since they are unique. "
My guess is that most people will see the sport wheels both IRL and online which again increases the demand for that upgrade.
But the silver wheels are uglier LMAO
"I'm not going to down vote this because it's your opinion, but to me that sounds ugly as sin."
"from a business standpoint, its pretty damn genius. who's NOT going to pay the $1.5k for the way way way better rims? as a consumer, so so annoying, but i know i'm going to end up paying the $1.5k :(
"
"AKA Hunter Green

I agree! Just need a few [center caps](https://centercaps.net/products/tesla-model-s-2012-2017-center-cap?utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=googlepla&variant=37545937161&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7vmps8q91QIVl4WzCh1ApQQxEAkYASABEgL___D_BwE) and and maybe powercoat them black and you'll be looking good.

I just put it for center cap, leaving the lugs exposed.

[All 6 colors without the Aero Covers](https://redd.it/7adgpn)
"I can believe it. People are mostly scared of sticking out of the crowd in any way that is seen as odd, and a car is a big, conspicuous purchase which also makes people more conservative. Obviously there's probably a chicken and egg situation in that *because* red, blue, black, white and silver have become established, they then tend to stay that way. 

Same reason 98% of houses are white, beige or brown. Sure, you can paint your house yellow or pink or blue, but a lot of strangers will think you're weird and that terrifies people. "
"I suppose there are two things I should clarify:

1. I'm not in Europe, so I can remain blissfully unaware that the Multipla even exists. At least once I forget about it again, anyway.

2. The thing that bumps the Panamera higher up on my shitlist is that people still think it's cool just because it's a Porsche. Something like the Multipla doesn't have that same cult of ass-kissers."
I drove one for a few years and the spoiler was fun. Also it was very spacious and the hat back was awesome 
Yeah I guess it's a matter of personal taste. 
"They are heavier wheels and since the motor is directly connected to the wheels it takes more power to rotate them vs the 18"". And the ride quality is worse because you have less rubber between the rim and the road, so less cushion for bumps. "
"I'm not sure of the exact science behind the efficiency and acceleration but think it mostly comes weight and inertia, it's pretty widely known and probably easily google-able.  In terms of ride quality, as you upsize rims, the entire wheel stays the same size so you lose sidewalk height of the rubber.  Tire deflection is a large part of a vehicles comfort and even suspension so the lower profile tire you go, the more the ride suffers (stiffness, harshness, vibration etc.) and/or the more your suspension system has to compensate. That's actually and added con to larger diameter rims is there is generally more stress to the suspension which can increase the rate of the suspensions degradation over time.


http://www.caranddriver.com/features/effects-of-upsized-wheels-and-tires-tested"
"Google 'unsprung weight'. Weight on a car that is not supported by the suspension is much more detrimental to a car's performance than regular weight that is suspended, like say seats, or paneling in the doors. I've heard estimates that each pound reduced of unsprung weight is equivalent to 3-8 (different estimates) lbs. of sprung weight. The difference between a car that could support say, 19"" wheels, and that same car with 16-17"" wheels, could be quite significant.

My old WRX had stock wheels that weighed 25 lbs each. I upgraded to lightweight white racing wheels, 14 lbs each. That reduction of ~40 lbs of unsprung weight was felt night and day, to where I'd probably have to start pulling out seats to notice the same difference removing other parts. Never mind that changing the tires was a dream at that point, like lifting the paper."
"More rotating mass is harder to spin up I guess, but ride quality is the most obvious, low profile tires can not absorb impact as well as a taller tire would."
"I would assume the wider circumference means more torque required, thus uses more power?"
Acceleration would be covering the same distance with fewer wheel rotations.  
"There are quite a few S and X models around me, and I expect to see quite a few 3's, although maybe not until AWD is available next year"
"If you don't mind spending money, check out Fifteen52 and Rotiform. Actually Fifteen52 has some killer cast wheels that are very reasonably priced though I don't know if they make them in Model 3 fitment. 

I just looked it up, if the Model 3 is the same PCD as the S (5x120), that opens up a metric shit ton of wheel options assuming the center bore on the Tesla isn't too large. Check out OEM BMW wheels, a lot of those can be had for practically nothing ($400-$600/set) and many come in 18x8 et 40, which is pretty conservative. Pop out the center cap and put a Tesla cap on and you'll be have a great set of cheap wheels that look killer. I have a set of Style 162's that are one of my favorite OEM designs ever, but there are tons of them out there in 18"". The Style 329's would be a great match for the 3 as well."
I've only done a quick check but in general not too worried about being able to find aftermarket rims; the market is massive and there should be a ton of options available by the time AWD Model 3's are delivered..
"It's not necessarily an apples to apples comparison. The aerodynamics of an F1 car are likely very different from a sedan. In order for a sedan to have the best possible aerodynamics, the wheels would need to be covered, but Elon didn't want to do that because it makes the car look like a funny looking oddity. Aero wheels are supposed to help with that airflow. I'm no expert, but I'm guessing since an F1 car's wheels are already so far out and away from the body, having something similar just wouldn't have the same impact... As evidenced by the fact that they don't use them.

Since the aero wheel's range enhancing abilities are easily testable by anyone who gets them, it would be bad marketing to say they do a thing that they don't do. Though, so far, no official claim has been made."
"F1 cars aren't primarily focused on mileage or fuel efficiency, which is what aero wheels improve. Instead, they are focused on maximizing race performance. Very different applications."
I doubt it’s the spokes and more that they’re an inch smaller. 
"This is definitely true, but the dirt is usually only noticeable at very close range. It's something that owners are much more sensitive to than is warranted. From 10 feet away you can't really tell."
"Yea, I wouldn't do this. I'd just have the wheels behind the hubcaps powdercoated black during the winter when I put the winter tires on it."
Make that a Baker's Dozen!
"Depends on the wheel. If the wheels are heavier, then most likely."
"That will be option 1 if they are removable. Is there anything concrete on that? I know there's speculation because there were RCs with 18"" wheels and no aero covers. I'm not particularly a fan of how they looked, probably because they didn't have the center cap."
"I can understand it. I wish they were just a lighter color or darker, the way it looks right now, they just look dirty from the brake pads."
you probably want 4 center caps.
This my plan too if I can confirm what is under the caps.
"The reason they look bad is because they're black, nincompoop. They make it look like some kid's riced-out civic."
I appreciate your effort :) 
Thanks! 
"I hadn't thought of it that way. I guess I'm just so sick of grey that all I want is color now, no matter how conspicuous. "
[Some people like their cars to stand out](http://imgur.com/a/nkdLT).
"First of all, the new Panamera looks great, I can't think of that many people who doesn't like the car.

Secondly, Panemera *is* cool because it's a 5 people seating ultra luxury sedan that just lapped the Nurburgring faster than a Ferrari 458 Italia. You won't see that with any other luxury sedans."
Does it improve handling at all?
"Well, weight is a factor, but it's more about rotating radius. Having a larger wheel is like being in a slightly larger gear. The wheel covers more ground in one turn of the motor, so it is slower accelerating, as the motor is doing more work, but better for cruising, because it covers more ground for each rotation of the motor. Also, it should make bumps slightly smoother, as the bumps are smaller in relation to the wheel compared to a smaller wheel."
[deleted]
"Typically you don't increase the circumference when going to a larger wheel because you use a tire that has a shorter side-wall, with the overall tire diameter being the same.  The reason it takes more energy to turn is because a heavier wheel has more rotational inertia than a lighter wheel and the car has to work harder to accelerate.  Steady speed efficiency is pretty much unaffected though, other than the relative aerodynamics of each wheel."
"Fuel efficiency is absolutely a major focus in F1 cars. 

The cars are capped at 105kg of fuel per race with no refueling allowed. 

Yeah, they aren't getting commuter car levels of fuel efficiency, but every fraction of increased fuel efficiency they can get from aerodynamics equates to a fraction of extra power they can pump out of their engine within the fuel restrictions.

So yes, fuel efficiency is a MAJOR concern in F1. And aero drag is exponentially more important at F1 speeds than at highway speeds. So if an F1 car can't find use in it, I highly doubt a commuter car will. 

If someone shows me a study hat indicates differently I'll gladly change my mind on this one. But I seriously doubt one exists. "
I'm a car guy. I notice it on other people's cars too. Challenge yourself to find 5 dirty looking silver cars and 5 dirty black cars. Would bet you find the dirty black cars first. 
And another!
Make that an Italian Baker's Dozen!
"Most aftermarket wheels also have poor aerodynamics because they are designed for asthetics and maximum brake cooling. 

With regenerative braking your don't need to cool the brakes much."
I feel like they would have to be considerably heavier to make any noticeable difference right? I see it as like the difference between driving with something as heavy as the difference in weight vs not having it in the car in the first place. It would have to be considerably heavy to make a noticeable change in range. 
"They will have to be easily removable if they are covers, otherwise you wouldn't be able to get to the bolts to remove the tires, and from the pictures it doesn't look like the bolts are showing through the aerowheels "
">I'm not particularly a fan of how they looked, probably because they didn't have the center cap.

Yeah, that's also my main criticism of them as well.  However, I can only imagine that will be a quickly developed aftermarket part, and would be much simpler than getting an entirely different aftermarket wheel."
"Nah, 3 is definitely all you need


/s"
I bet that paint costs more than $1k just for materials :P
"It can.  Less sidewall means less flex and a more planted feel but it's not something you'll notice in 18"" vs 19"".  Rotational mass being further from the hub will have far more an impact from a stop/go perspective than you'll ever get from better turning from less sidewall flex.  It's best to have the smallest wheels possible (based on the ideal brake rotor size) and just use stiffer ties."
"It can give the impression of a more direct control since the side walls of the tires will deform less in corners compared to smaller wheels. So the car may react quicker to steering inputs. 

It doesn't mean that the car will take corners faster tho, contrary to the popular belief. "
"yes, and also the increase weight from the wheel is negated by the decreased size of the tire, if the outside rolling diameter is the same.  You're talking maybe .25 lbs per corner.


If you have good roads and like corners, smaller side walls is where its at.   

If you have potholes or gravel to go down.. its terrible."
"Yes and no, mostly aesthetic, but there can be some performance gains in terms of grip... if the cars suspension has been set up for or capable of utilizing the extra rubber. Read this link and you'll see for the specific car they tested, once they went too big, cornering grip actually decreased. 

http://www.caranddriver.com/features/effects-of-upsized-wheels-and-tires-tested"
Formula 1 cars brake A LOT more so they need the cooling.
"My wife wants me to get black w Aero, but I'm thinking silver with sport rims for this very reason - easier to maintain. I just think ""really hard to maintain"" is a little overstated, that's all."
In the model S and X some people were saying you lose around 10% range going from standard to premium wheels. 
Adding weight to the wheels vs inside the car would be like adding 5 lbs to your shoes vs 5lbs in a backpack. Much more noticeable since they are at the point of motion. That's my guess as to why it would affect range more than extra weight in the cabin.
Wouldn't the tilt from the side walls deforming change the cog so that it would more likely flip/lose traction on some vehicles at a lower speed?
"Damn, thats insane. Does it really weigh that much more between stock and premium?"
"You mean for smaller wheels? Typically road-legal tires don't deform that much, although perhaps there's a niche case with lifted off road vehicles running on small, soft tires."
The cog? 
I'm by no means an expert but my understanding of it is that higher sidewalls can make it easier to tell when the tire's going to lose traction because they deform more. Look at F1 cars.
"I think more on those models cause it's a 2"" difference. "
"Yeah that is what I was curious about. I'm not sure how much deformation there is, I've always only been able to compare extremes such as a civic si with aftermarket stuff compared to the hyundai suv. Not sure what happens with small modifications."
Center of Gravity
Center of gravity
Right. If its the same size wheel I doubt it would be that much of a difference
"The center of gravity probably doesn't shift enough for it to matter. 

Race cars in fact mostly use higher side walls than we find on road cars. "
"It's a 1"" difference on the 3 so maybe a 5% difference in range "
"Good point, though sorry for all the questions, I guess that may come down to the racing? I.e. nascar vs F1?"
"But say i opt for the stock wheels, and buy aftermarket wheels that are the same size. I dont think I have much to worry about, no?"
"When you compare the sidewalls from most luxury brands (Tesla, BMW, Mercedes, whatever) you'll find that the side walls are much thinner proportionally to the wheel compared to almost any racing category. 

It's not just F1 or Nascar, If you look at [GT3 cars](http://i.imgur.com/qzXZ0Dq.jpg) from the Blancpain endurance serie. 

The side walls aren't crazy high but significantly higher than stuff you find on road cars. 

Again, people believe that thinner tires and overall harder suspensions = better grip but it's false. It makes the car react faster to inputs, but it will lower the overall grip on a track. 

The weight transfer that isn't absorbed by the suspension (because it's hard) will be transmitted to the tires, and if it isn't absorbed by some tire flex it will be transmitted to the tire patch touching the ground, and it will eventually break traction. 

Racing is all about finding that sweet spot between having great traction but still having control with fast inputs. "
It all depends on if they weigh more. If you got aftermarket wheels that are lighter than the stock wheels there's a good chance you could increase your range and vice versa if you got heavier rims. 
Ah so the main reason F1/performance cars do it is for faster inputs? 
"Dont get lead wheels, duly noted. "
"The other way around. 

Thicker wall = more predictable car

Thinner wall = quicker input. 

Depends of a lot of other stuff too but that's the basics of it. 

This flowchart cover a lot of the ""other stuff"" 

https://imgur.com/HRmDY7j"
Haha exactly. There's a guy on YouTube that races his Model S P100D and uses aftermarket BBS wheels that weigh a lot lighter and he says it helps him gain some time. So I'm sure if you weren't street racing it could add some range. 
"Awesome chart, thanks for that. "
"As you can see, correcting oversteer is done by softening the rear end. Same for understeer and the front end. 

So a stiffer car handle worst than a softer car, opposed to what most people believe. 

It's because a stiffer car react quicker to steering input(same idea as with tires) and gives the feeling to handle better. But you'll lose traction at a lower speed. 

Again it's much more complicated than that even just glancing at the chart, but there's so many misconceptions about car handling. "

"My guess: you're not supposed to drive it. It's supposed to drive you. I'm sure it came down to the HUD costing an more money and being one more thing to warranty, break, support, etc... It's like (IMHO) when Apple got rid of the 3.5"" drive and then the optical drive. Much weeping and wailing, but it was the future. If the future is the AI driving you while you talk to your friends, you don't need it to be like an F-35 cockpit. "
"Full autonomy as other have pointed out is probably the main reason, but...

I would not underestimate the cost. First if all you need engineers familiar with this that implement it and test it. Then it increases part complexity and count since the dash and wind shield would now have to be different for RHD and LHD cars. So that's more logistics and then you have to put it into the cars which also means more people or robots on the production line. "

"It's something I dislike with Tesla atm. You go to a more advanced car and yet it's BEHIND on several things. Early Model S didn't have height options for the belt iirc. ALL Tesla back-seats have a 60-40 split instead of 40-20-40. Not only that the but the 60/40 doesn't even have a pass-through in the middle. Front passenger seats don't fold.

Iirc blind spot notification is just when you're about to do a mistake. Instead of eg. just have a light every time there's a car there. Auto-wipers/rain detection. As this thread suggests, the lack of HUD.

Then the lack of buttons is a down-grade for many. Personally I'd love to keep the touchscreen AND have a couple of buttons. After all buttons themselves don't need updates. It's all the software behind it. Maybe even programmable buttons. 

I'm sure we can make the list a lot longer as that's just on top of my head."

Not saying I agree with it. I'm a reservation holder and think a HUD would rock, just trying to figure what the thinking is. I'm sure it comes primarily down to money.  

Yeah, it seems trivial to add some kind of high output color display and a mirror or lens or whatever into the dashboard. The software would be easy, too, just send it some I2C feed of the MPH or whatever other metric you wanted to display. It's not like it's streaming HD or something. But, let's say it adds $250 to each car.

>If you really want a o make a change, start educating people on how to do it as safely as possible, just like sex. 

Ok then. If that's the logic that's being applied to this, I'm out, because that's just ridiculous."
"You are on this council, but we do not give you the rank of master."
"That actually sounds amazing, too many times have I been driving at night and the guy in front is too far away for me to see anything past ~10m in front of me, but I can't turn on my hi's because it'll shine straight at his mirror "
So basically the same deal as self driving
"Sometimes the market just isn't ready for things. 

I remember my uncle having a digital speedometer in his Lincoln in 1999 but they seemed to disappear for a while. Now they're standard. "
I had the hud in my '01 Grand Prix GTP. I miss it so much. :(
What a sweet car that was!
My 2002 Z06 had a HUD. It was a lovely shade of blue-green. The downside is that the square outline around the HUD was also always visible.
"My uncle had a Bonneville that had it too. It was so amazing! My ""poor man's HUD"" in the Si is almost as good. I'll hate going back to a normal flat dash."
"I mean, it has a plexiglass hud. It's cool, but even the CX-5 has a proper HUD. Surely they can share the parts between the card that make the HUD work, right?"
Somebody must have forgotten to tell my Mazda 3 that it was supposed to have one. That's disappointing.
Can confirm the camaro HUDs are the bee's knees.
"If it was an issue BMW, Chevy, and countless others would have pulled the HUD from their models and they haven't."
"> Try to think of it as why people couldn't understand why the iPhone had no keyboard. 

No, it's like the iPhone not having MMS when it launched and requiring a jailbreak to send picture messages. It was fixed later. "
It is not the future
HUD is a $45K option on the Model 3. And you get a BMW for free.
Thus making it a $45K option for the Model 3.
[BMW 3 series also has this for several years now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F24zGLi9X8k)
And if they don't..... More disappointment which can all be restocked with a hud
"IDK. Your hypothesis sounds reasonable, but from what we've seen from Elon, he's definitely not in this to make his billions and kick back sipping daiquiris on a beach. He also has shown pretty good insight and thought leadership. Elon isn't infallible, but the fact that reservations have only surged even *after* the no-hud reveal means that your suggestion that it's a big deal to everyone just doesn't seem to be supported by what evidence I've seen. "
"eh. simple eye movement. it's not like you're going to be reaching for the AC controls. it's literally at the top left corner of the screen.

i've had my steering wheel covering the speedometer way too many times due to sharing a car with family. no issue there."
Oh I don't think so
"It really is amazing! The system will try its best to direct both beams in a way that maximizes the amount of road and its surroundings that's lit up. To my experience using it, it also succeeds rather well doing so, with a few situations as an exception. "
[This shows it a bit better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vMIcNBfGsE)
It's going to be interesting now that level 3 is legal in Germany. No excuses in that direction anymore.
"I'm not sure about digital speedometers, but this happens a lot because the company that comes up with the idea copyrights it, so other companies can't use it until the copyright ends.   

A good example of this is mini games in loading screens in video games.  
Namco Bandai came up with the idea and patented it 22 years ago. 

That patent finally ended in 2015, so it will probably be common in games soon"
"Volkswagen did a line of digital clusters for a variant of the MK2 Golf so that's late 80s/early 90s, they looked amazing but I guess no one other than enthusiasts cared for them at the time."
"Same with my dad in his 1995 Impala! Then in 96 they changed it to an analog because ""digital wasn't sporty"" apparently..."
1989 Astra GTE / Opel Kadett was so ahead of it's time
It was a great car for sure :(
"For real, I just had to get rid of it last year.  Only had 120k miles on it but it wasn't worth anything and the AC was going to be ~$2500 to fix. Just bought a new econobox and it's not half the comfort that thing was :("
ಠ_ಠ 
Where can I find a free BMW?
What
"Correct except for the one complaint that keeps popping up is the lack of HUD. People will not cancel just because of one issue but it will  make allot of people happy and will also resolve the I can't turn my head a little argument. 

It's just the one thing that wouldn't need much""investment"" as the tech already exists. I would be absolutely stunned if this was not on the to do list for Tesla. "
"That's amazing! Thanks for this, I couldn't really tell what OP's video was showing."
"Thats really awesome, but I can't help imagine that on those bumps (of which there were several) that the guy in front was probably wondering why this guy was flashing his highbeams at him constantly. lol.

I remember reading a tech article a year or two ago about projector based headlights that would sense rain drops and avoid projecting light onto them. Essentially it reduced the amount of glare a driver would get back from their own headlights in rainy and snowy conditions.  It reminds me of this quite a bit, albeit a faster and more responsive version (and likely some huge costs / reliability issues preventing it from hitting the real world)."
"The FIFA games have done this since the PS3 era. 

Was there expansion on what constitutes a mini-game and when it can and can't be used? "
My friend owned a 2000ish turbo with all the features.  Probably the only american car I'd ever consider buying. 
"Buy a BMW 4 series + you buy a Model 3 = $45k ""option"""
"FIFA was the first thing that came to mind for me. And man, have those mini games gotten better over the years. FIFA17 was the first year I truly enjoyed them throughout the year. "
"From what I can find they ""got around it"" 

I haven't played Fifa, are these mini games what you would legally call a 'mini game'? "
"Turbo grand prix? Maybe you're thinking the GTP with the supercharger? That's what I had and yeah, it was an amazing car"
Are you trying to say they're both $45k therefore making them both an option for 45k? Or am I just stupid and completely missing something? I feel like your wording is strange 
I can't say I've ever played them. I've been around FIFA a lot because my older brothers played it whilst I was growing up and they play it together now when the oldest one is staying with his. They look more fun than a loading screen. 
"They're things you could call warmup games IRL so I'd say so. 

The stands are empty whilst it loads and then when it's finished there's a huge cheer and the crowd pops in. "
"Yes sir.  (sorry not expert) I just recall it was the top GP. 

EIther way great car!   I wish I had been able to buy it from my friend when he moved overseas.   I rented one once for a road trip and had the time of my life. "
If you want a HUD in a model 3 (not available) you have also buy a BMW just for the HUD.
"I don't own a tesla and also didn't get it until the other comment above.. 
Seems some teslans are missing HIDs.. nice title it is then

Edit:HUD (autocorrect!)"
"Huh. Not sure they got around it legally, but it looks like Fifa is the only one (yet) "
Neat! 
Finally get it now lmao thanks honie
