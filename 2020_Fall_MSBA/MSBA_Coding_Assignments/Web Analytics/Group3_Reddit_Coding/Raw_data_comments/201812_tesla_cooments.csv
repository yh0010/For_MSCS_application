Look like a bunch of high school hicks that circle jerk about how much money they put into their vehicles so they can then proceed to spend more on gas. 
It's weird to see Ford and Chevy guys join forces.
"This shit actually happens?? üòØüòØ what a bunch of losers...there‚Äôs literally nothing they should complain about. Gas is cheap, their modded trucks are also relatively expensive, so Teslas aren‚Äôt some sort of luxury chariot mocking their tiny insecure egos, and this is...behind a gas station. What a place and a way to take a stand, boys...so brave."
"Yeah...""F"" all-American companies creating jobs while other automakers are cutting them. /s "
Love the two idiots looking in to their engines. Cherry on top
Is tribalism so ingrained in some peoples tiny caveman brains that they must create a conflict where non exists in order for their group to feel relevant?
I can't wait for the Tesla Pickup to make these ICE trucks' nuts retract.
"The police. If you feel unsafe, never feel like you can't call the police.

Edit: after reading some responses, I feel like I do need to clarify. If you feel unsafe, call the police. Be clear about the situation at hand and don't exaggerate. Don't call them because someone is blocking the charger and being a dick. Call them if they are threatening you or someone else. "
Last putrid farts from a dying corpse.
Christ almighty this is so cringe. Even if you are a hardcore climate change denier. Fuck tesla? What the hell for? The American car company that's currently successful and is creating jobs for Americans? Unlike what GM has been capable of doing for some time. Fuck these un-American pieces of shits. Hopefully they got their trucks towed
I do hate how this becoming more coming because people just hate electric vehicles because it's a newer thing to hate

"Has anyone ever tried to engage idiots like this? I don't mean confront. I mean engage. Ask why they hate Tesla. Listen to them and then respond.

* Tesla is the first new major American car company in 70 years. 
* Tesla is now outselling BMW, Mercedes, Audi and others in many luxury car segments. 
* Even if you prefer your ICE truck there is no reason to hate Tesla more than any other company who does not make trucks."
Been so many of these pictures lately. WTF is wrong with people 
Where was this?
Man the short sellers are getting really aggressive with their campaigns 
Plot twist: their sister‚Äôs name is Tesla and they were just excited to share their plans for the night. 
"I can't wait until the Tesla truck comes out. I'm gonna jack that sunuvabitch up to high Heaven and sling wet pig shit all over assholes like this.


Not really, but it's a powerful image, right?"
The police
This is like a scene out of Idiocracy.
Just hook up to them and pull them out. I know them electric motors have that torque. 
Someone is compensating hard.....
"Sure, you were uncomfortable for a brief period. And sure, a store employee had to come out and tell these people to get lost. And maybe you even couldn't charge for a few minutes while these morons proved they were stupid.

But just imagine a lifetime of having babydick like these dim bulbs."
Holy shit that idiot in the gold truck has installed LIGHTS in the frigging wheel weels to illuminate his fat tires. How much sadder can it get?
Since when was a Chevy avalanche a truck lol

I just posted something like this a few days ago.  I think this kind of situation is going to escalate into a serious incident soon. This  ridiculous unreasonable hostility is just getting worse.
"I'm in PA and yesterday I had a big pickup truck pull next to me on a highway, rev the engine and then speed up past me. I was in a Model 3. These rural truck owners are really bothered by electric cars."
"Should be yelling F Ford and GM for putting Americans out of jobs for their failures to innovate, adapt, and continuing to make shitty products. "

Life is too short to spend it hating things. Just ignore what you hate and spend time actually doing things you love. It's a really simple concept.

"Sounds like spoiled high school kids. When I was in high school there were some that always talked shit about the ""ricers"" even when someone just had a stock WRX. I guess the new ""cool"" thing to do is bully electric car drivers"
"This is one huge disadvantage of Tesla's strategy of using borrowed space to host Superchargers. If they owned the land like gas stations, they could have private security in addition to bathrooms and garbage cans.

I realize that Tesla isn't flush with cash yet but the situation of letting their mission-critical fast-charging network be at the whims of others is absolutely going to be a problem down the road which must be addressed soon. They can't let this sort of thing go on forever.

If you're reading this OP, this should absolutely be tweeted to Elon. It's something Tesla has needed to address but didn't have the funds to before. They'll have the funds soon."

I can‚Äôt wait for affordable electric pickup trucks to come out just to piss these guys off even more.
"Not a single one of those trucks were ever used to move, lift, carry anything.  I bet the beds look brand new."
"As a guy that drives a big truck, I don't understand why someone would do this. I would totally drive a Tesla if I could afford one, I'm hoping to be able to eventually afford the Tesla pickup."
"What a bunch of fucking idiots. Probably gonna fall asleep in his garage with the engine on one day, don't sweat it. "
That‚Äôs when you park your car in front and walk away with your insurance on speed dial 
Idiocracy in the making. 
People with limited intellect and lack worldly culture fear the things they don't understand. Ignorance is not always bliss. 
You know what they say... The bigger the truck the smaller the dick. I guess they should add brain to that.
Wow that‚Äôs nuts. Pretty disturbing behavior. I‚Äôd notify the cops even now (well after the fact). It‚Äôs better if they‚Äôre aware of it.
I don't get it. Just because it's not gas? Like that somehow affects their lives?
Where did this happen?? I‚Äôm in rural Alabama and I don‚Äôt think you would find a group that stupid anywhere in my area.

The Police. You report activity like that to your local law enforcement.
"Eathfirst! used to have bumper stickers that you could sneakily stick on trucks like these. The stickers said ""If your pecker was as small as mine, you'd need a big muscle wagon too!"" Wonder if you can still get those anywhere."
"Man, this upsets me cause I have an old 88 jeep wrangler. And I lifted it and widened it a bit and have all kinds of stuff done on it. But when I first discovered tesla I was really interested. And I think that the community I'm in with jeeps and trucks does not believe in climate change and thinks Electric cars are a scam. I really wish people could see how amazing these cars really are and just respect the differences we have."

"Now this is just fucking childish. I drive a truck on a daily basis because I need it for my job, and the thing comes in handy all the damn time. I would love a Tesla, but finances are preventing that from happening right now. I can imagine that the gas savings would make it pay for itself in the first week. "
Imagine being so out of touch that you both hate and love the home grown American company. Theyre just threatened because their tiny dick trucks are no longer the coolest thing on the road in their eyes and they cant afford a Tesla.
What a bunch of tiny dick wankers.
"sounds like they are upset their suped up trucks get wasted by a tesla 0-60.

i get why you build your truck up, ive put 35K into my 99 dodge ram with cummins but why be a dick about it? it can be fun to have a project and its defiantly fun going off road or owning the road when you get 3 feet of snow. but whats the idea behind big dicking a charging station? just an ass hole move"
Death knell of a dying industry.
"I laugh at idiots like this. They‚Äôre some of the most technologically advanced cars with really cool features and some of the best acceleration. Not to mention they help the environment and you save money on gas. I‚Äôve never had an experience like this in northern areas, but the more uncivilized south I get, I notice weird looks"
"Tell you what you do, if you see them parked around town go to their truck, find a small rock and put it in their valve stem cap and screw it back on. Lets the air out but doesn't damage anything. Just inconveniences them. "
Thats some next level dumbass redneck shit. 
"As someone who owned a 97 F250 HD, with the 7.5L Gas engine, I would love to also have a Tesla. If Tesla made 4x4 heavy duty pickup that I can haul shit with and do fun redneck shit off road, I'd buy one too. "

"Jesus christ I posted this to Facebook and a former coworked of mine loved it. Apparently he hates hybrids and electrics and says he ""rolls coal"" on them every chance he gets. I asked him why. He said because they are slow. (slower compared to gas fueled vehicles. The conversation turned into an argument which led to me being called a millinial and apparently since I didn't know electric cars have been around since 1880 something I came off as ignorant. He got super defensive and aggressive during the back and forth. Unfriended. I use to have a lot of respect for him but after the attacks it's apparent he is part of the problem. "
"Call the police, they're loitering.


Also, remember to recharge every night. A Tesla should be able to get you to and from your work and errands each day on a single charge.

Another tip, get a dashcam. These types of people often turn violent at a drop of a hat. Is also recommend getting some mace spray; not a small can, a big can. Like the ones police use during riots. -Use it only if they are coming at you with perceived hostility.

... Don't start a fight, just finish them."
I have a good friend that drives a model S that carries a valve stem core removal tool on his key ring for occasions just like this. We've watched from a good distance off as one of these inconsiderate individuals exploded over four flat 37 inch tires.
"Tesla will need to hire tow away companies, the predatory kind to deal with these kind yall'quada, their brodozers be gone in less than 10 minutes, and most of these bandito repo guys, you don't fuck with them, even a methheaded redneck wouldn't mess with them..."
"The cops?  I don't  know.  If they're being asses, blocking chargers, and there is an actual queue of ppl waiting in line, yes.  Call the cops.  I don't know if the cops will care much when there aren't ppl waiting though.  TBH, if it's an ongoing thing, it's not a bad idea to at least go to the police station when you have time to at least start a conversation with someone to find out what the right thing to do is.  Imagine if a bunch of Teslas parked in a gas station.  the attendant and the ppl in line would be up the cops asses in a heartbeat "
Probably because that 1 tesla in the picture is worth more than all 3 of those trucks. Jealousy.

One of them may graduate to maturity. The rest will end up in prison, or dead end jobs. Most will rent for the entirety of their adult lives, and I‚Äôm talking apartments and single wides. Most of them will absolutely peak in high school, the others will have shined their brightest in middle school. Most, of not all, will destroy their precious trucks, with no help from anyone else, from drunk driving, or somehow, and I see this all the time, believing that these lifted, 4x4s are the same as a corvette or other sports cars. These guys are the glue of the Midwest, because they literally get stuck in their little lives of zero consequence and without each other to agree with, they have no idea what culture is or how to think.

"Get your phone out and in their faces, maybe number plates and don't stop until they move"
"Well, apparently a Sheetz employee is the best person to report it to...?"
Guess tesla need to build a full sized pick up truck. Has to be pure envy!
Wait they got kicked out or you got kicked out?
"That's like chanting ""fuck cool things I wish I had"""
"People just need to keep informing these morons that Tesla is as mmmrican as their trucks, if not more so. Ugh "
"out of all the causes to take up, these retards go and do something like this."
"You are supposed to park directly in front of them and get out your car and say ""now youse can't leave"""
Buy what you can afford and be happy with what you have truckers.

It's a good sign my friend. They are validating the true threat of practicality. I bet more than half of them will have electric vehicles in thier future. 
"Well, I think trucks with such a huge engine are prone to self immolation. While their owners glued themselves to the wheel, and poured gasoline all over their body as a protest, like Buddhist monks in China. "
For what end?
ignore them... they only want attention
i would've keyed them and slashed the tires provided the owners weren't in sight
They'll change their mind soon enough. In the meantime trespassing is still illegal.
Should have put the whole thing on video and loaded to YouTube.  They would never live it down and it would have exposed their stupidity.  
They mad a sedan has more towing capacity than their pickup.
That is seriously ridiculous.
Carry an extention cable and park in front of the trucks
So now you guys need to sit in front of the diesel pumps and chant ‚Äúf‚Äù diesel whenever a truck like theirs comes by.
The cops?
Just park infront of gas station
"Fossil fuel thugs , watt‚Äôs next ."
This needs to start to becoming a local police issue.
"So what you do, is slash their tyres and pour milk down the vents at the bottom of the windscreen. Inconveniencing others just because of their vehicle choice is stupid, people like that are the reason the joke of a human being trump is currently president. "
"Next time get a picture with the license plates and email to friends, (unlike social media, you can‚Äôt delete a sent emai, so they cannot make you even if they see you do it)"
Report directly to Elon .... 
"Whew, not Florida."
Life. You report it to life as crappy people and move on.

I let a friend with a big lifted diesel truck drive my Model 3 and he told me it gave him a woody. 
"If they wont move, slash their tires and they cant move."
They must have HUGE penises. Look at their MANLY trucks and how they SHOWED UP liberal Tesla owners. 
Is someone going to answer Leicina‚Äôs question?
Where was this? Like what state?
"Their cousinwives are probably out with their ""friend"" and they're mad about getting cucked."
This is only in America
Jealousy is an ugly thing sometimes. 
I can‚Äôt imagine someone that pathetic. Damn. 
Wanna know how to get on the bad side just say ford better than Chevy or the other way around depending on what truck they have and it guaranteed to get their blood boiling.
Just stupid folks doing stupid things.......
"I'm not saying it's going to be a Tesla driver who does it, but the guy in the tan truck is just begging to get those tires slashed."
"People view Tesla as elitist and an existential threat to the fossil fuel industry. I anticipate seeing more of this in Oil and Gas geographies like Alberta, Texas and North Dakota. :("
I feel like these guys probably work in an oil related job. 
They have nothing else better to do on a Saturday night hahaha

Is that in the US?
"I suspect that the gas station is who you report this too. It's private property. So while the parking space may not be enforceable by law such as handicapped, the Sheetz could call for a tow if they felt these cars dint belong there. "
"Report to their parents, they‚Äôre children."
One thing owning an electric car has taught me is that people don‚Äôt like it when you stray from the herd. Your not doing what they are doing is seen as a threat. It‚Äôs probably a reptilian brain thing.
Report them to your fists lol.
You could take it up with the Supreme Leader of The Fraternal Order Of The Wee Willy‚Äôs Association. 
...that'll show em?

They are Brodozers. 
I'm so fucking glad i live in Europe. 
I should buy a brush guard and winch for my truck...
"First day I test drove a Nissan leaf, I had 11 miles to go. Plugged it in at work and a director unplugged it and left me stranded. I took it back and vowed not to get an electric car until there are charging locks and better laws protecting drivers from assholes."
Race him for the spot.
">Who do you report activity like this to?

I‚Äôm sure a towing company would be happy to take that problem off your hands."
If you had a Model X I'd have challenged them to a pulling contest.
Idiot coal runner .
"That‚Äôs when you park in front of them, ‚Äúawe man, I would let you out but ma battery is dead‚Äù"
Go inside...buy antifreeze and slushies...offer free drinks.
Offer to tow their broken down old trucks out.... you should be able to even if they're trying to pull you the other way.  
Hahahahah
They're skeered and insecure about the upcoming transition
"I love my big truck and I also wish that a Tesla made sense where I live so I could own one. In my area if there is a stall designated for a certain vehicle type, parking enforcement are the ones needed to solve the dispute."
"Could park your Tesla in front of the truck, distract the truck driver, take their keys, start their truck and lock the doors with the key in ignition. "
Just tell them they have little dicks 
"LOL, why would anyone hate Tesla?"
Looks like its time for a Molotov cocktail.
Let me guess was this in central PA?
Like the back of a Volkswagen?
That is indeed very uncool by these people. Would love to see Tesla charging stations available for other EVs though.
My paranoid mind sees posts like this and starts thinking about how guerilla propaganda gets turned into negative/violent action. 
"Its private property so you report it to the property owner, who should ask them to move. 

Charging stations, low emissions vehicle parking, materinity parking, employee of the month parking, etc. Are not legally protected like handicap parking. So they did not commit any crimes to report."
I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts here and there like this. There‚Äôs a whole small dick movement of guys with big trucks purposely blocking charging stations to mess with electric car drivers. 
"I know this is a real tough one to answer thus your reasoning for coming here to ask..  But you report something like this, aka harassment, to the police."
Cops
"If you're in South West Michigan, call me.  If your a real country boy your going want to preserve our planet, not kill it with some POS truck.  Yes, I do have a truck but I also support anyone trying to save this beautiful planet.  Calling these jackoffs hillbillies is offensive and I won't have it "
Where else would they shove coal into their gas tank?
I think you report them to the small wiener police.
"Next level Tesla hate there, geez! What the #### is wrong with people these days!"
Rollin‚Äô Coal üòÖ
"clemson fans, gotta love them "
"""who to report to"" -- the employees of the business they are at. I'd guess unless there is a towing sign there probably isn't anything else you can legally do (ie cops probably wouldn't do anything unless the business was claiming they were trespassing?)."
Report them to the tiny dick organization. 
Ask r/teenagers they‚Äôre good at dealing with bullies
The proper authority to notify about behavior like this is their mommies.
Please tell me where this was at?
Why can't ppl just be cool
douche club having a meeting
So you went to a Sheetz is what's your saying? Seriously though this is a normal relatively calm night at Sheetz where I'm from. As much as I love diesel and V8 trucks or gas powered sports cars I got to admit Tesla's are nice (nothing replaces the roar of an engine though). I would consider getting one if they did a truck or a semi affordable sports car.
What cunts. Who does this?
What cunts. Who does this?
I'm like...we get it you knocked up your high school girlfriend 
Lmao ‚Äúit was really uncomfortable‚Äù just ignore them and go about your day. Find a new charger or something. 
"Oh, it looks like you ran into a gathering of the IIMA... the Insecure Inadequate Males of America!"
"They seem like a bright bunch of lads!

I had come across a similar situation a few months back. I never knew what ""blowing coal"" was until that day. Still never understand some peoples' haterd toward EV's"
My company is contracted by Tesla to inspect their parts. I'm just waiting for the contractor discount so I can get one of these bad boys ;)
The ignorance is fuming 
The police...
But why? 
Can‚Äôt you call the police to get them towed?
"What a waste of those trucks. They should be out in the woods at a mudhole. Drinking beers having a bonfire, cooking food. Bunch of wankers."
You should park at the pump when you go to gas stations from now on. Be a rebel johnny!
Mall cruisers. Not a speck of fucking dirt on those trucks.
I rather drive a old Hyundai then that ugly truck. 
"This must be a crime, if u don't want to save the only place you can live in, at least let someone else do it"

"It's funny cause OP's car probably cost the same, if not more than all those trucks combined."
"I don't really understand people like this. 

Personally, I dont really like Tesla but what do you gain from shitting on people who do?

Is it an anti-electric vehicle thing? I'm a massive petrolhead but EVs are inevitable."
I‚Äôve heard of people who take the schroeder valves out of tires as a harmless yet costly to diagnose and eventually inexpensive to remediate prank. 
I would start yelling TPS at them
"Just point and say, ‚ÄúI just saw a beer truck pass that way.‚Äù They will all jump in their trucks to chase after it. Problem solved. "
Where was this?
Tesla is the American Dream... this is so stupid
"Get ready for more, last year Toyota sold 65% Trucks and SUVs last year and they're building a plant to catch up. (Quote from CEO during our Christmas meeting, we're a supplier)"

"Guy on the right *points to engine*: So what's this big thing here the supercharger?

"Here is a novel idea, since there are daily photos like this on Reddit, why not take the time to send your state legislators a letter asking them to sponsor legislation imposing penalties for drivers of non battery electric vehicles for parking in EV charging spots.

Take 10-15 minutes to write an informative, non-emotional, suggesting asking for help to solve the problem and give the police the power to ticket/tow these vehicles for blocking access to charging infrastructure .

Edit: This should really get the same treatment as handicap parking spots, with similar fines.

"Don‚Äôt know if the charging cables are long enough for this, but I‚Äôd park them in, plug my car in to the charger anyway, grab a sandwich, and sit on a bench and watch them freak out."
"Sheetz, rednecks, ....must be Pennsylvania"
Just call a tow truck.

Cornball little prick boys. 
"You never see someone blocking the gas pumps with there electric cars, chanting ""F"" gas, because it just wouldn't happen*; good people don't act like that. It's exactly what needs to happen, but instead we get these jubronies announcing their commitment and allegiance to our extinction because they had nothing better to do on a Saturday night. "
"I‚Äôm a truck guy hardcore but shit like this makes me cringe. I humbly apologize. These clowns probably don‚Äôt even use their trucks as trucks, probably just to be edgy and against the grain.

I don‚Äôt live in a place where electric cars are very popular just because of how cold and isolated it is. (Never drove a car in my life. Learned how to drive in a pickup and have only ever owned pickups). If there isn‚Äôt already, there really should be some kind of bylaw that says any vehicle that doesn‚Äôt use a charging station (I.e. non Tesla/electric) will be towed/ticketed for obstructing a charging station. 

Not cool man. No wonder why truck guys get a bad rep. "
You can call the police on them
Yes please destroy my planet with more fumes
"""Them tesla folks is gunna make so in ten years there's probably gunna be competative electric alternatives to the gasoline trucks I currently own.

Were they revving their engines and flashing their high beams
"So strange, how do you even get to a point in life where this becomes an idea? "
Looks like PA lol
Where are their license plates? 
Just tow em away with that superior Tesla torque
You slash 3 of their tires. Insurance pays out of you do all 4 /s
hill billies
"Just box them in, take a picture of their plates and leave for a few hours. Either they are stuck, or you get to fuck them over bigtime for damage to your car."
What a Shetty thing to do
I do not see the logic or reinforcement behind this. I would find it mildly interesting to sit down and talk to each of these guys to see exactly why they think it is important to do this 
I bet you could just put a tow rope on on your tesla to thier truck and have enough torque to just pull them out technically.  
"this is what my local mall looks like, at the superchargers

I think I'm going to start calling the cops and see what they say, its pretty fucking annoying and lazy "
"Fun fact: a container ship at full steam can out pollute 50 million cars and there‚Äôs over 60k container ships.

No surprise to see a Clemson fan there. 
Why didnt you post their plates?
"You report this activity to the police, and the internet of course."
I wonder if people in horse drawn carriages did this to the first model Ts. 
Hi Tesla people! How much do you have to pay at a supercharging station? Similar to electric rates at your home? How much does it cost to drive 300 miles?
But.. why?
you should post to /r/pics  for visibility. these people need to be shamed

Call the police. They're literally trying to disturb the peace 
Ya ask the gas station employees and if they don‚Äôt want to get involved then you call the police. They‚Äôre impeding a private business from functioning properly like a bunch of asswipes.

"You complain to the property owner, just like you would if they were blocking the cart corralled or anything else. "
It‚Äôs amazing what people will do to distract others from the fact they have a small penis 
These are just assholes. As a mechanic and a car guy I respect all people when it comes to their preference in cars. Plus I've seen some modded teslas that kill it.
This is why you carry a baseball bat.
"Man, if this isn't Trump's America right here I don't know what is."
Just remember they have small dicks the bigger the truck. 
They don't like Tesla cuz they want their trucks to go vroom vroom
You can smell the insecurity. 
The back tires on that ford look pretty bald
You should have asked them if they wanna drag race.
The police?
Dox them.
Wait till a massive Tesla truck runs them the fuck outta there by actively pushing those beat up pieces of junk.
That is some top tier redneckery right there
Just republican neck beard punks

"Fucking obnoxious.

Oh man that is so embarrassing. Those poor kids. This is probably the most exciting thing they are gonna do all year. I bet they will tell people about this for years. So pathetic

"Depending on your state, you may be able to call the police. I read a story the other day, in which I learned in California it's illegal for a car to park in a EV parking spot if it cannot charge from it."
"These are the guys that were not allowed into truck clubs because they were assholes who broke the rules too much. For example, doing donuts on a busy road, rolling coal in a drive thru, having baby penises. 

Eventually they find each other and start their own club. And then 1 starts a Facebook anti-cop page. Just because cops always rain on their retard parade. "
"I drive a lifted pickup. That said, I don't agree with blocking off charging stations with our trucks. I don't agree with ""rolling coal"" either. I use my lifted old beater truck for work, fishing, and hunting. The lift I have is for purposes of trying to prevent getting high centered out in the back country. Must say my old truck does the job it is intended for, low gear pulling, no speed demon and most of these trucks are not built for speed but slowly getting to speed. There is a good numberof these guys that believe they have race trucks and show pieces. "
Compensating
"Next time, clip off all the hanging balls of their trucks. They‚Äôll cry and think twice about doing that again. "

There's a group of Hicks that do this at our local Walmart. Every day. I really don't see the fun in showing off who's got the better truck that my daddy bought me. And the vape cloud they produce they make their own atmosphere. Listen I'd have no problem if you did this once a week. But every day jfc. Rant over 
Why do they do this? I had a lifted Jeep that I loved and I still love bigger trucks and stuff even though I drive a Subaru now. I don't get why these people need to do things like this and ruin it for everyone. 
Their trucks aren't even nice. I'm a hillbilly I know what a nice truck looks like and Tesla is bad ass. I would have a Tesla if I could afford one. Coming from a hillbilly that also went to a hillbilly high school.
Which state was this in?
Tesla needs a longer extension cord so you could park sideways in front of them and recharge
Imagine 3 Model X's pulling up and towing the away...
"These are just high school country hicks trying to be hard. The same people who ""burn coal"" out of those huge exhaust stacks covering bikers in coal soot on the road. I wish the cops could just make them leave. Does Tesla or anyone not own those charging spots? Maybe making it technically trespassing or preventing the facilitation of someone's free movement. Who knows I'm sure a law is being broken somewhere and an expect may be able to point out. I'm bet Tesla customer service may even send out a few tow trucks to help people make the right decision I'd you called and explained what was going on. Doubt that had a permit to protest anyways. Just my opinion on the issue."
How archaic 
"I though this was a ""cash for clunkers"" ad for a second. The kinds of people who have both THAT amount of free time, and that amout of hate are a SUB-sub level of scumbag. "
Your Tesla would destroy all of those trucks in a drag race as well and it would do it with class.

"There's a supercharging station installed at a casino in my city. One night I stopped there to charge and get dinner, and a limousine was parked horizontal across all 6 bays. "

"How small has your dick to be, to be allowed to buy such a truck?"

Shoulda just raced them for pinksü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è shut up or nut up 
You should've slashed all their tires. That'll teach em to think twice before being a dick 
Should of said ‚Äúat least I don‚Äôt drive a Chevy‚Äù 
"Honestly a Tesla driver who has the gumption just needs to talk and perhaps relate with these wannabe tough guys.   One would have to beware of the potential alpha sociopath, but simply appreciating the fact that these kids want to work on their craft (yes, a rather dumb craft in that it eats their money), and explaining how as an older adult one has moved on to other  hobbies and the efficiency of the Tesla - and it‚Äôs ridiculously intelligent design - has allowed said Tesla owner to have more time to do what they want.

"The funny thing is if they ever got in a Tesla they would love it.  Undereducated (high school boys) don‚Äôt like change or new things.

"just spray paint their trucks, scratch em, they annoy you you annoy them back"
People who do this deserve to have their tires slashed. Change My Mind. 
What a bunch of fucking morons. More Tesla‚Äôs don‚Äôt mean fewer trucks. 
Why do they even care?

Ask them if they‚Äôd like to race.
"Oh, get out the chains and challenge them to a tug of war.  A Tesla would have a weight and torque advantage. Bonus YouTube humiliation forever and ever!"

Why are people that drive big trucks like this *ALWAYS* douche bags/dicks/obnoxious af?
I'd walk over and check out their trucks and ask them what modifications they've made to it and show interest in their trucks. The way to piss them off is to show them you're not bothered by them at all.

A good way a Tesla owner might be able to defuse the situation would be to walk up to their cars and (assuming you know some car mechanics) compliment their cars. 

Talk about horsepower, torque, rise of the automobile and it‚Äôs history. It‚Äôs a way for car enthusiasts to find common ground. You‚Äôll always have the negative people negating your bridge building, but the others will see their fault and lower the number of incidences over time. "

Wouldnt this be the same if a bunch of teslas blocked up a gas station to prevent people from getting gas? Did you ask them to move.

I'm commenting on the part of the story where you said one of the assholes circled his truck around made it look at as though he was going to run you over.  He likely assumes that all Tesla drivers are liberals who hate guns but plenty of us have concealed carry permits.  It takes less than two seconds for someone in legitimate fear to draw and shoot.  I hope it never comes to that.

Tbh i would never buy a tesla. Downvote me as much as you want but idc. I live in norway and as you all know they sold as hotcakes here. But i almost see more peugeot 206 EVs from the 90s (remember these are built with classic shit french car quality and they are over 25+ years old) than pre facelift teslas. It just prooves they arent built properly for where i live. Then bear in mind norway salts their roads. Most of the early teslas i see are missing loads of those LED lamps on the 3rd brake light. So considering the price of them i would stay back and buy some other EV if i really wanted something electric. Also if theres one thing which is just pure cringe and disgusting are these custom licence plates that mock ice cars. PLEASE it was funny the 1st weeks now its just absolute low tier humour.

It's definitely only due to the hyperpolitization of everything in our world. Turns out that allowing 6 men to own all major news outlets would lead to propaganda angling built into every single topic.
Really? As a muscle car and car fan in general I've seen the opposite. People used to always shit talk EVs thanks to hybrids and weak EVs. Since the P85D started making waves people have changed their tune quite a bit. I've seen people who were staunchly against electrics turn around.

You should have seen the look on the Mrs's face. Not impressed to say the least. 

I couldn't even give him a chance. I changed lanes to get by him and as I got to his side he tried to speed up to keep ahead but trying to match the acceleration of a Tesla is futile. I toyed with him for a couple miles and let him try to pass and as he'd almost get ahead of me I'd floor it and quickly be ahead again. Then I'd slow to normal freeway speeds and he'd catch up, rinse and repeat. 

I felt vindicated but also a bit sad for the guy because that is who he is and he has to be that same shitty personality every day.

Seems I didn't describe the situation clearly and some are getting fussy and making incorrect assumptions. This guy had plenty of lanes and areas to go as the freeway is 5-ish lanes wide, I was in no way blocking him, I was just trying to keep in front of him to prevent what he obviously wanted to do to me.  I was not in the passing lane or blocking his access or anyone's. It was clear he was trying to pull directly in front of me which would have gained him no advantage otherwise. His truck was spewing black spurts all the while.  For those still skeptical I suppose you've never been minding your business on the road and had one of these assholes roll coal in front of you. 

If anything, I'm guilty of allowing him to believe he was about to get in front of me instead of just keeping ahead of him entirely which is what I meant by toying with him."
Let em do it its a minor inconvenience for you to wash it but a major one when their engine is coated in soot.
"I think those are all gasser trucks. But yeah it‚Äôs fucking ridiculous. I was doing a triathlon in Raleigh and I guess people weren‚Äôt pleased that the event cordoned off the shoulder, so on about 3 separate occasions someone ‚Äúrolled coal‚Äù on the bikers. Pretty badass. /s"
They can't even roll Coal. They are V8' unleaded engines

"If you put a p100D powertrain in a truck it would destroy 1/2 trucks for class leading torque, and come real close to being best in class for 1 ton trucks.

Tesla just needs to do their homework to ensure range, cooling, and the chassis is capable of towing."
"Yes, and yes."
Some of the information known about the truck pegs it at 3.9 seconds to 60
"The Tesla truck should have an option to spew something out of a fake tailpipe. I'm thinking either soap bubbles, or a hologram of rainbows. Or both, rainbow bubbles."

Rivian is going to be basically that.
Fuvk these dudes. Trust me. Don't worry about trying to convert them. They aren't worth your time
The Rivian claims 0-60 in 3 seconds so I'm sure the Tesla will be close to that.
900hp should make it faster then 4 seconds if it can get traction. The Silverado with a 6.2l at 420hp does 0-60 in 5.4 seconds.

Aren‚Äôt they building self-driving semi trucks?
"I'm so happy that i now read most Mexican Town names in Lou Dobbs' voice. ""Ontario or guanajawaaaua"""
"\>  Tesla is now outselling BMW, Mercedes, Audi and others in many luxury car segments.

It's just another luxury car to them, and probably part of the hate (part of the rich liberal hate out there, regardless if it's accurate)

You could sell the American owned and manufactured, but debate rarely changes peoples minds (sadly)"
"They hate things that aren't ""Manly"".  It's an image thing, and based on local cultures and counter-culture.

Asking them questions like this, and noting that your vehicle is more american than theirs results in saying that it's the wrong type of american, and similar.  

At least in my two encounters.

So... maybe not, especially if they're already prone to violence as in OP's case?"
"Facts wont help you. This is a purely emotional and tribal response. Us vs. Them. Instead of it being chevy vs ford rivalry thats always been its evolved into everyone vs tesla. Doesn't need to be logical.

But you could try."
This would be beyond naive to attempt. It‚Äôs a redneck culture thing not a lack of awareness about car manufacturer thing.
Rednecks only buy Mexican or Chinese made Ford and GM cars... pointing out that Tesla is American is just gonna confuse them since Putin‚Äôs orange pool boy didn‚Äôt tweet about it...
"""Engaging"" a hate-filled person is a great way to get shot. And especially these particular individuals; I guarantee there are more firearms than trucks in that picture.

There is no conversing with people like that. As others have noted, you call someone who is trained to deal with hostile and threatening behavior, i.e. the police."
"I would probably be too upset to engage.  That said, if there were only one of them, I'd think it would be possible to engage.  But with multiple people, I have a feeling they'd have to all prove their testosterone by actually saying/doing all the things they privately promised they would say/do when they were all planning this out."
You can't reason someone out of an opinion they didn't reason themselves into.
"It's probably nothing personal like it seems, they will take literally anything and make a huge deal out of nothing just to rile you up, there's shitty people all around us"
"Good point, maybe Tesla owners should get a decal stating ""Made in 'Murica""."
"Yes, and I believe I am literally dumber for it. I certainly have come to hate those people. Fucking willingly ignorant lying SOB who respond to facts as ""Fake News"". Literally.

These idiots are out there. about 43 million of them."
Don't engage people who you know dislike you and are actively trying to engage you. It is a trap. Surviving a trap that you intentionally walk into and trigger does not make you clever or brave.
These kind of people don't put much thought into it. It goes like this electric > green > global warming > liberal > anti-american!
And also Tesla makes trucks now (semi trucks anyway).
"You mean, has someone tried to reason with a bunch of angry ignorant rednecks trying to impress their girlfriends by acting macho? No. Don‚Äôt bother."
Yeah it‚Äôs not about any of your points unfortunately. It‚Äôs purely the fact that they think trucks/gas/diesel =tough and manly. It‚Äôd be like trying to tell them to wear an American made pink dress.

I live 30 minutes from here and I second this. Hickory is a decent place. Local cops won‚Äôt put up with garbage like this. 
"Ok, let's be clear here, what they are doing is in no way criminal at all. It is an absolute dick move, but nothing they are doing can be seen as criminal. 

Now I still think it isn't a bad idea to call the police to see if they can help, but it's not like they can arrest anyone over this."

"In the photo they are not even in the trucks, so I doubt the OP felt like they were going to hit him with their vehicles."
I agree. It's just a matter of time that something real bad is going to happen.

This was probably these guys' spot to hang out and be obnoxious and do burnouts on a Saturday night.  The gas station owner probably had these charging stations put in not only for the money but to displace the truckers.
And innovation. More innovation means more choices and customizing which just makes any mod goal even more rare and interesting.
"> Electric cars are gonna make gas ~~cheap~~ **expensive** as fuck.

Economies of scale.  when cars transition to EV en masse, oil starts losing those economies and gets expensive.  When that starts, gas car prices will crash and eventually the only ones remaining will be the nice ones worth feeding expensive oil, owned by people that can afford to feed them.

Just like horses today, they were cheap enough for everyone to have their own 150 years ago, and now they're limited to those with the means."

Gas is dirt cheap as an energy source. Have a sensible commute and it can easily be less that $50/month.
"Welcome to rural America, limp dick trucks have been around for a lot longer than the angry orange"
"3.12$/ per gallon this morning in the SFV... 

And really, gas may be more expensive in LA, but two things..

1. Air quality since the 90s, ridiculously better
2. Maybe the second most expensive in the US, but compared to Europe and other areas, gas is cheap..."
"Lol, you're projecting."
"Right? I'm really baffled by the hate. Not sure which ""talking point"" drives this. Is it an anti-climate change thing?"
This is something tesla shluld push hard.. 100% made in America by Americans
"Also, lets double down on our ongoing atmospheric experimentation!"
"Not anymore, GM's orgional factory in Canada is being closed, and the work is being brought into America/Mexico. On a plus note, Elon has expressed interest in using the upgraded GM plant for Tesla production."
The only time something from Mexico is considered American. 
This is a retarded attitude to have.  Toyota is one of the biggest employers in my town. Globalism works. 
"Possibly unpopular opinion here, the last ""murican"" cars ceased production when they stopped making the 69 mustang. Even Ford vehicles are designed mainly in the UK now."
"Tesla seat cushions are made in Mexico.

That‚Äôs the American way!
It's the opposite. Parts made in Canada and assembled in Mexico
Dont kid your self their are plenty of parts on a Tesla from both those countires.
Not even made in Canada anymore either.
"I hate to break this to you, but Tesla uses the same interior and parts suppliers in Canada and Mexico that the other companies do. "

"Because even if the electricity comes form the dirtiest plant in America, it is still a greener car then there highest mileage trucks."
"They don't like that view of America.  They want it like it was back in the 50s, with a bunch of old boys with slicked black hair sitting around drive-ins with their chicks oohing over their new 500 cubic inch naturally aspirated big-block V-8, begging for them to take them to the drive in movie.

&#x200B;

Or, maybe they are just aggro idiots."
Because mining lithium for your cars is soo good for the environment 
"I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt exist, because obviously they do, just look at the picture. But I live in Kansas and have yet to meet a republican that hates electric vehicles. A shit ton of torque, and gas/diesel is heavily taxed so switching to an electric car means less tax going towards the government. A republican‚Äôs dream.

If anything, my republican coworkers LOVE solar power because it makes them feel big and strong because they‚Äôre not dependent on the utility company and if shit ever hits the fan they‚Äôll still have power. It feeds into their doomsday prepper hero fantasy. Same with electric cars. Power goes out? They can still drive around because they have solar panels.

Our politicians suck, but most Kansas republicans *I‚Äôve personally met* have been surprisingly reasonable."

I think this is the most accurate comment in this thread. Except even grown ass men can act just like this too if they never learned to be less ignorant.
"I agree but there is no rivalry between trucks and Teslas.  If Tesla was the reason the local plant closed down and people lost their jobs then I understand the hate but a Tesla in no way infringes on the rights of pickup truck drivers to own and use pickup trucks.  There is no threat, no rivalry.  This isn‚Äôt Yankees vs Red Sox it‚Äôs like Yankee fans not liking someone because they play golf."

I'm curious to know why Rivian isn't getting more attention! I'm hoping they come to Canada's market by 2022; maybe by then i'll be able to pick one up!
"Yeah, I just did some quick maths and for the price that I pay for my new 2018 ram (payments+gas) I would be in the same budget to just get this one."
Aren't they Ford bodies?
The Bollinger B1 is an interesting electric truck as well. The 4 door model is kind of ugly IMO but the 2 door is on point
Looking forward to picking one up
"I agree. They should be receiving far more plaudits. They got Franz to go actually see it in person and their market really is for off-roading given its capabilities. My speculation is that Tesla‚Äôs pickup will likely be in two trims, one for urban work and one for offroad (more expensive). The more urban/contractor trim would likely be far more popular as its gunning against the F150, a vehicle thats made a generation of morons believe they are good salespeople. It sells every 30 secs whether or not the dealer is basically literate. Tesla getting costs to that low point will be an insane feat but cant wait for them to try! Def interested in Rivian nonetheless and i hope their sales cannibalize the F150 before the Tesla Wargod is unveiled."
I'm ready for the Bollinger B1 and B2 to hit the market. 
Probably won't make it too production...these compatible pop up and die all the time
"They really need to market the rivian well, in order for it to be successful. I think they'll do well for the California market, but they would really need to double their efforts for marketing in Texas. The term 'Electric truck' will get laughed at because they wont expect it to work similarly to a gas truck."
I feel this way about the Bollinger. Either one will be exciting to see.
I literally just saw my first ad for these trucks a couple of nights ago.  I had no idea another company was beginning to try and break into the auto market.  The ad I saw triggered me to begin watching about 30-45 minutes worth of videos on these things.  I'm very intrigued by them along with their SUV they are planning.  Both the truck and SUV look very nice.  I hope they're able to begin production and delivery in 2020 like they are stating they will do.
Internal combustion engine. Gassers and diesels. 
"Basically, practically all non-EVs. The farting kind."
Internal Combustion Engine
"Haha, I think it‚Äôs a must. Needs to be bugger by proportionally bigger in respect to torque. "
You do you.
Yes :)
Don't expect it to be like the X. It will put ICE pickups to shame. Instant torque on an EV pickup will make an ICE pickup feel like a donkey. There's no reason you can't lift an EV pickup. Look at the Rivian.

"Saw this first hand. 2 big truck dudes were driving aggressively fast and had people sticking their heads out of windows. All while I'm watching the cop behind us in my rear view mirror. He flashes his lights , speeds past them so they think they're safe. He goes a half mile and fish tails in the middle the road, gets out of his car, points at both trucks and tells them to get over. üòÇ

The rest of traffic proceeds as both pickups got pulled over. Soooooo satisfying to see."

No. They're successful because people want to buy their cars. I'm perfectly fine with subsidies (which are given to other cars) but I don't recall Tesla ever needing a big fucking bailout from our government to stay afloat. GM got a second chance at life from the taxpayers and still can't get their shit together

"> noting that your vehicle is more american than theirs results in saying that it's the wrong type of american, and similar. 

I would not suggest saying this part. In fact I would not talk about their cars at all. I would simply mention that Tesla is an American company beating foreign companies. I feel like these kind of people would not know how to feel once those kinds of things were pointed out.

That being said you are probobly correct about the numbers. A larger group is more likely to show-off and act out as a result so it might only be safe one-on-one."
"I've worked in construction and agriculture my entire adult life, over 20 years. Use pickup trucks for their intended purposes when needed, from pulling cattle trailers, feeding animals in pastures, to hauling tools and materials. I drive a 4-cyl Mazda when I don't need a truck. Everyone I have worked with over the years share my hatred of people like this. I can almost guarantee the owners of those trucks are not in a trade or profession which requires a truck. They're too clean for one, and if they were, they wouldn't have time to harass random people at a gas station. These are the same shitheads that ride the center line when you pass them on the highway, or ride your bumper when they're behind you because they think their truck makes them the ""king of the road""."
Totally this. It reminds me of the same vocal group that hates on Prius owners. Tesla's are just a new flavor of the same thing in their mind.
If they hate things that aren‚Äôt manly they should be really upset by the make up counter at Macy‚Äôs. 
It‚Äôs so silly. If instant power and torque is less manly call me Shirley. If they came out with a big three electric truck it‚Äôd be a monster and they‚Äôd probably change their tune.

"That's not correct in all jurisdictions and is a common misconception.

Same goes for other states as well.

"wow, you really don't know anything about vehicles, do you? The two trucks on the end are fairly late models, new they were like $50K, and they have a couple of grand worth of wheels and tires on them. The F150 has a lift kit, after market projector headlamps, aftermarket grill, and probably more money in off road wheels and tires than either of the other two. The owners may be assholes, but they've put some money into their trucks.   "

"Actually, it is the opposite.  Trucks are massively overpriced because the car makers understand that these tiny dick hillbillies are too insecure to drive a regular car.  And all the stuff that makes them ""custom"" is also marked up big time.

"Eventually yes.  But that's going to take a much greater market share than we presently enjoy.   For the next 4-8 years electrics will have the effect of lowering gasoline demand and prices (other factors may raise prices, opec, etc).

Your post was removed because it violates an item in Rule 1 within r/TeslaMotors.
Gas has always been cheaper than it ought to be. Prices have always been subsidized with environmental destruction.
"What‚Äôs standard maintenance like on an EV? I know there‚Äôs no oil changes, but there‚Äôs got to be something other than tires and breaks, right?"
It may be cheaper to operate based on cost of gas but what about other factors such as car insurance? I can't imagine Teslas have reasonable insurance rates. Not to mention what I would cost to fix after an accident or out of warranty.
"Tesla hasn't existed long enough for you to say that. How expensive something is to drive involves depreciation as well. There's a market for 20 year old trucks.... Is there a market for 20 year old electric vehicles? I highly doubt it. Plus your initial costs are higher. Running costs may be better, initially, but that dino juice slurping engine is lasting a hell of a lot longer than any modern batteries will. 

Electric vehicles have their merits. But 'cheapness' is not one of them."
I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to a gas vehicle since it will essentially have a gas tax on top of the car payment lol
"The fact that paying for a $45,000 car is less expensive than paying for gas means that gas is very far from being cheap. It's up around $1.60/L where I live, or about $4.50 usd/gal."
"Or gas prices are high where I live. I was spending $100 every week on gas before I switched, and increases to the cost of gas mean that the same amount I was buying would now cost $130-$140."
"""Just don't drive, and gas is cheaper!""

Lol ok then "
Yep. But we can be relatively certain where like dick truck-inbreds tossed their votes. 
"Probably.  This reeks of pure tribalism.  The propaganda machines tell them to hate the enemy, and the enemy probably includes any company that is a threat to big oil/gas and affirms the dangers of climate change.  This is an illustration of how dangerous and stupid mainstream propaganda is.  It can even get people who are probably self-proclaimed ""patriots"" to hate a truly American success story."
"Just pure hate coz they cant compete with teslas launchng at stop lights and soon with tesla pickup... well...

Its mostly the climate thing. I posted a longer comment about the issue because I'm part of the truck community. As well as tesla.

"Don't forget Teslas run off American-made fuel, unlike those trucks that use fuel from Saudi Arabia."
Each Tesla has dozens of major foreign components. Beginning with thousands of batteries if you drive a Model S.
"Right... that's why my Monroney sheet says my Tesla contains only 50% ""US/Canadian"" parts.  


It's an American-owned company with American factories and designers, making it more fully American than the vast majority of vehicles on the road, but it's not ""100% made in America."""
">	This is something tesla shluld push hard.. 100% made in America by Americans

And robots made in Germany, but the human workers are Americans!"
why? because it promotes the same primitive patriotic thinking that created these thugs in the first place?
"Wont happen, i am in that area and know several workers, the Union is rejecting Tesla for a few reasons, biggest being not enough market share which means not enough jobs to keep the members employed so they dont want to let gm off the hook for a bargaining agreement that was signed to keep jobs in Oshawa until 2021"

"Or solar, NC is behind only California for solar generation "
True. https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=NC  Looks like 26% for coal and nuclear.  36% for natural gas.  Greater than 50% is still on fossil fuels.
"Why are people downvoting this guy? Parts sources are literally right on the window sticker. It‚Äôs 50% US parts.

"or worse, kills people in an accident due to the impact zone (bumper) being raised up far above that of other vehicles on the road, slicing through the top of the other vehicle in an accident. "
"because creating a new car company is extremely difficult and just because someone like elon managed to do it, doesnt mean 99% of others who attempt it have a chance. at this point, anyone who isnt already a big auto manufacturer announcing an ev is very unlikely to be able to mass produce it. there's a reason why before tesla, there havent been a successful car startup in america for like 70 years. it's not a fluke that tesla didn't fail. just like it's not a fluke that spacex was the first private space travel company in the world. the only thing those two companies share is the ceo."
Because so far it‚Äôs vaporware.   
"I actually think they got an insane amount of attention. Considering they haven't proven anything in the real world and the fact that even truck/petrolheads got excited about this EV truck and took Rivian's word for it. Let's be real, what Rivian is promissing is quite a lot in terms of performance.

We shouldn't forget Faraday, Fisker, etc. And all these EV's from Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes underperforming their promisses.

So all things considered, they didn't have to fight as much skepticism as you'd expect."
"Because there hasn‚Äôt been another successful American car startup founded in close to 100 years, even with billions annually being poured into companies chasing the Tesla dream."
I had to look it up as I‚Äôd never heard of it. I live in the heart of truck country (Alberta). I‚Äôd love to see these in the roads. Maybe looking a little more traditional but the idea is great.
"Because one of these companies is a car manufacturer, the other is hope's and dreams. "
"Tesla had an advantage of having an excellent product (performance wise) and well ahead of the big players who were struggling through a recession.  Now that all large players are bringing some product to market \[and the demand has been proven\], I think 2022 by a small player is too little too late, but maybe I'll be surprised.  The one possible thing that new players have going for them is there are contract manufacturers out there who they could possible partner with, if the likes of Magna take them seriously, that would possibly be a much easier path than Tesla who's been doing manufacturing themselves and learning the hard way (although that was the best path for them, based on the stories)."
MKBHD on youtube put up a really great and educational video about this. Definitely check it out
Rivian is getting more attention than most any electric car besides Tesla...
"They will have a lot of attention once customer cars are on the road.  Every car company has claimed to have an amazing cheap long range electric coming by 2030, Rivian is probably getting drowned out in that noise but their truck will arrive before most of the others."

"The way I‚Äôd see it go in most situations is a trespassing route. Most superchargers are on private property (hotel, grocery store, etc), and I‚Äôm sure that the individual in charge of that property would not want someone doing this. In that case we are able to legally remove those people from the private property. If we can‚Äôt do trespassing we could work towards disorderly conduct. "
"Private property either way, cops could just trespass them off.  If they're not using the superchargers and they aren't shopping at any businesses there, there's legal precedence to remove them."
"For my agency a call like this would probably have two officers dispatched due to the nature (people being disorderly/loud). We‚Äôd arrive, run their names for local/national warrants, and if the owner of the property is requesting them to leave and they refuse, they go to jail. If we can‚Äôt do trespassing we could write them a noise ordinance violation or arrest for disorderly conduct if the noise continues. This situation really isn‚Äôt specific to supercharging stations, as this would apply to anyone acting disorderly on private property. "
"Even if the spot had a sign that said Teslas only it wouldn‚Äôt be a crime because parking issues are only civil. However if the property owner or other authorized person requests that the car be moved and they refuse, that is trespassing, which is a crime. The vehicle could also be towed by the owner if they wish. So basically it‚Äôs up to the manager of the property where the SC is located to do something about it. "
"I feel you, unfortunately I can‚Äôt speak for all of my peers. As with any large group of humans (hundreds of thousands of cops in the US) you will have all kinds of personalities and backgrounds.

"The fix lies in education, so racists like Regiplex appreciate and understand white privilege and perhaps that leads to more empathy.  Minorities are not doing something to provoke the disproportionately violent responses they face from police.  I think you understand how different a white person is likely to be treated than a minority but perhaps not how it colors perspectives on how government agents act.  So in a perfect world, yes, police should be there to protect and serve regardless of socioeconomic background but reality is not so neat."
"Regardless of what info you provide, there's always a chance cops will come in with force and people will get seriously hurt or killed.

The big three died because labour and unions killed them.  Their labour and legacy costs were way above the foreign competition, and the bailouts were done to keep all those jobs.  So they cut costs on the vehicles to afford the labour contracts, and made shit car for 30 years.  A normal company restructures under bankruptcy, sheds its contracts and starts over, but politically it was intolerable allow them to shed the union, take their medicine and get healthy again.

Why do you think that Tesla is silly?

"Yup. I know people who make six figures and drive Civics and Prius‚Äô, then you have people like me who never would‚Äôve considered spending more than $20k on a car...but bought a Tesla. 

Don‚Äôt judge people by their income, or by the car they drive. "
"I know a doctor who‚Äôs the head of an entire department for the largest hospital in LA. He drives a piece of shit twenty year old car that actually has electrical tape holding pieces together.

He just points to his jamika and leaves me to fill in the blank. "
Agreed. but it is a pretty good hint if it is such a big part of your identity that you would chant obscenities about a different type of vehicle.
"The number of millionaires driving regular ol‚Äô Prii (yes, that‚Äôs the official plural form) are... well, plentiful.

While a nice car can imply many things, it‚Äôs typically not *that* indicative of how much wealth someone has.

"Can confirm. A guy hit my sister in an old junker so we assumed he didn‚Äôt have any money for insurance, turns out he‚Äôs a lawyer making 7 figures living in a $2.5 million house."

" No, they‚Äôre shitty. This is all subjective... but shitty

Those are very shitty headlight and grill mods on what would‚Äôve been a very nice 80s F-series (edit: 90s! I‚Äôm moron) build. Would‚Äôve been nice to have a proper stance too, the reverse stance only works for Baja style trucks, IMO and I‚Äôm pretty sure he didn‚Äôt mean to, this was just a lazy front end lift to fit bigger tires, rear end looks stock. 

The Silverado in the middle had a shitty wannabe lift by cranking the shit out if the stock torsion bars til it cleared enough to fit those wheels/tires up front. Could‚Äôve saved a little on the tire/wheel brand/model choice and had enough for a proper lift that will make the truck ride correctly and align-able afterwards. 

The (what looks like ) Avalanche also suffers from poor choices, but in that case it‚Äôs more subjective Than the others. I wouldn‚Äôt go with tiny sidewalls on a lifted truck ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it looks like he at least did a proper lift or at least got blocks at the back to level it after cranking the torsion bars .. 

So, IMO, these guys have shitty trucks, not because they don‚Äôt have more expensive trucks, but because they do shitty things to them... much like their behavior at this restaurant "
"Not to mention, that‚Äôs household. The median income for a single person in America is only **$31,099**"

You are thinking of Socrates‚Äô lament in the Phaedrus dialogue.

In fact, it will introduce forgetfulness into the soul of those who learn it: they will not practice using their memory because they will put their trust in writing, which is external and depends on signs that belong to others, instead of trying to remember from the inside, completely on their own. You have not discovered a potion for remembering, but for reminding; you provide your students with the appearance of wisdom, not with its reality. Your invention will enable them to hear many things without being properly taught, and they will imagine that they have come to know much while for the most part they will know nothing. And they will be difficult to get along with, since they will merely appear to be wise instead of really being so."""

Now If I drive 10 miles without GPS, I‚Äôm lost. Knowing that I can reference what I read results in me working less to comit something to memory."
"Actually this is sort of true. Because we have the ability to have everything written down we never have to remember it. That‚Äôs why kids these fats are so forgetful, everything that have to remember is remembered for them by phones. "

"the model 3 hasn't even made it down to the price they told us it would be and it certainly missed being anywhere close during the good tax credit. That is why it missed badly on the price they told us it would be.

&#x200B;

Yeah its a car clearly positioned in the $40k+ market presently. The model 3 was always targeting the $35k market. That 30-35k mark has a huge market and that is where they will really hit a stride with mass production and economies of scale. They know that is the mark the model 3 needs to get to. They have so far completely failed to get there. I don't think they'll be there in a year when I'm car shopping.

I shopped around and some places did want to charge me a fortune, so I just stuck with Geico.

Fuel is obviously cheaper, even when I have to use superchargers. Free charging is coming to my work next year which will make this cost virtually nothing.

Can‚Äôt say what might happen out of warranty. I‚Äôm optimistic that most Model 3s won‚Äôt have a lot of maintenance issues. I‚Äôm only at 5k miles so we‚Äôll see."
"Correct me if I'm wrong but as someone with experience in the field of power distribution and formal electrician training I'm pretty sure they use a similar battery setup as a solar panel, (just without an inverter) and it will prevent the batteries from completely discharging which is what causes them to lose capacity in the first place, and as far as I know the Tesla batteries are designed to prevent that to begin with"

It's a combination of a bit of sentimental attachment, not just to that car in particular but to all the old sedans I've driven, and partly that it's just easier to keep driving what I have rather than get something else, and partly that when I got it a trucker mentioned he'd had one he sold at 300k miles still running and I got it at about 150k and am up to 190k and want to see what high score I can get...

"To whom are they more often polite? When you live in relatively homogeneous regions you run into fewer opportunities to be hostile or impolite. Regionally, southerners and rural folk do in general (from my perception) put more value on politeness and friendliness, but that's all superficial. If groups with opposing ideal frequently clash, the loudest among them will stand out more often. And where are these clashes most likely to occur? In Pike Co KY where conservatives have a heavy majority (~70%) and liberals keep their mouths shut, or in NYC where liberals have a similar majority but are confronted on a daily basis by the extravagances and and corruption of the wealthy, conservative leaning subset of their population which maintains a much higher relative control and exposure in their area than the liberal minorities could ever hope to achieve. 

The imbalanced perception of individuals of each party are less likely a reflection of the average quality of the people, but rather the tools and experiences available to each group. (Add in the fact that in general progressives by their very name seek improvement, while conservative seek stagnation. I know that this is not a good argument, but it does speak to the perception of pretentiousness on one side and boorishness on the other)"

Similarly with inspiring his employees.

Note that this is not simple Elon-worship on my part.  I first became a fan of Tesla through Martin‚Äôs words, and regarded Elon as just the money guy who was threatening Tesla‚Äôs success by insisting on too many changes to the Elise base.

"I think he was hung up on looking backward - he had his way of doing learning and knowing things, which was to memorize. He saw writing as the end of that, and therefore dismissed it outright. What he did not see was that by using writing, it would become possible to store and access a much larger volume of information, with greater accuracy, and with easier access for many, many more people.

I mean, just think of everything that can be learned from books, and then think what it would be like to try and learn all of that by rote memorization directly from another person. Also, consider that by removing the need for expending effort on rote memorization and replacing it with simply learning to read and write, you can then spend more effort on analysis, understanding, and application of the information.

Before you become too proud of your Model 3, keep in mind electric cars have been there since the beginning, even in the form of electric trains. There were even amazing hybrid / electric cars since at least 1900.

"In the US it runs mainly on natural gas and coal. It's not a bad thing though because power plants are a lot more efficient than a car engine. Like here in Virginia though your Tesla is powered by coal and nuclear energy. I would really like to see property owners turn parking lots into solar farms though. Your car would be cooler, you are protected by elements, and they can feed the grid. Electric cars really don't solve any enviormental issues at the moment. They put more load on our power grid which is already near capacity. It doesn't use renewable resources exclusively. Lithium mining is a mess and so is disposal. Or infrastructure needs to change and when it does EV does make more sense. For now though it doesn't help as much as it does save money because the energy cost is cheaper and uses existing infrastructure which is the part grid vs hydrogen which didn't catch on. Hydrogen has a bad rap and also no one is using it in bulk already so it's hard to implement.

That being said, being upset at solar power and EVs because they are different is absurd.

EPA is federal. Just because there's no state inspection doesn't mean it's not illegal. 
Since community policing is about solving long-term problems the officer could work with the store management for a long-term fix. Depending on state and city law you could post signs saying any non EV in the spot will be towed.  Target these kids with a zero-tolerance approach and let them know they will continue to get citations for lawful violations as long as they continue to harass other people.  If they're juveniles speak with their parents to find out if there is a solution.  Officers in non-committed downtime could watch the lot for continued harassment issues. Those are just a few ideas off the top of my head.

"> They‚Äôre just bored teenagers

If there‚Äôs anything both of us are guilty of is assuming the intentions of the owners/drivers of those trucks.  My fault was assuming they‚Äôre petrol heads who ideologically favor the tech they‚Äôre in love with and actively hate electric vehicles.  Your fault was assuming they‚Äôre just bored teenagers with no ideology spurring them and they‚Äôre just being teenagers.  We can‚Äôt really judge their actions without more information and I shouldn‚Äôt have jumped to conclusions.

As far as electric cars being only convenient now and being old tech, that doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that battery-powered autonomous propulsion has only now become feasible as a means of propulsion for cars and other vehicles.  It also seems to be the driver of many different future forms of transportation including, likely the fabled flying cars everyone has been looking forward to since the 80s.  The fact that gasoline powered engines have powered transportation for a hundred years doesn‚Äôt mean they will not be supplanted.

That false superiority you sense isn‚Äôt one.  If anything it‚Äôs a sense of hope and expectation of some great things to come with the knowledge that what is the bleeding edge right now will be considered primitive in just a couple decades and not being able to wait to see where things will be in 20 years.  Most of the time it‚Äôs a sense of being frustrated by a world which is on the cusp of a critical mass of electric vehicles (of all sorts) but not there yet so charging is still less convenient than filling gas has been the last 80 years."

However, BP estimated there's about 54 years of **proven** oil reserves (More on what it means to be ""proven"": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proven_reserves).

Now this doesn't take into account recent findings or oil that might be out in the middle of the ocean. Basically, BP is saying there's 54 years of ""easy to reach"" (read cheap for customers) oil.

And yes, Trump foolishly [EDIT: plans to do] away with the mandate. Sure, it'll be cheaper to make the vehicles, and I'm *sure these companies will pass the savings on to you, the customer, because they care*. But it does mean those driving these vehicles will have to fill up more often. - Have fun filling up twice a week (or more)!

*Note: I typically fill up about every two weeks; 30 mpg, and I rarely go 'for a drive'. Just work, grocery store, and errands that can't be mailed or completed online. So I can't imagine filling up more than ONCE per week at most."

"There is more electricity generated by nuclear and renewables in the US than from coal and oil. I meant to say coal in my above answer and I said fossil fuels so my bad, but coal and oil does make up only 30% of electricity generation in the US. Natural gas makes up 32% and is a fossil fuel however the emissions are 50-60% less than coal, but people like to say Tesla runs on coal because nobody fact checks it and lots of people want an excuse to keep their old fart machines. Nuclear makes up 20% and renewables make up 17%. So about 37% of it has a low to no carbon footprint, 32% is a medium carbon footprint, and 30% is high carbon footprint. That's not even taking into account the amount of energy produced for the amount of emissions which is far better for electricity running on coal than for an ICE. This is also only for general electricity. For Teslas many of the owners avail themselves of the free superchargers of which many of the non-indoor ones use solar at least partially, and many owners also use solar at home.

There's a fallacy that is rampant among people who resist change and that's if you can't make something 100% better then you should just leave it alone. Can't eliminate all mass shootings? Legislation is useless. EVs don't run on 100% emission-free sourced electricity? Better keep rolling coal.

When I compare the NHTSA rating for frontal and side collisions between my car and one I'm tentatively shopping for that is 20 years newer, the ratings are the same (5 star and 4 star, respectively).

Regardless, it baffles my mind that someone taking a stance against globalism (whatever that means to them) thinks that they're going to enact change by blocking tesla charging ports in random cities and being general assholes to people.

The global boogeyman is coming, and it's going to make the world a more successful and interesting place and there's nothing these fools can do about it."

"Yes yes, I‚Äôm not thinking, which is why what I‚Äôve made here are actual arguments and all you dullards have don‚Äôt is make personal attacks.

Here you are acting superior by literally engaging in nothing but insults.

It‚Äôs really a shame because if you were educated or capable of thinking critically you could learn from me or, if you were right, make a persuasive argument. 

But you‚Äôre just like the 1939s hitler youth brought up to think fascism is good and Jews are bad and you‚Äôre insulting me for defending jews.

And being smug about it. Just like they did.

Pathetic."
"It's just tribalism, pure and simple tribalism. A basic concept that drives countless aspects of human social interaction. In one case, it happened to lead to the Holocaust.

"If you can't see how you are framing the situation unfairly I'm not sure what else i can say. You keep mentioning opposition to human rights as if its an indisputable fact that the left attacks HR and the right protects them. But that depends on what you label as a human right; what one person might call the right to body autonomy is directly in opposition to what someone else calls the right to life, same thing applies to protection of sexual minorities vs religious freedom, border sovereignty vs right to pursue the American Dream.

I'm a lefty with strong libertarian sympathies, so i get how the left can appear through such a lens but surely you realize that nobody on either side starts their day thinking, ""today im gonna violate as many human rights as possible"" . Instead people evaluate their options and make judgement calls, sometimes in an effort to defend one freedom they can overstep another. Don't pretend that only one side is guilty of this, or that your characatures accurately reflect the motivations of either."
"Oh, it has nothing to do with a wet road.

"Very, very few. It‚Äôs one of the hardest industries to break into. Insane capital costs, thin margins, high volume, reputation. A failure in any one can kill a new car company.

Tesla had the advantage of being the first electric car company. So for lots of early adopters and enthusiasts it was the only choice so the had the demand early on when the roadster wasn‚Äôt good but cost a fortune. In this way it can actually be harmful. If you‚Äôre starting a new pickup and you need the demand and premium to support you capex but Tesla comes along and takes away half your market, if not more b/c their pickup will be better then it‚Äôs really tough.

Starting a volume car company anywhere is probably closer to magic."

Driving a 1997 full size vehicle is completely different.  Also, because I have a newborn and have been really interested in this recently, keep in mind that the star system is essentially ranking the vehicles from best to worst for that particular year and weight.  A 5 star vehicle from 20 years ago will probably not be 5 stars today.  I have a focus that got a decent rating.  I am looking at a much heavier vehicle that has the same stars but is much safer.  Hopefully this is helpful to you.  Good luck on your vehicle search!"

"Listen, the only reason I started talking is because of the obvious assholery of your original post about the trucks.     
> When it comes to grown ups and cars... shit talking is part of it, at least with gear heads...     
   
*I am* a gearhead and I grew up a long time ago. I grew up working on customs and muscle cars with my father, mostly doing work on other people's rides for his friends, and I currently own a couple of projects myself, which is why I don't act like an ass about other people's cars because I've done the work myself and helped others do it too and I know how owners feel when some jackass starts ragging on their pride and joy that has had months or years spent laboring on and working O/T to afford parts for. Honest critique? Sure, there's always room for improvement.Tongue in cheek teasing between owners? Sure, it's all part of the hobby, but to just call somebody's baby shitty? That's not cool at all, the owner remembers the large chunk of life, all of the late nights at work and the long weekends worth of time and effort it took to get it where it is, and *you just shit on him*.

Something about the interviewer just grinds my gears. The way she looks disgusted for some reason in the intro clip and the tone of her voice throughout just makes it seem like she has some vendetta against Tesla / Musk and won't let it go.

"I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how people hate this guy, especially when there are countless other Martin Shkreli‚Äôs in the world who will never see the inside of a jail cell.

"Of course it is, that was his goal from the start, though. Elon Musk outright stated that he wanted to create new markets to spur technological prospecting, not just from one company, but from all the major players. The ironic part is that if some other company came along and figured out a way to dominate Tesla on some measure, almost all of Tesla' innovator employees would be ensured future work, just under a different company banner, so he really can't say that specific version of Tesla going tits up is bad for the individual components of Tesla, it's just bad for one really cool name for an electric car company.

Even if there are better cars, there are no better companies than Tesla (and SpaceX) right now."
Won't be that hard. Someone just needs to make a car that's not in the shop every few weeks.

"Once Tesla rolls out $35K cars, it would be a lot of fun to watch a lot of Tesla‚Äôs in the road prompting other buyers to rethink their next new/used car purchase. 2022 would be a different landscape with sub 20K used Tesla‚Äôs hitting the market. "
Elon musk is my hero
"These giant car companies have had years to improve their designs. The best that they've come up with is push button start and ...? What else? Nothing. They've wasted their billions of dollars to keep pedaling the same shit they've had for 20 years. It's despicable. I'm ecstatic that Tesla is pushing the boundaries of what's possible and now every other car manufacturer is, supposedly, moving to the EV market. It's amazing how far a single company can push the market."
It‚Äôs actually spelled ‚Äúbankwupt‚Äù. Elon lovers will understand. 
"Tesla isn‚Äôt competing with other EV companies. It‚Äôs competing with, and destroying, the entire internal combustion vehicle market."
"Hyper capitalists are interpreting this as weakness and licking their chops. Meanwhile Tesla low-key kicks everyone's ass because (a) cult like fan support and (b) such a head start they will out innovate the large corporations that are supporting an over abundance of middle managers, unions and bloated bureaucracy"
He's not in it for the end game of money. It's to better the human race.
"That's awesome. It's not about having the best electric car but about seeing a electric car market, about seeing less gasoline fueled vehicles on the road. I admire Elon Musk's attitude very much.

Plus, this is a good competition for other companies as well. People have choices to choose from and companies have opportunities to improve the quality of their cars that drive customer's decision. 

Good all around. :)"
"Thank you Elon. 

That is all. "
"Elon is such a boss... it‚Äôs funny to see how people have a hard time wrapping their head around his vision of the future (Renewable energy, space flight, electric cars)... ‚ÄúWhy do you want the competition?‚Äù Ummm... why not? He‚Äôs trying to push the damn oil companies out and make EVs available to everyone, competition pushes prices down, making this happen."
Wow. I'm speechless.  Gives my 'investment' all the more conviction
Is there somewhere to find the full interview?
"...but it doesn't need to be better in order to sell more, it just needs to be cheaper and sufficient. The model T wasn't the best car on the market during its time. "

"Looks like he is tearing up/crying I wonder why, if not why does he look that way?"
Yep
They‚Äôre still making Fords aren‚Äôt they?
My man! For real.. the world would be a better place with more people like him.
At first I thought the thumbnail was Elon with [his mom](https://www.instagram.com/mayemusk/).
Agreed...but does he actually not truly think he will make a better car ever than say mercedes? 
How nice. Now I support Tesla. This ethical businessman has won me over alright!
anyone have full video link?
I really like this guy
"This is easy to say when you're at the top and nobody is close, yet."
What a great attitude by the CEO of Tesla.
5years from now VW will make better e cars. But you have the semi by then;)
"Drivers of the World: ""Yessss!!!!""

Stockholders of Tesla: ""Nooooooo!!!!"""
"I have not watched this clip yet, but it's good to hear he's talking about this aspect of the technology. It can be duplicated. 

"
No doubt the stockholders will be reassured.
They won‚Äôt though. They don‚Äôt know how
"I went to look at the Jaguar e-pace this week, it's a normal looking small SUV.  Great boot and range.

I couldn't have a test drive as the battery was flat.

I asked for a future test drive three days after vising the dealership.  A sales guy called after six days and declared he was taking over and would look after me getting a drive.  Still no test drive or call to book one.

Looks like I will stay in my S."
Challenge accepted. 
"Paging apple. Also, ain‚Äôt nice message to sent to all the shareholders "
Elon will be living on Mars when that happens.
Love this guy 
He a good man
This attitude is exactly why Tesla won‚Äôt go bankrupt.
"I honestly think in my heart of hearts that elon is probably one of the most awesome people on this planet.

"
Elon's a good guy at heart
This man.  I wish I were this man. Not for any of the money. For the pure fulfillment he must feel in helping humanity. 
"This is a great, sportsmanlike, all-around virtuous outlook to have. He's driven by the deeper meaning of creating these vehicles, not just the business side of it. And that's why he won't lose to any competition."
"I love you, Elon!!"
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be happy to make the batteries.‚Äù Is what he should have said.
Stand up guy. 
Imagine the look on the VCs faces hearing that... 
Ehh I still think when companies like Toyota start to heavily focus on electric vehicles it's only going to be a matter of time before they're either at par or ahead with Tesla's tech. 
"Uh, they also are positioned to make the majority of lithium battery‚Äôs on the market. So he doesn‚Äôt care who makes the cars, he‚Äôs makes the gasoline. "

Ehm yes why wouldn't it be?

"Hydrogen fuel cell motors are the future, and Musk probably knows it."
"Finally he tweets something pleasant to hear. I love Tesla, dislike him, but a greener future is better for everyone. "
He has SpaceX to fall back on. Take that away from him and let‚Äôs see how gentle he would go into that good night.

"HYDROGEN! It's still electric, [just the fuel is so much more dense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#Energy_densities_of_common_energy_storage_materials), both by volume and weight compared to batteries. Even with conversion losses include, [you can get farther with less weight than the Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Clarity).

Converting wind energy (and a bit of water) -> a stored fuel doesn't seem that hard. It's retro-fitting fuel stations and building onsite tanks for hydrogen that's the difficult thing. It'd probably be cheaper to build whole new gas stations.

*It's not exactly cost effective to switch our natural gas lines to it yet. [Maybe if people weren't so afraid of nuclear](https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1577_web.pdf).*


Edit: Downvotes for competition, seems about right..."
This and other things the CEO of a publicly traded company should be thrown out for saying in public.  
"Good job abc you Stone age fucking dinosaur. Trust me I'm not tuning in, so open up your fucking YouTube. "
"they dont have to make a better one, Elon, they just have to make one that does not have a waiting list...."

"Elon does not want compatition. He wants money. Tesla can not make a cheap car in large amounts. They won't be able to do that for a long time. He would rather make fewer cars like the roadsters that demand hundreds of thousands of dollars for one car. Same tech, materials and line. Elon never wanted to speak to the mass. It was just a way to raise money for his you rockets."
"Your phone or computer have to be rebooted daily...and you think you can let auto pilot drive 70mph on a hwy safely? Really.
T
Its a joke....no one is safe...if you have onstar they can hack your car today and take over your steering -people are dying from it- being killed!. Targeted!
You wait 16 yrs to be excited to drive and now you think its cool to let a human programmed car have control? Wake up America"
"Exactly, competition is the sole reason we‚Äôve been seeing amazing progresses in the automotive industry (yes, even just in the ICE world) over the years, so it should remain so even after EV becomes mainstream.

Right now if you want a high end EV Tesla is pretty much the best choice for most people, and while that‚Äôs good for me as a shareholder, that‚Äôs also the reason why Tesla can get away with selling me a $60k car that has worse phone/music integration than a Honda Civic.

Competition benefits all consumers."

"It's why I hate it when I see people shitting on Elon and Tesla. He's the real life Tony Stark and the world needs that right now. If he can't make a  difference alone, he can definitely inspire a change. "
Exactly why they made parts of the car public domain for others to use and improve upon.
"I don‚Äôt see Tesla having that problem. I‚Äôve always spent a portion of my money on luxury cars, the tesla is soooo much more intuitive. Yes other car makers will make fast electric cars that are luxurious and sexy. However i feel like they will feel like clunky flip phones to use  where Tesla is like an apple product.

The design and functionality of Tesla is going to be hard to beat. 

My last fkn range rover would take 5 minutes to connect to spotify and disconnect all the time. The buttons and the complicated crap make it feel like a horse and carriage compared to the tesla."
"Well said. It's mission is to help the world, not just make a bunch of money."
and strong competition also forces smart workarounds for problems and it forces the companies to make better cars at a lower price.
"It‚Äôs just a shame that car manufacturers are in so deep with big oil, they refuse to embrace the future."
"Competition is only good for everyone when there is a moral objective and carefully defined rules of conduct. Just because a private company is paving the way for a better, more sustainable future doesn‚Äôt mean we can ignore that competition for the sake of wealth accumulation is one of the biggest reasons for why electric vehicles are so desperately needed now. 

Competing for money is what caused [Exxon and Shell](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings) to stifle research showing the disastrous effects of fossil fuel use in the 1980s. Competition is what drives war, poverty, and inequality. Competition is a mechanism that effectively drives progress, regardless of whether that progress is good or not. "
"""competition"" is a funny choice. If you think of IP laws, they are designed to increase competition, but they don't always succeed at that. 

I think it's worth noting that it's the skill sharing and community of ""competition"" that allows new cool things to happen.

"I guess I'm a new breed of shareholder. Investing in something I believe in, not just what I think will make me tons of money. "
"No, shareholders are BANKING on Elon committing to his mission statement. His mission statement is what creates loyal customers. Customers so loyal that they are willing to help a company deliver cars without any compensation. Go look up the Golden Circle. Loyal customers are loyal due to the ""why"" of a company..and there is really nothing more powerful than having the ""why"" to be ""saving the world"". "
"On the surface, that would be a true statement.  However, the ""open source patent pledge"" comes with some fairly hefty caveats (think of these as IP open source reciprocity) - which as a shareholder, I have zero issue with.  

From a legal review synopsis of the pledge:

>Tesla's Patent Pledge presents companies in the electric vehicle field with a tremendous opportunity, but one that also carries some substantial risk.¬† Agreeing to abide by the Pledge could significantly curtail a company's ability to protect, defend, and assert its own intellectual property.¬† A company should weigh these implications against the benefits of using the technology before deciding to take advantage of Tesla's offer.¬† If the company does decide to use Tesla's technology, it should put processes in place to ensure that it does not violate the conditions of the Pledge and, as a result, lose the protections that it provides.

&#x200B;"
"This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who has been following Tesla for more than a minute. It's literally their mission statement. If it makes investors nervous, then they don't understand the company or the reason why it resonates with people. Think different, etc."
That they fret at all is the reason why Elon wanted to take the company private.  
"I love my car but I don‚Äôt think this comment is totally sincere. It sounds good though, and it is the right attitude. But I take it with a grain of salt.

I would much rather see future-facing companies like Tesla as worker co-operatives than as traditional corporations, but that‚Äôs just me I guess. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Call me when he opens the supercharger network to other cars.  
I guess Elon hasn't seen the new jaguar I pace. Way better than the model x
Capitalism at its best. 
Robinhood?
"It will be interesting to see if GM is really just retooling those plants for EV production or if they really are closed for good?  I hope it is GM doing a massive retooling, but I'm expecting it is GM just falling on its sword in what may be a death spiral.

It wasn't as if Bob Lutz wasn't aware of EVs, and how he got to drive the original engineering prototype (not even the production car) for the Tesla Roadster when Martin Eberhardt was on tour trying to get some people interested in buying Tesla products.  According to Lutz, driving the Roadster around Detroit that day with Eberhardt in the passenger seat was a defining day that he knew EVs were coming into the market in a serious way.  Too bad GM had to make that silly hybrid vehicle instead of a real EV with that kind of head start."

"Have you watched the documentary ""who killed the electric car""? They not only knew....well I'll let you watch and see for yourself. "
"It's really quite simple. Tesla is the disruptor, and GM (+ other traditional automakers) are the disrupted.  They stopped caring about making the best cars (if they ever did) a long time ago.  Now their business is about keeping dealers, and labor, and shareholders, and the business hierarchy they've built over the last 100 years happy. "
"Oh they did, [even over 20 years ago](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1). It was just lobbied away. "
Lol at this guy comparing a car company that's been through two world wars with the one who still doesn't know how to put a car together properly. 
I‚Äôd love an EV but they are just too much still. 
"I was born in India. I have been to Delhi and other major Indian cities a few times with family. Every time that I have visited them, I always end up wearing a handkerchief or holding a cloth over my nose and mouth. The air quality on ground during the day time was absolutely horrid. It's like directly breathing in car exhaust by putting your face next to it. Add that with humidity, it is simply an indescribable experience.

I cannot wait for the day when electric cars and other electric vehicles are a commonplace in all countries. "
">he world is too busy staring down at everything below while the sky is turning dark.

Dang"
Some people claim that making an electric car is very detrimental to the environment. So much that they question the benefits of using electric cars over petrol cars. The West would just move the pollution their car produce to China (and would make them richer than the emirates in the process).
"I think this is intentional, and some could argue good reporting. She‚Äôs taking the stance that the average uninformed person would. You, who have likely read up on Tesla and understand their mission are viewing the interview with a different lens than someone who still doesn‚Äôt understand Tesla, which I would argue is the common person. So she‚Äôs responding in ways that an average person might: ‚ÄúElon owns company. Company needs success. Success means staying ahead of competition. You opened your patents? What the fuck are you thinking?‚Äù

She‚Äôs laying out the attitude, tone, and dumbfoundedness of the average person and letting Elon speak to that. A moment of education and real information, speaking right to the person to hopefully educate them on the bigger picture.

Edit: parents -> patents"

I think that's Leslie Stahl. She's a very experienced reporter (mostly on the political side).
"People hate him because he's an asshole. He's also a genius visionary. He's also a megalomaniac. He's also committed to bringing humanity to the next level of advancement. He's also, seriously, an asshole.

He can be all those things. I personally dislike the guy, but I'm fully supportive of and enamored with the things he's doing.

Our heroes are people too."
">Every piece of media I‚Äôve ever seen on Musk is about him trying to make the world a better place by playing a role in innovation/tech. 

You missed a LOT of news about this guy, didn't you?"
">  when there are countless other Martin Shkreli‚Äôs in the world who will never see the inside of a jail cell.

Didn't he get 7 years?"
"Ppl hate him because the general population spends 5 hours a day watching shit television.  The bulk of the population, if they have heard of Musk, Tesla or SpaceX, couldn‚Äôt tell you more than one or two facts and even those tiny bits of information will probably be wrong.   We live in a society that is for the most part both history and science illiterate, a ‚Äòheadline‚Äô culture that rarely reads more than that, if they read at all.  That being said.  What a time to be alive! Haha "
*billions*
A lot of what people criticize about him are the working conditions at Tesla. Then some hate was added during the Thai cave thing.
"He's probably a dick to work for, based on the churn in the top level at Tesla. He's probably so obsessed that he lives and breathes Tesla and Space X, and anyone not buying into the same level of obsession can't survive along side. But there is no doubting the commitment, when Tesla was in financial straits he held off the bankruptcy, by ploughing the last of his money into it. It's frightening and awe-worthy!"
If he wants to better society he should start by not exploiting his workers ü§î
"If his is adored by the masses, that poses a threat to the heads of industries and nations that are reliant on fossil fuel consumption, such as Russia, other car manufacturers, non-renewable power companies, etc.

Some people just like to be edgy and hate on good things, but I would be shocked if there's not also people actively working to undermine him and sway the court of public opinion."
"to quote the great Mr. James Franco from The Interview : ""They hate us coz they anus "" üòÅ"
"Just because his company does good things doesn't mean he's good. He's an asshole, a MAJOR one at that, though he's one of the rare assholes who created (and currently is a part of) something that's doing good things. Everyone talks about separating the art from the artist, that's what you have to do with Elon Musk, because he is undeniably an asshole, but Tesla shouldn't fail. "
"I mean it is, but at the same time it's sort of naive to think Tesla is a monopoly by any means "
"His net worth is over $20 billion and he got his dick slapped by the SEC by breaking federal law. Are you serious with this bullshit? He absolutely cares about his own pocket, he‚Äôs been trying to get back at short sellers for years. "
"We‚Äôre getting closer to the dream - check out the Hyundai Kona.

"The whole point of patents is that they‚Äôre both world readable and time limited.

There‚Äôs a concept of a ‚ÄòDeclared Value System‚Äô where every year you say ‚Äúthis is how much I want to be paid for someone to make this patent public domain‚Äù and your patent fee is a small percentage of that figure. I don‚Äôt think any country has implemented it yet, but my political party wants to introduce it. 

The issue with patents in tech is that the pace of innovation is far faster than the patent lifetime."
Tesla‚Äôs aren‚Äôt on average.
"This is a recent explanation that that covers the impact of taking Tesla up on their open source offer: 

https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ca6c332f-2cc5-401b-b80d-36473d0754c7
"
"A Patent grants the issuer a monopoly over the invention they designed.  When elon says hes open sourced it, he basically is saying that they have promised in a legally binding manner that anyone can use the invention as listed in their open source licence without fear of being sued. 
Not all open source licences are equal, some require simple attribution, some require you to also share what you develop. I don't know the exact licence they have used, but that would be an interesting read."
Musk 2020
"Uhhhh well fuel efficiency continues to trend upward, engines turn themselves off at stop lights, every car seems to have a reverse camera and it may have been a couple of years ago now but the enormous improvements in quarter mile times of muscle cars was really impressive and made me believe they've figured stuff out. "
"> These giant car companies have had years to improve their designs. The best that they've come up with is push button start and ...? What else? Nothing. 

The push start function was invented by Mercedes-Benz who also pioneered automotive safety. I'm curious to know what your basing this comment on. I suppose you haven't paid attention to cars until Teslas came out is that correct?"
What an ignorant comment. 
"Push-button start? I had that on my ‚Äô66 Land Rover, and the ‚Äò50s-vintage line-repair truck I drove for the city in the ‚Äò70s."
"Go back 20 years and show me a turbo four cylinder that makes almost 300 ftlbs of torque and a couple hundred horsepower and pulls down 30mpg. Safety has improved a ton. Emissions have improved a ton. Connectivity has improved a ton. Reliability has improved a ton. And so on and so on. Tesla does good things but it so ridiculous you people try to change history to praise a car company like Tesla. The electric motor isn‚Äôt revolutionary and the battery tech improvements had absolutely nothing to do with Tesla. The modern car didn‚Äôt start with them, it is so annoying to hear people say things like this. It‚Äôs pure ignorance. Hell, they didn‚Äôt even develop automated driving, that shit has been in development for far longer than Tesla has been even an idea. "
Lol yeah right because the car industry wasn‚Äôt already doing that before the Model S. The ignorance of Tesla fanboys is sometimes astounding
Oh no. This doesn‚Äôt happen to be related to any of Elon‚Äôs tweets does it?
"Elon is Macro, while everyone else is Micro. "
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality
"These are teasers, full 1 hour should be out on Sunday."
"The key to business is not to always be in the #1 position. The key is to always diversify and improve. 

I do not have an MBA. But the companies that survive and thrive are always diversifying and improving. That's what I have observed. 

The problem most companies have is finding the talent to help them do that, and the financial backing to expand or diversify. 

And there are soooo many companies that try to cut corners on quality, or resort to unethical products (e.g. the banking industry, and the higher education industry), to try to turn a profit. And yes, cheating customers is one way to turn a profit. The banking system has those methods perfected.

But the great companies stick to quality and innovation to turn a profit.  The bad companies that cut corners to make shareholders temporarily happy, only become hated over time. "
I really don't know why this got downvoted. Elon Musk is to me one of the few people acctually trying to make the world a better place. Of course he makes misstakes but that's just human.
What I also love about Elon Musk is that he often doesn't portrait himself as the billionaire he is. He shows time to time again that he's just some dude with the passion to make the world a better place and that he has the same problems like most other people have too. He also likes alot of common stuff and even some less comon stuff like anie and he fully embraces it.
That isn't why he does anything lol.  He is in it for the money 100%
"I mean... can‚Äôt we all try to reach this? What is stopping you? 

Just... like read his bio? Start doing things like he does? Just become like Elon? 

Like being real serious to anyone else who reads this.... what‚Äôs up with the concept of wishing to be like some just reverse engineer their frameworks of the brain and see if you can train your mind to think like they do.

Just curious no foul intended just thought it was an interesting comment. "
"Dude, autopilot! "
Everybody makes mistakes. Some people make them in the public eye. 
The point is that these are not the kind of values that are rewarded in a competitive money oriented society.
"Who said anything about going gentle into the night? 

He'll fight as hard as ever, but you know what? He'll enjoy that fight. 

In his mind no matter who wins, the planet/humanity's future wins. That's the goal here for him."
"I think you're missing a few points here. He doesn't give a fuck about money, nor personal fame and glory. He is trying to push our species forward. Full stop. While the rest of humanity pisses away resources and time on entertainment, Musk is making serious attempts to use the one & only life he gets to *do* something productive."
"Nah, he doesn't, not anymore. He's leveraged the shit out of it for Tesla. If one falls, they all do."
"Do the math on conversion efficiency to go from water to powering your car, you will find it's very inefficient. It's not just a bit of wind power to make it work its 50% more power then required via direct electricity and batteries. Hydrogen sounds great until you actual map out the logistics and energy costs. 

Sorry, it will never beat battery tech with the costs of batteries dropping. Unless a much more advance way to get hydrogen 8s found. Using natural gas as the source for hydrogen is more efficient but then why not just burn the natural gas in the cars directly, seems like an unneeded extra step. 

I always liked the idea of exhaust pipes only releasing water vapor, but it's never going to be mainstream.

Now nuclear on the other hand, that has always and will always have promise, but it will be nuclear with battery cars not hydrogen cars."
"I'm not afraid of nuclear, just see that it's not cost-effective to build new ones. How much hydrogen can we get from VC Summer?"
"Hmm, like Bezos that has recently repeatedly claimed that Amazon will go bankrupt, and he sees his job to delay tue inevitable? This is real life, nothing gonna last forever and you have to keep long term goals in mind to not be leapfroged and distrupted. I actually prefer leadership that realizes this and motivates employees like this "
Like the Bolt or the Leaf? I don't see them making Tesla bankrupt.

"I mean, my 40K Nissan has worse phone music integration than a honda civic

Fucking Nissan..."
"I‚Äôm very excited to see what the future holds for EVs. For example, the new Porsche, Audi, and Mercedes EVs looks pretty damn nice, and their existence has a lot to do with competition. "
My Honda Clarity just coughed. 
"Competition and regulation. Without fuel economy mandates, cars would be much different."
Yet everyone seems to hate capitalism 
"I would say that Tesla is the sole reason. I guess you could say that‚Äôs competition to the car industry in general but in another sense it‚Äôs basically Tesla driving it forward mostly on their own. Other companies are trying to compete, but it‚Äôs not really a question of competition at this point. It‚Äôs one company setting an example. "
"I love my bmw i3. Other than not having a big touchscreen and a much smaller range, it feels better than a model 3 in a way, and I got it for under $20k. Like it feels like a big go-kart because the tires are so thin."
lack of competition in the CPU market for a good decade arguably slowed down Moore's law.
"But you are missing his point. He is saying ‚Äúco-operating with open patents is a better thing for the world‚Äù. NOT COMPETITION! Don‚Äôt you listen?? 
Open patents is not competition, it‚Äôs co-operation!! "
Why do you need phone integration? Tesla has the best tech in the industry. Two very different schools of thought I guess but I think Android Auto and CarPlay are trash. 
All this 'amazing progress' fucked up the planet beyond point of no return.
"It's a shame how that sub is. There are problems with capitalism that need addressing but it's drowned out now because of crazy folks like that. Now I can't say something like ""we need more regulation in capitalist economies"" without sounding like one of them and getting a lot of hate. "
"There are plenty of valid reasons to shit on both Musk and Tesla. But people like you worshipping him like a cartoon hero are really highlighting what his *real* skillset is; Making people buy his ideas. He is up there with Steve Jobs and Donald Trump when it comes to making people believe his gospel, and if you are in the target demographic, everything he says and does will smell like roses and unicorn farts.



"
"I mean,  there's verifiable proof that Tesla has an insane amount of severe workplace injuries and safety issues. And won't allow these employees to seek out medical treatment.  And underpays them. But yes,  he's a motherfucking hero. Give me a fucking break. "
"No one has used a single one of them. To do also gives Tesla permission to use any of their patents, and no one would ever take that deal."
"They didn't do that. Anyone who wants to use the ""free"" Tesla patents has to allow Tesla to use **any** patents of theirs **for free**."
"I thought Tesla wouldn‚Äôt allow owners to work on their own car or buy parts?

"They're not necessarily ""in deep with big oil"", they sit on billions of assets, R&D cost, and trained personnel specific to internal combustion engines. They are also publicly traded companies that need to justify their actions to shareholders in terms of profitability.

Competition from ""pioneer plants"" like Tesla is what is needed for them to transform. They need to be able to point at something like the Model 3 to justify the investment.

EDIT: Regulation is another factor. With Tesla on the stage, large auto makers can no longer argue that ""EVs are 15 years away"". Even Germany with its reliance on the car industry is getting tired of their shit."

"I would definitely say this to perspective Tesla shareholders:  If you don't believe in Elon Musk and fail to understand his vision of what he is trying to accomplish with the company, then don't invest.

This is something you don't find in any of the Elon Musk companies:

> The purpose of this company is to maximize profits and increase shareholder equity.

If you want those kind of companies for investment, there are hundreds of them on NYSE and NASDAQ.  Find out about the company first before you invest, which is a generally wise thing to do anyway rather than relying on if some stock broker recommends a stock due to having heartburn that day or not and found from his Tarot deck that the company might do well in the future."

"I really do love Elon Musk...even the asshole parts.  I just kinda lol it off and find it entertaining in a ‚Äúholy shit we live in a fucking meme reality now‚Äù kind of way.  But even as an admitted fanboy, dude is undeniably an arrogant douche at times.  We all probably are at times, I know I am, so I don‚Äôt hold it against him myself...but I don‚Äôt understand why so many of his fans try to pretend he‚Äôs some purely benevolent humanitarian incapable of exercising poor judgment and needs every action justified and defended.  I think it‚Äôs okay and understandable if you genuinely and truly don‚Äôt like the guy.  

But I would caution a lot of people that seem to view him as some snake in the grass bastard conman pretending to care about bettering humanity through the interests or companies he pushes only to gain money or fame or influence, just remember that we‚Äôre all complex and have good and bad parts of ourselves.  It‚Äôs easy to criticize or hate things you don‚Äôt understand. The life he‚Äôs leading is extraordinary and unique so I don‚Äôt expect us all to relate or understand him all the time.  That is not a pass for him or his worst behavior, but try to consider his net positive to the world against his net negatives.  I think viewing him that way does make him a quite admirable at least in a broad legacy ‚Äúhow will you be remembered?‚Äù type of sense.  

But again, if you think Elon Musk is just the worst, I mean you‚Äôre opinion of him based on his public (particularly Twitter) behavior, that is a valid and justified option.

He means that the fact Shkreli faced some penalty as a rich person is rare. The fact that he was doing terrible things to earn lots of money is not. 
"He did, because he screwed over other rich people, not because of anything else."
"I think that view will change over the next 5 years.  Their market share of electric cars in the US is of monopoly proportion, about 50% market share in the US. And production capacity has so far been the limiting factor not demand.

Their market power is also obfuscated by selling disparate products of cars, solar panels, and power grid products, but even if those products are not monopolies of their own verticals (which they are seeking to be) that combination has incredible competitive advantage.  They have a vertically integrated power production, storage, and grid sales solution.  So they can collect sun power, control when it is sold to the grid and when excess is stored to batteries, which can take a mediocre margin on selling a car and juice it many times over - something not enjoyed by any other automaker.  Same with self driving ride share.  I don't expect them to ever outcompete Uber out of existence - and they don't need to.  But by allowing people to monetize their cars it reduces the barriers to buy and further juices the margins of the same product.  Long run, traditional auto makers simply will not be able to compete on something they already make a lower margin on than Tesla (most sell EVs at zero profit, Tesla makes healthy margin without these extra monetizations)."
I think thats more of a personal vendetta than anything. Its like some guy coming up and telling your kid to go fuck off and die cause he thinks your kids dream is bullshit. As a parent you personally intervene there. Tesla is Elons baby. When people start wishing death on his baby hes going to fight back. 
"Consumer Reports has Tesla at #27 on the reliability list.  So yes, they are far far below average in terms of reliability.  "
Good link. It explains why this claim has always been marketing and not ever been taken seriously by other manufacturers. 
"From what I just read parties have to be 'acting in good faith' and of the three clauses stated the second one states (a party is acting in good faith as long as they have not:) ""challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent; or""  So my reading is 'you can use my patents if I can use yours'."
">without fear of being sued.

Well, I don't think Tesla really want to throw around the capital of suing companies that are as big as themselves or larger. I don't think they would benefit from that at all, and they probably would be buried in paperwork by VW group or Toyota if that were the case anyway."

">Do the math on conversion efficiency to go from water to powering your car, you will find it's very inefficient. It's not just a bit of wind power to make it work its 50% more power then required via direct electricity and batteries. Hydrogen sounds great until you actual map out the logistics and energy costs.

I know the math. 40% losses from water -> hydrogen. Another 40% loss from hydrogen -> electricity. These materials will also get better over time. If people were throwing money at PEM fuel cell catalyst like they were batteries, we'd probably have gone from 60% to 80%.

However, looking at just ""percentages"", you do realize that solar panels are only 20% efficient, right?

If you noticed, I dropped a link to nuclear hydrogen generation which is more efficient due to its high temperatures. It could easily provide a baseline production and help age out coal plants (and replace oil consuming cars). Perhaps we should just leave the natural gas where its at rather than distributing the environment? 

>Sorry, it will never beat battery tech with the costs of batteries dropping. Unless a much more advance way to get hydrogen 8s found. Using natural gas as the source for hydrogen is more efficient but then why not just burn the natural gas in the cars directly, seems like an unneeded extra step.

Batteries are resource intensive items.

[The demand for resources are literally creating a humanitarian crisis](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2018/09/26/blood-batteries-cobalt-and-the-congo/).

>Now nuclear on the other hand, that has always and will always have promise, but it will be nuclear with battery cars not hydrogen cars.

And this is where the conservation ends... we're decades, if not centuries, away from miniaturizing nuclear reactors to the size of cars.

Edit: Reason why the conservation ends."
"Around 55,304,000 kg per year using electrolysis, at around 125 kwh / kg.  Enough to drive nearly 3 billion miles. Rough math puts that single plant as putting out roughly 1/900th of our petro supply. 899 more of those reactors producing hydrogen would be enough to get Americans everywhere in cars per year.

I'd assume a few hundred more for jets and boats to complete reduce our green house gas emissions to zero for transportation; removing 25% of carbon emissions. Probably less than 2500 nuclear facilities to get rid of over half of our carbon emissions (once you replace electricity generation).

There's a more efficient ways to produce hydrogen from nuclear technologies though. Plants that are designed to output hydrogen or electricity directly rather than just electricity."

Jaguar I pace! 
Are there any EVs from traditional manufacturers that come even close to Tesla?
"Agreed.  Remember how hard companies fought and successfully held back to some degree US safety and emission standards?  The fight against stricter greenhouse gas standards is still happening in the US and EU.  In the US, the worst actors are pressing government to dial back fuel economy standards right now, while simultaneously dropping car models and shifting focus to more profitable trucks and SUVs ‚Äî after pressing to keep looser standards for larger vehicles a decade ago.  Arguments were made that trucks/SUVs were still a small part of the market and trends showed they would decline.  Now the argument is tighter standards are tough to meet due to market demand for larger, thirstier vehicles, so autos drop poorer selling vehicles.

This is probably the place to insert government‚Äôs role in directing markets to achieve societally beneficial outcomes.  A gas tax increase would likely reshape the market to promote clean, energy efficient cars and trucks at a lower cost, but is too politically unpopular in the US and is fought by companies through political control.  

Instead government relies on incentives ‚Äî to both the companies and their customers.  Rebates and tax credits are expensive ways to shift markets to avoid direct market steering regulation.  

Government also directly funds research and provides tax breaks for private research to develop new technologies.  In the latter case, the companies keep the tax-funded intellectual property for their own profit.  Elon is breaking this mold by offering some developments to other companies to promote more rapid introduction of electric vehicles to the market ‚Äî at the expense of Tesla cornering the market for short-term profit."

"Raw capitalism leads to Monopoly in the vast majority of cases.

Idealism like this gets kicked out of most endeavors in capitalist society.

What would actually happen as long as Tesla is big enough is that Elon would be told by the board to do something to eliminate the threat while it is starting up, he'd refuse and he'd be fired, and his successor would be forced to either pressure the competition out the market before they can get started, or to buy them out and suppress their product, or to lobby for laws to delay/suppress their product.

If the competition is another company who is big enough (an existing car company), then they would subsume Tesla rather than the other way around.

The only reason this hasn't happened already in the car industry is major anti-monopoly legislation across the world. Capitalism doesn't work without government holding back its excesses, and it doesn't work at all for providing things people need, which is most of what people interact with.

Housing, utilities, internet, roads, healthcare. None of these things are well handled by a free market, because they all have very limited power for the consumer."

"I agree with you, but at this point I think it is the only way that GM can survive into the 2030's if they jump into EVs in a big way.

"Hey, I like my Volt :("
"> I wonder if GM shareholders had voted on EV development 10 years ago

They did vote on EV development 10 years ago.  They got the Volt.

Then 2008 happened and GM was taken over by the U.S. federal government and became ""Government Motors"".  Share value went to zero, so what they thought didn't matter any more.  Oddly enough though, the Volt survived that transition and bankruptcy but couldn't survive the introduction of the Tesla Model 3.  I think that says a whole lot about Tesla more than anything else.

*Edit*: One thing to point out that even Elon Musk remarked about with the Volt:  GM dealerships didn't really care to push the Volt and weren't committed to its sales.  Sure, there would be a Volt in the showroom, but then they would have other cars next to it that would (for the salesmen) offer a better commission and they would direct customers to those other vehicles.  This is why (among other reasons) Tesla refuses to go the dealership route since most of the dealerships would be bought up by people who just don't care about EVs where even the Model 3 would suffer the same fate as the Volt if it was permitted to happen.  GM dealerships also didn't make nearly as much in terms of service calls with EVs where they make a whole lot of money in after sales income compared to internal combustion engines.  Basically the standard industry dealership model works against the introduction of electric vehicles, and GM is currently suffering from the result of that."
The bailout is why I will never support GM. They're dead to me. They gave nothing back to the society that saved their asses (not by choice) and in fact are back to actively taking. They could release the 20k 300 mile EV and I won't touch it.

The Ipace is impressive. When compared to the model X the Jaguar is way better.

In Australia, we have a free market, capitalist economy with some socialist principles. 

The ones who use us as a fine example of socialism sometimes neglect the capitalist components that helped build our economy. 

People see our free health care and say ""see? Socialism works!"", but we're not exclusively socialist. The free market here is just regulated much differently. We also see such socialist principles as coexisting with our capitalist economy in such a way that it benefits everyone. 

As a result, we happen to have one of the highest rates of personal wealth in the world, so we're not ""evil commies who takes people's money to subsidise other people's healthcare"""

">Raw capitalism leads to Monopoly in the vast majority of cases.

Exactly. A lot of people appear to think the universe owes us some sort of magic bullet socio-economic system. It doesn't, and there isn't one. Systems like capitalism and socialism work under specific assumptions that are never met 100% in reality.

Capitalism was proposed to address the flaws of mercantilism. Socialism was proposed to address the flaws of capitalism. In reality, no country on Earth fully implements any of those. The most successful approach has been a generally free market with (hopefully) prudent government oversight. 

\> Housing, utilities, internet, roads, healthcare. None of these things are well handled by a free market, because they all have very limited power for the consumer. 

Exactly and those are all areas where competition makes limited sense. One of my friends, who is very market liberal, had a great metaphor: ""I'll be in favour of privatised railroads once I've been shown how one train passes another on the same track.""

If you let capitalism unregulated, it quickly outgrows the domain where it actually works. Corporatism is a degenerate state where a few huge players can manipulate market conditions. This is closer to mercantilism  - the very thing early capitalists were in opposition of."
In Denmark the government is the more often the cause to monopoly. They are trying to break a lot of the monopolies but since most politicians is for monopoly as long as they are in charge of them its a battle uphill. With a private monopoly you can at least choose to not pay them and they can't force you.
Capitalism leads to monopoly in some situations but not all.

CO2 emissions are still rising. This means that the CO2 concentration in the air is actually accelerating. Which means it's warming effect is also accelerating, but exponentially fast.

Yes, both are up to date. The funny thing is that I know the BT works since I can enter the car without keycard, but it would just sit there without connecting and sometimes it works after a minute or two, sometimes right away, and once I had to manually repair the phone.

"I don't know why more people don't realize this. Holding stock is a belief in the economy and of the future of a particular company. By having stock in a company, you are proving it's worth by not selling. The same goes for the market as a whole. People cash the fuck out when they are nervous or there is a scary downward trend. People that believe in something hold on to it, both at the micro and macro scale."
This might be true if Tesla actually said they were going to raise capital. Last I checked they planned to never need to raise capital again.
"Ok, let's talk microeconomics. 

Markets are made of buyers and sellers. But in the stock market, every buyer can then become a seller.  

In fact, a new market participant doesn't have to start off as a buyer.  They can be a (short-)seller. A buy-and-hold strategy takes some shares out of the current supply, but doesn't make the supply go down in the future, since short-selling comes along and makes up ""new"" shares for sale.

Not convinced? Here's a different perspective:

At the limit, with a single shareholder (this is the dream IPO scenario), if that shareholder ""held"" against demand, in the pursuit of a higher market cap, they would simply be ""walking down"" the demand curve once they started selling: and guaranteed not everyone will pay the highest price.  Your own buy price (or the next investment bank to lead the pricing of a round of share offering) is simply going to be at the price for which you accept some arbitrary risk of not making a profit. This pricing decision happens for everyone. Independently (mostly).  

The key is this: the number of shares being issued will not matter once a single share has been sold. Guaranteed, in a marketplace that follows profit seeking assumptions, the person who bought the first highest-priced share, finding no one else to buy at a higher price, will lend it to someone to sell at a lower price and collect a rent on the lent share. And the second person (shortseller) will try to wait for a buyer at this new lower price. All of a sudden, the shareholder who has held for this dream IPO now is facing the reality of a falling market cap.

So - by any sane valuation model, share supply is NOT going to change that probability distribution of the expected value.

The link between short-selling and valuation models?  Shortselling is the degree of freedom necessary in a model that accurately describes observed market behavior.  There have been numerous studies on this - lots of money for getting it right, you see.

"
"A higher market cap does nothing for a company so far in debt.  The only way Tesla raises more capital is releasing more shares, which they have not done.  Buying shares now is just buying them from a third party, Tesla gets none of that money.  They already got paid. 

Buy 3 of their cars if you're trying to help them out.  Or pay one of their SEC fines by ""buying"" a block of private shares.  Or just mail them cash anonymously, it amounts to the same thing."

"That's the problem with nuclear currently. All the facilities were designed to have multiple reactors onsite, but they only ever build one or two reactors making the site's overall cost-effectiveness way less.

We could easily transfer off coal to nuclear if we built out these existing nuclear sites; the issue seems to be regulating the supply/demand of energy for our grid.

"Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all government is trustworthy and they're entirely focused on our best interests. It's just not true. They're mostly corrupt, they're all power-hungry by pretty much definition, and mostly out of touch and underinformed. It's entirely possible that the government doesn't actually do anything to stop the formation of a monopoly or even helps it along.

What I'm saying is that the formation of a monopoly in a market is inevitable unless the market is regulated sufficiently."
"The same forces that create monopolies in pure capitalism will attempt to capture government and regulators in pursuit of that monopoly.  So you're right, the mere fact of government with the stated intent of regulating capitalism to safeguard the broader interests of society is not enough. There needs to be adequate checks and balances and participation by citizens. 

Humans trying to carve out an unchallengable niche for themselves that guarantees their power and wealth, whether in a market as a monopoly, or in governance as an authoritarian, is an ongoing tendency that requires active opposition and constant vigilance. "
"The natural consequence of capitalism with no checks is monopoly, either officially or through price-setting and collusion, which is functionally a monopoly. Economies of scale and the ability of larger companies to buy/pressure any and all potential competition out of the market means that new competition cannot develop without laws to protect them."
"No, they aren't.

Housing and Internet only get created when the government pays companies to make them, because the natural optimum value is to have less housing than people need to drive up the prices. Governments and councils have to pay companies to build new housing to meet the needs of populations, as well as regulate the rental of housing to a high level to stop landlords taking advantage of their tenants who cannot easily just move house.

Internet services completely fail to provide high quality internet to anywhere outside of the major population areas, and completely fail to provide any internet at all to remote regions, without the government paying them billions to upgrade their networks and to force them to provide a minimum % of cover for the country. Capitalism can provide good internet to the most densely populated areas only, because everywhere else requires government intervention to actually get internet at all, which means competition cannot develop there.

Also, the way the internet works is that you have to send your traffic through your competitor's networks to reach other people and other services in order to provide full network access. Without government regulation, ISPs would have the right to stop new providers from doing that. There is no way at all for ISP competition to develop without government regulation.

&#x200B;

And yes, the car industry was stopped from further degradation in competition by government regulations around the world like the Sherman Act. Until more recently, it was very hard to import vehicles, so there was less opportunity for car manufacturers to dominate globally. But plenty of manufacturers dominated a single country very quickly. That's why so many of the big car brands these days are the only major car brand that comes from their country. "

"To be fair if the people in Power tried to make progress to Renewable energy and make fossil fuels illegal it would help more. Being born into this world I had no choice in my first car. It was a Gas car. IIRC they would take models of electric cars that were being shipped to be solid at a car dealership and destroy them instead of selling them so they couldn't have a competition. They would patent billions of things that are so generic that if you built that car, it would be sued into the grave. That was because corrupt politicians taking money from corporations fought to stop progress. They are in it for the money. I never liter, but companies make product with planned obsolescence, so the amount of trash people produce is compounded by corporations. Coca cola used to use Glass bottles, and would have cleaning stations that they could then reuse the bottle. Instead to save money they made plastic bottles. Not my choice. If you look at things you can see a billion things in your life are not your choice. They are made by corporations and lobbying groups. 

I agree that extreme things need to be taken into account. But China is a different case because they are trying to ""catch up"" in their industrial sector. Also American Corporations trying to be cheap and undercut their competitors started using foreign workers, who cost pennies compared to American workers who want all kinds of benefits and $15 an hour. Also American's love that the factories are no longer here to produce all that pollution.Also Companies love that they don't have to deal with regulations in America to stop the pollution. China, it is free game how you want to do. 

Oh, China also stopped the 1 child act because families were killing their daughters because the man carried the name. I don't know the ratio now, but at one point China had a massive issue with the amount of women to men in the country and if they continued would have a massive loss in population. IIRC it was 10 men for every 1 woman? This also created a huge problem for their society because the women being so rare started to treat their men like garbage. There was video on LiveLeak of a man being slapped and harassed by his girlfriend/wife for not being able to buy her enough stuff, while he was holding like 20 bags of stuff on the 4th or 5th floor of a mall. The man then decided to put the stuff down and jump to his death. Now this is an extreme case, but I have heard of this abusive relationships from my Chinese friends. 

Yeah it sucks, and I hate it too. But we all have to get in our cars and go to work, the store, school, or wherever. To fix this would mean that we would have to regulate every country on the planet to the same standard, even 3rd world countries. Then we would have to replace all the cars. And the Oil and Gas companies don't want that, and the car companies don't want that. They like being able to sell slightly different cars for huge profits.

The fact that corporations like BHP and RT can export our energy resources - to the very healthy benefit of our nation (at least, generally speaking) is owing to our free-market economy though, no?

It shows that Kodak once upon a time had competent engineers who understood what information to record from that raw sensor data.

"I love electric cars, but to me electric bikes just don't make sense. No clutch and no gears in a bike it's not simplicity, it's removing something that's essential to the pleasure of driving. People drive bikes because they're cheap (for the speed you get out of them), you can work on them easily and they provides the rawest driving experience. The Zero Bike is the opposite of that "
"You're comment doesn't make a lot of sense to me; you love electric cars, but then talk about how removal of the clutch and gears removes the ""essence"" of driving... Yet I believe EVs lack that type of gearing as well.

>People drive bikes because they're cheap (for the speed you get out of them), you can work on them easily and they provides the rawest driving experience. The Zero Bike is the opposite of that

Is it the opposite because of the cost, or the opposite because you don't need to work on them and the speed difference? The company making the Zero bikes claims they can generate more torque than a 1000cc. The driving experience would only change like it does switching from a standard sedan to an EV, so the biggest opposite I can see is cost. A Zero starts around $10,000 which is definitely expensive, but it is also a common threshold for normal sport bikes to pass.  Starting bikes from Kawasaki range from $5,000 to $50,000+. If you want to hear the engine roar, you'll miss that in any EV; but maybe that will be an okay tradeoff considering the amount of instant torque the vehicle generates.

Like you I'm guessing, I love to drive. I wish Tesla was able to put out a vehicle that was within my range a few years ago when I bought my BMW. But electric has impressive performance and now the mileage is getting decent.  While a bike can go long distances on a tank of gas, you may still end up saving some money using electric. I doubt much, even with an EV at the moment it isn't *outstanding* for the average user, but couple that with the idea of reduced environmental impact, ease of charging, and it seems like a very appealing option for getting around town. "
"I disagree. I've driven  2018 motorcycles and they all seem unfinished. There's nothing changed overall from a bike in the '90s, other than fuel injection. Gears are an impediment in enjoying the power or the torque of the bike. It is frickin annoying to have the peak torque at 12.000 rpms. At that engine speed I'm already over 65 mph in the city. You want torque at low rpms? FU, you don't have top speed. Want to use the clutch to compensate for the weakness of ICE? FU, now you need maintenance work."

"I don't understand why \[US\] politicians don't talk more about the security and economic benefits of better energy policy.  Even without mentioning climate change, electric cars are self-evidently attractive.

* Security: We \[US\] have been held hostage to the whims of Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, and Iraq for decades. If we are not dependent upon the global oil prices, the value to US security is uncountable.
* Economics (today): Should we have 50 million tiny power plants on wheels? Or a few massive electrical plants? Of course the latter has tremendously improved economies of scale... which is quantifiable right now by the cost/mile we pay in Teslas.
* Economics (tomorrow): If we actually lead the world in renewable energy technology, that would amount to having a lower cost of energy. Stated differently: our production efficiency for virtually all industries would have a nearly insurmountable cost advantage.

These are realities that even a conservative -- who doesn't believe 99% of scientists -- should get extremely excited about."
"I bought it because it's a cool car. A Prius isn't going to replace a BMW/Audi/Benz, but a Tesla will. 

edit: thought I mention I believe in global warming, but I also wanted a cool ass car."
"Completely agree with Elon here.  I don't think (and it seems that many others don't as well) that the whole ""you are saving the planet!"" is the main buying decision for someone buying a Tesla.  They are buying because it is a pretty damn awesome car, and it is a great side effect of doing that."
"This is also true of so many ""green"" things, that I don't get why the resistance. 

Even if you don't give an ef about the environment you should replace all your frequently used or hard to get to lightbulbs with LED bulbs because they'll save you money in the short term, and you won't have to get the ladder out to change the such and such bulb for a decade. They're just superior products. 

"
"""Believe in climate change""   


Come on America.... "
"Tesla is one of the best examples of the Golden circle of ""Why, How, What"" (there's a Ted talk about this) to get people on board with a mission and sell a product. Climate change and renewable energy is a big part of the ""why"" , and explains why they're in the battery and solar business.

But if your ""what"" smokes everyone else, you can sell just on its merits, even for those who don't get/agree with the ""why"" . They're building a juggernaut of brand loyalty at this point. "
"When I get into conversations with people who you know will try to say something negative, I always pivot to how much better it is as a car. Talking about performance, winning at drag races, how it‚Äôs smoother or has the ability to precondition will usually shut down their environmental arguments about being powered by coal. "
"Environment wasn't in the top 3 factors for me and I believe in climate change. I bought Tesla because of the electric drive train, awesome technology like AutoPilot, car always getting better through updates, and an awesome design and vision of the company. I could never imagine buying a car for over $30k, maybe even 40k if I and to stretch it, but I did because of Tesla features and my thesis that this car will last me a really long time.

Do I like that it's also good for the environment? Yes, but not the biggest reason to switch to Tesla. "
"If you really want to fight climate change, ride a bike or use public transport. I love Tesla but this marketing around global warning is very annoying. "
Don't buy a car to save the planet. 
"Locally clean air will have a bigger impact on most people.  Europe screwed up and incentivised diesel above gasoline to slightly reduce CO2 emissions and got filthy air and the medical issues that causes.  (I lived in Stuttgart for three years.)

"
I would rather fanboy over someone who's occasionally an asshole but effectively created the market for sustainable transportation than someone who's a complete gentleman before Congress but runs the social media platform responsible for toppling the most powerful democracy on the planet.
"Shame they're so expensive, kinda puts them out of reach for most people - which you'd think would be the point of saving the climate. "
I wish I could afford a Tesla :(
I fucking love you Musk! Truely a legend 
This is how you change the world 
"My whole family has all switched to teslas because of the technology and how freaking cool the cars are, the gas savings and environmental aspects are just a plus to us."
"‚ÄúThis car is a technological marvel, but clearly its thermometer is lying to me!‚Äù"
In other words Elon wants morons to buy his products too. 
"If we're being honest, given that 82% of climate change pollution comes from everything that **isn't** a car, Tesla could convert the entire world's vehicle fleet to electric and we're still fucked."
Exactly. Don't need the moralizing. This is an awesome way to do business. 
"Many people I see buying them will just come right out and say they really don‚Äôt care about the environmental aspect or gas savings etc, they just want a fast, sleek, amazing car that is safe for their family. 

I don‚Äôt really think people need a reason, I never felt I had to sort of explain myself about any of my other cars so why this one? 
Just the way I see it."
"Global warming is fake news but I love my Tesla!

(Kidding.....but not about loving my Tesla)"
"Bought my used EV because I was sick and tired of the gd thousands in repairs and the unreliability. 

Just a bonus I've been hippie preaching about them for years."
Long TSLA $___________$
"I'm probably in the middle camp. I don't see climate change as a ""believe"" thing - it's pretty well understood that the chemical composition of our atmosphere can significant affect climate and has in the past. Most of the really drastic changes in our planet's history have been associated with changes in atmospheric composition.

Whether we're at the beginning of another shift and, if so, whether or not human activity it causing it are sightly different questions. I could see there being some debate on this, but it doesn't seem like there really is - it's pretty much science versus unsubstantiated doubt and conspiracy theories (at least, in my circles.) So, absent a reason not to accept the scientific consensus, I do.



Aside from *all* of that, vehicle emissions are dangerous to humans, and aside from *maybe* giving trees along the road something to absorb, they can't be doing anything good. So yeah, I feel good about being zero emissions (or, more accurately, decoupled from energy generation - while my car doesn't produce any emissions, the power plants that produce my energy might. But ultimately, those plants can and will change, and the car won't have to.)

But if those were my reasons for getting an EV, I'd probably have had a Leaf or something a while back. I wanted a *Tesla*"
"This is something I said about 4 years ago on this sub and I kinda got blasted for it. I want a Tesla because I think they‚Äôre awesome, I don‚Äôt really care about getting it for climate change (not that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs real, just that getting a new car is never beneficial to the environment)."
"Attractive to whom, i cant afford a tesla."
"It is not a good idea to keep burning things like a caveman if there is an alternative that is not only better for the environment but also for anyone conscious of efficiency. Even if you do not believe man is causing a catastrophe it is possible we could in the future if everyone stays on ""the burn"". Might as well just quit now. Electric cars sucked because of capacity and most of them did not handle well; now it is the opposite and they are much more simple mechanically as well. There really is no advantage to ICE vehicles if the price is reasonable. There will need to be infrastructure changes though, of course, long term."
"I don‚Äôt know why, but reading this tweet made me think of [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9zmldu/short_sellers_are_struggling_their_massive_bet/eaauarc/) directed towards me a week or so ago.  It has since been edited, but in the original comment /u/toomuchtodotoday told me that climate change was the single biggest problem in the world today, that not enough was being done about it, and that if I was shorting Tesla he would let me burn to death in a bar.  I know this is the internet & I do have pretty thick skin, but it is indicative of a larger lack of love that seems to be growing around here.

If Elon can be this fair to people that disagree with what he‚Äôs devoted his life to, perhaps we could work a little more to make this sub as inviting as possible!

Personally I think the lack of love in society is a bigger problem than climate change - I mean if we get to the future and everyone hates each other what‚Äôs the point of getting there?  After watching Joe Rogans podcast it seems this is something Elon agrees with.  Let‚Äôs be friendly!"
My dad works for an oil company and he‚Äôs seriously considering buying a Model X
does it really take 45 minutes to get 100 miles of range from a supercharger like the guy in the video said?
"Want to fix climate change?  Have the environmentally friendly options be better and it will fix itself.

I‚Äôm looking forward to buying myself a Tesla and can honestly say helping the environment might be the last thing on the list as to why.  Don‚Äôt be mad at me though please, it‚Äôs still on the list.  The smog in LA is a bit much sometimes."
"The environment didn‚Äôt cross my mind once in the four years I waited to buy and now own.

Edit: global warming bad. Go environment! "
Will just leave this here https://youtu.be/X3YZt74w8Vw
Now **that** would be the one crucial turning point.
"This is why I think this approach is the best to solving climate change. 

If you make a clean technology obviously superior to the polluting technology without hindering the polluting technology then you side step the whole political swamp. 

Also it is an everyone wins approach. "
I just wish Tesla solar was more competitively priced. Even after the reported drops their quote was jaw dropping. 
"It'd be cool to see some sort of buoyancy systems which keeps them above the water line. Way way way easier then deploying a fleet of catcher boats, just need a fleet of scooper boats! "
I guess that‚Äôs good since the majority of electrical power comes from fossil fuels and will continue to for the foreseeable future. 
What kind of bullshit quote is this?
I don‚Äôt love that. If humans are that stupid we don‚Äôt deserve to survive as a species.
I can‚Äôt even afford a Tesla even if I wanted one lol
Live you Elon! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôd buy a Tesla even if it was gas powered... they‚Äôre damn cool cars.
Thats So fucking True. 
"Since you still need to produce the batteries, ship the car and charge it ( the energy used to charge it may not be from clean energy sources) do you think it has a really huge impact instead of just pollute somewhere else? "
Wait times to repair a Tesla are atrocious though. 
THANK YOU
"That's what all the fuzz is about. We need to stop forcing people to do stuff they don't want. Instead we need to trick them in doing so by making something they actually want.

Noone wants to stop driving their car just to fight something basically invisable to the otto normal person (not sure if that is something in english but in german for sure).
"
Hold it... this also benefits the environment?   I'm in for the 0 to 60 factor!
"I think the problem is Elon was relying on govt subsidies to make the model 3 more affordable. The AWD model 3 is like 65k (70k if you want autopilot) in Canada, we have a big goof of a premier who cancelled the ev rebate and now it's a lot less affordable.

60-70k isn't really a mass market affordable car."
"Heck, I \*do\* believe in global warming, but spending a ton of money for an inferior product would nevertheless be difficult. But spending a ton of money for a far superior product? Take all my money!"
Elon is the best kind of capitalist. He gets it. Why does it seem like he's the only one that gets it these days?
"I'd still be driving my Tesla if it ran on 100% rainforest and ozone layer.  I love cars, less pollution is a happy accident as far as I'm concerned.  That's how good these cars are."
"I'm not super knowledgable about climate change but acknowledge it. Honestly, that played a very small part of my decision to buy my Tesla but it's a small positive step. Every little part helps and with all the Teslas on the road replacing ICE vehicles, it's a good thing. "
"I don't buy into the end of the world climate change theory like most people that are ""into"" EV cars.  Now does it make sense to eventually go away from fossil fuels and use things like wind and the sun (that's, you know, kind of a constant in the sky), of course it does.  Why not use these sources of fuel that we don't have to spend millions harvesting and drilling for.  

&#x200B;

I don't think that CO2 emissions are going to kill anyone and cause a doomsday but I am in logical thinking of, lets harness these constant never depleting resources that I can throw some turbines in my back yard and collect.  It just makes sense.  

&#x200B;

I bought a Tesla because they are awesome, gas and diesel are way more expensive then me using free supercharging and cheaper charging at home.  

&#x200B;

This car feels like I am driving in the embodiment of the future.  LOVE IT!"
"If you don't believe that climate change is real, you're a fucking idiot who is afraid of the truth and the consequences of what might happen if you're wrong, so you denie it. You're NOT smarter than 97% of the scientists in the world. You dont have the option to believe it's not real.

Sorry, had to vent. We live in dark times and it gets to me. "
"Honestly, ""because its the best product"" is the only way to make healthy behavior change mainstream.

The average consumer does not make ethics based purchasing decisions.  Nor should they be expected to.  Thats what the Al Gores of the world just don't get.  People don't want a lecture, they want something that solves their immediate personal needs."
"Elon understands that simply telling people how bad climate change is and expecting them to change their behavior is never actually going to work.  Some people will, but never enough to make a difference.  There has to be a strong incentive.  Financial, emotional or something else.  I‚Äôve never spent more than $3k on a car nor ever really cared about cars but am willing to spend over $50k for a Tesla because it is exciting, revolutionary, and unlike any other car out there.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not unique and this should absolutely terrify established auto makers.  Tesla is essentially incentivizing people to fight climate change whether they care or not, simply by making their products far better than the alternative ICE vehicles.  This is the only way real change will come. Green technology will have to be cheaper, faster, more efficient etc... than the fossil fuel alternatives they are replacing before they catch on."
"I didn‚Äôt buy ICE cars because I wanted to kill the planet either, but I needed a car and that‚Äôs what was available. Saving the planet isn‚Äôt the *reason* I bought one, but a welcome benefit for sure."
That's the sentiment that gets the ball rolling if any.
"I‚Äôm convinced global warming is a problem, but i didn‚Äôt buy a Tesla due to that.   I‚Äôm also not an Elon fanboy.  I bought it because it‚Äôs a freaking great car.  "
Exactly. I believe in climate change but I was holding out for a 'no comprimise' EV that was better than the ICE car it was replacing.
I thought that a tesla was bad for the environment by having to mine for the shit that makes the batteries and then the huge tanker ships bringing the material over? 
"I wish people would stop taking about climate change as a belief, as this legitimises denial of scientific consensus. I think Elon's doing a great job, but he undermines his own position on the matter when he gives deniers an excuse to keep polluting"
I‚Äôd love to see a Mini-Cooper-ish Tesla small hatchback car. Please Elon!!
"Elon understands science, and he understands economics. That's what makes him so great "
"Love it, that's a nice diplomatic way of saying that not all people are intelligent and believe in *science*, but at least some of those folks will buy EVs anyway because they're better vehicles outright. "
"My only vehicles are teslas.  I am not at all convinced that man has anything to do with global ""whatever its called this year"".  I am a highly educated person with multiple first authored, peer reviewed, articles published (not on climate) and I am very skeptical about so called climate science.   Nevertheless I love the tesla product.  Telsa is simply the very best car to be had for the money.  I am also directly responsible for 4 additional teslas being purchased by others."
Nobody needs to be convinced of climate change as long as I am making money. 
"The vast majority of s scientists  reject ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù hypothesis, AGW is not falsifiable in the face of it and physics has disproven a key assumption.

But you won‚Äôt hear this because global warming is a political movement that survives by bring propagated via scientifically illiterate people who will now down vote this post, try to get me banned from the sub and tell me ‚Äú%97 of scientists support it‚Äù‚Äî which is true in the sense that survey of ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù non-scientists did support it, but not real scientists.

In 20 years I have yet to meet a single person who can defend AGW from a scientific viewpoint. All it‚Äôs adherents are illiterate in science and instead resort to linking to propaganda from politicians as ‚Äúscience‚Äù.

It‚Äôs the most absurd thing ever‚Äî and shows just how bad our schools are.

The IR absorption of CO2 is less than that of water vapor, making AGW impossible.  There‚Äôs PROOF,  and anyone who claimed to support AGW but doesn‚Äôt recognize it doesn‚Äôt even know the basics. (But then AGW supporters are NOCs who just spew thought terminating cliches and cannot make arguments.)"
"Same. I bought the car for what it is, not for politics. "
We can't convince the entire population the earth is round. Kudos to Elon for leading sheep to water.
Can confirm. I am not a climate alarmists and Tesla is the top of my list for my next car. There isn‚Äôt a close 2nd.

""Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don't need to be"" 

Fuckin poet 

"
WRONG. Electric vehicles are only one small part of the climate problem. Coal power plants and agriculture are far more important. 
"But also think about Tesla's market: 2/3 available cars are basically $100k (not even fully loaded). Who can afford $100k cars?  - A lot of people who vote for the political party that thinks climate change is a hoax by the Chinese (to quote our president) and who think forest fires happened due to lack of raked-leaves.  Teslas are found most common in conservative, affluent areas. "
i dont care about global warming and want to burns as much gas as i can but if tesla is faster and more fun than an mx5 for the same price i will give it a try.
"Our credit was sub par so we couldn't get a model 3.

Decided to go the opposite end of the spectrum and get a wrangler. Helps that were moving to our land soon and going full off grid bit, I would have liked charging my vehicle with free solar.

I just like Tesla's.  Musk has done something really special with his cars."
"I'm not one of the global warming people, but I love Tesla vehicles.  I look forward to seeing the pickup Tesla."
"Fake news is going to fake news. What did he expect, honest reporting?"
meanwhile people who hold their carbon footprint paramount aren't very convinced that a new mostly fossil fuel powered EV is the best choice

"Unless the Tesla is being charged with electricity that is generated through renewable energy, it is actually causing more emissions than a regular gasoline operated vehicle."
"Exactly.  It may not be a buying decision at all for someone buying a Tesla, but it is a great benefit."
"> they don't believe in global warming

If someone tells me that, I'll say ""it's ok, there's people who believe earth is flat, that vaccines are evil and that we never went to the moon. There's crazy people for everything."""
"This is the key. Tesla made a car that's cool in its own right; it's not only attractive to those who care enough about the climate to drop $70k+ on an electric car, then put up with the inconveniences. I'm not one of those people, but Tesla's cars are so great by themselves that I just had to have one."
"I bought mine not because of global warming but simply because it's a safe, reliable, awesome car."
"Good point. Other EVs and hybrids... for the most part, I see people buying them specifically for sake of being ""greener"" and for the fuel efficiency and/or savings (if any, depending on local gas prices).

Tesla? People just want a Tesla for sake of getting a Tesla. They could care less about the fun acceleration, aerodynamics, handling, interior tech, etc. They just think the car/brand is cool.

It's one more step in going mainstream. (Since other luxury brands also benefit from brand prestige, in the sense that many their customers don't really appreciate the thought put into the cars, but just think the cars/brands themselves are cool to own.)"
"Too bad we need to jump through all these hoops to make a dent in the emissions. All the resources accumulated by this endeavour could be used optimally in other ways, but public opinion won't budge until you offer fast, shiny cars.

We're fighting for our life here and buying a less harmful car doesn't achieve the mission."
"""Don't believe in global warming"" is such a stupid thought to have. To me it's like saying, ""I don't believe in gravity"" or ""I don't believe in plate tectonics."" I legit couldn't be friends with someone that ignorant."
"> Tesla is still achieveing their mission ~~while~~ by making an attractive product.

"
Imagine not beveling in global warming. Do people not understand how many people occupy this earth. All those cars and transportation of packages play a toll 
"Tesla's are the best cars on the planet period. That's a reason to buy them in itself, regardless of what you think about global warming. "
"*understand

You cannot ""believe"" in facts. You can understand them."
"This was always the key goal for electric cars: to make people who aren't in the ""save the earth!"" crowd want one, i.e make it attractive to the masses."
"Customer...Yup. I'm too dumb to accept science. I don't care about humanity. But damn I like a fast car. 

Elon...yep, we'll take your money too."
"I fully accept the realities of climate change, but it doesn't influence my buying decisions.  I bought a P3D because it's fucking awesome."
">y car say they don't believe in global warming but would buy a Tesla anyway. Tesla is still achieveing their mission while making an attractive product.

I've always said the reason green initiatives will work even against clime change deniers is because the product is better. Solar is better than expensive electric grids. Electric cars are better than gas cars. Who needs to convince them when you can just make them buy it cause its superior?"
"I agree. All the people I know that are Tesla fans like the car and the technology. The environmental talk actually made them look elsewhere until they rode in a Tesla. They thought only the ‚Äúenvironmental Prius lovers‚Äù drove Tesla‚Äôs.  I believe in climate change, but outside of our group most people do not care. They may believe in it, but not to the point where it would come into play when it comes to purchasing a $50k vehicle. We win this buy including everyone in the EV car revolution. Even those that don‚Äôt share our believes. Being an asshole to a potential Tesla or EV owner because they could care less about climate change will make them buy a gas guzzling SUV just out of spite. EVs are for everyone, not just people who love the environment. Treating the situation like this will actually get people who could care less about the environment to adopt behaviors that will actually save it in the long run. "
[deleted]
Lol I said that on this sub a few months ago and got shit for it
"I forget who it was who said, ‚ÄúI would still drive a Tesla if it ran on puppies.‚Äù"
"Heck, I do want to try to lower my carbon emissions but I never even considered buying a Leaf because I still want to have enough range to go skiing and camping. If not for the Model 3 I'd still be driving a hybrid.

With a Tesla you can have a fun car and feel good about helping out the environment while sacrificing nothing other than $$$ (for a driving experience that's absolutely worth it regardless of any environmental benefits)."
Which makes sense because owning and operating a luxury automobile does next to nothing for helping the environment.
"That's why I bought mine. I have a long commute and I hate going to the gas station every two days. I much prefer being able to plug in at home. Being environmentally friendly was low on my list of reasons for buying a Tesla, but I'm happy to have it as a nice side benefit. "
"Problem is the economics of Texas, West Virginia, North Dakota, and the like are built upon non-renewable, non-clean energy (oil, coal, and natural gas).

Now, if there were some sort of nationwide project to take funding from our foreign energy interests and put that into domestic energy interest (including solar panels, wind power, natural gas extracting, and oil drilling)? You‚Äôd benefit the economy and got a long way toward greenifying the energy grid without hurting the economics and of those states.

Ten years ago, such a thing might‚Äôve even been possible. But today? I don‚Äôt think so. Party purity tests ensure that no Democrat will be elected who supports oil and natural gas programs, and no Republican will be elected who supports green energy subsidies. And even if people were willing to look past that, they won‚Äôt look past this need to punish those who voted the way they didn‚Äôt."
">Security: We \[US\] have been held hostage to the whims of Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran, and Iraq for decades. If we are not dependent upon the global oil prices, the value to US security is uncountable.

We export oil now. We're entirely self sufficient on that front.

"This is my opinion also.  I am not an environmentalist.  I work in aerospace and most of the satellite engineers I work with have serious doubts about man made global warming based on their knowledge of solar cycles.  I myself have serious doubts about man made global warming.

None of that matters. 

Even if you dismiss the environmental argument for electric vehicles I still build weapons of war and energy independence is a huge part of sovereign security.  Wouldn't it be great to live in a country where we don't have to give a fuck about an unstable energy supply?  Let the middle east consume itself and simply ignore it.  No need to get involved or spend billions of dollars analyzing it."
"Hell you could argue that for many Americans, electric vehicles would be more accurately called ""coal vehicles"". That would get them selling in West Virginia!"
Because money. Politicians like lobbyists who line their pockets with cash.
"I'm sure the DoD has written many white papers on the security implications of climate change, but nobody in the Congress or white house fucking bothers to read."
Special interest money is a real son of a bitch 
It's because basically every time a politician is speaking there's a lobbyist standing just out of view of the public slowly pulling dollar bills off of the stack of campaign contributions if said politician even thinks about embracing alternative energies. 
"If they weren't dependent on foreign oil, there would be no need for a huge army to secure said oil supply. That would make many rich people in the arms industry very unhappy and can't happen."
"We are not dependent on foreign oil anymore, we are dependent on them trading with USD. If that changes, we are in serious trouble and that is why we are still do interested in these countries"
"[Green New Deal Town Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0IgDgyHEfc) I recommend everyone watch this. It is informative, they have smart panel and several ideas ready to go. "
"I'll go with that. I want one for the technology first and foremost, but I'm also a greenie so the environmental friendliness is a massive plus.

I can't afford one by a mile though:("
"Well tbh if you want to ""save the planet"" owning a car and private transportation arent the best choices to begin with. "

"Yup. I'm a conservative, have serious doubts about global warming and love Tesla. Best product on the road by far, and American made!"
"> They're just superior products.

Exactly."
"Elon's climate change message doesn't really revolve around believing in climate change. From memory, his climate change ""platform"" looks something like this:

* There is a probability that fossil fuels use will have a bad outcome

* Humans will have to transition to sustainable/green energy at some point

He doesn't typically provides numbers/data/proof, its all just logic that even skeptics can get behind. "
"There are idiots in every country.

But propagating lies in schools and in the media is a very American phenomenon (amongst democratic countries)."
"I know a lot of people don't believe that CO2 is the primary cause of climate change (vs natural earth/sun changes and cycles, and this includes some of my local meteorologists), but yet still believe in climate change.  I am not 100% convinced myself, but either way I support anything that reduces pollution and benefits the environment (which most climate change proposals do other than maybe carbon taxes).  Not to mention, reducing our use of nonrenewable resources is generally a good idea and benefits the environment as well."

"I would agree with you, and I‚Äôm glad Tesla is able to meet the objective of all three rings, and in the right order of priority.

(For those interested in the ‚ÄúWhy, How, What‚Äù, check out Simon Sinek‚Äôs TED talk, or his book, Start With Why...it‚Äôs fantastic!)"
"You can also tell them that coal power plants are way way cleaner than gasoline engines, and that the idea is to get rid of coal power plants next."
Same here
This is me as well.  Love that it is helping but it wasn't on the list when we were considering what to purchase.  
"Climate change believer, too, but just the looks of this car sold it for me. Everything else is icing on the cake."
In my experience the moron portion is a pretty big percentage of the overall market.  
Hence the moron proof features.
But one fifth of the fuck would be gone
If we all love each other but ruin the planet what‚Äôs the point?   The love will vanish when we‚Äôre all fighting over food shortages. 
"I don‚Äôt mind the call out. I stand by my statement as to the severity of climate change, and that it would be reasonable to trade some of humanity to save the rest of it.

The time for love is when we aren‚Äôt facing extinction, and I don‚Äôt care what Elon‚Äôs stance is. I can love my Tesla products but not agree with him (or you). 

Compassion and empathy are important, but the boot is for self-defense, and there are a whole bunch of folks who don‚Äôt care one bit if we burn the Earth up. Love thy neighbor, but be prepared to use force if they try to burn the neighborhood down."
"I'm sorry that guy was an asshole to you. You don't deserve that, but unfortunately he was right that climate change is the single biggest threat to humanity."
"Seriously - the car is winning. Shorts have their own burden to bear (pun intended).

So really, no need to go after them. Long term, shorts cannot bypass or counter the overwhelming power of hundreds of millions of people making the daily economic decisions that make the most sense for them personally. Even, as some shorts do, by lying to them. You can only lie to people for so long, before they notice what you're doing and start ignoring you. Like spam phone calls, after a while we just stop answering the phone."
Tell him to get it. He won't regret it.
"There are so many factors to this. It‚Äôs not simple. 

If your battery is warm, and your state of charge is low, you get a 120kW charge rate until almost 50% and can charge that in 20 minutes or so. 

If the battery is cold even a little bit the supercharger rates suck. 

Also the type of driving you do maters. If it‚Äôs highway driving with no cross wind, 70mph or less, no heater, you get much more mileage. If it‚Äôs freaking cold, with a cross wind or wet concrete you get way less. 

So yea 40 minutes might make sense. "
This. You need to offer a compelling alternative.
As opposed to the magical fairies that refine and deliver the thousands of gallons an ICE car will need directly to the pumps?
"A pickup would be better. F-150 is best selling vehicle out there.  That's what people want even though 90% of the time they are just one person driving it empty without a load of anything and a small compact car would make more sense, people still want the big truck for once a year when they buy something large or tow something. "
Nobody who believes in science supports global warming. Only the scientifically illiterate do.  Scientists don‚Äôt.
"Even *if*  97% of scientists agree, it doesn‚Äôt really matter. Science isn‚Äôt a democracy and the burden of proof lies on those making the claim. Consensus was that the Earth was flat and that Einstein was wrong about relativity. Consensus is irrelevant. "
"While CO2 definitely has less absorbative properties than water vapor, it has a much much longer retention in the atmosphere and doesn't dissipate as quickly. It takes at least 20 years give or take for a CO2 molecule to be absorbed by the ocean while water vapor takes 9 days. These are both natural processes that have been maintenaned for some time. When we over produce an amount of CO2 far greater than what is regulated through the climate cycles than it builds up and creates a queue of CO2 that cannot go an acidify the water because it is too busy being caught up the atmosphere. Power in numbers means that an influx of carbon can absolutely produce similar results for the dependant temperature variables. We have an entire other planet that makes an example of this phenomenon. It's called runaway climate change, and as more CO2 builds up more is produced because of it's effects, at home base we reproduce this effect by running more energy intensive technology to create microclimates to regulate our temperatures, but in doing so accelerate the emissions and irregular climate activity."
"Arrant nonsense.  


IR absorption of CO2? Read [http://clivebest.com/blog/?p=1169](http://clivebest.com/blog/?p=1169)  
Water vapor has an inherent negative feedback loop -- aka rain and other precipitation -- that keeps it from accumulating in the atmosphere. CO2 does not. Plants take it in, but not proportionately to the amount in the atmosphere. ""artificially doubling CO2 from pre-industrial levels increased trees‚Äô productivity by around 23 percent"" [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ask-the-experts-does-rising-co2-benefit-plants1/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ask-the-experts-does-rising-co2-benefit-plants1/)

"VERY WRONG.

[Human emissions by sources (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

Transportation is 28% of human emissions, agriculture only 9%. Coal is a much bigger problem, for which EV's are also the answer. Solar + Vehicle To Grid technology to [kill the duck]( https://alcse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Duck-curve-chart-2.jpg) will undercut and outperform coal and any other fossil fuel.

That is unless the Arctic collapses before we can stop it.

A Mazda isn't a great way to burn as much gas as you can.
Can you even go 650 miles on a single tank of gas?
"Do you really do 1000km without stopping? Seems like you're creating an obstacle based on the extreme value one particular vehicle can do, without having a real reason for needing EVs (or even ICEs) to do that.

&#x200B;"
"It does, they are not"
"I'm don't mind helping the planet, but I'm definitely here because of how they are as cars."
"Why is it so hard for people to understand that on-grid power is multiple times cleaner, even if it was 100% coal? Plus, the idea is to make the grid renewable at the same time!"
"Quite right, I would like if Musk would turn his attention to new forms of public transport. However, most people *will not* give up their cars, so a cleaner alternative is good. Your pointless and misleading comment on ""mostly fossil fueled"" is not helping though."
"Only for racing atm, full electric is still more efficient"
"Extremely false, larger engines, aka powerplants, running a steady rpm are more efficient period. Plus the battery is built to be full recycled, stop spouting bs"
"In the worst renewable states the average MPG is no lower than 50, accounts for transmission and charging losses that ICE MPG doesn't, fuel doesn't have to be mined, refined, and shipped right next door at the expense of more fuel, don't need to continue replacing oil in the internals, don't need to lose embedded energy replacing parts, and my entire drivetrain is recyclable. Since when was it so damn hard for a Tesla owner ro buy some solar panels or renewable energy credits??"
"I've always been convinced of and concerned about global warming but the cars that have been available and marketed toward my convictions ... ugh! The 3 is the first car I've ever owned that has battery power because it looks *cool*. It doesn't look like what your grandpa thinks ""those treehuggers"" would like. There's been this assumption all along that people who want an EV secretly hate cars and want car styling that loudly boasts to the world how so much above it all they are.

Tesla's ""revolutionary"" idea is to make an EV for people who *like* cars."
"Definitely situation dependent. If I'm trying to get someone to buy a Tesla I'm not going to call them out their beliefs, no matter how stupid it is."
Also... you don‚Äôt have to believe in global warming to believe in smog which you can literally see coming out of the tail pipes and accumulated in the air around large cities. Also it‚Äôs pretty well accepted that if you sit in a garage filled with it for about 30 min you die. 
"While you are not wrong, if the objective is to convince someone to purchase an electric car over an ICE car, calling them crazy (no matter how accurate it is) will not help you convince them to make the correct choice.  

Providing a better product, that also happens to be better for the environment, is an approach that works without needing to convince someone that climate change is in fact happening and is a huge threat to us."
Can we simultaneously believe that global warming or climate change isn't the imminent harbinger of doom it seems to be portrayed as but also that burning fossil fuels isn't a good thing and alternatives are better?
 You have to be pretty credulous to think climate models can accurately predict the effects of very small changes to climate inputs.

"> If someone tells me that,

Global warming is a joke from Al Gore to convince people that they need to pay the government money for exhaling.  It's the crazy that the progressive left can't seem to shake off.  Partisan politics trying to pass off as science.  The writers of South Park makes light of this little exchange between you and me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AW4nSq0hAc

Your ad hominem and straw man fallacy comparing what you don't like to flat earth is all you have in terms of argumentation.  Your arguments are ethical in nature, and trying to use emotions and virtues to debate is the kind of thing that makes a person in an insane asylum call people on the outside: ""Crazy"".  

To the crazy, sane looks crazy.  Invest in a mirror."
"> They could care less about the fun acceleration, aerodynamics, handling, interior tech, etc. They just think the car/brand is cool.

That's ridiculous. Outside of the aero, those *are* the things that make Teslas ""cool""."
"I think once they start becoming cheaper, people will just be buying a ""car"" and not an ""electric car. "
More like affordable cars. Your average American can‚Äôt afford to spend two years of income on a damn car. Be practical!
"It's not the same thing. You don't have to believe in gravity, you can test it yourself. You may want to deny it exists and jump from a building, but that's a crazy thing to do because everyone knows exactly what will happen, from the personal experience of every day of our lives.

Global warming and plate tectonics are things you have to ""believe"" because you can't experience them yourself. You believe in them, as I do, because other people told us to. You weren't here in 1880, and even today you're not in a position to *know* the average global temperature this year, *from personal experience*. You can't say you know firsthand the world is now 0.8¬∫ C hotter than it was back then. Some scientists, or maybe even just the media, told you that, and you believed it.

Now that's a sensible thing to do, for us. I had, and I presume you had too, access to at least some scientific education, and that tends to do that to you: you come to understand the scientific method, the process, and you end up trusting it along with the people who carry it out. This is a good thing, of course.

However, if you live in the country instead tending to your farm, or you're working class and your main concern in life is basically to make ends meet, then you don't have any rational reason to trust scientists. In fact you probably distrust and dislike them: you don't understand what they do, they seem to just get paid to waste time in mental wankery, *on your tax dime*.

Still, geologists who research plate tectonics face little pushback because their field has little overlap with the concerns of the working man. But the global warming thing is different. Here you have the green lobby asking the common man to spend their hard-earned money, and/or their country's (which is the same in the end), on things like carbon offsets, renewables, or what you have, when it would be cheaper to just keep burning petrol and coal. You know what that looks like? It looks like a con. It looks like poncy swindlers trying to sell expensive shit, justifying it with some tall tale about the weather.

This is unfortunate, but it's perfectly understandable, it's not stupid in the least. It's actually the smart reaction, if you consider that point of view. Stupid would be to just blindingly trust those scientists when you have no reason to, that would make you the gullible fool.

If you ask me, the right thing to do is to inform, to try to convince, politely and patiently. Do some research, figure out why *you* believe in global warming. Convince yourself with figures and data that you know who obtained and how, and then try to convince others. Or, hell, if that's too much work, then maybe just say nothing, but for the love of fuck don't go around calling people stupid. That's the most counterproductive thing you can do. No one ever has been convinced by insults, that just cements the working man's attitude against the whole thing.

And if you think that the uneducated working man is not important enough to convince, I'd just submit Donald Trump as first exhibit. The fact that *that* clown is president, and whatever damage he will do to international efforts on global warming, to me, are a direct consequence of this attitude. Because, to me at least, it seems clear that that shit is precisely what got him elected."

"If those industries die, and all those people lose their jobs, the world will rejoice.

">Problem is the economics ~~of Texas, West Virginia, North Dakota,~~  the business of the rich is built upon non-renewable, non-clean energy (oil, coal, and natural gas).

FTFY.

The absurdly wealthy run the country. Most of them have vested interest in the world not changing, and that means continuing to burn fossil fuels.

There honestly aren't *that* many jobs in fossil fuels compared to other industries. Seriously, if everybody who works in fossil fuels lost their jobs tomorrow (and fossil fuels were replaced with another fuel that costs exactly the same but doesn't require any labor), the world economy *might* have a slightly bad year and then it'll recover the following years."
"I should have been more clear: while we \[US\] are a net exporter of oil, the worldwide price of oil is effectively dependent on the actions of shady countries. And it is that price that drives so many aspects of our economy."
"Agreed.

BTW, that is very strange to me.  I've been in aerospace for several years and physics for several years before that, and not a single person I've worked with has doubted the science of global warming.  Every single engineer I've worked with and every single scientist I've worked with - even the conservative ones - have had no doubts about global warming.

Especially engineers who understand thermal.  I have to wonder - what do they calculate would happen to the global temperature when you add this much to CO2 to the atmosphere?
"
">I work in aerospace and most of the satellite engineers I work with have serious doubts about man made global warming based on their knowledge of solar cycles. I myself have serious doubts about man made global warming.

Bloomberg has a pretty neat [interactive set of graphs](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/) that show the relationship between earth's temperature over time and a bunch of other factors, including [the sun](https://i.imgur.com/5UYUo9C.png).

"Do you doubt that CO2 creates a greenhouse effect, or do you doubt that humans produce enough to matter?"
Being a conservative has nothing to do with believing in global warming. Conservatives may weigh it differently. Anti-science is no way to go through life.
"Please don‚Äôt act like being a conservative gives you a right to ignore factual evidence, I lean right on a lot of issues when it comes to fiscal beliefs but I don‚Äôt ignore facts. There is no question that factories and millions of cars give off gas that gets trapped in the ozone layer, gets heated up by the sun, then causes the earth to become warmer. 

What do you think causes you to not be able to see downtown city scapes that you could once see before? It‚Äôs a rise in pollution. 

Let me know how you feel about climate change when in 20 years you are struggling to breathe due to poor air quality, don‚Äôt have any greenery around you because it can‚Äôt survive the rise in temperatures during the summer, suffer from heat stroke and cardiac issues, not to mention the injuries and death caused by extreme storm surges such as hurricanes, tornadoes, lightning storms, etc... 

My best friend suffers from severe asthma and any day that the air quality is poor she ends up in the ER clinging to life and the only thing that saves her is being pumped full of meds that literally keep her breathing. 

Climate Change is 100% real, when the ice caps melt and bacteria that was once frozen for thousands of years is thawed out and breaks out to various populations and eventually around the world you might think to yourself ‚Äúhmm maybe we should have done something to fix the problem‚Äù

By all means one person buying an EV over an ICE car is not gonna be the main issue, but if everyone bought one over an ICE car and collectively made the switch we would have a significant decrease in CO2 use. "
Global warming is undeniable. You can't deny that CO2 concentration has increased.
"I do believe in climate change and don‚Äôt agree about that at all with you, but I‚Äôm glad you love tesla despite that fact. I‚Äôm happy that tesla is reaching markets so far from their target."
"Which goes back to my point that it's the engineers and scientists that will ""fix"" climate change, not politicians and ""activists""."
"Great points. I'm behind that logic. Everyone should be a skeptic to some degree, and I'm sure even Elon questions some of the science and policy proposals. "

"I just wanted to chime in here. I believe in global warming, but I don't think humans make that much of an effect on it. I think it would happen even if we didn't exist. It's just a natural cycle. If we speed it up, it's not by much"
">There are idiots in every country.

But there are very few countries where the idiots are in charge."
"I guess the way I see it is that the consequences of fossil fuel consumption (and all other human factors) being a primary cause of climate change are absolutely devastating to biodiversity and future generations. The consequences of taking that seriously and being wrong are that we end up with a cleaner energy economy, less pollution, and healthier future generations. Even if you're skeptical or it turns out that human-driven climate change was all bunk, the risk/reward calculus should point at least somewhat to pursuing cleaner energy options."
What part are you not '100% convinced' about?

You‚Äôre reciting a litany of nonsense very much like the technobabble they put in Star Trek episodes.  It‚Äôs absurd nonsense designed to sound like science yo people who have no science background.

‚ÄúRunaway climate change‚Äù is a fantasy sold to scare you.... but in the past CO2 levels were vastly higher than the human race could create if our entire economy was dedicate to nothing but producing CO2.... and no such runaway effect happened, quite the opposite happened in fact.

So not only is this pseudo science bullshit you‚Äôre pushing, it‚Äôs historically disproven, and long before there were humans."
"It‚Äôs really quite astounding. You claim to have post graduate degrees and yet your education on the basic science of this planet is less than a third grader. All of them know how plants work.  You linked to an article that was nonsense, as predicted, which doesn‚Äôt address my point (and height have you). 

You can‚Äôt just assert CO2 is magical and ignite magnitude, it‚Äôs lesser effect and the entirety of basic physics.

Let‚Äôs hope you were lying about those degrees... or were just going to have to admit our schools have become political indoctrination centers rather than places for education."

Best case scenario of only driving on the highway i can get about 930 miles and a more accurate estimation would be around 800 miles so yeah 650 no problem

"The designed them they easy because if the car manufacturers made them en masse like a Malibu, they'd go bankrupt.

Likewise for the rest of the luxury brands, with a few exceptions for certain models.

I've definitely met lots of people who don't know anything about EVs (or Tesla vehicles) in general, but *want* a Model 3 because it's the ""cool car of the future."" They don't follow Elon, Tesla news, EV news, etc., but just have a general desire to own a Tesla."
"As with virtually all technologies, you start with expensive models, and once r&d is paid for and the design is refined, you introduce lower priced models. This has been Tesla's plan since the beginning.   
They started at $100,000, and will very soon be at $35,000. They've mentioned the possibility of a $20-$25k range car. And, with time, used cars will be plentiful, the batteries have so far proven very durable."

"I have family and cousins in rural America. They live in some of the poorest areas of my state and are like how you said, worried more about how to make ends meet than the stuff of science. They had the same public education or at least similar enough and they all believe in science. I don't believe that these men and women in america are just victims of circumstance. Maybe some are but that's because there is a sickness in this country and it's people who are against education and take pride in their ignorance. These are the people.that you will.never change their mind no matter the facts or figures. They truly are fucking morons who had every opportunity not to be morons but chose to be morons instead. Whether their parents thought them education was bad or they decided on their own that education made them feel dumb so they decided to forget about it all. That's willful ignorance. They chose this path and I don't have to respect them for making that choice.

I am sick of the narrative about poor middle America and how hard they have it. We all have it fucking hard right now. Economy sucks. We are all in debt. We hold on to bad jobs because we know how hard it is to find a new one. Global warming deniers at this point have chosen to be ignorant and I don't have to respect that ignorance. They should be told that they are wrong, to their face, repeatedly. 

Being kind and respectful hasn't worked with these types of people for the last 40 years and it won't start working tomorrow. They are wrong and they should feel bad but most of them will probably be dead before they get to feel the effects of their ignorance but I hope future generations piss on their graves."

"While that is true, you can‚Äôt deny that oil is a major part of the Texan economy (similar thing in Tennessee - we get about 12% of our power from hydroelectric dams...but we also have quite a few coal mines out east)."
"Yup.

Case in point, there was a study conducted by the NSEE in 2013 about a particular plan to phase out coal power. When one sample was asked just if they favored the plan (with the plan listed), 42% if Democrats were in favor (compared to 38% against) and 36% of Republicans were in favor (compared to 52% against). And while that‚Äôs a bit of a partisan tilt, it‚Äôs not nearly as slanted as you might think.

However, when the survey question also noted that the plan was proposed by the Obama administration, support from the Democrats grew to 57% (opposition fell to just 25%), and support from the Republicans fell to 24% (opposition rose to 57%).

Even though the plans were both the same."
"Job training doesn't help when there are literally no other jobs around. Have you ever been to WV? You can drive an hour just to get to a gas station and grocery store.

"If people are forced to adapt due to government intervention, though, they will fight that every step of the way. And if it does go through, they will grow resentful of that government and the people that forced them out of their livelihood.

You can provide some sort of cushion (e.g., give a massive, multi-year‚Äôs-pay stipend to anyone who loses their job because of it)...but that costs money. Now, you‚Äôve got to deal with three angry groups: the oil/gas drillers who *arent* okay with a stipend, the taxpayers who don‚Äôt want to pay more taxes, and the environmentalists who are now upset you‚Äôre ‚Äúrewarding people for killing the environment‚Äù.

But it‚Äôs got to be one or the other. Either risk seething resentment, or try to balance the upset groups. You can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúadapt or die‚Äù."
For real. OPEC determines the oil prices and they can get oil cheaper than us. 
"Does your hardware require a deep understanding of solar radiation and how solar flares affect things?  The conversations I have with the people that do this science for our payloads make pretty convincing arguments that a very dynamic period of solar activity coincides with the global warming phenomenon and that solar cycles have far more to do with the Earth's surface temp.

These aren't some group of internet scientists, they are PhDs whose job is to predict solar activity and its impact.  I interact with them because they are presenting at a conference in a paper and need to get legal approval before publishing.  

I love that whenever you tell someone you are not convinced others jump the conclusion that you are somehow convinced the opposite.  I am not convinced either way, and my opinion is formed in part from first hand whiteboard lessons from some of the brightest minds in remote sensing telling me they aren't convinced.

When you say you work in aerospace do you mean air breathers or are you in contact with payload specialist whose full time job it is to understand solar radiation in the future?"
"Most people on either side of the argument don't do much to form and/or support their belief. Even many of those that believe it don't know much beyond the fact that the Earth has warmed as CO2 has gone up and the fact that most scientists believe it.

Edit: I believe in climate change and bought a Tesla, granted the climate and sustainability was an almost negligible part of my decision"
Most people don't believe in how much we have to do with it.
"I have doubts. Is that ok? There are really good discussions that happen on the subject and the idea of trying to shut down conversation instead of championing it is not a good look for your position. 

I have doubts about man made global warming. I am open to having my mind changed on the subject but the people who champion it are the very same people who stand to make money and power from it. It is a conflict of interest so i keep my mind open to the possibility that they are not being honest.

Also, I wouldnt mind the world getting a little warmer. I would rather that than another ice age!"

the CO2 /O2 cycle is well known and is the corner stone to life on earth. The earth has gone through many climate changes long before humans were around. I have doubts about the media's narrative of global warming that causes such divide and shuts down constructive dialogue. 
"im not anti-science. The exact opposite actually.

https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/

This is a good blog to read. The climate change he writes about is the kind i am inclined to believe in."
If you dont understand why someone has doubts about global warming why are you so condemning of the view point? I have put in a lot of time reading both sides of the subject and i have doubts. You are free to believe what you want just as much as i am too. There is a lot of really bad articles written about the subject and the science is not settled.
Global warming is a theory that some science supports. The global warming paraded by the media is not supported by science.
"I hate that climate change is called a ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù idea. It‚Äôs a scientific understanding. I think that the very fact that people call it a ‚Äúliberal or progressive‚Äù idea causes many people to dismiss it.

I know I‚Äôm very caution before buying into any ‚Äúconservative or liberal‚Äù ideas."
How does climate science have a political bias ? I don't understand how the issue has been framed this way.
"It‚Äôs not even the media, it‚Äôs very specific media outlets parroting the talking points of a political party using it as a tool to retain power."
"I agree with you for the most part and its kind of what I was trying to say.  I think you have to consider economic impact when enacting climate legislation (on both sides; obviously the economic impact of doing nothing could be very destructive as well).  I wasn't trying to turn this into a big climate change debate, but merely trying to point out that there are many factors involved, many of which we can't completely understand, so the issue should be tackled carefully. The prevailing attitude is that climate change is 100% man-caused and if you are skeptical at all, you are an idiot.  I think there is room for skepticism, but that doesn't necessarily mean we shouldn't plan for the worst."
"Not OP but there are about 4 cyclical phenomena happening at once and it's hard to pin down a singular cause.  Orbital changes, axis wobble, atmospheric changes and sun behavior can all play a part. Also biological and geological changes.  I do believe in man-made global warming and that it's the largest factor.  But there is more going on than just CO2"
"I am not convinced that CO2 creates a greenhouse effect that has a devastating impact when compared to natural causes.  It is pretty easy to prove that humans emit a lot of CO2, but it is a lot harder to prove that CO2 is the main cause of global temperatures changes since we don't fully understand the Earth's or the Sun's impact.  I completely support any measure to protect the environment and reduced pollution, however, since I love hiking and spending time outdoors.  If there is a significant chance that CO2 is a big contributor, we should at least develop plans to mitigate the risk, since it would be irresponsible to do otherwise.  My main point was to explain that there are more than two sides to the whole climate debate."
"greenhouse effect is created by ""house"", i.e. the walls and roofs which limit convention flows and keep warmed ""exhaled"" by plants air around plants.

""Greenhouse"" effect in relation to planet climate is originated in Venus research, and misunderstanding still common in the beginning of 1990s.  "
"This is literally all they fear, the other idiot in this thread u/kitsappdad , is having a great civil conversation about climate change (lol) and says that his greatest fear is that as we fight for climate change government will bring about communism .

"I understand that sentiment for sure. But I feel we have to talk to people in order to solve this problem.

TBH I don't totally rely on the argument I stated. The best argument is ""Toyotas are nice, but this car is American made, runs on American coal, natural gas, and renewables, costs pennies per gallon (equivalent), looks way cooler, and it's twice as fast.

"I agree with you that that's a huge problem, but I disagree that it's as big as climate change. I can escape a lack of love by moving somewhere new with my family and making new friends, turning off facebook, etc. But climate change can't be escaped."
"ICE stands for Internal Combustion Engine: your standard gasoline or diesel vehicle. As opposed to EVs, Electric Vehicles.  


A kinder response: all manufacturing has environmental impacts. Lithium mining is actually relatively low-impact; much of it is obtained from brines that are dried out in shallow pools. But all cars, regardless of motive power, require a significant amount of steel and other metals. Much of this is recycled, mostly from older vehicles, but there's still some mining for more metal. EVs add lithium, cobalt, and more copper than your average vehicle. But then EVs avoid the impact of drilling, refining, shipping, etc. of oil. Your typical car burns 4,000 gallons of gasoline getting to 100,000 miles, so roughly 25,000 pounds of fuel not counting refining and the rest. And none of that gets recycled back into oil. An EV may get a significant amount of energy from coal, but coal plants running at optimum speed are more efficient than stopping, starting, and accelerating standalone engines. So the general consensus is that EVs are cleaner than all but the most efficient ICEs, and as wind, solar, and other renewables grow as sources of energy for the grid, they'll be even cleaner. I personally have energy choice and buy green power for my Tesla."
"It‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs not even a hypothesis, and to entertain it you have to reject the scientific method.  As I‚Äôm discovering though they are not teaching the scientific method in schools anymore and kids these days can‚Äôt think."
You are deluded and not worth arguing with.
Not everyone has a hybrid that can do 45mpg. 19mpg is more realistic and thats 380miles on a 20gal tank. 
What car?
Me too. I buy 100% carbon offsets from my provider.
"Very, very few places are pure coal, and the amount of coal in the grid is dropping significantly. Even where it's relatively high, the continuing development of electric cars is a necessary component towards eliminating fossil fuels."
"> Teslas don't look like the owner is self-flagellating for the sake of the planet.

YES. That's what I always found distasteful about those cars. I dare say they even seemed to project a *distaste* for cars in general. It was a bold statement to spend a lot of money for an ugly car as a way of saying you think *all* cars are ugly."
"For a good part of a decade, hybrids only came in some ‚Äúeco‚Äù color like pastel green, blue, or gold.  It‚Äôs amazingly sad to think of how many sales they missed out on for leaving out the normal colors.

Normal colors were, of course, available, but were difficult to find, and/or carried an absurd premium.  I remember considering a 2nd-gen Prius; the dealer wanted $5k more for the black; $2k premium, and $3k from being forced to take the bundled extras.

For all the griping people have about Tesla pricing and options changing frequently, you can‚Äôt possibly tell me folks would prefer the past, where options and colors were limited by what was on hand, and that you had to pay -more- for it because $profit$."
"Other carmakers are recently understanding this too. The Hyundai Kona looks amazing.

(Yet another part of Tesla‚Äôs mission.)"
"Those studies were probably true but perhaps a bit flawed if they only asked ""EV fans"" about styling. So Elon just assumed the majority of people like cars with conventionally attractive styling so he built those cars with electric drivetrains. "
"Tesla changed the game. They put electric front and center, sure, but more importantly they targeted a group of people generally not interested in electric cars.

Now everyone's frothing at the mouth given how badass and convenient electric can be. Supercar level acceleration and it can drive itself? It makes anything else look old-school in comparison."
I believe some exec from BMW said that.
"But that's a self-selection problem -- the only people willing to buy those ugly shit-boxes are people who liked ugly shit-boxes.  I was never an ""EV buyer"" because they all looked ridiculous and drove like trash.  That's changing now, and surprise, I own an EV."
"You don't think Teslas try to optimize every millimeter of body frame for aerodynamics? Aerodynamic cars can look like Teslas or Priuses. Toyota made their choice... it's totally about social signalling, saying ""I'm in this weird car because I care about the environment.""

&#x200B;

edit: I figured it was implied but realized it isn't necessarily - Tesla's #1 goal was not to make the most aerodynamic car. If that was the case, they could've done better. They optimized it to a limit, while still making it stylish as hell and having the same drag coefficient as a Prius (2018 models). This still entirely debunks the idea that earlier energy efficient cars did it for the aerodynamics. No, not at all. They did it for the looks. Just do a search for ""most aerodynamic cars"". None of them resemble the Prius (though the Prius is up there for sure)."
"The laws of aerodynamics haven't changed. They could have made them look cooler back then, too."
"The S, X, and 3 all have lower coefficients of drag than your Prius."
"> about aerodynamics, not the aesthetics

I think about that every time I see the aero wheel covers on my 3 :)  I'm keeping them on for the winter because I need all the efficiency I can get to counter the cold weather range drop. Once it gets warmer the alloys are getting uncovered!"
Global warming probably.
Especially when one person driving a tesla is inconsequential. We need those people to vote not buy a car.

"Well, go [here](https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/ev-emissions-tool) to see your environmental impact as an EV owner in your zip code. 


And go [here](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.html#wheel) to see where your state's electricity comes from. My state gets 57% from nuclear, 20% natural gas, 9% biomass, 8% hydro, 1% coal. "
"The EV owners I know buy 100% renewable power. The premium is typically very small. There are still areas that don't have the necessary laws in place, but that's a matter of time and action. Overall the grid is greening so even if someone is using dirty power, the tailpipe gets cleaner and cleaner every day, while an ICE tailpipe stays 100% dirty today, tomorrow, and always."
Depends where your energy comes from.
"The Paradise wildfire was caused by faulty PG&E equipment though, right? I‚Äôm not a denier, and I own a Tesla, but I don‚Äôt think the wildfires were indicative of climate change since they weren‚Äôt natural disasters. I could be wrong though."
"That's a big IF and sounds almost as silly as ""There's no global warming because it's snowing!"""
"But if the end result is the same, does it really matter?  Musk has made the electric car cool.  I'm now being bombarded by Hulu with Audi commercials featuring two dorks talking about a cool performance EV.  The change is happening and I put a lot more credit in creating an electric car that has mass market appeal over dumb-looking virtue signal machines."
"Thing is, your risk aversion ignores opportunity costs.

For example,  how many more people will be priced out of the housing market because California requires new construction to be solar powered? How many middle class people are struggling to make ends meet in California because the price of gas is 85 cents a gallon higher?  How many Californians are unemployed because of carbon taxation driving jobs out of California.

Green policies are not cost free. You had better be damn sure you know what you're doing before you start pulling policy levers because you can very well end up doing a lot of damage."

You can be right and still be an asshole. It does a disservice to the whole cause.
"The problem with this kind of thing is that it doesn‚Äôt help convince anyone. It just lets you feel smug. Maybe the guy you‚Äôre talking to has his mind made up and there‚Äôs nothing you could do to change it, but what if someone nearby is on the fence? You don‚Äôt want them to think of people who believe in climate change as arrogant assholes. What if they really *could* be convinced if someone made a genuine, kind, thoughtful attempt to actually convince them rather than condescending to them and trying to make them feel crazy or stupid?

It isn‚Äôt too hard to do that in a natural conversation. I don‚Äôt know where you live, but around here, a lot of older people talk about how we don‚Äôt get much snow like we did when they were younger. It‚Äôs really easy to naturally turn that conversation to a place that helps them realize that climate change is happening and that it‚Äôs not a good thing. If you‚Äôre aggressive toward those people, not only do you not convince them, but you condition them to be defensive and less receptive to having a more positive conversation about it later."

"Full time, it affects our hardware and overall system design.

I would be very interested to see a paper that goes against the grain and finds that solar cycles *could* explain the warming trend."
"Their perspective is confusing to me too, because solar cycles etc can only explain an *observation* of global warming, but man-made climate change *wasn't* an observation; it was deduced long before it was observable, as a mathematical inevitability of the known size of the Earth against the known volumes of carbon we were shifting and its known spectra and thermal properties (+ other factors).

So unless we seriously misjudged the size of the Earth and still have a few undiscovered oceans the size of the Pacific Ocean sitting around waiting to be found, or unless cars all secretly run on ounces instead of gallons of gas and gas-stations around the world have all been cheating everyone and no-one noticed, then whatever solar cycles might or might not be doing, man-made climate change will *still* add its full payload on top of all that.

I have to assume these PhD's are simply in an area where there is political-ideological resistance to man-made climate change (likely the USA), and so as solar-cycle experts they look to those things near at hand to rationalize away the uncomfortable truth."
Just like the vax vs anti vax argument. Most people on either side don‚Äôt do much to support their belief.

"Lol every post here is FUD when it comes to ice cars and fossil fuels industry, but suddenly climate change is where fossil fuel companies, that have the most to gain from Status quo, are the highest arbiters of truth. "
I disagree. Anyone versed in the scientific method has a valid opinion.  But only if they‚Äôre not biased by money from the fossil fuel industry. Are you familiar with dr Richard Mullers work in the BEST study?
"There is no such thing as proof in science, but there is as much consensus on climate change as on most anything.

It's not too hard to demonstrate the causation. The greenhouse effect is a simple physical phenomenon that's very easy to 'prove': CO2 doesn't absorb high-energy incoming sunlight, but it does absorb the lower-frequency light that bounces back out. (The sunlight loses energy when interacting with the earth). Thus there is a net effect of trapping sunlight's energy. Therefore, it's a very bad idea to pump the atmosphere full of CO2. This is the causal link in the correlations you mentioned.

I think scientists are just summarizing this overwhelming level of confidence with the word 'proof'."
"Oh you have my full agreement that nobody in the media has any idea what they're talking about, especially regarding science.

But if you know about the CO2 / O2 cycle, then you must agree it's a bad idea to exacerbate it by filling the atmosphere with 2 or 3 times the usual peak CO2 in that cycle."
">The earth has gone through many climate changes long before humans were around.

"I think the reason climate change is so political stems from four places:

* By sheer coincidence, the areas that get blamed the most for climate change (e.g., Texas, North Dakota) and the areas that would be hurt the most by climate change legislation (e.g., West Virginia) are Republican. So, if a bunch of people start talking about how we need to clamp down on coal and start taxing emissions - and 90% of those people happen to be Democrats - the people living in those areas are going to believe its made up to hurt them.

* On that note, Republicans and conservatives in general tend to be opposed to regulation. Climate change, obviously, requires regulation to counteract.

* The biggest name in climate change in the US is Al Gore, who famously lost the 2000 election by the slimmest of margins. 5 years later, he puts out An Inconvenient Truth. To a lot of people, his work on this stuff (and the degree to which he blamed conservatives for things) looked like sour grapes (not without reason, either; Gore even opens the documentary by introducing himself as the ‚Äúformer next President‚Äù, and references his 2000 loss more than once).

* With the exception of one or two areas (e.g., economics), academia in the US is *overwhelmingly* liberal. Like, to a degree where‚Äôs it isn‚Äôt even representative of the liberal-leaning students they tend to teach, much less America as a whole. If a bunch of liberals get together and tell conservatives they need to change their way of life and abandon their ways...those conservatives are probably inclined to not believe them.

All in all, it makes sense to me that climate change has become so politicized, and it also makes sense to me that people or a certain political view aren‚Äôt inclined to believe in it.

I just wish it wasn‚Äôt this way."
"In most of the world it doesn't. In the US it didn't use to until some people made it so. There was a great historical take on it recently:

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html"
"> How does climate science have a political bias ? 

The science does not.  Conservatism in the USA is reflexively against whatever liberals are for.  Liberals started talking about global warming, so conservatives are ""skeptical"" of it, and decided the science was too politicized.   

Some have theorized that Al Gore's effort to spread knowledge about the problem actually made the issue worse, because a liberal talking about it galvanized conservatives against doing anything.   Gotta spite the libs.    Now even with conservatives who are pro-EVs, pro-wind power, etc, you still have to talk around global warming so as to not go against their ""beliefs.""    "
I honestly don‚Äôt know. In my opinion political parties need to be eradicated and we need to all vote as independents on specific people rather than party loyalty. 
"> it‚Äôs very specific media outlets parroting the talking points of a political party using it as a tool to retain power.

And the media in general pretending that all viewpoints are equally valid, thus obscuring the extent of scientific consensus on the issue.    Their idea of ""balance"" is to present flat-earthers and round-earthers as just representing different sides of a contentious, burning issue.   "
These can all be modelled with high precision.

"I totally respect that your heart is in the right place, but I want to nitpick the CO2 thing anyway just because I think it's important.

I'm confused by your comparison of CO2 v.s. natural causes creating a greenhouse effect. Are you referring to man-made v.s. natural CO2?
In the past there have been naturally occurring cycles of global warming, but they were also caused by CO2 (which increased when animal life outpaced plant life in the Earth's history). That's why it's a safe assumption that pumping many times that amount of CO2 into the air artificially is a bad idea."
Does it mean nothing that the earth started to rapidly heat up as soon as the industrial revolution started? Are you just forgetting about that?

Ben Sullins expresses it perfectly in [Dear Tesla Killers](https://youtu.be/5fW9ne9mFVk). It is baffling that companies who market their _design_ as fundamental to their brand (BMW) produce toasterbox weirdmobiles.
Car shopping now in WA state and unfortunately can't wait long enough for them to start shipping to anywhere outside CA. This vehicle checks all my boxes for the crossover/CUV segment and I'm really wishing I could get my hands on one soon!
valid point
No I don't.   The most aerodynamic shape is a tear drop with the fat side in the front then a long taper in the back (think about jumbo Jets and solar powered cars).

"The new Prius has the same coefficient of drag IIRC. The Mercedes CLA has a lower coefficient of drag than a Tesla as well. Hell the BMW 5 series has a lower cd too. It's not like Tesla has industry leading aerodynamics.

So I wonder about these calculations  - do they take into account that most EV charging is at night?  At least in my case it is. My theory is that despite the overall mix from my zip code (85016) most of my charging is nuclear bc that‚Äôs the base load here that never shuts down.

"I mean here's the thing, The logical sense of it would be the two combined, The natural cycle is getting warmer yes, But at the same time, The amount of Co2 we have dumped into the atmosphere is amplifying the effect.

IIRC I once found a graph with the last few million years of temps/ est. temps and they did cycle as a solar cycle would hint, But as the levels of Co2 in the Ice cores taken for to test the time period grew, So did the peak temperature of each solar cycle.

"I didnt save all the different articles and theories i have read over the years. I will say some of the anti-climate related media has proved influential to my world view. I find there is very few things i believe steadfast in anymore. I like to keep an open mind. The thing that probably keeps me most undecided on the topic though is this; in order to advance ""save the planet"" type programs means to support 100% liberal theology. It also means reducing the rights of the individual in some or many ways. The track record of science in general is very poor (that's by design). Who is to say 5, 10, 20 or even 50 years from now science will not have a radically different theory due to advances in knowledge? in short, the implications of climate science is dangerous in the hands of politicians. 

In general we need to tread very carefully and have robust discussions before sweeping legislation is passed."

This is the dangerous part of climate change i worry most about. Where the people freely give up rights to the government ""for the greater good"".

We dont know the future. Science doesn't either. What happens if we give away freedom to the government in the name of science...then lets say 10 years from now (or 100) we find out the science was wrong. what then?

The very foundation of science is to keep experimenting. Right now it seems very clear but history tells us this happens all the time. The science will change as we learn more. If we are not careful we could lose our freedom. That's my greatest fear.

Sure but their affects on biology and local climates can not be. For instance let's say a three degree drop in temperature results in a shift in albedo by a large margin. How and why are very speculative.

"About the only meaningful difference between a third generation Prius and an equivalent Civic is a 92 lb nickel-metal hydride battery. A Prius gets about half-again the MPG as the civic. Over the first 100,000 miles, a Prius will use about 2,000 gallons (or 12,000 lbs) of gasoline, a Civic roughly 3,000 gallons (or 18,000 lbs) of gasoline. So you're comparing the environmental impact of making a 92 lb battery with that of burning 6,000 lbs of gasoline. Now nickel mining can be pretty messy, but the same can be said of oil drilling/fracking. Also, the Prius may do a lot more than 100,000 miles on that battery (there are multiple for sale on ebay with more than 200k miles), and when it is no longer viable, the nickel can be recycled.

There might be a little more copper cabling in the Prius and complexity to the motor, but it only weighs about 200 lbs more than the Civic and 92 lbs of that is battery."
That car has 43mpg. 
"Oh it‚Äôs a diesel, that‚Äôs why."
"Exactly. But even now, it's already greener than gasoline. A lot of people don't realize that gas engines are really *really* bad."
"I get the distinct impression that none of them get it.

You can make an electric car that's faster, had longer range, or looks cooler than a Tesla if you can solve the engineering problems and do the art necessary to do so, and any of those huge automakers probably could. They could maybe even take a loss on the first so many to undercut Tesla on price and get them out there.

But, at least for me, that still wouldn't do it. Tesla is selling more than a next-level car - they're selling a future in progress, and thanks to regular OTA updates, your car is heading for that future. Every other automaker creates a new design for each model year, I guess to give you inventive to upgrade, but that's counter to the nature of a machine that can basically last forever, plus it means it can only ever represent the present.

Now, if Mercedes-Benz had made a sporty electric sedan with the same sort of ""smartphone on wheels"" design that we know and love with OTA updates and a public vision for where they're taking those cars in the coming years, I'd have wanted to see where that was going before ordering my 3. But they're not. It's not how they roll. So, they'll keep rolling out new ""Tesla killers,"" and I'll keep enjoying my always-new space ship."
"Finally watching it:

> The top 5 cars traded (in? up?) for a $50k Tesla Model 3 cost under $20k

That's the mind-blowing thing for me. I'm right there in that statistic trying to sell my Impreza right now. OK, so it's the Limited Sport Wagon with an MSRP higher than $20K but I got it used 2 years ago for $16K. Most I've ever spent on a new vehicle before the 3 was $22k for my '02 Impreza OBS.

The 3 is making a whole *lot* of people spend more on a car than they ever have before. I'm curious to know what the top reasons are. For me it's because it's the first time I felt that spending more than ~$20k on a car was not just a total waste of money. I've been able to afford a $46k car for a while now but specifically didn't because I want to be smart with my money. I've got better things to invest in than an extra $20k on totally frivolous luxury.

I don't think that about the 3. It's either that I'm a bigger fanboi than I'm willing to admit or it's because the simplicity and elegance of a 100% electric drivetrain speaks to me for a piece of technology that's designed to *last*. An ICE engine is considered to be long-lasting if it passes the 200k mark and most of those will need a timing belt, water pump and other things replaced (as well as a lot of oil changes) to get there. I feel confident that once this car is paid off it won't even be close to being done. If I want I could likely keep it for another 10 years and only lose, what, 10% of my original battery range? Model S owners seem to report 4-5% loss over 5 years or so and the 3 has better battery tech that should degrade even slower so ...

Yeah, this car is a big game changer and I think we don't even know in what ways it will be changing things as time goes on."

"Toyota perfectly has the resources to pay more for design than Tesla did for the S, X and 3, easily (note that Teslas designer came from Mazda). The Japanese appreciate different design aesthetics than we do in most of the west. Thus you end up with all these busy ""angly"" designs where it looks like the tail lights just was glued to the exterior of the car. They appreciate each detail indivindually, but for us it just becomes busy and weird. 

That said, Toyota has made a lot of seriously bland cars as well. "
"I disagree entirely. I love the look of many Toyotas. Are they the sexiest cars in the world? Not even close, but I grew up with them and think most of them look fine, even good. Yet when they designed the Prius, they decided social signalling was important so they made this funky-ass looking car to make people feel special about themselves."
"The new Corolla hatchback, Camry, most of Honda‚Äôs lineup, new Jetta, GTi etc begs to differ.

Toyota made boring appliances that looked boring. Now they‚Äôre actually making them look decent.

There‚Äôs a lot of nice looking cheaper cars now. "

I'm pretty sure I read that the Model 3 has the lowest CD of any sedan ever made. Are those other cars you mentioned not sedans?
"The ""technology improves"" argument is stupid. The GM EV1 was .19 in 1996. No production car since has come close, despite 20 years of ""technology improves"". High coefficients of drag are  purely a design decision."
"No, it's required by law that the utility must source *additional* green power to meet your demand on top of whatever green power they otherwise generate or buy. These days the premium is often insignificant compared to your purchase (power bill) and you're stuck paying a power bill regardless so you might as well use all that money to drive change. 

Electrons are fungible, so it makes no sense to look at what the utility sends you, you have to look at the grid's mix of generation sources, and while laws vary by region, in the various regions I've lived the various laws worked on similar principles; buying green power means green generation equivalent to the purchase must be added to the existing mix (so if net demand isn't growing then dirty generation would have to be removed from the mix. And if net demand is growing, the utility is not allowed to just point to the extra green they would have to bring online anyway.) This makes clean generation plants more valuable to owners and utilities, and dirty generation plants less valuable to owners and utilities.

It certainly sounds mighty suspicious on its face, but if you look into it, it's a pretty good system that hastens the greening of the grid. (Though it wouldn't surprise me to hear about corrupt areas selling greenwash BS, so always check; just because it's a good attempt in many places obviously doesn't mean all places are the same)"
"Ah, so with the drought (probably) induced by climate change, the wildfires were able to spread faster. Makes sense."
"I have lived in Southern California all my life (35 years) and we have had the same weather patterns as far back as I can remember. [Wikipedia even states that the wind/wildfire phenomenon has been a part of the ecosystem in Los Angeles for at least 5000 years. 
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana_winds#Historical_impact)

It rains in the winter, causing mudslides, and then vegetation grows. It's beautiful in the spring, and then we don't get any rain for about six months, so by the fall everything is dead. (Like most parts of the country). The Santa Ana winds are a local weather pattern that forms every year (much like the Chinook winds in Alaska or the Haboobs in the Middle East) creating hot, extremely dry weather conditions. I often tell people that September is always the hottest month of the year in SoCal. The extremely dry, hot, gusty winds just need a spark to burn all that vegetation and boom you have yourself a fire season. The burned out areas are susceptible to mudslides when it rains again and you have yourself a cycle.

I don't deny climate change either, but this is a weather phenomenon which has gone on for a very long time. Some years the fires hit structures (like this year). Some years they don't so you probably don't hear about them on your news in other parts of the country. But the Earth isn't all like ""oh, it's slightly hotter, that's all I need to fuck up the entire world""...weather patterns are much more complex than that. It doesn't help, sure, but it isn't like a switch has just been thrown and disasters are suddenly happening that haven't happened before. "

"They don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre being an asshole. It‚Äôs not like someone who cuts in line or something where they know they‚Äôre being an asshole and don‚Äôt care. They genuinely believe, at least on some level, that global warming isn‚Äôt real or isn‚Äôt caused by us.

If someone blatantly cuts in front of you while you‚Äôre waiting in line (or, for example, people who roll coal), by all means, call them out. If someone doesn‚Äôt realize you‚Äôre waiting and accidentally steps in front of you, you wouldn‚Äôt call them a fucking moron and try to make them feel stupid, would you? You‚Äôd politely tell them that the line starts back there.

You can be right and still be an asshole. By doing that, you set the cause back by making people harder to convince in the future. Again, all you‚Äôre accomplishing is making yourself feel smarter than them."

This is what environmentalists need to be focused on in order to win over people like me and the deniers.
 
The world's poor, although greatly decreasing in number for a long time thanks to things like abundant and energy dense fossil fuels, are the most vulnerable to proposed climate change regulations. Celebrities and the progressive elite can afford drastic cuts to their after-tax income and/or cost of living increases that are necessary to eliminate carbon emissions. The poor and lower middle class, however, cannot.

The wisest course of action is to play it safe. Stop subsidizing dirty sources of energy and promote the clean forms: solar, nuclear, wind, in that order. We also have many years to engineer solutions to this problem that don't involve lowering the living standards of billions of people, and bankrupting the institutions we'll need in order to solve other potential catastrophes, man-made and otherwise. What if the trend isn't reversible via drastic cuts to CO2 emissions? All you've done then is decrease living standards while getting the double whammy of a global natural disaster epidemic.

I don't think 'retard' or 'stupid' are useful.   Generally in my experience it's less that they're dumb and more that they overestimate their own expertise while also underestimating the depth of expertise of climatologists and underestimating the degree of unanimity within the relevant scientific fields.   

It's not that we think climatology 'skeptics' are dumb, rather that *they* think the scientists in the field are dumb.  Dumb enough to forget to take the sun into account, dumb enough to not be aware of solar cycles, dumb enough to not know about volcanic or other natural sources of CO2, etc.    "
"1. You can not have a ""local"" climate - climate is much broader than any one locale.  
2. It is not very speculative when you model in all the factors mathematically, that's precisely what PhD's in climate/weather/statistics are doing with increasing precision. Can you explain precisely the graduate and beyond level statistics and computation that go into these calculations?
3. A large shift in albedo would be easily explained - less cold, less snow cover, less albedo. Since you didn't link to any specific case or evidence, I don't know what specific data you are referring to, but anyway: that is a theoretical model which is already occurring in the Arctic. Less sea ice, less snow on the land that is there, more heat absorption, positive feedback. "
"If the greenhouse effect is real, then it's possible to destroy the planet just by adding sufficient CO2, no?--regardless of what else is happening. The only question that requires real-world data is whether we're adding enough CO2 to do that, and the answer is yes.

 I'm very tempted to quibble about those other things because they're silly AF, but that would just be a distraction."
"Just a quick point about sun activity, solar irradiance has stayed about steady recently, and has slightly decreased, so the sun can‚Äôt be what‚Äôs causing this upward trend of temperature, same with axis wobbling which happens over much larger timescales than the past centuries. When accounting for all variables (ie. the sun, aerosols, and more), we have a clear correlation between CO2 levels and global temperature. We also understand how CO2 traps in our atmosphere. We can even measure carbon isotopes in the atmosphere to know that the CO2 from fossil fuels has ended up in the atmosphere.

How we deal with this problem is more of a political/economic issue, but we have a very good grasp on modeling climate change and how CO2 originating from fossil fuels are the main cause of recent global warming. I don‚Äôt want this to come off rude at all so i‚Äôm sorry if it does, but i think knowing how solidly we understand CO2‚Äôs impact on the climate allows humanity to move on to the more important issue of dealing with it, which has much more room for debate regarding policy or other means."

I'm right there with you. I never was really into cars (except Japanese cars since they're reliable) even after going to several auto shows. However the Tesla as a brand has been the first car automaker that actually makes me want to spend on a 30k+ car.

I stand by my analysis but I totally concur with your edit.  People have a preconceived idea of aerodynamics so the end result is a compromise of aerodynamics and styling.   Electric cars have significantly more design flexibility but Tesla (gladly) follows traditional design notions which were built around the design limitations of ICEs.

I think a far more common scenario is ""I know climate change is real, but I'm already too dug in and too proud to admit it or change who I vote for so I'm just going to lie and say it's a hoax because most people are too polite to call me out on it."" And I think, as with every other topic, letting someone lie with no pushback only normalizes it and emboldens them to lie about it even more.

Global warming might very well be real! I admit that, its the consequences that worry me."
"How can you equate something so concrete as gravity to global warming?

It really is so unfortunate that the topic has become so political that real discussions can no longer be had. 

just web search ""global warming fake"" and try reading what people have to say about it. There is no harm in better understanding what other people think and you are free to make your mind up. It just really seems there is a lack of understanding different view points than what is put out there by the MSM every day.

"> Do you really think that liberals want to improve the environment, decrease petroleum dependence, clean the air, clean the water, and use cheaper energy sources just to spite the conservatives? 

No. Do you really think conservatives .... *just to spite the liberals*? C'mon, we could do this all day.  You have a pretty na√Øve view of the world if you think politics is 100% tribal. You can always find a majority on a side who believes in X, but it's not comprised of the same majority who believes in Y. Conflating facts about the two groups to prove a point is moronic.

Do yourself a favor a relinquish your two-party, black and white view of the world and accept that most people want what's best for them, their family, and their community in that order.

""  takes freedoms from individuals.""

freedom for what ? for choking the environment without any consequences ? for a group of people who love their rights, you seem very ignorant of the fact that ecosystems have rights too.

"Yeah, I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and explain how a state should function to you. Your worried about consequences, here‚Äôs a consequence, as warming ramps up, migration which I‚Äôm sure you are worried about too, will ramp up a 1000%. Where do you think people will go when Bangladesh is uninhabitable. You can act all muh liberty and bullshit, but truth of the matter is only governments have the size and the resources required to fight global warming at its full scale. It might be more taxes, more public transport god knows what more, but green investment from the government. None of the corporations who have a vested interest in keeping the status quo will do anything. The best thing about Tesla is this, they don‚Äôt have a vested interest in fossil fuels. So maybe worry a little bit more of the human consequence of global warming and not some vague notion of the government or corporations using it to their own end. Like that hasn‚Äôt ever happened before."
"I'm not American so I don't have to care about your politics, of course in this case it's a concern for the whole world... 

However, as an earth science student it's very easy for me to look at the topic objectively by reading the course literature, articles, IPCC reports and listening to my lecturers and others. The underlying thing in science is data. Data is everything. 

I could search for what you propose but I could also search for ""vaccines cause autism"", what's the point? 

When you are saying make up your mind your mind you are claiming that everything is open to personal opinions as including science. 

That is quite problematic as you see, in many places outside the US not everyone is trying to sell you something. I wouldn't second quess my doctor because I didn't go to medical school and my doctor doesn't get more money regardless of what prescription he /she signs.

As scientists are people, they have different opinions. Such as how to best devise an experiment, or for instance if the correct statistical method is used. There can also be two schools of thought, two competing theories (for a while).

 The important point here is that peer review is like nothing most people have experienced. People will question your every assumption given the chance and your calculations and conclusions. It is a very solid procedure. Absolutely not 100% but has been incredibly successful. 

It's very late here and I realise that I may not have written my reply entirely coherent. 

I'll just leave you with this. If you are interested Google Arrhenius CO2 paper, it's from 1895. He was the first scientist to determine the warming effects carbon dioxide has in the atmosphere. "

"Absolutely!

Who says we shouldn't? The core of education is not memorization...it is learning how to learn. What harm is there in telling them hey, some people believe this and this is why. Others believe this and this is why. We need to encourage independent thinking and when we come across it we need to be empathetic for one another. Even if we KNOw they are flat wrong. Empathy is important for them to understand. The best way for me to agree with global warming is to be befriended by someone who believes it. To have a relationship where we can discuss openly the topic, where they put their beliefs on the line just as much as me. That's how it should work. 

What it should never be is what currently exists, the ""I'm right and you are wrong so na na!"" That is so damaging to society. "

I have done this and it has informed me of my present doubt. if you were to do this you would be significantly less sure about global warming.

Everything you say is a deceitful lie. Shame on you for obfuscating a clear topic.

"I have spent full days googling and reading. I do not want to repeat that so unfortunately i am not going to write a dissertation however I do want to try and share my perspective which i think i can do without that...

First, Statistically speaking correlation does not equal causation. Though right now, it may appear indisputable there always exists the possibility that a confounding variable exists.

Second, Are scientists beyond reproach from ethical practices? When you have whole departments built on the premise of climate change there is no doubt they will produce data to support climate change. To produce anything but data supporting it would result in the department losing funding. [According to the GAO, annual federal climate spending has increased from $4.6 billion in 2003 to $8.8 billion in 2010, amounting to $106.7 billion over that period](https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2011/08/23/the-alarming-cost-of-climate-change-hysteria/#242909af7ebb) It seems these departments are donig a good job of securing government funding...Dont belive me? [Vox wrote a great article about it](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process) 

Science is not about putting forth absolute truths. The point of science is to continue with learning and knowing that what we know today may be challenged in the future. For instance on r/all [Did a nearby supernova cause one of Earth‚Äôs mass extinctions?](http://www.astronomy.com/news/2018/12/did-a-nearby-supernova-cause-one-of-earths-mass-extinctions) A totally unknown event may have caused a mass extinction. There should be an expectation that the understanding we have right now of climate will change as we learn more. Dont forget that global cooling was the big climate news in the past. Climate change theory is possibly the most complex field of study known to man. There are infinite variables and for science to proudly announce they have mastered it all and know definitively what will happen 100 years from now doesnt seem like a smart stance to hold. I would be much more eager to hear from scientists who talk from a place of knowledge but also acknowledge the unknowns, limitations and possible alternatives. You can understand why those are almost non existent anymore because of the way science is funded though. 

Global Warming is highly political and the progressive left claims that only they have the answers. I find that dis-ingenuous and dangerous. Do you want to know why? It is because progressives believe in big government and believe in increasing government spending. If they are given power, climate science gets more money, climate science produces material that supports progressiveness and they feed more money. It is a cycle that perfectly matches human nature and is plainly understood. 

Ultimately though...I dont know if it is real or not. I certainly know that many studies claim to have proof. What I dont see is a healthy debate on the subject and when people, such as myself, try to have a discussion we are bullied and ridiculed with the purpose of shutting down conversation. That is the most dangerous thing that can happen because if conversations cannot happen then we grow divided as a people and the least harmful way of settling differences is through communication. I really admire a local scientist that has a weather blog in my area. [cliff mass blog](https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/) He believes in global warming and has written great blog posts on it. I find his writing persuasive and if I were to make my mind up on the subject i would rely heavily on his teachings. I appreciate that he approaches the subject with integrity and is respectful of the scientific method.

I challenge you as a scientist. Go seek out other peers who dont share your views and start a dialogue with them about it. It can only improve your knowledge and understanding. Maybe even try to write a dissertation on refuting global warming! see what that can bring forth. There should be many sources of science to pull from.

So you are either too ignorant regarding the scientific method to do anything more than regurgitate fossil fuel industry talking points OR you are actually evil and know that the data is irrefutable but are doing your best to sow seeds of doubt. 

Regardless of the above I will be here lurking like your angelic subconscious to remind you and everyone you reply to on this topic. You are decidedly NOT open minded but I am here to help!"

I'll wait for your balanced, well researched, documented response.  Since you have ""spent full days googling and reading."""
I'm not a climate scientist. If 100% of climate scientists agree on global warming that throws up huge red flags to anyone versed in middle school science or higher. There should be and are arguments against a theory that are also supported by data. Thats the way the scientific method works. Climate scientists do not have all the answers. If you want a scientific discussion find a climate scientist that keeps an open mind. I have said multiple times my view and that i am not going to spend my time doing research for you.

"To put this is perspective for you, Do you accept that smoking causes cancer?"
Smoking is correlated to cancer. It probably does however correlation is not causation. 
What do you base your opinion on?  Why do you say smoking is correlated to cancer?
"If i understand the situation here...you have never read or heard of any science that goes against the theory of global warming. You believe that the only way to combat it is through government control of human activities. On the internet, you came across someone who has read alternative ideas on the subject. This person stated they dont want to re-dig into all the information freely available on the internet but has encouraged you to do this for your own benefit. This angers you. 

Just do some googling (Then try bing or duckduckgo) and read up on the subject. Read the stuff you are told not to read. See what you can make of it. Are you afraid you will find out that global warming isnt so straight forward as you have been lead to believe?"
"I am a scientist.  I already am familiar with the actual publications (not some random internet guy's ""interpretation"").  In fact, I was one of the skeptical non-believers until the BEST study was released.  You didn't answer my question about smoking.  Why do you believe that smoking is correlated with cancer but do not believe that human created CO2 is correlated with climate change?

You have bought into the fossil fuel industry's FUD, either willfully or ignorantly.  The same FUD occurred during the 60s when it was clear that smoking causes cancer.  PR firms were hired by the tobacco industry to sow the seeds of doubt in the correlation between smoking and cancer.  The fossil fuel industry has hired THE EXACT SAME PR FIRMS to spread FUD regarding the connection between the burning of fossil fuels and climate change.  Don't take my word for it - you should watch (or read) The Merchants of Doubt.

Regardless of the above, I have shown you literature proof that burning fossil fuels kills people.  A large number of people.  Your insistence on your ""right"" to burn fossil fuels infringes upon the rights of others by harming their health, which is like a smoker walking around and blowing smoke into other people's face.  Shame on you.

So I will be here pointing out to everyone you reply to that your claim to be ""open minded"" and reasonable is just a charade."
You don't seem to have a scientific mind. I hope you develop it in your work.

"Lol.  That's the guy that said the weed killer Round Up is safe to drink but freaked and refused a quart when offered.  More importantly, he is a member of the Heartland Institute, that vile institution who first led the campaign to discredit the consensus that smoking causes cancer (yes!) and later to sow doubt into the consensus regarding anthropogenic climate change.  Jesus, dude, you just gave one of the best examples of gaslighting as portrayed in The Merchants of Doubt.  You want to talk about financial bias - the Heartland Institute is fully funded by Koch Industries, ExxonMobile, etc who ALL make TRILLIONS (note not millions) from the fossil fuel industry.

I would laugh if it weren't tragic that anyone would listen to these industry shills."
Does what he has to say have sounds logic and basis in facts? 
"No. Very little of what he said has any relevance to the modern data and facts. That‚Äôs 45 minutes I can‚Äôt get back listening to a bought and paid for old man that hasn‚Äôt reviewed any of the latest facts and data in climatology since his education in 1972. 

Now YOU need to understand the BEST study by Richard Muller. He was the leading skeptic of the famed ‚Äúhockey stick‚Äù graph by Mann et al.  He went on the lecture circuit and became one of the leading critics of the earth surface temperature data published at the time. He decided to collect and completely independently reanalyze the data in an effort to disprove the now accepted assumption that the Earths temperature is increasing at an unprecedented level. He obtained funding from Koch Industries to complete his studies. Let that sink in. The Koch brothers funded his study which hoped to disprove the entire basis for climate change. Because he‚Äôs a good scientist, though, he didn‚Äôt let that bias alter his study. His study confirmed that the Earths surface temperature is increasing at an unprecedented level and that it is also certainly caused by human activity. He lost his funding from Koch industries.  If that story doesn‚Äôt convince EVERY skeptic that human activity is dramatically changing the climate (as it did me) then those skeptics are truly not willing to listen to reason and facts.

FACTS:
1.	Human activity burns fossil fuels, a byproduct of which is CO2, which is released into the atmosphere.
2.	CO2 absorbs electromagnetic radiation in the infrared spectrum.  A higher concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere causes a higher temperature because the CO2 is absorbing more energy from the infrared spectrum, which results when the earth‚Äôs surface releases radiation from solar heating.  CO2 essentially ‚Äúblocks‚Äù the release of energy from the earth into space, which is why it is called a greenhouse gas.
3.	CO2 levels were about 300ppm in 1950.  They are now over 400ppm, a level that has not been seen in greater than 400,000 years.  That increase of over 100ppm has changed faster than any time in history.
4.	This increase in CO2 levels is almost entirely due to the burning of fossil fuels, based upon carbon isotope analysis of CO2 in the atmosphere.
5.	Burning fossil fuels also releases toxic chemicals and pollution, which costs human lives.

These are facts that are not in dispute by any reasonable human with a modicum of non biased knowledge about climate change.  We can have reasonable arguments all day long about what the proper approach should be to this problem, but there are no reasonable arguments from the ‚Äúskeptics‚Äù until they accept the above facts.  Burning fossil fuels is changing our climate and killing humans.  Notice that I am not trying to fear monger or predict what the future holds.  I am just saying that, based upon the facts, continuing to burn fossil fuels is bad.  Bad for our health and bad for the environment (especially because of the dramatic RATE of change).

So no, I am done listening to people who argue things like ‚Äúincreased CO2 isn‚Äôt bad‚Äù or ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù or ‚Äúscientists are lying for funding‚Äù or ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not sure it‚Äôs humans‚Äù or ‚Äúit snowed today so that disproves climate change‚Äù because ALL of these arguments are false, easily disproven, and are pushed by The Merchants of Doubt for their own selfish interests and monetary gains (which by the way, are TRILLIONS of dollars as opposed to MILLIONS of dollars for research funding that you claim are biasing scientists).

I am not going to convince you but I will absolutely be here lurking calling you out when you claim that you are ‚Äúopen minded‚Äù and ‚Äújust want to have a reasonable conversation‚Äù because you don‚Äôt really want those things.  You just want to hold onto your belief that the science isn‚Äôt settled and you want to continue burning fossil fuels and violating the rights of your fellow humans by harming their health and altering the environment in potentially irreversible ways.  Shame.  On.  You."
"Glad we can agree on something. I am not trying to convince you, nor you convince me. so lets keep that in mind because i would really love to pick your brain on some things and i am sure you mine. I will do my best to not belittle or reduce to name calling, I hope you do the same because I hope you will see I am not an unreasonable person, as most people are not if you get to know them. Identity politics is so poisonous. 

The whole mantra of ""dont listen to (enter peron or entities name) because they are funded by (government, koch bros, oil companies"" is very damaging. As a believer in the scientific method I want as many scientists as possible to have their work funded. If we only deem government as the only moral funding source we risk the symbiotic relationship we see with climate research. So no, just because big oil finances a study should not deter you from reading it or not taking account their findings. As a person, when talking to someone who believes the ""science is settled"" is alarming. 


I have said many times, I have doubts on global warming...I like to keep an open mind. I am not a climate change denier though. I appreciate conversations on the subject and at this point in time i have not made my mind up on the topic. I do know that politically the science of climate change is used by the left to push their agendas. Being a conservative I find this dis-ingenuous because conservative values have solutions for global warming too.

Anyway. It is a complex situation and i dont have my mind set. Thank you for taking time to converse on the subject. If i have more time later i will type more of my thoughts."
"It‚Äôs not that complex. I will not listen to the opinions of someone who hasn‚Äôt contributed anything to the research in a field in decades and they are funded by an industry whose profit depends upon harming others. 

‚ÄúIt is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.‚Äù  Upton Sinclair

Remember, fossil fuel industry = $ trillions. Climate research = $ millions. 
I have friends who are climatologist researchers. They tell me they‚Äôd love to disprove climate change because it would result in their winning a Nobel Prize. That blows the whole ‚Äúthey are lying because of research money‚Äù argument out of the water. 

Watch The Merchants of Doubt. It‚Äôs the best thing any American can do to understand obfuscation of well established facts to the benefit of corporate profits and detriment to the average citizen. I am glad when smoking is banned because I don‚Äôt want someone else‚Äôs selfish choice harming my health. Similarly, I will be glad when burning fossil fuels is banned or greatly curtailed for the same reason. Any true conservative should feel the same way. Governments primary responsibility is to protect its citizens rights (life liberty poh) from being infringed upon by others.  Even Hayek in ‚ÄúThe Path to Serfdom‚Äù said the same thing. Notice that I‚Äôve made no hyperbolic statement about Armageddon or end of the world climate catastrophe. I just want my rights protected.  And you should too. "

I wouldn't mind getting arrested
I wonder if they could put their police software on the display
*Your uber has arrived..*
Criminals won‚Äôt stand a chance!
"lmao totally necessary for a police car, funds well spent"
Make sure you turn the sound on. 
"Well, we know what they will be charged with. "
"The problem I'd like to point out is having doors which fold up is probably really inconvenient for transporting arrestees.

The number of people who get arrested and kick the patrol car door is really annoying."
this car is sick but fuck 12 
Needs more red.
And what did they say about underfunded? 
Good idea since they can accelerate faster than just about anything out there.
"I would think the falcon doors wouldn't really be practical for police application. Then again, I'm sure it would be too much money to build a police spec Model X, but dammit that would be too cool. "
take me to jail.
I hope the doors flap at you when you don't stop 
Just pray they are on low charge before running
I‚Äôm moving to Switzerland just to break the road laws JUST to see one of these!
Safety lights my butt. More like epileptic seizure lights!
"They should have also added pit maneuver bumpers, imagine seeing a chase!"
Seizure inducing much
I'm more likely to enter a Tesla with Falcon Wings as a criminal than I am with one that I bought
Can we get these in America? So i can say i drive a Tesla. You know because i can' afford one on a police officer's salary. 
"I helped build that guy!!
"
Get arrested just to ride in one of those
That's an expensive cop car. 
"Well, looks like I‚Äôm going to be speeding."
Those lights just give paralysis.
They should have done the Christmas easter egg for this. 
What a horrible idea. 
It's officially the future.
"How will the criminals bump their heads on the top of the car with these use falcon doors, though??"
Well I guess they won‚Äôt be able to use the doors in a shootout but it is Switzerland so I don‚Äôt know if they really need it. 
"I like how it says POLICE, STOP, because when read out loud it sounds like PUH-LEASE STOP!"
Can't wait for the follow up post about them trying to service the vehicle!
"I Hope they add some sort of bumper guard in the front and back. It would be devastating to have this beaut of a car get all rekt, cuz of aggressive drivers/maneuvers. "
"Here, have an EMP"
Imagine trying to shake one of these off your tail 
"Swiss police, trimming the population one epileptic at a time. "
Imagine being arrested and getting to sit in the back of a Tesla model X
"Tesla X seems like a curious chioce, since it is essentially a fatter model S, with the same old style battery cells and squirrel-cage motor(s). The Tesla S reportedly has problem on track days due to overheat, so the X with its big body and even higher air drag coefficient could be unable to give chase for sustained times?"
Time for criminals to upgrade to supervillain and carry an EMP-cannon that gets police BEVs off their tail?
"Always glad to see my taxes are used wisely. It would be a shame to use it for important matters or just to promote a company of the country you know, instead of one with no ties with our economy . "
Aren't all the lights draining the batteries?
"My work makes all those lights, and I‚Äôm glad to see these going on a Tesla. Now I feel 1.57% cooler for building these. "
"It needs a push bar. 

In the US police idle in their vehicles a day long.  I wonder how range is going to work out for these folks. "
Yeah definitely agree with all that! 
Seems more like a stunt. Cops idle in cars heavily and can sit with their lights on even LEDs would drain the battery. I wouldn't think this would be terrible feasible YET. One day but not sure yet. Normal cars have to have a new specific wiring harness due to all the added electronics and gear in police vehicles on top of different brakes and suspension due to the drastic change in weight and weight distribution from what the vehicles are normally set up for. 
Really disappointed they didn‚Äôt line the inside of the falcon doors with light strips like the US Highway Cops have with the folding light towers
Wonder if the lights are hooked up to the battery system or have their own independent battery system?
"Do you know why I pulled you over?  

Obviously you wanted me to have a seisure.  Turn down the lights."
"So, no cops just a selfdriving car?"
Why use a $100k car to ram drunks with ugly cars off the road?
"Hey, OP -

Can you mark this NSFW please? Police lights cause some sensory distortion for me and it is probably a problem for others like me. 

That being said, this is really cool and the other Redditor‚Äôs ‚Äústop please‚Äù comment had me giggling, hahah üòÑ

Edit: Alright, I get it. üòû Browse at my own risk. "
"Bad idea. This could actually increase crime, cause people are going to want to get arrested in one of those things."
"Nah, but the cameras will be there! And you'd have to be going 6 kph* to get their attention ;)

* depending on location of the infraction"
"It was pretty eye opening seeing the ‚Ç¨4,000 on the spot fine and driving ban Chris got on 44Teeth when they were in Switzerland. "
That‚Äôs a good thing.  Speed kills.
I strongly support government cars moving towards electric. Now they need to make a cheap vehicle that is easy to maintain to replace the USPS [Grumman LLV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumman_LLV)
"Firefighter here. Im not sure EVs are the best for police work (they spend most of the day in the field, with little time to charge, and are sometimes utilized for 24+ hours straight) but they would be PERFECT in the fire service if we could financially justify EVs to the public (taxpayer funding, ya know). 

Our Chiefs drive the Special Service Chevy Tahoes. We have about 20 of them.  They spend the majority of the day plugged in to a 120V shore line in the bay at the station, to keep the MDC (laptop) charged and running.  So, the ‚Äúinfrastructure‚Äù is really already there, and the ‚Äúkeep it plugged in when not in use‚Äù mentality is already there. 

When we are at scenes, they have to leave the Tahoe‚Äôs running to keep everything charged, and keep the lights on Without killing the battery. Obviously not really a concern with an EV with a decent battery range. 

Ambulances are another good example - the box has to be kept cool at all times for the medication stored back there, so they are constantly either plugged in at the station, or left running.  EV could really help clean that up. 

The only problem is - we can buy a brand new PPV Tahoe for $34k.  As soon as a bigger EV can get there, I think you‚Äôll start to see a shift. "
"I disagree, its extremely inconvenient to have to charge the car in the middle of the day, especially considering how much the police drive. If electric cars would get bigger batteries that lasted longer this would not be an issue."
They have Security Xs at Giga 1. I love them except for their lights can be very blinding at 5 in the morning. 
Wonder if they‚Äôll have extra mileage and features.
Gull wing doors on a police car though? 
"Elon did mention he's gonna strap at least 10 compressed air thrusters to the 2020 roadster, using a spacex COPV tank to store the air. Going to be fucking revolutionary"
You can use them to boost you and if it isn't enough to catch up you just fire them as missiles. Pretty good idea. 
"*cue that one line from FnF: Tokyo Drift about 'if you go faster than 180k(/ph) they can't catch you, so they don't even try'*"
Do you mean kmh?
Because one is right next to the logo and one is almost off the grille. It‚Äôs not symmetrical at all
I think that‚Äôs ‚ÄúSTOP POLIZEI‚Äù (Police). 
"They're really common here in The Netherlands. Either in the light bar itself, or as shown in the video, in the sun visor."
Very common for undercover police
I want one in my car that says -> MOVE RIGHT -> in reverse that I can flash on and off. 
These are pretty standard allover europe https://i.imgur.com/oSWHtgm.jpg
People start committing crimes to get taken to the police station in a Tesla. 
Lol the streets are so narrow it‚Äôll be like 8mph
*so cool to watch
Well better then to the Saudis for using all the oil for their ICE cars.
"The XP100D is 49'000 CHF more expensive than their current vehicles. BUT! To be fair, the overall cost of ownership will be much lower since the fuel+repair costs are a lot less than those of their current ICE vehicles. Also, the resale value of the Model X is much higher. "
I have a feeling these guys won‚Äôt be using autopilot. 
"This is exactly what I've been thinking about. But well, even though the car will be equipped with the AP hardware, I don't think, they paid for the AP to be unlocked, so that most likely won't be a problem."
"That's a good question, but I doubt they'd normally be using AP when the lights are on. Afaik AP doesn't like breaking traffic laws."
Especially with all the lights and sirens on.
"The slow turnaround from charging seems like it‚Äôs going to be a lot harder to get the same usage out of it. Especially with all the extra electronics onboard that cannot be turned off. 

Conventional police cars get used sometimes around the clock, and with regular maintenance, can be used for well over a decade with hundreds of thousands of miles. "
"Much better long term, in the UK we lose thousands just for officers putting the wrong fuels in (we have a mix of petrol and diesel cars with no clear labels on most), never mind the cost of all the fuel that would be saved with EVs, hope the UK follows the Swizz example"
[deleted]
"140k a piece new plus all the mods.  They could get 5 reasonable cars for that.  This is a total waste.  And people can say ‚ÄúSwitzerland is rich‚Äù, but if they have that sort of money maybe they can contribute to help all the terrible things in the world "
How so?
"Well, considering we have Sandoz, Novartis and Roche (aka some of the biggest Pharma Corporations in the World) over here...
We have enough money for a few Tesla.
Especially after the Canton next to us got a credit of 80 Million swiss francs a few years ago 'cause, surprise surprise, the canton has even lower taxes than we have and are constantly in the red (which fits their canton emblem which is a red fancied up version of our emblem)."
How far do you think a gas powered car can drive before it needs a refill?
You go to third party police contractors for equipment to be installed. 
"Tesla doesn't do anything, they instal these equipments themselves. These are in no way connected to the Tesla software. They just install extra 3rd party displays and buttons for the police functions and don't touch the Tesla's."

Nope. Can't and Tesla won't. They just install an extra display left of the blinker like lots of taxi's have. Even current police cars from different brands on the road have extra displays usually.
The extra lights and electronics will barely move the needle on the batteries compared to propelling a multi ton vehicle at highways speeds 
"They are not finished yet, maybe they are adding them right now"
We don‚Äôt ram other people in Switzerland. To polite
I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre being downvoted
what? So if I speed through Basel I won‚Äôt be stopped by this awesome Model X ? Damn ...
Super strict on the tunnels. I got 3 tickets by mail my first tour of Germany for less than 10km over. 
"Out of curiosity how do speed limits work in Europe and/or Switzerland? In the US in alot of areas they have posted max speed limits, but it always seems that those are suggestions and not requirements, and it isn't till you go a certain margin over that in which you can get a ticket. I'm curious if that's the case over there or not."
"fines in Switzerland are based on annual income afaik. So a millionaire will pay more than a normal person. Which I think is fair. With an annual income of 30.000 a fine of 30 should have a comparable impact as a fine of 3.000 for an annual income of 3.000.000 For me they should even progressively do that, but just linear. "
"there was this one joke going around when I worked on a race track :

"Yeah, your only bet right now is something like the Hyundai Kona Electric, which is likely around $33k for 250-300 mi."
"EVs are best for police work for exactly the reasons you specify: they spend a lot of time driving *every day*.  This results in much lower operational costs than an ICE vehicle, more than offsetting the higher purchase cost.

Fire vehicles would probably be best served with hybrids, at least until battery costs are so low that a long range EV costs the same as an ICE vehicle.. which may happen before we have a chance to switch to hybrids."
"At the same time, they won't be sitting around idling all the time using up gasoline and adding wear to an engine. I can't imagine them needing the charge more than on a nightly basis in many circumstances. Plus if they go on break they can just charge up then. Charging isn't much of an issue for Teslas."
"Unless they're Highway Patrol they're going to spend most of the day idling rather than cruising at highway speed, and those Xs have 6 hours of nonstop 60mph highway cruising, 24+ hours of 25mph city cruising, or a week of idling available in a 100% charge.  These 3 cars probably won't be used for highway cruising."

I‚Äôm guessing the lights installed there also include a red light to the right (from our perspective) and that the light unit as a whole is symmetrical which makes the blues seems shifted left and the reds shifted right. They should have flipped one over to make the lights outside/inside instead of left/right for the sake of OCD.
I think they are recessed in the grill and it just looks that way
"Yep, it is. But that is standard, isn't it? Ok, on German police cars, that display most of the time is mounted on the roof (they can also display messages like ""please follow us"" or ""attention, accident ahead"", ...). But that might be difficult due to the falcon wing doors - or maybe the Swiss police just doesn't have these displays. I lived there for a couple of years, but can't really remember :\[\]"
Thank you. I couldn't see it too well on my phone screen.
I think you're right. Only Canadian police say please when they pull you over.
"Yeah I was about to say even if it‚Äôs Switzerland cops, ain‚Äôt no cop asking please. "

">we have a mix of petrol and diesel cars with no clear labels on most

I think it might be cheaper to just label them correctly instead of buying Teslas ;) but yeah, you are right"
I guess that is a good point.  The cost of fuel in Europe is a lot higher than here in the states.
You got some math to prove that?  How many years of gas would 100k cover.  Cuz these are 140k new plus mods.   
The Basel City is even making profit !
But that doesn‚Äôt mean blow whatever money you do have on these cars whose full potential probably won‚Äôt even be used.
Don't forget all the expensive only-dealership maintenance and repairs as those things are built impossible to work on and get parts just like an apple product.
"Exactly my point. I don‚Äôt understand people who buy stuff just because they have money, let alone people who try to justify it."
Its a 140k car....
A gas powered car can refill in 5 minutes. A model X takes 9.5 hours. The electric cars can‚Äôt be transferred between shifts.
That's Cool! But does Tesla provide incentives to governments to purchase or do the governments just go to Tesla when they want an electric car?

"Exceeding the posted speed limit in the US is an offence no matter how far you go over. The speed limits are not suggestions, they're the law. Some officers may choose not to ticket you for being 1mph over, and that's because there's a generally understood margin of error on your speedometer and on the radar. It's not like 55mph is a suggestion and it's ok to do 65mph. You're speeding if you breach 55mph.

That said, I understand the laws and choose to still drive over the speed limit. When I get caught, I don't complain.

So it's really the same in Europe, with exception to certain parts of the German Autobahn. You'll occasionally see white circular signs with 5 black parallel lines running diagonally across. This indicates that there's not a generally enforced speed limit. However, you could be pulled over for acting recklessly. 

Also in most countries there are generic speed limits for in town and out of town (50kph and 100kph) unless otherwise posted. "
"/u/bpitts2 answered well, but to expand upon that (for Switzerland, at least): There are [three general speed limits](http://swissbiz.ca/images/2015-06-25-13-03-12_speeding_5.jpg): 50 for towns, 80 for country roads and 120 for motorways. Of course, these can vary based on the specific region. Anything 20kph or over on any of those will result in massive fines, a loss of your license (generally starting at with 3 months) and possible jail time.

Speed cameras can be found anywhere, either fixed or mobile, and with or without a sign indicating that they are there. If the speed limit is posted at 50kph and the camera catches you going 57, you will get a fine for +2 kph (40 CHF, roughly $40). So they always give you a margin of error, but there is no mercy once you've crossed that line."
"Yes, this is one of those situations where, if you were going to implement it, it should not just be a baseline percentage and should be a progressive fine.

Take a 1% fine for example: a $300 fine for someone making $30,000/yr hurts way more than a $1000 fine for someone making $100,000/yr.

In the US someone making $30,000/yr is likely to be spending the vast majority of their income on essentials (rent, utilities, food, car, gas) and is more likely to be living paycheck to paycheck and cannot even afford the fine, where as someone making $100,000/yr, while likely having a nicer house/apartment and car likely has much more wiggle room when it comes to it not being the end of the world if they suddenly were down $1,000.

Don't do the crime if you can't do the time, I get it, but a strict percentage of income leads to situations where the rich are less incentivized to not break the law.

&#x200B;"
That is NOT fair. You should not be penalized for making more money. 
Fair enough.  Speeding everywhere-but-the-autobahn (and similar highways/roads designed for high speeds)-assuming-favorable-weather-and-traffic-conditions kills
"I guess big cities are different but in more rural parts of the US mail carriers have a VERY wide variety of vehicles. I've seen vans, jeeps, carollas and the like. I wouldn't be surprised to see teslas  soon because some USPS contractors I believe get paid/reembursed per-mile and driving an EV would increase their earnings greatly."
"Why couldn't they just use, i dunno, a Mercedes Sprinter?"
"Wait till you hear they design and help design aircraft like the A-10 Warthog, F-35 Lightning II, or the B-2 Spirit. Historical aircraft include the F4F Wildcat, F6F Hellcat and the TBF Avenger."
"Just wanted to note that was for the police, not for mail carriers: https://electrek.co/2018/01/18/lapd-bmw-i3-fleet-barely-used/"
"Eh, agree to disagree I guess.   I would say Police are still a way off from EV, just given the distributed and continuous nature of their calls, whereas Fire is more centralized to stations and already set up to charge.

Police do spend a lot of time driving every day, but that's usually a full day away from any charging stations, with the electronics on all day, and vehicles are frequently used directly from shift to shift, (so, 24+ hours straight) with no time to charge inbetween.  

In theory, police work sounds like a great situation for EVs.  But the way departents actually execute their daily operations isn't really well set up for EVs quite yet.  

But within the FD, at least for the light apparatus (chief's vehicles, ambulances, maintenance, squad, etc......NOT the engines/towers), EVs would be ideal TODAY.  If they're not active on a call, they're already being plugged in at the station via shore line to keep the MDC running, and to keep the a/c on in the ambulances...so no change necessary to convert to EV.  They could easily recharge between calls with the ability to plug in at the station."
"This might also make a difference where you are, in a big city the police barely drive 50km i a day while in rural areas that number can rise up to 500-600km in one shift."
"It's the lights. Police have to keep them running at full brightness during the length of a traffic stop, which will supposedly kill the battery.

Source: Police Chief for a medium-sized city (~400k people, $1B budget)"
yea the only problem is the top speed which for some reason the electric cars dont do so well on. 
"Nope, I just checked, it's 180. The RX7 in that clip clocks 197, cueing the dialog."
Do you mean kilometres per hour?
"Swiss police don't use red lights I'm pretty sure (except for the text board). [In this video](https://www.facebook.com/Kantonspolizei.Baselstadt.Karriere/videos/327590924726762/) you can see that they are symmetrical, I think it's just that the lights are not picked up right by the camera."
"Swiss police do have them on the roof as pointed out.

Two reasons I can think of for this DESIGN on the Model X:

1. The obvious one being the wing doors. 

2. The reduced range due to drag, aerodynamics is your enemy.

3. And the real reason... It would ruin the looks. "
US police (at least none that I‚Äôve seen) don‚Äôt have any sort of message like that. Just lights and sirens and a bullhorn to scream commands out of
"Yeah same in Switzerland. The display is flat and gets rotated up when they want to use it. Also for the follow or stop, they usually put arrows >>>>>>>> to show where to go which I find to be nice!

You ain't catching my Fiat 126p in there 
I'm not sure if this is crazy or genius..
"My family owned an auto shop that had a contract with a small village for police car repair for a few years. The amount of money they spent on their fleet of 8 cars was insane. 

I think they were mostly Crown Vic‚Äôs and every 30-40K miles they got new coolant hoses, even when they were not needed (just Preventative), brakes were done frequently, air filters, tires, oil changes. My guess is they spent 3-5K a year on preventative Maintenance. I don‚Äôt know how this relates to towns with their own repair facilities but either way EV don‚Äôt have near the same level of repair costs.

How maybe miles per shift do average patrol cars drive?"
Haha yeah you'd think so but apparently or forces can't afford properly labels :)
Fuel is about the same. Taxes are more.
"Yes, but how much are the alternatives? Police here usually have high end land/range rovers for armed officers, BMWs of some sort and Ford Focus RS's for the traffic cars, combine fuel savings, far less repairs (no engine to repair, leaving a tesla idle is far better than an ICE), less downtime because of those repairs, and I'm sure it will start working out well"
Absolute waste of money.   Same as when cops here get military equipment.  They just want it because it‚Äôs cool.  And somebody else is footing bill. 
Well it‚Äôs not their money and they will come up with all sorts of reasons why it makes sense but none of them really hold up and it comes down to they want to ride in luxury and style 
A very small drop in a very large bucket that is also an investment and test to see if it ends up saving money.  Worth it.
"It takes 9.5 hours with a 220V charger, the Tesla Supercharging stations (which are 440V) can recharge a car to 100% in about 75 minutes. I‚Äôm assuming they have one of those chargers as well, otherwise, yeah, this is a bit of a gimmick."
"I don't think they'll be charging them on a standard socket, with a quick charging station it's less than 2 hours 0-100% and going from 20-80% is much quicker because it's the optimal range for the battery to be in."
Good! Messing up the whole schedule can make hundreds of people late. If my tram is a few minutes late then I miss my S-Bahn and if I miss my S-Bahn then I miss my bus. If I miss my bus then I am an hour late and that is not acceptable.
Ha! That would be a sight to see! That place is a mess.
The tickets were around 8 euro. Plus the $25 fee from the rental agency.
"excellent explanation. The speed limit in germany is exactly that. A limit. Not a ‚Äûplease consider maybe not exceeding this arbitrary number by more than 20%‚Äú. 

Funny enough, most speed cameras are not set to the speed limit but higher.
And you have a general tolerance of 3 kph below 100 kph. So drive exactly 53 in a 50 zone and you are ok. BUT no speedometer is that precise. That‚Äôs where these 3 kph come from. A tolerance for speedo etc. Cars have to follow strict technical requirements in germany, so a speedo can NEVER show less that the actual speed driven (for example by changing wheels and tires to produce a larger circumference making you go further per wheel revolution.)

Generally 10 kph over the limit is what usually works. Except in a school zone (30 kph or slower)"
"Thanks for the info, I appreciate it."
"Except highway is 110 or 130 or Autobahn be nice. Never seen 120 in my life!?
Motorways are also 90 or 100 zones"
"I've heard some people (on the wealthier end of society) unironically respond with ""no, it's not prohibited, it's just $75 to park here"" when I told them........   


Incentives for richer people to break the law, especially because of definitely set-in-stone *absolute* and not *relative* fines, are bs. "
"thank you for explaining what the mess in
my head meant :) excellent description !"
"Not disagreeing with you, but it also finds you more for being successful. If other items follow this, it would factor greatly in what jobs would be worth. Want that $10k promotions and responsibilities? Now you have to factor in how much more you risk. Get caught with a headlight out? Now you pay more. Risk more.

It‚Äôs a bit messy. "
"The penalization is for speeding, not for ""making more money"".
"
What? They aren't being penelized for making more money. They're being penalized for speeding with a punishment that hurts them and a poor person equally.
You are not penalized because you make more money. You are penalized because of your unlawful actions. The fine just happens to be higher because it should convince you not to do it again. Maybe they could give everyone the option to do a few days in jail instead.
"The purpose of the fine is to discourage the behavior. A $25 or $50 speeding ticket for someone making $1000000/yr does not discourage that behavior - it just means that it costs that much to speed. On the other hand, it may be too much for a poor person, who now can't afford gas or food.

This is really obvious with parking, where you see expensive cars parked wherever they want. It's $5 to park in the lot and a $30  to park in front of the fire hydrant, but the fire hydrant spot is closer so it doesn't matter - just pay $30, that's not a punishment if you're rich, that's just the cost to park somewhere convenient. If the fine is to have any meaningful impact it needs to actually deter the behavior."
"You need to come at it from a different perspective.   Why is there a fine?  To discourage someone from doing it again.

A flat fine does nothing to discourage someone with lots of money. You would need to scale it up to make it equally painful.  Otherwise, using your logic, you‚Äôre just unfairly penalizing the poor person.

Note the richer person wouldn‚Äôt be penalized unless they did something wrong. They are penalized for their infraction, not for how much money they make.

If we did this in the US, maybe we wouldn‚Äôt see so many luxury cars ignoring the speed limits."
"Honestly, I don‚Äôt think speeding matters much in more cases than that. I‚Äôm from a rural town and there‚Äôs been times where it‚Äôs like 3am and there‚Äôs *no one* on the road at all, so going 10mph over the speed limit simply isn‚Äôt dangerous. That being said, speeding in a crowded street with pedestrians, in heavy flow traffic, or with rain/snow is extremely reckless and idiotic."
"Yeah, rural carriers who need to use their own vehicle (usually purchased for the job) get reimbursed for mileage. Having an EV of some sort would be nice of course, but do they even make a larger van/utility vehicle sized electric vehicle? You need a ton of room for all the mail and packages.  Even if they do make an electric that size, it‚Äôs probably not something affordable for most people.

It‚Äôll happen someday for sure though, once EVs become much more commonplace. "

"Can kill the 12V battery sure, but I can't imagine lights, especially LED lights, doing more than just nibbling off of a battery containing dozens of kWH. Then again I have no idea the kind of power they draw either."

Do you mean kilometers per hour?
"A lot of police in the U.S. have switched to only blue too. Makes sense, blue, cops, red, fire, red and blue, dead guy (ambulance,) orange and blue, snowstorm, orange, road work, red and orange, road on fire. "
"Actually, Federal Signal makes an LED programmable message light bar for police vehicles. NYPD uses a ton of them. "
"The US police is really (no offence) but pathetic, very ineffective and always using a complete Christmas-tree  light scheme. Very much unnecessary and distractive. Could learn a lot from police in Europe.  "
And guns to shoot innocents on a weekly basis. 
"Should have gotten police roadsters, then."
"Semi rural community where I intern, depending on call volume and what we feel like doing that day, 75-120 miles a shift. We spend a stupid amount of money on our cars, odds are one is out for a repair, oil change, or tire rotation a week. Almost everyone has their own cruiser which they take home, but the cars still usually have 500-600 miles on them a week. This means they need to get the oil changed about once a month. Tires go pretty quick, Ford‚Äôs Interceptor SUVs tend to have trouble with transmissions, which is usually a warrantied repair, but still a cruiser has to go out of service for a week or so. 

The concerns I see with using an EV for a cruiser is the charging time, if you have an agency without take home cars, you have to refuel and send a cruiser back out at the end of every other 8, 10, or 12 hour shift. We also have 3 radios, a computer, the lights, siren, radar, and license plate readers that all need to be plugged in. 

Police are also notoriously hard on cars, at least in the US, both inside and out, when you have to drive fast and in an abnormal way 2 or 3 times a shift odds are you‚Äôre going to be involved in an accident, clip a curb, or hit a deer at least once every couple years. Cruisers are also susceptible to being in accidents more, just because of the sheer amount of time officers spend driving around. The inside of the cars also get a lot of wear and tear, a lot of entering and exiting and moving metal ticket boxes, long guns, and officers moving in and out wearing a vest, and belt that make them bulkier and run against everything. This is wear I see repair costs that might be more than a Ford Explorer or Chevy Tahoe. Tesla‚Äôs interiors aren‚Äôt designed for police work with rubber floors and seats with indents to fit duty belts. I‚Äôd also assume repairs following accidents might be more. 

I think that using EVs as patrol cars is a good idea, and probably would save money over the 4-5 year life of the car, but there‚Äôs a few issues I see with it. If Tesla built a couple cars with the intent of public service I‚Äôd imagine they would sell well, especially with Ford and Chevy both getting rid of their sedans."
I can imagine a lot of damaged Teslas and charging stations if the same people are suddenly converted to EVs for their first time 
"Not sure what the US fuel charges are, but here in the UK the taxes here are ridiculous, 57.95 pence per litre, then 20% VAT on top of that, cheap now is about 119p per litre (about 157 cents) but loads of places average around 130-140 (up to 178 cents/litre)"
"
..which means that fuel costs more?"
Why do the police require cars that only very wealthy people drive?  You‚Äôre telling me they can‚Äôt do their job of driving around in a 30k car? It‚Äôs gotta be high end luxury?  That‚Äôs nonsense.  By your logic poor people should all spend all their money on high end luxury vehicles to save on long term costs.  That‚Äôs obviously false 
Take an earlier tram.
"You noticed that I was referring to [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limits_in_Switzerland), right?"
"There's a running joke among those with luxury cars that goes ""it's not a parking ticket, it's a receipt for premium parking"" "
"You don't even have to be rich in all cases.  In one larger city, the event parking rate was the same as the parking ticket, which you might not get or is reduced if you pay promptly, so why wouldn't people park closer?  (Although you also have to park so that you are not likely to get towed)."
As long as it doesn't scale up with your income (or savings) it is
That's what being penalized for making more money looks like 
Fine should be the same for everyone regardless of income. 
"That's basically the next frontier in EV, we've got road cars and lorries either released or in production but just the concepts of electric vans."

But when you need to have a car that can do 120+mph easily, good acceleration and really reliable, can do 400, 000 before being replaced, then if you put in more up front you save more over the long term.

I don't think a Ford KA, even if you could get 5 for the price of some police cars, I don't think a KA could do anywhere near as good of a job"
Waste 15 minutes every day because some fool may collide with the tram?

"Did you ninja edit you thief or was I just blind?

Haven't taken the traditional Nordic Skiing or French/Italian vaca that always passes through you guys yet since I was the kid in the child seat :-)

We non-germans etc. tend to get upset about being attributed the same idiotic laws or practices when it is in fact not EU wide common laws. Germans thinking charge plug standard is a law outside their hunting grounds being one of many car laws. We don't have mountains ether so no snow-chain specific laws except for when it is illegal abuse of nice spring time roads :D"
There is no penalty in a 300 $ fine if you make 3 million a year. If you make 30k a year a 300 dollar fine can be devastating. Why should you be penalized less for speeding just because you make more money?
No. The point of a fine is to impose a financial penelty for breaking a law. It's a deterrent. If the dollar amount is the same for everyone then there is no deterrent for rich people to not break the law.  This is why the fine is a percentage and not a hard dollar amount. Then everyone feels the same penelty for their behavior.
"On the other view point, more money gives you the ability to afford which laws you want to obey."
[deleted]
So you feel rich people should not feel the same impact of their illegal activity as a poor person?
"It is. But your notion of the valuation of the fine, and specifically the absolute valuation as the only one possible, is not the same as that of the Swiss. And they made their choice not by random, there are good ethical and moral grounds for how they chose. Hopefully you have excellent grounds to argue your absolutist stance, and it‚Äôs obvious conclusions. Three strikes rule is one of them, just so you know. "

"I'm French and fairly happy that the government keeps increasing taxes on fuel. When the price is higher, it forces people to reconsider the way they move and use personal transportations."
I wonder how much it'd cost to import a dodge police charger. They seem to be quite popular for police usage in the US.
"Yes, you can't be an hour late, that's not acceptable. Also other stuff can happen that make you miss the first tram."
"Haha - if those are the options, I guess you're blind :p  I did not edit my comment, ninja or otherwise. But I can imagine that it would be easy to miss the ""Switzerland"" part, when you're expecting something else.

Yeah, the Germans tend to make a lot of noise in the EU. Personally, I prefer to watch from the sidelines. Or in this case, ""the island in the middle of it all"" :D"
You're not penalized less. You're penalized the same amount. 
.... which is exactly what you wouldn't want. 
I mean.....yes.  
Fine should be the fine regardless of how much money you have. So yes. 
Propensity for all taxes is to go up and increase along with the size of government. The government would very much like us all to be dependent on them.
"I too have 2 electric vehicles.  You and I are fortunate. Yes we should do everything we can to ve more efficient but one has to consider the many that can't afford electric vehicles until they are produced in quantities. How they get around, work etc. Just don't downvote something because you don't agree."
"I know I didn‚Äôt specify, but this was referring to going home after work. I can‚Äôt take an earlier tram because I‚Äôm working and the next tram can only make the next train. It‚Äôs unacceptable for my commute home to be almost 2 hours.   
On the way to work a late tram will cause me to be 5 minutes late which is also unacceptable. It‚Äôs the first tram after my S pulls in. If I wanted to take an earlier tram then I would have to leave 30 minutes earlier. If you don‚Äôt live in Basel then you should know that people don‚Äôt normally hit the bright yellow trams and public transport is very reliable so breaking the flow makes a lot of people angry."
"You‚Äôre trying to argue that penalties can be only valued in the absolute. You need to do way better to support that argument, and I sense that once you realize what it truly is you‚Äôre saying, you‚Äôll reconsider. Start from the premise that the choice of a penalties‚Äô valuation is an entirely arbitrary one. If you choose absolute, you better had a good reason ‚Äì and calling it ‚Äúfair‚Äù is a circular argument. And there is no point in going any further until you have a clear idea why it is indeed a circular argument. "
How is the same amount more fair than the same proportion? Can you explain your thought process here?

So you‚Äôre an absolutist asshole. Thanks for making it clear. 
"A fine is still a fine. The point of a fine is to impose a financial risk to illegal behavior. If there is no risk to illegal behavior for a rich person then there is no deterrent to committing an illegal act.  Stop worshiping money and rich people and instead look at what the purpose of a fine is and what its for. 
Why are you all for punishing poor people more for the same crime? 
The fine is a percentage that is the same for everyone."

It's an interesting argument "
My thought process is simple. $100 is $100 dollars. Sure it means more to some than others but the fine is the fine. It's a very slippery slope getting into a world of percentage based or income based or savings based fining. That's when you start to get into socialism or communism. I mean I guarantee you I am the least smart person in this thread.  I'm just stating my opinion. Maybe I'm wrong and everyone should just make the same amount of money and everyone can be financially equal regardless of what they do.....

We're talking about speeding here. Not real crime. Don't get it twisted. 
I did not vote the US president nor am I with any party. However the USA left can't wait to emulate Europe.
Do you always blanket statements without thinking? Family with groceries? A struggling couple trying to make it to a job 45 miles away?  One solution does not suit all.
"I suppose if you tie it to politics there‚Äôs nothing I can say to sway your opinion. But do consider that it‚Äôs supposed to be a punishment to discourage the crime. If the fine is peanuts to you, you likely will continue and it‚Äôs as though there isn‚Äôt a fine at all which is a pretty big flaw in my opinion"
"Into socialism and communism? How brainwashed are you?

The point of fines is to stop someone from doing something illegal. If you are rich as fuck, you won't give a shit about a 300$ ticket, and keep speeding, while a poor family would get in debt because of that. "
[deleted]
I don't care. My point is the same.
"Speeding is a real crime, it is codified as a crime and DOES hurt people every day.  Speeding causes you to be unable to react quickly enough or brake quickly enough to avoid accidents and being penalized to stop that is the point of fines."
"How do you define ""real crime""?


Is murder, rape, armed robbery a ""real crime""?


Is tax fraud a ""real crime""?


Are (intended or not) red-light crossers bad people?"
">Family with groceries?

Bikes, public transport..

>A struggling couple trying to make it to a job 45 miles away?

Public transport"
"We're still taking about speeding right?  I really don't consider speeding a ""crime."""
No I hear you. I've honestly been re-thinking my stance a bit on this today. 
"Shit's fucked up in America right now. There's a lot of deviciveness and anger towards people that are different or have different opinions. It's very true. Kind of sad and I worry about where this country is heading culturally.

Going away are the days of create your own destiny. People seem to want everyone to get the same things regardless of education, training, experience, financial stability, etc etc.  Whoa I just went on a rant!  Sorry!"

You already know the answer. And I'm not a lawyer or lawmaker so I will choose to not go there. 
"Nice.

Doesn‚Äôt matter to me, the law, or the conversation in the slightest."
"Then you are talking about your considerations while everyone else is discussing a fine paid for committing a crime.  A fine should be a deterrent and a deterrent should be something you care about.  Jeff Bezos won't care about a $300 fine in the slightest.  He could pay 10 of those in a day without a second thought... meaning he has no reason to follow the law.


This is also very relevant for bailout in the US.  Half the population of the US would likely lose their jobs if they can't post bail... even if they are wrongfully accused."

But the trolls keep saying the semi doesn‚Äôt exist. 
"It just occurred to me that the semi will drive sales of Tesla's other cars.

&#x200B;

A big part of Tesla's success comes from proving that electric cars can be cool. The roadster showed that an EV can be fast, good looking, and fun to drive. The Model S proved that they could be practical and luxurious. The Model 3 aims to prove that they are affordable and attainable, and is on track to do so in time.  


The semi shows raw power and range in a way that no previous Tesla has. And while pickup fans are likely to be among the most obstinate opponents of Tesla, having a semi truck that can do long hauls with real loads will go a long way in creating an image of power and utility that pickup owners care about, even if they never actually haul anything.

&#x200B;

I hope the next iteration of heavy duty Tesla vehicles is a truck designed to tow other trucks. Seeing a broken down diesel semi propped up and towed behind a Tesla is a similar smackdown to what the roadster 2.0 promises in regards to speed."
$50 says that's just a repaint of one of the two existing chassis.

Whatever aero advantage they had with the truck is negated by that boxed trailer
"I personally think this is a new prototype, so there's at least 3 in existence. I'd guess they'd want more vehicles to get more miles out of the design to ensure it works, and to test new tech on a brand new chassis.

Am I right in thinking this is the smaller version of the two revealed? 
Is this the small version?
Its probably still in that spot... the 405 is a parking lot. 
Is it a California thing to not put the word Highway before the number of the highway? It‚Äôs either 405 or the 405. 
It‚Äôs at the Kettleman City supercharger right now. Wow. Amazing! Had a good conversation with the pilot and co pilot. 
What's the scoop on these anyway? They've kind of fallen out of the news
"Still not worth going on the 405, especially the LA county section"

Do the semis have autopilot?

After they've been around now for a year I don't like the design of it.
Had to zoom in to see if it was driver-less. Still not sure but I think I can make out a head.
They need to do a Optimus Prime color scheme
"Woah, that looks sleek. I wonder if certain companies will request specialized branding on their trucks, or if Tesla will just provide the two colors? Perhaps Tesla will supply the two colors, then the companies take them to body shops to get them branded?"

Do we know if this is the smaller semi or the larger one? I'm guessing smaller just because its shorter than the trailer.

"Are these company issued or do independent truckers buy them? Or both?

Why can‚Äôt they just paint it red?
"Although the lack of a ""the"" in front of 405 is suspect"
\+25 kw
Clearly it's not the performance package as there is no RGB in the cabin.
"Roaster with optional ‚ÄúSpaceX package‚Äù.

Semi with optional ‚ÄúWAAAGH! package‚Äù."
Needs more Dakka.
They totally need to paint checkers on it. Like rightnoooow
"/r/ThreeTimesFaster 
"
Isn‚Äôt that a thing in warhammer? Color red makes Orc tech faster?
Do we have any evidence that this is a Tesla?
The box said 10 kW.
"Could be faster, this is just matte red."
"Tesla‚Äôs manufacturer plate is 63277.  It‚Äôs on almost all of the prototype vehicles that I have seen. I presume they are using this on their new/repainted truck also.

"Mods, this seems like concrete evidence. Perhaps flair as ""Repainted""?"
"I think your right. Looks like it's just a wrap, not paint."
I am disappoint
Oh no it has model 3 door handles... truckers ain't gonna like that!
Is it possible they scrapped one for a newer build and reused the plate?
[Like this?](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tesla-semi-sunset.jpg)
"Those upper cowls can be added after the fact for traditional rigs, work truck had one installed after delivery to match our box on a fixed bed. 

Maybe it's a short haul rig, where it wouldnt usually see higher speeds/wind resistance? 

Either way, nice to see them in the wild!"
You're highly overestimating the speed one can go on the 405.
"Truck Driver here.

Doesn't matter if the trailer is loaded or unloaded, most modern, aerodynamically designed trucks you mainly see today are always flush with the roof and sides of the trailer to prevent air drag.

But city pickup trucks (daycabs) sometimes are not as aerodynamic because of their relative short operation radius.

Check out the Walmart concept truck, I would hope tesla leans more towards that design."
"Probably 90% of these will be local short haul trucks.  They might hit 55 for a couple minutes a day and most of the day at 35.   

Also even with this one of the spec sheets they put out puts the truck at 33k that‚Äôs heavy as hell for a road truck.  Much less a local truck.  (Local trucks are typically in the 12-15k range).  "
Maybe they want to test to range with having the extra drag from the trailer?
"Not every truck pulls a van trailer like that. There are tank trailers, flat beds, lowboys, and any number of additional variations that aren't as tall as your typical van trailer. Really anything that doesn't see many highway miles regularly would benefit too. Since the truck seems ideal for local or regional deliveries I'd wager that the shorter day cabs will be more popular anyways. "
"I wouldnt be surprised if Tesla got some extra low trailers for the route between the Gigglefactory and Freemont to go with the low truck. The batteries and drive components are extremely heavy, which means the weight limit will  be exceeded far before the volume limit. It would make sense to do the trip with a lower, lighter trailer that consumes less energy. After all they know they will be needing those trailers for many years in the future and for many many thousands of trips."
The short cab would also be more efficient for hauling a flat deck so it has it's purposes.
"The efficiency in the reveal was said to be less then 2 kWhs per mile for the Tesla Semi.   The assumption is that would be loaded.   But if you say that it is 2 kWhs per mile then that is 520 kWhs to get from the one factory to another.    If it charged at the Gigafactory in Nevada then the assumption would be that it would all be renewable electrical generation.   If it came totally from solar then IPCC estimates that it would produce 41 grams of CO2 per kWh.   This is taking into account the energy to build, maintain, etc.   So the drive from Giga to Fremont would emit 47 pounds of CO2.   The drive back is harder to guess and would depend on the source of the electricity.   If directly from the California grid and you estimate that on average it is producing 200 grams of CO2 then you would be at 229 pounds of CO2.   If charge from solar it would be another 47 pounds.   So 94 to 276 pounds of CO2 for the round trip.

A diesel semi fully loaded will range in efficiency.   But from what I can see online at 65 mph it will be somewhere around 5.5 and 8.5 MPG from the info I can find online.  If you assume an efficiency of 7 miles per gallon the round trip would need 74 gallons of fuel.   Diesel emits 22.4 pounds of CO2 per gallon when burned.   And then there is the CO2 to extract, transport and refine oil into gas.    Various estimates on this but you would be looking on the low end of at least another 4 pounds per gallon.    So that is 1954 pounds of CO2 for the round trip.    So the savings worst case per round trip would be 1678 pounds (761 kgs)"

Any backing to this theory? Genuine question.

"Never say Highway or Interstate here, Number is all you need. "
Not much to report on until customers start receiving them.

More important than full autopilot is whether they‚Äôll be allowed to do convoy mode without a driver in the meantime
"Tesla has already shown 3 colors now, they'll probably offer the same colors as every other car they paint and let companies brand their own vinyl graphics."
Companies have color schemes they require.  If they get trucks that aren‚Äôt their colors then they paint them.
The volume won't be nearly as high as the Model 3 and many of the preorders are large batches.  Painting custom colours would be pretty easy to do so that's what I expect will happen.
aerodynamics don't really factor in here because nothing actually goes anywhere on the 405
"Short haul version, it will spend more time at ~30 mph than 55mph so the bigger aero part isn't necessary.  Different markets in testing.  This one's rear aero doesn't reach the trailer either, the silver one is completely flush with it."
"In theory, the maintenance and fuel costs are going to be significantly lower than a traditional diesel rig. Fuel and maintenance costs are not small with big rigs, or even medium duty trucks. If the tesla semi provides cost savings over a say, 15 year lifespan even factoring in the slightly higher upfront cost, you sure bet there's gonna be large corporations buying them.

Trucking already has thin margins, so any edge you can gain is significant.

Independent truckers would buy them too, so long as the up front cost isn't too large. A calculated loan could pay off if the operating costs are low."
ü§• 
Seriously? Looks better than all of the other semi trucks I've seen. 
"Personally I think it looks a bit better when the trailer fits the cabin, like in the examples we saw at the unveil event."
Didn't have the wind diverter on it
"That's a standard height trailer. You won't find any shorter ones in that heighy, since cube space is the priority in box trailer design.

The only reason a company makes a trailer/truck box shorter is to fit into low-height loading bays, or for specialized companies that only ever carry one type of product that doesn't need the height (very rare)."
No. That's the concrete barrier. 
"They aren't deflated, they are just cut off from the concrete median wall."
Is that not a trick of the angle with the centre divider? 
The price of the paint options has no connection to the actual cost to produce them. Tesla is known for having insanely overpriced paint. There's certainly a hell of a lot of profit in a $2500 paint option.
">There were several versions of the silver we saw

I don't think so, as far as I'm aware there's only one of each; one silver, one black."
The black one is the same as the silver one. They just removed the top cover (called a cowl apparently). 
"Tesla‚Äôs manufacturer plate is 63277.  I presume they are using this on their new truck.

"The hood has a big T tesla logo, it's identical to the silver and black ones aside from color and missing long haul aero roofpiece, and it's been photographed supercharging."
All Tesla prototype plates are identical.
"I'm sure it's possible but I'm not sure why they would. Seem like less of a hassle to just get new plates for a new Semi.  That said, when I look at the trim pieces and the overall state of it, everything is so clean that it looks brand new.

"Ah yes exactly, I guess maybe one hasn't been made yet for this new one, or they're testing with and without? "
What a picture. It makes me want to swap my Roadster desktop.

How does diesel emit 22lbs of co2 per gallon when a gallon weighs about 8lbs? 
Thank you kind sir/madam.

But a lot more CO2 is emitted because you blaze it in the process.
"Lowered suspension, powder coated Performance wheels and brakes with some weird plastic inserts in the spokes, chrome delete, CF spoiler, Roadster style badging on the trunk lid, body-color door handles.

https://twitter.com/erdayastronaut/status/1029191484715589633?s=21"
"The Semi is absolutely completely possible for what he is claiming. 

Trucks burn about 400kw of fuel per hour (10gph and 6mph fully loaded to 80,000lbs) which only about 100kw makes it to the wheels. Combustion engines are extremely thermally wasteful. 

So in order to match that the Semi only has to have about 600kwh for a 360 mile range. But the Semi also has regenerative braking, which collects energy wasted braking on standard trucks. 

This means in the Mountains they get the same performance as standard truck in the city, as the energy wasted going up hills is recovered going back down the other side, cancelling out. 

The truck is absolutely completely possible.

"
Also an even bigger difference between prototype and practical product. Tesla Semis are a gimmick. 
Of course. How could I be so dumb? ;-)
"Medium trucks are also good because they do a lot of city driving, usually not a huge range, and are also home every night.  


Electric trucks are going to take some people by surprise, others might not even notice it happening, but the advantages are huge, if they can do a long haul semi and tow batteries and even cars across the country, they can do almost any trucking task."
That tweet doesn‚Äôt prove anything 
Could be a Christmas event or they could be testing some production lines.
To give the illusion that the program is developing more than it is
"I've seen articles on some of the skirtings they put on and how it improves their mileage but nothing exactly for the front end. 

I've seen some truckers add that cowling to the top of their cab to smooth out the transition"
"Not really, for example, [Here's one of the Model 3 prototypes from the unveil event](http://tesla3enthousiast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1531459220_maxresdefault.jpg)"
I just think it‚Äôs interesting. I‚Äôve always said either I-25 or Highway 34 for example while living in Colorado. But my wife is from riverside and she never says the prefix like I do. 
you absolute legend
"Technically yes.

But they aren‚Äôt going to be adopted by road companies because well their won‚Äôt be enough support for them for decades


Also

Weight.  The weight stats I‚Äôve seen on them has put the day cab (local driving ) truck at about 33k which is heavier than a typical truck with a sleeper.

So for a long tome the only companies, even local ones, that can afford to run them will be companies that don‚Äôt care about weight. 

Currently on a road truck companies don‚Äôt want heavy trucks.  It limits the money the truck is capable of making as many loads are within a few thousand pounds of being over weight 

Also since all this extra weight is at the tractor to keep the dot required weight distribution loads have to be loaded completely differently than what they would be loaded for a normal diesel.


Also every one of the reports I‚Äôve seen put the range at about 500 miles.  That is also a limiter for it being a road truck.  Time.  I can only be on the road for a specific amount of time.  I get paid by the mile I run so literally every mile I don‚Äôt run is money I‚Äôm not making.   With charge times and limited charging locations (even with for what would be a massive network for cars) that extra time would hurt companies.  Less traveled time means it takes more time to deliver and fewer loads a year.  Truck stops and rest areas will all have to be renovated for over the road use.  Because we sleep in the truck.  When I have to take a 34 hour break my truck by law can‚Äôt move.  And I‚Äôm stuck in that truck.  So every time my laptop needs a charge, every time the AC has to kick in.  That‚Äôs all charge that I‚Äôm going to need.  Literally on the road I live in the truck.  And currently around once a week to once every 3 weeks because of parking issues I sleep on an exit ramp or in a random parking lot because there isn‚Äôt enough places for me to park.  

These chargers are going to take up more space so their is going to be less parking.  For the reasons above we can‚Äôt pull in and out of parking spots for fueling on our breaks.  So the spots have to be capable to charge or you have to have tons of spaces for charging.  

Because if I‚Äôm on my 10 or 34 and I‚Äôm in a space I can‚Äôt move by law.  And if that‚Äôs when I needed a charge then either the truck is going to run out of juice and need a tow or it needs to be charged in place.   

That‚Äôs not even counting the people who run across places like Kansas, Texas and Nebraska on 2 lanes.  Some of those small companies have a truck that goes and gets 1,000 or 2,000 gallons of fuel as a mobile onsite station.  Sometimes these guys are out where they don‚Äôt have anything for extended periods.

This isn‚Äôt like a car where you charge at home and have supplemental charging on the road.

Now

I think companies like UPS and fedex could run them without a problem.  A friend of mine who does UPs rarely does over 400 miles in a 12 hour shift.  Where as I get yelled at if I don‚Äôt typically do 600-650 miles in a 10-11 hour shift because I‚Äôm not running my hours.  And they could give a shit about problems like traffic.

Ups and fedex already have tons of places where trucks nose in for over night.  They would have to have a few million in upgrades for charging but they would save tons.  My friend with ups.  They complain if he idles when he‚Äôs stuck in traffic.  That‚Äôs why if you see a ups truck in traffic you‚Äôll often hear them hit down and start again constantly.  And who cares if they are hot or cold.  But with this.  The electric would be much more cost efficient and comfortable drivers.  





One thing to add

Propane and natural gas is tons cheaper to run and is even lighter than diesel, and the trucks required less maintenance.  For a while stations had a pump for these.  But not enough large scale trucking companies would adopt them because of the logistical issues that added when trucks had to run in areas without fueling locations.  They had to route around them pay the drivers extra schedule in constant travel to fueling locations.. it was a hassle.  I know a few larger trucking companies with them that are parked.  JB hunt has one contract for Budweiser that demanded these trucks.  I know a guy who runs this account.  He ends up running about a 1/4 of his mileage looking for truck stops that have functional pumps.  

So larger companies that have gone through previous fads are going to be hesitant.  They will pledge buys but refuse.  They may buy some for local accounts but it‚Äôll be accounts that have very specific routes that have short ranges and they can guarantee charging at a home station. 





These home stations like fedex and such will not be available to an average driver.  So these charging locations can‚Äôt be even thought of as existing for anyone other than the company that built them.  The problem will be convincing companies like pilot with extremely limited space to convert some of their over night parking into charging bays... and that‚Äôs parking that some drivers will have to park in unsafe locations because those spots are lost and we are constantly loosing parking and very rarely getting new locations opening.

Thanks!!
looks like they are testing less aerodynamic designs i.e. trailer seems to be a bit higher here
"There are some Specialty vans that are 12‚Äô6 jasper engines run them for instance.  

But these aren‚Äôt the I‚Äôm going to have a trailer that does everything.  They have very specific freight they pull and that‚Äôs it."

There were two at the reveal though. A matte black and a silver one.

[That is incorrect. They have both XP24261 and XP24262.](https://i.imgur.com/uyqTbpI.jpg)
But that would give people more insight into how developments are coming along.
"there's 2 versions, one with the short cab (like the OP) and a tall cab"
https://youtu.be/5n9xafjynJA
">What you linked is a completely different version of the semi. Not what's pictured above with a aero cap.

That was the exact point I was making. OP wondered if there was a more aerodynamic way to shape the roof... I linked to the aerodynamic version Tesla already made.

Why would they put those fugly afterthought panels on the trailer, when they already have a super-aero option for the Semi?"
"The long haul aero configuration has the higher roof and the rear extends flush against the trailer (they're motorized to move when it turns).  This is the short haul configuration.  

That roof on the long haul just pops off, [we've seen it removed from the silver one already.](https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/8919f909deabfc50919f18e198c069bb/205730818/tesla-semi-truck-leak.jpg)"
"Actually local trucks would still need the same batteries as any other truck.  Short runs doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs always going to be near a terminal for charging.  It just means the truck is going to be back at the terminal after a 12 hour shift.  A truck without a 600 mile range even in a local position is going to have a hard sale as even trucks that typically do 200 mile days sometimes have 400 or more miles in one day.


"
"Tankers inherently have a good air flow design with the outer skin (shiny part), the internal storage container is actually about half the size of  the actual tanker trailer.

Flatbeds are just box van trailers without the box, they typically pull very heavy loads like rolled steel where the load isn't that tall, so some trucks maybe be set up with a ""midroof"" truck without the top fairing."
"It‚Äôs higher because it includes the oxygen that was included from the air, so you have a single carbon from  the fuel and 2 oxygens from the air to spit out a single co2.   But that is the weight of the co2 emitted "
I can‚Äôt say for sure as I‚Äôm not a chemist but the oxygen comes from the air while the carbon comes from the diesel so it is possible. A normal car emits 150+g/km which translates to more than the fuel as well. 
"The others answered the question and are correct.   CO2 tells you what happens in the reaction.   One carbon atom from the diesel/gas combines with 2 oxygen atoms in the air to create carbon dioxide.   So the 2 oxygen atoms add the additional weight.   This is why people completely underestimate the amount of CO2 produced from burning fossil fuels.    Regular diesel actually emits more CO2 then regular gasoline which is more like 20 pounds of CO2 per gallon.   So a gas car that is driven 13,000 miles a year and gets 30 MPG will use 433 gallons of gas and emit 10,392 pounds of CO2 accounting for the burning it and extraction/transportation/refining.   An Model 3 getting 4 miles per kWh will emit 1433 pounds of CO2 if charged from California's grid or 294 pounds of CO2 if charged from solar."

"Never said it's not possible. But setting up production takes time and money. There are many products that are possible, but took a long time to make it into production or never made it.

Tesla has a lot on their plate: $35k Model 3, S&X refresh, Model Y, Semi, Roadster, Model Z as well as expansion to China and even Europe at some point. And they can't do everything at once."
That's not how the transfer of energy works.
"SpaceX rockets are a gimmick. 
Teslas are a gimmick. 
Everything's a fucking gimmick! "
You think you're dumb?  I was at the reveal and didn't even notice them 'shopping two of them side by side right into my eyeballs in real time.  I'm such an idiot!
"So medium duty trucks are large pickups like an f350, f450 and an f550.  It maxes out at something along the lines of an f650 or a 2 ton truck.  These trucks have a dot gross vehicle weight max of 26,000.  

Your talking at the wrong person on this.  I‚Äôm a truck driver, my dad was a truck driver.  My uncles.. truck drivers... my mom for about 6 years when my dad got hurt... was a truck driver.   I know trucks.  

Anything you see  with a full van trailer and dot rated above 26,000 and under 80,000 lbs is a heavy duty truck.  These can still be local trucks.  There are also trucks that can do up to 200 tons and these heavy haul trucks can also be local or over the road.  (I‚Äôve got a video somewhere on my phone a friend sent me.  They had 14 trucks to get a load up over a mountain on I-80 (donnors).  That‚Äôs how heavy, heavy haul can get.

And it‚Äôll be several decades before they are able to do actual over the road things because of charger support networks.  Truck chargers will be a completely different matter.  

I‚Äôll use propane and natural gas as examples.  

They are better for the environment, cost less to operate, reduce maintenance costs.  It‚Äôs cheaper all around for a trucking company to use them.  But trucking companies don‚Äôt.  Because their isn‚Äôt a large enough network of refueling stations to support them. 

Local trucks it‚Äôs not uncommon to see them with an alternative fuel source.  Because they can return to a home station.    


With an over the road truck about 1once a week to once a month I‚Äôm stuck sitting in a parking lot or some other random place because there isn‚Äôt truck parking available.  With an electric truck once it runs down it‚Äôs down.  The shortest range of a road truck needs to be around 900-1,200 miles.   Anything less than that and companies are going to have to constantly pay drivers to drive out of their route and delay load deliveries to get the trucks to a charging location.  

Also remember how I said I had to park somewhere unsafe regularly because there wasn‚Äôt enough parking.  Well if you convert say 14 spots to electric thats even less and your going to have more drivers forced to park unsafe.  Ans those 14 spots.  If I drive an electric truck and have to take a mandatory break of 10 hours or 34 hours.  I live in the truck and can‚Äôt move it.  So it‚Äôs going to be sitting at the charger for 10-34 hours very regularly.  And by law while on break I can‚Äôt move the truck.  The truck had monitors even the normal trucks on the road now.  Where they know if I move the truck even a few feet.


Now fed ex, ups and similar companies have tons of distribution centers.  They are your best bet as early adopters.  Them and the tow truck drivers.  They have routes between distribution centers and it‚Äôs nothing for them to pull into one charge up and continue on even if it‚Äôs an over the road truck.  But a non company driver won‚Äôt be able to use those slots.  

Then as their life cycle for big companies end smaller companies will pick them up and install a charger at their terminal.

To get it wide spread as a national network your going to need to add around 10,000 parking spaces across the nation.  And around 100,000 to 500,000 charging stations.

Out of these around 1/4 will be damaged and require full rebuilding at any given time.  I use truck fuel pumps and how often trucks back into or pull into other trucks at truck stops as how I‚Äôm gauging this.  

People say oh these big companies they put in massive orders for the Tesla truck.

These same companies also put in orders for propane, natural gas, hydrogen and anything else that comes along then cancel the orders before they get finalized.  I‚Äôve seen it all the way back into the 80s with disc breaks, and tons of other features.

Anything that makes it harder on the companies to run the truck literally anywhere they need it to go.  (Lack of chargers) makes them go.  This truck will constantly need specialized planning and routing to keep it running.  This other truck we can just put a load on him.  And he can run how ever he needs to to make the delivery.    We are getting the truck that puts the least amount of stress on management.  

That whole least amount of stress goes for everything.  To save fuel costs companies are like I don‚Äôt care how uncomfortable you are in the truck you can roll a window down and buy a fan.  Your not idling the truck so you can have AC.  And no we aren‚Äôt adding a device for 10k that has shown to save 12-15k a year in fuel savings and increase driver comfort.  (Although Apus are becoming more common now as companies that don‚Äôt have them have more driver turn over than companies that do have them.  APU can be a small generator or battery system that allows a driver to have some comfort without the main engine going.)

It has the same license plate number as the matte black truck.
"They're letting customers drive them, that gives more than enough impression.  The only people worried about this are financially invested in the short thesis that there is no semi."
"The Semi prototypes wouldn't be legal in Europe because the semi+trailer would exceed allowed length. Tesla is going to build one Semi for the worldwide market. Hence it needs to be shorter, they've already confirmed that."

"There's two versions of the semi, one has a taller fairing. I'm guessing this one is the cheaper short range version where aerodynamics doesn't matter as much.

Why would they sell one without the aerodynamic thing? 
"My understanding is that there is only one cab size. The difference is whether a cowl/fairing has been added on top, thats what makes it appear there is a taller size."
"And the box trailers are all the same height and width. 13'6"" tall and 102"" wide. That's the DOT restrictions without oversize permits so that's what they all are so they can carry as much as possible. No need for custom aero, jut properly designed aero. The industry is still experimenting with aero and doing things like under trailer skirts and vortex generators and huge flaps that reduce drag on the rear.  I think Tesla has a lot of good ideas to bring on the aero front. They build some slippery cars.

"\> they can't do everything at once.

Who is ""they"" and what is ""everything"".  You mean they can't manage multiple products, with multiple teams, at multiple points of development, like other manufacturers have to?  Especially when that expansion is improving or copying existing processes (Cell, motor production, or China), reusing components (Semi) or even the whole platform (Y on 3).  Most of those models are spread across different stages of development (conceptual designs, early prototypes, production engineering), requiring different staff, and likely growing specialized team by product segment (luxury, auto, semi, light trucks).  China is purportedly being financed separately, and with Model 3 production their finances have \[hopefully\] stabilized again.  There is potentially a bottleneck in having enough experienced production engineers to expand and build production lines, but after 5 vehicles, multiple product lines, and 3 factories, they probably have a solid team that can handle rolling improvements/growth and leading/consulting to newer engineers.

"By Model Z do you mean the Tesla pickup truck? I could only find one article from just-auto.com that ever mentioned a Tesla Model Z and they didn't have any source as far as I could find.

Also, what do you mean ""they can't do everything"". Yes, a car company can bring multiple products to market in the range of a few years. They will overlap on the development. You're using a comparison to the human mind (the fact that we can't multitask) to try to explain why a _company_ can't do multiple products. That doesn't make any sense."

I can't comment on rockets but I'd say I'm pretty well qualified to comment on semis. 
"People continually overestimate the difficulty of charging infrastructure. Electricity has a very robust distribution network already, it costs a couple hundred dollars for a slow charging station. They could exist in every safe truck parking spot. We need more parking for trucks (or fewer trucks) either way, but adding electricity to most of them isn't an insurmountable challenge.

&#x200B;

Fast charging costs a bit more, but nowhere near as much as a gas station.

&#x200B;

Once the cost savings reach a critical point, the change will come quickly. Charging stations will go up quickly where needed, and sales of new ICE trucks will drop while electric trucks will surge and take over the market.

&#x200B;

The trucking industry isn't the most forward thinking, but they do like money, so it will happen once the value becomes obvious and there is real world evidence of it in action. Tesla is building the truck, and they have uses for them even if orders get cancelled. Electric trucks are coming, and there will two kinds of trucking operations, the ones that realized it and prepared appropriately, and the ones that are out of business because their costs are too high."
"It's probably the same truck wrapped, but that's not a great way to point it out.

"Making the Semi shorter in length would be a huge change, why would the prototypes be so far from the actual design? "
Man I just looked that up and that nose is rough... I‚Äôm so glad they changed it.
"The X was prototyped with the 2012 S fake grill.  They didn't let us know about the refreshed nose until it was released, and even after that they told us the fake grill was an S thing and the smooth front was an X thing.  They never tell people what's changing until they're selling it."

"The shorter ones probably aren‚Äôt for traditional trailers, but for flatbeds or liquid tankers. If the aerodynamics are wacky anyways, you might as well make the cab weigh less."
Those aero skirts if not properly developed will have savings with one truck and increase in another truck.  My company has a few of these that I hate pulling.  I can see my mileage dropping.

"Charging stations take space at a truck stop.  And spaces currently barely have space for a truck to back in.

They are going to have to expand a space by at least 2 foot for the charging station.  If spots take up more space that means that their is less space available.

And currently in a truck stop if they have a 110 plug.  They charge $40 to use it for the night in most places.  Charging a truck they will at least double or triple it.



And you are completely over estimating how much they will actually save just like Tesla is.

Yes the truck costs less to operate.  But those figures are nearly the same savings that propane and natural gas have.  And large scale trucking companies wouldn‚Äôt adopt them because there aren‚Äôt enough fueling locations for those types of fuel.

I‚Äôve spent weeks driving around in the middle of no where.  Only popping my head out long enough to fuel.  No truck stops in sight.  I parked in old parking lots the whole tome.

Currently I still have to do that at least one night a week.  


Also you say it‚Äôs going to save money.


The last statistic I saw put the charge time at 30 minutes for 80% and 1 hour  for a full charge.  It‚Äôs got a 500-600 mile range 

So Best case I charge all night.  Head out have to charge mid day.  Then charge again all night.

If I don‚Äôt have a truck stop with a space I‚Äôm going to have to immediately find one when I start my clock.  Then sometimes mid day I‚Äôm going need another.  Then hope that there is one close to where ever I park that night.  

This takes extra time.  Often my loads are planned with next to no spare time.  So companies are going to have to take less loads over the course of the year to account for the added down time from charging let‚Äôs say it comes out to one less load a month and 12 less loads a year.  Per truck.  In a 2500 truck fleet.  That‚Äôs a shit ton of lost revenue.   (Also Tesla local trucks weight like 33k which is about 20k more than your average local truck.  Add a sleeper and driver gear your looking at a road truck that weights about 45k limiting the loads the truck can handle.  We have max weights by tire and over all)

Also drivers I only make money while I‚Äôm driving.  I don‚Äôt make money while I‚Äôm stopped.  Stuck in traffic I‚Äôm literally loosing money.  Add in 2 hours a day additional time for charging and I‚Äôm working 14 hour days.  Getting paid for less miles driven and have tons extra added stress.  Because I‚Äôm up and alert for 14 hours rather than 10-12 a day.   So companies will have drivers going to fleets that they get more miles so they can make more money.  Those natural gas trucks I talked about they end up making hourly (and paying more than a normal driver would make) or around 20¬¢ more a mile than normal driver because the added hassle to drive one.  (It takes about 30 minutes to fuel one and stations are a pain in the ass).  So the company is going to be out more money for drivers OR they will be hiring drivers drivers stay around for a month and go somewhere else and bad mouth the hell out of the company and Tesla trucks about how much money they cost the driver.



This is how companies look at these.  The company I drive for has around 100 natural gas trucks that are sitting because every time they hire a driver they plan on putting him in one.  He tells them he wants a conventional engine or he‚Äôs going somewhere else.

100 trucks at 80k that no one wants to drive.  They tried selling them on the secondary market.  With less than 1,000 miles on most of them no one wants to buy them.  So they sit in a lot.  First they stripped the tires off them and now they pull random parts that are interchangeable just so they can get some value.  As a truck gets stripped of useful parts the plan is to crush them.

Natural gas and propane had on paper THOUSANDS of locations to fuel up.  Then the reality hit that most places wouldn‚Äôt allow the trucks to fuel up in those locations because the fuel on hand had been ear marked for customers. But that was part of the sales pitch that companies were given.  Some bit others didn‚Äôt.  Some grabbed a few trucks just to test the waters.  JB hunt has Budweiser contract that requires them.  (Where my buddy works) I think it‚Äôs 20 natural gas trucks around St. Louis and companies that deliver propane and natural gas typically have them.  That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve seen in the last 3 years.  

And in around 2000 this was going to be the next big thing that blew Diesel engines out of the water.  They had found some new tech that made them tons more efficient.  Companies didn‚Äôt care.  Harder to route, harder to find drivers for them.  To much hassle for office folk. 

That‚Äôs why I said target the very specific companies I said.  Those companies don‚Äôt worry about weight and have very short runs or tons of locations they own all
Over the country.  That means charging is a lot less of an issue for them.  These companies also haul ultra light loads.  That means that the added weight to the trucks doesn‚Äôt really mean a lot to them.  


Fed ex, UPS and similar should be the initial targets for them.  


When Tesla did it‚Äôs first car they did a roadster to show they could be fast.  Then did a luxury sedan to prove they were worthwhile to the wealthy.  The people who could afford those early adoption cost and hassles.  Now that a network is up they are moving into more budget conscious people.  Because they now have a proven track record.  BUT if your around Kentucky your not going to find a super charger typically within an hour of you unless you live in Louisville and then it depends on where in Louisville you live.  

They keep planning more but the state keeps putting limits on how they can be because it‚Äôs going to further stress out already stressed electrical grid.  Or at least that‚Äôs the story they are putting out.  Because of this the only people you see with a Tesla in Kentucky is going to be somewhere like Louisville or someone who drives 50-100 miles a day and charges at home.  This is the nation for truck drivers at this point.  Except there are 0 chargers for trucks other than at Tesla locations.  Tesla is not able to sell their cars everywhere because they don‚Äôt have enough charging locations.  Many trucking companies are headquartered in these types of areas.  ‚ÄúOh you have a bad impression of the ability to drive our cars. Well this truck that has even less charging areas this is the way to go.‚Äù  Your telling this to old men who in general already perceive Tesla cars as snake oil sales men.

UPS and Fedex. They are headquartered in major metropolitan areas with tons of chargers and probably know many people who own Tesla‚Äôs.

Start small and expand target locations that charger shortage isn‚Äôt an issue.

"Negative. The trailer stacked digits/letter are different in all the photos. The manufacturer plate number is the same, but the stacked characters differentiate the registrations for different vehicles. "

"Shit, you're right, sorry about that."
"Interesting, but all of that stuff [isn't in place yet](https://www.euractiv.com/section/transport/news/eu-truck-safety-and-efficiency-law-faces-delay-until-2019/). It will be by the time the semi is actually available. 

All we know is the final design will be modified to fit global markets and incorporate improvements. I was assuming that was in relation to total length but maybe it's related to other things only then, and thus there might not be any difference visible on the outside."
"You'll have to ask Tesla üôÇ

I think their main goal was to target the US market first and foremost and have a design that worked and could prove an electric class 8 Semi is possible and even better than a fossil fuel one.

Note that it's possible they don't have to change it after all or just in very minor ways, as you can see in posts below. So my assumption that you would be able to spot the differences easily is incorrect."

Based on Tesla's track record? They have no track record building semis. Literally zero track record to go on when it comes to semis. "
"You keep comparing electric to propane or natural gas, which is a mistake. Natural gas and propane has less refueling infrastructure than gas or diesel. Electricity has more infrastructure.

You are one of the people who will be surprised by electric trucks taking over. Tesla is already building a long haul capable semi, and they are going to use it. The first real adopters will probably be UPS and FedEx, and other similar companies, and also companies that do shorter regular trips like from a warehouse on one side of town to several stores in the area. But Tesla doesn't start small, Elon Musk doesn't start small. Elon Musk aims for Mars, lands rockets on barges, and wants to transform entire industries. 

Elon believes the best propulsion system for a car is electric, and the point of the roadster was to prove that, show that electric cars can be fast and cool. Elon also believes that the best propulsion system for a truck is electric, and to do that he is building a truck that can do long hauls, and he isn't afraid to build superchargers either.

Maybe you are right and existing trucking companies are too stubborn to invest in cost savings. That won't stop the change to electric trucks, they'll just go out of business and someone else will take over. Tesla already bought some trucking companies to enable more deliveries of Model 3. Disruption is coming to trucks, you can be in denial all you want, but it is coming."

"Electricity is in more places but the high voltage chargers the trucks requires isn‚Äôt.

Musk even talked about how they had to upgrade the electrical infrastructure of one of their locations to support the charger.




At what point did I say it wasn‚Äôt going to happen.  I said it will take a couple decades to get enough support.  Do you have a reading comprehension issue. 


I said they need to focus on local carriers to start the infrastructure.  And no.  Most of the major carriers aren‚Äôt going to randomly go out of business.  These are companies that have decades long contracts into the future.  They are guaranteed this freight if their trucks can support it and they have those trucks.  

This is actually an issue that has been going on for decades already.  In the 80s there were tons of owner operators.  Like 75% if loads where moved by trucks that were owned by individuals or companies with less than 20 owned trucks.  Now less than 1% of freight is moved by owner operators.

Here‚Äôs the thing.

How long have you been around trucking?  Because in previous posts you didn‚Äôt even know what a medium duty truck is.  I‚Äôve been around it for close to 40 years.  Every time there has been a major shift in trucking it hasn‚Äôt come about easily.  And typically it comes through government mandates.  

I think we‚Äôll see local freight being commonly moved by electric trucks in around 5-8 years.

Long haul will start the shift in around 15.  (There will be some early adopters like fed ex and UPS but not many long haul companies will take the chance until it is shown with hard facts and the ranges and reliability is shown over a lot of time.) 

We‚Äôll start having trucks with automation in them at around 12.  At about 20-25 years I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll have truck drivers as we currently do.  I think most freight will be moved with massive road trains of automated trucks.  Scale houses at state borders will have trucks pull in be checked as they currently are and they will have charging stations that the state bills to the respective companies.  
"
Exactly.
I think someone who drives trucks for a living is more qualified than someone who doesn't to comment on the future of their industry. You said he isn't qualified because he hasn't driven one. Substantiate your claim that he isn't qualified. Almost nobody has driven one. That guy is the closest you're going to get to an expert in this thread.
"I currently drive a Frieghliner Cascadia. 

They released specs, pictures, videos, and had a big press conference. Two major issues I find with just that. 

One is they say it has a 300-mile range. Is that loaded, empty, or bobtailed? They don't specify. If that's a 300-mile range empty or bobtailed that's is a very serious problem. Perhaps that's why they didn't say?

Secondly, the driver sits in the middle? When I first heard that I seriously thought it was a joke. That was clearly a decision made by a desk jocky with no practical experience. Now instead of one blind side you have two! "
"You think that your knowledge of a technical distinction that isn't really meaningful makes you right.

Your argument is inconsistent with itself, you complain that trucking companies will inconvenience drivers to save fuel costs, then claim they won't force them to use electric trucks because it is inconvenient to charge.

Tesla really shouldn't follow your advice. For most trucking, the problem is already solved, it is just a matter of building the trucks and installing overnight charging at warehouses. Batteries are good enough, charging is fast enough, and the grid is already in place.

The one challenge is long haul trucking, that is what they should focus their efforts on. If their first attempt isn't good enough, they will still be able to take over all the shorter routes. FedEx and UPS and many others are going to be buying electric trucks as quickly as the batteries for them can be produced, whether or not Tesla builds something that satisfies the long haul market. For Tesla to have an advantage, they need to be starting on long haul trucks now, if they don't innovate there, they'll be crushed by other truck manufacturers like Mercedes.

If the goal is to replace all ground transportation with electric vehicles, long-haul trucking is the hardest thing to do, and it is the one of the only things we might still have trouble with. Short trips are solved, for personal cars the only thing left is improving the price and scaling up production. Tesla did not disrupt the car industry by running away from hard problems. Tesla is where it is because they chose tasks that nobody thought could be achieved. Today, you're the nobody who thinks they can't do it."
"My substantiation is that he very clearly doesn't know the specs of it, makes no attempt to learn anything about it, and is making a wild assumption before understanding anything about it. 

He can claim to be an expert of his field, but when confronted with a change to the industry, he dismisses it outright even in the face of statistics clearly going against what he says."

Yeah, they definitely didn't ask any trucker anywhere if that was ok, or compensate for blind spots. Holy shit bud. Leave R&D to people who know wtf they're doing. Just stop making assumptions until a production one is out. Until then, literally everything you say is bullshit.

"They actually said there are two versions.   One has a 300 mile range.  The other is 500 miles.   They said the efficiency was under 2 kWhs per mile.  The assumption is that this would be loaded.   There is no reason to state the empty range as what people want to know is the loaded range.  Everything else they talked about during the reveal was the loaded specs.    For example they stated what speed it could do up a grade fully loaded and the 0 to 60 times fully loaded.    Earlier this year Musk said that they were optimistic about actually beating the specs stated in the reveal.   Here is a breakdown of what we know by people that know more then me.

With teala he started with a proof of concept buzz worthy car.  Then moved into the luxury market, Luxury SUV. Then into mid range.  His next goal is a luxury pick up.  Then an economy car that costs less than 20k.

He's never went for stupid level goals first.

And I pointed out 2 issues that over the road will have.  1. Corporate not wanting to hassle themselves because they've seen similar products and without the infrastructure, it costs them more money to run.  2.

He didn't even have a fuel injected vehicle until close like 2002.  

They passed laws concerning def filters.  Companies are risking multimillion-dollar fines by bypassing them because they don't trust the technology.  

And at no point did I say they couldn't do it.  You do have a reading comprehension issue, don't you?  I noted that the fanboys are silly and this isn't an overnight process.  Things like tow trucks and short-range vehicles are the way to go to prove to the old-fashioned drivers that it's a viable product.  Just like he used small steps to show his other items were sustainable.

You must take into consideration the weight of the rig and how much weight it can carry those numbers will dictate the success, for example, I drive in Europe and a normal semi can carry a total of 40t on most countries, my rig weights around 15t with full tanks that allow for a 2 driver crew to drive around 1400kms in a 19 hour shift including a 45m rest (for both) carrying 25t of cargo. 
The tesla semi must at least match these numbers to be competitive, because the industry doesn't care about if is electric or not, they just care that if the truck loads today in 2 days will be there to unload and load again because of the shortage of truck drivers everywhere. 

And yes the driver on the center is just plain wrong why make it difficult to maneuver to both sides, this is not a sports car. 



"
"It won‚Äôt work for one big glaring reason and I‚Äôm serious about this. Human beings want to roll the fucking window down and hang there arm out, not sit encased in the center of a glass and steel shell"
"First off I'm not dowvoting you. 

Secondly I didn't say blind spot. I said blind side. It's a type of docking that needs to be avoided as much as possible. You can't really compensate for it by nature of it being a blind spot. 

Thirdly, I guess based on your sarcasm and ""shut up and dribble"" talk you're not interested in any real discussion. You're just trying to stiffle dissent. You're just being an ass for the sake of being an ass. 

Lastly, I don't need to wait on a final product. I am giving my input as a truck driver on the quality of the Tesla Semi. Let me ask you this because these are all considerations companies consider when purchasing new equipment, how does one pre-trip a Tesla Semi? How does one make quick roadside repairs? Downtime is a very VERY bad thing is trucking. It can't be overstated enough how bad downtime is in trucking. I'm not seeing an easy way to do repairs in the photos and videos I've seen. How does one charge it when under a load? Is Tesla going to invest in the infrastructure to put Tesla Superchargers at every place trucks go? That would be an astronomical investment that they couldn't afford. What's the idle performance like? Can it be idled and still keep the driver comfortable? What type of terrain does the 300-mile range go by? Is it flat or mountainous? How quickly can they be charged if it runs out of charge on the highway? 

If I was an O/O I'd run as far away from this thing as I possibly can. "
"Again you mistake the knowledge of the way things are now for the way things will be in the future.

Trucks don't pop out of existence when they aren't in use, they do park somewhere. Any truck that parks in a consistent location can easily have charging added. Trucks that don't park in a consistent location are more difficult, but far from impossible.

They don't have technical hurdles. Economic hurdles and logistic hurdles, sure, but not technical hurdles. It isn't hat hard to put more batteries in, it reduces the maximum payload weight, but that is an economic and logistic problem, not a technical problem.

Another point you are missing is that Tesla has a need for trucks. If the orders are cancelled, they aren't left with trucks nobody wants, they are left with trucks that Tesla wants.

You keep saying how stubborn the trucking industry is. Will long haul truckers be convinced that EVs will work for them when the only electric trucks are short range ones?

You haven't said that they can't do electric trucks, but you are wrong about how they should go about it. Your same logic would have told them to build a plug in hybrid for the model S, and you probably would have thought of a Fisker as a Tesla killer. By your thinking, since the only people buying EVs in the early 2000s were hardcore environmentalists, so any new EV should look weird, act as a signal of green consciousness, and only needed a range of 80 miles.

Starting with small scale on a hard problem is different from starting with large scale on an easy problem. You are suggesting the latter, which is the exact opposite of what has brought Tesla the success it has seen."
"> it may work on local deliveries to supermarkets and retail stores but more than that and the diesel truck still wins. 

I was wondering how accurate the claim was that ""80% of trucking routes are less than 250 miles."" That was from the reveal event. Any insight into this?

> You must take into consideration the weight of the rig and how much  weight it can carry those numbers will dictate the success, for example,  I drive in Europe and a normal semi can carry a total of 40t on most  countries, my rig weights around 15t with full tanks that allow for a 2  driver crew to drive around 1400kms in a 19 hour shift including a 45m  rest (for both) carrying 25t of cargo. 

I agree with this. I think they mentioned GTW when talking about the 300/600 mile range, so that might give an estimation on the totals? Either way, this is the way the semi should be talked about. Rather than writing it off immediately as a gimmick when too much is unknown.

&#x200B;"
">First off I'm not dowvoting you.

lol suuure you aren't.... Amazingly they stopped after I called you out. You really aren't fooling anyone with that petty shit.

>Thirdly, I guess based on your sarcasm and ""shut up and dribble"" talk  you're not interested in any real discussion. You're just trying to  stiffle dissent.

Nope, just pointing out that you are completely clueless, having exactly 0 information about the product to write it off as a ""gimmick.""

>I'm not seeing an easy way to do repairs in the photos and videos I've seen.

Wow, it's almost like someone has been telling you to wait for information before writing it off as a gimmick.. Fuckin weird, right?

>Is Tesla going to invest in the infrastructure to put Tesla Superchargers at every place trucks go?

Have you seen their growth so far? lol

>What's the idle performance like?

Probably just like the other models. People are camping in Model 3s, but yeah, probably no clue that truckers need to sleep in their vehicles... Definitely...

>What type of terrain does the 300-mile range go by? Is it flat or  mountainous? How quickly can they be charged if it runs out of charge on  the highway?

You really didn't watch that unveil very carefully.

>If I was an O/O I'd run as far away from this thing as I possibly can.

Luckily, you aren't in charge of any major decisions and only drive the trucks.

&#x200B;"
"Sorry, but I still don't know how to make quotes here on reddit. 

I think those 80% is a country or state study. For example in Spain is way more than 250miles. (I know that he will start with USA but I talk from what I know) 

That is exactly why I think they are pushing the proof of concept for the short routes while the technology matures, that and hauling companies on those short routes mostly earn by contract to keep the delivery route flowing. The long haul companies get paid by weight or by miles and having the truck load less or parked charging means less profit. 

They could use a study did here in Europe where a trailer was equipped with solar panels and drove around for a year I think, to measure how much electricity would generate, it would help to charge the one pulling it for example. 
"
"You clearly have no clue what you're talking about and it would be futile to attempt further discussion with you. You're just being an ass while I'm trying to have an honest, polite discussion where you give your opinion on the semi and I give my opinion without the wild personal accusations and the snark. Let the adults do the talking for once kid. 

An O/O is an Owner Operator. They are literally the company owner, driver, and truck owner all in one. Based on what I'm hearing you say, you're completely unqualified to offer an opinion on trucking and trucking equipment. Have a good night. "
I think even just switching the short route trucks to EV would cut costs pretty dramatically (in the US at least) while the tech matures. Still could be a net positive for both Tesla and trucking companies. 
"> while I'm trying to have an honest, polite discussion 

""Telsa semis are gimmicks, i know this cuz i drive diesel trucks."" is a reeeal polite and honest discussion. lmao.

> Let the adults do the talking for omce kid. 

The ""adults"" are wildly speculating, and have 0 knowledge to EVs at all. Meanwhile, the ""kid"" in your scenario actually has an EV, and apparently can interpret information presented in a video, as it appears the ""adults"" can't. I'll listen to an intelligent kid over moron adults, thanks.

> An O/O is an Owner Operator. 

O/O is a MIL term as well. And it doesn't mean owner/operator. But setting that aside, you very clearly aren't an owner/operator either.

>  Based on what I'm hearing you say, you're completely unqualified to offer an opinion on trucking and trucking equipment. 

Yo, same. What a coincidence.

> Have a good night. 

Stay warm.

&#x200B;"
"Yes I completely agree. Just the maintenance of a diesel truck is off the charts compared to one electric. There they have another advantage because a broke down truck means you have to pay for the fix and is not earning double loss, and truck the is parked for maintenance is also not earning, from what I see with the teslas this is a big plus for the Elon team. "
I hate both of you. 
I appreciate you regardless.
"Damn the fact nobody died in that is incredible

Not many people survive being t-boned at 100 mph "
So Tesla makes electric tanks?
"May they have a speedy recovery

I'm pretty sure you just did though. Glad everyone survived. Velocity is a killer. "

Hope that guy is thrown in jail for a long time 
Alls I need is 150k to get my dream Tesla. Literally my only reason for wanting a Tesla years ago was because of the safety of the vehicle. I've been in a few accidents one of which was my fault. I'm a a paranoid driver now and have even been on meds because my driving anxiety crippled me for months. I'm improving with time and meds but damnit I sure do miss the freedom of road trips.
"That's great that the driver survived. But please, let's not pretend that they wouldn't have survived if they we're in an ICE. That argument is silly.  
  
Commence with the down vote from the fanboys."
A crash of this exact nature happened near my house this summer and it literally ripped the t-boned car in half and the occupants did not survive. The front half of the car was a hundred feet or so from the back half. This car no doubt saved their lives. 
The roof and doors appear to have been removed by firefighters during the extrication process. It is nonetheless remarkable that everyone in the Tesla survived. 
Thrown a quarter of a mile sounds impossible.

"Am I stupid and really confused? First paragraph says only a broken collarbone, 2nd paragraph says 9 broken ribs, plus a lot of other stuff? 

Facebook whyyyyyyy"
"ICE car = internal combustion engine car, in other words, a non-electric vehicle"
"Yeah, but what if the car that hit her was a Model 3 in Insane Mode? Still safe then?"
Did that guy get busted for attempted manslaughter? No way he should get a reckless endangerment charge.
"How exactly are Tesla‚Äôs safer than ICE cars, apart from obvious fuel leaks etc?
Isn‚Äôt the actual construction of the car similar to ICE cars, so that person in a comparable class Mercedes or Volvo or something would have the same net result?"
"great news, but please stop thinking you was ""blessed"". by that logic, the same god sent the other driver into you in the first place. there is no god. but there is science, and that is what saved you."
"Red light runner should be charged thrice with aggrevated assault, ridiculous!"
"You know what gets me? It's that most of us can't buy this type of safety. I'd love to have a Tesla, but I definitely can't afford one."
"Can y'all stop acting like Teslas are the only safe cars that exist? Yes, they are very safe, no doubt about that, but acting like all ICE cars are unsafe in comparison is stupid."
"I don't get it... She says they ""swerved to avoid him"" and then later says the last thing she remembers is sitting at the red light. What am I missing?"
quarter mile away my ass
"Just imagine breaking your pelvis because someone hit you, enormous amount of energy all over the place "
If this were the other way around the media would be all over this 
sounds and looks like the car didnt actually do so well. though i guess most cars don't have great side impact.... wait just realised 100 mph not kmph... what do you expect at that point.
Was anyone else disturbed by the ringtone volume in the screenshot? Like a hair on your phone you cant get rid of
Car stopped a quarter mile from impact? That's too damn far. 
"Honest question: I'm a big fan of all cars, eletric or ICE. However I'm also not crazy in the loop with this sub or this ""tesla culture"", Why does she say she would have been worse in an ICE car? It just seems kinda out of place and a little grand standish, is this a popular oppinion with electric car enthusiats? "
I work with this lady! 
Tesla gets a lot of shit but god damn their safety is incomparable
This is why I always look at the cross streets even with a green light. Only takes one fuckhead to put a crimp in your life.
"I'm glad everyone came out alive. This has me wondering how many people have died in a Tesla and obviously can't post something like this.

 (Not hate, love the company and what it stands for, just genuinely curious.)"
"Oh fuck off, ye teslas are really nice and high on the safety shit but theres way safer ice cars"
"So, uh, what happened to the guy going 100? He ok?"
"Flashback to when Elon was describing how they anti-game the side impact tests.

I hope those empoyees see this and know they saved a life."
"Please pardon my ignorance, but what's an ICE car?"
"That kind of douchebag is the type of person on my list of people who should be removed from at least the gene pool, if not existence. There is no possible explanation that can excuse that kind of speed coming toward an intersection.

inb4 a certain redditor starts complaining about me again."
That failed attempt at screenshot tho
ICE car.... cringe 
Fuck anyone who drives that recklessly. I'm glad they're all ok!!!
"There is so little damage here it is honestly amazing. When I got t-boned (driver side) while crossing a light at an intersection there was a lot more apparent damage than this, and it was at a significantly lower speed, they were going around 50ish mph. The paramedics were surprised that my left leg and hip wasn't injured other than a few bruises. 

Other than a bunch of glass being launched into my neck by the airbag and leaving some scars I'm fine now.

Had they been going much faster the outcome would have been drastically different.

(Somehow and I can't remember doing this but I was able to pull myself out of the car afterward)"
"I hear so many great things about Tesla, but unfortunately I doubt many people could afford them, such as myself. Is there plans for a Tesla for your average me?"

You know you‚Äôre American when reading this gives you anxiety about what the hospital bill would be like for something like this. 
Damnnnnnn !!!!
Wow
Do get it. Sounds like pretty severe injuries...

Don't ve silly. Tanks are ICE 
Did the other driver survive? 
 But Saab? What about Saab? They dont make cars anymore but still?
Elon = The man
Volvo
The fucks an Ice car
"I feel that with my Tesla I have higher chances of getting t-boned at a crossing after a red light because it is so damn tempting to fly off as soon as you get a green light. I tried to remind myself of that, but I fail 95% of the time."

"My co worker was recently in a simialr wreck. Going to lunch was hit by a drunk driver going 90+mph on a 45 mph street. Tore his car into two pieces, flung him and his seat 15+ feet away from the accident. Sadly, he did not make it. 

He was driving a old honda civic from the 90s. Wonder if things would have turned out differently if was driving a newer vehicle.

"
Does Tesla seek out these vehicles at all after they are involved in accidents? I'm very surprised this didn't result in a fire. I know it runs on batteries but it still seems like a high risk scenario.
lol you hit the volume button before the power button when you made the screenshot
what happened to the guy that hit you?

Unbelievable. There isn‚Äôt even a car left after that hit. Amazing they‚Äôre alive. 
Incredible. In very few cars can you survive being T-Boned at 100+ mph. Thank god for that Tesla and keeping them safe. 
that‚Äôs fucking gnarly 
That's a really nasty crash. The fucking retard who caused all these injuries needs to get jail time.
How would an internal combustion engine made home less likely to survive? This just devolved into silliness.
"Question about Teslas here, what protects you from a impact without a engine? What replaces it?"
"I mean, I got hit by a guy going 100+ running from the cops and I was in way less bad shape.  This guy nearly died.  I broke my arm in 2 places and only spent 2 nights in the hospital.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to say any ICE vehicle would‚Äôve been worse.  Bring on the downvotes "
How does the drivetrain affect safety? Jesus....
No way in hell the car went 400 meters.
"I do think it's pretty weird that people ""feel blessed"" after getting t-boned by someone doing 100mph.."
Ok I am impressed with the car and happy that they lived but there is *no* way it actually went a 1/4 mile lol
Honestly curious where are there that high of speed limits with reds? Thhinng of the saw mill river in NY but not sure of speed limit where there are lights.
Poor kids probably so pissed their tessie died
"Not trying to be a petrolhead, it's kinda stupid when people say ""It would have been worse in an ICE car""

It has nothing to do with the fact that it doesn't have an engine. Tesla is just amazing at engineering, and their safety standards are extremely high."
Calling bullshit no way a car moving at 100+ mph does that little damage. And no way she would have been able to react to a car coming at her at that speed from the side
Fuck. I just bought a prelude with no airbags. I‚Äôm regretting some things now
1/4 mile my ass

Awww. How nice it is to be rich. üôÑ
Ok I honest to God can't figure out if this is supposed to be a joke because that car is fucked up! Is Tesla really safe or is she just thinking that's safe? 
These kinds of stories about Tesla are not discussed enough. Stop bashing the company every time someone is injured in an accident involving a Tesla. They are the safest cars on the road. Fact. Look at the statistics. These cars save lives and the environment.
Every damned accident is caused by speed. We go too fast.
How tall are you OP? I am 6‚Äô4 and judging for the pictures I can‚Äôt see how I would have made it. Glad you and your family are fine.
[deleted]
"nobody in the Tesla died, but the guy going 100+ in a 55 deserves to die "
Sort of invalidates the OP‚Äôs claim on safe Teslas if the other non-Tesla driver survived too. 
"My guess is they weren‚Äôt doing a 100, at least not on impact. "
It's almost unheard of
Isn‚Äôt that what‚Äôs in the picture?
They certainly have some guardian engineers looking out for everyone.
didn‚Äôt they break the crash test safety machine?
They've discovered the secret to acquiring Volvonium from Asgard.
That last patent with the GPS correction vehicles did cover tanks along with many other ground vehicles.
"Sorry to be the boring, but tanks and cars are designed against different things. Tanks withstand small pointy explody things going at huge speeds. Cars withstand massive bulky things hitting them with huge force.

A car has seatbelts, airbags and can crumble like paper to ease the sudden deceleration of an impact.

Tanks have none of that. They have little space filled with pointy objects that would wreak you in all the wrong ways in case of an impact. Of course, impacting a tank with enough force is a challenge, their inertia makes them invulnerable to regular car crashes. On the other hand, if something can move a tank, like an IED, it's deadly."
A pun with good intent is still cool.
Phrasing!
You crushed my hope that the pun was intentional.
That pun has some fucken recoil my dude
you're a good person.

I always think people that list distances like this are really over exaggerating. I could see a car going that far in an accident if it rolled that far (like on all four tires) but with how fucked your that Tesla is there‚Äôs no way she went that far. More likely that she was comparing her car to the other guys car or something. I‚Äôd like to think she just isn‚Äôt very good at eyeballing measurements but I think a lot of people over exaggerate this stuff to gain more sympathy. 
"A facebook story from a witness said the Tesla car went 70/80 yards.  

https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155881143798924&id=741658923"
"Yeh, that bit is bullshit. Unless she swerved and was hit in a direction the car could roll in."
Yeah. I'm not sure I believe this.
Yeah I call bullshit on the distance.
Maybe it was just 400 feet and she thought it was meters. 
Especially in a t bone situation where the car is sideways stopped of forward momentum 
"You guys are hilarious, group nitpicking on one detail of the story. Yeah it‚Äôs unlikely as she was out of it or she exaggerated, but who cares? Not exactly the point of the story... "
My guess is that they were hit spin the car and it rolled /coasted a ways 
Where is the speed limit 55 but has a stop light?

Right? Like I get the praising of Tesla for their great safety ratings. But that has nothing to do with the fact that it doesn't have an ICE motor and more with Telsa and the consumer dump money into safety features. 
Depends on the car. Anything with 5 star rating would probably be able handle it with somewhat similar results. 
What's ICE?
"To my knowledge there isn't a car with a better side impact rating than a Tesla.

There might be one Volvo that is close but no other car has chassis rigidity for side impact like a Tesla (the battery case provides it)"
"It's a pretty safe assumption due to the different ways that ICE cars are built compared to teslas. Specifically, teslas use the massive battery pack in the floor (with more than 1/2"" collectively of solid steel as a plate across the floor) to additionally reinforce the frame. In this case it's especially true, as side impacts are one of the weaker points for normal cars due to the small crumple room and less area for reinforcement. 

In this case tesla gets effectively a free upgrade to their side crash rating as a side effect of how they design their cars. "
Still confused on what ICE is
"Maybe not significantly, but ane ICE would have been worse. Teslas really are the safest cars out there "
Tesla fan boys.  
"I think Tesla tries to make the car structurally more sound.  Also, battery tray under car instead of a block of steel/aluminum in the front so center of mass is much lower and in the center if that makes a difference."
"The battery pack in the floor adds extra protection. Weight distribution makes it harder to flip.   


Because the car is so much more rigid on its sides, it didn't crumple into the driver. Instead, the driver was just thrown into an airbag. (Which still isn't fun, presumably)"
there‚Äôs a reason tesla‚Äôs have 5-star safety ratings in every category.
"It's mostly due to Teslas reliably testing extremely well in safety tests by the US govt's highway safety board. Better than any other car in their classes, in fact. And since basically every other car in the the classes that Tesla offers is an ICE car (for the time being, at least), it's not an entirely inaccurate thing to say."
Good bot
"It wouldn't. In a side collision like this, I can't see how being ICE would make it worse. If it was a front impact, you'd probably be better off in an EV with a larger crush zone. "
With this kind of accident I don't know that it would be. The main advantage of electric cars is that lack of an engine block which allows the front end to act as a crumble zone. This however isn't really at play in a t-bone collision. The only thing that comes to mind is perhaps the battery adds more rigidity to the frame keeping the car more intact. That's just speculation though.

"It wouldn‚Äôt. A crash at these speeds is as much about luck as it is design. Elon has put it in everyone‚Äôs heads that Tesla makes the safest car on the planet, yet not a single Tesla has made IIHS top safety pick. As a matter of fact the s they tested only did average on the small overlap test. Tesla‚Äôs are safe cars but to think any other car couldn‚Äôt survive this is just not right. I mean was the driver of the other car in a Tesla too?"
"The side impact performance of Tesla's is much higher.  There may not be any passenger car that is safer on a side impact collision.  Mostly due to the high weight, low center of gravity and stiffness of the battery."
I love how the top two comments in your comment chain are basically 100% opposite.
"I think the major safety advantage of the model 3 is the strong body (chassis?). So that part doesn't really have anything to do with ICE or not, it's just a very strong body.

But I guess having the heavy batteries in the bottom may help as well, as it makes the car harder to be moved and maybe it's positioned in a way where it would absorb a good amount of the impact of an incoming car..."

Lower center of gravity. Helps will roll over. 

No engine in the front. Easier to design a body that has more crumple zones to absorb energy. 
Currently, many ICE engine and components are designed to drop and roll under the car to prevent penetration of the cabin by these components in the event of a frontal crash.

You read that wrong. She was stopped at a red light and was hit. 
I think you misunderstood the post. The guy who ran the red light and hit her was going over 100+.
I‚Äôm just going to ask you to read again. 
I got hit by a guy who was street racing and lost control of his car. You ever been driving thinking about how you're going home to eat some nachos and the next thing you know your leg doesnt work and the bones are popping out of it.

It really is something else to imagine yourself in this situation. And it gets even sadder to think not many people have the luxury of the safety of a tank a Tesla provides. An ICE car T-boned @ 100+MPH would look like a freakin' rocket crash with parts & pieces (yes, human pieces) everywhere.

Alternatively, this piques my curiosity and makes me wonder what could've happened if it was the other way around. A 100MPH Tesla T-boning a puny ICE car."

edit2: the roof of the one in the photo is cut because it's easier to get the occupants out, because the doors don't open after a crash but look at this - test is done at 40mph and if you compare the damage (except the cut roof) the damage is about the same. https://youtu.be/vXwwGWlFr9s?t=235 "
What's in the picture? I don't see anything! 
"afaik it was the machine that tested, how much load you can put on the roof before it crumbles inwards. So no impact machine, but a slowly pressing one. Still: you can put 4 Teslas on your Tesla, before the roof starts to dent, that's quite impressive"
"Honestly, even in (temporarily) bad times a good laugh is always welcome. "
It was an accident. 
I bet God can go way faster than 100mph
I imagine the car carried them ways past thw accident so that they didn't come to an abrupt halt after the initial impact. I have to think that would be rough on a broken body
"So is the speed of the car methinks.

[This](https://i.imgur.com/KgMEWyb.jpg) or [this](https://i.imgur.com/RyaTPC0.jpg ) doesn't really look like how a Mustang that came out 25 years ago should look in a 100mph accident, *and* the driver came away with only a broken leg? Something doesn't quite add up.

This is the [35mph](https://i.imgur.com/35dmAvw.jpg) NHTSA [front crash test image](https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2001/FORD/MUSTANG/2%252520DR) compared to this [100mph](https://i.imgur.com/wC6n6dC.jpg) one.

">To my knowledge there isn't a car with a better side impact rating than a Tesla.

But there are plenty of cars that ties with the same rating as Tesla when it comes to side impact.

>There might be one Volvo that is close but no other car has chassis rigidity

Volvo exceeds it by not going the way of chassis rigidity, but actually engineered side crumple zone and moves the seats inwards in the crash, which results in less impact force on the passenger than Tesla.

"
Idk the koenigsegg performed so well in the side impact test they were able to reuse the same car for the front impact test
"Considering a Tesla, have a Volvo, came here to see if the Volvo was mentioned.

Have an xc60.  That thing is a taaaaannnkk."
"It's not ""free*. Other EVs aren't this great at side impact. This is a deliberate choice on their part."
"It's not a safe assumption. The top 15 cars for side impact safety as rated by IIHS are all ICE cars. The fact they have an engine in the front has utterly nothing to do with the stiffness of the chassis or side-impact protection. 

Note image of side impact crash test of Model X: https://www.iihs.org/frontend/iihs/ratings/images/api-rating-image.ashx?id=4225&width=400

The impact in a crash is going to be *well above* where the battery pack is, and the floor protection has almost zero to do with how the side of the chassis deflects."
Besides Teslas getting the [number 1 rating in safety](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/20/tesla-model-3-earns-perfect-5-star-nhtsa-safety-rating.html)? Damn those NHTSA fanboys...  
Much of the competition also received 5 stars in every category. 
"What about cars not in its class? And I thought it had a 5 star rating, how does it compare to other 5 star rating cars?

If this lady was in a 5 star ice car are you saying she would be dead?"
That's because many of the other vehicles in it's class haven't been tested by NHTSA. 
EV batteries are below the passenger compartment and make intrusion from any angle very difficult. That battery box is STOUT!
Many argue it‚Äôs the battery... I‚Äôm personally not sure 
"That is very misleading, Volvo designed the crumple zone intentionally because it has seats that will move away from the accident site.  The 3 seems to have absolutely no crumple zone for a side impact. Look at about 2:10 in this video https://youtu.be/usca6hXymqY 

Yes, it looks bad from the outside, but honestly watch that video at 2:10, they have a couple interior scenes that show the seats literally moving away and allowing a crumple zone to form and absorb some impact. It's a really cool and smart way to add a crumple zone to somewhere that normally has none."
So the Volvo has more crumple zone...?
[deleted]
It's not fair to lump all ICE cars of all sizes together. Teslas are probably safer in most situations than comparably sized ICE cars. But I'd rather get T-boned while sitting in an F350 than a Tesla.
Actually rolling over during a side impact is a great way to reduce G forces...
Commentr above proves you wrong. Volvo s60 is safer in side impact.

All of the doctors I worked with had over 100 grand in debt but they were happy and still made a comfortable living... so needless to say I‚Äôm pursuing a molecular biology degree to become a pathologists assistant. I learned I had a rare interest in disgusting anatomy that will work in my favor, along with being able to feel apathetic towards most people making it easier to work with the dead... as long as I don‚Äôt get in a car accident without health insurance.

I would stretch so far as to say that the data from this crash can be used in the future to support the argument that this car is safer than most other cars. 
Exactly 
The paramedics opinion is not anecdotal. 
"The reality is the reality. ""Would probably"" is no reality."
Modern transmission tunnels are heavily reinforced. It's not like engineers don't understand how structural integrity works. Or how a center of gravity influences a car.
But what's cooler than bein cool?
"Yeh, I mean it really is incredible this lady was able to survive and all credit to Tesla for building a product to such a high standard that she was able to. 

However, this is a testament to modern safety standards that are required just for a car to go on sale. There are plenty of Volvos, VWs and Toyotas that could have sustained this kind of impact. "
"There's a difference between side impact and side pole impact intrusion IIRC.

There is no comparison of you look at testing videos of the best cars (volvo and tesla, posted here somewhere)"
"Your example of an ICE car is a Koenigsegg? 

Assuming the Agera RS, a car with a formula 1 carbon fiber monocoque chassis? That's a special car. 

How about a BMW 7 series? How does that compare?"
"It's free in that it's a side effect of their choice of how to structure their battery, as a single slab on the floor with thick armor plating. They chose the armor because of the battery, not because of the crash benefit. However they were free to take advantage of it while it was there. "
"Did you notice that in this accident, the Mustang driver only got a broken leg (meaning he was far better off than the Tesla driver after the accident)?  Not to mention, that people buy Mustangs because they're fun, not because they're the safest."
"You're proving his point, you will say anything to validate your purchase. The article you linked isn't even for the same car as was in the accident. But you don't care, you just want to fanboy."
Does that mean every 5 star vehicle is equivalently safe?
yeah but they're probably ugly cars.
"The NHSTB (I think that's the acronym?) doesn't rate cars in other classes against each other. A 5-star in the mid-size luxury sedan class has no direct comparison to cars in the SUV class.

As for cars within the same class, the Model S, the Model X, and the Model 3 all got 5 stars in every category, as well as higher individual scores on each test than any other cars in their respective classes.

> If this lady was in a 5 star ice car are you saying she would be dead?

No, of course I'm not saying that. That's a completely absurd assertion."
This is true but that doesn't automagically make it better in a side impact. There is no denying that Tesla engineers incredibly safe cars. Just pointing out that it wouldn't be automatically worse in an ICE car. 
">EV‚Äôs are better in front impacts because there‚Äôs more crumple zone

> EV‚Äôs are better in side impacts because the battery doesn‚Äôt crumple

wut "
"This is such a crazy misinterpretation of what you are seeing it's nuts. I'm not saying that the Volvo is not a safe car, but the fact that the beam intrudes into the cabin significantly, and forces the occupants and seats to move, they might have a rail system in there to allow movement, but the side intrusion is significant and unwanted. The latest S60 crash videos for example, have much less intrusion. I'd hazard a guess that if the side impact on that Volvo was at real world speeds (instead of the slow crash test speeds), the risk of injury would be significantly higher to the passengers in the Volvo, as they can only move so far out of the way of an intrusion before either getting stopped by the centre console, hitting the other passenger, or hitting the intrusion. "
It's not a crumple zone if it's where your body is supposed to be
YOU are the crumple zone in side impact.
"There‚Äôs no crumple zone for side impact, the airbags take over for that purpose. This test is for intrusion. Lower intrusion is better. The last thing you want is to be squished by the door of your car."
"Volvo has seats that literally move you out of the way of the accident so the car can crumple and absorb the impact. It looks really bad from the outside, but it's actually a really well designed system that protects the driver while offering a good side impact crumple zone.

https://youtu.be/usca6hXymqY watch at 2:10, there are a couple good camera angles showing it in action."
Stiff does not equal safe though. There is a reason it‚Äôs called CRUMPLEzone.

"That's a surprisingly good point that I had never thought of, and I'm a vehicle safety nut (in a prior life/career I had even done some work on crash modeling, though mostly focused on the ragdoll aspects of passengers). Vehicle roofs are now strong enough that they'll handle rollovers pretty well. It's not that a roll reduces g-forces, it more of redirects them - with the downside that the car will keep rolling farther than it might have skid and it doesn't dissipate the highest forces that cause the damage. The ideal situation, if the cars must collide, is to turn it into a glancing blow rather than a perpendicular impact.

A little bit of my work included some dynamic anaylsis to manage rollovers and skids. In other words, we tried to see if rapidly revving or braking the engine or wheels could create enough gyroscopic force to create any improvement. The hypothesis was that rapidly going from idle to 6000+ rpm at just the right moment could be enough to prevent the car from tipping, or slow the car enough at a critical moment in the roll that it would balance rather than continue rolling. Considering that the car is probably trashed by the rollover, we'd have leeway to make the engine and transmission jump up and dance a jig if it would help reduce injuries. Unfortunately, the results were pretty inconclusive when limited to the tech of the era, and it was rare that the midrange/budget cars that were the subject would be able to get much benefit from it. A high end car with a massive engine is a different beast and actually could be better controlled this way, but supercars tend not to roll so it's still not very applicable to them (but Lamborghini is making an SUV, so maybe it would be viable for that...). Collision prediction systems can do much better work of orientating a car to better handle or avoid a crash, and that's where a lot more of the benefit will be.

It was fun research and emotionally rewarding, even if nothing directly came of it. At the least, we allowed other groups to focus on different possibilities and see what ideas they could come up with to build off the collective results."
If you get lucky and everything works out.   Its also a good way in a non Tesla to get the roof crushed in.

You‚Äôre right and I should know that. The guy who totaled my family‚Äôs suv when I was around six did just that. Slammed into us from behind when we stopped at a red light because he was speeding and late for an interview. He flipped his car and sent us spinning around in circles and one foot away from crashing through a building. First cop on the scene told us his license was currently suspended for previous reckless driving. I hope that fucker never got it back and anyone who hands his ass keys gets held accountable for his actions.

"That's literally not how teenage brains work. Basically until your mid-twenties, your brain prioritizes learning and trying new things more importantly than it prioritizes safety, which makes thrill-seeking actions more common.

"> paramedics opinion

That means it's anecdotal. I doubt the paramedic is a trained crash forensic examiner, even though paramedics undoubtedly see many crashes. Their opinion is better than average, but it's not their specialty. Their job is to get the victim *away* from the crash and to the hospital, not to examine the details of metal fatigue, tire marks, and all the other factors.

A guy strip mining a mountaintop for coal will dig through a lot of rock, but that doesn't mean he's a geologist or paleontologist.

I'm not saying he's wrong, I'm saying his opinion is an estimate at best and it doesn't meat the criteria for scientific evidence. The standard for evidence is higher than that. **It doesn't matter whether he's right or wrong, what matters is that he's not qualified for his opinion to be considered authoritative.** In fact, if it goes to court for criminal trial, they'll have a forensic examiner analyze the crash - not the paramedic."
Lol.
"I apologize if that was how what I said came off, but I still would believe most other cars would roll from that amount of force. "
Fellas!
"And in the end, the type of engine the car is using has little to no impact on the safety rating. There's no reason you can't engineer a car that is even more safe than Tesla, with an ICE engine. It's just that Tesla produces high quality vehicles. 

The Chevy Bolt isn't an ICE, and received a 4 star rating for Front Passenger Side Collisions. "
Plenty of US domestics too. Cars are really fucking safe these days.
"No, not the standards. Tesla and Volvo work really hard to **surpass**them. Not likely for the VW or Toyota "
It was mostly just flippant and not realistic comparison
Nothing on the koenigsegg has anything to do with formula 1
"It's not armor plating, a Tesla isn't a tank."
You realize getting hit from the side (where all have is basically a door between you and the elements) is a lot more critical than hitting something with the front of your car (where there is built in saftey systems as well as an entire engine block to take some of the impact).
Well the lady in the article was saying that. So I guess this is just an absurd article and we should lay off on the Tesla circlejerk a bit.
The low center of gravity helps keep it from rolling.
How would having a much stronger floor pan and passenger cage not make it better in a side impact? 
"There is no reason an ICE vehicle would automatically be worse, except for the fact that there is no other vehicle in the world (ICE or BEV) designed to be as safe as a Tesla. If you built an ICE vehicle to the same safety standards as a Model S, it would hold up in a side impact just as well.

Front would require slightly more engineering, as the Tesla by default has more crumple zone -- front trunk and no giant engine up front. The front motor on an AWD Tesla sits just barely higher than the battery platform and is much smaller than any ICE. 

But the point still stands, there is no vehicle you can buy that is as strong as a Tesla in an accident. So if this lady were driving any ICE vehicle, results would have been different.

Side note: the pic posted here doesn't accurately show the post-accident condition. It's clear the jaws of life were used to remove the roof, and the roof was placed askew on top of the lower half of the wreckage at the junk yard. 

Conclusion: if / whenever I have a family and kids of my own, they will ride in the back of a Tesla (or whatever on market at the time is the safest vehicle money can buy). "
"Especially since the Model X has an ""Acceptable"" frontal and partial side impact rating."
"Crumpling is usually not a good thing in side impact, because there's usually a human in the way..."
"Saying the intrusion forces the seats to move sounds like you are implying it's not intentional. The design is intentional, it allows the creation of a crumple zone where there wasn't one before.

The amount of intrusion is also limited. I am no car engineer, but as far as I understand it, they have a stronger frame in place that will stop the intrusion after a certain point, very much like how a front crumple zone will stop crumpling and the strong car frame will stop further crumpling.

At certain speeds, it probably doesn't matter which car you are in, you are getting hurt. With the 3 it might transfer so much force to the person that they get injured, and with the Volvo maybe the crumple zone goes too far and you get hurt. However, Like I said earlier I think the Volvo system has a stronger frame to stop intrusion after a certain point, but I haven't seen a test of that. The Volvo might have a strong frame like the 3 to prevent excessive intrusion, but at least they also have a crumple zone before that."

Thank you for spreading actual knowledge. I hate to use this word but I hate when this sub becomes a circlejerk sometimes.
"That video does prove Volvo being safer. The side crumple zone worked as intended and the NHTSA reported less g-force being experienced by Volvo passengers.

Volvo has a system that literally moves you inwards as well, which Tesla lacks.

So yeah, that video proves the opposite of what you were trying to claim."
Who doesn't have their phone on them???
Dump trucks aren‚Äôt engineered for side impacts either but would fare pretty well in an accident. Don‚Äôt underestimate the benefits of size and weight in a collision.
"Impact height of side collisions are well above the floor structure of the car. The IIHS side impact crash test‚Äô impact height is 12-15‚Äù off the ground where most bumpers are. While a low COG and rigid floor structure surely help, won‚Äôt do shit if you get hit by something taller than a sedan. The side structures of any car are critical to safety and must be stiffer, and while the floor helps as a foundation it is somewhat removed from influencing most side impact scenarios. What save people on side impacts are strong doors, A, B, & C pillars combined with side impact airbags. You can thank the European OEM‚Äôs for innovating all of those aspects.

And cars have roll over protection 
"It can help, but stronger doesn't necessarily mean safer for the occupants. If you've seen the side pole test for the Model S, Model 3, and Volvo S60, the Volvo looks much weaker and less rigid than either the S or the 3. But the passenger in the Volvo experienced less force in most areas than the Model S. "
"Acceleration forces.  All things being equal, a stiffer cage will transmit the forces of the impact to the interior (and therefor passengers) in a shorter length of time.  A stiffer cage will also not absorb as much energy, transmitting more of it into the contents.  Both of these are bad qualities of a stiff cage and have to be mitigated somehow.

Advantages of a stiff cage include less chance of something directly impacting the contents of the vehicle.  But you have to mitigate the acceleration somehow.

Mitigating the acceleration in the interior of a stiff cage means higher chance of the contents of the cage traveling out of the cage and then the cage becomes useless.

It's all a balance because your two always good to do things both require adding more space and time and you're limited on one and can't control the other.  Volvo has chosen to increase the crumple zone and mitigate the impingement by physically moving the passengers away from the impact point which also probably adds another level of slowing down the transmission of force to the passenger making it even better than the crumple alone.

Tesla's are very good in many ways but they aren't the be all end all and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if as the company ages we start seeing their newer models crumple more than they do now."

The CEO of Volvo would like to have a word with you. 
That's what SIPS is for. 
Unless you use a system like the Volvo SIPS which places the occupants on slideable seat rails next to a crushable centre console so they are moved inwards. 
Even my 94 volvo has that
"What is your point? The Tesla involved in this crash saved lives because of how strong the vehicle is in a side impact.

The Volvo has rails and a crushable center console to move the passenger and absorb energy in an impact.

I'm more than confident saying that for amount of energy that can be absorbed without structural failure and protecting the passenger compartment, the Volvo would not have been enough in this accident.

Look at the video you posted and then remember this is a tbone at over 100mph."
"Interesting, didn't know that.

I know I'm using tons of formatting, but really - get it into your thick head that science is a process made to ensure accuracy and you vouch for everything you publish. If your work can't be trusted, no one will cite you because they don't want to waste months of their life trying to figure out why their experiment - which depended on your claims being true - is failing to produce any consistent result. If they met you after that, they'd tell you to go fuck yourself and die in a hole for wasting months of their time.

Even in your own example, for analyzing crash statistics, they won't use the ambulance team to evaluate it. And they will compile the information from hundreds of crashes into a full dataset which is then anaylzed as a dataset.

By the standard you just proposed, vaccines cause autism. Fucking hell, you care more about backing up your own statements to preserve ego than you do about the integrity of the process. The process exists so other people don't waste their time throwing good science after bad.

Oh, and there is a special-case kind of publication that does allow for single observations - when there are literally no other instances of that event and thus multiple observations cannot be made. This happens for diseases that are 1 in a billion or recoveries that are 1 in a billion (like Phineas Gage or the first woman to recover from rabies - those were published when the subject is the only known case of such a recovery), or events that are completely one-offs like an extrasolar asteroid entering the solar system or a star dropping in luminosity by 30% for a few months. These are instances where repeat observations simply cannot exist, and they are made with the hope that the event can be observed again. All published papers on these are considered suspect until similar events can be found and studied similarly."

Omfg grow up.
Your post was removed because it violates an item in Rule 1 within r/TeslaMotors.
"Yes, but it's a trade off. A good crumple zone for a side impact at 30 mph kills the passenger at 75 mph. Softer vs harder. Tough decision for designers. In this case the hit was at very high speed and the Volvo would not have done as well. At lower speeds, as you said, the Volvo protects better.

Things to think about for impacts. Single or multiple impacts, high speed to low speed impacts and angle of impact. Cars are not tested for all cases."

">  All things being equal,

But they are not. What you say is true but not real life. Cars have side crush zones and air bags. A stiff cage shows statistically better crash results. Then there is the weight, BEVs are generally heavier slowing their acceleration.
I agree Teslas are not perfect and often not the best, but crash wise they do very well. "
What evidence has he posted? 
EuroNCAP uses a different set of criteria than the US testing board (I can't recall the name). The US tests show Teslas to be safer than any other car tested by the US.
"Haha true. I don't know much about Euro NCAP (as another comment mentioned) but Tesla is one of few manufacturers who's received nothing but 5 stars from NHTSA. Volvo is probably the only ICE manufacturer that can come close to Tesla.

Still doesn't provide very much room
">	I‚Äôm more than confident saying that for amount of energy that can be absorbed without structural failure and protecting the passenger compartment, the Volvo would not have been enough in this accident.

Any force not absorbed by the car is going straight into the occupants, and the Volvo is absorbing more because it's got more crumple zone. 

>	Look at the video you posted and then remember this is a tbone at over 100mph.

Not only does the SN95 Mustang date all the way back to 1993, the Fox platform it sits on dates all the way back to 1977. 

And yet apparently, this 41 year old platfrom managed to T-bone an SUV well in excess of several hundred pounds heavier doing apparently over 100mph, and yet not only did the car survive looking like [this](https://i.imgur.com/LRcmjhC.jpg), the driver came out of it with a broken foot. 

Either the SN95 is unironically the safest vehicle ever built, or it wasn't doing anything appreciably near 100mph.

Interesting article...seems to be theory based...not statistical.

I can more afford the ticket and not worried about my parents.  Also at 16 I remember a buddy in a Jeep who thought it was hilarious to run over traffic barrels and I never got in his car again so he might support the theory in the article.

I will agree it shouldn't be a capital crime.  But this is a hugely selfish act.   I have never in my life come close to driving 100 mph in a 55 mph zone or a road with traffic lights.  I don't believe sentencing people to guilt trips is a very effective tool.

"So wait a minute, which is it, ""structural engineer""?  Is having that engine block in front of you make it safer (like you indicated in your first post), or does the lack of that engine block make it safer (like you indicated in your most recent post).  

Moreover, if crumple zones are the key to safety, then why is everyone on here bragging about the rigidity of the battery box? That sure doesn't seem like a crumple zone to me.   I wish you flashlight holders would pick a side and stick to it, at least.

Again, either way the Mustang wins. "
Is there some reason you felt the need say the same thing I did except in an argumentative tone as if I was wrong?
">but Tesla is one of few manufacturers who's received nothing but 5 stars from NHTSA. 

That's partly because NHTSA has tested very few of the competitors.

>Volvo is probably the only ICE manufacturer that can come close to Tesla.

IIHS testing has proven otherwise. Mercedes, BMW, Acura, Lincoln, Genesis, and Lexus all have large sedans that outperformed the Model S. 
> Though the Model S did break the machine to test roof strength. IIRC, after surpassing the limit of the machine without buckling, they came to the conclusion that the Model S can support the weight of like 4 or 5 additional Model S's stacked on top.

That was in internal testing. When the Model S roof strength was tested by IIHS the peak force it held was 19,271lbs which is a little over 4 times it's weight. But the Mercedes E-Class held a peak weight of 23,517lbs or 6 times it's weight. "
"""Volvo is the only one that can come close""

How arrogant of you to say that."
"Yes but it doesn't matter how much energy you absorb if you don't prevent intrusion into the passenger compartment.

What is your point? A mustang is good in a front impact? 

The Tesla was tboned, not the other way around. [This](https://youtu.be/qF5-EN_VmHs) is a mustang (convertible unfortunately) being hit in a side impact test at 38.5mph.

Say for simplicity this tesla was struck at 100mph, you need to remember that kinetic energy quadruples when velocity is doubled. So taking 100/38.5 = 2.597 and the square of that is 6.7465. The tesla survive 6.75 times more kinectic energy than the mustang is tested against in a side impact."

Just pointing out there is more to crash protection than this statement implies. Generally a really stiff cage helps in collisions. It protects the passengers when the impact is so severe the crumple zone is crushed."

Never saw a dime. I tried collecting now, nearly 10 years later when I noticed he made the mistake of showing a picture of him in front of the tow truck he drove on his otherwise private facebook profile. Nailed him! Checks garnished! ...for two weeks and he quit.

edit: Thanks for the mental trigger to check up on him. He is either incredibly stupid, or he realizes how I found him and is throwing up a trap to verify it. A few months ago (months after he quit) he updated his job on facebook... Calling up the marshall...

I will certainly be interesting to see after IIHS testing comes out for the Model 3. However, the C-Class, A4, 3-series, and Accord all have fantastic safety scores. In terms of crashworthiness, they all score ""Good"" in every category.  Their main issue is headlights which are also an issue for the Model 3. "

"This comment thread was posted about a year ago, it compares the NHTSA data from a Model S (which preserved 63.5% of driver's space vs S60's 7.8%, which was bragged by Elon.) against a Volvo S60:

https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7anrth/model_3_vs_volvo_s60_for_sidepole_impact_safety/dpblwy7/

As you can see the Volvo outclasses the Model S in 4 out of the 5 categories, including being 60% better in head injury criteria, despite the big discrepancy in driver space preservation.

Intuitively it does seem like preserved driver's space should be the number 1 criteria for passenger safety, and Elon knew most people would think so too (even a well educated person like you did) and that's why he was being intentionally misleading, but unless you have actual experience in crash safety and engineering you wouldn't catch this false marketing."
"I wouldn't even say ""sometimes"", but rather ""usually"". My wife gets mad at me because I let myself get screwed over and just move on a little too often. My perspective is if I have more earning capacity that they do, and the chance of recovering anything is like 15% or less, why waste my time? It might be worth it for her, but its not for me. Effort is expended only if it feels personal, but that is not financial recovery that is revenge."
">It's not even fucking close to making amends for what was done

Nice, so everybody loses. Great solution."
I would love to see the model 3 data. Where do you find this information?
"NHTSA website. Model 3 may very well be safer than the Model S (although since a=f/m and Model 3 is lighter, it would be difficult to achieve), but it probably won‚Äôt match Volvo in this regard. 

Another thing is for some reason Elon is obsessed with NHTSA tests and Tesla are engineered to optimize for them, but in reality it‚Äôs the easiest to do well test out of the big 3 and many newer high end models aren‚Äôt even tested by NHTSA anymore for some reason.

I am eagerly awaiting IIHS test results for the Model 3."
"I had a look at the NHTSA web site. I failed to find the data for the pole test. Do you have a link for it? The data that I did find for a side impact: Test 9498 did not match the table presented in the link you shared.

This is the test data I'm looking for: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vybsBTkppYI"
"Take a look at this comment with the links to the PDF directly, and it‚Äôs especially impressive since the Volvo they tested is a 2012 model:

https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7anrth/_/dpbm80v/?context=1"
"Interesting.

The modern test of the s60l in 2016 shows worse performance similar to the model 3 and model x.  

An examination of the raw data in the appendix reveals that the g forces on the dummy heads for all three cars are approximately equal in modern testing. There appears to be a spike in the head acceleration in the case of the model 3 but the video of the test suggests that this may be a measurement error.

All tests including the model S (66G) are well below the threshold of 95G that commonly indicate concussion."
"There is a completely new S60 now, but I don‚Äôt think NHTSA has tested it.

I‚Äôm by no means trying to argue Tesla is unsafe and I think both the Model 3 and Model S are amongst the safest cars out there, I just really dislike Elon‚Äôs history of exaggerating their accomplishment and mislead people into thinking how Tesla is vastly superior because the crash test video looked dramatic to the layman."
It is dramatic.  Similar g forces on the head with less impingement into the passenger compartment would appear to favour the Tesla.  Especially if the collision speed in the real world is higher. 
"That‚Äôs the thing, intrusion into driver‚Äôs space doesn‚Äôt matter if the driver is no longer in that space. 

Imagine you have a magical system that teleports the driver to the passenger seat, then you can have 0% space left on the driver‚Äôs side and it wouldn‚Äôt matter. (And the video would show this method looking worse from the outside).

In the end Volvo‚Äôs system actually ensures the driver does not get impacted by intrusion by moving the seat inward (which is not captured by the external video footage), while using the driver‚Äôs space as a crumple zone to dissipate as much energy as possible, thus resulting in less traumatic force than Tesla. It‚Äôs quite ingenious to be honest, and this is from a 2012 car.

The video doesn‚Äôt tell much of the story, in fact Tesla chose Volvo to compare *because* they have this system. If they chose a BMW for comparison video wouldn‚Äôt look as dramatic, even though the BMW would fare worse.

In the end Elon chose to compare against a car that specifically look worse in the crash video, even though it‚Äôs the result of a superior safety implementation.

"
"The superior safety of the volvo is not demonstrated.  Since both cars would result in low to zero risk of head injury at half the concussion threshold in G forces.

I suspect that at higher velocities the tesla would do better than the volvo.

This naturally follows from the fact that as the forces get larger the time between collision and head impact will drop faster for the volvo than the tesla.  Moving a seat sideways will only partially mitigate this problem because of the inertia of the driver's stationary head.

The volvo approach is also difficult to envision being effective for the backseat passengers.

Perhaps volvo understands this since it appears they changed the design for their 2016 model, which performs similarly to the 3 tesla models according to the database."

Imagine if it was a hatch!
Pun intended? ;D
r/dataisbeautiful
But all the best bulk savings are for 30 cases plus!
Don't drink and drive :)
Nice! You got some CHRISTMAS SHINERS??? They can be whatever you want them to be. 
Good to know for bulkshopping :-) And an alternative to Tesla Bj√∏rn's bananabox test.
"Have a good night my friend, by the looks of it I'm sure you will!"
"This was a kind of self-defeating post, since it shows the superiority of FCEV concept over BEV. Using 29 cases full of liquefied H2 the Mirai could travel around the world and throw away the depleted bottles en route.

Alternatively if it was 29 cases of vodka, one could drive on that from Finland to Alaska in an ICE. (Except when the chaffeur is Kimi or a russian, then the tank would run dry two days into the journey...)"
So... you were the one my math textbook was talking about
"If you unpack a box or two, could probably slide some under the front seats"
"I'm not entirely familiar with charger etiquette, but... Are you using the charger that was intended for the neighboring parking spot? It looks like your cable was actually hanging on the wall inside the other parking spot. (And the one you should be using is still hanging on the wall to your vehicle's right.)

I'm not trying to correct you or anything. I just don't know if this is commonly done/socially-acceptable."
Model 3 ready to conquer the French market! 
"Yesterday actually my wife bought about a case in individual bottles for the company party and she exclaimed, ‚Äúwow! You could probably find so much wine in here!‚Äù It was the first time we used the trunk and she also wondered how much she could fit. So yes, thank you! I was *actually* wondering this."
Just in ‚Äúcase‚Äù. I like the cut of your jib sir/lady
But where dod the driver sit? 
"Wait, looks like the title should say ""Turns out you can fit 29 cases of wine behind a Model 3. You know, just in case you're wondering."""
That doesn‚Äôt look like a tesla in the spot to the left
Does this include my girlfriend or should she take another car for the rest of the boxes?
Had to drink the 30th before hittin the road? 
I feel like you coulda fit the 30th case in somehow
"Think what that would feel like hitting you in the back when you hit the breaks hard at highway speeds. Just becuse a load fits, dosent mean it's safe to hual. 

"
Posting the real need to know. Thanks OP
Proof?
Demo video? 
"I was curious about the weight of all that wine, so I did some math.

It's 29 cases of 12 bottles each, with 750 mL of wine, and bottles of about 600 grams. This comes out to about 470 kg or 1036 lb. Add the driver at 200 lb, and you toted over 1200 lb. Book payload of the Model 3 is 963 lb. 

How did it handle? "
Hope that's not for the Christmas party
I like this sub. It‚Äôs like r/TeslaCirclejerk
I'm about to figure out if I can get 20 fold up chairs in there...
Please dont do this crap to that car. 
"Ok, how come no one is wineing about this Tesla being wined in?"
I wasn‚Äôt wondering 
Car on left ICEd
[deleted]
Definitely the pics of it loaded.
"If my math is right at roughly 5 bottles to a gallon and 8 pounds per gallon, 29 cases or 348 bottles of wine is just about 550 pounds. That‚Äôs right in the realm of  three-four adult passengers, not an insane haul weight wise.

Edit: didn‚Äôt account for bottle weight"
Tesla owners always competing to be a more showy asshole.
"You can fit so many wine boxes into this bad boy!




There, I said it."
Now it's totaled 
In laws are over for Xmas. Help a brother out.
That‚Äôs a lotta hooch!
can we please get a metric conversion bot? My head is spinning :D
That space has a destination charger and another kind of charger in it. The Beamer was plugged in. But. These four spots get iced all the time because they are close to the elevator. 
"I gotta be honest here, the bottles were yet to be filled. They‚Äôre going back to the warehouse in a pick up. "
Not sure why it was not posted first. 
"Uh, you can label all the bottles!"
I tried a case of alcohol and it wasn‚Äôt close. Didn‚Äôt even try the case of wine but I think it‚Äôs too shallow. 
Not even that. Just a photo of boxes next to a car. 
Murca!!!
Aren‚Äôt cases of beer smaller than cases of wine?
"On a drag strip, easilly.

Isnt the trans am like a stupidly big car? I feel like American cars of that era are more akin to boats.

I suppose they are small compared to 1950s Buick, and Caddy. I saw a late 50s caddy that had to have been 8 foot wide by 30 foot long, and fins as tall as a man.

Edit: my bad, 98. I was thinking of the older trans am."
5 full sized kegs of beer and three people in an 80‚Äôs 2dr Malibu.  (~1300lbs of beer and passengers). 
"Mammoth Lakes, CA. We actually made a sweet vermouth. "
A lot. However it is not advisable to fill your passenger compartment with gasoline.
12x750. I bet you‚Äôd get more with the 1.5s. 
Drink one of them first. Technically it's in the car.
Sauced!
Yes. The layout is funny. I stole the neighbors because there is also a non-Tesla charger in that spot also and a BMW was charging. This opens up an additional spot on the end. And I only parked long enough to unload and move those cases. 
I feel like you‚Äôre right. I think I might try again ha!
40. It‚Äôs a vermouth. 
It clearly states that this information is only for those that were wondering. 
Imagine intentionally going on anonymous people's posts just so you can comment on their wine and car. Truly a sad sight to behold.
"Without hanging from the ceiling, the pics of it loaded were quite underwhelming. "
"Ah we finally have an answer to the real life math problem we have all encounter, 

How many boxes of wine fit in a model 3? "
"Oops, that's about 2-3 adults in this household üôÑ"
"Bottle weight is pretty low, 1/2 pound max. "
Thats 1 adult in america. God damn metric system
"it's written on the case,

12 * 750ml bottle per case

so 9L * 29

~261kg or 575lbs in liquid.

then add the weight of the bottles.

"
 Case dismissed 
what does that mean
"1 kg is 2.2 lbs so, ~ 350 kg"
They probably shouldn't just have a Tesla sign there then
"This is good to know. I work for a liquor distributor, and have loaded up my fair share of will-calls. Someday, I'll have a Tesla, and I'll let you guys know how she does with full bottles. 

Cheers! "
"Awe come on. With the response you got, you really should see if you can fit it all in. Empty or full"
A literal dry run. 
Get a bottle labeller man. A good one will still cost a hell of a lot less than a poor human struggling to label them neatly or in a timely manner. I can refer you to a really good yet semi-affordable taiwanese option if you really don't have one. We do thousands of bottles a day on the suckers.
Did you load it with the rear seats down or up?
Goddamn right!!!
Have you been in a 98trans am? A 30rack of beer might be slightly smaller but it has basically no trunk. 
"Yeah the old school ones were massive, but they got a lot smaller more recently."
I‚Äôm very impressed amigo! Damn!
"Thankfully wine bottles are a common size,  I'll be doing a wine trip to France and was wondering if I'd get a years worth back to Ireland (we have crazy tax on good wine)"
Lolol
You win!
"No, sir! Not clearly! "
29 cases and how many people or can be how many people?
">the pics of it loaded were quite underwhelming.

I want to see those 'underwhelming' pictures. 

&#x200B;"
And with hanging from the ceiling.....?
Show us
"IF you're allowed to take them out of the box and starts stacking them, a fucking lot more."
"Acquire mass, citizen."
That‚Äôs still an added 174lbs
750mL are like a pound but yeah still doesn't matter much.
"it's 575lbs in just wine.

plus the weight of the bottles and cases."
Mcdonalds has more to do with it than the metric system
Hooch is slang for alcohol. Usually home distilled spirits.
"#That‚Äôs a lotta hooch!

"
It‚Äôs also a movie quote from Super Troopers.
Thank you Captain Hindsight!
Same here. I think my record is 35 or 40 cases of wine in my Volt. I definitely felt a difference driving down the road.
This is the unloaded pic. They definitely were all in there. I just have a severe lack of proof. 
"We usually only run 200-250 bottles per batch and bottle twice a week. We have a little manual Race labeller that works just fine, the time consuming but is that we hand write batch/bottle number and proof and abv on each label. We‚Äôre primarily a distillery but we have a winemaker license as well, so we made a vermouth. Hence the wine bottles. "
"Down, I‚Äôm not sure if I had left them up if I would have got more, I think the partition would have screwed up the trunk section. "
Where do these beers go then?
"I forgot they had a trans am in the late 90s, because it is so ugly and didnt age well. The late 70s one is iconic simply it that it has such an 80s look to it. Angular, and it looks faster than it actually is, though I guess by 1978 standards it wasnt ""slow"" but I am pretty sure 0-60 on it is probably well over 6 seconds at best, and I would wager the quarter mile isnt even in the 14s.

I was watching Hoonigans Kikawa get the model 3, and they asked him what his dream car was and it was one of these types of US 5.7L muscle clones, and they were saying how his RWD model 3 would ruin it for him because if he drove his dream car it would seem like such a slow POS in comparison.

I love that you can always pick out real car guys by their reaction to teslas (or miatas). Real car guys love Tesla or at least find them interesting, and guess what, those are cars too. It doesnt mean they stop loving other cars, it just means they dont hate for the sake of hating.

There are tons of cars I ""hate on"" with regards to elements in design, efficency, power, price, or performance but I dont hate cars, and I can appreciate when something is amazing even if something isnt my cup of tea. I hated American cars after the early 70s until the Focus RS and M-Sport R5 (arguably an english and not American car), and the Corvette. Recently I think the GT350, and Camero LT1 1LE are also some of the best cars on the planet for any price. Oppenhieser the guy who designed what might be the best performing American car of all time the LT1 1LE which unofficially posted a better lap time at nordschliffe than the 911 GT2 RS is now the lead for GMs EV program. Coincidence? I dont think so, he is to GM what Franz is to Tesla, and the next Camero is probably going to be electric."
5 cases in the front passenger seat. A lot of drinking alone. 
"Yeah, I can't upvote this post without first seeing the car actually filled up."
So literally a single person...
thank you for not just repeating that‚Äôs a lot of hooch
Usually? Hooch is specifically moonshine. 170+ proof corn based alcohol. 
Noice! Max for me was about 35 in a Scion xD. Definitely had to give myself more time to stop at the lights. 
"Ahh, sorry misunderstood. I didn't realize you actually had them in there. "
That‚Äôs the impressive part. I‚Äôve got some mad Tetris skills with the hatchback and rear bucket seats 
In the driver.

"It's just amazing that people wait for an audience to answer the definition of a word, instead of using a search bar."
"Well, in this case they are referring to wine. Maybe not the correct usage of the word in this case, but we know they mean alcohol in general."
"No kidding. I could really tell when I was getting back on the interstate and trying to get up to speed and merge. Just another day in the life as a rep, hah"
"I think it's because you still get the information, but you're not too bothered at the same time to go out of your way to find the answer. Plus, since it's slang there could be multiple meanings; he will provide the meaning he meant. 

I'm high don't mind me "
"I dont judge colloquial use. Like when people call magazines clips for guns. I am okay with that, but if someone is asking the actual definition of a word that is different."

Tesla's will be affordable sooner than you think (maybe in 3-5 years) once all the Model S run out of warranty and reach 2nd to 3rd hand markets.

"I have a little grievance to air. I was taking an Uber last week and was so happy to see that the car would be a model 3.

It wasn't. It was a Model S. That bastard claimed his car is a 3 but he didn't have one. I've driven the S and it's great, I like it, bit I'm not in the market for that one. I wanted to ride in the 3. Granted I could go to the Tesla dealership, but that requires a pair of extra trips, and I don't even know if they have any in stock.

Im starting to consider the Hyundai WhateverItsCalled full EV that should come to the US in 2019. It has a 65 KWhr battery which rivals the 3 pretty well, and it's probably not quite as nice as the 3 (it is a Hyundai so, yeah.... A downgrade from my prior car), but the price is better and it can show up a year earlier."

Remedy what?
Affordable is a fuzzy word when the kid is excited about receiving an inexpensive toy as a gift. I hope OP is able to move up the economic ladder from his/her family and afford the extreme luxury that is buying a Tesla.
A Tesla out of warranty? That sounds terrifying.

"True , over here (UK) Model 3 hasn't even been released, can't wait for 3-6 years down the line when they start getting sold second hand"
"Please define affordable. Because a $36k Tesla still isn't affordable. Especially when plenty of people have nowhere to park and charge it at night. What with everyone who needs to use street parking in any city. So really, how exactly could a Tesla ever be ""affordable.""

Edit: What's with all the downvotes?

Guess it's not popular to actually finally be able to spend money around here."
These hotwheel posts were an epidemic last year and I thought [we agreed to remove them](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5tvim5/have_a_new_hot_wheels_car_post_it_just_kidding/)
"I think used Teslas may be under 10k by 2022. (2013 Model S for example)

Now upkeep costs....that depends on how well rich rebuilds gets his own repair shop haha."
"Kid is the key word there. Some dedication to school, or otherwise dumb luck and they too can be moneybags on legs."
I do think an old Tesla will be a better idea than an old S-class. Even better if it does not have a sunroof or air suspension.
">	extreme luxury

A Tesla is a luxury car but ‚Äúextreme luxury‚Äù is something like the Rolls Royce Phantom. Cars that cost several hundred thousand dollars or more."
As someone having warranty work being done right now I agree....
"No. That's a proven car. A brand new car with unknown mechanical performance sounds a lot worse. I always bought used, and always did my research. By the numbers and especially if you set aside some time to shop around, the money you save from depreciation is more than what you will ever spend on repairs.

Teslas are good for a million miles, a used Tesla likely means that anything that is likely to have been a lemon about the car would have already shown up by then. Easy inspection for interior and exterior quality, and battery health. Much less to check or be concerned with warranty wise with a Tesla than any other car on the planet."
"10k parts, not 100k"
"Why buy a Tesla as there are cheaper options on the market. Long range EVs are still expensive but a used EV can be had for under $10,000 US or a Volt /Ampera."
I've got into my truck through tiny openings in the door before and that's when I'm parked next to junk! Couldn't imagine the stress of trying to squeeze into my truck when parked by a tesla. Please don't!
">just to not have someone next to me

Same here... and there is someone parked next to me when I return to my car... every time."
A 9V comes with its own gauge to determine if it still has charge. Just lick the contacts quick.
Yup.
What do you do now? I‚Äôm trying to be like that
"Yep, and the only reason this one remains is because it was at 1k upvotes by the time anyone saw it.  All others were removed for the reason you mention.  Noted the same [here. ](https://reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/a2z2uo/_/eb2fue3/?context=1)"

"Speaking as someone who immigrated to this country with his poor family and zero dollars, I can promise you that when a used Plymouth Voyager is luxury for poor people, a Tesla fits the very definition of extreme luxury. I‚Äôm not talking about a class of car, I‚Äôm talking about perspective."
">Teslas are good for a million miles, 

O yea?

"Oh right, typo. "
True. 
"Well, I'm a physician and also have had a few small business attempts (with pretty variable levels of success) but that's certainly not the only path to doing well and it's probably one of the longer and more painful ways to do it (especially with all the student loans, though some med schools are more generous than others). My brother worked incredibly hard in school and managed to get into an ivy league school and then leveraged their alumni network to get some great internships and now he's an ""evil wall streeter"" who works at a hedge fund. My high school buddy now makes about triple what I do as a physician working at Google and making it up the ladder there. My college buddy now makes almost a million a year as an insurance salesman (though now he also manages a whole office of insurance salesmen). My college roommate is a physician as well now.

And just to let you know where I started out->when I was a kid my dad was a cab driver who could only work a few hours a week due to health issues and my mom was a home health aide who put herself back through school while still working to become a nurse. I remember when our old Nissan Sentra (stripped, no radio, no AC, manual windows of course) had an engine failure and we struggled for months to be able to buy a replacement car and ended up with a Honda Accord that had been rear ended then somewhat badly fixed (the trunk was ever so slightly crooked) because that was the only thing we could afford.

Everyone I know who made it worked incredibly hard to get there though, and not everyone was necessarily the best at test taking. For example my insurance sales guy friend who probably makes more than 99% of physicians got to be so well off because he'd get to work at 5AM in the morning when nobody else would. Everyone else thought he was nuts but within 2 years he was the top salesguy in the company and this was a company with offices across the US. And the secret was mostly that by getting to work so insanely early he could actually coldcall places and get through to wealthy executives and directors who were just as intense and were getting to work at 5 or 6 in the morning themselves. During normal business hours their secretaries would filter all these cold sales calls and basically tell him to pound sand, but because he called them at 5:30 in the morning there was nobody else in the office to pick up the phone except the execs themselves.  And more than a few people were impressed that he was at work himself so early and had the same kind of intense work ethic as them, so even though they probably wouldn't have otherwise taken time out to listen to some guy try to sell them insurance they did.

Anyways, don't know why people are downvoting my original comment but it's certainly possible to make it even if you're not from a wealthy background and don't have crazy connections. You can do it in a lot of fields as well (though you should probably pick a field that pays well to begin with). It does take a lot of hard work no matter what road you pick though, for those of us not lucky enough to just be born rich.

Up until this year I had been pretty intense about saving up my money, investing as much as I could, and trying to pay down my student loans (had about 200K in med school loans at one point...and I'll have paid around 240K total). I would shop around for even the smallest things-like I'd buy a beverage I didn't like as much at a supermarket or drug store just because it was 50 cents cheaper, and I'd still just order off the dollar menu at McDonald's just because it was like $2 cheaper for the meal. Which probably sounds insane to most people but that's how I had managed to get through all those years of being a broke med student and then a broke medical resident. It was only this year that I finally started to learn to let go of that extreme financial rigor a bit and most of this has been over the last month or so. I finally decided last month to just go ahead and buy the Model 3 but even with that I literally spent 5 months debating the financials after being invited to configure before I finally gave in. But probably the biggest change was actually just last week that I finally just bought something at a supermarket without checking how much it was-it was just a sweet sesame confection (a halvah bar if anybody's curious) but the old me would have absolutely asked the cashier how much it was before deciding whether to buy it. Sounds totally bizarre but it wasn't until I got home and my wife asked me about it that I realized it was the first time I didn't know how much I paid for something.

Either way, it actually felt really good that I felt financially secure enough to finally be able to buy a normal item without thinking too much about it because it legitimately doesn't really matter anymore. Maybe it's because I'm finally finishing off my student loans, or maybe it's because of less fortunate things (my father died last year and that definitely triggered a lot of introspection about life), but either way this is the first time I've actually felt like I really finally made it.

"Understand, thanks for being vigilant"
Hey i said affordable to own not to drive ü§£
Except Tesla doesn‚Äôt market itself as a luxury brand. 
"Friend, please don‚Äôt get into a 96-month loan. The car is absolutely amazing, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth an 8-year loan."
"96 months do not make sense. If you can't afford it over a 5 or 6 year loan you should really reconsider buying the car. There's a high chance you'll have the loan beyond your car at that rate. 

Unless you obtain gap insurance and it gets totaled but still not wise because your insurance WILL recoup that money somehow..."
"An 8 year car loan should be illegal, that's just insane. They might as well go the way of the mortgage and offer 30 years. 8 years is how long my car lasted before someone crashed into it and destroyed it. 4 years is fine, 5 or 6 years is pushing it. "
In the name of all that is holy don't get a 96 month loan.
2016 model s (85D are around 40-60K used in my market) they‚Äôll get there soon enough
Jesus 96 months? I didn't know car loans even went that long!
"Having had a Model X P100DL for over a year, I wouldn't want to own it out of warranty. 

Things that might fail:

Suspension, brakes, tyres, interior (let's be honest, it's laughable quality for a ¬£150k car) mechanised parts (seats, mirrors, doors), electronic components and suchlike.  

That's assuming the drivetrain never fails."
"Random parts breaking like any other car? Not entirely sure TBH but think body panels, replacement battery (if that failed) or drive train, MCU, door handle etc."
Ah that is a good perspective. In my auto terms a Tesla is not a luxury vehicle. Yes it‚Äôs expensive. But compared to comparably priced cars the interior and even some of the build components are half the quality on the Tesla. 
Based on what data? Tesloop says otherwise.
"Damn this is exactly what I want to do. Im currently studying business atm... although I wanted architecture. I have two small ideas but for now it‚Äôd be better for me to work somewhere and earn the money to start that idea. I seem to be the only one in my immediate family actually trying to get myself out if this ‚Äúpoor loop‚Äù 
Anyway, thanks for this information (: I appreciate it 
Edit: i‚Äôm also not eligible for financial aid ):  so extra frugal and broke"
Some parts wear out over time rather than over miles. It's still not cheap.
It‚Äôs not really a luxury vehicle yet. I hope one day it is but luxury isn‚Äôt defined by the price. There is still a lot of improvement to be had on the interiors of x and s to bump to luxury class. Fingers crossed the next gen S and X show improvements...
"That‚Äôs interesting, because when they release their sales information they compare it the other luxury cars. Depending on perspective, they may not fit the bill for a strictly ‚Äòluxury car‚Äô, but the cars are A LUXURY  by every definition of the word."
"5 and 6 year loans are pretty standard - especially since cars nowadays last much longer than they used to. People seem to say oh X is not what it used to be, but statistically cars are achieving higher mileage and age than ever before.

7 and 8 are stupid. 

A 60 or 72 month loan at 1.99% APR like many credit unions offer is absolutely a smart decision. Why sink a lot of capital into a depreciating asset when you can borrow the money at a rate lower than inflation. 

I find it absurd that people think buying the car cash is a good idea. 50+k when you could have borrowed that 50k at a low rate and invested the rest at a higher return. "
"But wouldn't things like brakes, tires, suspension need replacing on any vehicle? Or do these tend to break down quicker on a Tesla?"
deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8496  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/84271)
"Doesn't *technically* have to run for you to own it I think is basically what they meant by ""cheap to own not drive""."
"Yeah, they were just comparing a used Tesla to a used Rolls Royce and they are just not really comparable..."
"> I find it absurd that people think buying the car cash is a good idea.

It's actually a really good idea - if you run a marijuana dispensary and can't get a normal bank account to hold your money. Or if you just can't launder money and need something to spend it on.

But otherwise yeah, l'll take 2% APR any day. I wish I could refi my student loans at that rate."
"There are more variables in play than pure rate of return.  For example I may finance a car at 2% for 5y and then pay it off a year later because I‚Äôd rather save the hit to cash flow. Other times I‚Äôm not worried about it and take the 4% i net keeping the cash in investments. 

I think the key is that being able to pay cash for a car, whether you actually do or don‚Äôt aside, allows you to make decisions you otherwise can‚Äôt. "
"Of course.  But low volume, high vehicle cost and a closed shop as far as parts availability goes means expensive upkeep.

Also, let's not forget, they're not brilliantly built and they are almost certainly going to fail faster than something from Japan... "
"CR. Seriously that is your source. Get a better source. CR is unreliable for Tesla anything.

I posted you a buisness that does nothing but put tons of miles on teslas, in fact the whole buisness model relies on teslas being so much cheaper than any other car to drive to high milage.

I trust their data based on actual long term and long haul driving a helluva lot more than some CR FUD."
You actually can‚Äôt buy the Tesla in physical cash - it would have to come out of an account of some sort lol
Im waiting for when your car will deliver itself and your old one drives itself back
How much of a depreciation hit did you take upgrading?  I was considering doing the same thing. 
Nice! I‚Äôll be doing this....in a few years. Maybe the 3 will have Ludacris mode by then 
"Is the ""old"" one a 3 too? "
How much did you tip the driver :)?
"God I wish all cars were delivered like pizza. No dealership bullshit, know exactly what you're paying on the order page, and order. "
Was there a pizza box?
I debated between the AWD and the P3D for a week or two.  Chose the P3D and couldn‚Äôt be happier.   It brings a smile to my face every day and uncontrollable giggling to my new passengers every time we go out. 
"Now the real secret: how did you get them to fucking call you back?

I wanted to upgrade the P3D to an X. The model 3 is just not for us. But nobody at Tesla knows how to use a phone. My last trade in request, they called me back some 8 months later. I still haven't heard about my state credit for the powerwall. I still haven't heard about the model s wheel bearings I ordered several months ago, and long since have replaced with an ebay one. These most certainly are not the first instances of ""We'll give you a call"".

Elon: have you heard of this company called Salesforce? They're like, really really big around here. I hear they work wonders for making your customers feel like they're not piles of shit getting in your way.
"
I‚Äôll take the old one. 
Nononono. I shouldn't do this same thing. Closing Reddit before I actually go do it.
"Man, I'm not sure I'll ever get over not getting the P3D.  Would have definitely pulled the trigger at the current price. "

What was your loss on the trade?
What's the process for this? Did you just order a performance Model 3 and trade in your old one or is there something specific for this kind of thing? I bought a RWD Model 3 back in August and have been thinking I should've gotten the performance

"> Im waiting for when your car will deliver itself and your old one drives itself back

At that point, you probably won't own a car. There will an uber-like Tesla service that comes to pick you up either on demand or at a pre-determined time, it will take you where you're going, and then will head off to pick up the next person."
"About $10k, but the P3D was discounted almost $4k, I‚Äôve got just enough tax liability to get the full $7500 credit twice, and in Texas you get credit for the trade in when it comes to sales tax on the new car. 

Does it make sense financially? Not at all. But 3.3 0-60, hot damn!"
Upvote for Ludacris mode. Roll out. 
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm mad at myself for not waiting for the specs on the P3D, back in March when I got the car everyone expected it to cost twice the difference it actually did. After all, a Model S 100D -> P100D is almost $40k."

RWD yes.
Is 15% standard on a car delivery?
"I think OP said a pizza, unless I misread the headline. It's a reverse business model - in Soviet Texas the delivery guy leaves a car and takes a pizza."
"You can do that. It's just not nearly as simple as Tesla does it.

When I bought my Mustang I specced it out on Ford's website and went into my local dealership to give them the build info. I had already secured financing and just went in to sign the papers. A few weeks later the car was delivered right to my house. "
"Me too. The last time I bought a car, that's all they did anyway, walked me through the configuration website and submit my order. I can do that in my jammies at home and have them deliver it."
Is haggling on list price not a thing in the US?
"Nope, just a car. I feel so robbed."
That‚Äôs exactly why I upgraded.
I can confirm that this applies to the long range model too. I just had a hard time arguing the 10k extra for the performance model. But it would be cool to compare.
Tesla uses Salesforce.

The red is the used one. It also has ceramic coating and full front PPF.

Trade in. I could have sold it for more but the sales tax credit we have in Texas helped offset the difference. That and I don‚Äôt have to deal with trying to sell it. 
"Not sure, call them! They are taking Model 3 trade ins. "

How many miles did you have on your RWD 3 that you traded in? 
"The speed of the P3D is so interesting to me. The Taycan and E-Tron GT haven‚Äôt even come out yet, and they‚Äôre already slower (3.5s). 

I recognize that they‚Äôre trying to be a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù EV, it seems like they‚Äôd want their flagship EV to be faster than the existing market leader. "
[deleted]
What did you get for the trade in? Cause a LR-RWD at a 10k discount sounds like a really nice deal to me :)
If it's $10K before the $7500 credit that's not bad at all. You'll love the power.
I thought each person only qualified for the tax credit once.

That‚Äôs a hefty tip lol 
"> not nearly as simple as Tesla does it

Why?"
A couple years ago I leased a new Ford for a company vehicle. It was near the end of the month and the salesman really wanted to push the deal through so I was able to negotiate a delivery at my office. They brought the car over on a flatbed and we did all the paperwork at my desk. In and out in ten minutes.
"Depends on the dealership and brand represented. I don't think for instance Toyota haggles much or at all, and nor does Tesla. "

"SC informed me they are switching to an internally developed app (most of service is switched, sales is in transition)"
"Mostly just the size. I work from home, and I do most of the family driving so I almost always have the whole family in the car.

Pros: I love that they finally gave in and made a proper interior. The doors have storage. The cup holders are actually functional. The center console and window switches are better positioned. The seats are ridiculously comfortable. 

Cons: Screen glare on the high mounted screen, right where the navigation is. Small screen (not for new-to-tesla buyer, but to a model s owner). Overly complicated to do simple shit like turn on the wipers, open the glove box, and turn on/off the air. Why the fuck does my $70,000 car not have auto opening trunk or at least auto opening windows? Very cramped for a family vehicle, great if you drive alone a lot."
Lol I'd love to I'm saving to get my first electric car (fresh outta college want as little debt as possible till student loans are gone) how hard is it to find charging stations? Are they common in Austin? I feel like I've barely seen any here in Dallas
I've seen zero used model 3's on trade websites so far. I wonder what Tesla would sell it for
"That's what I'm doing. Man, Model 3 2.0 better be baller"
Nowhere has Tesla ever referred to the Model 3 as the 'M3'. 'M3' implies a *BMW* M3.
AP2 is the second generation S2000.
Ahhh I thought it was an S driving away at first glance.  Good call.
Wait they discontinued the silver color? What a shame. Guess I‚Äôll be getting red one day.

It‚Äôs still illegal by the way. "
Correct but seems like people did not understand 
"I‚Äôm referring to the fact that the company is subsidized to a tune of like $90k a minute. That‚Äôs coming from our tax money. So yes, the rich are driving cars subsidized by the poor. So good for you bozo, your opinion means squat. Let‚Äôs see if Tesla would survive without. Also, Porsche is releasing their electric that will bury those god awful Teslas (FYI they look like fancy Ford Probes, totally 90‚Äôs bubble style...UGLY). "

Those are just the advertised numbers. Porsche is rarely accurate with their horsepower and acceleration numbers. The real numbers are always quicker than what Porsche says. 
[deleted]
"What's more is that I don't think we've seen the top acceleration of the model 3 yet. It's going to take another 2 years for Taycan and E-Tron GT to hit the streets, and I have faith in Tesla's engineering that there'll be an even faster model 3 within that time."
Tires at 55 psi? You are probably not getting great traction with that.

"Tax credit is tied to the VIN, not the person. "
They dropped off my new car and left in the old. I gave him the pink slip but he had to come back to return it as I'm supposed to mail it in at some point when they send me an envelope for it.

I would say bad time to be in transition but it‚Äôs Salesforce so arguably any time is a good time to be in transition.
"Yeah I was caught in a call between 2 CS agents from Tesla.  They were talking about how to get me the EAP I paid for on my P3D+.  The whole time they were using internal tool names.  Sounds like they were half using Salesforce and some other tool they developed internally called ""Garage"".  Garage was so buggy they couldn't even find my car.  It took 30 minutes for them to just find it."

Check out Plugshare. Definitely worth doing before you buy any EV to make sure you can make it work for you based on your location and driving amount.

"I don't have the performance model, but I do have the dual-motor Model 3 that does 0-60 in 4.5 seconds. In a straight line, pedal-to-the-metal acceleration, my head hits the seat every time (even though I'm expecting it).

The thing that's so crazy to me is the power curve. Since there's no transmission, there's no spin up - gear change - spin up again - gear change again, it's all just so smooth.

"I know someone who worked at SpaceX. He loved it, only left because of the commute. He would drive to his local municipal airport then fly to Hawthorn, hop on his bike and pedal over. It was still quicker than driving. 

He gave me a tour of SpaceX in 2013. I didn‚Äôt know the holy ground on which I stood. It was the first time I heard of Tesla. We were standing in the parking lot looking at the building as he was pointing out some details, turned around to see a model S patiently waiting for us to move. Who knows how long he was waiting since we couldn‚Äôt hear it. He said it was a common problem but the Tesla people were really cool and understanding about it. Hell, it was probably Musk himself but I was too dumb to know."
"Intended or not, this is basically a giant middle finger to the press and UAW.  Both of them are constantly harping on Tesla for how Elon and the company in general treats employees.

"I worked at SpaceX and now I'm a consultant for them. Had a great time working there but I definitely couldn't have stayed their my entire career, I'd probably be dead by 40."

"Interestingly he was ranked worse by Tesla employees than Mary Barra was ranked by GM employees, since it was the SpaceX employee ratings that got him into the top 50 whereas Tesla employees rated him lower.

>Those from Tesla, on the other hand, gave him a more conservative 77 out of 100. If Comparably‚Äòs study only focused on Musk‚Äôs ratings from his Tesla employees, he would have missed a spot in Comparably‚Äòs Top 50 Best CEOs list once more.

Mary Barra is ranked 49th in the top 50 so she barely made the cut herself but it seems like GM employees actually rate her more highly than Tesla employees rate Elon.

Wait really? I thought he was unpopular with Tesla employees.

I'm so confused.  I heard an NPR report about how bad the safety conditions at Tesla factories are.  People getting hurt way more than the average for car factories.  
He is the best person who ever lived. He is our Lord and saviour. He is Elon Musk
Uh how is flying to work economically feasible?  Was he an exec?
A guy in my tri club is an ex Air Force pilot that now works at spacex. He commutes from sna to Hawthorne daily. He said fly time is less than 15min but with all the checks it‚Äôs about an hr.
"lol, he was a friend of mine while I was there.  I was jealous.  "
"> He would drive to his local municipal airport then fly to Hawthorn, hop on his bike and pedal over. It was still quicker than driving.

God damn the carbon emissions of doing that would be off the charts. "
I don't know if flying your own plane to work is awesome or retarded. Probably both.
And then Elon Musk got out of his car and started clapping. 
"There should be a low volume, friendly sounding pedestrian alert function for the horn or similar."
How many cents did you get for this post?

hey daddy elon
Like how SpaceX and Tesla are different companies? 
"Elon Musk:¬†I think there was like literally one week where I actually worked 120 hours and just didn't leave the factory. I didn't even go outside. I wanted to make it clear to the team. They needed to see that however hard it was for them, I would make it worse for me."
"Well, morale looks to have improved so logically the beatings have stopped."
I have to imagine his companies have enough exposure and a following where prospective employees view being a part of that vision as balancing out any long hours or possibly substandard conditions.
"I mean, there are no shortage of horror stories from the Tesla factories over interactions with Musk. "
Well he does. 
Yes. 
Both are true. That's the interesting part. 
"That's... not how it works?  Did you read the article?

They basically anonymously give their CEO a rating, the company doing the analysis compiles ratings from tons of companies and sees which CEOs are rated the highest by their own employees.

They don't rate other CEOs.

Elon was given an 83/100 by SpaceX employees and a 77/100 by Tesla employees.

This got him a ranking of 19th.  

He wasn't in the top 50 the previous year."
"Read the article. The employees rated their CEO, then the ratings were compared. "
My thought exactly. How would you be able to know how good a CEO of another company is?
Class action suites like that don't mean employees dislike the company.  There was a pay issue that was specific to a certain practice and a class action suite was to address that.  Employees can want their fair correction and still be otherwise happy.
Would be interesting to see if private companies in general ranked their CEOs higher than public companies...
"I refuse to believe Mary Barra is ranked higher than Elon in any way imaginable. Those have to be cooked statistics, entirely faked. 

We‚Äôre talking about a CEO that makes like $30m on salary alone, just came out to say she is closing 5 plants in NA. 


Fuck that bitch. "
"Also worked at Tesla and i completely agree. Amazing visionary, terrible leader. "
and gotta love the fact that HE SAVED TESLA.
Haha I was just thinking that. Apparently the article is something different tho. Just a oddly worded title. 
Maybe try reading....might help. 
They obviously weren't consulted since they don't work there anymore.
Who else were they going to vote for? 
This is a subreddit devoted to a specific corporation. 
"Read the article.

A survey is done annually.  They poll many companies employees and ask them to rate their own CEOs anonymously.

Those CEOs are given scores based on the ratings of their own employees.

Elon got an 83/100 by SpaceX employees and a 77/100 by Tesla employees.

This earned him a ranking of 19th place.

He wasn't in the top 50 the previous year."
"Read the article. The employees rated their CEO, and the ratings were compared. "
Except that's not how the survey worked. 
"Clearly, you didn't read the article....so now you just sound like an ignorant person."

"He and another guy plane-pooled. The other guy owned the plane but they are both pilots. My friend would pay for fuel and the owner kept the plane serviced.

Edit: He was not an exec. just a technician in the structures testing dept."
"When I was working in silicon valley I flew in to work every day.  It was much cheaper to live out of state and buy a plane and another car to keep at the airstrip in CA than it was to just live in the Valley, and the commute time was about the same anyway.  It helped that I had a friend's hangar to tie down."
"I work with some people in Palo Alto who are seriously considering switching to plane commuting. A house near Palo Alto costs at minimum a million bucks. You can get a nicer house in Sacramento for less than half that. So the idea is to sell your house in the Bay area, use the profit to buy a small plane and a house in Sacramento, and the difference in mortgage payment for the maintenance.

Also, flying a plane from Sacramento to Palo Alto is literally faster than trying to commute from the East Bay over the Dumbarton bridge."

"I‚Äôve interviewed for SpaceX.  Right off the bat, one of the first questions during the phone and panel interview was ‚Äúwhat are your thoughts on working long hours, including holidays and weekends?‚Äù  It‚Äôs not like employees don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre getting into and SpaceX or Tesla are bamboozling people.  You really need to be tough and motivated to work there, and they screen out the weaklings right away. "
"Then that would apply to every other employee at every other company, in the end the effects would null each other"
I said disrupter
"This is very common, especially with engineers and tech workers. You already know the systems, are familiar with the guidelines, and know what‚Äôs feasible.  Executive staff know you and your work and trust you to come in and monitor or fix issues and keep an overall project on track.  Plus they pay you by the hour, often at an inflated rate with no benefits so it‚Äôs a win/win. Most people return as a consultant when retirement gets too boring"
They quit but the company didn't want them to leave. Instead the company offers them to come back as a consultant instead (sometimes even doing the same job but with better terms like less hours or a greater per hour billing rate).
"I joined a consulting firm and they were an existing client, I do projects for all of SpaceX's competitors too."

"Yeah, electric planes have a ways to go. Totally feasible and it will be popular with training fleets when they become available but they're not quite certified yet.

The problem with new planes is they're expensive as hell. You can buy an old Cessna 172 in fine condition (meets airworthiness standards obviously) for $50,000. Maintenance, insurance, and storage costs extra but ultimately you could own a plane for considerably less than some of these folks spent on their Teslas. Considering Silicon Valley and LA employees otherwise have to live and drive in some extremely expensive areas, it starts to make perfect sense. Hell, if you can afford an old Mooney you could fly to LA from Bakersfield in the time it would take to drive across LA."
"Batteries don't have the power potential of gasoline fuels. Not nearly. Until they do, you won't see electric aircraft."
">  You really need to be tough and motivated to work there, and they screen out the weaklings right away.

I get what you are trying to say, but I really, really hate how talks like this paint people who are willing to work 80 hrs a week as ""motivated and tough"" and people who don't want to as ""unmotivated and weak"". Just because you want to have a semi-normal work/life balance and you want to spend time with friends and family doesn't make you less of a human being.

That's exactly how the video game industry exploit people's ""passion"" by overworking and underpaying them as well. Same is happening here."

In mine, it caps at $10 if you don't have at least 3 people in the car (then it's a HOV free lane) to go as little as 2 miles - and people pay it to bypass standing in gridlock.  

&#x200B;

Time spent in a commute is time wasted for the most part, I had a job once where I had a 50 minute one way commute, and the office was moved a year later to be only 15 minutes from my home.  It was indescribably freeing, I was given over an hour of every day back to do whatever I wanted.  It felt almost wrong at first, being home so early and able to sleep longer, or eat breakfast slowly after a year of being stuck in a car."
"I did this once or twice per week for about 5 months last year.  I'm not a pilot, but love flying, and my flying buddy is a licensed instructor with his own 152.  We'd commute the 100mi (drive distance) in about an hour.  I'd often do the flying over 1000ft, but only one take off and no landings.  He changed jobs late last year and so we don't fly together any more.  But it sure was a blast while it lasted.  Way more fun, way faster, and not much more expensive.  I paid for gas, since he paid for the plane, maintenance, tie-downs/hanger, etc."
"While I was training here in Ohio, there was a guy who lived in the country and would fly his Piper Cub into the airport to his job which was flying a Falcon 2000. So he'd fly his cub to the airport, get in the jet for a couple days, then fly the Cub back home. Honestly the only problem with this is the Ohio weather but in LA that's virtually a non-issue."
"Am student pilot with 80 hours. Can confirm, would have stopped listening at ‚Äúhey you can fly to..‚Äù ok sounds good!"
Like carpooling but with planes
"It‚Äôs common and cheaper if you make pilot buddies and buy pilot stuff together like planes! It‚Äôs co ownership with a tad of google calendar. Why pay $60-70k for a plane when you can pay 30-35 and share it with your most trusted pilot friend. Obviously, don‚Äôt do this with a stranger. But it cuts all your costs in half basically.."
"Not sure on the name of the owner of the plane. But it‚Äôs likely him, I would assume that not a lot of people do that."
There‚Äôs a guy in the city I used to live in who flew a helicopter from the far south side of Chicago to downtown Chicago everyday. 
"At UAB Hospital in Birmingham, several of the doctors live on Smith Lake and fly a helicopter into work daily."
While I was working as a mechanic in Southern California I had a customer who flew a rescue helicopter in Alaska for a living. He would leave his cars/trucks with us for weeks at a time until he got back. Got his cars maintained and free storage while he was away I guess.
Housing's cheaper in Tahoe and I have hobbies
"Wish we could retrofit old planes with electric but I guess the risk of dying due to a crash is greater than if you retrofit an old ICE car(Which many people do). 
"
[Well the pipistrel is for sale now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgdj9HpdzvI) 
"Small electric aircraft now a reality, but what do you do when the battery catches fire? It is essentially impossible to put out or even supress with the pressure bottles available on-board, quickly leading to structural weakening and failure.

Maybe a battery quick-jettison mechanism could be implemented, but what if the burning mass lands on top of a kindergarten and scores of toddlers die?"
"Totally. At my work we actively encourage work life balance. We‚Äôre happy to put in the shift if needs be, but if you‚Äôre doing that more than occasionally then the company is doing something wrong. 

I value time with my family and children. I‚Äôve done the long shift and made work my life, now the company is ‚Äògrown up‚Äô it‚Äôs not productive any more. "
"That‚Äôs not what I meant to convey, it was a poor choice of words. I should have said people who are passionate and enthusiastic about the vision of the company instead of tough and motivated.  Did not mean to imply that those who were not willing to work the hours were somehow subpar by comparison. "
"I agree with you for the most part (I also prefer a good work life balance) but I think there's a difference... Most SW companies treat their employees that way, so it's not like employees in that Industry have much alternative choice, if every company in town has that attitude towards their workers. 

In SpaceX / Tesla's case, most of their competitors are way less intense places to work, so people can choose to work for them instead if their home life is more important to them, than in majorly shifting / disrupting things... So I think that Tesla/SpaceX saying ""we are the intense option, if you dont like that way, apply at  ULA / Ford instead"" isn't all that bad. "
"Why don't you go watch the actual segment so you can see how much this guy is making shit up. But please, in the meantime, don't let me interrupt your circle jerk. "
Leadership by example
Did they mention brutal dictators as well?  Because that's fascinating that all of us were making that mistake comparing Elon to someone that gassed the Kurds based on a clickbait title.  Hmmm...yeah...that's the best explanation.  I completely misunderstood but you have clarity.  
I failed to read a ton a of posts and a clickbait article on an Elon-Ass-Kissing site?  You bet I did.
"Exactly.  ""Free"" flight hours when someone else is paying their share of fuel is pure gold."
"And here I am waiting for the train that's been delayed after 1 and a half hour travelling, because some assholes were walking over the train tracks. "
"Ya‚Äô know, just a normal every day occurrence.  Car pooling is so last century "
Is the owner of the plane Neil H? 
Now I get that hospitals have helipads but surely you can't have tons of doctors clogging up the helipads with their commuter helicopters...where is everyone landing/parking their helicopter during the day?! Like is the hospital just building a field of helipads or something?
"We probably can, but I'm not sure what sort of process with the FAA is involved in heavily modifying certified airplanes. As far as I know the airplane would have to be registered as experimental which has a [whole host of limitations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.319), some of which would require objective flight testing to overcome. For the most part, taking a certified aircraft and registering it as experimental reduces its usefulness considerably."
"It's way harder. With electric you need to spend more money on improving aerodynamics rather than the power train. You simply can't just add more batteries to a cessna 172 at current density levels. 

Maybe starting from a glider would work, but my point is retrofitting is tricky at current battery density levels "
"I understand, I've worked at companies like that before and I can totally understand where you are coming from.

I guess I was just trying to fight back against how many companies/management these days use rhetorics like that to take advantage of employees, i,e the ""You can't complain if you are too busy choking on the Koolaid"" approach :)."
Well it was an analogy and exagerated to prove a point. So it was all made up but why be an adult when we can nick pick.
principatus would be better than ductus
Pretty sure it's aviation grade gasoline not gold ^/s
"And if you had the money to be able to helicopter or planepool to work and save yourself an hour each way, would you? :)"
Or Seymour B? 
"I should have said 3 or 4 instead of several, but the top surgeons pretty much run UAB.  They can make demands. Plus not all of them are parking at the same time"
Probably. 
"Sid Hoffman? 

Or Sid... Frenchman?"
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=VmMyR5ouWhM

congrats rich mf
"Congrats!    


# You know, the age for driving may be lowered with autonomous driving.  Maybe this new driver will need one much sooner than you think!  :|"
Do we know the range of the kid Tesla? Also max speed and time from 0-max? What about charge time?
"OP, congrats and wishing all the best for your family and child! "
The salty comments make me laugh. This is a subreddit for Tesla owners and enthusiasts. Of course there‚Äôs going to be posts from people who own one (or more) Tesla‚Äôs. Congratulations on your new adventure!
oh you rich rich 
"Congrats OP! but as others have pointed out, ""FUNE,"" Just use another font.

&#x200B;"
That's gonna be one spoiled kid! Congrats
Congratulations! 
You may want to research how to store that battery since it'll be 3-4 years before it's used.
This is why I buy Tesla stock. People don‚Äôt take pics like this with Fords.

Just a peasant chiming in. What do you do for a living that affords you the ability to buy 2 Tesla‚Äôs? I need to adjust accordingly after the Navy.

Referred a friend to buy a Tesla. Was then told I wasn‚Äôt eligible to receive kid‚Äôs Tesla due to Ohio laws. Bummer. 
When is Fune?
Are you hiring?  would love to live in a neighborhood like that!

hahaha so great! congratulations!
Congrats!
Great announcement... congratulations!!!
Congrats!!! We did a similar announcement with our motorcycles in 2017.
Congrats! This is awesome!
Congrats on your money I guess
You sound like a douche
"That‚Äôs awesome but also really gross, haha. Don‚Äôt let me bring you down though. Congrats on the news regardless!"
Lmao at all the salty commenters. Cool post OP. Grats on the kid

The new yuppies are awful
Those are Model S's before and after the facelift right? Which is which?
Good for you.......reminds me of that hybrid South Park episode 
"Whoa, those two cars are really big"
"Hate to tell you this, but from what I know about babies they don't have the brain development to drive until at least 4 or 5 months old"
Dude that‚Äôs so nice ! 
"wait, was your announcement going to involve your teslas regardless of the kid car? 

kinda pretentious "
"One *Model S*, one *Model 3*, and one... *model*!"
"haha, nice one!  i like that baby announcement.  congrats!"
Autonomy will be ubiquitous by then. Meaning baby won‚Äôt likely be a driver.
"""Hey look I'm rich"""
Congrats 
"What a good picture, congrats!"
Can you guys adopt me
Bourgeois 
"Congrats! I'm also having a baby in June, I should just steal this for my announcement lol"
Love it. Totally going to borrow this for our next announcement. Now to find two very generous referral donors :)!
Why do people who post cringey shit like this always live in McMansions
You in Arizona? I commonly see photos of houses with those mountainous backgrounds and kinda wanna live there
"This is the most badass way to announce a child that I have ever laid my eyes on.
God bless Reddit, and congratulations on the new little one!"
This is one of the tackiest things I have ever seen. Good job being rich OP! 
Coolest idea I've ever seen for an announcement aaaaaaand I'm stealing the sh*t out of it! Haha 
"Look at all that privilege.

Thanks for paving the way to cheaper EV‚Äôs."
Beautiful cars in a beautiful neighborhood. This is r/pics worthy imo
These are are the things I see on reddit that keep me coming back. Cheers to you and your family!
"Awesome pic and fuck the haters, get on with that big brain of yours and make twice as much money next year my friend.  "
"All the salty ""nice mansion asshole!"" aside, what neighborhood or what city if that is too specific is that? 

We're northeast transplants so its hard to figure out where in the bay area we want to be. Moved to Rocklin just to get into CA, but definitely didn't want to be here long term. Leaning towards Half Moon Bay right now, it has the cool year round climate like SF and the beach she misses from FL, but from what I see god forbid if we sent the kids to public school there."
imagine basing your identity around a car so much that you even make your baby announcments tesla themed....
That‚Äôs awesome congrats!
Wow that is amazing!
Congrats. What city are you in. Neighborhood looks amazing. 
Can i buy one seperate? Im 15 and wanna pimp some out and go wilding with some friends at a smatepark.
"Holy shit, Etiwanda Estates?

Edit: Actually, these aren‚Äôt really in the right position for it. Probably a bit further east from the new Estates at the top of Day Creek. Closer to the Fontana/Rancho border is my new guess; hi neighbor OP"

I feel this is a very valid question. We grew up with electric toy cars but that was before real cars were electric. It would please me to know this is the equivalent of those gas powered rc cars and this baby does about 80 comfortably. Just watch ya legs.

I thought they looked like McMansions in New Mexico or somewhere

"to be fair, posting a picture of your tesla is still going to piss off the jealous types among the remaining 95% or 98% or whatever of the population who can't afford one.

Or just be happy for them.

"That is not a key to success at all.

But not anymore? 
It speaks volumes as to how much time you‚Äôre spending trying to shit on a wholesome Tesla post in the Tesla subreddit. 
"> Discount Tesla owner upset by show of dominane in OP. Should have guessed

How shallow of a human being do you have to be to call a Model 3 owner a ‚Äúdiscount owner‚Äù?  Clearly you don‚Äôt give a shit about the environmental impact of an EV (as you first disingenuously stated), you just care about your appearance and social status. You are a truly sad individual. 

You probably don‚Äôt have any real friends in life, the only company you have are sycophants who use you for your money. "
My folks have a Model S P85. I do love it. I just can‚Äôt afford both yet! :). Thanks..
I mean the mods didn't ban me for it so you're better than the_donald. That deserves some respect.
"I realize that, and I've had to find a delicate balance between pruning my friends list and minding what I post- whether it is about my hobbies, my cars, and even exterior pics of my home.

btw, ""/s"" means sarcasm."
"Eh, true to the extent that you would have to afford servicing that debt at a minimum or else those pictures are all you will have 12 months later. I was raised to be frugal and I'm extremely uncomfortable with my debt, but yet I see people with 10% of my income with 2x, 3x the debt load. I don't get how the stress doesn't kill them."
"I think I know this neighborhood, like the other dude can confirm they aren‚Äôt multi-million. I think when they were going up the lowest was from 800k and up, probably caps at or before two million. So the most expensive could be multi-million but this isn‚Äôt some Beverly Hills type pricing.

Edit: JK, they mostly Max out at 1mil. I know OPs neighborhood, since I live nearby. Home around there is in the 800s. I got confused with the area, there‚Äôs nicer homes west from here that can get close to 2mil."
Definitely not. Much more like $800k-$1.2 million. 
"I'm from California and no way they're that much given the construction and how far out they are (looks like outskirts of Rancho Cucamonga, but could be wrong). Obviously lots of factors, but lots of 4,000 square foot homes there for $1-$1.5MM on the high end. They are certainly nice middle class tract homes though. Again, not trying to disparage OP here at all, it's still very nice!
"
"Believe what you want, but I congratulated OP.  I just particularly care about class differences and the upper class making no attempt to understand those less fortunate.  I'm still not too bothered by the humble brag, but I'm baffled at the comments saying it wasnt a boast."
"Struck a nerve there lol

Did not read though, not even a single word "
"Yea, I became a social media hermit years ago. My wife still has that problem. Like staging a photo to ""look nice"" basically means showing off. Poor people can't find a nice corner for a selfie, they're all shitty corners. Then you get upset that an aunt leaves a comment showing envy and ugliness? The funny thing is this specific instance I'm thinking of she took a picture of an outfit and she was in a store dressing room hallway and the aunt commented about isn't she so lucky to afford expensive outfits and have such a huge house with so many rooms. The fuck woman, I learned to value anonymity and keep shit low key, and you got them thinking I'm Scrooge McFuckinDuck?

I know what /s means, but you either edited it in or I'm an idiot and completely missed it."
Pretty sure this is Lake Elsinore. 
"Yeah California is a big state. it's not million dollar home in Rancho Cucamonga, and would be $10+M in Atherton or Hillsborough"
"Posting a picture of a Model S and a Model 3 isn't a boast in this sub. And while the home is nice, it isn't near as expensive as some of the comments in here suggest, by a long shot. Frankly, if you're easily bothered by people posting pictures of their nice cars, it probably isn't a good idea to hang out around here. "
There‚Äôs nothing in this world I hate more than materialists. 
Exactly. People here think everything is $5 million+. Just people who don't have any actual real estate experience lol. 
Me too
Then you should hate yourself. 
Will do
Good Christmas Present Pick! Enjoy it! üéÖüèªü§∂üèª
Dream car 
i wish i had money as a broke college student :( At least its something to look foward too in the future
I like how the back doors opened up at the same time look like the Tesla T
"Very nice, you will enjoy the ultra white interior. It gets us the best compliments on our Model 3. No staining issues so far, even with denim."
[deleted]
"holy shit. White in white X. ffs! I am REALLY jealous. Good for you, living the dream."
congrats!
Welcome to the crew! Merry Christmas and Congratulations!
What happens when it rains? Does the water get in? 
"Congratulations! We also got our ‚ÄúMarshmello‚Äù last Xmas and have put 18,000 miles on it (a lot for us) in a blink of a year.  Took it on a 10 hour trip to NYC and upstate NY in zero degree weather first week we took delivery. Other than some initial post-delivery adjustments, I have not taken it back to the SC since then (knock on wood).  For zipping around the ‚Äòburbs, taking off from light to light, long range cruising, and ultra modern blingness, there is nothing better.  

Enjoy in good health!"
Congrats and welcome to the fam! 
Exactly the color scheme I would order (Arizona) - looks sharp \_as hell\_. 
"Welcome! If you wanna share your story I am
Building up a site for sharing people‚Äôs Tesla stories (Tesla Diaries) Just send me a message üí™"
i got the same car. WELCOME. 
Super congrats!!!! I‚Äôm loving mine! Welcome to the family.
"I just put the deposit down for a white on white Model X today!  Hoping delivery and paperwork doesn‚Äôt take too long, can‚Äôt wait to drive it!"
Congratulations ! We are picking up our X and T3 on Wednesday. 
Welcome :) It's the best car I've ever driven :)
Lucky bastard!
This is the cleanest looking car out there. The white on white is the perfect combo. One day I will be able to say I own one of these 
Congrats! 
You officially have the same car as a rock star. Congrats!
I‚Äôve got the X in the storm trooper color too. It‚Äôs a great car. Nothing else quite like it.
"Nice colour combo!
"
"My question about this Tesla Model X, and maybe the others.  Is there any safety feature within the car that will prevent it from driving or moving while the doors are open like this?  Such as if someone starts it, slams on the pedal to get the car moving, and nothing happens until all of the doors are securely closed?!  What would happen if you‚Äôre rolling down the freeway at 70mph and a passenger opens a door?  Does the car slow down and stop, or do the doors stay locked while in motion?"
 Very cool 
Literally one of the coolest cars out right now that's not say a supersport. I'm itching to drive one so badly. Congrats
Sweet! My DeLorean does that!
Congrats üéàüéâ 
"Congrats, awesome! "
Enjoy. It's a great family! 
"Congrats, cant wait to get one for my family. "
Congrats!  Beautiful car. I‚Äôm sure you will love it.  
Goals üòç
Gorgeous! Congrats :)
Which X and congrats! I love mine. It's a better driving than anything I've driven. 
Welcome to the fam...fam! Hope you love it and have a great Christmas! 
"I was sitting at the Supercharger this week and this woman and her friend drove in with some random ICE SUV, in front of every Tesla. She was flapping her wings like a crazy-woman, trying to get each driver to open their falcon doors. The problem was, no one was in an X at the time, so everyone just shook their heads until she moved on to the next driver.  It was rather amusing."
Gorgeous! Congrats and welcome to the family!
What if it rains sideways into the whip ? 
Welcome to the family! 
"This is the car i dream of owning, not the s or the 3 or the y , just this car, forget ferrari or lambo this car will be mine when i can afford it , i.e when i win the lottery as there is no way i will ever as a disabled person be able to save enough money to buy one even second hand."
"Welcome to the X club!  My wife‚Äôs got a seven seat config and we were blown away when we realized we could comfortably put 6 adults in there. We had assumed the third row would just be for kids but nope! Great space use inside. 

Be sure you don‚Äôt catch a curb with a wheel... I was leaning toward graphite till seeing some darker options with curb rash rolling around town. 

"
"Beautiful. Congratulations. 

Maybe in several more years..."

"Do white interiors give anyone else anxiety?

I mean, it looks fantastic but I‚Äôm worried about wear/longevity "
lol no thanks
"Thank you all! We love it so far! Out of a few different brands I had a pleasure to own, this one is the best."
"im holding out for when the roadster comes out and i randomly have $200,000+ to spend"
Mine too. 
"Same here! Really any Tesla, but model X is by far my favorite!"
Same
Also broke college student here. I don't think I'll be able to afford a used 3 much less an X :(
Huh. I never really noticed that until now.
"What kind of cleaning have you been doing to keep the interior pristine, if I may ask? I really love the white interior but would be super worried about getting it permanently scuffed or something."
I was hesitant to get the white at first but then decided yolo :)
I didn't know denim stains were a thing until I noticed it on my light beige leather interior. Any suggestions for cleaning it off? 
I couldn‚Äôt imagine the white interior with my kids! 
"Youre lucky, jeans love to stain the left collar of the seat. The white scares me, but im sure its just people that dont protect their seats either."
"OK we have to stop naming white cars ""stormtrooper"""
It does look like an Imperial vehicle of some kind.
Oh yea nobodys ever done that before
This baby is Lil Tron :)
Thank you! Merry Christmas!
I'd guess less due to basically having an overhang over the opening.
"Yes, same as a regular car when the door opens."
You can stand under the door and stay dry while buckling the kids in.
"Light rain is ok, but it rained pretty heavily with wind a few weeks ago and my car seats were basically buckets. It's not an ideal vehicle for a lot of rain"
Light rain isn‚Äôt bad but if it‚Äôs coming down good I prefer regular doors. We keep a towel in the back area for the quick seat wipe down in situations like that. Also have to be mindful of water that runs in when you first open it. 
Thank you
Thank you. I think this combo looks great but I also considered gray with black wheels.
Done
"How is it on cargo space? My company is buying me a car since I need to move some suitcase sized equipment to clients, and I am considering scooping this SUV. How does it compare to maybe say an SUV like a Jeep Grand Cherokee or Ford Explorer?"
Nice!!!
Happy to contribute to ‚Äútransition to renewable energy ‚Äú in the sexiest way possible 
Congratulations! I feel your excitement 
Congratulations!
I agree
Good questions! When I‚Äôm letting my kids out before I drive into a garage... there is a big red warning that says something about doors are open proceed with caution. This leads me to believe it won‚Äôt prevent me from moving. In terms of attempting opening the doors while driving: I doubt they will open but I enabled ‚Äúkid lock‚Äù so the kids don‚Äôt open the doors in any case
"It'll let you drive with it open, but it will try to alert you. If you don't pay attention to the alerts and drive into an obstruction, you're in for a bad day: https://youtu.be/NKxQDh7yN0k"
"Doug DeMuro was goofing around with an X for one of his YouTube videos a year or so ago and show that they do indeed stay open while moving.  No idea if anyone has even attempted opening one at high speed, you could do serious damages to the falcon wings alignment by doing that, even being slightly off they can scuff and damage paint while closing along the interior edge."
Thank you
delorean has gullwing doors. these are falconwing doors
Yes! It‚Äôs amazing 
Thank you 
100% 
Thank you! Merry Christmas 
Haha it feels like Tesla owners are in some kind of biker club :) I already noticed people driving Tesla wave at me as they pass by
Thank you!
"I am almost done purchasing my p100d model x.  I work in a essentially customer support role in IT.  One of the people I helped recently makes well over six figures and is 100% blind.  If you can dream it, it can happen."
Darnit!
Gull wing doors.
wear and tear and staining is BETTER on the white interior
They are actually really holding up well for me. No staining at all and you can't see any wear because of the white color. Even indents from car seats are hard to see
I‚Äôm worried too but time will tell. I did put some seat covers (backless) so we at least save the button part of the seats
Only 10 more to go!
I think you will. My parents immigrated here with $100 in the pocket when I was 15. I worked hard to get here and it took me 6 years just to get through the community college.
"Hang in there lol I thought the same. Now I'm only 27 with a brand new house and a P3D.

Just get a good major in college and start working hard when you graduate and you'll advance quickly."
Unscented baby wipes work extremely well for me and they‚Äôre dirt cheap. 
I use [this leather cleaner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JIIZCM6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_1HeiCbE82QQDR) on my white interior and it works wonders! Removes all stains.
"I wipe it down with a warm, damp cloth (only water) about once a week along while vacuuming the car. If I notice stains, I use ONR. Cleaning the car makes me happy :)"
"For semi-permanent protection lookup CarPro CQuartz Leather 30mL on Amazon.  It provides a heavy duty protection good for 1-2 years.  Made by the same company that does the popular Ceramic coating for paint.  It‚Äôs what I used on my X‚Äôs ultra white seats too as you will very rarely see a little die transfer if someone has new/damp jeans.

As far as cleaning almost anything works, just stay away from anything with harsh chemicals, they aren‚Äôt needed and can damage the seats.  Baby wipes, alcohol wipes, most top brands of interior cleaner (check ingredients).

I also picked up a pair of Leader Accessories  Waterproof Sweat Towel Front Bucket Seat Covers on Amz, just to throw over the seats during bad weather or if someone hops in wet from water park, etc."
"That‚Äôs the best way to decide on it, ultra white makes it look like a spaceship."
Age of your car?
"I have 5 kids, got my Model X with the same color configuration as OP back in March, and haven't had any trouble keeping it clean. One poster mentioned unscented baby wipes; they actually do work really well."
I couldn't imagine it even without kids. 
‚ÄúMagic Eraser‚Äù works like a charm on jeans stains on my white seats. You might even say it‚Äôs magic. 
"Well, they never hit anything so I'm all for an army of stormtroopers"
Is there a big Tron?
"Cargo space is smaller than a Cherokee or Explorer (assuming 3rd row is folded down), mostly because of the shape of the back (sloped roof).

However it does come with an option to get captain seats, which is what we have in ours, that I highly recommend. I have 2 small kids so having both back seats occupied by car seats and then still being able to easily use the 3rd row is very helpful. However when the 3rd row is occupied, don't expect to fit much in the back
"
"Your company is going to agree to buy you a $84,000 car?"
"You need to get the 5 or 7 seat configuration to have the full lay flat trunk area, and it has massive cargo area options I‚Äôd think would be significant over a Jeep or Ford.

Additional selling point should be the tax deductions as the Model X should still classify as a work vehicle if that hasn‚Äôt changed for 2019 you could deduct up to 50% or so if the price depending on work mileage.

Also if you don‚Äôt need the extra height and would prefer little extra range and slightly lower cost (but no added tax advantage) look at a Model S.  You‚Äôd be amazed at the storage possible in the S after folding the seats flat as well, easily move a lot of cargo in it, even Tesla Mobile service techs used modded S‚Äôs for their calls."
The dude has a Delorean. He‚Äôs too busy fending off his mom‚Äôs sexual advances to listen to what bird his doors were named after. 
As a graduated and working person i still see this as a pretty far fetched dream
Any hope for a CS major/Networking minor with some work experience?
2 years
It's sandpaper
Oof
"I mean, yeah. o o"
Oh yah when I get a semi :)
They will cover up to $450 a month so I am responsible for the rest.
I was poor for most of my life and it's strange how quickly the scales can tip. After getting a new job and investing money like an actual adult things flipped in about 3 years.
"Absolutely. If you're a computer science major and do we you'll me making 100k+ in no time.

I was mechanical engineering major so you should be better off than me lol. I wish I would've done computer science (hindsight 20/20)"
"I would try ONR (Optimum No Rinse). You mix an ounce in two gallons of warm water. With a damp towel, wipe the areas affected. The longer the stain is there, the higher chance it won‚Äôt come out."
"Well thanks for the encouragement.

And congrats on the house and car :)"
Haha thanks. You'll get there in no time. Keep it up! Good future ahead of you.
"I assume this is going to require the HW3.0 hardware, so ""soon"" for us normal folks is probably still a long ways away."
"Folks ‚Äúno driver input‚Äù is not the same as not paying attention and maintaining oversight. 

NoA in EAP can take you from on ramp to off ramp with ‚Äúno driver input.‚Äù"
"If a Tesla can navigate a roundabout, I‚Äôd give it major props, as I have very rarely seen any person that goes into one that knows what the hell they‚Äôre doing. "
"I wonder how long ""soon"" is.  

Definitely a feature many are looking forward towards.

I don't think we should expect anything for at least the next 6 months or so."
I'll believe it when I see it. That would be a magnitude more complex than Tesla's current autopilot software.
"Waymo could read signs 2 years ago, and they're still not ready to take the driver out.  We may find that driving simply experiences challenges requiring human-level intelligence at too high a rate to fully automate without something approaching human-level AI.

Answering the question ""Is something in the way"" and ""will something be in the way"" at acceptable rates could simply require a general intelligence system that's capable of understanding the characteristics of most objects and their behavior.  "
"So far my experience has been that it'll put itself in the wrong lane entirely for an exit even for places that Teslas must be very commonly traveling to. For example, if you're trying to get to the JFK Supercharger on I-678 the navigation system will even show that the upcoming exit is a left sided exit. But then Navigate on Autopilot will insist that you go in the rightmost lane and then it'll try to take an entirely different exit even while the navigation system is showing that the correct exit is on the left. This makes no sense whatsoever. Then on numerous other exits it's just not able to get into the correct lane in time, or it spazzes out and doesn't make the lane change into the actual exit lane from the rightmost lane.

So far it works something like 30% of the time for me more than anything else, lol."
We saw a video of this two years ago. Why say they are testing now?
"I'd interpret that as ""Soon, it will be possible for your car to get from home to work without driver control"" the same way as claiming on-ramp to off-ramp can work now. Sure, in ideal conditions it's possible to work exactly like that. But as it is, it must be closely monitored and still likely need to be overridden one or more times during the trip.

Still a great improvement to make it possible at all, but a ways to go before it could be trusted to do it without close oversight."
Soon^tm
"The problem with creeping up on level 3 is that it gets more dangerous, not less. The car has to become MORE vigilant to make sure you're paying attention, not less.

A person actually engaged in driving has a reaction time measured in tenths of a second. A person with an orange wedged in the wheel because the car can do 95% of the driving is, perhaps, seconds away from reacting. You're lengthening the reaction time by like 100 times and that gets *worse* as the car gets *better*.

This is why a lot of car companies are trying to figure out how to basically skip level 3 (or even really good level 2) and go right to 4. A lot of car companies could do moderately OK level 3 right now but they cripple the software down to Level 2 because of the increased risk of people not paying attention.

I guess kudos to Tesla for taking this risk and continuing on even though people have already been killed by being distracted while on autopilot. However, the blowback of a really bad crash could set back autonomous driving by a decade, maybe more. This isn't like most tech improvements where a little bit better is better. In the case of autonomous driving every little bit better, short of level 4, actually makes it worse."
"I can imagine Tesla engineers reading this announcement and going ""Jeez thanks Elon, that's even more pressure I have to deal with to get this shit done"""
SOON? SOON?!?!?!
Buying the chip upgrade as soon as available. 
"‚ÄúD*mn, my car left without me again‚Äù"
Stop over promising and under delivering.   
This explains all the random capthca I've been getting lately having to identify the stupid traffic lights and stop signs. 
How do you guys keep believing this stuff? 
"5 years maybe, 10 years definitely."
"If this is truly working in development cars, Tesla‚Äôs stock may just be undervalued by about $100 billion dollars. $TSLA at $1000 a share! But here‚Äôs a huge difference between recognizing something like a stop sign and making all the right decisions when you stop at one, so we‚Äôll see, but very hopeful. "
Given how horrible Navigate on autopilot i'm going to say this is highly doubtful.......... soon as in maybe in another vehicle and years from now.
soon‚Ñ¢
"FSD prepay here, so 100% committed and excited. That being said, I still have too many close calls on EAP to honestly believe this is happening anytime soon given the way more complex task.

edit: just saw the video linked below and damn.. that does look good. Hope springs eternal."
Now in this thread we play the ‚ÄúDo we believe Elon Musk this time or not?‚Äù game
"We still don't even have NoA lanr switching without driver confirmation.  I don't see this happening unless software running on HW 3 is already sophisticated, which I doubt.

Also, I wonder what the power consumption of HW 3 is, since it is 10x more powerful than 2.5?  Seems like it could be rather significant, maybe 500 watts for the whole system?  Makes a difference in consumption"
Waymo has spent almost a decade dedicated to this and they still need human back up drivers. It‚Äôs not happening soon.
my tesla was supposed to drive itself from new york to LA over a year ago. it can drive in a circle sometime soon. awesome.
Soon. In a couple years.
"You keep using that word ""soon"" Elon. I don't think it means what you think it means.

Nothing against the Tesla engineers, they may be close to level 5 driving in development but that doesn't mean the average person can use that technology. It will require law changes first and that never happens quickly and can be described as happening ""soon""."
"Awesome, this is great news"
How is this any different from FSD?
I ponied up for the fsd capability and I could not be more butt cised
How about that cross country drive?
"Challenge accepted. I work in a medieval town centre with narrow, cobblestone streets, where every third street is closed off due to construction. 

Good luck with that."
[deleted]
"Second sentence is 100% bullshit.  And is a straight up lie.  The idea that the car will ""soon"" drive and park itself over long distances is just silly when summon still runs into stationary objects and the car still tries to dart into exit ramps."
"There's going to be a time (coming very soon) between where we are right now, and the emergence of fully autonomous ride-shares with no drivers, where your commute will entail nothing but sitting and listening to music as you watch the road. I think that's still an incredible achievement which everybody would have called science-fiction ten or twenty years ago.

The moment when you don't actually need to pay attention, allowing you to look down and read a book or surf the internet will come later. At that point, you'll still need to be in the drivers' seat and be required to respond to any request by the system for intervention. Obviously this isn't what Musk is talking about here yet, but it'll come eventually and likely a lot sooner than driverless taxis.

The driverless taxis will fundamentally change the economics of ride-sharing, car ownership, and put a lot of people out of work. But well before that self-driving technology will be making plenty of people's daily commutes safer and more convenient. "
Comin' in to work parking lot hot at 50mph over speed bumps
Which first?  HW3 or M3 SR?  Both next Spring?
WHEN IS SOON!!!??
"Glad to hear it. To be honest, given that Tesla was talking about doing a trial coast to coast AP run, I was kind of surprised that EAP wasn't detecting and stopping at red lights. Hopefully we'll see a better EAP soon!"
Getting a tech chubby.
I'm still too scared to let my Tesla switch lanes... Is AP and lane changes on highways second nature to you guys now? 
"Driverless cars will be the end of uber and loft as we know it.

Though they are both investing heavily in their own driverless technology!"
"For me and many others there isn't much as far as complicated turns and roads between home and work, just a handful of stop lights, the on and off ramp of the interstate and a stop sign or two. Even if that is all Tesla can accomplish on auto pilot it would be a huge deal because although it might be the easiest drive I have to do, I do it 2 times a day, 5 days a week and I lothe it."
Hopefully will also include train tracks and avoiding debris!
But I just got my driver license...
"*""Africa""- Toto softly plays in the background*"
I can‚Äôt wait for FSD. My bank account can wait. But I can‚Äôt wait haha. 
"NoA has been kind of weird with me. It always suggests for me to get in the left lane to ""follow the route"" after most exits and before the next merge point. I understand the ""get over so people can merge"" but no one is merging. I feel it needlessly wants to ride in the left lane. I have it set to average or mild speed based lane changes.

I-20 and I-55 in Mississippi for more info."
"This is wonderful news. I didn't expect it this soon. The ability to summon your conveyance as needed is a real game changer. Think of the effect on real estate for parking garages, a hitherto license to print money. You won't need to leave your car in a garage while you work or play in a city. Likewise, private homes may no longer need attached garages. If we combine all of this with the idea of self-driving shuttle vehicles, an idea I think Elon has talked about for a while, a vehicle that will pick up, let's say, a dozen commuters from a residential neighborhood, we're taking vastly diminished traffic, not to mention the environmental benefits."
"Just because the system can understand and follow the rules of the road doesn't mean it'll be an adequate driver.  We've seen from Waymo those things follow the rules, aren't typically at fault on accidents, but they annoy the hell out of drivers and get rear ended a lot.

It's a step towards FSD, but I'm curious to know where they are when it comes to handling the intangibles of driving.  Remember, driving decisions aren't Neural Network based.  As far as we know, only image recognition is, and possibly synthesis of the camera NNs (AKNet)."
Daddy
"I‚Äôm afraid this is empty rhetoric.  I know they are working on FSD, but why use words like ‚Äòsoon‚Äô when it will likely be years away.  I have no basis in fact for asserting that of course, just a track record since I‚Äôve been an owner and many false dawns. Heck even the on ramp to off ramp promised for August hasn‚Äôt materialised yet (apart from a brief moment for early access programme folks and only in US)."
"Meanwhile, is everyone at the latest update yet or are some of you still waiting for it because I haven‚Äôt received the latest software update yet."
"You Tesla ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù amaze me.  If you want to truly connect with a car, get one with a 6 speed manual, internal combustion engine and a drop top.

If you want the car to drive itself, install an app for Uber or Lyft.  Then, use the app to save yourself 6 figures over the course of the next 3 years.  No confirmations for a lane change, mother Tesla link ups or risk of having to get HW3.0.  "
This is the same guy that said in 2016 that cross-country summon was ~2 years away.  Does anyone still actually believe what he says?
"Just straight up deceiving his customers. He's not even being coy about it anymore.

Case in point; He called the currently released NAP version ""mind blowing"". Which can't change lanes, takes exits into barriers, emergency lane shoulder and miss exits, routinely. 

&#x200B;"
"Prove me wrong, Elon!"
Once it can actually navigate through [Dupont Circle](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dupont_Circle_in_Washington_DC_aerial_photo.jpg) (with its twisted traffic-lights-*inside*-a-roundabout configuration) during peak rush-hour ... I'm all in ...
Obviously all remains to be seen and we all know Elon likes to over promise based on his most optimistic projections. However I remeber on one of his last interviews he stated he thought they would achieve FSD late 2019 after the HW3 update and software update to put the new computing power to work. Well see what caveats there are though

We still don't have V1.0 NoA."

First I would like if my Tesla can follow traffic speed signs.
"How to tell what hardware I have? I mentioned that this is possible with v3 hardware, not based on nvidia. 
Never mind. Just saw above, v2 and above has hw3"
I thought Teslas with autopilot could already understand (is that the right word?) traffic lights and stop signs.
"LOL. I want to see them do a test with traffic in SF downtown. 

With all the erratic traffic, construction, pedestrians, and crazy intersections I guarantee this will not work in the next 5 maybe even 10 years. "
"""with no driver input at all."" except touching the steering wheel every 30 seconds? or will they actually remove that restriction?
"
What about diverging diamonds?
"Find it highly unlikely that they are leaps and bounds ahead of google. 

Would love it to be true but the fact they Tesla is only using cameras makes me think it is unlikely. "
[deleted]
Traffic congestion increases as oil consumption drops.
Soon? I think not. 
OK. I'm so poor and will never own a Tesla so I know nothing about it...I already thought it did all of that..??
"I've said it a million times, I will sign my soul, my life, and my firstborn to you if I can become a beta tester for dev builds. 

u/ElonMusk "
"When Tesla's start making right hand turns in urban areas with high or hidden or surprise curbs, I wonder how Tesla will deal with people complaining that FSD ""curbed"" their rims. "
Not in the rain it won't
"Too many times he's cried wolf. Bullshit.

Tesla has claimed no culpability for AP crashes 

-Because the driver intervened

-Because the driver did not intervene

So who wants to be first to hand over control and liability of their own and others' lives?

Fucking irresponsible."
[deleted]
Musk hasn‚Äôt even addressed the [trolley problem](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) yet and he still has the nerve to say this?
I love wrecking into teslas with rental cars 
"He does say it requires the HW3.0 hardware a few tweets down.

https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1071846591693090816"
"HW3 will be available around Q1 so 3 months maybe, 6 months definitely."
Does that mean this won't be just a software update?
HardWare 3.0 hardware?
"When talking about full self drive, a few years away is soon. The big deal here is that it is happening, or continuing to happen, that its not just wishful thinking that they did not run in to a brick wall and so far so good so to speak. I swear, if Elon ever builds a time machine or a warp drive and is a few months or years late he will get shit for it... Full self drive is one of the holy grails of technology."
"Decades.
  
Sooner than that $35 k model 3 tho"
I wish they would've called it HW 2.8 or 2.9 or something. 3.0 Makes it seem like an entirely new hardware suite but it's just the processing unit which was designed to be replaceable. 
[deleted]
"Yay. ""Soon"" we will all be able to be driving instructors rather than drivers. Huzzah.

It's not a useful thing until we can ignore it and do email or read a book."
Then autonomous cars are a gleaming fraud that pass their failures on to drivers who will inevitably not pay attention. Humans can't do this. They aren't built to wait for a robot to fail. Just let the human drive.
I want to see it navigate this fuckup: [http://i.imgur.com/HIq9cYA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/HIq9cYA.jpg)
Found the American.
"Roundabouts or traffic circles are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Any country that has plenty of it is a sign to me of an evolved society that gets it. If you don‚Äôt get how nice it is to yield merge and not be required to do a full stop, you haven‚Äôt been places."
I think a round about would be relatively easy for computers compared to four way stops or other types of interchanges. 
"Just close your eyes, mash the accelerator, and hope for the best. 

Likely that‚Äôs how Tesla handles it, also. "
"The Magic Roundabout! 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Roundabout_(Swindon)"
"It's always boggled my mind that they are demonstrably more efficient, yet -- as a driver -- scary as hell."
"I once didn't know what the hell I was doing. In France I entered a roundabout, and when I was about to exit I notice *a red light on the exit!* WTF! I still don't know what  that was about. I ran the red light."
"If a Tesla‚Äôs sister company can go to Mars n back like a piece of cake, the real discussion is about Tesla car, here on Earth, going around a roundabout, lol, I‚Äôm sure it will be here in no time"
I was just thinking the same thing today as I went through a roundabout with one lane blocked by a police vehicle. If Tesla could navigate this safely then major kudos.
It took about 3 or 4 years for the first roundabout in my town to become normal enough that it no longer confounds many drivers.
"Go to England, they work just fine there..."
Well which ones though. I live in California there are a few single lane roundabouts and one multilane roundabout in Long Beach. That one is confusing 
Waymo has been handling roundabouts in Phoenix for at least a year now
"Elon, being part of SpaceX, talks in terms of Universe time, so ""soon"" can be anytime in the next few months to several million years."
[deleted]
this will require the new AI chip for sure. which will likely be introduced at the end of spring
I live on a dirt road so I doubt I'll get to work without input within the next 10 years unless I move 
"I just want   
  
  * my car to actually read speed limit signs   
  * use high beams correctly   
  * at a stop end the dancing cars near me   
  * use the wipers to my benefit, not its own     
  * its okay car, that is just a shadow  
  
seriously AP 2.5 hardware and the current software can be damn scary at times"
"2 years ago he said the cars would be able to come to you from anywhere, ‚Äúsoon‚Äù. Still hasn‚Äôt happened. "
Three months maybe six months definitely.
"Yea I was a believer that fsd was just around the corner when I got my MS two years ago ago. Now, in my new M3, I‚Äôm absolutely convinced that we‚Äôre a lot farther away than Tesla lets on. The system is a neat novelty that mostly works ok in a certain subset of situations, but it‚Äôs clear there is no way the current hardware is ever going to be able to ‚Äúdrive itself‚Äù. The acuity of the cameras isn‚Äôt fine enough to detect fucking rain accurately, how in the world is it going to see a vehicle coming quickly from a little too far away on a 90 degree intersection? Color me skeptical."
"Machine learning models are driven by data. Tesla has over [1 billion miles](https://electrek.co/2018/11/28/tesla-autopilot-1-billion-miles/) driven on autopilot, which is an enormous amount of data for them to churn on in google and amazon's cloud to continually create better and better models. ML is one of those things where it sucks for a very long time, but once you get it right, further improvements happen much much faster."
"Not really, I can already get to work with just 4 manual turns.

The bulk of the foundation for doing this is already laid, that's why they can go from NoA to this in 'soon' time."
"Remember that driving in the city at low speeds with a driver behind the wheel always ready to take over is not as hard as it sounds.

Sign and light recognition is the hard part here."
"This isn't taking the driver out just like NoA doesn't take the driver out.

Driving definitely doesn't require 'human' level intelligence, this is why we have road rules, lanes, walled off highways, et... without a rigid system humans actually suck at driving. Not to mention how we get tired and distracted and a machine doesn't."
Not the same software. 
In Elon's time. 
"People are killed everyday by human drivers. Lots of people. What if AI killed a lot less people than human drivers? Should we reject ""better"" because it's not perfect?  "
That is what Elon wants. 
"This is ""Elon-soon""."
"I thought the upgrade, cameras and chip, were already paid for by those that have paid for FSD?"
"Thinking I'll buy too, but after I see some good reviews once it's released and ready for prime time. Then again if they offered ""sale"" close to original $3k price... Boy I'd be tempted to do it sooner. If they start $5k+, I'll prob hold off year or two. "
A fool and his money are parted
"This begs the question, once AI knows everything we know and more what are we going to use as captcha images?"
I don‚Äôt.
Every 18 months or so he says it‚Äôs coming soon. My car still can‚Äôt consistently change lanes on a well lit road with no other cars around. It‚Äôs never going to FSD. 
"I learned.  
For now their cars are the best on the road to drive.  
At some point they will be the best to not drive.   
Probably a ways off though.  "
It‚Äôs a cult. What do you expect? Eats whatever shit Elon  puts out and then forgets about 2 or 3 months afterwards.
I take 4 turns to get to work 12 miles away now. The question is how do you not?
He isn't talking about FSD but NoA on steroids (which will be relatively easy once they get good at recognizing signs and traffic lights).
https://vimeo.com/192179727

Real easy to take his tweets like those of Trump and be delightfully surprised whenever he does deliver.
I‚Äôd say no.
My guess is that they have started over multiple times. Computer vision -> deep learning etc.
"I think it does. It says no driver input, not no driver. Granted with Elon‚Äôs eye on the long game, soon to him could be another year or two to us. "
"You are wrong on that one.

Elon is talking about a level 2/3 system that drives on its own but forces the driver to still pay attention the whole time.

Think of it like the current version on steroids. When it works as advertised you don't have to intervene at all, the car does all the driving for you."
Is English his first language? 
Still have to monitor the system and keep your eyes on the road. 
Isn't that what it is?
Hopefully it will be released before you buy a new car.
Don‚Äôt worry about that. Elon forgot about it so you should as well. Or maybe in 10 +years 
"Haha. Last time I asked about that, someone argued they already accomplished it. They're probably in this thread somewhere, saying Elon always meets his deadlines and never over promises or under delivers."
"""edge cases"""
You must not read this sub very much. The vast majority of people here believe every word Elon says no matter how ridiculous and out of reality it is. 
"Pressing X now, sir"
This sub just eats whatever shit Elon throws at them. Kind of like brainless idiots who believe scammers.
"Summon had nothing to do with autopilot function, it only uses ultrasonic proximity sensor and nothingelse"
"In addition to what others have said, what Tesla have in development internally is totally different and probably way more advanced than what is available to the public. "
"Your comment history is 100% bullshit.

Elon is describing the current EAP on steroids where the car drives on its own but still requires the driver to monitor everything the car does and intervene if needed.

Once the car understands stop signs and traffic lights and works as good as EAP works at the moment on the highways (ie. good enough) the car will be able to drive on its own but if it does something stupid the driver will take over.

This isn't FSD and Elon is making sure he doesn't promise anything like that. In this case the ""no driver input"" is the key."
"This is the exact failure mode: it's good enough to train you that you don't need to pay attention. (e.g. 365 consecutive commutes all perfect). 

But not good enough to have a low crash rate with drivers not paying attention. e.g. Every day, 1 in every 366 drivers has an incident.

Call it the You You Xue effect."
"Think of how this will literally change society however... Think of those disabled who might have trouble with driving however are of a sane mind. I'm sure everyone knows that older person who is sweet as can be, but absolutely dangerous on the road. My grandfather was one of those people, and finally my parents took away his keys (when he was late 70s). Our current laws don't make it illegal to be old and impaired on the road even when it is obvious they shouldn't be driving due to slowed reaction times. This allows those stubborn and independent elders to safely drive (by not driving!) around and maintaining their independence.  


Also think of those rare but critical times when someone has a medical emergency. Say someone is driving on the freeway and BOOM they have a heart attack or a stroke. I forsee a future (some time down the line due to obvious privacy concerns) where the car drives you to the closest ER and perhaps even notifies them you're on the way. These sorts of things are literally society changing, and are worth the pains to get to."
Next year.
Yes. 
It's about 80% there. The cancelled already in progress lane changes for no apparent reason are the only dangerous things I've experienced and I typically just grab the wheel and force the lane shift when that happens.
Telsa will take the shares from Uber and Lyft if they offer uber-like ride-sharing services sooner or later.
Yes to the features no to the timeline.
I mean he wasn't incorrect. It's not perfect but it does what it says on the tin and does it quite well.
Get back to us when you have an original thought blabby. Oh and say hi to that guy from Mobile Eye for us!
You‚Äôre getting downvote even though you speak the truth. Lmao this sub can‚Äôt take any criticism like Elon. 
"Is there any other consumer cars on the market that can do the same? I think it is pretty mind blowing, it's not a lie to be more easily impressed than you."
Thats a pretty high bar considering half of DC's human drivers can't do it properly right now.  T
"> they would achieve FSD late 2019

Yeah, that's not happening."
You mean V9?
V3 is coming out as standard hardware around mid 2019. At that point you will get the hardware free if you upgrade to FSD.
"The software may he there to recognize them, but it is not basing any of the driving decisions off of them yet."
"While they might very well see & understand, they don't interpret or act upon that understanding; the software hasn't connected the left brain to the right brain yet, so to say. "
"Why? For some chunk of people, paying $10 for per ride would still make a lot more sense than buying (and maintaining) a $40,000 car

I don't understand why some people here think Waymo and Tesla can't mutually exist ..."
"Eh, they have a completely different business model and their current design philosophy fits that.  "
"Can confirm, I do."
That's hardly something you need to address for self driving cars. How many trolley problem encounters do you have per million miles?
How many have you taken out?

So current Teslas can be upgraded with the new processor?
"Do you happen to have a source saying the first quarter of 2019?  All I could find was something saying the second quarter.

[> Ultimately, Tesla‚Äôs progress on its Autopilot suite comes amidst the company‚Äôs focus in the development and eventual rollout of its Full Self-Driving suite, which is expected to happen in the second quarter of 2019.](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-hardware-3-upgrade-full-self-driving-neural-net-support/)"
Could easily take a year to retrofit existing cars with the new computer...Tesla won't want to take that financial hit over a very short period of time...and probably will want to wait 3-6 months before starting retrofits to ensure the chip is relative bug free.
Can't download more RAM
"So were the FSD packages sold with the knowledge that the car had to be brought in for a part swap at a later date?  I'm a bit confused as I thought FSD Teslas had everything they needed already, but maybe I read ""all the sensors needed"" and assumed that was everything."
"They seem to be (roughly) using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/); it makes sense to change the major version when going to the new hardware, as it unlocks new functionality. "
"I think it's justified to call it 3.0, since the replaced hardware is a new chip architecture, with much, much higher performance.

It took significant effort to develop it."
"I'm ok with not confirming lane changes, but it needs to try and keep the car as far right (or left) as possible based, based on country of course. The only time I've seen it recommend moving right was when I was in the middle lane, someone was to my left, and it really wanted to pass, which is also not a scenario it should do."
I can wait. The current suggestions for changing lanes are pretty bad. 
Not even then. It can‚Äôt handle lane merges or splitting without freaking out. EAP has a long way to go still.
"Yes but that‚Äôs coming for NoA. Still might be FSD-capabilities but requiring driver attention at all times, despite ‚Äúno input.‚Äù

I think it‚Äôll get there I‚Äôm just trying to be realistic about how it‚Äôs probably going to roll out. "
"I‚Äôm confused by it sometimes, it asks to confirm lane changes and some exits,  it also takes some exits without confirmation needed"
"hmm, based on the amount of bogus lane changing my car wants to do, I'm good with confirming for the near future as it continues to improve performance...at least 1/3 of suggested lane changes are spurious."
"In its current state, I would not trust unattended lane changes for the following reasons:

- Sometimes half-way through the lane change, it gets scared and immediately jerks back into the original lane. This happens a lot even when there are no cars around.

- It does not handle moderate to heavy traffic on lane changes well. Bay area traffic is pretty bad and NoA and auto lane changes is almost useless when theres enough cars around

- When driving down to San Diego, it kept wanting me to lane change into the HOV lane when there were clearly double lane markings

- Tesla's navigation engine is still subpar and will have you make stupid exits to only get right back on the highway since it thinks you might save time (but in reality, it would take much longer).  I wouldn't want it to move me out of the HOV lane and take a stupid exit.

- In relation to above, if NoA thinks youre exiting (but I decided to stay on the highway), sometimes it drops the max speed significantly for the exit. This is dangerous.

I have filed bug reports almost everytime. But Im at the point where I rarely confirm lane changes since they're either bad changes or I dont want to deal with having to correct it."
"> I can‚Äôt wait until I don‚Äôt have to confirm every time.

I can't wait until I don't have to confirm every time and don't get blamed by /r/teslamotors when my car moves into something and gets in a wreck because I was inattentive."
Quite
doesnt matter. Lane changing is useless in most scenarios the way it does it now.
"I'll say that it's less hassle to supervise the car while on autopilot than to drive it yourself. Although I agree that full autonomy is a long way off, I can see the current autopilot getting progressively better at handling more situations without human input."
I strongly disagree. Supervising Autopilot is far easier and safer than driving myself. Have you taken long highway drives with and without it? It makes a massive difference.
"If it lowers accident rates, is that useful?"
"No, you‚Äôre staying an opinion that a technology should not be put to use, even under supervision, until it can function 100% without supervision. That‚Äôs one option. It‚Äôs not the only option and doesn‚Äôt make anything a fraud. "
Tesla‚Äôs autopilot data says otherwise. 
Is that a Falcon 9 landing pad? Fuck that looks like a shit show. 
Can humans even navigate that thing?
"That‚Äôs what‚Äôs known as the ‚ÄúMagic Roundabout‚Äù in the town of Swindon in England. I‚Äôve been through it, it‚Äôs actually way easier to navigate than it looks. It‚Äôs basically several smaller roundabouts all together. Just know to give way to your right and you can breeze through it. "
Most likely completely avoiding this place is always the best solution!
[deleted]
"wtf, is that real? I can make very little sense of that roundabout"
Magic roundabout
My satnav had a meltdown trying to tell me how to get round it the first time I went to Swindon.
"Phhhht. Easy. I've been around that on a bicycle. 

...Only required 1 change of underwear....

(slightly more seriously: Most of the time it's easy to navigate the Magic Roundabout because it's absolutely clogged with traffic so you've got plenty of time to decide which lane you should have been in 100yds back....)"
Whose idea was it to make that garbage? Damn. It's like organized chaos. (but not really)
"Easy, just give way to the right. "
"That *looks* insane, but I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OGvj7GZSIo) that shows how it works and it actually sounds pretty elegant."
A left hand side what the fuck?
Doesn't seem that difficult
Holy shit! It‚Äôs 4 roundabouts surrounding 1 round about :-0
"Hey kids, Big Ben!"
[deleted]
Unfortunately as an European I have to confirm this is true as well. Straighlining roundabouts instead of actually using the curved lanes is much too common.
Bullshit. When I go into /r/CasualUK or /r/britishproblems I see endless comments about how British people don't know how to navigate roundabouts.
"Some of the roundabouts here are so small, you can‚Äôt enter them without stopping if there is another car because you can‚Äôt tell wether they are staying in the circle or turning. Of course, the drivers don‚Äôt do well with the larger ones either."
"Doesn't help that we don't have ""standardized"" roundabouts. Even in NJ we have some where circle traffic has the right of way, and we have some where they *don't*."
"Oh I agree, it just seems to Americans, they‚Äôve got no clue. Single lane roundabouts are easy, but once you get the double and, god forbid, triple lane, it‚Äôs like watching 5 year olds driving around a go-cart track. "
They don't work in heavy traffic
I am scared by the fact that this is merely the fourth scariest junction in Britain...
Is it magic because no matter what you do you'll come out the same way you came in?
"OK, I'm going to give you a life-skill here. 

A roundabout it just a very tiny highway where all access roads have to yield. That's it. "
"That's how they're effective, they make you scared so you pay attention"
"It must just be a matter of familiarity, I have no issue with them at all, unless we're talking about the multiple mini roundabouts in one big one. Back in my motorcycle days, I would enjoy coming up to a roundabout with 2 or 3 others doing the same, and if the situation was right, simply slipping through legally and quickly before they could make their minds up."
">It's always boggled my mind that they are demonstrably more efficient, yet -- as a driver -- fun as hell.

FTFY"
"> scary as hell

Really?  Are you one of those people that stops at the end of an on-ramp?  "
"> Keep in mind that autopilot has been available for several years now, 

Keep in mind that Autopilot (EAP) was first released late 2016 and Karpathy has been with Tesla since mid 2017 so the progress in less than two years has been rather impressive."
I'll take that bet. 
"> it still isn‚Äôt perfect on the easiest of the easy roads

Just like humans! Also not perfect. "
Definitely.  Long road ahead!
"Six months maybe, twelve months maybe. "
"Yeah, Waymo needs a huge lidor sensor, fully pre-mapped environment and a supercomputer strapped to their cars to do pretty shitty FSD today.  Tesla has already had to settle lawsuits about overpromising on FSD, no reason to believe they are very close today."
"Also the whole issue with not being able to identify stationary obstacles right in front of you... 

Maybe someday. But it's so misleading to say ""soon"" when you still have people smashing into concrete barriers or stopped trucks."
Apparently a better rain detection neural net is coming soon.  
what parameters are in that data? do they have full HD vision of a billion miles? what other info?
They‚Äòre not just driven by data. You also need the right model architecture with enough (but not *too* many) internal degrees of freedom.
">ML is one of those things where it sucks for a very long time, but once you get it right, further improvements happen much much faster.

Do you have any source for this? Even if true, I suspect with the feature set we have been at the ""get it right"" stage for a very long now and now the characteristics of ML are being dwarfed by a common issue of solving complex problems where the last 10% of the problem requires 90% of the work.

It isn't as if they all of a sudden were gift wrapped 1 billion miles of data. They have been getting data at a steady (albeit increasing) rate for a very long time. "
Imagine if you work in downtown SF. Good luck Tesla. 
It's hard to think dumb enough to appreciate what requires advanced intelligence.  There are definitely times when people drive that they are using intelligence not accessible to almost all other creatures.  What matters here is how frequently that improves the drive.
I don't think you have any idea how good the brain is at tasks like driving. 
Did we ever get confirmation of this? 
"No, but it's not 100% clear just yet if autonomous driving features are really making driving safer or not. There aren't quite enough miles to say definitively.

It is clear that as level 2 approaches level three it makes people more and more distracted."
We‚Äôre used to people killing people sadly. That‚Äôs a luxury AI cannot afford. It has to work or not even bother.
That's not going to happen anytime soon. AI is not better at driving than humans
"Impossible deadlines and public pressure on a team working on a safety critical systems?

I highly recommend reading ""Faster, Higher, Farther: The Inside Story of the Volkswagen Scandal"" that describes how a culture of ""impossible doesn‚Äôt exist"" creates a company where breaking the ethical rules and fraud are part of the operation."
What an asshole
‚Ñ¢
Eloon?
I'm not giving them money until the chip is available for purchase and installation  immediately. Not interested in giving them an interest free loan. 
I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll have a FSD free trial with a discount during the trial.
"Once AI knows everything we know, we won't be the ones using captcha images to determine if it's human or computers... they'll be the ones using their version of the turing test to see if we meet their standards of intelligence. "
"Because Elon Musk claimed a Tesla would drive autonomously by itself across the country before the end of 2017. It is now less than a month away from 2019 and they are just now starting to test traffic lights. 

You've been eating up bullshit for years, my man."
They said the Wright brothers would **never** fly.
"No, Elon was very specific in stating FSD was required  ""Elon Musk on Twitter: ""**Full self-driving option is required** with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability."""
Ah my bad. Thought he meant no driver.
"> soon to him could be another year or two to us.

Look, a redditor who came down in the last shower!"
It won't

Sure it does.  It shows they can't write the software for something that simple without it occasionally screwing up.

"> Your comment history is 100% bullshit.

Starting with an ad hominem, classy.

> Elon is describing the current EAP on steroids where the car drives on its own but still requires the driver to monitor everything the car does and intervene if needed.

> Once the car understands stop signs and traffic lights and works as good as EAP works at the moment on the highways (ie. good enough) the car will be able to drive on its own but if it does something stupid the driver will take over.

So you're just going to conveniently ignore his stated ""no driver input at all"".  Got it.

> This isn't FSD and Elon is making sure he doesn't promise anything like that. In this case the ""no driver input"" is the key.

That's some interesting mental gymnastics.  Even the Russian judges are going giving you 10s for creativity."
Approximately when next year?
Guess it depends on your area. Not the one you are responding to but I would hardly say it works well. At least on my commute I‚Äôve mostly stopped using it. I have to disengage it because of its stupidity often enough it‚Äôs not worth it beyond showing off. Heck it doesn‚Äôt even work on the interchanges I take to work. Disengages itself saying unsupported interchange. 
"First of all it suggests lane changes, it doesn't even take them.

Secondly sometimes it takes exits into barriers and emergency lanes.

It also still sometimes fail to brake for upcoming cars.

The reviews about NAP have been mainly mixed and bordering on fully negative. I wouldn't call that mind blowing at all.

Supercruise lane keeping beats AP head to head. Also you don't need to have your hands on the wheel. Aka you can go hours without touching the wheel. 
"If there were no human drivers, coordinated ~~EV's~~ AI driven vehicles could navigate that in scary fast ways. It would probably look too scary for any human yet  be much safer than the craziness we have today."
"Yep. Definitely a high bar, but it's what I'd consider necessary for Musk to claim FSD is done (even if that has to be limited to sunny days and dry roads at first).  I probably won't consider purchasing FSD until all of the tech/laws/insurance are at a point ... where I can hop in the back seat, punch in a destination address on my mobile app, and then take a nap or focus on work."

Thank you
"I guess the idea would be that Tesla - or their new subsidiary that would be formed for this purpose - would be positioned to do the exact same thing. Except maybe charge $9 instead!

Wouldn't really call that Waymo getting in trouble. But at least there would be competition. But realistically this would be years ahead and Waymo is ahead in that market."

Was just kidding.
"...So much for hw2.0 Teslas containing all the required hardware for FSD.

:-/"
They better had be and it should be free too since when I bought mine he was saying that it was already equipped with everything it needed for full self driving - AP 2.0
By current I would say any Tesla with HW 2.5. 
"If you buy FSD, or already have it. Not if you have an AP1 car."
It was 4-6 months in August for HW3. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that date as well as features has slipped another month or 30...

"The people who have bought FSD aren't that many so retrofits won't take that long. The rest will have to pay a premium.

In any case, Tesla won't be in much of a harry to replace every single computer."
"As I understand it Tesla (at the time) thought the hardware in the cars was enough for FSD, but later found out that the processing unit didn't have enough power for full self driving. So all the sensors/cameras stay the same, but a few months ago they announced FSD would require a module upgrade. Which is included if you bought FSD (as far as I know.)"

I‚Äôm not sure how I feel if my car suddenly started talking about building a wall and making ~~GM~~ Mexico pay for it"
"Well I haven't had one of those times where I think to myself ""you shouldn't try now""... 

For instance, my car will suggest a lane change because it will need to be in a certain lane for an upcoming direction on the highway, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that it would physically change the lane when it suggests it.

Sometimes I‚Äôll put on my signal when there‚Äôs a car beside me, and then my car will slow down and then get behind it.  So I‚Äôm not really sure what types of scenarios people are referring to because I just haven‚Äôt seen my car try to change lanes into another car."
"My expectation is that it'll ding, and countdown before it actually moves the car.  When they get that 'no confirmation needed' feature out."
Not for my commute. 
"Depends on how much lower. People are ready to forgive other people much more than they are machines. A machine needs to be 10x better before folks are OK with it. So when it's 10x better, it might be a thing.

And until I can divert attention away from the road, the only thing EAP/FSD delivers to me is not holding the wheel for 29 seconds at a time. Yay?!?!?"
"It is. It's a roundabout... with five roundabouts around it. You first have to enter one of the outer roundabouts, then you enter the inner one which obviously goes *the other way*, and then you have to go into another small roundabout before exiting that one."
Not me.
"I think computer are the only things that have even a chance of navigating that successfully. 

And even that is a long shot. "
"It looks crazy, but it's not that nuts since things happen really slow for this style of roundabout. It's also looking like it's in England based on the arrows, so it's not as intuitive as a person who drives on the right. My first time in England was like I was 15 and learning to drive all over again. "
"It's really quite simple, you just give way to the right on every roundabout. Which means that you give way when entering and then usually just proceed, looking for turning traffic which you give way to as well. And there are two ways to get to your destination around the roundabout, but one is shorter than the other. 

It's formed of multiple ""mini roundabouts"", these legally are the same as their bigger brothers but are usually just implemented using paint.

I think this roundabout is the Magic Roundabout in Swindon. Double mini roundabouts are quite common in the UK, but there are only three roundabout intersections like this in the UK. "
Gotta agree. I took a small detour through Swindon just to drive this roundabout and it was way easier than I was expecting.
"Similar one in Hemel Hempstead - first time through is worrying in advance but after using it, it is trivial."
It's almost like the trained traffic engineers knew what they were doing and everyone who mocks them is not a professional...

I can see it now, Tesla AP Navigation will just completely avoid this at all costs. "
"If all cars were automated and networked you could just do variations on the 4 way intersection.  4 ways are inefficient due to the human.  

If we're just going with automated but not networked then this would actually be quite efficient I think."
Yes. With this layout several cars can go through the entire system without ever interacting with each other. 
"It goes deeper.  There's 7 roundabouts in there.

The absolute best part of a roundabout (having barely survived a t-bone accident myself) is that they transition the closing vectors in an accident from 90 deg or 180 deg to a low closing velocity side-swipe impact among vehicles already moving in largely the same direction.
"Actually they are only more efficient in a narrow band of traffic rate. 

Less and it‚Äôs better to have a 2-way stop or 4-way stop, any more and it‚Äôs better to have a light. 

The problem is you have to (expensively) rip out the whole intersection to add a roundabout or to later remove it. So you need to be damn sure traffic patterns won‚Äôt change for many many years. 

To go from 2 way to 4 way stop signs to lights just requires jabbing sticks in the ground. 

In Europe, traffic patterns and population density have often been steady for over 100 years. In America, 1 year may see a 100% growth in traffic patterns. "
"US here, I have to navigate a roundabout every day on my commute. I routinely get honked or flipped off because of incoming traffic expecting me to yield to them. Many just speed into the roundabout and cause me to slam my brakes without checking of traffic in the roundabout.

&#x200B;

I wish we had more roundabouts but US drivers SUCK at roundabouts. If we had more, I'm sure they would learn."
"The only real problem with runabouts, is that if traffic backs up to it (from an output), it jams all directions instead of one.   They are normally designed so it doesn‚Äôt happen, but it still does on rare occasions.  I‚Äôve experienced it a couple of times, in a runabout i drive through every day."
They're actually starting to become fairly common in the US in some places.  My town is replacing controlled intersections with roundabouts in several places.  I agree that they're superior in nearly every way other than people who stop because they don't understand them.
"Yes but shutting on Americans results in karma. 

Don‚Äôt blame him, most Redditors are pretty much just bots. "

"We even design them poorly, in a town near me we have a roundabout where they put the crosswalks going through the f'ing center, so if a pedestrian is crossing you have to yield to them. "
"They do... We use them for heavy traffic in the UK, sometimes with added traffic lights."
"Lol, it's not *my* driving that scares me ..."
"Indeed, there's nothing else to it."
"Kind of, but it's probably not a good idea to try and change lanes in a multi-lane roundabout, whereas that would be fine on a highway"

"They have a very limited subset of this data back at Tesla. The most robust is a about five seconds of video sent back based on specific triggers established by Tesla, but a tiny fraction of the billion miles are sending photos or videos. It does, more regularly, send back GPS coordinates and AP disengagements. In theory, if AP disengages in the same spot repeatedly, they‚Äôd look into it. "
And who's labeling that data? Or how is it labeled. You have to teach the machine something. It doesn't arrive at inferences on its own volition.

That AP1 is different from AP2?
"It is true that is is not 100% clear yet, but that is the goal.

It is not true that as L2 gets better it necessarily gets more distracting. Driver engagement through signal lights and taps may lead to greater awareness instead of less awareness."
Nah. If it reduces fatalities it should be implemented. It will never be perfect. There is no such thing.
It will be much better soon. 
In that case you will be paying (a lot) more though.

"As an outside observer, I find it miraculous that the media managed to get everyone to turn on Elon Musk. He's done so much good for the world, but nope let's attack him instead of the politicians and ISPs that can buy out the media instead."

Your Tesla will match speed to traffic conditions, keep within a lane, automatically change lanes without requiring driver input, transition from one freeway to another, exit the freeway when your destination is near..."
You lack a fundamental understanding of how a problem like this is solved with software and sensors.
"Your hatred is blinding you.

Elon is talking about certain things, with a certain ...certainty, which are coming soon because they are already testing them.

Notice the words he's using (in those tweets) and the ones he isn't using (in this new tweet) and you'll see why there's a difference."
"Your words, not mine.

Elon very carefully wrote ""no driver input at all"" because he's talking about best case scenarios where the driver doesn't have to take over.

He didn't write about summoning the car while at work or anything like that.

Likewise, NoA won't require any driver input after getting on the on-ramp and till the off-ramp because the car will be able to do it autonomously but the driver will always be there. (Right now the only driver input required while on NoA is confirming lane changes but only when the system works as expected).

I find it interesting that you often blame Elon for carefully crafting certain sentences to get the attention of fans and here you can't even put two and two together."
"No one knows.

My bet is soon after HW3 (which I believe will come before the end of Q2)."
"Debateable, but it's also only available on specific freeways there mapped out.

Can it change lanes to follow the route onto correct freeways, taking your exit when it's time, navigate around d and pass slower vehicles?

Yes you do not have to have hands on the wheels, but you need to keep your eyes forward and attentive, You are being incredibly disingenuous here insinuating that you don't have to still be supervising here just like autopilot. You are just trading one method of measuring attentiveness for another and depending on your preference there's no one really objectively better here. "

"Unfortunately, it still costs more to build a Tesla EV than a Pacifica ICE -- the reverse would need to be true to support the premise that Tesla (a company a little tight on cash) could undercut a company backed by a money machine (Google a la Alphabet) on price.

Is crash imminent? Brake. 
Same here. Got the impression that my 2017 Tesla should have all the hardware it needed to be full selg driving when we bought the car.
If you bought FSD when you bought the car it is a free to get new processor. If you didn't then you need to buy FSD (price varies based on when you bought car) and after that they will upgrade whatever necessary. 
Did he confirm whether it has to be at least AP 2.5 minimum?  
"Oh yeah for sure.  I bet it is going to be pushed back a decent bit, followed by hardware shortages.  Wouldn't really surprise me at all at this pint considering they can't even get the carbon-fiber spoiler out to people..."

"Question - now, Tesla has the EAP option instead of the FSD option. I paid for EAP on my Model 3 - is the FSD included in this?"

That's only moderately right.  Far right would be the same while claiming God told you to.

"I was referring to the suggestions the car makes for changing lanes when on NOA. I have not had any problems with it trying to lane change into another car either. Just today, I was 4 miles from my exit in lane 3 (from right). It suggested switching to lane 2, I complied, then about 2.5 miles away, to lane 1. Lane 1 then turned into an exit lane (not my exit). So then it then suggested moving to lane 2. There were a bunch of cars already in lane 2 and it would not have been able to switch in time (not aggressive enough). So I took over manually. Those are the kinds of suggestions/prompts for lane changes that I am referring to. 

If it does this without prompting, I will be pissing off a whole bunch of drivers around me"
"NoA suggests changing lanes too soon, at least for my commute.  If I change into the right lane 2.5 miles before my exit (as NoA wants to do) then I end up in a line of slow moving cars that are either entering/exiting on earlier ramps.  There's plenty of room to merge into the right lane after all of that, so I ignore or disengage it."
In areas where it isn't completely empty it's worthless. It changes way too slow.
"Hey dawg, I heard you like roundabouts, so we put roundabouts in yo roundabouts so you can round while you bout."
It's not just any round about. It's a magic round about.

"Yep, this exactly. Even if they aren‚Äôt more efficient in traffic flow than a normal light, they are way safer. "
"In a roundabout when there is no other traffic you don‚Äôt have to stop. This is hugely more efficient. At various times of day and night, there is often little traffic and that can be true even in big cities. 

The real killer though is cruising through a small village in Britain in the middle of the night and not stopping at all.  This makes me happy compared to the idiocy in the US. (and I‚Äôm American.)"
"Yeah, there is an intersection near here that was a badly congested 4-way a couple of years ago. After a big construction project with detours required the whole time, it is now a nice big roundabout and traffic flows much smoother.

But at the rate this area is growing I can't help but wonder how long it will be before that roundabout gets clogged as bad as the 4way stop was. 

"
">In Europe, traffic patterns and population density have often been steady for over 100 years. In America, 1 year may see a 100% growth in traffic patterns. 

Really? From near the invention of the automobile through two world wars and countless other events the traffic patterns and population density has been steady?

4-way stops are never more efficient when it comes to throughput  because you always have to stop. They may be cheaper though.

No they won't. People are driving worse than ever -more distractions (less practice?). It's my one hope for self-driving cars. We could become more aggressive with taking people's licenses away and making them go back to driving school.

Same with yield signs.  Somehow I'm in the wrong when I take my right of way. 
If it happens in roundabouts it would only be worse with any other type of intersection

"> traffic lights.

So, basically traffic lights."
"There are roundabouts and then there are _roundabouts_. In the UK they have roundabouts where the lanes ‚Äúlead out‚Äù and new lanes start from the center. They‚Äôre awesome because you can go faster in them and your positioning is intuitive. Want to go round, well, keep changing lanes towards the center until you see your exit coming up. Your exit is straight ahead? Just floor it. The only thing complicating them is when suddenly there‚Äôs a red light inside. 

In the UK they also have better yield rules than in most other countries (at least from what I‚Äôve read). From my understanding the person with the clearest view (eg. further behind) has to yield, while in places like Norway the one changing lanes have to yield. Problem is that when you are moving out from an inner lane the people you have to yield for are most likely in your blind spot. And because the outer circumference is longer stopping/yielding generates near immediate effects going back through the queue. "
"Well made roundabouts are spiral.  Provided you're in the right lane entering it you'll not have to change lane and end up naturally in the right lane leaving it.

People do change lanes though, and it's really no harder than any other road."
"I'm not your bro, buddy.  Most people that seem to have trouble at roundabouts tend to stop for a long time waiting for no other traffic to be coming instead of taking a gap that's large enough to get in, which isn't so different to getting scared of a merge and stopping at the end of an on-ramp.  "
How much?
Damn Californian cars forcing sex changes on people. 
"That's how machine learning works, is it not? You feed it input data like the steering angle, how much the accelerator peddle is depressed, etc. Then you feed in the video from the external cameras and train a model."
data from the cameras is not shared with the mothership.
And when does that upload?
"Do you have any reason to think that machine learning autonomous driving is exactly the same as machine learning quantitative trading in every way that matters? You don't need every trade to be good to make money, you just need more good trades than bad trades to be a good machine learning program. You need to stop at EVERY red light or you are a bad machine learning program. 99% will not cut it."
"The fundamental problem is that it's not an engineered environment.  It's the world.  We may automate every factory job before we can automate driving.

It all depends on how many decimal places you need to count the cases where driving isn't just staying in between the lines.  Even if on average those scenarios are infrequent enough to let automated systems have better overall safety when considering incapacitated drivers, good drivers will demand even better.  We may in fact get to a point where there are regulations to try to engineer the driving environment.

It could include regulating everything from paint jobs to business signing in the hopes of keeping these systems on the rails.

"No, a Waymo Pacifica costs more then $50k and has to be financed by Waymo.  A Tesla 'network' car is paid for by the owner and Tesla would use it off hours.  So Tesla is in a much better position to sell service for much less money."

"Unless there is a fabrication issue with the new chip, there shouldn't be much reason for HW3 to be delayed.  They did the design in house and they are already testing prototypes (they completed testing and QA on the manufacturing lines for HW3 in Q3).  Semiconductor manufacturing is insanely expensive to get into if you need to be cost and performance competitive with someone like NVIDIA while churning out hundreds of thousands or millions of units, so I suspect the chip itself is being fabricated by a third party (TSMC perhaps), while all the rest of the packaging and assembly is done by Tesla.

Since HW3 is a supposed to be a drop-in replacement, the only things that seem likely to cause delays are yield issues and upgrading early purchasers.  I'd assume that people who previously purchased FSD will be the first ones to get the upgrade, so it may well be quite a bit later than end of Q1 before we see new deliveries using HW3, but this would still be largely fitting with the timelines.  I don't know about enabling FSD right away, but since the Navigate on Autopilot models will have had hundreds of millions of miles of use by then, there's a good chance we'll see near immediate improvement on all existing capabilities just by swapping the computers."
"And can‚Äôt even fix the myriad bugs with the CURRENT system, one many people paid lots and lots of money for, so I‚Äôm not going to be holding my breath for this new stuff."
No. FSD is a different feature from EAP and now includes different (replaceable by design) hardware. I don't remember why they took it off the design site.

"Ya... I have had it suggest getting into the left lane (which is an exit only, unless you‚Äôre an HOV) about 0.5miles before it turns into the exit many times. Clearly it doesn‚Äôt know that lane is exit or HOV only because I have the ‚ÄúUse HOV‚Äù turned off and it doesn‚Äôt want me to take the exit. "
"I still see a lot of situations where I know better than EAP about lane changes.  One example is when it ‚Äúthinks‚Äù another lane is moving faster because there is a car directly in front of me, but the other lane is not moving faster, its just that the next car is a little further away.
Also, my morning commute has a two lane exit from one freeway to another.  It always wants me to get into the far right, but staying in the middle lane takes you to the same place (and flows better, as the far right also services another exit.). So at least with the current capabilities, I don‚Äôt want automatic lane changes.  At this point, I know better than EAP which lane is better."
Give way to the right and follow the arrows.  Can't go wrong.
"One way I could see trusted networking for intersections is not to have cars talk to eachother but the intersection talk to the cars.  This would require each intersection to be modified to support it.  

Each intersection gets a large (probably 300-500) monitored track with its own self-contained management.  As each car comes into the monitored track, the track tells the car the speed and acceleration needed to navigate.

&#x200B;

It would not be 100% safe as a malicious car could follow directions until the middle of the intersection and jack on the breaks causing all others to have issues but even that could be mitigated with a large enough buffer.  If a malicious car speeds up the monitor could instruct all cars unable to stop to speed up to try to avoid it.

&#x200B;

Even barring that, just having vehicles know when the hell it's their turn would be an upgrade.

"embedded sensor traffic lights solve that problem of sitting at a light with no traffic.

More American cities are putting in roundabouts and conversely there are increasing number of cities in Britain taking out roundabouts and putting in traffic lights some of the reason being they're more pedestrian and bicycle friendly. 

I think one of the best arguments for roundabouts is avoiding the T-Bone accident."
"And when traffic increases, roundabouts become gridlocks. I agree they're good for small rural villages and towns. "
But you are guaranteed a steady flow rate in each direction due to alternating turns. A very crowded roundabout may have incoming traffic yield for a long time. 
"Yeah, I also heard that CA (and US in general) driving exams are much easier than the rest of the world. But this opens a whole different can of worms because harder tests lead to decreased access to transportation for some people. 

Definitely agree with you there, self driving cars can't come soon enough. Or even just better public transit so people have options other than driving. I do think distractions are a huge part of it, but I'm definitely seeing people who seemingly aren't distracted but just suck at driving in general. "
"No because interblocking will get you a ticket. You‚Äôre not supposed to block an intersection.  You wait until you have space to be on the other side, leaving the other intersecting road free flowing.

In a roundabout, you can‚Äôt forsee that until it‚Äôs too late."
"I think all of these seen as a whole look complex, but as a driver within following the arrows and individual situations, it's not that bad. Just take a simple roundabout with three or four inputs. If you as a driver had to monitor traffic at all four of these at the same time, it could be difficult, but you don't, you just merge into your entrance when your path is clear and exit when it comes up."
"Now read about the variant on that, the double crossover diverging diamond. It's so cool!"
Only for very heavy roundabouts. Most roundabouts don't have lights. Works well for us anyway.
"Yeah, I'll take a stop sign, thanks. "

"You have a huge dataset and depending on what you want classification or regression you train models, different types. You can have part of the dataset as your testset to see the accuracy of the different models on the predictions. Then the best model, after hyper parameter tuning, can make new predictions on new data but the parameters (steering wheel angle f.e.) need to be the same. Models for now are still very specific."
"I think the concept is the same as is the approach. Besides needing well designed models (and some hard coded base assumptions) it needs an enormous amount of two things:

a. Data

b. Computation

We know from previously when their unsecured kubernetes dashboard got hacked that Tesla runs in Amazons cloud, so they should be able to do the compute. The data is on them. One thing that is super interesting (to me at least) is their ‚ÄúShadow Pilot‚Äù that supposedly will ensure autopilot would prevent collisions the human driver didn‚Äôt otherwise send the diagnostics to Tesla to add in as more training data. "
"It's not the world, the world is full of trees, dirt, people, houses, rivers, etc... Where we drive are dedicated, paved, well marked, well lit, labeled pathways with rules and signals which govern every aspect of driving behavior on them... highly engineered. The more risk, the more so, like no cross traffic, sharp turns, pedestrians, or inadequate vehicles on highways with concrete barriers between travel directions and much higher standards of maintenance.

Sure, part of it will be improving road conditions as it is for human drivers today, but in developed countries current infrastructure is very conducive to automation, which is why we are where we are with it today. Self driving in, say India, is a whole other ballgame."
What an absurdly stupid statement.

Imo, if someone is planning on getting the FSD when the first features become available it's dumb to to get it upfront because it will be much cheaper in the end."

"He never gave specific dates, he gave vague timelines, and then delivered on them, albeit a year later... so late. Not never. In fact, 5 years from now will still be late, not never.

You concluding that because it hasn't happened by now it never will despite the system getting better and better is the bullshit.

You also seem to fail to realize that the tech Tesla has and the tech they release to the public in production cars are drastically different things.

You seem to have no comprehension of the extensive validation that is required to not kill a bunch of people with this kind of software."
"What's so terrible about Elon not fulfilling his claims in time? The goals and objectives he gives the companies he runs tend to be huge, and the time frames are overly optimistic, that's why the ""elon time"" became a thing, but that serves a purpose, it gives them a clear thing to aim for, and even if it takes him double that time, he is still progressing at a much faster rate than any of the competition, and accomplishing big milestones on the way.
 
If he claimed a Tesla would be fully autonomous by 2017, but ends up achieving that in 2022, it doesn't take away from the fact that he would end up achieving something huge, before anyone else, and made a ton of good for our technology and the world in general along the way, much more than any other greedy typical billionare can say. He might be off by something like 5 years with every huge objective he says they will accomplish, but that's a billion times better than the almost stagnant progress that was the electric vehicle and space industries if it wasn't for tesla and spacex respectively."

Yeah hopefully you are right. Will sure pay for FSD when it is actually released.
"> you still have to pay for FSD in order to get it

Does this mean there will finally be a ""noticeable depart"" from enhanced autopilot features over two years after the infamous ""3 months maybe, 6 months definitely"" tweet?"
What do you mean exactly? is that 5k for FSD on top of the 5k for EAP? If you only get EAP but not yet FSD you will have to pay 7k later?
"How anyone can complain being a Tesla owner is beyond me.

I only had to DRIVE the X and the S having operated RR, Bentley's, and other ""premium"" vehicles to see beyond the ""illustrious interior"" to the pure simplicity and thought put into these cars.

If Elon came out and said ""guise 2.0 cant do it"" why the hell wouldn't you be happy? I seriously cannot place comfort in ANY current hardware knowing that neural nets are right around the corner. 

Even spookier is that anyone who's thought of how to make self driving cars a reality, knows that these cars MUST be able to talk to each other, thus immediately queuing up everyone who wouldn't want their cars ""constantly aware"" of where it is. 

For total road safety to be visualized, multiple cars of all brands would fit one universal government regulated ""neural net"" where brands can easily implement and update the safety aspect of computer vision (think LIDAR / Optical) because the handoff would be to the government for keeping the systems patched, updated, and hardware updated if low level exploits are found. 

We would immediately move all infrastructure underground, and the Government would be first to implement universal wireless coast to coast where not a single inch of road is not painted (after first consulting with environmentalists to find which frequencies are the least invasive to all species) so that these cars can ""talk"". This would mean advanced traffic prediction where alternate routes are universally agreed on with all vehicles, allowing tighter traffic flow (save for the meatbags still driving cars who will inevitably fuck it all up) and everyone would be happy.

TL;DR: NONE of this current hardware is adequate, but that is NOT me being negative; you as a consumer must accept that you have no fucking idea how any of this works and if Elon says ""pay"" then shut the hell up and pay before I banish you to a Nissan Versa."

Also no real reason to update existing cars until you have software that can actually do something with it as in, you will need some level of FSD that people will be happy with and accountants can actually mark FSD as sales and not just pending or whatever."

What exactly is EAP doing? changing lanes when you hit a button/trigger? almost every ADAS have been doing that for years...
Elon specifically said any hardware upgrades needed to reach FSD will be free to those who pay for FSD.
"Yes, FSD is an additional charge on top of EAP. You used to be able to add it on when you placed the order for your car, but it was an option that was recently removed when tesla 'simplified the ordering process' by removing some options, and making them 'off-menu'. So you can either add it as an off-menu option when you order your car, or after you take delivery. I *think* they're the same price right now (at time of order or after), but don't quote me on that. But I do know that when I log into my owner's account, it's an option to purchase under my car. Currently @ $5k: https://i.imgur.com/9MWtZqF.jpg"

"You have lots of hardcore assumptions and the rest is probabilities. Probabilities of impact given available options. Probabilities given available options are valid. It is all heuristics under the covers of fancy tensorflow models (or their custom TPU v 2 like ML hardware) and it *will* make mistakes. It will also likely make less mistakes than a human driver will and as a result will still save a lot of lives. I‚Äôm not saying this is remotely easy, but it will hit a point where it gets massively better due to Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúdata moat‚Äù over the competition. Waymo is really great tech, with the caveat being only in very specific mostly  perfect conditions.

"The car doesn't need to handle those, it just needs to stop and tell the driver to take over on the rare occasion something like that happens.

Not surprisingly though, these are also all the things humans are really bad at. People hit wild animals and road debris all the time, block ambulances, get stuck in flooded roads and generally get in each others way when not following traffic rules... this is why we have traffic rules."
There is no argument.

"Having a backup driver isn't fully self driving.  If you can create exceptions then we're there now.  We already have systems that can work in perfect environments.

There may be a work around in that it's easier to have a system say ""I'm confused, stopping vehicle until human can take over remotely.""  We'll have to see what happens, because these neural nets are opaque.  We can't really see how they're working, but we can see if they're working.  This again might create calls for an increasingly regulated environment as we can't be completely sure how they will respond to new situations, new infrastructure, new types of vehicles."
There are people who paid for features they'll never get to use before replacing their car.  Personally I'd wait but to each their own.

"Self-driving and driver-less are two different things. From the very first comment I told you this isn't a driver-less system. We don't currently have systems that can work in 'perfect' conditions, that is no box on the road and no deer, etc... just normal driving as designed, but we are getting close.

Dealing with a fallen tree isn't something that road systems are engineered for and autonomous cars don't need to be either, only the basic physics of don't run into things. Neural nets aren't magic, they are designed, and while the details of how it mathematically detects a lane line are opaque, it's driving behavior isn't."

"Average US length of car ownership is 6.5 years.  Average lease is 3 or 4 (quick google search).  Which means you'd be paying for a feature you'd maybe never use if you leased it or use for half the ownership if you bought outright.  On average.  Again, if it works for you then great.  I understand the desire to want it and not want to pay extra, especially for shorter ownership.  It's just a bad situation."

When we talk about self driving a lot of people imagine it to need 'human' level AI of general reasoning, that's not the case at all. A self-driving car is a simple lane-following, obstacle avoidance, traffic rules engine, that's it. It won't be programmed to intelligently handle things like fallen trees (at least not for a very long time), there is way too much effort, extremely little reward, and high risk of failure... much easier to just stop the car and call support which will then navigate the car out of the situation until it can resume on auto."

Love it! Almost feels like the very beginning of a shift in sentiment in the media! 
The Detroit News ‚ÄúWater of the year goes to...‚Äù
And isn‚Äôt it ironic? Don‚Äôt you think?
This does bring a smile to my face.
Waiting for our Model 3 was the longest wait of our lives and worth every second. Getting back in an ICE after driving the Model 3 is like going back in time. 
Vehicle of the year? I thought that was going to be Falcon Heavy.

Yeet
Curious what r/cars would think. 
Most this on /cars
He'll be fine.
"They know what way the wind is blowing; so many European manufactures are deep into RND, US car makers don‚Äôt want to lose that money. Sure, it all should have happened sooner, but the elderly move slow - see what I did there? ... I‚Äôll see myself out."
"All the suppliers who work with the Big 3 work with Tesla, too."
He‚Äôs in a P3D. They‚Äôll need to catch him first!!
is tesla still looking at old GM plants for its own use?
Detroit should embrace this. Truly an American company designed and built by Americans. The big three have shat on the city and left them with semi-skilled workforce without work. 
"The reporter, or Detroit in general?"
I spent 2.5 yrs in my Subaru which I loved... everyday thinking my Model 3 couldn‚Äôt come soon enough. It was worth the wait. 
You can often get out of leases early. Tesla can help you with that!
You will get a better Tesla than us early buyers
At least maybe then there will be a chance of Model 3 leasing. 
At least they're willing to accept reality *now*. Better late than never!
Bob who?

I don‚Äôt. What was it about the car that ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt work?‚Äù  
Damn I hate these laws.
"I don't know about Detroit, but I've been seeing more and more Teslas in Grand Rapids and Lansing lately. They are more common than Camaros now. Like, I see Model S and X on a daily basis. Model 3s are quite common now too. It's crazy, given that the Camaro is made in Lansing."
Why would they put it on the front cover if it's not even on the list?
"Yeah, that was a total bait and switch. Then they crowned the Honda Civic and Accord as ten best. I drove a Honda Accord recently; it's no Model 3."
Those bastards
"I can tell you the Car & Driver 10 best cars of 2019:

&#x200B;

BMW, BMW, Porsche, BMW, Porsche, BMW, BMW, Porsche, BMW, VW.

&#x200B;

I cancelled my subscription to Cow & Briber magazine ..."
"Literally noticed this earlier today. They did have a column explaining why the Model 3 Performance did not win, but didn't adequately explain their reasoning for the Model 3 losing to the G70."
"I think we're still in ""fight you"" for a while.  Win by 2022 maybe."
"It looks a little compressed over the hood from a side profile to my eyes, but otherwise just as classy and sleek as the S."
"Been shared many times but after watching this in 2014 I bought as many shares of Tesla as I could the next morning. 

https://youtu.be/RBkND76J91k"
"Ironic as it was the model-T that was the death blow to the electric car of the early 1900's.  Now the electric car is looking to bring the more than century long ICE era to a close.  Turns out we had it right the first time, we were just missing 100 years worth of chemistry lessons."
"My neighbor was persuaded to buy one partly because of mine. She never even rode in it or asked for a ride or anything. She just liked the way it looks, I guess."
"I‚Äôm not saying he was a ‚Äúgood‚Äù person, but if you think profit was Jobs‚Äô prime directive, you know very little about him."
"you give jobs too little credit. granted, he was a harsh man to work for, just at musk is. these dudes are not doing easy stuff. and i agree musk has an broader vision for the future, but jobs also had visions to make things better, to bring society and humanity forward."
"Musk is an ass to those who work for him. He has a massive Ego. I don't think he cares about profits so much as he cares about being right. I think Elon and Jobs shared a lot in common, not all bad either. They both know how to market the shit out of themselves and cater to a cult following."
"I encourage you to learn more about Steve Jobs. Check out the books ‚ÄúBecoming Steve Jobs‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Second Coming of Steve Jobs‚Äù. Ignore the Hollywood movies and Walter Isaacson‚Äôs book. You will then see what a genius Steve was, quirks and all, not unlike Elon Musk. In fact, Elon has said in an interview that Steve Jobs is one of his inspirations. And also don‚Äôt forget Woz was only around for the Apple I and II days. He had absolutely nothing to do with Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, or iPad. You don‚Äôt have hit after hit being a PR guy :)."
"Jobs wasn‚Äôt a pleasant person and had a lot of personal failings, but Job also wanted to change the world and for the better and came up with ideas that revolutionized personal computers, music players and phones, at the least."
Nah you're right he doesn't care about just profits. If he did he would've never started space x or tesla as they both nearly bankrupted him numerous times. 
This right here.  I really hope Apple never buys Telsa.  Everyone said it was such a good fit and I personally think that couldn't be more wrong.  Apple would destroy Tesla's philosophy in an instant.
"Totally agree, fk jobs and apple, they are just about profit. "
Musk is so concerned with the people that he treats his employees like garbage. Lol. Get his balls out of your mouth for once. Jesus. 
"This is an issue that will be solved in the mid/long term. The reality is that car companies are limited by the number of batteries that can be produced, there will be enough demand from people with proper home charging options to sell out 100% of production until then. I think the batteries will be the limiting factor until about 2030, after which solutions for all apartment dwellers will be needed. This will probably by achieved by regulation, mandating charging points for all rented apartments and grants for all those apartments that are privately owned. I see this as being similar to the roll out of USB charging in the last three years, slots are popping up literally everywhere these days, buses, trains, planes coffee shops all have them. As electric cars become more prevalent, they will crop up all over the place. 

Ubitricity have a good solution for the here and now, charging cables that connect to street lamps outside your home, for those that park on the street.

"I have a friend with a bolt that only charges when he goes grocery shopping. 

It doesn‚Äôt really matter to him, he only drives about 10k miles a year. 

"
"If everyone waits for the world to be ready for EVs then nothing will ever change.

EV chargers are like internet. How long did it take apartment managers to realize that all of their best tenants will move out if they don't have high speed internet? In 3-5 years you will see a lot of changes."
I see at least 1 Tesla on my daily commute in Grand rapids
I don't know where in metro Detroit you're at... But I live here and see at least one tesla every day. 
They‚Äôd probably tear the article to shreds for being so poorly written.
He doesn't actually say anything good about the Model 3 or why it was chosen other than Tesla sold lots of them. All of the complements are backhanded as he offers lots of reasons why people should buy something else.
US and Japanese makers are also deep into R&D as well. Just not publicizing all that much yet.
Nope. [Its a RWD LR 3.](http://www.henrypayne.com/index.php/2018/11/payne-life-with-my-tesla-model-3)
"Not exactly; the ~~mayor of the town~~governor of Ohio, where the factory is located, has offered them to Tesla via Twitter, and Elon Musk responded that they are considering it.Edit - thanks, u/kaffmoo"
Ooo which Subaru?
I went from a Saabaru to a Model S in 2014!
I rented a subaru legacy recently.  The half-a-billion needless stalks coming out of the steering column were comical.  It drove like a toadstool with many flanges ...
That's a terrible financial move üòÜ I'm not that emotional about the purchase. Plus I'm waiting on either lease options or standard range variant. 
"That'll be great, to be honest. I'm banking on either a standard range model 3 or a 2015ish model s pre-owned if not. I didn't love the handling of the model s vs the model 3 but I'm in it for AP and gas savings so I am really not picky. I am curious if we'll see leases by the summer with the amount of demand right now. "
"I laughed at Tesla and said it would never work. I said it would never be as fast as my AMG or my Porsche. I said it would never have 300 miles of range. I said it would never be popular and have sales which would seriously compete with any of the major manufacturers, much less Mercedes and BMW. I said Tesla would fail. I said Elon Musk was surely just a fraudster to try any take investor money for such a fool‚Äôs errand. "
"Trust me, the general population of Michigan still isn't there yet. 

Now if Elon took over the GM factories and gave people jobs while figuring out how not to get stuck with backwards unions... they might be onto something.

I could tell my mom was grasping for something to hate on Tesla about, and she couldn't get over how they can't figure out production issues when other companies have been doing it for a century. As if with everything else tesla has to achieve to rip these backwards assholes out, they can't magically go from 20 thousand cars a year to 500 thousand a year with no issues."
"Yup, some people like to get stuck on history. It's very obvious they (or at least a number of those people) don't think that way now, give them credit."
"Better Nate than lever!

Sorry, I can never resist. "
"Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration."
Maybe I wasn‚Äôt clear enough. The city of Detroit didn‚Äôt laugh at Tesla.  The big automakers of Detroit laughed and said it wouldn‚Äôt work. Now we laugh at them. 
"I think it was partly about range, partly about charging time, partly about cold weather performance, that sort of thing.

I remember back in the late 00's, a team from Tesla drove a roadster from Fremont to Detroit for the auto show there just to prove that they could. In winter, can if I recall.

With the modern supercharger network and current ranges we take for granted that you can go anywhere, but at the time I don't think that had been done before.

There was also a question as to whether consumers would accept it. It's just so *different.*

But yeah, it's how this usually goes with Elon - his first pass is a rough proof of concept that probably *wouldn't* work in all practically but demonstrates the idea and pulls in capital from enthusiasts who want to use it and are willing to pay a premium. Then he works his way down the market with more polished and economical products. It's more or less what he did with Tesla, we're seeing it from the beginning now with Boring Company, and while I don't know SpaceX's early history, it looks like they're about at the phase where they have a disruptive product that works (like the S and X) and are using that revenue to build the thing they wanted to from the start - a true spaceship (like the mad market model 3.)

But people judge what you show them, and the current Boring Company tunnel is a rough ride, so people have already started the ""it'll never work!"" business, education honestly it feels weird to just dismiss, but at this point it's actually part of the process."
"Seconding this for the smaller outlying towns. I've seen almost as many 3s since their release as I have seen Ss in the past three years or so I've been looking for them. Even with the roadblocks, people are still buying them."
"Magazine sales.. They know that the image of the Tesla will move copies, but they also know where they make their money, so they can't let it actually win."
It gets views. It was also one of the contestants. The same thing happened in last year's issue with the Mustang GT350R. 
"Trolling for Clicks.

[Here is the cover.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iX3McKtgL._SY445_.jpg)

[They did Test it.](https://youtu.be/wFe1FxJh0SY?t=12) They probably just decided that a drivers car should not drive itself."
2022 maybe 2023 definitely
.. Elon? 
Yeah but smaller car. In person I feel it looks much better than I expected 
Yeah Tesla became the biggest single position in my portfolio after watching that.
"Every one of those predictions is wrong, and EVs aren't 10x more energy efficient that ICE.  Our Ford Fusion Energi goes the same distance of $3.50 of gas and $3.50 of electricity.  But we bought a P3D+ and love it more, now."
It looks like a 911.
"I know it's from a movie about him, so its veracity or accuracy isn't guaranteed, but the ""bicycle for the mind"" speech from the Danny Boyle Steve Jobs movie is really good at portraying this version of Jobs. The version of him that knew how much humanity could advance if you managed to put a personal computer in every home. Not sure how much that movie shows the real Jobs, and most of that movie he does come across as pretty callous and harsh, but that one scene is a really good sales pitch for at least the part of Jobs that was the hopeful futurist."
"I always thought that Woz was the visionary and Jobs was the PR guy, but that's my opinion and maybe I don't give enough credit to Jobs, but he's no Musk.

Fun fact: my company made a sales pitch to Musk and he cut our presentation off midstream and asked us to leave while yelling at exec who invited us because our product isn't what he was looking for.   I've got no belief that Musk is a nice guy, but he's one of the few pointing us in the right direction."
They‚Äôre both visionaries that sacrifice themselves and those around them for what they perceived to be the greater good of humanity. It just so happens that we agree. Just because what they did is good doesn‚Äôt meant how they treat people around them is right or justified. That being said I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôve been around. 
"From almost all accounts, Jobs was a an asshole in life.  He had an ego the size of Silicone Valley and it showed.  Also, Jobs was a fantastic capitalist, whereas Musk is a fantastic genius and environmentalist."
"> but jobs also had visions to make things better

If you think things are going to work themselves out in 3 years be ready for some major disappointment.
Maybe I need to open my eyes a little more
"It is poorly written. He chooses the Model 3 as the Car Of The Year, but gives no solid reasons as to why it is the best."
It's Detroit News so he can't just straight up say how much he likes it better than his other vehicles without taking some jabs.  But he did select it above the others as his #1 for the year.
"except Toyota, they want to go bankrupt for some weird reason."
oh god! get him some snow tires to escape with!!
That was the governor of the state 
I wish media would report that as lame duck governor. In a week the whole thing is meaningless. 
Wrong sub 
"I was more thinking about being able to take advantage of the full $7,500 tax credit over the next few days. Obviously it‚Äôs totally up to you!"
">That'll be great, to be honest. I'm banking on either a standard range model 3 or a 2015ish model s pre-owned if not. I didn't love the handling of the model s vs the model 3 but I'm in it for AP and gas savings so I am really not picky. I am curious if we'll see leases by the summer with the amount of demand right now.

It depends on the residual value.  I was unsure if I could live without a truck and picked up my X while I still had 3 months left on my Toyota Tacoma lease.  I was able to bring it to the Toyota dealer and they made the last 3 payments on my behalf because they wanted to resell the truck on their lot."
I feel like sales will slow down once the federal credit goes away and leasing would be the obvious choice for boosting them back up. 
It takes guts to admit that. :)
"At least you figured it out. There are still many people out there parroting the same worn out arguments, ignoring the fact that despite all odds, Tesla is suceeding"
A late investor.
Why should tesla care if they're onboard or not? I don't think they should take the old factories either. 
What's your line of work Bob
Looks like bob just got his SO a model 3. Check teslas insta! What a coincidence
">partly about cold weather performance

Cold weather performance\charging still isn't great. It's not horrible, but it's not good either.

>But people judge what you show them, and the current Boring Company tunnel is a rough ride, so people have already started the ""it'll never work!"" business, education honestly it feels weird to just dismiss, but at this point it's actually part of the process.

The problem with the ""boring company"" is that Elon is making false comparisons in terms of price, and the idea is half-baked. He says his tunnel is < $10 million, and then compares it to a $1billion a mile metro, which is MUCH larger, and has stations, etc. If you actually compare apples to apples, his pricing isn't anything special. When I first heard of the boring company I wondered what he was doing that was so unique, and I never really found an answer. I found this video the other day from the ""other"" sub.

"I reminds me of the early micro-computers. My first electronic computer was a KIM-1 with 1K of RAM, my second was a Commodore PET with 8K or RAM that I later expended to 16K.

&#x200B;

But the computer company I worked for (DROL Systems) and the Computer Science departments in Toronto University and Durham College the computer people there thought my small home computer was a waste since it was so small.  Today my home computer has a faster CPU, more memory, more storage than all those old mainframes combined.

&#x200B;

I do not know what electric cars finally will develop to, but in decades to come ICEs will be replaced for sure.

&#x200B;"
"I‚Äôm kind of new to following Tesla and the rest of Elon‚Äôs ventured, so I didn‚Äôt really hear much about Tesla back then, but I did see an overwhelming amount of skepticism and negativity on Twitter about The Boring Company PoC video, so I believe it."
"ya its really silly, theyre judging it by smoothness.

the thing every transport geek judges on is cost/km.

the criticism in r/infrastructure is for the skateboard not the tunnel.

it's based on people per hour.

the real questions are cost per passenger km and total passengers per hour."
"I haven't kept up with the news lately, but I hope Tesla really does consider buying the GM plant in Ohio. Not only will we end up seeing even more Telsa vehicles roaming about in the Midwest, but it'll surely mess with the Big 3 so much! "
I love how the conspiracy theories come out whenever a Tesla doesn't win an award. How much did Tesla pay to win a spot on the 2016 best cars list? 
"Super easy, you turn Autopilot off."

Steve Jobs as Steve Jobs. "
"I don‚Äôt think anyone will say he was a nice person or that he didn‚Äôt have some major personal failings. But anyone who knows about him will know that he was a visionary and really did want to change the world. People don‚Äôt remember what the computing scene was like before the Mac. He (along with a lot of hardworking, smart people) revolutionized personal, then portable music players, then phones."
"Jobs was always the one who had the vision to be [100% renewable](https://www.apple.com/environment/) and to have his products be [completely recyclable.](https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-09-at-1-39-09-pm.png) He did deeply care about the environment and how to lessen the damage to it, not unlike Elon."
"my opinion on woz/jobs are quite the opposite. woz was the technician, he made the ideas come to life, but without jobs, none of those things would have left the garage. jobs definitely was key in pushing desktop computing, and being able to see what it could (and would) become. but sure jobs was a part of a group, woz, gates, and a lot of other early nerds are to thank is such regard =)

but i fully agree musks visions are way more important and wholesome.
"
"Jobs was absolutely the visionary. Woz is a brilliant engineer, but he didn‚Äôt think up the ideas. He also hasn‚Äôt been directly involved with Apple for decades."
"I'd love to work for a company with a meaningful purpose but I definitely would not tolerate being yelled at. Yelling doesn't motivate me, I love constructive criticism but I have a zero tolerance policy regarding hostile work environment. My opinion is that if there's ever raised voices, either someone needs therapy or it's time for someone to quit.

I may understand such behavior in the kind of production hell they went through though. That's a really extraordinary situation with survival hanging by a thread. So I'll steer clear of companies that need to go through such a phase, I simply don't have the kind of personality that would thrive in such an environment."
Woah! Which product?
">Do you also equate Hitler to Churchill because they both led countries at about the same time?

lol. Yes, because Musk:Jobs is like Churchill:Hitler. That being said, Hitler was a terrible person, but he didn't rise to his position without some smarts, and charisma. 

>Musk is driven, Steve ""Everything you've ever done in your life is shit so why don't you come work for me?"" 

They were both driven. I don't think they are 1:1 copies of each other but they definitely shared personality traits. Both have a massive Ego, both are hard to work for and harder to please, both think they are changing the world.

>Bill Gates would be a more accurate comparison there - techie, knows-his-shit, doesn't suffer fools.

What Bill Gates are we talking about? Early years insufferable gates or the newer softer side Gates? I definitely think Musk is more of a Jobs. However, if you look at any person like a Jobs/Gates/Musk that brought a company up there are personality traits that will be common among them all. It takes a special kind of person to have that drive to succeed, they are very a type personalities. 

>Jobs was just an asshole.

By many accounts Musk is an asshole to many people as well. "
">Bill Gates would be a more accurate comparison there - techie, knows-his-shit, doesn't suffer fools.

I'm a full-on Linux fanboy and have hated Windows for my 25+ year career, but I do respect the hell out of Bill Gates for his philanthropy...which is what I expect a billionaire to do when they reach the age of retirement."
It's embarrassing how much people worship a ceo
"Or to put it another way, EV sales are between 1-2% of total global sales roughly. That means we will need 50-100x more batteries than are being produced today to convert sales to EVs. Battery factories need to be springing up constantly for the forseeable future in order to keep up with demand. "
Oh yeah I forgot about the marshmallow brand. 
"It already seemed relatively meaningless, but that tidbit makes it even moreso."
Is there a rule where I can't ask someone way down in a comment chain about another car they brought up?
Ah great point but I did the math and it just isn't compelling enough at this point. I appreciate the insight !
Dealer = Tesla? Why would another dealer pay off your lease otherwise
"Remember, the federal credit doesn't ""go away"" until 2020. It *halves* in a few days, then halves again in July. Then it goes away January 2020."
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised that is when the base model will show up.
US sales will slow down but they are starting to open up other markets for the 3 now so I doubt the tax credit will have any real impact on Tesla vehicle sales.
"It is still an unknown is tesla can keep up the pace of sale when the tax credit is cut in half. If they can do Q1 and Q2 like a rock star, I feel those argument will be shut down for good. "
"A $52b valuation at the time of me writing this post doesn‚Äôt seem too abnormally high, definitely has room to grow.  "
Because they need some sort of political edge in michigan where the big three control the legislature and won't allow tesla to build service centers or dealerships there.
"I thought a big part of it was exactly the fact that tunnels are smaller. If the high speed autonomous vehicles let you achieve higher throughput in a smaller tunnel, then yes you have succeeded at lower cost.

Other improvements were supposed to be the speed of the drilling process, and they have some well-publicized patents related to that.

My question is that they also claim to be able to build a complex network under the city, instead of a small number of direct paths, so that you could go anywhere.  This could make it revolutionary at scale, but I‚Äôm not reading anything that could allow this, beyond smaller, cheaper.  Most cities have established legacy infrastructure to dodge, which can be a huge issue.  What is the plan for that?"
"Actually, I think we‚Äôre all missing the point of the Boring company.  Everyone keeps comparing it to mass transit or major highway options where it comes up short, and it‚Äôs not clear that the higher speed full autonomy can make up for it, but let‚Äôs consider a more car-culture response.  The value is not the tunnel but scaling to the web of tunnels throughout a city. Instead of the epic commute of 100,000 vehicles out to the suburbs, consider everyone leaving work at the same time and quickly popping up in different parts of the city.  We should compare this to the surface street network, with its low speed limits, traffic lights, constant stop and go.  "
"Well, it may legit be something that'll never work - how should I know? The point was more that they *always* say that."
"Cold weather peformance and charging have been fine on my Model 3. It's 17F at my work and it performed like a champ, with a bit less regen to start."
"> Cold weather performance\charging still isn't great. It's not horrible, but it's not good either.

I dunno, my Model 3 AWD does just fine in the snow and cold. Drove it across the Rockies this past weekend and had no problems with performance or charging.

I stopped at the Supercharger in Silverthorne on the way out west and made it all the way to Grand Junction on that charge. On the way back, I had to stop in Glenwood Springs and Silverthorne, but each stop was only 15 minutes. The car performed perfectly, and climbing the steep inclines was clearly easier for me than for the ICE cars."
Thunderfoot is a hack.
"Oh, there's no telling what the future holds. I watched this earlier, which touches on a bunch of upcoming battery chemistries that may work dramatically better than current lithium ion batteries: https://youtu.be/lATQEbd2Yh4

But even that is looking at the very near future from a present perspective. Any major discovery could reveal a much better plan that we just don't have perspective for today. That has happened over and over with microcomputers."
"The issue isn't that the Tesla didn't win (that's the baseline expectation anyway) but rather the observation that the Tesla was on there cover, yet was not even on the list.

Also, do you think it's a conspiracy theory to say that the magazines make money from advertising?

"
"It's kind of like if the iPhone was on the cover of WIRED's 10-best gadgets list in 2007, but then didn't win and wasn't even on the list.  It's kind of obvious what's happening here."
Or you don't turn it on.
"Thanks! I had never actually seen the real life version of him saying the quote.

Looks like the movie didn't make it up completely and didn't make too many big changes; who knows if he actually said it to Sculley when he was trying to recruit him from Pepsi, but other than that they just changed it from ""humans are in the lower third"" to ""humans are the least efficient"". The latter is less accurate but I'm sure it plays out better to communicate what Jobs was going for to the general audience.
"
I think that vision has sailed.
"Wozniak was gone from Apple shortly after the release of the first Macintosh and only really had influence on it until his 1981 plane crash. I think it's safe to say that much of the vision that makes Apple what it is today came after Steve Jobs returned to Apple. Products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone were where things really took off."
"Oh, what a delicate little flower.  Does it hurt your feelings when people raise their voices at you?

Sounds like you‚Äôre never attempted anything important...

Edit: Seriously, when we hire we look for full grown adults who have the ability to withstand discomfort.  Work is hard.  Everyone needs to bring your best effort every day.  Managers shouldn‚Äôt need to tiptoe around fragile childlike employees who can‚Äôt take honest and direct (and sometime heated) feedback."

And an equal amount of room to drop. I love Tesla but the valuation is already astronomical to me. 
Drilling down is the plan for that. You can drill below legacy infrastructure just like you can drill beside it.
">I thought a big part of it was exactly the fact that tunnels are smaller. If the high speed autonomous vehicles let you achieve higher throughput in a smaller tunnel, then yes you have succeeded at lower cost.

That youtube clip I posted brings up some good questions about practicality of ever getting enough throughput on these lines. Elon in his speech made it sound like his tunnel would cost $1b per mile if done traditionally. We now know that he isn't comparing tunnels of the same capability, size, or buildout. It's an apples to oranges comparison. 

>Other improvements were supposed to be the speed of the drilling process, and they have some well-publicized patents related to that.

Which? I didn't turn up anything meaningful. Maybe they are faster, but maybe that process is more expensive, because in terms of price per mile, they are about average in terms of cost for what was built from the research I turned up.

>My question is that they also claim to be able to build a complex network under the city, instead of a small number of direct paths, so that you could go anywhere. This could make it revolutionary at scale, but I‚Äôm not reading anything that could allow this, beyond smaller, cheaper. Most cities have established legacy infrastructure to dodge, which can be a huge issue. What is the plan for that?

Those tubes would have to be direct routes, which on the surface would mean point to point, which means a single entry and exit. I know he said parking spaces could be used to inject yourself into the tunnel, but if the tunnels are that busy and that fast, I don't know how you could every get in and going fast enough to either not drag down the average speed, or cause an accident.

The other blocker for me is even if they can build a huge network of tubes to bypass road congestion, now you just moved that congestion somewhere else, which is tunnel entries and exits, it's like a less effective subway. How are you going to get these hundreds of thousands of cars through what are basically one road highways? It would take massive scale and hundreds of tunnels. Even if the tunnels are smaller, cheaper, and don't have some of the traditional metro stops, the sheer number needed will drive up cost of the system. A well designed subway\train still seems a more ideal approach to me. Less cars, less traffic, less headaches. What happens if a car runs out of charge or breaks down mid-tunnel? 

Maybe these have already been thought out and solved, and if they have someone show me where. I just don't see, thinking through iterations of how it may work that this could be remotely cost effective, or really even effective at all. 

I'd love to see more focus on better people transport like effective subways and high speed rail like Europe has. Take that design and improve upon it, make it cheaper and bring it to the US. I know it's in his best interest to cater to cars, but to get rid of congestion, you really need to eliminate cars, not make them autonomous or build more places for them to drive."
"But how would that work? Has that been answered? The entry points to these tunnels will be hot-spots for queuing, and once in the tunnel turning at high speeds, or switching to a different tube would require slower than 150 mph speeds that Elon was talking about. I saw his parking space idea, but that would take up a lot of room, and I don't know how that would work with utilities currently in the street.

Having been on a road course, even taking a gentle sweeper at 120 isn't the most comfortable thing, much less 150. I just don't understand how you can make a network that big without running into queuing issues at entry points, or having massive real-estate to put in a lot of entry points, which then creates it's own issues.

Again, not saying these haven't been solved, I just don't see how all this can work. Tunnels are more limiting than highways. Why wouldn't the same level of autonomy be just as effective above surface as it would be below? Tunnels would have to intersect and merge underground as well."
"Who is ""they?"" because traditionally ""they"" is mass media, and right now mass media is swinging on Elon's balls hard. I'm no mining specialist, or tunnel boring expert, I'm just trying to figure out what is so revolutionary about this company. With Tesla it's in your face, I'm not seeing it with the boring co. It isn't the technology (they bought an off-the-shelf boring machine), it isn't the process (from what I've read), the only thing left is how they are going to *use* the tunnel, and I just don't see it being effective. I'm more than willing to have my mind changed by someone in the know. Someone tell me what's special about it, other than ""Elon."""
"Do you park in a garage where it's relatively warm? We saw ~15-20% degradation in efficiency in weather around 20-25 degrees. Had almost no regen after sitting in that weather for 9 hours. We're close to the ""D"" after our 40 minute commute."
">I dunno, my Model 3 AWD does just fine in the snow and cold. Drove it across the Rockies this past weekend and had no problems with performance or charging.

We have a RWD so maybe having one less drive unit to regen with makes a difference? Don't get me wrong, we can still get where we want, but cold batteries make for slow charging and less range.

>I stopped at the Supercharger in Silverthorne on the way out west and made it all the way to Grand Junction on that charge. On the way back, I had to stop in Glenwood Springs and Silverthorne, but each stop was only 15 minutes. The car performed perfectly, and climbing the steep inclines was clearly easier for me than for the ICE cars.

I guess it depends on the ICE, I've never had problems climbing hills in any of our RWD\AWD cars especially when properly equipped. Our ICE drops ~7-10% efficiency in the same weather for sake of comparison. Just seems our Tesla hates cold weather more. I wish we could heat the batteries while charging or before we leave, any strategy we have tried has failed to make any appreciable difference."
"Ok, what part was he wrong about?"
">The issue isn't that the Tesla didn't win (that's the baseline expectation anyway) but rather the observation that the Tesla was on there cover, yet was not even on the list.

This isn't exclusive to Tesla. Last year's cover had the Mustang GT350R and Camaro ZL1 1LE. The GT350R didn't make the list, But it was still a very popular car last year. Similar to how this year's cover has the G70 and Model 3. Both very talked about cars, but only one made it on the list.


> Also, do you think it's a conspiracy theory to say that the magazines make money from advertising?

No, that part is obvious. But I think claiming that the Tesla didn't win because the magazine didn't receive any advertising dollars from Tesla is a stupid argument. Especially when Teslas have won awards in those same magazines in the past. "

"> We now know that he isn't comparing tunnels of the same capability, size, or buildout. 

*Now*?   Building smaller-diameter tunnels was always explicitly the objective.   It was always in the FAQ, and in all of the talks.    It was the main answer when people would ask ""how do you plan to make them cheaper and faster?""     The [FAQ](https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/) asks, ""How are we reducing the cost of tunneling?"" and the very first answer is 

>>First, we reduced the tunnel diameter. The current standard for a one-lane tunnel is approximately 28 feet. By using electric autonomous vehicles with alignment wheels, the diameter can be reduced to less than 14 feet. Reducing the diameter in half reduces tunneling costs by 3-4 times.

>now you just moved that congestion somewhere else, which is tunnel entries and exits

Which was addressed in the FAQ, and in [video mock-ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5V_VzRrSBI), and in many talks.   The 'stations' were intended to be the size of a single parking space, and there would be as many as needed.     You can say ""that would take a lot of space,"" but only if we're saying that using a parking space takes up an unreasonable amount of space on the surface.   

>Those tubes would have to be direct routes, which on the surface would mean point to point, which means a single entry and exit

Does our road system have a single entry and exit?   Or do we go from parking spot to parking spot, point to point, via feeder roads, trunks, and whatnot?    Musk has already said that their model is to create a point-to-point system, like our road system, but in three dimensions, so it scales better than a road system.

>How are you going to get these hundreds of thousands of cars through what are basically one road highways? 

By scaling it up as much as needed.   Building another lane onto the highway, or doubling the street capacity in Houston or Bangkok, is a huge issue.   Another tunnel, assuming they can decrease the cost and speed as much as they hope to, is far less so.   This too is all explained in the FAQ.

>Maybe these have already been thought out and solved, and if they have someone show me where.

Thought up, yes, and explained in the [FAQ](https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/).   Solved, no, which is what the R&D is for.   The whole system is predicated on their success in making tunneling at least 10x cheaper, and also faster, the minimum goal being 1/10th that of walking speed, or 0.3mph.   

I completely understand and respect someone saying they don't think it'll work.   But I find the characterization of these things being kept secret, or not mentioned, unfair.   These things were all explicitly talked about in the FAQ, and many talks and interviews.    "

did you watch the joe rogan podcast?  he mentioned how digging tunnels had the advantage of 3D placement vs the 2D placement of streets.  so you dig many tunnels that may cross each other without interference
"How do you reason that highways are less limiting? If you build a highway, the land underneath can only be used for surface streets and small buildings.  Any equivalent tunnel would have more land available for building and have a wider variety of uses, e.g. parks, skyscrapers, etc.

"I'm with you, in that as a commuter solution, it seems impractical. I would love it if he turned his attention to Personal Rapid Transit, or pod cars, on a simple elevated track. I think he has some other use for the tunnels, probably several. Tunneling on Mars for one."
"The Boring Company is working to build their own, from the ground up, TBM. They've done lots of modifications to the one they've been using. 

Not sure if you are attempting not to see the business case or not using the right perspective.

Business case: Tunnels can be made a lot cheaper by digging them faster. Less than 20% of the tunneling time is actually spent boring. If you build a TBM that can work constantly (eg. erect supports as it is boring) you increase tunneling speed by 5-6 times. If you build tunnels that are smaller in diameter you also get great improvements. 

Whether or not you are driving a train or a car through the tunnel doesn't matter, that's a side note. If you can increase tunnelling speed by 15x that's a huge improvement. Tunnel projects are slow, expensive, and almost always go over budget. "

">Now? Building smaller-diameter tunnels was always explicitly the objective. It was always in the FAQ, and in all of the talks. It was the main answer when people would ask ""how do you plan to make them cheaper and faster?"" 

Ok, then why did he compare them to $1b\mile tunnels that are much bigger, and have a larger infrastructure cost. It's not an apt comparison then. 

>Which was addressed in the FAQ, and in video mock-ups

Which I watched, and still don't see how that does anything to alleviate congestion or make things faster.

>You can say ""that would take a lot of space,"" but only if we're saying that using a parking space takes up an unreasonable amount of space on the surface.

The video I provided overlays the needed space versus a typical street, it's larger than a typical space. 

>Does our road system have a single entry and exit? Or do we go from parking spot to parking spot, point to point, via feeder roads, trunks, and whatnot?

Of course not, and I said it would take a lot of entry points which I feel would be problematic to flow, and best case would drive up cost.

>By scaling it up as much as needed. Building another lane onto the highway, or doubling the street capacity in Houston or Bangkok, is a huge issue. Another tunnel, assuming they can decrease the cost and speed as much as they hope to, is far less so. This too is all explained in the FAQ.

Which costs $$ so now this cheap solution gets more expensive per mile. I've read all the FAQs and it still leaves much to be desired and unanswered. 

>Thought up, yes, and explained in the FAQ. Solved, no, which is what the R&D is for. The whole system is predicated on their success in making tunneling at least 10x cheaper, and also faster, the minimum goal being 1/10th that of walking speed, or 0.3mph. 

So they need to make that tunnel they just build for 10 million, 1 million then. If you would have outsourced the tunnel $10 million would have been the average cost for it's size. They aren't any cheaper (currently). Plus this is a very simple tunnel without the complicated processes and systems of having merging tunnels, multiple entrances, mid-tunnel entrances, and other tunnels and infrastructure to dodge, all of that will impact pricing.

>I completely understand and respect someone saying they don't think it'll work. But I find the characterization of these things being kept secret, or not mentioned, unfair. These things were all explicitly talked about in the FAQ, and many talks and interviews. 

I'm not saying it's secret, I'm saying I haven't found the answers or solutions. They say some of these are solved, but their solutions raises other problems that haven't been answered, that's what I'm going after. Let's say he somehow makes this work, if he applied the same technology to make subway tunnels at 1/10 the cost, that would be GREAT for public transport. If you could build subways for 100 million a mile vs. 1 billion that'd be a tremendous win. Subways by nature are more efficient people movers than cars. If you can make a painless, cheap, fast, efficient subway system it will alleviate traffic massively. "
We sure do.
">Meh, there is a tremendous market for tunnels even without mass transit in mind. Sewers, data, electrical, water, could all benefit from better infrastructure.

No disagreements there. If he\Boring Co. can truly dig the same tunnel for 1/10 the cost it would be a great thing. I just don't see that in the numbers. Routing of municipal sewers, power, etc would be much cheaper and effective and would be a net win. I hope he can build tunnels cheaper, he just hasn't yet.

> Most of America's infrastructure was built out right after ww2 and it's reaching the end of its extended lifetime. And there is a lot of money available to throw at those problems.

I'd rather repair\replace what we have with something that's proven versus something unproven like these thousands of miles of tunnels under cities. I really wish we had a good rail system in the US."
"I did, however tunnels aren't without drawbacks. The solution for car congestion isn't more roads\tunnels, it's less cars. If we poured all this effort into a good train/subway system it would reduce the need for cars in the city."
">How do you reason that highways are less limiting?

Let me try to answer your question with a question. How is going from something that has 2+ options to be in with the slight turn of a wheel more limiting than a single lane tube, with fixed exit points? If we had the same level of autonomy that would be required to make these tunnels work in our cars we could reduce congestion for the same number of cars. However more cars will always mean more traffic. Adding more places for cars to travel on is a band-aid, what you really need are less cars.

The hurdles he'll have to overcome is the level of autonomy, integration, breakdowns, infrastructure cost for the entries\exits (his elevators seem nifty, but are huge liabilities and will be expensive), moving existing infrastructure, and maintenance. I'm sure there are others I'm forgetting. Look at today's subways as an example. They move massive numbers of people on routes, and even with predictive scheduling and technology advancements they still run behind for a variety of reasons. If he can create a super effective metro\subway\high speed trains that'd do far more for congestion than underground car tunnels."
"any TBM erects support as it goes. they've done that since Brunel invented them that's the entire idea of them.

the only reason they ever stop is to maintain the cutting head.

the speed is dictated by the amount of heat the cutting head is generating and the ability to cool the cutting head to limit wear, so you dont have to stop before breakthrough.

the expense in boring is largely due to politics.

look up the 'madrid miracle' it's what happens when a conservative government decides to build subway, all the cover your ass red tape gets ignored because no one attacks them for spending tax dollars."
Not when it comes to the Boring Co. Even Tesla coverage has a marked change since the Q3 profits.
">First of all, let's maybe wait until we see the final design until we call it bullshit.

I'm just going based on what has been released. I asked questions about what I saw and potential problems that would need to be solved. I didn't come in with any certain agenda. As for thunderf00t, I think he has a good opinion as to efficiency. Cars are not efficient people movers when compared to other modes of transportation. When I first heard of the concept the tunnel entries and exits being choke points are what I first thought of, breakdowns in the tunnel was a second.

>So far Elon's record is pretty good in achieving the ""impossible"" things he wants to do.

People remember the highlights but not the goals he hasn't hit. However, as I said before I'm open to hearing how it'll work or quell some of my concerns over the system. So far I've been criticized on having questions and offering up other solutions that were proposed by people smarter than myself. 

>How much pressure can cars hold? Maybe they can remove some of the air or maybe they can add some air flow in the right direction? Or all the cars going in the same direction push the air and it's not so bad per car?

I don't think there were any plans to evacuate or add air to the tunnel. The fact that it is designed for EVs only kind of tells me there won't be any meaningful ventilation other than what's necessary to keep appropriate levels of o2 (if even necessary).

>Second, even if it's not more cost efficient than metro, but still makes commercial sense and profit, what's the problem? There is no lack in vertical space underground. You can have both. Right now nothing happens.

Nothing. Personally, I don't care if he builds the tunnels or doesn't. I hope he does succeed in creating a company that can bore holes super cheap. It would be good for other reasons other than his tunnel. My one bone of contention is Elon says he's dropped the price of boring holes by a factor of 10, which he hasn't. His cost was about average for the size tunnel be built. I also don't think his pricing is accurate when it takes into account all the other tunnels that will be required, access points, etc. The last thing I question is it's efficacy. Let's say his tunnels can double the number of cars getting into the city. Ok, now how do they all get out of the tunnels into the city. It'd require a massive number of tunnel exits in my mind.

>He also did a video like this on BFR earth to earth. Completely shitting on it. And I just don't like his smugness.

Is he smug? Sure, but looking past that he does pose some interesting questions. Is Elon not smug when dealing with topics he thinks are silly? If you do outside research and look at other urban planners, engineers, etc he's not alone in this opinion. "

>There is plenty of this same crap from when SpaceX announced they would do rocket landings. ""it's impossible"", ""it's a scam"". Yada yada.

Shows how uneducated those people were, Elon wasn't the first to land a rocket. 

>If it fails you can shit on it, but let the man try.

So I have to reserve questions, and potential criticisms until he tries? If some simple questions can't be answered then what does that say about the solution? I'm curious does your openness about trying and letting it fail apply to Trump's border wall as well?"
"You're back to a regressive argument. They release new devices to give consumers new technology, and sometimes more options. There is 0 obligation for consumers to purchase a new device every year. I don't know in what world you blame the manufacturer for that."
"Or the Chinese, looking to get ahead of everyone else whilst they have the opportunity."
"My thoughts exactly! If the stock market isn't the place for speculation, I'm really not sure what is. That's what always cracks me up about people who get angry at Tesla valuations lol. Of course I also agree it's no place to dump your full portfolio haha"
"ya, grid lock from mechanical problems is what's going to kill this for general transport.

still might get used for something like the Chicago airport shuttle though."
"do you really think you're the first person to say ""hey we need more trains and monorails and subways""?  the reason why these solutions aren't implemented is because of all the political problems laying down the tracks through metro areas.  even with eminent domain, it's still incredibly time consuming and unbelievably expensive.  digging tunnels sidesteps all these issues."
"ya it does, it's basically ATO/ATC it's pretty basic stuff."
"I don't think he is ""wrong"" in what he said, I just think he deliberately doesn't discuss how those problems could be solved. This is a prototype. He likes to be controversial for clicks.

\>  Shows how uneducated those people were, Elon wasn't the first to land a rocket.

Blue Origins stunt wasn't even remotely comparable to landing a rocket from close to orbital velocity.

\> So  I have to reserve questions, and potential criticisms until he tries?  If some simple questions can't be answered then what does that say about  the solution? I'm curious does your openness about trying and letting  it fail apply to Trump's border wall as well?

One isn't like the other. The border wall is payed by tax payers & will destroy habitat and take people's land. None of those apply to Boring."
"Sugar manufacturers convinced the government that fat was bad in the 70s and 80s.

Tobacco manufacturers convinced the world their products were harmless for decades.

Car manufacturers keep telling us that gas is perfectly fine to use.

In a capitalist economy, a huge portion of blame for waste goes to the manufacturers.  More than consumers or any other entity.

Apple wants to make money far more than they want to help Mother Nature.  Otherwise Apple's products would be modular or bias for re-usability more than their current sealed designs."
">do you really think you're the first person to say ""hey we need more trains and monorails and subways""? the reason why these solutions aren't implemented is because of all the political problems laying down the tracks through metro areas.

Since when are political problems something Elon has backed away from? 

>even with eminent domain, it's still incredibly time consuming and unbelievably expensive. digging tunnels sidesteps all these issues.

Subways are in tunnels..."
">I don't think he is ""wrong"" in what he said, I just think he deliberately doesn't discuss how those problems could be solved. This is a prototype. He likes to be controversial for clicks.

I'm open to hearing how some of those could be solved. He goes into Elon's\Boring Co.'s explanation of how they plan to solve them, and then says why that won't work. If they have thought about that, then I'd just love for them to explain how they will deal with the throughput. 

>Blue Origins stunt wasn't even remotely comparable to landing a rocket from close to orbital velocity.

I was actually talking about the DC-X. I never said that it had been done on the scale of SpaceX or that there is no credit is due to SpaceX, but it wasn't completely virgin territory was my point. They definitely achieved something great, and should get credit. There however was a proof of concept before space-x was my point.

>One isn't like the other. The border wall is payed by tax payers & will destroy habitat and take people's land. None of those apply to Boring.

Tax payers and residents of LA would definitely have to live with the consequences should the tunnels be successful or not. Success means redoing city streets, which would have inconveniences, rerouting utilities, new traffic patterns. If it fails, who maintains those tunnels? If they collapse on themselves from not being maintained that could have impacts to the city above and surrounding underground utilities\structures. It wouldn't be a non-invasive process for those in that city, and I'm sure tax payers would foot some of that burden.

But I'll play your game, am I\anyone not allowed to have an opinion or have criticisms of Tesla? Nissan? Rivian? Boeing? GE? Oracle? Microsoft? Apple? Not being able to have opinions\criticism about someone's idea until they try it is a very bad mentality to have. If you can't defend your idea from basic questions\criticisms then that doesn't bode well for that idea. Trump's border wall is a perfect example. Everyone knows it's fucking stupid for so many reasons and Trump can't defend them. Why even waste the effort?"
"> Apple wants to make money far more than they want to help Mother Nature. 

That wasn't my argument. Musk also wants to make money far more than he wants to help mother nature as well. What I'm saying is that Apple makes an effort to making very energy efficient and recyclable products in an effort to do both fairly well (much better than their competition as well) while also selling a quality product. Nobody is putting them on a pedestal. They are a company that still has fiduciary responsibilities. But they also do far and away more than others in their field for the environment as well. Very much like Tesla.

"Now you are just making stuff up. Boring Company is a private enterprise, with private funding. If they sell somebody to the state then it will haven been proven to work. If they don't and there are tunnels, great, less roads for the taxpayer to maintain.

I personally don't believe Elon is interesting in scams, he genuinely seems to try to solve the traffic problems. And I also don't think ex SpaceX engineers are incompetent.

Either of those two implies a very cynical world view."
"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165866/apple-iphone-sales-cheap-battery-replacement

Thought I would venture back here for this gem.  "
">Now you are just making stuff up. Boring Company is a private enterprise, with private funding.

You literally just said:
""If it fails you can shit on it, but let the man try.""

So is it going to be a success? Or is there a potential for failure? Trying implies the chance of failure.

>f they sell somebody to the state then it will haven been proven to work. 

I'm not suggesting he sells it to the state. I'm saying if it fails, then it would fall to the state to fix the fuck up, because I assume boring co. wouldn't continue to foot the bill for a failed tunnel system.

>If they don't and there are tunnels, great, less roads for the taxpayer to maintain.

Oh, now it's replacing roads? Thought we were augmenting? Again, this only solves the issue for EVs which is a small % of the driving population right now and will be for the foreseeable future due to production constraints.

>Let me ask you this, what are you even suggesting? a) It's a scam or b) they don't know what they are doing?

I'm suggesting they are being dishonest with their ""cheapness"" by comparing large metro tunnels to their tiny no-frills tunnel. If you compare like for like they are no cheaper than any other company, their cheapness is because the tunnel is small, not because they dig tunnels better.

I am suggesting that with what they have released to date, I don't see how it will be efficient or cost effective or other basic questions answered. Yes the tunnel costs $10 mil\mile. Great. How many access points will be needed, what do each of those lifts cost? Will they be approved by the government as it requires tearing up a city street? What about utility relocation? What about the liability of having car elevators on the street? What happens in the event of car breakdown or fire in the tunnel? What would you do to prevent a terrorist from going into the tunnel and blowing it up and the surrounding tunnels? I imagine there will be more cars in the tunnel than entrances\exits, how will queueing work? These ""skates"" that are needed, are they automatically put on, or does someone need to put them on while on the elevator (which is time consuming), for these mid-tunnel insertions via parking spot, how will they ""merge"" into traffic without causing a slow down on the entire tube? What happens to all these cars once they get into the city? What stops someone from stopping their car in the tunnel? How is this more efficient than say creating the same tunnel structure and having dedicated ""people mover pods"" (kinda like a subway) and you hop on one from the suburbs? 

>I personally don't believe Elon is interesting in scams, he genuinely seems to try to solve the traffic problems. And I also don't think ex SpaceX engineers are incompetent.

I never said I thought it was a scam. I just don't see how you can solve traffic problems by introducing more ways to get cars to the same place. I also never said that space-x engineers are incompetent? Musk over promises a lot, and comes short. I just have a feeling this may be one of those times. 

>Either of those two implies a very cynical world view.

It doesn't require being cynical, just *skeptical*. "
This seems to show Apple sacrificed profit to help the environment.. Isn't this exactly the opposite of what you argued? Maybe I'm missing something?
There are no real production constrains on EVs going forward. Everybody is massively ramping up battery production on an exponential curve.
"They didn't do any of this for the environment, they did it because they got in huge trouble for underclocking older phones. Tim Cook is pissed that people are replacing batteries rather than buying new phones. They're going to take a huge hit due to unanticipated low demand for to lowering their battery swap price due to underclocking older phones. You really can turn anything into an Apple positive, can't you? They're a for-profit company, not your friend. "
"So all that, and that's what you hone in on? Companies are absolutely struggling to put EVs on a truly mass production scale. Tesla seems to be stuck at ~7-8k vehicles/week. We can't produce enough EVs currently to make a sizable dent in the driving public. Like I said optimistic estimates are 7% by 2021. They expect it will really be around 5%. Again, not new sales, I'm talking percent of cars actually on the road."
"> They didn't do any of this for the environment, they did it because they got in huge trouble for underclocking older phones. 

I never said they did. This is net positive for the environment, though. It doesn't really matter why.

> Tim Cook is pissed that people are replacing batteries rather than buying new phones. 

He's pissed he's losing money from it.. But I doubt he's pissed about that specifically.

> They're going to take a huge hit due to unanticipated low demand for to  lowering their battery swap price due to underclovking older phones. 

Rightfully so. They should take a hit for that. It was a bad practice.

> You really can turn anything into an Apple positive, can't you? 

I really don't think you're able to comprehend words properly...

> They're a for-profit company, not your friend. 

I literally said as much 2 comments ago. Nobody is suggesting they're a friend. I said they do more in their industry than others for the environment. That is verifiable fact. I compared them to Tesla, who also isn't a friend, but does more for the environment than their competition, yet still have fiduciary responsibilities, exactly like Apple. I'm sorry if these facts hurt your feelings or something. I encourage you to take a few deep breaths and re-read my comments if you somehow think I am suggesting Apple puts environment above profit.

Have a nice day! 
">Tesla builds 5x as many cars per month now than last year. How on earth is that ""being stuck""? They right now building a completely new china factory with more production lines.

I don't care if Tesla produced 1 car a week or 50k, what in the end matters is what percent of the population is driving them. But remind me, how long has Tesla been stuck at <5k per week 3 production?

>How hard is it to understand S curves? Technology adoption isn't linear and never was.

Where did I say it was? It doesn't change the fact that the rosiest prediction in terms of EV ownership is 7% by 2021. More realistically they are saying 4-5%. It's not nothing, but it's not like Tesla's will be 60% of the cars you'll see on the road in a few years either. You keep zooming in on Tesla production when I'm looking at a macroscopic level, where it actually matters."
You too!
I care
Did you just get the car?  I heard that is pretty common with a lot of cars a week or two after delivery.
Cool! I had those too and didn‚Äôt know what it was. Disappeared after a couple of days. 
"Not just a Tesla thing. I've seen this on my various Fords, too."
"Tell your robots to wash their hands, Elon. @elonmusk"
Try getting rid of them lol.  I scrubbed and scrubbed.  Still there months later.
I have these. No luck getting them off yet.
"Unsurprisingly, I had the exact same ones. The square ones took a bit of elbow grease to remove."
The robot is scared of fresh air. Turn off recirculation to scare it away.
"I have the exact same thing 6 months after delivery.  Anyone know how to properly clean the inside windshield?  
"
"Mine had those, too. Found a Youtube video on cleaning the inside of your windshield and it worked pretty well. The key is the Mr. Clean magic eraser! Now almost all of the time the windshield doesn't fog and when it does you can \*barely\* see one of the squares... probably just needs one more treatment.

"It's neat to see, but pretty much all cars are assembled this way so it's not Tesla specific."
My squares fog up less than the rest of the windshield... I‚Äôd like to take whatever oil or silicone residue is there and apply an even coat to hep defogging. The defrost running max heat and AC absolutely kills range. 
Oh is that what those are?! I have those and couldn‚Äôt figure them out. 
So THAT'S what the big circle in the middle of my windshield is!
I have this too. Anyone know how to get rid of it?
"These are so annoying. You think you got rid of them and nope, they just come back again from some weird angle. THEY WERE THERE THE WHOLE TIME!"
"I tried standard window cleaners plus a lot of scrubbing, none of them worked.

Had those but they were gone after ceramic coating. The guys at the shop told me they removed it but I have no idea how they did it.
I still have it after 10 years in my Volkswagen golf ü§£
I DON'T GET IT. 
"It's left by suction cups handling the glass, human workers use them too, our new skylights were always installed this way, the glass went in after all the other work was done to prevent breaks."
Human windshield installers outside of Tesla factories use suction cups too.
Consider yourself lucky. I have human hand prints on the inside of a piece of glass I can't reach to clean :/
Ew. Tentacles. You live by the sea?
"I have this too, and they don't come off. :("

So that‚Äôs what those are! I‚Äôve been seeing them since I picked up my car in August and couldn‚Äôt figure it out.
Windy left her mark.
Those are robot feet prints. 
"i have them too, 2 months in and still there"
"That is normal after a windshield installation, it will go away."
I have some of these on my windshield. Are these all on the outside or are some on the interior side of the glass? I haven‚Äôt tried wiping the interior side yet. 
This would sell well in Japan. They have a fetish on giant squid...
"Just wipe it down on the insude, that's what I did.  The square ones at least, I had the same ones.  Didn't have the circular ones."
A 50/50 mix of isopropyl alcohol and water will generally do the trick here.

My Honda CRV is over a year old and I still have the suction cup mark in the top left of my window.  Really noticeable when it gets foggy.
I work at a cadillac dealership cleaning cars and prepping them for delivery. This is very common.

Rubbing alcohol and a microfiber cloth should get most of that off 
Had the same on ours upon delivery. This would happen w/ any car manufacturer except any other dealer actually properly prepares the cars for delivery. :(  Tesla should really work to improve the delivery experience.

Seems like the dealer did a crap job of cleaning it up before delivery.
"It's extremely common as a lot of the fresh components continue to offgas for a few weeks. The offgassing creates a thin film on basically everything inside the car, but most noticeable on the windows."
"I got my car more than 4 years ago (not a Tesla though) and I can still see some suction cup marks and ""FR"" ""FL"" on the front doors' windows when there's some mist on the inside during winter. These things are hard to remove."
"My windshield has the square impressions. It also has two very prominent lines running diagonally across it and the entire windshield has what look like micro-abrasions throughout.

The service center said they were going to replace the windshield on the last visit but I got the car back and it's still the same windshield.

You'd think at least the square impressions could be cleaned off, but I've tried multiple times with multiple household glass cleaners inside and out."
My 3 is a year old and i still get those ghostly outlines after cleaning the window a couple times.
Mine's like that for the last 3 months. 
"My 2013 Audi still has these marks whenever the window fogs, no matter how I try to clean it, they are still there."
I used to be a car detailer at a dealership. Almost every new car had these when they were delivered. 
I don't even have a Tesla and my car is 5 years old now and I can still sometimes see the circles in my windshield.
"I've had mine since June -- I haven't washed the inside of the window yet, so when it frosts or fogs, that shows up. "
I can still see mine (delivery April 2017) in the right light.  I've thought about cleaning them but that part of the car is sooo far away. 
They likely didn't disappear but you just can't see them.  Those are actually on the glass and sometimes even a glass cleaning won't remove it and may require actual glass polishing.
Anybody using robotised product pick-up by CNC machinery can get complaints for these. In sheet metal shops I've heard complaints that customers see the suction cup marks though a layer of coating too as something (moisturising oil? oil from elsewhere? ) seems to be transferred from cups to material. 
They are factory kisses. Good luck out there little one!

Rubbing Alcohol? Microfiber? Baby wipes? Spit? Windex? Shamwow?
Cleaned trucks at a GMC dealer this last summer and it was no easy task getting these marks of those windows. Degreaser usually wouldn't work 
Did you clean the inside or outside?
Try steel wool + glass cleaner
RainX
0000 steel wool. It will not scratch the glass. 
"I also have them. Didn't notice until this morning driving into the sunlight so I haven't tried to get rid of them. Probably just needs a little elbow grease.

Wipe with a microfiber towel. If that doesn't work use an ammonia based glass cleaner. 
It's on the outside of your windshield.
"I would be careful with the magic eraser, the magic is that it's a very fine sanding sponge, and you could really mess up your glass using it."
"Same problem, and have had this exact same thought."
"Yep, suction cup marks."
I have the same marks. Haven't tried cleaning them yet. I'll update if I have any success. 
Same here. I was unable to get two spots off but my detailer removed both when he ceramic coated the car. 
"I still can see these on occasion with my M3.

My 2002 BMW M3."
As do I. I‚Äôve spent my career in IT so that I will be a necessary human friend/caretaker to them when they inevitably take over. XD

OFFGAS is my custom plate! I never thought about it this way haha
I've never experienced more off-gassing than in a corvette. Turns out a car made of resin off-gasses A LOT of fumes.

"It's very often silicon oil or grease. Water with detergent, some elbow grease and spit shine do the trick. If not, there are commercial silicon grease removers on the market."
Silly question but what have you used to clean the windows?
"I took a 1969 mini in for a roadworthy test in 1998, the tester put a trade plate on the back window, i still cannot fully remove the suction cup marks 20 years later, they reappear in certain foggy conditions..."
"At least you know they got it correct.....(""right"" lol).  
If it said ""LF"" on the right side I would worry."
Just as an experiment try olive oil.  You‚Äôd be surprised at how well olive oil works for removing residues. 
"really? I have a couple that show up at night time, it's been over a month."
The suction cups used on the sheet metal can get a build up of the stamping agents on them. This build up will be visible on the finished unit if it‚Äôs not contained in the paint shop. The stamping agent is a release agent or lube.

It is actually lightly etched into the glass.  Mine has these as well and even 100% IPA didn't remove them.  I had to use a dual action polisher with Griot's glass polish and pads to remove them.

Try 50/50 mix of isopropyl alcohol and water. It cleans windows far better than windex etc.
Try a solvent in case it is oil/sticky based.
I tried acetone. Didn't work.
What if you used some anti-fog on the window. If the window never fogs up you never see the spots.
"Usually would just leave them after hitting with window cleaner. Barely noticeable unless I was spraying the windows and razors wouldn't scrape off the marks. 
Edit:I wouldn't use steel wool near any part of a car while on the job.  "
I forgot to mention that. 
So I'm guessing you have scrubbed the inside of your windshield a dozen times too to try and remove it? If the robot was loading it from inside the car you would have leaks; the glass is on the outside in the metal stack.
Buying new cars or scuba diving?
I also fart a lot.
"They're made of composite panels with a ton of resin. IIRC the latest innovation they added was using hollow/air-beads in the composite to reduce weight.

"Well, they better start paying me, because I patented the sun."

"That's why I layer the dash with a cheap set of vinyl floor mats from the dollar store.

They only get used for that one specific task so they are always clean.

Once the dash is protected as well as the acoustically transparent black cloth, because my protection layer goes to the glass and down at the base of the windscreen, detail cleaning the inside of the windscreen takes much less time and no added lint on the dash or speaker cloth."
"The delivery folks at my SC told me the same.  They call it ""detailing spray""."
I would recommend against this. It's a micro-abrasive. 
Maybe a diluted degreaser like Simple Green?
You can also get a bug removal sponge and lubricate it with window cleaner. It should take most of that off and then you can spray the windows and wipe them with a microfiber. 
Rookie mistake ... probably applied too much.  Only thing to do now is apply balsamic vinegar liberally to all affected and unaffected areas.
"Just add romaine lettuce and you're all set.

...assuming you survive the food poisoning."
hmmm...
Maybe a nice lager would do the trick?
"He goes so fast I honestly get a bit motion sick sometimes.

"But make sure to measure the parts separately as 50 mL water + 50 mL isopropanol does not add to 100 mL :)

"Really? Steel wool was a key material we used during details. Now it seems to have transitioned to magic erasers since they are easier to work with. Wed only use it after other things didn't work, like small brushes etc."
"No, I have not scrubbed the inside at all.  I believe it has a different finish / coating than the outside and don't want to damage it.  That's why I asked how to clean the inside windshield.
"
Farting.

That took me longer than I'm willing to admit to get.
"I'm going to assume you're referring to isopropyl that isn't fully concentrated. (Which most places sell 70% to 90%, with the other % being water)

Either way, it should be fine. If it is that pesky though, considering a bottle of isopropyl isn't that expensive, I'd try it full strength on there to try and get rid of it tbh"

[deleted]
What specifically did y'all use them for? I just said that because we take a lot of precautions not scratch paint/glass and I've never seen steel wool used personally. 
Windex or take it to your SC; I'm sure you'll have it back in 3 or 4 months.

"I've tried it on clear coat paint and it leaves the surface dull and matte. It requires polishing afterwards to restore shine. Maybe the glass is of sufficient hardness to not be damaged, but I would have to see it happen by mistake. I recommend anyone test a small inconspicuous spot first before going whole hog on their windshield. "
Honestly common rubbing alcohol concentration (70%) probably works fine. Too high of a concentration evaporates too fast and thus can actually be less effective.
Yeah wat??? 
"No, it doesnt.  Miscable liquids when mixed, do not have additive volume.  The make a slightly more dense fluid which takes less volume than when the 2 parts are separate.  Chemical Engineer FTW. :-)"
"I think that he might be saying that almost all the isopropyl alcohol that you can buy is not 100% pure isopropyl alcohol, and that you'll often find 50, 75, or 90% dilutions at most stores. "
"On the interior when the rubbery plastic parts have a... grain to them. It pulls out dirt because it can get down in the super small crevices. It can easily tear away the rubber if you push too hard though.

I've also used it to remove stubborn window chalk on used cars that have pitted windshields."
"My bad, I meant to say to use ""full strength"" diluted isopropyl. As in just the normal stuff you get out of the bottle and not to bother mixing it with water and stuff if the suction cup marks are as difficult to remove as people say :)"
"Alcohol and water are mutually soluble. 

Just like when you dissolve sugar in water, you can add a small amount of alcohol to water without changing the volume much. You can also add a small amount of water to alcohol without changing the volume much. If you mix them 50-50, then they both dissolve into the other just a little, so the final volume is smaller than the components. Like with dissolving sugar in water. 

Think of it like mixing rocks and sand. Imagine you have 10LBS of both rocks and sand. When mixed you have 20lbs, but the volume will be lower than the rocks + sand. 

The effect with alcohol and water is quite small, and shouldn‚Äôt matter when making a cleaning solution. "
This is not what he was saying 
Ah makes sense. He just chose to explain it in the worst possible way 
TIL! Thanks! 
"This is incredible, TIL!"
I just love where this thread went.
"Yes I realize that now, but given the limited information that he gave I (and other people who were wondering) felt that it was the most likely explanation. "
"Nope. But, I edited my post to explain."
No problem! I love sharing my enthusiasm for science. 
Where are the cars imported from? What are the fees/taxes/incentives to go along with importing an electric car?
My wife thought I was crazy getting one in Montana.  You are on a whole another level.  It will be fun to see the global Tesla market ramp up in the coming years.

"Coming from Ger, I know from experience with rentals that the driving styles can be somewhat more aggressive in Southern countries like Italy, Greece, Spain. Fender benders and bumping while parking are more frequent. 

Regarding this, what is your experience in Turkey? Do you use your car to run daily errands? How does the intricate sensor system handles dents and benders? 

Interested in a road trip down in own car. Thanks for taking the time. Great AMA!"

"I just wanted to say that I visited the VW club in Istanbul a few years ago and I found the people wonderful. I had a great time and I was taken care of very well.

Wow this is cool
Are you members more in Ankara or Istanbul?
"Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier or cheaper if guys imported for the UAE? Or no?

Based on your information, can you import Teslas to other countries like Iraq or Jordan, etc? Or its not a great idea?"
"How do you charge at home? In Turkey, 240v is standard, so do you install wall connector or use mobile connector that came with the car?

Does this mean most owners have garage? Which is uncommon in Istanbul :)"
What's it's like dealing with the average customer there? Do people question why you're selling electric cars or haggle you because you're in an unsupported market?

They‚Äôre imported from the Netherlands. European center. A vehicle with a 1600c and higher volume engine is taxed 90-120% whereas EVs are only between 3-5%. 2000cc and up is 160% and 1600cc lower is 60%. So an entry Model S 75D costs the same as 525xDrive. And p100D costs MUCH less than an M5. Not even accounting for operation cost advantages. 
So. Much. Untapped. Potential. 
"We had zero DC chargers until around 18 months ago. Now we have CCS and Chademo chargers. Around 10-15 of them in the country. There are lots of charger investors right now but not enough evs being sold. So I can roadtrip to the west of the capital anywhere in the country but I sure would appreciate more chargers. Also obviously no Superchargers. Our cars are SuC virgins. Also a rumored CCS adapter would be amazing because we‚Äôd see +45kW for the first time ever. (We only saw 22kW until two years ago) Only official EV sales are BMW i3 and Renault ZOE. Not even Leaf was ever sold here due to Nissan of Turkey being... (you complete yourself)

People are interested in EVs and market fits it. Yet we need to work to raise consciousness. "
We remove the shelf beneath the screen and replace the card from the sim extender module. We need to use Vodafone only as other operators have conflicting APN settings and a service would need to change those and that‚Äôs not possible. 
"If it‚Äôs something we can do we do it here. Otherwise closest service is Graz. 1000 miles and 5 borders away. It‚Äôs very difficult to buy parts too so we never attempt large body work. Also even when you undertake the one way cost of 1000‚Ç¨ to Graz, Graz service only gives appointments in 3 weeks notice. So it‚Äôs a bad dream to get something going wrong. "
"- We don‚Äôt do yearly. One owner for example got their first service at 100k kms. Some who don‚Äôt do high mileage never do. 

- Yes. You put it on the ship which leaves it in Trieste. Then a tow truck gets it from Trieste to Graz. Total cost is more than 1500$. 

- it handles great. Roads here are relatively well kept. (Main roads at least) "
His attitude is literally political. He supports them but we still find relatively lower tax to be a tax. It‚Äôs not an incentive. More incentives are needed.

It is my channel.
Not yet. We need Euro spec ones. I have a day 1 res. and I‚Äôm expecting closer to summer ‚Äò19. 
Nav on AP AFAIK is only active in North America right now. entire european continent didn‚Äôt get it yet. But AP works great. 
"We had a devaluation a few months ago. 1USD was around 3,8 liras and now it is 5,2 liras. Devaluation meant inflation so everything is more expensive now. With current inflated prices 100km costs 12 liras in my Model S. So 2$. 

With a gasoline car it would have been 45 liras. 8,5$. 

Also non gas cars are exempt from the biannual traffic tax. Which starts from 250$ a year and goes up to 7k $ a year for a car like M5. "
Wait do Teslas run with diesel or what?
i guess if you can afford a car like this in turkey you probably dont care and just get the dents fixed?
"All makes of cars usually get a community developed around them, as service costs are too high and Turks like sharing experiences.

Most communites develop a logo and make a sticker out of it, then getting it recognized to service locations to get discounts on labor and parts. This also allows them to spot eachother in traffic, in which case, the spotted owes something, tea, to the spotter. "
"We have members in a lot of cities. Most in Istanbul, Ankara and ƒ∞zmir of course. Surprisingly there are members from Gaziantep, Konya, Malatya, Antalya etc."
Most likely in Istanbul
Istanbul‚Äôs population is about three times higher so I would guess Istanbul.
We are in EU trade zone so EU makes the most sense.
No it is the same setup in Europe. 220V and 380V 3 phase AC. Exactly the same as Europe and cars are imported from Europe. 
Turkey has 220v not 240v i think.
I know that our club has empowered lots and lots of people to buy Teslas. We did a blind case study with Jaguar around the time of the launch of the I-Pace. Tesla owners were in a room answering questions and they didn't from who. I was honored to hear most of them say I bought it because there was this club. Otherwise they wouldn't have the courage.

something about turkey? better bring politics.
There are honestly tonnes of differences between being in a non core market and an official Tesla markets. I see so many complaining on trivial stuff about Tesla. We can‚Äôt even get our hands on 12V batteries.

I love a ErdogAllah so shut up
Oh I see how it could be off putting but this is from our 4th of July passage. We organised and EV only pass and every car on the street being silent made a great effect overall. It was an event to raise awareness. 
"Their club, their country. They are entitled to decorate their cars with their country‚Äôs flag. People plaster the American flag, in every imaginable form, on their cars here in the United States. How is this any different?"
And Americans slap their flag all over the outside of their homes...same shit.
ahhahaah what the fuck some of you have ISSUES
TIL It's bad to like your own country's flag
"Americans like you lack self awareness, don't you? America must be the #1 country in the world when it comes to flag usage, they are everywhere, literally everywhere. You have no right to complain about another country's use of flags."
"Cool, no one cares. "
I somewhat dislike your anti nationalist attitude 
It seems to be a regional thing. I was eating in a Syrian restaurant. They were playing music videos in background. I was impressed with large number of Syrian flags shown on videos. Same with Libya. The people in this region seem to be very nationalistic and patriotic about their countries. 
"turks are often overly nationalistic with their country and flag, especially those in europe (lol)"
Oh gosh you're paying more tax than car for some cars...
If you still answer may I ask total cost?
"I imagine each European country would have a region-specific feature / customization like the default language, or MPH vs KPH for example. Which region config are these Teslas on? Can you, hypothetically order a RHD version destined for the UK market, but to Turkey (or any other country)?"
The Model 3 is going to be crazy in Europe.  It's such an awesome car I think itll be hard to chose other non Tesla EV models over the 3.
Same here in Australia. The federal government is right wing nut jobbers and don‚Äôt believe in anything other than coal burning cars and trucks!!! Hopefully the next election will be in May next year to throw the bums out and we can all breathe a sigh of relief and start living in the 21st century!!

"> We need Euro spec ones.

Why exactly? Because of the charging port?"
You‚Äôre not missing out in my opinion.  I almost never use the feature on purpose unless I‚Äôm okay with pain that day. 
"> 1USD was around 3,8 liras and now it is 5,2 liras. Devaluation meant inflation so everything is more expensive now. 

Pro tip for everyone else: Buy apps, or subscribe to Apple Music on the Turkish region, they haven't updated the currency rates. "
No. I am just asking for comparison purposes.

"Ignore the idiots on Reddit, don't entertain the trolls. I've enjoyed your comments so far, hopefully in the next few years you'll have more support options!

What's the general reaction from the public when they see one? I imagine many aren't aware of the Tesla brand at all, is this accurate?"
I thought this was pretty cool.  Thanks for doing it.
"> We can‚Äôt even get our hands on 12V batteries. 

Am I understanding this correctly that standard gas vehicles in turkey use something other than a 12V battery?"
More like Erdogan is pretty close to Hitler in some aspects.

"OP, please don't pay that idiot any mind. Just a dumb arrogant fool. You are fine to put your flags on your cars anytime you want. "
"When you say 4th of July, do you mean the American holiday? Or does that mean something else in Turkey?"
"Ya, this is weird how many trolls there are in this sub. "
As long as it's across the board. Remember what Merkel did with the German flag?
"turkey, syria and libya in the same region? lol"
"Yes we have entry level Range Rovers costing 200,000‚Ç¨ :) Some makers do small engine versions only for this country. 1600cc 5 series for example. :)"
There are several countries where this is true. I Hong Kong if you buy a car that's $80k you pay roughly 125% tax on it. Yes that means you pay 100k in tax
"That‚Äôs true for all cars in Singapore. All cars get taxed at least 100% of their value (higher if they‚Äôre luxury cars), and then you have to get a Certificate of Entitlement that allows you to even own a license plate, and that‚Äôs based on a bidding system. Right now it‚Äôs at a low of SGD 25,000 (US $18,000), but it used to be as high as S$ 100,000 (US $ 73,000).

Plus, there‚Äôs an additional tax/rebate based on a car‚Äôs emissions.

Oh, and did I mention that you only get to keep the car for 10 years? After 10 years, you either have to scrap the car or apply to renew the COE, which means you have to bid full price for another COE. That can only be done for up to another 10 years, and by then you HAVE to scrap the car."
"Same in Egypt, and given with the level of income disparity there, you only see small cheap cars like corollas and the like, or high end, S class etc. you‚Äôll never see a Camry or mid size sedans as they cost a lot, and whomever has enough money for them, has enough money for high end cars. With a few exceptions like cars with diplomatic plates, people that bring their cars from the gulf, etc. on higher end cars you pay like 300-400% tax."
"Welcome to Turkey. When you buy one car for yourself, you buy one for the government too."
"Happens to alot of Asian countries too.

And they earn 1/5 the money yet pay 2x the cost of a car.

:s"
"In Denmark, IIRC, the tax can be up to 180%. And that's why some countries have a lot of small cars and a lot of people can't afford cars."
"Sure. Entry Model S 75D was 105-110k euros to import everything included. For a P100D it is 150-170k euros I think. Of course this was all before the trade wars thing. When Donald Trump put sanctions on Turkey selling aluminium to the US Erdogan retaliated and taxed a lot of American goods, including 120% tax on American cars. I didn't mention this in my original reply because I think it will be removed in a few months but this has been the case for the past 2-3 months. So demand for brand new is zero for those past few months."
"We have the Euro standart. Metric, kph and English language. We config on the country selection 'Other Europe' and pickup the cars from Tilburg NL assembly center with an export declaration. So we don't pay NL tax but we have to show Turkish import docs and taxes to Tesla within two weeks or we have to pay NL tax as well."
"Only thing I'm worried is that even Model 3 is a bit big for many European and Asian countries mass market. Wish there could be an even smaller Tesla, like a hatchback size."
Except price. It‚Äôs not a very affordable car unfortunately. 
"australias economy is very depending on ore and coal. no way you would support ""the enemy""."
It doesn‚Äôt. and basically yes. We found Vodafone users who tried replacing their sims were always having those ‚Äòdata working‚Äô cars. I‚Äôm very curious about Model 3 sim card location as Euro deliveries get closer and no one cares about this in US obviously. :)
Graz is the closest when driving. 
"[Graz is closer than Vienna by about 40km](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Istanbul,+Turkey/graz/@44.021489,19.9503575,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x14caa7040068086b:0xe1ccfe98bc01b0d0!2m2!1d28.9783589!2d41.0082376!1m5!1m1!1s0x476e3587173065bb:0xfe8e8ad1d2dfdd9b!2m2!1d15.439504!2d47.070714)"
Graz is close to where Arnold Schwarzenegger grew up.
Not that I know of. Turkey never taxed EVs with their battery sizes.
He mentioned Elon was helping with their EV program or something to that effect. Is this true?
That's not how you determine dictator status.
Yes and the three phase grid. 
They did update app prices recently but some developers lowered the price for turkey.

That is some high level bullshit I see there. 
Yes but it has this cool factor like everywhere else. Everyone thinks it is super cool and the future. Operation costs are envied but upfront cost makes them think it is a rich toy. 
We have a huge 12V battery market but we fail to find one that fits Tesla and satisfies the system so it doesn't give out the 12V battery error. There's one auto electronics store right know who claims to have found it and they reverse the poles of the battery while fitting it into the Teslas but because they have this monopoly advantage they charge x10 to Tesla owners. So whenever one of us visits a Tesla service with their car they bring at least 2 12V batteries back in their trunk.
Stop trashing our glorious leader

"I think he meant 4th of July equivalent of Turkey, which is the 29th of October (Republic Day of Turkey)."
Who is Merkel 
"I was gonna say, didn't know of any recent 525. I assume it's a smaller engine than the 528 here? "
How is this ok
"Well yeah HK and Singapore have a reason, they have no space to fit all the cars if they didn't inflate the price. As far as I know, Turkey doesn't have space problem (correct me if I'm wrong)"
"Norway is similar but not as extreme. We have had a luxury tax on cars since WWII that made us hardened to expensive cars and big engines.  

This means (like the BMW discussion on here) that where the top spec model line ended in Norway was where the entry engine size was in the US.  

EVs are thus insane value for money in Norway even well down in what we could call middle class in Norway. I catch myself forgetting that a 35k USD car is expensive elsewhere when I'm on Reddit. (Though car prices have really stagnated since perhaps 2000)."
How's the Tesla/EV situation there? I imagine long-range EV wouldn't really have an advantage there given how short the trips are (correct me if I'm wrong)
"That would be my dream car. I live in an old medieval city, the roads built for horses and carts are not kind to big cars."
"A one seater Tesla like a golf cart that was restricted as the only vehicle within a city centre would be amazing. People assume it's their God given right to drive their pollution spewing mercedes through the streets where people live, and it's sickening."
"Depends, there are plenty of people driving around with Audi A4's and BMW 3's... With options they are probably similar in price to the 3.

Although tbf you see the saloon model probably more often than the sedan."
As a tesla employee from the US I find this to be amazing 
"I'm sure Ingineerix has found it among all the work he put into the Model 3. You can check out his videos on YouTube , but I don't know if he ever mentions the SIM location at any point since I wasn't paying attention to that specifically. You can also try contacting him directly."
I know that they have a deal to launch satellites with SpaceX but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything official in the EV department. Even if there‚Äôs consulting or whatever it‚Äôs not made public 
 dictators arent elected.
"His point was that they don't acknowledge (or understate) it, whilst US whites will beat themselves up over the slightest opportunity because of their past (as you just did).

Not that I necessarily believe his comment, since I have no idea what actually took place in Turkey (not having researched it). But it's important to reply to his point."

Charging infrastructure is basically non-existent except from the CBD, and most people can‚Äôt install chargers at home because ~82% of people live in public housing. The carparks in these are separate buildings, with no designated parking lots, so home charging is impossible for most of the population. Very few people live in landed property (separate/terraced houses), and most private homes are condominiums, with the same problem as public housing (designated lots are very rare).

The government isn‚Äôt really interested in supporting EVs, hell, we actually imposed a carbon tariff on the first Tesla that was imported ([check that story out here](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/electric-car-tesla-slapped-with-15000-tax-surcharge)). Kinda might be because 20% of our GDP comes from refining oil, although the government‚Äôs toooootally not corrupt at all and not engaged in crony capitalism.

It‚Äôs a shame, really. EVs would be perfect here. We‚Äôre ‚Öî the size of NYC, and most trips are usually 40km max, usually 20km or less. Small enough that Supercharging would be unnecessary, and level 2 would usually be enough."
"Oh God I see the value of that but it'd just turn London into an even bigger clusterfuck, albeit a more economical friendly one."
"> A one seater Tesla like a golf cart that was restricted as the only vehicle within a city centre would be amazing

Renault Twizy?"
"The discussion was compared to other EVs which are mostly far cheaper (although inferior in many ways). The A4 starts at about 35k eur + car tax (VAT included) while the 3 will probably start at about 55 with VAT (45k‚Ç¨x1.24). It‚Äôll probably not get much car tax in most places but it‚Äôs still much more expensive than a base A4 which probably most are. The 3 will also need options. 

A sedan and saloon are the same thing. "
Will be quite a bit more expensive than those 2 in my country.
Have you see the price of the e-tron?

"Plenty of ""not dictators"" win elections. In some cases they even get 90%+ of the votes which tells you all you need to know."
"So you don't consider Putin a dictator?

You can't use ""I was elected by the people"" as your non-dictator excuse if you assassinate your political opponents and dissenters and conduct massive disinformation campaigns to manipulate your constituency."
"go ask them, nobody wants to talk about people's death in a hobby club"
U‚Äôre gay
"Hasn't been that way for a while. The last 10+ years, the 35i engine has been a 3L"
I think it went out the window around the time all the in between models came out. I can‚Äôt figure out what they‚Äôre trying to do with their lineup anymore.
"> I doubt the geopolitics allow Turkey to be lax on taxes in general.

Can you elaborate a little more on this?"
"The Twizy could have a lot of improvements, like proper windows, but it's a start."
"Excuse me, I meant the extended version, is hatchback the correct word?

Isn't the 3 going to start at around 35k with the base battery - whenever that hits the market.."
I might be wrong but isnt a dictator a person who isnt liked by the population but still rules the country by force? 
You mad?
Pretty much fighting with every neighboring country (to varying degrees) including western countries (US and NATO) and has effectively become an authoritarian country after 2017 parliamentary referendum.
"35 in the us is not 35 in Europe unfortunately. I also personally don‚Äôt count the 35k model as being available until it actually is. It‚Äôs been a long time already without it. 

Maybe you mean an estate/wagon?"
"Not at all. A dictatorship can often be tyrannical but it's not necessary. It's when one person has near total power in a country. It's usually through scapegoating and demagoguery that they accomplish this.

Hitler (I'm not calling anyone Hitler, just using him as an example dictator) blamed Germany's problems on on Jews, the rest of Europe, and things that required extreme action to solve. People like being told that they're not the cause of their own problems and they ate it up. Hitler was elected by popular vote.

Another less historical example. Chancellor Palpatine manipulated the Galactic Senate to grant himself ultimate power over the republic, eventually dissolving the Senate itself. He was loved by his people but he was still a dictator."
Yes very much
"Hmm, you're right. I guess you could call him dictator then."
I apologize.
Apology accepted
