"I can't imagine the Facebook comments are good, based on the comments I saw on their page last year when they did an inspection of the Semi."
"As a driver, I cannot wait to see, hopefully drive these. When Elon first made the tweet announcing the electric truck, a ton of other drivers laughed at me and said that was stupid everytime I brought it up. The ""Twisted trucker"" Facebook page is still very skeptical to say the least...."
Ya misleading title... the truck isn’t pulling a 75k load. it’s operating at 75k (load + truck weight)

"Donner pass grades are for real, y'all."
CNBC headline tomorrow: Tesla engineers poorly estimated range of their new Semi as shown in new tests.
I don't understand the mindset behind some of the comments on the Facebook post. Like the guy claiming he will quit his job if his boss asked him to drive one of these liberal tree-hugging pieces of crap (paraphrased). What are they worried about? The businesses won't buy them if they cost more to operate or delay their shipping.
"Hauling (9) UltraBlocks @ 4,690 Lbs. each=42,200 Lbs. Tesla Semi Truck & Trailer = 75,000-42,200 = 32,800 Lbs.

That is less than a typical truck trailer set up. People have been speculating that the batteries are so immense that the truck is super heavy but apparently not. Rule of thumb is truck and empty trailer are 40,000 Lbs. and max. hauled load is 40,000 Lbs. for a total of 80,000 Lbs. (math!). So based on this FB post the Semi is as light as a canary and another Tesla engineering achievement. Coming for you Daimler....in 2025."
"The Semi is a Class 8 truck--80,000 lb gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR). The driver says his truck plus the concrete totals 75,000 lb, which is what his ticket says when he weighed his rig at the truck scales.

Assuming that the Semi weight is 20,000 lb and the flatbed trailer is maybe 8000 lb empty, then the concrete blocks weigh 47,000 lb.

The caption on the picture is misleading. The load is 47,000 lb."
"Is this still launching this year? I remember them saying deliveries are supposed to begin in 2019, but I feel like they haven't mentioned this publicly or in quarterly earnings statements in a long while. Maybe I'm just missing something."
"This is huge. I work for a rigging company and we pull heavy loads from 60,000 to 150,000#

Our Teamsters would be so down with this technology. Let’s do it Tesla!"
Those blocks are sort of aerodynamic. Place them inside a box trailer
Any clue when the road weight limit becomes a problem?
[deleted]
Man the Tesla Semi looks super cool. Best looking Semi by far.
This is a good thing. Anyone stuck behind a diesel rig going up a hill knows this.
I hope electric trucks replace the ones on the road. The exhaust is enough to make a bird drop dead on the spot.
Ooooohh. Drag race!  Tesla wins again.
"It's not pulling 75,000 pounds. It's combined GVW is 75,000. This is an important distinction because one of the concerns with a battery powered truck is how much will it weigh, which determines how much can be loaded onto it's trailer."
When your test driver breaks your NDA to a cop and they immediately post it to social media :facepalm:
how many kw are packed in these trucks?
I wonder what kind of battery pack the semi will have and how fast it will charge.
"Just watched a video on tfl car the other day where they towed with a model X. They were getting 1 mile per 1%.  Going uphill they used 53 miles of range in a 8 mile drive.  So, hopefully they have this figured out for the semi."
"The main problem I'm seeing with the truck is the range. It has a 300mile and 500 mile (both loaded, for the larger variation it claims 630miles unloaded). When you factor an average speed of 60 mph, it will take just over 8 hours to fully drain. 8 hours is when the manditory 30minute break is needed. So my question becomes, how much charge can you get back in 30 minutes? From what I understand most truck drivers spend far longer then 8 hours on the road per day so this may not be feasible for our current system.

I see the tesla truck being utilized more in short range, low hours hauling. It would need to be able to charge ridiculously fast for it to be able to fit the current mold."
"To all the truckers saying how dangerous these are, all I can ask is: how many semi-truck related accidents happen annually? 500,000 with an average annual death count of 5000. Something tells me it's time for change."
Tesla racing trucks sound pretty badass
Meanwhile stock down 30% in 30 days... :(
"Imagine how long the range would be if it was 75,000 pounds with feathers instead of concrete"

Anybody know what the range estimates are?
"This is awesome.  Will it be able to handle PTO equipment, [like cranes](http://berlinlumber.com/moffett_trk.jpg)?"
I'll be ready for the consumer grade small to mid-sized truck in about 5yrs. Please have it ready for me.
Please please make side guards standard.
"Is anyone considering buying one of these instead of the truck?
Are civilians able to buy a semi if licensed appropriately?"
All those haha reacts.. such ignorance.
34 metric tons. Nice. What range is expected?
"https://www.ultrablock.com/assets/pdf/ultrablock-brochure.pdf

4320 lbs full block

4,320*9=38,880 lbs (~17,635 kg) load

75,000-38,880=36,120 lbs (~16,384 kg) Truck"
I can see Independent contractors owning these vehicles but not sure for big transportation companies. I work in the industry and specifically Intermodal which is drivers picking up loads to and from the rail yards. Our trucks are used 24/7.
Is it 75000 lbs of freight? Or is that total vehicle weight when loaded?
"That must be incorrect. Class 8 vehicles (semis like this one) are rated for 80,000 lbs, and all manufacturers boast fuel economy at that weight. I don't see any reason why Tesla wouldn't be testing with 80,000 lbs?"
How long do these take to charge? I imagine these trucks would be excellent to use for local hauls. Drivers already have to wait forever at certain rails and for live loads. Might as well get a charge while they’re at it.
Long Tesla?
"""Tesla Truck"" ... clickbait! 😉"
What is the range with it fully charged? Super cool stuff and will they offer a version without the nose?
I can’t wait for this just because of the heaps of a difference it would make in the road noise in and around neighbourhoods.
Do you not remember posting how much the trailer definitely doesn’t weigh?
"Anybody with a background in aerodynamics know how much a factor it'd be that it's pulling the right weight, but not such a big box? Are we talking a 5% difference or less or more?"
doesn't wind and aerodynamics play a big role when you got a trailer on?
"Wow, 600 miles is enough for a day shift driver and a night shift driver. These things will really change the industry."
2.5 tons short of the legal limit!
"The real test for range would be going up mountains and the change of grade in the road. Hope Tesla Truck, Electric F-150, and Rivian have some good range for trucks since towing will consume a lot of power just by looking at the power consumed when the Model X towing stuff. Hope they can advertise something like 300miles maxed capacity towing."
But why does an electric truck have an IFTA sticker? Taxes on electricity used in different states perhaps?
One thing I’ve always wondered is are they gonna have special charging stations for semis since their so huge? Can’t imagine them trying to get into a congenital one
"So, per federal law, that trailer is allowed 80000#.  Why is the truck being tested at 75000#?  5k is a huge amount of weight, and recently the driver cost has been significant.  Therefore, it's not a proper test to run at 75k.  It's the difference between taking 12 trips or 13 trips. Based on rough estimates and experience."
Electric truck sounds better than attack helicopter when  I identify gender on my college application.
"Impressive. Electric trucks are the future, just hopefully they won't be as ugly"
"I don’t see much of a sleeper , lots of dead space not being used .... hope production versions address this .."
"Wait so truckers who do long haul stuff overnights and such are going to go to sleep with the temptation of autopilot.

Hope they work out any kinks before then"
"I don’t see this taking over the American fleet of long distance trucks, so here in the Midwest I don’t think it would make a huge difference, however, in the coasts this brings huge potential and I’m excited for the changes"

"You know Daimler already has an electric medium fleet out with customers for testing, right? The heavy duty version is being delivered this quarter. I know Volvo isn't far behind.

It's great but damn it look ugly
"Sure it was a marketing stunt but didn’t ford’s new electric f-150 pull 1,000,000lb?"
Aren’t these self driving kinda? Imagine how much easier it’ll be for all the truck drivers to smoke meth.
"The truck just looks ugly for me, looks like lightning McQueen’s truck on steroids"

Will it explode like the car did in the post I saw yesterday?
"Given the load is small in area, they probably have a fair amount of savings in aero compared to a full sized covered trailor."
"Wouldn't it be more effective to use hydrogen instead of batteries? These batteries weight tons, and surely take a lot of time to recharge."
I wish they look so lame I hope they can still make them look like the peterbuits this are cool
but can it drive side by side with other trucks on a two-lane highway for 5 miles at a time?
Electric motors have far more torque than ICE engines.  These are just dramatic demonstrations to illustrate their towing capacity.  People always fall for the dramatic demonstration schtick.
"Tesla Prototype****.  Nothing is fielded yet, Elon Time.  

Also, range estimates on a near no drag load.  Not the same as a trailer with 50x the surface area."
"I see this pulling light loads like produce or milk, i doubt it could be used for heavy loads, would be better for light industry but diesel is still needed these days. Tech is not there yet"
Delivered to a Tesla service center the other day. An empty cinder block building with a lift in one room and a desk in the other room. No bathroom. One worker who worked two days a week. Let's get this stuff into the present before we worry about the future. I couldn't imagine buying such an expensive car to then bring it for service to a place like that.
Concrete blocks? Pull something useful then we’ll talk.
Sounds like propaganda to get people to invest in more Tesla stonks again.
Lol probably not the future. Just saying. Nothing will beat a good ole gas engine
...but does it have to look like shit? This looks like something a 10 year old would draw when asked to design the truck of the future
https://imgur.com/WzD4LP9
"Trucks have to stay under 80k gross weight, right?  So are they doing 75k because that’s the realistic weight in order to assure you don’t exceed 80k with variation between scales?"
Cant wait for that ram 69 guy on Twitter
"Well i would be shittalking it too if I were a trucker, since it has FSD capability built in.."
"A lot of truckers like to shit on the Tesla truck. As a gadget nerd who likes the idea of electric vehicles and also happens to be a truck driver, I’m cautiously optimistic. The biggest problem with the Tesla truck is range and charging time. They’re claiming 500 miles loaded, but it takes hours to charge. My Kenworth can go over a thousand miles (more like 1300) on a full tank, and it only takes a few minutes to refill. Also, we can easily exceed 500 miles in a day. My personal record is 714 in a 65mph limited truck. (We have a hard limit of 11 hours of driving per day, within a larger window of 14 hours from beginning to end, while working for no longer than 8 hours in a single span, with a minimum 30 minute break to reset that 8 hour limit.)"
Did they give any reasoning?
"I posted articles to my facebook early on and the local reaction was pretty negative. This is rural PA where redneck is the default mode for a lot of the people around here. Trucking companies have only started to purchase automatic trucks, because it use to be some of the drivers would refuse to even drive them... 'because real men don't drive automatic trucks'."
"As a driver, what is your opinion of the cabin layout? Seems really cool to me but I don’t drive a semi."
"The problem for truck drivers in the future is that they are trying to automate these for highways. No one will be driving these at some point. We will still likely need drivers in cities for a while, but long distance drivers will probably be out of a job."
Does the eletricity is cheaper than oil?
"Yup, 80k is the limit so the truck would put it over the limit and I don't think the CHP would be posting it."
Thanks for pointing that out.  I was seriously wondering how they had the cab + trailer under 5klbs.
"Yeah, those blocks are 5-6k each. We use these all the time for guys to tie off to with their fall arrest systems."
Can't believe I had to go so far down for this.
"I assume that regenerative braking is a thing for the semi.  If so, those downhills, while also MUCH safer, are putting range back in the tank!"
"I was going to say that this is an ideal scenario for the I-80 corridor. There is a supercharger in Truckee already I think. Also, electric motors aren’t affected by the low air density up there at 7,000 feet, so they should be humming up the grade nicely. If the regenerative braking in the trucks is as nice as the model 3 then it seems like it would reduce the risk of runaway trucks as well. Plus going downhill the battery would be charging the entire time. I bet truck drivers would love to drive this route in an electric semi."
"Yeah, especially for the seemingly 5 months a year its dumping snow on the pass."
Donner is one of their easier Sierra grades. I'd love to see that go over Sonora.
Don’t give them ideas..
Nice. It's shocking a) how easy it is to turn everything into a negative and b) how often it's going on in the real press once you see it.
Built an electric car in college and I tried to estimate the range with equations and I should have just built a program that took in different real world variables because I was way off. The car outperformed in every category. Literally every one...
"Its all internet talk. People putting on an image. He won't quit his job.

Stupid people are everywhere. Leave them to entertain themselves."
They're so conflicted they don't know what they want anymore.  Tesla is the most American-made car in existence.  You'd think those hicks would be into that.
"I personally think it’s an issue with our society being so conditioned into thinking loud roaring engines are the manliest, sexiest, most powerful things in the world. On top of the general biased media making people think that nuclear plants for the power are far worse than “clean coal” and other fossil fuels. Also a bit of fear possibly. Fear of the unknown or of something they don’t understand. And if it is scary it must be bad."
"He can quit his job, the truck will just haul the damn trailer itself"
Many people are iQ-free these days.
[deleted]
"There’s literally no reason to quit. The truck beats diesel trucks in every aspect. That should do nothing but appease truckers, especially when they don’t have to chug along at 25 mph up a mountain here in PA. 

He is just upset that electric beat diesel and wants to act big and tough over it. There really isn’t many downsides to this aside from maybe the range of your doing cross country."
"There is a huge mindset like this in my area. It isn't the thing a man drives. These are the same people who have issues with automatics, a real man shifts!"
"And if they chose to bow to his threat a new company will start up with lower costs if they are better.

Seriously, economics always wins."
They aren’t worried about the literal vehicle they’re worried about auto pilot. AKA their jobs.
"Many truckers have literally nothing to do while driving except listen to Sean Hannity, AM radio religion/politics and talk with each other on the radio.

Do this for 20+ years and you get idiots like these"
"Came here to say this, 75k gross not payload but industrial standard for flatbed truck and trailer combo is 32,000 to haul a max payload of 48,000."
Do we know the range of this semi?
I really hope that 85K number is accurate so your math works out. That would be awesome!
"> 4,690 Lbs

https://www.ultrablock.com/assets/pdf/ultrablock-brochure.pdf

4320 lbs

-----

4,320*9=38,880 lbs (~17,635 kg) load

75,000-38,880=36,120 lbs (~16,384 kg) Truck"
"based on battery densities your numbers can't be right. normal trucks can carry 15 of these blocks.

a truck and empty trailer also don't weight 40k. you can get tractors in the 11k to 17k weight range and a trailer isn't making up the rest.

where are you getting these numbers? even you ultrablocks are off by 300 or so.

based on battery tech the battery for these should weight 12k to 15k pounds which alone weights as much as a current tractor.

add in the motors, frame and body and the tesla semi will come in much heavier."
[deleted]
How could that be possible? Is the electric motor that much lighter?
Blocks usually weigh between 3500 to 4200 pounds
I think the prototypes have a carbon fiber shell because it's easier to make prototypes that way than from steel. I wonder if they can meet weight targets with steel or aluminum panels or costs with carbon fiber panels?
"This is a flatbed, which is going to be significantly lighter than a full box"
"To be fair it’s probably just a fan of the company excited to see their product succeed. If you don’t know anything about driving truck, they mean the same thing."
"I think they're waiting to get battery production up. I think musk said before that they only have enough batteries for the current production, so spending a lot of money setting up a new line just to reduce Mod3 production makes little sense. I don't know how close they are to higher battery production, though"
"That is 75,000 including the weight of the truck and trailer.  That load is 40,000 tops"
"Dry vans can only carry a maximum of approximately 45,000#. This is representative of how that type of weight would actually be hauled."
"That's not necessarily true. The fairing on the top of the truck is to cause air to flow over the trailer. By having a hard end at the fairing and no trailer filling in the space behind it, a massive low pressure zone right behind the truck where it causes the most drag possible.

Having a trailer seriously helps this problem, especially when those trailers have the trailing fairings that fold out."
[deleted]
"Mucho wrongo. Flatbed is always awful aerodynamically, and dry van is always most aerodynamic because it has a much more uniform shape. Source: am truck driver, with years of experience."
"then you need a sled to pull them in and out, it's a PITA, so this way you can fork lift them right onto the trailer from the side. This is similar to how they would haul massive metal reams or large equipment."
This is probably not the only testbed configuration they are running. I'm pretty sure all the relevant variations will be tested and documented.
When you break bridges
"A 'standard' truck is 40/40/40. 40,000 Lbs cab and empty trailer; 40,000 Lbs. hauled load; on a 40 Ft. long trailer. But a 190,000 Lbs. bridge girder can be hauled down any regular highway if it is about 170 Ft. long and enough axles and wheels are put under each end to spread out the load on the road surface. Some engineering there."
Road damage is proportional to (axle weight)^4 . So... quickly.
"80 thousand pounds. After that, you start needing specialty equipment"
Minimum 6
Really really long. But the cost efficiency drops to 0 ;)
It would be a fun experiment. It may be possible to cross the country non-stop with a sleeper cab and 2-3 drivers.
"they make container sized batteries now.

https://youtu.be/kMkTbXlc8ec"
"As other posters said, the load is about 40,000 pounds. That's about 18,000 kg. Model 3 battery density is about 200kwh/kg. That would be about 3.6Mwh of energy. 

I don't know the watts per mile efficiency of the semi, but let's say 500w/mile... Or about 7200 miles. That's maybe a round trip across the country?"
Now I wanna see an unladen Tesla Semi on a drag strip.
"It's not when the Roadster 2 will come out that people will realize how superior EV are, it's when the Semi will smoke a Ferrari! That day, the ICE supercar market will crater"
"Lower haulable weight or not, it will still be more economical to operate vs an ICE semi"
"This is a valid observation.  On the other hand, how much weight is normal for a semi to actually drive around with?  Are they all, always at max capacity?  Doubtful.  If a lot of them drive around half-empty, these would work just fine, no?"
Probably close to 500kWh - 1MWh. Long range is estimated at 500 miles.
"Tesla themselves have not issued an official statement on battery size, but most third-party estimates put the size of the pack at ~1MWh +/- some.

EDIT: ""mWh"" corrected to ""MWh"" as per u/xxpor below."
And charging is at 1000kw
"No need to wonder, they revealed this information months ago."
"As long as the truck is hauling over a mountain pass and down the other side it shouldn't matter much. Regen is about 80% efficient so if it takes 30 miles to go over a pass and down the other side then you'd probably use around 36 miles of rated range. In actuality it's more than that because the motors will be less efficient at the very high power outputs required to climb the grade.

It might take 100 miles of rated range to climb 15 miles, but then you will regen 60 miles going back down.

A diesel truck will get 2-3mpg climbing these mountains and get zero back on the way down."
"Depending on how good the regen is, a lot of that will be returned on the trip down."
In that video they were not regenerating as much as they should on the way down because I believe the trailer brakes were doing some of the work.
I don't understand how this translates to the semi in any way at all.
"I belive the level 3 chargers are rated at 1,000 miles an hour so about 500 miles in that 30 min break"
Think smaller like Amazon intra shipping. Amazon shuffles several hundred trucks from warehouse to warehouse every day. An application like Tesla’s would be more suitable as there’ll be a guaranteed space to dock and re charge. Long Haul will more likely remain diesel until the infrastructure is laid out across the country to have a guaranteed space to park and recharge.
"Electronic GPS logbooks are really changing the hours long haul truckers do.

a lot of logistics companies are basing routes on 8 hour shifts these days to avoid the risk of the truck turning off before it reaches a logistics yard.

a delay from an accident or construction can leave a load stranded."
Investors are stupid
I can’t tell if this is a joke or not. 🤔😂
"~300 for the short-range version and ~500 for the long-range one.

The 300-mile truck can capture more than 50% of the market and the 500-mile truck that can capture almost 70% of the market.

If you add 1-2 stops the 500-mile truck can capture 70%-80% of the market."
"300 or 500 mile options (assuming full load), but Elon has hinted they may do better than that"
Unguarded semi truck undercarriages seem to be the leading cause of deadly Tesla accidents so hopefully they give side guards high priority on theirs
"At $150,000, I would buy a pickup truck instead, for half the price.  And yes, nearly all of the trucks owned are owned by civilians.  Owner/operator or small business are the most common in the US."
"You forgot to account for the weight of the trailer itself.  I get your point, however.  What does a regular semi weigh, with full fuel tanks?"
"Trailer weights about 11,600lbs.  So Tesla Semi is about 24,500lbs."
"It would be advantageous for a company to own many, that way they can build their own charging infastructure on their current transportation network (imagine dedicated multi megawatt fast chargers that are too expensive too put on the side of the road but cost effective when at a port for cargo) and make a easier transition then smaller more independent businesses."
total vehicle weight
5000kg of batteries?
That is the idea (charge while waiting anyway).  The long range is 600 miles and is claimed be be able to charge from 20% - 80% (500 miles of range) in 30 minutes.
Yes.
I guess it's more time efficient to charge them during loading. So you just have to wire chargers into truck loading bays :)
"Absolutely. There is no way commercial trucks will be using Superchargers. Anyway, a V3 Supercharger would take 4 hours at maximum speed to fill the batter."
"Yes. Tesla has sometimes referred to them as Megachargers. For now, they have been using multiple superchargers while piling up the miles testing them. There are pictures around the internet of folks seeing them at rural stations."
"Because the federal government statistics from weigh stations says the avg semi is loaded to 73,000 lbs, rare are those loaded to the absolute max."
Because current trucks are somewhat beautiful to look at?
there are 2 versions. 1 with a sleeper and this one
YangGang
Purely a marketing stunt that gives no indication of real-world towing capability.
"I don't think the point of the 75,000 lbs was to maximize the load that the truck can pull. It's just a test weight for verifying the specifications of the truck. I'm sure the tesla could also pull 200 metric tons. The question is how does the range and efficiency compare between the Volvo and the Telsa while pulling the same weight."
Tesla's Semi carries the top load allowed legally.
ROFL...read up on hydrogen fuel cells and u will see why hydrogen is a horrible source of alternative energy and way more expensive than electric. Electric batteries will still be a better option than hydrogen.
"Actually an advantage of the electric motor is the torque output, it can go up a 15 degree grade at 65mph while other trucks will only push out 50mph, so you get less elephant racing."
This wasn't a demonstration. They're conducting road tests.
"I see a LOT of these kinds of loads being pulled on the roads today.  Not the majority, but not inconsequential, either.  I tend to doubt the ""50x surface area"" will make a big difference, since 95% of that is parallel to the apparent wind."
Tech is there already
">Lol probably not the future. Just saying. Nothing will beat a good ole gas engine

Unless you're trying to pull something. Then a good ol' diesel engine will out perform it."
"Not sure if you are trolling or not, but what exactly looks like shit about these? https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Tesla_Semi_5.jpg/1024px-Tesla_Semi_5.jpg  

Looks a hell of a lot better than the American conventional cab tractors."
"If you want to sacrifice aerodynamics, slap a big old square hood on it. Can't imagine why I'd care though. Art deco trains were gorgeous, but practically wins in the end."

That's a pretty good mix of enthusiasm and skepticism — well above average compared to a typical facebook post. Color me impressed.
"I like the comment complaining that it wouldn't be able to pull 65,000 lbs of cattle in Montana or Wyoming. As if this test wasn't with 10,000 lbs more weight and the acting like the fact that it was cattle would make a difference."
Wow. There's some ignorant people there.
"Actually after scrolling down the comments a little farther, it is definitely mostly negative.  But not as much as I'd imagine.  Lot of naysayers.

EDIT: Actually i'm still plowing through the comments because its incredibly interesting to peek into their world.  The comments are actually overwhelmingly negative.  Somehow the positive ones floated to the top."
I love the one that says the mining for the lithium battery has produced a larger footprint than a diesel for 20 years. Which that report he's mentioning was found out be false back in 2012.
"Sigh, this just made me lose brain cells **and** faith in humanity.  I'm now more afraid of juries and voters than I've ever been before."
"Lol those complaints are ridiculous.

""The battery will die eventually! Then it's cheaper to just buy a new truck than replace the battery!""

As if an ICE semi lasts forever and never has any engine issues at all. But please, tell me how buying a new car cause the battery is broken is different from buying a new car because the transmission broke, other than you being scared of technology"
"I’ll admit, there are more positive/optimistic comments there than I expected."
wow. this is why I deleted my facebook account years ago.
"LoL, let's automate their jobs .. we can do it .. we have the technology."
I'm surprised there's still a comment about battery life. I presumed that myth has been completely killed ages ago. No one asks me that one any more.
The comment about climate effect is real. I'd say range is halved in the winter but that mostly due to cabin control in a Model 3 with windows everywhere.
"Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half"

"Most states are 105,500.  It’s more about a per tire weight though."
The chargers for these are supposed to take 30mins.
"You didn't drive no damn 714 miles on a 65 limited truck; stop lying to these people... Your average speed would have to be 64.91 mph and that's driving exactly 11 hours to the second. That means you hit no traffic, missed every weigh station, zero construction, took no off ramps or on ramps and didn't hit a single uphill grade and managed to drive through some cities where the speed limit never dipped below 65. What route was this on where you managed this extraordinary feat?"
"It's pretty much all gatekeeping. If your semi truck doesn't have a 6 foot long front hood and chrome on 75% of its body, then truckers believe it can't pull a twig."
The only negative I've heard that's reasonable is the weight issue. Putting the batteries on the bottom like a car means you loose that much weight in the load. They could have just put a giant battery block right where the engine would have been then there would be no issues with the weight and it would feel like a regular truck feels to drive.
"Truckers have the most fragile masculinity I have ever seen, I mean just look at trucking memes. You can literally feel the paper thin masculinity giving you paper cuts"
Same here my friend. Exact same crap going on here....
"The whole ""real men"" and visions about ""masculinity"" is already dumb in on itself (due to the fact that it's comparing dick sizes above all other arguments), but where it really becomes dumb is when arrogance and ICE loyalty is mixed in, imo.

Personally, I'd feel more giddy and more of a ""real man"" if I have a car that has more capabilities and is more smarter than any other ""normal"" car, function > form."
Definitely looks cool to me!
My philosophy is: if a robot can do your job better than you then perhaps you should find a job that makes a better utilization of your brain...
"It's much cheaper than oil. Just watch the ""Tesla Semi unveil"" video, there you get all the infos about the truck."
"Been looking for somebody to say this. Blocks are 5,600 lb usually, there's clearly ten blocks on the trailer."
and so much quieter
I wonder whether or it’s harder or not to capture as much energy as a passenger car. Given that the Semi has few driven wheels (and that the trailer will need to do some of the braking) whereas almost all (or all for AWD models) of the needed braking force is on driven wheels for a passenger car.
Great point!

">Also, electric motors aren’t affected by the low air density up there at 7,000 feet

Yes, but as the air thins, cooling gets less efficient. Still better than ICE though."

"At the unveiling, Musk said 500 mile range."
"4,420 Lbs. is probably closer to the real block weight. I used the value that includes some reinforcing steel and these blocks do not have any reinforcing steel in them. But also the density of concrete varies and these blocks are just made from random excess concrete. And these appear to be UltraBlock but not confirmed.

Many were speculating that the Semi had to be much heavier which reduced its hauling capacity.  The indication is that the truck is comparable in weight or less than a typical truck."
"Your figures are way off.

Even if they use fully assembled, off the shelf, Model 3 packs they won't come anywhere near the 12k-15k pounds you claim, especially for the short range variant."
"It's likely they are using the new Maxwell tech to get denser and cheaper batteries, but we won't know for sure until Tesla's battery day."
"People forget that the batteries replace the Diesel engine and transmission, which offsets a lot of the battery mass. The longe range semi will likely have an 800-1000kwh battery pack. In the model 3, the pack is at 160wh/kg. In the semi, the pack level density will be a lot better since there are a lot more cells per surface area of casement structure. The current 2170 cells themselves are 247wh/kg, so let’s say the semi pack achieves 190wh/kg just through volumetric efficiency. A 1mwh pack would therefore weigh 11,575lbs. Now Tesla is also rumored to be developing next gen cells with a density closer to 350wh/kg. If so, this would suggest a pack level density of about 290wh/kg, reducing the battery weight to around 7,600lbs. It’s not inconceivable that a tractor diesel, transmission, axle, and structural supports for all these would weigh a similar amount, resulting in effectively no weight penalty for the electric version."
"it isn't and the motor isn't the issue it is the batteries and his weight is off for the blocks

normal trucks can carry 15 of these."
"Yup. K-rail barriers are two tons a pop, times five I can see, probably five on the other side. Exactly 40,000#"
What limits the weight of a dry van? The axles or gvcw?
Fluid dynamics is a very weird thing. The highly decreased pressure immediately behind the cab when not towing a trailer has an impact. Putting a trailer with a rounded back will be more efficient than just a cab itself for example. The more of a “teardrop” shape emulated usually the better. The “front surface” area is the same but the flows around and down the backs and sides helps significantly.
"[This semi is the short version](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Tesla_Semi_5.jpg/1024px-Tesla_Semi_5.jpg), without the big aero cover that you would see on most semis that deal with regular sized trailers.

With a regular trailer, and without the aero cover (which I don't think comes with this short range verison), I think it will have a noticeable effect on range."
"[Oversize loads can get pretty damn massive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARqZAaJ46us) (warning, Mack truck ad)"

"Put it up against the guys in [Notre-Dame-du-Nord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wub9qE9UMxo), Quebec, where they run both bobtail and with up to 3 trailers (145K lbs) in drag races. But be ready to keep going at the end of the track, because if you beat them to the line, I guarantee they'll run you out of town... :)"
[deleted]
"Sure. There are light loads. You have to deadhead a ways to get em sometimes. But if you can pull 50k+ then you don't have to deadhead as much, and you can get loads that others can't, and they often pay more than light loads."
"Look at what a lot of the megas are driving, companies like Prime and Swift and Schneider. Freightliner Cascadias which are under 15,900. Thats the cutoff for a ""light"" truck which can pull a full tanker, for instance. They're right up to 80k every load I believe.

Edit light truck is either 15.9 or 16.1, can't remember."
"Well, stats are 2kWh/mile and 500 miles of range, so 1MWh battery is basically the only logical deduction. Given an optimistic 270 Wh/kg, that's 3.7t in cells + probably about another half a ton in other parts (enclosure, inverter, cabling, cooling, electronics etc). That's ~4t in battery weight ONLY. I actually have no clue on the rest of the tractor can possibly weight, but I would be surprised if the whole thing would weight less than 8t, tractor only."
That’s a shit ton of batteries and juice.
"I could see these turning into the perfect disaster relief trucks. Show up with food water, supplies and extra power to get some power on until main power sources are restored."
"MWh, mWh is a milliwatt hour."
Not just getting zero back. If you're engine braking it's worse than coasting.
"As they should, otherwise the trailer might jackknife."
"Well, that sounds great then. Guess we just need the infrastructure in place and everything's all set."
Is this sarcasm?
"No, it's 80,000 lbs combined, so that includes the weight of the vehicle + trailer. That's also incentive for a Class 8 vehicle to be lighter, so you can carry more product.

It's just strange. I'm guessing 75,000 lbs is a typo or just bad information.

They have said in the past they are not going after OTR trucking, more of a severe service day-cab style trucking, so it's possible they won't certify to Class 8 as most customers wouldn't need the capacity? I'm stretching though."
"No, that'd be included in the CVWR. 80k would be total weight of truck/trailer."

"Except that you're talking about a design scenario, so you should test it to the stated capacity.  Otherwise you're lowering your capacity."
"Honestly better than this.

"Oh im sorry i didnt realize the max load capacity was 80,000 pounds 

I wonder if there could be a test platform for a concrete mixer, that would defiantly put it to the test. but it would be interesting to see if if it would still meet its range at loads over 80,000 pounds."
Unless noise is a concern. Then nothing beats a good ol' steam engine.
Left one: Nice. Right one: Not so nice.
"Couple of things:  
**COLD** - This will impact an EV Semi less than it would our regular cars. Meaning that since the battery is so big already in a Semi, the cold won't impact range as much as our passenger cars since the battery is so big (for the semi) relative to the heat it needs to produce to warm up the cabin/battery. Yes the battery has less capacity in the cold but its recoverable once you warm it up. Those ion's don't disappear just because its cold (its just harder to pull out).

**Lithium mining** is no where near as bad as the other heavy metals and oil. A lot of lithium as it is today is still [mostly on the surface](https://blog.grabcad.com/blog/2018/02/20/how-does-lithium-mining-work/) so we don't need to strip mine for lithium like you would for coal and other resources.
  
**Power** - People questioning the ability to haul 60,000+ lbs? LoL, have you been in a Tesla?"
Just wait till the trucks start driving themselves. The enthusiasm is definitely going to shift gears into vitriol.
Most of the negative comments are just uneducated and uninformed.
It's California :)
But .. the laws of physics .. Daimler Benz are the gatekeepers.
"The thing that actually got me to quit fb was when NASA announced those 7 planets they found in the goldilock zone of other solar systems. People legitimately thought they were going to be leaving on a ship in the next few years. I was on the edge of deleting my account, but reading all those comments pushed me over the side."
"The comment about the cold weather, am I wrong in assuming if you're using the battery it will heat itself to a decent temperature and not be that significantly reduced? The main problem is usually overnight when the battery gets cold right?

Since trucks are driving so long won't it not matter that much?"
"What’s heavier? 65,000lbs of Cattle or 65,000lbs of Concrete?"
"Pretty sure they were insinuating the elevation changes, if not elevation in general.  

That said, unless its totally uphill the regen will help massively on downhill segments, and unlike an ICE, altitude and less oxygen doesn't matter to a BEV."
Didn't you know?  Cow methane partially fuels those ICE semis.
This is what happens when people have no idea how electric motors work
"In all fairness, the aerodynamics of a cattle trailer may be vastly different than the flatbed pictured."
"I think the total weight was 75k with trailer, truck, and cargo."
You didn’t know that Wyoming magically makes EVs unusable?
Because of upvotes.  Silent majority.
"There is one world that an EV truck will have issues with. Far North Oilfield work. Which is kinda perverse...

Not saying they can't do it, but until the infrastructure and support is in place, a lot of those guys just *won't* risk it. Not to say the ICE stuff doesn't struggle with the issues as well, but those issues are known, and there are last ditch solutions available. Even so, I believe there are some trucks forever stuck out in the wilds. Thinking about it, probably easier in the long run to do an in situ repair and recovery for an EV. e.g. fly in a towable battery replacement? But that's the sort of thing it will take to get them to take a chance on it."
"If that’s true, that’s awful for the batteries. It’s probably 30 minutes to go from a low percentage to 60-80 percent."
"75 south of Atlanta to the Florida turnpike to Fort Pierce, got wildly lucky that day. We have Sunpass, so I got to roll all the toll plazas through the fast lane, and our company has a good CSA record, so we get green lights at the weigh stations a ton. That day was basically a miracle."

I like tesla and elon musk :)"
"Why does it matter if the batteries are on the bottom or in front? Putting them in front would have prevented it from having such an aerodynamic shape.

Why make it feel like a regular truck when it can be better?"
"Close, I believe the issue is that trucks (the entire thing with cargo) are Federally limited to something like 37,000 pounds. Since batteries still weight a lot compared to the ICE parts, this removes a hundred/thousand pounds of cargo you can carry (not sure exactly how much heavier they are, but this is considered a big barrier).

The weight is also why electric airplanes are considered impossible by some."
">then perhaps you should find a job

That's a pretty privileged perspective. Not everyone can just get a job in an instant, especially when jobs are being automated away"
"So, inference is the tractor unit is under 20,000 pounds? Assuming 1,000 for the trailer."
Now what's going to help me wake up on those long road trips without the deafening blast of air brakes?
"It has four Model 3 motors. Those can each regen at 60kW so the truck should be able to regen at about 240kW...without doing calculations, I believe that should be plenty to hold back a fully loaded truck on a downgrade."
Conventional engine brakes are also only on the drive wheels.

"Cooling for what?  The motors and packs don't need much cooling, and if it did, they have stack plates from the air conditioning into the coolant loop for active cooling regardless of external air density and temps."

3 years is a long time. 3 years ago Tesla was just a small luxury automaker with a pretty nice electric sedan and big dreams.
Haven't they upped it to 600 miles?
I guess your and my numbers provide and upper and lower bound range for the capabilities of the truck
that Maxwell tech isn't at that point.
"I wonder if they might use the battery swapping tech to get fast turn arounds ok the trucks. This would increase the upfront cost of buying more batteries, but would eliminate having to wait to charge on longer trips. Just put a solar array out somewhere in the middle and have the trucks trade the full pack."
"Where are you accounting for the weight of the electric motors (each of which will have their power electronics and gearbox), but weight of the electrical cables.  I would also assume the battery cooling is larger (but that likely scales relative to the pack).

I'm not saying you are wrong in concept, it's just an EV is more than a battery pack."
I don’t even see 9 blocks on that semi either.
"This is in Cali and the gross weight can't be over 80,000. Most truck and dry van combinations weigh around 34,000 35,000, so you can only load up on around 45k"
"So in theory, this setup would have worse range than if there was a full-sized box trailer. Therefore, we can assume that, due to box trailers having a max capacity of 45,000lbs and better slipstreams, that a tesla truck with a fully loaded box trailer would still be out-performing expectations."
"Woah now, didn’t you hear? Tesla is going bankrupt they can’t afford to put that much battery in their cars, 7 range is obviously crazy talk..."
I believe Tesla claims a mere 5 seconds unloaded and 20 seconds at full load (which in my opinion is actually more impressive).
I don't know that
"You really think that 1 MWh of battery and three Model 3 motors can set the 0-60 at 5 seconds? heh heh

(hopefully)"
2kWh/mile is the upper limit so probably around 800 kWh.
"Your weights are way, way off. An EV truck is way lighter than you're estimating.

Basically the weight of batteries, motors, and electronics is equal to the weight of everything being removed to support the ICE. Just the weight of the fuel in a single 250 gallon tank is almost 1800lbs."

Thanks! Updated.
"Objectively wrong. The engine will still be injecting the required fuel for idle, but the pumping losses of additional air compression and the inertial mass of the rotating assembly act as drag mechanisms to slow the vehicle with no additional efficiency loss. Engine braking is not at all worse than coasting."
"Yeah, they're definitely not pulling any trucks into the superchargers I've seen so far..."
"It might be because they know most trucks dont maximize their wheight to 80,000lbs exactly."
lol
You thought wrong. Solar panels are great but you would need to tow a mile long trailer to charge this thing.
"Nothing has said they are not going to or have not done this.  These have been on the road for over a year now testing.  It is not unintelligent to start lower for testing, then increase weight as you further the testing.

These pictures don’t do it justice.
"Tesla's tech is there, it's just that no one caught up to them yet"

"The carbon footprint of the manufacturing is EASILY offset by the carbon emissions it's NOT putting into the air 12 hours per day, every day, for years."
"Also fully loaded trucks are SLOW

This is also something that electrode material doping helps with. So the Maxwell DBE process may well provide benefits in cold weather.
"[This interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53hlxbCWo9s&t=3m53s) (turn on english subtitles) seems to confirm your first point. It is with a guy from Stena Recycling, a Norwegian company that uses electric prime movers, and he says they notice zero range drop in the winter."
"There are some downsides, mainly that the battery weighs a lot but its efficiency as an EV makes up for that from an environmental standpoint and as the technology progresses it will be economical too."
Plus the truck will drive way longer routes than any passenger car does regularly. When I arrive at the office my battery has warmed up to a more efficient temperature. For me the ride ends there but not for a truck hauling goods. If it would the range would be nothing to talk about.
"Lithium is normally collected as a salt from a brine solution, its a lot cleaner than mining literally anything else.

Whats really funny is the modified Subaru forester that was shown at one of the auto shows.  550 hp and 6,700 ft-lbs of torque, or about 5x as much as any class 8 truck."
"I'm personally questioning range and charging time since batteries still have very low energy density. I know electric motors are extremely efficient. Still, we need at least faster charging batteries. Higher range wouldn't be a bad thing either. Another thing is that these trucks will need charging infrastructure. I mean for them to complete certain routes they most likely will need to be charged with the load attached, that complicates things. Doesn't make implementation impossible, just more complex."
Thanks fpr clearing up that cold myth. I was always wondering about it.
"These tropes are such obvious bullshit if anyone spent a two minutes thinking about it instead of just repeating what they hear on talk radio. 

The lithium carbon footprint: let's say the ultimate battery lifetime is 300k miles, conservative. For a normal truck getting 8 mpg, that's **37500 gallons** of fuel to mine the lithium. In what world could that ever be feasible or even approach  profitable??

Another is that manufacturing windmills somehow releases more carbon than it will ever make up for in operation. Windmills make money by selling energy, if they can't even repay the energy debt (not to mention labor and material), how the fuck do windmills exist in anything remotely resembling capitalism? It's utter fucking drooling stupidity."
"So... with regard to cold, Tesla battery packs already have a liquid coolant system inside. I assume that could be / is used to keep batteries warmer in cold climates."
"Lithium mining can have a near zero impact on the environment. We are getting an Li mine here in Arkansas that will use an existing brine mining facility's waste stream as a source of Li for mining. So basically no additional waste is created.

https://investorintel.com/sectors/technology-metals/technology-metals-intel/standard-lithium-is-poised-for-success-in-arkansas/"
Other heavy metals? Lithium is literally the lightest metal that exists.
"If extreme cold is an issue, I would think insulating around the pack wouldn't be that big a design issue either given how large the Semi already is (and unlikely to cause problems cooling, as it already has an extensive cooling system).  \[But as you said, a large battery pack likely retains significant heat as it is / pre-warming the battery when the truck is plugged in also seems like a reasonable mitigation\]"
"> cold won't impact range

There are some EV trucks in... Norway or Sweden? The drivers claim zero effect on range due to cold."
"I think there's a vaguely reasonable argument that could be made that oil infrastructure is already in place, the damage is already done.  Whereas lithium mining is just starting to expand, so it's going to cause new areas of the earth to be impacted by industry.

But I definitely think it's a case of the ends justifying the means.  We have to stop using oil, so the transition is necessary.  Hopefully batteries end up being conducive to recycling, and that would help minimize the long term needs for battery-related mining."

There will likely be less risk of runaway trucks too. Can't burn up your brakes if you're not using them.

"But the *weight* of the cattle trailer + cattle will be the same.

The acceleration performance of this badass will not suffer due to these reduced aerodynamics.

"Regarding that last comment, I got to do a report on how electric cars compare to ICE for a chemistry class. 

Basically, all else being equal (I used the Ford Focus 4-cyl and the Ford Focus Electric for this comparison), an electric car will produce roughly a third of the emissions that an ICE will. 

That includes the emissions generated at the plant that goes into your batteries.

So, the whole “the electricity still has to come from somewhere” zinger is garbage, they’re just recycling what they hear without bothering to verify."

It doesn't help going all electric if we still produce most of electricity through burning coal.

Going electric is obviously the right step, but addressing electricity production is way more important."
"Aerodynamics are a major consideration but not the only one of course. What's the point of getting better mileage if you can't pick up the same loads? Also, having some weight on the steering axle is good for steering."
"Our total weight is 80,000 lbs. The thing is they also have weight limits by axle. With the batteries on the bottom they weight of the batteries is probably equally distributed between the steering and drive axle. If it was just a big block in the front, it would put the weight mostly on the steering axle exactly like the engine is now. Then we could still get the same loads we're currently getting and the batteries would just cancel what the weight of the engine would have been."
"I guess it is, you're right. 
But it's also inevitable, repetitive tasks will all be done by robots and it's really for the best in the long run.

In countries where they have the most competent politicians they already have a guaranteed minimum income to get them trough this transition. If you/we do not have such a system then it's really the fault of the voters."
"It's not air brakes you're hearing on trucks descending a grade, it's the exhaust brake (aka Jake brake, engine brake, compression release brake)

I’m not talking about the capacity of the motors but rather the placement. If there isn’t any regen capability on the trailer I imagine that would result in traditional brakes having to be used.
"Each motor should be able to regen at the same amount of power they can produce.  I would imagine Model 3’s regen limit is based on what the battery can handle, not the motors."
So the same amount of braking in a model3?
Conventional engine brakes don’t do all of the braking on a conventional semi.
"It’s not the capacity I’m worried about, but rather the placement. To brake the rear axles on the trailer (where there aren’t motors) results in wasted energy."
Cooling for the batteries and motor? Probably not a big deal in the 3 but the original Roadster and the S have cooling issues under heavy loads. I have a friend with the Roadster and he had to have Tesla install a custom double cooling fan after his car getting stuck in limp mode going up Pike's Peak.
"2016 was 400,000 pre order deposits."

Close to 600.
"That’s what the mega chargers are for. Idea is that it takes a while for the truck to be loaded/unloaded anyways, so as long as you can charge it up in about 30min there won’t be any lost time. Ultimately this is cheaper than battery swaps, since swaps require you to have much more redundancy in terms of batteries, where as the mega chargers will need just one megapack to buffer charge for a large fleet of vehicles."
"I would hope they are testing for worse case here. Maybe they'll add a large, very un-aerodynamic shape to it to see how it handles that. Maybe at that point it's just a few miles difference."
"Not the case. The biggest factor is the area of the trailing section where the vortex is being created.  So the trailer would be worse than the concrete blocks because the area on the trailing edge is a lot larger than the concrete blocks.

The idea of reducing the area of the trailing edge can be seen with the popularity of the [trailer boat tails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_tail). This has two effects, not letting the air separate from the surface and guiding it together a bit better (the angle) and also creates a smaller trailing area after the airflow has separated from the surface. 

[This image](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f5827a37b147219497a6f08f0bbb3352-c) gives an idea of how important the trailing edge is there's a lot of pressure buildup (requiring power to create) in the front but a lot of drag is caused by the low pressure in the back where the swirling occurs."
"Agreed. It weighs well well over 2 tons.   Maybe over 3.

Edit:  apparently i was way off.  So 10’tons."
"From the book ""Hayes and Goodarzi"" it is 1200kwh."
"how are is weights off? battery density and weight is a know thing and they are heavy.

also no it isn't the battery weights more than those components.

show your math like he did"
"Most do though. Most fleet companies won't send a truck out unless it's fully loaded. The cost to haul 70k vs 80k is pretty close, but the profits for moving an extra 10k worth of product sometimes makes or breaks the job."
"I'm a truck driver, I burn through 400- 550 liters of fuel *every day* that I work."
Don’t forget the pollution to get the fuel and transport it vs providing energy for a truck. Something simple as that is easily missed by the uneducated bitching about EVs.

"I worked for a company that made battery separators for a few big name car batteries. You would not believe the damage and waste that comes from the separator step alone. Carcinogenic chemicals accidentally released into the environment, hot extrudate that is similar to burnt tires and is unusable, shredded plastic that is chopped to look like confetti and then taken to the dump. Etc.  I can only imagine what happens at the battery manufacturer with lead/acid etc.  I won’t name the company, but when I first started they were really proud as they supposedly had a carbon footprint close to zero on the books. Not in real life. I’m waiting for someone in the oil and gas industry to make me an offer for my dirt lol"
"Fully loaded Tesla semi accelerated like it wasn't even loaded at all. It was amazing to see, and he was going up an interstate onramp too."
And that matters because.....?
Model 3 weight is the same as BMW 3 series.
"battery weight is countered by the removal of semi engine, transmission, etc. 

The Tesla semi should be able to handle similar amount of freight as diesel semi. Also the battery energy density will continue to improve."
[deleted]
"Electric semi should be able to achieve the same charging speed as electric sedan. If Model 3 can be charged in 30 minutes, so can Tesla semi.

Ultimately the charging time is limited by each individual battery, not by how big the battery pack is."
"Electrics get a huge efficiency gain because of regenerative braking.   Bringing 75,000 lbs uphill takes a lot of energy, but going downhill lets the batteries ""soak up"" some of that energy while keeping the speed down. 

Tesla is alreadly planning a 1 Gigawatt charger specifically for the Semi."
"Most trucks fuel with their loads, Long haul OTR definately do. While not ""simple to do"" It wouldn't be that hard to remove the fuel pump and tankage systems and replace them with the charging infrastructure."
I was mostly thinking if heavy metals used in the production of EV permanent motors used by most other manufacturers.
"> I think there's a vaguely reasonable argument that could be made that oil infrastructure is already in place, the damage is already done. Whereas lithium mining is just starting to expand, so it's going to cause new areas of the earth to be impacted by industry.

oil drilling is constantly expanding and moving. Wells dry all the time. The only infrastructure that is in place and matters at all would be processing plants."
The past 3 weeks I've seen two oil rigs stop drilling and move to another site and a third rig come in and start drilling. Oil infrastructure is always changing. I heard tonight that they're planning on building another drill island next spring.

"Put them both on an actual scale, not a fake one like in the video, and you might be surprised by the result. A kilogram of steel is indeed heavier than a kilogram of feathers.

edit: to the downvoters, ask yourselves what scales actually measure, what role might buoyancy play and look up the difference between weight and mass. 1 kg of steel has the same mass as 1 kg of feathers, but it weighs more because the feathers displace more air, meaning the feathers are more buoyant and will measure less than 1 kg of steel if you put them both on a scale."
"That John Denver was full of shit, man."
"Totally. Donner Pass is slightly over 7k feet up, which is ~300 feet higher than the average elevation of Wyoming, and more than twice as high as Montana. It drove up significant inclines to reach that pass and met or exceeded expectations. Further, at elevation, the Tesla should gain efficiency compared to sea level because there's less air resistance and it doesn't rely on oxygen for combustion. Diesel trucks, on the other hand...

Montana and Wyoming are locations the Tesla should really shine, provided the charging network is sufficient."

"Pretty small, but it is a corner case that will take time to overcome.

"Exactly. A lot of older truck drivers are very set in their ways/ know everything. A lot of them want a old truck that spits out huge clouds of black smoke. I do find it funny in the past it was always ""tree hugging tesla lovers"" but now that the truck is becoming a reality to them, they are worried about the environment all of a sudden. ""Those trucks batteries are terrible for the earth!"""
They are being controlled by relentless propaganda.

"Susceptible to oil marketing, I’d say. Because those ideas don’t just develop organically. They sprout from seeds carefully planted by opinion makers. And that shit works, too. Marketing is very quantitative, they zoom in on a working strategy rather quick."
"Great to hear the relative difference, a good fact to share.

To be fair I don't think the power source concern is ""garbage"", people being aware power plants pollute is a good thing (as we try and build out solar and wind, or conserve) but it's easy to not realize that centralized power generation is a lot more efficient and less polluting than it can be with individual vehicles (especially those that are older and poorly maintained).

The criticism of battery manufacturing (and mining) is absurd though as there's mining and manufacturing impact with regular vehicles, and oil is hard to get to, refine, and transport globally.  

All just education.  This is where Tesla should spend their advertising dollars ... not so much on trying to sell more cars than they can make but with basic awareness (myth busting)"

">It doesn't help going all electric if we still produce most of electricity through burning coal.

"> That's a valid point tho. We currently don't.

It's not a valid point though, because supply is currently, and will continue to, meet demand. If we start using more electricity, you think they're not going to start making more?"
"[Here is your answer](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf). This is why I have a problem with talking points that sound right on the surface level.

Yes. They do. We've known this for years."
All jobs will be automated away eventually. We will be a country of serfs.
"Which is basically similar in basic concept as regenerative braking, except instead of exhausting the braking force as compressed air and noise, it puts energy back into the batteries"
Thanks for the correction.
"There are 8 driven tires, so that's 30kW per tire (or 40 hp). That should not be a problem at all. It won't stop the truck and trailer nearly as fast as all wheels having the brakes applied, but that's not the point. Regen (or a jake brake on a diesel truck) are just used to regulate speed and reduce wear on the regular brakes. They don't have to be able to stop it on a dime."
Did I say they did? Do electric cars only use regen? Of course not.
I'm sure the tractor alone can produce more than enough regen braking. No trailer braking required.
You're right not nearly as big an issue with the 3.  Semi uses same motor and cells as the 3 and they are much better designed now from a thermal management perspective.
That’s what I was saying.
Try 10 tons for the truck alone.
That's a huge understatement; tractors alone can hit 10 tons
A fully spec’d model 3 weighs 2 tons! A truck is much heavier!
"0ar 247 Wh/kg a 1MW pack would have 8900lbs of cells presuming no chemistry improvements. The weight of a Mack Pinnacle 2048T is 13k lbs dry weight. Then you add weight of fuel, lubricants, coolants, etc. and you're up at nearly 6000 lbs just for the ICE motor and everything needed to support it.

At 6000lbs you could have a 672kWh pack and add nothing at all to the weight. And like I said, the pack is likely to be 500kWh+. Right now we know the charge adapter is 4x supercharger connectors which means they've probably been experimenting with 4x 100kWh packs from a model s/x. Once they build actual packs for these trucks and use the megacharger, they'll absolutely see pack size and capacity improvements.

I've already done this math. It's pretty basic stuff, and it always works out in favor of the battery truck."
"Most do? For what companies? These truck would be optimal in retail and commercial delivery of volumetric products so I guess you will see Walmart using the trucks in their distribution networks, but not by a logging or steel company."

"Honestly, I'd be happy to see that dirt come to light so battery makers could be held accountable if necessary.  The goal isn't to replace one shitty tech with another.

"Well electric motors have near instant peak torque numbers that are maintained unlike most petrol engines. Why do you think trains use electric motors? (With diesel generators, ymmv). Now if they can just work out fast recharge or battery swaps."

Reduced traffic. Anytime a semi has to slow down  or stop it takes ages to get back up to speed. An electric semi wouldn’t take as long and wouldn’t be crawling up steep grades at 40mph.

"I have no interest in owning a truck, but I am really interested to see the Rivan once it hits the market. I hope it does extremely well."
"That’s a really good point about the “garbage” concern. It’s definitely important to note that electric cars aren’t really zero emissions like they claim (Nissan Leaf has a Zero Emissions badge on the back I think) but they sure are better than ICE. 

I guess my angle was that these people use the “well the energy has to come from somewhere” argument to imply that, at the end of the day, electric still sucks just as much as ICE and it’s not worth driving an electric car, which isn’t the case. 

As this post has pointed out, there is a stigma around electric cars that a lot of old fashioned people love to perpetuate. And the “the energy has to come from somewhere” argument is just a feeble attempt at trying to knock electric cars down a peg. 

So yeah, it’s definitely worth pointing out and understanding, but the electric car still trounces ICE when it comes to saving the environment"
"> a coal plant producing electricity is better than […] cars burning gas

Yeah, I guess you are right, efficiency of a coal plant is probably way higher.    
But another question is, if the emissions of the production of electric cars compared to normal cars plays any significant role or if it's neglectable.

> if people didn't fight it so hard

exactly thats the problem."
"No no, total electricity supply will of course not be a (major) problem, you are absolutely right.    
What I meant is the challenge of producing that new electricity demand ""clean"", and not through coal again."

"Again, we are talking placement, not quantity. During deceleration, it’s safer to brake the rear of the truck to keep the trailer straight and stable."
"Feel free to re-read *MY* comment that *YOU* commented on. Not using regen on a vehicle that has batteries to store the energy and electric motors to use that stored energy means that energy is being wasted. Considering 18 wheelers use something like 20x the energy/year of the average car, it's important that as much of this energy as possible is recaptured."
"So do the front brakes on a car, yet you still use the rears because it’s safer and keeps from upsetting the weight distribution of the vehicle."
"It looks like you are doing the math with incorrect numbers or leaving a lot of numbers out. If I use the incorrect data I can make anything work.

Why are you using 247 Wh/kg? Cell level density doesn't translate directly to pack density. Why are you ignoring the pack weight as well? You are leaving A LOT of data out to make this work.

The model 3 appears to come in at 159.5 Wh/kg so why not use that number?

>Right now we know the charge adapter is 4x supercharger connectors which means they've probably been experimenting with 4x 100kWh packs from a model s/x.

Ok so you think they are using model S battery backs which are heavier than the model 3. Why are you using the wrong cell density? The model S is around 126.7 Wh/kg. It certainly isn't close to yours.

A MASSIVE difference between that and your assumed number.

>The weight of a Mack Pinnacle 2048T is 13k lbs dry weight. Then you add weight of fuel, lubricants, coolants, etc. and you're up at nearly 6000 lbs just for the ICE motor and everything needed to support it.

Great 6,000 lbs is still a lot lighter than 11,000 lbs which is a generous minimum weight for the batteries _you_ think that the Tesla uses.

>I've already done this math. It's pretty basic stuff, and it always works out in favor of the battery truck.

It doesn't though. Not with _real_ numbers. lets see the numbers then using _actual_ real numbers not numbers that have been juked. 

Even with this generous source below the minimum weight for the pack alone is 11k lbs

"Well, with the cost of the transmissions in modern cars, I suspect that number will go up a lot in future. The 7 speed double clutch DSGs, 8,9 and 10 speed automatics needed to eke out decent performance and emissions from primitive ICEs contain thousands of moving parts and cost a fortune."

The separators start as oil and plastic among other things. The extruder would mix the two together through a set of screws and out of a die into a flat continuous sheet. The sheet would then run through extraction where they used a degreasing agent called TCE to remove the oil and ovens to burn off the TCE They used carbon beds, a huge evaporator and a still to recover the TCE. Many times the system would become oversaturated for many different reasons and when it did the evaporator, instead of releasing water vapor, would spew huge amounts of the chemical
in the air. They measured it in tons. That was just one part. The black rubber oil saturated extrudate would fill up a 30 yard dumpster every single night. That’s not including if the product went out of spec and had to be scrapped, or if the sheet would get twisted in the extraction process and be saturated with TCE. All of it went to the landfill on a “I didn’t see that” basis. They had so much scrap product that they filled an entire warehouse and even started buying storage containers because they couldn’t get enough dumpsters on site daily.

"I wonder why semi trucks don't use their diesel engine to run a generator where the transmission is, to power electric motors at the wheels. Seems like it would work better, like trains."
"Not just acceleration, but think of the stopping power. All that kinetic energy doesn’t need to be dumped into (only heat generating) brake rotors and pads when stopping from highway speeds to traffic lights.

Specially when those off ramps are down hill. 
With the electric truck all that energy is going back into the battery!"
"And considering the massive diesel engine, oil, coolant, exhaust, emissions gear, fuel, transmission, etc etc - the weight is also roughly the same as a ICE tractor."
It doesn't really end up with that higher of vehicle weight though. There's a lot of metal in a ICE motor/transmission. Electric motors are tiny.
"for the same weight, battery has less energy. But for gasoline cars, less than 20% of the energy from the gasoline turns into car movement."
"It is, but you can't regenerate gas slowing down or going downhill, so there is a boost in efficiency from that aspect (although I must imagine that's included in parity calculations)"
"https://www.teslarati.com/how-much-tesla-semi-truck-battery-pack-weigh/

About 4k pounds more than a standard tractor estimated.  Could be less with carbon fiber and such."
Citation?  Facts?  Anything?
But it is. It weighs as much as it's counterpart if not a little less depending on how big the fuel tanks are and what not.
in terms of battery percentage.
"So the reason 500 miles is a target range is because that’s how far a driver can go before they need a compulsory break. 

Currently I imagine the driver has to park his ICE vehicle up and then spend five minutes in the weather breathing diesel fumes refuelling, then move the truck to a parking area and walk through the weather to the cashier to pay for the diesel, and then they can go to the cafe to order a coffee or whatever to begin their 30 minute break.

A tesla semi driver parks their semi, spends seconds to plug in the charging cable and heads off to the cafeteria directly.

The 1200 mile range of a diesel truck means refueling every second stop, but unless you have two drivers you are stopping anyway at eight hours.  Tesla semis are not sleeper cabins designed for two driver long haul market."
"It is certainly true that refueling is faster than charging, but in the near future I can see how trucks will be able to charge at their various destinations while loading/unloading. I don't think it would be difficult for me to install a charger at my warehouse and allow trucks to charge for the 20-40 minutes they sit in my loading dock. Electric charging stations can be placed anywhere unlike gas fueling stations. Longer routes will be trickier of course, but I'm confident this problem can be solved relatively easily."
"I'm a truck driver (canadian) in the US I have to take a 30 minute break within 8 hours of starting my day, if I was running long haul across the US this would absolutely not be a problem for me.  Consider this, the max time driving in the US is 11 hours, we need to take off 10 hours at the end of the day. There is a 15 minute pretrip that we do in the morning, and then say 15 minutes to fuel at some point, and a half hour mandatory break (which most of us hate).  So we have 11+.25+.25+.5=12 hours on duty, add to that the 10 off and we are at 22 hours a day accounted for. If were talking coast to coast long haul driving that means that every day we have an extra 2 hours twiddling our thumbs or every day we are waking up 2 hours earlier, which after a few days can really mess up your clock. Long haul truckers in the US are better suited to EV charging times then you think.  It's the regional and local guys who would be most frustrated."
"Some things to consider is that most trips aren't the full battery, they are 200 or 300 miles trips. That means not a full battery is needed, but also, they arrive at the loading docks, offload a trailer, plug in, charge, do paperwork other boring crap, go pee and do the next trailer inspection, then unplug, hook up, then head back to base.

On long haul, the 500 mile range, let's say it's 450 miles, gives you 7.5 hours of driving, just perfect for taking a mandatory break for charging."
Electric semi can save a lot on diesel cost.
"I really don’t see the problem. You plan for it. The reality is: very soon, the only large trucks used on the roads in developed countries will be electric. Let’s get over it, shall we? All the pro-diesel sentiment sounds like pro-horse arguments. Half of them are imaginary problems, the other half are things we’ll have to suck up and freakin’ deal with. Be a man or sumthin’, they say. Lower load capacity is fine, it’s not very often that the truck carries a single item that heavy. And when it does, you can get special overweight permits."

"I calculate the average stop for fuel at 20 minutes minimum. Thats pull in,  2×100gal thanks filled simultaneously, pull up to yellow line, go in for receipt and huge friggin soda and a pisser.

"The vast majority of long-haul shipping does not require door-to-door shipping duration to be minimized. It's important to be on time, that just means they'll begin the journey earlier. If the shipper can save money, most would happily send it on a week long journey. 

The bottom line will be cost. If they can cut out half the cost of diesel, trucking companies will put in depots on the interstate where trucks can swap out trailers if they have to."

"Let's say you don't have enough room to do a multi point turn on a very narrow road. Or a scarier situation... A rockslide, accident, or snowfall has blocked the a tight trail that's next to a cliff. 

You can activate Tank Turning and it will allow the tires on each side to operate independently. The right tires on the right can spin forward while the ones on the left spin backwards. 

You could theoretically spin 360 degrees on a dime with it."
It's like skid-steering except the front wheels can turn as well. To go left the wheels on the left go backward and the wheels on the right go forward. If it's got 4 motors (I think it does) they can even vary the speed differently between the wheels and get rid of the scrubbing effect that skid-steering causes.
"With enough suspension travel anything can. 

I don't think a Rivian will ever make a good rock buggy based on designs, but it could probably navigate most of the Rubicon Trail taking a few of the bypasses in the really crazy stuff. 

The instant torque and individual control for each motor (no need for lockers)  hands down makes it a better starting point for a solid overland and/or offroading vehicle. 

They would give you more power and more control than a Jeep or Toyota ever could."
Would the EVs natural lower center of gravity not also be a benefit for rock crawling?  (Not sure if that works as well when a vehicle has extra suspension for extreme offroading)
"The SUV version looks like something a luxury British company would design and will probably sell a lot of units too. 

Very cool stuff!"
"Definitely more environmental, and thanks for that 1/3 figure to reference, but I expect the more practical aspects of it will actually sell them once people see it for themselves (most people experiences of batteries is their cell phone dying after 1-2 years).  A couple more years of cost drops and it probably won't be a hard sell (although I think people buying new vehicles today that aren't at least hybrids are crazy)"
"> But another question is, if the emissions of the production of electric cars compared to normal cars plays any significant role or if it's neglectable.

I'm pretty sure less emissions are released through the coal plants than gas cars. The plants can also be upgraded with scrubbers where no one upgrades their cars.

People also aren't taking into consideration that you almost definitely won't be only driving your electric car on coat powered electricity. You can also add solar panels to your home and shift it even more off of coal. 

In my area you can be running off of coal or nuclear depending on what side of the county you are on. So it is easy to assume that a lot of people will be able to charge half the time (work or home) with nuclear and the other half with coal (home or work). 

With an electric car is it not a hard set 'or' unlike with gas cars. You will always be running off of gas with a gas car, but with an electric it could come from many sources."
"No both the efficiencies are roughly 30%... But because the production and transport of the gas needs more energy it is more efficient in the end.

But even if, electric cars keep smoke particles out of cities.

"Regen braking is the equivalent of engine braking (aka 'Jake brake') on diesel semi trucks. The engine brake only acts on the drive wheels, and it works fine for the purpose."
I imagine they already try to use engine braking as much as they can on trucks and that would only use the drive wheels. They wouldn't bother with that if it wasn't a significant portion of braking effort.
"Your're missing my point. I'm saying you can use regen at least at the same rate of deceleration as the conventional engine brake, and probably even more. Hell you could even use the steering angle to make the regen variable to accomplish even higher deceleration if they aren't already doing that.

In the end though it totally depends on the ""driver"" how much of the normal brakes are needed, as little as possible is preferred of course."
">Cell level density doesn't translate directly to pack density

That is correct, but as the cell count per pack increases, the ratio of pack weight to cell weight is skewed even further in favor of cells than it already is. What we know _right now_ is that the Model 3 pack weighs 478 kg and has 4416 cells that each weight ~70g. So the cells weigh 309 kg out of 478 kg. That means the pack and electronics weigh 169 kg or about 35% of the total weight. Again, that ratio shrinks as you change the cell count.

BTW, my original calculations included equivalents of the Model 3 pack. But I'm far too lazy to go find that post again. It was in the latest Semi praise thread.

>The model 3 appears to come in at 159.5 Wh/kg so why not use that number?

Because of the reasons I mention above.

>Ok so you think they are using model S battery backs which are heavier than the model 3.

Which part of ""experiment"" didn't make sense here? The _experimental_ packs appeared to be Model S packs. There is zero chance those packs go into actual products. There's zero chance that the current 18650 cells go into the Semi. You _must_ understand the difference between testing and production, right?

>Great 6,000 lbs is still a lot lighter than 11,000

You've lost the plot by a mile here. You saw in my initial reply that I said 500kWh - 1MWh, right? And that the long range is estimated at 500 miles? That greatly favors the 500kWh pack. I figured that would have been obvious, but clearly I need to spell things out in significantly more detail for those in the audience that haven't been following the Semi for 2 years now.

But let's do the math here, shall we? And let's use your preferences. The entire Model S 100D battery pack weights 544kg. That gives us 184 Wh/kg. 500kWh / 184 = 2717.4 kg. Just under 6000 lbs. Including the pack.

So, given that the math _you_ demand I use entirely favors the conclusion I provided above, can we end this now? Diesel engines are absurdly heavy, require tens of liters of lubricant and coolant, lug around hundreds of kilos of fuel, and need hundreds of kilos of transmission and clutch to work. Every single factor here favors EV trucks. Every single one. Weight, serviceability, longevity, simplicity, cost. ICE trucks only serve a purpose right now for long hauls, and the bell has tolled for them as well because of regulations that require a driver rest for several hours between driving shifts. That lines up perfectly with where pack capacities are projected to be in the mid 2020s, even before assuming any improvements to chemistry like the Maxwell DBE."

You should do an AMA to explain some of this and let people who know batteries ask some questions about what else you've seen.
"Yes. But the crux of the processes used is quite different. Lead-acid battery industry is full of dinosaurs who haven’t revised their processes for ages. The recollection you had was typical but had inherently nothing to do with polyethylene as a material. It had everything to do with absolutely abysmal execution. Lithium batteries are way more cost sensitive and such waste doesn’t work there. That process you spoke of was very poorly controlled. Polyethylene turns to black goo when you overheat it. It’s not very hard not to turn it to black goo if you don’t have a plant where every cent worth of investment is hard fought for by the plant maintenance people. Owners of these enterprises, including the key stockholders, likely know what’s up and are milking it for what it’s worth until the gravy train crashes into the terminus. There’s no point in doing it any better; lead-acid is a captive market with low enough “burden” that people just bite the bullet and pay up."

But the energy per unit weight is less which impacts range. If you want the same range either the weight must come down or the battery energy density must go up.

"Just looked it up.. the semi will supposedly draw over **1 MW** at full speed charging. O.o!

I'm not sure too many warehouses will install that. Other than something like Walmart trucks that spend most of their time at company-owned docks. Most haulers are not affiliated with the docks they stop at."
Also been a lot of talk about electric overhead wires for example along interstate 5. Imagine not using your batteries at all except the last few miles. I don't know if the wired system will become reality before Tesla's version gains major market share.
Why the local guys?  I'd think they are arriving to a fully charged truck in the morning and  simply plug it in at the end of the day.
There's also the question of how much a range increase there is when you aren't carrying maximum weight.
"20 mins, plus paperwork and dicking around.  And that is on a good day.  Often trucks can sit for hours on occasion. Gravel trucks and similar are often a lot less when unloading, and that would often be at an unserviced location. Though the trip is seldom very long."
"Definitely depends on what it's carrying. When I worked at a warehouse, we'd get deliveries that were just a few pallets (I think that's called LTL shipments, less than a truckload), and deliveries that were full truckloads. Depending on what was in those truckloads, it could be 20 minutes or an hour or two.

One truck came in and all the pallets were facing the wrong way somehow. They were also all really shittily packed so they were close to bursting open when they got to us. We only had 1 forklift and it took forever to get it unloaded."
That video was my first time seeing the Rivian SUV. Both it and the truck look amazing and has me excited for them. I honestly don't see how anyone in the market for a Range Rover would not also consider this SUV as a strong contender.

"Yeah, closing nuclear power plants and then compensating it by opening new coal plants was the dumbest idea our government ever had (after invading russia in winter)"
"No, the other person misses the point of how regen braking will be used. It's a direct replacement for the current engine brake system on diesel trucks, which also only act on the drive wheels. Both systems are only used as a supplement to the standard brakes in order to regulate speed and reduce wear and heat buildup in the standard brakes. Regen is a relatively small amount of the overall braking power available.

Trailers will continue to have standard brakes, not regen brakes. If there's ever a concern about trailer stability while regen braking, the driver can just apply a little bit of standard braking as well."
"That's not how that works. Yes trailer brakes keep the trailer from trying to overtake the cab. But they do very little of the braking. Think about where the majority of the weight is in a loaded semi truck, the trailer. When the truck brakes, that weight shifts forward onto the drive wheels of the tractor which end up doing the lions share of the braking. There will be plenty of traction to regen at 60kw per motor.

Also /u/VQopponaut35"
"Not necessarily. There were some claims made on the semi launch night about the truck being essentially proof against a jacknife. I think the claim is that with the almost instantaneous response of the regen braking, on each of the independent motors, it can keep a much tighter control over directional stability. Without the same on the trailer, I can't see it being *impossible* to jacknife, though it isn't impossible to jacknife a regular semi, even if they have trailer brakes."
"If the 240Kw of regen that another commenter keeps telling me is accurate, the regen capability will only have about half the drag as that of a Diesel with jake brake applied. Jake brakes are still insufficient for braking on many steep grades, so I stand by my point."
They use it on trucks because it reduces wear and heat on the brakes; it doesn’t replace them.
"YOU'RE missing my point. 

""how much of the normal brakes are needed, as little as possible is preferred of course."" <- Basically my point"
"a semi engine isn't that heavy. they only weigh around 3k pounds. you are also again over stating the power per weight of the model s battery.

the weight is  not on the side of the tesla semi. if it is why isn't tesla advertising it? weight is super important and would be a massively popular spec to advertise.

we can see that in this picture too.

a standard semi can carry 15 of those blocks and be under 75k so if tesla is only carrying 9 and is at 7k the tractor has to be heavier.

again you're doing very favourable math.

the reality is the battery packs are closer to the 11 or 13k l which is why they can carry so few of these blocks.

weight is an issue otherwise tesla would advertise the truck is lighter. the fact that tesla is not advertising weight means they haven't solved that yet.

we know batteries are very heavy. we know tesla cars are very heavy because of the batteries.

proposing the semi will be different is absurd.

again let's see some real actual numbers. not fantasy ones.

the best bet here is to post the numbers tesla is providing for weiggt"

"Well - nobody needs to fly - and there are no reason to pretend to. It’s convenient - yes - I fly - just like most but it’s not something anyone needs. Sure there will be oil 50+ years from now - a few countries like SA, Venezuela and Russia might have much larger deposits  (and maybe new finding/methods arrive) - but regardless consumption is so high now and most oil countries have planned for post-oil for centuries that it’s actually super relevant to mention it. Oil can’t even be particular relevant for that many years - even in best case - with ever more limited sources (eg North Sea oil - not that far away to be mostly gone). Supply wise - using oil today and particular the future is like using gold coins for trading."
"With GPS being dithered on purpose and the stuff I've seen on the road, it would be a fun and interesting problem to solve. Cameras and other sensors can get covered in snow and ice. Lines on the road disappear.

Lanes can disappear pretty quick if it's snowing hard enough. Snow isn't too slippery if you have the right tires.
"People get into trucking because it's a fast track to making 65k+ a year, they often dont think much about the future.  It's way too easy for people to get used to the money and lifestyle and then they're stuck.  They have no other skills, and no other job looks at their experience as relevant.  ""Hi, I'm looking to fill the your open position "" ""sorry we dont need any truck drivers"" is literally how any job interview will go. So, unable to support themselves on an entry level job they become stuck in the industry until they are literally unable to drive anymore from old age.  There are guys I know in they're 70s and 80s that are unable to stop trucking and I really dont want to be one of them.
I got really lucky to get a job at the post office, but even then  it's not what it was a 6 years ago, there are fewer and fewer permanent positions and we new hires are played drastically less then we would be had we been hired before the last contract.

Interesting. I can confirm the black goo lol
"They get hot and won't function properly with continued excessive braking. In the UK we have gravel sides of motorways going downhill sometimes, for this very reason. Lorry brakes fail easily."
"Brake rotors overheat on semis really easy with all that weight. They engine brake with a jake brake while going down hills and convert momentum into heat/noise and exhaust it. That's also why you see runaway semi ramps along highways; If the driver fucks up they will run out of brakes.     
Replacing a jake brake with an electric generator is huge in terms of energy savings and it's also great because people wont have to hear jake brakes anymore."

Talk to any Tesla owner at superchargers you will get the same answer."
"So stopping every 3-4 hours to use the washroom, walk around, grab a coffee and snack while fast charging would suck so bad !?  Plus between the semi-regular breaks and lane keeping tech, the long day of driving would be just that much less exhausting (you'd arrive fresher)"

"The rig in the picture is carrying 9 concrete ""lego"" blocks that are very common and known.  These weigh 4,000 lbs each for a total of 36,000 lbs.  Add 2,000 for trailer, and subtract the CHP  noted 75,000 lbs and you are left with 37,000 lbs for the tractor.  

Typical diesel tractor is 32,000 lbs so this is about 2.5 tons heavier.  Average weight of 90% of class 8 trucks is 73,000.  This means the Tesla semi won't suffer being a big heavier, it would put the average weight of 90% of all hauled loads at 78,000 - under the limit by a ton."
"Google it, and the fact that it can haul as much as a conventional truck. You're allowed to weigh in at a total of 80,000 lbs. That includes fuel, truck, you, trailer, and load. The Tesla Semi can haul as much if not more than a conventional truck. Therefore it weighs the same if not less."
"That's at full speed, but perhaps they can still get some range with lower powered chargers. I might even need chargers for my own electric box trucks whenever those will be available."
"Tesla just announce the MegaPack storage devices.  It doesn't seem unreasonable that they have a version that could serve as fast charger for a Semi, that is steadily recharged between truck arrivals off the normal electrical infrastructure.  Just lease them to customers that want them and drop them one on site the next day - instant infrastructure (until you've scaled to the point where doing a service upgrade for all your EV trucks makes financial sense)"

"Cars have a much better weight distribution than trucks. They also don’t articulate in the center. Even so, the rear brakes on most cars produce \~25% of its braking force. While not the majority, I would consider 25% significant.

I also think you over estimate how much power 240Kw is. Tesla rates the truck as capable of 60 mph up a 5% grade. This means that if the motors could regen as much as they can produce, They would be unable to produce enough drag to slow the truck down on grades steeper than 5% (and spoiler: they aren’t).

I’m not sure which Mdoel 3 motors are used, but assuming standard RWD motors (worst case scenario for my example) with an output of a little over 200Kw results in less than 1/3 the ability to regen as to propel the truck. That drops you from being able to handle maintaining speed (not actually slowing the truck, but just maintaining speed) on something like a ~~1.5% grade~~(see edit). I expect that the actual regen capability is significantly higher than you are stating (with huge batteries, there is no reason for it not to be) otherwise  the regen capability would be significantly limited.

&#x200B;

\*Edit: I just did the math: 240Kw will maintain speed of 75000 LB semi traveling at 60 mph on a 2.68% grade (this is ONLY the potential energy of maintaining speed, it does not account for the reduction of any kinetic energy e.g. deceleration)."
"It’s not accurate. The 60 kW regen limit on the model three is more likely based on the battery pack rather than the motor. I don’t see any reason why the motor could not generate as much power as they can produce. I believe that’s around 200 kW, so 800 kW would be the limit for 4 motors."
"Sure, exactly the same as regenerative brakes.  This is why I don't see the problem here.  

They wouldn't use engine braking on trucks if it only reduced wear by 5% or something.  That added complexity would only be justified if it significantly contributed to the total braking effort.  Regenerative braking would have the same opportunity to contribute."

"I'm going to stop at your first sentence. If you have a problem with my numbers, go take it up with Mack. I got it directly from their spec sheet.

>if it is why isn't tesla advertising it?

First off, they have. Second, Tesla doesn't ""advertise"" anything. But based on the social media post we're all looking at above, the Tesla Semi plus empty trailer would either be equal to or less heavy than its equivalent ICE truck. Just based on the fact that it's reported as a max load, you can subtract the weight of those concrete blocks and figure out what the truck weighs. You're coming at this with nothing but conjecture, and I'm giving hard data that can be validated.

>the reality is the battery packs are closer to the 11 or 13k

If it was 1MWh, sure. But, it's not. So.

>we know tesla cars are very heavy because of the batteries.

Since you seem hell bent on this weight of an EV is higher than an ICE vehicle, compare the Model 3 with a BMW 3 series or a Merc C300 series. They're all in the same weight class, and yet somehow Tesla has a 300 mile range battery pack."

Thank you for that perspective. I’m really hoping we can do something about that big collapse before it happens.
"Absolutely. When a company has millions in revenue, what is a 25k fine? From what I was told one box of the product “approx half of a roll” had a price tag of 8k. Takes about 45 min to make a roll. We made roughly 30-40 boxes a night on my shifter if it was running well and it ran  24hr/year round. The only reason TCE was recovered in the first place is because of the price tag it has by itself. I heard stories from the old timers that before they had the carbon beds and the recovery system, once the TCE became unusable they would just drain the holding tanks in a sink hole behind the plant. 😐"

"I guess by innovate I mean fresh ideas that are super helpful (although he did poll twitter and by extension reddit at one point)... the Rivian has a lot of great ideas (which we won't know the practical value of until we try to use it on any kind of a regular basis)

Tesla should definitely bring those tints to the Model S and X.  Not that I'd every buy one, but it seems like an obvious luxury feature, and great for the self-driving taxi future.  (I just want it for car camping or other outdoor adventures ... instant privacy)"
"Yeah, but I think their target market isn't going to be towing several ton loads too often. Probably some dirt bikes and camping/hiking equipment mostly.

Ford is doing an electric F-150 based on Rivian Tech I believe if you really need that tow capability."
The only thing I would like would be a way to do solar charging. For when you want to be out all weekend in the desert or trails.
"> It’s not accurate. The 60 kW regen limit on the model three is more likely based on the battery pack rather than the motor. I don’t see any reason why the motor could not generate as much power as they can produce. I believe that’s around 200 kW, so 800 kW would be the limit for 4 motors. 

I agree with you there (I've commented both the fact that it should be able to regen to a greater extent because of its larger batteries and that the RWD motors are \~200kw).

What I'm saying is that there will be some required breaking on the rear axles and without motors/generators there; energy will be lost."
"> That added complexity would only be justified if it significantly contributed

 Look up how a diesel compression brake works. There is very little ""added complexity"" which is why they are so popular. Now I'm not saying they aren't effective; but they aren't expensive. Furthermore they are not a replacement for brakes (And I'm not referring to only panic stop situations). Brakes are still required on steep grades or when quicker deceleration is required (the most significant source of heat based energy loss) so if you aren't capturing the majority of that energy, you are leaving a lot on the table.

Regenerative braking's #1 job is not to reduce wear and tear on the brakes (which are very cheap) but to recapture energy that would otherwise be lost as heat. So if you want your Tesla Semi to have as long of a range as possible, it needs to be able to capture as much energy as possible (which is not possible with only the driver wheels of the truck)."
"Have you ever driven a car of any kind? Even ICE cars engine brake. To what capacity is my entire point. 

""Will be the same for the truck."" As I have said ad nauseam, what is true for a car is different for a semi. The entire point of the comment. Believe it or not, when you make something 20x heavier and only increase the motors by 4x it reacts very differently (especially considering the other previously mentioned variables)."
">But based on the social media post we're all looking at above, the Tesla Semi plus empty trailer would either be equal to or less heavy than its equivalent ICE truck

It looks like it weighs more...

Those blocks weigh around 4,300 lbs and there is 9 which is 38,700 lbs. An empty flatbed trailer in that size weighs around 12,000 lbs. You can get some in the 10 or 11 range but lets use 12. That gives us a total weight of 50,700 for the trailer and blocks. 

Subtract that from 75,000 which is the reported weight and we get 24,300 lbs for a non-sleeper

A standard tandem sleeper semi tops out at around 22,000, if you take the sleeper off they clock in at about 17,000.

So this Tesla semi which _is not a sleeper_ weights 2,000 lbs more than a much larger truck. If you compare it to a non-sleeper it weights 7,300 lbs more.

So based on this social media post the semi weighs a lot more than a standard semi.

>First off, they have. Second, Tesla doesn't ""advertise"" anything.

Where? Link to the official weight of both the semis?

>You're coming at this with nothing but conjecture, and I'm giving hard data that can be validated.

I gave hard data and a source as well. You are providing high end numbers which artificially bring the weight down."
greetings.
All that are conveniences - as in conveniences for mostly 1 world countries - but in any case it’s possible to fly without using fossil. And my point is that fossil is a limited resource - that soon will be limited enough - that it in any case - cannot be a mainstream source of energy like today.
I have absolutely no idea. I don't know much at all about the logistics industry.
"There are a bunch of airplanes out there that can land themselves. I don't think we would see pilots going away anytime soon. 

I think trains are going to get more popular in the USA for traveling considering how much less emissions there with train travel compared with planes. Might have a bigger affect on trucking than self driving."
"The typical Florida rainstorm makes humans incapable of seeing 2 ft ahead.

Then 30 min later it's sunshine for the rest of the day. FL taught me that hourly weather forecasts are quite useful."
You're most welcome.
"32,000 lbs is average for the weight of a tractor with an empty trailer, not just the cab. Doing the math like they did, they calculated the weight of the Tesla *with* the unloaded trailer, since the only things we do know from the post are the weight of the load and the total test weight."
its not.
"Engine: 2900lb
Transmission: 720lb
Fuel: 2400lb
Total: 6020lb"
"That article is guessing anyways, but keep looking, you'll see. Who cares how much the battery weighs anyways? The total weight is all that matters and total weight is again, the same or less."
"If they are relying on EV trucks, they could likely lease a MegaPack to drop in place to serve as a fast charger for the Semi and have it steadily recharging off the limited local infrastructure \[I'm not saying Tesla will offer this, but it seems like it could be a valuable service for worksites or less developed locations\]"
Thanks for letting me know :)
"Some energy will definitely be lost thermodynamics is pretty specific about that. The only distinction that I see is if it will be lost into consumables (brake pads) or not. One of the interesting concepts here that Tesla may or may not apply is the giant steel ""lightbulb” on the top of trains. Diesel-electric trains use their (electric) motors for braking but its not regenerative because there is no where to store the electricity, especially in the stunningly vast quantities a loaded diesel locomotive makes. So what they do is effectively "" burn"" it with a big resistive heating coil on the top of the train. If Tesla were to do that they could ""regen"" brake at the motors max even with a full/current-limited pack."
How much?  How much did you account for the anti-jackknifing technology implemented across the 4 motors?
"I don't think anybody suggested that regenerative braking would be able to completely replace friction braking.  I just don't see the placement of the brakes being a big problem, because trucks already attempt to brake only using their drive wheels as much as possible and then apply the rest supplementally when this is insufficient.  That is exactly how I use the brakes in my Model 3.

Obviously you'd have to work out the exact numbers to determine the relative change.  If regenerative brakes were 10x more powerful than engine braking or something like that then of course you'd have to consider if there is a risk to the loss of balance.  If they're just comparable to what already is in use then I'd expect there to be no impact, but of course it wouldn't change the wear on conventional brakes either.  To the degree they're in-between then testing would probably have to be done to determine the practical impact."
Know ye that imposing
"I'm just saying that oil isn't as limited as you think it is, and it will be relevant for a long period of time (especially for petroleum products where we haven't created a synthetic substitute yet).  But we are better off pollution, global warming, and energy efficiency wise, to quit using it as a primary energy source.

It's just a better sell when we use accurate statements, rather than being misleading or misinformed like the oil industry has been pushing for the last 50 years.  \[And not being unrealistic by dismissing modern systems as an unnecessary conveniences, it makes it hard to take your argument seriously\]"
"I doubt trains will be any more popular in the future, simply because rail is expensive as fuck to build. The US doesn't already have a vast passenger train network in place, like Europe and Japan and such have, not least because the US is so damn huge."
"Problem with the plains is that the pilot is not as expensive compared to the machine and travelcost itself in comparison with driver/truck and a lot of flying is with people on board - which will take a lot to get rid of pilots and will require backup pilots even when the plane can do it all by itself.

I mean you need one driver for a truck and can only carry the load of the truck and the trailer compared to a pilot who got 200 people or way more goods on board. The pilot is relatively speaking way cheaper since the plain uses way more fuel and is way more expensive to operate."

"That gets really complicated with the fact that 90% of the trucks are owner operated.  Unless there is a ubiquitous battery lease program where anyone can swap a battery pack with anyone, you are going to have troubles with that.  I know I sure wouldn't want to swap my well cared for pack out somewhere with one that was abused by a contract employee. Hypothetically"
"They recently showcased it pulling a 1.25 million pound rail car, but pulling on rail is different than pulling on asphalt. Still, it should have a decent towing capacity! It just probably won't be as fancy as the Rivian with the gear tunnel, 180 degree tailgate, automatic bed cover, compressed air hookup, etc.

Edit: Also, not sure what you're towing, but [this](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018) claims 11,000 pounds which should be plenty for most applications I feel like. Again, I don't really tow much."
"Again, I'm not suggesting a completely replacement; but I simply asked if the truck would be able to reclaim as large of a percentage of its kinetic energy during deceleration as a passenger car can. A model 3 is significantly different than a semi in power to weight, # of driven wheels, placement of driven wheels, weight distribution, articulation, etc. 

The end result is that the regen system will only be able to capture a significantly reduced percentage of energy when coming to a stop whereas it could potentially capture all of it (with some conversion losses of course) under light to moderate deceleration if the it had motors/generators on the rear axles."
Well I haven’t said oil is limited now - but realistically it should hit some strains max 30 years from now (or so) if consumption isn’t lowered. Which to me isn’t a longtime away.
"The EPA estimates the typical weight of an unladen Class 8 tractor-trailer combination is on the order of 35,000 pounds while payloads typically max out at about 40,000 pounds. So while 80,000 pounds is the load limit for Class 8 trucks, well over 90% of the tractor-trailers weigh in at less than 73,000 pounds.Oct 17, 2013"
"It's easy. The estimate of battery weight is wrong, and has always been wrong.

You want to know how I know? It's got massive transport company customers lining up to try it in their fleets. Customers that were part of the design process, and have a clue what they're talking about. As opposed to some random on the interwebs who's citing a 2 year old guesstimate (a long time in this type of tech circles) as proof it won't work."
"Sorry what?  I'm not saying swap batteries, that's an unworkable solution for many reasons. I'm saying it could be easy to deploy superchargers using their utility storage turnkey solutions to locations that might otherwise have inadequate infrastructure. \[being in similar to shipping containers, they seem easy to deploy and re-deploy as necessary\]

Perhaps it wouldn't be the pit leasing it if it's all private trucks, perhaps it's just Tesla placing it where there's need/demand for charging.  Most trucks with less than 500 miles daily use would be charging overnight anyway."
Holy crap thank you sir I now have my new dream truck :P   5.5 tons is perfect for my uses. That’s really impressive. Most half ton pickups are towing that today with ICE.
"I doubt it will recover the same percentage as a passenger car. It doesn't have the same power to weight ratio for accelerating, so it won't have it for braking either."
"Well read the report linked.  Some of that downturn might be more investment and development related as well, as opposed to the reserve supply itself. 

I wonder how investment and oil production efficiency will be impacted as we move off fossil fuels (ie, will the efficiency/economy of the system collapse, or will it just highlight how much of the prices have been artificial).  US Gov scientist figure that by 2050 (if I remember correctly) the US could transition to 80% renewables for it's energy needs (using currently available technology) and that itself is likely to have a strain on the supply system (not enough demand to keep production and distribution efficient)"
Your Google fu is weak sir
">The EPA estimates the typical weight of an unladen Class 8 tractor-trailer combination is on the order of 35,000 pounds

Sorry I was too busy to give you a real reply earlier. ""tractor-trailer combination"", as the name suggests, includes the tractor and the trailer. Not just the tractor.

NEXT! Where's the next apologist!?"
">You want to know how I know? It's got massive transport company customers lining up to try it in their fleets.

...which is not indicative of the weight of the vehicle in any way. LOL seriously, that's the argument you're going with?"
"Ah, I see.  Sorry, misunderstood.  Gravel trucks and greenfield construction equipment will probably be some of the last to change over to EV. When you are the equipment needed to bring utilities to an area, it's hard to rely on things like superchargers.  I have worked in places where the nearest powerline was over 100 miles away.  Part of our project was to connect to it.  Hydrogen, or carbon-capture based fuels are more likely to resolve issues like that."
"Everything I learn about the Rivian makes me want it more. They just talked about having an optional removable roof which I think is pretty cool.

Check out /r/Rivian!"
Thanks didn’t want to go too hard might make your fartbox sore...
Nobody cares about you? Why would there be a next?
"It means the weight is not enough of a concern to companies that want to haul real goods, yes, that's what I'm going with over a bad guess. It's called evidence over wishful thinking. Nobody really knows what they weigh, except the people making purchasing decisions, and they've ordered enough for me to believe that there's not an issue."
"Hard to say, they have EV mining trucks, so it's not like they aren't making heavy equipment out of it today, and EVs have better torque and efficiency.  At the very least I'm surprised there aren't more hybrid applications here.

There definitely will be other approaches as well.  I know some companies are betting on fuel cell Semi's, and fuel cell tech is getting better, so who knows."
LOL okay? Because there have already been 4 people trying to correct me because they're not being objective and just Googling anything that appears to support what they want to believe.
Whether or not anybody wants to buy it was never the subject of the conversation. Different people have different needs.
Have you been checked?
"Yes, I'm still STI-free somehow"
I was referring to your intellect
If that’s from an SR he would have blanketed the inside of a P100DL’s windshield with puke
I switched back to my Tacoma from my SR+ for a Home Depot run the other day. I was so disappointed when I floored it and the truck just made a bunch of loud noises and didn’t push me back into my seat!
"We rented this Tesla Model 3 SR+ on Turo, went on a great road trip. Stopped off to charge for about 20 minutes, and when we left and hit the freeway on-ramp we decided to go wide open throttle. Well one passenger did not fare well.🤢 He held it together long enough for us to stomp the brakes and stop off the side of the highway luckily. 🤮Ten minutes later we were on our way, this time with grace. 😇"
abrupt transition from ICE to EV
I get carsick when I sit in the 3rd row of a 2006 Honda Odyssey.  Something about sitting behind the rear axle that messes with my brain.  I think some people just get carsick.
"Haha. Took a friend in my P3D yesterday for the first time. He got a phone call shortly after getting in. While he was talking I gave it the beans. His conversation went something like “yeah so then I w—WWWWHHHAAA. OH MY GOD. HAHA, woah. So, uh... um. .... I have no idea what I was saying....”"
"My son had a sleepover for hit 8th birthday, so I mashed the throttle in our Model X on an on ramp for the kids and one of them puked. Fortunately the kid managed to get it all in his booster seat cup holder."
That's from a SR+? I must have got a different car. That or I'm not punching it?
"And this is why I'm not worried about the acceleration in my future vehicle. If an SR+ can make someone sick, then   0.2 more seconds is enough for me in terms of a fun family vehicle."
"I drove a Hyundai for a week on vacation, came back and floored my Model 3 and felt a sensation in my head lol. The acceleration is awesome in the SR+"
Are you taking him to hospital? Your GPS is leading you to a medical center

It’s the basic SR+ ? Omg. I can’t wait to get mine.

"Nicht so schnell Chaqueline, sonst kotzt du wieder."
I remember my first time.
Isn't the acceleration of anything short of a dual motor performance pretty average?  Even the 4.4 0-60 of the LR shouldn't be that vomit inducing.

How does the SR+ performance compare to the Dual Motor?
Fresh air also helps with preventing car sickness. A little crack is all I ask.
Oh my ahahaahhaha
Just put the roadster 0-60 in a calculator and it gives you 1.44 lateral g which is pretty nuts
"I once had a friend get sick from launch control in a twin turbo (or is it bi-turbo) diesel Audi, so I believe you that even the lower spec Tesla can do this"
"It's always a good idea to check if people get motion sickness before taking them for a spin. A coworker almost got sick when I didn't ask the question. If so, put it on chill with low Regen."
“I don't care that they stole my idea. I care that they don't have any of their own.” - Nikola Tesla
That happened
Chill mode?
Odd way to clean your pants...
Lololol srsly
Was it from aggressive regen? What happened?
"Oh look, wildflowers! Come look dear"
"Turn off regen braking, chill mode."
"There's a speed limit, not an accelration limit ha"
"I got sick test driving a dual motor, yes I was driving, and I decided I didn’t to get the performance model."
Wish I could afford one. Any of them really.
Hmmm...Centralia...are you sure it wasn't from the liquid cow shit fertilizer sprinklers?
"Out with his friend Huey,I see..."
Gonna have to work up to that 2020 Roadster test drive.
When you use sliding movement in Minecraft vr.
OP I also have a blue m3. And I'm also in PNW. But I wish I was as clever as you naming it Sonic
"My uncle really wanted to see the 0-60 times but he couldn’t hold it up 60 after some hard accelerations and had to stop. I only have the mid range, so I imagine the performance model is what would make you need a minute."
I do get an evil chuckle when I tell people to put their head on the headrest and they don't.
My brother got sick too after acceleration in my Model 3 AWD. I had a good laugh
"Haha, thanks. That kid is the real here for making it all in the cup holder though."
Is that legit?   I just cant seeyself or someone puking after acclerating in any car tbh.   Unless it's like a dragracer maybe?
"So I’m a bit confused by what the SR+ offers.  Like I mean the upgrade to the premium interior LR model gives you 1 year of connectivity to internet and such, but you can buy all that stuff for the SR+ also right? Paid for annually or?"
Can’t wait to feel like him...

Ahhh the beloved back seat
Who’s the homeless dude?
Imagine sending him to Mars Lol
I lovecars and enthusiastic driving. Unfortunately a nearly 10s 0-60 car driven very gently is still enough to do this to my wife fairly regularly. I *reeeeeally* doubt she'll be impressed by my upcoming purchase :D
Pussy
Decrease recuperation. It maybe a reaction on single pedal driving.
Can you add personal POI's to the map? It would be fun to mark the spot where your he puked. :)
Haha 😆

People throw up at fast acceleration wtf?
When someone takes a close look of the interior of a $100000 car.
It's probably a lot less to do with acceleration and a lot more to do with crappy driving.
"FYI, having regen not on low will cause several rear passengers to have this sick feeling. I had to turn it to low because adults were complaining. Not about the acceleration but the regen breaking"
Or that person gets car sick...
I will not buy a Tesla because they make me and passengers so sick. The regenerative braking is the worst! They also feel too airtight and the odd AC vents in the model 3 for some reason don't offer the same relief as other cars.
"So that was you i passed by?! I was in a Lincoln Navi, and saw this driver pulled over hurling. 

The auburn/kent stretch was f’in to a stand still today... as always."
People complain about feeling sick in my P3D.  I've driven a P100D Model X and they feel very similar.  Still want to try the P100DL Model S.
"My AWD 3 has made my wife so sick she made me pull over while she gagged. 

I’ve also made my buddy yell at me after lunch. On the third 0-60 run he said he was about to hurl.."
"Made the mistake of driving a Model S P100DL before I bought my SR+. Don't get me wrong, the SR+ is still plenty quick once it's on the move but it really lacks punch off the line. I think to 15 mph our Leaf 40 might be quicker."
Tbh there are roller coasters out there that make even a p100d look pitiful
Almost full charge and only 198 mile range. Yikes.
Aka when the driver is shit at driving.
"I hope one day I'll see a fast Telsa driver in the wild, instead of being stuck behind them going ten below the speed limit on fun motorcycle roads."
I can’t even imagine the feeling of that acceleration.
He'd have worn most of it. 😂
Pretty sure the puke would be on the back windshield and all over his face!
"Talked to an advisor after we did a launch in a X100DL, he said he was good for about 4 of those a day and no more."
"When I did my test drive (before I bought my S75) it was in a P100D with ludicrous mode. The salesperson was in the passenger seat and my wife behind her. Salesperson directed me to a highway onramp and had me hold for a second to let the car in front get some distance, then she said to punch it. I did, and my wife said, and I quote, ""HOLY SHIT!!!"" as the car threw her back in her seat. Even without the performance package and ludicrous mode I always tell my passengers to put their head back before I show off the accelleration. \*chuckle\*"
I used to go test drive on my birthday every year until I bought my model 3 LR RWD. The acceleration in the P100D is truly LUDICROUS.
Roadster 2020
What about the new Tesla Roadster with SpaceX package? 😂😂😂😂
Needs a supercharger and nitrous. Haha.
I had a similar experience yesterday in my f-150. Went from the P3d and I thought my truck was screwed up when I started to drive it. Where's my electric truck at?
"How does charging work with a rented Tesla? I don’t have a Tesla myself but from what I understand if you use a supercharger your account just gets billed automatically, so if it’s being rented out how do you pay for it?"
And this is why you should limit your speed in the app when renting out your Tesla.
I didn't know you can rent Teslas. I'd love to rent one for a weekend.
"Thank God, I thought you were on a gravel road"
> abrupt transition from a **slow** ICE to EV
"When you sit behind the axle, it acts as a fulcrum where movements are exaggerated.  It's why the back of a school bus is very bumpy."
"Understandable, he was riding in the backseat and this was a RWD so he was still in front of that rear axle."
"I mean, if you're doing fast corners, sitting in the back makes them worse. I don't think there's any difference if we're just talking acceleration..."
The regents braking on Tesla’s and fast acceleration makes it worse for those folks.
"wow, that's so weird... My words in a P3D were just a mumbled  
^^""Holy ^^shit""  
because I couldn't really catch my breath..."
"Test driving a P3D:

Rep: ""Ok, once we get on the highway I want you to floor it."" (This is PA where we have stop signs at on ramps ""*for some fucking reason*)

Me: ""Ok""

Me: *floors it*

Me: *weird gremlin giggling for about 10 seconds*

Rep: ""It's fun isn't it""

Me: *more weird giggling*"
LOL. I bet all the kids laughed at him
Holy shit you are a cool dad 😂
Shit genetics. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ My LR AWD has only gotten 1 person I know to feel very mildly nauseous at worst.
"> 0.2 more seconds

While I understand your point, let's not undersell the P3D. The difference between that and this is 2 *whole* seconds, not 2 tenths of a second. :D"
"I would say that anyone who gets “sick” in an SR+ is certainly an outlier. That being said, everything Tesla makes is more than enough. I consider anything with a 7ish second 0-60 adequate and anything 6 or below starts to feel a little fun."
"It's all relative. If you're coming from a RAV4 or something, it's going to seem fun for a bit(or a while depending on what you find to be fun). 

For me, the P3D is really fun, but even with that I mostly found it to be fun at city speeds as it really falls off after maybe 70mph."
We indeed we’re taking him to a medical facility just in case.
Tune in tonight on CNN for this special report.
Yep!!
I can’t wait
Full throttle much? Did you get used to it in the end?
Pretty average? 4.4s is pretty damn fast and that’s a conservative # they use.
Agreed. There are probably outliers who are fairly sensitive who can get sick in just about any car.
"Thank you!! Haha as a casual Tesla fan, I was getting a little lost."
"Dual motor is 4.4, P3D is 3.5 LR SR+ is 5.3. It’s all extremely fast."
About a second slower to 60 with about 60% less power.
Can you do the rest of the Tesla lineup 0-60’s?
"I get motion sick on roller coasters, but I can handle high acceleration if it's linear.

Teach your passengers the ""valsalva maneuver"" to keep the organs from sloshing about.  The acceleration doesn't make them sick, it's the deceleration after that acceleration that does it."
Vomiting. When you just don’t want to take a shit.
Just her freeway on ramp acceleration. Basically a roll on from 10-70mph.
"Well yes there is, bound by the laws of physics."
Yes it’s legit.
I’m not entirely certain of the exact differences. Here’s what the standard range offers: https://electrek.co/2019/05/26/tesla-start-selling-standard-range-model-3-locked-features/
Change your flair on desktop.
"No, but I can see why you would think that if you are referencing ICE vehicles. A Tesla will pull much harder than an ICE vehicle of comparable 0-60 time, and then start to even out and fall slightly behind as the power builds on the ICE. That being said, a 5 second car is fairly quick in my opinion and I think the SR+ is relatively fun to drive."
Shouldn’t really happen over time after you learn to ease off the throttle and use regen braking normally.
Its a bit like driving a manual. If you just let off the accelerator its going to lurch. After a day or two you learn to ease off for smooth transitions.
Yeah this was rough in traffic especially. We had to set ours to low as well.
"That may be a problem originating somewhere between the accelerator pedal and the seat.

As a driver you can ease off the pedal more gradually unless absolutely necessary, making for a smoother ride. I just rode with someone today who was not doing this and it was remarkably jarring each time they would suddenly and needlessly let up on the pedal all the way."
"I mean, if you can't adapt to easing off the accelerator (incredibly easy, a few days to adjust at most), you can just set the regen to Low which then makes the car feel like any regular automatic on the road.

As for the AC, I can't guess what you're doing wrong there. Even the vents on 7 or 8 move significantly more air than any car I've ever been in. But if it doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you I guess."
Sounds like it’s not the car for you.
This was in Centralia last Saturday.
Cool story bro!
We only charged to 70%.
"Right foot down, straight line? What?"
"You can feel your guts push back inside you in a P85D, seriously. I can't imagine in a P100D."
"you get used to it, it's amazing. I've had some people cry though.."
"Test drove a P100D, felt the blood rush from my face to the back of my head... had a headache for the rest of the day :)"
Test driven multiple times lol. It’s like a roller coaster on the first drop.
"An idea.
https://imgur.com/a/IeBCQ7E"
"Honestly the jump from an SR+ to just the LR AWD felt pretty huge to me when I test drove an SR+ before taking my LR AWD home (same day, as my car wasnt ready when I arrived so they sent me out in the SR+ for a while to get a feel for it)."
Got a P90D as a loaner for one of my service center trips for my SR+ and hoooooly crap its amazing feeling lol.
"I got a P85D as a loaner one day, it's the only thing I've driven that makes my AWD 3 feel slow. I finally punched it on the drive back to pick up my car and am pretty sure I could feel brain fluids pooling in the back of my skull."
"IMHO this is more from the constant regenerative braking than the acceleration. I switch to relaxed regen braking mode when I carpool with one of my friends who has severe motion sickness. It takes a while for body to get used to it, but it does get better."
I was in it when my mom test drove it. It feels insane!
"It's a bit more intense than jumping face first off a ~120ft building. (>1G continuous, 1.4G peak)

It's fun :)"
"""You could have saved some money if you'd gotten a Prius."""
"Or a turbo LS swap:

https://youtu.be/ZRewZb8naGg"
"After we return the car, we just pay the amount of supercharging we utilized while on our trip. It was about $20."
"It wasn’t the speed, rather the rate of acceleration. We utilized AP about 95% of the time."
"I was thinking of listing my model 3 on Turo soon, and whether or not I would turn on any limits. I decided I won't; there's plenty of times where having decent acceleration available has saved my life, e.g. getting around/away from a drunk or distracted driver. Acceleration is a safety feature, imo"
"Fucking **GROSS**.

I will not rent a Tesla that’s fucked with like that."
[deleted]
So then why are people puking when they get in my leaf?!
"Even ""fast"" ICE vehicles are a completely different sensation from a Tesla (specifically a Performance 3 or P85D or faster) unless you're talking about a supercharged torque monster with perfect traction.

Even 500+hp ICE cars still don't have the same instant torque sensation until you get up to like 3000 rpm or so.

They're totally different monsters, though."
No just abrupt transition from ice to ev. No ICE has instant torque.
"My 2014 S60 (0-60 of 5.4s, slowest car tesla has made) made my passenger horribly nauseous just 2 weeks ago. Though that's also the first time that that has happened. 

Some people who haven't been in an EV before aren't prepared for the sudden powerful acceleration. Plus, don't forget that when you're the driver you know what's going to happen. When you're the passenger the acceleration feels like you're falling off the side of the earth and like you're going to die. At least for some people. 

Also note that we as drivers know how much we're pushing on the pedal. I can feel when my S60 maxes out its acceleration, it's a clear as day plateau of acceleration -- for me. My passengers, even the ones who are with me a lot, don't notice it. Being a passenger is a very different experience."
Shit genetics exactly.
What he said ^. 3.2s vs 5.3s is a WORLD of difference.
"I know I shouldn’t think about it, but this makes me sad.  I dropped $61k last year on my long range and didn’t get performance because it was too much.  Seeing prices now, damn, maybe I could’ve waited....

But yea, that full tax incentive was nice though.....

Still sucks."
When my wife is the passenger I make sure I have on chill mode *and* I feather the accelerator gently. She doesn't puke but hates the harsh jerk of acceleration and mine isn't much faster than the SR+
I’d encourage you to be in the same car as a passenger. There’s something about not being in control of the acceleration that gives it that extra kick.
"I'd rather experience crazy g forces at lower speeds then at higher speeds.
Driving on the Autobahn at 200kmph is scary enough. I don't need my 3 AWD to blast to 233 kmph.
0-60 though.... That's a lot of fun in the right (safe) circumstances."
You're kidding right? Please be kidding.
"It's an upset stomach, he'll be fine."
"The SR+ is rate at 5.3 according to Tesla.  

I said anything short of DM is average and yes the LR shouldn't be vomit inducing.  Heck, my daily driver crossover can do it in 4.5 and it's not something that has made anyone car sick."
New P3D number is 3.2s.
"I know it's about a 1s slower since this is stated on Tesla's site, but from the perspective of actually driving it, how much can you tell?"
There’s probably a lot of truth to that. I’ve noticed that some people tend to drive by stabbing the throttle and coming off really quickly. That will certainly cause the ride to be jarring with regen.
"Lurch yes, engine brake so hard definitely no, unless maybe you're driving some huge engine car like a Viper? I have never felt anything close to the P3D high regen in a manual/dual clutch car."
Sounds like I need to give it another try.. I've only driven a model 3 twice
"Sounds like they rode with a bad driver, or tried to drive it and dismissed it prematurely without understanding the different ways the accelerator pedal can be used."
You didn’t have to take it as an insult I was just saying that there are even crazier accelerating thing out there that the dude in the pic would puke on.
bro 😎💪
I tapped out as a passenger in a p100D. As a driver I slowly worked my way up to full pedal down.  It is probably something I should not do as I get a little light headed at full power.  A model 3 AWD does not make me lightheaded.
"I had one as a loaner once. It’s pretty jarring in Ludicrous mode - like you could hurt a passenger if they weren’t ready.

On the other extreme I had a back seat passenger I had to pull over for in my S75D.

Our P3D feels closer to the P100 than to the 75D even though the 0-60 is smack between them. Sometimes we need chill mode for sensitive passengers..."
"My dad test drove a P100D for my birthday (was too young to drive, so I was a passenger). This was also my first drive ever in Tesla. The sales rep did a 0-60 launch right out of the dealer and I legit could not breathe while we were accelerating. It was so quick that I started hysterically laughing after we were up to speed. All in all, great fun, would do it again!"
You develop very strong neck muscles
"The Raven P100D's are insane. It feels like all the blood pools to the back of your head from the force. Leaves you a little lightheaded honestly. 

But man does that adrenaline feel good..."
If you have ever been on the Rock ‘n Roller coaster at Disney World Hollywood Studios in Orlando it is exactly like that.  Was in a Ludicrous equipped model X and it was like being fired out a gun.
"The quickest Tesla I’ve experienced was a P85+ and I couldn’t wait to try the P85D. 

Literally will slam your head into the back of the seat if you aren’t ready."
I tried the p100d at the Tesla store. It's almost too fast
I’ve got a cousin who’s got one. You can genuinely feel your brain move inside of your skull.
"Test drove a model S performance(basically the p100d I think, it had ludicrous mode and all that) can confirm the feeling of acceleration is insane"
P100D is brutal. Makes my car seem slow. A lot of fun though!
I drove a P90DL MX and almost sh@t my pants with the 3.0 speed. I could feel the blood pooling away from my face to the back of my head.
"I have  75d. You know I'm thinking oh yeh nice, pretty quick. Feel like I'm in a C63/M4 type speed. Had a p100d for a day long test drive, it feels like when you get to the top of a rollercoaster and then when it tips and you start falling down. Its like it's uncontrollable"
Like the Superman rollercoaster launch..lol
I feel my guts in my Sr+. The p100d I drove was nuts and I didn't even give it all the way
I have a P85D and people always say their eyeballs get sucked back in their head lol 👀
I went from a P85D to the P100DL the only difference is how long you feel that acceleration and the fact that you can get the same snap while going 35mph as you get at 0 in the P85D. It's awesome! 😎
Even in a normal 100D I could instantly feel all the blood rush to the back of my head
The normal 85 model S almost made me puke. I can't imagine the p100
"I got to drive a P85D model S with ludicrous mode and launch setup. It was unlike anything I have ever experienced before. If it had been equipped with wings, it would probably be able to achieve lift off."
"I am used to fast cars, I’ve ridden in a 8 second car before. Test drove a P100DL and my face was like :D :D :D :D :D and my friends in the back seats cried. 

We only got up to 80 mph...

My favorite part was how it changed passing people. In big boost turbo cars it goes:

-	Start to roll on the throttle to build boost
-	Put on turn signal
-	Change lanes and fly past

In the P100DL it was:

-	Put on turn signal
-	Change lanes
-	Floor it and complete pass"
Is this a P100DL?! Jesus Christ!
Just LS swap everything.
Without even looking I know you’re talking about Turbo Tom... loving this build
Speed limit mode also activates chill mode which limits acceleration. I actually wish you could enable one without the other.
"Yep. That's how it is most of the time.

I've only begun taking physics, but I've learned that we don't react to velocity but acceleration. It was something I also learned in Calc 1.

The 1st derivative of a velocity function (or the 2nd derivative of a position function) is an acceleration function. It is also called a ""jerk"" function in physics/higher math. It's called that for the exact reason that you have attributed as the cause - it's the rate of acceleration.

Some examples, 

> Changing gears in an average car, especially with a foot-operated clutch, offers well-known examples: although the accelerating force is limited by engine power, an inexperienced driver lets you experience severe jerk, just because of intermittent force closure over the clutch. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics)

Another example: hink of when an elevator starts to move down or up. Once that happens, you either feel a slight sense of being stretched, pushed down due to the massive change in acceleration.

Wikipediahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics) page on jerk motion in physics and calculus."
"I’ve thought about renting my LR out for on Turo. If and when I do, I won’t limit the speed or put on chill mode. Let’s be real, that’s one of the reasons people want to rent a Tesla. One this I will do is turn off NoA w/o Confirmation. If they want it on, they can turn it on through the menus. I want it to be a deliberate thought though. Don’t need anyone thinking they can just let the car take them to there destination. It takes a little practice to know the limits of NoA."
Is this info open to the public? As in you put it in your listing or let the renter know? The only reason I would rent a tesla is for acceleration...
"Don’t be a dick with your Tesla on Turo.

I had an uppity owner get mad I charged his battery to 100% for a longer trip. The car had 20K miles on it and he claimed it had never been filled to 100%."
"I’ve read in the Tesla subreddit that Tesla didn’t honor the warranty on some cars that were being used in rental fleets because they were “commercial use” 

Wonder if they would find out if a car was being rented out on Turo"
The smell.
The interior.
The styling
"Can a passenger notice though? If the driver downshifts right into the powerband and punches it, the torque is there. A passenger might not notice that it is delayed."
"That isn't entirely true. Most supercars have similar rates of acceleration as a P100D, they're just marginally slower to 60 which is why people always talk about the Tesla. There are other factors to consider as well. A Porsche Turbo S, Audi R8 V10, and Ferrari LaFerrari all experience greater jerk than a P100D which is ultimately what causes the feeling that make people uneasy. There is a psychological element to the uneasy feeling the Tesla creates which is the lack of sound. Without hearing the sounds of an ICE engine as it beings to accelerate, your body doesn't really prepare for the launch of an electric car."
There are certainly ice vehicles that launch much harder than an SR+.
"I'm aware of the driver vs passenger feeling. I've been the passenger in my car a few times letting people drive it and telling them to have as much fun as they want.

My point still stands 100% for ""shit genetics"" and being easily carsick or not. :D"
Muscle car vs super car.
"I agree; some people will puke in the back of a Prius, it doesn’t mean the car is “too powerful”. Saying the SR+ makes people puke is misleading in my opinion."
"I've been in it as a passenger, it's definitely a little weird when there is no noise to indicate it.

I've been a passenger in very fast cars before(C6 ZR1, F90 M5 Competition and a few others) and at least with ICE you know they downshifted or whatever so you're prepared."
"True. For me it just ends a bit quick lol, can't really do more than 50mph safely around town so your accelerations in the P3D are a couple seconds long. The lack of sound takes away from my experience as well personally, I love a nice engine/supercharger/exhaust noise."
Turned out he had to be put down.
Dad?
I agree the SR+ acceleration should not induce vomit but I can definitely see the AWD doing it for susceptible people.
"4.5 in a car with a multi speed transmission does not feel the same as 4.5 in an EV. 

It’s why early year EVs such as the Chevy Spark EV, and BMW i3 feel much faster than their 7 second + 0-60 time. 

The linear acceleration in an EV is much different."
We confirmed this 5.3 with multiple 0-60 tests.
More like 3.4 if you exclude the rollout.
"I haven’t driven the AWD, only the Performance and SR+. So I’m kind of estimating here. You’ll certainly fill the difference if you drive them back to back, but the SR is plenty fun to drive and will impress your typical person off the street."
"Yeah, that regen feels like hard braking in another car. You definitely get used to feathering that pedal, though."
Yeah I was a passenger and kinda blacked out for a sec.  it’s intense.  Too much for me.
"Can confirm.

New owner, the p100d feels like the take off of rock n rollercoaster. Do it too often and you for sure feel it."
"Exactly. I feel when doing a full-on acceleration that if I did 3-4 back-back, I might cause brain damage!"
"No, but we feel it! Amazing car."
"I test drove an S once (can't remember which, it was a while back, but it was a higher end one, the rep said he wanted me to have fun with the test). It was my first time driving an electric. I almost hurt myself."
Have a Model S70 which is the slowest sedan Tesla makes and people still get shocked by the acceleration. It's not even close to the feeling a P100D can give you but still pushes you back and is super fun. Definitely an enjoyable amount of power without getting into trouble too quick.
"The P3D is kind of “fun,” slightly uncomfortable if you’re not ready for it, but I wouldn’t say jarring. 

Was the P100DL a whole other level above that?"
I had a loaner 75D and my 3 LR AWD has stronger acceleration
I've gotten my share of oofs groans from passengers who weren't ready for sudden starts in my 3.
"Can confirm.  You can easily hurt somebody if you punch it and they aren’t ready for it.  

Source:  I have a p100d and a pissed off wife (she’s fine)

Seriously though, passengers get pushed back into their seats hard.  If they aren’t all the way back and expecting it, it’s not a good reaction."
"I've driven the P85D, and the P100DL. Both are absolutely. fucking. nuts."
"Coming from turbo cars (nothing that fast though) the responsiveness is just next worldly.  As close to instant as you can get.  Tesla used to list a ""passing"" time, from 45-75mph of 1.2s on their spec sheet."
"Yeah, with the battery heated up to 50C (less resistance, most power possible) and launched with launch mode.  Just stomping on it without Ludicrous+ on and it's probably 0-60 in about 2.8-3s.  With everything on it's a much more intense experience (and <2.4s)."
"*crowd of grocery getters*

You get an LS! YOU get and LS! *You* get an LS!"
"See I love this sub because despite our mutual love for Tesla's abs electric vehicles, we can still share our joy for ice vehicles. You guys rock"
"Well you can enable chill mode separately. The speed limit mode is intended for letting someone borrow the car that might try and joy ride, like an unscrupulous valet, child, etc. Where it makes sense to have both an acceleration reduction and a top speed limit."
"If it's not, I'd just ask the owner if they put the car in Chill mode or activate the Speed Limit setting. Rent only from those who don't."
"Agreed. To add to that, among cars with the same 0-60 (aka a 5.1 second ICE vs an SR) you’ll actually feel a bigger shove if the driver in the ICE car is sitting at peak power and then punches it."
Fair enough
"A P100D has higher peak acceleration, if only very briefly.

https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2017/2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-first-test-review/"
For under 40k$?
Please name these vehicles.
5.3s is slow
Agreed. ✌🏼
"I'm sure.  I've driven the Dual Motor, but have not tried the SR+. It must be quite a difference in winter driving conditions though to have AWD."
"Whaaa? Seriously, holy shit"
The rock n rollercoaster does 0-60 mph in 3 seconds ... crazy to think that the p100d is up to 0.7 seconds quicker than that.
P100D is more like the top thrill dragster in Ohio. I chickened out of that ride so hard.
I was going to buy a Model 3 AWD LR but they had a P100D and a long road to test drive...
"My 85 RWD makes my roommate nauseous and I'm always telling him how it's ""the slow one"" of the bunch."
"3.2s 0-60 is an average acceleration of about 0.85g.

2.2s 0-60 is an average acceleration of about 1.24g. It’s only “a second” quicker but the acceleration is significantly harder. 

1.9s 0-60 is 1.40g fwiw."
Yes. You need to ready yourself if you don’t want to hurt your neck muscles.
"It's a nice hug that holds you to your seat.  If you aren't ready for it, it will kick you back.  It can rip a cell phone out your heads (passengers) or throw your head back.  It's not harsh imo, but it's strong."
Nah - the 75D is a touch faster. The 3 probably feels faster because size. 3 LR AWD has a 4.5 0-60 - 75D is 4.2 seconds.
I love it lmao.
"Thank you so much for sharing this, I wish I lived next to you so I could go for a launch or two! 😁"
"Yes but I'd like to have the limit on for myself without the limit on acceleration as there are insane penalties for going 50km/h over the limit where I live (instant license suspension, car is seized and a fine of $2,000-$10,000). I just set the chime to 145km/hr (45 over on the highway) and that usually works but in an ideal world I would set the speed limit to 145 and never have to worry about it.

Edit: by comparison the fine for 40-49km/hr over is about $300."
"This has got me wondering.  I've never been in a Tesla, but my wife's new Mustang is faster than 5.1s (I've personally hit 4.57s).  It just doesn't have the off the line torque of an electric motor, but it pulls hard up high.

It's got to be such an alien feeling in a car."
"Mustang GT has a quicker 0-60 (3.9s) and starts at $37k. SR+ does it in 5.3s.

Not saying I like Mustangs, but there are definitely quick ICE cars out there. 

I get the feeling that a lot of Tesla drivers never really drove quick ICE cars. 🤔"
"I believe you said “No ICE”, not “No ICE under $40K”.

Regardless a Mustang GT might not pull quite as hard at the first stab if the throttle, but a ~second in and it will have great surpassed the acceleration of an SR+."
Subaru STI and Mustang GT are just a couple examples that are cheaper than an SR+ and have quicker 0-60’s.
"Nearly every +600cc standard/sport motorcycle (no cruisers) and nearly every single snowmobile have better 0-60 times than 5.9 seconds.

Granted, you hang on to a motorcycle/snowmobile and your not in a full back seat. So your body motion is different, less of a crushing feeling, more of a “rip your arms off” feeling."
"Lol. I knew you didn’t know what you are talking about when you claimed a car with 5 second 0-60 made someone puke, but there are a number of ICE cars that can make the sprint to 60 in less time than half the time of an SR; so feel free to choose one of those. But as far as more modest cars, something like a Mustang GT is going to be as quick if not quicker off the line (and much quicker as it builds RPM) for less money."
It's moderate to fast for a stock muscle car.
"Winter driving definitely helps just the AWD, but I don’t think you would be disappointed by an SR+ (and a good set of winter tires). 

What kind of winter driving conditions are we talking?"
Now imagine a roadster
Must feel like getting launched off an aircraft carrier. Wow.
Honestly its insane. The guy at the dealership said when the battery is warmed up and has a full charge its more like 0-60 in 2.2 sec. the acceleration is unrivaled. I went from a BMW M4 to this and will never look back.
"Sports bike rider vs. Tesla owner checking in, so have been on a 2.7 0-60 and have no idea what any of you are talking about in terms of blackout or feeling ill? What am I missing people?"
That ride broke down wile I was waiting!  So disappointed.
I waited in line for three hours to ride that 17 second ride. 100% worth it.
What is the 0-60 of the 85 RWD?
85 Tesla owner shares a room?
"After owning my Model 3 Performance for 2 weeks, I can safely say I’m not ready to be an astronaut... 🥴"
Fug
"It does not do 2.2s 0-60. Other than Motor Trend with their weird testing methodology that resulted in 2.28s, the fastest anyone else has done with the P100D is about 2.4s."
Jesus.
"That’s how I’d describe the P3D, but by the numbers it’s almost twice the Gs!"
Well look at that. You are right. I thought I looked it up when I had the loaner and it was near 5 seconds.
Whoa where do you live. Here in Australia going 10 over the limit gets you a $300 fine
My motorcycle does 0-60 in 3 seconds.
Maybe because Tesla is a family sedan and mustang gt is a midlife crises car. The ICE equivalents of a Tesla are just slow cars.
"Wow obviously you can buy faster cars. You can buy a Porsche family sedan with similar acceleration, but for that money I can buy a model S p100d with 2.4 seconds and have extra money left."
"*instant torque* not faster acceleration. Also if you think ice are superior to electric motors, I don’t know what you are doing here on Tesla forum."
From the 90s
"Montreal Canada, so like, proper winter driving. Ice, sleet, slush, snow, storms... the works."

>Looking at my half written article - filling back seat with COPV - 140L of nitrogen at about 300bar  \~50 kg. Specific impulse \~50 means to get 1g of acceleration on a 2000kg car is 4kg/sec - 10 seconds of thrust. So, not that unrealistic.

&#x200B;

This means that on top of whatever speed the car is at the end of the 1/4 mile, it can have up to 100 m/s higher speed with the thrusters.  Nominally, a 9 second quarter mile will give you roughly a 135 mph speed at the end (assuming .9 g of constant acceleration, but with thrusters the top speed goes up to 357 mph (575 kph for non-Americans)."

With rockets
An og roadster feels like the start of Mario kart when you get the boost.
Will need some Racer X concoction to stay conscious.  Don’t drink water you fool.
"Based off what I've read online, a p100d would have you experiencing in the neighborhood of 1g of force, while a carrier launch would have you experiencing 3-4g depending on parameters.

Not knocking the Tesla, just putting into perspective how wild carrier launches are."
I seriously cant imagine. Ive driven a P90D and thought that was insane. I would probably make myself sick.
I can‘t understand how. The M4 is such an awesome car.
Your missing a weak stomachs and weak blood circulation
Just that most people have never experienced anything like that.  A sport bike rider is going to feel right at home though...
A fit person might not experience that at all at 1g.  That does not mean that you are unfit if you feel it.  Everyone is different but I think as your fitness level goes up you will feel less lightheadness from it.
"Thank you, as a former motorcycle owner I've experienced sub-3 sec 0-60 with a slight wheel lift and oddly I never felt sick once. I about crapped my pants but never felt nauseated."
I’m struggling to understand this as well. While the speed is astonishing I’ve never felt like backing out or getting sick.... they’re bullshitting or they’re some really weak humans
"I was gonna say, I haven't been in a Tesla yet, but my hayabusa can do sub 2 second 0-60s.  It is pretty intense, but not black out level crazy."
"People are just different. If you can ride a rollercoaster 50 times and feel perfectly fine, then you might be a good astronaut candidate! I would definitely be feeling it after 50 rollercoaster rides"
"On a sports bike out lean forward a lot, in a car you're leaning back. It could actually affect your stomach in such a way that it might cause reflux? I dunno."
Gotta afford payments amirite?
Can't leave all three rooms of my house empty
That car is no joke. I test drove a Performance 3 just to feel the difference from my LR RWD. After three quick 0-60 punches between the stop signs on the ring around the Fremont factory I was done. Shortest test drive of my life. I didn’t even make it out to a real road! 😂😂😂
Just a stronger hug!
It originally was - before it was uncorked.
"Ontario, Canada. It's a surreal system. 50 over is considered street racing and heavily punished, regular speeding is pretty much tolerated. I've gone past cops going 20-30 over (on the highway) and they don't even care about that anymore. Speeding in a school zone is the one thing that seems to be enforced."
"I’m so lucky, it’s $10/mph here in Kansas. 20 mph over is $200."
"Subaru STI is a sedan, starts at $27k and does 0-60s in 4.4.

Don’t get me wrong. Tesla’s are quick, but I stand by my previous statement that a lot of Tesla owners never drove fast ICE cars before. 

- somebody with a P3D+ on order"
I don’t see how that’s relevant to you claiming that ICE vehicles can’t match the torque of a 5.3 second to 60 RWD EV?
/r/gatekeeping
"In that case, I think there is a strong argument for the AWD then. While you can drive a RWD car in the snow with some success (with the proper tires), you will be at a disadvantage to FWD and AWD vehicles (with the same tires) that can direct their propulsion. 

So if you are currently driving an RWD vehicle and doing fine, get the SR+ (the Tesla's weight distribution and precision power control make it among the best RWD sedans in the snow in my opinion); but if you are currently driving an FWD or AWD and don't want to lose capability I'd go for the AWD."
Elon did tweet that he was limiting the roadster’s rate of acceleration to human endurance limits. 😳
"Yep, I can just imagine the horrible smell, the awful loud noise and the chance of blowing up."
"P100D peaks at around 1.4g, according to [Motor Trend.](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-s/2017/2017-tesla-model-s-p100d-first-test-review/)"
"Don’t get me wrong. The M4 is a beautiful machine in its own right. I was very happy and fortunate to experience the M4. I had the M4 for a while. But, after a while you get annoyed with the cluster of buttons on the interior panel, the constant bump and fear of damaging the car with the low profile suspension (especially where I live where it seems like theyre tearing up the road every other week) and filling up gas pretty often.

It wasn’t the loudest car ever but certainly one of the loudest on the streets and it was a head turner or attention grabber. Sometimes good but imo mostly bad. I like to be a little more low key and it seemed like a lot of people disliked the aggressiveness of it haha.

Tesla is AWD and M4 was RWD. For my area and just for everyday comfort, its been so much better.

Not to mention it’s got even more power than the M4 and boy do I feel that difference every time I drive it.

If you can get a Tesla, do it. You won’t regret it.

No gas, comfortable ride, and lots of power.

Obsessed with driving it!"
This is 100% it 😂
Could also be that the way you sit on a motorcycle makes you experience the acceleration differently?
[deleted]
"Well I hate rollercoasters, don't like anything spinny, I just do get the G thing, could it be the passenger has nothing to hold onto?"
"Yeah, my face starts feeling funny in mine. Especially when im trying to show it off to people!"
Ah makes sense.
"Poland, 50 km/h over within city limits and you lose your license."
That's a $25 ticket here in ND. Speeding fines here are [pretty much a joke.](https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/north-dakota-speeding-fines-are-hilarious-257713) [Detailed breakdown.](https://www.drivinglaws.org/resources/traffic-tickets/speed-violations/north-dakota-speeding-laws.htm)
"I've driven a Pontiac G8 GT, a Pontiac Grand Prix GTP, a 69 Camaro SS, various DSMs, etc. 

0-60 times don't fully describe the feeling of accelerating in a Tesla. Yes, there are some cars that can beat the Tesla 0-60 particularly launching, but accelerating linearly from 0-60 without having to shift gears is definitely a unique experience. I found that I was so accustomed to that 1st to 2nd shift (at least) that I wasn't prepared for what I felt my first time gunning it in a Tesla. The 1st to second shift kinda gives your guts a second to recalibrate - haha."
STI starts at at least 10 grand more than that. But yeah.
Sti costs 36
Point still stands. ICEs are slower by nature. You gotta have some trade offs to get that acceleration with an ice.
"I said no ice has instant torque, wich is true. Isn’t it?"
"The issue is that the Dual Motor is 16 000$ more (pricing, incentives). I would much rather have the Dual Motor (range, perf., AWD), but... yeah... 16k."
We need someone in a g-suit to tweet back their disappointment.
That is probably not true unless we are talking about the spacex edition.  It is almost no improvement that can be made over the 1.9 second 0-60 with normal tires and roads.
Link?
Lol that’s hyperbole.
"There should be an exemption to that limit if you can present a ""Medical Fitness for Aviation"" form to prove that you're up for the G's. Maybe a Category 3 should be enough."
Now imagine a space shuttle
"Did anyone measure the g of a M3 AWD?
The lauch-g is a pretty neat spec for parties and family diners."
"Hmmm, fair enough. It really seems like the Tesla is for you then! I just recently drove a P100D in ludicrous mode (or how they call it) and oh yes, it was incredibly fast but it lacked excitement. To me the immediate power delivery felt like a party trick that was fun two or three times. 

What makes it even worse is, where I live, speeding tickets are absolutely extreme. The least thing I need is a car that combines ridiculous speeds with close to zero emotion. This means, if I want to enjoy driving without breaking the law here, I need things like a manual gearbox, RWD and most important: engine noise. But even if speeding laws weren't so strict here, I don't understand the allure of the Tesla. The interior felt alarmingly cheaply made and although it is fast it's such a numb experience to floor it that I have absolutely zero interest to ever feel it again whereas I get goose bumps every morning just from hearing the cold start of my M2. Pure emotion. 

P.S: I have recently closely inspected a Model 3 at my friends car care center. The interior looked better to me and I heard it's very nimble. I should maybe drive one at some point. Unfortunately the paint quality was very bad (hence it being at car care right after delivery) and clearance between doors/lids etc. was probably the worst I have ever seen on any car including old Italian cars etc."
"Oh it’s definitely a very different experience.  But sport bike riders tend to understand how quickly you are going to arrive at that corner up ahead of you stomp on it “right now”, compared to someone who has only experienced a Camry or Prius and is in shock when they’re there like “right now” and need to get on the brakes.

Stuff like that.  The other thing is the quick throttle response.  That reminds me of riding a literbike in a low-ish gear.

But yeah, the bikes accelerate hard enough to start lifting the front wheel if you don’t back off as the power builds.  Teslas aren’t doing wheelies....... yet"
2G's down is not the same as 2G's rearward.  Many people get dizzy from those kind of acceleration levels.  They would not be good pilots.
Yeah and I think its a focus thing too. I know if your passenger is looking at a phone or laptop it can make motion sickness worse.
That's called a smile
Fuck Kansas I’m moving to North Dakota.
"For sure, the acceleration has a distinct unrelenting feel about it. 

For reference, my last car was a Lexus ISF which was 4.3s 0-60. My P3D+ is yet to be delivered but the one I test drove was a LOT of fun, partially because of what described."
That kinda was my point. Thanks for sharing.
"My mistake, you’re right. I think I saw the WRX price. $37k for a sedan going 4.4s 0-60 is pretty decent. Not my cup of tea though."
"Didn’t he just post a faster, cheaper, ICE sedan?"
[deleted]
"My point is that there are ice vehicles that have more torque off of the line. Instant torque is only better if it’s more torque, instantly."
"I completely understand. I find myself in a similar situation with the SR+. While I can certainly afford any of the 3 line up, I have a hard time justifying having a car payment again. 

If you don't me asking, what are you currently driving?"
[The hero we need](https://youtu.be/_YEd6vih1qs)
"The SpaceX package will require AI anyway.

You won't really drive it. You will just give the AI strong suggestions.

It will basically be KIT from Knight Rider, because it has to be. Like advanced fighter jets, it's too unstable of a system for manual control. The AI will be ""pilot in command"".

It's likely the way people who like to drive themselves will be allowed to moving forward once full self driving is a thing.

Interesting possibility is using a distributed market for fast lanes. The more you pay the faster you can go. Everyone gets equal access but if you can sell your average priority for low priority, so someone else can go fast. Or many people go really fast in a race. Street racing could be made legal, since it would be physically impossible to screw up.

Seconded
For someone like you who loved the thrill of the engine and the grind of the gearbox I can understand where the Tesla might seem lackluster. To each their own and I hope you get your dream car to go with it!
I raced sportbikes and so did a good friend of mine. First time he drove my  '04 Lightning he spun it around turning left. It's just different.
"Part of the reason they are so quick is because they don't lift, much.  AWD helps with a lot of that number.  It's just crazy to think that the P100D is doing 0-60 in 2.4s on a staggered 245/265 setup."
I've never experienced this and as a passenger I'm usually glued to entertainment if it's not scenic
"Did you see that car? It looks like a race car that a teenager would buy. As I said, since ICE are inferior too electric motors in terms of acceleration, you will definitely have some trade offs to get to the same acceleration."
"That’s not my point. I’m not talking about best vs best. I’m talking about the technology itself. Also about acceleration. Electric will always beat ice, permitted Someone actually wants to build one that competes in this class. Like the Tesla Roadster. Good luck finding a 1.9 seconds ICE for 200k$."
And my point is that no ICE car can match the instant torque of an EV.
Oh god... a... a... Kia Forte.
"1) What are you smoking?

2) Is there any left?"
what the hell are you on about
"Sounds almost unbelievable. Humans (at least untrained) can withstand up to a 0-60 in 0.5 seconds (5.5G-force) according to this source: https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1998/PhillipAndriyevsky.shtml

Even if it's 0-60 in 1 second as the human endurance limit, that's still unbelievably fast."
"Thanks for that constructive answer! I hope I didn‘t come over as sour. The Teslas started a revolution and the politics are hyping them for, in my opinion, mostly the wrong reasons. I‘m annoyed and maybe a bit scared. But they‘re certainly achieving something!"
I’ve only ever gotten motion sick while working on my laptop in the back seat
"That's very subjective. I thank the STI is a much cooler looking car than the 3 (again, this is very subjective, others will disagree). But if the biggest trade-off you can come up with is that it looks sportier (in a discussion about performance), I think you make a poor argument."
"Lol. You sir, give EV owners a bad reputation. ICE is not inherently inferior to electric motors in terms of acceleration. Both can be very fast."
[deleted]
"Correct, no ICE makes it torque instantly, but that doesn’t matter if an ICE makes make MORE torque instantly (and then continues making more and more)."
"Nothing wrong with that! I'm driving a 2007 Acura TL I paid $5500 for a couple years ago. I've just decided that I value financial independence over having an expensive commuter car. 

Anyway the point of that question was to determine what the difference in winter driving capability would be. Your kia has the advantage of being able to direct its power (and greater weight over the drive wheels), but the SR+ may have an advantage with traction depending on the rear differential configuration. So the SR+ might be better at getting you moving, but I think your Kia would likely be better at keeping you on the road."
"Some humans can.  Some can't.  Everybody's body is different.

For example there's Tom Scott: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMKcO-T5Y4o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMKcO-T5Y4o)"
"I didn’t say that’s the trade off. I don’t own the car nor have I ever seen it, but I’m assuming it’s much less luxurious and it definitely doesn’t look like a family sedan."
"Yes. Both can be very fast. An electric lawnmower won’t beat a v8 engine. Electric is still superior to ICE. The same way horses are inferior too cars. Sure horses can be faster than cars, but cars are just superior technology."
"Well the 918 costs over a million bucks so... you just proved my point again. Simple Electric motors can achieve acceleration an ICE can with a century of engineering and a fuck ton of money, making it the superior technology. Also those are prototype numbers, so not really hypothetical."
It does matter that’s my point. The instant torque is a feeling you can’t get in an ice.
"Well... I had a SE-R Spec V before and the limited slip diff really made a big difference in bad weather. I had a lot of fun driving that thing. But the Kia doesn't. Standard diff setup so I already know winter is gonna be harder to drive in. But hey, my sentra was at 396 000km when I sent her off to pasture (RIPieces). So I needed an interim car. The Kia hit all the right  spots for the budget I had. But I've had my pre-order for the Tesla for two years now. My employer just... well the salaries are shit there. I'm looking to change places (and not just for the salary reason). Alas... I do think I would make the move if I could afford it. Can't quite make it though..."
"Well sure, but I don't think you'll find any sources which say 1 or 2G is the ""human endurance limit"".

Nice link. From that I learnt:

1: Speed - no pedal

2: Acceleration - pedal set to constant position (whether 25%, 50% or full etc.)

3: Jerk - pedal linearly increasing from zero to say, fully depressed (assuming a linear relationship was designed into the Tesla)

4: Snap - pedal position increasing exponentially

We can experience ""snap"" in our Teslas!"
">nor have I ever seen it

I'm afraid I can't give your opinion much merit then. 

We are just going to have to agree to disagree."
"No it doesn’t. A Nissan Leaf has instant torque, but it doesn’t feel  good."
"If getting a Tesla means staying at a job where you aren't happy I wouldn't do it. The main reason I haven't bought one is my wife and I are currently at a point where we can afford to live entirely off of my income. She recently found herself unhappy at her job so I told her to quit. She was able to take a couple months off of work with no pressure to find a job. She took her time and found something she loved (rather than looking for what paid the most).  To me, that freedom is worth more than having a newer car. 

If I were you I would strongly consider holding off and focusing on getting your career to wherever makes you happy. EV's are only going to get better and cheaper as time goes on!"
The Nissan Leaf isn’t an ice???
Words of wisdom. Whole heartedly agree!
Exactly. Proving my point that instant torque alone isn't good. Accessibility to high amount of torque are good (like you can get with a powerful ICE or a moderate EV).
"Instant torque still matters. Maybe a Nissan Leaf still will feel quicker than an similar torque ICE, because of the instant torque. Also you just proved my point. You need a powerful ice to compete against a moderate EV."
Your point was actually that ICE couldn’t compete at all so thanks for proving mine!
"> “No just abrupt transition from ice to ev. No ICE has instant torque.” 

That actually was my point in the first place. ICE cars can compete if they make enough trade offs. The engines alone can’t compete I would say. I don’t know how much an engine costs, but I’m pretty sure you can buy a much better electric motor than an ice for the same money. Of course a bit unfair since you need battery’s and stuff, but overall I would say you have to trade in some stuff to get a quicker ice."
"

>	ICE cars can compete if they make enough trade offs. The engines alone can’t compete I would say. 

If by trade off you mean they literally just put a more powerful engine in I guess?


>	better electric motor than an ice for the same money.

Maybe, but unfortunately the motor is only half of an ice drivetrain. The battery is the expensive/heavy part

>	overall I would say you have to trade in some stuff to get a quicker ice.

You might have a point if multiple people hadn’t shown faster, cheaper ICE vehicles."
"The vehicle shown was less luxurious and smaller. Exactly what I would describe as a trade off. Tesla’s just happen to be fast because they are electric, not because some company tried really hard making it that fast."
That's one thoughtful company.
Next thing op knows entire neighborhood is at their house bcz they have power
Mine just kicked in too.
Stay safe brothers
"If you have solar,  can you only precharge your batteries via solar or the grid in anticipation of a storm. It seems that storm mode is not something a user can initiate only Tesla, but once they do, the batteries can be replenished from the grid, as solar could take one or more full days depending on solar system size. Sorry just another curious Floridian who is seriously looking at adding these before hurricane season 20, it’s too late for 19 haha."
"FYI for people that aren't aware, Storm Watch is a user-configurable setting. I've seen people complain previously in similar posts about Tesla being able to ""force"" you to pay for grid power that you otherwise wouldn't have used. You can't manually enable grid charging at any time you want, but the ability for Tesla to do this is a user setting.

https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/powerwall/mobile-app/additional-modes"
Is Orion a reference to the show Chuck?!
Tesla is fuckin sick man. Stay safe.
"OP, I'm curious. Can you configure a Powerwall to automatically have a connected Tesla vehicle stop charging when the grid goes down?"
3 days in advance?
Ok. That’s cool as fuck.
"Tesla is looking a LOT like Apple. 

Tesla Solar panels charge your Tesla Powerwall (which was installed by Tesla), which powers your Tesla car, which is insured by Tesla. When away from home you charge your Tesla at a Tesla Supercharger."
Activated here
I wonder once powerwalls become more common if this kind of thing could shut down a power grid? All these powerwalls suddenly drawing massive amounts of power from the grid all at the same time by command from Tesla's storm watch. As they're batteries they can cycle to full load much faster than coal-fired and natural gas fired power plants can spool up.
This is pretty awesome.
"Shame the ~80kWh cars themselves still can't be used as a whole house ""UPS""."
"Ok, that's fucking awesome."
How big of a hit is that on your electric bill?
"How long do the battery packs last? What's their average lifetime? I mean if this things is plugged to the house so it's continuously charging, right?"
Take care OP
All I wanna say is I like how you have organized your phone I do that same thing!
I remember when they [extended the range of Tesla cars during the evacuation of Hurricane Irma](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/10/16283330/tesla-hurricane-irma-update-florida-extend-range-model-s-x-60-60d).

"It is cool that Tesla is doing that, but can users initiate that by themselves? E.g. it might not be the storm, but you might know that you will have power outage for some other reason."
Can someone explain this to me?  I have no idea what is happening here
"Fuck man, I wish Elon musk ran all automotive companies."
It's an interesting demonstration of how much smarter the grid could be with decentralized storage.
"I got one of these notifications on my phone too, except I don't own anything Tesla or have any Tesla related apps..."
"I was wondering if this is possible, seeing that it is automatic is awesome."
Is this something that triggers without user direction?
"Wow, so thoughtful. I can't wait to get one. :)"
Someone from r/all here... what's a powerwall?
Don’t know why other companies haven’t transitioned to something like this.
Just ask their workers.
Being able to hang out with your neighbors and let them charge their phones and rechargeable flashlights sounds like a good community to me.
"My batteries bring all the boys to the yard and they're like, thanks for the charge"
"“It be nice if we could all hangout without a storm, right?”

“Naw Timmy, I’m good”"
That's pretty much what it's like when you have a generator.

"For those who think it's kind of shitty that Tesla doesn't let you, the user, choose whether to use utility power to charge a powerwall (if you have solar), that's a legal thing. You can't claim the tax credit unless the powerwall (normally) is only able to charge from solar."
"At least the wait for a PowerWall is less now. Backup generators are cheap, but not exactly green."
It’s not too late I can get that done for you in less then 8 weeks
"Well, the user can decide whether or not they want the ""storm watch"" feature ([see this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cxpbps/-/eymux9v))"
I am wondering this too. What about smaller countries? Will Tesla really keep up and activate this anywhere on earth there is a major storm? Being able to activate this yourself in case of an emergency would be great.
great info. thanks
My thought as well. Great show.
Reference to me.
Or maybe the Aurora-class Lantean battleship from Stargate Atlantis?
"When you get powerwalls installed, they install a second electric panel. Only the breakers on the second electric panel will be backed up when the power goes out. So you could just not put your EV charger on the backed up panel."
Better too early than too late.
"Except you’re perfectly able to use a different companies solar panels, a different insurer, and charge from a public charging station.
People can choose Tesla-everything if they want to, but they don’t have to."
Costumers getting tied into ecosystems created by corporations is a solid business model. Smart move by Tesla.
"Except I don’t mind being tied into an ecosystem so long as it all works correctly and makes me a happy customer. 

Love Tesla and I really don’t mind how they have a system that doesn’t rely on outside entities so long as I always have the option to use said outside entities at any time. 

Tesla pretty much has that going. I can use different solar with my power wall, I can use different insurance if it’s a better rate, etc..."
"That’s good, as much as people hate on Apple and Tesla, if you can afford into the ecosystem it’s very nice to seamlessly integrate the devices into your life. I’m pretty far off from anything Tesla in the next 5 years, but hopefully one day Tesla and Apple partner together so every single thing I own is one system lol. Maybe even Tesla houses and Apple water."
It's called horizontal integration. Apple did not invent this. ;)
"I don't think it's because of the apple motives though, apple motives was more money to the company while tesla's motives are just that gosh the current system sucks and we can make it so much better, solar systems suck, let's make it better, insurance sucks.. Made better.. And so on"
"Except Tesla/Elon doesn't mandate it be Tesla equipment.  They just want you to be green.

Apple on the other hand actively seeks to be anticompetitive toward interoperability.

Proprietary charging, no other app stores, etc"
"Erm, my 2 Powerwalls drew about 6.7 kW for 2 hours to charge. That's like...running the AC. We aren't talking anything crazy here."
"It likely staggers the start time across installs. The Tesla car wall connector does this - if there's an outage, when the power is restored, it will intentionally wait a random number of seconds (up to 5 minutes I believe) before restarting. That way, all car chargers don't kick on at the same time and slam the grid."
"As these become more common, the ability for things like these (or other high-draw devices, like AC) will be able to communicate with the grid and negotiate their draw with the provider. If the powerwalls are drawing too much in an area, they'll be able to limit their draw during the day, when demand is high, and then switch to full power draw at night. Eventually, as the electric fleet gets larger, power utilities will have the ability to leverage the electric cars attached to the grid as utility-scale power storage to smooth out any shortcomings on the production side. So, in short, no; it shouldn't overwhelm the grid once they become more widespread."

"You'd have idiots integrating them into homebrew systems that used them daily, then later ranting online that their Telsa battery sucks because it's failing at 40,000 miles."
"A single powerwall stores about 14kWh of energy. If you charge it to full from 0, that's $1.68 for a full charge per powerwall, at the national average electric rate of $0.12/kWh.

Edit: punctuation and math"
"Not really any, since you’ll end up using the power eventually."
"Each PW2 holds 13.5 kWh, how long that lasts depends on usage. You can buy up to 10 of them.

[The warranty is 10 years @ 70% capacity](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/powerwall/powerwall_2_ac_warranty_us_1-4.pdf). My best guess on lifetime is 10-15 years, as the inverter inside them is likely to break before the cells die and that is a typical inverter lifetime. You could still salvage the cells though and use them for an ebike or something.

There are 2 ways you can buy a PW2, with the federal tax credit, or without.

If you buy it with the credit, your PW2 can only charge from the solar panels, except when storm watch is active, which is triggered by Tesla, who bases their decisions off of the national weather service. If NWS issue a severe storm alert for your area, tesla enables storm watch.

If you buy it without the credit (or you live somewhere other than the US) you can charge from the grid whenever you want, the obvious downside being that you no longer get a 30% discount."
"Battery life is usually dependant on charge/discharge cycles... and time.

And no, it's not ""constantly charging"" if it's plugged in. If smartphone manufactures can figure out to stop charging a battery when it's full, do you think telsa products lack a charge control system or something?"
">The whole neighbourhood is going to be wondering why that one house is still on.

Sounds useful and like good marketing."
"It doesn’t work like that. When you’re wealthy you’re more worried because you’ve got a lot to lose. But when you’re not, you also have got less to lose."
Good bot
"Storm Watch will let the batteries charge from the grid, which you can't do as far as I'm aware outside of storm watch. But in normal operation, you can specify a minimum charge % to reserve for power outages. For example, the batteries charge from solar during the day, I get home and use about 70% of the energy stored, and then 30% is saved, and the house starts to pull from the grid for power rather than from the Powerwalls, which remain in standby.

So typically, your Powerwalls will be charging through the day via solar."
Batteries will be fully charged before the power goes out and you need them
Tesla recognizes that the storm is coming and activates it on their end. It'll alert on your phone app that it's activated.
"It’s a big battery for a car that I believe is built into the wall of someone’s home, likely in their garage. Also I guess it could be used to power other things, like charge a phone, my best guess"
"It's a battery that is typically wired into a house's circuit and either just the city utility supply or some alternate supply as well i.e. solar or wind, and stores energy to be used at a later date/time.

"Mostly because Elon comes from a software background, and so his thinking in all his company's starts with the assumption of fast 
flexable software driven outcomes. While other company's really have a manufacturing and engineering culture which usual puts software driven outcomes as a back seat.

"I see. I'll want at least the ability to use pretty much everything during an outage, but the pool equipment, washer/dryer, water heater, and EV charger could stay on the non-powerwall panel, I guess.

How does a powerwall system work during the day? Does stuff on the non-powerwall panel get power from solar during the day? Or does the solar go directly into the powerwall and only power what's on its panel? I'd still like the ability to run the water heater and EV charger during the day, if possible."

"that was my thought. I wouldn't want to put many charge/discharge cycles on my Tesla. which does bring up a good point: as time goes on, miles on a Tesla might matter less to resale than charge history."
a odometer for battery cycles might be warranted.
"> A single powerwall stores about 14kWh of energy.

In case people need some additional context for that...

The average US household uses about 28 kWh per day.

The *lowest* capacity vehicle battery pack that Tesla has ever produced was still almost 3x that at 40 kWh (although it was actually a software-limited 60 kWh battery pack)."
Warranty is 80% in U.K. and most of Europe.
"There has been research going on which proposes to recycle used battery packs from electric cars (and powerwalls, presumably) into large-scale power storage for electric grids. In that usage, the reduced capacity doesn't make a huge difference because they're already installing them in large numbers, and the cost benefit of using used batteries is better in the long run because used ones are so much cheaper, that needing a ~30% larger installation is outweighed by the cost savings. Unlike in a car, having the largest capacity in the smallest possible package isn't the priority; getting the largest capacity for the lowest price is. These cells can then have a ""second life"" in these installations and be used until their capacity drops down to 20-30% of their original rated capacity. The batteries can then be actually recycled by breaking them down and reusing their materials in the manufacture of new cells."
Thxs
"I think there's an opportunity to extend the ""Storm watch"" feature onto their Tesla vehicles as well. If enabled, the car could override existing charge limit and allow the battery be fully charged to 100%. 

Additionally, ""Storm watch"" could open the option where the car would shut down all non-essentials (radar, ultrasonic sensors, cameras, autopilot unit...) and focus on achieving maximum range. Essentially making the cars as dumb as possible while still being drivable."
That's the best explanation I've seen. Thank you.
"Microsoft had a huge part in that as well. Nokia could have just pushed out stock Android and become an amazing device to Android purists, in a similar boat to the Pixels and some of those Chinese branded phones. But then Microsoft came in, offered a deal (and eventually bought Nokia) to make their flagship phones and... Microsoft, a software company, dropped the ball hard in the beginning. By the time the OS because genuinely amazing (Windows Phone 10), it was simply too late. Major companies like Snapchat and.. I think it was Instagram? refused to make compatible apps, even with the conversion software Microsoft was offering to devs. At one point Microsoft had a plan for a universal app market, which was basically like an emulator for the other app stores. Unfortunately it got canceled for some reason (I'm assuming partially legal?) and the last hope for the platform died.

It's a real shame, too. Nokia made amazing hardware, even in the budget range. Their cameras were superb, especially, and the durability was amazing. Plus, I don't think under the WP branding they ever released a model that didn't have big cult favorites like a removable battery and headphone jack."
software engineers are not really engineers.... got it!

"I looked into the LG solar battery that competes with Tesla Powerwall.

They can only have one LG battery pack. Whereas Tesla Powerwall can daisychain 2 or more together.

So with LG I would have to pick which circuits in the house have backup. LG cannot run the entire house.

With 2 Powerwalls, we can run the entire house, including AC in Florida.

So we are going with the Tesla Powerwall system. It gets installed in October."
"It’s not greed. It’s corporate red tape bullshit keeping engineers from implementing cool features.

The industry giants have become so bogged down by “approval chains” that innovation is disincentivised for the every day employee who already has tough timelines to meet and doesn’t want to deal with bullshit."
What greed is there to be had in not implementing a feature like this? It's not like it costs Tesla anything.

That's what this thread is showing. Storm Watch is charging the Powerwall from the grid to prepare for a severe storm likely to take out grid power.

I imagine you can.
unfortunately no we’ve got teams working around the clock through Sunday night and then stand down till next Friday but if you want in the queue speak up soon.
I’m really not here to solicit for business or advertise i come to reddit to help people wade through the concepts of solar but please feel free to DM me. We white label for all the large operations and all the finance platforms.
"Tesla installs an Amp sensor on your existing panel and if it detects the non backed up things pulling power, it will discharge from the powerwall to match it. So when the grid is up, it basically acts like everything is backed up to PW/solar. It has 3 different modes though, depending on usecase. backup only, self powered mode, and time based. back up only is self explanatory, but the other 2 are pretty smart. both have a reserve % you can set so that you always have a bit left for blackouts, and when they are active (all the time & peak hours, respectively) they will keep you pulling from the grid.

If you were in a blackout situation, there is no way to power the unbacked up things. If it were me, I'd just put it all on to backup and then flip the breakers during an outage if you don't want the water heater/pool pump/etc running."
I'm not so sure about that..

"By the time MS and Nokia hooked up it was already too late. Software was also only one of the issues, the other was that the Chinese were coming with their super cheap phones that were good enough to eat the entire low end of the market that Nokia lived in."
"I think the displines are closer together further apart.   Just the lifecycle and after-creation interaction with their finished “product” is evolving much beyond traditional engineering outcomes.  The cost of maintenance has dropped significantly too.  

Compare updating a bridge with updating a phone. Similar discipline skills, such as observation and measurement, testing.  One takes months and thousands of man hours, per bridge, the other takes seconds and is being done almost continuously by millions of phones.

Like other engineering, software  “product” is bounded by hardware constraints.  Unlike other eng. their “product” can also be infinitely malleable within that constraint.  They push on those hard boundaries enable future flexibility e.g.  OTA updates by adding radios for cell and wifi, or sensors such as cameras to become more aware of their environment. 

This evolution is pushing efficiency back into traditional eng. e.g integrating remote sensors into our bridges."
As an 18 year software engineer veteran: if we built bridges and buildings the way we build software we’d all be dead.
"Not really, no. Professional engineers generally need some sort of professional association accredation and deal with something physical as their end product. Everything they do is very deterministic, this pipe can handle this flow, this chemical reacts this way, etc. Software is much more of a combination of art, writing, and logic, and it's almost all highly abstracted. Aside from the people who do really low level hardware drivers, the term ""software engineer"" has always been a misnomer."
"It's not about Elon being on the tools, it's about taking a lean approach to getting outcomes and then iterating on it to make it great. This is what you learn from building software startups. It's how nearly all modern software is created, and now it's being applied to cars, which is unique and hard for old slow manufacturing company's to adopt."
"I assume they are able to be put into series.  When you add batteries in series it just adds capacity.  It doesn't affect voltages or anything to the system.  Now whether there are proprietary monitoring apps, or connections that make this not possible I don't know."
Software engineering isn't exactly cheap.
Exactly. It’s the greed of other manufacturers and companies to cut corners everywhere to desperately make as much money as possible.

In Florida? The company Tesla referred us to for 100kw solar + 10 powerwalls said next June at earliest.
"> If it were me, I'd just put it all on to backup and then flip the breakers during an outage if you don't want the water heater/pool pump/etc running.

This is what I figure I'll do. Just connect everything to the Powerwall system and turn off stuff I don't need to use to save power."
Phones having 3.5mm port in no way hinders Bluetooth connection. You could and still can have your headphones. But the people who bought some seriously good headphones got screwed.
"Horizontal integration means one company owns most of a specific step in the supply chain.  This is usually bad for consumers because it lets them exercise monopoly power.  Vertical means one company manages many steps in its own supply chain, like for example making their own batteries to put in cars which they sell in their own stores and then install their own chargers for.  This is generally not so bad for consumers because they get a more streamlined experience but still have plenty of choice (but can sometimes feel 'stuck' in an ecosystem and less likely to exercise that choice).  So Tesla is much more vertically integrated than horizontally integrated, unless they start buying up other battery suppliers and supplying other companies with battery cells, or same with solar, etc."

Florida is unique in it's AC draws. In Michigan heavy AC use midsummer regularly causes brownouts
It's also likely that your utility has a program where people get compensated for allowing them to throttle their A/C under load to avoid issues.
Oh definitely. The daily use case for a battery like the Powerwall is to power the home through the night when solar obviously doesn't work.
"TV would still be used for communication of emergencies, etc. But that's ok, because modern TVs don't draw that much power, as compared to old-style CRTs."

> **How much electricity does an American home use?**

> In 2017, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,399 kilowatthours (kWh), an average of 867 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual electricity consumption at 14,242 kWh per residential customer, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,074 kWh per residential customer.

> https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3

867 kWh per month comes to 28.9kWh over 30 days.

Not sure how it breaks down exactly. But Air Con definitely uses a lot of electricity. Here's what we use in southern AZ. 3 person household, one person working from home most of the time, one working nights, 2,200 sq ft, single story facing east/west with a pool. I mention the pool specifically because pool pumps use a lot of electricity as well. I mention all this specifically because many people can adjust their temps to be higher during the day when no one's at home, but we have someone here almost 24 hours a day. We have dual cooling, both A/C and an evaporative cooler. The cooler uses a lot less power since it's just running a small water pump and fan, but they are basically useless above about 10-15% relative humidity. We also have a gas stove and water heater, so those aren't part of our usage.

I'll use last month's period for a data example. Average high temp this year was 99F and low was 77F, in 2018 it was 103F and 77F respectively. Relative humidity was 44% for 2019 and 43% for 2018. 2019 usage was 3,475 kWh including the Model 3 LR with a long commute using 90% capacity one day each week (~67kWh for the alone). Last year before we got the Model 3 usage for the same period was 3,266kWh, so actually our home usage has gone *down* when you account for both the car's charging and the lower average high temp this year for the same period.

So we're at about 115kWh per day including the A/C, pool, and everything else. As shown above, the average humidity is 43-44% both years, so the cooler isn't really an option.

I'm trying to find average usage for my area specifically to compare, but haven't found it yet."

But r&d budgets are always through the roof. No excuse. It’s damn near 2020.

That makes absolutely no sense. One cuts corners in order to get costs down. This feature literally costs Tesla nothing. There are no corners to cut.

"Thank you very much for the detailed response.

Swimming pools are also a good point (we don't have one).

Basically for us it's mostly a few LED lights and charging some devices like laptop/phone/tablet. TV usage is nearly zero since online content is way more interesting.

That basically leaves the occasional water cooker, the refrigerator/fridge (both fairly new and very efficient) and a modem/router/Raspberry Pi.

Anything not in use (TV, audio equipment, you name it) is really turned of via power strips with a switch. Basically no standby/phantom power use in the house."
"Most of the time in software it's about the alternative cost of not doing something else. Of course, the marketing gains from action like this one might be way bigger."
"Well software development is not free. If they have an automatic system in place there is no Labor hours in this if there isn't someone has to select the state or region where the storm/emergency is.
Either way it will cost the company.

So let the customer decide on his own if he wants power in an emergency... It will save the company money.

But this is probably the best money spent for word of mouth advertising there is. So good for Tesla."
">This feature literally costs Tesla nothing. There are no corners to cut.

You would be surprised how many companies see this as a liability. I can't even count the number of times I have to tell my engineering team to omit a feature  or legal says this might be a liability or company doesn't want to waste resources supporting  a feature after rollout."
Sounds like labor day to me
I'll ask hurricane to only cut power and don't destroy anything
"There was a proposal for a 13 month calender floating around for a while, what you explained is how they handled New Years day and leap year.

"Wasn’t planning on adding more panels. I only have a 3kwh system and with two Tesla’s it only provides 25% of my electricity. I want to add another row, but I think backup power is where I will add first."
"That answers my question I just asked..

How soon can you install 100kw solar + 10-12 powerwalls? The company Tesla referred us to said next June at earliest. We have regulatory issues that might shut is down by May, it'd make no sense to pay $100k deposit for an install that never happens and not even a tax credit to show for it"
Yes he said it’s for a business
Yes its for a business. I can't fit 100kw on my house :)
"Well, that's a slight shame. I do have one Powerwall on the way (someday...), and I guess I'll have to decide what's important enough to me to be powered by it.

Edit: Did some research on the Tesla site, and it looks like I won't be able to have my A/C or wall connector on the Powerwall. Oh well. *Maybe* I could get away with using the upstairs unit, but it's not the end of the world if I can't. After all, I can't use it during an outage *now*, and I can at least use fans.

As for charging the Tesla during an outage, I'm sure I could make do with just charging off 120V using the mobile connector.

If you have a Powerwall that doesn't power your whole house, can you tell me whether the power usage statistics shown in the app also include stuff that isn't on the Powerwall's sub-panel?"
"> If they have an automatic system in place there is no Labor hours in this 

The support page heavily implies that they do:

> Powerwall communicates with the National Weather Service to know  when  severe weather is on the horizon and automatically triggers Storm Watch. 

I'm well aware that software development isn't free, but a feature like this doesn't exactly strike me as super expensive to build out.

I'm not saying that this isn't a nice feature. All I'm saying is that I disagree that other companies don't have it due to ""greed"".

O/T rant: I'm pretty tired of seeming people accuse companies of being ""greedy"". That's quite literally the point of being a for-profit company: to make as much money as possible."

"As far as your system size, it’s sort of inadequate as it stands for powerwalls. Ideally we’d like to connect one battery per 6kw if solar so that you get the most bang for your buck if you will. Rationale being that it should fill the tank in 3 hours or less and still provide power to your home  on a daily basis. If you’re just wanting backup power however I do understand that. I’d need to know more about your specific situation to pinpoint the best protocol. Feel free to DM me"
unfortunately the only way they can be part of the tax credit is when coupled with a solar installation at the same time
we should talk directly.  Well before May possibly by December but that’s a very large project with a level of complexity beyond a public forum. DM me a contact and I’ll reach out.
"Not sure why you can't, my AC is on it. But in an outage you probably don't want to use AC anyhow. With AC running my powerwall gets drained by like 9pm (often 100+ degreees here and we like it chilly). When we're out of town/state and the Nest lets it get hot inside, the powerwall has a 50/50 shot of making it to the next solar production.

They installed two subpanels, one of which is backed up. The app tracks usage on both. The installers that later hooked up my HPWC put it on the main panel, and its not tracked by the app."
"I completely agree with you that greed is not what makes other companies fail at doing this kind of thing.


But I completely disagree with this statement: 

> That's quite literally the point of being a for-profit company: to make as much money as possible.

That's not true at all, and it's a statement I see too often. Yes, a for-profit company needs to make money to stay afloat. But just like a human needs to eat to stay alive. That doesn't mean the point of a human is to eat as much as possible. The same with a company.

The point of a company is whatever the owners make it to be. Perhaps most companies have as their main or even only point to make as much money as possible. But even in that case that doesn't make it ""quite literally the point of a for-profit company"".


Heck, we're in a subreddit of a for profit company that is built under the premise of having a different point than that. Sure they need money for it, but they claim ( and it looks like) they have a different point. And coincidentally they've failed to make a profit up to this point."
Doesn't seem like they're going to understand what your wasting effort trying to explain lol
Is there still a huge backlog of powerwall orders?
Wording on their website says can get credit if installed with solar or installed after solar has already been installed first. Just can't do battery before solar from what I'm seeing here: https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/powerwall/learn/incentives
"Sorry its actually 110kw + 14 pw, but DM sent. Since this is more generalized information that others might find value in: 

I know any roof repairs that are required for solar install can get rolled into the cost of install for tax credit purposes. We do need to replace all the bolts because they're rusty and not sealed, and there's one minor leak already. Say there is storm damage and/or we spring some more leaks next week and need immediate repairs. Can that repair all be rolled into the cost and subbed out ASAP even if the actual install might come months later?

Also, for anybody with a commercial building: commercial installs get the accelerated depreciation too! So you get the 30% IPV plus 100% depreciation of the system in the first year, which works much like that Model X loophole people were exploiting last year! Basically a bonus 25% credit."
"I probably should have said ""publicly-traded for-profit companies"".

>Heck, we're in a subreddit of a for profit company that is built under the premise of having a different point than that. Sure they need money for it, but they claim ( and it looks like) they have a different point. And coincidentally they've failed to make a profit up to this point. 

Sure, the stated premise of Tesla isn't to make money, but Tesla is publicly-traded, so they are obligated to do so. The only reason Tesla hasn't made any profit yet is because they're busy investing in stuff that will enable *future* profit."
My above the board answer here is that storm damage should be an insurance claim. You are right depreciation is a beautiful thing and really the deciding factor for most commercial systems.
"Absolutely, and that is what I meant. 
Yeah, they are obligated to make money, just like you and I are obligated to eat. The point I want to make across is: the fact that they are obligated to make money to exist, doesn't mean that their only/more important point is to make as much money as possible.

The nuance is in the difference between ""I have to make money to exist"" and ""I have to make as much money as possible"""
Publicly-traded companies *are* obligated to maximize profits.

Im willing to bet that the person at the pump next to them was taking up too much room so backing in was a clever solution to filling up instead of waiting for someone to move. But I understand the concept.

Wawa is where you hold the door for the person going in and crash them in the lot
Is that a platelet fueling that car?
I agree.  This makes the most sense for charging.  They have bathrooms 24/7 and snacks.  When I go on vacation I drive over night to my destination and having those services would be amazing.
In Texas we have Buc-ee’s. And that’s where we need Superchargers. BEAVER NUGGETS
Honestly I think every gas station should get at least one or two super chargers or other charging infrastructure.  Wawa seems to have its eye on the long game and it’s amazing!
"I stopped at the Wawa in Riviera Beach last week for my 30 min break and at least 10 Tesla’s came through while I was there. 

https://imgur.com/a/tclV9tN

I live in Orlando however and only 1 Wawa here has them."
"For anyone like me who didn't know what a Wawa was:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawa_(company)"
"As long as those spaces are tucked away...wawa parking lots can get crowded fast, and with the most inconsiderate drivers I have ever seen..."
Have worked for Wawa for 2 years. Can confirm they're making big steps to have more chargers at the stores. Believe mines getting one within the year.
"This appears to be a common phenomenon among Tesla owners, I saw others write about this quite a few times already."
"Did this with a work vehicle. On my first week on the job.

That was a fun one to explain."
How new was the rental? Surprised it didn't use the horn to warn you.
I still rarely get in the car with my keys in hand near where the ignition switch used to be.
The comfiest of charging experience!
"I mean, where else would you plug in the charger..?"
🤣
"Same here. I kept staring at this for ages, couldn't figure it out... Had to come to the comments."
Because you almost always back into superchargers
sane
I’m a Tesla driver and didn’t get it
"I haven't been back in an ICE (at all) since getting my M3P in the middle of last month. Not looking forward to it, either."
Just look at the picture. Does not seem that way whatsoever. There's ample room
Oh you sweet summer child...
What the hell?
I will eat a sizzli in your honor.
Yet another reason California sucks.
😜
"I thought they were a SouthEast thing. I’m in Boston and when I drive south, I start seeing them in Pennsylvania"
Looking closely makes me think she's wearing flip-flops.
It looks like she's wearing olive sandals.
Sandals.  You can see the strap.  Not that it’s any protection if something happens but at least her skin is out of the gunk buildup on the concrete
"You usually pull up parallel to the gas pump (you have to know which side the gas cap is on). She backed into the gas pump tail first, which is how electric car recharging stations are configured. (This could also be a pretty innovative way of getting to the gas pump when you're not sure which side your gas cap is on.)"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawa_(company)
"Telsa do have an auto-park functionality, but the limitations are such that I suspect it is rarely, if ever, used for backing in to a Supercharger spot. Certainly I've never done it."
ANONE ANONE
The amount of parking lots or dark corners I’ve had to take a leak in while charging is annoying! Get us bathrooms at these things please!
It blows my mind that more gas stations aren't jumping to install chargers. You get people who need to kill time and are more likely to buy snacks or something because they can't just stop for 5 minutes where they need to attend the pump.
"I don’t see why gas stations are not afraid of the impending change.  It’s like climate change: slow but unstoppable.  It is about to happen and they must see that.  Now I can see every rest area on a highway having a supercharger, it’s the same use case as for gasoline powered cars. And I can see a new use case at shopping centers (Costco!?), restaurants, parking garages, and places of work where you’re going to be a while and would like to top off.

However I don’t see a use case for all those small local gas stations to even exist anymore.  Maybe someone at WaWa is forward looking enough to see the upcoming gas station apocalypse.  It may not be soon, but it’s unavoidable.  I would expect most local charging to be done at home or places you spend more time: why would you go out of your way to sit and wait at a gas station, and get junk food?  How much of a charge can you get while you run in to get lottery tickets or cigarettes?  Maybe some current owners can chime in here, but it seems like you’d need only a tiny percentage if not 0 *local* gas stations."
I wish more of the Superchargers around here had that kind of facility right there. They would get a lot of my money.
"Hi , I go there all the time for lunch when I am home. Yeah, usually the hood rats just clog up the spots with their hoopties..😡"
"That's so odd. I've actually charged at the Wawa on Sand Lake Boulevard, I never even knew about Riviera Beach and I'm in Delray."
I am actually not too thrilled with that one. I prefer stopping in Melbourne and Port St. Lucy over the Riviera Wawa.
"Wawa, Sheetz, and Buc-ees are the best travel stops in America. They all need to expand, we don't have any of them here."
"Its an addiction. I think the wikipedia page missed that.

Nothing quite like driving to work with a sizzli on the passenger seat and a cappuccino in the cup holder."
"Hell, the only reason I still remember to remove the hand brake is because of the past trauma of forgetting and doing damage to the car, but otherwise I would have forgotten to do that as well.

The whole reason for daily routines is to not have to think about mundane stuff like that, so it's easy to stick to your usual routine and not adjust it to your new situation. I don't even remember most of my daily commute seconds after doing it..."
Why would it? I’ve never seen a car that honks when you get out while it’s running. That would be insane.
New enough to have a key fob and a push button start. So I also had the opportunity to forget the key fob in the car.
"Oh, right. Thanks!"
"Ah thanks, didn't see that.

I thought the joke was the person had to get an ICE rental car and so that was like ""wa ... waa""."
Your Model S range is too dam high!
Cause you back in perpendicular to a super charger. ;)
The other person could have left...
It’s not like it’s a state where Tesla is from or anything.
"From Wikipedia: 

> WaWa, Inc. is an American chain of convenience stores and gas stations located along the East Coast of the United States, operating in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Florida

Huh, I guess I usually get through New Jersey and Delaware without stopping, plus what happened to the Carolinas?"
Mid-Atlantic thing.  +Orlando
Just look at which direction the little arrow by the gas meter is pointing
Interesting. Never heard of them in Colorado.
What’s he saying is that a surprisingly higher percentage of drivers on the road than you think are completely incapable of backing any vehicle into a parking spot. You would legitimately be surprised how bad such a large percentage of drivers are at anything other than driving forward in a straight line.
"Yeah that is why i am super in favor of this partnership.  WAWA just adds a bit of parking for Tesla and Tesla pays the power bill.  WAWA gets customers for food which is the money maker.  They are also hedged for when the oil downturn comes one day in the distant future.  This is a win win win for all including the customer.  


I will say they should make all the WAWA units V3 so it replicates a typical fuel stop as much as possible it still more time than a fuel stop so you still get customer to buy drinks and coffee but the units can cycle more customers through.  If i was WAWA that would be on my demand list for phase 2 roll out."
"The worst was the one in some remote town of like 5 people. I remember it being icy and slushy so I couldn't see, but I stepped in human shit right behind my car."
Pilot trucking comes to mind they have the free tarmac space at almost every center and they are on the highway and out in the middle of absolute no where.  They could invite both companies to install chargers.  They just frankly do not see it as a viable mode of transit.  They see it as a niche thing. They just don’t care gas makes them all the money why change.  Tesla with the mega chargers needs to partner with pilot and ta and yeah as a free aside install normal v3 super charger 2 or 4 stall banks.
They are doing this in Europe. It’s brilliant. My local gas station has ionity chargers and recently built an area designated for people charging.
A few Shell stations in my area has Blink and ChargePoint. None are Tesla though. Which sucks because these take a long long time.
"Most gas stations don’t actually make much profit on gas, but instead on they stuff in the attached convenience store, so adding EV charging would make sense."
"For most gas stations I'd agree with you. However Wawa was in business for 20-30 years before it ever sold a gallon of gas. They started as a dairy barn and today make a killing on coffee. They absolutely *LOVE* when people stop in their parking lot for 15 minutes for any reason whether it be gas, free air compressor for your tires, a windshield squeegee, etc.

As long as no one goes and bans coffee on the eastern seaboard then Wawa will be around and adapt."
"1-2 pump stations don’t need it.  Anything that gets any amount of traffic does though, regardless of whether they’re local or highway. They don’t need to be superchargers - they can be ChargePoint stations for all I care as long as there’s a way to get EVs fueled up while they’re stopped there."
"> I don’t see why gas stations are not afraid of the impending change.

The change isn't ""impending"" with EVs being a fraction of a fraction of 1% of the cars on the road. Even if every new car sold starting tomorrow were an EV, it'd be over a decade before most of the current fleet of cars gets turned over and there isn't much business for gas stations any more. But that's not happening tomorrow. In reality with the growth rate of EVs, even if it goes ""exponential"", it'll be decades before small gas stations need to worry about declining traffic.

There's no reason for them too be afraid of that either. They're just franchises earning a couple tens of thousands a year from an easily managed piece of property. When it becomes obvious that the business is in decline, people will stop building *new* gas stations, and the existing ones will long have paid off the initial development costs. Nobody's going to lose any money on their gas station investments. If in 20, 30, 40 years there isn't enough business any more, they sell the nice corner property on a busy intersection and it'll be repurposed into a new CVS or something, while the former gas station owner reinvests in something else."
Right off 95 and Blue Heron. Very big location with lots of space. The chargers are behind the store.
Gee why would u want to avoid Rivera?😂
I quite liked Stewart's when I was stationed in upstate NY.
"Royal Farms is another that's at Wawa and Sheets scale and size but they only have a presence in the North East.   Their lots and number of gas pumps are Wawa sized. Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, prob others as you continue northward."
"Most cars with keyless ignition or proximity keys will beep or honk at you if you get out with it running.

I know my Mazda will beep (not with the horn, it’s got it’s own speaker thing) 5 or so times in rapid succession if you exit the car and shut the driver’s side door with it still running.

Cars without the keyless stuff *generally* don’t because it’s harder to forget the key in the ignition when you need the key to lock the car."
"Every new intelligent-access Ford I've driven does. Put it in Park, don't shut it off, and step out with the key in your pocket. It will honk twice. Already verified this on the Fusion, Escape, Explorer, and Flex.

Obviously, this doesn't apply to the other doors, otherwise dropping off a passenger would be very annoying.

And why would it be insane? I'd welcome the warning to prevent a carbon monoxide poisoning incident in my garage."
"ohhh I get it, thanks for clarifying.

&#x200B;

I'm not a Tesla owner (...yet) so it was not obvious."
"I like your version, too."
Good problem to have!!!
Agreed.
Carolinas get sheetz
Miami to Jacksonville now.
That's a fairly recent addition to the gas gauge on the dashboard. It looks like this is a older car that probably doesn't have it.
The Wawa near me is going to have a v3 supercharger! And they aren't even installing gas pumps at this particular location.
"I agree that Pilot / Flying J and Loves would be smart places to put EV charging stations.

Yes, fuel is a money maker, but so are the stores and restaurants."
Maybe someday charging will be as fast as filling up but in the meantime I need some snacks while I play beach buggy.
"Yeah, Level 2 at a gas station doesn't make much sense - you can't get enough charge while you're there (for any reasonable length of time) for it to be an attraction. You really need high-speed DC charging, like from Superchargers or Electrify America, for it to worth it."
"Only if they have excess parking available. Making money from the convenience store relies on fast turnover. If you take a parking spot that currently serves 20 customers an hour, and turn it into 2 Teslas an hour, it's not a viable business any more. EV charging doesn't make sense at many gas stations."
"Not to mention they can spend $30,000 investment for solar power and charge $0.17 a kilowatt"
The Service Center there has 6-8 just past it on the other side.
"To me it would be insane, especially since I work on my own cars. 

Never thought about a proximity key or garage. I’m poor though."
"Many cars don't do anything, it varies by brand. My VW doesn't warn me at all if I walk away with the key, but my wife's Honda beeps."
Is this how you use gas stations?
I thought she was using a supercharger to try to charge an ICE car
Nope not in South Carolina. We have Circle K. I haven’t seen a Sheetz outside of West Virginia.
Yeah I read about this place.  I think it is a pilot ballon for them.  Honestly they need both Tesla and electrify America on the same site to make that work long term.  So they can pickup Tesla to vw or Porsche.
Fuel makes them very little.  On a giant scale since they sell so much it turns a profit.  The real money is in the food and contract work for truck lines.  The ability for dispatch to send out food credits to loves and or parts is how they profit is made.  The fuel is minor. So yeah if you work for our former governor at pilot reach out. Let’s make this happen.  TN could do like 2 or 3 demo locations with partnership of tva. Install both eva and Tesla.  All you need to do is give away 8 spots 4 tesla 4 eva.
But Tesla owners have money! On the other hand they have money because they don't spend their money on overpriced snacks.
"It's going to cost more than that to put up enough panels to charge even one car at 250kw, or store in batteries."
Didn’t even know there was one there lol. I just stopped for a milkshake.
"Yes, cars that use normal ignition keys don't honk at you when you leave them running. I was only referring to keyless systems with pushbutton start.

I very rarely hear of people forgetting to shut off cars with traditional keys, probably because most people also attach house keys to their car keys and would remember as soon as they can't get back in their house. Also these people need to actually press the key fob to unlock and re-enter the car, so they'll always be much quicker to notice forgotten keys. 

With smart keys, it's a lot easier to forget since the car key stays in your pocket and you could continue carrying it for hours."
"Yep my dad's 2009 Lexus LS460 only has a soft, easy-to-miss tone warning. I think the earliest smart key systems lacked a warning but as more and more incidents occurred (carbon monoxide poisoning, dead batteries, etc) automakers started adding a warning system to save customers from themselves.

I know newer Toyotas honk twice, and of course Fords do it too."
"No? I normally pull up on the side the gas tank is, but if they are all full then I just park close and pull the cord over the car."
Circle k hardly counts
"All electric stations need to be more common. I hear the gas stations don't really make money on gas, it's the food and stuff that makes them money."
"For sure,  fuel makes them little to no money. It's all the junk you buy in the store that's profitable."
"Depends on if Tesla will subsidize the cost to get things rolling and then charge a leasing fee. Sure, maybe it's five times that. But I wasn't talking about retail prices."
Hey they got decent hot dogs
I had a friend who owned a few gas stations and he said the same thing to me.
That's why EVs are a good fit.  Right now we spend more time charging and have more opportunity to browse and buy.
"Yup, $1.59 for a bottle of water has some profit margin built in."
$30k is like 20kw with no battery backup or 25kwh backup with no solar.  Superchargers need to supply gigawatts now.  That's pricey and Tesla is suffering from all the charity already.
"And you're gonna need some chips and some Skittles while your wait, too."
"Not retail. Teslas price. 30k...for tesla..would do at least 50kwh with battery back up...since they make the shit. So what though? Youre so far off the point now anyway.  They can install superchargers without solar...but solar is a no brainer...especially because tesla is IN THE SOLAR BUSINESS. And not to mention, wawa and those alike make virtually no money on gas...but they could pay no cents from the energy company and charge 18 cents...and it would still be cheaper than a tesla super charger"
"Tesla's prices arent multiplied a thousandfold.  Your estimates aren't enough to charge one car more than 20% per hour in perfect sun with no battery and optimism won't eliminate global economies.  Tesla's prices went up from tariffs so much solar was essentially paused, their prices can't fix that.

Beyond dollars there isn't enough parking lot for solar to keep up.  Tesla tried solar on the first couple superchargers and gave up.  It's a good idea that doesn't work to scale even at 90kw and a fraction of the cars using it compared to now."
Ok. Makes sense... Someday perhaps

"Did he get the performance model S?

My Camaro driving buddy drove Nicki and I don't think he wants one. He says ""That thing is dangerous""."

"For spring break I thought it would be fun to rent a Camaro SS convertible this year. 

I missed my model 3 so much."
"Two different cases though. 

I loved my 1994 Impala SS that I had for over twenty years. 

I also love my 2017 Hyundai Tucson. 

Totally different reasons for both."
"Who ever says rich people aren’t happier don’t know any rich people.

Source, I know a few and they are the happiest people I know."
"Even if you can’t buy happiness, I’d rather be unhappy in my Tesla than any other car."
"I was shopping Camaros, Hellcats and SRTs. I wanted another muscle car to add to my garage until I went on vacation. I used Turo to get a Model S for a few days. That changed everything, a few months later I bought a Model 3 without ever test driving it. Better than any Chevy or Dodge I have had in the past, no doubt about it."
"Not sure what's more cringey

This title, the fact that a Model S is 2x the price of a Camaro, Snapchat, or that he censored ""fuck"" off"
"How was he looking at 30-50k cars and then starting looking at 150k cars?

Very different vehicles and a VERY different price range."
Why did you censor your picture
Which messaging app is this? Interesting layout
The model S is 2-3 times more expensive than a camaro...
"I have both a Model S and a Camaro, the model S is like driving a dream back and forth to work, and the Camaro is for those times I want to be rowdy."
"Before I ever bought my model 3 I was dead set in a new mustang, it was my dream ever since I was 5 (25 now). I have a long commute (144 miles) but I could still afford the gas.

Anyway before I pulled the trigger on the mustang this girl at work that I liked was super into Tesla. So I thought why not go and look at one. Big mistake...everything about a model 3 flowed naturally and felt like an extension of me while the mustang seemed rigid. 

I already had solar panels at home so charging wasn’t too big of a deal and my work had chargers as well. Everything feel into place.

As for the girl? She liked my new model 3 but said a model s was nicer (my car was in the shop for a day so I actually had a loaner model s, I did not like). I’m still friends with the girl but we are no where close as we were.

On the bright side because of her I have a very nice car that does 90% of my 144 mile commute for me with autopilot."
"Money can't buy happiness, but they can buy the entire books of Tolkien, which is the same."
I have a 6th gen Camaro SS right now and would love a P100D but i'll never be able to afford one so i'll just stick with the camaro and will probably get the C8 Corvette in the future. As fun as a P100D launch is I think i'd miss that great V8 exhaust sound when cruising canyons.
"Cool.  I have a Tesla and living with depression.  Buying a Tesla didn't make me happy, and it makes me sad that people think possessions help with that."
"Until you find out all the rattles that'll drive you nuts and quality control. I'm very picky when it comes to rattles and quality control. Comparing a Toyota to a Tesla, in my stance, is laughable to say the least. I'm currently in a  2014 Model S 85 loaner and by GOLLY does that have MASSIVE quality control issues. There are panels coming apart, both inside and in the frunk. It's like Tesla just gives out these loaners without cleaning them and maintaining them."
"How old are you, 12?"
Too bad I can never afford one.
"I really want Camaro too, but I decided to wait GM making electric version after I get Model 3."

"That behaviour is called Tesla Tourette. Usually it happens to passengers when the driver floors it for the first time, but on a test drive, it can happen to the driver as well.

SCNR :-)"
"i'm convinced that it says ""leave off"""
We don’t know that!
"Reddit automatically filters out bad words and passwords.

As example my password is SuperMan123 but all you'll see are asterisks :)"
I believe so. His mind was set on a SS Camaro. But half way through the test drive he knew the Tesla was the support choice
"Yep, I honestly hated the P100D. It's way too fast for me to be responsible on public road yet it manages to not feel sporty at all despite the sickening acceleration.

The best electric car on the market right now is the Performance Model 3 by a light year, fight me."
"Who or what is ""Nicki""?"
"Honest opinion.

Teslas are very fast, but also hug the road a lot better than pony cars."
"Next time try a car that costs more than your model 3. I rented a convertible C7 grandsport recently and it was pretty fun, sport exhaust is awesome for a stock car."
"Let me guess, the Tucson is a speed demon and the Impala is a practical people and cargo mover."

I see you too are old.
And why are you talking to him over chat if you took him to the test drive?
"Fellow ex Camaro guy. Get the performance model 3. It has this deep electrical whine that is strangely satisfying whenever you romp on it. And 3.2 0-60 is a Damm fun luanch., And it will handle the canyons vastly better than the Camaro, However that Corvette may come out on top in the canyons.

Give it a test drive"
"I mean, my Model 3 is affordable **and** is faster than a Camaro SS... don’t need a Model S to rip around.  Leaving cars like Camaros in the dust at a stop light after they look over at the “slow ev” is one of life’s great joys."
"I honestly dislike the ICE rumble, but the C8 is such a damn amazing value. My only concern is that dealers are going to be marking them up massively over MSRP."
"If I told you the sound was costing you ¢40 a minute, would it change anything? What is the actual value your placing on the sound? This is a completely serious question I am curious of. Everyone will talk about the intangibles of owning a car but I really want to know how people are actually valuing and pricing the haptic sensations of their engines."
"I mean, we'll get a good sound system to emulate the sound of a combustion engine, after that i think the evs will be perfect"
"Money *can* buy happiness, to some degree. Not needing to worry about making rent or being able to feed your family is a great reliever of stress and anxiety for many people. Money also allows us to indulge in our hobbies and things that we may enjoy. You may enjoy vacations, driving fast cars, playing video games, riding a bike, collecting things (like hot sauce, personally), or a multitude of other activities.

That's not to say that it can solve all life's problems. Depression is a beast all its own, and it's a very deep and personal issue that is unique to your own situation. Depression often sucks the joy out of things that you previously found fun. It's not a simple issue that can be solved with money. It may be solved by talking to someone: a friend that may not know your inner struggle, a family member, a loved one, a therapist, or even just a stranger you're talking to on the internet. Depression is a big problem, but, it's a solvable one if you seek out the help that you need. 

Please understand it's hard to read tone on the internet through text, so I can't tell if you're making a self-deprecating joke or an anonymous cry for help. Maybe it's both. Regardless, I hope you are willing to seek out help."
"I'm sorry man, I hope things look up"

Not having money doesn't buy you anything. I hope you find happiness.
"So do I, sans Tesla. 

No one said a Tesla is a cure for depression, or CBT, an SSRI etc. though those only *may* assist someone feeling happiness.

Happiness is a feeling, but the path to it is as diverse as the human experience. For some, happiness can be gained by seeing a little girl skip through the mall, only to let out a loud, cacophonous fart as her feet hit the ground on her 8th stride. For others, it's the experience of a Tesla - especially with the whoopie cushion function. It goes on. 

The point is, money is a means to an experience, an experience which might make *some* happy. Others might struggle to feel happiness, or derive happiness from excessive fart jokes. Accounting for, and appreciating the rich diversity in what makes others happy is far more mentally efficient than projecting your own definitions and meanings - that helps me at least."
"Happy person here (not trying to insult you, more of a supplemental argument from the opposite POV). 

Exactly. External items wont make you happy, or at least not for very long. That ""new car"" you've been dying for will end up being your daily driver. That raise you have been busting your ass for at work, you will eventually get accustomed to it. 

A hammer isn't going to make you happy. Money is a tool, it can provide choices and options, but its not going to make you happy."
"Buying happiness isn't in the purchase or possession of something (except for the initial dopamine hit), but the use of something.  
Do you enjoy driving your car? If so, you first needed to buy your car before you could enjoy driving it.  
Or take food. I hate the process of buying food. I hate preparing food. But once it's in my mouth, it makes me feel good. But first I needed to buy the food to enjoy it."

"I'm sorry but you must have not driven a 6th gen Camaro SS if you think it handles worse than a P3D. I've driven both and the Camaro will outhandle the P3D 100% if it has magneride. With the 1LE package, it won't even be close. The P3D might do slightly better in braking, but mostly due to regen. With more weight, the Tesla will likely get more fade on the track, certainly than an SS 1LE."
"They make way too many, that's one of the best part of them. Sure the first few months they might be going for MSRP or slightly over. But GM makes so many that it will not be long before they are going for under MSRP."
"I think Tesla should create an Easter Egg of simulated engine sound. They could even add a slight reduction in performance while it ""shifts gears""..."
"Not that guy but, there are tons of weighted values when deciding a car to purchase, but I could easily see myself purchasing a car that performs worse than another but sounds better. For instance, even though the GT350 performs worse then the Camaro SS I could easily see myself picking it up over it because the flat-plane crank V8 sounds so good."

"At that point why not just a corvette... I haven't looked at prices in a while but I'm pretty sure a top shelf zr1 is still cheaper than a p100d.

Edit: Nvm apparently P100D has come down significantly in price! I remember it being about 135k. So it's about on par with a Corvette z06 then."

Well i just figured since the Model 3 beats a BMW M3 at the track it would do the same to the Camaro.
"In what universe does an all wheel drive which is almost x1.5 faster than a camaro, has adaptive esp and arguably some of the best handling in the sedan world, NOT outperform a camaro? Like, please dude... I smoke camaros literally every other day. It's the bottom of the barrel when it comes to sports cars."
"Bad fiction is any universe where the Camaro comes close to any performance Tesla In literally any discernible category. Even price point is no longer a good argument given M3P dropped to $54,990 in white. That’s Ferrari performance and handling for under $60k and made in America. The Chevy Camaro is a nostalgic bathtub that will make you feel alive insofar as you are always near death whilst inside it. I do give it credit for looking as aggressive and dangerous as it handles. The look is pretty cool. Nonetheless, I really can’t come up with any more metaphors for how absurd your statement was. Good luck to you and I hope you enjoy driving at least once in your life the M3P in the canyons."
"I have not, had an 99' SS Camaro. Figured it likely didn't beat a BMW M3, and the model 3 has beaten that at the track."
"I appreciate your response. I guess there is a clear emotional component to it. The reason I ask for a dollar amount is because I think people  sometimes will intentionally refuse to provide valuations of things they enjoy out of something bordering on fear. Every time someone rips their accelerator and lets their engine sing, that’s really just wasted fuel being sold as emotional benefit (in certain cases for boosting performance too). For most non-enthusiasts though, engine sounds are things to be eradicated, so I’m curious how enthusiast culture will evolve with the eventual trend of global electrification. Will it become like fine wine or will it become like stamp collectors? Will the price for specific engine sounds become very high later on? I’m super curious to see."
"First off, I am glad that you are okay. I hope that you are managing your depression healthily, and that any form of self-harm is truly off the table for you and you're not in as dark a place as I originally thought.

As I said, money is not the solution to every problem. In many cases, when you have excessive amounts of money to play with, it can lead to many toxic habits like gambling addiction and drug abuse.

In other cases, the drive to pursue money causes people to neglect other aspects of their life that are important to self-care. If you're working 60+ hour weeks and barely have the energy or time to go home and collapse to prepare for your next shift, you could easily be a miserable millionaire, depending on your profession.

Money isn't a panacea for all of life's issues. It's kinda like an antibiotic. It works on a lot of things, and it may be the first thing you think of to cure the problem. However, overuse of an antibiotic reduces its effectiveness in the long run, and there are some things that it simply doesn't work for. Pardon the imperfect simile.

Perhaps you are embracing some Buddhist teachings to suggest that the path to happiness is through other means than materialistic ones. Your words do not strike me that way, however. The tone strikes me something more like existential nihilism. Different people reach different conclusions about the meaning of life, so it's not up for me to say which is right. It's hard to say.

That nihilistic view may be very much cemented in religious views or other circumstances of life, so it's hard to change the view itself. I'll say this, instead. Life *may* be intrinsically meaningless. A purpose doesn't just pre-exist out in the ether for people, necessarily. You have to *create* the purpose for yourself as an individual, because only you can know what works for you.

**TL;DR** uhh... money kinda is like an antibiotic and other philosophy mumbo jumbo that I *kinda* recollect from years back so I may be misrepresenting entirely."
"There is a big difference between using money to survive and using money while you thrive. That's why I mentioned both. Money is applicable to both, despite being drastically different circumstances.

If a child can get enjoyment from their toys, then an adults, who are children at heart still, hopefully can likewise get enjoyment from their toys.

As for the prostitution angle, I feel like it's a *little* different. Without over-generalizing, you may be an investor in a human-trafficking operation that plagues the entire world with its existence. It's an expensive habit that is hard to wipe your hands clean of.

On the other hand, buying a Tesla is supporting engineering innovation for the future. You're investing in technology that is critical for unfettering humanity from a finite material, oil, and hopefully leaving a cleaner future for the next generation and potentially many generations beyond that one. You're also paving the way to a safer future of driving by supporting a company that is seeking to eliminate one of the biggest factors of automobile deaths, human error, by having fully autonomous features in their cars.

So, if you have no concerns other than about yourself and your own pleasure, then I don't necessarily see the distinction between the two examples you offered. If you *do* care about other people even remotely, then **no, buying a Tesla is not like buying a hooker**."

“Hey! Got any *supercharging*?”
"Well the Corvette is obviously a much better sports car, and the rumor is the new C8 will have a ZR1 version that will match or exceed Roadster 2’s acceleration for 60% the money. And obviously handling wise ICE still have a tremendous advantage due to being much lighter. And even the base C8, or even the C7 will significantly out handle, our steer and out brake any Tesla on sale today.

But on the other hand the P100D is a much better car at everything else. It seats 5, costs little to run, is smooth and quiet and has much better tech than a Corvette. Oh and it does 0-60 in 2.4s.

I don’t think many people who are shopping for a dedicated sports car/weekend toy will want a Tesla right now, but on the other hand people who just want a fun sports sedan probably won’t look at a Corvette either."

I have a buddy who spent his entire savings for a Model 3 Performance, his car almost costs him as much as his rent (South San Jose).

I hope none of you are doing what he did...guy is probably saving like $500-1000/month max in savings...

My dream garage is a Model 3 Performance, Rivian truck, and a Tesla roadster, but that would bankrupt me."
"I would say to be careful when buying a used Tesla (I say this, but I do love Tesla) You might be looking at a pretty pricey battery replacement. And the instantaneous torque is very rough on the drivetrain and frame of the vehicle. Remember the Model S has yet to be on the road for a decade. I personally believe EV reliability is not there yet for people to be buying Tesla's that are 5+ years old. But i do love my model 3, and its battery replacement is much cheaper than the S and X."

"I was gonna mention.

While the AWD is excellent, the tires Tesla gives for a 400hp instant torque vehicle are both dangerous and grossly inadequate. No grip at the limits.

I did not feel safe on canyon roads if there was any water."
"Most people have no idea what driving a car even near the limit is.

They are used to economy cars so once the car actually pulls some Gs laterally they freak out like it is the best thing ever. I love to autocross friends econoboxes because they are always shocked just how well they can actually perform compared to their expectations, even with garbage tires."

"> I smoke camaros literally every other day.

Let me guess: in a straight line?

A basic-bitch Camaro SS does the Nurburgring in 8:20. Can’t find an official time for the P3D, but estimates seem to be around 8:50? That’s an enormous gap. And a ZL1 1LE will do a 7:16. Just... no comparison when handling is in the picture."
Seeing Randy Pobst (the one who helped design track mode) beat his model 3 performance lap with a 35k golf R I am doubting that.
The P3D is nowhere close to being in the same league of performance as the Camaro SS. A stock Camaro is almost 10 seconds quicker at Laguna Seca than the P3D. And that’s a short course. The Camaro is superior in every performance metric other than 0-60. The Camaro is superior in straight line acceleration after 60.
"Your embarrassing creative writing exercise flies in the face basic physics, and other M3 and M3P owners in this very thread admit as much. Stop giving the Tesla community a bad name."
"> literally any discernible category

Better braking, more g's on the skidpad, better power-to-weight (traps higher in the 1/4), & faster documented lap times e.g.

Streets of Willow:

SS 1LE (stock) - 1:20:67

M3P (stock) - 1:23:9

M3P (modified, Cup2s and brake pads) - 1:21:49

> Even price point is no longer a good argument given M3P dropped to $54,990 in white.

A new SS 1LE stickers for 10k less, before incentives. $40k OTD all day. $15k is a big difference, and a good argument.

> Good luck to you and I hope you enjoy driving at least once in your life the M3P in the canyons.

I hope so too - my friend & I are both planning to make the jump to M3Ps this year."
Only if you are in high school and think the only metric a vehicle should be measured by is 0-60. The alpha platform is amazing and anyone who thinks what you said is even close to reality knows nothing about modern cars.
"The regular SS is hands down better than a non-comp/CS M3. The P3D hasn't really been tested on many tracks so it's hard to say, but higher speed tracks should favor the M3 bc AWD isn't as much of an issue."
">I think people sometimes will intentionally refuse to provide valuations of things they enjoy out of something bordering on fear.

What do you mean by this? It is nearly impossible to calculate the exact price.

&#x200B;

>Every time someone rips their accelerator and lets their engine sing, that’s really just wasted fuel being sold as emotional benefit (in certain cases for boosting performance too).

And if you are not just eating beans and white rice you are wasting money, energy, and fuel on an emotional benefit. Much much more than someone with a fun weekend car.

&#x200B;

>For most non-enthusiasts though, engine sounds are things to be eradicated

I do not think that is true, I just think it is true for people who buy economy cars that sound awful. I have never driven someone in a Corvette who did not think the sound was awesome. Sure they might not want that sound all the time, but if you gave them a fun car and told them it could sound like nothing or a Corvette I think the majority would pick the V8 roar.

&#x200B;

>Will it become like fine wine or will it become like stamp collectors? Will the price for specific engine sounds become very high later on? I’m super curious to see.

I think looking 30+ years from now the price will go up but the cars will still exist. They will just be very focused performance cars and there will probably no longer be big V8 5 seater sedans."

"I love that tesla is forcing traditional car makers hands in performance.

If a vette can actually be quicker (and faster at top speeds) than a roadster while half the price, I would buy it.

I don't know what your definition of ""tech bro money"" is these days, but at the top companies it's about $300-$700k/year, so really not that difficult to swing for a $100k car.

Total compensation has gone up a lot in the past 5 years in Silicon Valley, the days of $200k being a lot is long gone.

ps I'm surprised a redditor cant do even a simple google search."
"hmm... pretty sure theres a fallacy somewhere in there buddy. False equivalence? Yeah... definitely.
For real now, why are camaro guys so sensitive? Like, it's a mediocre 25k sports car at best. Also, if he beat the m3p in a golf R, he also beat the camaro... So I guess we should all toss our teslas and camaros and go for golfs?"
"A p3d ran the nurburgring in 9 min, on heavy traffic, with a passenger. Pretty sure it can match the Camaro on the same track. also, wheres your source on the Laguna? I'm finding 1:37.82 for the camaro vs 1:37.5 for the tesla."

No the measure is driving it. There is no comparison and i’ve driven both and own one of them in the aftermath of such comparisons. I drove a manual S4 bi-turbo v6 before M3P and multiple German comparables beforehand. I’ve converted members of M enthusiast groups just by driving them to a train station in suburban NY.
You aren't going to cross-shop a Corvette and a Model S. Buying a Corvette you are going after a completely different experience.
"Well if a $95k Dodge Demon can hit 0-60 in 2.1s, a mid engine Corvette with more power and a rumored hybrid drivetrain will easily hit 1.9s.

Hitting 1.9s with an ICE is not difficult, it’s mostly a traction/gearing issue. The reason Tesla does so well is because no other company optimizes for 0-60 nearly as much.

Look at Rally cars, those don’t cost much more than a Roadster (if not less) and many of them are capable of <2s 0-60 on paved tracks."
Lol
That's exactly what I just said lol.
"Of course, competition is good for everyone. I'm super stoked for the next gen M3 and it should be as quick as a P3D in 0-60 and be a complete monster on the track, considering the heavier M5 is as quick as a 911 GT3 on the Top Gear test track.

For me anything that's <3.5s 0-60 is plenty fast for me, after that I care a lot more about driver engagements and steering and handling and sensory enjoyment."
A P100D is slower than a FRS at autocross by a huge margin. Everyone seems to think straight line speed deems overall superiority.

"Saving better than average needs to be put in context.

 If I have the ability to save 5k a month but due to spending I only save 1k while being better then average it is probably being very financially immature. Someone who would do this is not the type to max out their 401k or invest in something other than dispensaries and bitcoin."

To make 300k+ you need to be a lead on a large project for a top 10 company. Even being a software engineer at Google is not going to top out at much more than 200k, and that is for an industry senior."
"Maybe a handful of people who have had financing rounds in their sucessful startups are there but that's very far from the majority of people in tech.

Most people start out at low six figures 100-115 and then steadily climb towards 200K by their late 20's."
"If you are making north of 250k a year, you don't make car payments. You pay cash. Hell... if you make north of 100k a year for just a little while you pay cash. You guys know making payments on a car makes it cost more, right?"
"Nah, I've been thinking what you're saying for a while.

Living in OK is getting old and I miss the Bay Area :( I'm hoarding money for now, in two years I'm going to school to get my MS in industrial engineering or an MBA and move back."
"Rivian has already purchased a factory and itbhas already been tooled for production. They also have about $500 million invested from Amazon and $500 million invested from Ford.

They also have a video of their prototype truck doing some wicked sick cornering offroad.

It'll happen."
"2016+ are good. The 85kwh batteries are bad. The 90 batteries are not good. D battery packs or higher are good C are not bad. And the Raven Es are amazing.  

I have not heard of any issues with model 3s"
"The Model S has had the same type of battery pack, since its release in 2012, in varying capacities.

As much as I love these care (THEY ARE THE FUCKING FUTURE)  I really would urge readers of these post to refrain from buying an older used X and S, just simply because of the resale value of Teslas dropping drastically year by year, as compared to other vehicles in the same class. 

A used model 3 is a much better purchasing  decision, when considering investment recoupment when you decide to either sell or trash it haha.

*One thing to note however, is that the value of the P100D seem to stay fairly well off because of it being the top performance varient of Tesla vehicles."
"Power is transmitted throughout a vehicles drivetrain and suspension. The body of the vehicle has to supply a reactionary force to the suspension of a vehicle as the powertrain transmits power to the ground and begins to ride off (dampening process), so the body follows in line with the drivetrain. 

And a steel rod is a steel rod. With enough torsional torque applied consistently it will twist, just give it time and a few launches haha."
"

I do the same in mines too  :S

Haha whats the point of having a car if your not gunna whip it amirighr :D"
"You didn't.  The rive train warranty is there any way, but you didn't.  My lifetime watt hours per mile is ~400 and I've been doing this for years!"
"Yeah.  The headlight on my Model 3 had the ""accent strip"" go out, and they dropped the front clip to replace it.  Not a big deal, but after the tech left and I drove it for the first time, I realized that A)my blinker on that side of the car was indicating at roughly 2x the normal speed and B)because of that, auto lane change didn't work to that side.

I put in a service request via the app, and the next day I got someone who pushed a software update and the issue was fixed.  Supposedly there was a body control module that needed to be updated to work with the new light.

If that's out of warranty, how much is that going to cost?  I'm damn sure I won't be able to take it to just any old shop to replace the light, even if they can get the part."
TBH in the early years the only places I'd see Teslas was at the hospitals and clinics where I work.
"Wheel size isn't as important as rubber, but wets aren't going to be as effective in dry conditions.  Choose your tires for what you drive most often and get performance tires for more performance, but don't drive at 9/10ths irresponsibly or you'll learn why 10/10ths is bad.  All seasons are great at nothing and dry performance are bad at wet.  Nothing is maximum performance in all conditions, you as the driver are responsible for being safe at all times especially in a car that can instantly deliver more performance than you can handle."
Key word often
"> If you wanna run the nurburgring, you need a rwd tesla.

What makes you say that? They tend to be slower and handle worse than AWD Teslas.

>  Moreover, the nurburgring HAS been attempted and clocked at 9 mins, with insane traffic + a passenger. 

Yeah. That wasn’t official. I said that. I’m surprised a Redditor can’t do even basic reading comprehension. 

> You're deluded to think a camaro ss is anywhere NEAR a tesla.

I don’t think it is. That’s my whole point. The Camaro is *way* quicker."
">Also, if he beat the m3p in a golf R, he also beat the camaro... So I guess we should all toss our teslas and camaros and go for golfs?

Hahaha what?

No my point is he even beat it in a 35k economy car, he smoked the Golf R in the Camaro. The Camaros even run faster then corvettes, that's how good they are. SS/ZL1 Camaros are objectively one of the best performance cars you can get that's not 100k+.

Pretty obvious you know nothing about modern cars, otherwise you would know a Camaro smokes a M3P on a track."
"The P3D that you the 1:37 was race spec on race slicks. Slicks can improve times up to 7 seconds.   Bone stock P3D have been setting the 1:46 range. The Camaro SS 1LE that set the 1:37 is stock.  
A Chevy Colbat SS runs sub 9mins at Nurburgring. The P3D cannot match the Camaro on track."
"What driving experience you like is totally subjective and there is nothing wrong with that. But a Camaro SS destroys a M3P on track times, so objectively you would be wrong. The stock Camaro SS 1SS is nearly 10 seconds faster then the record stock M3P lap time on Laguna.

There is nothing wrong with liking low-end instant torque, but do not act like it is some objective fact."
"You know, I feel like I just gotta say, i always wonder about when people say ""nobody would cross shop"" two cars. Obviously i understand their differences, but maybe I'm not cross shopping only cars but also the lifestyle changes that it would bring! For example, I'm now ""cross shopping"" whether to trade in my hyundai sonata hybrid get a Model 3 Performance for extra excitement whike keeping practicality in one car, or, keep the hyundai for the practicality and get a used miata or brz for some excitement. I think you can ""cross shop"" multiple plans like that, you know? I dunno. Maybe there should be a different phrase for that. Life shopping."
This is exactly what I cross shop. I was looking at a hellcat before I drove the m3p. Performance per price was priority #1.

"> mid engine Corvette with more power and a rumored hybrid drivetrain will easily hit 1.9s.

I see, so a rumored car & rumored drivetrain that doesn't exist ...**can easily hit 1.9s**."
"I know but; Corvette good, Tesla also good.  So there’s that."
"For me, I want the P3D to kick harder at 0 mph, but it's hard to complain."
The answer is always Miata...with a Tesla powertrain? :)
"No, but it helps, and it's fun exposing more people to the benefits of EVs."

"Sorry that is completely wrong.

Unless you can do better investing the money than the loan rate
"Nope, never paid cash. What I care about is opportunity cost and cash flow."
Car loans typically have very low interest rates. This is because they are very short and cars have predictable depreciation. That makes it a low risk loan predictable loan product.

BMW 7 series - 740i G11 auto.

All years are approx AUD $200k when new.

Below is the top of private range by year now:

2019 (less than one year): $125k

2018: $113k

2017:  $100k

2016:  $86k

2015: $80k


Not a lot in red book for Tesla:

S 85 D auto AWD

$144k new

2016:  $83k

2015:  $78k


Tesla X 100D auto AWD

Price new was $178k but falls to $167k in 2019.

2019 (less than one year): $123k

2018: $118k

2017:  $107k

So both slightly better than the BMW 7 series.


Model X P100D auto AWD

New $260k falling to $237k in 2019

2019 (less than one year): $141k

2018: $133k

2017:  $126k

Dropping $100K in that first year would make me sick.

Halves in value in two years just like the BMW.



Model S P100D auto AWD

Price new between $228k and $251k

2019 (less than one year): $128k

2018: $121k

2017:  $118k

2016:  $104k


Audi S7

180k new

2019 (less than one year): n/a

2018: n/a

2017:  $89k

2016:  $79k


So I think teslas depreciate just like other premium sedans. When you wheel it off the lot it depreciates a gob smacking amount.  Within two years it has halved in value.  Then about $10k per year.

All amounts are AUD."
"Truth. My E46 practically begs to go sideways around most corners, and who am I to deny its nature? Cars are meant to be *driven*."
I disagree with the key word too
way quicker... except in every way that matters. Enjoy getting smoked by teslas on the road.
pretty obvious you're full of shit with no references. Which is pretty typical of a camaro guy...
"Lots of statements, many assumptions, no references. Camaro guy spotted."
"At the end of the day the 1LE is designed for the track, the Tesla is just a normal car that happens to be electric and quick as hell. They haven't even offered track versions or anything like that.

I had a 5th gen Camaro, it was a cool car but it doesn't hold a candle (overall) to even the most basic Tesla out there."
"> I'm now ""cross shopping"" whether to trade in my hyundai sonata hybrid get a Model 3 Performance for extra excitement whike keeping practicality in one car, or, keep the hyundai for the practicality and get a used miata or brz for some excitement

That isn't cross shopping though. Cross-shopping is you are looking for a certain type of car X, whether it be a Sedan, Luxury SUV, Van, etc and you look at other comparable cars. It's defined by what you are looking for. You determining whether you want to trade in for a 3, or keep your current car and get a 2nd isn't cross-shopping. The cross shopping occurs after you make a decision in what kind of car you want. If someone is going out and looking to buy a Corvette, if they are cross-shopping they are looking at things like Jaguar F-types, Mercedes Coupes, GT-Rs, 911s, Camaro (potentially), CTS-V, Audi R8, etc. Not saying it NEVER happens, but I can't say I see it happening often."
So you bought a hellcat?
"Well the new C8 base model matches C7 ZR1 in 0-60 for $60k. The ZR1 is going to be much more powerful and lighter than the Demon, with way better traction due to mid-engine setup, and has potential electric front motors.

If they can do it for $130k it would be amazing, but definitely not impossible."
"Well, the base C8 with 495bhp is going to do sub 3s (I think Chevy is claiming 2.8 seconds). The mid engine setup is helping with that. Their 755hp ZR1 did those numbers. The C8 ZR1 more than likely going to end up with 800hp. If they place a electric motor in the front axle, they should be able to achieve 2s or sub 2s. For reference, the Roadster 2 at that event a year or 2 ago was placing down 0-60s around 2.4 seconds. I don't believe the roadster will achieve its 2.1 0-60. Its going to have to have less battery cells than the P100D, if they don't have better battery tech by the time it comes out, it's not going to make more power than the P100D. It's going to be lighter, so traction is going to be an issue."
What he/she said
"If you see what tuners are doing with RWD sports cars you’d see 1.9 isn’t anything too special. There are plenty of builds that can hit that number without costing anywhere close to $200k.

We shall see :)"
"I actually wonder where you live. I live around some of the best driving roads in the country and when I go for a drive, it’s miles of twisty roads without a  light or stop sign so I rarely even get below 40mph, let alone come to a full stop.

That’s why EVs aren’t very fun for me on those roads and I will probably skip the Roadster 2 and get a slower and slightly used Ferrari around that time.  On the weekends I value the sound, the steering, the chassis, the lightness and having a mechanical engine behind my back a lot more than the smooth but sterile experience in my Model 3."
"I guess if you can find a way to make the power consistent. If it’s actually like a Tesla and has the heavy magic power stuff underneath the car so it’s heaviest on the bottom it would be superb. Would rather have all that power in a bigger car like a corvette so it would be easier to handle. The main issue I see is the Miata not weighing enough, and fitting big enough tires to hook and utilize all the instant l torque."
"A Lotus Elise is basically a super-Miata and the Roadster 1 was basically an electric Elise, so..."
"I do not but considered it for a while. I work in software/computer engineering and did a lot of research when I debated it. I even interviewed at a bunch of places and got salary ranges.

I would have gotten a raise moving to the west coast from the east but honestly, it was less then I was expecting. I would have gone from \~140k to \~180k, not really enough to justify the housing increase in price and I was not completely sold on moving anyway.

I think people are paid more on average on the west coast compared to the east, but it is easier to get a (location adjusted) high salary on the east than the west. People just value cars so much in LA/SanFran and it is so impossible to get a house that they just give up and buy a 100k+ car."
"I’m sorry you are getting severely underpaid.

When I was at google fresh out of school kids hit $170k in total comp, and that was like 2013.

These days $350k/yr is about the average offer for a L5 or E5 at Google/FB, $700k would be right for a L7, a Director will hit $1M, and a Senior VP at google makes 8 figures a year."
"Maybe I am being vague with the ""lead"" term. I mean like a lead senior architect heading a project who is still in engineering.

When someone moves into management they are on a completely different payscale at these companies. Typically a level 1-2 manager is in line with a top-level engineer as a floor. Being a different scale it is much easier to make more, whereas being near a ceiling it is near impossible to get a significant raise at a large company.

Maybe it is because I am a pompous engineer, but once you go into management you are no longer in engineering in my eyes. I am sure it will happen to me one day and then I will eat my own words."
"Btw a product manager isn't a manager, since that requires a L5 level at least and he would be having direct reports.

PM is a separate track than SDEs at Google, but yeah, $300k sounds about right for 3 years being there.

An actual manager with direct reports would be making more than that."
"I do not trust some random thread on a random forum where the only links with sources show Google senior software engineers make 200k.

A thread that also says

Reasonable would be anywhere close to average. $350K is very much an outlier. It has to be. For every ""senior software engineer"" you show me making $350K, I'll show you 20 making less than $100K. $350K is insanely great, we're talking top-2% territory.

>This seems to happen all the time in the comments here. Someone points out some insane top salary they found at some insane top company, and a bunch of people chime in with comments like ""Oh, that seems pretty reasonable actually"". It doesn't seem reasonable. It's not anywhere close to any median or mean. It's the far right of the distribution.  
>  
>Find any company on Glassdoor where $350K is anywhere close to the center of the bar for ""senior software engineer"". I'll then eat my words.

&#x200B;

I am a senior software engineer, I interviewed at a lot of places in the area when I was debating moving and have multiple friends in the Google/Facebook level of the industry. I would have started at google making under 200k."
"Yep, you have to look at total comp (salary + stock + bonus). Half of the comp is stock.

https://www.levels.fyi/SE/Google/Facebook/Microsoft/"
I highly doubt that because a friend just got hired on at Google as a software engineer at Google Cloud and is at 115K (he also gets stock options too).
TIL corners don’t matter when it comes to race tracks or canyon carving. Okay then.

"The P3D was tuned for the track and has a lower CoG than plenty of other cars including the Camaro. The Camaro is only 200lbs lighter at 3800lbs.  The 6th gen Camaro is a superior platform. It is shown all over.

"So what you may be missing is that tesla is ruining that traditional perspective by including price, performance and comfort in an insane package.

"No, because the the model 3 performance was better for the price."
"I don't know much about cars, but I'm interested in learning. Why do you get ""way better traction due to mid-engine setup""?"
"Yes, it is special because I don't have radials and am not starting my morning commute on the drag strip. Teslas hit their numbers everytime you push the pedal on the street with no mods."
"I've experienced two unique driving ecosystems in my life:

1. Near a large city where you will never get close to the speed limit on the highway and will be stopping on it a lot.
2. Incredibly straight and flat highway where everyone is going 10 mph over the speed limit.

For either experience, there are plenty of options to floor it depending on the current street I'm on and time of day.

I also take the car out to floor it just for fun sometimes.

I also cant see myself speeding like crazy on the highway. Seems too dangerous and pointless to me (because there are no g forces at that point). I'd love to race to beat a time though, like at those indoor go kart places."
"Ah I see.  Yeah man, standard of living out here is atrocious.  Unless you live in like NYC or maybe Boston, they the living expenses don't exactly compare.

"You’re right. He is now a product manager and spends his whole time just communicating with other teams like marketing. Still has the mind of an engineer and the same 55 hour workweek, but now everything is at a high level so he doesn’t code anymore."
Whoops. I guess I shouldn’t equate it with project managers at my company where they have direct reports of their project support team.
"Well you don’t have to trust me, but here is another data point:

https://www.levels.fyi/SE/Google/Facebook/Microsoft/


Glassdoor data is very wrong, it used salary only and does not include RSUs, which makes up for majority of the compensation.

You don’t have to take my words for it, but I was a *junior* engineer at Google back in 2013 and I made more than $200k.

Google’s comp for fresh out of school kids these days is about $180k total, including RSU. So how is $350k for a L5 unreasonable?"
"First of all Google does *not* give stock options, they pay in Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs (they call it GSUs, stands for Google Stock Units).

So $115k sounds about right for the salary of a fresh out of school kid, if not on the low side. But then there is the 10-15% annual bonus, and he should have a $150-180k RSU package that vests over 4 years, which would be about $40-$45k a year. Google also pays $30-50k in signing bonus as well.

So yeah, you should ask him for more info, I think he was either being modest for not sharing the RSU package or he doesn't realize how important that is himself."
"Yeah... except a tesla hasn't attempted it according to that list. So where did you get the 10 seconds from? Also, for a tesla to properly run the laguna it needs to be in dev mode to disable the insane esp that it has and the rest of the electronic limits on traction. disabling it from the settings reenables it past 50 mph. To go in dev mode you need to have a tesla technician there. That's why they dont really even attempt the track. But those who have, have beat the vast majority of camaro models. You are comparing the most expensive Camaro to not even the second most expensive tesla. False equivalency at its finest. Anyone who's driven both cars can tell the difference in handling. And for the purposes of the OP, cruising through canyons, you want a tesla, probably. Anyway, I'll drop the subject. I'll keep an eye out for dev mode p3d on either nurburgring or Laguna."
"Like I told the other guy who's in the mood to debate me, that time is faster than the vast majority of camaros. you're comparing it to a 65k camaro. What's next? comparing it to aventador on a quarter mile?"
"A tune is cool but what about all the extra stuff these track designed cars come with? I can't imagine a P3D is as track focused as a 1LE.

Model 3 in production for a few years, Camaro has been in production for decades yet Tesla isn't that far behind."
">	So what you may be missing is that tesla is ruining that traditional perspective by including price, performance and comfort in an insane package.

Again, it’s what you are looking for. I own a c7z06 as well as our model 3. Both are terrific cars to drive, but they are very different with different capabilities. The model 3 will be close from a dig to 60 but after that the corvette is pulling away and it would do much better around a road course. They are both great cars to drive but I don’t see myself replacing one for another. They are completely different experiences. 

>	They are making traditional muscle cars pointless. This is why the new vette MUST offer a superior stat in one of those categories to survive.

Muscle cars are pretty much dead. Hardly anyone wants a one trick pony anymore. If they do, they get a demon. The new vette will perform, I have little doubt to that. It doesn’t change the fact the model 3 and corvette other than both being quick have little in common. You don’t go out looking to buy a corvette and drive home in a model 3."
"lol ok, glad you enjoy your 3."
"It's a matter of weight distribution, weight shifting and traction. Remember traction is directly proportional to how much downforce is applied to the tires. It's a function of both aerodynamic downforce and weight of the car. During initial acceleration since there isn't a lot of aerodynamic downforce at low speed, most crucial factor would be weight distribution of the car itself.

During acceleration the center of gravity of the car shifts toward the rear due to inertia. If the car is rear wheel drive like the Corvette then you want as much weight on the rear wheels as possible since traction on the front wheels are wasted, as they don't produce any power. 

So with a mid-engined setup, the the center of gravity is already closer to the back at standstill, and then during hard acceleration even more weight will be shifted toward the back, thus giving a lot more traction to the rear wheels, which drastically improves acceleration since you can now use all the power without the wheels spinning in place.

During braking the exact opposite happens, that's why *almost* all cars have bigger front wheel brake discs than rear ones, regardless of drivetrain layout, since weight shifts toward the front of the car.

Even for AWD sports cars, power is still more rear biased, (the Roadster 2 will have 2 rear motors and 1 front one) since you want to take advantage of the weight shift during acceleration and put down more power with the increased traction of the rear end."
"I think your experience mirrors most Americans and that's precisely why muscle cars are popular in this country. Brute force can be incredibly fun.

This is [Skyline Blvd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:San_Francisco_Bay_Area_Skyline_Blvd.jpg), one of the most famous driving roads in the country and very close to where I live. [This is my BMW](https://i.imgur.com/NEHWIwZ.jpg) on the road and it's incredibly fun. A Model 3 on that road is just not as good since it's a bit too heavy to be fun in the corners and there aren't any places to do 0-60 runs.

If you floor a 2020 Roadster on that road you'd be tumbling down the mountain in no time, so that's why I am not very interested in acceleration past a certain level. One of the best cars I've driven on that road is the new Miata, it's nimble and organic and feels like you are *wearing* the car, and not for one second I cared about what the 0-60 of that is."
"I live in a very expensive area, one of the most expensive on the east coast, and it is still cheap comparably. I can get an acre of land and a big house (as big as I would want) for around 1-1.2M depending on where in the area.

I have been in LA a few times, it is a great city, I would probably love living there, but man that housing cost. If I was younger and unmarried I would probably try it out for a bit, but that ship has sailed.

The only thing I really dislike about where I live is winter, it's getting really old."

>Yeah... except a tesla hasn't attempted it according to that list.

Manufacturers do not attempt, individuals, do. There are tons of Leguna Seca times for model 3 performance. Stock record right now is 1:46.8, so a lot slower, essentially in a different class. Again a 35k Golf R literally beat it's record time.

If you can not do it stock then it is irrelevant. Isn't that was the godsend track mode was for? I seem to remember when it was announced that it would make the M3P destroy everything.

>You are comparing the most expensive Camaro to not even the second most expensive tesla. False equivalency at its finest.

No, I am not. I am comparing a Camaro SS 1SS which you can get for <45k to a Model 3 performance which costs \~56k. The Camaro SS is nearly 10 seconds faster on laguna Seca as I showed.

I did also include ZL1 times because it is the same platform and it only costs 60k, but my initial comparisons are all SS.

&#x200B;

>Anyone who's driven both cars can tell the difference in handling.

Tell that to the near 10s time difference.

&#x200B;

>I'll keep an eye out for dev mode p3d on either nurburgring or Laguna.

A more relaxed traction control setting will not make up 10s. Most cars run their fastest in sport mode anyway, cars are smarter than people."
"That time was set by a $45k Camaro SS. 
https://www.torquenews.com/106/2017-camaro-1le-beats-5th-gen-z28-laguna-seca

The 65k Camaro is a ZL1 and it sets 1:34 at Laguna Seca. 
The Camaro is a superior cheaper car."
"The model 3 is not as track focused, but a track focused Model 3 on slicks is still slower than a Camaro in street tires.
I don’t think they are close in performance."
"That's what I did. I don't need to hear you say it but you are wrong. You keep saying it's whatever you are looking for, then end your thought with ""no one is looking for that"". 

I wanted whatever was the most thrilling at the lowest price."
Cool! Thanks for the detailed explanation.
"Probably partly why everything is so expense here.  LA especially because it rains like 10 days a year there and is always 70°.  LA is expensive, but the Bay is even worse.  I like Socal too.  Fun area with so many things to do, if you can handle the traffic down there.  But I suppose that's what AP is for :D"
"Sharp as a tack, but there will inevitably be burnout and I hope he manages to retire at 35 before that happens."
"I see, that's the thing with these offers, salary is only a small portion and most people don't realize it.

A director at FB's salary would still be lower than $200k or not much more than it, but he/she could easily be vesting $1M/year in RSUs. Even a VP's salary isn't much more than $200k, but then we are looking at a few millions a year in RSUs.

That's why there is a big misconception, since people confuse salary with total comp."
"I never said that tesla hasn't tried the track. I said A tesla hasn't attempted it according to the source. Apparently, you can't read either. The article you sent is a year old dude... Do you even keep up ? 

It's still stock, they just dont allow for the esp to be disabled by anyone to avoid accidents. They already have way too many lawsuits to fight against.

I used your own fucking source bro... Lol.

Again, the SS has done worse than the Tesla on the other article that I've quoted in this thread, by  milliseconds.

I'm done debating this lol. It can go on for ever we are both too stubborn."
"I'll leave it open to the occasional odd duck that shops everything under the sun. However, most people who are looking to get into a 2 door, rwd, high performance sports car aren't cross-shopping model 3s. Just because *you* did doesn't make it normal. That was my entire point."
"Ugg yah the traffic is awful too, I am not surprised why people from that area brag about AP so much and why the rest of the country is surprised why they do so. Whenever I would come back home even a large traffic jam felt like a little congestion.

Close to the water, no rain, amazing climate, no brainer why it's so expensive. Plus everything is so close without feeling like you are really in a big city. I love being close to things but would never want to live in a big city. Something like LA is a good middle ground that I could probably live with."
"The best advice I got in college during an internship was to never to deliberately put yourself in a long term position that requires more out of you then you are willing to give. And also to not feel bad about not programming in your free time, only do it if you want to.

Since college, I have had a few friends and more than a few acquaintances burnout and switch careers. Sadly it makes all their work seem wasted. Hopefully, he manages to keep enough in him to at least stay in the same field."
"What is ""RSU""?"
" 

>I never said that tesla hasn't tried the track. I said A tesla hasn't attempted it according to the source. Apparently, you can't read either.

Anyone can submit a time to that website, that website just aggregates times based on reports with proof. Go submit someones time if you have proof for it, they will upload it.

>The article you sent is a year old dude... Do you even keep up ?

That's because no one has beaten that time yet......... Do you not get how records work?

>It's still stock, they just dont allow for the esp to be disabled by anyone to avoid accidents. They already have way too many lawsuits to fight against.

So dodge can make an 840hp RWD car with traction fully disableable but tesla has to put tons of restrictions on their vehicles? I think not, that is pure fan logic, ""I would have won but my friends held me back!"". Track mode is them trying to maximize their systems for the track, it already exists, it did not help as much as people were expecting.

>Again, the SS has done worse than the Tesla on the other article that I've quoted in this thread, by milliseconds.

Fine then post them here. But why would that even matter? I can go run a lap time and if a professional driver beats me it is irrelevant. Look at the best few times against the best few times. Your logic is beyond bad.

>I'm done debating this lol. It can go on for ever we are both too stubborn.

You appear to be beyond unknowledgeable and unable to accept facts, your stubbornness is a lack of knowledge and lack of a desire to learn. Every assumption you have made so far has been incorrect.

Imagine how frustrating it is for me to source real material just for you to say ""doesn't matter"" with an incorrect reason as an excuse."
Yeah I get where you're coming from. What I'm trying to get across is that the model 3 performance held it's own to those enough. That's crazy.
"Yup that's why Hollywood is there.  There's mountains and snow too driving distance.  Go boarding during the day, and then hit the beach in the afternoon if you wanted.  Socal basically has everything within a decent distance."
"Restricted Stock Units.

Basically stock shares in the company you work for. Instead of options, these don't have strike prices and you don't have to exercise anything, they just get deposited to your brokerage account periodically."
"Lol... where do I even begin... You know what, I'm kinda getting paid to write this since I'm supposed to be working but I feel like it's gotten to the point where we cycled back to the beginning. 
You're just spouting pseudo rhetoric and bullshit ""it's common knowledge"" talk to support an inferior vehicle (in every aspect). I wont replying any further. Feel free to write another paragraph."
"Huh, I've never heard of that. Is it a relatively new corporate compensation tool? I worked for Adobe back before the economy imploded in '08, and they had an Employee Stock Purchase Program, but that was pretty different from what you described."
"I literally objectively proved you are wrong on every point. You can just shout no as long as you want but it is obvious to everyone including yourself what the numbers show.

 Or do you just want to point to 0-60 numbers and say that's all that matters like everyone else always does?"
"No, it’s been around for at least 10 years amongst public tech companies. These days it’s very rare for public tech companies to offer options, most go with RSUs

ESPP is something else entirely, and some companies offer that along side RSUs."
if you say so...
"Wonder what the deal is with the free coffee. I take it the idea is to entice you to purchase something so they make money.

I would definitely make a small purchase if i took a free coffee. I feel very uneasy taking things for free from a smaller business."
"My free coffee with the fam always turns into a dozen cookies and some drinks for the boys.  I gladly do it every time.  

The Dallas supercharger is right next to a coffee shop and while it’s not associated with the charger I always buy something just because. 

I love superchargers with options to spend time and/or get stuff done exist.  Arlington is my main location and the fam has esports memberships at the arena so if we are all there I spend my time getting beat by my kids at Rocket League or COD."
[deleted]
Are you sure about that? I was there a few weeks ago and it *definitely* was not free anymore. I think it stopped being free in April.
"Same holds true at their Lindale, TX location."
As an added bonus it's got much better pastries than the one from the TV show my wife made me take her to.
"Agree except for the fact that the last couple of times I've stopped there, only one of the 10 stalls charged at >70kW."
Literally the first time I ever thought “I wish I lived near Waco”
It's a wonderful perk!
"Man I drove through AZ, NV, UT and CO and 99% of super chargers were 4 stalls in the middle of NOWHERE without so much as a trash can or bathroom.  Was really disappointed since I thought they were all like this one Haha (I'm from CA)"
"as someone who has spent a lot of time in waco, i can say this is probably the only nice thing about the town. fuck that place"
Wow and I thought Kettleman was fancy.
shhhhhhhhh!!!
How much does it cost the bakery for the electricity to charge a typical Tesla? I’m not a Tesla owner (just Tesla curious) so I have no idea what normal supercharger prices are...
I live in Waco!!! Never been there...
[deleted]
"Meanwhile in Culver City, CA there’s always a wait and at least 3-4 chargers are usually out of order."
This is definitely my favorite super charger spot.
Nice!  I drive to Dallas once a week so ill have to stop there.
We were there just a couple of weeks ago. Great place!
"They need to open a supercharger in the Town of West, which is near Waco. It’s a tiny town with strong tourism and they have the best damn kolaches. Famous all over Texas. Everyone who drives from Dallas to Waco stops at West."
I drive by this supercharger every day and I didn’t know how this compared to the others so I never posted about it!
I wish I had a Model 3 just so I could visit there in style.
"It’s not just free coffee for the driver either. They hooked my wife and my daughter up with some flavored iced tea drinks too!

Also, sometimes I don’t want any coffee and they let me have a bottle of water instead.

Awesome place for sure"
I can't wait to someday own a Tesla.
That’s racist
Was there a couple months ago great place!
I really like the ceiling!
"If I live in this area, I would support this bakery. Life is not just about money. Those who only think about making money is unlikely to be successful at making money."
I have stopped here. Genius to put Tesla charging at the Collin Street Bakery.
Went to college there.. time to revisit the alma mater
"When I was in middle school they took us to the Collin Street Bakery and it sucked. Not the food though. My parents would never give me money on field trips so while everyone was buying cookies and cakes, I could only afford a tiny can of apple juice. I can't even go inside when I use the supercharger because that's all I can think about lol"
Ever hear of a fruitcake competition Morty.
The first time I stopped there I saved $20 on gas -and my wife spent $28. But the last couple of times I’ve been there the charge wasn’t free.
And there is nothing sorta close to this in the BayArea . . .
I like to think they are rewarding climate conscious people.
Bruh that bakery has fudge pie and gawd damn is it good.
"Unpopular opinion - I've charged here a few times, and as recently as 2 days ago, not a fan of the bakery's food...at all.

I certainly appreciate the charging stations and free coffee offer. But I like muffins and cookies and all of that delicious goodness as much as the next guy, but I've tried quite a few different menu items, and I haven't realy liked any of it."
"This is cool and all but whenever I hear about things like this all I can think is giving something free to people who can probably afford the product much more easily than those who don't have a Tesla is kind of annoying. Like, I'm not not driving a Tesla because I don't care about the environment, I'm not driving a Tesla because I'm poor and can barely afford the coffee I want to drink every day."
"Too bad it's in Waco, a shame"
Well I'm a slut for baked goods so yeah I can see how that would give a nice ROI for the coffee shop.
I've been there! Such a cute little place.
"I was both here and in Corsicana today, no charge. Stopped in Italy and I was charged. Love the CSB SCs in TX."
The Collin Street here in Corsicana has the chargers too. Always so odd in this smaller city.
Same with I20 between Dallas and Tyler.
EV perks are best perks.
“Free Power”?
But is it really worth being in Waco?

If there’s free coffee then might as well buy a pastry to go with it. Coffee is dirt cheap
It’s pronounced wacko
"Yeah, I get a free coffee and my wife gets \~$40 of breads cookies and pie, lol."
"This shop is also a bakery, so they have a lot of touristy-type items (including their “famous” fruit cakes). I think they’re banking hard on travelers wanting a gift for the road. As someone who goes between DFW and Austin a lot, I always make sure to nab some pecans on my way out."
"This is a somewhat common business tactic, it makes you feel as if you owe the business something when you take something they offered for free. It's very compelling for small businesses because you can personalize the owners much more than a big business, so it's not uncommon to see. 

I worked at a small ice cream shop when i was 16 and we were specifically told it's good to give out a free cup of ice cream here and there to semi regular customers because it tends to turn them into religious regulars. And it did, every time.

Its a great tactic overall because the cost of goods sold (or given in this case lol) is so incredibly small compared to getting that customer coming back for a long period of time, and the customer got stuff for free."
"> Wonder what the deal is with the free coffee. I take it the idea is to entice you to purchase something so they make money.
> 
> 

Yep, that's exactly it. The coffee costs them pennies, and it gets you in the door to buy other stuff. They're not making anything if you're sitting in your car playing Beach Buggy while charging."
"The owner is a family friend, and as it turns out a huge Tesla enthusiast. He put one in at Waco and also the headquarters in Corsicana.  A Collin Street Bakery fruitcake is the perfect  gift for your random Tesla internet friends."
"It's not just coffee. You can have a free tea and I think there's some other drinks they offer for free to Tesla owners.

They have lots of good stuff, various pies, cakes, candies, etc. I don't go by there often but when I do I always walk out with $10-$20 worth of their products."
"I’m pretty sure the point of the FREE COFFEE is to get people into the store or shop to buy other things. If people just keep coming in and getting free coffee but not buying anything else, the whole free coffee thing is likely going to end. ;)"
"Free coffee costs about $.19 including the cup. I owned a coffee bar, and my free coffees cost me close to nothing...considering I threw out pre-brewed coffee every evening.  However most people were like you and about 75% of those people ""college students,  seniors, military, first responders"" always purchased something.  Granted, sometimes the college students would only pay $.75 for 3 shots of vanilla or hazelnut, which was still a profit on entire cup."
"I’d be thinking to myself, “Now what $6 pastry am I going to buy from this bakery that just gave me a free coffee that cost them 20 cents?”"
It’s called a loss leader. You give something away for free/cheap in hopes they stick around and buy your products with higher margins
"I always just get a soda when I go through here, but usually I get a sandwich or soup as well. Either way, the cheapest thing for a restaurant can give away for free is a drink. Costs virtually nothing, if they buy one thing they've paid for it."
">\> Wonder what the deal is with the free coffee. I take it the idea is to entice you to purchase something so they make money.

How much does coffee cost, really? Isn't it like <10 cents a cup if you buy in bulk? That's probably the deal."
"Actually yea, there baked goods are really good too. Just a really pleasant place to stop."
Yes that is the point exactly.  This is why coupons exist.  People spend more if they think they are getting a deal.
"Coffee is both the cheapest and highest margin product that any restraunt will sell, so it's a no brainer to offer it for free if it helps bring people in the door."
Gotta have a muffin with your coffee.
Well this is not a small business. It’s bigger than you think when you find out how they get funding.
Membership at an esports arena?  What do all those words mean together?  Like a room with a bunch of TVs and consoles/PCs?  People meet up there to play games?
I saw the sign for the e sports arena when I was charging in Arlington but I figured it was only for big tournaments or something
It's all the shiplap
"Waco: ""This amazing supercharger location will definitely be what people associate us with!""

1993: ""Not so fast..."""
Power is definitely not free anymore. Coffee still is free.
"Still showed $0 for me in car after charging 100+ miles. I did have a referral recently, so maybe it's from that?"
"Was OP from that post a few weeks ago. Can confirm that the charging was NOT free, even though my screen said $0 the entire time."
Just stopped by there this afternoon and was able to get a free coffee... along with $25 of other delicious stuff
And Corsicana
"Yes, was there last week.  The bakery was splendid,and we bought pecan and key lime pie to,go with our free coffee.  The ladies that ran the place were especially friendly.  One of the best Supercharging spots in our cross country trip from SFO to Atlanta."
I'm guessing you're talking about Magnolia 😂
Did you try all 10?
I was charging >100kW.
I stopped here twice a couple of weeks ago during a round trip to Austin and I can confirm the stall on the far left was having slow charging speeds. The other 2 I used (trip to Austin stall and the one I moved to after slow charging on the way back home) were > 100kw
"I've charged there, good speeds. It's pretty busy, but no wait. I had a strawberry lemonade."
"It’s cool.

Source: live near Waco."
250 miles of charge is about 10 bucks at 12c/kWh.
I know!!!  Way better than FSD.
"I actually feel the same way. The baked goods are generally too sweet and the coffee isn't the best. However, I still appreciate them and always buy something."
Waco is an absolute shit hole. I was only there 6 months and couldn’t leave fast enough
"I think they mean, no Supercharger fees. It’s free to supercharge here during business hours."
Super chargers at this location don’t charge money to charge your car.
They know Tesla owners got that cash money
"Came here to say: “Betcha bought a bagel!” :D
Looks like a great way to wait for the car to charge."
Sad that so many businesses don't understand this. That goodwill goes a long way for repeat customers. It works on me.
Plus I assume their cost for a free coffee or tea is basically nothing.
I couldn't leave there without buying a bag of stuff. Yum.
"They'll give you whatever drink you want for free, from the times I've been there at least."
I've spent more money at this bakery than all of my supercharging costs combined.
"Nope. 1,000 people coming in for free coffee costs less than $200.  But, if 2% leave 5-star reviews, 20 people....this business will see profits 10 fold."
"With the cost of coffee that low surely these coffee shops must be making a killing!

I would definitely take free coffee from a big brand shop. Just something about an independenly owned one that wouldn't allow me to, even though I know it costs them barely nothing.

I think it's because I ran a small business in the past and know how hard it can be to compete with the big boys."
They don't just give away free drip coffee - we get espresso drinks like lattes all the time when we pass through here and they are always comped. You can get basically any drink you want.
"How big is it?
Is there some shady story behind funding?"
"The supercharger is at the Arlington TX esports arena (which is also in the area of The ballpark and ATT stadium). 

https://esportsstadium.gg

They have a gaming center with gaming PCs and they are preloaded with all kinds of games.  The boys love it and I have to admit it’s pretty fun.  Super cheap too.  Couple bucks an hour."
https://www.hyperxesportsarenalasvegas.com/
"You really need to do some research on esports. It's a ~$1 billion dollar industry.

An esports arena would be a place where esports events occur. People don't meet up to play events in big esports, teams/players qualify to participate in the events. Then people spectate the events at stadiums and broadcasted online and on TV for certain events and locations.

Basically think of a big sports event and all of the logistics of that, and instead of tennis, apply it to a competitive video game such as Counterstrike, Dota 2, League of Legends, and recently Fortnite. There are sponsors, teams with coaches and managers, event organizers, casters and panelists, interviewers, etc."
Check it out next time.  They also have some PS4s in fighting game cabinets and a place for Nintendo switches for Smash Bros.
Chip and Joanna approve
The supercharger could use an island
Ya. I stopped by in early June and picked up a free latte.
Definitely. I can post a receipt of my last charge from this SC as proof that it’s not free for us *normal plebeians* anymore if required.
I got charged my last couple times in Corsicana :( I think they’ve turned off that gravy train.
"Yeah, that place was a clusterfuck and the food wasn't great for what the wait in line was."
"I didn't but they were being used by other folks who were reporting the same thing. This was 2 months ago, so they may have been fixed."
Was it the second from the left? (looking at the stalls)
May have just been because they were all occupied. I chalked it up to the fact that these were originally installed in 2013 and may have been V1 Superchargers.
"
What would cause this?"
"Yep, have some friends that go to Baylor and say they will never set foot in it again after graduating"
WHAT. Amazing. Close by me.
"Soon as they see a Tesla owner pull up, they automatically know that a fool and his money are soon parted so they know just by dangling a cup or two of “free coffee” that within the time it takes to charge,  they will profit $32-35 on average by selling said Tesla owner and/or passenger ancillary confections/goods."
Lol dude it's the same price as any other middle-class range car.
I see a whole bunch I would buy.
"It still amazes me that the phrase ""charging my car"" will be commonplace eventually(hopefully)"
"I can empathize. If margins are already slim, and payroll is a huge chunk out of your revenue, it can be hard to give away a few bucks of product here and there. But its perhaps the best investment a small food service oriented business can make, I think."
19 cents with cup.
Well this is business 101. $200 is $200. If a company is wasting $200 and it isn’t leading to anything then it’s a $200 loss. That’s the point of my comment. Free things don’t last as being free unless they find a way to generate income.
"Nooooo. Please take from a small business!! Leave a tip, if needed...or better yet,  a 5 star review.  That cup of coffee cost 19 cents! A $1 tip would keep good employees there for a long time!! This will help the owner. Trust me!! I'd give away 1,000 cups a month if I could! The $200 I'm cost pays me back soooo much more."
Even better
I heard the money is clean. And it’s big money.
"In Korea, at least when I was a kid and in big cities like Atlanta, we called this “PC Bang.” Played so much Starcraft. I didn’t think an esport arena would survive since its pretty affordable to have your own console and gaming rig with affordable broadband. I would check it out if I lived down there!"
Hey I watched the last smash bros tourney there!  Fantastic facility.
"I knew of esports and the major events they have but just assumed these televised places were set up for the event and were not permanent locations that people could walk into daily and use.
Also, where is the $1 billion come from?  Obviously video games is huge but for esports specifically?  Is it betting?  Tickets to go watch?  Who's getting and who's paying this $1B?"
Chiplap
Marble or granite top?
"Nope. I just SC'd in Ft. Worth and it shows up as a charge, so the Waco, TX is still coming up free (at least for me). Did you charge during non-business hours, perhaps?"
"Somewhere in the middle. However, on my way back, the 2nd from the left was open, so I pulled in there. Only got 27 kW, so I pulled to the end on the right. It didn't help much - 32kW or so, but it did go up to around 90kw later."
Truly not sure. But I've seen this at a few superchargers now.
Baylor is Waco’s only redeeming quality.
*during business hours
"Disagreed. 

For a base-price Model 3 I can get a top tier package sedan from any of the top 3 automakers."
"Maybe in the US, dammit. Here in EU its almost 3x more expensive when compared to most popular hatchbacks and 2x compared to cars like VW Passat. Fucking sad :("
Is it? Average model 3 cost is 47k.  You're off.  Were not even talking about the S or X.
Plus it’s free word of mouth advertisement. You know people who get the free shit brag to their friends about it
"Also, look at tesla as an example.  Advertising is word of mouth.  If you can get people in your store for 20 cents, you do it x 10,000. No brainer. You spend $2,000 on a billboard, I'll take the former."
 Extremely short-sighted.  Research customer acquisition costs.  20 cents is a god send.
Good tip. Thanks. Will bear that in mind next time.

"Yeah. I didn’t think it would work, but it does.  The arena has competitions and the public gaming area is just outside the arena.  It’s got some sponsors like DXracer and Ibuypower so the setups are really nice.   

Another bonus is since the gaming area is open pretty late there are bathrooms.   Although since it was in the ballpark area there were porta potties that could work in a pinch."
The one in Arlington is permanent and has an additional area for people to play.  It’s really nice.
It's virtually all advertisement money. Tournament prize pools are in the 10's of millions and there are hundreds of millions of spectators.
"https://i.imgur.com/7qcJtv1.jpg 

Nope, was 100% during business hours. I’m starting to wonder if it depends on which stall you used, because you’re the only one I’ve heard of still saying that it doesn’t bill you."
Definitely not free...at any time.
"Yup, same here. But I still don't feel ""rich"", I once even had a homeless guy call me a ""rich Tesla dick"" cause I didn't give him money, like dude I had ramen for dinner."
"I would say the ""price after estimated savings"" is about in line with most sedans at their highest trim level, so if you fit that criteria then you're paying average sedan prices. 

Someone like myself though, who only puts 14k on a 2 year lease, will be paying more for a Tesla."
"Yep. Wife is a GM of a restaurant that does $2,500,000 to 2,800,000 a year in revenue.  She ""gives "" away 300 to 400 a day in comps.  Of course the actual food cost is around 60 to 80 a day.  But, the repeat customers and 5 star reviews pays that back 10 fold.  An example..She comped the meals of a customer who was celebrating their 5th anniversary. $175. FREE.  Theyve since been back 8 or 9 times in 2 years.  They posted a review on yelp, which increases her ratings.  She does half price bottles of wine on wednesdays,  which are marked up 4 to 5 times. $100 bottle of wine cost her $23, or $17 if she buys 3 cases (which she always does).  Sells 6 bottles on wednsdays at $50 each.  Her bonus of 1% revenue last year was $27,600.  (She receives. 9 or .8% if margins arent above a certain number)"
"Thank you. Small businesses need to compete.  Starbucks has been great for coffee shop owners, because it brought a huge demand with it. But, yes...thank you for considering us."
"Ads, duh.  Makes total sense especially when the audience is so targeted.  Thanks"
"I charged there yesterday, not free. I charged there this morning, haven't seen any charge yet in car or on Tesla account. Did pay 5 bucks for turnovers though."
"Where do you even get one of these PDF ""invoices"" for supercharging?  I only know of [https://www.tesla.com/teslaaccount/payment-history](https://www.tesla.com/teslaaccount/payment-history).   I charged 3 times today: twice in Waco and once in Ft. Worth. I see the Ft. Worth charge on my account payment history, but the two waco charges aren't showing up yet. However, my previous charges (months ago) from Waco show up as ""No Charge $0.00""."
[deleted]
"Very strange. It not showing up for the Waco ones means you were indeed not billed, as my past Waco ones don’t have receipts either.

Which stall at the bakery did you use, if you remember?"
I used that charger back in July and was charged. Don't remember which stall though.
"You still drive a car that's vastly more expensive than average.  Do you see someone driving a 5 series BMW and think, ""well that must be leased through his company and subsidized by tax breaks""?"
"Three different stalls (on return trip, I moved once to see if I could get a faster charge)."
Hmmm. I wonder if certain ones don’t bill you at that location.
"Welp, that didn’t last long. It’s sold.

Hijacking my own comment to answer some FAQs that keep getting asked (and have been answered multiple times):

What’s a buyback: if Tesla can’t fix a problem, they can optionally choose to buy it back. This is different from a lemon because a lemon means they are legally forced to buy it back. 

What was the issue: phantom window switch malfunction. Windows would go down on their own when the vehicle was unattended. 

Why would Tesla buy it back: because if they didn’t, I would pursue lemon law and they would likely lose because they tried to fix the car 3+ times and had it in service for 30+ days. This would cost them time, their legal fees and my legal fees. 

How much does Tesla pay for buybacks/lemons: each state has a calculation. It’s usually full purchase price with a deduction for the miles and time the buyer puts on the car until the first time Tesla tries to fix the issue. 

Would you buy another Tesla: yes, we have another 3 and an X now."
"No prices like that in the Netherlands, very unfortunate 😭"
"All this tells me is that in a few years once i'm done with my ICE car, I'm going to get a hell of a deal on a used long range M3. Can't believe they're that cheap already."
"33.3. Repeating, of course."
[deleted]
What was wrong with it
"They took my LR AWD as a trade in for $52.6k. I got in touch with the buyer and he ended up paying $45.5k 🤷🏻‍♂️

Granted, they did strip FSD from it"
"I was literally shaking looking for the car lol, I was trying so find it quickly and check out. Lucky duck whoever got it."
"What was your purchase price, if you don't mind me asking?"
"Well around my area used model 3s cost more than new model 3s. I was looking online at used ones yesterday, and I was like I could have a brand new one for 2,000$ less in 2 weeks

What’s the deal with that?"
"YESSSSS 

My hope / goal is to get a used Model 3 in 2-4 years for under $20,000. 
We’re doing it y’all."

"Bargain!

Since im waiting for model 3's to hit 25k in the used market before i buy one, this makes me happy.

Side note: That angle of the model 3 is so unflattering."
I just saw 15+ LR M3s on EV CPO for 35k. Anyone knows what’s going on?
"I compared this with my 2018 Model 3 LR RWD, after backing out FSD cost and tax incentive, it seems I lost $1k per month. From this point of view, leasing is way better than buying, even if I plan to keep the car for 15 years. Maybe first lease for a few years, then buy a used car, this probably makes the most financial sense. I end up spending much less money, and own a better car in the end.

Traditional wisdom is buying is better than leasing in the long run, this is not true for EV, because EVs are getting better and cheaper every year.

FSD is not in my above consideration. Assume this feature is not included in both buying and leasing.

On top of the above comparison, those who bought with a loan also have to suffer the interest cost."
"My MX-5 received a salvage title when Mazda bought it back under the California lemon law. Low price makes more sense given that, but the post says ‘clean history’? I guess clean history just means no accidents."
"Damnit, is there a way I can get a Tesla sales advisor to alert me of these type of deals?"
is that a 4000 VIN #  am I readdin that right?    According to my tesla rep he said model 3s really became more reliable and build issues were fixed around the 40000 VINs. That may be the only drawback to this deal but still worth every penny i'm certain
"I wonder if the phantom window issue will persist with the new owner, and the process begins again. I hope not, hopefully they totally replaced the MCU or something LOL"
Since when did they start including photos of the actual car for inventory??
"I know this wouldn’t apply to this particular car, but there are about 15 “used” model 3s in my area for around $35k, some of which have less than 100 miles on them. I’m assuming the tax incentive still wouldn’t apply since I would not be the first owner?  Even if the original owner returns the vehicle in less than a week?"
I really wish I could long range. I cringe every time I tell people by battery is 240 miles.
"I could buy this, but then i wouldnt have money for rent and food lol"
Wonder if it will charge to the 325 miles they’re claiming.
Damn that’s a steal
I've never seen ones with those pictures like that?
"Oh man...I just got a brand new SR+ last week and I love it but shoot, I woulda snatched that up in a heartbeat."
"I have never seen a Tesla posted with actual photos, is there a secret sub-site that I am missing?

Just to compare, I just sold my LR RWD with EAP+FSD and Full Tint privately for $46,500. Ordering up a Performance as a replacement."
Never seen used listings like that. This is simply off Tesla.com?
How much is that new?
Wow! What a deal!
WE NEED USED TESLAS IN EUROPE! 🇪🇪
"this might be the legendary $35k m3 we were promised.

so this sale is distinct from the glitch over the weekend where they sold a bunch cheap, but are now not honoring the deals?"
What is a buyback? U didn’t like it and sold it back to them?
"So it was a Lemon Law buyback? I ask because you seem to allude to it when describing the 3+ repair attempts and the day down but then [u/Ry-ballz/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ry-ballz/) is asserting that this wasn't a Lemon Law deal.

It seems odd (fraudulent even?) that they're describing this as having a clean history if it's a Lemon Law buyback; many/most states have laws about that status having to be on the title and registration if they resell it."
Why did you return it
when will we get a page like that in germany?
"How to search region free on tesla.com. Unfortunately, there are no used tesla model 3 inventory in my area."

[here’s another LR RWD 3 for $33K ](https://www.tesla.com/used/5YJ3E1EA3HF001050)
[deleted]
glideoutside how much did they give you for it? If you don't mind.
"So, how much did they buy it for?"
"Curious. 

If they have an actual fix for the issue you had and they offered you a $10K cash options (vs buyback and resale), would you have taken that to keep the car? 

I feel like that would be a win-win."
Whats a buyback?
How can they sell it back if they were unable to fix the window issue?
I wonder if the carfax shows it as a “lemonlawed” vehicle?
was it off lease or a trade in?
It was $11.26 usd for 2 with free shipping
is there a point being made?
I’m surprised and at the same time not surprised  that a year of depreciation made the 3 LR rwd that low of a resale price.
"I've been saying all along that resale value on Teslas are dropping, dropping, dropping. And these stupid articles still think Teslas are cheaper to own than Camry/Accord because resale will be high. The M3 is a mass produced car and it's going to depreciate a lot, especially as other EVs are produced and just the seer volume of M3s being produced. Anyone who thinks resale is going to offset cost is in denial!!!!"
[deleted]
/r/chargeyouripad
"honestly, im pretty sure i would of bought it ..damn"
Why did they/would they buy it back from you to begin with?
Your what?
What is the usual price for the car? I looked on google and it says it’s only 35000.
"Jesus, I paid like $66k.....ouch"
[deleted]
How much did tesla give you for trading it in?
11k miles??  That should be worth like 15k
Damn it I was literally about to buy it
Someone got a really good deal. I went to check but couldn't find it.
what trade in value did they give you when they took it back ?
I'd have sucked off the devil for that deal
"Always wondered, would this be a good car for a real estate agent? Driving about 1700-2000 miles a month"
Your buyback model 3? Why did they have to buy it back?
What was wrong with it?
[archived]
Do you know if Tesla fixed the problem before reselling it? I would hope so...
Are you telling me that my car has already depreciated 50% sigh
"Yeah, but you get ""free"" college and are really tall."
tax is being added later for some reason. the price will get higher fast
Wait until you own one then prices will drop 50% in 6 mths
This is pretty much where I'm at with it.  Waiting on the used market to happen so I don't have to take the hit on a new one.
Wish I had your patience.
Yes but don't hope for much equity in your ice car.
I'm in the exactly same boat as you twk101! But only in the European one.
But robotaxis /s
"Yup. Already bought a new ICE to hold us over but now i'm wanting to go ahead and replace my other car with a used Model 3. 

Must hold out!"
For a second I thought it was the BMW M3 and was confused.
Nissan Leaf’s are going for like $10k.
An M3 is an ICE car.
"The roller coaster prices of new Teslas is making me sick. I just looked up the new price of my exact car and almost threw up. Purchased my car in March of this year and it can be had for $6000 less already. WTH. I’ll never buy a new Tesla again, terrible investment."
"Your assumption is based on a false premise; that Telsa's grow more obsolete with time. 

My point being, expect used Model 3's and Y's to having a shockingly strange ""depreciation"" that is actually inflationary once FSD is made legal, and enabled."
At least I got chicken...
LLLLLEEEEEEERRRRRROOOOOYYYYY JEEEEEEENNNNNNKKKKIIIIIINNNNSSSSSSS
32.33*
"I love the tesla community, wont see this anywhere else dealing with autos"
This guys husbands
Phantom windows lowering. We would return to the car and one of the windows would be 1/3rd the way down. They fixed it multiple times. Now they claim the problem is resolved. Price is very attractive. I replaced it with a P3.
[deleted]
I have an 18K LR AWD they quoted me 33K on lol
Why would they strip FSD?  So the new buyer could buy it back again if they want it?
"They basically gave you the FSD money back, it's fair. You got a really good trade-in deal. I would do it if I can get this deal."
What did you trade it in for?
How did you get in touch with the buyer? Seems like a privacy concern.
Holy shit they quoted me 34k on mine lmao...
"I thought they didn't accept Tesla's as trade-ins?

Edit: This is coming from their online trade-in valuation tool. You can't put Tesla in there."
I should have posted the link. I sent it to a couple of friends and one tried to buy it too. But it was gone.
I think MSRP was around $56K at the time of purchase
People trying to trick uninformed buyers
"I waited for my Audi to hit $26,900. Plan on trading when my warranty expires then it’s onto a used S or 3."
"> Since im waiting for model 3's to hit 25k in the used market before i buy one, this makes me happy.

Every buyer in the used market sees every seller as greedy bastards.

Every seller in the used market sees every buyer as cheap bastards.

It's the used car sales circle of life."
[deleted]
Looks like a duck.
[deleted]
"I priced out lease vs buy and it doesn’t really seem like I would save much on payment for a lease vs a six year loan. Considering the mileage I drive, leasing for me would likely be more expensive on the payment than a finance, and then I’d have a balloon payment to deal with. But it probably makes more sense for people who drive much less."
[deleted]
You can’t buy a leased model 3
"> Traditional wisdom is buying is better than leasing 

That's also wrong. The best option is to buy a certified pre-owned vehicle that is 1-3 years old. You keep the original warranty and someone else has taken the depreciation hit."
"For sure, it doesn’t mean it was never repaired"
Teslacpo.io got a LR 40k vin and 3k miles for $36k today
"Correct, 4379 off the assembly line."
I think a couple of months ago.
You could try submitting it and if no one else claimed that VIN it should be fine. It's self reported.
Why? I had a Chrysler Sebring and a Cadillac Deville before my M3. Both had under 250miles of range. And I couldn't refuel those in my garage...
I don’t know. But they definitely let the battery deplete to zero several times. That’s why the tow hook cover is exposed.
Most of the used cars are like this now.
Tesla started posted the actual photos of the vehicles a month or two ago.
It appears he was viewing this listing on an iPad. THat's why it's formatted differently than viewing on a regular web browser on a PC.
"Upwards of $50,000"
It had an issue Tesla couldn't resolve. Tesla bought it back from the customer.
"Under lemon law, they buy back."
"Technically it wasn’t a lemon. I said if you don’t buy it back, I’ll pursue lemon law. They knew with 3+ fix attempts and 30+ days in service, they would likely lose. So by voluntarily buying it back, it wasn’t a lemon."
EV-CPO.com
See top comment
That would be very sad. Bunch of them were on sale today and I got an order agreement. Fingers crossed.
What I initially paid less usage.
No way. It was my wife’s DD. She was scared of someone climbing in the car when she was gone. Should would not drive it anywhere but work or to friends’ houses. Now she drives a P X and is very happy :)
"In this case the car had a flaw Tesla was unable to fix. Under the lemon law, they bought the car back from OP."
I imagine they figured out a hardware fix.
It doesn’t.
Buy back
Apparently Tesla is in the car sales business.
"Without him telling us how much they bought it for, it's hard to know what the point of this is..."
"Just for fun, I requested a trade-in offer on my LR RWD that I bought last June for $56k + $2k FSD later. [Prepare your anus.](https://imgur.com/a/Y0kjxz1)"
"It didn’t. Apparently it was a lemon that was not advertised as such. As with most things in life, I suppose you get what you pay for"
Even ignoring resale cost the model 3 is cheaper to own than a Camry/Accord lol.
"Look up the lemon law details for your state. Either Tesla is being forced to do the buyback due to the lemon law, or they are trying to buy back before lemon laws come into effect."
*would’ve bought it ..damn
It was going for 50 brand new not too long ago. This was a great deal
This was yesterday.
"That sucks! Cheap Teslas go fast. If the buyer is on here feel free to message me. The car was cosmetically mint. It had a partial PPF and full tint. Upgraded all interior lights to Abstract Ocean. 

Video of the [car](https://youtu.be/E3GDS34iUx8)"
Tesla paid full MSRP (+fees) less miles and time of first incident of service on malfunction
"I kind of thought the title said ""bareback model 3""   
...was hoping for someone plugging the car into an unregulated  power supply or something !"
"If you drive around clients, an X would be ideal for passenger comfort, then an S. A 3 would work, but could really only take 3 additional
Adults."
"Excellent car to put in those kind of miles so long as you have home charging set up. You need at a minimum a 240 V plug (NEMA 14-50 or similar) so you can charge the car overnight.  The 110 V plug is only going to get you 3-5 miles range per hour, so if you run the battery down one day, it won't be ready for a repeat the next day."
"The rebate doesn't apply to used vehicles, and the Original Owner can file for the credit so long as they didn't intend to sell the vehicle when purchasing (hard to prove I'm sure)"
I believe they did.
Being tall isn't particularly great when your country doesn't have an obsession with height.
It isn't 'really' free anymore.
"2k per year tuition and you still have to, like, live somewhere and eat and shit"
Not longer the case. A lot of immigrants have dissolved and change gene pool of the Dutch tru the years.
What do you mean?
"Once the Model Y comes out there will be a ton of Model 3 owners trying to upgrade

&#x200B;

Thats where Im at too. Buy a M3 now or wait and get a used one in a few years"
"but a model 3 is an appreciating asset? 

I really don't know if I should be sarcastic saying that or not. Sure, FSD will increase price and value of the car, but..."
Same here!
I’m waiting for the model Y used market. I got time
"Same here. I can't afford a Tesla yet, but I can afford a Volt. I'll drive that around for 3 or 4 years and pick up whatever Tesla is hella cheap on the used market."
The tax and other rebates complicate this. At some point you might as well just buy it now.
"Well, to be honest, another aspect is that these early M3's have had some tragic quality issues, so I'm cool with waiting for them to iron them all out before I commit to buying one. Letting the others take that hit for me first lol."
That's why we only have used ICE cars under 10k 😁
Cars aren’t investments
Your mistake was thinking a Tesla is an investment
"God dammit, Leeroy"
It spent more than 30 days in repair?
So how was the bug back process
"My UK P3D has had the passenger window down a couple of times...    I thought it was me or my passenger, but now I'm thinking it was the car."
I feel bad for the new owner.
"Hmm, mine has done this twice in 4 months of ownership on the back passenger side.  I always thought it was a software glitch.  There seems to be no way I can replicate it."
I just want u/nsci2ece to see this. He is having the same problem
"Fuck the money. You got a P3 now, lucky"
"Oh man, my '03 VW is doing that two or three times a year with the sunroof. And this car has mechanical dials to open it. Im not aware of any way to open it. Well 15 years in and it never happened on a rainy day. Dealer doesn't believe me and they wouldn't know what to do about it. It's probably a sensor, it's always a sensor."
"it's because your hand touched a window switch when opening the door and you didn't notice but tesla didn't figure that was a common thing until recently. it was usually only the right side windows right? farther away, harder to hear/notice, and also right next to where your hand/arm would be when getting out. If anyone else is having this issue, note the time you noticed it, and tesla can work backwards in time from then to see what input caused the window go move. 

&#x200B;

edit - if it happened in front of your eyes, alright hard to argue with that"
Ha i knew you got a P3!
"What did they mean by ""fixed it""? Did they replace switches? Motors?

My dad's SC didn't do jack shit - they just kept it on the lot for 4 hours... He's having the exact same problem and went to great lengths to rule out human error. We even have a video of it now. Should have shot the video before the SC visit though I doubt it would have swayed that incredibly incompetent and worthless tech.

If they can't fix it they should at least give us the ability to hard lock the windows or control them from the app..."
Hmmm does this have anything to do with the aftermarket lights you installed?
Early May
Requested a quote after seeing this comment just to see. 33.8k for a 4.5k LR AWD. I laughed.
18K? Where do you get that from?
"Yep. That's the new policy. Great for Tesla bottom line.
Also kinda helps the private sale market. If you have FSD it remains with the car if sold to a private party. Same with if you have lifetime free supercharging."
"Yeah, I think this way they can still sell the car to someone who might not want FSD, since at this point in time that's probably the majority of people. Also simplifies their offerings by only offering AP instead of EAP on used cars."
"Yeah, made the decision to upgrade to a P3D a no-brainer"
Do they though?  Or do they give you a lower trade in value vs what another car would have done?  I bet on the later.
P3D
"I had the car wrapped, and I left the receipt from the wrap job in the glove box, which had my name on it. The buyer messaged me on facebook."
"As a Tesla owner, if you complete the purchase of another Tesla, it gives you the option to trade in your existing car. 

You could, in theory, put the $2500 down to see your trade in offer, then cancel and get the $2500 back."
"You should have bought your own car, then sell it make a few thousand. jk"
Couldn’t you friend have bought it directly from you and kept all the extras that were removed?
what was the buyback price?
And 7.5k tax credit on top? So basically 48.5k?
"Look at this for example

https://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/781541163/overview?aff=share_other

Crazy, and it says it’s a great deal lol. It’s not even AWD"
"Model 3 only hit UK roads about 2 months ago and im limited numbers.

Im after a LWD AWD. If bought for 40-50k i believe to come down to 25k will take 4 yrs and 40k on the clock."
They won’t honor them? Haha that’s crazy.
"I managed to snag an AWD Model 3 for $41k (~6k miles on it), I hope they don't cancel on me..."
"Yes, those who drive more than 12k miles a year, should go for purchase. Then you can freely enjoy the drive without worrying about going above mile limit."
Did you trade something in?
How many miles per year?
/r/thattotallyhappened
"I know, after 3 years, turn in the Model 3, then buy a used Model Y. Overall cost probably will be less, you end up with a newer car."
"No, they reserve the option not to sell it to you.

If you believe FSD will be working for real at that time then the value of the car will increase and Tesla will keep it or sell it on the open market for more than your residual value.

If it doesn’t work much better than now then the car’s value will be unaffected and they will be happy for you to purchase it like every other lease."
Every single sub 38k is gone
Alcantera headliner?
"That sucks.   We are so careful to avoid that, and the 'handlers' who see them all the time don't seem to care."
Any quick way to search Nationwide or just spam various zip codes?
Well that’s pretty cool they gave him back original cost minus miles driven? Real nice
"Oof. That’s a razor thin line to be selling the car as a non lemon. I would personally be furious and I’d feel scammed, but you said you’ve contacted the driver so I’ll assume with optimism they made an informed decision"
What was the issue?
Damn I'd be happy with that upgrade too
"So, if they could not fix the flaw how can they sell it again?"
Ongoing problems?
"Sorry if I’m thick, but can you explain it like I’m five. What’s buy back? Did you trade it in for another car?"
shockedpikachu.jpg
and I thought it was about saving the planet
find me any mainstream new car that doesn't suffer severe depreciation
See comments above
Ouch!
"You got FSD for $2k?  Is this just ""when it was cheaper""?"
I'm guessing this is pretty standard on luxury vehicles. I bought two used Caddillac CTSs and they were about half the original price. That means trade-in has to be super low.
Woah.
30k thats not bad. About what I think you could get from Tesla. Software is a non isue for them. Private sale wouls net you more but thats always the case.
"According to the Tesla site, a new model 3 basically costs at least $70k AUD here (base model, no extras no colour choice). A new Toyota Camry costs $31k AUD (or $33k for the hybrid). EVs ain’t cheap here. But I guess I would go from spending $50 a week in fuel to $19 a week in electricity, if I could afford a $70k luxury car..."
But did  u bone inside?
[deleted]
"> Upgraded all interior lights to Abstract Ocean.

What does this mean?"
Why do they sell them for such low prices if they are in high demand. This probably would haha sold for $5k above that price
Sorry about the tint. That’s usually stripped off when resold.
[deleted]
"> Abstract Ocean

What does that look like?"
How’s the abstract green look? Where’d you buy?
Did you get another Tesla?
Did you ever get some sun in Seattle?
How does tinting the M3 affect autopilot? Does it affect it at all? Just got mine and I’m thinking about getting it tinted
I once saw a Model S in a used car lot for only $19 grand Canadian. Went there the next day and it was already gone. They really didn't know what they had.
"it looks cream color in the pic but white in the vid, are these diff cars?"
I don't know what that means in money.
"Yes, can you elaborate?"
Wait what?
This is great to know! Could the model 3 handle these type of miles consistently?
Or in a country where everyone is tall
"> when your country doesn't have an obsession with height

That's because you're all tall!"
You’re *
"Still pretty much free tho?  
A few hundred euros a year?"
"It never really was, was it? It's always ""tax funded"""
"Jammer man, we hadden een ras van übermenschen kunnen zijn. 

Oh wacht..."
"Well, you have Tiesto, Armin, Ferry, Menno, etc?"
Same boat man. It's really killing me becuase Im financially able to be a LR AWD right now but also feel like if I can hold off another year I will get a much better deal on a used. But I also plan on keeping the car for many years so might as well buy new.
"Im getting a used Corolla to hold me over for a while until I get a Tesla. I could get the Tesla now if I really wanted, but  Teslas are similar to the early smartphone and early PC years. Rapidly advancing technology that makes even relatively new devices obsolete. I'm in no hurry.

Prices are coming down, and the technology is getting better at breakneck speeds.

Model Y is going to make the Model 3 obselete just as the Model 3 made the Model S obsolete (in many respects, battery tech, cooling tech, charging tech).

We've also got Maxwell tech coming at some point as well."
Nothing on wheels is an appreciating asset.
Don’t worry about it. While everyone else is waiting for that perfect deal you’re on the road now and enjoying the actual experience. That’s the value that nobody giving financial advice ever takes into account.
"FSD ain't coming any time soon. Sorry to say it, but its true. I would love to be wrong about this, but considering that Elon recently admitted that driving in parking lots was far more complicated than anybody had imagined, and considering that FSD is exponentially harder than driving in a parking lot, its pretty clear it isnt coming soon.

What many people dont realize (Elon included apparently) is that FSD requires some aspects of full general level intelligence in order to be reliable enough  to not have a driver at all. Deep nueral nets just ain't gonna cut it here. You have to be able to navigate situations you've never encountered before, and current neural nets aren't able to generalize their training data sufficiently enough to do this.

The good news is that FSD doesnt need to come soon. It only needs to be sufficiently reliable at level 2 for *most* driving scenarios in order to be a totally killer feature"
"I think the point is that the car will generate you money at some point making the money that you spent well worth what you paid for it. As of right now it’s like any other car, it just sits around and ages and loses money."
"I think Model Y will be very difficult to find and hard to get decent price in the used car market, as most people prefer to take crossover over sedan those days. 

But, that will be more good for looking used Model 3 buyers."
"My state has zero incentives, so I would only get the federal rebate."
Stop calling them m3s. It’s a model 3. M3 is a god damn bmw.
That’s not much of an issue now.
">Your mistake was thinking a ~~Tesla~~ car is an investment

FTFY"
Yep. Also they attempted to fix it 3+ times.
Took about a month of back and forth but it wasn’t too painful. I didn’t hire a lawyer.
Bug back..... Thats a Freudian slip like no other
Report the exact time of each incident. I know another person who had their car bought  back for this reason. But apparently there is a hardware fix for it now.
"Did it go down all the way? If so that's possibly human error - these are one touch windows.

If it only dropped a few inches it's more likely to be a problem with the car.

My dad has the exact same issue.

Frankly, even if it were human error, that would still reveal an unacceptable design flaw. Leaving too little room for human error is almost as bad as having a defective product."
They will probably replace the entire door before selling it.
Don't. It's a known issue and there's a robust hardware fix (replace the door I believe). The car likely doesn't have this issue anymore. Plus the new owner is getting it for $20k less than MSRP so... pretty good compensation.
It usually happened on the rear passenger side for me. But it sometimes happened on other windows.
"Can you set up a video camera outside the car every night, and then save and review the recording the next morning if the window has dropped a few inches on its own? My dad just did that in case we end up needing to go to court."
thanks!
You sound like my service rep!
"My dad's been plagued with this issue. We've caught it on camera. Before finally having video proof, he was incredibly careful about not touching the switches when leaving the car, and would walk around it to make sure all windows were up."
Witch!
"No swapping a bulb doesn’t make a window switch malfunction.  

Plus the malfunction started within a month of delivery. Lights were swapped out after 7-8 months."
This is the right question.
U mean late Apr?
That's insane.
Where do you request a quote?
Oh I was referring to my ODO. Apologies!
"> Same with if you have lifetime free supercharging.

This depends on when the car was built.  Early S&X it's tied to the car forever as long as Tesla doesn't get a hold of it (like a trade in).   Later (I think 2016?) they were explicit that unlimited supercharging was tied to the owner, not the car.  So if you have unlimited after that cutoff date and sell it to someone private sale, unlimited supercharging goes away when the car changes Tesla Accounts.

/edit. There was also a small window where people didn't get free unlimited lifetime supercharging, but instead got 400kWh free every year.  Which for most is plenty for the occasional road trip.  If you use beyond the 400kWh you pay normal supercharging rates.  I kinda wished they had kept this policy for S&X.  Cuts down on SC abuse but you still get enough to roadtrip."
So trade in is killed because tesla doesn’t give you credit for fsd you paid for?  And because no one else gives you a fair deal for a tesla trade in.
His trade in was really high.
Was it worth it?
🤣
"""mid-fifties"" he says above"

"Well I have to say I am thrilled that no one is worried about Elon's comments regarding the FSD fleet and ""significant"" price increases for consumer products, as early as 2020 (which I gathered from r/Tesla means earliest 2021+). I won't be able to pick mine up for about 1-2yrs so this comforts my lizard brain."

"She did not want another 3, I had bought a Luda X for myself and she said [I’ll have that ](https://imgur.com/gallery/M5IhtXf). 

So now she has the X and I have a P3"
My guess is they were able to fix after the buy-back.
"They didn't buy it back under the lemon law, they did a good-will buy back.
This keeps the title clear and they can fix and resell it, and also keeps the lawyers out of things."
It’s discussed extensively in this thread.
I agree.  But clicked because I thought we were going to get some juicy info on their buy/sell spread.  Just telling us the sell price doesn't tell us anything new.  Anyone can go to their website and see what hey're selling cars for...
There are no comments above this other than the one asking the question.
Those who got the $2k FSD deal also paid $5k for EAP/AP previously. In total they paid 7k for FSD. Today only costs $6k.
"Yeah, it was “on sale” for a little while a few months ago so I pulled the trigger. Hopefully I get something for it by the time I get rid of the car in ~3 years."
"Well here in the USA, I got my SR+ for 40k after taxes and before incentives. So after the 2.5k from california and the 3750 back via taxes I will have paid under 35k for my car. I pay 13 bucks to fill up my car at the supercharger and I require no basic maintenance. Sorry that it doesn't end up working out for you currently but that is due to shipping and import fees, that is not Tesla's problem that is your countries problem."
Why else would you buy FSD ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

"Lemon Laws, it's what happens when it spends 30 days in the shop during the first year."
"Absolutely, that's literally what it is built for.  It is less mechanically complex than a car with a traditional engine, so it will last longer with less wear and tear.  The battery technology is intended for those sorts of cycles.  Honestly, you are describing precisely what the model 3 was designed to do."
"I don’t know, I kind of feel like that would take some of the sting out of it. I’m only 6’2” but that’s already tall enough to be a major hassle in a lot of areas of life. Maybe if the average height in the country was closer to my height stuff would actually be made to fit me."
"When everyone is tall, no one will be."

"For me it was about 3k a year, payed myself. The problem is some people can't pay that and take a loan from the government. So you end up with like 12k in debt. 

There was a investigation and it seems like most students loan extra. 12k isn't much compared to 100k but debt is still debt."
In my uni it’s 2k euros per year.

"I can't argue with your comparison except to ask what kind of phone you currently have?  Do you have an iPhone 4 or 5?  If you have one of the newer models, you are arguing against your own point.  Yes, the cost of today's Tesla is going down... technology is improving, but prices are going to mostly stay where they are... you'll just be getting more performance at that price point.  I don't think you'll be able to get tomorrow's Model 3 for $35k... you'll just be able to get a 4 yr used Model 3 for $30k or whatever... that's not the same as phones where you aren't buying used phones or even using an older / outdated model."

Tell that to the old Mclarens selling wayyyyyy over list
"Not entirely true.  Just usually. Some rare and vintage cars can sit around and earn value.  For example my father was doing some work for an older woman in 2001 at her property and when he went in the barn and happened to find a 1974 Detomaso Pantera sitting under some tarps.  She wanted it gone because it was her late husband's and sold it to him for $5,000.  He spent a couple months cleaning it up and doing a couple little things to it in his spare time and turned around and found a buyer for $75,000.  He's also still sitting on a 1987 Buick GNX with 6,000 miles on it he bought for a steal in 1989 from his brother's fucked up coke dealer.  I think it's one of like 500 or so and he's waiting a few more years to put it on the market as back up retirement funds."
My brother's DeLorean is an appreciating asset.

"I think that depends! I remember in some country in the middle east, the demand for certain types of Mercedes cars by the Taxi industry was so high at some point, you could sell your used Mercedes to a Taxi driver for $5k\~10k more!

"FSD will take a long time to clear regulatory hurdles, especially outside of the US. Buying the car on a promise of what may be in five years is a bit of a stretch, even for a die hard Tesla fan. The technology could be ready today and we all know how the speed of government is, especially those that tend to have more restrictions on things like many outside of the US."
That's if you believe level 5 FSD *and* robot taxi legislation is going to come within the effective lifespan of the car. Neither are close to guaranteed.
"Or literally any sort of limited edition Porsche, Ferrari, McLaren, Lambo, or even Ford(GT) lol"
Yup. Long time
"I did the same... bought a Model 3 LR RWD in November of 2018 and got the full $7,500 rebate.  Every time Tesla does a price drop, it is in concert with the Federal tax credit dropping, so the car is more or less the same price today as it was in 9 months ago... some of the trim levels and changes with AP and FSD complicate those numbers, but it's essentially a push for the 9 months since I bought mine... my sticker will be higher, but my out of pocket is the same... and in the meantime I've been driving a Tesla for 9 months!"
"I, uhh...really don't care lol. Pretty obvious what we're talking about on a Tesla sub."
Won't be long before M3 refers to the Model 3 instead of the BMW.
Paint was an issue 5 months ago. Mine still hasn’t been corrected. Nobody seems to want to fix it. It depreciated the second I agreed to accept delivery of a flawed car.
When did they buy it back?
Wouldn't windows lowering like that be more of a software issue?
"I wonder why they didn't just replace the entire doors. Seems like that would have worked. Unless it was a computer problem doing the phantom lowering, like a continuous low voltage feed to the motor, just enough to make it creep."
It is most likely a wiring problem.  Insulation on the wire is broken missing.  Does it happen when it is wet?
How much did you lose on the swap?  I've been thinking of doing the same from LR RWD
Lawyer adds many months on top of that.
Today I got in the car and passenger front window was rolled down all the way. I figured I must have accidentally rolled it down.
"I spoke to Tesla about it, and they wanted the exact time(s).   
Which I hadn't noted because I thought the car logged everything.  
So now I'm waiting to see if it happens again.  
1 week no incidents."
">there is a hardware fix for it now

Can you elaborate? If it's purely mechanical I might be able to DIY (not kidding about this, I don't trust their verbal promise to send out a mobile tech). I'm going to visit my parents next week and if I can put my own tinkering skills to work, might as well!"
"Ah thankyou!   Mine were all the way down.   This probably does explain it, for my 2 incidents.."
"If it was that easy why not repair it for original owner and be done with it? Why take a 50k hit and resell for 33k? Something feels wrong with this thread and it’s making me uncomfortable. I really do feel bad for the new buyer who may have just bought themselves a 33k problem. If it’s too good to be true, it probably isn’t what it appears to be.."
"Interesting.. iv had that happen a few times. The window on the driver side backseat always had issues from factory. Was not aligned right, and they shifted it 3 times now. Seems to be fixed now"
Good luck!
You stole the words from my mouth. SC technician instantly tried to pass it off as human error (unfortunately at the time we didn't have a video recording) and almost seemed offended that he was being asked to work on this.
There were reports that the aftermarket lights on the door could cause window to malfunction. But anyway in your case the lights don’t seem to be the culprit given the timeline.
That could have been when I got the quote. Took delivery of the new one in May.
I got quoted $28.5 for a 2000 mile mid range with FSD a month ago. Guess they don’t want people upgrading.
Lol!!!
"Can confirm that they’re also stripping free VIN-tied supercharging from any and all vehicles that are traded in. 

Check out EV-CPO or Tesla’s CPO site and you won’t find a single, solitary CPO for sale with free supercharging.

Good clarification. Ugh. So many variations.
"It was a buy back, not a trade in.  It was defective so they gave him a more fair value."
"Definitely, especially since I track my car sometimes. Track mode + better brakes + more power make a huge difference."
"Sorry but that seems impossible, based on what I see for Tundra prices."
Not bad honestly 12k is great if you don’t drive much or have a second car.
"I checked the website again and you are correct.

I have a feeling they will change their mind in about 2.5 years when leases start ending and FSD doesn’t work, but it is clear you don’t have the right to buy it."
"Awesome, thanks and congrats on the great deal!"
"Short term it isn’t. 

But for people who plan on driving lots of miles and keeping it a long time it definitely matters."
"This is awesome, thanks!"
Real nice when they follow the law 🤣
Lol.  They are reselling as is and hoping the new owner will not mind the flaw.
That makes more sense
Yeah with over 400 comments I read about fifty that were unrelated to that and thought I’d ask.
"Plus AP cost of 2k, which is baked into the base price now."
I paid $6k for EAP...since I bought it after delivery. 6650 with tax.
"Not trying to say it’s Tesla’s fault, just that EVs are expensive things. Look at Hyundai who have been mass producing cars for a lot longer than Tesla - I can get an ICE Kona for about $31k. Their electric Kona starts at $60k - so basically double the price for the same car but electric. You can’t blame shipping costs for that, since the cars are shipped from and to the same locations"

"6800?

Ok...but this would have sold for, say, 3500 more.  6800 seems like a BIIIIGGG jump down"
But why would they have to hold on to them when they are supply constrained?
"You are so lucky! Tesla might be different because they don’t have a dealer network, but the one CPO I bought had to have its tint removed. In CA.

I asked the dealer about it and they said they do it to every resold vehicle.🤷‍♂️"

"> you'll just be getting more performance at that price point.

Meaning prices have declined. I've paid the same price for a TV every time I buy one. When I was 16, I paid $300 for my 17'' TV for my room. My most recent TV I bought for $300 as well and it was a smartTV with apps, LED, 55'' and HD. Same will happen with Teslas. I hope they don't go the iPhone route though. iPhones are terrible now!"

Lemon law I'm guessing.
"It wasn’t too bad, Tesla was (eventually) reasonable on the buyback. The P3 price had dropped to almost the initial LR price by the time I bought it."
"did lawyer up for a lemon law case once (recently but not against tesla), can confirm.  took something like 8 months total from the first incident"
My friend who had this issue caught a phantom roll down with the built in dash cam (side camera caught the shadow of the window going down). That sealed the buy back for her.
"If it dropped all the way then it's more likely to be accidental as these are one touch windows.

In my case, as well as that of /u/GlideOutside, the window dropped a few inches on its own, which suggests an erroneous door-open signal or that the safety mechanism to prevent fingers getting crushed got erroneously triggered (quite possible with a misaligned door).

Even if it was human error that just reveals bad design either way. A product that leaves too little room for error is almost as bad as a defective one."
A watched window never rolls.  :)
The first few times it happened I assumed it was user error. Then it happened right on front of my eyes and I jumped!
They replaced the window switches multiple times. I believe they updated the hardware on the switches since then. This is a known issue now.
"""Selling on the margin"" Tesla didn't want the car back. The fix was expensive. But since they \*must\* take the car back, an expensive fix plus a huge hit in sale price is still better than \*nothing\*

It's like flying standby in a way. An airline will sell you tickets at a ludicrous discount 5 minutes before boarding. There's nothing wrong with the seat, it's just that it was going to be empty. So selling it for a huge discount is better than nothing."
Feelsbadman. I want that P3D so badly.

And they're appreciating assets? Or so I heard.
"I once had a loaner P85+ that had illegal tint and bald, under inflated tires (12lbs). It was obviously a previous owner but they didn’t care when it was  in their possession. Also did t have valid plate so it was nice running the toll both with it."
nothing would shock me about state law stating that but also maybe it's if they're not 150% sure it's legal tint and don't want the risk ?
"In California, anything on windshield is illegal (below a sun visor level strip), and front door windows as well, but the doors they usually ignore if it’s very light."
It’s not legal but cops in WA don’t care and it’s not that noticeable.
"Yeah, but in Tesla's case a lot of the time it's just a parts issue.  Takes 30 days to order something silly and people lemon law it because its a great deal."
"Well, it's hard to say without having an electrician look things over.  If you have and older Electrical set up, they may need to expand your panel or add a new panel to accommodate the charger.  Also, if you have a detached garage or your garage is not close to your main breaker panel, they will need to run the heavy electric cords between them.  That too can be costly.

For me, my house used to have a hot tub, so I had room in the panel and breakers to handle the 220V hook up... but I have a detached garage (about 50' away from the panel).  That meant we had to dig a trench in my backyard and bury a heavy conduit to carry the wires to the garage.  The whole thing cost about $1,200 to install.  If you go on Tesla forums and ask this question, you'll get a wide range of answer, but $1,200 is probably on the higher end due to the cost of running the electric out to the garage.

As for electric bill, it's gonna go up.  You will basically be paying for fuel through your electric bill instead of at gas stations... but it will be much cheaper.  I don't know what the current calculation is, but when I was doing the math, assuming $3/gallon gas and my electric rate and a reasonable average efficiency for the car based on my climate... it was about 25% - 35% the cost of gas for the equivalent mileage."

"That’s true. In my case I’m not loaning, but anyways I wouldn’t really call universities in the Netherlands free."
"Right, but prices are staying the same, not going down.  If they were going down, you’d be buying that TV for $200 and not $300.  Teslas aren’t going to be selling new for $25k.  You are just going to get a better version of the Model 3 for the same $35k (or $50k for LR)."

"If it was a lemon law they couldn't resell it, it has to be destroyed. You can't take any parts off of it.

"Yeah, Im still kind of dumbfounded at Elon's assertion that they werent going to sell off lease cars. Some of the first off lease cars will be showing up in 12 months, and even if FSD is ready for primetime by then, they wont have regulatory approval to have them driving around on public streets with no driver (like they would need for autonomous taxis). Im not even confident that could be ready by 3 years, when they will have a ton of off lease cars on their hands."
"Wait and see. If FSD isn't far enough along by then, they will give u the option to buy. They just don't want to give u the option now, then deal with not wanting to sell it if the FSD does take off."
Did you get pulled over while you had it?
"Yeah I misunderstood front as front side windows, not windshield. Crazy front sides aren't legal at all in California, not surprisingly however."

"You are forgetting about inflation. If gold cost $500 today but also cost $500 two years from now, the gold lost value.

That put things in perspective! Thanks for the reply and have a great day.

"yeah, i just specified because i didn't want to misrepresent the facts or by mistake lead anyone to believe that i had an experience to share re: lemon law claim against tesla... which would definitely be an interesting story to tell in this group."
No since second half of 2018 I was told.
In California that isn’t legal.  They still have to brand it as lemon.
"Why would I have been pulled over?  I’m doing the exact same thing now without the low pressure tires and lighter tint. When I say illegal tint I mean front windows and windshield. 

I got pulled over 10 mos ago for making a turn during restricted times and got a ticket for making the turn which I later fought and got thrown out due to cop not showing."
No Tesla pays all your loaner tolls. I remember this!
Yes
"True, a lot better than in the US though."
"I mean, I get how inflation works and I understand the argument that the car is better and the price is the same, so in a way the price went down... but ""Price are coming down"" just isn't really true for the Model 3.  The tax incentives are drying up and the base price is being reduced to make up the difference, but the bottom line number to be a LR RWD or a SR+ has been pretty stable since the car was introduced.  Sure, if the price is the same in 3 yrs, you can argue about inflation and the relative price of the car, but OP made it sound like the prices for Model 3s is dropping and it's just not."
How much did they credit you for it?
"> an interesting story

Not as interesting as this particular case with Porsche. That one had rolling down windows and many more extra bonus features ;)

_Porsche 911 991 issues: UPDATE: Porsche and I have reached a solution_

"Wow. I wonder if they had an excess inventory of older modules at the time my dad's car was built (we placed the order on 7/2/2019), and decided to just use the problematic parts rather than wait for shipments of better parts so they could rush a new car out the door?

It wouldn't surprise me and would add even more credibility to the cost-cutting allegations by factory workers (e.g. using electrical tape as band-aid fixes!), which I already am inclined to believe, especially after seeing NextRide's complaints about their fleet order in Germany.

Also, are you in contact with someone at Tesla to find this information? If so, I would be very grateful if you could PM me their details, so I can try to get *someone* looking at my dad's situation with some seriousness."
Really? Even if no one mentions the word lemon and Tesla just offers to buy it for a good price? I doubt there's any documentation and wouldn't put it past Tesla to just do it that way and skirt branding it a lemon.
"I guess I am not sure what made running the toll booth? Was it the tint, the fact that the car didn’t have a plate, or simply because Tesla picks up the tolls (which I didn’t know until now)?"
I guess it’s not clear if the OP had an ez pass and/or license plate mounted on the car as they were going through the toll booth.
Mid fifties
"Oh, yea..

*cause the vehicle to be retitled in the name of the manufacturer, request the Department of Motor Vehicles to inscribe the ownership certificate with the notation “Lemon Law Buyback,” and affix a decal to the vehicle in accordance with Section 11713.12 of the Vehicle Code if the manufacturer knew or should have known that the vehicle is required by law to be replaced, accepted for restitution due to the failure of the manufacturer to conform the vehicle to applicable warranties pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2, or accepted for restitution by the manufacturer due to the failure of the manufacturer to conform the vehicle to warranties required by any other applicable law of the state, any other state, or federal law.*

So, even if they claim it was “goodwill” or “customer satisfaction”, if they knew or should have known it qualifies for buyback under the lemon, it’s branded."
"Wow, they really took a bath on it"
With an awful window issue like that I’m glad they took care of you.
"Interesting. You've got me thinking about this now.

If you got the federal tax credit, did they take that into account with the buy back?

So far my 3D has spent 39 days in service. The first visit was 25 days, second was 14 days. It's due to go in to service again soon for a 3rd visit (once Tesla finds out bumper availability)."
How much was purchase price?
I'm not seeing where in that text that it says that. It says if they failed to conform to warranties. Tesla may say that they haven't given up on fixing it and that it could be fixed but for goodwill and because the customer is upgrading they will buyback.
They also sat on it for 8 months
"Yep. It sucks getting in your car in Seattle and having the seat covered in rain water. Or worse, a homeless person sleeping in the back."
What do you do while car is in shop for transportation?
"That's an insane service time. Loaners are fine and all, but I've never had my car in the shop for longer than a few days for regular service."
"Looks similar to my model, would have been 51k assuming no 5k EAP or wheel upgrade."
Or that’s how long it took them to actually fix the window problem.
Thanks for the F-shack
"Uh, wow!"
Did that second part actually happen?
"They have loaners. First time I got an S P85, second time an S 85. Both older models that were in typical loaner-car condition. Made me really appreciate the 3."
"Signed, Dirty Mike and The Boys"
No but my wife would never drive it downtown for the fear of something like that happening.
Dirty Mike really likes the PHEVs. Not sure about BEVs

"I drive a Chevy volt almost entirely on electric. When I had to move, I rented a Uhaul. 

   
   
   
That moment when im trying to drive the Uhaul off the lot, and it won't shift gears or move, and I look up at the clerk who set it up for me, and he makes a twisting motion with his right hand like a key in the ignition.
   
   
   
I hadn't turned it on yet. 
   
   
   
When I turned it on I felt like I was driving around in a truck full of blenders. 
   
   
  
When did I become so spoiled by my silent EV?"
"Not gonna lie the truth to this is astounding.

After having a car that shook horribly after multiple times from multiple failing spark plugs, a broke ECU that needed replaced, and a new PCM. I then got a 2017 Audi A4 (on the new platform), every time I hear a weird vibration, or a rumble, or any strange inconsistent minor thing, I immediately fear the worst. 

I’m over engines and can’t wait to get a nice EV.

After 6 months of owning my A4 (which has pretty good specs at 252 HP and 271 lb ft torque) I decided to take my mom to test drive a 2017 Model S that had been traded in at a local dealership to show her Autopilot as she drives over 30k miles a year. After driving it, feeling how smooth it was, not feeling a single transmission shift, really quiet experience, along with autopilot and having instant torque. I got back in my audi immediately after and instantly noticed a difference on take off. For 6 months of having the car I always am involuntary the first out of the gate at the red light just barely pushing on the pedal with my Audi. But then, after driving the S. I literally felt like there was absolutely no power to my car. There was absolutely no comparison. 

I drove a 75D for reference so not even a P85D, 100D or, a P100D."
"Electric vehicles have tons of benefits over ICE's, however this one is pretty subjective. I quite enjoy the way many performance engines sound. Nothing better than hearing your turbo spool up."
"Super subjective. As a fan of cars and driving I -love- the sound of NA V10s (LFA, widely regarded as best production engine noise). I absolutely love tesla but I would much rather listen to a v8/v12 than the electrical noise on a tesla.

But I'd also much rather be able to charge the car overnight and have AP during long/monotonous commutes."
"Someone please tell me where this meme come from, i want to hear it"
Favorite one so far!
Haha this is a pretty funny use of that meme. Id like a silent EV and a V8 truck with exhaust and lt headers to get the best of both worlds
"One of the biggest reasons I decided to go with a Tesla over other performance sedans is because of the silence.  I have always hated loud cars, and I really don't understand the ""car culture"" obsession with loud exhaust.  It doesn't sound good, and it is annoying.  No, it doesn't sound good even when it is a Ferrari or Lambo.  It's still annoying, and I'm still angry that you decided to wake up an entire three block radius on Sunday morning by farting noxious fumes into the air."
"As much as I love Tesla, many *true* car enthusiasts would rather prefer a car like an Aventador over the new roadster. There's craftsmanship in a car like that and the engine noise is something that they appreciate. Tesla fans =/= car fans. They're more tech fans than car fans."
Have you driven one too? Or are you living vicariously through her and just farming her karma?
When your Tesla makes engine noises... now that’s where the real problems begin.
I love tesla and planning to get one but everything else aside....man a V8 does sound magnificently well.
Wrong meme mate.
"after almost getting hit by someone going around a corner waaaaay to fast this weekend in a prius while I was crossing the street, they def need to add some type of noise to these cars. shits be creeping up on you."
No at all how this meme format work. Cringy boomers shouldn't meme
How huge is your wife?
#Teslas may not have engine noises but insulation is horrible and it’s much louder inside than similarly priced gasoline so..

The car or the wife?
I love it too :)
I'm all about the quiet. Had to drive my parents truck the other day and damn thing was so loud it made me feel like it was underpowered despite being turbo. I guess I've learned to associate engine noises with a struggling engine because of my volt
"It's nice having the ultimate sleeper at your toes. Mine is not the ultimate, but still quite fun nonetheless. Have not had many people try to race, but want to see how it does if I do."
It's literally why I bought the car over an M3 or RS5.  My entire adult life I've been saying how much I just wanted a fast car that didn't sound like a fat man with diarrhea.

"Ya, especially at 110dB as some asshat revs his piece-o-crap muscle car at the stoplight next to you.  Of course, I tend to leave them in the dust shortly thereafter, but that's just me..."
"Noise pollution is a real thing, though. Just like light pollution. Definitely harming ecosystems we're not paying attention to, and affecting quality of life for many in poor areas that are near busy throughways."
"As someone that works in a parking garage, I have PTSD from 'perfomance engine sounds' from ICE vehicles. Every single Mustang, Subaru, McLaren, etc that just HAVE to rev bomb inside the echo chamber of a parking garage can all go fuck themselves."
"Noise a a manual transmission are what i miss. Visceral vs sterile driving experience. Electric is so much more responsive and faster than most stuff, but it's a different type of driving."
"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/woman-yelling-at-a-cat

"I upgraded from a Camaro SS. Loved the sound that engine made and I miss it sometimes, but being a stealthy speed ninja is pretty cool too."
"I think that alot of car fans are more about performance overall when looking at supercars and the like, and they tend to pick favorites based upon style of the brand, there are gearheads that are like mah engine noises though. 

If we gonna do the mah engine noises bit tho, nothing beats the maybach series of V8s used to power the likes of the panthers and king tiger tanks. Change my mind 😂"
Real car fans make woosh noises as they blow air through radiators.
Seems a bit silly when they add extra engine noise to sports cars electronically.
"Car enthusiast working in IT with a Tesla here. Honestly, I’m enjoying the tech more than I thought I would. In most cars tech just gets in the way of driving, and while the Tesla definitely is guilty of this as well, a lot of the tech is about enhancing convenience which I quite like. I now can say “hey Siri, I’m done shopping” and my car will start climate control and pop the trunk. How fucking cool is that?!"
"That's only because that is all they knew for so long. If you had grown up with electric cars all over the place, you'd certainly be saying ""wtf that Aventador so damn loud?"". I'd much rather see what Lamborghini finally comes up with for an EV."
"I got to drive the same one, but I've been following them for over a year now. I talked her into a test drive and it's all she was talking about over the weekend. I'm just happy she liked it and is considering one over her ICE. With her payment and gas from a commute, the numbers are working out well."

Yes.
"The thing that annoys me about it is for any new car from the last 5 years, the motor is pretty much as quiet as a Tesla at slow speeds. Ain’t no way a blind person would hear a 2019 Honda rolling up on them at 20mph"

"Oh its hilarious when that happens. Particularly because I'm in a fucking soccer mom mobile model x, with my wife and 2 kids in the car, and I'm not even trying to race you this is just how I do red lights. But there you are with your farting can muffler making all sorts of noises and keep looking at me like you ever had a chance."
"At highway speeds any modern passenger car doesn't have really any appreciable difference in external noise for ICE vs BEV. The tires+wind are what you hear, not the powerplant."
exactly why that hobby is mostly for uneducated people...money can't buy wisdom or get rid of selfishness
[deleted]
"Yeah, I feel a strong disconnect when driving electric. It doesn't feel as... Alive or quirky. The motor works or it doesn't. There's no such thing as oh yeah it makes that noise at the bottom rpm band.

It feels appliance like. You get in, you turn it on, you go to the location and you turn it off. When driving my ice it's Def more ""fun"" for regular routine drives."
Thx :)
"Exactly. Don't get me wrong, I'm going to purchase a Tesla myself in the future and I am a huge fan of Elon and his companies. But to trash on cars with amazing exhaust systems is just ridiculous. I get it though if those type of people are older people."
Most people in car community would prefer a slower car if it had a manual and a loud v8/10/12.
"I agree to an extent. Performance is the top factor for most enthusiasts, but I know many people would agree that a loud V12 engine sounds amazing and many would prefer a car with that over the roadster, even if the roadster is a few tenths of a second quicker. I'm not saying there's a right or wrong for preferences, but most true car fans would side with that."
"Yes and no. Performance is important up to a certain level, after that it’s all subjective preferences.

There is virtually no difference between a 2.8s 0-60 car and a 2.6s 0-60 car, but how it sounds and feels and looks can be drastically different and different people prefer different things.

For example you could always get a faster car than Ferrari for cheaper, but a Ferrari is still a Ferrari and it still has a 3 years long wait list for their entry level sports car..."
I agree

"Agreed. The law, as written, is biased towards EVs. If it were written that all cars that omit sound below a set dB level at a curtain speed was required to make noise it would be a fair and unbiased law. Instead it is targetted at making EVs appear less attractive to buy."
[deleted]
Okay then I'll plug it back in before I get it inspected and unplug it again after 👍
I mean... Have you even looked into Tesla? They're not even 20 years old as a company yet. Prices are gonna be high for every EV with good range so its not just Teslas
"Let me guess, your source is the internet talking about panel gaps? Look at some new Model 3s."

"As someone with a few heavily modified cars, I feel attacked. 

In my defense, one of them is strictly a track car and the other is quieter than your typical AMG or M car when the exhaust valves are closed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is why very often Tesla fans are disliked by the rest of the car community.

FYI, nobody was really trying to race you either, the noises are for mostly self enjoyment."
"Until you modify your muffler because it's ""cool""."
Only car subreddit this world ever be said in is this one.
"Absolutely. The imperfections and having to learn them and work around them are what makes a lot of cars fun. It was a weird feeling when I actually started to like turbo lag, the spooling noise, the building boost and exhaust noises. Whew. I need to sit down."
Which is weird because I actually feel more in control with an EV than my old manual fiesta. It might be just how I’m wired perhaps. The control is more subtle than making big movements of a gear stick
"> It doesn't feel as... Alive or quirky.

Get a Performance model. It definitely helps."
"Yea, I can see that, is why I was referring specifically to talking about supercars and the like, they are all in such a high performance bracket that all thats left to really differ is style/aero choices. 

Alot of ppl still like 80s and 90s asian cars, because they are fun to drive lower powered machines from the factory, with upgrade potential ( toyota AE86 anyone?, thats so famous, it got its own anime)"
"It just turns on to the last setting, exactly what I want."

Let's not go that far. Federal and state tax credits are huge biases in favor of EVs and a big reason why they were adopted at such a rapid rate.
"“the rules will require that plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles emit artificial sounds at speeds of under 18.6 miles per hour (30 km per hour)”

Could the default be an external speaker connected with the car stereo? Only switch to a synthetic sound when the stereo is turned off?"
So deaf people aren't allowed to exist anymore?

"Ladies and gentlemen, you are wrong. 

Not when they're very obviously egging you on for several minutes. Like, rev it and go, then fall level up with you, and repeat. While giving you ""the look"" and body motions to ""lets go"", as I pretend not to see it because I'm just trying to drive my fucking family somewhere.

I wasn't a teenager or dumb 20 year old *that* long ago. I know."
enjoyment for yourself versus health risks and annoyance to everyone else. this is why educated people don't really like the car community in general
"Most exhaust mods are done for self enjoyment, not for impressing anyone, people who drive modded/performance ICEs tend to like the noises they make. Except straight pipes, fuck those.

 And dual mode exhausts exist, quiet in town, loud on some backroad."
">The imperfections and having to learn them and work around them are what makes a lot of cars fun.

This. A million times this.

This is why many people love ICEs, flawed as they are."
"I’m thinking about replacing my Mazdaspeed3 with a 60 hp kei car. Seems a slow-car-fast Beat or similar, plus a performance Tesla, would make a sweet garage."
Get off it mate. Sexist jokes are tasteless but plenty funny. Please don't tell people how to think. I'm old enough to remember when it was just conservatives who were thought police.
"um there are plenty of funny sexist jokes, you sound like a sjw trying to tell people what's funny and not."
The government is not a monolithic entity. It’s entirely possible for different parts to have multiple policies that both promote and discourage EV adoption.
No.  Let's go that far.
"This noisemaker will not significantly crease pedestrian safety, and in fact if it does work at all it will reduce pedestrian safety as pedestrians learn to listen for traffic rather than looking for traffic.

We already have people watching Netflix with closed headphones while crossing roads. No amount of noise is going to improve safety when pedestrians are getting more stupid every day."
Yup
"Or, just watch where you’re going. I did roll up behind a guy in the parking lot talking to his family. I patiently waited and they pointed, when he turned around I could see the “oh shit” come from his mouth. He looked very surprised to see a car sitting right behind him"
You are forgetting how massively appealing the supercharger network is.
"If you've been in a Model 3, yeah sure. But I've been in loads of Model S and X and they're built damn good."
"Tesla can’t compete with like the Audi etron, the great German electric car? Or maybe the egolf? Seriously I prefer a bike than theses shit."
"I drove al my life in German cars. Tesla is the best car I ever owned in every metric. Better then AUDI, BMW, VW or Opel."
Mine is spot on. Got it a month ago.
"Yeah, I strongly doubt that. Or your are confusing ""quality"" with personal taste."
"This^ 

Belong right to the people who blast their music on Bluetooth speakers."
You're really proving his point.
"Eating meat is way worse then fun weekend sports cars. That is just enjoyment for yourself. 

You are just doubling down on why people have a stereotype against Tesla fans."
">And dual mode exhausts exist, quiet in town, loud on some backroad.

Many cars from the factory have this."
Yeah keep telling you that. When I hear a 20 year old in a <1k$ car with exhaust mod I’m sure they did it for the *coolness factor*. Of course it doesn’t impress anyone except maybe their equally dumb friends.
"This is true for people that grew up with them, I think. But for every person who misses the noise and maintenance of an ICE, there's another who missed the personality and smell of horses. It's definitely a feature of an era, but there's no way they keep their popularity in the long run."
"After leasing my 2018 Leaf, I’ve come to learn that raw hp doesnt mean as much as we think, its all about the torque. My old 06 saturn ions 4 cyl engine had about as much hp as my leaf does now, but my leaf has almost 3x the torque. 90 lb ft of torque iirc out of the saturn vs the ~250 of the leafs much smaller motor."
Explain what’s “plenty funny” about them.
"lol. Being a ""sjw"" means not finding humor in being sexist? Move along baby boomer."
"Studies literally show that hybrids and EVs have over double the likelihood of hitting pedestrians.

That burden of proof is on you to show it will not help. Obviously the experts do.

The whole noise will make people less safe has to be a literal joke. Can’t take that comment seriously."
What a bad argument. Who needs pedestrian crash standards then? Just don’t hit one.

"Panel gaps arent a personal taste. Tesla's aren't that uncommon anymore. I see them and their subpar manufacturing quality control standards daily. The panel gaps are endlessly documented and appaling in some cases. I still want a model 3 but I'm not willfully ignorant to their faults. The materials compared to European counterparts is factually not as good. The tactile feedback of buttons, switches, seats, squeaks and all else is simply not as good. When specifically comparing interior quality they're compatible to cars worth less than $20k. When comparing quality control I have yet to hear of or experience a company quite as bad. While they excel in engineering of their batteries and motors, they drop far short of the lead anywhere else. 

If in your opinion you prefer the layout and design of an interior that's fine. That's an opinion that I agree with in some ways. However; design and fashion isn't what's being discussed here."
The Mustang and M3 for example. I was talking about aftermarket pipes.
Boring ICE cars will go away. But enthusiast cars will continue.
"Usually if you have to explain a joke; then the person listening to it probably wouldnt find it funny anyway.

I will say this. Nothing is exempt from mockery/satire. Nothing."
"idc if you find it funny or not, you can live a dull life where you dont laugh about anything for all I care, but stop trying to bring people down to your sad dull thinking. We want to laugh at anything and everything."
"Can you show me the studies supporting this “over double” claim?

The nearest I can find is a claim that a study of NHTSA data shows a 37% higher pedestrian collision rate involving hybrid and electric cars. There is no supporting evidence showing that the problem is quietness as opposed to rapid acceleration (which will especially be a problem in car parks with cars reversing out of parking spaces).

I know from first hand experience that electric and hybrid cars make more noise than some petrol cars simply because the motor controllers on electric cars make audible squeals at low speeds, while petrol or diesel engines at low RPM in modern cars are extremely quiet.

https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811526#page15

> 5.1 Zone Speed Limit
> 
> In most cases, a vehicle’s actual travel speed prior to the crash is unknown. Therefore, the speed limit was used as a proxy for vehicle travel speed.

From table 12 it is apparent that the greatest disparity in crash rates is vehicles stopped in traffic entering motion unexpectedly. Thus it is not the sound of the car at all but the sudden acceleration which is the issue there, suggesting that drivers are accelerating from a standing start without paying attention to pedestrian traffic.

The highest cause of collisions was cars taking turns, which again points to the relatively high speed being an issue rather than quietness of the vehicle. Tyres will be making more noise than engines at this point.

There is no breakout by power/weight ratios of vehicles involved. This will bias results since EVs and HE tend to behave more like high performance cars at lower speeds, with one of the most touted features of electric cars being their acceleration from a standing start.

I do not believe that the NHTSA study provides sufficient information to draw the conclusion that “quietness” is the cause of the perceived disparity in collisions with pedestrians and cyclists."
"Well yeah, that’s pretty much how it’s worked for the last 60 years. Most people can handle it just fine."
Disappointed with all those Mercedes Benz parts and panels?
"Definitely. The model S only came out in 2012, it would be unreasonable to expect companies with so many resources to have a comparable car any time this decade. Too bad Tesla’s patents aren’t fair game to make it easier."
So those are .. fake electric cars?
What are the quality issues with Tesla? I'm genuinely curious.
Only in a model 3 or older non-AP model S. Interior quality in newer S/X are fine.
"Ah I see what you mean. Never had a “fancy”
Car before so seems fine to me"
"Okay, so what in your opinion was of lesser quality?"
"There are no panel gaps. This has been resolved months ago.

>But, when next to the car,  I was stunned. Not only was the paint without any discernible flaw, but  the various panels formed a body of precision that was beyond reproach.  Gaps from hood to fenders, doors to frame, and all the others appeared  to be perfectly even, equal side-to-side, and completely parallel. Gaps  of 3.5 to 4.5mm are considered word-class. This Model 3 measured up.

My car is flawless and has been delivered 9 months ago. Just stop it, it's not a valid point anymore."
Yep! Just pointing out that both OE and aftermarket systems can have this.

Sorry it was 2x for bicycles and 50% for pedestrians.

So this study mainly points to the Prius. You think the Prius perform like a high performance vehicle at low speeds?

There are essentially two possibilities. Hybrid and EV drivers are worse drivers overall then average. Or the lack of noise makes makes them more likely to hit them."

">You think the Prius perform like a high performance vehicle at low speeds?

Do you think it doesn't have decent low end acceleration?

Aside from your false dichotomy there are other options like people aren't used to how electric and hybrid cars behave.

But hey, let's go put noisemakers on cars for a decade and when it turns out that the problem of pedestrians walking in front of moving vehicles gets worse, will you be willing to admit that it wasn't the cars being ""silent"" that was the problem in the first place?

Also that article you linked to doesn't support the point you're trying to make. Their suggestion about the problems with the legislation is the obvious one: that the problem is ill-defined, the metric of interest is not addressed, and the expected outcome is not stated. If there was a clear indication that EVs and hybrids were causing more problems because they are quiet, and that the same did not apply to quiet ICE cars, there should be some reason why.

So what we have is this supposition that EVs are dangerous because they are quiet when the data does not support that conclusion, while quiet ICE cars are not dangerous because they're a different type of quiet. Nobody has studied the problem as to ""how quiet is too quiet"" but what we do have is this regulation that EVs need to make noise at low speed. It's almost as if the people drafting the legislation wanted to add cost to the manufacture of electric vehicles for some reason and just picked a really dodgy interpretation of some low-resolution data as their supporting evidence.

So to recap: the data from the NHTSA does not provide any indication of *why* there is apparently a higher rate of collisions between pedestrians and EVs. The data from the NHTSA as presented by proponents of the legislation doesn't even provide any indication of whether the average across ICE vehicles is perhaps skewed towards quieter vehicles or faster accelerating vehicles.

Thus my hypothesis: making EVs ""noisy"" will acclimatise pedestrians to listening for noise, and they will get caught completely off guard by ICE vehicles that also accelerate quickly from a standing start but don't make as much noise as the noise makers attached to EVs. The collision rate between pedestrians and these quick-off-the-mark ICE cars will increase but be hidden under the noise of all the other ICE cars in the analysis (since all ICE cars are in the one ""bin"" as far as the statistics are concerned). The collision rate between pedestrians and EVs will change little if at all (because the issue is the speed of acceleration, not the lack of noise) and collisions with ICE cars will rise slightly overall. Proponents of noisy cars will point to the numbers getting closer together and claim success for noisy car regulation."
I’ve owned an Audi  and a BMW and I wouldn’t own either again past their warranty.  I have a BMW dealer friend of mine that swears he will never own a BMW other than lease.
"There are complaints about BMW and Audi all over the internet. Not interested in one off, anecdotal, internet claims. Every manufacture has failed/ failure units. You don't make at scale at 100% success. My Mercedes that went into limp mode at 22 miles on the odometer is proof of that."
I'm having trouble finding something that cites consistent issues. Can you link some?
"Ya. It was nice. But I never looked over at my friend and said ""I will have one of these before the end of the year"".

That's what happened when I first sat in a 35k model 3 with no intention of buying one."
"It really isn't no. I don't consider leather everywhere ""quality"". Teslas materials are fine. I so don't think 100s of switches is ""quality"". It's just busy. So it comes down to personal taste."
"This makes sense.  If you take a comparable priced ICE car they spend way less on:  
1. R&D - They are doing the same thing everyone has done for the last 100 years.  They are definitely not revolutionizing the entire automobile industry.

2. Programming - No auto-pilot.  No over the air updates.  Just the car with maybe apple-play?

3. Gowth - I don't see BMW, Audi, or Mercedes building battery factories, just leaning on what they have had for years now.

So they take all that money and put it into the only place they can win - comfort.  That make amazing interiors with great comfortable padded seats.

If comfort is your **ONLY** criteria get a comparably priced BMW, Audi, or Mercedes.  If you care about **ANYTHING** else...  get a Tesla."
"Early runs of other manufacturers have similar problems, it's just not as overblown by FUDsters."
"I stopped reading when you implied that there is a  grand conspiracy that somehow adding noise generation is a ploy to stop adoption. I do not recognize tin foil explanations. 

 No a Prius in 2010 does not have significant low speed acceleration. 

I cited the article for data not their opinion. These numbers are beyond a mistake. More research is a good thing but to attempt to invalidate everything because we do not have a specific dB level is dumb."
[deleted]
Exactly. The tesla and interior quality *argument* is so bullshit these days. New versions of Model S and X also have great material quality.
"> If comfort is your ONLY criteria get a comparably priced BMW, Audi, or Mercedes. If you care about ANYTHING else... get a Tesla.

"I never said the numbers are a mistake.

I have said that the numbers do not make it obvious what the problem is.

If having a specific dB level is ""dumb"" then what's the point of having noisemakers on EVs?"
"Not trying to pick on you, just wondering. The article cites some vague issues that generally seem to get fixed over time. 

I'm not saying Teslas don't have issues, but I haven't seen anything that shows they have consistent, widespread, lingering problems."
What do you consider relevant vs irrelevant when buying a car?  What are the factors that you put into the calculation?  Genuinely curious.
"I never said it was dumb. I said that ignoring the data and proposed fixes because we do not have an exact dB is dumb. 

If all the data points to the lack of noise being the problem sure figuring out a minimum dB is best. But implying the entire thing is a tin foil conspiracy and worthless because we do not have said exact dB levels is crazy."
">If all the data points to the lack of noise being the problem

The data does not point to that. The data doesn't actually point to anything, because the data was not binned appropriately to support any hypothesis other than ""EVs are involved in more collisions than ICE cars taken as a whole population.""

If you think my suggestion that ICE/fossil fuel lobby helped draft the legislation is ""tin foil conspiracy"" then you have a lot to learn about how laws are made. It is rare that legislators will find a problem on their own, draft legislation on their own, and implement regulation on their own. It is more common that lobbyists will have a legislation drafted then find ways to convince legislators to adopt their legislation, such as dodgy ""statistics"" that wouldn't pass muster in a high school maths course.

So here we have legislation that asserts that quiet cars are a problem. It doesn't specify how quiet, but it claims to be supported by NHTSA figures showing higher collision rates for one class of cars when the numbers are prepared in a certain way. But the numbers don't show much, and they certainly don't prove that the cause of the collisions is quiet cars. Many of the stories also pull  in commentary from blind people, with the expectation that the credulous audience will simply accept whatever story the cherry picked blind person has to tell (""I lost three canes to electric cars"").

This legislation has absolutely no support in science: I have proposed two of many possible reasons why these numbers might turn up the way they have, and neither of them is, ""electric cars are dangerous because they are quiet.""

I'm not ignoring the data and proposed fixed because ""we do not have an exact dB level."" I'm ignoring the legislation because it claims support from inconclusive data and offers a solution which is targeted to one type of vehicle without credible explanation for that targeting. The lack of an exact dB level is a symptom of the problem which is that nobody has provided a credible link between the supposed elevation of collision risk with the quietness of the vehicles.

At the very least, I'd expect to see the data binned by collisions per mile travelled for every model of car in the population with a correlation between low-speed sound levels and collision risk. If the cause of elevated collision risk was lack of noise I'd expect to see some overlap between *noisy EVs* and *quiet ICE vehicles*. There certainly wouldn't be a clear divide between the two classes of vehicles. Then there could be some determination about what noise level reduces the collision risk to a sufficiently low level, and then the legislation would specify that noise level as a minimum.

If instead the elevated collision risk was due to rates of acceleration from a standing start to 15km/h, I'd expect the overlap to be between slower EVs and ICE vehicles with high ratios in the low gear (more torque, meaning more acceleration from standing start). Then it might be a simple matter of asking manufacturers and operators to enable ""creep mode"" where the car starts moving slowly as soon as the driver takes their foot off the brake.

Also note that for a comprehensive study, there would have to be multiple factors considered. The populations would have to be divided by properties such as brand/model, weight, tyre size, vehicle colour, acceleration from 2km/h to 5km/h (being walking speed), standing start acceleration to 5km/h, noise levels at 0km/h, noise levels at 2km/h, noise levels when accelerating from standing start to 5km/h, etc. The study would have to show that one or more properties are significantly correlated with higher collision rates.

But we don't have binned data. We have a naive binary population of ""EVs"" and ""ICEVs"" accompanied by the assertion that the two populations are exactly and only differentiated by emitted sound levels, with no indication of what acceptable sound levels might be."
"I think we are just going to disagree here.

I think and it seems like the professionals agree that Occam’s razor says the noise is the issue. 

I personally think that assuming this has something to do with low speed acceleration is a non issue. Otherwise would we not see sports cars for the last forever being most likely to hit pedestrians? 

This data was collected and pointed to vehicles that do not even have quick low speed acceleration using 2010 hybrids. That alone invalidates that possibility. 

Having quick acceleration is a driver issue."

"Trade in value to Tesla for my ‘18 LR RWD 13k mile model 3 was 29,800 :("
"after the post I went to see what was available online. Im picking up an SR+ today and I wanted to see if there were any deals on a slightly used 3. I found one that looked perfect BUT upon closer inspection I noticed the driver side door was a slightly different shade from the other doors/car. Even though it says clean title, clean title just means it could have been in an accident that was never reported or it was some minor damage that the previous owner fixed. None the less I decided to keep the totally new car. YMMV for everyone else but I personally don't like things like that. It was definitely a sweet deal. It's a midnight silver 2018 LR AWD with about 6500 miles.

Link: [https://www.tesla.com/used/5YJ3E1EB4JF074992](https://www.tesla.com/used/5YJ3E1EB4JF074992)

Check out driver side door."
"I haven't seen anyone mention the crazy AWD and M3P deals that were also posted. Tesla seem to have listed a whole bunch of these (100+) around 1AM this morning. They all sold within minutes. I've seen AWDs for $34-35k and a red M3P for $35k! Bananas!

Here is an album on some of the listings:

*cries in overpaid LR RWD*
Is there a better way to search their new or used car inventory? I’m limited to searching based on zip code + 200 miles.  Thanks.
"I first heard about this on the Tesla showrooms deal Facebook page. There was a P3D with 3k miles for $35k. And a blue LR AWD 3 for $34900 and 300 miles. Unreal prices and hope they went to good homes! Both those stood out to me and on the website it said they still qualify for hov stickers.

Maybe these are cars people returned in the 7 day window?"
"So there is still...what, tax, destination and document fees? So how much less expensive is it really? Am I missing something?"
awd for only 5k less than what i paid after tax incentives after waiting in line for 2.5 years for LR RWD. nice! lol
"I bought my March 2018 LR RWD for $52,500 net of tax credits. It has upgraded wheels, silver paint and EAP and 23,000 miles.

Based  on Teslas website, I doubt I would get more than $37,500 for it. About $15k depreciation in 16 months.

I think we are witnessing the SR+ effect. I didn’t think the $35k car with cloth seats, manual windows and no autopilot and 220 miles range was going to affect my cars resale value that much. 

But the SR+ has the same interior, better than expected range, free auto steer... and cost just $39k"
"Damn, I was going to buy this. That went fast."
"Near me they are all 45-46K plus with 3K-15K miles.

While I would have liked the LR, as a second electric car for our family, the SR+ worked, was slightly cheaper, and we got the tax credit.... 

We use our Model S with free supercharging for our longer trips anyhow. So overall not too upset. With no tax credit and paying about 2-3K more, it's still a 5-6K swing vs a new SR+ and used LR."
Oh well. I don't regret buying mine. I considered it a bargain at the time and still do.
Saw a dual motor near me going for 39k with 6k miles 😫
So much for resale value.  My P3D is going to be worth half what I paid by the 1 year pt.  Between Tesla dropping the price $15k and the this.
FSD would still push it close to $50k anyway.
Still a killer deal.
These seem to be customer returns
"The cheapest used LR AWD Model 3 I see is [This 2018](https://www.tesla.com/used/5YJ3E1EB9JF054043) for $44k + the $2k delivery fee, So $46k for a year old car w/ 8k miles on it.   

A new LR AWD is $48k + a $1200 delivery fee. But you get the $1875 tax credit, total cost is $47,315.    

I'd much rather pay the extra $1315 and get a brand new car."
Can someone explain to me what steals are? :)
"Damn, that's insane. If anyone sees a deal like this with the Black exterior and White interior let me know. I am in the market to buy but just kind of waiting for the right car to fall into place.  I live in South Florida."
would it be easiest to try and find one of these steals by calling up the sales advisors??
Where are you located? I couldn't find anything close to this price for the same specs
"I wanna think that these are either sold cars financed by Tesla that were repossessed, or demos that were in accidents that were minor enough to not have to be disclosed but where the sensible thing to do was to take ownership and claim the tax credit and then sell it as used."
That’s pretty much my exact car I want to buy! Still saving money though
"There was a long range in SF this morning for 34k with 17k miles. It was also signed, but it gone now, someone came up."
"Sorry but anyone who buys a brand new 50K+ car is a chump. I just bought a 56K Audi for 38K. It’s only 11 months old, 15K miles, last model year,  absolutely perfect condition. That’s the way to buy a car. Whoever owned it before me incinerated $18,000 in less than a year. That’s like $1500 a month. Yeah I’ll catch depreciation too, but not at half the rate. 

I will never, ever understand why anyone is okay with being the chump that literally vaporizes his money on a brand new car. Like the guys that buy a brand new M3, don’t even get a great deal, and then trade it in or sell it for 50% of the value in 3 years. You might as well just throw $100 bills out the window while you’re driving. It blows my mind that BMW can sell a single vehicle

Edit
Wow I thought I’d get verbally abused for this opinion, thanks for being cool, guys :)"
"FINALLY. It seemed strange to me that we weren’t seeing any used vehicles come up for sale with more than 500 miles on them.  I’ve been patiently waiting for this to start happening.... 32k out the door works out similarly to my current payment + gas costs - it probably won’t be for another 9-12 months, but here’s to hoping we start seeing some SR+ in that range!!"
[deleted]
300 miles. Must be an issue with the car with this discount. Paint defects or something like that. No reason to discount so much.
What a Fantastic deal! I thought 40k for mid range with those miles was a good deal and was looking for that. There could be other reasons.....
"For a LW AWD what sort of age and mileage do you think will be needed to take price down to 25-30k?

Im guessing 4 years with 40-50k miles."
"Saw this at around 5am. I was having a very serious conversation with myself all morning trying to decide if I was going to buy this or not.

I didn't. I'm sad."
I'm looking in the north east and can't find a sweet deal like that
"I’m not seeing big discounts compared to brand new

White 18” wheels AWD white interior is $48,900 new and I’m finding 4 used around $45XXX two of which have over 10k miles."
Still regularly priced in the Bay Area.
"April 2019 I bought a new inventory AWD LR white with white interior, AP, aero wheels. Paid $46.6k, and will get $3.8k fed tax credit and state rebate of $2.5k (neither of the rebates apply to used vehicles). So after rebates, final cost is $40.3k, which is spot on to what Tesla is asking for a used one."
"It is likely that this was just a pricing error. All used prices have returned to regular order.

See more info here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/crogps/regarding\_last\_nights\_used\_car\_extravaganza/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/crogps/regarding_last_nights_used_car_extravaganza/)"
What location is this? My location only has new inventory that's same price or more in some cases than custom.
"I saw 2018 LR, sports wheels, and only 2k miles for $36k. 

I couldn't have clicked buy it fast enough, however it was not available.

I started looking around and saw some other good deals, but when I click buy, it was a different price then the previous page."
Can the transport on used 3’s be included in the financing or is it cash?
How do I search everywhere and not just a zip code?  This is frustrating.
Wish there were more in the used market in Australia.
Dang I was just looking for my wallet to buy this. Too bad someone already bought it
here’s a tip: for all you that already have a model 3 (including myself) move on with what you paid and don’t look back. It’s still going to be the best money you spent for decades
"Damn, need to move to the US..."
My car was 2500$ and puts up the same numbers however it is not as nearly ecological
Would take this with a grain of salt. This same car and specs with more Miles is 6000 to 8000 more. High chance this one was in an accident.
"Even with the good deals on used cars, I think $38-40k for an SR+ is an incredible value. I’ve had two BMWs and this car is just so much better, between the tech, overall experience and acceleration, not to mention the (much) lower cost of ownership."
Just found a similar car in my area with the same specs besides it’s being grey for $41k
I'm hoping my next car will be a used Model Y.
"How do you search site wide without zip code, or at least expand the radius"
Damn
[deleted]
I think I might have been able to talk my wife into this one.... damn that’s impressive. But I’m expecting to see more drops with time obviously. But I want one now!
Can't wait for the 'used' 3 inventory in the UK 🇬🇧. I'll probably be waiting about 1 year
$8k discount because of 331 miles...
 I couldn’t find this on ev-cpo.com but this is rare and a steal but you won’t find many like this. Cheapest AWD i found used on there was 44k with 8k miles on it that’s more of the norm.
"It's because if you trade it into them, it can be perfect condition LR AWD and theyll still only offer like 33k for it

"As far as tax credit goes, you still can get the tax credit as long as this car hasn't been registered. Was this a test drive vehicle? A loaner by Tesla?

300 miles is nothing. My guess would be that it wasn't registered to an individual and was used by Tesla. If that's the case, tax credit is still eligible."
Makes me sad when people trade in a Tesla. What didn’t they like?
If I tell you guys how much I bought my Tesla model S you're gonna hate me forever
"I got one of the early RWD LR 3's. Don't even care what prices are currently I'm happy with my car and when I got it. I signed on to pay what I was going to pay. I would still rather have the car for over a year and a half now than barely getting one and getting it ""cheaper"". People ignore the fact of your happiness and having the car already. Yes it's cheaper now, bit I'm glad I have Enhanced Autopilot, a configuration that doesn't exist anymore, LTE mobile data for free. This is like a new phone release and people being upset that it's cheaper the following year."
I dont see that as a steal.  I got a LR RWD in March after the price drop for 44k.  Blue and white interior was 47k.  Well I guess that is Awd.  But as it's used I dont see it as a steal.

"I bought my Model S in september 2017, and it cost me 120.000 euro.  I could buy a brand new one, with better range, better screen, better suspension and faster charging today for around 95.000 euro

I'm not complaining... this is what we should all expect from Tesla: making EV's more affordable on a continuous basis.  You bought a car and you took a depreciation hit, like everyone else in the world.  Yet you enjoy the car on a daily basis, and probably wouldn't to go with another car in the future.  So really, stop complaining."

Yeah same here. Mine is 066xxx oof
How do you know what's old or new? Is it the last 6 digits?
That car was made during Q4 2018.   My wife has the same config + FSD and her VIN was in the 64xxx range.

"Is buying a Tesla going to be like buying solar panels, where there's an obvious point in time where you should hold off a few years because the technology is about to go mainstream and five years from now you'll basically get the same car, from different manufacturers, for half the price? meanwhile if you buy now, five years from now you would't have even paid the interest component of the loan for the car yet."

Edit: She’s gone already ☠️"
Welp. It’s gone now. What was the price?
"Looks like the clear coat is over top of the signatures, too.  Pretty cool, actually."
"Aaaaand... it’s gone.

> We are sorry, the vehicle you are trying to look at is no longer available ..."
How was it all wheel drive and low 200’s? They didn’t even offer AWD early on.
[deleted]
"> Don't buy it for resale value.

But Elon said these will be appreciated assets.

/s"
But muh appreciating car
This depreciation is the same as any automobile.  Once you title a car they lose 20 to 30%.
Nah it’s just an old model and that’s how cars work
[deleted]
I look forward to the price eventually “dropping” to the originally advertised $35k.
"Trade in values are always low. There’s a lot of costs in selling a trade in, it’s not pure profit."
"Yeah they offered me $30k for mine with 7,500 miles, when KBB private party value is $44-46k. Clearly they’re not interested in taking trades at the moment."
I was just trying to figure this out. Same car and about the same mileage. This makes me a little sad.  I’d really like to have awd but those numbers are pretty bad.
"Yea, here’s a little chestnut for you. My daughter was hit and the car was nearly totaled. Not quite though...insurance company fixed it instead of totaling it to the tune of $9800 on a car valued at about $14000. When I asked them just total it because I’ll never be able to sell it when the Carfax shows the accident, they said “oh don’t worry, we don’t have to report it and it won’t show on the Carfax.” So I could sell this as though it never had an accident even though it was nearly totaled. This is a major insurance company."
"Clean title just means it was never salvaged, not that it was never in an accident. You can have a car in a major accident have a clean title if it was never deemed a total loss then salvaged. Salvaged title is what you get after the vehicle has been written off then someone decides to repair it anyway."
That's pretty noticable.
"Clean title means there are no title issues. Not that it hasn’t been in an accident. 

Stuff like outstanding liens, taxi use, flood vehicles are what would make a title “dirty”"
And.....gone.
A clean title only means it hasn't been written of as salvage. The plus side is if they were this bad at matching paint you can be reasonably sure the damage was limited to the door!
Appears somebody bought it anyway. It's gone.
happen to get a screenshot of it?  i guess when someone buys it its gone from the site
Clean title does not mean accident free
It's gone; how much was it?
"I've been looking at a TM3 since they reduced the credit. Wanted to buy a used LR but all the prices were outrageous like $1-1.5k off a new one + no tax incentives. I ordered a SR+ Tuesday, picked up Friday, and NOW they reduce prices. Too bad I love my SR+ or I would have buyers remorse."
Also looks.like water is leaking into the frunk.
Looks like a cop car (contrast is really noticeable)
Aaaand gone
"That’s weird. If they’re selling in minutes at 1in the morning, I have to believe they’d sell for more."
Wow sold so quick!
Damn cheap as fuck
"Lost a job, medical bills, unexpected relocation, natural disaster, death in the family... who knows. There are probably a dozen reasons."
"Just for fun I requested a trade-in quote and Tesla offered $28,300 for my base 2019 SR+ black, 4,378 miles."
Wouldn't be surprised if a lot of these are canceled leases or returned for refund.
It could be people giving it back within the 1 week period.
Demo cars will eventually make their way into inventory
[deleted]
"Happens all the time in the automotive world. Usually with something this new its ""my spouse hates it"" or ""I thought I wanted an electric car...""

Usually end up loosing 30% or more"
"I don’t know, but when I got my M3 dual motor a few months ago as a temp car until I get my MY I asked the guy who helped me how much they’d give me for trade-in value on the M3 for the MY if I only put on about 15,000 miles. He said $30,000. That is absolutely not worth it. Lol."
"1 week, less than 1000 mile trade in. There is no loss involved."
And it's gone
That one has no pictures. The one I saw had a lot of pictures.
Wow seriously...
"Doesn't Tesla now do nationwide shipping for $2,000?"
"Great question. I don’t mind flying into CA and driving it back to Texas for that price. 

Anyone else done that from out of state?"
Why are there signatures on it?
Why did you trade it in?
Good ole musky
This all relies on robo taxi existing. It doesn't yet.
He should back that up by offering to refund any difference between MSRP and actual resale ;)
You guys are silly. He is saying this because you are buying a self driving vehicle. The vehicle will appreciate if full self driving becomes a thing. It is ridiculous to say that it won't.
"I mean if you drive it around for a few years and sell it at half its original value you still might come out ahead compared to an ICE when it comes to total cost (gas, maintenance, depreciation, etc)."

[deleted]
Yea and your got a 5.5k refund from Tesla (unless you kept FUSC for some stupid reason) as well as 5.25k more fed refund. The price difference now vs then is about 5k
"I'd be lying if I said I'm not concerned. Tesla is the only entity destroying resale values right now; if Tesla hadn't adjusted prices, they'd likely hold value as well as Wranglers or Tacomas.

My biggest concern is all the dealers who paid well for early 3s only to have Tesla crater the values will think ""whelp, not falling for *that* again!"" and only offer lowball amounts from here on out."
Yeah. Same. I got my P3D Sept. 2018 for $83K out the door.
Hahaha never buy early with Tesla
[deleted]
I bought this exact car in November with FSD for $60K.
What?
"Not at all close to $50K. They sold a whole slew of Performance Model 3's for under $35K so even with FSD you're looking at $40K or so for the same car you bought with FSD.

The sale priced cars were an absolute bargain. Here are some cars that were part of the sale but all sold quick: https://m.imgur.com/a/xGnYRtD
In the context of Teslas or in general?
"Or cars that people returned within the 7-day/1,000 mile grace period after purchase"
"So true, honestly they should just stop selling new cars all together and only sell used cars."
"Totally agree, but let me ask where or from who did you buy the Audi ?"
No
"All of the prices went back to regular, it was just a random price drop from 11 PM PST to 7 AM PST last night.

All the prices went back up to normal.
Why are you even here?
"The BMW M3 comes a lot in this subreddit, it seems. Makes sense, since even Tesla is selling them: [https://www.tesla.com/inventory/used/m3](https://www.tesla.com/inventory/used/m3)."
Used = Registered. You can find demo units listed as New cars that have discounts + tax credit eligibility.
Maybe it was Repo’d?

"A basic model is but when you add color and long range, etc these cost money."
You can order it over the phone.
"Still exists and you get way more value than was ever promised. Steal of a price. Software locked 220 mile range means you can charge to 100% every night without worrying much about battery degradation. Pearl white was a $2k option but it's free now. You also basically get the PUP package minus a few speakers, disabled rear heated seats and missing satellite view maps/slackr streaming. You just go to Tesla showroom or call you place an order."
Depends on a lot of things. You should at least be fine till \~200k miles if you maintain recommended charging habits and usage.
The cars being referenced here sold out quickly. Here are some examples of the sale priced cars: https://m.imgur.com/a/xGnYRtD
"I've got 150k on a 5 year old Tesla battery that still get 90% of original range, and loss over the last year has been close to zero."

"I'm sorry hol up. ONLY 10k cheaper? It's got 300 miles on it.

Didn't know Richie rich was in this sub"
If you factor in tax credits this is basically free blue paint cheaper. Bought mine the of June 19
"Eh, a year ago they were also still giving out upgraded interior and sound system, and free internet for life, plus free supercharging for performance, and a free car charger with two referrals."
You dont get a tax credit  on used....
1000 miles? What on Earth did they do with that car prior to selling it to you?
Same exact situation on my delivery.
"Doesn't make sense there is a law I'm pretty sure, New cars can only have up to 500 miles"
"Oh, man. That sucks. I got mine with a discount of 2500  because it was a dealer model with 312 miles on it. My VIN is only about 6000 higher than this one, and I bought early Spring 2019, so maybe that has something to do with the bigger break."
"You get out of here with your common sense!

I’m in the same boat. December 2016 (MCU1 AP2 Model S). I’m more than happy to have contributed. Cars are depreciating assets, and always have been. 

I get the impression a lot of the upset people are buying their very first new car, and unaccustomed to depreciation and wrangling with the fact that some people get a better deal.

At least with Tesla, everyone who buys at the same time as you gets the same deal, which I’ll take over sitting for five hours going back and forth on financing terms."
Thank you for your sanity. You got what you paid for and enjoy it. So many owners here seem to spend their time scrutinizing every price/spec change and getting upset (sometimes even outraged!) about what they “missed out on” or how Tesla has cheated them. I don’t get it.
Yeah I’m terrified about this prospect. As long as I drive mine for 10 years I’ll be ok?
"Grab your vin. The last 6 digits (it maybe 5, im not certain) are unique to your car. So to say, if your vin ends in 042781, and this cars ends in 093641, then this car is produced after yours and therefore newer."
"Good point, but you’re putting a lot of value in homelink."
Why don't newer cars have homelink?

"They just miswrote the price. It sold for $47,000"
There were several LR 3s and even a LR AWD at 3am Pacific standard time for under $35k and with under 3k miles on them. Even a red P3D for $40k and 3k miles. From the Tesla deals Facebook page the prices are being honored.
"Mine was hand built.  Given my experience, it is not a good thing."
And those seats are not as plush either
Wait.... They don't have alcantara anymore?
"$34,700"
It was LR RWD
"Wait, wot?"
"Yea, for him."
"I love Elon, but it pisses me off when he claims buying a Tesla will pay for itself. That's absolutely not true and he's basing it on perfect conditions on an untested market that is probably at least 5-10 years away"
"and some will appreciate more than others.

~~/s~~"
They probably will over the next 30 years.
"I know you have the /s on there, but even if he was correct, it's only if you bought FSD already or soon."
Or you know... get a used Tesla.
I hope you bought a used ICE. Anyone buying a truly new ICE right now is in for disappointment when they try to sell 3-5 years from now.
What did you choose? That’s quite a low depreciation number.
[deleted]
"You can get it for 35 if you call, but it has less features"
Trading in your car is like trading in games at gamestop
Like what costs? Upgrading the car to hardware v3 upgrade for $100? unlocking FSD and auto park for $0? cleaning the car for $30?  :)
"Well... judging by the prices of the used inventory on Tesla.com, good luck finding a private party willing to pay $45k for a long range RWD"
I actually went to Carmax a couple months ago and they offered $37k. I didn’t sell.
"I was in a minor accident in my last car. I didn’t want it on carfax because it’s such small repair but an accident on carfax is damning. 

I asked my insurance, they don’t report. 

I asked repair place, they don’t report. 

Later I check value if my car. -2000 due to accident history. 

My guess is the other insurance reported it. In fact, I can only imagine that carfax is paying for reports so why wouldn’t the other insurance?

Kind of annoying. Should of just paid for the repair out of pocket."
"Did they also get out of paying you deminished value?  

You're not still with that insurance company, are you?"
Doesn’t surprise me at all.
What badasses.
Why not say the name of the company?
"Agreed, after a while I was like this is pretty damn noticeable."
Gotcha.
Taxi use shows up on a title? Why is that a ding?
It will make someone happy.
Yes gotcha
"39,100"
My delivery is scheduled for 2:30pm today.  I also think wife and I are going to be totally happy with it.
Oh! That’s a good suggestion as well but it should have been on both sides
"They were all sold afaik. I saw the thread on the Tesla Showroom Deals FB groups and several people pulled the trigger. 

We’re just waiting to see if it was a pricing error and if they will actually honor the price."
The medical bills reason is a bit sad. You shouldn't have to sell anything for health care in a developed country.
Performance envy.  Gotta get that P
"Those folks should be selling, not trading to Tesla. Trades to Tesla are only towards new cars."
Also they’re rich and the money doesn’t matter to them and they traded in for a model X.
"I’ll buy it from you for $28,300


edit: how about $28.30? Works better for me"
That's not the actual cost...
"I live in the south and I don't need AWD, so I'm hoping they'll be plenty of cheaper used RWD when I get ready to buy. Now I just need a better paying job. Heh."
Yes
Can't take delivery in CA without paying tax there unfortunately.
What? Hell no id stop buying stock immediately
It is ridiculous to say that you can determine future market value of a product that has never existed ever.
"Except you don't buy a self driving vehicle lol, you buy a normal vehicle and then you buy another vehicle afterwards that can drive itself"
It will only appreciate in value if they stop making them.
"Sure, but that’s not what an “appreciating asset” is."
"Thank you.  For some reason it auto populates the local ZIP Code, and deleting it forces me to input a ZIP Code. Thank you for the link, anyhow."
And tax works in favor of cheaper cars
"Really? Geez, I got screwed lol"
"I’m still happy though. Not complaining. Resale value is one thing, another is reliability. Of course now that I realize I am going to have to stick to this car for many years I really hope reliability is going to be good (so far it’s been pretty good)"
"Small fix: It was $5,000 not $5,500 to give up FUSC."
"Dealers price vehicles based off auction pricing and their desired markup. They’ll give you UP TO auction pricing for trade in

As far as resale,  I bought a Jeep Gladiator instead of waiting for the T truck for that reason. If I own the JT for two years and decide to switch to the T truck, I’ll be out maybe $8k regardless of how many miles I put on it"
"A. No you didnt, unless you are including taxes and registration which dont count towards resale

B. I bought the same car (fully loaded with FSD P3D+ in September 2018). The same car now is a mere 5k cheaper once you actually include the federal tax incentive drop and the Tesla refund. I may have paid ""80k"" but the instant I purchased it was worth 65k due to 7.5k fed break + 5.5k refund + 2.5k California incentive 

People just cant do math. Oh and I also saved about $1500 in gas by owning it"
Holy Christ. Glad I only went with AWD at the same time.
Same price as a new car.
He said FSD WOULD STILL PUSH IT CLOSER TO $50K ANYWAY.
"Adding FSD for $6-7k pushes the car’s price, with tax, towards $50k. I’m getting downvoted for stating the obvious? Okay."
"Wow, those are crazy deals!"
Is there a way to get alerted to deals like this?
Both i guess…
"Maybe, but I'd think those wouldn't be sold as ""used"" if they were never titled."
"Used car dealer. A rare find, it was actually legit. Likely one of the most highly rated dealers in the south"
Bummer
Can’t argue with that.
"I'd easily let it sell for 3 BTC lol

I'd never tell"
"I went a few months ago, but they were only taking orders for a substantial add on package which came out to about $53,000."
what do they look like underneath?  plain old steel rims?
"$10,000 in depreciation on a used car is not in any way unheard of."
This whole sub is richie rich😂
Any reason why this person wouldn’t just text drive and return for full price? Or would the intention of buying and selling so new to get the tax credit? Trying to understand why there would be so many under 500mi for sale.
$10K depreciation on a car of this price is basically the expected drop. It does suck but that's kind of what you get when you buy a $50K+ new car of any brand.
…where else would you expect to find Richie?
Federal tax credit on Teslas is peanuts now anyway.
You meant you don’t get a tax *credit* on used
That’s what he’s saying. You factor in the tax credit on the new one and this is ‘only’ 10k cheaper
GOD I wish that was true where I’m from. 🤣 Where do you live where you don’t pay taxes on used cars?
"Everytime they ""sell"" the car, it's not actually filed as sold until after the return period. So potentially it was a test drive car, or ""sold"" and returned one or more times. 

Their adjustment is $1/mile, so most of the time it's some nice easy savings, but it also feels like it may not be worth it if you can pay $1k more and get a new, untouched car."
"Yeah, my plan was always to drive the car into the ground, so...I got that goin’ for me, I guess."
"This is often, but not necessarily, true.   Tesla has occasionally registered very large batches of VINs (30-50k) and then makes a color / wheel / awd/rwd / interior color run in groups within that batch.    Sometimes they'll go back and finish off a batch of VINs that had a lower VIN# and lower volume production run (for that particular config).

For example:     My 88xxx VIN (red, 19"", awd, black int) was produced a couple weeks earlier than my wife's 64xxx (blue, 18"", awd, black int)"
I assume I should be happy as my VIN is 494xxx meaning it's quite new?
[deleted]
No longer standard.
They made it an optional install (300 dollars I gather)
"🏅

Poor man's gold"
I used to work for Tesla and can definitely recognize few names. Love this!
Beautiful color.   What is it ?
I figured!!
"Woah this is awesome for me. That means I'll be able to get in one a lot sooner then I thought!

Edit: by sooner I mean 3-4 years lol"
"Yeah, I would imagine they have a litany of issues. I think it's cool as a collector car but as a daily driver it would probably be frustrating. I feel like the first couple hundred customers got basically the same car as the beta cars that we saw driving around for testing. Hopefully as employees, there were decent discounts."
"Yeah that's what I thought, hand built and first 200 sounds cool until you remember it's Tesla."
True. The 2nd gen are much nicer.
"No, they haven't had Alcantara headliners for a long time. It was only the first couple thousand cars if I remember correctly."
"Assuming it's reliable, I would give zero shits about build quality for that price."
Gotcha that makes sense. I guess the screenshot on reddit just had a mistake in it.
Agreed. I get his point - if (big IF) FSD goes as planned then it is conceivable that the cars will appreciate. But he should temper his claims to be reasonable.
"I mean the ONLY condition neccessary for it to be true is that they can get FSD completely autonomous with the hardware they have or hardware that is easily replaceable (like the FSD computer). 

If they can actually do it, I think it's almost a fact that they'd increase in value."
"To me, it’s just plain and simple business. Make white lies selling a reality that already justifies pre disposed human lust for new and exciting experiences. His job as a ceo is to activate that.

But basic appreciation and depreciation still exists in a working economy driven society.

Do I apply these realizations before purchasing. Hell no I am weak willed consumer. But being aware for myself, is enough"
"Answer right here. Fear of depreciating asset should mean the consumer should purchase used, regardless of being EV or ICE."
[deleted]
You could clean your car
"The car occupies space which costs money to lease. Even if they own the site it still has a cost in that it’s offsetting space for other profitable stock. There’d be labour in inspections, warranty cost. If you think it costs $130 you’ve obviously never operated a successful business."
"Yep, only worth $43k. KBB can’t keep up."
"> Later I check value if my car. -2000 due to accident history. 

That's when you go back you your insurance and file a new claim for diminished value."
"I get the feeling the body shops get something for reporting to Carfax, had one run out and try to snap a pic of my VIN before I even talked to them, I told them to fuck right off and left."
Sounds like two parties didn't do what they had to. You should report accidents like this.
Always ask to speak to the diminished value department. $2k is enough to request compensation for diminished value.
"The shop doesn’t have to “report”. Some of the shops are opted into data sharing agreements with their estimating/shop management software vendors. A lot of times the shops don’t event know it, but Carfax will get the data this way. I got an *estimate* from two body shops to see how much it cost to repair a scratch on my bumper and it got reported as “damage” to Carfax. Neither shop says they report and I didn’t file a claim with my insurance as it was below my deductible. I didn’t even provide my insurance info to the shops.

Carfax, as far as I can tell, isn’t regulated like credit reporting under the FCRA. Getting this info out of them was near impossible because they claim it is a “trade secret” how they get data and therefore aren’t obligated to give up their source or substantiate data in their reports - even in the case of an error. 

I’m not passing judgement on the value of Carfax product to buyers and sellers, but I’d think the repair shops (and vendors) should have the duty to disclose their data sharing and sourcing practices. Carfax should also be required to do the same."
">Kind of annoying. Should've ~~of~~ just paid for the repair out of pocket.

FTFY"
"I dunno, felt oddly disparaging."
"Now if someone was planning on wrapping the car, totally worth it."
"At least on ice cars, heavy idle time, driven like a taxi, likely dirty etc"
My guess is the abnormal wear and tear are the concern.
"I'm sure you both will. Good luck! From trading in my truck to leaving with the car it took <1hr. Never spent less time in a ""dealership"" in my life."
It’s sad how this isn’t widely accepted purely because our U.S healthcare industry spends billions annually into marketing and lobbying to keep the republicans spouting opposition against Healthcare For All/Medicare For America.

Exactly.
"A car that can drive other people and make $30k a year won't be purchasable for $50k. Anyone that wants to invest money will buy them up and kill the supply. Tesla Will not sell the car for $50k once Full self driving is a thing. They might not even sell the car at all.

You are right that I don't know the future value of the market, but it doesn't take a lot of math to figure out the car can make $30k a year. it doesn't take a lot of brain power to figure out a car that can make $30k a year is an appreciating asset when purchased at $50k."
What are you even trying to say?
"> A car that can drive other people and make $30k a year won't be purchasable for $50k. Anyone that wants to invest money will buy them up and kill the supply. Tesla Will not sell the car for $50k once Full self driving is a thing. They might not even sell the car at all.

Luckily NJ has no sales tax on EVs."

"Depends, Tesla later also gave checks refunding sales tax on the $5k for me. So I got a 2nd check of around $400"
🙄🙄🙄
For me the price dropped 6k euro after 8 days of ownership. No tax incentive changes. That bummed me out...
“Out the door” means including all those things.  You have to give them that much money to get the car.  The incentives come back later...
Shhhh.  Ruining the narrative.

I don’t care about fsd right now
I didn’t down vote you. What is fsd?
Yes makes sense
"Pay for ev-cpo.com premium account, go to Teslamotorsclub website frequently on the model 3 forum, or Facebook Tesla showroom deals page"
"A ""steal"" in the context of buying things is when the price is so low compared to the normal price such an item might sell for (there has to be good value as well not just low price) that it's as if you stole the item from the seller. In the context of Teslas that's a practically brand new (in terms of miles), non-standard color, long range, AWD Model 3 for basically the price of a standard range plus."
I looked into it and it's a gray area on whether you can call a returned car a new car. Tesla seems to have switched their opinion and now seems to think they shouldn't try selling the returned cars as new. Up until recently there were no Used Tesla's with so few miles listed but sometime in mid July they started listing used cars with very few miles. I expect the 7 day return policy to go away real soon.
[deleted]
"It's hard to compare depreciation on electric vehicles. The federal tax credit and it's cascading value throws a wrench into these things. For example, in April this year, I bought a new inventory AWD LR white with white interior for 46.6 - 3.8 fed - 2.5 state = $40.3k total after incentives."
"Three. Hundred. Miles. Pretty sure I've seen ""new"" cars with more on the odometer."
"I use to trade my Toyota for a new one every two years for ~$5,000  depreciation is very ymmv thing. Dealerships will bend over backwards inflating trade in values to make a sale"
Doesn’t Elon say there is no depreciation though?
"I still owe 62,000 on my p3d that is one year old, I’m guessing if I traded it in I might get 45k? Maybe?on the plus side, if my car continues depreciating at 25,000 a year, at least I won’t have to worry about trading it in, because it’ll be worthless in 2 years, lol.

To be slightly more fair, it wouldn’t look so bad if I had put the 12,500 in federal tax and tesla supercharging for life rebate towards my loan, instead of towards guns and ammo. But at least guns don’t depreciate."
It's unheard of on a car that only has 331 miles on it. 3000 maybe is a different story. 300?
"This car may have been a return.   There was a thread on TMC where Tesla sold a fellow a previously returned car as new inventory and it turned out the car had been registered.   Tesla was unable to fix the prior registration with the DMV so bought the car back from him.   [https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/3872530/](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/3872530/)

&#x200B;

I am guessing the combo of 7 day return periods and Tesla's general lack of organization led to other mistakes similar to the above thread, and now those cars have to be sold as used.   I would guess the whole ""7 days to return"" policy will be short lived."
You don't get a federal tax credit on used vehicles. You still pay taxes on the sale
"Pretty sure Oregon doesn’t have tax on used cars? 

Don’t hold me to that.. but as a Canadian who is taxed up the yingyang, I was surprised how almost nothing was taxed in Oregon!"
"Yeah I would have been more mad if the car didn't look perfect and I didn't really prefer the cash haha. They said it hadn't been bought previously but couldn't tell me the history, maybe test drives? Maybe relocated (though I don't know why it would be driven, not shipped)"
"Yeah they told me it hadn't and couldn't have been sold and returned with their system, but they also didn't seem to have their shit together so who knows..."
Yup. What year is yours?
"Good point.  I’ll need to take you with me when I try to try to trade my 3 in for a Performance X.

Maybe I’ll throw a couple extra homelinks in the trunk just in case."
"I'm glad you said that. I was confused last night when I was browsing the Tesla website and they were charging $300 for Homelink. I thought that was all setup cost since my Model 3 came with it standard last year. I wish my Homelink could transmit out the back, too, since I reverse up my driveway and it doesn't always trigger."
"Tesla paint code PMSS

"I have number 431. I’m two months in to ownership and it’s been flawless. Surprisingly so. There are a few things that stand out such as some body bonding that was fully sanded down in the trunk area before final paint work but I’m nitpicking. The car is exceptional and other than the Gen 1 seats, I have no complaints.

My first 2013 Model S on the other hand... yikes. Lovely car and everything that was Tesla specific was perfect. No drivetrain issues at all but that was at a time that top tier vendors weren’t taking Tesla seriously. So all the ancillary systems were second rate and it showed."
Agreed I just picked up my p3d it’s the stealth version 2019 car i compared it to an early build 3 a friend has.  The build quality in the newer car is immediately apparent.
Lol only had mine for a week but thought I had it. Getting it back from the shop next Saturday
I think reliability and build quality are related. 😅
"It’s still not conceivable. Let’s say FSD is solved in 3 years (LOL)... by that point, we probably have 450-500 mile EVs and the cars bought today drop in value. Elon is just talking out of his ass."
FSD is not the only condition. Elon made claims on how much your car will earn. Nobody knows what the rideshare market will look like in 5-10 years. Your location makes a huge difference in possible revenue. Nobody knows what the competition will look like wither. Nobody knows if there will be demand. Nobody knows how much supply there will be from Tesla owners. It's completely absurd to make any claims about revenue for a business that doesn't even exist yet.
"If you got it from a dealership, odds are you paid enough that it’s already depreciated way more than your goal.

When I was looking to buy a specific used ICE car, seems like dealerships wanted 30k (or more), for a car I could buy private party for low 20s.

Even the low tier used only lots are usually asking 6-8k for cars you can buy for 3-4k. 

But they get away with these prices, as most people don’t have 20k in cash, or are unaware their bank would give them personal financing. 

Anyone who buys from a dealership, even used, and tries to resell, is about to be in for a very unpleasant shock.

Even at private party prices, you’re unlikely to be beating that sort of depreciation unless you literally bought near the bottom of the depreciation curve (7 years and 100k miles), and only on desirable vehicles (No economy cars or SUVs).

TLDR: Unless you bought a rare Porsche, Toyota Tacoma, or Subaru WRX, or something 15 years old, all cars depreciate like shit. Just enjoy your car."

Interesting. Assumed there’s some kind of statute of limitations regarding claim timing.
"Why? Carfax is a business not a regulating body. No one should have to report to them. 

The system is flawed. A no frame damage crash devalued my car more than the cost of a repair and if no one saw the car fax they wouldn’t even be able to tell it was in an accident."
Thanks.
I guess. I would probably always wonder how bad the damage was. What issues might arise. Probably none but I don’t think I want the risk. Knowing is half the battle.
Yeah had the same idea.
Oh when I picked up my X it was even faster than that’s
"That income estimate is total BS. I’ve detailed it before, but the market will never absorb that much capacity at the price needed to earn that."
"I did not buy a self driving vehicle. I bought a normal electric vehicle. I have to pay extra to activate its self driving features, then additional extra if I want the ""full set"" of self driving features. I have to take faith that these features will appreciate over time for it to ""appreciate"" in value, but those are extras added on, not part of the base car.

If I don't buy the added extras (self driving) today, then the price will go up and I'll have to pay more to ""access"" my ""appreciating asset"". My car is not going up in value, I have to pay tesla to 'increase' its value (though whether it actually increases the value is dubious; will tesla offer me more for trade-in if I've bought self driving functionality? if not, then why say it's appreciating in value lol)"
"Yeah im new jersey, was just thinking if this applies to used though."

I see. There's no sales tax on EVs where I'm from.
"That hasn't been the case for 2 months. Pre or post, both $6k and supposed to have another $1k bump yesterday."

"Ah i see, thanks a lot buddy :)"
Those wheels on the right are snazzy as hell.  Had no idea those were under those wheel covers.
If you have SCE as your electric company you might be eligible for another $1k
Your state gives a tax credit for electric vehicles? I thought it was only fed!
hm you got the AWD LR white on white only 46.6K while right now it's 48.9K.  Is that right?
"Doesn’t really matter though does it? If it’s been titled before. For one, someone already got the tax credit on it, so it’s depreciated by that much alone. People don’t seem to understand the “depreciated when you drive it off the lot” concept."
"My ""new"" car had almost 500 miles on the odometer because it was a manufacturer show vehicle. But that also took $11k off the price so it was definitely worth it."
"Toyotas do much better on depreciation than luxury cars; you'd probably not do nearly that well with an Lexus, for example even though it's the same manufacturer."
"Yeah, try that with a Mercedes!"
Toyotas and Hondas have very low depreciation because they are bulletproof cars that run forever.  That said it sounds like you got a really good trade in value regardless.
That is not how the automotive industry works at all. Go buy a 100k Lincoln navigator... drive 50 miles... and try to sell it...
"Yes, used is used, Miles matter but you know the phrase “My car lost half its value the moment I drove it off the lot”
1 mile is enough."
You don't understand how the automotive market works.
"Isn't it also a thing with electric cars that 300 or 3000 doesn't really matter?
I lost 15k on my Model S after three years."
"Actually it's a gray area on whether they can sell a returned car as new, ever. The actual laws leave it a bit ambiguous as to whether a returned/cancelled sale still counts as making the car a used car. It seems like Previously Tesla thought they could sell returned cars as new but now it looks like Tesla believes that they can't or aren't willing to go to court over it, and that's why there's suddenly so many used cars available with so little miles. 

I expect them to end the 7 day return policy soon as that was created when they thought returned cars could be sold as new and they were intending on closing the stores making it very hard to do a test drive."
In NJ there's no taxes on EVs which is cool.
"I know that. That’s why I said if you count the tax credit I got on my new car, then this used car (which doesn’t get the credit) is only 10K less..."
"Yep, no sales tax in Oregon, Montana is the same way."
"I always wondered where states like this got their revenue.
If I were there, I’d be swapping out cars every 6 months."
"2019, taking delivery in a week"
"You’re probably in the sweet spot, where all the little things that needed to be fixed early are already done and you didn’t have to eat the big depreciation hit. I’m a 26,000 VIN and I’ve already got a decent list of replacement parts on mine in its first year. Model 3 is still a fantastic car though. Enjoy 👍🏻"
I think it basically was only the 2017 models that had it. Your car should have textile headliner and Alcantara on the interior door panels.
"I meant finish quality, I guess. The components themselves can be perfect but the assembly could be messy and that doesn't always reliability issues. I don't care about panel gap,I don't care about paint finish, I don't care about even interior finishes for the most part. Just want a reliable ev."
"Not exactly. If the car you have can be turned into a profit center, ie, if it can be put into the robotaxi network then it will be worth much more. It's not range that determines the value of it in the network, it's namely whether or not it is equipped to be turned into a robotaxi."
"Sure let's just ignore the fact that uber and lyft exist. 

It is literally just a cheaper Uber/Lyft. It's not absurd. Tesla has BY FAR the largest fleet size, so even if they were late to the market with an actually self driving capable software, they'd still beat out companies like Waymo/Cruise.

Your literally saying because we don't know the future we can't make predictions about the future. That is plain dumb. If Tesla solves FSD, they will make a shitload of money, and at the very least you could sell your vehicle for more money than if it could NOT drive itself, which means it's value from today will increase..."
"Or a Ford GT, Jeep Wrangler, or a Ford Raptor. Most off-roaders and trucks in general. You can definitely avoid severe depreciation if you buy the right vehicle"
You’d be blown away by what a good detail shop could do.
"I don't know how much time you have, it varies by state, by insurance company, by if you are at fault or not that you can even get it.

So my thought is if you aren't sure start the process. You may get it or you may not but it's probably worth trying even so you know what to do for a future event."
"Just like the BBB.  Everyone pays for BBB accreditation,  it’s a business and it’s business interests lie with the people who pay them.  Not the person who needs them."
No you should be reporting accidents to the DMV. Anything over 1500 worth of damage iirc
"Ah my bad, in Europe (at least in my country) there is an official carpas that needs all these things registered (km's, serious accidents, C0² emmissions) I assumed that this was the same.  
  
In your case it might not be a serious accident but information like this regarding 'accident cars' is very important for buyers;"
"That's why it's devalued, you can't see the repair. You won't until the filler all flakes off."
Too many people live in single period worlds and have trouble understanding equilibria.
"What, you don't think a self driving car in an entire 24 hour period can't get enough rides to cover 100 miles of paid rides? I am going to need to see this breakdown of yours."
"For the last question the answer is probably yes. There is a lot of assumption going into this answer, but I believe it's an educated answer because I have done a lot of research on this for my investments. Even though you didn't pay for the FSD feature, the hardware is still on the vehicle. So your car is a FSD vehicle even if you didn't pay for it. So to Tesla, the fact that you didn't pay for it and are trying to trade it in is irrelevant.

A FSD is worth more than $100k in value to the owner. Third party research has calculated the very bottom of profit from a FSD working as a taxi is about $30k per year. That's the floor of profit, not the ceiling. Tesla is going all in on the FSD plan, they want autonomous taxis to be their main source of revenue. So to answer you question again. I am convinced Tesla would take your trade in for more than you purchased it for, even if you didn't buy the self driving functionality. But again, the assumption is that Tesla wins the FSD and release an autonomous taxi app allowed by the government. Elon says you are buying an appreciating asset because he believes those things will happen. If they don't, you just bought a cool car that depreciates like all the others."
"Yeah it does. 

https://www.drivegreen.nj.gov/zev.html"
Thanks. So when did this refund happen? I didn’t know model 3s come with FUSC.
Thanks.  New to the lingo.
"Yep, that’s what is underneath! You can take off the covers with just your bare hands."

California has a decent state credit on top of federal.  Unlike the federal one it's higher for lower income buyers.
"I bought a new inventory model 3. At the time, right around first week of April this year, the inventory discounts were huge. Remember that horrible first quarter? That led to massive price cuts on the existing inventory. My discount was $5600 of the then current price. Then all the price cuts happened and AP started being included for free, and they applied the same discount by the time I received it in the third week of April."
"A car does not drop 20% as soon as it drives off. Generally, depreciation is 20% after the first 12 months, not the first week."
"Maybe, but we all know electric cars shouldn't depreciate at the same rate as ICE cars."
I've lost roughly 30K on my model 3 already....
"This depends state to state. Generally so long as the vehicle had not been registered it can still be considered new. That being said, specific state law varies. 

It’s akin to unwound deals post delivery at car dealerships. In my state (NJ) it is a new car until registered."
Not motorcycles though ☹️
">Where do you live where you don’t pay taxes on used cars?

This is what you said. You still get taxed on used cars."
Like buying new and 6 months later selling it? There would be significant depreciation losses.
"Income tax. After federal and state income tax I take home less than 80% of gross income. (Live/work in Portland, ~28k before taxes)"
"Haha there we go! I'm thinking ""man thats gotta be brand spanking new!"""
Curious what you’ve had replaced?
Yeah that's probably right
what is alcantara actually?
Yep.
"Because that would require 30,000,000 miles of riders every 24 hour period just for current Teslas on the road today. Tesla plans to add another 50,000,000 miles of capacity at that rate every year, year after year. The revenue you’re imagining would fund a ton of competition from the companies well on their way to having their own robofleets, like Apple, Waymo, Cruise, and Uber. You’d need a massive shift in how people think about cars to absorb all that, and pricing would have to be competitive with the normal cost of owning a car to do that. Ultimately, a car in such future will not be able to generate that much more money as a robotaxi as people will be ordinarily spending just to own a car and drive themselves."
"Early Performance Model 3s came with Free Unlimited Supercharging. It was also a possible referral reward for a short time. When the price was lowered pretty dramatically around October 2018, people complained and Musk tweeted that early buyers still had free supercharging. This evolved into allowing anyone with a Performance Model 3 and Free Unlimited Supercharging into getting a $5,000 refund... if they gave up the charging perk. Tesla made good and sent checks to everyone who asked."
"No problem. 

New Tesla owner? Or future?"
"Not true, i just applied in July"
That was the EV charger rebate
"Hmm, I tried googling it but it doesn't seem any other state has it?"
The point is why would I buy yours when I can go to the dealer and get the same thing.
"Farts are farts.. people don’t fart less in the seats with EV’s. 

New means no farts. 

Used means some farts. 

Used goes for significantly less, because people hate the idea of other people farting in their seat cushions. 

That’s science!"
Why? The drivetrain might have fewer moving parts but in the end it's still mostly a normal car.
Why's that?
Of course they should.
"Why? They age just like other cars, battery tech is still improving, if anything they should lose value faster than ICE cars. Which is exactly what is happening."
"Wooosh. 

Go read the comment he first replied to. They said ""You dont get a tax on used...."" and ENrgStar was making a joke about the fact that he probably meant to say ""You don't get a tax *credit* on used"""
No.. buying new and 6 months later selling it and buying something else used.
"It would be interesting to see some kind of graph with average taxes paid in each state, maybe compared to education quality, income, etc"

"You are way overthinking this, and you seem to have some misconceptions. Let me clear things up. We aren't talking about the entire market here. We are talking about FSD Teslas. So if FSD becomes a thing and the Tesla version of Uber comes out with it. Anyone who owns a tesla can sign up their vehicle to drive on it.

Tesla doesn't have to own the entire market. I have no idea where you are getting this idea from. There still people that take regular taxis instead of an uber. Yet there are Uber drivers that make money. Same concept for your FSD Tesla. We are  assuming that people would be willing to try a cheaper ""uber"" option with a FSD Tesla instead of a driver. I think that is a safe assumption to make. Your FSD car is the same thing as an Uber driver. The math shows that if the car drives 200 miles in one day in rides, it will be extremely profitable, well above $30k a year. Why do you think the entire market has to shift to FSD all at once for this to work? That makes no sense. Nothing works that way. 

Now for your second point about competition. I direct you to this talk hosted by George Holtz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2Ok7jUUB9U. He basically explains that FSD by companies other than Tesla are basically a scam at this point. They are extremely expensive with very limited results. While Tesla actually has these vehicles on the road now. The moment the software and laws are able to FSD, Tesla will have a fleet. The other companies will have to build one. That is the competitive advantage. They already have the cars on the road, they are building more, and they will be the first on the market that can do it cheaper."
"Thank you. I think I remember a bit about that. I was toying around with purchasing a model 3 in December 2018 but Tesla would not offer the $5,000 refund anymore because they had stopped offering the FUSC."
Future. Any difference from the computer from 2018 to 2019?

Lol you got me there.
It all makes sense now. Thank you.
I would like to subscribe to your newsletter on fartonomics
There are less moving parts and the operating costs are lower. The only reason they are depreciating so fast is range anxiety and lack of infrastructure. This is a good article that lays this all out: https://www.denverpost.com/2018/10/11/electric-car-depreciation/
"Likely would still take losses on costs of registration, title and insurance?? Also seems like a lot of work.. why not get a car you like a d keep it? Also people are typically pretty bad at making deals in buying and selling.. I know I sure am!"
Had mine delivered Sept '18 and still think about it every day.  :)
Well this is scary. I have VIN 109XX and none of that stuff got replaced.
"You don’t understand how market equilibrium is achieved for commodities, and you’re getting *all* of your information about the value of FSD from Tesla.  I’m done in this thread as nobody is going to benefit from the time I put into it at this point."
"Yes. Cars produced from May this year have a much more capable neural processing unit, which should enable full self driving capabilities."
"Yep, this is perfect. I'm stupid - thank you."
So why hasn't someone bought a fleet of teslas to resell on their lot? That way nobody needs to wait for one.
"Once in a while a little waft of their essence will slip it’s cushiony bounds, enter your nostrils, going straight to your soul. I hope they’re not an evil spirit. 

The car must be crushed!"
"Don’t even get me started on how much vegetarians love EV’s and how a vegetarian diet increases fart quantity, durations and intensities. 

You definitely don’t want a used EV.. unless it has had the seats all replaced. 

(Carnivore ICEholes: I’m joking, please don’t repost this in your pro-fossil forums.)"
"That article seems like a lot of conjecture to me, but I think it's missing an important factor: the initial selling price. Right now most if not all non-ICE cars are simply too expensive for the sorts of people who are looking for a used car, so the price *has* to come down a lot."
"I see, i think my title and registration was a hundred or two. Seemed inconsequential compared to the $4500 tax. I’d probably still do that every year at least just to have something new."
"I am getting all my information strictly from Tesla.... When I post a video from the CEO of a competing company... Yup... Just Tesla... You could benefit from this, but you are set in stone on your stance and refuse evidence to the contrary."
Didn't Tesla say that they would upgrade all earlier models (if you purchased FSD at cost)?
 I picked mine up in June. Anyway to see from the display or the vin what hardware I received?
I meant there isn't a dealership lol
Its still new tech. A lot of reports on the battery price drops that are happening soon say that it will be the turning point for mass adoption.
Yes.
Yes but Tesla says lots of things. It’ll probably happen but good luck getting a firm date out of them.
If it was manufactured in May 2019 or later it’s HW3. Others may be able to provide more exact dates.
Is there a good way to find out my manufacturing date?

"I really agree. Even in a country filled with Teslas, people still stop and take a picture that maes me very proud."
"We need to start somewhere, dreamed of a Tesla back when I had a 2007 Toyota Avensis. Now we are here after so much hard work"
Did you know this side thats shown has curb rash?
"No, i am a software engineer"
"Cream interior, carbon and 7 seats"
I heard OP owns several lemonade stands
"I work for avis, giving out loaners in a tesla service center."
"That’s what I always wonder. Around my place, I see a lady(maybe mid 30s) driving a white Model S P100D, with nice aftermarket wheels.. I’m like, “what do you DO for a living??”
I thought I made decent money, but not that decent, apparently.
I want one so bad. I’ve started saving."
What do you mean? Many jobs you can afford it.  Where do you live? It depends highly where you are and the jobs that are there.  Also depends where you budget your money
Thanks.! Love em to bits
"None suprisingly, but in the city prolly 3 per min."
Who would not 🤷‍♂️
Thats right. Next of EB will be EC
Takker!
deffo worth it. tbh i hated the X but after driving it i fell inlove <3
was tooi lazy to put in im sorry
Just wait i'll wrap the car soon and it would look better ;)
Most likely its me LMAO
Thanks AFAIK i have the two sets that are in norway
Will do saving for ut atm. My plan is Nardo Grey
Almost spat my coffee out
Want me to suggest something? TSW Sebrings simmilar to this but fits TM3 profile.
Would look good! You get em in ebay or in fitment industries most likely
What u mean?
"Not really, this is not a million dollar car."
Got some full metal jacket nostalgia. Dunno why hence title.
I upvoted just because I liked the title.
Let people enjoy things.
I dont really care about people getting my plate. Its public info.
"Lmao. Funny but I have a girl :) and my Cars name is Oreo (black outside but cream interior inside)
EDIT: I REALLY LOVE OREOS aswell"
"Jeg snakker ikke norsk.

*That is all the Norwegian I know*"
"Here is a galler of TSW OSLOs if anyone was wondering. And yes my winter set are also TSW Oslos but in chrome, painting it soon.

Yep - bought two sets very cheap before they went out of production. I mainly purchased the second set in case any wheels get damaged.
"Not really, as long as you coat them with ceramic then youre good to go. Just pressure wash and done"
If only I hadn't bought a Constellation.. I would be a tiny bit closer to getting a Tesla.
AHHHHHH!!!!
You mean THICC.
"Very true. But I'm torn, because they just dont seem very practical yet. I'd really love one, but I feel like instead of spending 40k on the tesla, getting a 10k truck, 15k Nissan leaf, and 15k hybrid would be much more practical to cover a larger variety of uses. But maybe someday I could replace the leaf with a Tesla once they get cheaper"
No!
"Do you understand the joke?

I think it's known as the first line of the Marines creed, written by a General. *This is my weapon. There are many like it but this one is mine.*"
LMAO
Send me her address. I will steal it.
"You need to remember, EVs are a tad cheaper because of no tax for EVs hence why i can afford a 75D TMS and Performance Model X"
Amen to this.
"ET would've been cooler, just sayin."
What type of wrap? 🤩
Not many that look that good
Rrrrrr
Lmao it means lets go Norway
Jeg snakker litt norsk
I think it my favorite Tesla Model X of all the ones I’ve seen.
Show me! I wanna se other TMXs with these beautiful wheels
And yes these are a pain to fix aswell got som curb rash from my dad accidentally scraping them and all of the wheel specialists said no.
They looks suspiciously like the Aston Martin Valkyrie wheels. Cool!
Unexpected Star Citizen comment chain. Love it!
E X T R A T H I C C
"Yeah I would say take it slow and wait until a real ""all arounder"" will be in place. Maybe pick up? But for me Oreo(my MX) suits my needs for now"
Theese wheels hide it so well. It still looks bnew from the proper distance like 3ft. Away
Oh my bad i just woke up LMAO
"If I knew, I would have already stolen it. Haha"
"But as far as initial cost, aren’t they more expensive than the average, or even many luxury ICE vehicles?"
I live in Ohio. I’m only 17 but I want a Tesla at any means.
"Would like EG,EZ or EX"
Most likely Nardo grey
Oh lol i have seen simmilar but not as spicy as these. I always see vossen wheels on TMXs but i think TSW looks good on MXs
Jeg snakker dansk...
Holy shit I forgot I pre-ordered that game uhhhh... 6 years ago? Is it out yet?
"u may be Norwegian, but u meme like an American!"
"No, electricity prices pretty low, cheap road tax, no gas/diesel( tahts very expensive) so no its much much cheaper."
Do what you gotta do. I'm 23 and got 2 Teslas
Guess we just have to pay up and get costum plates haha
Kondolerer..
"Not quite. The single player story is due next year but a bit more delays are expected. The Persistent Universe however is an ever evolving sandbox and it’s really starting to kinda come together. If it’s 6 years since you’ve checked in, I definitely recommend to take a look now. I’m fairly sure you’ll be blown away by some of the progress ;) But still it is alpha and bugs should be expected, but it is truly starting to come together which is really nice :)"
What game?
I bought the base Aurora ship. I've only checked out my hanger but haven't played yet. Huge download every time.
"Oh my sweet summer child, no and it never will.

 [https://twitter.com/dsmart](https://twitter.com/dsmart)"
Kinda funny that u call me Norwegian when I am actually asian 😂
"So, taking into account the money not spent elsewhere, it is that much cheaper?
I guess I’ve never really thought about it as in depth as I should have.. 🤔"
"Ja, det eneste vi har er dyre Teslaer. 😭😭😭"
"[Star Citizen](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/enlist?referral=STAR-4XSM-LQHB).  I “backed” it’s early development thing I think about 6 years ago.  It was this grandiose space flight sim designed by the guy who wrote the Wing Commander games, if you remember those?  It’s suffered from severe feature creep and seems to be in a perpetual state of development and funding.  I had completely forgotten about it until today."
"Yeah. let me explain a bit further, 

I pay around 12.000NOK for the car(Performance MX) and insurance. Plus 950NOK for power and around 100nok for Road tax(or toll roads), public parking is free so total of 13050NOK per month. plus we do not have to pay for what we call ""års avgift""  kinda like a yearly bill to pay.

&#x200B;

on a similarly priced deisel car it would cost

12000 for  Insurance and Car, Pluss around 2000NOK for diesel, around 500 a month for road tax, plus parking.

so 14500NOK for a diesel per month plus an annual fee of 4500(i think.)"
Hvis bare regeringen ikke sad på deres hænder og sagde 1 mil el-biler i 2030 🤔
"$1,463 US dollars/month. Not bad, actually. If I didn’t have to account for gas and frequent maintenance like I do my ICE vehicle... yeah.. I might actually be saving money.
Holy fuck."
Its the small details buddy.
Take note UK (please)
"""Tesla announced on Tuesday that it was formally launching the Model 3 sedan in South Korea, as part of the company’s efforts at breaching the country’s growing EV market. What is particularly interesting to note is that the Model 3’s starting price in South Korea could start as low as around $26,500 in some areas of the country. """
"27 000$?!?! 

*cries in Canadian 55 000$ starting price*"
"Every government in the world should have 0% tax on EVs, $10k subsidies, and a 20% fossil fuel tax on ICE cars. 

We need to move off oil immediately. Our politicians are failing us. Norway and S Korea seem to be decades ahead."
I wonder how much it costs to ship a Tesla from South Korea to America...
"So sad in my country, the government put so much tax on imported cars, a model S cost around 120k usd ffs."
"This title is sort of misleading, as very few municipalities in Korea offer that much in EV rebates, and the rebates are being reduced every year.  The vast majority of Koreans are going to have to pay at least $5000 more.

It's kind of like saying you ""could"" have gotten the Model 3 for $22,500 if you were living in Colorado and got the full $5000 state tax credit, and somehow also got the $7500 federal one before it was reduced."
"Well, they're gonna sell like hotcakes in SK, damn. A small, nimble, powerful, incredibly fun, feature-rich, software-oriented car with almost no maintenance that runs on cheap electricity and puts out zero emissions. Yeah, gonna sell hard."
"I can see the headlines now... “Tesla prices slashed in South Korea to combat slow EV sales”

</s>"
What's the price of a Kona there?
Wow! Wish they started at that price here.
So that's why I saw so many order confirmation pages on Instagram in Korean yesterday!  Dudeeeeee that is cheap!  Another big Asian market for Tesla to take and give Hyundai/Samsung/Kia a run for their money!
"When it hits that price point in the US, I’m in! 👍"
"That’s a heck of a lot of taxpayer subsidies. 

There’s something inherently disturbing about this. I can’t comprehend why taxpayers should subsidize another person’s automobile purchase. 

Taxpayer money really should go toward charging and other EV infrastructure. This can be use by all for many years to come."
So how much to import one to Europe? :D
"Cheapest in Germany is 44.370€.  
oof"

What ev plugs do they use in Korea?
"Considering the average income in Seoul (where the cost of living is the highest) is around 36k a year it costs a family more than in Europe. Still ""cheap"" in total numbers"
"I need a new car before Feb next year and want one, but they’re just so expensive in New Zealand. There’s a plan to do incentives in a few years so hopefully that will help the prices, but currently I can buy a Mazda 3 Limited which is approx $30k cheaper than the base model and still be (based on calculated fuel prices) $15k better off in 3 years.
I know it should be an environmental decision and I really want to get one as it’s the only one with the range that will work for where I live, but I just can’t afford the initial cost of the car over here"
All those county leaders flapping their mouths on how they will go green and then when the time comes the tax the shit out of EVs.
saw quite a few Kona’s in the smaller towns when i was over there recently.
Meanwhile here in Washington State there are zero EV initiatives and you are charged an additional $250 a year just for owning one. Thanks Jay 'reduce our carbon footprint' Inslee!
All tesla will do is raise the msrp if this is the case. They’ve been using the tax incentives in the US in that way.
"I feel that EV support in South Korea may have had something to do with Hyundai and their push into “affordable” long range EVs. 

Would be great to see Tesla outselling Hyundai in their homeland! Wouldn’t be awkward for Hyundai at all..."
"Cries in 66,000 AUD"
Then why did I lose money today?
pretty surprised to see the volume of people railing against taxes in here.
"$66,000 in Australia before any taxes or fees or ORCs. And zero rebates or Govt assistance. Thanks ScoMo! (Scott Morrison, Aussie Prime Minister)."
"When the Tesla factory is open in China, will the Koreans get those?  Also, will the price be even cheaper due to cheaper Chinese labor and closer delivery distances compared to sea shipments from California?"
"Wow, this is great, was in Korea in June and noticed that I had not seen a single Tesla, awesome they’re going to get them!"
"Man.... starts at 46,000€ in Germany. That’s like $50k, and I’m gonna start a job which earns 2,5k-4k max. I’m never gonna own a Tesla"
I'd actually be able to afford one if they ever dropped to anywhere near that in the US.
"Hmm, maybe I should move to South Korea for a year... 

Anyone know how much it costs to transport a car on a boat?"
"**Tesla Model 3 fever hits South Korea as crowds flock stores to see the ~$26.5k EV**
https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-fever-hits-south-korea/"
Lmfao The United states sucks ass
"See the issue with this is that the model 3 in the states starts at 35,000 and one has to call Tesla in order to request it off the menu since it's not on Tesla's website."
"Is taxationa a theft? I mean it's alright if it goes back to the community for roads and stuff, but actually where does all that money goes? Filthy politicans?"
"That is really good price although I don’t really think many Korean would buy it. They still prefer their domestic brand like Apple and Samsung in there. 

Meanwhile, Tesla also introduces Model 3 in Taiwan same day with Korea. Model 3 price in Taiwan starts at 1550,000 NTD, 49,372 USD."
i love my diesel truck
"Don't VAT (20%) and tariffs (10%) add a total of 30% to the cost in the UK?

In South Korea VAT is only 10% (in line with the most expensive US counties) and there are zero tariffs on most imported cars, including those from the USA.

Even if the tariff can be removed through free trade, the high VAT will make it hard to bring UK prices that far down. Unless they do it Norway style and eliminate VAT on all EVs.

And then Brexit could add further upward pressure on the price."
Start at around $44k here in England.
"I got all of you beat, in Cambodia it's over 100%. Corrupt ass government"
Take note Switzerland (please)
"I did! It's mentioned here.

"UK is trying to help by giving us the £3500 but Tesla is just eating that up as additional profit..

We all know the price will drop when the incentive goes away."
"Good news is the newest transprt minister is a tesla fan and has one himself. 

Hopefully the UK can back EV's big time. The model 3 is perfect for UK.

I would be  happy even with an interest free loan by the government similar to how Scotland has. Win win for the government."
"And US, pretty please"
"God I paid twice that, but at least I have 325 mile range and FSD"
I hate how the federal rebates work for the Model 3 in Canada. The AWD models don't qualify for anything.
Vote conservative and we will end up with no Federal rebates for EV’s. They will do their best to incentivize more fossil fuel usage.
How about $75000 in New Zealand starting price
Good guy Korea
Finnish 87 000€ laughs
"So that's 41k USD, just 2k over the price in the USA."
"Admittedly I’m not sure how it works in other countries, but if you have a representative in government, call, email, and write about EV subsidies.  Start something local... a writing campaign for example.  

If you don’t like something, take action."
Isn't that 27K USD and 55K CAD? Much different.
"How unfair. Your only fault is living in the wrong place on the planet, apparently."
about the same in Germany
"Remember that people over there probably make (a lot) less money over there, so that balances it out"
"VAT in Canada is only 5%.  and in Canadian funds that's $36,000 not 55k lol."
lol at Canada.  the 51st state.
"I agree with you 100%, but unfortunately that would never pass.

The politician putting that forward would get simultaniously axed by his/her electorate and the powers that be.

So depressing."
Current taxes on gasoline are about 20-22% in Cali.
"If the us did this, the base model 3 would be $25k including tax. All production to 10k a month would be used up just by the USA."
Norway is a leading oil producer
"Subsidize public transport more than EV, and make them on time."
"Spoken like a true, clueless, upper middle class bufoon."
"For real it’s. It like they are losing money, just the chance to make more money"
i agree we need to move off of fossil fuels immediately. but how would those that can't afford a new EV be affected by ICE taxes?
"We aren’t to the point where there are any viable options besides Tesla yet, but maybe in a couple years."
"We aren’t to the point where there are any viable options besides Tesla yet, but maybe in a couple years."
Divide the cost of ownership up and suddenly more people would get on board. Take the battery cost and electricity cost and split it up over the expected battery lifetime. Now a Tesla is suddenly $10k cheaper. True you’re paying a monthly fee but people don’t see that. They see a price tag.
"**YANK MAILING HOME
JEEP BY INSTALMENTS**
New York, Aug. 4 —1945 A device
which ""looks"" into mail packages

contrbrand articles mailed home by

newsmen today.
The demonstration of the in-
spectoscopo was staged by Maj
Waller S. Palmer, who said that one

The jeep-lover was detected

ment of five bulky packages,"
My thoughts exactly. And do you have to be a resident to get the discounts (e.g. are they tax rebates like in the us? Or just a straight reduction on the price of the car?)
They should make an exception for electric vehicles.
"The whole reporting sucks

> South Korean Tesla owners could also utilize one of the 22 Superchargers  and 172 Level 2 chargers across the country, which is pretty notable  considering that the entire nation is [smaller than the state of Oklahoma](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-model-3-south-korea-sales-subsidies/), which is currently supported by six Superchargers 

Yes, compare oklahoma to the entire country of south korea, 4 million compared to 51 million inhabitants lmao."
"I think the only area with such high subsidies is Jeju Island. The most populous region (Seoul) should have a 13,000,000 won subsidy. Still nothing to be snubbed at.

One other thing not mentioned, it’s unclear how the subsidy works to me (because I don’t speak Korean) but from what I heard from family members it’s a lottery due to the subsidy pool being quite small."
spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Couple K-Pop vids, little word o’ mouth. 

Should be fine. 

Can’t make that many still, so they will sell whatever they can ship. The scarcity won’t hurt anything, either."
"With the new Shanghai plant now opening, prices should come down."
"$12,000.. Roughly"
Now all they need is Tesla solar roofs.
Not many new cars make it under $22k anymore.
Because emissions from ICE powered vehicles is literally giving us asthma and lung cancer? It's an attack on the public welfare.
Curious about the dip myself.
"I don't know, but these are really good questions!!!!!"
At that price I would say pretty quickly.
I like to dream as well. I also want the solar package.
"You are not the first to ask, and I still do not know. You might have to change the language on display as well."
"See the real issue is that people don't read the article.  The car really starts at $43,000 there and the claimed $27,000 price is only for very few people that live in a specific area with high stacking federal and local rebates.

That is as dumb as saying the Model 3 is only $31,000 in in the US because it started at $45,000 and had $7500 federal, $5000 Colorado, $800 PGE, and $500 powerwall rebates.

Unfortunately there were plenty of articles just as stupid in the US when the Model 3 came out.

Oh god not a phone call
No wonder why I haven't been seeing it! I was thought they sold out of them or whatever.
In California they are everywhere.
Hard to say. Tesla is now a cult around the world.
The Tesla truck looks promising. I want a RV version.
fucking vat in germany 19%
">	And then Brexit could add further upward pressure on the price.

Although— Brexit *could* allow the Government to remove VAT on electric cars—VAT categories are set by Brussels, so EVs can’t be moved to “VAT Exempt” unless they are approved. Where Grant Shapps and Theresa Villiers, I’d be drafting legislation to encourage EV adoption which would include removing VAT, which would play well with those demanding the government do something about climate change

What the combined effects would be though, so don’t know."
from some other replies it looks like india and nepal have got everyone beat. ouch.
"Sorry, my reply was more of a broad statement to the UK Govt. to incentivise EVs further."
"I agree with the first statement, not so sure about the second."
\*the FSD chip
There are three new battery concepts that may double the range in the next few years.
Agreed I just ordered an SR+. Couldn’t justify the huge gap to a LR AWD. Would have loved that extra range.
"I know!!! I was so annoyed when I saw that. Honestly, I'd go for the SR, but the ups of the LR (greater capacity and faster charging, plus AWD and more power) are too significant imo NOT to go for. Especially in the bitter months of winter."
Doesn't the BC CEV apply to all trims of the Model 3?
8k rebate here in Quebec :-)
If you are going to buy an EV (Tesla) do it before September 14th. Or your rebate may be canceled by the new government like Ford did.
"At this rate, they will expire regardless."
Vote democrat and pay 220 vat like Nepal!
"well, without 15 % GST that is about $65000, which today august 15th = about $42000 USD. So we are paying about $4k US markup on the Model 3 SR+, once you factor in local taxes in some states that might not be much at all. 

But the news that the Govt  ""might"" be willing to bring in a rebate on BEVs up to $80000 just killed the Model 3 SR+ market in NZ, everyone will wait for that to come in 2021 if they can save $8000. I'm looking forward to saving $8000 on my Model Y SR+ priced at $79995 NZD in 2022. :)"
"Indeed. Regardless, I'm always happy to see pro EV initiatives."
"Honestly, no one there could afford it when adjusted to local wages if they didn't have it priced liked that. America still has it cheapest if you account for the average purchasing power of the average american."
That I'm not sure of.
"Man germany really needs a reality check, they will get hit in the face with a truck soon enough and they dont even seem to realize"
"In South Korea? Lol we are talking about best Korea. Not it's northern neighbor.The average Korean has about the same purchasing power as a Canadian. Also, only rich countries can subsidize the purchase of a *luxury vehicle*."
Most provinces have a provincial level tax as well as the federal GST (~VAT).
"When I go to the Tesla page, the price for a Model 3 SR order is 54 990$ for SR+ , and that's without tax. So not sure where your 36k$ is coming from."
"No. It’s not. GST is 5%, most provinces at 10% on top of that."
You cant get the SR in Canada.  In order to qualify for the federal rebate they gimped the Canadian SR to the point you'd be an idiot to buy it.  You have to buy the SR+
It always seems impossible until it happens. Don’t give up :)
I don’t give a fuck if it wouldn’t pass. It SHOULD pass. It’s just a sign that we need to trash 95% of our politicians
"Democracy dollars. Its a policy proposal with the purpose of washing out corporate lobbyist. Basically every citizen would get $100 to spend on political candidates running for office, use it or lose it. So 10k people = 1 million, meaning its much more feasible for politicians to campaign for the people and do right by them vs lie to get in office, and do right for corporate donors.

Now it just needs to be passed."
I mean a fossil fuel tax on cars
Because someone demands it...
"For some people lifetime is 1 year and for some people its 10 years.   For some people the daily commute it 12 miles and for some it is 200 miles.  Some states give you tax breaks for owning an EV, some states charge you yearly fees to own an EV.   Some will have higher insurance, some will have less.

Savings is vastly different from person to person and state to state.   Personally if I switched from my Range Rover to a Model X, it would cost more more each month to operate.  Due to my short commute, I only save about $500 a year on gas.  But GA has a $220 yearly fee to own an EV and my insurance would go up $650 a year.  So at the end of the day a Model X would cost me an extra $3000 over 10 years."
">They should make an exception for electric vehicles.

At that tax rate, they should make an exception for most cars. That is insane!"
"Still tho. I don't think South Korea has more than 20-30 major cities. It also is as small as Oklahoma which is relevant.

Basically I'm willing to wager that it's easier to charge your car publicly in Korea than it is in Oklahoma, or any Midwest state for that matter."
Nooooo... possible to buy there and ship it to US?!
So that’s why government’s should subsidize public infrastructure instead. There’s wider and longer-term benefit.
Agreed
"Yeah it's 2019 and Tesla obstensibly sells cars online, so it's obviously a bait-and-switch, manipulative gutter tactic to avoid actually selling the $35,000 car.

Nevermind that according to many recent posters, it's completely impossible to get *anyone* on the phone at Tesla for *any* reason, be it service, transferring ownership of your car, etc."
"He's not implying they aren't being sold -- Model 3's certainly are selling -- but if you want to order the cheapest Model 3 that Tesla offers, you need to phone in. You can't open their website and order a $35k car anymore; you can order the Standard Range Plus for $39k on the website but not the Standard Range (non-Plus)."
In Denmark its 25% - stupid fucking country

"All Model 3s currently coming out of production have the FSD chip, no? What the commenter you replied to has additionally is a reservation of a FSD license."
That's always true.  Someday a battery breakthrough will probably make it out if the lab but so far progress is all incremental.

I'm very hesitant to do the same...
"Yeah I really want the LR AWD as well, it's quite a bit quicker, more range, and I like having AWD. But it's a huge price jump because of the lack of rebates. 

IMO the MSRP limit should be at least 75k. $45k is what a Honda Accord costs, or Camy is these days"
"Nope: base, standard range, and SR+ only as the program is price capped at $55,000.

"Yeah, that really sucked :( specially because if it weren’t for that price drop back in April, my family wouldn’t have gotten ours. That $14k incentive was amazing last year"
How big is the rebate currently?
"Like the funding will be used up?

That happened in British Columbia.. the demand was so large, they ran out of money and did an emergency refunding of like $10million or something.. but even that will run out quick. 

Demand is too high for BEV’s!! Thank goodness."
"Lol, you people."
Or German Automakers will get their own EVs without the VAT.
"umm, VW I.D.3 First Edition (Premium with mid range battery) at under 40k€?"
Gotta fly to South Korea. Buy a Tesla there and ship it back.  I was just converting the 27k to CAD.
"If you really want it, it's not like they could refuse to sell it to you.  Plus, I prefer calling it SR- given how limited the range is."

"yeah of course, in an island so small, fast chargers are basically irrelevant."
"There's controversy on Hyundai/Kia car sold in Korea vs. US.

Due to regulation difference, US trim tend to have safer (and could be more expensive) since KR trim does not meet US's safety regulation. There \*might\* be no adv airbag, no headrest on backseat, thinner doors."

I had zero problem getting someone on the phone when I was checking stock for a M3. 

In fact, I got the same guy nearly every time and that wasn’t even his direct line. 

This was back in March though so things may have changed."
"If you are anywhere near a Tesla store you can walk in and order there.  They are disincentivizing the SR because they are actually building SR+, and then software limiting it."
"Having autopilot included, premium interior, and now the white multi coat paint as standard, the SR+ is far superior for the price than the base model 3."
"I want one for $27,000. We have an election year coming up. Let's put a Tesla in every garage!"
Amateurs. Brazil taxes for national vehicles are between 30 and 55 percent. Import taxes for a private import is 60%.
"In Norway, it's 25%.

Oh wait, Electric cars are exempted form all VAT."
You have to factor in the other things that the high taxes allow to properly compare. Like not going in debt $100k to go to school.
what? thats harrrd
yeah but that isnt worth much is it?
">All Model 3s currently coming out of production have the 

Questions about that: 

1. When time in production did the Model 3s begin to have this chip by default.

2. If your car does lot have it and you paid for the FSD package, do you get the chip upgrade?"
"Samsung will have Graphene batteries on display next year.
Bye aviation will be flying electric planes with lithium-Sulfur also next year.
Elon says he can get more out of current batteries, and
solid state batteries are in the works."
"Because in the world of Tech, there is always something around the corner.  Its been that way for decades and will stay that way.  It doesn't have to be mentioned 100 times a day."
"because ""NEW BATTERY BREAKTHROUGH"" is everyday news in the EV world."
Welcome to r/TeslaMotors
"Because ""New Battery Tech will make Lithium Ion Obsolete!"" has been the headline for 15 years.  All that it ever does is discourage people from buying today to hold out for this new tech that is supposedly coming and will make your car obsolete.

Ditto with car companies coming out with a ""Tesla Killer next year!"" they want you to indefinitely defer buying an EV, specifically a Tesla, because ""You would feel stupid if you bought an expensive LR Tesla today and then a year from now could buy a 600 mile range EV for $25k... now  wouldn't you!""

Good Guy big oil wants to ""help you out"" by dangling the promise of a super duper EV in some indeterminate future that's always just a couple years away (So you should buy an ICE while waiting).

Which isn't to say Elon Musk hasn't been doing that for years with FSD... ""don't buy another car because FSD is allllmoooosstt hereee and then you'll regret not having it!""  It's a tried and true sales tactic.   Volvo did the opposite tactic to me with the C30 ""If you want an all wheel drive C30 it won't be for about 3 years so a 36 month lease will put you right around when the AWD launches!"" (It was never made).  Elon also did anti-selling of future tech with the Model S recently. ""We aren't doing a big refresh."" to avoid people waiting. 

So saying ""New doubling battery tech in 2 years!"" is tactic to sneakily discourage EV sales.  Hence downvotes."
"And it's not like the higher end EVs don't also generate more sales tax revenues for the government, so nobody loses out if ""rich people"" do buy higher trim cars using the same rebates.

\[edit: to expand on this - if someone does buy a luxury car, they are paying for that extra luxury out of their own pocket.  The $120K example people are bringing up doesn't get any larger of an incentive, and the extra $65K in luxury costs comes out of their own pockets, and also generates $7K in additional sales tax, which pretty much offsets the cost of the incentive in the first place... yes, nobody really wants to pay for someone else's luxuries, my point is that that really isn't happening here.  And the fear of that is keeping solid choices off the list.  It's just bad optics.\]"
I’m glad I got my $5k for my P3D then
In Canada it's $5k federal but only for the standard range model because reasons.
Yep. It’s designed to be phased out. Tesla’s will run out at the end of the year.
"I really shouldn’t have gone there. It’s just all the news discussion about trade agreements right now. Seriously, seeing what Nepal is like made me think. THAT is the alternative. Yikes!!"
"I live in germany and i know a lot of people in the automotive industry, last year everyone was like yeah tesla is not a threat. This year is like, well it kinda is but we are making our own next year! Then i ask them how they will manage to make that many batteries and they go pale.

A lot of people dont know that tesla is making more batteries than anyone else combined"
"And as i said further down, its coming next year, they are pate and they dont have nearly the capacity in battery production. I would know dude i live there, all they ever do is try and shit on tesla."
You would be a full blown idiot to buy it.  It's 45k only has 150km and the battery pack cannot be upgraded to SR+ pack.  It's not software locked.
"Gas tax increase will impact working class families driving 10 year old cars.

No that’s a tax on gas. The tax on cars would be on new car purchases.
"> someone demands drugs so the drug dealer isn't a bad guy. ok then.

Exactly, he's just making a lucrative market.  The government are the bad guys for enticing the drug dealers to commit violence to control/sell their product.  If drugs were legal and taxed it would be better for all."
"Exactly. Without a drug user you got no drug dealer. The common denominator is demand.

The reason why we ""punish"" big time dealers more is because it's easier than stopping drug use at a societal level.

But for a commodity like oil? Punish the consumer baby, let them make the rational decision not to demand oil..."
Ah. But would all of that matter if it was shipped? Like does US need to certify it?
"California buys 2 million new cars per year, Tesla soon can produce 500k/year hopefully, maybe in a 2-3 years optimistically they can reach 2 MM cars, with most of them produced/sold in China."
In Nepal it's 220% . Not joking.
"125-200% in India depending on the car.

E.g: Volvo XC90 T6 Inscription costs 161k USD in India. No kidding."
"I feel i can match you there, in Denmark registration tax on cars are up to 150%.   
We pay up to 60% in income tax, and there is 25% vat on nearly everything you buy"
"60%? Pathetic. A Prius here in Singapore costs \~$95k USD after rebates.

Singapore's tax scheme for cars is weird, as there's no one unified tax for cars. Instead, it gets broken down into 4 parts, with 1 progressive tax, 2 fixed taxes with one tax applying after the other one, and 1 license whose price fluctuates based on market demand.

This system makes it so that some cars can get taxed at 600% of their value, while others ""only"" get taxed at \~240%.

First, there's the Additional Registration Fee applying to the pre-tax price (aka Open Market Value/OMV), which taxes 100% of the first $20k, 140% of the next $30k, and 180% of the remainder. Then, there's the Excise Duty, which taxes 20% of the OMV. After that, there's the GST (similar to the VAT), taxing 7% of OMV + Excise Duty.

Here comes the worst part. There's the Certificate of Entitlement (COE), which is obtained by a bidding process, and only lasts for 10 years, after which you have to bid for a new one. There have been no new COEs created since 2017, and the government has said that they're not going to be adding more basically indefinitely, so the only way you can get a COE is by getting one from cars that have been deregistered. Currently, COEs are floating around US$29k, but they have been as low as $0.80 (but that's only happened 2 months in the 29 years that the system's been in place for) and as high as US$65k.

On top of all of that, dealers usually inflate prices by around 10%, and this is done *after tax*. Thankfully, if Tesla ever decides to set up shop here, that won't be part of the equation. However, this does mean that the lowest-tier Model 3 will start at US$120k before rebates, and the highest tier of rebates is only 10% of OMV..."
"Or you know, going to the hospital and only paying for the parking fee and snacks."
"It gives you all the Autopilot functionality that isn't just TACC and lane keeping. Unless you bought your Tesla during the EAP days, it does provide a decent amount of benefits *today* for that $6k."
"Well, people are paying $6k for it currently, whether that is or isn't much is subjective."
"March 10, 2019 according to some quick research, and yes, hardware upgrade is included in the price for FSD."
"HW 3 went into production in Feb or March 2019 I think.

Anyone who pays for FSD is going to get the computer upgrade to HW3 at no extra cost."

"> Bye aviation will be flying electric planes with lithium-Sulfur also next year.

I appreciate the optimism, but there are sectors like aviation + rocketry in which fossil fuels (or carbon neutral synthetic fuels) are the best fit for the application. Batteries in cars are a no-brainer, but the need for high energy density in aviation is far more important."
"Exactly. So many people getting EVs in general are spending more than they would have otherwise. They still collect GST, PST, HST..."
"The point is not tax revenue, it's that subsidizing vehicles for the rich is politically indefensible. It's probably not a good use of tax dollars either."
"Not in Canada.  We have a different system.

USA applies to a maximum number of cars produced by manufacturer. Canada applies to maximum number of cars purchased by owner."
"That's because they aren't.  Tesla is making a lot of batteries and currently has the largest single factory, but it is not making more batteries than everyone else combined, it's not even the largest manufacturer.  Sorry.

Regardless, all manufacturers including Tesla are continuing to significantly expand cell production capacities."
"They absolutely have a lot of catching up to do. But they also have the talent, the resources, and the manufacturing knowledge to be able to catch up. Tesla is the new kid on the block trying to grow in every direction with fewer resources and less talent than the established automakers. They're coming. Tesla just has a head start."
"idk man, they have invested a lot into battery capacity. They said they have enough capacity. [https://insideevs.com/news/356329/volkswagen-secured-battery-cell-supply/](https://insideevs.com/news/356329/volkswagen-secured-battery-cell-supply/)

&#x200B;

That's why they start with the mid range premium first edition, like tesla did with the model 3. Now that they have more battery and production capacity, they sell the standard interior and standard range"
"I didn't say it would be a great purchase - I just said you can likely get it as opposed to ""can't"" (although I'm sure Tesla wouldn't prioritize making and delivering your car very high, lol)."
It will hurt working class families far harder than well off families.  Adding a 20% tax to economy car would essentially make it impossible for working class families to ever buy a new car.

You would think this precludes people from buying vehicles on such a large scale that they would lower it and collect more revenue from increased auto sales.
"Yeah, but from what I understand you have a good, non-corrupt government and you don't pay private schools and private medical care on top of your taxes (because your public schools and health system is not a cesspool of shit like here).

"Absolutely.

What is better subsidizing (and allowing to be profitable) low and mid-range EVs which can get into a huge amount of consumers hands. Or subsidizing vehicles for the objectively speaking rich which get into few peoples hands. And before someone tries to say it, no the vast majority of these expensive EVs are not replacing gas-guzzling V12s.

People attempt to make the argument that it is better for Tesla to sell expensive cars because they make more profit on them, but that is not the point of the subsidy. A 7,500$ discount on a 120k car is irrelevant to the person rich enough to afford it, but a 7,500$ discount on a 35k car can take it from ""no way can I afford this"" to ""I think I can make this work""."
"It is bad optics, but the point is getting as many EVs on the road as possible.  And by fearing ""rich people"" buying luxury cars with incentives gets in the way of regular people buying competent vehicles.  

I certainly wouldn't be buying an AWD Tesla because I want to travel in style, I want AWD with decent winter range.  The SR+ is a decent vehicle, but it doesn't meet all my needs. The AWD vehicle is only 10K more but doesn't qualify.

And the point to the subsidy (the ""use of tax dollars"") is to kickstart the EV industry and get as many on the road as possible.  Now sure, there are people with a high enough income that don't need incentives, but there are plenty of middle class who still would benefit from incentives given the expense of the more capable cars"

"We are, but the problem is that the public transport system here hasn't been very well-maintained. We've had a string of around 6-7 years where breakdowns were pretty common, and there are still several areas where accessibility is severely lacking. It is getting better though.

What I'm more pissed about is the fact that the government is doing basically nothing to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles here in Singapore. We will inevitably still have to have private cars, but nothing's being done to make that fleet more environmentally friendly. Tax breaks for less emitting vehicles are still really small."
why are u getting down voted?
"We definitely need to subsidize lower end cars to make them accessible, but your argument is flawed because if you are handing out a fixed subsidy it still results in the same number of car sales.

And it's amusing you are going to extremes like $120k to make your point rather than realizing many people just want the ability to buy the AWD version at 65K which doesn't qualify."
"Bad optics ensure that the number of EVs on the road is reduced. Good optics and a well designed subsidy scheme would spread tax dollars to the buyers that need the subsidy the most to make their purchase viable, thus increasing the net number of EVs on the road and maximizing return on tax dollars, not cut a cheque to people who would probably buy the vehicle anyway. 

Good use of air quotes on ""rich people"", like someone buying a $100,000+ car, Model S or X (in Canadian dollars), isn't affluent. OK! How did that work out for Ontario EV buyers when Doug Ford got elected and immediately cancelled the $14,000 rebate, an *easy* target for the populist rabble?"
"I think the challenge is where we draw lines in definitions and where a useful source of info can be found.

BYD had higher EV vehicle production in 2018, but that includes PHEVs and busses.  LG Chem, CATL, Panasonic, and BYD all have more cell production capacity than Tesla (Panasonic GF1) but that's more than just personal automotive, but then GF1 cells are also going into storage.  And then from the battery pack perspective, Tesla is consuming a large volume of non-GF1 Panasonic cells for the S and X, Samsung for storage, and soon another Chinese producer for the Model 3... so no nice clean lines, lol.

I think the big producers with the next year or two (and I would expect Tesla as well) are heading to the 100 GWh/yr level.  It's crazy (and still far from enough)

\[Edit: and I know Tesla is talking 1 TWh/yr, we have to wait 6 months to hear what timelines they are talking about.  I'm curious how quickly they will scale up from here, they certainly have vehicle plans that will need few hundred more GWh/yr\]"
"Nope, that's why I call it the SR-  ... and when the current Leaf goes further, that's not a good sign.  I really expect no one to buy it, as you said it was really just a non-model to qualify for rebates.  But if someone really really wants it..."

It’s more about manufacturing in India rather than anything. Mercedes manufactures cars locally and they are cheaper than Volvo. There is no distinction between Indian and foreign companies when it comes to tariffs.

"You need to draw the line somewhere. When your subsidizing cars that cost nearing what the average two-person household literally makes in a year it is apparent you have gone too far. If people want to purchase Teslas with AWD then they need to bring the price down to a more reasonable level. This is the entire point, to encourage car manufacturers to develop cars everyone can use and subsidize them until they hit economics of scale.

If they just subsidize any car then Tesla has zero reasons to lower their prices, in fact, they only have reason to increase their prices and continue to pump out expensive cars until the market can no longer take it. If they were not losing (starting to decline) their US subsidy I highly doubt they would have produced the model 3 when they did. The model 3s timing was deliberate and designed to hit the first wave of people with the subsidy and then decline from there.

If the government is going to subsidize a product at the very least it should be someone attainable for the majority of the population, and a 65k+ car is not that."
"Not offering competent EVs that people want also keep the number of EVs on the road reduced.  You and others keep focusing on the $100K+ cars to make your argument when the AWD Model 3 version is suited to many people's needs and starts at $65K and doesn't qualify because of knee jerk reactions.

So I use air quotes because your broad generalizations prevent any number of the middle class, who are the financial position to pay the EV premium, but still financially stretched and could benefit from the incentive, but want to buy a competent vehicles that meet their needs (many will do fine with the SR+, and many need more)

Anyone who has any experience working with drug addicts will tell you the worst addict is a drunk. And the most dangerous and difficult drug to quit... Especially for a long term addict.. is alcohol.

Heroin is not a social drug because it's not socially acceptable. Not because it's ""worse""."
yes local production is the thing they try to protect for sure - i'm not sure if there is no tax on local build mercedes but even if its lower for sure
"True. However, the government says that they don't want to encourage EV adoption, citing CO2 emissions from power generation, despite constantly talking about saving the environment and conserving water resources. [Hell, we even tax EVs based on their power consumption converted to CO2 emissions.](https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/onemotoring/home/buying/upfront-vehicle-costs/emissions-charges.html) (""If you register an electric or plug-in hybrid car or taxi between 1 July 2017 to 31 December 2019, an emission factor of 0.4g CO2/Wh will be applied to its electricity energy consumption to rate its carbon emission."")

[Basically all of our power comes from burning natural gas (96%), with the rest coming from solar installs or other renewable sources.](https://www.ema.gov.sg/statistic.aspx?sta_sid=20140731MocHHXHqVG5M) However, even switching to electric cars would still produce less CO2, plus it's easier to reduce and capture CO2 when it's restricted to central sources.

20% of our GDP just comes from refining petroleum products, and our government has historically always focused on economic growth, but they're toooootally not corrupt. Definitely not. Our Prime Minister's wife is the head of one of our two SWFs, which has a stake in basically all of our refining plants, but there's definitely no corruption there, none at all. Never mind the fact that we rank 4th in the world on the crony capitalism index, no sir!"
"The point to incentives is to make beneficial new technology that is expensive more accessible.  The point to incentives is to help new boost industries that are still scaling up so that they can better compete against existing products.  Manufacturers are working on developing better and more economical vehicles, but technology is expensive, as is research and development and building factories.

Tesla has been lowering prices regardless of Canadian incentives.  Yes, they dropped the prices with the loss of the us subsidy, but that subsidy allowed them to scale up Model 3 production in the first place.  They always planned on offering a $35K Model 3.  That's part of moving towards offering a mass market vehicle, which has been their very public strategy.  And improving technology, increasing production, increasing competition also improves prices for everyone.

And Tesla does offer a ""lower cost"" vehicle in Canada just like the other manufacturers, which gives most everyone options, but none of these cars are really that cheap either.  Even with the more expensive car sales, Tesla is turning around and investing that money back into expanding their supercharger network, expanding production, improving batteries, and building new models like the Model Y which consumers will want and benefit from.  You seem to think the price drops are magical and come out of nowhere."
"Indeed, they need to quit pushing the presentation back.

 I'm always a bit floored that Australia hasn't done more battery, automotive, and solar panel production.  Especially with so much sunshine, and lots of aluminum, lithium, nickel, iron, copper ... they should be leading production of this tech.

I think the one benefit of not being able to scale up fast enough is that when new storage tech comes along, like Maxwell's tech, that they have an opportunity to roll it into new factories \[although that'll also likely create a situation where depending on what you are willing to pay for a car determines how great a battery you get\]"
"Pledges are not legally binding and not realistic.  There was a grand total of 1200 EV cars sold in 2018 in India.  That is a whopping 0.04% of overall passenger cars.

"Cars definitely are taxed regardless of the tariff, there is no escaping that. 

Cars are also taxed by 2 tiers classified by length and engine. <4m length and 1.5L engine cars gets taxed at a lower rate of 12.5% and everything else at a higher rate between 24-36%. Most mass market cars sold in India will not exceed 4m even when the same global version of that car is of longer length because of this taxation rule."
">The point to incentives is to make beneficial new technology that is expensive more accessible.

So subsidize my 65k+ car, even though the company already makes a 40k one.

See the conflit there?

&#x200B;

Subsidizing a car that costs similar to a family of 2s household income is literally taking from the middle class and giving it to the top 10%. Anyone who is angry a car of that cost is not subsidized by the government is just a selfish top 10%er who wants free money, or an irresponsible person who wants a car they can not afford with or without the subsidy.

We do not need government-subsidized luxury cars, it is already obvious Tesla/Ford/Chevy/etc can produce EVs that are near the industry car average easily. Sure the technology costs more but these cars that cost too much are literally luxury cars, performance cars, and extra unnecessary features. If manufacturers are finding ways to cram in extra unnecessary features why should I subsidize that? Why should I subsidize a performance model? Or a luxury trim?

If you define a vehicle that should be subsidized by the government as a higher level performance/luxury model when the company already makes a lower spec model that qualifies then I do not know what to say."

There's evidence of cannabis use in 8000BC Japan, it's probably almost as old.  There's evidence of opium use in the neolithic period (so 12,500-6500BC.)  I only made that statement because it seemed obvious an unmodified plant (opium, cannabis, coca leaf) would have been discovered before fermenting alcohol, but it was entirely conjecture.

And regardless, the rebate is the same regardless of what vehicle you are buying, it's there to offset the cost of buying EV in the first place.

I'm certainly not in this income bracket, I just can look at the math rationally and realize nobody is losing out here.

Then maybe Tesla should put lower performance motors in them and sell them for cheaper? Why should I have to pay for your sub 5s 0-60 car? How about they maximize range and minimize performance and then your range would be less of an issue?

&#x200B;

>Anyone going for luxury features above that base level isn't getting anything more incentives than anyone else, it isn't subsidizing the luxury aspects of it.

It is literally subsidizing a luxury car instead of a cheaper car, what are you talking about? Do you think subsidizing a Rolls is the same as subsidizing a Kia Rio? Do you think that both buyers should be getting the same subsidy when the point is to get cars into peoples hands? Is the guy buying the Rolls going to cancel his order because his 300k car is no longer getting a 7,500 discount? How about the Kia Rio?

&#x200B;

>If someone does chose a $120K luxury vehicle they are paying for that extra $65K of luxury, not the tax payer

The point is that the person does not need the subsidy in the first place. If you can afford a 120k car why should my tax dollars subsidize your decision to get a luxury/performance car? If you want to buy a cheap car that we are subsidizing deliberately to get it out there in peoples hands go for it.

&#x200B;

>I'm just pointing out that there are non-luxury vehicles that will struggle to fit into your narrow definition.

&#x200B;

>only the short range version should be subsidized and Canadians who need the more competent Long range AWD version shouldn't be subsidized

No, Tesla can make a long-range version with fewer features in an attempt to get the tax credit. Tesla wants their long-range versions to also be their expensive versions in an attempt to get more money from people who want longer range. Otherwise, there would be a ""base car"" with a LR battery, or a performance with a SR battery.

You completely mistake Tesla wanting to maximize profit as something the taxpayers should pay for. Canada actually did this right, I really wish the US followed or did it this way from the start."
"What you are failing to understand is that I'm not saying they should incentivize expensive luxury cars, I'm saying the impact of them doing so is negligible and all this worry over is resulting in competent practical cars being removed from consideration.

And you are comparing a rolls to a rio !?  How about being rational and realizing some people need a larger sedan and not a sub-compact.  This is where things go off the rails, when you are being completely absurd.  But frankly, if someone is buying an EV I don't really care what they are buying, it's still another ICE off the road.

Many people didn't consider EVs a realistic choice until Tesla came out with their cars, now you are saying they should castrate them like the rest of the auto industry does to make something cheaper.  The irony is they have been making them cheaper by giving everyone the same base quality, not trying to screw people over with sub-standard parts.

You also don't know what the engineering tradeoffs here are - perhaps they could put in a lower power motor which ends up being less power efficient which gets less mileage out of battery or requires a bigger battery for the same distance, or charges significantly slower.  The fact that tech is getting better is now making it more reasonable to make tradeoffs for lower quality pats, but that doesn't necessarily equal the cost savings nor is necessarily justified like you think it is.

And you completely mistake Tesla as being profit driven company rather than trying to maximize revenues so they don't go bankrupt while trying to build a car company that brings EVs to everyone, one that has forced the industry to pivot and respond.  Maybe you haven't been paying attention to the quarterly reports and understanding how all of this is getting paid for in the first place.

">I'm saying the impact of them doing so is negligible and all this worry over is resulting in competent practical cars being removed from consideration.

It's not negligible, 100k+ high end luxury cars were subsidized in the US needlessly by Tesla alone. They got 7.5k in subsidies resulting in over 1 billion dollars of luxury car subsidies. That negligible when the money could have gone to middle-income people who can not afford model S/X?

>And you are comparing a rolls to a rio !?

The point is you have an imaginary line that you think is justified, everything above that line is a stupid comparison and anything below that line is irrational and should be subsidized. Apparently a car nearly the cost of the median 2 person household income is rational to you.

&#x200B;

>How about being rational and realizing some people need a larger sedan and not a sub-compact.

Then tesla should make that more affordable, not make their only large sedan a luxury car and expect tax payers to pay for it because ""But I want a big carrrrrr"".

&#x200B;

>Many people didn't consider EVs a realistic choice until Tesla came out with their cars, now you are saying they should castrate them like the rest of the auto industry does to make something cheaper.

No, I think the subsidies should have always been for affordable cars. Maybe at first make them 2x the median car price, but at this point, the subsidies should not extend much past the median car price if past at all.

>The irony is they have been making them cheaper by giving everyone the same base quality, not trying to screw people over with sub-standard parts.

God forbid someone get a car with a cheap interior. We need to subsidize 65k+ car because god forbid someone touches hard plastic. The horror.

I know they are attempting to maximize revenue to avoid going bankrupt, but that does not mean we need to subsidize their 65k+ cars. They are more than welcome to charge a premium for their LR models, but that does not justify needing a subsidy for it. I understand their quarterly reports and how it is getting paid for.

The irony of this is people buying the e-golf just shows how wrong your point is. People want cheap electric cars, they absolutely want them.

But instead, they want to be seen as a luxury manufacturer, which is not something the taxpayer needs to subsidize."
">They got 7.5k in subsidies resulting in over 1 billion dollars of luxury car subsidies

So 1 billion/1.5k=133.3K vehicles\*$120K= $16 billion in revenues.  So you are saying that by offering an incentive to spur the sales of EVs that the US government indirectly gave Tesla a $16 billion dollar boost, for the relatively low investment of $1 billion, for them to build their car company that can now offer $35K Model 3s.That is without also considering how much that $16 billion meant to the local and US economy in terms of construction, building manufacturing equipment, all the parts suppliers, paying thousands of employees (and everything they spend their money on), mining minerals, shipping stuff around... that's a huge beneficial impact on the economy.\]

That was a very smart move by the US government.  That is the point to incentives for fledgling industries.  This isn't that difficult to understand.  Maybe you aren't aware of how much it costs to start a car company, or develop new technologies, and think all this appears out of thin air.  Cheap products follow on expensive products, do you think computers, cell phones, even gas cars, were all that cheap to begin with!?  If you bought an Apple II computer it would be like buying a  $5-6K computer today, many would argue that was an unjustified luxury but look at the computer industry today.  Cheap computers didn't come out of nowhere.  The resulting well paying careers also didn't come out of nowhere.  The computer industry, and the impacts on every other industry, didn't come out of nowhere.

Maybe since you don't realize how much governments give incentives and other financial support to many industries and companies that you don't know how important such moves are to the economy.  The funny thing is, it's not like this isn't discussed all the time here, so I'm not sure why you are unaware of it."

Except the ID.3 has twice the range.  Somehow you think it's more noble to subsidize a company who makes their profits by shipping a substandard last generation product to us (because they won't be able to sell it anymore in Europe competitively) rather than giving us a new model based on current range, battery capacity, and faster charging rates."
">So you are saying that by offering an incentive to spur the sales of EVs that the US government gave Tesla a $16 billion dollar boost, for the relatively low amount of $1 billion, for them to build their car company that can now offer $35K Model 3s.

No, I think those \~133k vehicles would have been purchased anyway, and giving free money via an incentive to people buying near 100k$ cars was 100% wasted taxpayer money that could have been spent on affordable cars. Or at the very least phased out slowly to not subsidize so many.

&#x200B;

>That's also without looking at how much that $16 billion meant to the economy in terms of construction, building tools, paying employees, mining minerals, shipping stuff around... that's a huge beneficial impact on the economy

That's completely ignoring the same benefit if Tesla would have produced cheaper models instead of starting with 100k models and only switching to cheaper ones when they were nearly forced to. But an extra benefit would exist that tons of middle-income people would be driving EVs. Instead, rich people got 3rd and 4th cars out of the deal...great..

Completely worthless comparison, the US taxpayers did not subsidize all those early adopters cellphones, and laptops."
">Somehow you think it's more noble to subsidize a company who makes their profits by shipping a substandard last generation product to us

I never said nor implied that. I said that the sale of it shows how much people want a cheap EV. Car manufacturers are more than welcome to milk the luxury market for profits, but once the cars are getting subsidized by the government (the taxpayers) that needs to stop.

At one point is was justifiable for an 80k EV to be subsidized, but that time has gone long ago. There is no reason all the manufacturers can not keep their cars in the 40k range, at least if they expect a subsidy."
"Plenty of people bought Tesla's because the incentives were available.  You seem confused to think that there have been a lot of other options available at that time, and that these were cars that anyone wanted to buy.  Yes, some people wanted Leafs and Bolts, and those people bought them --- but look how much better Tesla's are selling and how many more EVs are out there because they were offered in the first place.  You seem to have problems with your narrative.

Tesla couldn't produce cheaper models early on.  They needed higher margins so they could pay for their research and development and building factories, which with the limited number of cars they could make initially, only came from selling higher end vehicles.  Even when they brought the Model 3 out, offering the higher end trims first to be able to pay off the huge investment in building manufacturing lines, was needed before they could offer lower end vehicles.

US taxpayers subsidize industries all the time, you just are completely unaware of it.  From research and development grants, tax deals and other financial incentives to build factories, and many other financial tools.  The ICE and fossil fuel industries are still heavily subsidized by taxpayers and they are heavily established industries."
"So basically there should be no EV incentives at all.  And you keep changing your numbers all about.

As it stands, EVs are only a few percentage of the cars made and sold, so they still need to be subsidized.  There is a huge capital investment needed to rapidly scale up production of batteries and EVs.

And the benefits go beyond help auto manufacturers transition, the potential future health savings from reducing pollution and related impacts to health is likely notable as well."

That's their subtle narrative, but they have never come out and fully confirmed it. Again, there is nothing wrong with them making these expensive cars, but the government does not need to subsidize everyone.

If someone buying a model X P100D when they were nearly 150k gave a damn about 7.5k incentives they have a big problem.

&#x200B;

>Even when they brought the Model 3 out, offering the higher end trims first to be able to pay off the huge investment in building manufacturing lines, was needed before they could offer lower end vehicles.

There is a difference between the tax write-offs all companies use and full subsidization. And there is a massive difference between subsidized R&D and literally giving people 7.5k off a 100k+ car."
"> As it stands, EVs are only a few percentage of the cars made and sold, so they still need to be subsidized.

If Tesla was actually forced to make affordable cars this number would be higher. Tesla deciding to actively make expensive luxury cars as long as possible before essentially being forced to start model 3 production due to their incentive being halved is what is leading to a small number of vehicles."
"Read around this forum --- plenty of people wanted the incentives to buy more expensive cars than they could otherwise justify.

That's not their subtle narrative.  That's been their pretty public mission from the start.  This is getting pretty exhausting.  Why are you even on a Tesla forum if you have such a negative and misinformed view on their business development.

Yes, the difference is that subsidies on cars have consumers kicking in the rest of the money, so the money has an order of magnitude larger benefit than funding the company directly.  It looks like the incentives are far more productive way to fund companies, but the other financial tools exist for a) when there is no product yet, or b) when you want them to build a factory in your economic area.

Ironically, you sound more entitled than the affluent Tesla owners that spend their time complaining here."
"They can't sell more than they can make.  If they want to make more cars they need to build more factories and more cell production, which takes a huge investment in capital.  Which is the same for every car manufacturer.

Cheap cars in volume don't just magically appear."
">Read around this forum --- plenty of people wanted the incentives to buy more expensive cars than they could otherwise justify.

Someone who uses a 7.5k subsidy to justify a 100k+ car would have gotten it anyway. They are just blaming the subsidy for their purchase.

>That's not their subtle narrative. That's been their pretty public mission from the start.

They always say things that imply they started with the S/X for profit reasons, but nothing to justify the length they pushed them nor how long it took them to bring out lower-priced cars. From the start, the model 3 was a 35k car, people reserved with this premice. Meanwhile it still essentially never hit that price point.

&#x200B;

>Why are you even on a Tesla forum if you have such a negative and misinformed view on their business development.

I fully understand their business development. My problem so far has 100% been on the US government being complete idiots when it comes to subsidies. For the millionth time, Tesla can sell all the expensive cars they want, I am fine with that. I am not fine with the government subsidizing it.

EV subsidies should have the purpose of bringing the subsidy to a normal person. If that means start high then lower then so be it. The argument can be made that we are not there yet for EVs, but seeing you can get a model 3 for less then 40k I do not think that is true."
"The added complexity to make two expensive luxury cars and one ""mass market"" car is significant. Economics of scale kicks in much earlier for a mass-market car.

"You seemed to miss the part about production hell ... yeah, Tesla totally did that just to maximize profits.  You are going to lengths to justify your narrative.

The government is not subsidizing expensive cars - they are subsidizing EVs.  By your approach, only the Leaf would have been subsidized, Tesla would have gone bankrupt, and no other car manufacturer would have brought out EVs because there was no reason to.

Anyway, I don't have anymore time for you.  Cheers."
"Every car maker has luxury lines and mass market lines, it's how businesses are run.  

Another example: Intel markets the same chips at different price points, the super expensive chips making it possible to offer affordable chips as well (as much as most of us hate it) through part binning and market segmentation.

If you have such a negative take on Tesla, then get out of the Tesla forum and go buy another car."
">Another example: Intel markets the same chips at different price points, the super expensive chips making it possible to offer affordable chips as well (as much as most of us hate it) through part binning and market segmentation.

The government does not subsidize intel chips via taxpayer money. This is like the government subsidizing chips so everyone can make a PC and them offering the same 50 dollar subsidy to a base chip and a 1k top-end chip. So intel stops deciding to release as many cheap chips.

&#x200B;

>If you have such a negative take on Tesla, then get out of the Tesla forum and go buy another car.

I have a problem with the government not Tesla, stop being so us/vs them. Tesla can make a 400k luxury car for all I care, I just do not want it subsidized.

I do not want the i-pace subsidized either."
"The intel example wasn't about subsidies, it was another example about how a luxury priced product enables lower cost products.

The point of the subsidy is to offset the cost for any manufacturer to make the investment to switch to EVs.  The initial production runs were all small and not very economical, for any manufacturer, this is just there to get them and the industry started."
"Yes, I understand this. But you seem to assume this fact means that manufacturers **must** create high-end luxury and performance models. There is zero reasons why Tesla could not have started with the model 3, and just started it's price at \~50-60k so maybe \~100k for a M3P. As their economy of scale increase they can decrease the price until they hit that 35k mark they were shooting for.

There is no reason why any manufacturer does not do that besides profit. I am all for government subsidies on EVs, but they should not be used for a manufacturer to maximize profit. The manufacturer should be forced to maximize the economics of scale and ensuring that the product gets to a level that everyone can afford.

The government should have had something in place to make sure this happens.  For instance, X# of vehicles need to be <3x the average new car price to get a subsidy. After that number are sold Y# of vehicles must be under <2x the average new car price. After that number are sold Z# of vehicles must be <1x the average new car sold.

Just allowing X# for each manufacturer encourages milking consumers and taxpayers for high-end cars. Stepping it actually requires manufacturers to think about using their subsidy to get their cars into peoples hands."
"I'm not sure why you are trying to re-invent history.  Tesla chose to produce the Roadster to show that a powerful EV could be produced, that they weren't underpowered golf carts.  The Model S was their next logical step.  It didn't make sense to go with a mass market mid-sized sedan because they didn't have the experience for that yet, and it really wasn't the next logical product to offer.  The Model 3 took many lessons from that to produce their mass produced car \[and they still made mistakes\]

I mean, sure I guess they could have come out with the high trim Model 3 first, but then they'd have to design a whole new generation to roll in the improvements and lessons learned - so not really different than producing two different models.  It's just semantics at that point.

I think you are confusing maximizing revenues with maximizing profit.  Tesla is not really profitable right now.  They aren't trying to milk the market but rather approach this from a financially viable route.  They need as much revenues at they can get so they can expand their manufacturing operations.  Whether you like them coming out with a premium product right now or not it seems like a far better approach than Nissan coming out with a short range city car and slowly improving it to make it a competent car (especially when Nissan had the backing of their regular car sales).

At this point, focusing strictly on the cost of vehicles is not very productive, because longer range vehicles cost more, larger vehicles cost more.  You are creating a situation where small cars will benefit greatly from incentives, but larger vehicles like minivans and pickup trucks will suffer.  Where you will prioritize manufacturers taking shortcuts like poorly managing their batteries to bring down costs, rather than spending more and having the battery last for 10 years.  

Just put the incentives out there and let Manufacturers come up with competent and competitive products.  Tesla is forcing manufacturers to deliver higher quality cars.  Other competitors are forcing Tesla to bring their car costs down (or have you not noticed the huge price drops)"
"You still continue to see this as an Us/Vs them ""He must hate Tesla"" perspective. I could not give a damn what Tesla decides to do, but I do care where my tax dollars go.. I and many others think that subsidizing expensive luxury cars is a waste of money, and there are better ways to spark EV adoption.

Yes, smaller cars are cheaper but the motors and batteries are the same between big cars and small cars. Forcing a price cap which slowly lowers simply requires manufacturers to be all in on the plot of making affordable EVs, which is literally the point of the subsidy. If the rules behind the subsidy do not match what it is intended for, is it actually for that in the first place?

There can easily be rules going both ways requiring manufacturers to increase range and charging speed or else they lose their qualifications for subsidy. You seem to be thinking that how things are in the present is the only possibility, it is very short-sighted.

I am literally implying that the entire EV subsidy system in the US has been wrong from the start. It was designed to benefit the rich not EV adoption."
"Yet the existence of the Model 3 has displaced Model S sales significantly, especially as it pertains to incentives, so this problem is solving itself regardless.  And I've pointed out that there is no significant difference whether the incentive is being applied against the luxury car or it isn't, and even in your own examples the beneficial economic impact of the Model S sales is significant.

Motors and batteries for larger and smaller cars are not necessarily the same.  You already argued that Tesla should lower the torque of their motors to offer a cheaper product (if that could even hold true) which means they now need to produce different motors for their lower end products vs what they need for the high end or truck or semi, losing that economy of scale.  It's also very likely as new battery tech rolls out that cars will end up with varying levels of quality of batteries, because they aren't going to simply stop making the older battery cells.

No - literally the point to a subsidy is to make EV cars which are more expensive (whether it's more expensive due to new technology, the expense of starting up production of EVs, or the lack of efficiency due to lower production numbers) more competitive with ICE vehicles.  We want EVs to sell, and we want manufacturers to step into the market, which is why we incentivize it.

You were the one who focused on cost of the car with no consideration for whether that cost was luxury or functionality, and you are calling me short sighted.  It's taken dozens of comments for your to realize all cars are not comparable.  

The government did not have it wrong from the start, you are re-inventing history.  There are far more EV offerings today unlike when this system was proposed.  If you somehow think Tesla or the industry would be better off if Tesla never offered the Model S, you are delusional"

Quite a pedantic argument, they would be welcome to make more than one motor, but likely only one would make it into subsidized vehicles. Your desire to throw taxpayer dollars at Tesla performance vehicles is astounding. They would never need to make them, again you are being short-sighted and only thinking by what has happened not what can. You seriously need to think about this more.

Exactly, but that does not mean we need to subsidize 100k+ EVs, or even 60k+ EVs. Let's say a model 3 would cost 45k normally, now a 7.5k incentive makes it 37.5k which is pretty close to the average cost of a vehicle. You are attempting to justify a 150k model X P100D being discounted to 142.5k being a successful implementation of a subsidy. Hell, even a 65k car with a 7.5k subsidy is still 57.5k, over 2x the price of a typical midsized car. You can not actually think that is true, not seriously at least.

&#x200B;

>It did no have it wrong from the start, you are re-inventing history. There are far more EV offerings today unlike when this system was proposed.

So because more EVs exist now than before it was implemented that means it was a success? Jesus that is short-sighted, literally doing nothing there would likely be more EVs now than before it was implemented.

&#x200B;

Here is the objective truth. We have been giving tax credits since 2009 for EVs, and 10 years later there are zero EVs that are affordable for the average American. None of the EVs are near their average price within their respective categories.

I call that a failure. Sure the market will eventually correct itself, just like literally never having incentives eventually EVs would reach adoption and a low price point. But the point of the incentives was to accelerate this transition, which I think it did very little for the money dumped into it."
"I don't know why you keep conflating the highest priced luxury items with new technology that still costs a lot.  You are wasting my time because no matter how many times I've explained this, you can't get it through your head.  I don't really give a damn about the 120K Model S, but it's not hard to understand it's sales over the years have helped bring us to the point where the low cost Model 3 is a real option.

The Bolt, Leaf, even the base Model 3 are affordable, especially when you consider lifetime costs.  Are they as cheap as the base model ICE, no, but cheap ICE cars also come with a significant lifetime expense as well.  You fail to understand that it takes time to improve technology and bring production costs down, yet there has been steady progress the battery tech and the cost vs features of EVs (regardless of which end of the market you focus on)

And there are many reasons we haven't seen EVs come out faster.  Some of that is the tech is slow to develop, and some of that are traditional ICE manufacturers who are more profit driven than the Tesla you criticize.  Perhaps you should be looking at an administration that fails to commit to tough emission targets and funds coal factories.  Although even Europe with their incentives, some of which don't allow luxury cars, and has tougher emission targets, still experiences the slow shift to EVs.  Perhaps your idealized view of how you think incentives should be doled out wouldn't have made any difference.

I'm sorry you are disappointed about the incentives and the pace of change.  But the objective reality is that battery costs have been consistently trending downward as the cost vs capabilities of EVs is steadily improving.  The reality of it is over the next 2-3 years we will see competent EVs in EVERY model and market segment and then we will get to the point where cars will be broadly affordable.

I expect the real source of your complaint is your are someone who wanted the $35K car plus incentives to get some $27K car.  Sorry it didn't work out for you, you should have bought a Leaf.  If you want more incentives for EVs now that EV costs are starting to become within reach, then lobby your congressman.  

Where this all started is the short sighted Ontario government killing EV subsidies all together, and then the Canadian government in it's attempt to not subsidize ""luxury cars"" removing a very practical option of a long range AWD trim model.  It likely will also mean that very practical vehicles like the Model Y and Pickup truck won't be affordable anytime in the near future, which also holds back adoption.  So great - your short sighted war on luxury has limited consumer choice.  Congrats.  [The irony being the cost of the luxury aspects are being paid for by the consumer themselves, not the incentive nor the government nor the taxpayers, which you can't get through your head]"
"Prices would have come down eventually, there is no way to know how much the incentives helped. Battery tech would have come down eventually, no way to know how much incentives influenced.

Completely off.

>So great - your short sighted war on luxury has limited consumer choice. Congrats. \[The irony being the cost of the luxury aspects are being paid for by the consumer themselves, not the incentive nor the government nor the taxpayers, which you can't get through your head\]

What you can not get through your head is that subsidizing cars that cost more then the average person makes does not make people happy. It makes people see the taxes taken out of their paycheck and get angry. It makes them think EVs are for pompous rich people, and the elite. It hurts adoption and acceptance, it makes people more conservative. We are seeing all of this right now, especially in Canada.

&#x200B;

I do not care frankly, I will probably get a new daily in 4 or 5 years and my fun car is a gas-guzzling V8 manual. If there is a good EV out in 4-5 years I will probably get it, if not I will probably grab an AMG or something."
"""eventually"" is a pretty undefined period of time, and prices only come down if there is serious investment in both research and manufacturing (and mining) capacity.  Tesla demonstrated that EVs could replace ICE cars, unlike underperforming city cars, and that people would buy them - which the incentives certainly were a part of that which is constantly brought up.  It's that demonstration, that competitive threat, that spurred traditional manufacturers to make the serious and significant investments into this.

Ignoring your California example, with all its serious systemic issues with insane west coast cost of living and income disparity driven by the the tech industry, all off topic to a CANADIAN subsidy.. but let's entertain your ""more than average person makes"" hyperbole.  There's one of two ways to look at it.  Firstly CANADIAN individuals ... since ""average"" is skewed high by high income earners, I expect you mean ""median income"" ... which is $35K.  So *every* EV it unjustifiable by your criteria.  And if we look at it from a household perspective, the average couple families median income is $83,600K for 25-34 and $119K for 45-54, so your narrative doesn't even reflect reality that the EVs most people are buying are WELL BELOW what people make in a year.

Don't get me wrong, I get people are struggling, and it is crazy and unnecessary to subsidize a $120K car ... but EVs are still an expensive product for any of them and drawing lines in the sand that don't reflect the price ranges and utility of the offering out there is not productive.  If you think that even the subsidy for $55K vehicles isn't going to be spun to create drama in the media and with politicians, you are deluded.

It definitely is an optics problem for all EV subsidies, just like carbon taxes, or photo radar, or any other contentious issues.  Politicians are going to spin it to make you angry - even when they are feeding you lies.  Just like you are believing your own confusion about the cost/benefits of these or blowing out of proportion how many people ~~want~~ *can justify* the most expensive trims, and the relatively small amount of tax money involved (compared to the economic benefits that result).  Cancelling the EV incentives all together won't have any noticeable effect on people's taxes, and in the long run results in greater impact on individuals and society because we can't bring affordable EVs to market in a reasonable timeframe.

You want to lobby for ""reasonable incentives"", go ahead.  At least at this point cars costs are coming down that reasonable compromises are more productive.  But that doesn't mean that the economics of incentivizing all EV sales regardless of trim level is bad economics, for anyone, which has been my point from the start.  And adhoc rules are going to impact new models that are functional and pragmatic."
This is huge.
"They are building a rather large factory in China which will employ many thousands of people, and I’m sure they’re as appreciative as Ohio, Alabama, and other states are to get large Honda/Hyundai/Toyota plants. There’s also less incentive now for China to do anything funny with lithium pricing because of this."
Wait aren't electric cars exempted from the huge license plate fees in China?

Does 16 models mean.. Tesla is essentially selling tax free vehicles for the foreseeable future?
I bought 30 shares of tsla yesterday.  I woke up to a nice surprise today.
a country with 4x the amount of people AND the government is on your side? fugggedaboutit
"Cant wait till tesla has a few thousand model 3's rolling off the line in china. Huge profits to be made. I believe it will transform the company.

I think they can get to 5000 by end of Q3 2020"
" This does not make a lot of difference for the model 3,they seem to be able to sell everyone they can make. It might improve margins there a little bit. Where it’s really going to help is for the S and the X. You’re going to see sales increase to China of these models and they are high margin and the capacity to make them is there."
They might approve FSD first and we'll see how good it is over there.
As usual America fucked up and as usual the Chinese have made a clever gamble.
"Wow.  I wonder if they will extend that to other EVs.  They seem to have given no reason for the exemption.

Do they provide similar exemption for other cars, does anyone know?"
$420 per share baby here we go!
This exemption helps to offset the new import tariffs. So there's no net impact (or very little) to overall costs. I suspect that the made in China TM3s will not get the same exemption but we will see.
China is not on Tesla's side. How long after the first Tesla hits China before a Chinese knock-off goes on the domestic market?
"ToO bAd ThErE WilL bE nO dEmAnD! sAd!

"Hey EU, pay attention."
All EVs sold in China are exempted from taxes.

"This is the best case scenario. When they lowered prices, people got pissed. Now the price is lowered, but not by Tesla. Previous purchasers won’t publicly get pissed at the government."
Give it a year and there will be cheap Chinese Tesla's that blow up when it rains or some shit like that
Cries in Irish..
Can somebody explain what the purchase tax is in china? Is it a sales tax?
This is great news for a company I am really rooting for.

MURICA!
"There’s already fake Tesla’s. Look at the xpeng. It’s a clone ModelX and supposedly better and way cheaper, just 35k USD.  They even have a satellite office in Mountain View next to google."
"So this sub is going to scream bias here...

But, this is China holding hands with Tesla. Literally getting a break all because they are in bed with each other.

This is more alarming than the exempt tax.. We already know China stole Tesla tech. Last thing you want is China and Tesla getting butt buddies. 

Also, why is Tesla so special to get an exempt? This will only outrage other business and screams political / financial bias. 

But hey, if you guys want China to start getting more in bed with Tesla, go ahead. But don't come screaming years later when your shit is compromised.

Soon as the China  Xiaopeng Motors starts producing and using the stolen tech, what incentive is it for China to give Tesla a break? They will go and favor their own countryman and business."
Mic drop.
Tesla calls
Non of this matters if at the end our government will force Tesla out of China...
Maybe it’s a trick to get Tesla to locate more manufacturing in China and then steal all the tech.
"What kind of social credit score do you need to be able to buy one though? Oh, it's just for party members.

I wonder if Tesla will make a nice electric mobile execution/ organ harvesting van so the CCP can dispose of pollical prisoners in an environmentally friendly way.

The future sure is bright! ☀️🌈"
It really is. People don't appreciate just how big of a deal this is. China is on Tesla's side.
"US has attracted best Global Talent, China is attracting to-be-best Global  Companies."

"They day will come when the shorts will move on to their next target. When that happens we'll finally get a clearer picture of what the stock is worth. I hope it happens sooner than later, but I'm a hodler, so I'm not worried."
"No, “16 models” refers to all the variations of their current cars."
"Doesn't say anything about import duty. Only about purchase tax.

There is another report:


https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-08-30/tesla-gets-exemption-from-china-s-auto-purchase-tax-shares-gain"
I did not think there were 16.  Three models for the 3 and two for each of the S and X.
"This is merely a VAT exemption similar to Norway. Imported models will still be subject to tariffs.

If you are going to call Model 3 «Model Three» then you must call S and X «Model Es and Model Eks»
"that's a good point. FSD in China might be more difficult in some areas, but the regulation and legal battles should be MUCH easier. it will be interesting to see if they release there first"
If it hits someone I wonder if it will be trained to roll over them again to make sure they're dead
They do. All Chinese car companies that made electric had this exemption. Tesla is just the first foreign company to get it.
"China needs all the electric vehicles it can get, they want to transform their economy."
The Teslas made in China are only for the domestic China market. There are no plans to export the teslas outside of China.
"Don't those import tarrifs only start in December, 15th?"
The work is undoubtedly already underway. If not complete already. Teslas have been in China for a while now.
why doesn't everyone use the Chinese knockoff MS Office? or Chinese knockoff iFone? quality control and software make a huge difference. people wont trust the quality control and a Tesla would suck without the software.
It doesn’t matter. Tesla will always be a status symbol brand in China. The people buying Chinese knockoffs aren’t people who can afford Tesla.
Pretty much like Fisker https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Fisker#Controversies
I don't think Musk would mind. Tesla already said anyone can use their patents.  https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you
Chinese knockoff electric vehicles? What could possibly go wrong?
the average chinese wealthy person - and theres a lot of them - will not want to drive a chinese knockoff.
"I guess Musk is just going for a Hail Mary--juice as much revenue & promise of revenue as he can, as long as he can, to buy himself time with the market while he waits to (optimistically) complete FSD.  

If (major ""if"") he does complete FSD first (and on a ""reasonable"" timeline), then Tesla will probably be more than fine, even if China (effectively) boots them."
Didn't the Alibaba CEO get a Tesla some time ago just to try and reverse engineer it to use on the electric car he's developing?
The work would be underway anyway...
"They will do that anyway eventually in any scenario possibles, and this is one where Tesla can sell thousands of cars in a huge market in the meantime, and take position and a comfortable advance."
"How? First of all they only got this exception BECAUSE they are going to be opening Giga3. Second, this is a sales tax, not an import tax."
"They could have started selling those in 2013, but they didn't."
"Take a breath.

Yes China cheats and steals (and works their ass off while doing so) but in this case it is good for them to get high quality clean EV tech because the environmental reasons for converting to electric are actually real, as much as some like to ignore them.

China’s inevitable acquisition and repurposing of this tech from Tesla into other companies in China (I agree with you, it *will* happen) is good because it is a powerful forcing function for all other car companies globally to get their act together with electric before it is too late for them.

You think Elon didn’t try to give his tech to US manufacturers? He did. They weren’t biting.

His agenda is beyond just money and nationalism, it’s bigger than that. China helps him advance his agenda. And the financials work out too, at least in the medium term. Long term, yeah maybe Chinese companies will eat Tesla’s lunch *with technology they stole / got / learned / whatever from Tesla* but meantime the objective will have been achieved."
"> We already know China stole Tesla tech. Last thing you want is China and Tesla getting butt buddies.

Let's say you're a tech company and are nearly 100% certain your tech has been stolen by a foreign country (knowing you have zero legal recourse).  

Do you:

* Pull out, give them the middle finger, and say you never want to work with them again.

* Stay in the country, invest, and make the previous stolen (nearly) worthless, with all the new advancements you'll make with them.

China is banking on being their largest buyer in an incredibly short period of time.  Even with all the copy cats in China, everyone will want the real brand, and Tesla will be there for it."
"If the tech got out sooner than otherwise due to the factory's presence in China and it spread out to some other companies which produced similar cars, I'd have mixed feelings about it. I want the transition away from fossil fuels to happen asap, and I put that priority higher than almost any consideration since I view the situation as extremely dire. I'm not sure how much I care at all."
"Musk doesn't care. His goal is to *transition the world-wide automotive industry away from ICE*. If non-Tesla companies succeed in building a long-range, long-lasting, good quality BEVs at a lower price then Tesla... then more power to them."
"Tesla already has an open IP policy, Elon firmly believes that doesn’t matter because if you are copying you are not leading. “The pace of innovation is all that matters in the long term.”"
I believe Tesla is one of the few outside companies in China that don’t require a Chinese government “chaperone” in their management.
"Even if they steal all the tech, they need data to perfect the tech. How will the stolen party be gathering data for FSD?"
Its all open anyway
This is good for Tesla but you would be naive to think China is going out of its way to be on Tesla's side. China is on China's side and right now Tesla happens to benefit from being on the right side.
But the big Q: will they be the first country to allow FSD ?
"Well its big for them, an American company investing huge amount will play well in the trade negotiations. They want to show they're accepting of American companies. Since that's what the whole trade war is about. I'm just glad its Tesla."
"> China is on Tesla's side.

There's a lot of technology to be learned"
In Kansas you have to pay an extra $150 a year for electric vehicles because the state doesn't get it revenue from gas tax  on electric cars.
Sadly China is more on the side of Tesla than the USA is.
Or this can also be something that China can bargain with when working on trade with the US.  Everyone's on their own side.
"China is technocratic, run by smart people."
"only as long as it takes to steal Tesla's battery and AI tech, then they'll ban them from selling in China, just like they've done with numerous other companies after stealing their IP

China plays the long game, US corporations play next quarter earnings. Tesla will get a nice boost on this news, even some good sales, but China has 0 intention of letting a foreign company compete and dominate their own markets."
"Ohio has the Honda Marysville Auto Plant (I worked on their fuel system) with 3+ million square feet and north of 4,000 employees, an engine plant in Anna, Ohio, and the East Liberty Auto Plant which builds the CRV, RDX, and MDX. Those are just the ones I know of."
Damn tesla is gonna make a killing off of China. Pretty ironic that it's easier to get a tesla in China than it is to get one in some parts of the United States
And also the rules on bring able to drive on certain days
"Import duty won't matter in the future though, as the cars will be produced in China. It will only matter in the short term while there are still imports being made from the USA."
"So it can sell cars made in China at a significantly lower price.  Imported cars are not granted the same privileges?

Edit: Nope, article sites China's website saying this exemption impacts all Tesla vehicles sold in China."
I think seating configuration counts as a model and possible fsd.
"Call it what you like, it's up to $13,000 cheaper."
Merely?
I think its not VAT but an extra consumption tax on cars that China normaly has. There is no 10 % VAT in China.
I'm fairly sure that's not the case
I deff think it is low. Good company for long term investment at the current price... very risky short term.
You do you man
"But with 1.3 (or so) billion people, even if 90% of them are too poor to own a Model 3, there are still *130 million people* who can."
But these numbers are changing fast especially in the time since 2014
"No info on preorders.
Elon said he wont release them as it leads to way too much speculation and rumours.

But i bet my bottom dollar tesla will have insane demand levels in china."
So they're only making the model 3 there?
Others are saying it's both. Is this not the case?
Thanks. I wasn't aware of that.
"Those are effective in China though, many people buy the knockoff luxury cars in China. I still think it would take a large chunk of the market and eventually might become a dominant competitor if the quality of software goes up enough. I personally wouldn't buy it or trust it but I'm also not Chinese. Do you think this would be the case eventually?"
Excellent point.
"Excellent point. I had forgotten the cachet factor. My sister calls it ""Why pay less when you can pay more?"""
"Wow, you learn something new every day!"
Not all trade secrets are patented
"it wouldnt be as popular. the knock offs would sell a few. the chinese people are all about ""saving face"". 

""you drive a Jesla? haha, you must be poor.""

even then, i think if tesla sells their ""nueral network"" to these knock offs then it would only help tesla in the end anyway."
"Lol I know, right?"
"I hadn't heard that, but it's my suspicion!"
Another poster pointed that out to me. Excellent point.
"On point. The ire towards Tesla should be towards national automakers not picking up on the EV technology. Chinese automakers picking it up (legit or not), will mean reduction of carbon emissions from a high consuming country. This is good."
">Yes China cheats and steals (and works their ass off while doing so) but in this case it is good for them to get high quality clean EV tech because the environmental reasons for converting to electric are actually real, as much as some like to ignore them.

Did Elon tell any of his investors that he's cool with China stealing their patents they spent tens of billions of dollars developing because it's good for the planet?

>China’s inevitable acquisition and repurposing of this tech from Tesla into other companies in China (I agree with you, it will happen) is good because it is a powerful forcing function for all other car companies globally to get their act together with electric before it is too late for them.

Because we can be confident that china will only use this stolen technology towards altruistic ends.

>You think Elon didn’t try to give his tech to US manufacturers? He did. They weren’t biting.

If this is true, why did he require existing car manufacturers to give their patent portfolio to him in a *quid pro quo*?

>His agenda is beyond just money...

They why did he start a for profit company?  He could have started a not for profit, everyone would have still gotten paid, his tech still developed, and he could drop his prices by whatever his margins are."
"Yikes. The man cares, because he is taking him to court over the stolen secrets. Man, wake up a little bit."
"> Tesla already has an open IP policy

What does this even mean?  Virtually none of Tesla's IP is actually open."
">I believe Tesla is one of the few outside companies in China that don’t require a Chinese government “chaperone” in their management.


You don't think there is a good reason for that? That doesn't raise a red flag to anyone? That just shows they are more in bed..."
They can’t steal fsd unless they can break the encryption. China does not do things because they are nice. They are a communist controlled country. They don’t have a constitution and their citizens don’t have rights. Everything they do is to make China stronger for the communist party. Why would they open a tax hole for arguably the most advanced auto manufacture and no one else? It’s obvious they want the tech or leverage over Tesla.
"Their self driving algorithm isn’t open and China also doesn’t have a plant there yet. Tesla is building one now, but I’m telling you China is not doing this to be friendly to business. They are doing it because they want power over Tesla. If they were friendly to business they’d do this for everyone."
"Of course.  And, China thinks Tesla is good for China.  So, China is on Tesla's side.  (Present tense.  Could change at any moment.)"
"Here is the thing, China's side is HUGE, like 4X the US market and growing.

\- Tax exempt NEV cars

\- special car loans on NEV cars

\- front of the line access to a license plate

All those are HUGE for Tesla and EV's in general."
[deleted]
Or maybe China is on Tesla's side here.
Can I flair this guy as captain obvious?
This applies to large cooperation too. It's often time to pay for the people who may suffer from X product or service than it is to prevent it from happening after knowing it will occur.
"lets just say, both of them are on the same side."
Lol. That's how every big nation or organization works
I'm sure they can't wait to clone Tesla's tech
"Telsa are almost done building a gigafactory in China, employing a bunch of Chinese workers. I don't see other car companies doing the same right now.

China can easily afford to waive any tariff that exists until and even during the operation of the plant if a certain line (roadster 2?) Is not produced there. 

Telsa needs the help much more than a big 3 USA company. Helping Tesla helps China by not letting them in on the deal.

Of course it's a great big advert to ""come and do business in China, look how easy it is"" as well has a significant impact."
Probably. I mean they don't seem to give a shit about individuals.
"Is this being funded by American or Chinese investors?
Probably both."
">learned

That’s a kind way to put it."
Do non-smokers also have to pay to make up for loss of tobacco tax?

China has a big pollution problem in cities. I think it is leading to a lot of deaths. Electric cars are being pushed very hard there for this reason
[deleted]
"You are forgetting Model S & Model X

However, it is quite possible that Elon may have promised an assembly plant ( like Tilburg) for Model S & Model X"
"Higher-end versions of the Model 3, and all of S/X will still be imported."
"This has nothing to do with import duty. It has to do with purchase tax, which is a different thing."
"It is for all Tesla cars.

Tesla Inc. won exemption from a 10% Chinese tax on automotive sales, following Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s visit to the country.

The exemption, which previously applied only to domestic makers of electric vehicles, affects all Tesla models sold in China, the nation’s industry ministry said Friday on its website. The electric-car maker’s shares jumped 3.7% before the start of regular trading in New York."
"Absolutely agreed even before these price drops, doubly so now."
I believe so. I don't remember hearing anything about them making any model in GF3 except the Model 3.
"hmm. maybe. I think Telsa and whatever knockoff probably wouldn't be selling to the same market. Telsa is kind of a luxury brand, so I would think that should insulate them from the knockoffs for a while."
"I read an article about [counterfeit Ferraris](https://jalopnik.com/knock-off-shop-busted-for-making-fake-ferraris-and-lamb-1836430568) and you're right. They *can* make them, but they're not the same.

If a major car companies tries to wholesale steal the tech, then you can take legal action. Small shops can get away with this in ways bigger companies are less able."
"Fair enough. But when I hear knock off, I'm thinking copying based on public info (like knock off of a designer bag)."
[https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-pledge](https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-pledge)
"I was just adding on to your comment, not expressing an opinion. 

It’s definitely interesting, though it *could* just go to show how badly China wants good electric vehicles instead of ICE to curb its pollution problem it claims doesn’t exist."
"Even if secrets aren't stolen with espionage, etc.. tech has a way of getting around through people. Employees quit and join other companies, and naturally employ the methods (not just tech really - From what I've seen, management techniques and company culture are still taken seriously and with a straight face in China. Although they're dreaming big and with confidence, a healthy inferiority complex still remains and they want to pick up the strategies of the most successful players in the world) they've learned where possible. Executives leave and start other related companies, or bring their connections into another organization. A slew of startups pop up surrounding the biggest and best players. Even putting aside their longterm goals of transitioning to future energy systems, they'd be crazy not to want them."
They want environment to be safe
Oh that's right. Isn't getting a license plate in China a ridiculous process?
Not to mention China’s air pollution issues... incentivizing millions of people to buy EVs is a pretty good move overall.
Kinda sad when China has better incentives than the US.
"Agreed Chinas market is huge, but...   Source for 4x market please ?   And Is it volume or $ value of vehicles sold?"
Yeah I just trust that the folks at Tesla are more aware about tech transfer and IP schemes than the rest of us. They have to know what they’re getting in to.
"Exactly.  Musk has decided he doesn't care that much about the IP at least looking at the patents he has given away, so while China is always a deal with the devil, perhaps he has thought this out.  

It all depends how long they let Tesla exist.  Many tech companies lose the IP and then the Chinese duplicate the service with their own company.  Telsa is an ongoing collection of people generating new IP every day, so China may be looking long term and thinking this is a WIN/WIN.  Shrug."
I thought tesla released a bunch of patents already?
The one case where it would benefit the world
Tesla has already open sourced a lot of their IP.
"China acts in China's self interest, exclusively. When it is acting in someone else's interest, it is because that coincides with China's interest."
This isn't zero sum. Benefits both sides.
 China is exclusively on China’s side with no exceptions...
"But will the FSD know to run over people a couple times if they accidentally hit a pedestrian, to make sure they’re dead and to avoid paying hospital bills?"

Credit where credit is due. Good job China.
"You are right ! I need some more caffeine. 
Last time I was in China I saw a load of Model Xs, the Chinese seem to love them, there were about 10 outside my hotel."
"Depends how strict the laws in China are regarding ""production"" in China. I think the Model S&X are better to arrive complete, the Chinese buyers for such cars are wealthy and can afford it. Also leaves the factory free for Model 3 production. 

This car is going to sell very very well in China, I am sure of it."
The model 3 is outselling each of those by nearly 10x
"Other than GM, foreign automakers generally limit their Chinese assembly to entry/mid level models, and often exclude the best engines and most cutting edge tech from the locally assembled models. This is due to forced technology transfers and the real fear of IP theft. That is why you won't see the BMW 7-series or M5 being made in China - only the 4 cylinder 3 and 5 series are made there (and soon the X3). Toyota doesn't make a single Lexus in China despite its high production there, because they have sensitive IP in those high end vehicles.

I doubt Tesla will risk their best IP by making the S/X in China."
Premium buyers expect premium prices.
"We know. Op said ""Doesn't say anything about import duty. Only about purchase tax.""

The comment was specifically that this has nothing to do with import duty."
"That is definitely true. I guess it'd only be worrisome if their target markets align in the future, since China is known to favor their own brands when it comes to copyright claims. For now it would be very profitable for Tesla and the knockoff issue would actually only further their goal of more ev cars. I just hope whoever does the knockoff brands don't mess up the batteries to light on fire or something like terrible autopilot."
"This is not responsive at all to this claim:

> Tesla already has an open IP policy, Elon firmly believes that doesn’t matter because if you are copying you are not leading.

* Tesla makes virtually none of its actual software or hardware open and available.  I do not blame them for this at all; this is part of building a defensible business!  But what it does mean is that Tesla has tons of IP that could be stolen.

* In fact, Tesla has been concerned when its IP has been stolen (by the Chinese, surprise) and has attempted to retaliate/address by the legal system (https://technode.com/2019/07/12/tesla-apple-chinese-engineer/).  Good luck with that, obviously.

* https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-pledge is snake advertising at best.  

> Tesla announced that it will not initiate patent lawsuits against anyone who, *in good faith*, wants to use its technology.

1) This is literally the opposite of your claim, as their ""good faith"" specifically excludes ""marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so.""

2) The rest of the ""good faith"" provisions only apply if you let Tesla arbitrarily infringe upon your patents (if you have any that are relevant).  Further, ""good faith"" means that you can't even go after any *third parties* (not Tesla!) ""for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment""."
"Ah understood, gotcha!

>It’s definitely interesting, though it could just go to show how badly China wants good electric vehicles instead of ICE to curb its pollution problem it claims doesn’t exist.


You'd think China with all the money, hacking and factory, they would just tell Tesla bye bye and start their own. I think they are using them for a bit til their tech is up to snuff, and then will give them the curb. China 100% can do this on their own, well, with a little espionage and hacking of course. But they have shown us time n time again, a little sniffing and snooping and little spy sharing some secrets, they can start their own things just as easily. Please though, this is not me saying ""GO CHINA!"" But, it's just odd how much they are embracing an American company and allowing things to slip through China's fingers where no one else would even close get a pass."

"> tech transfer and IP schemes

Its important to note that Tesla owns itself in China. Tesla isn't in the same situation that other foreign companies often find themselves in where they are handcuffed to a Chinese company while they do business in the country. This means they'll get more of the money from sales but it also means they can protect themselves more easily from those kind of schemes. Additionally, I think I read that batteries and motors are being shipped in and aren't being built at the Shanghai plant, so they have some protection from IP theft."
You'd be surprised how many people there are young over eager kids. Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
"Tesla isn't about the patents, its about making stuff that works."
Doesn’t mean they have 0 secrets that when leaked would enable Chinese knockoffs to get further ahead.

Moron. China is on Tesla’s side because they share the same values about renewable energy. Do you know how many solar panels they install per month? Fucking moron.

I agree with you
"But would they still if the price dropped by the amount of the import duty and sales tax?

I'd be curious to see if they'd make a China-only refresh for the S/X just to make it seem a bit different, or even go the route of companies like VW & GM where they just pack up the entire line and send it over when they reveal the new one here. That coupled with a superficial refresh could make them ""new models"".

Though now that I think about it, I'm not sure that's Tesla's style."
"From manufacturing to battery packs and motors, their most up to date IP is in the Model 3. However, my guess is that a good chunk of the really important IP they want to protect is battery chemistry and software, two things which will not be developed in the open at the Chinese plant."
"> I doubt Tesla will risk their best IP by making the S/X in China.

I would doubt there's anything in those cars they couldn't (and haven't) already figured out by reverse engineering. I also don't think it's their ""best"" IP."
"And this will have neither, is that correct?"
"There may be a simple explanation here. Tesla has a well known mission statement that aligns with China's goals.  And they have best-in-breed technology, so it makes sense to just bring them in rather than reverse-engineer all the stuff they've done already.  Remember, China loves fast results.  Finally, that gigafactory in China will probably start exporting vehicles to other countries in the region, which has positive implications locally."
"Everyone already knows China steals IP.  That's what 90% of the trade war is about.  Regardless, the Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada completely revitalized the area, bringing its depressed real estate market back on its feet, luring in tons of other high skill businesses to the area, giving thousands of people jobs, etc.  China obviously wants some of that too.

Keep in mind that while many people do think that China had government sponsored ""stealing IP"" through hacking and corporate espionage, most of the transfer of IP happened due to the mandated joint ventures.  These companies are legally required to hand over all of their IP to their partners, which are often government owned entities.  Tesla doesn't have that.

Also, Elon heads SpaceX which controls a majority of the launch market.  China controlled a large portion of it until Russia came and took their lunch money.  In that sense, it may be highly beneficial to try and lure Elon over to make a SpaceX China, especially if that results in global China internet satellites."

Thanks for the link! .  I'm definitely optimistic China will be awesome for Tesla;  though I do know they sell a lot more short range EVs there than we see typically in the US.
How is that allowed? I thought to sell in China it has to be a fifty fifty partnership with a pseudo-private state Corporation?
"I’m a pessimist trying to be optimistic, appreciate the info.

"Just means they will have to revert to less obvious methods of IP theft like they use with the US military, except on home turf."
"Its not uncommon for the workers themselves to be involved in industrial espionage to steal secrets, there have been many such cases around the world of this happening.  And Tesla will be hiring locally for staff.

I predict we will have aftermarket Tesla charge systems and body kits within a year on Alibaba!  I doubt the rest of the tech will be easy to translate since it requires a car factory to manufacture."
In what way would that sabotage their mission?
You know that the majority of electric cars in the world are made and sold in China already?

"The US legal and regulatory system enforces more consistency (from a business POV) than China.  In China, they could reverse this policy tomorrow and you'd have virtually zero practical recourse; in the U.S. (and, e.g., most of Europe), most things flow down from a legal framework that has multiple check-in points where you can engage (law suits, engaging with regulatory agencies, etc.).  Additionally, many major changes require substantial advanced notice.  

Broadly speaking, the ""self-interest"" function in China is more highly outcomes focused (i.e., does this particular deal immediately and continually benefit China), whereas in the U.S. (and most of the developed Western world), ""self-interest"" is highly process-focused, i.e., does the process seem fair(er) and does it maintain the perception of a dependable and stable legal/regulatory environment.

Obviously, the U.S. doesn't always meet that bar, but every international company out there will tell you that the U.S. and Europe are much more stable and dependable environments to do business in than China.

Musk is taking a big gamble that he doesn't just end up on the wrong side of the Chinese govt in the future (perhaps when their domestic market steps up its ability to produce a more comparable quality electric and/or autonomous vehicle, and the Chinese want to help the upstarts get ""over the hump"" and take Tesla out of the market)."

But then there is another ethical question: does the car hit 3 people with low social scores, or 2 people - one with a high social, the other with the low social, but combined less than the 3 people. Maybe it is better to lose 3 low scorers than 1 high scorer?

Does cooperating with the Chinese Government then go further and awards Tesla bonuses for hitting people with extremely low scores (political dissidents and Hong Kongers and the like) to the point that they would cause Teslas to be in crash situations in order to remove some people who they can't capture into their ""Re-education camps"" (Prisons to keep their Organs functioning for later harvesting)"

"The units in China that give them such a high number are garbage vehicles, honestly, but it's OK, because a garbage EV still gets you around for the most part. They also have a shit ton of garbage little electric scooters, because they banned a lot of 2cycle 2 wheeled vehicles. 

The reality is that wealthy Chinese want to emulate HK and Taiwanese wealth culture, which has long held highly engineered vehicles by makers like Mercedes in high esteem as status symbols and displays of wealth, and in the new social climate of the Party pushing for EV adoption, that car is a Tesla. There is no competition for elite vehicles that make the Party happy, and if you're talking about a wealthy mainland Chinese person, I promise you, they are bare minimum concerned with appearing to be favorable to the party, and likely are also directly supportive of it, doing business with it or a member of significance or related to someone who is.

That combined with tax incentives means that there is a huge market for Teslas among wealthy Chinese citizens on the mainland, and I suspect that for quite a while, they will be essentially the only  one represented in large numbers.

China also wants to break out of making cheap shit, and make fancy shit, so they will be happy to have Tesla operating in China, making lots of cars and batteries that they export to the rest of the world because it adds prestige to their export product."
China change the rule for companies that make 100% BEVs in China i think.
TESLA is a straight up exception to this because china really wants them and are willing to compromise because they get something in return anyways.
">I figure any worries I would have the Tesla team has already attempted to address in some manner. 

Tesla's biggest asset is probably software and batteries. With the Maxwell acquisition, they'll probably have a new way of making batteries that most people aren't doing for now. The motor's could be a big advantage, but from the little I understand, that advantage isn't in the motor itself but in the software driving the motors. The new motors they started putting into the cars require good software to get the best performance out of them.

Anyone in China could take a Tesla and tear it down and see how they made the body, ditto on the motor as well. So those things can be copied and replicated. This is harder to do with batteries and because the software in the car is now stored in an encrypted enclave on the AP 3.0 hardware, harder to do with software.

As for why the CCP allowed this? Who knows. I've just assumed its pressure from rich businessmen wanting easy access to Tesla's. There could be additional incentives at play as well. For instance, Musk talked about getting into the mining game. China has access to some of these resources. Its not a stretch to imagine maybe some trading went on with getting a Tesla factory and potential resources in exchange for Boring tunnels as well as Electric tunneling machines. You want to talk about cities with traffic problems, just look at China. They're a good place to try and apply the Boring tunnel future to without all the red tape you need to jump through in the US.

Edit: I made the comment on TBC in China as a hypothetical without actually realizing its already happening. Funny."
If a company in China makes a car cheaper than they do that has comparable range and performance then Tesla could potentially lose sales in China.

How do you incentivize something when nobody in the incentive period actually knew the incentive existed?  Consistency!"
"> The US legal and regulatory system enforces more consistency (from a business POV) than China.

Yeah, in general in the US you can't legally tax or exempt specific cars by make and model.  At most you can define a set of criteria and then anything that fits in that criteria gets treated in the same way.

Now, the US can do things like set tariffs based on country of origin, and it can set them based on fairly detailed criteria like cars with 8 cylinders under 2000lbs gross weight with two doors and rear wheel drive that don't include radios.  In theory that could be gamed to some extent to get it down to a single make and model in practice, but any company could construct a car that fits the criteria and get the same treatment, and the government would need to be able to defend the criteria as being reasonable in court based on something more than whether the company that makes the one car that is covered made campaign donations.  There is also the rulemaking process so these policies can't just be changed overnight or without comment, and of course everything is public.

The US certainly has policies that primarily benefit one or a very small number of companies (the ""Bank of Boeing"" comes to mind), but you're absolutely right that rule of law and impartiality is still fairly well-protected in the US in comparison to most countries.  I'd toss in most Western countries as well, as plenty of those have semi-nationalized industries that get very cozy treatment and so on."

"That doesn't impact their mission. If that happens, they will have achieved their mission."
"Comparable performance would necessitate the replication of autopilot.

I promise that Elon's pitch about Tesla's as self driving, working in tunnels, ride sharing, coordinating with high speed trains, and all that have a lot to do with China supporting the company. They likely don't care if they can't ""copy"" a Tesla identically. They don't really want to, because the car is inherently valuable to a subset of the Chinese population because it's an elite import. 

There may be a deal that requires them to also produce a Chinese market economy vehicle exclusively oriented to rapidly filling the needs of auto taxis, but maybe not. The Chinese elites want these for themselves, and the Communist Party wants people to not be able to drive themselves around. It's unlikely that Elon will share his autonomy network with them directly, but it is likely that he had to agree to some form of directive influence over it, like the Party would be able to ""in an emergency"" create areas that are off limits to passengers being dropped off by autonomous vehicles, or possibly lists of who is actively in a Tesla being driven autonomously and where they are headed.

There was definitely some form of negotiation, and they are both likely going to benefit from the cooperation in a very big way, and it's unlikely that China needs that equation to involve ""knocking off"" Teslas, because a knockoff just wouldn't have the same value by any stretch of the imagination."

"> there are multiple studies showing the total CO2 from ICE and EV pr. km is more or less equal if the EV is power by coal electricity.

That's an outright lie. Either you were lied to, or you're knowingly lying. 

The only way that ICE and EVs are even remotely close in terms of CO2 is that the manufacture of a battery pack and EV motor has a higher emissions costs than the manufacture of an ICE engine. This means that it takes a few years for an EV to make up for the difference due to being dramatically less polluting, even on a 100% coal-powered grid, than an ICE. Check out this video for more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RhtiPefVzM

TL;DR: A small battery EV (like a LEAF) breaks even on emissions after just 4 years, in a 100% coal-powered grid. Which means it's generating a LOT less emissions per kilometer than the ICE, even when powered by coal."
Just because Tesla says their mission is to make everyone go electric doesn’t mean that is the entirety of their mission. They would still like to exist.

of course he would *prefer* not to go bankrupt, and he would also prefer if other companies would take the lead & do some of this stuff, so he doesn't have to juggle 5 different companies by himself.  so ideally he stays in business, but he at least wants those big goals to be met, even if other companies get there first.  it's a 180 from where they've been going, so it represents a huge pull on the industry."

China wants to - needs to - lead the world in renewables and green tech so they can continue expanding. Coopting the Tesla brand helps. Getting easier access to electric car manufacturing techniques helps. Play both sides."
"OK, then go re-read my note that you are responding to.  I was clearly--see first sentence in my response--making a comparative statement between China and the U.S. 
 Providing examples of U.S. inconsistency is neither here nor there, unless you are arguing that the U.S. is more inconsistent than China."
"> Yea, they're just putting children in concentration camps,

Arresting/detaining people for breaking the law is common everywhere on earth...

> and started several wars that have resulted in many millions of innocent deaths. 

Many millions?  What war are you talking about exactly?

> Not to mention the US killing so many of its citizens through inaction thanks to its health care system. So much better /s

Hospitals in the US are required to treat everyone that comes in the ER.  You really are talking out your ass here...."
"> The US and China are viewed in an almost identical light in the rest of the world.

Only by idiots.

One nation allows citizens to speak freely, the other does not.  

One nation has independent courts capable of enforcing the law as written, the other does not.

One nation allows citizens to vote for their leaders, the other does not.

One nation allows freedom of religion, the other does not.  

One nation allows businesses to operate without state influence/control, the other does not."

"Whatabout Whatabout, ------ whataboutism is a tactic not an answer.  There is no real Chinese media separate from the Chinese party line.  You wouldn't be having this argument inside China on the internet.   Only in a bar quietly looking over your shoulder.  That is the difference."
"> Did you miss the entirety of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars? 

Are you incapable of looking up facts before you spew off bullshit?  Millions of people were not killed for praying....

> Two wars that were started under false pretenses, one of which continues to this day? 

The Taliban took responsibility for 9/11, did they not?  It’s pretty straightforward why Afghanistan was invaded.

You could possibly argue that Iraq was unjustified....but pretending like Saddam Hussein should still be in power is going to make you sound stupid.  The world is a better place because the US killed Saddam.

> The wars that let ISIS rise to power?

So now you’re going to pretend ISIS has is capable of seizing real power?  How would be the US’s fault exactly?"
You don't understand the words of the person you are replying to.
Do you actually ask those questions with the expectation other people don’t know about them? If you think *that’s* evil as fuck I’ve got a LOT of things to show you.

It is without a doubt more important to make EV’s the standard. But this doesn’t mean Tesla doesn’t want to exist still and will make sacrifices to stay afloat. Such as the still patented technology they are keeping from other car companies.
"reverse engineering meens: taking it apart and getting from the original product (reverse) to how to build it.

this is the definition of the word.
if you think they will ""take over the factory, production and all"" your dreaming and i'm willing to bet against you publicly."
"Oh, so now past atrocities don't matter? Says who? What makes you get to say that something that happened in my lifetime is suddenly now irrelevant? That members of my family died over are suddenly irrelevant?

You can't talk about that. This is fundamentally the problem with my fellow Americans, who happen to not be people of color: you drank the koolaid. You believe the exceptionalism lie. You think you are special, that the USA is special. That we are above everyone else, better. That our system is superior. You haven't come right out and said it but it's very clear. You downplay or makes excuses for American genocide and murder, corruption, take down of citizens, citizens placed in camps. You disregard USA installing shadow governments in other countries, creating instability, outright murdering others leaders and claiming victory. You rationalize it all and then have the nerve to call China bad. Lol. 

And even after reading all of that, you still won't realize how indoctrinated you are. 

""And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.""

The matrix has you."
"Sorry you don't get to say one country is evil while your country is evil.

It's not whataboutism. Calling out hypocrites.

Only thing different about America is it gives you the illusion of freedom."
"Of course I do. I'm just getting to the point.

Lol at your silly little arrogance."
"So now you want to compare evils? And yes I think most whites are oblivious and really don't care because that stuff doesn't concern them. United States is good for them, they think."
"What I'm saying is it's stupid to respond to China doing a good thing with ""China is bad umkay"".

I put it into context with how bad USA is and suddenly everyone gets defensive of USA. 

Imagine if post is ""USA decides to give tax credit for electric vehicles"" and first response is ""USA is just doing what's good for them, they violate human rights, I don't trust them"". 

It would feel like that post just didn't belong. And it wouldn't."
[deleted]
"More likely they’ll hire or subvert people responsible for installing and maintaining the production equipment, using Tesla’s experience to rapidly refine newer iterations of their own production lines. Again, that’s much easier to do in a Chinese factory than an American one.

I admit directly taking over was hyperbole, mostly."
"Strawman argument, who said China was inherently evil?  Just a country following its own interests that doesn't allow public dissent and savagely deals its own citizens to keep it that way.  

You can say whatever you like about good old problematic America out here, and you wont get run over by a tank. 
 That may change at some point but for now that is a difference."
">	So now you want to compare evils?

My god this is so rich 😂 that’s literally what you were just doing!

>	And yes I think most whites are oblivious and really don’t care because that stuff doesn’t concern them. 

Lol what echo chamber did you come from? Literally everyone I know is aware of those things. My father who barely graduated high school in the 1970s probably knows more about those things than you do. You’re not some enlightened scholar of global moral crime just because you can recite Chomsky et al’s talking points. Broaden your horizons beyond US history, it’ll shock you. The US is positively tame in context."
[deleted]
but still: they could just hire guys from the american factory = WAY cheaper and MUCHHH less bad press ;)
"It's not a straw man argument. The general gist is one of the disgust with China. 

And American propaganda wins every single time people like you say something silly like ""freedom of speech separates us"". 

Freedom of speech means nothing when you have no power or real desire to express that speech.

What you all should be saying is ""yes China does a lot of fuckedupshit and America does a lot of fucked up shit. Both are the Death Star. ""

Instead, all I see are Americans defending the US and talking about how you aren't allowed to have a dissenting opinion in China. you don't even realize the propaganda that has a hold of your mind to where you don't even need a dissenting opinion. It would be fucking laughable if it wasn't so sad."
"No, I am not comparing evils.  I am saying we can't say these guys are bad when this country is bad. they are both the death star. you cant cry about the death star while on the death star."
[deleted]
*What* the fuck are you talking about? That’s one of the most irredeemably ridiculous comments I’ve read on this site. I’m not sure I can do anything but laugh and move on.
"The US hasn’t killed half a million Middle Easterners. The only way you get to that number is by including all military, police, insurgent, and civilian deaths in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. So the total KIA from both sides. And in the place where most of those deaths happened, Iraq, the US no longer has a significant presence. Not exactly ongoing as you described it. At best you could say that the decisions of the Bush Administration led to the deaths of half a million (maybe more) middle easterners, but certainly that many people have not been killed by US forces. But nobody here is saying that the US hasn’t done brutal shit for questionable or downright wrong reasons. What’s being brought up is that there’s almost always a substantial difference in character, in intent, in execution, in scale, or all of the above from things like the Trail of Tears or the thing’s we’re criticizing China for here.

Civilian death counts in Hong Kong have nothing to do with whether or not China is suppressing freedom in Hong Kong. The fact you’re only talking about that aspect of the unrest indicates you have no problem with China’s policy of enforced conformity with state norms, whether it means stamping out hopes for continued personal liberty and self-determination in Hong Kong, or forcing millions of Muslims into concentration camps for re-education because “hey, nobody died”. Neither of those ongoing ordeals are at all like what France or any of the other G7 nations do to their people, although the methods of dealing with the protests in France certainly have been criticized just as harshly as those employed by China up to now. France however didn’t deploy multiple mechanized battalions in a staging area outside Paris as a public threat.

I think the idea of a country willingly allowing their military members to be tried in any kind of foreign court is ridiculous, and not conducive to justice. I agree the DoD needs to be more aggressive about prosecuting soldiers and leadership for violent violations of the UCMJ while in theater."
"Durr durr says the American who loves his American propaganda. You really don't give a SHIT about the evils done by the USA, do you? LOL@ ""irredeemable"". No man, supporting the USA is irredeemable. Its the fucking Death Star. How do you support the fucking Death Star?"
Stay in school kid
What a great response from a guy whom I am sure didn't even graduate from college.
I’ll show you my diplomas if you show me yours ;)
because the tesla killer car is a figment of the media's imagination. more ev cars are not a problem
"Much like Apple, however, I do suspect there will ultimately be a reversal wherein the other big manufacturers will be able to catch up and then compete hard on price. Maybe in 5-10 years, and IMO closer to 10 than 5. That will only happen when the technology is so mature that new iterations don't deliver much incremental improvement anymore. By then, Tesla will be a big player in the industry and I suspect that along the way some smaller players will be forced into bankruptcy by the change or else consolidated into larger players through mergers.

People don't appreciate how much there is that sets Tesla vehicles apart until they get into and drive them. It's hard to see when your frame of reference is the legacy auto industry but it's instantly apparent when you live with it for just a week. People and analysts don't appreciate that Tesla has not one but numerous differentiators that really set it apart and the electric drive is kind of irrelevant at this point. Each differentiator on its own is a credible distinction but when they're all stacked together they're a big, alligator-filled moat. The rich user interface, the software-driven control and updates, the purpose-driven in-house engineering, the vertical integration, the battery technology, the charging infrastructure, etc.

The fact that they are EVs is the *least* of the factors that differentiates Teslas from other cars but that's what everyone seems to focus on because it's the low hanging fruit. It's just so obvious, right? Slap an electric motor and a battery on your car and it's a Tesla killer. Easy, breezy, lemon-squeezy. Except that's literally Tesla's weakest moat. I'd argue it's no longer even a differentiating factor. Tesla has made it such that making EVs is a prerequisite for competing in the future of the automotive industry and the legacy vendors are still struggling to catch up to even that. That's how noncompetitive they are and that's why a Tesla killer is a long way off."
"I still don't understand Jaguar. Stop trying to poach Tesla with the $3000 incentive. Those people are happy with the new technology already. Go after people like my parents. Boomers who like their legacy brands. Boomers hold off because they see Tesla as an upstart without the infrastructure to repair vehicles. They also hate the tablet control station and want buttons.

edit: Jaguar* not Audi"
I call them Zunes.
"Wow I just was browsing the ipace build, and while they have parking assist on their base 70k model, you need 5k more for adaptive cruise and 5k more on top of that for lane keep assist?"
"It might be because:

1. They're really not trying
2. Their business model isn't going to work with EVs
3. They are laser-focused on competing with Tesla when they should compete against ICE vehicles
4. They don't have any charging infrastructure
5. They really want EVs to fail because short-term profit > a livable planet"
"The problem is the Tesla Killers are actually out to compete with the Model S and Model X. Audi? Jaguar? Really, those are not going to compete with the Model 3, the one actually eating everyone's lunch. 

As for BMW's i3, the Bolt, or the Leaf or similar more ""affordable"" cars, they don't have the tech versatility or the range to compete head-to-head with the Model 3; not to mention lacking the performance or cool looks. 

Plus, one point to make with Tesla - they bypass the dealer retail model, something established car makers cannot actually do.  Consequently the (what, 10%?) profit accruing to car dealers - often those are the richest guys in some small towns - instead accrue to Tesla, bolstering profits and giving them a bigger price competition option. 

Not to mention Tesla's lead in battery tech.  Their automated production.  the reasons go on and on, but the TL:DR is other car companies have a long way to go to be competitive."
"Superchargers are the #1 issue/ feature. If I buy the Porsche Taycan where do i charge it on trips longer then it's range? At 220v 40amp public chargers for 8 hours? At the extremely rare porsche dealers? Having electric cars without fast charging is near pointless. It's owning a petrol car with no gas stations beyond your house. If VW/ Mercedes/ BMW and the others were smart they would ""buy into"" the Tesla chargers. Tesla would get more capital to build more chargers and the competitors would get access into the only existing fast charging network."
"Tesla's moat in order of priority.  

1. Range, range, range.  I like to drive for 4 hours at 75 mph between stops, and Tesla can almost make that - no other EV is close.  If I could get more range with my Tesla I would!  There are all of the details around battery chemistry, BMS, giga-factory, etc.., but as a consumer I just wanna drive fast & far.   
2. Automation.  Auto-pilot makes driving so much better, it is a joy to drive instead of a chore.  I cannot wait for FSD to be available & safe.  
3. SC Network.  Goes hand in hand with range.  Although I don't use it often, it provides peace of mind that I can do a long road trip when I want.  
4. Acceleration.  I own the slowest Tesla (probably) out there (M3, LR, RWD) and it is still too fast, it makes the little boy in me giggle.  I now understand why car-a-holics like cars.  
5. Design.  The futuristic design of a large, integrated screen, front to back glass, door handles, etc... adds to the overall package that this is a truly different vehicle than your grandfather's BMW."
Jaguar will have to learn the hard way that there is no incentive large enough for a Tesla owner to give up access to the supercharger network
"Hopefully Tesla isn't too good for their own good. We need more hats in this ring, but if everyone who tries looks at is as ""beat Tesla or why bother?"" and other car companies see all the companies that failed and don't even try, that's not good.

Edit: I understand the future is electric, but the business world is full of companies that went ride or die on their current model, and died, and those companies don't even have the knowledge that the last time they fucked up they were bailed out. The idea that every company is good at seeing and reacting to the writing on the wall is just incorrect. 

Some could easily wonder why invest $234820938908 in trying to catch Telsa today when we just saw 5 companies fail and we can just keep pumping out trucks until basically everything has been worked out for us?"
"EV buyers are smart. Who has the best batteries? Who has the motors? Who has the best performance?

We desperately need some competition in EV segment from established brands, but we need something better than Leaf, Bolt, and i3 please."
"The thing is.....no manufacturer ever claimed to make a ""Tesla killer""."
Meanwhile tesla is like you fool this isn't even my final form *screams to power up *
This sub: Duh
"It surprises me that other manufacturers are so focused on competing directly instead of going after the market segments that Tesla hasn’t gotten to yet and gaining the early mover advantage. They’re simply not going to beat Tesla on a sedan. Maybe a sports coupe or convertible priced lower and available sooner than the Roadster. Maybe a pickup truck or cargo van. I’d sign up instantly for a minivan; I’m bummed that VW hasn’t even started taking preorders for the Buzz. 

On the other hand, I think they’re missing the point of Tesla altogether. Tesla’s strategy was never to just make electric cars. Their strategy from day one was to make a car that’s compelling in every way and also happens to be electric. The Model S isn’t just the best electric car out there, it’s the best car period at that price point. Same with the model 3- there’s no other $50,000 car with comparable acceleration, handling, and fuel economy; nothing even comes close. And nobody on the US market has anything close to Tesla’s autopilot, which in and of itself is a compelling reason to choose Tesla over any other marque and a justification for spending the premium. 

If they want to compete with Tesla, they have to actually compete with Tesla. Build vehicles that outperform the Tesla, or offer a radically better value proposition. Build something similar to the 3 but not as good for *under* $30k. Build something Tesla doesn’t make at all like a pickup or van. And catch up on Autopilot."
"This is purely my opinion - here why I think the notion of a legacy ICE manufacturer is unrealistic.
I think it’s highly unlikely any ICE manufacturer will kill Tesla. It’s not impossible, but it would require them to write down the value of most of their manufacturing, design and engineering, supply chain and marketing. In other words they’d have to flush most of what they do down the drain the restart as a manufacturer hyper focused on BEVs. 
And of course they won’t do that. They will try to straddle the fence- continuing to make money on ICE while creating a whole new infrastructure within the company focused on BEV. Yes there will be some synergies - procuring steel and rubber and glass etc.  But the real special sauce for BEV will be somewhat divorced from what these companies do - the self driving, the collection of sensor data, AI. And it will create a jealousy within these companies as the legacy people grow disaffected with being starved while the new division gets showered with money. 
Ultimately when these companies try to make these two parallel models coexist the newer will get starved or infighting will squander the resources to where these companies can’t compete in the BEV space."
"Talked with a friend last night and he has like 12 cars and when I told him a new P100D was in the $106k range he was shitting bricks.  He just bought a S class for $120k and told me how it was a POS and that was when I told him he should’ve bought a P100D for less money.  He thought the price was still $150,000.  People just don’t know."
">Tesla’s Model X and Model S each boast more than 300 miles of range, and the **~~cheaper~~** **cheapest** Model 3 travels 240 miles between charges. Jaguar’s $69,500 I-Pace is rated at 234 miles, and Audi’s $74,800 e-tron registers 204 miles. 

FTFY Bloomberg. Definitely different context now"
Well when they're making a car to beat the 2012 model s and meanwhile it's 2019 and Tesla released two more models I'm not surprised
"Very even reporting for Bloomberg, thanks."
"The only way Tesla gets 'killed' is if the EV market itself gets killed. Tesla has a faraway lead of the EV pie, as the EV market grows so will Tesla's piece of the pie.

&#x200B;

So ironically, having EV competitors dubbed 'Tesla killers' only serves as free advertisment for Tesla."
"This reminds me of all the ""iPad Killers"" that came out around 2011."
"After watching Sean Mitchell's interview with Sandy Munro, it seems that Tesla is years ahead of everybody else except for the manufacturing of the bodies,  If we want to go by Munro's comments.

 And by some accounts the one machine to stamp the model Y? bodies should take care of Sandy's concern."
"The entire “Tesla killer” logic assumes the auto industry is some kind of “winner take all” market. 

In what way does that mirror the existing auto industry?"
"I’m just finishing 700 mile trip, nonstop, reading this post on the screen of my Model 3. Didn’t realize that before I even finish the post, I was done charging and ready to continue on my way. What does the driver of the Audi and Jaguar alternative do in order to do long road trips? Is it possible?"
Someone at Bloomberg stoped taking their Blue pills today...
">”If a customer is choosing the I-Pace over the comparable Tesla, they are making the conscious decision: I don’t want the Tesla,” said Ed Kim, an analyst at the car-market research and consulting firm AutoPacific. “You really have to be someone who doesn’t like Tesla, who doesn’t want the Tesla product, in order to go for this.”

Ed fucking nailed it — effectively:  *if you’re an EV buyer and not buying a Tesla, you’re really not making a **product**-based decision ... you either hate Tesla or love _your other_ brand so much you’re opting for the lesser product*"
"I like how Kia/hyundai are supplementing the market rather than being a ""killer"" they serve the segments that tesla isnt serving yet.. which is what elon wanted."
"There is no killing Tesla now. The only thing that might derail it, is if the lose Elon. The other manufacturers are stuck because to catch up they're have to invest billions and not see profits from EVs for years as they ramp up battery factories."
"I like how the article completely left out the elephant in the room: Tesla Model 3 sales. I understand, it's at a way lower price point, but it has better features and range then it's competitors at almost half the price. Hmmmmm. The X and the S are their ""luxury"" models, but come on.   


Maybe I just read too much about the electric car market so these articles piss me off too easily."
"LOL Bloomberg. Even when an article gives an apparently positive spin on Tesla it leaves out some very important information: the price and range of the Tesla Model 3 Long range. From the article:

>Tesla’s Model X and Model S each boast more than 300 miles of range, and the cheaper Model 3 travels 240 miles between charges. Jaguar’s $69,500 I-Pace is rated at 234 miles, and Audi’s $74,800 e-tron registers 204 miles.

This is the only paragraph that gives any range and price numbers. What it leaves out is that the price of range of the Tesla Model 3 LR is $47,990 and its range is 310 miles. This information is a (the?) key reason why no one is buying the iPace or the e-tron: the price to range ratio. Why would anyone buy these other cars when you get so many more miles for a lower price. Never mind the technology. Never mind autopilot. Never mind the acceleration."
"May I correct your grammar? The last sentence should read, ""if it were the obvious choice..."" the word ""was"" isn't correct there."
"with elon at the helm, the pace of technological improvements at tesla are probably way too fast for any traditional automotive company to catch up on. he takes the silicon valley model of constant improvements to the next level. tesla is what, 5 years minimum ahead of the next competition at least?"
"The interesting part of this, I feel, is the understanding that someone choosing the Audi, MB, or Jaguar offerings are willfully saying the DO NOT want a Tesla, not that they DO want the others.  Looking at the gaps in comparison with charging speeds, charging infrastructure, range, efficiency, OTA and update ability - those choosing anything else are turning a blind eye to Tesla and the myriad advantages."
Tesla killers are now the victim
"We shouldn't compare Apple to Tesla. In terms of the impact that Tesla has had in the car market its similar to the Buggati Veyron and captures the imagination of what could be the future and automotive excellence. Through just sheer numbers it has one of the best AWD systems or four-wheel-drive systems. It has changed everyone's perception of speed and acceleration. The internal systems like self-driving and safety features are unbelievable with its current price point, it's competing with sports car's and luxury high-end vehicles and destroying them. People are saying they handle better than BMW's, Audi's and other high-end cars. These are expensive cars and pricing needs to be able to reach the masses before it happens. On paper, it blows the competition away this isn't an Apple hardly anyone is able to compete with most of there product lineup."
"We actually \*need\* Tesla Killers - rather, ""Killers"" is a silly word, what we need is ""Tesla Alternatives"". Musk himself has stated that it is not Teslas aim to be the best and only EV company, rather their goal is to  accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, which includes the entire automotive market moving to EVs."
"Two things. First, the ""_ _ _ _ -killer"" is just a trope used by headlines. Nothing's ever been killed by a _ _ _ _ -killer, at least not by being helped by _ _ _ _ failing to adapt.

Secondly, I saw an interview with Elon Musk once that explained it. Basically, he said it's pretty easy to come up with a prototype that works well. But making it mass-production ready is 100x harder. This would certainly explain why there's been so many concept cars that never went anywhere."
It's really the supercharger network.  I looked into the Audi & jaguar.  In the end the lack of the super charger network means that I couldn't take it any distance.
I think “Tesla Killer” is the new “WoW Killer”
"They have to be able to CATCH UP to Tesla to be a ""Killer"".."
"Can we just stop with this Tesla Killer stuff? When a new ford truck comes out its not the Chevy Killer, when a new Ferrari comes out its not the Lambourghini killer, and so on. Its utterly rediculous and backwards thinking to say that the Tesla will be killed and replaced."
Jaguar claims the E Type is a 'Tesla Killer' - although the sale ratio is 8/100
"Maybe to niche of a comment, but remember when every MMO was going to be the World of Warcraft killer... lol

I feel whenever u address something as the “that product” killer you’re admitting to its superiority and the idea of “killing” it becomes this pointless undertaking."
"Positive article headline from Bloomberg about Tesla, wow. I wish the media would drop the dumb ""Tesla killers"" description, though. Embrace ""ICE killers"" instead. Of course they won't do that so long as big oil and auto are lining their pockets with millions in ad dollars."
"The supercharging network, range, and autopilot is the only reason I stick with my model x. All this hype around model 3 that, Tesla demand this ends up overshadowing everything happening behind the scenes. Their service has gone downhill. Repairs are rushed out. I don't want to be that person but to get good repairs I inspect everything thoroughly to make sure repairs are done right. This has annoyed many employees I bet. Waiting weeks for service only to have a tech say no problems found is annoying too. Every visit I have concrete evidence that there is something wrong so that doesn't happen. The only reason other manufacturers can't catch up is because they still don't take Tesla seriously. They are scared to invest the amount Tesla has. I hope in a few years there is better competition. But I also hope Tesla can pull themselves together and do better. Alot of people may have perfect cars. But I should have known better than to buy a Tesla during the *ramp up* and while they were rushing to push as many out as possible. But hey I have unlimited supercharging so that's a plus. I'm not hating on Tesla, but I've personally seen things from tesla that don't become public and it aligns perfectly with what I think.


I love tesla. I really do. But right now from the outside, Tesla is like a paradise until you finally join and see the truth."
"Most of the Tesla’s competitors don’t even have a frunk.

I’m not even going to consider an electric car if it doesn’t have a frunk. That’s an elementary engineering packaging decision. It just shows that the competitors were in a rush and didn’t design their cars thoroughly."

"Producing EVs, with the experience of a petrol car seems harder than perceived. It REALLY is a different kind of car, requires other design basics.
Experience in (very) similar fields of work can then be a burden i.s.o. an advantage."
"That's because they aren't trying to ""kill"" Tesla. Tesla killer is a media buzzword"
Maybe the car companies should focus on building a Tesla killer instead of paying the media to write articles about fictitious Tesla killers.
"""tesla killer"" like ""iphone killer""  or ""flagship killer"" is all about clicks"
"It kills me how the media reacts when some traditional car company will talk about coming out with an EV with shitty range and no features. 

They're like ""Chevy is coming out with an EV that looks like shit and has a range of 187 miles... TESLA KILLER!"""
"What I don't like about this is that Tesla's original goal wasn't market dominance.  Their goal was far more altruistic.  

\>   to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing  compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.  - Musk '13

Opening up their supercharger network would allow other manufacturers to help diversify the marketplace and make electric vehicles more compelling.  It'd also shed a bit of that elitist aura we've all been trying to shed."
"I read an article on CNN the other day suggesting EVs will *average* 300 miles on a charge by 2025. That's like.... 6 whole years from now when Tesla sells the Model 3 with a 310 mile range for about $40,000 today. That suggests to me that itll be 2023-2025 before another car will come along that can even really match what Teslas can do today. By then, Tesla will be probably be selling 500 mile versions of the Model 3/S/X. 

The main thing holding other companies back is charging infrastructure. Tesla's is just so robust, and you cannot charge at a Tesla Supercharger with a non-Tesla. As a consumer, I am actually a little bothered by that honestly. My fear is that this practice could lead other EV makers to create their own proprietary charging infrastructure. EVs end up being like Xbox or Playstation, or Google vs. Amazon to the detriment of the customer. I think Tesla could rake in a LOT of money in electricity sales by charging non-Teslas a slightly higher rate. That would be a huge boost to the EV market overall."
"I think the Taycan could be a realistic EV alternative because of supposedly good performance, and i assume a more luxurious interior. But no way will it overtake the model 3 in popularity if nothing else because of the price."
"Tesla wants other companies to compete with them on EVs, and it's not good for anyone that legacy manufacturers seem to be unable to sell EVs. Too much internal conflicting interests in legacy manufacturers, billions invested in ICE motors and factories, dealer network massively disrupted, and decades of institutional knowledge wasted if they genuinely embrace EVs.  Blank slate companies like Tesla, Rivian, others might be the only hope, guess we'll see"
Some very relevant commentary and good background: [undecided with Matt Ferrell](https://youtu.be/MyfRM3Z3v6Y)
"Just like World of Warcraft, the only thing that will beat a Tesla Model [whatever] is the Tesla model that comes after it."
Why does Tesla need to be killed? They make good cars and provide great competition and an incentive for other car companies to enter the market. Fucking media articles these days.
"Don't really see why the i-Pace is doing worse than the e-tron. The i-Pace seems a much better, and cheaper, car."
"I always did my best to warn everybody to not buy the IPace or Étron and instead wait until the cheap lease if they really want the car

I did a horrible job admittedly... and I convinced no one.

What happens next for the buyers? Well we know, $40k+ in 1 year depreciation.  (just take a look at Teslas used inventory prices to get an idea)... and let’s hope that it actually works; because if it doesn’t you are really screwed.

It was so predictable.. but as the author of the article best puts it “you will only buy this if you don’t want a Tesla”"
"Hypothetically, if something like a Toyota Camry or Highlander was an EV, if Tesla stopped progressing for whatever reason, then I would be concerned for Tesla.

But cars like the Audi E-Tron and that BMW golf cart-looking EV are not a threat to Tesla, feature or price-wise. I do think Tesla eventually has to draw somewhat of a line in the sand. Do they want to be more of an upscale car company? Do they want to be an Apple-like tech company? The way they present their product and run the company eventually will have to converge into an overall stable message, but they aren’t in rough waters or anything due to competition at the moment."
"Heaven help these other auto manufacturers if the full ev tax credit limit gets renewed/extended or amended from # of vehicles sold phaseout to the time limit phaseout. 

Cause right now a full 7k off the purchase price of a new Tesla (assuming Tesla doesn’t increase prices again in lock step with a credit renewal) would make another backlog similar to summer 2018 from a rush of orders by people who’ve been on the fence."
Like iPhone killer. LOL. Doesn’t exist.
Every X-killer has failed and been killed.
"We're going to start comparing apples to oranges here in no time. Tesla's great EV, a groundbreaker, serves specific markets.  Kias serve others, Chevy, Hyundai, VW.  There's some overlap, some unique vehicles that stand alone, and none of them are going to die.

That honourable death lies squarely with car companies who don't move fast enough."
"Huh, you don't say."
I would LOVE to see a 2012 S85 compete against a new ipace and e-Tron.  I think we would all know who would win.
"I will take a fully-electric Mercedes over a Tesla any day of the week.  I do not like the look and styling of Tesla.  Mercedes are far more luxurious and premium over Tesla.  Tesla Model 3 is way too plasticky on the inside.  And I think that these Tesla killer articles about other electric vehicles are just planted articles similar to how we have had an abundance of iPhone killer articles.  These articles are just trying to position Tesla as the best top of the line electric car.  Maybe now, in fifteen years, hell no.  You know that with fully automatic auto pilot, Tesla will eventually have YouTube streaming in the car.  We will get to a point where nobody will know where anything is because they are passively being driven places.  And I bet that we will eventually get to a place where speed limit signs and traffic lights are a thing of the past.  I drove yesterday for the first time in four months.  God damn was it so relaxing driving myself compared to being a Lyft passenger, a bus passenger, or a passenger in someone else’s car.  And the freedom where I didn’t depend on someone else was beautiful."
"Tesla fanatics fail to understand the global aspect of the car industry. Many countries have sponsored their automotive sectors, and will pour infinite funds into that industry to make sure it is a winner. Note that there is a global overcapacity in the car industry, as you have Korea, Japan, China all pushing full blast in this sector, and many European countries cannot afford to lose those manufacturing jobs. So Tesla is going to meet serious resistance and will not be a dominant company. When it comes down to subsidies, how is Tesla going to survive when China and others will give possibly negative interest loans to this favored industry? Tesla has to dilute its stock, and the old adage ""we lose money on every car, but we make it up in volume"" certainly applies to Tesla. Electric cars are so easy to make, the barriers to entry are not that high. You can license software for self driving from any number of companies, and the batteries for Tesla come from Panasonic (Japan), and the batteries for others come from LG Chem (Korea).  Tesla has a pretty good product, but in the end the car business is a slim margin business, and only really disciplined players with great banking relationships will survive. America will be lucky to keep 1 car company. It's not clear which of GM and Ford will survive. They each have their strengths and weaknesses. The Chinese have a ton of electric cars they could tweak for the US market, but there is no incentive from their fearless leader about making an even greater trade deficit. Elon's best company is SpaceX, because he raided Nasa for engineers already trained at the public's expense. His car company can survive for a long time, but I doubt it will ever make much money, because there are too many car companies, chasing a flat market."
"Maybe if they actually release an exciting product, then maybe they'd actually have a chance.   

Taycan, I'm looking at you. Your base price is 130k yet your performance might only be comparable to a 2018 4-doors sedan that costs half of what you cost. You do look pretty slick tho."
"Any one can explain to me why sales of Teslas periodically spikes and drops? Genuinely curious,thanks."
"Tesla cars are better than ICE cars. A Tesla killer shall be better than a Tesla car. Therefore, any real Tesla killer will crush the ICE cars and will be instead an ICE killer. Thats why legacy automakers cannot make a Tesla killer, because It Will destroy their other ICE models sales overnight"
"I think what would really take it to Tesla is if another manufacturer could make an EV with 250mi+ range that competes with a Honda Civic in price. 

The biggest hesitation for me as a prospective buyer is the large up front cost of the Tesla. It’s a $40,000 car which puts it squarely in the luxury market. Sure there are folks who will use its gas savings as a way to ration its cost down more closely to a civic but it depends greatly on driving habits and doesn’t negate the fact that the up front cost is still a hard pill to swallow for most people who are looking for just a regular all around eco car in the $20-$30k range. 

The Tesla is a BMW competitor that has low maintenance cost in its pro column rather than an economical mass market car that frontloads its cost. Most wallets don’t see it that way and that’s not wrong. 

Not a lot of people have $5k lying around in down payment or $500-$600/mo budgeted for a car. I certainly don’t and by no means am I poor. I make a decent salary and have no debt. I just can’t afford to tie up so much up front money in a depreciating car when I’ve got to consider homeownership, etc.  

Imo the biggest barrier to entry with any EV, Tesla included, is their reliance on future savings over time outweighing comparably larger initial investment both financially and practically. 

If Honda had a Civic EV that cost $26k and came with a 250mi range I would not be hesitating in the slightest."
Oh hey look a positive article for once
"Audi is shoveling commercials onto primetime,  apparently using an ad company that thinks it's a great idea to remind people of all their pain points about buying EVs (""they don't work in cold weather!"" ""range is a big issue!"") as though watching slo-mo images of Audi e-trons spinning out on snow overcomes these worries.    


Really, marketing EVs by these legacy companies couldn't crater sales worse than if that was their plan in the first place."
[deleted]
they should be killing ICE cars in the same price range.
Private monopolies Gona monopoly
"Jaguar is a very niche car company. EV aside, how many people have Jags? Very few. I don't really see a Tesla Killer until BMW or Mercedes comes out with a $45K EV. The Taycan should be interesting, and I'd definitely get that over a Model S. But Porsche is also a niche car company. Not as niche as Jaguar, but definitely still not mainstream."
"Lmao why is everyone demonizing Tesla? It’s such an overused trope. There are plenty of electric hypercars faster than Tesla’s current models, like the Neo EP9."
"Agree that more EV’s are not a problem.  It will only help.  

That said, CNBC and Bloomberg among others have featured prominent money managers who are short Tesla and believe the company has no future value.  It’s fine, they were doing their job which is to cover markets and provide various perspectives.  I’m just glad to see them also featuring the difficulties Tesla has already overcome to get this far in the game and the difficulties now facing other companies looking to break into the EV space."
"Ya, good point. There's no need to ""kill"" Tesla. There will be many great electric cars in the future, but Tesla still has quite the head start. I guess the other manufacturers should've taken note back when the model S was released instead of waiting until now..."
"A big reason is the only hope a legacy OEM has to ""kill Tesla"" at this point is to accept that they'll also kill their ICE sales as a casualty of war. That gas-powered legacy hangs around their necks like an albatross."
Correct answer ! If Ford makes a $ 15k EV and pushes Tesla out of the market then Tesla won
"The problem is... Tesla is fucking expensive. 

We who can buy a Tesla, opt to buy a Tesla because it's an arguably better car. More power. Self driving. Longer range.

Other electric cars, are bought by those who _can't_ afford a Tesla, or those who _don't_ want a Tesla.

They can't kill Tesla, without making a Tesla cheaper than Tesla are making them.

Those of us who bought a Tesla, wouldn't rather buy a Golf with the same range, if it lacks the self driving. 

So far, other electric cars are in the cheaper range. And they are great. But it's not Tesla buyers who buy those, it's the general population. (Except Norway ofc, where Tesla is bought by the general population)."
"More EVs equals more charging stations. 

This is a great thing"
Soon every car will be ev. Nobody needs to kill Tesla to gain market share in the EV field.
"Audi had to market themselves as ""Tesla killers"" because ""Q5 killer"" would cut into their sales.

BMW made the i3 weird because they didn't want it to cut into 3 series sales.

What these brands don't realize is that if they don't self cannibalize and cut into their ICE sales, someone else (Tesla) will.

It's strange to watch these brands try to sell electric cars without wanting to admit that they are better than ICE. It's such an awkward position they're in. All they can do is talk about Tesla."
What people have to understand is that it's the media's job to stir the shit pot. That's how they keep the clicks coming. Anyone with half a brain knows Tesla is way ahead of the competition.
Do charging stations use proprietary plugs?
"> more ev cars are not a problem

This is an attitude that I think this sub could use a little more of. We can't just completely write off newer EVs just because they're not actually as good as a Tesla and/or lauded as a Tesla killer. Even Audi, with their shitty marketing tactics, are at least *trying*."
Exactly. I’m stoked to see what rivian can do.
"Agreed, I personally plan on getting a Bolt, and have literally zero intention or desire of killing Tesla. Of course my plans can change anyway, it's all about the price point for me, and I'm not buying a new car for a couple years atleast."
"> more ev cars are not a problem

It's validation.  Nobody is out to ""kill"" Delorean or Tucker.  People follow the leader, and more followers don't make the leader irrelevant.  If someone else takes the lead, that means the game is more legitimate and it's even more validation.  VW will pass Tesla eventually, but that doesn't mean Chevy is a VW killer if they're right behind them too."
[deleted]
" Yes. We just bought my wife a used Chevy Volt. Driving electric alone isn't exciting at all because that is all the Volt has going for it. I miss Autopilot, maps, and streaming audio from my Tesla."
Second reply here from me. I totally agree that building an ev is the easy part. Everyone has hybrids and the difference isn't really that big...just more batteries mostly. They can't even do that well or efficiently.
"Yeah, I've never owned an iPhone but I'm all-in on Tesla right now.  IMO Tesla as MUCH further ahead on the car front than Apple ever was on the phone front, and Apple still retains much of their earlier advantage.  I think it will be a while before anybody else catches up with Tesla.

Eventually you'll be able to get a L5 self-driving compact car for $20k with good range/etc (either ICE or EV), but that is way out in the future, and until then Tesla is probably going to be cleaning up."
"By the time EV tech is commoditized and ICE-age manufacturers have caught up, we will be well into the age of self-driving and transportation-as-a-service, which changes the game again, and even more drastically than the shift to EVs.

This is going to be a one-two punch which will completely devastate the car industry (and the oil industry). We're taking global power shifts. Pursian Gulf states imploding. One hell of a mess."
"> The fact that they are EVs is the least of the factors that differentiates Teslas from other cars

I would be super duper surprised if this were true, if Tesla buyers by and large would have bought the same vehicle if it wasn't an EV.

I truly disliked owning and driving a car before and was totally disinterested in car tech. I would never have consider buying an expensive car if it wasn't electric, and was willing to pay for a Tesla to be an early adopter and supporter of the transition to electric.

Not everyone is like me, but would Tesla be doing well in Norway if it wasn't an EV?"
"Yeah but Tesla is not sleeping and they are on top of the game with self driving cars ehile other brands did not really even started and hoping for google to give them developed system. 
Nevertheless once we approach physical laws of efficiency you cannot go beyond that pount so cars will naturaly eventually end up being the same."
I’m willing to bet that the Android of EVs will be Chinese.
"Yeah why would you offer that incentive to Tesla owners when it should go to non-EV, luxury car owners. They’re targeting the wrong audience. 

Of course the cynic in me says it’s because they’re happy to argue why their EV is better than a Tesla and deathly afraid of making the more honest and compelling pitch—why their EV is better than their *own* ICE cars (from which they make all their money)."
"> Boomers hold off because they see Tesla as an upstart without the infrastructure to repair vehicles.

That is, assuming the Boomers in question even know about Tesla. I took people on rides in my Model 3 at a wedding in AZ a few months ago, including a bunch of boomers, and NONE of the boomers had ever heard of Tesla. The most common question I got from them was ""Who _makes_ this car? Ford? Chevy?""

When I explained that Tesla was a new American company making exclusively electric cars, half of them refused to believe me, and the other half were shocked because they had no idea."
"Also it turns off non Tesla owners looking at Audi.   ""You have enough slack in your budget to give them $3000 off, why not me??  Also maybe I should look at Tesla...."""
"My Mom is this exact person. Boomer, previous Lincoln and Cadillac owner. Current Audi owner. 

She fawns over my Tesla every time she comes over. She tells me she will buy it off me if I want to sell it. She loves the speed and the glitz of the Tesla. 

When I first bought it, she said I was crazy. After she rode in it and I told her it doesn't need oil changes or any scheduled maintenance, that was enough. It clicked instantly for her. If my mom gets it that fast, its game over for the legacy brands. That's my anecdotal story."
I’m a Boomer. Make me suffer. Buy me a Tesla.
jaguar is the one poaching
"It is usually easier to poach a converted consumer (people who are believers in EV’s) than it is to market to and educate people who haven’t flipped the switch in their mind to be okay buying an EV. This works for every other industry whether McDonalds/BK or Coke/Pepsi, but will never work with Tesla. Unfortunately for them, the typical ways of stealing sales just won’t work for a company like Tesla."
"I think it’s largely symbolic and designed to capture more headlines than actual buyers. I’d like to give them the benefit of the doubt and believe that they realize their biggest market share will come at the expos ICE vehicles, not Teslas."
No need for edit. Audi is being just as irrational parking the Etron at superchargers.
"In my experience most boomers don’t even know Tesla is an American company or that the car is all electric. If they have heard about Tesla at all the only thing they know is that it’s fast, it’s ungodly expensive, and Elon Musk is insane.

Most of us here in this sub have opinions based on our microcosm of life and our interactions with those people curious enough to approach others and engage in a conversation about the car. To me these people are not representative of the general population at all. 

I’m not sure when the time will be right but Tesla really could do more to educate the mass market."
"My uncle is almost 80 and he’s the one who rented us a model 3 for a road trip. Specifically because he was super excited and was hoping I’d buy one. Which I did. He doesn’t even have one yet, he’s just that big of a fan of the tech and the mission. My uncle is one cool dude. He was also a computer engineer so that’s probably where he got the interest from"
"To be fair, not being able to adjust AC or change music using tactile controls while still looking at the road is one thing I dislike about modern cars, and I’m 18 lol. This is the reason (along with long battery life and an always on display) I am still wearing a pebble time steel in 2019. Personally, an ideal setup would let you adjust AC/change music using tactile buttons but everything else would be on a large touchscreen like maps/etc and current song info/climate control would show up on said touch screen."
"> I still don't understand Audi. Stop trying to poach Tesla with the $3000 incentive.

From the article:

>> **Jaguar** has decided to attack Tesla head-on. The brand is offering Tesla owners a $3,000 discount on the I-Pace for the next month and a half.

Have I missed something?"
I think this is where Tesla has the market cornered a bit. People who want an EV typically want a Tesla. Boomers do love their legacy brands but their also the type to not take risks with new tech so it will take quite a bit for them to jump to EV.

"Hey now, Zunes were pretty awesome. RIP"
Dammit I miss my Zune HD.
Burn
And no over the air updates
And you know how shitty that lane keep and tacc will look compared to OTA updated Autopilot today not to say in 1 or 2 years..
"That’s ridiculous. Tesla basically charges $2500 for autopilot and I’m sure it’s miles better, still improving, safer, and a fourth of the cost."
Safety is an option? mmmh...
And those technologies likely kind of suck and will never get updated because the dealership networks want their grubby hands all over any after-the-sale support for a non-Tesla.  Want a navigation update?  $300.
"> They are laser-focused on competing with Tesla when they should compete against ICE vehicles
> 

This right here is the biggest problem. Manufacturers won't show potential customers how one car is better than another in their own brand, only how they stack up to other brands. That's going to continue to choke EV adoption in legacy automakers for a while yet."
"Add to this 

6. They cant get the batteries

7. They dont have the manufacturing lines available to make the BEV's (well VAG now do, but see 6.)

8. French and German car makers specifically have all recently invested heavily in ""clean"" Petrol/diesel engine tech to meet Euro 6 regulations, and NEED to get a return on that investment. SO they are stuck with having to make that investment pay back while the market moves much quicker than they expected towards ZEV."
"I thought Tesla opened up their patents. so they could use Tesla's supercharging network? There may be a fee involved, but it's a network that is already in place. 

[https://www.iflscience.com/technology/tesla-release-electric-car-patents-public/](https://www.iflscience.com/technology/tesla-release-electric-car-patents-public/)"
6. They don't have a massive staff of electrical and software and firmware engineers. So therefore they must outsource that work which results in second-rate products.
"To be fair, GM makes two of the most successful non-Tesla electric cars and a lot of other major brands are starting to offer electric or PIH options for their cars. Hell, Toyota made HSD cars before Tesla even entered the market."
"Yup, and they're struggling with the S/X despite the fact that those cars are starting to look a bit dated.  I had an S as a loaner and I definitely preferred my 3.  Granted, it wasn't the nicest S and it was a few years old, but still.  For such a huge step up in price it should just be better than the 3 in every way.  After Tesla refreshes those lines I can't see anybody competing with them.

Everybody who has ridden in my model 3 has commented that it is by far one of the nicest cars they've ever ridden in.  Granted, most of my friends aren't driving around in $100k cars, but plenty of them have been in Audis/BMWs/etc.  The minimalist design also really impresses people - it is just unlike anything else out there."
">  Consequently the (what, 10%?) profit accruing to car dealers - often those are the richest guys in some small towns - instead accrue to Tesla, bolstering profits and giving them a bigger price competition option. 

These days car dealers sell cars at a near loss, they make all their profit on service and added ""extras"" like service plans and warranties."
"And the network is only getting better, too. It’s insane. I love Tesla. They just keep getting better. 

It doesn’t matter if other dealers aren’t making electric cars. I seriously think Tesla will be the #1 car manufacturer in the future. Other companies can’t catch up and Tesla is only getting better. Those other manufacturers aren’t even capable of innovating fast enough to catch up."
"Agree completely—SuperChargers are the widest part of the Tesla moat at the moment.  It is the main feature that gave my wife and I confidence / comfort in making the jump to Tesla.  Our range anxiety was probably like everyone else’s originally and it immediately faded once we realized how accessible fast charging was for our general needs. 

The cool thing is that while SuperChargers are a big initial differentiation for Tesla, the company continues to work on new differentiators (like autonomy) that will give it an even wider moat in the future."
"Yet somehow, so many companies that think they can ""compete"" with Tesla seem completely oblivious to the competitive advantage of the Supercharger network."
Could VW/BMW/MB etc buy into using Tesla Superchargers?  That's what would help EV sales on vehicles other than Tesla. Marketing campaign: Cheap EV VW Jetta with the ability to charge at a Tesla Supercharger.
I'll go against the grain and say no. The better option is to have an universal standard that anyone can get into. I think currently what the EU obligated tesla to do with the model 3 is the best of both worlds. That is the tesla supercharger network and whatever private network available where tesla isn't.
"The US government could create a huge supercharger network, but the conservatives in charge would never allow it."
"You charge at EA chargers which are actually going up rather fast.  Most locations have 2 CCS chargers that can do 150kW, so comparable to what a v2 Supercharger can do."
"Tesla lets other manufacturers use the Supercharger network, and you can get a supercharger adapter for a few hundred dollars for cars without official support.

Also, superchargers are only useful on road trips- if you can charge your car with a level 2 charger at home, you probably don’t need one unless you have a particularly long commute."
But we have Porsche dealers every 50 miles! /s
"I like your list but would add over-the-air-updates in there, for me spot #2.

It's a game changer in my mind"
"Ya, when you offer $3k and no one takes your deal ..."
Ehh not even try is a stretch. Ultimately for car manufactures it’s about making cars that will sell. That’s like suggesting they might as well close shop.
"They will have to try.  Can you even buy a phone with no camera or touch screen anymore....  my biggest concern is that tax payers will have to bail out GM,Ford and Chrysler because they suck so bad.  I hope VW dominates like Tesla and buys all the old closed plants to build batteries.  
Im even starting to worry about Toyota and Honda not pulling their weight.  Though I think that the new Honda Electric will do well for them."
"> if everyone who tries looks at is as ""beat Tesla or why bother?""  

Why bother?  Ask BMW how their 3 series is selling right now.    Ask Audi how the A3 is selling right now.   The reason to bother is because if they don't beat Tesla they are going to lose the car market.  And there is no reason for them to think the crossover market isn't next with the Model Y.

They aren't going to transform their business and invest billions of dollars unless they ***have to*** the only way they'll feel they have to revolutionize their product line is if Tesla is ""too successful""."
I think in 10 years all hyper cars will be electric. It doesn’t make sense to continue with gas seeing the performance benefits being brought to the table. Then from there it will be a trickle down effect.
"> ""beat Tesla or why bother?""

Because then those companies will go bankrupt sooner or later."
I always thought Tesla would transition to become the battery and technology supplier to the major car companies. Seems like a huge play for them long term.
"The car industry is so large,  you will always get companies trying to complete.  There is too much money to ignore. If they can't hack it,  they can use tesla ip to get a start"
One of the biggest issues Tesla has is price- the cheapest Tesla is still like 35k and you can’t even get a significant discount buying it used like you can for other electric cars because it’s a tesla.
"Everytime I see an i3, I am curious as to how they think they look like."
I see plenty of bolts on the streets these days
"What's wrong with Leaf, Bolt and i3? They are perfectly good EVs. 

Not everyone cares about performance, 0-60, RWD, etc. They care about gas mileage/range, and reliability."
Yup.  Only the press.
"It would be hilarious if someone makes an EV that starts selling as well as the Model 3, and Elon just snaps his fingers and offers a free software update that unlocks 50 more miles of range and the cars go 0-60 half a second faster."
"*literally fucking everyone*: duh

Car companies don’t make Tesla killers, they make electric cars to compete with traditional gas cars. The closest thing to a Tesla killer I’ve seen is the i3, and that doesn’t even fit 4 people in it fully unless you move the front 2 seats to their forward most position and has crap range. It’s also aimed at a completely different demographic than Teslas are. 

Car companies are established businesses with existing customers, they don’t need to steal Tesla’s market to sell cars, and they can’t anyways because of how far ahead Tesla is on R&D."
"Simple:  
They don’t want to lose sales on much more profitable ICE cars. Current EVs that are labeled as “Tesla killers” are just like Hybrids an attempt for the carmaker to stay within CO2 Emission regulations (like in the EU) and delay the electric revolution by as much time as possible. In the 90s we were  at the exact same spot as we are today, except that there was no startup like Tesla that forced Automakers to react. It was the automakers themselves that made EVs and later called them back to destroy them all, perfectly new cars btw. They noticed that they would lose tons of money if people weren’t addicted to dealerships, gas stations and workshops. 

I highly recommend you to watch “Who killed the electric car?”, it’s available on Amazon Prime and even Netflix if I recall. If you’rein Germany you have to watch it on Vimeo on 240p though as it’s region locked. Still worth it."
"That's exactly what Jaguar did. They released their interpretation of a CUV, a market segment that Tesla plans to eventually tackle with the Model Y. Right now, Teslas closest equivalent is the enormous Model X, which, being a massive vehicle, is of course much more expensive."
Build a sub $20k EV that can access the Tesla Supercharger network and I'm fairly sure it'll sell. Maybe a range of 200-300.
Great point - they really should launch EVs in markets Tesla isn’t in - 4x4s would be the segment I’d go for. Rivian has the best shot imo
"I was part of the mobile revolution at my employer, where management centrally decided that our desktop app, that represented 90 % of our user base at the time, would have to be put on hold in order to focus all our efforts on our mobile apps, the fad of the day.

This caused a lot of anger among our users, since bugs didn't get fixed in a timely manner and some features were even dropped over the course of several years on the dominant platform. It also caused immense frustration among our developers who wanted nothing more than to fix low hanging bugs to make our users happy.

But it was the right decision. Desktop is a tiny sliver of the user base today, both on our platform and on the world in general. My employers management team saw the writing on the wall and made a lot of painful choices that cost us in the short game in order to win the long game.

What I'm saying is that a sufficiently skilled management team can counter all of the problems you mention and guide a company through industry upheavals."
Really good analysis!  I agree--the best way to approach it is with an entirely dedicated company whose culture is fully supported to the vision of creating an entirely new platform devoid of legacy thinking and strategies.  Traditional ICE vehicle manufacturers may be better served by setting up a new standalone entity or just investing in some hot start-ups.  Tesla did it right by approaching it from the ground up.
"He should have done at least 5 minutes of online research, thats really all it would have taken"
More money than sense.
"Yeah, all the comparisons were between those two new cars and the S/X.  I'm pretty sure the S/X are considerably more expensive, and when you see the sales on those drop in the last year I suspect it was more due to the 3 than the introduction of these two competitors.

I'm sure the model 3 figures blow these cars completely out of the water.  The $35k model 3 out-ranges both of them, and you can get a 310-mile 3 for considerably less than either as well.  I can't say I've compared all the other options, but the model 3 is hardly a bare-bones car.  Really the only obvious thing missing that I can see is the sunroof, but the glass roof has to count for something."
I thought exactly the same after watching that interview. Once Tesla fix the body they will have no real weaknesses. Batteries are the hard part and they have seemingly mastered them.
"It is a weaker example, true, but on the other hand, other phone manufacturers could have built an app store (as Google did eventually), but by then Apple was the top brand. Google phones sell more, but Apple makes all the industry profit in handsets. 

So the analogy would be that eventually other manufacturers develop a popular line of EVs and a charging infrastructure is built (by someone). But by then maybe Tesla will command the brand and profit lead."
Love it!  One more reason Tesla will continue to dominate.
Yup. Really poor journalism to not make that point.
Thanks!  Good catch!
"That actually depends on the regional variant of English.  It's standard to use the subjunctive in that situation (even in informal speech) in American English but not so much in British English.

(I am a non-native speaker and I very much prefer the subjunctive but it often comes across as too formal with British English speakers.)"
"Probably about as far ahead today of Volkswagen as Netflix was ahead of Disney 5 and 10 years ago when it came to a video streaming platform.

When big companies get their act together the results aren't usually good for the little guys."
"OR they simply are not aware of Tesla, its possible..."
"Aren't third-party networks (Ionity, for example) just about good enough these days?"
"I think the reason the phrase is used is because the mainstream media still considers Tesla to be a relatively nascent company whose longer term success is fragile and heavily dependent on getting current projects right.  While Tesla is quickly shoring up their fragility and launching to another level with the Model 3 and Y and the new solar leasing program, they are still heavily invested in a manner that requires excellent execution, so they are more vulnerable in the short run than other auto manufacturers.  

The other reason (and perhaps better one) the phrase is used is because many consider Tesla to be a fad that can be easily conquered by new innovation (since Tesla vehicles themselves were new innovations).  The media almost inherently discounts the revolutionary nature of the innovation and sells it short in suggesting it is more vulnerable to a new fangled, innovative idea to follow in short order.  The iPhone and iPad were recent examples of other innovations that the media thought was quite vulnerable, but their staying power at the top suggests intuitive design, excellent end-to-end user experience, and forward-thinking companies can continue to fend off rivals."
"There’s a YouTube channel that touches on this briefly. Rich Rebuilds I believe. Something to the effect that when these cars go out of warranty, expect a lot of attitudes to change.
 
These parts are not cheap, and can only be bought from Tesla and installed by Tesla.  Imagine waiting weeks, without a loaner, and paying."
">The main thing holding other companies back is charging infrastructure.  Tesla's is just so robust, and you cannot charge at a Tesla Supercharger  with a non-Tesla. As a consumer, I am actually a little bothered by  that honestly. My fear is that this practice could lead other EV makers  to create their own proprietary charging infrastructure.

I'm actually not so worried about this. Other EV makers simply disregard the relevance of the ""along the friggin highway"" charging infrastructure, and expect someone else (ChargePoint, EVgo, etc) to take care of it for them. Unfortunately, this doesn't really solve the chicken-and-egg problem. When/if those independent companies actually do start taking highway-route fast charging seriously, they'll do it in a way that's more brand agnostic.

&#x200B;

I'm really wondering when CCS is going to become available on a Tesla, and in widespread use (because the CHAdeMO franken-plug is too big to practically put on anything)."
Just macroeconomics trends. People buy more cars laying into the winter and end of the year then the firsr half.
Not one EV that has come out besides Tesla looks good. Unless you want a BMW I8 and that’s only 160k
That advert was awesome. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
They can. They just have to pay Tesla for it. So far no other automaker has decided to do so.
They have he option but so far none of them have taken Tesla up on it.
"That’s somewhat on other manufacturers to make that happen, Tesla was kinda there first, it’s not like there was a CCS plug already, and clearly no one has been willing to buy into Teslas superchargers (except Bollinger I think, and you can’t buy their trucks yet)"
"All EVs CAN USE IT.  No manufacturers have chosen to PAY Tesla to leverage their chargers.  Tesla has said many times they would allow this.  All other charging companies are separate entities and only offer charging or similar offerings, not a car arm as a part of the same model.

Tesla HAD to do this because there was  nothing even close to DCFC like Tesla built until the last year when ther became a true rollout of DCFC that offered more than 50kW."
"Tesla paid for it and built it from the ground up. Everyone who has bought a Tesla has paid for that network. Why should someone buying an Audi get something for free that I paid for when I bought a Tesla?

Audi has chosen to make some relationship with electrify America instead."
"Lol, gas and diesel have different size nozzles."
"Except some engines take different grades of gas. Then gas verse diesel, etc."
Fuck that. Superchargers are already overcrowded. Let these giant legacy companies invest their own money into a SC network like Tesla did.
No thank you.
"Nah.

When did Tesla become charity? 

I paid a premium for a Tesla to be able to use that network, and as the other manufacturers / fans of other brands go on and on that ""Tesla isn't making a profit"" they're investing tons of money into perks like this. Why should they be able to benefit from it at the expense of current Tesla owners in the form of more traffic and slower cars holding up the chargers? If Nissan, Audi, Ford, VW, Fiat,  etc. want to have the shared network, they should each install a proportional amount of EV chargers across the world, upgrade their cars to charge as fast as a Tesla, and only THEN should they be allowed to combine and share the network. Of course that won't happen because they're still too busy making gas powered SUVs and trucks for a profit. They can pay to build these networks. They can afford it."
"Because Tesla the company, and Tesla the technology are in 2 very different positions.  No one is still short on TSLA because they think Audi makes a better product.  They are short because they don't like the financial position of the company."
"You had 'various' in your description. They weren't, it was a skewed hammering all along. No alternative perspective."
And don’t forget the belly laughs we have as these shitty short sellers are losing a shed load of money! I laugh all the way to the solar arrays!! Bwahahahaha!
"I love my Tesla and think its a great/best company, but would consider shorting its stock. Why? Because its valued at 41 b$, plus 11b$ in debt, for 53 b$ in enterprise value.  And untold amounts in obligations to vendors, employees, customers. If it falls short of delivering in that trajectory its stock price should go down.

I wouldn’t call a 20 b$ company a failure. (That comparable to UAL and much bigger than many “super” successfully companies.). Essential market is saying Tesla may be hugely successful, just very success, or perhaps small risk of bankruptcy. Based on what I see, I’d expect it in be in very successful camp for foreseeable future."
"7 years head start, at least, the clock stops when someone releases a car better than the first Model S (no autopilot).

It is not a low bar to achieve, so the lead continues to grow.

The difference with ICE and EV marketing is Tesla has defined the metrics to be physical properties, range and acceleration, ICE marketing is just word salad in comparison."
"Or paid attention back when Elon posted his master plan all those years ago.

I think the only people who *actually* paid attention were Chevy."
"That's like watching a vicious lamb kill and eat an entire lion who was on steroids. 

Tesla is replacing the entire auto industry."
Tesla openly supports other car companies using the supercharger network lol
If they could gather up all the EVs and crush them like they did with the EV1 they would happily do it.
I believe that at this point all the legacy car makers are realizing that the age of ICE is coming to an end. and the sooner that they hop on the EV 'train' the better they;ll be able to survive
I see you have kept Tesla's mission statement in your heart.....
"At present Tesla is beating other car makers on battery costs, very hard for a competitor to make a comparable car for a lower cost.  That might change but nothing suggests that change is coming."
"Not convinced. Starve Tesla out of existence and then go back to the ICE profit center after weathering the EV storm for a few years. 

Tesla's mission statement only goes as far as you can trust the other companies to actually sustain."
"LOL no one is making a $15K EV anytime soon, unless it has like 80 miles of range at most."
And they can make a car better than Tesla but it has to also be as good looking as a Tesla. Big thing for Tesla imo is the looks. Most other EVs look like utter shit.
"> Those of us who bought a Tesla, wouldn't rather buy a Golf with the same range

That's definitely closer to what we really wanted-- there just isn't a nice little hatchback EV with Tesla-sized range and fast charging network available at any price right now.  So we've got a 3 because it's the only practical choice and we can live with it, not because it's ""exactly the car we wanted."""
">wouldn't rather buy a Golf with the same range, if it lacks the self driving.

I always say I didn't buy an electric car with autonomy I bought an autonomous car that happens to be electric.  

If Volvo had been offering cutting edge autonomy features and aspired to go at least Level 3 some day I would have bought a Volvo."
"This is true. I bought a 2012 Chevy Volt Gen 1 5 years ago. Leather heated seats, OnStar, Bluetooth, Bose speakers.... everything is top of the line with 36k miles for $16,999. The electric range gets me to work, I charge at work, and drive back home on electric. It's awesome. I couldn't afford a Tesla 5 years ago, and frankly I still can't but I will buy one one day."
"If Tesla doesn't deed have an advantage in battery technology then they will be the 1st to a $100 per kilowatt hour.A $100 per kilowatt very well may mean A20K electric car with 300 miles range.

Yeah you can buy a $20k electric car right now but it's got a little tiny battery."
"You hit the nail on the head here, they are just too expensive even for the ""affordable"" Model 3. If they could shave 10k off the car for SR+ I'd really consider one, hell I'd be fine if that meant gutting all the AP hardware.

 The battery quality and charging network alone is what makes it miles ahead of the competition and why I'm hesitant to get either a Leaf or Bolt."
"Name me another new EV as Capable as Model 3 that costs less. No plug ins, but full electric."
"> (Except Norway ofc, where Tesla is bought by the general population).

Kind of crazy how the E-Tron is outselling the Model S and Model X combined by 3,127 to 2,320 in Norway this year, despite the fact E-Tron sales only started in March.  Its also a little weird how S/X sales are down well over 40% so far this year there.  But we were talking about how other cars can't kill Tesla, right?  Sorry to get off topic."
Hopefully they are all compatible.
"Yeah, obviously the existing infrastructure will stick around for a while, but you have to wonder how far things have to go before it becomes harder to find gas stations for conventional cars.  

Granted, due to clean-up costs I wouldn't be surprised if many of those stations still run even at a loss, at least when owned by big chains.  The smaller ones might get abandoned.

It is a bit like leaded gas.  At some point it just becomes impossible to buy because the infrastructure to distribute it becomes way too expensive for the number of customers."
"You're assuming steady demand. The longevity and autonomy of Teslas will crush the automotive industry in volume of new car sales. Tesla battery costs will also make it very hard for other manufacturers to create competitive models. They will make ones that are cheaper and not autonomous likely, but they will have bad range as a result. Depending on the growth rate of Teslas production capacity, they could quickly transition from half a percent to a much larger share of the auto market because of their ability to displace many more ICE vehicles in consumer demand."
"agreed on you views of the media.

regarding tesla and it's advanced position in the auto marketplace, the auto industry is about one manufacturer coming out with ""the latest/greatest innovation"" and the rest of them copying that great leap forward. however in the case of EVs all the manufacturers resisted the adaptation of Elon's EV technologies and are now awakening to the reality that they are either going to adapt to the new world of autos or fall behind.  
I predict that once the legacy manufacturers catch up,. in maybe 5 years, we will see great advances in things like battery life, range improvements that will make the model S seem like an ancient relic."
"tesla superchargers do use a plug that only a tesla can use, elon has invited all the other car makers to use the system but none have taken him up on the offer.  
 the J1772 (L2 units) use a commonly found plug and the CCS format is common in europe and coming to some cars in the US."
"What you and many don't understand is Tesla already has competitors. Every single ICE car is a competitor, and Tesla for the most part is better. The thing is the more EVs sold by everyone the more people realize what EVs can do and then they realize yah Tesla does it generally better.

So one would think more competing EVs mean lower market share for Tesla but what's really happening is Tesla's market share is about the same but the pie is getting bigger.  That won't last as legacy ice starts to actually put out cars that compete in a few years but Tesla will have eaten a lot of that pie by then.

I honestly think by the time ice gets up to date with EV it will no longer be the EV revolution but already moved onto the autonomous revolution, where again Tesla holds a command in lead over ICE that will be reliying on 3rd party vendors and lidar and Tesla will likely have a better and cheaper solution."
"Last estimate I saw was that the profit margin on a model 3 was near 30%.  their problem is expanding quickly, it's not failing to manufacture at a profit."
"And Tesla is OK with that. Look at Tesla's mission statement. It has nothing to do with selling cars, only ushering in renewable energy advancements. 

If Tesla lit a spark in the world that brought about a situation where Tesla was put out of business because so many companies cloned it's tech and made it cheaper, it would have accomplished its mission"
"Tesla is more or less at the edge of profitability. They're putting as much as they possibly can into R&D. If Tesla actually had financial trouble, all they have to do to become profitable is to decrease R&D money a bit. But being profitable isn't important, making their technology better is. So as long as they don't have a reason to turn a profit, they just continue pouring all the excess money into developing technology that will help them later on."
"I own a Volt and have never ridden in a Tesla (but I'm a window shopper). I love the way the Volt accelerates and I especially love that it accelerates *smoothly* without any clunky gear shifts like my previous automatic-transmission ICE car had.

Can you comment on how the acceleration on a Tesla feels compared to a Volt? Like, I know a big selling point of the Tesla is the *immediate* response the instant you touch the accelerator. I feel like the Volt has that too but maybe it's just because I have no frame of reference, having never driven a Tesla. Is the accelerator on a Tesla noticeably more responsive than the accelerator on the Volt?"
"They're just not willing to go all-in the way Tesla has.  Of course Tesla has had no choice.

The other EV manufacturers are just unbolting the ICEs from their existing cars and bolting an electric motor into the same place, and then fitting some batteries wherever they can.  They're probably buying motors from companies that make motors (not really intended for cars), and batteries from battery companies, and generally integrating a ton of off-the-shelf components.

From their standpoint it makes sense - it is a low risk way to get their toes in the water.  The problem is that it results in a vastly inferior product.

Imagine if somebody bought a random 5"" touchscreen monitor, a motherboard, a small power supply, some batteries, and some random general-purpose electronics, stuck it all in a box, and called it a smartphone?  The thing would be the size of a shoe box.  As a prototype it might make complete sense but nobody is going to buy one if it is up against the iPhone.

And this is to say nothing of the deeper integrations Tesla is doing, like the superbottle and so on in the Model 3.  The fact is that the other companies are barely doing any serious R&D at all into EVs - they're largely just using off-the-shelf technology and being really picky about where they try to improve things.  Tesla has basically built just about everything in their car from the ground up.  Heck, they make their own seats..."
"That's because hybrids are the worst of both worlds... All the problems of ICE, and all the weight of cheap/ crappy batteries, and low-end, inefficient electronics combine to give meh range and performance."
"Honestly this is the #1 reason I'm thinking of getting a Model 3, not it being an EV.

I keep my cars for 10+ years. I don't want to buy a new car, and then have to live with a non-self driving one for 8+ years when a bunch of auto-makers are offering full self driving cars. There's like a 0.1% chance that the legacy auto-makers would let me upgrade a several year old car to have full self driving, they'd rather sell me a new car instead. Tesla on the other hand would be glad to unlock the functionality for me if I paid the right price."
"I think that's a reasonable guess but it's hard to predict exactly how Chinese manufacture will fare in the future. Rising wealth and rising costs of living, a growing willingness to extend political and military force, etc. It could change the dynamics in the country and people's willingness to do business with the country. Interesting times, to be sure."
">Of course the cynic in me says it’s because they’re happy to argue why their EV is better than a Tesla and deathly afraid of making the more honest and compelling pitch—why their EV is better than their   
>

> ICE cars (from which they make all their money).

I think it's exactly this.  Marketing was told not to cannibalize their ICE sales."
"They want to steal Tesla owners to remove any base that Tesla has. They think if they can take the Tesla customers and keep their own Audi customers, they can slowly release EVs as they won’t have competition. Legacy automakers will take their time to kill the EV movement by either making EVs that are limited or just slowly grow that business. If they stomp on that pesky bug now (Tesla) they can relax for the next 10-20 years and take their time."
Conflict of interest. That’s why Chevy does not advertise the shit out of their 220 mile range bolt.
Would not be surprised if Jaguar has incentives in some areas if you switch from an ICE competitor.
"I don't think this is cynical. Based on all of the actions they have taken, this appears to be the logic governing their approach."
"> half of them refused to believe me

I don't even get this. They, coming from a position of complete ignorance of the existence of this car, assumed that you must not know anything about what you bought? What did they decide it was? Were you able to convince them?"
"And the other point - without transmission, clutch, fuel injectors, fuel pump, catalytic converter and muffler, oil filter and oil changes, piston rings, valves and timing belts, and without a big chunk of metal that heats up to combustion temperatures containing highly pressurized hot fluids  - the number of points of failure, the number of components needing regular maintenance and repair - is vastly less. 

How often do you service your blender or your refrigerator?"
"Now apply that line of thought to other things like politics and legacy business investing. This is the generation of CEOs and old money, and they legitimately don't know some of these disrupting technologies exist. Like the thing with GE: people's lifelong investments are about to go up in smoke and it will entirely blindside these guys."
If they haven't seen a commercial for it during the evening news it doesn't exist
I stopped trying to verbally win people over ages ago. I just offer to take them for a ride. Shuts down the argument immediately.
"such hubris usually foreshadows getting completely boned. Apple did that full page ad for the IBM PC back in the 80s and within a decade the PC architecture was completely dominant and Apple were nearly bankrupt.

Tesla is fortunate to be in a leading position on EV's so many statements that one could call hubris are more or less justified, but, as the saying goes, first pride, then the fall. Not that I want Tesla to fail."
the Zune HD was very nice :)
“It can hold 200 songs!”
[deleted]
Yep. Another case of the innovators dilemma.
"The problem is they themselves are the ones making the ICE cars, so of course they dont want see themselves as the enemy. But they are well aware of the potential for lower profit margin EV's to cut into their own higher profit margin ICE cars."
"Isn’t this what Elon initially said, car companies won’t ground up create an ev"
3.  Isn't that throwing good money after bad?
"It's a disingenuous offer. The giant caveat is that any company that uses a Tesla patent agrees to forfeit all of their own IP for Tesla to use. 

The patent libraries of every other manufacturer are wildly valuable and would be worth far more to an upstart manufacturer than the reverse. The offer is a complete nonstarter, made for PR reasons and not because it would ever be seriously considered.

The Supercharger network is functionally a proprietary network no one else can use. Manufacturers are likely to stick with actually open source standards moving forward, like the SAE system."
Nobody has taken them up on it.
"To counter that fairness, GM made the first real electric car (the EV-1) and the Volt and the Bolt as compliance cars and sold no more than they had to, possibly with the exception of the Volt (gas engine, hooray!).  The EV-1 was snatched back from its owners and literally crushed as soon as California loosened their requirements on zero emission vehicles and the Bolt sells just the bare minimum to meet California CARB requirements.

They're not trying.  They are complying."
And a lot of the maintenance and repair that ICE needs simply don't apply with a Tesla.
For that they'd need to get into the more affordable range of cars. Their cars are fucking great but they're quite a lot of money for the average car owner. Once they get into the 20-25k$ range with a model that's when we'll see Tesla's everywhere.
"> And the network is only getting better, too. It’s insane. I love Tesla. They just keep getting better. 

Other fast charger networks are growing faster tho.

Ionity for example is only 2 years old and has built 350kW chargers at ~133 locations in Europe. 50 more are currently under construction.

Tesla is at ~400 fast charger locations in Europe."
"> seem completely oblivious 

No they are not. Look who's behind other charger networks. Ionity is VW, Daimler, Ford, BMW. Electrify America is VW too.

Or who cooperates/invests with/in Charger Networks:

Automakers *are* investing and building infrastructure, including fast chargers. So are [big oil](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/news-and-insights/press-releases/bp-and-didi-join-forces-to-build-electric-vehicle-charging-network-in-china.html) and [electricity companies](https://www.sce.com/business/electric-cars/Public-Charging)."
"Tesla offered that other manufacturers can use them, if they ""pay their fair share"".

At the same time....all Tesla cars can use other fast charger networks (Electrify America, EVgo, Ionity, ...) without Tesla Inc. paying their ""fair share"" to the network operators.

Tesla SuperChargers also use non-standard proprietary plugs&protocols. While all others use the open standards CCS/CHAdeMO.

It just makes no sense at all for others to buy access to the SuperCharger Network. Especially since VW,BMW,Daimler,Ford,etc already run their own fast charger networks (Ionity is growing faster than SuperCharger network in the EU at least) or cooperate with other open standard networks."
"Tesla said yes, other manufacturers could but none have of course."
"You're not alone with that stance at all, if you look outside the echo chamber /r/teslamotors

> That is the tesla supercharger network and whatever private network available where tesla isn't.

It's the other way around. Tesla SuperChargers is the private network.

They are exclusive to one single car brand and use proprietary plugs&protocols. All others are open standard and can be used by any car brand. They are public, SuperChargers aren't.



IMHO, the EU didn't go far enough.

Having incompatible systems for the same damn purpose is a waste of money and resources. All charger networks should be as open gas stations. They should have mandated that charger networks must use CCS and be open to everyone. Or would you want car brand exclusive gas stations?


Another thing that still really sucks is payment methods. Every damn network uses their own App, you have to register here and there. Regulators should mandate to offer universal payment methods at the charger stations. Meaning direct payment via creditcard/debitcard. It's possible to do this at stupid vending machines. Without needing to register anywhere, without needing any app at all. Offer Apps/registration as alternative."
"> EA chargers

You assume I'm American (I am not). If I want to cross a border there is one plug 100km from me while there are 60 tesla chargers within that same 100km (4 locations, 60 plugs)!"
"Yeah, I was doing a trip and there were both superchargers and CCS at the rest stops I used.  The CCS chargers were completely unoccupied though.  (Granted, it wasn't a busy time even for the superchargers but they were getting some use.)"
"Last time I tried charging at the new EA chargers by me (North Bend, WA), every single one failed to charge my car. The EVgo chargers next to them also had broken RFID readers.

Superchargers are one of the things I am looking forward to the most."
"True, but I would put it #4. :)"
"Can you imagine, a board of directors so depressed at their failure that they just close up shop and go home."
"Toyota is still spending wayy to much time and money on the dead end that is Hydrogen fuel cells. It's not efficient, it's not environmentally positive and it's not going to happen but they still won't let it die."
The transition to electric is going to take decades. That's plenty of time for legacy automakers to adapt. The question is just how much of the electric pie do they want.
For the Life of me. I don't understand the Logic of those two. Nissan seems to get it. but Honda and Toyota have been resisting making a BEV harder then anyone
"VW, you hope the deislegate company dominates the one will to straight up like to your face, design hardward to trick testing machines and just straight say fuck you and fuck the environment?

The only reason they are even in the EV space is because they were forced to invest 2 billion into it as part of a settlement. Don't worry they also collided with BMW for price fixing and got introuboe for that as well.

That company culture is rotten."
Like one of those Fiats but without the range.
i3 is a perfect inner city commuter if you don't look at the pricetag. It was designed to be a city car and it handles it perfectly. However for this price they can fuck off. I'd rather buy Renault Twizy with billionaire doors.
"I see plenty of leaves on the street too, for that matter."
Which Chevy has killed off...
"I'm not saying there's anything wrong with them. We absolutely got a handle on compact quirky looking hatchback/suv thingies. 

Where's all-electric Volt? Where's electric 3 series, X3, suvs, sporty cars, trucks? This is what I mean by better. They need to make cars that people want to buy. Not the ugliest cheapest stuff they can manage to get out the door."
"They will do adequately as in-town commuters.  but then who needs a commuter vehicle if your main car also uses electricity, and almost as cheaply? 

But then guys who drive a Hummer as a small penis compensator,  won't be caught dead in a wimpy electric little clown car."
"Also: The Model 3 isn’t around for so long yet and a model S or X is not in reach for most people. If you wanted an EV before the Model 3 and not spend a fortune you had to go get an i3, leaf or Zoe. The Zoe and leaf are great cars IMO and I really think that Nissan and Renault will be viable in the future with the experience manufacturing these.  

The used market has great options for cheap Zoe’s. 
I.e. for my mom I’m thinking about a used Zoe to replace our current VW Polo once I get a Model Y. That’s still some time in the future but I really think we shouldn’t mock serious (and good) attempts at EVs. 

The i3 was good at the time, it’s just really dated now and super ugly."
"I drive a leaf as our company car, and while it feels cheap and a little clunky (it's a Nissan) it's a perfectly fine car. It even has heated front/rear seats AND a heated steering wheel. It's a 1st Gen model, so it only gets about 60 miles of range on a good day, but for in-town commutes, it's great and it costs practically nothing to run. 

A Tesla is a hell of a value when comparing new sale prices, but the used market... If I was still a truggling college student I'd be looking at used Leafs or i3s. My company picked up a few of them, each well under $10k with low miles and we run them for pennies.

So no, nothing wrong with Leafs, Bolts or i3s, but I think it's fair to judge their parent companies for not being able to produce more, better EV models by now. I.E. The aforementioned models are perfectly good EVs, *for the niche they fill*."
"1. no supercharger,  limited public charging infrastructure,  slow fast charging. 

2. battery longevity (leaf & i3) 

3. plastic interrior, buttons, style"
Elon isn't Thanos...
"I wouldn't be surprised if it was possible to unlock faster acceleration on the Model 3, but it would probably be detrimental to the batteries or motors."
"If I knew about a killer off-road EV I would cancel made my order right now. So many companies have the pieces in place to. GM has great off-road technology and also has a couple of EV/PIH platforms. No idea why they won’t put them together. Ford actually put out EV versions of the Ranger and the Escape over the years, but I don’t think they really put much effort into them. 

I’m honestly hoping I don’t damage my model S offroading with it. By off-roading I mean grass, dirt roads, and gravel roads. Shouldn’t be too much, nothing my Volkswagen couldn’t handle, but then again my Volkswagen isn’t a supercar with low clearance.

But again, they would have to do it the way Tesla did it. Not just create a vehicle that is electric and has nothing else special about it. It would have to be a vehicle that aside from being electric is compelling in and of itself. And Offroad EV could have superior performance to a gas car in various ways, such as if they independently controlled each wheel with a separate motor for maximum traction. They could also set it up to be better at fording than any other gas vehicle since it doesn’t need oxygen; they could make an EV truck that could drive in water up to the windshield."
"That’s a good story. And there’s probably more shared knowledge between the desktop and mobile environments than between ICE and BEV. 
It’s possible - just unlikely IMO as these legacy investments are big, expensive and very painful to walk away from."
"Great example, though the challenge for ICE is even pricklier because of the physical side of this issue (vs. software)."
"Yup. But in software it’s possible to transition quickly. In the hardware world of car manufacturing, it takes decades to shift and entire skill sets need to be learned from scratch. It will be too much for many companies I think."
He is a busy guy and just didn’t bother.  This year alone he bought a 7 series for $95k and S class for $120k.  I should’ve intervened sooner so I guess it was my fault.
Good point. Thanks.
"It’s a bit different from Tesla to Netflix. Netflix had a great idea, lots of user data and executed it well. All Disney has to do is, invest a ton of money and develop a similar service, done.  

A good electric car requires research and time investment. Money is important but it won’t buy innovations if you don’t have the right people working on them with enough time. VW needs major restructuring and time to get to where Tesla is."
"Well maybe one day Tesla will prove the media wrong. I saw them as a 100% viable and stable company two years ago when I started looking into ways to get a Model X. Admittedly, they have rough patches, and they run into manufacturing problems, but they're determined."
Except I'm starting to get these attitudes and I'm still under warranty. The service guys are extremely nice. But overworked. They are time constrained and get chewed out if they work slow. This in return means rushed work and small mistakes get covered up to get cars out. I'm lucky to be able to do some fixes myself. These cars are built to be assembled quickly. They come apart just as quickly. You just need to know where and how.
"I think the Ioniq looks pretty solid and some of the newer Kias do too. 

The bigger problem is like I said that no EV competes with the mainstream mass market eco cars like the Civic."
"You see it as something that’s cool and edgy because you are already committed to owning an EV. The ad is supposed to be increasing sales among Audi buyers, who aren’t as sanguine about owing a plug-in car. Preaching to the choir does nothing to increase sales."
"this is elon-propagenda, it's like if I pointed a gun at you and told you ""give me 6m$ or I shoot you"" - after pulling the trigger,  i frown and tell myself ""he had the option to live,  he just choose differently""."

That's deliberate though to ensure an incompatible fuel isn't used.   There is no incompatibility between high voltage DC and high voltage DC.
"That's to prevent someone from putting the wrong fuel in a car, and that's fine.

Electricity is electricity, the electricity that goes into a Tesla is the same that goes into a Leaf and Bolt. I think it's a shame that we're less than a decade into EVs being somewhat mainstream and already have multiple charging standards. 

Imagine if Shell, Mobil, BP, etc, all used different nozzles and you had to carry around adapters in your ICE car. It would be a massive pain in the ass."
"Also: LP, B100, B20, E85, Methanol, Race Gas, Jet Fuel, H35, H70, ..."
"I was going to say this, but he specifically said gas."
"Because gas and diesel are not interchangeable.  Electrons are electrons and there really ought to be one standard plug for hooking your car to it.

And before you start getting all ""voltages and amperage"" on me: Put a data line on it and negotiate between the car and charger.  If my phone and a $20 wall charger can do then we can figure out how to make a car and a charging station do it."
"In this case, the superchargers should be electrically compatible with any car. DC is DC and the superchargers can create any DC voltage from 0 to 400VDC (Theoretically even higher) and they current-limit themselves.

The proprietary aspect comes into play when the communication handshake happens between the car and charger and that's something Tesla has 100% control over."
"Maybe in California, but they're not in other places. I just went on a 3000 mile road trip down the east coast and never saw more than 1-2 other cars at any of the superchargers I stopped at. Never had to wait."
"But having caught up with the ""production hell"" - their cash issues relate to massive expansion, not failure to deliver.  Gigafactories are not cheap.  Also, software is an asset that is very cheap to reproduce once made functional, so the core operating system of the car is a cash cow going forward for each new vehicle, now that the basics are working.  No wonder they can afford free upgrades. 

The shorts are betting the market for Tesla is already close to saturated. So far, they seem to be very wrong."
"What's that saying about the first settlers getting the arrows in their backs, and the second getting the land? 

People are betting that Tesla takes the arrows, but often that saying is just a saying and the early bird gets the worm."
"They are short because they believe the company is overvalued. There is a bit of truth to that as our fanboyisn probably put the price higher than their analytics said it should be. But the analytics don’t consider the fanboyism, which is one reason why many of these same shorts were “right” about Apple and Netflix and lost money"
"They are short on Tesla because they can't afford Tesla to dominate the EV and future autonomous driving market. Think about it - they are 5 years ahead on battery tech and at least that as well on autonomous driving development. Even George Hotz, creator of Comma.ai concedes that Tesla will have Level 5 autonomy first, and that's because of the billions of autopilot miles worth of data they've been able to feed to their deep learning AI to teach the system how to drive at least as well if not better than a human. The closest rival has only a couple million miles worth of real world driving data. 

So want to help Tesla get there faster?  Drive as much as you safely can on AP."
"I disagree - they are short because they have a rabid hatred of progress and things they weren't already heavily invested in (ie, the oil and existing car industries).  TSLA is a disrupter, and only the forward-thinking investors stand to gain from its success."
The record amount of shorted stock on Tesla versus ANY other company having seemingly bad financials tells me another story.  I’m more inclined in believing big oil are investing a small part of their huge daily profits in shorting TSLA just to force the stock down constantly.  Slowing EV down is in their best interests.
Tesla’s revenues have doubled nearly every year for a decade. If that’s not a growth company I don’t know what is. Growing companies almost always have shit profits until they slow down their growth. It’s not cheap building the world’s biggest factory 4 times.
"I’ve driven the e-tron and the I-Pace. Depending on what one define as better I could definitely argue that they are better than the 2012 model S. Do they have longer range? No, so in that aspect they’re not better. 

Do they come with more comfort, better build quality, readily available service networks, more polished MMI, and better safety assists? Yes. 

However, I’m afraid, the buck stops there. Tesla didn’t stop developing the S in 2012, and while other manufacturers keep putting more things in cars it feels like Tesla’s approach is somewhat of a “less is more”. 

A Hyundai Kona and Ioniq comes standard with a few things you won’t find on new Tesla’s. Tesla is instead betting hard on their software and cameras to fill the gaps. 

I think it’s working. 

I ordered a model 3 even though it is noisier (by a big margin) and despite Tesla’s reputation for quality, service levels, and fit and finish. Of the EV’s I’ve driven it’s the only one that actually felt like the future. Like the first time you used an iPhone. And going back to my Audi felt like using an old Motorola (which ironically produced the wireless handset for the built in cell phone). And the e-tron and I-Pace is kinda in the HTC Diamond Touch area of this comparison."
And what if this someone is Tesla? The moat deepens.
"Read it for the first time. It states: 

""In addition to consumer vehicles, there are two other types of electric vehicle needed: heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport"". 

So Tesla will create a bus type vehicle aswell?"
It very well could be. I anticipate fall out in ice manufacturing by 2030.
"At this point with Tesla successfully putting it out there in the public consciousness that desirable, practical, affordable and high-performing EVs exist I'd laugh if some legacy OEM did that again. It'd be like the Judean People's Front crack suicide squad. [Croak] ""That showed 'em!"""
The war isn't won until ICE production is shut down and dismantled.
Some people think Teslas look like shit.
"It's not that much about looks. 

With the looks, comes price. With price, there must be more than looks."
"> there just isn't a nice little hatchback EV with Tesla-sized range and fast charging network available at any price right now.

Soon though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8cHHNPRg-c"
"I didn't want a small, Golf-sized hatchback but I did want essentially an EV Impreza Wagon. The 3 is basically that just not with a hatch. The Y looks to be about Outback-sized.

I think the wider point of you wanting something smaller and me wanting a hatch is we both got the 3 because there's just nothing else that fits the bill yet. It's further evidence of how freaking huge the potential is and how wrong people are thinking EVs are still ""niche."" A lot of people have decided against buying other cars they normally would have loved and gotten the 3 because it's so far ahead.

As others start finally delivering their first mass-market EVs to compete Tesla will already be coming out with their *second* mass-market vehicle in the model Y with the third (truck) just a year or two after. That gap remains with everybody a major step or two behind."
Volt gang!  Just got a 2017 with adaptive cruise for half the price of a Model 3.  One day I will have a Tesla.
Nothing you say here is weird. OFC model S and X sales are down. Model 3 has eaten up everything with over 11k sales.
"Exactly. Tesla could increase it's market share by 20x and still only be at 10% of it's competitors. There is room to grow for everyone. And the benefits of Tesla (supercharger network etc) will adjust to reflect. Tesla already allows other manufacturers to use tllheir parents etc, so no reason it can be universalized."
"Well he's also said that they have to pay their share, which is something that is fair at face value, but other car makers are likely worried about what that cost might be long term. If they agree to join the Tesla charge network, there will be no competing chargers, and in 10 years, Tesla could inflate prices and they would be in a very strong position.

I think it's more likely that they don't want to legitimize Tesla."
"Ah, interesting, thanks"
[deleted]
"Their automotive margin was 18.9% last quarter, I would expect model 3 margin to be slightly lower than that since x and s are high margin."
"Only if you completely ignore research and development costs related to producing the car, which no other manufacturer does in their financial reporting"
Tesla had R&D costs of $324 million last quarter from revenue of $6.35 billion.
"There is also the financing aspect.  If the model 3 is marginally profitable, and the issue is just with debt, then that opens the door to restructuring that debt.  It also means that bankers aren't going to want to try to collect on that debt because they get way more of their money back letting Tesla continue to operate than by trying to liquidate them.

Maybe their shareholders won't be getting any dividend payments for a long time, and maybe their stock price won't grow much, but the cars are going to be sold and serviced for the indefinite future."
"This.  Something similar was happening with SolarCity where all their profits were being pushed into new Sales, making the numbers look bad in the short term but good in the long term.  Unfortunately, the stock market doesn't tend to care much about long term prospects these days.

Fortunately, Elon is a smart guy and he knew that taking over SC and then killing sales would result in a big bump to his bottom line.  Then once the car division stabilized, start sales back up on solar and it's a win win."
"The Tesla is like a golf cart had sex with a space ship.

Don’t test drive one...  it will ruin all other cars for you."
"I have a long range Rear Wheel Drive Tesla Model 3; they don't make mine anymore...it's one of the slower ones and.....the Volt is absolutely no comparison....like zero. I love my Volt, but yeah, the Tesla's accelerator pedal response is instant, especially if you are already moving at 20-30mph. From a dead standstill, my car has ever so soft of a launch, but I'm talking like 0-5 mph has a slight ramp up in power. 

I've had my Tesla for over a year now and I generally drive like a grandpa, but every once in a while I'll jab the accelerator and it still shocks me how quick the car is. Like literally, in the car by myself and I'll gasp and giggle at how quick it is and like I said, mine is slower than every version other than the current SR+ base model. 

The All Wheel Drive Model 3 is even quicker and the performance version...."
"Wife owns a volt and we rented a Model S for a week for our wedding. The biggest difference we noticed is that the Tesla gets to highway speeds with much less effort and throttle input than our volt. The Volt is fun, and definitely peppy compared to other econo cars, but you still have to  get into the throttle and give it a little time to get to highway speed. The Tesla.... you pushed the throttle a little and then you were at 65 or 70 after doing a shoulder check to merge. Take all the things you, and we, like about the Volt acceleration and double to triple them is the best way I can describe it."
"My wife has a volt 2017, that was our first electric car. I then replaced my mustang boss 2013 with a model 3. The volt feels really sluggish and slow to accelerate compared to a m3. The m3 is orders of magnitude faster to accelerate. 

Its also faster than my mustang was at lower speed for acceleration. At 100km and over is where the boss had more oomph. I loved that car but as a daily driver it was a bit rough and my gas cost were 400$ CND a month. I saved 400$ a month in gas and a 100$ in toll (gov incentive program ) with the m3, so with my trade in, my m3 is basically 60$ a month extra than owning my mustang boss."
"I have not driven a Volt, but I have been driving a Chevy Spark EV for several years and I think there are probably similar in feel. Compared to the Spark EV any gas car is unresponsive and laggy. Most of the other replies here are about acceleration, but I'm talking about the perceptible delay between moving the accelerator pedal and something actually happening. It's just quicker in the Spark EV.

Now I have a Model 3 and it is the same difference all over again. It makes the Spark EV feel dull. It took me a bit of adjustment to drive the Model 3 smoothly because I had become habituated to the slower response of the Spark EV and would just stab the pedal about the right amount and the soft response would cover it up.  With a Model 3 you have to be gentle or it will slap the headrest into the back of your head. Now I'm spoiled even for the Spark EV, gas cars are just impossible."
"Just upgraded from a 2013 Volt to a Tesla Model 3 SR+. . . There is no comparison. . . The Volt has a nice quick 0-15 mph speed but the Model 3 is insane, like it will push you into your seat and just keep going like that till you let off.   The Volt I notice you have to really be patient when passing and getting upto highway speeds (big deal for me since I drive 80 miles in a highway everyday); the Tesla you can get to 80-90 before you realize how fast you are going.  The acceleration is just so much fun on a Tesla compared to the Volt; I find myself smiling so much when I’m getting in the highway and launching at traffic lights because it is really a fun experience every time."
Drive the model 3 performance and you will order one that day.
I don't buy this line of reasoning. They have been making hybrid transaxles for years and those are fully integrated motor/gearbox assemblies. They are more than capable of making a simpler EV drivetrain.
I think you're really exaggeration with the 0.01%. It's nowhere near that high.
"As if anyone's actually cross shopping an ICE and EV Jaguar. Their ICE cars would suffocate their EV offering, not the other way around."
Interesting point.  Nice strategy.  Too bad it's not going to work.
"> if they can take the Tesla customers and keep their own Audi customers, they can slowly release EVs

This is why I reject the ""Any EV sold is a good EV sold"" line of reasoning.   If manufacturers had their way, they would keep selling highly profitable ICE until they're absolutely forced to.   

Tesla has no choice. They're selling EVs.  So I want to only buy from an EV only company until the ICE company puts some real skin the game and can't drag their heels if Tesla went under.   I bought TSLA stock with the full expectation they would go bankrupt and I would never see that money again.  It's been successful in that every company is probably a few years ahead of where their accountants want them to be... for the sole reason of staying competitive with Tesla.  

The only other company going fully in right now is Polestar/Volvo.   I have complete faith Polestar has the right incentives to make EVs successful or die just like Tesla.   I'll believe VW when it happens seeing as they have been making promises for ages without following through.  I am optimistic but not committed yet."
"Trying to poach Tesla owners is a complete fool's errand, and it shows that they still don't really ""get it.""

Tesla has proven that there is a HUGE untapped market of people willing to buy electric vehicles when it is a compelling product.

**This is NOT a subsegment of autobuyers who want electric vehicles for environmental or other reasons.**

It's just people who want the same things in a car that anyone else wants. Speed, safety, the latest technology, cost of ownership, etc. Being green/not buying gas is just an added bonus. 

Audi seems to be targeting people thinking that they want electric vehicles for electric vehicle's sake. Which shows they really have no idea what they're doing. 

Mark my words, **it's going to be a disastrous strategy.**"
"Tesla still got $35,000+ from any owners who Jaguar get to switch, or at least they paid a bunch of money to lease the car, and they get the car back. That doesn't sound like a failure for Tesla to me.

If Jaguar wanted to actually damage Tesla they'd need to capture the sales of people seriously thinking about getting a Tesla today. And yeah... I don't think they're going to do that, the least of which is because of pricing. Someone considering a Model 3 isn't going to pay tens of thousands extra for a Jaguar that's outside of their budget."
"They're not advertising much, but they're not ignoring it either. They're discounting the shit out of the Bolt. It seems like they don't think more advertising would be worth it. I feel like Chevy knows the Bolt is just obviously an inferior option. Pretty much the only thing the Bolt has that the Model 3 doesn't is one-pedal driving, and the Model 3 has a whole lot more that the Bolt doesn't have. And the MSRP for the two vehicles is the same. Chevy has to offer like $12000 off to get anyone to buy them, and they're still massively outsold by the Model 3, which also isn't advertised much."
"I honestly don’t know what their thought process was. My best guess is: a combination of disbelief that an electric car (that doesn’t suck!) could exist at all, first, combined with a lack of keeping up to date with tech/auto news.

They all accepted that it was an electric vehicle, although some of them refused to believe even *that* until I popped open the charging port to show them there was nowhere to put the gas.

One tried to convince me that Tesla must be another “brand” of one of the existing companies like how Chevy and ~~Dodge~~ Buick are both really GM, and that I just didn’t know who was really behind the company. I assured them I was quite sure that was not the case, and that Tesla even has its own ticker symbol, but there’s no getting through to some folks.

EDIT: thanks for the correction, u/paulwesterberg!"
"And this right here is the reason why Tesla keeps chugging along and these companies cant innovate. Because you have less parts to break and less consumables, you don't have to take your car to a dealership not nearly as often. 
Why would the dealerships push people to get EVs then?"
"Yup. Once I finally picked up a Tesla and gave my coworkers rides, they all shut up about ""omg Tesla bad this"" and ""Tesla bad that"" instantly. :D"
"Wow, that's as much as 10 cassettes"

"Firstly, you do not understand what the word 'disingenuous' means.

Furthermore, it is completely standard that offers to open up a patent library are contingent on it being reciprocal (in other words, both parties promise not to sue). Otherwise it makes no sense. It's just like the GPL in computer software."
[deleted]
"> The patent libraries of every other manufacturer are wildly valuable and would be worth far more to an upstart manufacturer than the reverse.

Maybe.  I'm not sure how much of the Model 3/etc is patented but they definitely have some stuff in there which nobody is close to putting into production.  

Perhaps other manufacturers have a much larger number of patents, but Tesla clearly has the ""right"" patents in their product.

But, again, I said ""maybe.""  If the Model 3 is just good engineering and the patents it uses can be worked around then obviously it doesn't necessarily make sense for another company to license them on those terms..."
"Regular maintenance is done at a near loss for every dealer I have been to.

My VW dealer does oil changes for 60 + tax, the parts alone are \~40 dollars. So for \~20 minutes of bay time plus paperwork, plus moving the car, plus liability on the vehicle they only get 20 bucks + the discount they get in buying bulk oil and filters.

Plus when I get an oil change they give me a new keyfob battery for free if it is low, and top off all my fluids for free and give an X point inspection.

Warranty repairs are certainly profit, and especially out of warranty repairs. Out of warranty repairs are probably the vast majority of their profit."
"I think costs will come down as manufacturing gets more streamlined. I think the goal is to get the model 3 down to something affordable for most people.  Right now it’s “35k.” Eventually, I think it might actually be 35k, or even lower."
Didn't Bollinger ask if they can use it and never got a reply?
"Why would they?


Tesla offered that other manufacturers can use them, if they ""pay their fair share"".

At the same time....all Tesla cars can use other fast charger networks (Electrify America, EVgo, Ionity, ...) without Tesla Inc. paying their ""fair share"" to the network operators.


Tesla SuperChargers are also use non-standard proprietary plugs&protocols. While all others use the open standards CCS/CHAdeMO.


It just makes no sense at all for others to *buy* access to the SuperCharger Network."
"That's a large""duh"". No single entity will ever catch up to Tesla anytime soon with their EV departments. Working together would make it work."
Where are you?  In EU CCS2 is even better covered than in the US.
"In the EU there's Ionity for example. 133 locations so far, 50 under construction, they are aiming for 400 by the end of 2020.  These are 350kW chargers. 

Tesla has ~400 locations in the EU. Difference is that Ionity is just 2 years old."
EA has some issues from what I have heard regarding how new they are versus working at all for sure.
"BMW just ""retired"" it's president because he did not take action fast enough nor aggressively enough to take on Tesla so yes, ICE manufacturers are worried."
Just the way you wrote this comment warmed my soul - even better imagining it in the Family Guy style.
I have been following them since they jumped on that wagon.  Very disappointing to me since I think Toyota is the best auto company in the world for quality and engineering.  If anyone could build a quality electric vehicle for the masses it would them.  They are missing an opportunity.
"Is it enough time for them to adapt?  The current offerings have had 7 years or so and are still not on par with what those old Teslas offer.

The only interesting current BEV is the Porsche.  They actually chose to make a fast, attractive, sporty car with decent charging speed and while range is still lesser than the current Tesla offerings it isn't completely unpalatable."
"You are assuming the political status quo remains the same, what if it doesnt? What if in the next 5 years the majority of the highest CO2 emission countries actually get with the program and start banning gas vehicles altogether? A few have already, wouldn't take that much for them to decide to bring that ban forward a few years,,,,"
I sort of get them.  I have worked for them most of my career.  The culture is of slow and steady progress towards quality and efficiency.  This is a big change.  They will get on board with excellent products but only when the market has shifted I believe.  They are not risk takers.  Toyota and hydrogen is a weird one.
Ya the other guys are clean.....
"Well, the i3 is at least large enough that it can probably fit a normal-sized person.

Fiat, meanwhile, makes cars that look like they're for miniature people. They've been doing this for decades. Heck, I once saw a really old Fiat (perhaps from the 50's or earlier) that looked like you took a normal car of the era and hit it with a shrink ray."

THe ICE car Makers need to do this exact thing but because none of them are vertically integrated like Tesla they cant get the batteries, they cant get out of the contracts they have with 3rd party suppliers, they cant lay people off because of Unions (not a bad thing but just pointing out that is a problem when you have to pivot quickly).

They just *cant* change fast enough.

Tesla really can take whatever market share they want if they can scale quickly. I do occasionally wonder if they are just bidding their time until one of the ICE makers gets desperate enough to sell off assets that Tesla can then snap up for a song. They can clearly source the manufacturing machinery they need for GF3 in China easily enough."
"I wasn't saying it is easy, just that with skilled enough leadership, it is most certainly doable."
"He clearly has enough time to go through the traditional, shitty buying process ..."
"> Money is important but it won’t buy innovations if you don’t have the right people working on them

Yep. As a young software engineer from California, I can almost guarantee you that nobody in my demographic, who are the future, will willingly want to work at a legacy auto manufacturer over Tesla. This is the absolute requirement for developing intuitive, software-centric cars of the future that traditional car enthusiasts don't get and incorrectly believe is an easy problem for legacy auto to fix."
">It’s a bit different from Tesla to Netflix. Netflix had a great idea, lots of user data and executed it well. All Disney has to do is, invest a ton of money and develop a similar service, done.

You're really selling Disney short.  Netflix might be the best streaming platform, but their platform doesn't matter if they can't get content people want to see on it.  Disney then waited for the contracts on all that content to run its course, then refused to renegotiate it, and moved it to their platform.  On top of that they already owned Pixar and Marvel, and bought Lucasfilm and Fox to further choke Netflix.

The comparable would be if a major auto manufacturer started buying up all of Teslas suppliers for their critical technology and then refused to  sell Tesla the parts it needed to say, make its batteries.  I'm not saying that's what they'll do, but there are a lot of options outside of ""design a better EV than Tesla"" that the auto industry has to catch up to Tesla."
On top of everything you stated we didn’t even mention the tech. Which EV even comes close to the Tesla?
I stand by my statement. The ad is visibly showing how the car is overcoming all of the claims naysayers make. It was well thought out and well put together. It was discussed on this sub when it came out months ago and I discussed it with people then. My opinion on it being a good ad hasn’t changed.
Uhhhhh what? Do you expect Tesla to give them it for free?
Lmfao what? It’s literally the opposite of this.
That would kill all private industry investment in charging locations.

">  The shorts are betting the market for Tesla is already close to saturated. 

Its a little more nuanced than that.  Its almost that Tesla is too far ahead of the game.  Everyone acknowledges that EVs will eventually make up a significant share of the market, and that TSLA has the best EV technology.  The bet against them is that they run at a loss, and they will run out of their ability to borrow money before they see enough growth to be self sustaining.  That's why you see a lot of short talk focused on how many of TSLAs car sales are lower margin models.  They also see a lot of TSLAs eggs in the China basket at a time where US-China relations are in a bad spot, to put it mildly."
"~~reproduce~~ distribute. FTFY

Good luck reproducing teslas full vertical software stack."
"Tesla's operating losses are not related to gigafactory growth,unfortunately. They are losing money on a regular operating basis and need to fix that soon. They have plenty of cash to grow, but it would be nice if they also had cash from operations to increase the pile. Using debt/equity raises to pay for operations is not sustainable in the long term. Hopefully they are back to profitability in Q3."
Wait till the “Y” comes out. I like the 3 but launching a sedan when sedans are mostly dead was an odd choice. The Y replaces the suvs everyone is hungry for are hopefully a reasonable price (as the X is just too expensive). Based on the market suv’s sell 3:1 of their sedan stablemates on average. Demand for the Y should make the manufacturing hell of the 3 look like a vacation!
Or the upper hand will be on the other foot
"Yes... I was waiting for the Apple stock drop since 2009. I never would've imagined the most valuable company on the planet made all its money from selling a few phones and running the app store, but they held the title for a while. Stocks are weird."
"There are a couple of problem with how some analysts valued TSLA.  One is that they compare it to the traditional automaker which has much higher volume, but also more overhead (size of workforce) and also lower margins.  They are also not valuing the tech that TSLA has and assume that when traditional automakers enter the EV market, consumers will prefer buying from ""established"" auto brands.

TSLA has several unique aspects:

1. They are vertically integrated rather than relying on a huge set of suppliers which means they can have a higher profit margin
2. Being vertically integrated also means they have unique tech (batteries, motors, charging system, entertainment system, etc...)
3. TSLA isn't turning a ICE car into an EV, they built an EV rethinking what an automobile should be and many consumers seem to like this (at least many who have test driven a TSLA).  I think analysts miss that many consumers want to buy a TSLA, not an EV.
4. TSLA isn't an automotive company, they are a technology company.  Looks like Superchargers, over the air updates, their software in general, their energy and solar business.  Plans to eventually compete against Uber/Lyft.

Whether TSLA is overvalued depends on if you think they should be measured against automotive companies, or tech companies and what their future growth and profitability looks like."
"> They are short on Tesla because they can't afford Tesla to dominate the EV and future autonomous driving market.  

Or they think that it's unlikely that Tesla has the finances to support developing technology like this against organizations like Google and Uber, while at the same time developing a modern supply chain while at the same time designing a fleet of cars, while at the same time pioneering a new drivetrain system that is unmatched by any of the established players while at the same time trying to make money."
"Tesla learns from your driving whether you use AP or not.  On autonomy day they explained how the computer is always pretending it's driving and when you deviate from what the computer would have done, it's another data point of interest for their machine learning."
"You're welcome to disagree, and I'm sure there are some shorts that fall in to that bucket.  I'm talking about the large scale, professional investors who can actually move the market and who use shorting a stock as a means to make money, not as a political statement.

Most of the TSLA shorts fall into the professional group."
Taking a short position against something you despise is a bad way to make money.
"I don't know about that.  I believe the professional shorts have enough capital and influence to nudge certain vulnerable companies off a cliff.  If Tesla proves to be profitable moving forward I think we will see a majority of the negative spin suddenly stop as they will no longer be very vulnerable.  Tesla is fundamentally over valued representing a massive amount of money that could be transferred into short pockets.  It is simply a risk vs. reward play and not personal.  It's frustrating, but understandable.  Also, i think that smart shorts see that they have help nudging between Russia, middle east, ICE companies and large oil companies.  An extremely difficult industry to gain a foothold in, an overvalued company that is dependent upon loans, a stock price being artificially held up by ""fans"".  For a short, this seems like a perfect opportunity.  I get it.  I also play short and puts sometimes, though never with Tesla.  I hodl shares long and play calls.  Love the company, it's the only one that makes me feel optimistic about the future so am doing my best to help."
"When is Tesla going to address the cabin noise...

That said I question the quality of Audi or Jaguar when so many expensive services are required"
"> Of the EV’s I’ve driven it’s the only one that actually felt like the future. 

That's very true. And I think it's specifically because Tesla doesn't have a ""legacy"" holding it back. You can overlook the road/wind noise and build quality because it's the only EV that isn't trying to be anything else. While everybody else is lamenting losing ""the roar of a V8"" and trying to achieve the right nostalgic notes to keep their old customers happy Tesla has been free to just create from scratch. There's no nostalgia to lose so they are more free than others to push ahead."
"I doubt it, at least for a long time. Alternative energy buses are already a pretty well developed market. There's already half a million EV city buses on roads now. 

Tesla does well chasing undeveloped markets, I don't think they would fare as well with developed ones. City buses have such a unique operating profile that they have naturally attracted alternative drive systems for a long time."
"The idea was to produce something a little larger than a minivan but built more like a bus, and I think have it be autonomous.   They moved away from that pretty soon after that plan was released, in favor of just having regular cars in the shared network once FSD is a reality.  Long-term, they might eventually get back to that idea, if that niche (something between taxis and full-size buses) is still underdeveloped and attractive.

^(Edit: added “underdeveloped “)"
"Honestly, I hope so.

Maybe that'll tie in with what Boring Co. & the HyperLoop companies are doing?  I've no idea."
"It look like Boring Company tunnels should start popping up soon, and Boring Tunnels Shuttles made for Las Vegas will be early versions of “high passenger-density urban transport” in the plan."
"Except the electric bus industry is already a thing and many US buses are converted to natural gas, which is probably harder to compete against compared to gasoline cars."
"The fallout will happen when Tesla turns on full self driving (FSD). 

Tesla cars would then go from sitting 95% of the time to being used 50%+ of the time. Autonomy is gold."
I doubt that will happen within our lifetime. There will always be a niche need for ICE
I’ve never met those people. And hopefully they don’t think the Nissan Leaf looks amazing lol
"I don't think they look like shit but it does bug me that all of their models look *the same*. For a long time I couldn't even visually tell the difference between a model S and a model 3, and now the model Y is even closer to the model 3. It would be nice to have a little more variety in the designs."
[deleted]
Oh but it is for me. I never paid attention to a single hybrid or ev before Tesla came out because they were all ugly as shit.
"There's already a couple of EV hatchbacks, but still nothing with the range and charging network reach Tesla has, at least here. At the end of the day, that's more important to me than the car itself."
"> The Y looks to be about Outback-sized.

If you want something with a hatch and a larger interior, the Y will probably fit the bill.  If you want Outback-like ground clearance, I think we'll have to wait some more."
"That's pretty good. How much was yours? I got the Volt before they added the myChevy infotainment stuff so I have the pre-infotainment Chevy Volt, but that offers some cool and weird quirks to my car. Namely the fact that the center console can play DVD movies when in park, and with the Bose sound system it sounds pretty damn cool inside the car. There's also a 20 gig hard drive in the car so I can load music from a USB stick onto the car's hard drive to have music in there. There was something else too I can't quite remember right now, but i'll follow up if I remember."
"Actually, I think I'm saying something different. If Tesla increases their production by 20x they will not be supplying 10% of market demand (assuming self driving works and is permitted). 

A functional autonomous network will serve many more riders per vehicle, and will create the possibility for convenient mass transit rides connecting seamlessly into autonomous taxis to the final destination. 

If Tesla produced 20% of current automotive production per year, it would likely consume 95% or more of automobile purchase demand. We'll simply need many fewer vehicles in the future, and with the longevity of Teslas compared to ICE cars, it's likely that demand would be satiated on the curve up to 40x current output due to gradual increase in production and the previously unseen service life (in the small car market at least).

Compounding this is the very high likelihood of an increase in aviation for commuting in low population areas due to the deeply reduced cost of operation for short hop electric planes which will only grow more appealing as batteries improve."
"Yes, and yes this is Reddit after all.

Your analogy has a lot of issues with it that I don't agree with. The two situations are not in anyway comparable. Streaming services start with a full line up, cars do not. Media is too different to compare the two, etc

Simply put Tesla already competes with every other car out there. A couple more evs won't (and has not, this is backed by sales numbers) affect them because of the reasons I already stated.

If your position was correct when Audi and jaguar luanched their cars you would see Tesla market share fall. That did not happen. So with those you have facts saying your wrong. Why again are you right?"
You'd be surprised how many people still think ICE cars are superior to EVs overall.
"All those are fixed costs which pay off more with more production - again, something Tesla is reaping with Model 3 production."

"It took me a couple weeks, but the hook was set that day."

"funny fact - I recall an analysis said that the top two types of vehicles traded in for Tesla were BMW and Prius. Tesla is appealing to two different market shares, and neither of those suppliers has figured out that yet."
"That’s kind of the bottom line right there. Tesla doesn’t produce an electric car that happens to be good, they produce the best car on the market, period, and it just happens to be electric. Everybody else is still treating electric cars as a special-purpose novelty. 

Why can’t you buy an electric Mercedes S-class? Instead, Mercedes just offers the shitty little Smartcar as their electric car. Audi apparently has a nice electric car according to comments here, but it’s not in the same category as the S8 and therefore not in the same category as a Tesla. And since the first I’ve heard of it is the comments on a Tesla forum, they obviously aren’t working that hard to market it. 

Tesla has never needed advertising to sell their cars. Why? Because from day one, the product has been compelling in its own right. Sure, at first the novelty of being electric caught some traction with the Silicon Valley crowd who felt a tension between their consumption habits and their progressive values, but with the Model S they started just producing a car with unmatched technology across the board *including but not limited to* the electric drivetrain."
You have described me.  And my next vehicle purchase will unquestionably be a Tesla.
"The Bolt doesn't have Super Cruise. It doesn't doesn't even have adaptive cruise control, a feature that the discontinued Volt had for years.

GM still needs the Carb credits and can't compete with Tesla at a higher price point so they have no incentive to make the Bolt any better. The best they can hope is to cheapen it up a bit and compete against other low cost EVs which is difficult because LG designed the whole drivetrain."
What's the going price for the Bolt these days anyway?
"> Chevy and Dodge are both really GM

The Dodge brand is owned by Fiat-Chrysler."
"Exactly. Another reason that traditional companies face an uphill battle. What dealer is going to sell themselves out of a job? (Or rather, a lucrative income for the dealer owner)  They'll push the car that guarantees the customer will keep coming back for oil changes and tune-ups."
Yep. Gotta cannibalize your golden goose or someone else will. It's also another instance of market seeking short term profits and not rewarding long term profits as well.

I'm not lying. Once a company uses a patent they forfeit the right to sue Tesla if Tesla uses one of theirs. It effectively gives Tesla full rights to their own patent library, a ridiculously stupid offer.

"Tesla still can't mass produce a sedan at economy level pricing. And that's even with having Spartan bare bones interiors.

Many of these patents cover the things that enable manufacturers to pump out cars with high fit/finish, comfort and do it at prices lower end buyers can afford. As one offs most will look quaint, but combined they add up a lot. 

The Prius alone for instance has had 24,000 patents covering it. If you want to know why they could sell that thing near Camry level prices even near the start when it was all brand new tech it's because they developed and patented thousands of techniques to optimize every bit of the thing in manufacturing."
"That would be great. Because right now, wanting awd puts you above the canadian rebate limit and makes the car a LOT more expensive. I hope range options and especially awd will get cheaper."
Canada.
Most of the existing stations are only 50kW though.
"To be fair, they are the ones who popularized hybrids. I’m pretty sure if Toyota will do an EV, they’ll probably wait until they can make one cheaply with a decent range before releasing it.

I don’t think Toyota is chasing hydrogen too deeply- their only Hydrogen car is the Mirai, and it’s super expensive and relatively rare. Meanwhile, you can get pretty much every Toyota in a hybrid option, so there’s that."
With that line of logical you can literally justify anything.
"My dad was considering getting an i3 because they’re not that expensive used. Then, we went to a dealership to look at one IRL and he realized you can’t functionally fit more than 2 people in it."
God forbid I buy/lease ICE car out of warranty today's. 20k is a good price for i3 IMO.
"For some reason I thought they ended both to do a total reboot,  but right you are only then Volt is dead."
Which means they may have something at the dealers in 2021. Which is good timing for model 3 owners to consider an alternative. I'll be watching closely.
I currently drive a Nissan Frontier 4×4.  My next vehicle purchase will most likely be an M3.

I’m not sure if we disagree. I absolutely think Disney knows how to properly use their money and time it right. My main point was that Disney has it a lot easier to catch up with Netflix than legacy Carmakers have it with Tesla. Netflix just isn’t having some insane technology advancements (anymore).
"If Disneys platform sucks they will lose. new content is made all the time. Does anyone really think there is n unlimited shelf life for garbage super hero reboots? or live action disney redos? 

The comic book generation is aging, the golden age fans are dying and the future is likely to be original content. Netflix does that pretty well. the legacy studios have shown they don't do originality well at all. All they want is blockbusters they can sell in china."
"Idk. But that’s still beside the point. 

I’d sacrifice all the sentry cameras, giant tablet screen, giant pano roof and more if the car cost $26k to start. 

The Tesla is a nice car but it’s a BMW competitor and not a Civic competitor. I think there needs to be a mass market EV in the $20-$30k range."
"It’s a cool ad and well done. But it requires the viewer to look for information himself instead of giving it out.  
Example:
“Electric just doesn’t have enough range” - Image of the car in the remote desert.  
That’s not enough, most people won’t get that and it’s also lacking any data. Add the range after that as a counter statement or show it on screen at least. 

Don’t forget that most people don’t watch commercials fully concentrated, they’re on their phone, making a sandwich etc. it’s commercials after all. If you don’t pay full attention you’ll hear that The car isn’t for you, it doesn’t have range...  

As said, it’s a cool ad and well done but as a commercial it’s bad."
"what? no! I'm just saying that you can't blame other OEMs for not partnering up with Tesla on Superchargers since we are not privy to what a contract like this would have looked like. other oems could have approached Tesla with a suitable contract and Tesla would have said ""no thank you""."
"Yes.  This needs to happen.  Do you buy Ford gas and Chevy gas (I know not anymore).  The Wawa or whatever will get a percentage and everything is generic from there.    

But there should be a requirement that they make an investment in the network and they can brand the parts they invest in (new superchargers) as long as they are compatible across the board.   

What was the point in opening the patents for this stuff if you weren't going to give it for free?   That's just standard old licensing of inventions."
Why?  the only info we have on this is from Elon himself. it's not like we have a contract that shows exact pricing and conditions required for Tesla to share Supercharger network.

"You can't just group all shorts into one mindset. You don't get to the most shorted stock in the market because they might have to raise capital again, which they have absolutely no problem doing.

"Yes, whatever - the point is, if they make twice as many cars next quarter, the cost of putting autopilot and FSD in all of them is not very much more than current production rates; indeed, since they've written most of it already, it's actually quite cheap. 

Whereas, each other auto maker has to develop their own software from scratch. It's not like all cars are like PC's and the software ports very simply from one make to another."
"Their 10K and 10Q statements disagree.

Their loss is not due to the costs of producing the vehicles they sell. If you remove R&D and other items not related to auto production, their OpEx + COGS are consistently lower than their auto revenue.

That R&D is to produce new models, improve future production efficiency, and to build AutoPilot/FSD, among other things. That’s all growth investment, not cost to earn their current revenue."

"Google seems to be the only one in any sort of position to match Tesla's self-driving efforts, but they're more of a threat to Uber(whose self-driving efforts are dangerously laughable) than to Tesla IMO. Right now all Google's cars are geo-fenced and require much more expensive LIDAR, which might make sense for a taxi service but probably won't make sense for individually owned and operated vehicles. Google also has to pay people to sit in their cars for all their miles, while Tesla gets all their miles for free.  
Could Google still compete as self driving taxis with this system? Sure, although they'd have to partner with someone(s?) to make the actual cars.   
Will they steal sales from Tesla? Probably not."
"They short TSLA because it’s fundamentally overvalued, and they fail to recognize that it’s strategically undervalued."
"Many ""professional shorts"" invest where there are dollars to invest.  There are lots of established automakers with lots of money to bet against Tesla.  Shorts offer them the bet against what they see as EVs being a sure loser.   

Without Jonas's clear manipulation of the market, shorts would have lost a ton of money. SEC looked the other way because lots of vested interests needed an exit. 

The shorts will have a hard time if the EV market continues to grow.  If EVs make it to 6% of the market that bodes well that we are on the S curve of adoption, Tesla will take a very high percentage of a market that could double annually for the next 5-10 years.   Tesla Model 3 is already a top 5 selling car up there with Camry, Accord, Corrola and Civic.  As more people decide to go electric Model 3 and Model Y could become the top selling car and SUV.  

Most of the car sales Tesla looses today are due to not having a product at the price point / feature (e.g. Mid price SUV, pickup or  below car $30k).   As Tesla fills in the gaps they will squeeze more and more of the market."

"> When is Tesla going to address the cabin noise...

Fixing that reduces the vehicles range (adds weight) and increases cost.  So I wouldn't expect that for a while."
"I have a secret hope that they have already addressed it and my model 3 will be e-tron/EQC quiet when it arrives in a few weeks time. 

If that happens, I’ll play a lot of lottery tickets as well, because the odds are astronomical 🙈.

In the meantime I don’t think it’s a selling point for Tesla, and they don’t have the right background to find it to be an issue. Sound proofing is expensive though. They might just as well end up putting noice cancellation in. Much lighter."
Minibuses are the most popular form of transport in many 3rd world countries due to their ability to carry lots of passengers at low cost per passenger. Small buses could serve more flexible routes and are less costly to operate when nearly empty. You can easily add more buses as demand increases.
"If Boring Co. can get the tunnel costs way down in the way that SpaceX is getting launch costs down, then it might be helpful. But tunnelling is a big enough international industry that I'm disinclined to think there's anything sufficiently special about TBC to result in a step-change.

Hyperloop is basically dismissed as vapourware among transit types."
"Lets give that a caveat, then:

> The war isn't won until *volume* ICE production is shut down and dismantled.

There will likely always be gearheads who will pay through the nose for a loud, gas-burning engine instead of a ""soulless"" motor. There's even a sci-fi book written in the *90s* which subtly argued that some people would continue paying the taxes that governments will one day put on ICE vehicles to eventually get them off the road.

But that'll be a *minuscule* fraction of the number of passenger and freight transport vehicles being manufactured. 

For instance, once Tesla, or whoever, solves long range EV trucking, diesel trucks will go the way of the dodo *fast*. Shipping companies care about cost, and EVs *destroy* diesels in terms of long term operating cost. Once they can make the same long-distance trip in essentially the same timeframe, diesel cabs will start vanishing *extremely* quickly, even if the EV cabs cost more up front."
You just met one. I don't think any of the Tesla cars look good. And neither does the Leaf.
"I do agree, but I would put that very low at list of this Tesla needs to do. Like improving quality of their cars, quality of delivery and service, being profitable or S/X interior/battery refresh"
You mean the community that constantly shits on other companies cars without ever owning one ?
That's a fact
I've never been much of a fan of more ground clearance myself. So far it looks like the Y has more of it than the 3 which is about all I really want. Any snow here in MN deep enough to cause an issue with ground clearance higher than what the 3 has and we're staying home anyway.
"""Tesla is reaping with Model 3 production""

That's funny, last I checked their debt keeps growing."
"I am in the non-home owners who street park and live in a freezing climate crowd.  Which is to say I personally am the worst case scenario for owning an EV in that I have to rely on a Supercharger (which only opened a couple months ago). 

I support Tesla's mission and electrification but if it wasn't for Autopilot I would have stuck to investing and advocacy.

If you're in the market though for an EV because you believe in the environmental mission and want to see transportation electrified, you should buy a Tesla and not deny Tesla their well earned near-monopoly on electric vehicles by virtue of actually committing to the cause and doing electric cars justice.  I do recognize though that for some people an ICE still just is far more practical."
It's denial
"What's most ironic about the people trading in their Priuses is that Toyota could have probably kept a good number of those customers if they had been out in front with making a BEV. They literally already had the perfect car to turn into their first BEV that already had a lot of marketing behind it as the fuel efficient vehicle for those who wanted to save money and help the environment. Instead all they can do is belatedly release a PHEV with a pitiful 25 miles of EV range, and some highly misleading MPG numbers that mix together their electric & gasoline numbers."
Mercedes EQC is coming. I'd love for it to do better than etron/ipace. Somehow I doubt it'll really dent Tesla sales though. The Model Y will overrun all three of these cars combined.
"> The Bolt doesn't have Super Cruise. It doesn't doesn't even have adaptive cruise control, a feature that the discontinued Volt had for years.

Seriously ? 

Even the Leaf has (or can have) adaptive cruise control(I've specifically upgraded the trim on mine for that). Plus lane keeping etc(pro pilot assist). 

I don't know what Chevy is thinking. Is the Bolt just a compliance car now? I don't get the discontinuation of the Volt, it was a hybrid done right and a good transitional vehicle."
"Around here, they're something like $26,000 if you use Chevy financing, $27,000 if you don't. It's probably the best deal you can get on a new EV if you don't much care about anything but range, but I still feel like it's not a great deal, because 1) they're already in the phase-out of their federal credit in the US, and 2) the Bolt hasn't had a significant revamp ever and there's going to be a flood of dirt-cheap used ones in the near future."

"Honestly, I can't say I've looked at any of these patent portfolios so I couldn't tell you what is good execution vs IP.  

It sounds like a Model 3 costs about $20-25k to make based on Munro's claims.  I'm not sure if the other vendors can actually crank out an EV for that cost - most EVs cost a bit more due to the batteries/etc, and probably due to the smaller runs.  Fit/finish on my model 3 seems just fine - I went over that car pretty closely and couldn't really see any asymmetries, though obviously a year ago that was a big problem."
That's not true though. In Germany for example there are more 100kw+ CCS plugs than supercharger plugs.
"Actually, for many people they were incredibly affordable. With incentives, some people were getting I3s for insanely cheap. I'm talking $125/month leases.  Even in the used market, they've depreciated so hard that they've become quite affordable."
"Disney spent a lot more than any company would have to spend to catch up with Tesla.  The cost of catching up to Tesla is the cost it would take to get shareholders to accept a buyout.  Today Tesla's market cap is $40.5 Billion at $226 per share.  If someone came in and offered say $82 billion, or $420 a share, there's evidence that they'd take it.  Today, you might get it for a lot less than that.

Meanwhile, Disney spent $71.3 Billion on Fox, another $4 billion on Lucasfilm, and billions more producing content.  Then they had to go out and spend billions more building their digital streaming platform (which itself took years of software engineering.)   This is valuing the Disney film and television catalogue itself at $0.

If you define how difficult something is by how much it costs to achieve, then outflanking Netflix is a lot harder then outflanking Tesla, as long as its an established player and not someone who hasn't made cars before.  Disney got their act together when they bought BAMtech in August 2016.  So if we say they're equally hard, then Tesla has a 3 year head start vs a committed established auto manufacturer, if buying them isn't an option."
I see what you mean. I am tired of driving a shit car with no tech. My 05 grand Cherokee is done as far as I am concerned. I want to jump up a few notches.
"It's not going to inform someone in one viewing of the benefits of an EV, however after a few viewings it will start to set the mental thought process that they should look into EVs as maybe they aren't as bad as they thought.  This is a very good strategy for marketing, as overcoming preconceived notions isn't going to happen in a single 30 second viewing."
The difference is: Tesla already has in many places; a sizeable network already built.
"So why should Tesla give them free access to the charging network? 

I feel like requiring the billionaire car companies to have to invest in the network, is far cheaper than them having to build their own network from scratch"
Elon has no obligation to even offer to share the network whatsoever.
Except for the fact that the stakes for cars are much much higher. If something fails in USB PD then your device doesn't charge (ideally) or worst case it damages your phone somehow. If something fails in an EV charger you are physically stranded at best and at worst your tens of thousands of dollars EV becomes damaged.
"Amazon didn't keep going back to the market to raise money.

Stop making this comparison. It's flatly untrue."
Tesla has substantially cut their CapEx spend for the year from what was guided.
"Sure, but Amazon didn't provide guidance that they would be profitable for every quarter, forever, only to run at a loss 2 quarters later.  Tesla did exactly this on its Q3 call last year.  They chose to be judged based on profitability instead of expansion, and development of new technology.

Amazon for a long time chose to set a different standard.  They chose to be judged based on evolving from a book store to a market place, then a cloud computing leader, and then a film and television studio.  The market responded accordingly when they demonstrated competence in those areas."
"> Amazon was ""running at a loss""

Amazon's retail operations never really turned a profit, though. They just happened to pivot a side business, started like 10 years into their operations, into their biggest money maker."
"Why is this easily verifiable falsehood so often repeated and upvoted?  Amazon has been profitable on a yearly basis since 2003--i.e. 6.5 years after they were founded.  They just reinvested *almost* every cent into growth--but even then they were still profitable.

Tesla is over 16 years old and they've never been close to being profitable on a yearly basis and certainly won't this year.  And this year they've slashed capex--their R&D has been absolutely gutted.  Amazon was able to keep growing the business profitably, while consistently increasing capex--specifically R&D.  For example, this year Tesla's depreciation is ahead of their CapEx--which is an extremely negative indicator--as it most likely means needed maintenance, facilities improvements, manufacturing equipment refresh--is not being done.  That will catch up to them in a major way eventually if they don't flip that.  

So in short, Tesla is absolutely nothing like Amazon in any form.  I don't know why this keeps getting repeated, its maddening."
"Amazon never had to go back to the capital markets after IPO. 

If it wasn't for the capital markets continuing to give Tesla money, they wouldn't be in business. 

See the difference?"
"Amazon made money and invested it back into R&D. 

Tesla loses money and finances more. 

The two are fundamentally different."
"Amazon ran a profit but invested it, tesla runs a deficit and invests capital raising revenue. Completely different and incomparable.

There are quarters amazon did not run a profit before investments, but those were rare and did not occur year after year. Excluding a few quarters, Amazon has always run a profit."
"Not to mention the fact that, once Tesla establishes a good foothold in China, if it fails in the US market it could easily focus on China and they would love to have both a big western automaker and will brace the technology because they know how critical it will be to the future of their country."
"And Tesla can mass brick Teslas in China. 

Everyone loses. China wants to see ev adoption. They are pushing it hard, and they want Teslas in China. Even if they don't get along with the US, they want Teslas, including the self driving promise, and they won't have a problem dealing with Tesla in the interim until they develop a satisfactory domestic replacement, if they are even compelled to do so. They also likely want to deal with Musk in orbital access pursuit."
"There are other manufacturers to buy it from, as many car manufacturers have purchased electronics from 3rd parties for pretty much ever."
"Appreciate the reply and I've read through or at least skimmed both docs. We're in agreement with what their R&D is for and that they make money solely on the automotive production component of their business. Unfortunately, SG&A, R&D and interest are real business expenses that have to be taken into account and are, for the most part, not just temporary ""growth mode"" costs. They have done a good job of keeping SG&A and R&D relatively stable over the past 4 quarters; they just haven't been able to grow revenue/profit enough to overcome those expenses. As a growth company, that's a big problem they obviously need to resolve. And growing revenue is going to be no small feat if there's actually a recession in the cards.  

As to R&D being growth investment, sure, but every company is spending on R&D at all times. That expense never ends or a company is doomed. Tesla spends ~5% of revenue on R&D just as Ford spends ~5% of revenue on it. GM spends slightly more at ~5.3% of revenue. Point is, Tesla is no more in growth mode as far as R&D than any established automaker. You also have to remember Tesla is selling products (FSD) and recognizing revenue currently based on the hope that much of that R&D pans out.  

I'm not trying to suggest Tesla is inherently fucked, but they are most definitely operating at a loss based on their current operating model and the only way they are going to turn a consistent profit is to grow revenue at a rate higher than SG&A expense grows. That's where profit margin and ASP becomes incredibly important. Hopefully the China factory pays off big time, because they are definitely close."
"Prices are driven by psychology. When someone says there's a bubble in Beanie Babies, baseball cards, tulips, or Bitcoin, that doesn't mean that the prices can't stay high. It just means it's an inherently dangerous investment.

Tesla isn't making money yet, and its borrowing costs are pretty high.

Hostess, Toys R Us, GM, Chrysler, Kmart, American Airlines, iHeartRadio/Clearchannel all still exist in some form today, because their assets still have a ton of value. It's just that at some point, their shareholders got wiped out, while the value of the company was snatched up by new people.

When people buy a stock, they're betting on shareholders not getting wiped out. Tesla as an entity will survive, and at some point they will take off before they run out of runway. The question is whether they'll take off with the current passengers on the plane, and whether buying a ticket on their currently scheduled flight will get you in the air."
"> Sure, although they'd have to partner with someone(s?) to make the actual cars. 

Good thing one of Alphabet's board members [might have a friend or two in the industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Mulally).

And its not 1 company you worry about if you're Tesla .  Its 1980s Apple vs Microsoft.  No one back then thought Windows was better designed than Mac.  But because Microsoft played nice with others, while Apple didn't, it led to Windows being the standard.  That unwillingness to partner with other firms was something Jobs regretted later in life and wish he had done better at instilling in company culture."
"Next time you need to do one of those ""select the images that contain X"" captchas remembers that google employs everyone in the world. Tesla needs to employ people to annotate footage, google gets it for free.

The bottleneck of the annotation is much worse than recording data. This is the struggle with ""big data"", it is easy to collect data but difficult to analyze it. You almost always collect more data then you can categorize and scaling collection is much cheaper then annotation.

 It takes many more people to annotate one vehicles footage then it takes to collect that footage."
How can something be overvalued and undervalued at the same time?
They don't fail to see the strategic potential.  They are betting that Tesla will not be able to survive long enough to reach their potential.
"Insulation is pretty light, we are talking about 10-20 pounds tops to make it dead quiet. Expense is why most companies do not do it. It needs to be installed, which requires time, manpower, and additional steps. And it is an additional point of failure, which requires more engineering. 

ex. see B5 VW/Audi passat/A4 which some had wheel arch rust due to foam collecting water and rusting. Cost VW a decent amount.. Uncommon and only occurred due to a secondary issue but it can happen, any additional complexity costs a lot."
"Yeah, that's pretty much what I mean. There will always be hobbyists and enthusiasts. Some people still have horses. There's still somebody producing [new biplanes](https://www.wacoaircraft.com/about). Ford produced a handful of [new Model Ts for its centennial](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/28/automobiles/what-s-new-at-ford-try-the-2003-model-t.html). But no one would consider any of those any kind of threat to what replaced them. Large scale production is the main issue.

I don't how long it take for EVs to win. Tesla is making rapid progress but they still have a long way to go."
Is there an electric car u like? You like the new c8 vette?
"So a Tesla owner shit on your car unfairly and as retribution you've spent months shitting on a car you've never owned? Whatever your opinion is about anything, that's pretty bizarre mate. Can't be a healthy obsession."
"And, they're building a few more factories, they will soon make a more affordable SUV, they plan to reveal their pickup soon, they have a semi in testing... none of these are cheap, but all hold great potential."
"I agree that electric is more of a pain for renters, condo owners and dense urban dwellers w/o access to electrified private parking. L2 charging overnight make EV ownership much easier.

Eventually apartments and condo associations will realize that EV charging is like internet. Even places that lag on installing chargers will go electric once affordable FSD vehicle services begin operation."
"I had a rock-solid Toyota Camry hybrid. It was great for 11 years until I sold it to get a Tesla. With a 1600cc ICE and variable transmission (CVT) it was a perfectly adequate car and got highway gas mileage in city driving and decent acceleration with battery assist. No engine work needed, ever. (My 1991 Honda Civic hatchback had a 1600cc engine)  They've had a decade and then some to get their EV house in order, and they've stood still with the basic Prius tech instead.

Too bad. If Tesla made a car with a double battery layer for extended time between charges, they could probably steal the Prius taxi market - almost every taxi here is a Prius."
"Thank you. I ask because while my dream car is a Model Y, should my 10-year-old VW not make it till then, I will have to get another EV with a hatchback."
"It also states, clearly, the company will not pursue asserting any IP rights **against Tesla**..

I literally quoted the exact clause.

>>A party is ""acting in good faith"" for so long as such party and its related or affiliated companies have not: **asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla**"
"My loaded 17 Civic has auto pilot, leather seats, CarPlay, keyless entry, 42 mpg, 500W sound system with sub and more while it costs just $26k. 

The Tesla is cool as hell and I want one...don’t get me wrong. But it doesn’t offer $13-$14k more worth of value imo. And I still have to deal with extra difficulty charging it since I don’t have my house yet.

I’d like to see them offer a Model 3 with a standard sized sunroof rather than the full roof panorama and no sentry cameras to maybe reduce the cost further to the $30k-$32k area at least."
exactly - he did make that offer through and now evreyone somehow thinks the only reason other cars can't use it is because their manufacturers have a stick up their bottom.
That doesn't actually make it any more difficult to do.
Does that even include Giga3 which is being funded by raising capital locally in China?
"Sure, but it’s still substantial, and a large part of their OpEx is growth investment. If you take just auto revenue and weigh it against just auto COGS and auto-production OpEx, they’re clearly running a sustainable, profitable auto business (assuming demand remains at least constant)."
Yeah that's fair. Elon needs to let the CFO talk about forward looking guidance. Wish he would step back and let finance folks handle investor communications.
">  They chose to be judged based on profitability instead of expansion, and development of new technology.

No they didn't. Tesla CAGR as a public company is >70%, you can't even find a complex manufacturing company to compare this growth rate with, the closest thing is amazon. Absolutely ridiculous to judge a company growing that fast on profitability. Elon making a off the cuff remark on a conference call doesn't change the very real growth story."
"and don't forget the narrative that amazon wasn't profitable simply wasn't true.  They consciously made a decision to reinvest 99% of their profits back into the business, but even then, they were profitable.  This sub makes it sound like Amazon lost many billions of dollars every year up until the last few years, when in reality they've been profitable every single year since they were 6.5 years old as a company.   and that 6.5 years included the dot com meltdown and 9/11."
"Well, wouldn’t it be a good time to buy stocks, now?  Tesla can pull a profit, not by sponsoring a race team or by spending money on marketing to raise demand, but by putting their employees to work.  Use profitability as a valuation of the stock, the engineers and designers are preoccupied with building the future, you’ll thank them in 10 years."
"by ""really"" of course you mean its(retail business) been consistently profitable for 16 years of course."
CapEx is not R&D. R&D is OpEx.
"I find this a good point at the same time as the discussion also spins around if they are comparable or not.  

Interesting reading the comments even if I've read similar over and over before."
"They don't ""lose money on every car"", they have a very healthy profit margin, higher than larger automakers.  They invest it back into rapidly ramping up for a worldwide market and for newer models.   

Auto manufacturing is insanely capital intensive compared to AWS, which Amazon was investing in. Tesla took the bet on grabbing as much of the market as they could while they're ahead in tech, even if that means they need to borrow."
"This is simply not accurate. Amazon’s business the first several years looked very much like Tesla’s. Even later on, they were cash flow positive but didn’t report a meaningful profit for many years.

They’re also not directly comparable on all measures, they’re very different businesses. But the analogy is sound, in that either company (present day Tesla or past Amazon) could choose to turn a profit if that were their only goal. But instead they are focused on growth and are happy to delay profitability in order to invest further in their long-term vision."
"True... but the software needs to be adapted for the specifics of each automobile.  Different camera placement, different motor and steering characteristics, braking distances, does it have regen, etc. Not to mention the extras like windshield wipers and entertainment systems.  Full Self Driving? A whole new level, not to mention adapting that to driving on different sides of the road, and different traffic signage.

I suspect there is an opening for a company that can produce the Window or Linux of car operating systems, easily adaptable to a wide range of hardware.  but for now - each car company appears to start from scratch, and that costs money."
The result is a pretty awful user experience though.
"Interesting that tesla spends a tiny fraction on R&D compared to companies that 10x bigger. And are still much more innovative. Half of that r&d is probably on the Y, roadster, semi, pickup, and the other half on FSD. They aren’t recognizing revenue on these yet, though they are getting cash on FSD. Meanwhile every other her car company is spending way more on catching up to where tesla was years ago, crappy compliance cars, and slight gains in ICE power. 

OTOH, teslas SG&A staying flat when they double revenue again isn’t something Locked in. They have a mess of service that early adopters have been willing to put up with.   They were able to keep it relatively flat with the 3 expansion because they already had a lot of the stores and chargers in place and were just filling unused capacity, but they are a lot busier now."
"I think Tesla will reach a point where they have to decide if they go the Apple route or the Microsoft/Android route. Right now they have options (and the bear case is that they go the RIM, Nokia, or Danger route).

I think the best bull case is really the Microsoft or Android route. If they reach a point where they can’t produce enough cars, but nobody else can match their tech, they have the opportunity to enter the platform business, and sell/license tech (both hardware and software) to the other auto makers. That can be an extremely lucrative position to be in."
"But didn't the same attitude make Apple build an undisputable ecosystem and that makes a good profit even if they don't sell a lot of new core devices? I mean if apple played well with others and contributed to Android I'd have gotten a Samsung watch rather than an Apple watch. Apple has the best ecosystem, they are unbeatable and kept innovating at their own pace irrespective of the market. I always see Tesla as the apple, they have their own supercharging stations, their own niche user interface and experience that gets people addicted to them. And just as Apple, they try to get as many components in house as possible."
"If you look solely at the financial statements disclosed by Tesla, it looks like the firm is severely overvalued. Now the annual reports also contain non-financial information that is relevant for future cashflows and profitability. There are also factors that are not disclosed by the company, such as the state of their R&D projects and what the projected returns of these projects are. All this non-financial information is not reflected in the analysis of the financial statements. Thus, from a fundamental standpoint, Tesla is overvalued, but from a strategic standpoint, because of Tesla’s standing in its market and the long term prospects of both the firm and the market, Tesla can be viewed as strategically undervalued. A good investor considers both firm fundamentals and non-financial information when making a decision."
"This company is a great example of it.  For the sake of notation, I'll us TSLA to refer to the company, which is overvalued (by a lot) and Tesla for the technology, which is undervalued.

Generally, the market wants to love TSLA, but they make it really hard on themselves.  A year ago, TSLA made the statement that ""every quarter from here to eternity will be profitable"".  That lasted 1 more quarter, then Q1 hit.  We were told that this was a correction, because European markets were being opened up and a the vehicles in transit would make up for it in Q2.  Q2 was not profitable.  Q2 also set a new all time high for vehicles delivered.

Had TSLA instead said ""we've now shown that we can be profitable, but our focus needs to shift on ensuring that we control the EV market so that no company will catch us.  Some quarters will be profitable, others will not be, but for now TSLAs priorities will be development of the Model Y, then the Semi, then the truck, all while in parallel developing full self driving technology"" the market would judge TSLA by those standards.  Instead TSLA chose to be judged by the state of its finances, which is like judging a Marvel movie based on its quality of acting.  That's not why you're in the theater, nor its strongest point.

Meanwhile, at Tesla, they actually have the best technology for what will be the fastest growing segment of the auto industry for the foreseeable future.  Its almost comical how far ahead of the market they are.  On top of the cars, they also own the most charging infrastructure in the world.  On top of that they have a compelling case to make that they are likely to be the first company with a viable full self driving car.  Tesla itself, is one of the most innovative companies in the world, and one of the most desirable companies in terms of attracting a generation of young engineers now.

Its a wonder that this company is both of these things at the same time, while only one can be true in the long run.  Shorts focus on TSLA, while longs see Tesla.  Its the ultimate Schrodinger's cat of companies."
"Fundamental analysis tells it's a doomed company. FA haven't dealt with companies like tesla, at the same time. Garbage in, garbage out. Fuck TA.

Regardless of what FA might imply, it doesn't put a price on a revolutionary upside. This is where the price is undervalued.

In reality, there's only one correct price - whatever is current in the market, for better or worth."
"Interesting, I thought it was a bit more weight than that."
No the old vettes looked much better. The taycan looks nice so far to me. Depends how it looks without the camouflage. Out of the Teslas the model s Looks the best but I still don't like it. The front of Teslas always looks weird. Like a swollen lip after you got punched in the face. Especially the model 3.
How is that an obsession. And no it's not retribution for someone saying shit about my car. Hilarious that people here simply can't accept that Teslas aren't perfect and people don't like things about them.
"Do you think Tesla is the only automotive manufacturer building new factories and developing new vehicle models? Everyone does that, and everyone else figures those things into their margins and doesn't pretend platforms are profitable when they are losing money while selling them."

I can see exactly why you don’t want to spend the money
I promise you Jaguar and Audi have the money to pay whatever he’s asking.
"> Does that even include Giga3 which is being funded by raising capital locally in China?

That isn't really what is happening in China.  Basically the Chinese government is building the shell of the factory, and instead of paying for the construction Tesla agreed to pay the Chinese government taxes of $320 million per year (but only starting in like 2023).  Tesla's only capex then is the actual equipment and machinery installed in the factory.  That has allowed them to build out capacity without spending a lot of cash up front, but will curtail their profitability in the future."
">Sure, but it’s still substantial

It's less than depreciation."
"Are you doubting that they have a model, likely approved by the CFO that showed profitability on a sustained basis. I work in finance and see this shit daily. Assumptions and plans change. The comment was short sighted on their part but regardless of if the CEO or CFO said it, they likely thought it was true with their set of assumptions at the time."
"He's doing fine. Don't like uncertainty, don't invest."
"> Tesla CAGR as a public company is >70%

Just remember the CAGR since 2013 is less than half the rate from 2010-2013.  And the current estimate for revenue growth in 2019 is under 15%.  Put another way, Amazon's revenue is still growing at almost 20% a year, nearly two decades after they become sustainably profitable, while Tesla's revenue growth has fallen below Amazon's while they are still losing billions."
"neither of you are exactly correct: Amazon didn’t make money to invest, they did invest borrowed money and made no money at all for years.  
Tesla does make profit per car sold, but their overhead and fixed expenses eats it all. So at the end of the day, they don’t reinvest profits,they lose money and borrow more to expand"
"Tesla could not turn a profit, even if it wants to. That’s the difference. 

This is based on their released financials. They literally lose money on each car they sell. R&D plus service and all associates costs to business are too much. This is not including expansion."
Imagine the F150 with FSD.
Not always.  I hate teslas infotainment even compared to my truck's sync3
"I think this is a bad analogy. Microsoft and Apple needed third party companies to write software to use on the PC/Mac. Cars don't need a third party to provide anything. Most people charge at home from power provided by 3rd party energy company or solar or whatever. Whether it's Superchargers or whatever, standards will be set for how chargers are built and Teslas will likely work with both or all of them."
"He's talking 1980 apple, not now apple, the best thing about Macs back then was graphic desgners"
Name one thing the apple ecosystem does that cannot be done in the android ecosystem?
Thanks for the explanation.
"> A year ago, TSLA made the statement that ""every quarter from here to eternity will be profitable"". 

Why such a strawman? This is what was actually said:

Elon:
>Moreover, we expect to again have a positive net income and cash flow in Q4 and I believe our aspirations certainly will be for all quarters going forward. I think we can actually be positive cash flow and profitable for all quarters going forward, leaving aside quarters where we may need to do a significant repayment, for example in Q1 next year, but I think even in Q1, I think we can be approximately flat in cash flow by end of quarter.

https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2018/10/25/tesla-motors-inc-tsla-q3-2018-earnings-conference.aspx"
"True their public communication is not good but then again elon has a thought time with public speaking, have you heard him speak? . He is really smart but not everyone is good at everything. I'll cut him some slack atleast he knows what he is doing."
"Rolls and Bentley probably put 3x+ more in than that, but I do not think most manufacturers are even trying to get close to their levels.

All Tesla would need is more foam and deadening on the arches (fairly light), more deadening on the underbody (very very light), and slightly more insulated glass (most the weight as glass is heavy)."
Yea taycan looks nice and I love the interior.
What do you think of the Polestar 2?  I think that will give the Tesla a run for its money... eventually...
"not meaning to be rude and I wholeheartedly agree that Tesla is far from perfect. I also don’t like Samsung, but I don’t spend days at Samsung subreddit pointing to all the flaws about the company. I am really curious about your motivation, as many people think that Tesla is not so great company, but not many come in here trying to educate fans"
Asserting IP rights against Tesla is considered breaking the pledge. Ipso facto the pledge effectively requires the company to let Tesla use any of their own patents/trademarks/copyrights in return for free.
"Okay thanks for clearing that up for me. My point is people are just looking at the number, seeing that it is getting reduced, but not looking at what they hell they are actually doing. 

Like sorry but if you are just looking at the number and not at all factoring in that they just built a gigafactory in their potentially TOP region for vehicle sales in a matter of fucking months (insane), then you're essentially lying about Tesla's investment into their future. It really is as simple as that."
You expect them to fund a fresh product ramp every quarter? Why?
"In video/live presentations, Elon regularly blurts out stuff, that you can see other folks on stage weren't in agreement with sharing.    

He's not good at keeping the cat in the bag, because he's an optimist at heart. That's what keeps me as a Tesla supporter.  

From an investment standpoint, we aren't tuned for outlooks that tilt toward optimism at the risk of getting it wrong most of the time. Hence the mismatch between what he communicates and what investors interpret."
"> And the current estimate for revenue growth in 2019 is under 15%. 

This is nonsense."
This is not generally true. Their automotive revenue exceeds COGS and automotive OpEx. Based on those their automotive business has been profitable over the last 5+ quarters. Depending on how you count other factors (depreciation of assets) you could argue they’re closer to breaking even. But it’s not the bleak situation that some here want to present.
"That is incorrect. Their 10K and 10Q show that they *could* turn a profit if they stopped non-automotive and growth activities.

R&D is not a cost of producing and selling cars. R&D is bring-up of new models, software innovations, and AutoPilot/FSD development."
"Yes, IMHO the Tesla Pickup should have the same battery as the Model 3 LR-AWD; but 2 layers of battery for double the range. That would be an awesome electric vehicle. (Crew cab?) Plus, they should also make a utility Panel van the same and corner the delivery market.  Elon was talking about adding a 120V inverter to power tools off the truck too. Up to 600mi range, extremely versatile, and the bed could be much lower than a typical pickup.  And it would look cool too.  Heck, throw in the option for a third layer of batteries for longer distance."
"I think you missed the point of the analogy. It’s not about “needing” third party software. The Microsoft/Android analogy is to PC or phone OEMs. The model Tesla could pursue in the future is as a supplier to Ford, VW, Toyota, etc. While FSD is the ultimate offering in this regard, they could provide much more than that - from battery management, to OTA updating, to remote access (phone app), to subscriptions and billing (including charging), to a software/“app” ecosystem.

Not saying this will happen, but it’s one avenue for mega success."

There’s a difference between being awkward and making misleading statements.  He’s very lucky he hasn’t been in significantly more trouble for the missteps he’s made.
Yeah that's another good point. The build quality of Tesla just isn't there and their interior looks aren't my taste either.
Polestar 2 looks decent. To me it tries to look like a muscle car
I hardly spent days here pointing out flaws. Not even hours. I don't know why you think I do. It's not like I'm constantly on here commenting. I read quite a bit here and once in a while comment. That's how most people use reddit. And I wouldn't call it fans. Many people in here are outright delusional.
[deleted]
I don't expect them to do anything. My point is that their lack of profit can't reasonably be attributed to growth expenses when they don't really have any relative to their fixed costs.
"Is it?  Revenue in 2018 was $21.461 billion, so a 15% increase would be $2.468 billion in 2019.  Through the first half of the year total revenue has been $10.891 billion.  So in the second half of the year they would need revenue to be $13.789 billion, or $6.895 billion in each of Q3 and Q4.  In Q2, when they had record deliveries, higher selling prices, and a better product mix than they'll have in the second half of the year, revenue was only $6.35 billion."
"R&D is a cost of selling cars. Most manufactures list it as such. Tesla is an abnormality in that sense, which they do deliberately to make it seem like they can turn a profit. 

Without R&D you will not be in the market long."
"It's a must that it's a crew cab,  and not a yuppie truck like the conceptual drawing being passed around.

 Bed height may be close to the same since tire size, and compression for payload dictate alot of that.  IMO nobody makes a work truck with a decent height bed, since everyone wants Bro dozers with 35“+ tires.

The inverter would have been a big deal a while ago, but battery powered tools are ruling the market.  Most framers I know only plug in their compressor, everything else is cordless."
"I meant to reply to the guy you replied to, he was using 1980s apple vs Microsoft analogy. The question is: is Tesla a hardware or a software company. In the 80's, apple tried to be a hardware company that also made the software. Then they licensed out the tech for others to make the PowerPC clones and almost went out of business.

For Tesla to decide to go the software developer route, they'd basically give up their battery advantage and hope people actually care about all the FSD and OTA stuff. It might end up being that BEV happens for the general public with cheaper regular cars without all the self driving and stuff. It's just a car, but instead of having an ICE, it has a BEV drivetrain. If that happened, Tesla would be SOL."
Whats the android equivalent of the iCloud hack?
"No, most people do not use reddit that way. Your obsession is strange."
"


>IPs don’t just “get used”, they need to have contracts

That pledge **IS** the contract. That is a publicly made open contract. It has the full legal standing of any other contract..

The contract explicitly stipulates that free use of Tesla's patents is contingent on the using party agreeing not to pursue any IP assertion against Tesla. Ipso facto, if a company wants to take the offer they are agreeing to let Tesla use their own IPs. That is baked into the contract, it's the leading item defining ""in good faith.""




It's you who is grossly misunderstanding the offer. There's a reason no manufacturer has taken Tesla up on the offer, it's a bullshit offer."
"Except that’s simply not true. They have been consistently profitable across 5+ quarters if you look only at their cost of automotive revenue, removing their growth expenses and other business costs (solar, etc)."
"Tesla also does quite a bit better on revenue in the 2nd half of the year vs the first. And they continue to expand production, targeting leaving Q4 at 7k/week model 3's. They will easily beat 15% CAGR."
Nope. That is completely false. Their financial reports break out the categories of OpEx spend. It’s straightforward math to add up automotive COGS (cost of good sold) and operating expenses related to automotive sales and service. They have been consistently smaller than automotive sales + lease revenue. That’s even over-counting some OpEx which isn’t broken out but isn’t directly related to the auto business.
Note that in my analogy I wasn’t limiting my definition of “platform” to software.
"Do you mean the iCloud servers ? I was talking about updates to the phones, not a remote server in a Datacenter.
Arguably Google is as good as or better than Apple at managing its servers.
Updating phones though... it’s up to the phone manufacturers not google, and they don’t have any incentives to update old phones when all they want is sell the new ones.
Rather, they have incentives not to, and this all comes from how the android ecosystem is structured."
I don't think you know what an obsession is. In like several months I have like 20 comments on here. That's nothing. You must have a really twisted reality to call that an obsession.
[deleted]
"> Tesla also does quite a bit better on revenue in the 2nd half of the year vs the first.

Not when they cut S/X production down to a single shift.  

> And they continue to expand production

Deliveries last quarter were 13.8% higher than in Q3 last year, yet revenue was down 7.0%.  Tesla's problem is they are selling more vehicles, but the vehicles they are selling are far cheaper.  That is why the fact that ~40% of Model 3 sales in Europe being SR+ in August is not a great sign.  

> targeting leaving Q4 at 7k/week model 3's.

“What people should absolutely have zero concern about, and I mean 0, is that Tesla will achieve a 10,000 unit production week by the end of next year. […] I think people should really not have any concerns that we won’t reach that outcome from a production rate.”

- Elon Musk, Q2 earnings call __2017__

> They will easily beat 15% CAGR.

We are talking about 2018 to 2019 - nothing to compound...."
R&D is an operating expense to exist in the industry.
It's all part of the security fence around the ecosystem.
who hurt you? lol
"IP law is enforced through civil lawsuits. If the owning party agrees to not pursue a civil case against you then they are effectively agreeing to let you use any IP they own, since there is otherwise nothing stopping you. 

That you don't see this is baffling. That you claim lawyers told you otherwise just sounds like you got robbed by hacks. Hope you didn't pay them much"
You could say the same about Amazon. That’s the point.
Nobody hurt me. I don't know where you get the idea from. I'm also not as invested in this as you think. It's quite funny actually how you seem to imagine me being very passionate and angry about this lol.
[deleted]
"I could and would say that about amazon.

Even with R&D amazon was profitable, excluding one or two initial quarters.  That has been my point the entire time.

Amazon only had to raise funds once. Yet they massively expanded in a similar physical product world."
"> I don't know where you get the idea from.

From you, bro. your comments near the top of this chain. It's pretty obvious and sad. That's all."
You're leaving out Part 5 where Tesla now sues Company A for using their battery patent. Now Company A is in the hole for paying them damages for every vehicle with the battery tech in it.
"No, for a long time they were not. That is the point."
lol what? trust me you don't need to worry about me. it's normal comments 😂
[deleted]
"I am not in a situation to do sources. So I doubt this will continue to be a productive conversation. But from everything I have seen amazon was profitable after an initial 1 or 2 quarters. I forget which.

Again this is why they never needed additional capital. If they were not profitable for a long time like you say they would have needed to raise more."
It's not different. Free use of Tesla's patents is contingent on them allowing Tesla free use of their own in return. Like I said from the very beginning.
"No. Go read Amazon’s 10Ks. They operated at a substantial loss for most of their first decade. They lost lots of money, and borrowed plenty too. After that they reached a point where their core business was able to run about even, but they continued to pour money into growth. From there they stayed cash flow positive but didn’t report much in the way of profits until relatively recently."
[deleted]
I think you are flipping between net profit and operating with a profitable business model when it is convenient to your argument.
It does. Maybe you should have paid for better lawyers. Cheers.
"Not at all. I think you’re the one who’s confused about that and are linking them, when the whole point of the Amazon comparison is that they are not the same thing."

"And funnily enough - the base model X now is 4.4s 0-60 which also beats what they are showing.  The only thing they compete on is being cheaper, although to get their autopilot equivalent you have to spend at least $80,500 so the difference isn't much to the Model X long range."

Those are always the worst.  Pick the 5 things the jag has or is “better” at than another car.  Don’t list all the bad stuff it’s missing or that you don’t really need CarPlay or android auto in the Tesla.
The stats they include in those flyers is laughable. Before those adverts I still thought Jaguar was a pretty respectable company...
Both Jaguar and Audi think pie size is limited. Instead of increasing the size of the market they are trying to poach Tesla customers. I know that is the point so that they don't lose their ICE sales. But Tesla customers are generally more well informed so they won't fall prey to this idiotic marketing strategy. So only conclusion I can draw is that marketing teams from these companies are morons.

2. Can't go on long trips because it can't charge reliably, so he has to take his X.

3. Think repeatedly posting about how great his jaguar is on the tesla forum is going to sway anyone's mind.

"> The only thing they compete on is being cheaper 

As someone who owns both a Model X and an I-PACE, I would say that the I-PACE wins on handling and interior. It's simply a better driving experience all-around.

I still keep my Model X for most of my road trips because I have free supercharging and because Tesla's supercharging network is more reliable and expansive than Electrify America's (for now). But the I-PACE is my daily driver."

"I wouldn't say that road trips are a ""no-go.""

All Electrify America chargers except the closest charger to SLC (Maverick Chargepoint). At a few of the EA locations, some of the stations were apparently dead-on-arrival when they were first installed, but there is always at least one station that's functioning. I reliably got 80kW at each charging stop.

The last time I drove my Model X between Seattle and SLC, nearly all of the Tesla superchargers were capping out between 50kW and 70kW. Actually, Kennewick was only giving me 42kW, and Superior flat-out failed on me mid-charge. Of course this was a couple of years ago, and I've heard they've gotten better on that front."

Totally disagree on the carplay.  It's leaps beyond teslas infotainment capability.
"Ah, interesting. People don't *really* like AA/Carplay. They're just doing their preferences wrong. They are wrong to prefer it. Wise Tesla."
"As someone who owns an I-PACE and a Model X, I find that I use the heck out of Android Auto in the I-PACE. I don't hit any buttons or anything; I simply call out, ""Hey Google... (insert random command or query)"" and it takes care of that for me. Navigation, audio books, music playlists, phone calls, etc. Whatever I do on my phone I can just keep doing, except it's extended into the car's microphone/sound system/display. It's actually a really cool experience that Google totally nailed."
"I would actually argue that carplay and Android auto should qualify as distracted driving based on what I've seen from people that have it.

There should be zero interaction with your phone at all other than starting music before you begin and perhaps taking incoming calls. That's it."
What's funny is RAM and ford are looking into building all electric versions of pick ups because they know if they can get the range right and not have them catch on fire.  A lot of farmers would want them.

"I'm guessing someone who knows you have a Tesla (insurance, bank, etc.) just sells the data to a broker, who then collects and categorizes it, and then sells it to Jaguar.

If you have a gmail address, you can actually use custom email addresses everywhere, just use youraddresshere+whatever@gmail.com, it's equivalent to youraddresshere@gmail.com, but when you get the email you'll be able to see which address they sent it to. This can be used to track who sold you out, for example if you get insurance, just use youraddresshere+insurance.company.name@gmail.com to register. (It also helps to have a password manager save all of this in case you forget which email address you used where, but you should be using a password manager anyway for security reasons.)

Also, in a few cases they actually block the `+` character from an email address. You can still mark it, because gmail ignores dots in the address, your.address.here@gmail.com is the same as youraddresshere@gmail.com. You can give them a unique dot pattern, such as y.o.uradd.res..she.re@gmail.com and then just note who got which pattern in the same password manager. They can't block dots from email addresses, since other providers often require them in that part of the address."
What are you on about? Tesla can hardly compete
">Jaguar and Audi haven't proven themselves, either.

One thing we do know about the I-PACE (because their engineering team has come out and said it publicly) is that they're only allowing their battery packs to be charged to some fraction of their theoretical capacity. In addition, the I-PACE is limiting its accepted charge rate to a super-conservative 80kW. Coupled with their thermal management systems, it would be a real surprise if the I-PACE battery pack experienced degradation at a rate any worse than Tesla's battery packs."
Plot twist : He's trying to sell his I-Pace 😁
"> I don't see him posting on the ipace jaguar forums, so I guess we know which car he actually likes more.

I was going to say he’s just excited to justify his purchase vs a Tesla, but your last statement makes me suspicious."
"I don’t own an X or an I-Pace, but I’ve driven both. I find it unlikely that anyone would seriously cross-shop the two. I find it much more natural to compare the I-Pace to the S, because in reality it’s not an SUV, but a fastback on stilts with huge tires and plastic cladding. 

The Jag definitely was a nice place to be though, although the MMI is finicky and slow, it does have good controls for the seats and climate. It also was a very nice compromise between sporty and luxurious, in my opinion at least. 

I ended up ordering a model 3, because of price vs. range and other stuff, but if I didn’t care about software updates (I’m a developer), self-driving (often stuck in Oslo traffic), range and charging speed (I do long drives regularly, and plan to do more when refueling suddenly becomes > 50% off (up to 90% on some drives)) I would definitely have considered getting an I-Pace. 

Honestly think it would be a perfect car for my parents; lots of country roads, doesn’t even trust or use cruise control, almost perfectly happy with the range of their Nissan Leaf, but would like something a bit larger and with a tow bar. However, I think the EQC will be hard to beat though. Lots of equipment for the price, and 1800kg towing capacity instead of 750 (model 3 has 910, X has 2200), but I bet that it will put early I-Paces at a good price point in a year or two."
"This guy cracks me up because someone near where I live owns an I-Pace, and I had a couple of chats with them about it.

While they don't regret getting the I-Pace over another ICE car, they regret not getting a Tesla."
Some people have too much time to waste on things they don't like

>Brag about how their smaller ipace (compared to the X by size and cargo room) is more inefficient. 

Do you mean, more efficient rather than inefficient? As a daily driver, it ends up requiring less energy. But it's such a small difference that it really doesn't matter. The main point is that any claim that the I-PACE is \*significantly\* off-base from the pre-refresh Model X efficiency is just plain wrong. They're really neck-at-neck.

>Can't go on long trips because it can't charge reliably, so he has to take his X. 

I don't think I've said that either. I have no trouble charging at the Electrify America locations on my road trips, although it is true that at some locations, some of the stations aren't working right yet. But it's not so bad that I can't rely on the EA locations at all.

So far the worst road trip experience I've ever had was in my Model X with the Tesla supercharger network.

>Think repeatedly posting about how great his jaguar is on the tesla forum is going to sway anyone's mind. 

Even if that were my intention, perhaps you might want to take a long while to really reflect on this thought."
Not even close.  It's utter trash and no OTA
"the i-Pace is more of a CAV IMHO.  It's closer to Model Y in size than Model X.  That wheels out design also has drawbacks, I was shocked to find that the cargo area in the back is flat, no area behind the rear axle for additional cargo space."
"Totally agree. The I-Pace wins by a huge margin in the looks department. It is a nice drive too; a friend bought one just before summer. I like it a lot.

The interior might appeal more to those traditionally liking interiors in the vein of Mercedes, BMWs and such than to the ""everything should look like an ipad and physical knobs are stupid""-crowd. Personally I like not having to fumble around on the screen for most anything I want to adjust."
"I love the idea of someone spending over $150,000 on two vehicles and being ""too cheap"" to drive one of them because ""my charges aren't free on this one""."
How does the I pace's version of auto pilot compare to Tesla's?
"maybe you could post a picture with both, your iPace and your model X?"
Model X is a bigger vehicle. It’s common sense. I disagree about interior and it’s subjective.
"I find the I-PACE interior so tacky, but maybe Ive just gotten used to minimalism"
"Do you have the new current/new adaptive suspension in the Model X? I'm curious if it's still the case, on the handling."
"I tried to charge our M3D At a new Electrify America charging station and after 20 minutes of messing with the stupid payment system I gave up. None of them would accept by credit cards (and they have installed literally the worst card readers in history... you have to almost crawl on the ground to see where you’re supposed to insert the chip), Apple Pay wasn’t accepted by the readers (it worked on my phone but not their stupid machine), and I even tried getting their app to work but too couldn’t communicate with the chargers. Not to mention you have to unplug and plug back in the charger to the car every time the payment system fails for the machine to restart. It’s awful.  All I was trying to do was just test them to see how they worked, but after that experience I don’t see how they’ll ever compete with Tesla Superchargers or even ChargePoint."
iPace is stunning car. Bjorn reviewed the car vs a model x and it had 10% less range than the model x
Do you get torque steer on the I-PACE?  I only drove one around the block but the torque steer was surprising to me.

"Dr. Mark White, former lead engineer at JLR, came to our office and we had a panel discussion with Laurent Chappui formerly from Ford about the iPace and other cars. 

He was pretty proud of the engineering of the IPace. It uses the same batteries and drivetrain from LG Chem as the Audi Etron but weighs about 700 lbs less due to the all aluminum construction. The etron is also based on an existing platform. Jaguar was able to get about 15% better EPA range, acceleration and handling. iPace was the last car he oversaw as lead engineer at JLR. 

My impression from the discussion was that everyone is behind Tesla in motor efficiency, aero, lightweighting and energy density of the battery packs.  I think everyone else is using LG Chem or Samsung SDI pouch style batteries and the whole industry has supply problems."
[deleted]
"Erm Jaguard Land Rover is going in on EVs. Not at Tesla's speed but they got a government loan guarantee of £500m to develop EVs and make them at Castle Bromwich in Birmingham. 

There is talks into making Jaguar an EV only brand so they can still sell the popular Range Rovers because they will have a low CO2 fleet average then."
"Or they just don't have the sheer amount of batteries Tesla does and if they made electric cars that were actually competitive they would be battery constrained quicker than they could say ""production hell"". Making their cars shitty enough and overpricing the rest of the appeal out of them is a nice way of avoiding supply issues."
"This is interesting, thanks for sharing. My wife will be due for a new car in a few years, and I think she would like an I Pace probably more than our model 3/Y. If the charging situation improves, I think it would work.

Here in the northeast, road trips a breeze with superchargers. It’s hard to imagine giving that up at this point."
"Yea, as stated I-pace starts at double the price of SR+."
For the price and battery size though? iPace is disappointing for sure.
Yeah but SR get tons more dc (supercharger) sites.
For the price.
"You're trying to take offense from something that is not directed at saying the SR+ is bad. The size of the battery of I-Pace is much larger and the car costs twice as much as the SR+. It should not have the SAME estimated range. 

Nobody here is saying the SR+ is bad,  they are comparing everything fairly. Stop trying to take offense for no reason. Their statement was not that the range in of itself is bad. They are saying with all things considered, the range that the car offers is bad."
Interesting. Why do you say this?
"I don't know about leaps and bounds, but I will say that the lack of Carplay/Android Auto is the main thing that I dislike about Tesla. But it was just added to the pile of pros/cons in my decision that ultimately ended in ordering a Model 3."
"i just want music browsing from the display and direct navigation mirroring from my phone. although i don’t care as much about maps mirroring as much as i want music browsing. i get the lack of autopilot with apple maps but music is important for me and has no conflicts. i also especially like the look of iOS 13 carplay, it’s pretty neat."
I don’t think it is necessary. Would much rather use maps and podcasts from Tesla.  I agree currently music from your phone is better but won’t be for long.  Since they keep updating it.
"I don't know about Carplay, but Android Auto has been a disappointment. After six years driving Teslas, just rented a car with AA and connected it to my phone. Other than a better music player, I found it terribly subpar compared to my Tesla (and that is not even counting the screen size).

Edit: fixed two autocorrect horrors."
Thank goodness tesla does not have car play and it’s so funny that jagaur has this as a comparison point. They got this backwards.
Good news is Tesla is expanding all that functionality
Right now I'm renting a RAV-4 with CarPlay while my Model 3 is in for repairs.  I can say that CarPlay (at least in the RAV-4) requires WAY more interaction and should be considered a negative for Jaguar.
"I think you're unaware of how AA and CP work. You plug your phone in when you start driving and never touch them again. Hell most things on AA/CP can be done without ever taking your hands off the wheel. If that counts as distracted driving, so does using your Model 3's display."
"I mean they are like ""Our Jaguar have it and the Tesla doesn't even have this feature"" but Tesla have a way better interface"
That's what it most likely is. He made a purchase without considering how important a Supercharger network is.
"I owned exclusively Chevy vehicles prior to getting a Model 3 and I've never once posted on a Chevy forum or subreddit. It could be that the Jaguar community on Reddit isn't well known to its drivers or doesn't have enough interesting content to stay active. Tesla gets an online community because there's growing interest in EVs and Tesla is at the forefront. I don't imagine Jaguar or most other established luxury brands are really stirring up extra interest online. What are Jaguar owners going to talk about? Quarterly revenue meeting the status quo?

I'm not rich enough to consider buying cars like a Model X or Jaguar, but I've heard from numerous sources that Tesla's interiors don't stand up to the interiors of long-standing luxury brands, and the two many points that guy is making is (1) the Jaguar's interior is better and offers a better overall driving experience, and (2) the Tesla supercharging network is better.

Both of those statements are congruent with what I've heard countless times over the years. I think you people are just being overly sensitive about someone who dares to own an EV besides a Tesla. It's just a guy who owns two nice cars from different manufacturers who's offering his opinion on them.

If I could own a second EV it'd be a Bolt because I love Chevy and I love that they have an EV priced around $40,000 that has a range of 230 miles. Does it make me a bad person that I'd shill for Chevy just because I'm excited they have a comparable EV? If there was a thread in this sub about a comparison to Bolts and I actually owned one, would it make me evil for posting my own opinion based on my own experiences with the Bolt and Model 3?"
X isn't an SUV it is a mini van. Your right that the comparison with the ipace also doesn't make sens

"When you spread yourself that thin, you gotta save where you can...lol"
"The I-PACE has standard adaptive cruise control along with lane-keep assist for emergency correction on inadvertent lane departure. Personally I rarely use it, but I also prefer not to use Autopilot features on my Model X.

\*Edit: Whoa. Somehow saying that you prefer to control your car yourself rather than use Autopilot seems to be a downvote magnet on /r/teslamotors! In practice, the feature hasn't earned my confidence."
"...If they had one. JLR’s driver assistance features aren’t nearly as advanced as Tesla‘s. In reality, only Cadillac‘s SuperCruise is supposedly on the level of Tesla’s autopilot/FSD."
"Considering he spends all his time in the Tesla subreddit talking about his Ipace, I'll be a little sceptical of his claims"
"> I disagree about interior and it’s subjective.

That it is. If you like chic minimalism, Tesla will do it for you. If you prefer real wood, beautiful metalwork, and soft quality leather, along with knobs and buttons for the common things you do, then the I-PACE will be more of your car.

"Ya, interior looks old to me"
Torque steer? You can’t be serious.
Probably more to show their point of view rather than brag. If they have both cars it gives their opinion some more merit when it is involving either of those cars.
Americans love mini vans it will be around.
I had no Idea you were a fellow print guy.  Still keeping that alive or solely wrapping things at this point?
Or the DMV.
"Better than getting it as phone calls, as I do...."
"> last car he oversaw as lead engineer at JLR.

Another major reason is the integration of the circuitry."
"Uh, the model 3 uses permanent magnet motors..."
"This is one of the big reasons for I-PACE's higher energy utilization at freeway speeds. When driving at slower speeds (i.e., 45mph), I-PACE has higher efficiency than the pre-refresh Model X, partly because if its lower curb weight."

"cant speak for him but I know for me, I never had a car that had carplay so getting into my Model 3 was so nice as it just plays the music/podcast when I get into my car so seamlessly without me having to even take out my phone and fiddle with getting it connected to the car through a usb port or smthin like my old cars required. even for my old cars with Bluetooth, I had so select my phone from the car's infotainment every time so it was a bit annoying to start"
Probably never used more than 10% of AA/CP capability.
[deleted]
"Maps, yes. The rest, no (_especially_ podcasts, since I want the playback position to sync back to my phone).

But it's not like supporting CP/AA would have to stop the current stuff from working, and there's enough constant low-level grumbling about it not being an option to make a reasonable argument they should add it."
"Tesla podcast support is a joke compared to tools like overcast.   

Maps - do you really think having no ability to set stops or choose an alternate route is superior to what's available of google maps or waze today?"
CarPlay would help tons with navigation... Tesla’s offering is rather subpar at the moment.
Yes it’s not necessary.
[deleted]
How would having carplay make the car worse?   You aren't required to use it.
"You need to try carplay on IOS 13, its much better. All functions can be used independently between phone and CAR."
"thats the thing that annoyed me about my old cars in the first place...having to take out my phone and plug it in for it to get anything started. i personally prefer just getting in the car and having everything seamlessly start so i can focus on driving 

but i can see why people would find carplay useful if they need to respond to texts or use their preferred maps or whatever but so far the things i need while driving, my model 3 seems to integrate it all nicely for me already"
"We have a mini van. we have an S and want to swap the mini van for an X. We are having a hard time making the switch.  You can’t seat 7 and carry luggage (not great for airport trips to pick up the grand parents). Also not great for ikea trips.  But the X would be amazing for road trips. Right now we take the S over the minivan for road trips.  

Such a hard decision for us."
Most SUV’s in Europe is just taller hatchbacks or wagons on stilts too. It’s a very muddled term.
"

The i pace was designed when Tesla had their old motors. Sure technology advances but to get salty and make a comparison to a 1950s car is crazy.

Don’t think anyone is saying that the i pace being comparable to old model x motors means they are still equal now. 

But it’s funny how just a little while ago the model x had “great efficiency” and now the the i pace is comparable to it and the new motors are a bit better then the old ones that efficiency is literally unusable and embarrassing.

If the old model x efficiency was not unusable how is the i pace that bad?"
Why would you not want to use autopilot? It’s arguably the best feature on Teslas.
Maybe he could show us a picture of his paycheck from Jaguar at least?
"""It's made from real bits of panther, so you know it's good..."""
Knobs and  buttons are thing of past. Soft quality leather? Do you know why tesla is getting rid of real leather in their cars?

Honestly, I think that not only do most of us not care about that stuff, we’re actually trying to get away from most of it. But I think the more EV choice the merrier! Kudos to Jag for having a real product and working on the whole picture (cough, charging network, cough)."

You have a source for that statement?
Lower curb weight giving more efficiency at the cost of lower range. That's not a good thing. That's just how the physics work out.
"The I-pace's battery is *80% larger* than the SR+, yet it gets less range. That's flat out terrible."
"True.  

My Audi had a hard drive, SD slots, DVD player, Bluetooth, and I put in a great mount for my phone (7.2"" screen) and  even with AA etc it was always such a ballache in day to day use I just wouldn't bother loading up songs etc. 

Tesla may be inferior but it just WORKS without me connecting anything."
AA in my VW is only ever used to actually throw my GPS when needed up onto the screen. It's never used otherwise.
"Audible, better audio directions from Apple or Google maps, any other apps that you might want to not wait for Tesla to implement?"
"> Once we get native Spotify, what else do you prefer?

Apple Music for music.  
Overcast for podcasts.  
Apple Maps for road trip maps.  
Waze for commute maps.  
Messages.  

In general, all the apps on my phone that have obvious use in the car have CarPlay components, and the experience of using them natively on the big screen in the car is immensely better than using them any other way, and better than Tesla's built-ins.

We rented a Chrysler Pacifica on a recent trip.  
A god damned Chrysler Pacifica.

And it had CarPlay, and the in-car experience of doing anything besides driving was better that our Tesla at home."
"In my rotation everyday that I use via carplay on my commute:

Audible

Libby

Overcast

Apple music

Sirius xm

Waze

Google maps

Zoom (work conference call meetings via audio)"
That will pretty much do it for me.
"I hate hate hate how every time Carplay/AA come up people talk about it like it just fundamentally HAS to be an either/or proposition. 

""You have to use tesla's maps to get SC charger integration"". - OK, fine. 

""You have to use tesla nav for NOA, that wouldn't work if navigating within Android auto"" - Ok, fine. 

We don't want all those things all the time, and can make decisions about how to use things based on what's more important when. Also, for the love of christ, nav isn't all those things do anyway."
"No one said that aspect is superior, but if I compare the end result it is a no contest. The faster UI, massive larger screen and integrated route planning make it far superior to AA.
The only thing I think it has in Tesla is music/podcasts. But even then I would not even consider going to Android Auto, the end user experience is just better with the Tesla UI, including its limitations."
"Cos carplay knows your SOC and routes thru superchargers so well, right?"

Yeah we have a 3 and a minivan. I really want the Y to swap for the minivan but there just be enough room to seat four people and haul a lot of stuff. We could look at an X but that’s a lot of scratch. Minivans suck except for hauling people with a lot of stuff.

"Autopilot is very much ymmv.  Some routes it's perfect, others it is downright dangerous.  Phantom breaking, hugging lane dividers, freaking out over oddly sized lanes when freeway lanes merge or split off.  When you have to manually take over, and jerk the wheel, it's also scary the cruise control is still enabled too.

Autopilot often drives too slow on my regular commute route too.  It will go exactly the speed limit (maximum speed, can't make it go faster) in some zones, while everyone around me is going 10-15 over.  So I can totally see some people never or rarely using it.  It's not really automated driving, it's cruise control with lane keeping and extra restrictions.

When I'm not in a hurry to get home or go to work, I use autopilot.  When I don't want to dick around, I manually drive or use cruise control."
"If a car handles that well, driving it is actually fun."
">Why would you not want to use autopilot? 

I've had it do too many scary things on the freeway. At this point I feel more comfortable relying on my own judgement rather than allowing myself to lulled into complacency with the car's automatic systems."
"You can ""shut down"" switched reluctance motors (aka permanent magnet motors) just fine too. In fact if you don't pull a load on them they spin freely for the most part. It's only when you have somewhere to dump the power that it will start generating power and slowing it down.

The reason they shut down or reduce power to the front motor at all is because induction motors are less efficient in general. If they used SWEs for both motors it would be MORE efficient than the split setup they have.

In fact the reason the model S and X refresh was able to increase efficiency was literally due to moving to the switched reluctance tech from the model 3. Their biggest issues are torque ripple and smooth operation at lower speeds, but somehow Tesla seems to have solved that using some kind of black magic that I'd be really interested to see!"

That’s the culty fans responding. You’re not allowed to mention someone else doing something better. Goes for any product subreddit or forum not just Tesla.
"why not both? most car manufacturers that include CP/AA also have an inbuilt navigation suite (which includes charging points on the map - see hyundai, nissan, etc)"
Which for me is something I've never ever needed.
"Those are features that I don’t need. I need an “avoid highway” feature, which it doesn’t have. Also, I’m not sure which part of the country you live in, but the tesla navigation often screws up where I live when there are multiple on / off ramps, telling you the actual one you should be on only seconds prior to the window closing, or, in some situations where the exit lanes are long, only after the dividers become solid lines."

"hmm I see, didn't know that :O

what other wireless standards can replace Bluetooth if it's legacy now? most of the ppl I know who have carplay tell me they still plug it in and my lazy ass cant be bothered to do that every single time haha"
Slippery slope fallacy? Sure......
Hrm.... I can set my autopilot to whatever speed I want. You just rotate the dial on the right to the speed you want and you're good to go.
I just did a 600-mile round-trip in a Performance 3 with roughly 550 miles on Autopilot. This is where Autopilot shines. There's no fun to be had with handling on a straight interstate highway or while stuck in traffic.
"depends on the drive. Traffic? not fun. straight boring highway not fun, 70% driving = not fun. Not doing that 70% makes that 30% so much more enjoyable."
I said better audio directions. The Tesla voice is terrible compared to Google’s and Siri.
"> You can use Waze in the Tesla today.

Are you talking about the Tesla Waze thing in the browser?  
That is...  a terrible replacement for the native Waze app.

> You honestly think Apple maps are better than the Tesla maps?

Where I drive, the map data is unequivocally equivalent or better.  
But regardless of that, the user experience of the app and presentations of the maps are DEFINITELY more enjoyable for me than the terribly slow tiling in and laggy rotation of the Tesla maps."
"Sure. 

It's about an hour each way with stop and go traffic. Sometimes one nav app will have a more creative route that's faster (San Francisco from the south).

"On highways. If a road is not marked as a highway in its maps (I’ve seen this happen in the middle of a newly built section of an actual highway), it enforces the speed limit... or what it *thinks* is the limit, which is worse."
"Every road has a maximum speed setting for autopilot.  On many highways, it's 80+ so you never notice it.  On the highway I drive on, it's 60mph for most of the route, and occasionally drops down to 55, then back to 60."
Exactly.
what is the difference between driving with or without autopilot on a boring straight interstate. I don't get it autopilot makes it even more boring for me. Are you on social media all the time then?
[deleted]
"Unless you're switching between all these via voice control then yes it is different, because every car made in the last 20 years lets you switch stations from the steering wheel without taking your eyes off the road. But then again if you're just using voice control it makes no difference if you're listening to an audiobook via USB (Android Auto) or Bluetooth (any other car)."
"No I don't.   That is why the first words of my response are

>which for me"
"First off, why do you speak for everyone then?

Second, it's not like adding the nav features from carplay/AA would take away those features... I'll never get why people resist additions because of features they use that would be totally unaffected by said additions... If you hate it that much, you could simply not use it *and your car experience would be the same* but you advocate against it because ""well I don't use it therefore I don't want it!""...

Basically, if your only complaint is that carplay/AA nav doesn't have the two features Tesla's nav does, but you'd still be able to use Tesla's nav with AA/carplay, than you have no complaints and just don't wanna see anything change lol"
"I think you're describing what I think of as it disabling autopilot and just doing the lane following thing, which it won't do over 40 mph no matter what the speed limit on the road is... or maybe my car's software is just different?"
But you can adjust that...
Is that a serious question? Have you ever taken a 12 hour road trip? It would take away so much of the fatigue. Plus it’s safer.
"The difference is that when most people get behind the wheel, the fatigue of driving sets in quickly. I always, *always* start to get drowsy on my afternoon commute home. When I'm a passenger, not so much. I would love to just sit and watch the car drive and give a correction or two when needed"
"Being in an attentive supervisory role is significantly less fatiguing than traditional driving. It’s physically tangible and amazing. 

This approximately 6+ hour drive (each way), felt more comparable to a 2 hour drive in the competition. There’s no comparison."
"Yup, one of the very first X100Ds. Tegra console.

Even after we get the promised upgrade, I'll STILL prefer Apple Maps because the user interface actually makes sense and doesn't infuriate me. 👍

All of the other listed reasons are much more critical for wanting CarPlay, though, as I rarely use the maps at all outside of Waze during bad commute times."
"he said it’s stop and go traffic, i don’t think it’s really that big of a deal to tap a few things on the touch screen to switch apps when you’re stopped on the freeway"
"You are not listening...  You cannot adjust the autopilot maximum speed setting for a particular highway.

There is an absolute maximum setting for autopilot for each road.  It's usually very high, so you won't reach it normally.  On some roads, it is very low, like on the road I drive on.  You cannot adjust it, once you reach the maximum speed, you cannot make autopilot go faster unless you decide to start pressing the gas (go?) pedal.  It's not a user configurable setting, you can scroll up on the steering wheel control all you want, autopilot will not go faster.  You can raise the autopilot speed setting in the menu options all you want, you cannot exceed that absolute maximum limit hard coded into autopilot for each road."
"I've had adaptive cruise control in my cars since 2013. I use that every so often, and it's great. I'd say it reduces that cognitive load of driving by something like 80%. However because of really scary things Tesla Autopilot has done with respect to steering my car at freeway speeds, I don't feel comfortable trusting it and prefer steering the car myself. Sometimes I'll disable even the adaptive cruise control feature when I sense that a phantom brake would be especially dangerous given the conditions."
"He's probably one of those ""if you take your eyes off the road for even 1 second regardless of context you're an asshole and you're gonna crash!!"" As if context doesn't matter and looking down at your screen for 10 seconds in bumper to bumper traffic is super dangerous..."
"It might not be a big deal but it's still a lie to call it ""no different than changing radio presets."" And I still have to doubt anyone who claims:

1. they're switching between 2 audiobook apps, 2 map apps, and 3 music/podcast apps, with conference calls in between, all in an hour-long commute without being a traffic hazard

2. they're even switching between that many things at all. How many different audiobooks do *you* listen to in an hour-long commute when you aren't on your morning conference call?"
"Either you are trying to go way above the speed that a road is rated for, or you should ping tesla to update their mapping for the road class because it’s limiting you when it shouldn’t be. 

Doesn’t sound like a normal problem/concern."
"I'm listening, but you didn't provide this detail before. I guess I've never experienced this problem."
"In Europe we have noticed this for roads with one lane in each direction and no lane dividers except for the line in the middle. If it’s a physical barrier between it will go faster. This usually means two lanes in each direction too. I think the fastest it would drive on autopilot was 130 km/h but then they increased it to 150 km/h last summer if I remember correctly. This was an okay speed on autobahn in Germany and no need to AP on anything higher. 

I get why you find it annoying that they won’t go higher on certain roads if those are a big part of your daily commute. Personally I never have the issue except for a few times a year when visiting family."
I’ve set autopilot/CC to 85mph on 70mph roads. Only on very few roads have I ever seen it restrict speed and it’s usually where it doesn’t know speed limit so it defaults to 45mph IF YOU TURN ON AUTOSTEER. Maybe you have an absolute limit set on your offset.
Great video! And nice to see that his first instinct was to be respectful of a stranger's car ;)
Wow! This is such a great video. I was grinning the whole time.
This is why I hodl my tesla stock
If Tesla lasts until these kids get enough money to buy their own Tesla... The competition is fucked. Kids love Tesla. It's incredible.
"Love it!  Really cool you got this on video.  My 5&8 year old are in love with my M3 too, they have never really been excited about cars until now.  Love riding in it (and the games of course!)"
"Cool video, kids have the best and most pure reactions. Thanks for sharing!"
Immediately asks about the games.  😊
Too cute!!! ❤️
Gotta love some wholesome content!
"Great job, great uncle and Aunt!

And bonus points for the same White/White/Aero SR+ I have! 😜"
Can someone pick me up at work with a Tesla?
What a great video! I was smiling and laughing the whole time.
Amazing. As a die hard tesla fan myself its awesome to see someone so young this enthusiatic about them.
"Idk how or where kids learn about Teslas (especially since there aren’t any Tesla ads), but I’ve noticed that kids love them, while adults can get fixated on the FUD. Great video! Should send this to Tesla’s social media account, maybe they’ll post it!"
Awesome video!
"That is an observant little man right there, he’ll go far in life!"
Picked up my 7 year old daughter from school today to surprise her and she was so excited to get Tesla’d.  She lives it as much as I do (almost).
this is the cutest video ever!!!! i love his hair also
"My 9 year old loves my car, but she's more obsessed with Roblox and video chatting with her friends after school.

My 3 year old however...

Well, I'm the coolest dad EVER. He tells everyone he meets how awesome ""Sharky"" the Tesla (my blue Model 3 SR+) is. He named it too, but that's cool I'm a San Jose Sharks fan anyway so I'll take it.

Props to the whole family, that kid was super respectful. I think my kids would react similarly, but it's pretty cool to see. Restores a little faith in the future of humanity."
Wow! This genuinely put me in a fantastic mood! Seems like such a great kid!
okay but where's the rest of the video... when you step on it? 😊
Super cute
Cool vid though it really doesn’t look like that door lines up properly which may have contributed to the problems closing it.
Such a cute kid. That look of realisation on his face is priceless
You guys are awesome parents! ❤️
"Thanks for sharing, this made me smile all the way through the video"
Priceless!!
This is great!
This was awesome.
this is amazing- made my day
This was sort of painful to watch. I could feel that kids anxiety over doing something wrong and being goaded on by adults
I heard your nephew was about to say wt.....f. And that’s big no no.
"Ha! Love it. My 8 yr old nephew ran into my garage because he knew I got a Tesla. Looked at the 3, scrunched up his face and said “oh it doesn’t have the cool doors” and walked back into the house 😂"
Ugh. Love the crap outta this :-)
"What a beautiful little guy! Thanks for sharing!

Reminds me of my boys when they were young.

🥰✌🏻👍🏻🏎"
Mind. Blown.
"Reminds me of this one - How everyone should react when a Model 3 arrives

https://youtu.be/lnxGIkTaGyg"
Its curious to see how EVERY SINGLE new tesla owner will miscalculate the force needed to close the doors.
"6 is a good age for being a fanboy, not like the alleged adults who are total fanboys"
If he’s a Tesla fan boy then why would you surprise him with a BMW
It says a lot about his family. Good job guys.
"Me too, and I don't even like kids!"
“The future is now old man!”
So true. My friend's very young daughter new more about Teslas when I gave them a ride than he and his wife did because of a YouTube channel she watches with a family that owns one.
my boyfriends best friends daughter (lol) is like 6 and absolutely loves the cars. she said that’s her dream car and it makes so enthusiastic for the future.. so many kids love them!
"My nephews 5 and 7 had similar reactions when I showed them my 3. They couldn't stop oohing and aahing. The best part was engaging the ""fart mode."" They kept making me repeat it and couldn't stop laughing! I never felt happier about a car."
I thought the opposite. I thought it was great that the kid was so respectful of a car that wasn’t his. He even said “I don’t want to get someone’s new car dirty”. Good kid and I think he understood at the end why they goaded him into it.
Yeah I thought they played it out a bit too long. Kid probably thought some stranger accidentally left their car open and his uncle was doing increasingly invasive things to it lol.
Yeah i felt the same!
"Poor attempt to say ""please stop calling Model 3 M3""."
"Yes, it’s a good thing that the kid wasn’t a shit head to someone else’s property. I still don’t like it when adults manipulate kids to get reactions from them like they are toys 🤷🏻‍♀️. Why stress him out for amusement? He would have been just as jazzed to have his uncle pic him up from school in his dream car.  It’s not a huge deal here, I just fail to see the magic in it"
"The kid seemed to understand instantly when his uncle opened the trunk that his uncle was messing with his own car the whole time.

He seemed really bright and respectful. He'll be fine."
"I kind of agree with you now, after rethinking this. I did the same and picked up my nephew from school when I got my Model 3 and he just kept asking where I was parked. When I finally opened the back door to let him in, he had the same reaction the kid did when this guy popped the trunk. This may have been a little too much for the views/karma. It depends on how the kid felt and we probably will never know that. He likely already forgot that part."
I get where you are coming from :)
"That kid doesn't give a damn about being goaded into it. He's just stoked he got to take a ride in a Tesla.

The holier than thou attitude that some people have toward good natured ribbing of kids is asinine. You're not hurting them, and the end result is they're *happy*. If the end result is anything other than happiness I've got an issue with that type of behavior, but if you're making a kid happy wtf is the issue here?"
The only way to properly use the frunk.
Now wrap it to match the hair!

Am I the only one that usually puts pizza in the frunk?
So fast that all the toppings disappeared?
Someone tweet at Elon that we need a “Pizza Mode” where the passenger seat actively levels itself and braces the pizza during accelerations and decelerations.
Looks a little well done to me.
Veteran owners know to always turn on Chill mode as soon as you load something in your trunk :P
Chill Mode
Did that the other day with a take and bake pizza. At least I was able to move it all back around before I cooked it. My wife had a good laugh at me.
That's  a really nice looking pizza.
"What state is this, mate?"
From the shape of the pizza I’m assuming you have the Performance Options
Nice
This is amazing 🤣
Looks perfectly baked to me!
"You supposed to drive your car, not bake your pizza with it."
Roll up a towel and put at the front to level the pizza.
I also recently got a dairy cheese pizza... should have gone with the vegan option.  We shall learn.
"All smelly objects such as food and diapers should go in the frunk because it’s not connected to the air and keeps the smells out of the car. 

Beware if you pop the frunk from in the car when the AC is going it will suck some of that food smell which was just released, into the car. I always get out first and close the door then pop the frunk"
"No, I usually put food with strong odors in the frunk."
It’s literally the pizza frunk
No...
"I put mine in there, but there's never anyone around to see it.

Picked some up tonight, and there was a police officer inside! Did he see?  Nope.

That was gonna be a fun one."
I feel like the frunk is the right angle for Tesla-acceleration. #pizzamode. Just don’t slam on brakes :)
No but you're one of many Model 3 owners that think they are the first and only to have discovered this.
And what kind of psychopath pizza shop owner doesn’t slice it?!?!
"It is a simple pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni are under the cheese. It looks a little burned from the picture, but it was definitely an above average tasting pizza."
And turns on the seat heater to keep the pizza warm! Nobody ever thinks of that!!
I find that the floorboard on the front passenger is level enough to hold the pizza flat and level
"*Calzone mode
FTFY"
"Yeah, it's perfect"
"Never chill mode, even when granny’s in the car."
"It seems unintuitive to chill a pizza but it’s the right move.

Also go someplace else that doesn’t burn pizzas."
"Looks burnt, or dead"
"It happened in Quebec city, Canada. Responding to other comments: its the result of excellent acceleration. Not gravity, coriolis effect or whatnot. :)"
"Actually, its from a LR AWD. I showed the car for the first time to my brother in law, while going to pickup pizza for the family. I now know those two tasks are incompatible. :)"
"Oh yeah, right, *gravity* is the problem here..."
Whaaaaat?
I keep a big storage box in the frunk too so the food won’t spill (& if it spills it doesn’t get on frunk mat).
https://youtu.be/ze8lMqbli64?t=29
"In Italy, pizzas come unsliced."
I always did this in my ICE car.  Especially if it’s winter.  I haven’t picked up a pizza in the Tesla yet though.
...and automatically plays “That’s Amore!” by Dean Martin.
Best use of the seat warmer.
"When Granny's in the car, we go Track Mode"
I think it was supercharged
It’s not burnt. It’s over-caramelized
Inertia is the problem here
"Mr. Musk, I don't feel so good...."
It's from the Tesla DC Universe.
"Elon would appreciate this picture. He has a ""thing"" for pics that expose light vs dark contrast."
Absolutely stunning!
This is an awesome photo. Can I have a high-res copy for my phone wallpaper?
Beauty
Great shot
Angel out of darkness!

I'm now starting a business doing glamour shots for Teslas!
Nice shot!
This particular pic gives it a reptilian vibe.
Great shot!

"Name it ""Luna"", on second thought don't because that's a stupid name for a car"
Your hood on the left side is not spaced properly.
Tesla is AC
Really ? How can you tell ?
...pretty sure it's just the shadow
Pretty noticeable. The bumper will have the be realigned.
I think it’s hard to say for sure in this light. Sometimes with uneven lighting can make it look a certain way
I sent you a pm.
How about another FLIR pic of the bottom of your car and perhaps under the back seat.
Neat!  Do some more while it's supercharging please!
[deleted]
Mine always feels pretty warm to the to the touch with UMC at 32A. Was worried it was too warm but I guess it seems about right. HPWC probably has a larger gauge cable to handle higher currents too so I bet the UMC cable gets even warmer.
Took me longer than it should have to realize that was the charging cable.  The curve was so smooth that my brain kept insisting it had to be some sort of weird accenting.
"Good information, just had a 14-50 installed in the garage this morning. Still no word on delivery,  M3 LR Awd ordered on 8/10."
"Mine never gets warm from charging, just normal warmth of a black item in the sun."
Cooooooool! 😃
"Might be able to, ive peeked under the seat and its all shiny metal enclosed electronics which likes to scatter IR"
Can do
I sometimes keep my hand wrapped around the supercharger cord at night and just feel it getting warm.
"Charging at home, 240V 40A via HPWC. Had a couple hours left on the countdown headed towards 90% charge"
I could repeat with the UMC as a comparison
It's funny you guys both posted this today (image and comment) because my cable was all twisted up and I noticed every part of it seemed warm to the touch.
The 14-50 adapter is not included with delivery anymore I think fyi
"Yea its only a couple of degrees above ambient, just a neat picture"
Oh please do!!
"You are correct, I did order an adapter already. Should be here Tuesday. Thanks."
This is correct. It also took 3 weeks for me to get the adapter after ordering. Just got it yesterday. YMMV
"Oooo - just noticed it is 81, not 181.  I thought there was something wrong with your cable!"
Based on the color that would also make it a very hot floor to walk on!
"I dunno if this has been posted here before, I haven't seen it but thought it was pretty funny and wanted to share!"
Is that hamster hopped up on a 5-hour energy drink?
Genius!
Is hamster mode on? I worry for its safety in that trunk...
The white on white is so slick! That’s what I’m going to order when I’m able to. Enjoy!
"I ordered and picked up same day on March 31st, 2019."
I admire a man who wears pants he's clearly outgrown just to save money for a model 3. Welcome to the club sir.
"Congrats!  Same type of thing happened to me.  Ordered and thought it'd be a few weeks, literally the next day I got a call saying the car would be ready by the end of the week!"
White on while is so NICE i think we all know it's the freshest.
"Nice one! I got white on white too, took the front badge off and I have to say it’s a good look for the spaceship."
How many miles were on it?? That’s amazing!
"I ordered on July 26th and still no car. I’m in AZ too so it shouldn’t be a long delivery process...

Not sure what’s going on because my salesperson stopped responding and service center just tells me it isn’t built yet."
"Nice to know they actually try to appease the customers in certain situations. Don’t even let me get started on mine that I ordered about 3-4 weeks ago. Been hearing “it will be delivered tomorrow” for the past week. They can’t even track my car properly. Don’t get me wrong... I still want the car badly, but they need to get their delivery/customer service up to par very soon..."
Love her. Great job man. Congratulations!
"Talk about under promising and over delivering.  😉

Have fun and enjoy.   You'll never look back."
I ordered on 8/5 too for white on white for standard+ but I haven't heard anything yet.  What specs is yours?
"Which 3 did you get? SR+, LR, P?

I wanted the 3P-, but they didn't have the color I wanted.  Ended up ordering the LR last week, I find the P-, asked my sales guy to assign the car to my account and I should have it next week. The wait is killing me."
People who take pictures like this deserve ants in their pants (diagonally)
"I also have white/white and also love the new Ultraboosts ;)

Congrats"
How you liking it so far man?
Sooo lucky!! Ordered mine 7/14 and pick up is 8/21 😭😭😭 longest 6 week ever.
When did you get your VIN?
Same situation here 🙌🏼
Looks like Highland Park
"Good lord I am jealous!

My configuration (similar to yours):

* LR AWD
* White exterior
* 19"" Sport wheels
* White interior
* FSD

Ordered 7/31 from Washington State. Not a peep from Tesla. No VIN yet.

But seriously, congrats! I'm sure mine will be worth the wait. I custom-ordered my last car from Ford (took awhile to find a dealer who would allow this), and it was about 2 months for the delivery."
"I ordered on  23 Jul. Still waiting. But I think most of it is transport time to Europe. 

Getting the white on white too. It looks so slick :)"
You know what’s a stupid name for a car? Luna.
Am glad and overwhelmed that I finally buy my 2019 model 3 ride. Thanks to one of their staff who gave a discount through a coupon🙏🏼...am forever grateful
"Best color and when you see it in person, it’s jaw dropping!"
Wow that’s amazing. Hope you’re enjoying it
I left them in the dry a little too long!  Thanks Doc!
It’s incredible how fast they’re moving now!
Haha!  Absolutely!!
Twins!! I think I might do that next!  Haha
"4!  My paperwork said 50 and I was kinda concerned but in person they said it only has 4. They said something with paperwork that they have to write 50, by law, but I zoned them out bc I was so excited lol"
What specs?  I’d try going above service center to get an actual answer or timeline
Try walking into another “dealership” and see if they can look it up while you’re there to give you a legit answer. What options did you order?
Thank you!!   I’ve never been so attach to anything material like this 🤣
Lol right?  It was a great experience from beginning to end. I can’t wait to do it again! Lol
I sent LR DM. It’s beginning of the quarter so u hear they’re ramping production up for EU but I’m not sure how accurate that is. Keep yourself busy by buying accessories! Lol
I went for the LR AWD since I live in Chi. They tried to upsell me on the P but I just don’t need it.   It’s the worst wait even tho mine was so short lol. I literally was dreaming about it nightly! Lol. Keep yourself busy!
I’ll blame you when my girlfriend starts to scream. I’ll be like itskelvinn’s fault! ;)
Haha thank you. First sneaker head who noticed ;)
I picked it up at 10am and I haven’t been home yet lmao. So enjoying the crap out of it. Driving all around Chicago lol
Start spending money on accessories!  Start looking for angled lightening cables for charging your phone. That will keep you busy lol or you going to go wireless?
"I got the VIN after I scheduled delivery. I called them bc it wasn’t showing on my account.   So what I did was clear my temp internet file, logged in and hit the refresh button on my browser and it showed up!"
Woot woot!!
Good eye!  It sure is. I wanted to pick up in Schaumburg  to check out the new service center but it came so fast that I wasn’t able to change it.
You’re going to have fun with the FSD especially when v10 comes out!  And I’m sure it’s right around the corner. Just keep yourself busy by buying accessories lol
You’re going to enjoy the hell out of it. White is the best!!!
"Cool, I won’t use that name."
What?? I didn’t get a coupon!  Care to explain high level instead of emailing? Lol
You got a discount? Care to explain?
Can you dm me with it?
It's hard to believe that they chose the white as the base color given how good it looks and was worth the premium they were charging
"Dude, it’s beyond amazing.  Car took me to work this morning!"
https://i.imgur.com/KRpG9LK.jpg the cheapest/easiest mod around!
That’s nice!! They wrote 50 on mine and it actually had 50!
"White LR dual motor with black interior and FSD. 

Not sure where to go next since the customer service # just reroutes me to local service center every time."
Me too! Cheers
They're all nice cars and your choice was probably the right choice for your location.  Congrats!
I have sent it to your dm
"Weird spam account, don't bother."
I have sent my dm
Absolutely!  I was figuring it was a solid white but having this pearl white was just a nice addition
"The white available now is the multi coat, even after white was made the stock free color. This wasn't supposed to be the case. It was supposed to be changed to a flat white for the included with the multi coat white still a extra cost but it's assumed they didn't have the line set up in time for the color addition so right now they are giving the multi coat for free.

It's just like how the standard model 3 was supposed to have cloth seats but they just put in the leather ones to simplify the manufacturing process"
I can’t wait to go to work on Monday lmao
How far is the next service center from you?  Some sales people will go above and beyond for you and some just don’t give a shit. I’m sure if you drop by another service center someone will be able to pull up your account and glance through it.
dm me too pls
Didn’t get anything yet 🤷🏻‍♂️
Musk tweeted they’re gonna stay with multi coat because it’s easier repair costs or something like that
"Just a weird spam account, not sure what their angle is, but don't waste your time."
Then you dm me
Thanks. Figured something was up with it just by the grammar lol
One day I will get to exclaim the same!
Lmao I love how you say your first. So true. It will take quite the car to pull me away from Tesla. And we'll eventually have 2 when my wife gets one :)
Congrats.  You'll never go back to an ICE car.  😉
"I have the same configuration. It’s a dream isn’t it? It’s such a solid feeling car, and brings a smile every time I see it."
Congrats!!!
Can‘t wait for mine. Sitting here in Switzerland and stare on the statusreport....
What a beauty!
But not your last one ;)
Sexy! Waiting for progress on my order very impatiently... Congrats!
Woodman’s Market?
Congrats! How long between ordering and delivery? I ordered the same combo 2 weeks ago and still no vin 🙁.
[deleted]
Seems 90% of the Tesla users on this forum somehow forgot to install their license plate.. where does it go :D ?
Nice rhyme. Happens all the time.
"Lol I didn’t realize my own application! But hey, I’m not going back to gas cars for sure!"
"Haha I noticed that too.  ""To OP - You planning on getting another one or something?""  They are great cars though!"
I woke up today and checked the garage to make sure it wasn’t a dream! Feels surreal!
Thank you!
Been there. Not sure how long you have to wait. But the two weeks for us was sooooo long 🤦🏻‍♀️
Thank you!!
Definitely not :-)
Yay! 😁
Two weeks between the order and deliver. For the vin we kept checking everyday but we only found it a few days before the delivery day. We were looking in the wrong place 🤦🏻‍♀️ it’s in the my car section.
"Lol you know, when I posted this I figured someone would say this. But the only other proof I got is videos of my husband screaming while driving it lol  we drove through most of our miles showing for friends and family 🙈"

"Sadly we will have to put a front plate. But when we were picking up the car, the lady told us that we will only need to put on the EL plates when we get them in the mail. Otherwise for now nothing in the front :-)"
Since it’s brand new it’s on temp tags.  Real plates come in 30 days or so. In my state temp tag is a single paper card and needs to be attached to the rear. Since the front plate holder is literally just 3M taped to the car the SC just leave it in the trunk.
It’s funny.  I’ve only been to that supercharger once about 6 weeks ago.  But for some reason instantly recognized it.
Thanks!
Show that vid! 😄
"Yeah, I am glad we don’t have that requirement in GA. Don’t mess with my car’s smile."
It’s really nice cuz the store is 24/7 and the chargers are never packed.
Aww very lucky!
Can you request plates in France or did you get lucky with the Watt plate on an EV?
👍🏿
Love the « SpaceX » tag 😍
How are you liking the blue/white combo?
Now this is just awesome!
Hook em
"Beautiful.

Something about the European plates... I wish NA plates were similar"
OoOoO the history!  Giving me the feels
Hook’em! 🤘
"Haha I wish it was. It’s a fake plate, thanks photoshop"
"I know you used to be able to, not sure if that’s still the case. My friend lived there and would send me anything I requested on them."
"No regret, still looks the best to me."
"I ended up going with white/black because I ordered right when they moved White to default, and decided to put that money towards FSD. I'm leasing it for 2 years, plan on doing the model Y as an actual purchase, and definitely want to go with Blue/White. It does look fantastic.

How was experiencing Normandy?"
I’m curious why you spent the money on FSD for a 2 yr lease
"Yes FSD is the priority. 
I’m visiting family and they all enjoyed the merry-go-round tesla experience."
"I have pretty severe driving anxiety on expressways. I've been avoiding it which compounds the issue. I wanted to move to Tesla's system after being disappointed by other manufacturers supposed assisted driving systems, however I didn't want to take the full plunge on a long term purchase just yet.

It is not a financial based decision as I'm well aware that a) a 2 year lease is the least fiscally responsible agreement to get into and b) adding self-driving on top of that when Tesla's just going to take the vehicle and turn it into an autonomous taxi when I'm done anyway.

However, I have been able to get out on the road way more than before and become more and more confident in my driving again. If I decide that I don't need FSD, after 2 years when I move to a new vehicle I can just hang with the basic autopilot, but at least know what current FSD is capable of."
I think you mean roller coaster?  🙂
"That’s cool that it helps you so much even in its current form.  I am also leasing, for 3 yrs though.  I decided not to pay for fsd since I don’t really see the full capability being ready to release till the end of the lease. That’s why I was wondering.  I would definitely recommend you get it when you purchase outright though cuz it will continue getting better over the life of the vehicle. Cheers"
Tesla must be making bank on the idle fees.  I’d sit there looking at that for hours.
😂🤣😂exactly the all stations were full did not care it only charged by 60kwh :)
Looks like a Hitler stash...
This car is now exempt from ever having to use the turn signal to change lanes.
This is hideous
"Lol funny, but amazed someone would do this to their m3."
I can't handle how off-center that sticker is.
kidney grills are too small lol
Now you need to worry about topping off turn signal fluid...
Instantly cut it down to an 82 mile range.
Had me for a second
Lol what in the fudge
Cries in German.

"Reminds me of a joke......

This is what happens when someone can’t let go of their BMW roots 🤣
Neither attractive nor funny.
"For a very brief moment you probably made a few bimmer fans extremely happy, then extremely sad🤣😂"
"The grill sticker on the front doesn't match, at all.  Most notably, the bottom where it's hanging over the lip there at the bottom, and curving over the hood."
This hurts me.
Turn signal removed at factory
Fake....not enough grill
The mustache on that car will leave a lot of people führious
"I saw one disguised as a Honda Civic, which is brilliant! My plumber reneged on his offer and charged me double when he saw my Tesla. He was like, whoa, you have a Tesla, you can afford to pay a little more..... The A/C guy was starting to say the same thing. I told him that it was a loan car as my car is in the shop. Whew! That was a close call!"
"From this angle, the logo and the grill don’t look centered.  Please tell me this isn’t the case."

Also doesn’t have to stop at red lights or stop signs
^^ Truth
"Well they were tired of people being pedantic about how “M3” should only refer to the BMW model, so..."
Hehe. Actually the old skoool BMW 2002 has those type of grills.
And off-center.
Haha nice. Yeah the owner did this as a joke while spending a weekend in Monterey.
Hahah 🤣
😳😆🤣
If I would find this out it would be bye bye order. Piss off and I'll never request your service again and I will badmouth you however I can. People work hard for their money and should spend it however they like. The govt taxes plenty and taxes are worse when you have more money as it is a percentage (which is fair up to a point). No reason for a normal business to do the same. I bet they won't give  you a discount when you park a busted pinto in the driveway.
Yeah I saw the same thing lol
Yes it was in Cali. It was a temporary stick-on as a joke. Hilarious !!
Fuck
🔥
shut ur ass u fat cunt
The owner is actually a die-hard BMW fan/owner/collector whom recently got his first Tesla (this pictured Model 3) and is loving it !
"It’s kinda silly. If I said to a random person, “hey come check out my m3,” they would probably exclaim “whoah you have a BMW?!” It’s a cultural icon."
"As someone who has a BMW M3 and a Tesla Model 3 right now, it gets a little confusing on the fourms. First world problems for sure. Then there're the people who are like ohhh cool you have a Mazda3!"
i stand corrected! lol funny though. someone posted a model S with exhaust and hemi badging. good sense of humor
The cop writing him up for no front license plate will do a double take :-).
That's why I am reluctant to sell my busted old gasoline car even though I have a Tesla. LOL.
hilarious? I bet the fart sound generator has you in stitches
"Typing it here in this subreddit makes sense, but even then in my head I read it as model 3. Saying m3 out in the wild seems wrong. One extra syllable to avoid the conversation to clear it up seems worth it"
"Matter of fact, it does ! 😅"
"Oh man, not sure if you noticed, but that classic Tesla quality control really screwed up this time. Your steering wheel is on the wrong side!"
Congrats man RHD Model 3! They are everywhere in LA! LHD that is!
"Oh wow, the black looks so good! 😍"
Looking forward to seeing other Model 3 owners on the roads of the UK 🇬🇧 and at Superchargers 🚙⚡️
Remember there is no demand and tesla will be bankrupt this year  ;)
"Wow, you look excited! Lol"
"Lucky you — day one UK reservation holder and day 1 order here — and still nothing, not even a VIN. So much for the summer European road-trip in the new Model 3 ... (LR AWD blue/white). But the consolation was that I saw the very first Model 3 in the wild this morning. Looking good!"
"I used to visit England often and rented a car on one of my visits.  Tiny car, narrow roads, and very difficult to park.  Do you find the Model 3 a bit large for your roads?"
What is going on with the front bumper? It looks like a piece of plastic to hold the license plate.
Congrats! Go over it with a fine tooth comb. Collected mine on Friday last week and it has a myriad of paint and panel issues I didn't notice until I got it home
How long was it between ordering and delivery for you?
I'm sure there's a setting or software update that can fix it
Nah. The foto is reversed.🙃😄❗️
Lol yeah that's my bro - he was excited too don't worry
"Ah, sorry to hear you've drawn a short straw concerning delivery.  Perhaps it's your config? I know they do batches so maybe they just haven't done a lot of blue/white interior model 3s.  Hopefully soon but I can promise you it'll be worth the wait!"
"Haven't got a Model 3 yet, but it is about the size of my current (ICE 😕) car. I don't find it a problem but I don't know any different. Think it's just a case of what you're used to and where you're driving. I am in the country so deal with some of the tiny roads you're referring to! 

As for parking, most towns and cities now have chargers in car parks. But EV take up isn't enough that they're that in demand. So for me a big bonus will be almost ways having a guaranteed spot. For a while at least before the EV market grows (hopefully quickly!)"
(fellow RHD Model 3 buyer here) The Model S is too large for UK roads in my opinion which is why I'm buying a Model 3 and why I think the 3 could be a HUGE seller in the UK if Tesla play their cards right
"I came from a small to mid sized rover but this feels no bigger despite being 70 cm longer.   It turns just fine despite it not having the *best* turning circle and just feels compact and accurate.

It was a pleasure to drive it away yesterday (took around 5 minutes to get used to it).

I still went for a clutch and gear stick a few times coming up to junctions and round-abouts, etc 😂"
That's just an artefact of the image for some reason.  Fine in real life.  And that lighter grey is reflection of the floor
Ah sorry to hear about your issues. I hope they can be sorted.  I've had a close look at everything and thankfully I have no issues
"I ordered on 4th May, VIN on 12th July and delivered yesterday (12th August).  Not too bad really"
No worries. Mr Elon is just going to delete them soon(ish).
"Wait, which way do you flush in you crazy moon-land?"
"Boy, was it not. ..."
"Ha, yeah forgot Brits and Europeans still drive stick. I miss stick shift, but they are very hard to come by in the US. But regen breaking drives like a manual transmission, minus the shifting"
"Got it, thanks."
What's your model variant?
Thanks! Was that fairly on track with your original delivery estimate? I see they are currently advertising September delivery if ordered now but not sure how likely that is
"I’m dying to know this answer. RHD people, is your toilet handle on the left or right side? Hahah"
Care to expand?
"Well originally it just said deliveries start late June (which they technically did).  It slipped to July and and then august but only for new orders which made sense.

I was keeping an eye on Tesla shipping tracking so knew where the car was all the way from San Francisco.  To give you an idea, I got my VIN the day before the ship left the port on the 13th July and it arrived in Zeebruge on 2nd Aug and picked it up on 12th August.

Have you ordered or just considering?"
Looking to time it right for when my current car's PCP ends - March 2020. If anything I'll order for it to arrive early so I'm not without a car
"I’m looking at buying within the month, getting a September estimate here. I’m hoping deliveries will be quicker now the initial backlog of deliveries to UK is clearing. Sounds like you ordered right at the beginning."
"Nice one! I'd obviously recommend it if you can afford it :)   i know there's at least two ships on their way to europe with RHD Model 3s this month.   I imagine they'll be pretty consistent as there are like 8000 UK orders since May.

Yeah ordered May 4th"
Likely tires require balanced.  Are they 20” or 22”s?
They are 20”
You can take the car to most any tire shop for a tire/wheel balance.  Be sure they have the appropriate jack pucks to prevent damage to your battery.
