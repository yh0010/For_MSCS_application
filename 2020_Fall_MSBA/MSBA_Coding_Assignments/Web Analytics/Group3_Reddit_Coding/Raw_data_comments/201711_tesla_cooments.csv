I'm willing to bet that the Bugatti's top speed will be changing within the next year. 
"Its settled, I'm buying 15 Roadsters instead. "
*I woke up in a new Tesla*
"Bugatti hasn‚Äôt even attempted top speed in their car yet. The 261 is just what they limit the car to right now for their customers.

Everyone knows it will be 280mph+, the question is can they find new tires that let them reach 300.

If you read Motor Trend‚Äôs review of the Chiron, they said a $180k Turbo S would accelerate as fast in 0-60, but the Chiron feels to accelerate faster from 60-180mph than it does 0-60, that‚Äôs where most of the power delivery is.

It‚Äôs odd that Tesla only bragged about 0-60 and 0-100mph numbers, for most hyper cars that aim for 250mph+ top speed, they brag about 0-124, 60-150, or 0-200mph time, that‚Äôs where the differences lie. 

Actually they mostly brag about lap times around the Nurburgring, since that‚Äôs a better indicator of the overall performance of a vehicle.  

One big concern with EV in this context is that due to the nature of EV, a powerful car would require a big battery pack, and current battery technology means it will be a very heavy battery pack. Weight is public enemy number one as far as motor sport engineering is concerned, so the Roadster's track performance is still a big question mark at this point. I personally think if they solve the battery cooling issue, it should be very respectable, but very, very unlikely to be record setting considering some of the [bat shit insane stuff](https://jalopnik.com/the-1000-horsepower-mercedes-amg-project-one-this-is-1803141648) that's coming out right around the same time.

Fun fact: right now there is a [pissing match between Bugatti and Koenigsegg](https://www.topgear.com/car-news/pioneers/koenigsegg-agera-rs-smashes-bugattis-0-249mph-0-time), would love to see the new Roadster jumping into the foray. 

Edit: Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love, *love* the new Roadster, and it's super cool that now an electric car will likely be the king of drag races. But it‚Äôs not the be all end all sports car and the world of hypercars go far beyond 0-60 and quarter mile races."
To be fair Bugatti top speed is definitely higher than Tesla Roadster since Bugatti's is electronically limited for safety
"Added a few categories that were missing.

Criteria | Tesla | Bugatti
---|---|----
In production | No | Yes
Driven by independent parties | No | Yes
Available in the next couple years | No | Yes
Likely to have a newer version in the next few years | No | Yes

"Yeah but.

[Tesla vs Pop-Tart](https://i.imgur.com/U7LlLoX.jpg)"
The 0-60 time doesn't surprise me because electric motors generate so much torque but how do they sustain 250 mph without destroying the batteries? 
The Chiron exists today and can do a lap of the Nurburgring at full speed without overheating or running out of gas.
"Can we add a row: 

> NO --- Exists --- YES

?"
"So we're gonna be doing this again. First we had comparison charts in favor of the P100D compared to relative cars, then the Model 3 compared to entry level luxury cars, and now this.


Of course information about lap times or how long the Roadster can sustain this speed without the battery overheating don't exist right now, but stuff like this is what makes people think Tesla is filled with obsessed fans. How about we just wait in 3 years (if it comes out in 3), to see what the Roadster is all about? I don't doubt it'll check a lot of boxes that Tesla is advertising, but posts like these is what make Non-Tesla fans roll their eyes."
"I‚Äôd hazard a guess and say if you can afford the Chiron, you wouldn‚Äôt look twice at a Roadster owner driving past you.

Pedigree, uniqueness and craftsmanship are purchase factors when it comes to Supercars for many."
[deleted]
"Don't even get started with this shit. Numbers aren't everything and the Bugatti Chiron is light years beyond the Tesla in terms of quality, fit and finish."
Bit unfair to compare something on sale now with something that isn‚Äôt out until 2020 at the earliest. I‚Äôd also love to see a comparison on build and interior quality. 
Why does this place feel the constant need to shit on everything that‚Äôs not a Tesla?
"In my experience the fastest car at the drag strip is usually some busted old RX7 that has 1500hp and cost like 10 grand all in. All of this is meaningless. Buy a car because it makes you happy, not because it has some number that is better than someone else's number."
Bugatti : Actually available for purchase
"Imaginary vs real 
Not available vs available"
Man you guys love that 0-60 time. If I am ever going to spend 200k+ on a car it's sure has hell not going to be a Telsa. I'd rather have a Mclaren for that price.
[deleted]
8.8s? Thought it was 8.9s for the 1/4 mile from Musk's presentation.
these posts are so stupid lmfao...pathetic. 
"Yea but the average Bugatti owner has 84 cars, a yacht, and 3 jets."
Cherry picked comparison. The roadster might be impressive but this comparison sucks big time
As an automotive engineer the speed of Tesla's growth is fucking sickening. I develop turbochargers and we have a project right now to make minor changes to our 6 cylinder engine finished in the end of 5 years. Tesla is designing a new fucking car every 3 years. I hope my manager doesnt browse reddit.
"Serious question... From dead, how long does it take to recharge the battery?"
These comparison charts are dumb no matter what the subject is. It‚Äôs always just cherry picked points to make a biased point. 
[deleted]
What a circlejerk this sub is. But then again its reddit in general
"*Range at what speed? Wide open throttle full speed?
"
"hard to beat the instant torque of an electric motor
however nothing beats the sound of a big ass V8 or V12
"
https://imgur.com/a/GQYeQ
Im a total tesla fan-boy... But that 620 mile range isnt taking into account hard acceleration etc. This is an amazing electric innovation. Hands down. But IC engines have certain advantages (as do electrics) for the moment 
Yeah but it doesn‚Äôt make the loud vroom vroom noise 
Anyone else curious about the 0-400-0 time for the Roaster 2.0? I really wanna see how it really compares at the top end to million dollar hypercars
What they both have in common - both are too expensive to ever be owned by me
Can anyone tell an uninformed person from r/all about the potential battery life and lifetime performance of these machines? Perhaps the value over time of these machines once their battery life becomes a question?
"So the Bugatti is worth a lot more, got it!"
To go over 250mph you'll need 250mph+ rated tires. They are on the bugatti and cost almost $40 grand. Good luck Tesla.  Lol
"Need to see a tesla set some records on a circuit before taking these numbers seriously.



Edit: Keep in mind, hillbillies have been building drag racers for way under 200k that absolutely smash the tesla specs in a straight line. Granted they aren't comfortable or able to go for super long distances."
Exists now/ Is still a prototype.
"But, but, it's a Bugatti."
I‚Äôve wanted a Roadster since I saw it in the prototype section in a car magazine my brother had laying around when I was little. What‚Äôs super crazy is that the range increased so drastically...I think it was 250 something miles in the magazine. Amazing.
How does a Telsa handle in snow?
Is it the model S. Has anyone said just look at that S car go yet.
"Well, the Bugatti does sound about 15x cooler..."
"Numbers on the left: unsubstantiated.

Numbers on the right: confirmed."
At least the Bugatti has interior controls and not a bigass touch screen.
"Also: 

* both *aren‚Äôt* mass market cars

* One you can buy now

* One is fiction

* One is not going to debut at the price it‚Äôs currently listed at

* One has a ‚Äútop speed‚Äù that hasn‚Äôt been verified

üëçüëè"
But the difference is Bugatti actually can produce their cars 
"People see a Bugatti, a Lamborghini, or a Ferrari, people stare, take pictures, etc.  It‚Äôs kind of a big deal.

People see a Tesla, glance, maybe take a picture, and keep walking.  Tesla makes great cars, but they don‚Äôt have the sex appeal of the others I listed.  I would gladly buy a Tesla though.  A nice one with P100D on the inside in white."
"You do know the Tesla doesn't exist, right? It's still three years away, that's a long time. I tired of people thinking it's great, it's not, because it doesn't exist."
Speed limits 85mph
"1978 Ford Pinto:

0-60 in 12.1 seconds with a 1/4 mile just under 19 seconds.

Top speed of 97 (12 miles faster than highest speed limit in the US).

Range 377 miles, seats 5.

$3,629 (1.8% the cost of a new Tesla) 

So the Tesla is 2-2.5 times as fast, at 55x the cost. 


"
[deleted]
How do we know these numbers are actual and not just guesses. The car doesn't come out until 2020. Do they have a prototype doing these right now?
"I know aesthetics are subjective but I can't be the only person who finds Bugattis hideous. I mean, most super/hyper cars are in a weird ugly phase but Bugatti's styling looks like it got outsourced to a third party who has no business styling cars."
Yeah but which one actually exists?
[deleted]
The 4 seat thing is a joke right. Also Chiron looks a lot more cooler. That said at the end of the day the Tesla Roaster is going to be worth more than $200k since it is a limited edition. 
r/all incoming to tell all of us why we should dislike Tesla.
"If you guys believe this I have a car you can order for $1000 that will go a million billion miles an hour, I designed it in Crayola. "
"You forgot the Tesla looks like an ugly Hotwheels car, along with an interior of a $5000 car. "
How much is that in stadia or furlongs per hour?
"Still expensive, but worth the money. ish."
"I‚Äôll buy these figures when I see it in action, tested by impartial third parties. 

Optimistic though. "
"To be fair, the Bugatti interior will be a lot more plush. Maybe not that much money's difference, but it'll be a noticeable difference. Feeling and hearing the engines, too, makes a big difference.

That said, this Tesla is the one I've been waiting for. Wish I could afford it."
But the Bugatti is blue.
I'm still impressed by model 3. Super good times 0 -60
[deleted]
Tesla Roadster please!!!! Just to think that version of it is only base model. Elon has another one that‚Äôll be coming out that is the better version than the base.
"None of that accounts for cornering though, which determines lap time, and traction, and safety at speed. They skimped on active aerodynamics. "
"I m extremely interested in the solutions that Tesla has come up with for the issue of tires on the new Roadster.

For instance, the Veyron and Chiron have specially engineered tires that can withstand the forces associated with going ""250+"" miles per hour.  

The Dodge Demon has specially engineered tires to allow it the grip necessary to do 0-60 in 2.3 seconds.

However, those special tires that let the Veyron go at its top speed don't give it the super soft grip that it needs to set a good 0-60 and the Dodge Demon is electronically limited to 168 MPH because at speeds faster than that those super soft tires that give it the grip to launch would simply tear apart.

So I am very interested in how Tesla is going to get around these issues and what tires they will run.  I have no doubt that on paper in a physics universe the three electric motors make enough power to propel the frame 0-60 in 1.9 or to get it to 250+, but the real world of car racing is such that the tires and other factors will come into play.

However, seeing Tesla overcome the heating issues for the batteries and having a track racing Roadster would be pretty sweet.  "
Oh and that's base model roadster
"There's certainly tradeoffs with the two cars (or comparing to any other traditional supercar). Die-hard enthusiasts will probably always love the sound of a supercar's engine vs a near silent electric motor. It's certainly amazing what the specs are for the latest Roadster, simple impressive!"
This seats four as well as my Saab seats twenty. 
This isn't a fair comparison... one is real... the other is a mythical beast lost to the woes of production logistics.
"You‚Äôre not just paying for the Earth Towing power with the Chiron, but some insane luxury as well... the Tesla will be simple but face destroyingly fast, hence the comparatively tiny price tag...."
Both their price tags should read something like ‚Äúnot for you‚Äù
This comment section is cancer. 
200k might as well be 3 million to me
When are you ever actually going to use topspeed besides say ‚ÄúHey this car can go 261 mph‚Äù
"The tires on the Bugatti, and the wheels need constant servicing to support reaching these speeds, to hit 250 a very specific and special tire should be necessary for the roadster as well I'd guess."
"Guess I‚Äôll get the Tesla then. Oh wait. It‚Äôs still $200,000!!!!"
House vs big house
"While interesting, I don't think speed is the only variable that matters. There are expensive ass Bentleys and stuff that aren't particularly fast."
and one is real and one is not
"200k? Yeah I got that in my other jacket lol
Why not have some fun if you have that kind of money? Get a Supra and do the 3000 whp thing. "
"Except the buggati will run at full power for the entirety of its range, and not only when full charged.  It won‚Äôt have fitment issues, cheap interior materials, and dead handling. "
"You guys realize the Bugatti can lap a racetrack more than once, the Tesla can't.  Also good luck doing that 1.9s drag run a few times in a row."
(2 giant people squashed)
and that's the base model
Yeah... I still can‚Äôt afford either.
this is the roadster base model though 
Hahaha I can't afford either of those. 
For the price of the Bugatti you can buy the Tesla truck to transport the Roadster
You forget to mention about 10000 NM torque of Tesla compared to just around 2000Nm in case of Chiron
Bugatti's give me range anxiety!
"Forgot to mention that the Tesla safety rating is absolutely superb

I want a Tesla so bad!"
What is the point of having a car that can go 200+ mph if you are never going to go that fast anyway?
"Also, one can daily drive the Roadster as a daily driver while the Bugatti really needs to be taken care of in a fancy garage with as little driving as possible to keep it's value. "
"How good does a tesla sound though?

Said no-one ever."
"I'd still rather the Bugatti. It's better looking. 
I also don't see the Tesla ever becoming a poster on the wall of kids bedrooms. "
"8.9 second quarter mile that your grandmother could do because everything is computer controlled

Literally a 12 second mustang 5-speed with wonky-ass live axle will still be more fun to drive"
Most important how long does it take to fill up? 
"I am having a hard time believing that range is even close to correct, and if so clearly not real world condition. Like i want to believe it but cant. Maybe like just a driver, nothing extra in car, driving really softly with no secondary stuff in use. Like if u baby the hell out of it u get 620; but add a second passenger, bags, use the radio and A/C, and suddenly u are down to like 300 or something. 

Still though even 300-400 would be great on an electric car"
There is no comparison here. The Tesla is nothing like the Bugatti
This car will start a new age of insanely fast super light electric hyper cars. 
But the Bugatti exists. 
"Guys, can we talk about logistics here? The Bugatti tires are around $25k a set. Why? Because in order to have the strength to withstand those centrifugal forces at 250+ mph they need a special compound, special rubber, special metal linings, and they also they need to be epoxied to the rims(which are replaced with every tire change). Meaning $40k+ for a set mounted and balanced. 

The same holds true of the current fastest production car a Koenigsegg. 

Now, do we really believe the Tesla roadster that will be $200k ish is going to have ultra special Michelin ultra high speed tires and ultra finely balanced rims in order to do 250+ mph?  Come on now. 

Modern, readily available production tires capable of doing over 200 mph are in the order of $3k a set. Mounted and balanced try $5k. Like the kind you need for a MacLaren p1 or a Porsche 916. Does that really seem feasible for a $200k car? Maybe. But those extra 50 mph the price rises pretty much exponentially. It‚Äôs not gonna happen no matter how much you wanna suck Elon‚Äôs dick. 

Edit: fuck your downvotes. You know I‚Äôm right. "
I think the tesla looks better too. Seems like a legitimate hypercar you could drive every day with no problems and no fear of high mileage. 
One company begs for government money to make a car another actually runs a profitable business. 
and that's the base model
Tesla styling sux. Look like imported from China plastic kid's toy cars. No contest. 
Why the hell would you want 4 seats in a sports car 
Well first tesla needs to actually produce them. Considering it is tesla that's probably asking too much.
Tesla's look to me as exciting as a Honda Accord :l. They have very little personality. I also feel that the crowd that admires them are the same who get wet over the next new iPhone or Pixel.
"whats up with the range of the Bugatti ? What the fuck ? I thought , you could get most gasoline cars over 1000km no problem ?"
Electric supercar and an electric semi truck?? When did the future arrive??
FUTURE
"620 mile range?! Holy shit, my eyes just bugged out."
Shut up and take my money Tesla!
one exists one doesnt
620 miles? Holy shit. Better performance than the model S and longer range? What kind of black magic is that?
Still would rather have the Bugatti.  The Tesla is so boring looking compared to other cars that cost much much less.  
and i will take the Bugatti over the Tesla every time without question.
shill bots are really trying their damnest to make people ignore Tesla's issues with production and cash flow
"tesla - car for boring nerds no one irl will ever respect

bugatti - car for cool people"
"It will break way earlier, it has crap interior. It has no sound."
Difference being the tesla is garbage in less than 10 years due to battery replacement cost
"Roadster will be obliterated on track by something half as expensive , such as a BMW M4 or a 911 Carrera S "
[deleted]
What about the Veyron?
"0-60 times aren‚Äôt that important. Top speed burns through tires, also not that important. What most enthusiasts want in a sports car is history, drama, and emotion. It‚Äôs cool tech but like a Bugatti it‚Äôs fairly gimmicky. The reason enthusiasts want a Ferrari is the history racing prestige sound look feel etc with an insanely good gearbox. No gears, electric wine, tire noise sounds... not my idea of a weekend car. I just don‚Äôt get the appeal of an all electric sports car. Seems pretty boring unless you track it. "
Plus Bugatti makes a hell of an ugly vehicle 
Also one is available for purchase.
"Im carfan and I like Tesla but comparing these two like which one you should take, from a carfan opinion its not very relevant as a better car is a car that has more soul to the one we are comparing it, my point is that a car should signal its presence with its engine sound like a Lion roaring or a bird singing "
I mean it's not like yall can afford either lmao
"On the right: Verifiable data on a thing that actually exists and works

On the left: Marketing material"
The Bugatti is a million times more impressive from an engineering standpoint. And it has better materials and build quality.
"Forgot torque, Bugatti 1,600 N¬∑m , Tesla 10,000 N¬∑m"
Don't forget the difference in emissions.
"Untill the Tesla does a Nurburgring time it don't count.

Any car can go in a straight line, especially electric. Show something real other than headline-numbers."
"Use Km/h and Km, you fucking ignorants."
"Bugatti veyron : exists

Tesla roadster : doesn‚Äôt exist "
"The Bugatti is a nice car though, not a cheap, ugly fire hazard like the cult mobile. "
"The Development driver for the Roadster also drove the La Ferrari FXX-K, said the Roadster accelerated harder."
Of course the Bugatti has the important feature of actually existing 
"This is like comparing a tailored suit with one from Zara or H&M.

Pretty silly. "
"Tesla = Whatever


Bugatti = Pussy"
But the Tesla is ugly as sin
"For a base model thats pretty fast

Wonder how fast an upgraded one will be... 1second?"
My old neue polo gti is paid for so I'm happy with what I have.

and you can drive from magic mountain to tracy and back without charging.
Now I have a Tesla Semi.
I'm gonna buy a roadster and two trucks so I can take the roadster the top speed in the Trucks can run defense
anyone know the comparison of a longer distance? 
"What about the sound? Does anyone have any comparison, like level of db"
Incredible 
"lol 200,000 car... that's more than half of a condo where I live (big city)"
But can it turn? Also what about the 1/2 miles? 
Still waiting on the pickup here. 
I bet Jaden Smith put tons of money into these roadsters to make his Tesla focused music videos trendy
Aaaaand I still can‚Äôt afford either.
"Bugatti still has a higher top speed for which the car was built, it is the one and only statistic that actually is important to compare both vehicles. "
If only I could afford either of them..
"Let's be honest, seats '4' more than likely"
[deleted]
"Anybody who doesn‚Äôt like the new Tesla are the same people who don‚Äôt like Bugatti.

There is more to a car than just raw straight line speed."
Yeah but the Tesla doesn't have a W16 though.
Lets talk about this again in 50 years. When gas is super expensive (if it hasn't run out yet) 
">top speed under 261
 
Literally unbuyable"
To be fair the leather in the Bugatti makes it worth it. 
Finally a hyper car for the masses! 
"Top Bugatti Speed is ~288 miles/hour

Range ~330 miles at avrg speed

 0-60mp is 2.3 sec
"
People don't buy a Bugatti because it's fast ü§¶
/r/hmmm 
Wait the Bugatti is worth 3 mil and not 2 million like I thought? Damn ill never be able to afford one :(
Or you can slap a turbo LS in some old car and run 8‚Äôs for like $20k. 
$200k for a Tesla? That's Ferrari money almost. 
Ha I'll never be able to afford either 
Why does it say 250+ instead of an actual number?
Ugh the tesla won't be out until at least 2020 and we don't even have a production car to test Œ≤independently. 
"And it isn't ugly as fuck, either."
"Are the sprint times and top speed fully electric? I remember The Grand Tour did the episode with the hybrid supercars that could only reach that speed using their gasoline engine.

If so that's insane."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrzQSX6Lqs0
Now compare the refuel times.
I‚Äôm pretty sure the Chiron goes a little faster than 260 that‚Äôs more like the super sport
"Do you think Tesla could have a built in sound system or something that replicated the satisfying sound of an engine as it revs and accelerates. A large part of the thrill is the engine sounds, with electric it‚Äôs like being inside one of those remote control things you had as a kid"
"> (Two giant people squashed)

Nice touch"
I'd like to see a roadster go over 250 mph...
What about the Veyron?
When Tesla makes one I can afford or the used ones are in my price range I'll definitely be getting one.
but which would you rather be able to afford easily 
"THats cute and all  but there is only one that I  can buy right now, and one that is a semi  production car"
"How will *The Grand Tour* spin this one?
"
Electric vs. Gas
"Something you forgot to mention: Tesla weighs about two thirds of the Bugatti. Also, it's the brand that you're paying for so comparing prices is not relevant. And as people mentioned those listed specs are not even correct. What are you trying to prove anyway? Tesla is a quirky consumer car compared to a Bugatti. "
Shame I‚Äôm never going to be able to afford either.
The Tesla lacks a notable aftskin.
"MRW when OP reads the comments


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1shTOCI3C94"
I like how range is implicitly @ 65mph.
If I only have 200k:(
"In terms of distance, does the Bugatti have the ability to catch up because of the charge times/fill up time differences."
Looks better as well
Who cares about too speed anyways? Most of the people who would own either of these cars would never push it to top speed.
"Wait, this thing runs an 8.8 on factory tires. Prove that to me. I don‚Äôt believe it for a second."
"SO AFFORDABLE!

At this rate I can save enough to by a roadster by the time I'm 300!"
people pay for labels
I am against this comparison. I think tesla is a great car and I think it can beat bugatti but I would rather have it compete against any present/future electric car than a regular car. I dont think it makes sense make this type of comparison.
"lmao this is hilarious. 

where's the horsepower stat? "
"Chiron's price comes more from reputation, sound and looks. It's nothing new, you see it everywhere: With clothes, watches, phones... sometimes brand takes the biggest portion of the price."
Why doesn‚Äôt the roadster have side mirrors? 
"the chiron is priced that way for other reasons such as top speed (which is extremely hard to achieve over 250mph), the luxury, and of course the brand name"
"Try with toyota FT1, it is 60,000"
The Tesla isn't a true roadster. Don't know why they chose that name. 
MAKE YOUR COMPANIES INTO CO-OPS ELON.
The Bugatti sounds a whole lot better.
So you‚Äôre saying the fit and finish of the roadster won‚Äôt be equivalent to a Ferrari? 
"Anyone else confused as hell about the roadsters mirrors? Why doesnt it have any?! Am I missing something? I know the model 3's mirrors fold in and out when it locks and unlocks. What will the roadster  do if it doesnt have mirrors?

Refueling times ? 
"A shame I don't have $200,000 to buy 1. "
'Woke up in a new tesla' just doesn't roll off the tongue.
"Well, still two cars i cant afford, doesnt really matter buy how much..."
Awful comparison.
No one buying either of these cars are looking closely at the price lol
"For those who know engineering, it's much harder to get a 2tonne car, which is petrol powered go that fast. It's expected in an electrical vehicle. Teslas supercar is great, but Bugatti is more challenging imo"
And the Tesla has back seats.
And this is just for the base model Roadster....

Rap songs featuring each car favors the Bugatti.
hot chicks only care about the last number lol
"Excuse me if I miss something, but aren't our roads more dangerous with these kind of machines? Just asking..."
seems legit

"If that doesn't say electric cars are everything, what would?"
"An electric car with a < 9 second quarter mile, for 200 grand. Seems too good to be true. "
"The only place the veyron really wins in is the top speed and luxury, with the Veyron being designed with luxury and technology in mind

"Everyone seems (understandably) to be in awe of the speed and performance.

Not me though. I'm in love with that *range*. 

I'm not in the market for a new car until my current work contract expires, but if the effective range has come on so far then going all-electric seems a lot more viable."
But which gets you off with sound of an engine? Who cuma first....
Is tesla on the new forza?
 Quick I need 200k
"Electric cars are still too damn expensive to put a dent in gas powered cars
"
Amazing. 
I like the 2 giant people squashed for the Tesla Roadster for seating 
can someone explain how they are managing to get a 620 mile range on new roadster when the model S can only get 320? even if it's smaller and lighter that can't add 300 extra miles.. is there some new insane battery tech i missed?
I know my next car in Forza. 
"Oh boy, I hate to break it to you but people dont buy the Bugatti for its 'specs'. Its like a rolex, doesnt tell the time any better, but everyone knows what it is. But yea, the Tesla is fucking quick. On an aside, I hope anyone who buys one has a high tire budget because those kinds of accelerations will absolutely destroy them. "
"Something tells me that if the new roadster is truly limited to 1000 cars that it will go for more than 200,000 on the after market.....or that they will lose almost no value. Im just excited to see the pissing match held by a bunch of rich people trying to get this car."
Jesus...i wish I had 2ook laying around!!!!
So you're telling me rich people will spend tons of money on things for the prestige alone and not because they're better?  I'm shocked.
$200k vs $3mil = it‚Äôs expensive vs it‚Äôs really expensive 
yo but bugatti looks cooler
"""Fuuuuuuck!"" - Bugatti"
Yea overall speed 
"I haven't been excited about the future for a long time, but now I am. "
"Pussy

What‚Äôs the point of having a vehicle that can go that fast? Is there anywhere that people can go to truly open it up like that? Or is it just like a thing people like knowing they can do? I‚Äôd be scared shitless hitting 100mph lol
Will go around a racetrack? Sometimes/yes
Bugatti Get the fuck outta here
The Tesla one  is red so more speeding tickets. Junk. 
Can we get a how many produced per year comparison...
The future is now.
It is worth noting that Elon stated that this was only the base model. There is supposed to be a upgraded model.
"Yeah, but the Tesla has almost zero style.  "

3 million + gas
I actually think the Roadster 2 is a better looking sportscar from the outside. 
"unrelated, does anyone have an extra $200k I could borrow? 
Seriously, it's for school."
But a billionaire would still choose the bugatti because its flashier. Or both.
But which one comes with the most powerfull chick magnet.
"Knowing Elon though, he probably talked it up slightly more than what the final version‚Äôll be."
Idec I still have the LEGO version
200k actually seems like a pretty realistic price tbh
It‚Äôs aesthetics duhhhh 
"ITT, people rage shitty over Tesla. ""OMG, the audacity!"""
"This is awesome, makes me so happy, now pair it down and make it obtanium, cause it it is still unobtanium for regular people."
620 mi range is a joke.
the thing that bothers me is this says tesla goes at 250 plus and the bugatti goes 261. You could either write the exact speed tesla goes or also put 260 plus for bugatti
"Regardless, you gotta be impressed that an electric car is up among the big boys.

I wonder what ever happened to [this car](https://youtu.be/5gFGX43vubM) "
No braineri  I guess eh Bugatti?
Shots fired
Can't afford either
Doesn‚Äôt matter cause the Bugatti actually makes noise so it wins
"Watch this how it‚Äôs made, the Bugatti is entirely hand made, it‚Äôs engine is so powerfully scary that Bugatti won‚Äôt allow it full hp out of its cage, they fear that the g-forces would harm test drivers, so it‚Äôs never been tuned past 90% @1200hp,the engine has the potential of over 3000hp, the thermodynamics of the engine would have to be cooled with liquid nitrogen and most likely would liquefy in less that a minute.[how it‚Äôs made ](https://youtu.be/MmwJ13IBNDA) "
"""I woke up in a new Tesla"" doesn't hit, tho"
And the point being...?
And I still can't afford either car. 
"Hey y'all.... so apparently I'm a noob but didn't know if anyone could help me answer a question that I have...

If you go to tesla's website it says that the wheel torque is 10,000 Newton-meters (approximately 7375 ft-lbf) of torque.
If you look at the bugatti's wheel torque it says something around 1180 ft-lbf.

I've been around cars for a while so I am not that uneducated when it comes to this, but seeing that the torque is wayyy higher than anything I have ever seen, I figured I'd ask.

Thanks for the help in advance!

Wait is that the range for a full tank of gas
TESLA DOES WHAT BUGATTI DONT
"I really want a Tesla now. The specs are so good. I would have to make sure that I'm charging off a clean power source like a dam, then it would be 100% efficient. "

Bugatti's got nothing on konnigsegg! They beat them easily
"The new roadster is unexpected and totally insane. The model S barley added up when it came to numbers on drag, accel, torque etc‚Ä¶ this thing is another league. "
I mean its like buying a Patek Philippe... you dont really need to know what time it is. Your showing off how much $$$ you spent on it.. id take the supercar ANYDAY! or any motorcycle really.

In Tesla you get couple of body colors and be like every other Tesla..."
The tesla dosnt have a W16 with insane sound tho. Thats a big part of such a car. 
"I‚Äôve got a lot of doubts about that 8.8 second quarter mile.  As a life-long drag racer, it‚Äôs really hard to get anything in the 8s on streetable tires.  Even with 4WD, cars like the Nissan GT-R are limited by tires, not power.  The Tesla may make huge power, but it still has to get through tires."
2 giant people squashed. üòÜ
I'd still take a Chiron or a Veyron over it though.
Lol that is much cheaper.
Pretty sexy car. Fuck the bugatti. Make it seat four at least. I hate cars that can't sit at least four people. There are rich mofos with families too ya know. Or so I've heard. 
"No matter what other companies‚Äô spec sheets say in 2020, none of their cars are going to cost anywhere near as low as $200k"
That's the base model according to Musk

Both overpriced
I am a giant people and my friend who I drive around a lot is also a giant people. I think I just found my new car!
What about refuelling times
Nice big L for Bugatti...
How long can the roadster go without overhearing? This was the main problem the previous s models had with ludicrous mode as it overheated and went back to an s60 after about 1 min of actually driving it whereas the Bugatti goes until it runs out of petrol (which admittedly isn't very long either but certainly more than 60 sec). 
What does range mean?

"Oh hey, we're comparing a car that exists to a car that doesn't. I'll believe his absurd claims when I see it, Tesla hasn't exactly been delivering recently, so I'll take the words of this con man with a grain of salt.."
"The fact the one of the cars says ""Bugatti"" will increase the price"
"Devil's advocate here. What about the torque and HP?
"
If I remember correct. Aren't the tires 50v50 the bugati something like 10k a pop. Because they are the only ones that can handle 250mph. So almost a quarter the cost of the car is tires? That thing will be over half a mil when it comes out. No way it ends up at 200k
"Ok, now do the Koenigsegg Agera RS"
Id rather see the Model 3 production line steadying :/. 
but bugatti go's vrrrooommm
I still remember when I met Musk when Tesla was on the verge of bankruptcy lol
Does anybody actually believe the 7k wheel torque number? 
"Tesla also has DLC, if you want to enable all this?"
Best part is this Tesla is only the base model 
That‚Äôs just the base model for Tesla. 
"Wait are Tesla's really that cheap? I thought that they cost around $700,000 or something :o"
Top trumps -cars for the 1% of the 1% edition. 
at what speed consistency are the evaluating the range?
"Yeah, but the Bugatti has body panels that don't look like they came pre-crashed from the factory, it's a very limited production (adding to the price), and the interior is up there with Pagani and Rolls Royce in materials and craftsmanship.

Even if the Tesla is quicker, they aren't in the same league."
sure it can go 250mph but for how long before the batteries melt?
"Tesla is the future..the chiron is the present...
"
Probably about the same number produced too?
Bugatti isnt even the fastest production car anymore. But that tesla is pretty amazing.
So you're comparing a car that is already in production with a car that wont be for at least 3 more years?  Not exactly apples to apples.  
lul
I thought the Bugatti was called the veyron? Or did they release a new one?
I still wish they'd made one aimed at the average Joe Mazda MX-5 buyer..
"I mean its like comparing apples to oranges...Lmao, besides, there are other metrics to a car besides what is *selectively* listed here."
Well checkmate Bugatti. But its not always just about performance but about whos got the biggest Purse
"It‚Äôs like, what‚Äôs the point of buying a Bugatti any more?"
The fuck is 250+ for a *top* speed? 
Man I thought they were going to charge a million for the roadster. 200 000 I might get one!
Of course nothing to do with the terrible failure of the current model.... So obviously not just a cheap attempt at distraction talking up a model that is  2 or 3 years in the future
Where are people goner get 200k from
"The reports on Bugatti‚Äôs are crazy!!!if you radiator busts it‚Äôs about 60,000 to fix oh and there‚Äôs 4 of them you have to replace them all. Nope!"
Strong post you got here... Got any actual data to back this up with?
In all fairness we should also add a section how long each can maintain top speed before melting down
The idea of going 100mph in under 5 seconds is honestly terrifying.

"ELI5

I don't know very much about electric car performance, but what makes it that Tesla can get these numbers with relative ease, while petrol cars have been chasing certain records for years...?

What design/engineering difficulties does a petrol engine have that a eletric car doesn't? 

Is it purely because of the insane amount of torque that electric cars have? Is cooling not an issue (Veyron had like 8 radiators or so?) Less moving parts? Not being dependent on insane rpm? Turbo's etc?

"
"The important thing for performance is weight. Notably, Telsa hasn't released the new roadster's kerb weight. However the Chiron weighs 1996kg - nearly two metric tons. That's more than the heaviest Land Rover Discovery Sport. Therefore it probably handles like a Discovery Sport compared to a lightweight sports car.

I would be surprised if the batteries in the new Roadster push it close to the Chiron's weight, with handling being much the same. Come back when you can post a sub-7 min time on the Nurburgring pls. The best time for a Veyron there is 7:40. Slower than a Porsche Panamera turbo!"
"Top speed doesn't matter , you can't go 250mph in the highway "

this sub is toxic
"Time to ""refuel""

Tesla : 3.5 hrs

"The automotive industry presents their new creations when the product is available or just about to roll out of the factory.

"Tesla's really cool car but it's something that I'll never buy it, no matter how cheap it can ever get.

Doesn't look as cool though. 
I'll be the first to say I doubt that Tesla top speed. I doubt it a lot.

At least they build Bugattis you can buy. They will make maybe 1 roadster a year.
"I like Tesla, but the Bugatti is a marvel of engineering and no other car in the world can be compared, even if they are twice faster and cost ten times less: it‚Äôs a class of its own."
How can the roadster be safe to drive if you have to go 250+ on it?
Which one sounds nice though?
Bugatti isn't taxpayer subsidized like Tesla.
Ye but the Bugatti goes up in value while the tesla will depreciate by 95% given the fact that you have to replace the motors ever like 7 years...

"Actually it‚Äôs electronically limited for safety, that car can most likely max at 288 mph so I don‚Äôt think they can make it faster"
"> F XXK

Ironically past a certian performance level ICE cars will be severally limited in range. There are crazy cars that produce 4500 hp that (maybe) could thrash the coming tesla roadster, the devel sixteen, but I can't begin to imagine how much gasoline you would have to throw at an engine producing hp in excess of 2000 . If storage and recharging keep on improving batteries will reach a higher energy density than gas. They dont have to reach the same energy density seen as EVs are a lot more efficient.

The Bugatti's top speed is limited by tire limitations. If it goes much faster tires would explode. Maybe we'll have some groundbreaking tire developments next hear.
Why is the top speed even part of the comparison? Unless you live in Germany and frequently drive the Autobahn you're never gonna go anywhere near that fast.

"It's harder to change a gas engine than it is to change an electric motor. Whatever that top speed is, Tesla will just send out a software update to run the batteries a little hotter and reclaim the title."
Why does top speed matter if you literally(literally(seriously literally)) would not ever reach it?
How much?
They can add top speed but they will never be able to beat a turbine at torque and acceleration. 
Is Bugatti trying to compete w  all electric cars?
Top speed is governed.  Remove it and it‚Äôs faster 
"its capped at 261, it goes like 280 something"
">I'm willing to bet that the Bugatti's top speed will be changing within the next year. 

No question. That 261 was never the final top speed - the older Veyron SS went 267 - it's what the current pre production models are limited to. Chris Harris speculated that it's actual top speed could near 300."
"Question. What's the point of advertising this top speed? The car can run that speed for how long? A few miles maybe? And please excuse me, I have no history of drivung/riding an electric car. "
"To be fair those top speed numbers mean almost nothing in the real world. All the lower number. 0-60, 0-100, 1/4 mile are all reflective of more real world driving situations. I'd like to see numbers of how it does in a dig. Like 65-120 sort of numbers. Or 0-100-0, how good are the brakes? How heavy is it? "
Just have to drop a tesla in there..
Yeah they are limited to like 263mph but under conditions for a top speed run Im sure it could do a lot higher. 
Next update.
"Someone please explain, why do people care about top speed when they won't reach it legally most of the time?"
Hopefully they also remove one of the zeros in the price tag
"only if someone actually goes and drives the Tesla at the marketing material speeds. The car industry is by now very used to simply ignoring any listed top speed claims. In the context of cars, the ""+"" at the end means it's marketing wank and probably significantly lower in reality. For reference, the ""+"" number for the Chiron is 288+, while 261 is what they've done on a verified two-way average run.(and they electronically limited it to 261 ""for safety reasons"")

Don't get me wrong, I've been convinced of the superiority of electrical motors for some time, but lets claim victory when we actually got one, shall we?  Better to focus on the 0-60 part where there's a: an actual win and b: real world application. most people don't have a private airstrip and won't see anywhere near top speeds on either car. Most people **do** hovewer start from 0 a lot."
Depends on Michelin!
I thought it had a theoretical top speed of 270-280?
They just need to make a Bugatti P400-Q to re-establish dominance. And put the motors into a W configuration for more optimal routing to reduce turbo lag and improve cubic airflow throughput... üòÇ
"They would have to go electric. I can‚Äôt explain it well, but pretty much being an electric cars allow for instant maximum torque (or something along those lines). Therefore, off the start, they should be faster"

"With these specs, the only real reason to buy the Bugatti is for the exclusivity. Although the roadster will probably be almost as exclusive anyway."
"I am just as hyped as the next guy, don't get me wrong and i know which sub we're in, but this image is just taking the bias too far for me. The bugatti range is if driven at higher speeds, and the tesla range is if driven and super eco mode which will certainly no do 1.9 seconds to 60, or 250 mph max. cause if you do 250 in the roadster you can bet you will have less than 100 miles range. 
"
I‚Äôm 100% positive that they will be the same price. The list price is to gain media attention which this is. Tesla wins again. I presume everyone on here works for Tesla?

"There are two reasons why Tesla brags about those numbers;

 * They want to share numbers where they come out better.
 * Your regular Joe doesn't know that the 60-150 is more important than 0-60."
"True, but top speed is just a bragging right.  Acceleration is where the fun is."
There‚Äôs a lot of amazing designs on the horizon - [Aston Martin Valkyrie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_Valkyrie) and the [Devel Sixteen](https://www.autoblog.com/2017/11/16/devel-sixteen-5000-hp-engine-video/) that are beyond anything available right now though I doubt the Devel could be anything like the concept due to packaging issues but what do I know. And it will be interesting to see what [Gordon Murray](https://www.topgear.com/car-news/supercars/gordon-murrays-new-sports-car) will do as well.
"Exactly! You should always look at the 60-130, especially these days. If you have a quick car you can beat Teslas in a rolling race. Nothing is more fun than letting them pull up after you smoked them and they wont look at you or they're completely red in the face.

The Tesla p90d in ludacris mode does 60-130 in 11.6 seconds... That's as fast as a Lexus is-f or Mercedes cla45.

Thank you for writing this comment. I saw this post and felt it was really just not telling the full story about the differences between the Chiron and the roadster. 

We also don't know how the Roadster is going to handle and ride and feel at those speeds. One of the hallmarks of the Veyron was it's *incredible* stability. Other cars could do 230 or 250, but they'll be bumping and jumping and tough to keep on the straight and narrow - and you wouldn't expect a lot of luxury inside. The Veyron does it all seemingly without breaking a sweat, and with absolutely impeccable build quality and luxury. The Chiron is also completely hand made, which places it on a different level to much of the competition."
"They are also 2 completely different cars. 

Bugatti is way more luxurious than a Tesla. Its like comparing a shitty 4 bedroom house to a 2 bedroom luxury condo. Yeah, the house is bigger and has more features. But my condo has quartz counters, a home theater in the basement, and heated floor tiles in the bathroom. "
You're forgetting about Hennessey Venom F5  & SSC Tuatara
Very informative.
That's because Tesla's are sluggish (relatively) at higher speeds. I'll be shocked of the 0-300-0 time is under 45.
"Okay, but the Koenigsegg Agera RS hit 291mph on a highway and cost less than the Chiron."
"People don't buy Koenigseggs and Buggattis not for the speed, though that is certainly great for their marketing, no they buy them for the ultimate flex factor.  If someone pulls up in a 200 grand tesla, he can't flex on he guy who pulled up in a 3 grand grand buggatti.  

Not that I support this consumerist fetisisation, but I digress. "
">the Chiron feels to accelerate faster from 60-180mph than it does 0-60, that‚Äôs where most of the power delivery is.

False, it only appears this way since the faster the Chiron goes the less of a role the power/weight ratio plays and the greater of a role the power/drag ratio plays instead."
"Equally important is 100-0 and 60-0.

It's even harder to put all the braking power into the ground than forward bite."
but they gave the 1/4 mile time so wouldn't that tell us what we need to know? im not good at maths
Why would tires be holding it back?
Who honestly drives above 70mph usually. 60 is perfectly safe.
Would you consider it a ‚ÄúBe all end all‚Äù electric sports car and/or hyper car?
"Thank you for this. I think the roadster is amazing but i agree its not the be all end all of the hyper car world. 

I do however think it will be the dominant seller in its price point. Despite having extremely tough competition. 

Also, the range gives me pause. It seems like a very large number so im interested to see how they accomplish that."
"Imo, this will all be mute due to the Tesla being a 250k car vs a couple mil for the other two. If this roadster does what they say, you'd essentially only be buying a hypercar for 3 things: sound, status, and style- and mostly the second one. ""Hey, look at me, I own a car that's as much as the GDP of a small town, 'cause I'm a douche."" Don't get me wrong, the Veyron is fucking gorgeous, but really? I'd rather have an Ariel Atom for fun and use the other $$ for some good- so says a poor fuck. Point is, Tesla just fucked up the whole game. "
Has Tesla  or an owner ever ran a official lap time at the ‚Äòring? 
"Isn't the Koenigsegg the cat with so much horsepower, it simply has 1fwd gear, and still spins tires?"
"I‚Äôm curious as to how the battery life handles the 0-250. I remember Top Gear has a quote once about how their fuel tanks can last only minutes. But with battery power, it may be dead before it gets to 250. "
Your comment was so informative. Cheers!
"> or most hyper cars 

see, this is a hyper car, but at a FRACTION of the price, so it's not a fair comparison. I think it's going to be one of the first times in history hyper cars have been sort of available to the semi-rich. I mean your average well to do business owner, not just a CEO or hedge fund manager. The car won't be the status symbol of wealth that other hyper cars have, but it's still able to swing and often beat those hyper cars."
"> they brag about 0-124, 60-150, or 0-200mph time, that‚Äôs where the differences lie.

The hypercars of today trade blows over 0-400km/h-0 times.  They're not at all concerned with the new Roadster.

[Bugatti Chiron 0-400-0 in 42s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkkV1vLHUvQ)

[Koenigsegg Agera RS 0-400-0 in 36s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1g07RpTPFE)"
Yup. This post is meaningless. Also the chirons range wont chage much at higher speeds whereas the teslas will become a fraction. Energy density of fuel is a lot higher than a battery. The sheer amount of engineering vw has put in these cars are crazy. Not to mention the bugattis dont rattle.n shake at all at high speeds.
"> and it's super cool that now an electric car will likely be the king of drag races.


The P100D already beats most supercars in the quarter mile. The only one I've seen to reliably beat it, is the McLaren 720S."
"> One big concern with EV in this context is that due to the nature of EV, a powerful car would require a big battery pack, and current battery technology means it will be a very heavy battery pack. Weight is public enemy number one as far as motor sport engineering is concerned, so the Roadster's track performance is still a big question mark at this point.

Question: how much does the IC engines and gearbox weigh in these kind of vehicles? Can we compare that with an estimate for the weight of the batteries?

The thing is that the EV motors themselves have an extremely high power density, so at some point, if batteries continue to increase in power capacity, EVs will cross ICE in power/weight ratio.

So I'm wondering, how close are we?

"
"> weight

For some context, the original Tesla Roadster was 1000 pounds heavier than the Lotus it was based on."

>Question: how much does the IC engines and gearbox weigh in these kind of vehicles? Can we compare that with an estimate for the weight of the batteries?

To answer my own question here, from one rough analysis, it seems that the weight of the Roadster will be comparable to the Bugatti Chiron and other hypercars:

https://electrek.co/2017/11/20/teslas-next-gen-roadster-technical-analysis/

That's very interesting if you ask me, because if solid-state lithium batteries make it to the EV market that could cut the battery weight roughly in half. If they can deliver the same power at the same capacity, that would lead to insane performance over weight."
"It's a U$ 200k car, even if it don't beat the Bugatti in every milestone, it's still extremely impressive, and electric super cars are still in the absolute infancy, while regular super cars exist for decades.

Downvotes lol, some one is very upset with the truth..."
Hypercars are more about handling than top speed. Bugatti is an exception however.
"Can you explain what makes the difference in lap times between cars?(this is a genuine question, I don't know much about racing, or exotic cars) if a tesla has a 0-60 that's faster, 0-100 that's faster, 0-200 that's faster, and a quarter mile that's quicker, what is it that makes it slower on a track? 
Coming from my perspective all I see is this numbers and my knees get weak, even though this is only the cover page of a whole book. What is the key? Any help would be appreciated!"
Tesla is still better 
"Electric has a constant torque curve, so you'll feel that push well into the 100s before the amperage causes too much EMF.

The Koenigsegg has also smashed the Chiron in it's times though. By a BIG margin...in the wet.

I doubt though the Tesla can really hold anything close the Chiron's range at top speed either though, those batteries will be toast if you try draining them that quickly under load.

I imagine you'll get barely 1/4 of the Chiron's equaliavelnt range at full pelt."
Just the fact that you‚Äôre comparing it to a Bugatti and a koenigsegg says everything. How can you nitpick the insane stats it‚Äôs pulling?!?
Why do people care about the ability to go hundreds of miles per hour? What kind of sane person ever goes above 100 or so?

Tesla is not making a hypercar. They are redefining the sportscar base class. 
 
Also, there is no practical application for a 300 mile per hour car. "

Because I'm never going to go faster than 100 outside of a racetrack.  The ad is saying that for any realistic situation I want to drive in, the tesla outperforms a bugatti."

Can't say that until we know the top speed of the roadster.
Tesla batteries likely can't sustain top speed for very long due to battery heating. I'll hold out comparison of tesla versus other supercars until they have a legit race. 
[deleted]
Top speed doesn't matter anyways.
Also i am curious to see how the aerodynamics hold up... like the huracan performante (sp?) has tons of it.. same with a viper acr etc to go over 200mph especially. But i dont know THAT much it just seems like it's really plain aero wise. 
But that price difference though!
"Good luck finding tires that work after 250mph, and are still useful below 250mph"
Definitely because tesla announced the top speed! /s
So what‚Äôs the point of a top speed then? (Serious question)
Youre kidding yourself if you think anything that happens over 200 is safe.

My thoughts exactly. Let's wait until the vehicle is in production before we get too excited.

That last one is totally wrong. They won't be selling prototypes.
"The roadster is a supercar meant to compete with similarly-priced supercars from companies like McLaren, Lamborghini, and Ferrari.  And although the top speed and acceleration are much higher than those supercars, I'm skeptical of how the car will handle.  Right now if you want a stupid fast top speed (240+) you need to upwards of a million dollars, but if you want a car that's fast on a track, cars like the Corvette, GTR, Viper, and even the Camaro can go toe-to-toe with $250,000 supercars for $60k-$120k.  Tesla currently dominates in fast 0-60 and quarter mile times, beating out other cars like the Dodge Hellcats.  

I'm not going to say the Roadster is going to be a straight-line machine considering the Nissan GTR weighs nearly 4000 lbs and handles great, but I'm going to hold my breath until the car ends up on a track.  The Model S can't even run on a track at full power for more than a few minutes and is minutes behind even $45000 cars on the N√ºrburgring.

I'm not trying to sound like one if those guys that says, ""Track times are everything!"" but there's more to a car's performance than acceleration and top speed."
[deleted]
"Or, they want a track ready car. 

The FXXK Evo would absolutely crush the roadster on the 'Ring "
This is true but it‚Äôs gonna burn them pretty bad that it‚Äôs no longer the fastest by a long shot.
"When you can buy the roadster for $200k it just says ""fuck me, am I stupid""."
Bugatti still outperforms the roadster. 
Yeah. It has nothing to do with the engineering perfection. It's just fuck you money.
"They're also buying it because it's the fastest car in the world. They're not gonna use that performance, but it's a status symbol. The Roadster is to the Bugatti what a riced up 2JZ Supra is to a Ferrari. It might beat it on the drag strip, but it doesn't match the quality and prestige of a *Ferrari*. Maybe Tesla will garner a reputation like that in time (being the Herald of the new era, I'm guessing it will), but that's a long ways down the road. A Lamborghini, a Porsche, or a McLaren, are more than a car - and while Tesla will end up beating them in performance in the not too distant future, those brands will still take the spotlight because of their history and presence."
">Doesn‚Äôt matter. The people who buy the Bugatti aren‚Äôt buying it for the performance. They‚Äôre buying it because ‚Äúfuck you, I‚Äôm rich‚Äù, and the low price of the Roadster actually makes it less appealing to many of them. 

That's really not true for most Bugatti owners. Sure you've got the high profile guys but those only represent a few dozen of the several hundred sold.

The Veyron and Chiron represent something different altogether: they are the ultimate representation of the petrol powered vehicle. The one car where you truly throw out all the stops. Why not have 16 cylinders? Why not have 4 turbochargers? Why not have 20,000 dollar tires? It's the pinnacle of what a gasoline powered car can be.

Will that pinnacle be overtaken one day by electric vehicles? Without question this will happen, but the Veyron and Chrion today are celebrations of the petrol powered vehicle and many who desire them do buy them because of that."
The type of people who buy teslas arent hooning their cars either 
"It's a ""Have or have not"" situation with the Tesla Roadster. And it's a ""Have or have yacht"" with the Chiron. "

"I want to see a Nurburgring lap time on the Roadster before I put money down on one :P 

Seriously. If it's actually track-able then Tesla has something truly special.

"This is why I hate this sub. People either drink the koolaide or are serving the koolaide (investors/Tesla)

The new roadster and p100D are amazing cars, but they aren't unanimous winners. There's a reason they never talk about track performance, why Tesla hid the windshield wiper on most renders and the event, why the model 3 production graph had no labeled axis, etc.

It's really a shame imo. If Tesla was blunt about their limitations, I would be much more supportive if the company. I don't want to buy a car or any product and feel like I was lied to or deceived."

"The reason that I think Tesla is filled with obsessed fans is because people call it a 4 seater. 

This is not a 4 seater, I'd imagine space is similar to a 911 in the back if not worse and the seats are just eating away at the trunk. (although as an 04 Forester Id love to sit in hellish seats in the back for the chance to ride in this. Admittedly)

Awesome specs but as others have alluded to sports cars are not rational purchases so while I'm sure it'll be popular enough a bitch to actually buy like the model 3 I don't see any chiron owners regreting their choice. 

Also thanks, these are two great cars but while I'm impressed at the working prototype between the chiron and roadster one exists and one does not right now. 

Tesla is turning into a big brand and arguing theyre better now because of a hypothetical car 3 years from now isn't necessary anymore. "

How about we just wait in 3 years (if it comes out in 3), to see what the Roadster is all about? I don't doubt it'll check a lot of boxes that Tesla is advertising, but posts like these is what make Non-Tesla fans roll their eyes.

I've had so many friends come to me to talk about the Tesla because they know I'm a car guy.

They're inevitably disappointed when I explain that we really hardly know anything about it now other than numbers provided by the manufacturer - numbers every car person knows to take with a grain of salt until the reviewers actually get behind the wheel.

Teslas crush it on the drag strip but on the track they're a much different animal. The original roadster drove like an overweight lotus... Because that's what it was. The next 3 models were more everyday drivers so you can't fault them for less than perfect handling... But the new roadster is a more unknown quantity. It's their first time doing a sports car all on their own.

I'd be curious to see what the focus on handling will be like during the subsequent development. Will they take it to the Nurburgring? Can it do a full lap of the ring? How the batteries perform under sustained track usage or long stints on the Autobahn? I'm fascinated to find out and really hope they focus on handling and performance too, and not just raw speed."
"Yep

Its funny how ignorant internet Tesla groupies show themselves to be about autos when they try to post those kind of things. They really believe their own bullshit. lol"

"Odds are not terribly well, cooling would hurt their coefficient of drag quite a bit, and it seems like they're perfectly content to target sprints instead of mixing it up with the type of long distance sustained performance track driving requires. "
It'll be on fire from overheating before finishing a single lap at Nurenbergring.
"No fucking shit. It's probably one of the best cars in the world, yet this sub is like ""HUH 1.9 0-60!!!"" "
$2.8 million ahead? Eh...
Well don't forget that on sale now doesn't equate to available now...wait times for the Bugatti are said to be 18 months or more. Still better than getting your car in 2020 lol

Daily performance is what counts to the exceedingly vast majority of people. 0-60 is a spec that actually matters for the exceedingly vast majority of miles driven. How many people will spend $3million to travel at 260mph a few times in their life vs spending 200k to hit highway speeds in mere seconds on their drive to work?"

They may as well put another comparison of 'number of tesla badges'.

"What do you mean? This sub is a Tesla sub and yet almost all the top rated posts are negative. There are people circle jerking in it, but they aren't circle jerking for Tesla."
"No, most likely something like 55 mph or whatever EPA ratings use. WOT would have a significantly lower range for both vehicles."
"21 mph, no accessories, windows rolled up, and tires filled to near bursting. "

They are really cool, believe me. I thought it was impressive. But it‚Äôs not the same at all. And the tech isn‚Äôt ready yet. You couldn‚Äôt drive one of these things on the track without overheating it"
"The Bugatti's range will be hurt much more by hard acceleration, fractionally speaking, than the Roadster's."
"Yeah... drive a Tesla hard, and the range will probably be reduced to whatever's the best range you can get by hyper-miling the Bugatti."
"That's what all the non-car people here don't understand. If the experience you want is to put your foot into the firewall and feel like you're on a rocket, perfect. I won't judge you and this car is perfect. But some people want more. Tesla fails to capture the passion and emotion that supercars have which is why they're largely ignored.

People don't necessarily buy cars for performance either, but this emotion. Knowing your Ferrari came from Maranello or that your car won LeMans brings this passion to the customer. Other example? My swiss watch tells terrible time compared to a smart watch, but I like knowing that it was hand built by a guy who's dedicated his life to the craft and that's something a computer can't capture. I don't care if your watch is 16 seconds more accurate the same way a bugatti owner doesn't care if you beat him to 60."

On the 2nd point, they were doing drag runs many times in a row as part of their [test rides](https://youtu.be/BfDRT_BwkbE?t=1m33s) at the reveal event. As mentioned in that video, the 1.9s is a conservative number but, again, we'll see what happens in a few years when production models start showing up."
You could buy multiple of each...
What's the point in having a car that can go faster than 100mph when there's barely any places where you're allowed to drive that fast? And where you can they don't even use mph.
People that can afford these cars can also afford a day at the track. That's where you take your car to if you want to go fast as fuck
"As another person posted, the average Bugatti owner has 84 cars...so big deal."

Model S with a 100 kwh battery does 300+ real world miles. This has double the battery size and is much smaller so 600+ shouldn't be too unbelievable.
"Even if it was true, it is a bit misleading.

That is not an option with electric vehicles."

"They said 200kWh battery and it will probably not have adequate cooling for sustained performance on the track, so relatively low coefficient of drag too. And it is electric."
"Engineering standpoint? So hey, it takes a lot more moving parts and a convoluted process to accomplish the same task that an electric car can accomplish with a much simpler process. 

Sure, its impressive, just like building a gear system with a 1000:1 gear ratio to lift really heavy shit but there's not just a point."
"That's a dumb comparison. Bugatti's are not track oriented either, they don't do particularly well on the N√ºrburgring. "

"F XXK has twice the down force as a regular LaFerrari and is designed for max track performance. It‚Äôs such an insane car that it‚Äôs not even road legal.

"Tires are a limiting factor. Bugatti decided to electronically limit top speed to 261 for safety though they know it *could* go faster. My guess is that while Tesla will probably also limit top speed, they don't know at what number yet and can't determine that until they have a production model finalized. They're committing to at least 250 as the limit for now."
You're seeing the prototype. Production car will have side mirrors.

That Tesla figure is not wheel torque.
"The performance tires needed to achieve these numbers will certainly be more expensive. Also, the Bugatti Chiron being compared here [uses a better design with cheaper tires] (https://www.motor1.com/news/180923/bugatti-chiron-tires-cost/) than the tires on the Veyron you're thinking of.

Bugatti electronically limits the top speed so it literally is the matter of a software update. Both Tesla and Bugatti have the problem of tires and that will be the limiting factor.
"Bugatti isn't changing anything. They just haven't done a public top speed run in the Chiron. 261 is just what the limiter is set to right now in customer cars. 

Besides, like EVs and other ICEs, the Chiron is probably just a software change away from more power. "
"Have Tesla invented better tires?

If not, they‚Äôre limited by the same thing Bugatti and Koenigsegg have been limited by for over a decade."
"The problem with the chiron is that its top speed is limited by its tyres.So if they're able to find a better, road legal solution the chiron will probably up its top speed  by quite a bit without changing anything engine related. "
"Air resistance increases exponentially. Making a car that can go 250 mph and then upgrading it to 261 mph+ is no small task.

All else being equal a car that needs 10hp to maintain 50 mph will need 80hp to maintain 100 mph."
"The speed is limited by the tires, not the engine."
"I mean yea, you can shove more power into an electric motor and get more power out, but you'll burn it up quickly. They have a nominal rating for a reason."

"They wouldn't. The 261 top speed is just an electronic limiter. With the right tires, the car is probably capable of 280mph+."
"Can I get a Tesla Semi road train software upgrade with that?

That way I could pass a Bugatti with all 15 roadsters in a chain just to rub it in."
Can I drive 15 Roadsters in a convoy?
"What actually intrigued me about the prototypes is that they seem to have no AP hardware at all, and not even proper places to mount it. I wonder if that will change in  the future. While it's appropriate for a driver's car to not have AP, it still seems weird coming from Tesla..."
"Does it actually have autopilot? He didn't mention it, maybe it doesn't. "
"Just curious, what is the rationale for an autonomous drivers car? Isn‚Äôt the point to drive it"
All those speed statistics to just sit back and read a book while driving exactly the speed limit?  Might as well be riding a bus.

The Roadster.
Silence sounds best.  Once you've driven an EV you realize that the noise of an ICE is an annoyance and a distraction from the driving experience.  People only get romantic about noise pollution because it's all they've known... it's like to smell of horse poop at the dawn of the automobile age.  
"Finally someone else! Tough I was the only one noticing that. The roadster will be on the road in what, 3 to 5 years? Plenty will change from here to there, both in the roadster performance as the prototype becomes a road car and in the bugatti lineup. "

"It can accelerate pretty quickly too, they proved that by breaking their own 0-400-0 record."
[deleted]
That's because the driver isn't accelerating as fast as he could from the beginning.
"It's crazy to me they put a big semi on the road in front of a dude going 280mph. 
You wait a few more seconds at that speed to start slowing down and you would be the world's fastest flatest object. "
"No, the driver didn't hit the gas until 180. Koenigsegg themselves said that in the press release. "
funny how slow 200mph looks after slowing down from 284
[deleted]
I think it is accelerated slowly at the start to preserve the tyres. 
"It doesn't wake up because it isn't being pushed, watch the g meter. Your video does nothing to help your claim."
He doesn‚Äôt go full throttle til about 180. He doesn‚Äôt want to give full power in lower gears.
Fuck me... that‚Äôs scary fast. 
He doesn‚Äôt go full throttle until just under 200mph because no one wants to risk wheel spin at those ‚Äúlow‚Äù speeds.
They weren‚Äôt going flat out from the beginning as they were going for top speed not acceleration. 
"I'm watching that, and at like 160 I'm just like ""wow. Yes, i realize it's fast, but I've never seen a vehicle going at this speed look so boring"" (I realize they weren't flooring it, but yes)

190 hits and I say ""holy shit!!!!!!"""
That thing is absolutely retarded... I love it so much.
450km/h. Insane. That's getting pretty close to 737 speeds.
"Holy shit you weren't kidding. Once it hit ~180, it just took off. "
"Wtf imagine having a car that doesn't even bother ""waking up"" til 180mph. Might as well be a land jet at that point 

Edit: And I'm over here with my two decade old car that barely decides to wake up just turning on the ignition lol. "
"That was amazing. Two crazy things to note:

(1) After traveling at 280 mph, when it slowed down to 100 mph, it felt so slow it seemed like you could hop out without injury.

(2) That speed run was 11691 meters. More than 7.25 miles."
I like how as he starts slowing down 150mph feels completely reasonable.
Shifted at 220.. that. Is. Nuts. 
Is this a new version of desert bus?
I think [this video](https://youtu.be/6VV4Q9Mv7zk) shows it much better. One:1 VS R8 GT. 
"I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure that guy just didn't put his foot down until 180. Since it was a top speed run, not an acceleration (and chance of wrecking) run.

Hell, I could have challenged his 0-60 in my old Saturn. SOHC, not even DOHC.

I timed his 0-60... it was around 13 seconds. He didn't exactly launch it."
"Jesus you weren't kidding.

That really puts shit into perspective. It was inching along from 140-175. And then all the sudden the gear switches and bam 2 seconds later you're going 220 on your way to 280. Jesus Christ."
I thought they were going pretty easy on the acceleration.
"I like how when it gets back down to around 150 mph, it looks like a nice manageable highway driving speed."
"I heard this as he kept going.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHQqb3h5OYM&list=PLrWu6uGTmfeVzXZm9LyLNT8HDJlhJdetx"
"I had seen this video the other day but didn‚Äôt even notice the massive push at 180, I had wondered why they waited so long to get into it..."
"That car did 200-260 in ~10.5 seconds, which is what my car takes to do 0-60"
...and to think that top speed on my bike is 300km/h (186)... Wouldn't mind knowing what 450km/h feels like on a motorcycle. 
/r/sweatypalms
They purposefully went slow to keep the heat out of the intercoolers. It's must quicker to 180 than depicted.

"The 0-60 number matters more to me, because i'll never go 150 mph in my life. I rarely go over 80 tbh.

The actual reason is that Electric vehicles have higher torque in the 0-60 range

Edit: oops, forgot you could drive legally over 60 on european highways"
"0-100 is what the average owner will use the most.

I'd bet most Bugattis have hit 150mph a handful of times at most."
"> Your regular Joe doesn't know that the 60-150 is more important than 0-60.

Lol, rekt. XD"
The regular Joe ain't going 60-150 but will got 0-60. It's a more relevant metric as consumer. 
They also set the 0-400-0 record on the same day.

"**Aston Martin Valkyrie**

The Aston Martin Valkyrie (also called through its code-names as AM-RB 001 and Nebula) is an upcoming production hybrid electric sports car collaboratively built by Aston Martin, Red Bull Racing and several other manufacturers.

The sports car is a product of collaboration between Aston Martin and Red Bull Racing to create a car entirely usable and enjoyable as a road car. The car's makers claim the title of fastest street-legal car in the world for it. Its design was helped by Adrian Newey, Red Bull Racing's Chief Technical Officer and the world's most successful F1 designer.

"Good questions.

>if a tesla has a 0-60 that's faster, 0-100 that's faster, 0-200 that's faster, and a quarter mile that's quicker, what is it that makes it slower on a track?

One small correction, the Tesla doesn't have best 0-200mph, and is very unlikely to. 

If you noticed, those are 0-x numbers, but on a race track, how often does a car slow down to 0mph after the race starts? The number is just that, exactly zero. So Tesla's big advantage of acceleration from 0mph is nullified quite a bit on the track.

More importantly, the key to a lap time is being able to stay at a high speed for as long as possible. But we have these things called ""turns"" on a lap, and this is where Tesla's big disadvantage kicks in: weight. For a heavier vehicle, with the same traction (including downforce) available, it will have to take a corner at lower speed due to centripetal force. More importantly, a heavier vehicle has to start *braking earlier* before entering a corner when compared to a lighter vehicle. 

So you have a couple ways to improve cornering speed: more down force (why race cars have wings), more traction (better tires), and less weight. Yes more weight actually does give you a bit more down force, but its cons outweigh the pros.

This is why in motor sports they are obsessed with weight saving, but due to the nature of lithium ion batteries, a powerful EV like the Roadster is inevitably tied to a very big and heavy battery pack. 

This is just a very superficial explanation, like you said, it's a very deep topic and I'm by no means an expert at this. There are lots of resources online if you are interested to learn more :) Hell, maybe even do a post in /r/cars and you are likely to get some good explanations.

Hope that helped, cheers :)

Over heating too
The car hasn't been tested yet and I doubt it will get to 250. 
They could always stick a 2 speed transmission in there.
"compared to exploding tires at 270, I'd call 261 pretty damn safe :D

(afaik tire specs is what keeps the 2 ton chiron back from higher speeds. The significantly lighter Koenigsegg agera RS is beating chiron speeds on regular race tires)"
What makes you think Tesla will be able to overcome the tyre issues Bugatti is having? 
"Can't say anything about the Roadster until it actually exists, can be produced and delivered without multi-year wait times, and can run for 200k miles without a transmission failure.

Big hurdles for a commercial car manufacturer I know."
What do you think the power draw is for the roadster when it is going 250mph?
"The driver, from his tires disintegrating. "
It's because the tires can't handle > 261.... according to Bugatti themselves....
"Tbh, I hope Tesla works out the battery and motor cooling for sustained high performance.  "
[deleted]
"Eh maybe/kinda, you can bring a bugatti around a track but it's way too heavy to be a good track car. "
"A few times I‚Äôve been around that track, so it‚Äôs not just gonna happen like that."
"200kWh battery? Yeah it'll have better track range than most petrol vehicles. Plus with that capacity, there'll be less strain on each individual cell, and less heat per cell. The heat generated is orders of magnitude less than petrol vehicles too, so, a little bit of a cooling system and it'll be a track demon.

At full throttle the Veyron's petrol would only last 12 minutes. If the Roadster 2.0 has 800kW of motors (600 at the back and 200 at the front), then the battery would last 15 minutes."

"Even if it can, Teslas are built for range, not track performance. That's why the Chiron has worse aero than a semi tractor. Not to mention the weight. There's no world in which the Roadster is faster than the Bugatti around a track."
"It's more like comparing a faster new car to an expensive old car.  The Bugatti is way faster than the more expensive Ferrari 250 GTO but that doesn't make the Ferrari a bad car, just a slower and more expensive one."
[deleted]
So how often do y'all compare Chevy's or Dodges to hypercars?
I feel like it's more like salmon to truffles. 
"F1 cars are super limited by racing rules. They aren‚Äôt allowed to use engines above a certain size or certain turbo technology. F1 cars are built for one thing, fast lap times, they don‚Äôt care that it takes an extra second to hit a quarter mile because when it reaches the corner after that quarter mile it can go through it at 200kmph. "
"Well, to be fair, the Bugatti is likely to have OTA performance upgrades. It's software-limited by 261mph and [Bugatti's already contracted with Michelin to release the Chiron-optimized 280mph-capable tires](http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/a10187823/bugatti-chiron-top-speed-tires/). I assume once those are out, there will be ""OTA"" performance upgrades."

"We can do this all day.

Proper cooling system to prevent overheating issues | No | Yes

"Don't know why everyone thinks of the centre touchscreen as a big pro. It has an infuriating lack of tactile feedback. You HAVE to look at it to adjust something about your car. Not to mention it still floods the interior with light during the night, which decreases the visibility of the road.

Why can't Tesla have some knobs for stuff like volume, air vents, and so on. The touchscreen is crap if you live somewhere cold and have to wear thick gloves until the interior warms up."
"> More then 500 units

Than."
touchscreen lol coz that's the only thing tesla got
"Also, the Tesla is electric.  Just a little quirk I thought deserved mentioning."
im actually really dissapointed by that cup holder part. thats a basic amenity
"> More then 500 units - Tesla - Yes	

Not today. "
TIL zero units is more than 500 units.
You have a weird way of pronouncing Byron
">  but this is just like the ""don't buy the current Samsung phone model because they'll significantly upgrade it in a year or two, and then you'll feel like you totally missed out on the new feature"" thing. 

Not at all.  You're comparing something that won't be available for another 3+ years to something that's been produced since last year.  It's like comparing the Galaxy S5 to the iPhone X a few years ago and pretending there's nothing else Samsung will bring out before the iPhone X comes out."
"You know there's more than one version of the Veyron, right?"
Nor did I say they would.  The point was that the Chiron will likely have a Grand Sport/Super Sport model coming out around 2020 that will throw this whole comparison out the window.
The roadster is meant to compete with other similarly priced *electric* supercars. Still will not be able to touch ICE/hybrid super cars on the track for a while 
"Tesla could make the cooling system work for a track, but they already lose money when production is at it's most efficient, and 4999/5000 won't be track-ed. I'm sure many know this, including you; Just feel I should state it for the people who think it's an electric motor/battery limitation."
You don't buy a Bugatti for the track though. 
[deleted]
[deleted]
Will it though? Hypothetically speaking.
"An MX5 would murder a heavy EV on a race track. Tesla fans are getting into the wrong pissing contests. Tesla have an awesome product but people here bullshit about the weight being ""advantageous"" on racetracks which is utter bullshit. 

If someone buys either a Tesla or Bugatti with track times in mind they're a moron with more dollars than brain cells. "
We don‚Äôt know what the Roadster will do on a track yet so let‚Äôs not make claims one way or the other yet.
"Lol it probably wouldn't make it around the track without needing 10k+ in maintenance. In contrast, I've driven the original roadster around a track and it's not bad at all."
"Buy a supercart for 15k and you will beat a bugatti on any track.   

So will cars like an ariel atom

If u want a track car, buy a track car"
"‚Ä¶and then they'll buy one and add it to their collection. These people aren't hampered by indecision. If they can't decide, they buy both. "
"It's *highly* improbable that the Roadster will be more comfortable than the Bugatti, however. "
"Just read it on some german website:

>Durchschnittlich 42 Fahrzeuge besitzt jeder Chiron-Kunde. 2,7 Privat-Jets kommen dazu, au√üerdem noch 1,2 Yachten, 3,2 Helikopter und 4,6 Immobilien.

"Ohio State's electric land speed car is capable of 341mph and it has no cooling system at all, so I doubt battery life will be a problem in reaching high speeds"
"Yup, they don't right up until they do,then you guys try to scramble to find something else so you don't have to change."
Until it runs out of gas
"There's also a reason why every major car reviewer tests manufacturers claims as well, like 1/4 mile and 0-100s."
"I wasn't commenting on all electric cars, I was commenting on Tesla.

The Chiron is also street legal."
I'll take that bet.  There is no way that Tesla gets this out in 3 years.
"assuming it ever gets made, that's the point"
I doubt Tesla will even be able to make enough to keep up with demand. 
"that means nothing lol

going from prototype to road-going, cars have to undergo tons of re-working to make sure they meet all regulations and are actually viable to put into production. "
Tesla hasn't done much. Except lose even more money than their earnings report indicated while manufacturing fewer vehicles.
"Perhaps you missed the whole thing where Tesla just upgraded all 100D owner‚Äôs cars OTA for free with a second improvement to 0-60 time?  
Yes, Tesla loves hype about future products, and for a company that is out to change the automotive landscape through their PR machine approach to business, that is how it must be done.  
Please don‚Äôt discount the huge achievements they‚Äôve made in very short time though."
I'm sure you can imagine how few fucks the average driver gives for whether or not they can take their car to the track.
"The driver hints at track capability, [faster acceleration than a Ferrari FXX-K](https://youtu.be/wrCd3SWawYw?t=3m15s), and [can corner.](https://youtu.be/M70vI5iBltk?t=3m25s).
The same size brakes as the LaFerrari too.

It's still early, we will see more info during the two years from now. "

"> but some people just seem to get too caught up.

pretty much South Park Prius episode "
">poor build quality

>JesusChrysler"
Exactly. The batteries can‚Äôt sustain heavy use. It‚Äôs impossible to disperse the heat generated.
"Not exactly a great argument in favour of EVs then.

""they're the best... As long as you only do one specific thing with it."" "
"I'm sure they would have used dynamic cooling with body-flaps, if air-flow through radiators were the only limiting factor. I think the current battery packs are just not build to exhaust heat that fast. 

This might also be the reason why this model begins at double the battery size of the current top model."
The new roadster is 26% less efficient than model 3 LR. So don't be so sure about Tesla tuning the new roadster for efficiency.
I can almost guarantee a 50k Audi will have a higher quality interior than the roadster.
You're looking at it as someone who can't afford a Bugatti. 
Quite sure the Roadster will also have some incredible wait times too...
It‚Äôs equally as wrong when other media outlets brand competitors as Tesla killers. 
As if Bugatti wants to lose their exclusivity in the first place...
...and why would Bugatti drop their price?
Lets not forget the owners fearmongering of AI 
"Are you talking about Tesla or Volkswagen? Because VW has a massive history of class action lawsuits. And that was before the whole emissions scandal.

This was honestly a genuine question. I didn't know tesla had so many lawsuits.

Also, bugatti is owned by VW."
"I know why people hate Tesla it's because they are challenging the status quo. And people who want to keep breathing smog hate them for it. Legacy car makers keep fighting the ""people's right"" to poison the atmosphere. Nissan I like Nissan I think their new leaf is good some would question the range but I think that is an american limited problem and releasing a longer range for america will solve it. Ford they should have ramp up the chevy bolt to half a million per year already they are an experienced manufacturer why can't they do that. Tesla have trouble delivering model 3 but what is worst is not even trying. The more EV that is manufactured the less smog in the cities it is that simple. If Toyota changes their mind and manufacture millions of EV per year then I will cheer loudly for them."
"ICEs are shit, do you own one?"
"No way. Tesla and their products and fans have no value and must die. How dare they even attempt this fun comparison.

https://streamable.com/0e3c5

/thread"
That‚Äôs too logical.
Cool. I'm saying those numbers for the bugatti are actually current and verifiable. The roadster values are little more than speculation at this point.
"At this very moment the waiting time for the Roadster is 3 years, roughly. That's the same waiting time as the super exclusive Koenigsegg cars. And Koenigsegg Agera RS destroyed two very big Bugatti records just recently. Not to mention that Ragera will begin to be delivered in the next three years too, and that will hit 250mph in 20 seconds. The Roadster will not be able to come even close to those sort of performance numbers, as the Ragera employs the best of both electric and IC engines."
"Even an R8 would and you would be saving money.

"
Also the Dodge Deamon and also the rumors of the Ford Mustang Shelby 500 and it cost less than Tesla.
In what category?
"It's just to much for what it is. You can get speed, comfort, and better style for cheaper on many other cars. I am not saying Telsa is a bad car, well their interiors are ugly as hell but that's something else. For a sub 100K daily driver I would love one, but not this."
8.8 on low profile sport cup 2s. Incredible. 
Hard to compare something that can be purchased to something that exists only as a concept.
Comparisons of a car that's not going into production for 3+ years that has nothing besides manufacturer claims to a car that's in production and has been driven by multiple independent parties?  Yes.
"Let's compare a Honda Civic Touring Editon with a Model 3.........which one has more features? better QA? and wayyyyyyyy cheaper? lol......

You tesla fanboys are truly priceless lmao. You pick a chose your battles. "
"Entire thread is basically https://streamable.com/0e3c5

Someone should have installed a super cooler at the entrance before it went out of hand. "
"Because the Roadster has never been tested by an unbiased third party (1), isn't available for purchase (2) and it's much, much easier to make an electric car reach these performance figures than a traditional, mechanical car. Electric cars get instant torque, and don't even have gears (I don't need to tell you that changing gears takes time, even for the fastest transmissions, and a car can't accelerate i.e. increase speed while the engine is shifting gears. Electric cars don't have this problem since they have only one ""gear"") (3). It's like comparing the accuracy of a digital Casio watch with the accuracy of a mechanical Patek Phillippe watch. Of course the Casio is more accurate."
It was a drag-coefficient comparison between the Semi and the Chiron.
"In the future, no one makes profits and cars will all be electric getting to 60 in under 3 seconds. "
Ok.  How about right this minute?  How long?  I'm not trolling.  I really want to see this tech succeed. 
"Hence my second point. But this post makes zero sense because these 2 are cars in different realms.

Its like saying a toyota prius is better than a rolls royce because its cheaper to maintain"
Literally the top 5 posts from all time are about positive tesla images what are you even talking about 
"The 620mi estimate is highway speed, is that the same for the Bugatti? Or is that the EPA weighted average?"
"To be fair, that's the Veyron not the Chiron which has [different tires and a more durable design](https://www.motor1.com/news/180923/bugatti-chiron-tires-cost/)"

"Yes.

Range and speed of charge is going to be the biggest obstacle to getting the general public on board with electric vehicles. Until you can charge a battery in less than 5 minutes, it's going to be a hard sell."
It is if it's electric
"i mean honestly my biggiest issue with the electric car is the range. i live in a major city/use public transit, a bike, or walk so the only time i use a car is roadtrips/distance. 

Not only does it take much longer to charge then it does to fill up a gas tank the entire roadnetwork is already set up for gas fueling stations. Idk how u could set up an infrastructure for electric cars, like even if u have tons of charging points even if they got way better u r still looking at 30 mins to an hour of charge time. 

Maybe if they redesigned them to have like removable batteries or something. Stations could be set up on highways where they exchange batteries. Something like how propane tanks work, but i think they r just way too big/would require a trained person to do it at these stations. They need batteries like the size/power of the ones from titanfall 2."

Those better be ludicrous blowjobs

It is still crap and you know it.
"I mean they accomplished the same feet much sooner. And the veyron, or a koenigsegg can go to a track day, pound around the track all day without overheating(something model S‚Äôs can be handicapped by) and then be driven home. 

And from purely a driving enthusiasts standpoint, the numbers only tell half the story. A gasoline engine will always have more character than an electric motor and until batteries become significantly lighter, they will always pollute the handling of the car."
No those are production cars not one off prototypes built to be as impressive they can be. The roadster doesn‚Äôt exist. The models you mentioned exist
">Ferrari doesn‚Äôt build drag racing machines. They build race cars that happen to have pretty good drag racing performances.

And that's why Tesla poached [their race driver.](https://youtu.be/M70vI5iBltk?t=3m25s)"

"Thanks, that make sense"
Ah thanks!
"how can they fit that much battery? i thought the tesla s would be totally full, it's bigger too!"
"Higher top speeds with less battery strain.

Could also increase acceleration."
So then what is it? 
Because one is not in the same category as the other. 
Me wants 
The future is Tesla. 
"Really? Because no one has seen one, it hasn't been tested on a track. It only exists on paper. NIO has a track only car that's 1.4 million with performance that pales in comparison to what he's claiming. As of right now, it's just one of many of his grandiose claims.

He's full of shit, he can't even build enough damn batteries right now."
thank you!
Can you clarify? I don't understand your comment. So you mean a Model compared to it's older self?  That makes sense because you are showing the change not trying to say Car X is better than Car Y's model 3 years from now 
Will you buy it for me? 
"No like, i want to see it doing these numbers. Not specs also, i want to see how much range it gives at 100mph.. these cars are good but... I think these specs are a little misleading."
Its all carbon and hydrogen....
It's already bought.
Why? That roadster looks badass. 
Mod note: removed for rudeness/reddiquette. Further violations will lead to a ban.
You must be a real car guy. 
It's got a super quick 0-60 and a fast top speed. Compared to other cars around that price point that would be much better on a track and have close 0-60s.
"I don't think that's it. I think it has something to do with the amount of wear to the motor or something handling that much bottom-end torque. Yes it will drain the battery as well as heat it up, but I think there's more to it than that. "
"I test drove their 4 door luxury sedan back in 2015. Beautiful, spacious interior, insane torque, looked great from the outside... but good god was it bulky. I had driven German made previous (Audi, bmw) so perhaps I was just spoiled, but I just couldn't get behind it."
yes i am
[this guy] (https://youtu.be/BfDRT_BwkbE?t=1m33s) sounds pretty impressed.
"I honestly don't know much about Tesla cars. It is not something I am interested in.

I met one of Tesla's marketing and PR people once (for real, was with a team in Nevada demonstrating the car at a rally) and he was such an aloof, condescending prick that it impacted my whole outlook on the brand. One of those pudgy guys in a men's warehouse get-up that had some college degree/contacts but not much technological insight, or genuine interest in the car. I was cleaning my own car and walked over to introduce myself and asked if the drive circuits had different power distribution than the accessory package. He made some smirking remark about how ""everybody's first question is about how far it will go..."" and turned his back on me. I knew he didn't know two things: 1) much about the car  - and - 2) how to interact with people in other disciplines.

So, to hell with that business...That might not be fair or rational, but you know what?...my resources are mine to manage and I'll buy what I want and drive what I wish to.

For what they cost, I'll take a nice late model Lexus with enough left over to buy one for my kid too."
"Nah, its the name 100%. People buy extremely expensive things to show you how much more they can freely spend than you can. That's why we have expensive things."
That's my point exactly. Tesla is giving us cherry-picked numbers. How many 0-60's can it do on the trot before the battery packs heats up and the performance is throttled. How many 'supercharges' can it take before the battery is thrashed.. And so on. 
"Stfu that's not what I ment. They literally have to sit there and idle to warm ""charge"" up before it's at it's full potential. Smh"
Maybe. I think they‚Äôd get just as many at $500k
True! I‚Äôd love to know how much NRE goes into a car like this. 
And why do you say that?
Mod note: removed for rudeness/reddiquette. Further violations will lead to a ban.
Which law of physics stops this from being a better car than anything below 200k? If every car up to 200k was better and cheaper than their CBE equivalents than wouldn't that be the end of the CBE era?
this is all combustion engine could do in over 100 yrs but EV is doing this within few years.

For real though, Bugatti mostly is the show-off company for Volkswagen-Tech. Unless VW starts pushing e-cars, you won't see much e-tech in Bugattis."
The heat to get to that speed though. Don't know how well tesla cooling is now. 
Clearly all of us who are alive now were in fact *not* limited by the rubber. 
lmao condom reference?
[Perfect](https://i.makeagif.com/media/10-02-2015/xShB_5.gif)
"it's actually not. the tires are literally limiting the speed they can reach. therefore, limited by the rubber"
There is less wear/friction on rubber on a super light car like the Agera as opposed to the monster that all Bugatti's are. 
Here have an √ú to copy in your text.
You dont need performance tires when the performance rubber is on the track 
"Bugatti literally needs better rubber since the car can do more, but at full tilt you a)eat the tires and b)lose grip."
The rubber. It can't grip well enough to keep up with the car. 
3D printing isn't a manufacturing process. 
"Surely there are smart people whose entire careers have been spent researching and trying to build better tires. I'm not trying to be a jerk but like, if you came up with the idea off the top of your head I'm sure there's a reasons they aren't doing it. "
So remove the tires
It burns through it‚Äôs specially designed tires at an incredible rate.
I've seen this a couple times. Why does rubber/tires hold it back? I've been trying to think about it and I can think of rubber being high friction at top speeds (but that's good for acceleration and handling). I can't think of why that'd hold it back?

Speeds above 120 mph are pretty common on the Autobahn.
"You‚Äôre never gonna go that fast, but you can say that your car could"
I go above 120 Atleast once a week ...
"I feel like this is a very American viewpoint.

Source: American "
"I've done 145, my older brother and I had an argument I won about 1) whether a cavalier could do it and 2) whether there was a limiter in them.

I'm reasonably confident it was slightly more than 145 but that's when the speedometer called it quits. 

In a cavalier at those speeds, it's a bit like simulating what The Flash must be feeling as he vibrates fast enough to time travel. 

Edit: I haven't had the car in a very long time; a quick Google suggests most commenters are correct, and I've likely juxaposed speedometers in my memory. That said, I definitely pushed a cavalier to the ""blank"" beyond its maximum marking, which would be 120. I would've sworn it was 130; I'll spend a few minutes tonight confirming my model year wasn't an exception, but it was a stock car. I'd gone to the dealership and asked for the cheapest four door car they had on the lot _right now_ and that's what I'd left with."
[deleted]
"Aside from the reasons others have pointed out, there's also some argument for a very high top end related to the functions of the engine/motor.  It's also the answer to ""If the fastest we can legally travel is X, why can cars even *go* X+1?""

The more powerful the engine is, the less any given speed is going to tax it.  A car that can only do 60 has to push itself hard to do 60.  A car that can push 300 is going to have a much easier time pushing 60, and can likely do so with greater efficiency.

Relating it directly to the top end is sorta a strange argument with other factors, but if it's just a function of the car's design because it's got power to spare, there's a fair bit of benefit from such designs."
"I've been over 120 several times, once for an hour in a rally. It is exhilarating, in the properly prepared car.

In a regular car, it's foolishness."
Cars with higher than legal performance potential makes driving within legal limits really comfortable. Driving a car that fast probably makes 65mph feel like 20mph.
Who? Teenagers and young adults. Track day enthusiasts. Adrenaline junkies. People who like showing off. A shit ton of people would drive that fast.
"> acclelerstion

what?"
Because math. My guess is someone who knows the power output of the engine and the weight of the car + a driver made an equation to figure out roughly what the maximum speed is
"Mercedes recently hit 50% efficiency on a 1.6 litre ICE (Around 1000bhp). Part of their F1 project I believe, so this isn't really realistic for road conditions but perhaps a sign of the future."
"I think the problem the above commenter is pointing out, is that an ICE car can‚Äôt be both *powerful* and *effecient* at the same time. The Bugatti has a huge 16 cylinder engine, you‚Äôll never be able to make it as efficient as a Golf GTI for everyday commuting. 

With batteries and electric motors, you can have your cake and eat it too. Power and efficiency in the same package. It‚Äôs fundamentally quite easy to make an electric car more powerful while also maintaining efficiency, the opposite of ICE cars. "
"I was going to say the same thing. I‚Äôll bet right now they are working with their own engineers and those at Cal-Tech to start working on the Aluminum Hydride batteries, three times the electrons and it honestly doesn‚Äôt weigh that much more. Also aluminum doesn‚Äôt explode or catch fire like lithium hydrides do.

Mark my words. Next 5 years."
EV is about 2/3rd more efficient as an ice vehicle. If energy density reaches about 30% that of gas it can deliver about the same performance with the same mass as gas. 
"Theoretical max for lithium air is 46.8 MJ per kg, aluminum air theoretical max is 29 MJ per kg. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246802571730081X"
"This was on top gear right? I believe they said that the tires last 15 minutes at top speed (and cost a whopping $42,000 to replace!)"
How long can the Tesla run at top speed I wonder
That might not be as daft as you think. Compare what we have to batteries from 50 years ago when I was a kid. Now add in the exponential advances possible in the next 50. Who knows? 
"Why is that so far fetched? What do you know about the technologies in development of the potential for batteries? The energy density of gas is a constant, the potential for other forms of storage is unkown.

Also due to efficiency an battery needs to be ""only"" 30% as energy dense to deliver the same performance with the same mass as the gas equivalent. "
Tires are the reason it's limited to the speed it is. Tires are only rated for a certain speed. They'd open themselves up to lawsuits if the car could go faster then the tires could handle from the factory.

so travelling at 250+ mph is legal?
Drag is not exponential. With constant drag coefficient (a huge assumption here at those speeds) drag is quadratic. It is nowhere near exponential.
"I guess in that one very specific instance where you're trying to race a Columbian druglord's plane before it takes off it would be useful. But in day-to-day life, you'd be lucky to break 130 MPH and not go to jail."

"If the semi had motors in the trailer bed as well (like for container shipping), and some batteries, then in theory, you could hook up several trailers together (like in the outback), with one driver/can, and be even more effecient while not sacrificing any perfomance (because of more motors/batteries)"

It's because they were getting wheel slip until around 180 mph if they pushed it hard and there was no need to give a massive shock to the drivetrain at low speeds when only going for a top speed run.
"Oh they absolutely held back until then. I think that‚Äôs what made the run even more impressive is how unexpected it was. I guess it‚Äôs also a little safer to have sudden acceleration in a higher gear too, especially on an uneven public road"
"Yes! I apologize; I worded that poorly. It was absolutely intentional; I meant it to sound like, ""It has an insane amount of headroom left, even at 180mph."""
Absolutely. A standard family car can do 0-60 faster than they do in that video. The car took 12-13 seconds to reach 60 in the video.
"That also freaked me out initially. They had a 7-mile track. So even at 280mph the entire way, it'd only take you 90 seconds to cross the entire breadth.

This thing has great brakes and these guys are professionals, but I would've peed my pants a bit."
"Nah, he was slowing down very controlled and gradually.  Plenty of time to see the semi and stop accordingly.  "
"That's exactly what I was saying; it strolls to 180mph at a leisurely pace (however leisurely you can consider 180mph), but it has so much throttle left that it *really* gets going at 190mph ([they wrote 190mph](http://www.koenigsegg.com/koenigsegg-agera-rs-achieves-multiple-production-car-world-speed-records/)):

> We had a lot of road at our disposal **and there is no need to stress the engine at low speeds**. You will see that when Niklas needs the power, at around 190 mph ‚Äì **that‚Äôs when he gives the car full throttle** and the rate of acceleration becomes very rapid."
"Maybe? I don't know. Does even Tesla know, for a car that's not coming out for 3 years? 

"
"True; Koenigsegg says it was for the engine, according to the press release (I quoted it above/below this comment), but they had Michelin people checking the tires each run, so I could definitely see that."
"Think about how low the CoM is in Teslas. I bet we'll be surprised, based on how well the model x handles. "
"What's reasonable about that comment? Numbers on a car that doesn't exist yet can't make a *company* look great. Only actually getting that car out could, and that's still ways off.  

Posts like these are about having fun in anticipation. It has nothing to do with the quality of the internal workings of the company. That's a massive straw-man."
Then it's probably more fair to compare it to an actually comparable car then I guess
Well the OP sort of compares it to a race car so that sets the tone for the conversation in the comments. It's unfair only to compare it to race cars when it makes the roadster look good and then defend its deficiencies by saying it's not a race car.
"While we‚Äôre talking about ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù stats, gas cars still have one of the biggest advantages, and that‚Äôs ‚Äúcharging‚Äù time. 

You‚Äôre gonna have a hard time selling the general populace on long charge times for at least a few years still. 

Edit: I‚Äôm not saying electric cars don‚Äôt have great range or that people can‚Äôt charge at night, but people think weirdly. It‚Äôll take a while before people accept it, that‚Äôs my point. "
"Funny thing is that in Germany a fair number of people DO hit 150mph daily. Driving on Autobahn at 80mph you'd see people passing you on the left as if you were standing still. Most German cars are electronically limited to 155mph because of that - it is a safety feature to prevent untrained people to go too fast on the Autobahn. You can get the limiter removed if you have a racing license or undergo additional training though. A lot of people that own cars capable of even higher speeds do that to unlock the full potential.

It is a strange feeling when you are hitting the electronic limiter, and a Porsche behind you is flashing its lights to tell you to move over to the slow lane because you aren't going fast enough."
"Are you in the target market for the roadater?

If so, why not take it to track every now and then?"
60-150 is important for when you need to accelerate on the highway
[deleted]
"as you said, 150mph in Europe, but my experience is you can rarely do it for long stretches since you are going so fast that the 10km between German road works goes by very quick. I love German roads, but between the 130 limit for cities and roadworks its a lot of fast then slow, fast, slow, roadworks traffic jam, fast ....."
"Let me move the goal post to acceleration from 0-60, then. That's where TRUE acceleration is found and where the REAL fun is. /s"
"What do you mean? Can't you experience it daily? Even on a trip to the store?

The top speed is the thing you'll never get to experience."
Every red light 
"That sure did! And the 0-200 number is based off their quarter mile time. I figured out how fast the car was going at the end of the race, and it was just over 200 mph. 
I totally do see why the roadster would fall behind in an actual race, and really only win on a straight away. Thanks for the help!"
"The average speed on the autobahn in free flowing conditions was measured to be less than 90 mph. Also, I doubt it would be made such a big deal if it was only a relevant detail for people in germany"
Car that doesn't exist yet can't go around a lap *or* overheat
Any reason to think that? Musk has publicly said that the baseline will go 250 and there will be options for higher top speeds. Does Tesla/Musk have a history of overpromising performance?
I don't think it will make a difference.
[deleted]
"To be fair, if you had to trust someone with coming up with a solution to a problem..."
Teslas have transmissions?
How do you know the Tesla‚Äôs top speed isn‚Äôt also limited by its tires?
"I know you're just explaining and not justifying, but I have a good feeling that's a bullshit narrative from Bugatti."
"They were doing hard launches all night and the guy giving test rides claimed they were all under 1.9s....but I want to see a VBOX first, haha."
"Even if they can get the motors and batteries cooled enough to maintain speed, a 600+ mile range (with conservative driving) on current and near-future batteries means *a lot* of batteries. Curb weight on the long range Model 3 is brushing up against 2 tons with half the range. Double the amount batteries and most are expected to see weight figures near 5,000 lbs on the Roadster.

High weight + high velocity = **very high** momentum. That very negatively affects braking and cornering, which are the most important parts of road circuit driving.

This car isn't going to be a track car. It will eat up almost anything you throw at it in a straight line, but it's not going to be a happy car in the corners or braking zones."
I am not a fan of NASCAR but imagine having a race with Tesla's like NASCAR; I'd watch that. To keep them charging just throw in full batteries in the back to keep charging while driving. I'm sure it might not work but the idea is cool.
"[Here's another monster diffuser](http://www.rssportscars.com/photos/news/aston-martin-racing-unveils/2016-V8-Vantage-GTE-Tail.jpg)

Not comparable, but still sweet."
Why are you being down voted?  That car is a terrible track car. 
"Wait a second, did you just try to point out that aerodynamics hurt track performance?  Everything aero that helps range also helps speed.  Active aero trades off speed and range for more grip on both cars, and neither is intentionally slowing itself with permanent bad-aero-design for the sake of moving more slowly."
It‚Äôs more like comparing a car I‚Äôll maybe be able to drive at 1/3rd of it‚Äôs top speed if I‚Äôm lucky to a car I‚Äôll never have the chance to drive. 
"The Chiron was late 2016, you're thinking of the veyron "
The Bugatti Chiron is almost a brand new car...
"I'll admit I don't know a ton about cars, but it seems like the Ferarri is expensive because it's old and has a lot of value to collectors, not for its driving performance. The Bugatti is a modern car which seems to be designed to perform well and for the luxury appeal. 

I think another way to illustrate how silly the Roadster/Chiron comparison is is to look at a 15 fold price difference in the other direction. There's not much designed for performance at 1/15th of 200,000, but even at 1/8  you might get into the low end with maybe a Scion tC or a Nissan Z, which would both seem kind of ridiculous to compare to the Roadster."
"You're supposed to be comparing retail prices; convert what the retail price of a 62 GTO 250 would cost in today's money. 
What someone would pay for one at an auction shouldn't count.  
Edit: I'll bet anything that 62 GTO wasn't close to $200,000, even after conversion into ""today's equivalent"" in the money's worth.  
Edit 2: the 62 was only $18,000, retail. That's *really* not much, when you could buy quite a few (loaded out) cars that were between 5K-8K at the time. Hell, my replica cost more. "
I always tell people just test drive a Model S and decide for yourself if you live near a dealership. There's zero pressure to buy and it's a fun car to drive.
Not to mention the probably don‚Äôt even know the max even with a theorized top speed. They‚Äôve talked about this before it‚Äôs like asking a submarine captain how deep can it go and they really couldn‚Äôt tell you

"Have you actually driven a Tesla? IMO the touchscreen is a plus; before I bought it I thought it would be a minus because, yeah, obviously tactile would be better, but in practice I find the Tesla touchscreen far superior to any normal interior I've experienced. First of all, the common things you want tactile feedback for already are tactile (volume scrollwheel on steering wheel along with next/prev track, for example, which honestly is like 90% of my non-driving interaction with the car), and phone and navigation (and also specific streaming song selection) is through voice control (9% of my non-driving interaction), leaving only very rarely accessed controls to be actually used through the touchscreen. Even then I prefer the touchscreen, as it's usually pretty easy to find the control you need without too much trouble, whereas god forbid you have to find the one button out of a hundred on a normal console that does something you've only done once or twice before. Plus, you'll have to decipher what all the silly icons mean in a traditional car: an A with a circle around it? A picture of a car with a squiggly line under it?

I would agree that there are a few minor controls that are a bit annoying on the tesla: e.g. you can get at fan speed and temp through the steering wheel controls but it's clumsy, so you have to use the screen, but usually those kinds of controls are near the bezel of the screen and it's easy to feel with your thumb. And it's far superior than hunting for rarely used knobs and buttons imo. 

And the light of the screen dims automatically at night; it's literally never been an issue with regards to flooding the interior or decreasing road visibility for me. 

Touchscreen is I guess crap if you are wearing gloves (I actually have some of those gloves that conduct electricity or whatever so I can use my iPhone - of course also works with the car), but again, the vast majority of the time I'm not using it anyway because the controls are on the steering wheel or over voice control. In any case, since it's a Tesla you probably told the car to warm itself up while you were still at home or in the restaurant. "

"Only half of this comparison. Chiron GS/SS won't have 4 seats, won't have more than 620 miles of range and will still cost 3mil."
"Then why make this infographic? 

Since the comparison is being made, it is 100% logical to pick apart the argument. "
"I feel like a big part of the problem (other than, as you said, the price) is probably aerodynamics. 

For a cooling system, you want as much air flow over as much surface area as possible to take away the heat. This pretty clearly comes into direct conflict with making a car as smooth as possible so it knifes through the air with maximum efficiency (which is a huge part of how Tesla manages to squeeze so much range out of their cars). "
A lot of people would buy a hypercar for track days though. 
"Well that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm poor. If I had ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù money, I‚Äôd certainly buy a Bugatti for the track. "
"Yup. You buy a Bugatti because you‚Äôre rich and live in Dubai. Not because you want a nice track car. (Although I‚Äôm sure people do take them on tracks, just buying it specifically for a track is a waste). "
"And you don't buy a tesla for a track day. The batteries will get overheated and drop in performance. 

So a electric car can only do a track for a short time, while a petrol engine can go pretty much all day. "
"The type of person with a Bugatti has at least half a dozen cars they rotate through, or big collections like Jay Leno. They absolutely all go racing them once in a while. It doesn't mean they only buy it to race it."
"That's because 98% of r/teslamotors readers don't know jack shit about cars.

They just upvote everything that makes Tesla look good lol. These guys are keyboard drivers.

Both the Bugatti and likely the Roadster will get murdered on track by a car with slower acceleration numbers, where weight and aero are king."

Bugatti didn't bring up the comparison..
"Tell that to anyone who watched the Veyron Supersport destroy the Top Gear Test Track in season 15, going faster than any other car before it.

It's got track chops, but it's not a track car."
"The Bugatti is a performance monster. It's not built to be a track car, it's built to be extremely powerful, fast and luxurious. It is all of those things and is monstrously fast in a straight line. It's hilarious that you're implying it isn't. "
"Well in order to get the claimed 200kWh battery, you're looking at about 1300lbs. of battery alone . Now obviously things could hypothetically get much lighter by 2020 but it would have to be significant. It's also likely going to lack any type of performance aero design as well to increase range. 

Plus it's not a terribly expensive car and the batteries are going to consume a considerable portion of that price, so there's not a ton left for the R&D required to make the suspension supercar worthy."
"You're not wrong but unless they have some groundbreaking technology to make it lighter, and suddenly decide they want to redesign the whole car to give it better aerodynamic properties, this is the extremely likely outcome."
"Sure, but what if you want a trackable car you can also drive on a daily basis?"

"""I‚Äôm going to buy this because of what others might think"" is driving the majority of sales in that price segment."
"You‚Äôve got a hefty case of the fanboy‚Äôs going on there.  Batteries still need to go through another order of magnitude or two of improvement before they‚Äôre fully ready to take over, and even then - when they will have massive advantages in many areas - they will still fall short of chemical fuels in many ways.  Rapid sustained discharge is quite likely to remain one of those. That‚Äôs just how it is, until we move a few paradigm shifts worth of tech past where we are now.  You don‚Äôt need to be offended by it."
"Yes because we're all driving $3 million Bugattis. Pretty much no one on this sub will even be able to afford the roadster, if its ever even produced.

Not to mention the bogus 1/4 mile time claimed."

"> average driver

Yes. But this conversation is about supercar owners. Many many supercar owners like to track their cars. :P "
"A $200,000 car isn‚Äôt targeting the average driver. Anything you‚Äôre cross-shopping against in that price range is track capable and people buying that stuff *do* care. There‚Äôs a reason the 911 is the gold standard that manufacturers aim to beat in that bracket and it‚Äôs not its straight line acceleration they‚Äôre trying to beat. "
"I did hear him say that, but I want to see what it'll do on a really challenging track.

If it truly doesn't overheat, I'm totally going to give a nod to this thing as a total performance BEAST for all things. 

I do hope it's trackable, because then I'll toss it on my purchase list. "
"But it's also a car that exists.  Comparing the Roadster to anything is a fool's game right now, because nothing that Musk has touted about it can be remotely verified."
">It‚Äôs impossible to disperse the heat generated.

The NIO EP9 would like a word with you.

I'm not saying the roadster will match it, but it proves that sustained high performance is possible, and with a notably smaller battery than what the roadster will have."
It's not impossible just expensive. The large pack already solve a lot of the heating problem. It reduces the current drawn per cell. It also reduce internal resistance and increases thermal capacity. Supercritical fluid cooling can remove large amount of heat. Super capacitor buffer to stop regen heating. Heat pump to increase radiator efficiency. All expensive stuff but will definitely solve the heat problem.
"It all depends on what you want, for a track car EVs are not there.  If you want a weekender then it could be a great car. "
"If it performs as expected it's a bit of a one trick pony, but it's a hell of a trick. There's definitely a niche for a car like this, but I think it's still somewhat far from making ICE performance cars obsolete. "
I've been in Acuras with better quality interiors.
Might even be less than that. Look at the higher trim GTIs and Golf Rs
"Worked at Audi as a tech. The interiors last for about 3-5 years depending on use, then the stitching starts to get bad, the seats start cracking, they easily scratch. The roof liners are really difficult to clean, so make sure not to stain them. The plastic tabs that hold pieces together get soft and brittle....

Maybe they've gotten better since 2011, but overall, volkswagen makes cars that have good initial quality and then fall apart right after the warranty expires."

It sounds like you've been driving the wrong ICEs.
"Not arguing with the numbers, they've always been amazing. What is more amazing though is how little difference there is between a car I simply couldn't afford and one I potentially could. That's why it is all over for the ICEV. The Chiron is a great swan-song for the ICEV showing what can be achieved with the application of incredible effort to something that is amazing it works at all."
"That V10 sound doe. Seriously, if I was in position for a supercar I would definitely buy an Audi V10+ "
The R8 is such a lifeless boat of a car hahaha.
Literally every category except 0-60 and the 1/4.  
"Those things called ""turns"""
"In the category where you take the car out for a track day and go do laps until the gas tank is empty. Teslas so far overheat well before they can finish a couple of laps at top performance. The Roadster MIGHT be different, but I have my doubts until we see actual track tests.

And before you say it - the average driver doesn't really take their car to the track. A driver that buys as $200k sports car is most likely going to, though."
"But you can't get more speed for less, and that's a sticky point. It's hard to debate comfort since it's not available yet. There's certainly advantages to be had with the weight distribution of a car, but I doubt it will be comfortable if the suspension will be able to handle a 9 second quarter mile.

I've only ever the inside of my Model S so I can't say much for the roadsters. I greatly enjoy my interior. It's simple and sleek with all the options you'd expect in a premium vehicle.

All that aside, 200k is far too much for an all electric car."
Its like saying the iPhone 12 is better than any Android device on the market.
"Especially with the unfolding Model 3 debacle, this can't be overstated.

No . Do you have a Bugatti in your driveway? Same argument right?
"I think it's a bit early to assume it will never release, no? Tesla Model S and X were both delayed but inevitably came to full scale production. I'm not aware of any Tesla prototypes that came this far since Model S only to not go into full production."
"Makes sense, thanks for that."
"There's plenty of tracks near where I live. People take all types of cars, not just cars built for racing. I see cameros, mustangs, Hondas... Etc. Idk why a tesla wouldn't fit in"
My advice. Do a testdrive once in a Model S with the dual motors. You'll be blown away the second you start driving and take your first turns :) The intelligent air suspension and electric motors which handle each wheel axle separately will always calculate and use maximum efficiency. When taking a sharp turn for instance the air suspension will shift the weight inside the turn so if goes really smooth without wheel spin while at the same time the wheels calculate and use more power from the front motor to pull the car inside it's turn instead of pushing it from the back which in return is also more efficient for turns and comfortable even at higher speeds. I can't speak about Tesla's future but you probably know which brand I'm betting for in 2020 ;)
Yeah my kid is only going to have posters of horse drawn carriages and Amish girls on his wall
How long do you wait for your phone to charge?  Or do you just plug it in at night?
"Well good news, Teslas charge faster than any other electric car."
Or maybe we just get some common sense knocked back into us and build a proper railroad system for public transportation and forget about the whole owning a car thing?
"Day to day it's not really a thing since you've got a full charge every morning or after work (yes, not everyone has reasonable access to a wall outlet at this stage, a fair limitation to acknowledge). But your commute sounds like mine - I kept it plugged in at home and bussed to work. (good lord parking fees are ridiculous)

 I did somewhere around 20,000 miles of road tripping in my Tesla over 2 years. Most stops are already short enough you don't notice, meal stops take you longer than the car takes (and shortens your in betweens) and thanks to having extra breaks, you can make about the same mileage in a day of driving. It'd be stupid to say the logistics are the same as gas-powered road trips but I've done it *a lot* and it's not just viable; it's comfortable. 

Also yeah, Backcountry backpacking or like fully disconnecting from society for a week might not be a thing for a while, but I haven't had any problem with out of the way stuff yet. "

"Thing is, Ferrari is bigger then any race driver that helps them build cars.

"
"We also don't know about it actually achieving any of the figures listed, but that's not stopping the comparisons."
Same can be said for the Bugatti 
From what people have gathered they are using a much denser battery pack or a different configuration around the car
"Internal combustion engines only generate good power in a very narrow range of rpms. That range is significantly lower than what you need for operation everywhere between 0 and 100 mph. So the engineering fix is to add a transmission. 

Electric motors have an astoundingly wide range for their power curve and there is very little lost efficiency across 0-100. The extra efficiency you could squeeze out by having a transmission is eaten up by the transmission weight, so it is a net loss. The trick that isn‚Äôt a net loss is if you want all wheel drive, and you just have two separate motors front and rear. The rear is tuned for lower speed acceleration and the front is tuned for high speed cruising. 

That being said, I‚Äôm a little surprised that speeds over 200 mph don‚Äôt change this math. "
"Haha I'm far from saying the roadster is a super car believe me. The NIO will absolutely blow it out of the water on the track I'm sure. But I have no reason to doubt that the roadster prototype can put up those numbers, they're hardly far fetched for a light electric car"
"There are videos of this car that doesn't exist, and a full night of back-to-back 0-70 runs in this car that doesn't exist. Tesla had to use real batteries that exist, and motors that exist, in that car that does, in fact, exist. They can't fake that prototype."

"Never liked electric cars, especially Tesla. I'm not a ""car guy"", I'm underage and can't drive yet for quite a while, but I do love cars. Tesla has terrible build quality for that price, and the car's styling further off puts any chance for me to like it, even though it claims to meet these amazing specs. Even though I'm not a fanboy of the Bugatti, it is a lot better from what I've read and seen, in several aspects. 0-60 isn't everything, stop praising that number. If there is a car I'm really ""hyped"" for, it's the Devel Sixteen, or whatever wonder of a machine Koenigsegg comes out with."
"Tesla is a tech company who makes cars. They're overpriced and really not that great, but people eat up the marketing. 

Gotta give it to them in the styling department though, but again low quality."
"Yeah, and people are willfully ignorant because learning things is hard, much easier to exist in their own reality."
"So far, supercharging has not been hurting their batteries.  Remember that battery temperature isn't as big a problem as motor temperature has been.  Especially for the extra money, it would be fairly straightforward for the cooling capacity of the vehicle to be improved.

Remember that the original Roadster doesn't have much issue with thermal throttling.  The Model S and X aren't really sports cars.  Their ability to go fast in a straight line is more a point to get a few extra sales from those so interested, than it is intended to be a focal point of the car.  No one drives a Maybach 62 around going 0-60 in 5 seconds, but the car can do it, and I am sure that someone was impressed enough by that fact to buy it instead of a Rolls Royce for just that reason.  I'm also betting that that car has seen its performance put to that test less than a dozen times.

It's easy to complain about the Model S's thermal throttling, but it's really not seen by most drivers outside of track style conditions.  You certainly don't see it even on the expressway, even on a very spirited day, unless you drive like an all out nutcase.  Now, I do strongly believe that the Model S's performance issues would be rectified by the combination of a redesigned cooling system and a phase change larger refrigeration system.  Sharing a compressor and most of a refrigeration circuit between powertrain cooling and cabin cooling isn't really ideal for performance beyond certain levels.  Adding a second compressor with its own larger condensers, and then only using the main air conditioner as a temporary boost would do a lot for this issue.  It wouldn't be too hard to divert some air in the rear wheel well, or somewhere else in the back of the car, through such a system."
"Well, my Audi RS6 shouldn't be pushed hard until the oil's up to a fair temperature.  Turbos don't like oil that doesn't flow right.  It takes a few minutes of light driving or idling for the oil to be up and to 150 F, which takes it just off the first line of the dial.

This applies to all gasoline and diesel cars actually, but even more so to turbocharged cars."
Well it's simple. You're saying they should charge more for no reason besides greed.
He's a piece of shit for saying it. I stand by my opinion. Use your magic powers if you think I give a shit. Blocking this sub
"Once again, how hard is to understand?

There are laws of physics, which make certain things impossible

One of them is batteries having a higher energy density than hydrocarbons. It's not happening. Never. 

Another one is perpetual motion machines.

Which means that both the ICE and EV are doomed in the medium to long term -- the ICE is running on petroleum, but EVs are not running on magic, they are running on coal and gas. Once those are gone, so will be EVs (and civilization). 

Solar and wind are not viable substitutes, for the same reasons the ICE cannot be replaced by EVs for a long number of tasks -- energy density. Plus that pesky perpetual motion impossibility limitation. Solar and wind are very diffuse and the only reason we can build the massive infrastructure needed to harvest them today is that we still have a massive fossil fuel subsidy to power the whole enterprise. But can they self-renew? Doubtful. And even now, when we still have fossil fuels to subsidize them, we cannot scale them up to meaningful levels. 

This is the problem with technoutopianism -- it is fine to believe in the power of the human mind to solve various problems, but once that crosses into the territory of blind faith in the unlimited ability of human ingenuity to solve all problems (even when that contradicts the laws of physics), it becomes a secular religion, no different in its absurdity than traditional theistic ones. 

The only viable solutions are downscaling the human enterprise (i.e. 90+% population reduction, drastic reduction in per capita resource consumption, and an end of growth-dependent capitalist socioeconomic systems and transitioning to a steady-state economy). "
"No, how did you determine that Tesla motors need replacing every 7 years? I‚Äôm pretty clued up on Tesla but I‚Äôve never heard anything like this. "
Do you know if Bugatti is working on new tires that can survive testing its theoretical top speed? I figured that since the Chiron is a limited production run of 500 that they called it good at the already stupidly fast speed of 261.
"Lol dude. Google it.

He is basically just saying that if Bugatti is smart they should do exactly what Tesla is doing. But also add an electric generator that runs on gasoline which i'm not sure how efficient that actually would be.

No he is trying to give advice to Bugatti. Stop bringing Koenigsegg into this.

"You need to be able to independently control what your driving to the tyres a thousand times a second, that‚Äôs possible with the roadster it‚Äôs not possible with ICE.
Tyres matter a lot but it‚Äôs also what you make of those tyres."
"So the way I see it you want to always have the maximum amount of rotational force on the wheel, so that the tire doesn't lose grip. If you achieve that constantly throughout the run from 0-100 or whatever, then there's no way adding more engine power can improve the time. For an ICE, tech like traction control can only *reduce* the force on one wheel in a split second so by definition to achieve our goal, the engine itself needs to be powerful enough at each speed between 0-100 to be able to exceed that maximum amount of force. Because an ICE doesn't have a very flat output curve at all, this is hard for them. However, unlike the misconception, electric engines also don't have a perfectly flat output power curve so there still needs to be some excess power. "

"No. Lots of ways to fix things are simple ideas with difficult executions, extreme costs, other detriments, are too time consuming, or have low yeild rates.

That's actually what [land speed racers](http://shaunarmstrong.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Bloodhound-SSC-778A8446.jpg) do. But it doesn't really work too well on regular streets.
"Bugatti, hire this man!"
"Yeah just have little train wheels installed and race it on a really long train track to determine the top speed, that'll get some impressive numbers once you pick up some speed."
"By tires that cost 50k to replace on the Bugatti, let‚Äôs not forget the $20,000 oil change too. Tons of manus are saying they‚Äôre going electric and it‚Äôs going to be pretty bad ass. Will miss the roar of a v8, purr of a v12, and that crazy whine of the 4 cylinder f1 car at 10k rpm.

Everyone says this but IÔ∏è actually laughed out loud so danke
Tires are exposed to tremendous forces when traveling at those speeds. There aren't really any street tires that can reliably withstand 300mph speeds. That's part of the reason why Bugatti has always worked so closely with Michelin to develop tires. 
"Put simply, a tire spinning that fast is going to want to grow and stretch away from the wheel because of the extreme centrifugal force. At some point it‚Äôs not going to be able to withstand that force and will fail. "
Basically consider the rotational forces in play on any given point of the tire at those kinds of speeds. Rubber has limits on what it can tolerate and 261mph is basically it when it's in the shape of a road legal tire.
"Actually, the Bugatti has kind of an unexpected issue at top speed. The airflow over the tire is enough to overcome the heat created by friction, so the danger is the tire not having enough pressure, rather than too much."
"Do you *really* hit 120+ mph (193+ kph) often or ever on the Autobahn? I've never been to Europe, much less Germany, so I have no personal basis for this. I just find that wild if true.

According to the [Wikipedia Page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn?wprov=sfla1) ""Measurements from the German State of¬†Brandenburg¬†in 2006 showed average speeds of¬†142¬†km/h (88¬†mph)¬†on a 6-lane section of autobahn in free-flowing conditions."""

Holy fuck I wish the U.S. could have highways without speed limits

I'm in Germany right now for work. Cruising in the right lane at 110 mph and getting passed regularly on the left is interesting. "

"Highly doubt that. You may be thinking kph. There are hardly any cars that can even reach 120 mph and most would be extremely unstable and basically at their limit at that point. Not to mention most people couldn't safely drive anything that fast, even on the autobahn."
"[100% B.S.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobahn#Travel_speeds)

Well you can always head over to Bonneville.
"Wow thanks for driving like a reckless asshole you're so cool. 

"
"Nah, even on the Autobahn you don't see 250mph basically ever.

100 every few minutes, 120-150 will be the typical ""fastest person passing you"" on a commute, and much above 150 is very rare although you'll see it. I highly doubt I've ever seen anyone pushing 200: even at night there are too many cars until the early hours of the morning, and at that time it's still dangerous as trucks will be overtaking each other with... less than 100% alert drivers.

There are plenty of people who hit that 100-130 range, and certainly a few around 150, but not much above that.

I suppose there could be more who try their cars out in the early hours of the morning that we don't see because... well, we're not there, and that's why they are. But still

That said, driving fast isn't particularly interesting itself: once you're above 150mph in a straight line you're only really watching road markings whizz past and keeping an eye out for traffic ahead. 0-60 is far more fun"
"Did you mod your cavalier? A stock cavalier would never break 120, id be surprised if you even got above 110."
"Interesting.

I was never able to get my friends Cavalier above 104 and I'm pretty sure it had the largest engine they produced.

Also, whats more interesting, is you read 145mph on a speedo that only goes up to 110mph..? Seriously. No Cavalier ever sold came with a speedo >110mph. Or are you referring to kmh..? In which case this is all plausible."
Can confirm. I own a 2003 cavalier base. I did about 125-130. It actually feels like you‚Äôre *re-entering earth‚Äôs atmosphere*... But it was fun. 
It would be a great drag car. The high weight and low downforce would probably hinder it enough to lose to other 200k cars on a track. 
"There is a wer bit of fuzz on those numbers, considering Mercedes and Ferrari both got caught burning small amounts of oil along with the gas intentionally to skirt fuel flow and fuel composition rules."
"If you're willing to spend outrageous money on inconel, or cause permanent damage to an engine, then you can up the temperature and get whatever efficiency you want."

"The ICE is dead, it just doesn't know it yet.  The future of personal transport is autonomous electric taxis, they will be the primary cars on the road inside 10-15 years.  I would put down serious money that manual driving on public roads will be banned in similar time scales.

[Edit: I get it, nobody wants to believe it, see here before you downvote though, hiding the truth doesn't help anybody](https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7e2ze2/tesla_vs_bugatti/dq2i4sg/)"
If that theoretical can become attainable then that's really impressive!
"Yeah, it was something like that. I remember them talking about the fuel only lasting around 12 minutes but that it didn‚Äôt really matter because odds were the tires would need replaced around the same time."
"not much longer, better tyres just can't be made at the moment. The Chiron's tyres experience thousands of Gs at top speed, and rubber tyres hit a hard limit before the W16's 1479hp output does"
Probably the same speed if you want to not have your tires disintegrate.
"I am super dubious about the Roadster claimed top speed. I didn't see a lot of aero on the car to make it stable at such high speeds. Just look at the [giant wing](http://st.motortrend.com/uploads/sites/5/2011/07/2011-bugatti-veyron-super-sport-wing.jpg) Buggatti's have that deploys at super high speed for stability. I have no doubt the Roadster is physically capable of going at that speed however, I am super dubious of how stable the car would actually be and what tires one would have to buy to achieve it. The fact that there is a + sign at the end of the given top speed number gives more credence to the idea that it is more of a theoretical potential. I'm not sure how many owners of a $200,000 car are going to be willing to spend thousands on special tires they will burn through in minutes at such a high spend. The owner of a 3 million dollar car finds such costs trivial but to the owner of a $200,000 car it becomes an extremely expensive party trick. This doesn't take away a bit from the extremely impressive overall package of the Roadster. I just don't think hardly any Roadster owners will ever actually attempt the top speed of the car. 
"
"Currently, about 30 seconds.

But hopefully this future car will be able to handle a good 7 minutes so it can make track times..."
Presumably about the same. Tesla hasnt created new rubber technology. 
"Yeah, that is not how it works. Chemical batteries can't be more energy dense than gasoline. Some other technology, maybe, but not batteries. Here's a good explanation why you can't extrapolate like that: https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-battery-energy-density-improves-5-8-per-year-Does-this-represent-an-average-or-is-it-a-consistent-trend-each-year-Do-these-improvements-increase-the-cost-What-has-been-the-trend-if-any-regarding-energy-to-weight-ratio

The reason petrol is so ""energy dense"" is because you're not carrying most of the stuff needed for the chemical reaction around with you, you just take it from the air. About 3.5kg of oxygen are needed to combust 1kg of fuel. A battery would have to contain both parts of the reaction."
"Technology and science just don't work like that.

there are certain limits in physics. you just can't keep improving something infinitely.

batteries will certainly get better, but they will never be as energy dense as hydrocarbons. it's literally impossible. "
50 years ago we already had the standard alkaline battery. You are going to be disappointed if you expect exponential improvement in the future
"Elsewhere in the thread somebody mentioned the inevitable collision between Elon Musk fanboyism and the reality of the laws of physics.

Guess:

1. Which side of that conflict you have situated yourself on?

2. Who the inevitable winner is going to be?"
"The potential of all forms of storage is actually very well known. Again, from basic physical principles. 

This is why, for example, mechanical means of energy storage will never be viable (because there are terms such as mass and speed involved, which make all such means impractically bulky and/or impractically dangerous)

Nothing is both as energy dense and as convenient to use as hydrocarbons, and this is not going to change. 

If you want something better than hydrocarbons, you have to dive deeper into the structure of matter than chemical bonds. Which is because at a very fundamental level energy and distance are kind of the same thing but inversely related to each other -- the smaller the distance, the more high-energy the interactions. But that leads us again in the too dangerous and/or too complicated to be practical territory. "
Just do it when they bring it in for an oil change. It's not like you can change the oil in a Chiron at home.
"Heres a peice of advice, owning a Bugatti is way different than your Honda. Bugatti dealerships are practically spas. On top of that Bugatti will have someone pick up the car from them to take it to the dealership- and do any maintenance/updates. Tesla ain't doing that."
[deleted]
"There's just no way to make them a desirable combination of stable, safe, and durable.

Since at those speeds you absolutely cannot compromise on stability or safety, (I split them up because I'm categorizing catastrophic tire failures as ""safety"" and ability to grip the road while maintaining a tolerable ride quality as ""stabillity"", maybe that's not correct) so you necessarily compromise on durability.

Some years ago the lead engineer on the Bugatti Veyron quipped that it was not a problem that the tires would run out in 15 minutes of driving at top speed, because the fuel would run out in 12.

That's not an exaggeration, by the way: at 253 mph, the Veyron's tires would only last 15 minutes.

They cost $17,000 per set of four tires.

That was about 10 years ago, I don't know the state of things now, but I do not know of any revolutionary breakthroughs in the space."
I assume at above a certain speed tires tend to... Fail.
"In Germany, theoretically, it is."
"We're actually both wrong. If you want to double your speed, you require 4 times the work, but you have to do it twice as fast, so you then therefore need 8 times the power."
Power required increases with the cube of velocity.
This sub is absolutely delusional about the speed of cars and how much it matters.

I think that is 2000AD story
What if they made a trailer that was simply a massive battery to test a theoretical range?
"Except it would not be road legal in many states, here in ohio max length is 97 ft without special permits. So you won't gain much for the time being unless those half length trailers are used, even then the max you can have is 3."
"Even cooler if you didn't actually need to physically hook them up, but instead just slaved all the later trailers together so they followed the lead cab/trailer combo in perfect synchronicity"

Probably also to keep the turbos cool. You can hear them going only when the car reaches around 180 mph.
"""woohoo!...oh shit we're still doing 200mph!!!"""
He didn't really push the car until around 190 because it's rear wheel drive and couldn't put down that much power at low speeds
"No way they were getting wheel slip in that clip. They just weren't pushing it. I think the reason is that if they'd floored it, then they could get wheel slip so they just took it conservatively until they knew they couldn't get wheel slip."
"> It's because they were getting wheel slip until around 180 mph if they pushed it hard and there was no need to give a massive shock to the drivetrain at low speeds when only going for a top speed run.

Wheel slip at 0.2 G? You can't be serious, why did it not skid to a stop at the end of the track at .8 G? /u/superspiffy was correct and the car was not pushed for acceleration, /u/godlyhalo and /u/ikjadoon are making things up. Unfortunate."
The fact it kept a straight line at 280mph on that bumpy road alone is mind blowing. What a machine.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Very true.
I think I'd still prefer a tire wall than a semi and a crowd of people ¬†¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
"Not exactly what you were saying, the way you phrased it implied the car has limits to it's capability that are overcome by going faster. The truth is it was doing half throttle up to half speed.

The car would have  ""come alive"" from a standstill had it been given full throttle."
[deleted]
it is also much lighter
"The infographic is cherry picking stats to convey the idea that the roadster will be able to compete (or topple) existing hypers. Looking at relevant metrics within the context seems to point to a different picture. There's always more to the story than what's initially being presented. 

Hence the blasphemy. "
The range is over 600 miles...
To be fair if you're dropping $200k on a car you're not the general public. I can't imagine either of these cars will be daily drivers for anyone.
"A lot of people outside of America won't have this problem. I could drive my car for nearly a month off one charge with that kind of range. Then just charge it up overnight one day and boom, another month. "
With a 600+ mile range??? 
"I feel if there was a cheap way to have a supercharger installed in your own home that would go out the window. Yes getting gas is quicker, but a couple hours charge at home and even an overnight charger is cheaper."
for a super car that doesn't matter much. You're probably not taking your roadster or Chiron on a crosscountry trip.
"Hardly...everyone sleeps at some point and most people don't travel 600 miles in a day unless they are doing a pretty intense road trip traveling 10 hours at an average 60mph.

Sounds like the bigger problem will be people who don't remember to charge their car or something stupid...but thats their fault

This is on top of the fact that we are already well ""trained"" to do this behavior with cell phones...most people I know have no issue with phones that need to be slowly and constantly charged."
"> Funny thing is that in Germany a fair number of people DO hit 150mph daily.

This. It might be hard for others to understand, but in Germany driving that fast is not outrageous or only done for adrenaline fun, it is actually normal everyday driving for people who drive from A to B for work. The standard car you will see going 140+ mph on the Autobahn is not an exotic sports car, instead it is a Diesel BMW/Audi/Mercedes/Opel station wagon with some salesman in it."
"Not 150 mph, but here in California, I can be doing 80 and people will pass me on both sides going well over that in beater cars and lifted pickup trucks, not just sports cars. Fucking lunatics."
"Funny how as a canadian i hadn't considered the euro market. I can't go over 60 legally on the highway

Fair point tbh"
"Wait a second, they use MPH in the settings for german cars? Cuz if they use kilometers per hour 150 really isn't that fast."
"I'm in the market for fun cars like the WRXSTi or the focus RS personally. 

Both of those are too expensive and limited in other regards than speed. 

Cars should never be evaluated simply by their price tags or top speeds."
It's called the roadster not the trackster
Funny how as a canadian i hadn't considered the euro market. I can't go over 60 legally on the highway
"If I wanted to get a 200'000$ dollars car, yes, I could. 

I'd probably have to sacrifice a lot, but 200k isn't that much.

But that doesn't have anything to do with the conversation."

"I think he meant the 60-150 and 0-200, the higher-speed accelerations."
"‚ÄúDangerous/reckless‚Äù acceleration is illegal in most states. It‚Äôs fairly arbitrary, but if you‚Äôre gonna try to go flat out from a stoplight or something, there‚Äôs a high chance your gonna be pulled over if you get spotted. "
I feel like having a street car that can 0-60 in 1.9s at every stop light probably won't get old
[deleted]
"I think you must have messed up your math somewhere, since you can‚Äôt derive trap speed based on 0-100 time and quarter mile time alone.

There are plenty of modified cars that can do faster 1/4 mile, but a 200mph trap speed is quite unlikely (in fact 8.8s 0-200mph is super, super, super unlikely). For example [this modified toy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG328cnIdaU) did 1/4 mil in less than 8.5s, so about 0.5s faster than the Roaster, but only reached top speed of 154mph in the end.

For comparison, the craziest acceleration production car in the world is the Koenigsegg Regera, and it takes a bit more than 11 seconds to reach 200mph (it's expected that the Regera will break 9s quarter mile as well). That's actually already significantly faster than any other hypercars, including the Bugatti here. "
"If Tesla can't make an electric car that can maintain itself going around a track, how are they going to create an electric motor that will be able to maintain the pressures of going over 250mph? Also, if they really believe in the performance of this new car, they would take it to the nurburgring and post a lap time. "

Maybe less tyre issues without gear change jerk
It wouldn't be tesla
"Nope, lol"
"Not many cars have that issue, so I think it's safe to assume the roadster won't. "
Well they claim the tires that the Bugatti have aren't rated past 261 mph sooooo.....
There's a reason Michelin is working on a tire that will allow 280mph

"The DragTimes guy said it's noticeably faster than his P100D, so I would be willing to guess they were actually getting the 1.9 second 0-60, or pretty close to it."

"Aero helps speed, but it hurts handling. The ridiculously low drag coefficient on the Tesla combined with its weight would make it very difficult to turn once you got moving very fast."
">Wait a second, did you just try to point out that aerodynamics hurt track performance? 

No? Exactly the opposite of that. Track-oriented aero is not conducive to range, which I imagine Tesla is going to target more than performance."
"Sort of. The Chiron is meant to have performance but it is also a status symbol. The price tag is a feature. It's not 3 million because it is that much better than any other car. You also have to do stuff like have the Chiron rims X-rayed after X number of miles or yearly to check for stress cracks. I'd imagine you'd have to do that in the roadster, too, or any vehicle that actually sees speeds of 200mph+"
"We're not time travelers, we pay today's prices for things.  Old technology is more expensive and slower, but worth it."
"Seeing as konigsegg  uses the same tires and just set the record for top speed with the tires taking no more than normal wear, yea Bugatti is gonna try to hit a higher top speed soon since that‚Äôs really the only thing it had left to boast about it. "
"Well all the people that could tell you exactly how deep have been ""tin canned"" by the pressure."
"The submarine captain wouldn't know, but I assure you the engineers that designed the submarine do. Whether it is a submarine or a supercar, those designs are not by accident. Everything is meticulously calculated and designed to meet a certain specification. On top of that you have extremely accurate simulations, as well as destructive testing to check how your design holds up compared to these specifications. Engineers want to know under what circumstances their design fails, as well as how exactly it fails.

They won't necessarily be able to give you a precise figure, but they will be able to tell you what they designed it for and under what load things tend to fail in their tests/simulations. They may want to keep that a secret and keep and air of mystique around that, but that's marketing talk."

Same amount of evidence as the performance figures for the production Roadster.

"> Chiron GS/SS won't have 4 seats, 

Why would it?  It's not like the back seats in the Roadster are usable.  It's basically like the 911.

But will have ~400 miles of highway range with full refueling in minutes.

>and will still cost 3mil.

"The overheating issue is basically just part of their design philosophy.  Even if they have a great cooling system that can sustain high performance continuously, you'd always be able to crank the power even more for a short duration.  So if they were to eliminate the overheating problem, they'd be giving up that short term performance boost and the associated improvement of acceleration stats."

Which is oddly a great comparison to how not scary AI is. There is a kill switch on AI. It's the power button. The fear of AI is the fear of an independently thinking machine. The reality of AI is you still have input --> algorithm --> output. This will never be thinking. At best AI can learn, but that only brings that order into a loop. That's not how humans work. We adjust how we think throughout our lives, a thing that AI cannot do as of yet, and no one has seriously attempted to do it as far as I can tell.

I don't think that was his point. He said that some guy whose driven both cars and knows something about cars said the Roadster pulled harder.

Tesla specificaly hired a race driver from Ferrari. They didn't have to , if it was only going to perform in a straight line."

He basically edited his comment when I pointed out that it's dumb
People don't buy Bugatti's because they want electric. 
I dunno about efficient but trains basically run on electric motors powered by diesel generators
"Correct.  Some people can't understand humor, so to help the GP out: it's a silly jab at dying old tech, I was imaging an absurd ICE powered supercharger - which is how electric cars recharge at 300 miles per hour right now - built in to an electric Bugatti as some sort of cartoonish attempt to beat the Tesla at its own game."
Pretty much all top tier formula 1 cars run on hybrid drive trains like that.
That little star beside the comment means he edited it
"VW has the porsche Mission E on the way.  Audi had the R8 E-Tron that was going to be better than the original Roadster but is cancelled now (dodged that bullet I guess, but I'm still disappointed) and with the next gen S and X likely to share some of the tech in the Roadster 2020, they're going to have to step in soon.  They have Lambo as well, so there's plenty of brands they can badge their EV hypercars with and even more they can use for upscale daily drivers with the same technology.

I just wish they'd hurry up and dive in already."

"As someone that lived in Germany for many years I can answer this

- Yes, if you have a fast car and dont care about gas costs then yes. I rode a GSXR and hit 160+ every single day driving to work. I was passed by M5s and GT3s pretty often.

- The cost of gas in Germany is WAY higher. I don't know what it costs these days, but when I was there it was in the neighborhood of $12 a gallon. MOST people drive pretty sloe because cars are significantly more fuel efficient at lower (45-55 MPH)."
"Yes you do. The measured average includes trucks, which are not allowed to drive faster than 80 kph. And there are a lot of trucks on the Autobahn. It is really not uncommon to see cars passing you on the left lane, even if you think you're already going fast. If the conditions allow you to drive 200-300 kph you will see people driving at those speeds. "
"There are many kilometers of autobahn without speed restriction and yes, people drive above 200kmph there all the time.

Source: i do it all the time too when i rent a good car and i routinely have to give way to somebody doing 250"
"I've never had a problem getting my 911 to 150+ miles per hour on extremely rural interstates in America where the speed limit is 80mph, and do it for sustained amounts of times when I go on road trips. You can go for miles without seeing a car. You have to slow down as soon as you see a car anywhere though, for safety reasons, or in case it's a cop. I've never had the chance to go faster than 167mph yet though due to the fact that it can take enough time to get to that speed such that you have to start slowing down almost immediately because you'll end up seeing a car in the distance or a piece of terrain you don't have enough sight around (dangerous due to possibility of a car stalled on the road, or an animal) and it's not worth the risk of an accident / freaking out the driver of the other car / a cop.

I've never gotten to do this on the autobahn yet, but from these comments it sounds like it would be a worse experience due to the traffic? (other than being able to relax more due to it being legal)."
"no very very few people drive that fast. but those people who actually do it usually do it regularly either because they have a great autobahn connection to work with a lot of lanes or they drive when there is low traffic for fun. but believe me the vast majority of drivers won't ever drive that fast.

 It is super expensive to drive that fast. a lot of cars can't drive that fast and most people don't feel too good about driving 200km/h. and last but not least often the traffic simply doesn't allow it. Most Autobahns are two lanes each direction which makes driving 200km/h extremely dangerous, people will drive 130km/h, overtaking trucks driving 110km/h. I already feel bad about 160km/h because who knows if someone will change lane and not expect me."
120mph really isn't that fast in the context of these cars. I've gone faster by accident before. 
"I hit 110mph or so probably once a week on my way to work when i lived out of town, and i live in the states. I did 150 once going to Reno. I could see hitting 150 fairly routinely on the autobahn if you had a nice car. "
"Many people will think sports cars are the left lane queens here in Germany, but that's mostly wrong. 

I use the Autobahn everyday and 120mph+ cars are usually Audi A4 A6, BMW 3 and 5 series and other station wagons in the same price bracket. 99% of the time these cars are owned by companies and are given out to their employees. In this case the employees don't have to pay for the gas or repair costs so they're hauling ass on the streets to get to/off work asap."
Yes however you have to be careful as there are speed limited sections. Got something like 9 tickets when I drove to Austria from Berlin. 
I'm happy with 80-85 here in America for the most part. We have too many cars that can't really handle higher speeds sell along with the kind of drivers we have.
Montana used to have no speed limit.  Too many idiots (mostly from out of state) losing their minds and crashing their cars. So they had to put back the speed limit. 
"The Nazis did get transportation right.  Between the Autobahn and contracting Porsche to design a car that would remain in production with the same design for fifty years because it was so good, it almost makes up for slaughtering eleven million people like cattle.  "

"No, I meant 120 mph, or a smidge under 200 km/h.

Go talk to any German about it. Under the right conditions these kinds of speeds absolutely aren't uncommon on the Autobahn. The driver's training over there is much more extensive, and the roads are much more well maintained in preparation for these kinds of speeds.

> There are hardly any cars that can even reach 120 mph and most would be extremely unstable and basically at their limit at that point. 

Mercedes, BMW, Audi. Premium level German cars were engineered to be as stable as possible at high speeds on the autobahn.

> Not to mention most people couldn't safely drive anything that fast,

Their driver's training is miles better than ours."
"Pretty much every car, even 4 cylinder econo boxes, can go 120mph. Even a Prius is probably good for 110ish
"
My 2013 Corolla can go 125 no problem. What are you talking about 
"German checking in:

I owned a Seat Ibiza with 140 hp which reached 210km/h.
If the autobahn is ‚Äûopen‚Äú ( we say ‚Äûoffen‚Äú in German or ‚Äû Keine Streckenbegrenzungen‚Äú in buerocratic German) people are going to drive fast. A typical VW Golf is able to reach 200km/h and lots of people drive older Audi‚Äòs oder BMW‚Äòs with 150 and more hp. 

"
"I think you guys are just disagreeing on what qualifies for ""pretty common.""

[Here's](http://www.mil.brandenburg.de/cms/media.php/lbm1.a.2239.de/studie_tempolimit.pdf) a report on Autobahn speeds. It's from 2007, but it should still be valid since overall speeds trend upward over time. Page 19 has a graph of speed distribution. The median speed for speed limited sections of the Autobahn (begrenzt) is about 115 kph (71 mph). The median speed for unlimited sections (unbegrenzt) is about 140 kph (87 mph). So yeah, average speed is in the 70 to 90 mph range.

However, if you check the percentage of people going 193 kph (120 mph), you'll see that about 2% to 3% of drivers exceed that speed on the unlimited sections. 1 in 50 drivers may not sound like a lot and isn't enough to affect the average too much, but given the number of cars you encounter on a single drive and the fact that cars that overtake faster have more ""encounters,"" you'll be coming across them regularly and probably multiple times on even a fairly short drive."
"That's not how statistics work.

The average altitude of a human above ground/floor level is probably about 0.1m or less, but it's still common on earth to have humans above 10km (in planes)."
"About half of the Autobahn has speed limits, so you'd need to redo those stats for the unlimited parts of the autobahn, where there is only an advisory limit of 130 km/h(80 mph)"
"Or the autobahn, I‚Äôve been on it but only for a little while on a (I think) speed restricted area in a big van because of family"
Americans are so ignorant üòÇ
"I dunno, I had a shitty 94 that I did not take care of in like 2006 at 100 with 2 passengers and like 50-100 more pounds of drums. They are shitty cars but that was stock and easily could have gone faster even then. "
"I've edited my post; I would've sworn from memory it went to 130, but a quick Google this morning suggests 110; whichever it was, I certainly exceeded it by 10 (line markings continued and speedometer reflected), but in all cases I'm American so I'm not kph-confused."
Well roght. But okay you can put the batteries anywhere. You can add aero. It has 7000+ foot pounds of torque. It would be unbeatable if if has good handling. And it would be fun no matter what. Public track days would be the best
"I'd imagine those would probably be included in the efficiency calculations, almost by definition. Otherwise they'd just create an engine which burns 100% oil and claim 100% efficiency."
The F1 regulations restrict usage of rare metals.
"Indeed, I believe that's also with F1 regulations so it's reasonable to believe they can get even more power out of a very similar engine."
"So I'll be able to hire an autonomous taxi to take my boat in and out of the water? Or will boats be banned to? 

In a representative democracy, it is extremely unlikely that your inconvenient and limiting future is anywhere close to becoming a reality."
"I don't think it's that black and white. 

Firstly (as mentioned elsewhere) electric vehicles take time to charge. This is inconvenient for many and probably puts some people off.

Also, ""autonomous taxis"" are only likely to work as well as public transport does currently - people enjoy having their own cars for a reason. Chances are a lot of people would rather have their own vehicle than get access to a pool of vehicles shared amongst thousands.

Also, not all ICE usage is restricted to personal transport. You've got the freight industry which utilises many different methods of transport - most of which won't even benefit from the pros of electric powered engines.

You seem to equate the ICE being dead with vehicles becoming autonomous. These two aren't mutually exclusive."
"in 10 to 15 years? dude, thanks for laughs. really."
"I can go to harbor freight and buy a 6.5 hp engine for $120, a can of gas for $30, rip the cord and off she goes. It's both cheaper and simpler. Now do the same thing electric. Then get the speed controller, and batteries. Single phase, 3 phase, fixed magnet or AC I don't care. It's prohibitively expensive. It's the same economics at scale. I can buy a 10k car from kia and hyundai which you could probably reliably pile 100k miles on. There's zero advantage to electric in ecomonics. "

"You have to remember that the 620+ miles of charge in that battery pack are lining the entire base of the car. What keeps it so stable besides the dynamics is how low the center of gravity is on them. Much much lower than a Bugatti's will be, hence the need for the spoiler. "
">Chemical batteries can't be more energy dense than gasoline. 

Never say never dude, lithium-air batteries already have a theoretical peak energy density very close to what gasoline has and has achieved around 1/3 of that in lab tests so far. 

While that chemistry will probably never reach that theoretical peak in commercial applications or may not be viable at all, new ways to jog electrons around with chemical reactions are found all the time and it wouldn't make sense to assume that none of them can ever match gasoline for energy density."

Not if you use any of the features mentioned above the range in this pic. Accelerating hard and driving at top speed will lower the range significantly

"Displacement = .5(V.I + V.F)*Change.Time
Quarter Mile = 402.336 meters
0-100mph Tesla roadster = 4.2
100mpg = 160.9344km/h
160.9344km/h = 44.704m/s  (160.9344/60/60*1000) = 44.704
Displacement = .5(0 + 44.704)*4.2
Displacement = 44.704*.5*4.2
Displacement = 93.8784

Just the 0-100 mph time, the car will travel 93.8784 meters. In order for the car to achieve a quarter mile, in 8.8 seconds, use the equation again, but change displacement, and use V.I as 44.704, and find V.F again

Displacement = Quarter mile(in meters) - 93.8784
Displacement = 308.4576
Use the same equation as before, and use 308.4576 as the displacement
308.4576 = .5(V.I + V.F)*Change.Time
Change.Time = difference in time between 0-100mpg time, and quarter mile time(8.8-4.2=4.6)
308.4576 = .5(44.604 + V.F)*4.6
308.4576/.5 = (44.604 +V.F)*4.6
616.9153 = (44.604 + V.F)*4.6
616.9153/4.6 = 44.604 + V.F
134.112 = 44.604 +V.F
134.112 - 44.604 = V.F
89.508 m/s = V.F
89.508*60*60/1000 = V.F km/h
322.2288km/h
Conversion rate between km and miles is 
1km=.621371miles
322.2288*.621371 = 200.2236317 mph

I could have just done the starting velocity be 0 and ending be unknown, use displacement as the quarter mile in meters, and change in time be 8.8, but that will give you a velocity, as if the acceleration was 100% constant the whole time the cars accelerating(which is hard to do). So even given the benefit of the doubt, I found out how far the car travels when it goes 0-100 mph, then used that time and distance, and velocity, to find a more accurate measurement of how fast the car has to be going at the end of the 8.8 seconds.

"[So a Chinese company can do it but you think Tesla cannot?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcepG9Twa_8)

I don't think it's fair to base the roadster's performance on the model S, since the latter is designed first and foremost for efficiency, not sustained performance, and larger cooling intakes needed to achieve that would impact that negatively. 

But on the roadster, much like the EP9, i suspect they would prioritize performance over efficiency."
"They've never said any of their previous cars could do that, the Model S is a sedan and the Roadster 1.0 was a proof-of-concept.

I really don't get why people want to counter Tesla fanboy optimism with total disdain instead of just saying ""let's wait and see, boys""."
Lap times are a completely different metric from top speed. The person I replied to was doubting the 250 MPH top speed.
"??

I‚Äôm just asking a question. I‚Äôll look it up myself real quick just to see if I‚Äôve said something stupid. 

Edit: I spent a minute googling, and I can‚Äôt find which Tesla cars have worse performance than what was promised. There were lots of articles about Tesla‚Äôs failure to meet production numbers, but that‚Äôs not really relevant here. 

Edit 2: Just glanced at your comment history. Obvious troll. You got me. "
"The issues are from gravity and the heat at that speed. It's not the shifting. So no, Tesla will have the same issue. "
"Each gram of rubber experiences 3,800G of centrifugal force at top speed, if they go any faster the tyres will just pull themselves apart. "
Wtf no need to call him a jerk.. 
They still have gearing.. The rpm of the engine doesn't match what the wheel does. But I presume that sort of fixed set up is vastly more reliable than a gearbox.
The limitation is caused by the centripetal acceleration of wheels pulling the rubber tires apart. Any car that can go fast enough would have the same problem.
"It wasn't 30 minutes, which is the bare minimum my Model S needs to even start cooling down enough to get half of another hot lap after overheating on the first.  Their cooling is substantially improved and will do better than the Model S, we all just hope it's enough to put down a lot of successive laps."
"There was a continuous line , one after the other."
"Sure--gotta see the data.

Remember, the batteries can both be too cold and too hot for maximum acceleration."
"I noticed that and I was bummed his VBOX didn't work. :(

But, right: it was probably *close*, IMO. I think a 2.1s launch will still feel *much* harder than a 2.5s launch, but still will fall short of 1.9s (which likely includes the one-foot rollout as Tesla is wont to do). But, in this hypercar category, 0.2s is a pretty substantial difference."
[deleted]
"Oh, that's awesome. I didn't see that part of the video. 67% SOC is amazing to still get hard launches. The P100D won't let you enable Ludicrous if you're below 90%, IIRC.

I wonder how the driver is seeing the times; I mean, he can see the speedometer, but does it have a little launch time counter, too, maybe? "
"It certainly does, but not fast enough to affect this generation of Roadsters. It's gonna be a very heavy car, there's nothing to be done about that. Let's see where energy density is in 2025 and re-evaluate electric track cars then.

(FWIW, there's currently an electric racing series called Formula E. To make the cars light enough to perform, they had to cut batteries down to last only about half a race distance. Mid way through the race they have to jump out of their car and jump into one with fresh batteries.)"
"They are already using paper separated soft cells. It won't improve that much to shave two thirds of the weight.  This thing is going to be the electric demon gt car not a sports or hyper car.  You also have to keep in mind that Bugatti and Michelin spent hundreds of millions to make those exclusive tires, and they had to find ways to cut weigh to be lighter than a Veyron since they were still tire limited with the old car on the new power train. 

Even thinking about competing with Bugatti in speed puts you out of running good track times unless you are John Hennessy."
"This is why active aero is employed on both cars.  Active aero helps speed all of the time, straights and curves.  And in the case of the Tesla there's the totally flat bottom that helps both as well.  Neither is likely using a vacuum down there but both could use that for active aero multiplication of cornering capacity.  It only takes a tiny vacuum to make a big difference."
"Not to mention the ridiculously luxurious interior of Bugatti. Every picture of the Roadster 2 I saw so far was very spartan on the inside (also what the hell is up with the steering wheel). You might as well be sitting in a VW Golf when thinking about the Roadster. The Bugatti is a hyper-fast Rolls Royce, both inside and out."
Well the chiron is hard limited to 261 it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs max speed and is probably capable of far more but not on street legal tired and the Bugatti is also where VW group does most of their R&D so that‚Äôs mainly what you are paying for along with the status. 
"You still aren't understanding that you're using the retail price for 2 out 3 examples you're comparing. When comparing things correctly, all factors should be as equal as possible. 
So take that $18 grand from 1962 and find out what it'd be worth today, and then you'd be on a level playing ground.   

(As the ex-owner of a *very* near-replica of that very GTO, let me assure you, it didn't ""drive like a dream""...It drove like an old, loud, rumbly, 60's roadster, and either the Tesla OR the Bugatti would not only eat its lunch, it would be an *extremely* comfortable experience doing it.)  "
I‚Äôm not 100% sure this is just what the Bugatti engineers were saying. Probably has to do with accuracy of the tests and effects of weather on the car and so on but at this point that‚Äôs just me speculating.
"Neat, til. I don't know how vins work, hence the question."
Ah til.
"I'm not saying that at all, I asked a question. I have no clue how vins work I just noticed the highest is over 1000."

No offense but who cares how exclusive a car is? 
More like business class.
"Yup. A Chiron will appreciate in value over the long term. A tesla will not. 

"

On the other hand cars that run on gas are always going to be stuck using fossil fuels. "
"I guess it depends on your definition of modern. 

Both are quite obviously modern interiors, but the Chiron (Especially in the tan trims) takes on a more retro/vintage aesthetic than the MacBook-esk Roadster interior."

"To be honest though, the GT-R is *old* by now and the Acura NSX is pretty slow for a self-proclaimed supercar (too expensive for what it can do). Plus, the GT350R is very track-focused (the tyres are Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 as opposed to the standard road tyres which come on the other cars, and they alone make a huge time difference over a lap). "

There are limits on how much power you can put on the ground. The new roadster is surely over that limit. The large battery will also help. At the same power you are pulling half the amps on each cell plus you half the internal resistance resulting into less heating compared to 100kwh pack. The 200kwh pack also can soak twice the heat before overheating. Even without changing the cooling architecture just doubling the capacity solve a lot of the heat issue.
"The materials audi used were particularly difficult. The main issue is that they just got dirty sooo easily. I got a thumb print of dirt on one and got it mostly clean, but it wasn't perfect. Customer complained and we had to have one ordered and replaced. Tough lesson to learn...

After that, I learned that i pretty much needed to wash my hands with brake clean before getting at it. Even clean gloves could leave smudges.

You're right that we don't know what will happen in production and that's why Tesla says that the 0-60 in 1.9 is a conservative number. Two things worth mentioning about Tesla's reputation on the models they've produced is that 1) they're always delayed but 2) they always deliver more performance than they originally promised."
"The manufacture of batteries isn't as bad as a lot of people seem to think it is.  In modern processes, you are looking at less adverse environmental effect within a year.  Fuel cells share most of these environmental concerns, and then when you add in the hydrogen production/refining process which is either dirty or energy intensive, so they are actually worse.  I really think battery technology will continue to evolve, but am open to viable alternatives.  Remember that the motor cooling issue will affect a high performance fuel cell car just as much as a battery car."
"No, the new Roadster would still win, and the Bugatti's engine might be damaged to show for the stupidity of its driver.  Battery warmup isn't what you think it is.  You might add another 5 or 6% power.  Look at reviews and tests with the Model S and X.

"It heavily depends on the volume and complexity. If you are assuming infinitive volume then yes you are correct. However in the real world things are produced in finite volume. More so tons of specialized equipment has tons of unique parts that would all require specialized machine for every single one.

This is why 3d manufacturing is both viable and useful today. If your volume is only few thousands units and complexity requires 1000 unique parts then going with few 3d manufacturing machines is a no brainier over having to maintain 1000 unique specialized ones. Even in high volume subtractive manufacturing has become very common there is no reason to think additive manufacturing will not do the same."

"Probably for the same reason Trains have smooth metal wheels. Low friction. 

They use a jet engine for propulsion so they don't need grip to to generate momentum, and the low friction would help in lowering the amount of propulsion needed to get to high speeds. The only issue would be braking (which wouldn't be all that effective anyway at those speeds, and maybe even dangerous) which is more than likely handled by some sort of parachute system for the lions share needing only a little braking power for when the parachute loses effectiveness.

"That picture is sadly a bit misleading: it's hard to see from this angle, but **[these metal tires are V-shaped, to _minimise_ their surface area](http://www.bloodhoundssc.com/news/wheels-and-stones)**.  (I'm sure almost everyone here knows what I'm about to explain, but the former teacher in me has to look after [the lucky ten thousand](https://www.xkcd.com/1053/)).

First, some people might see ""completely smooth wheels"" and think of racing slicks. That's the exact opposite of what is being done: racing slicks are about *maximising* contact area with the road for *more* friction. For racing cars, acceleration happens through the wheels, so they need that friction. Oh, and there's this thing called ""grip"" that's quite important when taking corners at Formula 1 speeds ;).

The main reason to have thread patterns in normal car tires is to let water flow away when driving on wet surfaces, so you don't start [aquaplaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaplaning). It's all about keeping grip in bad conditions. Without these considerations, wheels for regular cars could be made smooth, optimised for required contact area with the road, and slimmed down for reduced weight.

The choice for metal also has a lot to do with making these wheels ""bullet proof"": when driving at 1000 mpg, any tiny stone that might bump up and hit the wheel has tremendous kinetic energy, so these wheels need to be able to take a beating (see first link for details). But  the lower friction compared to rubber certainly doesn't hurt either.

So the explanations of /u/Cronos_Vengeance and /u/MigratedCoconut are right, but it is easy misinterpret it in this context: What CV was saying is that land speed racers use *metal* for lower friction, not that they are *smooth* for that reason. The smoothness is actually to reduce weight, because without a thread you can slim down the wheels.

Summarising: 

- the wheels are metal to withstand the beatings they get from driving at super-high speeds, and minimise *friction per surface area*.
- the wheels have a V-shape to *minimise surface area
- together, the two previous are about ensuring *minimal friction*
- the wheels are smooth because threading patterns are unnecessary when racing in Death Valley, letting them slim down the wheels to *reduce their volume with the same (minimal) surface area*
- they use aluminium alloys to *minimise mass per volume*
- the previous two point together ensure *minimal weight*

So it all works together to find the best trade-off to minimise weight and friction."
They can probably get away with that because the wheels aren't powered.
"The four 36-inch (910 mm) diameter wheels will rotate at up to 10,200 rpm and will be forged from an aluminum zinc alloy[22] to resist the 50,000 g centrifugal forces."

">I've never had a problem getting my 911 to 150+ miles per hour on extremely rural interstates in America where the speed limit is 80mph, and do it for sustained amounts of times when I go on road trips. You can go for miles without seeing a car

What would be the repercussions getting caught with this speed in the US?

>but from these comments it sounds like it would be a worse experience due to the traffic?

It depends. If you drive in rush hour or through populated areas like the Ruhr-Gebiet, there is either to much traffic or speed restrictions.

But visiting your relatives in another state, 400km distance can be done in bout 3 hours.

In-Country flights are rarely used (usually buisness related)
Our Railway and Autobahn system is way better 

Especially during off hours, like friday evenings, late night etc. you can drive pretty relaxed. Drivers expect fast cars, most people keep right or move right when you flash lights and most trucks are banned from driving sundays or special holiday-days (exception for food/medicine trucks etc)

See this is good empirical data. I'll concede that 1 in 50 cars can be considered fairly common assuming the density on the autobahn is similar or greater than U.S. highways.
First of all that's not at all how averages work. If you want to show that 120 mph is pretty common don't give me this half-baked statistically illiterate bullshit.
How do you figure as that being important? If you can only pull 120 mph on half the autobahn that obviously reduces how common it can be full stop. Honestly you're just wrong admit it and move on.

"My bad, I meant that the weight is high as in heavy, not that it's placed high. It's definitely at the bottom, in the best spot possible. 

All the other teslas have heat issues when you try to take them to the track. If I remember correctly, they can only handle a few minutes of full throttle before they overheat. If they've solved that, it would definitely be a very fun track car, but not competitive. Maybe if they gave up a bunch of their top speed, some of the range to save weight, and added a whole bunch of aero, they could have a track version that would be competitive for the price.

I think the goal of this car was more to be an exciting daily driver, than to ever see a track. Which it did damn well. "

"He's right, we have hit the wall with city density in plenty of places, parking lots, parking spaces, and excessive use of land use for roads will decrease and it will make economic sense to primarily use shared autonomous transport. Desirable places won't trust private owners to take care of the vehicles and private ownership won't be as cheap and easy as it is now. How do you think it is possible to park for free in front of houses worth millions of dollars, its all subsidized at scale. 

It's not a question of want, of course, we would all want private jets, personal yachts, and private mansions without neighbors while having our high paying jobs next door. Society has been training us to accept the new way for a long time now, just look at the big shift to cloud software. I'd prefer to host my own server as well but I can't compete with thousands of engineers who do this stuff at scale."
"> Also, ""autonomous taxis"" are only likely to work as well as public transport does currently - people enjoy having their own cars for a reason. Chances are a lot of people would rather have their own vehicle than get access to a pool of vehicles shared amongst thousands.

Private ownership of cars isn't going to be dead in 10 years or anything, but a national fleet of autonomous cars in different configurations would be able to get most people where they want to go so much cheaper than owning a car, that it's hard to see the average Joe hanging on to their car for long. It is the U.S. though, I can imagine heavy lobbying resulting in laws that ruin it for everyone."
"> I don't think it's that black and white.

It's a matter of economics, when one option is significantly cheaper, it causes a massive disruption and rapid shift.

> Firstly (as mentioned elsewhere) electric vehicles take time to charge. This is inconvenient for many and probably puts some people off.

Remember the autonomous part, when it gets low, it takes itself to the charger...

> Also, ""autonomous taxis"" are only likely to work as well as public transport does currently - people enjoy having their own cars for a reason. Chances are a lot of people would rather have their own vehicle than get access to a pool of vehicles shared amongst thousands.

Again, you failed to think about usage and costs.  Having your own vehicle is really expensive, which is why outside of the USA it's not actually all that common.  Urban dwellers have already started to give up personal transport in the US for our current terrible public transit systems.  Personally owned vehicles sit idle 90-95% of their lifespan which is an enormous waste, self-driving taxis could pick up 30-40% savings on this factor alone.  

This is before you get into the significantly lower maintenance costs, and far cheaper build costs of Electric vehicles vs ICE.  Batteries are still expensive, but only because they have not seen economies of scale kick in yet, Electric cars will be far cheaper to make than gas vehicles in short order once production starts to scale.

There is a reason the wealthy have chauffeurs, it's really nice not having to drive when you don't want to, and the vast majority of people would happily reclaim the time currently lost to commuting.  

The jist of all this is people will be faced with the choice of spending 4-500 per month on average for their own vehicle that they have to drive themselves or spending less than half as much on fares and getting chauffeured everywhere.  It's not going to be a difficult choice for 99% of the population.

Finally by being autonomous and ubiquitous, there will be no waiting for a car to show up, they will be everywhere.  Think about how long it takes to hail a cab from manhattan, this will work about the same.

> Also, not all ICE usage is restricted to personal transport. You've got the freight industry which utilises many different methods of transport - most of which won't even benefit from the pros of electric powered engines.

Most freight ICEs are part of asymmetric hybrid systems anyway, switching from an ICE generator to batteries will be a joke in terms of simplicity, all that needs to happen is battery tech to improve enough to handle the energy requirements.

> You seem to equate the ICE being dead with vehicles becoming autonomous. These two aren't mutually exclusive.

Autonomous vehicles don't make sense with ICEs, they are much more complicated to operate, and mechanical failures the sensors couldn't see coming(rock in the radiator for example) are infinitely more common on ICE vehicles. Plus automated charging systems are quite safe, automated fuel filling systems not so much... I could go on all day, but if I am wrong, it will only be because things happen faster than I said.

Ocean going vessels will probably be the last holdouts, but as the ICE market dries up, their costs of ownership will rise until they too succumb.

I am a gear head, I love the sound of a well tuned engine and driving myself, but even I can see how clear the writing is on the wall, climate change alone would require this to happen, but the fact is simple economics will do the job anyway, cheaper always wins.

Edit: One final note, autonomous vehicles can travel several times more efficiently on existing roads and infrastructure than human drivers can. Do you think for one second that L.A. or other major cities would stick with the mess they have now given a choice?"

"I still think it is going to need a spoiler/more aero. Cars moving at extremely high speeds have a lot more interaction with the air than most people would think. Just look at all the videos of [Le Mans cars suddenly taking off like planes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHx9MePSBYk) and they are purpose built to be extremely close to the ground compared to street cars. When cars are extremely slippery through the air they want to take off at high speeds. It's less about center of gravity and more about the fact you need an active downward force counteracting it.The first little dip or bump you hit and your car wants to get airborne at ~250 miles per hour.  The low batteries definitely give an advantage but it's probably less than you might imagine. We don't know the stats for the Roadster but for comparison, the Model S has a center of gravity of 18 inches which is within .1 inch of the Subaru BRZ. I have no doubt the Roadster will be even lower but my point is despite it being extremely impressive it isn't in the earth-shattering realm of changing the physics for cars. Purpose built racecars like F1 cars have a center of gravity of ~6 inches and while not directly comparable they still have huge wings. "

600 miles... 
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd beat it by that much.  The Bugatti has a range of 291 miles compared to the Tesla‚Äôs 620.   That means the Tesla would only need one 30 min stop compared to the Bugatti‚Äôs 3 stops which could easily take 10 minutes each.

"First of all, thanking for showing me the math, this is fun.

So I checked your math, and it actually seems *correct*, I solved the problem using a couple other versions of the equation (such as calculating average acceleration first then get final position), and reached the same result.

However, real world data does not seem to agree with our equations. Please take a look at this link that has the performance data for the LaFerrari:
http://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/news/a25423/ferrari-laferrari-performance-test-numbers-0-60-quarter-mile/

Use the same set of parameters, 4.7s 0-100mph, 9.7s 1/4mile time, calculate for Vf.

Displacement by 100mph: 105.03m

So 295 meter needs to be covered within (9.7-4.7)s, with V0 now being 44.7m/s (100mph).

Using the same math we used, the final trap speed by 9.7s should be 163mph, but if you look at the test result, it's a much slower 149mph.

I don't think Road and Track messed up the test result (they are very professional and scientific), so it means we are not taking *something* into account."
"In addition to my last reply, here is another data point:
http://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-model-3-2018-car-of-the-year-finalist/

It's for the Tesla Model 3, 0-100mph 12s, quarter mile 13.4s.

Using the same equation, initial displacement by 12s is 268.2m, so apparently it covered the last 132 meters in a blistering 1.4 seconds, which requires acceleration of 70.8m/s^2 for 1.4s, which makes it reaches the final trap speed of wait for it

**321mph**.

So yeah, something is majorly wrong with our equation. Most likely we are not calculating the initial displacement correctly."
"Yep, I think I figured out the flaw in the equations. Without knowing how the acceleration is distributed within a time frame, you cannot calculate displacment by the end of that time, example:

Both vehicle A and B reaches 44.7m/s in 4s. Vehicle A has equal acceleration throughout the time, and its final position will be 89.4m. (using your math).

Vehicle B is weird, for the first 3 seconds it literally doesn't do anything but reaches 44.7m/s in the last one second. The displacement would be calculated using P = 0.5 * 44.7 * 1^2, and vehicle B only covers 22.35 meters.

Obviously this is an extreme example, but you can see how acceleration curve affects the result.

I'm pretty sure the equations you used *only* works for constant acceleration, which is very far from reality."
"You referenced a 1.2 million dollar hypercar developed by a Formula E racing team that has no clear plans to hit production, has a range a little over a 3rd of what Tesla claims, and has no where near the top speed of the proclaimed Tesla.

Bugatti sells lots of trims. You can buy a land speed car or one that goes 200 with all the trimmings. I would even expect the roadster to have a model with less battery so it can track better. That way it would have just enough for the ring to set a great time since it will be drastically tire limited from the weight.
"I understand correctly, you just aren't talking about what I'm talking about.  If you want to compare new price and new performance, the old Ferrari is a terribly overpriced slow car compared to even something boring like a modern Honda sedan.  Looking at it in proper historical context gives you a reason to recognize that even when it loses the price comparison and the performance comparison, there is a reason it's worth what it is worth.

If you still want to compare the Ferrari in its original time period to the new Tesla Roadster, the Tesla's performance is still as stunning as ever, but its value skyrockets to trillions of dollars because literally every government on the planet would be scrambling to possess that technology and the comparison makes no sense whatsoever."

"I see where you're coming from, but I still think the cooling will be more of a limiter in a track situation than any other factor.  Power to the ground is certainly limited from a stand still, thus all of the launch control systems these days.  But once the car is already at high speed and already accelerating, it would still be able to apply a lot more power than at take off without spinning the wheels, and this is the situation that occurs continuously on the track like OP was talking about.

And the added thermal mass and number of cells providing power doesn't provide a net benefit in terms of the heating situation.  That would only be true if the ratio of cell quantity to power output increased, in other words decreasing the power draw per cell.  While we don't have enough info to say for sure what's going on here in the new roadster, they could very well just be taking the huge power benefit of pulling from all of those cells at the same rate that they do in the high end Models S.  Given the absurd 10,000 Nm torque number they threw out, which I believe is around 10x what the P100D puts out, it appears they could be pulling even more power per cell here in the roadster."

This is correct. An ICE uses a motor to turn a crankshaft which in turn transfers power to the wheels and finally to the ground. A jet engine is not connected to the wheels at all. It‚Äôs power is transferred to the frame which is pushed forward. Since the wheels turn more easily than they skid they start spinning. Totally different methods to accomplish the same thing.

You just linked me a comment section where you have several instances of people talking about their triple digit experiences on the Autobahn
"Traffic density is a harder figure to get numbers on. The US government [keeps track of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per type of road](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2014/pdf/vm1.pdf) and this is easy enough to divide by road system mileage, but the German government doesn't seem to ever measure anything like this.

Since I'm far too interested in this, I tried estimating it a few different ways anyway and got answers ranging from 50% higher to 50% lower than US traffic. As it roughly works out, US vehicles are driven about 50% further per year and there are about 30% more per capita, but these are negated by Germany's 500% higher population density leading to much more compacted road network. The portion of local to highway traffic is the biggest wildcard, but in any case, it seems US Interstate and Autobahn traffic are similar enough.

Didnt know they had over heating issues. Thats a bummer. 
Mercedes claimed 44% efficiency in 2014 and the 50% claims came from the end of September 2017 (coincidentally after the flow rate was limited to 0.9l/100km I believe?)
Ahh fair enough
"Indeed, though I'd imagine efficiency would take a hit for higher rpm"
"Certainly it makes economic sense in cities, but economic sense would also mean everyone goes vegetarian - this isn't happening either. Not everyone lives in cities either so space is at less of a premium. The laws with regards to parking spaces in the US are already [very inefficient](https://www.youtube.comwatch?v=Akm7ik-H_7U) so at the very least there's enough space to facilitate the amount of cars we currently have. [Population almost globally is stalling so it's not like space is going to become even more of an issue.](https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=firefox-b-ab&dcr=0&ei=DSgSWo-sKsroaqmGrvAH&q=US+population+growth&oq=US+population+growth&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.5836.8311.0.8394.24.19.1.0.0.0.168.1859.10j8.18.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..5.19.1847...0i67k1j0i46i67k1j46i67k1j0i131k1j0i131i67k1j0i13k1j0i10k1.0.emluVObgFLg) In fact, with improvements in technology and travel time it's reasonable to expect that people could start to move away from cities.

Edit: The fact we live in a capitolist society means the markets are driven by the consumers. In China you could see it happen but in the US it certainly won't transition for economic efficiency. Once again, all of your arguments mean public transport should be ubiquitous, but it's far from it."
"I am not a he, but otherwise, yeah.  People who disagree just haven't really thought it through, shits obvious once you consider things a bit."
"Once again, this is all very speculative so it certainly could happen. I'm not saying it won't, just that it's far from guaranteed and there's a bunch of different scenarios across the country.

I don't think an autonomous fleet would necessarily be much cheaper to the consumer - the companies would have to have sufficient vehicles to guarantee almost instantaneous transport. They'll also need to make a profit, perhaps on top of the standard margin incurred by purchasing a car. This will of course be passed on the consumer.

If it all went down to cost, everyone currently would likely drive electric vehicles and have 1 vehicle per family, use public transport where possible. Once again, this is far from the norm."
"Yup, autonomous, shared, electric vehicles are the inevitable future. What are your thoughts on small business vehicles though? Vans, utes, small trucks, etc? I assume they will still need to be privately owned?

And what about car manufacturers? Do you see a lot going out of business? Because it seems to me that if you don't own the car then you aren't going to care too much about what it looks like. This really only leaves interior comfort and space to consider. And even then I can imagine 90%+ of journeys will be short distance, no luggage, commutes where these things need only be adequate (meaning most vehicles will surely be small cars). It just feels like there won't be the need for all the different brands and models we have today."
"> Having your own vehicle is really expensive, which is why outside of the USA it's not actually all that common.

Not sure where you're getting this from - it's very common almost globally. At least in developed society.

> Urban dwellers have already started to give up personal transport in the US for our current terrible public transit systems.

Yep, and this is something which is good. However not everyone lives in a city where it's often quicker and more convenient to take public transport.

>far cheaper build costs of Electric vehicles vs ICE

I mean this is far from true - Electric vehicles are prohibitively expensive and the ICE engines are becoming far more efficient (I recently got a turbo charged 1.0 litre engine that does >50mpg) for ¬£12000 new. Find me any electric vehicle at a comparable price point.

>Finally by being autonomous and ubiquitous, there will be no waiting for a car to show up, they will be everywhere. Think about how long it takes to hail a cab from manhattan, this will work about the same.

But 99% of the country doesn't live in Manhatten. Try hailing a cab in a regular town, it's damn near impossible. How many vehicles would you need to sustain a smaller sized town? Would it still be economically viable? Certainly not to the same extent.

>climate change alone would require this to happen, but the fact is simple economics will do the job anyway, cheaper always wins.

You could literally apply this exact sentence to going vegan, except to an even greater extent. Meat consumption is actually [increasing!](http://www.worldwatch.org/global-meat-production-and-consumption-continue-rise) Surely by your logic the opposite should happen?

I was born in 1980, and if you looked at a concept magazine for 2000 in '80. You would see what could potentially happen but didn't. I would say so far in my lifetime, the biggest changes I've seen are the internet and cellphones. They changed the world in the 37 years I've been alive. Go back 37 years before 1980 and you will see a couple innovations that also changed the world. We thought self driving, electric vehicles would be the norm by 2000.

"Alot of your reasoning is pretty sound, but I think your underestimating how much room for improvement ice has. It's amazing how the oems are pushing the limits of an ice, both in efficiency and emissions. Like someone said currently oil is the best bang for its buck in terms of energy and volume/density. Yes, the efficiency may not be as high as an electrical motor but there's lots of room for improvement. What Mazda is did and the belt start generstor technology are two examples. Ice will continue to get more efficient. 
Evs are definitely more accepted both socially and economically than say ten years ago but i think it has a long way to go before it overtakes ice. And don't forget, politics has a HUGE affect on which technology the oems will work on. It will be interesting to see of evs will continue to thrive under the current administration.

It's also extremely rare to be pulled over just for accelerating quickly. Typically it's only if you're having an acceleration contest.
Interesting. Doesn't exist in my state but I see a lot of ppl in CA getting tickets for it. 
"Yes, the equation I used is part of a group of equations called, ""kinematics equations"" which are only exact, when there is constant acceleration. Otherwise it will give the average acceleration, which will skew velocities. I used these because Tesla cars only have one gear, meaning there is no loss to power from the engine/motor to the wheels, unlike ICE cars. This is why Tesla cars also have a leg up in quarter mile times, because they don't have to pause 4 times to switch gears. They also have the instant power, which is a big factor as well.

You cannot use these equations on an ICE car, because of the gears, and how the power is sent to the wheels. Since it is individual explosions from each cylinder, the acceleration changes every single time an explosion happens. So not only do you have 0 acceleration between gears, but also between each explosion(which I know is minimal with more cylinders, but a comparison between constant motor, and ICE engines, makes this even more exaggerated). 

That being said, you can calculate the average acceleration, and thus average velocity of any car between two points. The more points you have, the more your average acceleration will change to look more like the actual acceleration over time. 

Even then, with ICE engines, it's much harder to tell at slower speeds, since there's still a switch in gears. If there was a measurement of time it takes to go from the start of one gear, to the redline of the same gear, for all the gears in a car, that would be using the same technique that I was using for the Tesla, and give Better results, but still not the exact results. 

I looked up the acceleration rates of P100D over time, compared to Porsche 911 Turbo S, and Ferrari LaFerrari, and found that the Tesla starts with an acceleration of 1.4g, and at 6 seconds, drops to .5g. Meanwhile the Porsche and Ferrari both start around 1g, and drop down to about .6g, after 6 seconds. 

This means that the equation I used isn't as accurate as I thought... however, that doesn't mean it isn't still close.

If you use the first source you gave me, and find the distance it traveled from 0-30mph, 30-60mph, 60-100mph, 100-150mph, and you add all the distances together, you should get in the ballpark of a quarter mile. It's actually400.77048 Meters and a quarter mile is 402.336 meters. Which makes sense, since if you take enough data points, between infinitely small velocity differences, over infinitely small time differences, that's just the derivative of the acceleration, which is how you find velocity from acceleration. 

With that being said, I do think that the roadster is probably lower than 200 lol. Without more data points, that is a pretty far stretch to say the least. If we had more data like the example you gave, it would be much easier to tell, but it was just released a few days ago so I don't blame the dude. Sorry for the misinformation!"
"I didn't say it would outperform it, i was merely using it as an example of electric vehicles being capable of sustained performance.

But yes, i do expect Tesla will be able to get similar performance out of a much cheaper vehicle, for a number of reasons. 

First of all, i doubt the EP9 would actually cost anywhere near 1.2 million per unit to do a reasonable production run. The problem is amortizing development/production setup costs across such a small run.

Tesla also will also have the advantage of better optimized batteries, both in cost and performance. The larger battery pack should actually be an advantage, since it will be able to spread the load more widely across a number of cells, thus requiring a less robust cooling system and resulting in less wear and tear.

They also have more experience in doing reasonably sized production runs than NIO, though as the model 3 is showing, they aren't *great* at it."
"Top speed is limited a lot more by drag than weight, though weight does of course affect performance a lot more in other metrics, such as acceleration and cornering.

The large battery pack is actually an advantage for higher sustained performance. Getting a sustained 1 megawatt out of a 100kWh pack is a lot harder and needs more cooling than a 200kWh pack, but even if it doubled the weight of the car, which it wouldn't, that would not affect top speed very much. Acceleration can also be improved in some circumstances.

Say a 100kWh pack weighs 500kg, and the car an additional 1000kg. Generous figures i know, it's closer to 600 and 1500 in a 100D, but just let me use round numbers.
Doubling the battery pack size to 200kWh approximately doubles the battery weight. It should actually be slightly less, but call it double. The car's powertrain, chassis and suspension will all need to be improved, call it another 250kg. So the weight has gone from 1500kg to 2250kg. 50% more weight, but 100% more available power to draw, and a more powerful motor. Now obviously the power output at the wheels won't be double, and traction is still a limiting factor, but your power to weight ratio should still be better, resulting in more, or at least equal acceleration.

The point is that simply adding more battery is actually a good way to improve performance (up to a point, you do get diminishing returns pretty quickly), particularly acceleration and sustained top speed, though at some cost to handling ability. 

I fully believe the roadster 2 will be able to meet it's performance claims, and sustain a high top speed. The track performance will be interesting however. It should have no problem being able to go like a bat out of hell every time it comes onto a straight, but the cornering will probably be worse than the EP9, though i expect it to still be respectable."

This isn't speculative it's experience."
"Exactly.  The cooling improvements are already big but what we all want is for the cooling issue to be absolutely gone.  I'm fairly certain there won't be any X number of laps limit like we have now, that was a limitation that emerged from the pack after the car's battery was already designed, and there's no need to follow that constrained pack's dimensions on future cars, so we'll undoubtedly get excessive cooling - at least on Performance cars.

Extra power is needed only when you are at high speed. And the amount of extra power needed is equal to the power needed to overcome drag. Electric motors drop torque at high rpm so the high torque rating is not relevant because they are only available at low speed.

It was also very unforgiving, to where the moment one part started to wear, you'd see signs of tire cupping (which they're now in a lawsuit over in certain models).

My guess is they'd have to redesign it in order to fit a 200 kwh battery pack and the cost for a new design coupled with a battery pack at least twice as expensive just wouldn't see enough demand at that price to make it worthwhile when 300 + supercharging is sufficient.

"I disagree. It's commonplace when new cars are unveiled that their characteristics are compared to existing cars. For example, the Porsche Mission E [compared as a Tesla killer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/09/14/porsches-tesla-killer-a-superfast-electric-sports-car-that-can-read-your-emotions/?utm_term=.bf93a86afee6). Similarly, when the Chevy Bolt was unveiled its price and range were compared with that of the Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model S. To say that, when a new car is unveiled, that you can't compare it to any other existing car until you can buy it is silly. You do so with the stipulation that change can happen by the time the car goes into production.

But we will find that too many rural areas and even suburbs are unsustainable in the long term if they feed off another city."
">What are your thoughts on small business vehicles though? Vans, utes, small trucks, etc? I assume they will still need to be privately owned?

Those are harder to predict, it's going to depend a lot on the type of business and the actual needs they have for transporting items/employees.  Generally speaking though, any company big enough to have a company vehicle will most likely continue to have one as work vehicles are used far more often and thus the ability to share them becomes a negligible gain at best.

As for the manufacturers, yeah I am betting several will fall, they are just not taking this shift seriously enough, and I think the last 100 years of stability in the automotive world(think about how many new successful car makers have sprung up in established markets during that time) have left them far too complacent to deal with the turbulence coming.  Most are run by bean counters and forward thinking runs only to the next quarter so they have little chance of weathering the coming storm.  That being said, markets in flux are rife with new opportunities, and hopefully when the shakeup is finished there will be more companies rather than less, as there is already too few.  Hell half the reason the pace of progress in the automotive realm has been so slow is the lack of competition."

"> What about the farmers combine during harvest, or the flower delivery person and there businesses car. 

Farmer would be far better off with electric combine than ICE one.  Infrequent use is really hard on ICEs, electric is ideal for this application.  These vehicles are also going autonomous already as well as they are even more suited to robot drivers than street vehicles.

>or the flower delivery person and there businesses car.

Business vehicles are not private, in many cases they are already active enough to marginalize savings from vehicle sharing.  That said, flower delivery companies (and other such small package companies) will most likely be using drones by that point instead of vehicles.

"Diesel is the only ICE with a chance at hitting efficiency levels high enough, HCCI engines are an interesting concept but they are far too complicated to compete with electrics once the market hits critical mass.

The part you missed here is the deal where battery improvements are universal across the tech realm, what makes your smartphone battery cheaper and last longer works exactly as well on your car battery.  This is decidedly not so for ICE improvements, ICE engines rarely even share designs between applications.  This will push r&d budgets into the electric category quite quickly once the shift starts in earnest as the return on investment will be far greater(company that makes a massive jump in battery tech will make far more money than mazda will off that HCCI engine).

"Even though there is only one gear on the P100D, with an electric motor there is actually quite a bit of torque drop off after a certain speed. Additionally, even with near constant power output, the actual acceleration will drop off quite quickly due to much increased air resistance.

In fact, with EVs the acceleration drop off is actually more significant than ICE cars (also supported by the data you looked up). If you look at the number I crunched for LaFerrari, it's actually quite close to the ideal condition of constant acceleration, but the number for the Model 3 is so far off it's just comical, which is caused by the huge drop off in acceleration of that car.

But you are right, without knowing more data we can only take rough guesses at this point. My bet is that it will be about 165-170mph in trap speed, which is still damn close to record shattering for production road cars.

It might completely destroy most regular sports car on the first lap or two, but it's nowhere near supercar caliber and many 200k sports car will beat it on the track. They probably won't be as convenient outside track day, tho."

"See, you don't even understand why they're so expensive... it's not even something that would really benefit from economies of scale. It's the batteries - they cost $12-15000 and it's essentially just scaling up the same tech as they use for smaller batteries. "
"Perhaps, but the point of mentioning HCCI wasn't that they can compete with EV, but that there is a ton of room for improvements as technology improves. 
I'm not sure the improvements in battery and how it applies in different applications, but ICE engines shares improvements outside the automobile industry. Shipping, heavy machinery, military (huge), generators, etc. 

Yes, I agree the shift has started, or at least the attempt to shift. However, there are still big road blocks along the way. Cost is still one of them. Yes, as you said due to economy of scale the cost of battery is falling.But EVs are still expensive to their ICE counter part (Focus vs Focus Electric). Even with economy of scale, I'm doubtful of how low the cost of battery will reach. The cost bottleneck would be lithium. Also, the battery life in cold climate regions is another hurdle. "
"It's absolutely relevant! From an engineering perspective, all I need is a shaft that spins reliably with some torque spec and rpm range, a portable energy source for the shaft, replenishable parts, easily serviced, prevalent distribution of parts, safety, and trained technicians. There's a harbor freight near a coffee shop across this country, there's more gas stations than there are starbucks and dunkin donuts combined, and there's mechanics everywhere.

Automotive techs rarely die from the energy source of the cars they're working on. Electricians and engineers get smoked all the fucking time. Take insurance costs, and training costs, and time for safety protocols in to account.

I've seen $15,000 ""industrial"" shit with reputable household brand names go up in smoke fresh off the factory floor breaking the crate and peeling off the plastic. 0% serviceability unless you replace windings on a whim and can count to really big numbers accurately. I've seen a 1-5/8"" hardened flange shaft break off from the torque of an electric motor. You're tearing a motor down to its shell and replacing a lot of copper windings to get that shaft replaced. On an ICE, a crank is a crank... I can replace a plastic cam in about 20 minutes. The point is you *can* do things either way at a ridiculous cost swing. Your point is ridiculous utopia where EV cost the same to acquire and operate is lunacy from an engineering/economic perspective.

On the flipside, motors for things like a beard trimmer are pennies to make motors for but a gas powered beard trimmer, while comical and cool factor, isn't feasible. Different tools for different problems I guess. The breakpoint is probably around 3-5 horsepower (240V * 20 amps * 80% * 80% service factor = 3072 watts -> horsepower ~4 horsepower) bigger than that, and shit gets really expensive very quickly. You're trying to shoehorn batteries and motors in a place where it's not viable due to not being prevalent. So making a statement about autonomous EV being the norm is a dream because we're still fighting about fucking coal fired plants for some reason... EV are by all definitions obscure and exotic.

"Why would you take that bet? The Roadster didn't even appear to have any aero which is one of the most important things for a track like that. Just look at the weight of the Model S at 4,941 lbs vs the 720s at 2,829 lbs. Even if the Roadster is a shit ton lighter than the Model S it's still going to be grossly overweight for a car trying to go around a track. You can't out accelerate physics no matter what your 0-60 time is. I can also tell the low cost means it's going to have a lot less super light structural materials than the 720s. Cars like the Performante destroy quicker cars on active aero alone. The Roadster has almost nothing going for it for track performance given what we know. "
"Nah I haven't, I have s75 2017 and an accord touring 2017, and comparing these two is like comparing an ant to a blue whale. Even if the model 3 is a 1/10 of a model s, it still shits all over ur civic, don't @ me "
"Hmm, looking at this [list of 20 fastest 2017 production cars](http://www.gayot.com/lifestyle/automobile/lists/top_fastestcars/hennessey-venom-gt.html) I admit that they all have a certain over the top styling that's common with HotWheels toy cars where the Tesla is much more aerodynamically simple like a bullet and one you'd expect would fit in with $80-180k cars, not $800k+ cars. I'll give you that.

The numbers are both reflective of [what the prototype can do](https://youtu.be/aXWfL-1ieuE?t=56m19s) and conservative. When looking at Tesla's reputation thus far, while their new models are always delayed, the performance numbers they eventually deliver it with are always a little better than what they promised.

On your last point, yeah I'll agree that being a $200k car means they won't be a limited production run of 1,000 or less like the super cars in my first link so yes, less exotic in rarity. "

Hi!
What's also cool if you look at [said absolute category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_speed_record) is that the first six record-holders used *electric* vehicles (and the seventh steam)
"America is all about speed. Hot, nasty, badass speed. ‚Äî Eleanor Roosevelt, 1936."
"You realize how fast 120mph is?  Hardly anybody is blazing the roads at 120 and if they are it's a car capable of going much faster. A car with a top speed of 220 will drive at 120 pretty comfortably, a daily driver with a top speed of 140 is going to feel like every bolt is about to explode when you're going 120, and every little bump wants to grab the steering from you"
how nice for a sample size of 4.

"Seriously no offense but your cars are nothing special.  As someone whose very stable economically, I easily could afford multiple of those vechiles. But that's not the point- you just never experienced premium treatment like a Bugatti owner would because you own nothing equivalent or even close. A rich person will not be unconvinced owning a Bugatti needing maintenance or an update, so I'm glad I could teach you something today."
"You sound pretty 99% to me...

"Generally speaking, no, but the Focus RS hatch still looks good to me. 

I don't know what it is exactly, i guess it's just not for me. "
"They do, but it doesn‚Äôt eliminate the effect of air resistance.

But the reason for more drop off in acceleration at higher speed is a combination of electric motor characteristics, battery heat limitations, and the fact that there is only one gear in transmission.

Due to the one gear limit, you can‚Äôt put down max power at higher speed, that‚Äôs why they tried to have 2 gears for the original Roadster, and I bet you they probably did that for this one as well. 

The Rimmac electric super car has a 5 speed gearbox I think? So does Formula E cars and the Nio9 EV that set record on the Nurburgring. So it‚Äôs actually the norm for racing EVs apparently."

"GTR is half the price, and also fuck the GTR"
"> Chiron is not quick around a track compared to a light car

Neither are Tesla's, but the Bugatti are still very good around a track. They're similar in weight, a Model S is above 4,000 lbs, the Roadster might be lighter but not by much. A Chiron is 4,400 lbs the SuperSport might shed 80 lbs, but that's hardly relevant. The Bugatti Veyron SuperSport still beat a Zonda F (around 2,700 lbs, and was already a monster of a car) by 1 second on Top Gear and held the crown for a while. Chiron SuperSport will be out by 2020 and will likely be even faster.

It's not a light car, but it's still very much a supercar and still kickass a lot of ass around a track."

lol fuck off with aerodynamics. the roadster is a slippery piece of shit that has no downforce and will understeer into the next universe if you take a corner any faster than 20. the car is made to go in a straightline and puke out some numbers that make fanboys like you jizz in their pants.

"**Land speed record**

The land speed record (or absolute land speed record) is the highest speed achieved by a person using a vehicle on land. There is no single body for validation and regulation; in practice the Category C (""Special Vehicles"") flying start regulations are used, officiated by regional or national organizations under the auspices of the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile. The land speed record (LSR) is standardized as the speed over a course of fixed length, averaged over two runs (commonly called ""passes""). Two runs are required in opposite directions within one hour, and a new record mark must exceed the previous one by at least one percent to be validated.

"Yeah I thought that was a weird thing about Tesla cars that they only have one gear. It's to reduce strain on a gear box while trying to also give it the ability to accelerate really quickly. They don't even need a gear, they can make it gear-less, but the strain on the car would be so much more. I'd love to see the roadster have gears though and see what kind of speeds it can achieve! "
You‚Äôve obviously never driven a GTR. Or raced one during an autocross event. 
Why fuck the GTR? It‚Äôs so much fun 
"Out of the 500 Bugatti Chiron's sold I can pretty much guarantee you very, very few are not used to enter COTA or other races..

I could Google 100x more videos of MILLION dollar cars JUST doing 1/4 miles or a street race or just topping out on the autobahn.. 

Your videos are professional drivers, driving at extreme speeds and angles requiring professional reaction time, etc. (Laps, Racing, Etc) Most owners DO NOT do this with their multimillion dollar investment... lol

You don't need to be a professional racer to do a 1/4 mile or street drag..

So my point is if you want to show up to a drag strip or street race and own a fucking 3 million dollar car with a 200,000$ electric vehicle you're gonna do it.. So for all the rich kids who want to own streets and drag strips, (And multi-million dollar super cars) I can guarantee you Tesla Roadsters will be seen at all the drag strips and street races..

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tesla+street+race

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tesla+1%2F4+mile+race

Those two searchs are just with Tesla's current lineups.. I can imagine in 2-4 years when you search  ""Tesla Roadster vs <ANY MILLION DOLLAR CAR>"" You'll see TONS of videos of them owning them!!!"
">Otherwise you're just sad that Tesla made something bad ass.

See, this seems to be one of the issues with Tesla fanboys. You think everyone that criticizes them is somehow butthurt.

Not once did I say the Roadster was shit, or that it wasn't a bad ass car. As someone who has built and raced cars, I have full respect for the technology and advancement Tesla is doing.

My problem is always going to be the fanboys who consider everything non-Tesla to be beneath them. As a sub dedicated to a car  manufacturer, you guys show an awful lack of respect for other manufacturers.

Also, this is hardly a direct comparison. The price tags alone should have let you know that. They are two completely different cars in completely different markets.

**EDIT:** In case you missed my comment from 2 hours ago in a different chain.

>Yup. I've got nothing against Elon or Tesla. I think they're doing great things both for Elons apparent hard on for space exploration, and Teslas work with electric vehicles. As with everything however, it's the extreme fanboys that just get tiring. It's a circlejerk.

So no, I am not sad. In fact, I'm excited to try my hand at heavily modifying electric cars alongside combustion engines."
"Yeah and it was a completely different car. It was a two seater with a lot less batteries and smaller motors built on a Lotus platform. The new Roadster is a much larger car. The Lotus platform is extremely cramped and pretty much the smallest, lightest car on the market. They make Civics look huge by comparison. The new Roadster is a whole lot bigger. The old one you had to be fairly short to fit into and you were rubbing shoulders with your passenger pretty much. https://imgur.com/a/33nFi The new car is a completely different class of car as it is a more spacious 4 seater grand touring type car. The weight of each isn't comparable at all. For context the original Lotus ICE platform weighed 725 kg when it was released. That's how tiny those cars are.

"Yeah I guessed it. Was obvious from a mile away. Really expensive American-made Trucks & SUVs, new-money type boastful attitude, etc. 

Regardless, I can't seem to be able to make a Ford King Ranch cost more than $60,000 CAD. I even got a fully optioned out Platinum and still only got $67,000 CAD. How does your truck cost 94k USD again? If it was a new Ford Raptor with a bunch of very expensive mods I'd say you could probably get close I'm a little curious how tf you go that 94k figure....  but I'm not an expert in trucks, I drive BMWs. 

You said 400k? If you're not talking out of your ass (it's very possible to make that much in oil, I just don't know you're really at that level, it's the internet; we have no proof), at 400k you're just barely scratching the surface of the 1%. In this vast 1% there are billionaires too. You're not at their level, and they're the pick-my-Bugatti-up-while-I'm-Away-in-Monaco type people. At 400k, you're upper upper middle class to entry level rich class (low lvl millionaire by net worth only). Technically, anyone over 180-200k is 'upper class' and not middle class (though the tax code makes even bigger distinctions), but where live in Eastern Ontario, 400k is considered the entry-level rich person's income. The type of people buying these Bugattis are multi millionares, not people making 400k/yr. https://www.investopedia.com/news/how-much-income-puts-you-top-1-5-10/

Basically you flexed a little too hard in your other comments and don't really have the guns to show for it. You can still flex, just bring it down a bit. Also, it was a bit cringey too the way you boorishly boasted like that. A bit typical of new-money oil type guys. Also I get it, you probably came from a working-class family and you made it big now. You're living the American dream. You're doing well and you probably work hard, just don't cringe anyone out by listing the price of your shit like that. lol

"Had a GTR for 3 years, never had it overheat on the track any more than my buddy's E63 M6 did. My transmission temps worried me more in stop-go traffic during the summer than they did on the track.

Launching is extremely hard on the transmission (a lot of force in short bursts), and it does heat up quite a bit compared to sustained track use, where you have a constant flow of air cooling the various heat exchangers. Granted, the transmission cooling wasn't the best on the 09-11 GTRs (mine was an 09), newer models have a better trans oil cooler and better ducting to it, but that still only helps with track performance- not with repeated launching where you're stopping/idling in between (and thus, getting little or no air to your trans oil cooler).

At the end of the day, as far as launching is concerned, it's a different beast for any vehicle and very hard on all of the moving parts in the drivetrain AND any of the battery/converters/misc. electrical systems in an EV. Sustained high performance around a track is where people have concerns with battery cooling and it's from experience, usually. There are many gasoline/hybrid cars in that price range that will do a full day at the track for you, no problem. I doubt any of them can do repeated hard launches without a significant cooling down period between every 1-2."

"Absolutely.  The good news is, you won't spend a lot of time actually buying your Tesla - it's not the standard dealership experience so you schedule your test drive (if you even want to) and the rest is done from home on your spare time whenever that might be.  The physically there part is just Delivery, and that takes ~30 minutes of paper signing and a quick how-to-Tesla tutorial in the car before you're driving away.  It's a very fast and smooth experience aimed at people with absolutely no time to spare."

Also, don't talk about patronizing when you make yourself look silly pretending you're richer than you are and then listing your objects like we're at an auction. Actual rich people don't bother doing that. I'll be a personal source for that. "

"/u/momojabada never actually mentioned anything about the Roadster waiting between launches. His original point was about sustained track performance, that's probably why everyone was shitting all over your original comment. (I'm not trying to come off as an ass with that statement, just making an observation)

I totally agree with your point that there's no reason to scoff because the Roadster was waiting a bit between launches. If they wanted to give the VIPs (that are likely going to make up most of the Founders orders) and media there the best experience, they had to. And it would hold true for any high performance vehicle with an aggressive launch mode.

But I think you were arguing with the wrong person about it. His concern, and I think the concern with most dissenters of the Roadster's performance, is ""What about a track day? Will it do multiple 10-20 lap runs without severe performance degradation?"""
"I'd imagine that if the autox course was set up for them, they could be pretty solid competitors. Most of the ones I go to are in the ATL region though and it's usually shirt straights, slaloms, and tight corners. Excellent for Focus ST's, miatas, integras, evos, E36 M3s, etc."

I'm aware, I just couldn't add 20k in packages in Canada. Or maybe I was looking at the 150. I don't know, I don't do trucks, just recently got interested in the new raptor with some aftermarket upgrade packages on it but that's it. In the US I'm not aware what options you have but the US ford website is fucky as fuck with zip code requirements and confusing model options. You choose the model at the first page and then it makes you re-choose the model based on wheel configuration or w.e. the shit. I don't know, never used their site before, bad & intuitive UI. I could figure it out but I don't have time for that shit so I just asked you. Maybe you could be like 'brakes, liftkit, the upgraded engine, etc.' and save me the hassle.

What is wrong with people if they want a head like that on a beer?
"Perfect? My sir that is much more than 2 finger widths. 

Source: am bartender"
"Perfectly awful?

You'll need to:

1) Wait half an hour for the head to dissolve.

2) Claw half of it out with your fingertips.

3) Suck up a load of froth.

4) Try to drink it but instead get a shit load of froth going up your nose before you get to the liquid line.

5) Ask to return it and get a new glass and bottle and pour it yourself because whatever did that is an abomination. "
Schoefferhofer? Beer from the Saupreissen.
"Yep, perfect pour. "
I won‚Äôt allow it to jiggle my Julius Echter like that. 
as a german i am **obliged to comment on anything about beer!! that's my trope!!!!! i am very interesting!!!!!!!!**
Just one?
"It really isn't hard to get a good pour.  Assuming your CO2 mixture is right, it's simply a matter of inclining the glass just so as you pour.  It only takes a few attempts to get good at it.  "

"I've drank a lot of beer, but I've never seen it shaken like this. Is this to add more foam/head and does that enhance the flavor? Or it more of a cosmetic thing to make the beer look more presentable? "

"Maybe it's not a camera person, but instead a camera robot."
"I'm not familiar with this particular robot, but some robots (at least the Fanuc robots I've used) have a software safety system where you can setup zones that are okay for the robot to be in and it will stop if the robot tries to leave that zone (DCS is the Fanuc name for it). It is possible something like that is in use here (though, I agree that it is unlikely). "
HAHAHA BEER
The robot is a Reis RV-60 and costs about 70.000‚Ç¨ as far as I know.
Yes that's the joke
I like drinking but don't like beer. In the tech industry there is an obsession with beer that is sometimes annoying to me. Why does the meetup always have to be at a brew pub??
"> But then you've got the actual factory workers 

They need to come to Germany, there's smoking in offices and (light) beer in the canteen fridge to go with lunch."
They are. Probably took some experimenting to get the angles and timing right.
"It's something typically done with wheat beers, as some of the yeast settles at the bottom. You shake the last bit and add it to the beer to give it more flavour"
"If you drink Hefeweizen/Wei√übier, you should do it to get all the yeast out of the bottle. "
Tease
"In Boston, they program the robot to get the yeast mixed in BEFORE it opens the bottle "
"But look at the attention to detail, getting the last bit of yeast in there. "

Hah I was gonna say this seems like it's from Germany. I've only ever seen Germans pour beer like this
"More like Teslaweiterentwickeitautomatisierungwerks

"You don't need an apostrophe there, by the way. "
"For Hefeweizens and dunkelweizens (which I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what this beer is based off the color and the glass), that‚Äôs the ‚Äúproper‚Äù amount of foam as dictated by ze Germans. The reason is something about showing that it‚Äôs a properly brewed weizenbier, or the aroma, or the flavor, depending on who you ask. It‚Äôs a highly carbonated beer to start with, and you generate some extra foam by swirling the bottle to get out all the yeast, which is where a lot of the important flavor is. "
"In Germany this is the norm, required even. Germans like head."
Depends on the beer
"Weizen beers always have a big head, you'll hardly be able to pour it without one because it has a high CO2 concentration. And yeah German beers often have a lot of foam, we drink our beer cold and with lots of CO2 (as opposed to many English ales which are a lot flatter and are usually served ""almost warm"" or at least warmer than any German beer)"
">EDIT: Expresses opinion and asks honest question. gets downvoted.

It's like saying: ""Does anyone actually like their pasta chewy? I always boil it till it falls apart on the tongue. Also, I prefer to not use salt"". There is a proper way to do it as dictated by tradition. It is fine if you like it differently, just like I like pineapple on pizza. But I don't go around telling Italians that they are not making pizza properly if they don't put pineapple on it (or even imply it. I don't have a death wish)."
That is the way to pour a German Weissbier.
In my opinion - Need more foam for more flavour on thicker ales when trying to taste the hint of citrus etc etc. and less foam on crisper lagers for that hot day.
"I'd say about half of that is a good balance. 

All these people making up bullshit reasons for why the beer should be 25% foam can't convince me otherwise. "
"I'm fond of of the saying of Charlie Bamforth, Prof. of Brewing at UC Davis: ""Pour with vigor."" An aggressive pour releases the aroma of the beer more readily."
"Asian countries prefer a very heady bear, I‚Äôve heard. "
"Thats how german beer is served, it's a symbol of frehness and therefore a well carbonated beer. No foam means it's stale and not fresh"
"Depends on beer and culture. In Czech Republic the height of foam is one of main qualities of beer. I guess like 4cm? It's obsession to the point where czech will return his beer if it doesn't have the right foam.



General guideline is that if you don't have to wipe your mouth after drinking it, It's not high enough :))"
"This is a hefeweizen. They are known for their massive head due to the wheat in the recipe and generally being more highly carbonated than other beers.  And this is the proper pour, right down to the shaking up the bottle to get the sediment at the bottom. The Germans take their beer serving very seriously. "
According to brewmasters about 1/4 of your glass should be head in order to release the correct amount of CO2 to enhance the flavor and to slightly reduce the bloat feeling after drinking a beer. 
">EDIT: Expresses opinion and asks honest question. gets downvoted.

You must be new to Reddit...

Also, you're right about the beer and I upvoted you. The droids of Reddit (60%+ population) probably downvoted you. "
Not in America. I would ask for a new pour if there was any head on a beer. 
"Apparently we're in the minority. 

All this nonsense about it being the only way Germans can tell a beer is fresh or that they need the barely noticeable extra hint of aroma to appreciate its taste seems like excuses given by traditionalists who've always had lazy bartenders. "
"I'm not a fan of it either on normal beer and I always try to pour it with as little a head as possible, but as many others have noted, this **is** how you pour that kind of beer here in Germany.

That being said, people usually drink this beer as either a hefeweizen (which is what you're seeing here, the robot does a little swirl at the end to get the yeast and all the flavor out) or a kristallweizen without the swirl, which usually is a tad less foamy as well"
Do you pour German beers?  I hope not. 
it's perfect 
"Not every ""proper"" pour should have the same amount of head. It varies by style. But in the end, it really doesn't matter all that much."
"Depending on the style of beer you want a thick head. Going off the bottle alone I‚Äôm assuming this is a Belgian or wheat beer which benefits greatly from a thick head. It alters the aroma of the beer as you drink it, changing the flavor a bit and giving it more complexity. That being said, drink beer however you want. I don‚Äôt care. "
"Stab in the dark, you drink Busch light?"
"You obviously don't drink real beer. This is either a hef or wheat beer since the robot shakes up the bottom to stir up the sediment which adds to flavor of the beer. Fresh Hefeweizen in Germany is amazing.

If you don't let beer foam on the pour, then it foams up in your stomach. Pick your battles. "
3 is the point. Li'l froth on me nose too.
You know there's a reason for head on beers right?  It's not some unintended side effects it's part of the drink.  That also really isn't that much head on that beer that's a pretty perfect pour. And in a lot of beers the head doesn't stick around that long anyways so it's really not that big of a deal
You sound like someone who knows very little about beer but loves pretending to in public.
[removed]
There is nothing good about the head on a beer. I scoop it off too. Tastes like acid and metal and gets in the way of drinking when it's gigantic like this one. I'll go with you to downvote land.

Seems like it takes up a bit of space.
I wouldn‚Äôt mind a couple horse-beer-pourers in my house 
"I can do it, but it would be way cooler to have a beer pouring robot. "
It's still intoxicating though.
Its usually done with unfiltered beers because of settling that can happen. I usually do this with a heffe/whit beer.
"This is done to rouse the yeast from the bottom of the bottle. In unfiltered, or bottle conditioned beers, yeast settles at the bottom of the bottle. If the style of beer intends to have the yeast in the beer while your drink it, you have to get it off the bottom and into the glass. I‚Äôll typically do this by laying the unopened bottle on its side and rolling it on the counter. You can also do it by swirling the last bits of the beer in the bottle, and then pouring. "
It's to get all the deposited stuff off from the bottom of the bottle into your glass.
Several styles of beer include leaving yeast in the beer when bottling that eventually settles and leaves a yeast cake at the bottom of the bottle. By mixing that yeast in to the last little bit and pouring it into the beer it enhances the flavor of the beer. This is especially popular in styles whose flavors are primarily yeast driven such as wheat ales and belgian style ales.
"For bottle conditioned beers, there will be a layer of yeast at the bottom.  In many beers, especially Belgians, this yeast is fucking delicious and you can either swirl the bottom and drink it straight, or add it back to the beer you've poured.

Try this with a Belgian dubbel or quad, taste before and after and you'll see the difference it makes."

Here's a short informational video on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfxPBogK-WI
It holds in flavor. 
"that proves, that you know nothing about Hefeweizen, I've never seen pouring Hefeweizen without shaking the nearly empty bottle, the robot does it exactly the right way! Really!"

"But then without proof, how will we know that robot has a camera?"
So true. I'm not a big drinker but I enjoy a good beer at times. It's just part of winding down after all the stress these tech jobs put you through with deadline after fucking critical deadline.
"Where would you like to meet up?

Pubs often have good ambience and open spaces for talking to people at the bar. And has appetizer food on the menu that's pretty good."
Germans definitely do not smoke in their office because it is illegal. 
"No thanks for smoking in offices, but I'll take some fo the beer int he canteen fridge."
"Not in factories. I worked in a few and i certainly would have gotten into a lot of trouble if someone would have seen me drinking alcohol at work. Even the small machine shops (and simillar companies) i worked at had a very strict policy on this stuff. This was very different like 15-20 years ago, but these days, drinking at work wasn't allowed anywhere i worked at (at least in factories and other manual labour jobs). Smoking can be a bit different, but in my experience most workplaces got very strict on that too in the last 10 years."

It would be really hard to get less head with a weizen.
"It's a schofferhofer, possibly a schofferhofer dunkel, so it's definitely a hefeweizen. This bot poured it correctly."
"> For Hefeweizens and dunkelweizens (which I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what this beer is based off the color and the glass)

Not to mention the swirling of the last bit of beer to stir up the settled yeast to add to the glass."
And a really good at giving head.

Which beers do you prefer with lots vs. not much head?
"Yea, 1/4 foam sounds terrible. I'm calling bullshit on that."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMMa8uR2-0

TLDW; You have to have ""head""/foam in the beer because it breaks up the co2. If you don't, then it'll break up in your stomach and it is a common reason people have stomach problems/bloating after drinking."
This is just incorrect. 
"Keep Yourself Safe, Friend"
That's definitely what it sounds like to me. I really enjoy having a beer that is cold and the foam on top hits room temperature so quickly.
Just because it's tradition in Germany doesn't mean it's right.

"I can fully understand one that is half that size, it makes it serve the actual purpose of the beer as in to be drunk without needing a towel.

I love any beer with some head ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
"A lot of brands that have their own glassware have a line which the beer is to be filled to and the rest is generally head. Head as a teenager means crappy pour but that‚Äôs generally cause 3/4 of it is head. If I get a beer with no head I would imagine it would be kind of flat or sat for awhile before being served to me.  In Germany of you don‚Äôt get a beer with head on it you would see many send it back, it doesn‚Äôt happen (getting no head) often. "
"God I hate this video because it's such bullshit. This guy shows he knows pretty much dick about what's going on. The CO2 doesn't ""break up."" It is a gas dissolved in a liquid. And unless you pour your beer so aggressively that you like to drink it essentially flat, then there will be plenty of dissolved CO2 left in your beer. The reason people feel bloated or have stomach problems after drinking beer is usually because they drink too much, not because they didn't pour their beer properly.

In reality there are two reasons that head is good in beer. 1) Aesthetics. It looks nice. 2) It helps to release aroma which is critical in the perception of a beer's flavor."

But yeah, Rochefort 10 is about 2,2 euro in the supermarket here. If you can get it in a bar it's around 4-5 euro as well.

Still, it's worth it no matter what the price, it's not a beer that you want to have often, too good for that. Everyone into beers should taste it at least once in their lifetime."

To suggest America ""can't"" use renewable energy for 100% of our energy needs is simply ignorant.

Denmark - 140% with *wind alone* at highest point. (Note -
 Denmark normally is not good about their consumption, honestly)

~~Germany - >100%, government had to actually pay people because of it.~~ Fuck Germany, whatever.

Norway - 100% from hydropower recently, but made 97% most of the time before with the last 3% from wind.

Iceland - 100% from thermal and combination of others.

Costa Rica - 99% from renewable for the whole year...*in 2015*

Scotland - 97% from wind et al

Nicaragua - Up to 57% this year, and it started investing <10 years ago.

Uruguay - 97%, also in less than 10 years.

Kenya - 51% renewable, mostly geothermal.

"I like the see you run a steel mill or a aluminum smelter from solar panels and batteries. 

You still need baseload generation by power sources that can be on all the time and throttled up as needed. Nuclear, Natural Gas, Hydro, and Geothermal are perfect for this. 

Solar, wind, other are good for reducing demand on the baseload generators. If it is a sunny or windy day, you can throttle back the natural gas plant. House batteries are good for storing your own solar power and providing when the grid can't. Grid batteries are for stabilizing demand on the grid.

i think the biggest failing of current politics on energy policy, is the polarization. It is either solar panels and batteries or oil and coal. "
All aboard the ultimate Reddit ‚Äòjerk: Bernie + Tesla
We need to stop making green tech political. Solar and wind are now cheaper than fossil fuels for a simple reason: the Sun and wind are free resources that last forever - coal and oil are not.

"The Australian Govt knows very well we could transition to renewables today if they wanted to as we have more sun than needed and the price of solar panels and batteries will be at parity of our electricity prices in the next few years. 

The problem is we are heavily entrenched in dirty coal production and the Greedy Govt and power companies love the tax revenue and profits they make from it and that is the only reason as they don't give a shit about the environment. 

Same reason we have very few hybrids and ev's and they are all import taxed into oblivion to protect our now none existent car manufacturing Industry."

"So question here:  I‚Äôve been told by folks in the energy industry that infrastructure upgrades aren‚Äôt able to keep up with the technology curve- even if the capital was available to spend. Is this an accurate statement?  Is it more applicable for other types of energy generation (i.e. solar, geothermal, etc.)?"
We all need to accept the future and move from fossil fuel BS. Even nuclear energy has promising outcomes it just gets a bad rep from WW2 and the Cold War
I wonder what Hillary would have said. 
"Waiting for the E Golf, would be nice if the Australian govt gave us a tax credit incentive to buy EV and hybrids like other countries. "
We are getting there but it's still hard to use renewable energy in the same sentence with battery.
We have to start somewhere and like any technology it will become affordable for the masses as new technology is released. You will always have rich early adopters and the middle and lower will follow. A rising tide lifts all boats (suppose to anyway).

"The real problem here is our antiquated grid. It simply wasn't designed with variable generation in mind. These countries with high percentages of renewables also have much more modern grids. Our grid in principle hasn't changed much since the 30's. Some computerization was added, but at it's core, it is the same."
"Germany most definitely did not magically get rid of their base load capacity and replace it with solar or wind. 

As it stands right now much as I love what Elon is doing the reality is that only nuclear is capable of replacing fossil fuels as a base load supply. Peaking loads can be handled by some renewables as their supply tends to be cointergrated with the demand. The biggest issue is that lithium batteries simply don‚Äôt have the required storage capacity and round trip efficiency to store the amounts of energy required by full size grids. Pumped storage is realistically your only option at the scale and cost required to bring solar to baseload levels.

What he is doing is great but the announcement that we can now just ignore base load and move to a land of unicorns and rainbows is a little premature"

"I don‚Äôt usually agree with Bernie but he is right. I don‚Äôt think its that hard to transition and it certainly is not an ‚Äúimpossibility‚Äù as I‚Äôve heard from others.  

But on the flip side we have ‚Äúgreen‚Äù minded individuals trying to shut down many solar plants and wind plants because they kill birds. https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/02/nevadas-massive-solar-plant-death-ray-birds/358244/

Thats one example, there was another one that was actually shut down from turtle deaths... 

Seems like you can‚Äôt win ever with many of these sustainability minded people because any impact=evil.

Personally i think more nuclear options should be explored and France should be used as a template because most of their electricity comes from plants rather than coal. Too many people however, are deathly afraid of nuclear. The new plants (i believe they are on gen 5 if i am not mistaken) have significantly less waste, radiation, and possibility of going critical but because the gen 1/2 plants like Chernobyl and Fukushima failed so abysmally no one seems to want to consider it. Heck the new plants have ways to reuse waste, but most don‚Äôt know that. "
Not the greatest endorsement really 
I feel sad when other countries are moving forward and have a green energy program for the future.
"Look at Germany. Tried to switch to 100% RE and they have rolling blackouts and there power grid is crap... And at times they have so much energy it ruins there electrical system from having too much power in the grid so they have to sell it to other country's. Yes I said sell they lose money on there""perfect power system"" . it will work in the future when the tech is better but not right now."
That's true but it's not feasible on the power scale we need. 
"The thing is, that on this planet we call home, every person should realise that when you drive a gas car you yourself are contributing to global warming.

The solution starts with you, not the politicians or big corporate industry but with you.  We are small but we have great responsibility and together we can stop it.  

I get that a lot of people can‚Äôt afford to buy a brand spanking new Tesla car but it is very worthwhile keeping that thought front of mind.  It‚Äôs not only big industry that is destroying this beautiful planet but also us, the individuals.

"You can have ours if you want, hydrogen cracked vessels and all. I'll pay you 50 bucks to take it off our hands. Promise.

Nuclear energy is heavily subsidized. No insurance company wants to touch them either so the entire nation where it's built gets that bill handed to it when push comes to shove.

Solar and wind are far cheaper and quicker to build than any nuclear power plant at the moment.

It's dead, Jim."
Ironic because Bernie is one of the most anti-Nuclear energy politicians in Congress.
"That sound good and honestly have nothing against it, but we must have proper disposal sites"
"Shhhh, no one needs base supply."
"renewables are cheaper.  To the point that you have to mine an order of magnitude more ore to get enough uranium to produce as much energy as a silicon solar cell- and that is without even considering recycling the solar cells.  Even factoring the cost of batteries in, nuclear just can't compete.  Math:

I'm gonna do the math for one square meter of solar paneling.  That's [186 W of solar cells](http://sinovoltaics.com/learning-center/quality/standard-test-conditions-stc-definition-and-problems/), about [$192 installed](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68925.pdf), including land cost, taxes, etc etc etc.  A residential system will cost about 3x as much.  Over most of the US, that panel will generate an average of 1 kWh per day (5.5 kWh insolation times 18.6% efficiency).  To a rough approximation you'll need to store about 30% of that power overnight- 300 Wh.  Lets call that $120/kWh for the batteries- that's a reasonable large-scale current cost.  Say it lasts 5000 cycles, same as the Tesla powerwall- 13.7 years.  In reality that could last way, way longer at a slightly higher capacity, but say you just replace it until the panels run out.  That's $192 for the panels and $108 for the batteries, warrantied for at least 41 years.  

That gives you a cost of 2.0 cents per kWh.  Compare to nuclear, where still-unfinished plants are supposed to come in at [9.6 cents per kWh](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf).  On top of that nuclear only gets more expensive as you build additional plants- you need sites with large water supplies and isolation (because of the security required) but not remote (because of the machinery), and uranium gets harder to mine the more you want of it.  Solar panels, on the other hand, are made of literally the most available solid resource on earth- sand and rocks.  They just get cheaper and cheaper as you make more of them.

">Does anyone else hate how no one mentions nuclear energy when the topic of clean energy comes up?


One of the many reasons I wasn't a big Bernie fan.

Not to mention, the anti nuclear crowd tends to overlap with the anti vaxxer crowd...

"I suppose it depends on your definition of clean. Nuclear does have the pesky problem of producing radioactive waste, which even when processed for further enrichment and using byproducts as secondary fuel sources, will outlast us by a long measure.

Then there's the chemical enrichment process, which is extremely toxic. While most of the tailings of the process are contained, or recycled for future use, it still poses a risk or contamination.

There are no silver bullets."
Nuclear is left behind more for economic reasons than enviromental. Nuclear plants are simply so expensive that its not worth to build them and they have to be subsidied just like renewables. 
"Time-to-value for a nuclear plant investment just doesn‚Äôt make sense now. Cost for Kw/h for wind/solar/tidal is so low. Why would you make a huge capital investment for something that is carbon neutral, requires fuel, regulatory oversight, and doesn‚Äôt have the renewables ‚Äúbrand‚Äù. 

Just doesn‚Äôt make sense financially or technically. 

Edit: spelling"
"Show a really safe system (impossible to meltdown no matter what happens), an affordable system (that includes the costs not only for building but also decommission) and a system that has a working, safe, long term (talking thousands of years here) solution for the radioactive waste. If you have that in one package, we can talk about nuclear energy again."

"Bernie never held a steady job until he was 40, after having lost five statewide races before winning the Burlington mayoral race in 1981 by 10 votes against a Democrat who didn't bother to campaign, he spent another 30 years in Congress with no accomplishments, his policies have been thoroughly debunked as economic nonsense, he headed the VA committee during the scandal, his wife is shady as shit who bankrupted a college and then got a $200,000 golden parachute, he would've raised taxes on everyone and he has some really odd financials (he also didn't release his tax returns during the campaign).

He adores the failed socialist government of Venezuela, praised Fidel Castro, said Soviet breadlines were a good thing, participated in anti-American Marxist Sandinista rallies in Nicaragua where where half a million people chanted, ‚ÄúHere, there, everywhere/the Yankee will die,‚Äô‚Äô he has a piss poor temperament when being asked to explain himself, he endorsed a communist for president of the United States during the Cold War in order to protect the Cuban revolution, he has 0 political allies in the Senate (not even Leahy), he got about 1,000 pages of FEC violations this election, he was really deceptive about endorsements, his own campaign thought he was out of line about Nevada, and it leaked that he continued the primary even though he knew it was getting him nothing and just helping Trump; he wanted to use his political capitol to hurt other progressives.
He voted to send toxic waste to minority communities, voted for the failure that was the $1.5 trillion dollar F-35 fighter jet program, voted for the same crime bill that he attacked Hillary Clinton for, voted against Amber Alert, voted against an anti-child pornography bill, he's had some strong anti-science positions (1, 2, 3, 4), he flirted with nativist crowds and helped kill immigration reform, and no one knows what his 2nd amendment policy is.

He spent $700k of campaign contributions to rent a private jet to fly 10 family members to the Vatican for no apparent reason, he wrote rape fantasy fan fiction and other creepy shit regarding naked children, he was kicked out of a hippie commune for not working (how?), he demanded $15/hr minimum wage while paying his interns $12/hr, he can't actually explain policy specifics like in that disastrous NYDN interview, he's voted for war more often than he hasn't, he was dead wrong about TARP, wrong on free trade, he doesn't understand how the Fed works, and he constantly rails against millionaires and billionaires despite being a wealthy U.S Senator who owns three lake houses.

Oh and his single payer pipe dream that he keeps proposing, and lying about, despite GOP efforts to repeal the ACA? That would have easily been used against him by Republicans as a socialist government run healthcare system that will raise everyone's taxes and use tax payer money to pay for abortions which would immediately kill support for it from over half the country and the pro-life crowd. The GOP would have cited the fact that Bernie's home state of Vermont tried single payer and it failed because it cost too much so how is it going to work for the entire country? Even liberal economists were hugely skeptical of whether we could afford his plan. 

Single payer might sound great in a stump speech or some meaningless poll with no details of the plan, but when it was actually on the ballot in Colorado in the last election it got rejected by almost 80% of voters.

Bernie would have lost the popular vote and every swing state in the country. It would have been a McGovern style landslide loss had he became the Democratic nominee. His wife, Jane, is now under FBI investigation."

"Would highly disagree, but thankfully we didn't have to find out. No, I didn't vote for Trump either, so let's try and minimize the downvotes lol. "
"> Imagine a much younger Bernie

I like Tulsi Gabbard, but in my opinion, the thing that makes Bernie so amazing is that he's spent the last 30 years demonstrating that he stands by what he believes, he doesn't sell out, and he works tirelessly to help people (not himself or special interests).

There are many Berniecrats that appear to be on this trajectory, but few (if any) have a track record that unequivocally proves honesty, integrity, and consistency. That's why Bernie is so special, and why there is so much passion (not just money) behind the  movement he started.

I hope she and the others follow his example and live up to his legacy. It's a very tall order."

Yes the power packs could store power from anything but solar and wind have periods where they produce fluctuating levels of energy. The thing about coal and oil is they generally are an all or nothing they either try to run the power plant at 100% or shut them down. The thing with solar and wind because you have the fluctuation it's better to store the energy when it you are producing a lot and there is low need so you can release it when there is high need and low production capacity
Petroleum and coal are their own form of energy storage. Burn them to make energy to charge batteries for later use ... or just wait until later to burn them for their energy.
"Yes. It makes them more efficient and less polluting by stabilizing ramp ups and whatnot. They can run consistently to service demand while storing the excess. 

However it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they are a temporary business case. Renewables are cheaper than those sources in most markets, and getting cheaper every day. Sometimes cheaper than the operating cost. 

It‚Äôs ultimately a good thing for battery technology as the use cases and monetization possibilities are very wide. Cheaper batteries means wider clean energy adoption, reducing cost for both batteries and clean energy in a positive feedback due to synergy. "
"Yes, but battery technology is necessary for renewable energy sources."
"Careful now, that burn could torch his third lakehouse."

">She stole it from her own party.

Party wouldn't have existed without her fundraising. "
Don't forget the part where Bernie rolled over and took a buyout instead of raising hell.  
"Bernie never held a steady job until he was 40, after having lost five statewide races before winning the Burlington mayoral race in 1981 by 10 votes against a Democrat who didn't bother to campaign, he spent another 30 years in Congress with no accomplishments, his policies have been thoroughly debunked as economic nonsense, he headed the VA committee during the scandal, his wife is shady as shit who bankrupted a college and then got a $200,000 golden parachute, he would've raised taxes on everyone and he has some really odd financials (he also didn't release his tax returns during the campaign).

He adores the failed socialist government of Venezuela, praised Fidel Castro, said Soviet breadlines were a good thing, participated in anti-American Marxist Sandinista rallies in Nicaragua where where half a million people chanted, ‚ÄúHere, there, everywhere/the Yankee will die,‚Äô‚Äô he has a piss poor temperament when being asked to explain himself, he endorsed a communist for president of the United States during the Cold War in order to protect the Cuban revolution, he has 0 political allies in the Senate (not even Leahy), he got about 1,000 pages of FEC violations this election, he was really deceptive about endorsements, his own campaign thought he was out of line about Nevada, and it leaked that he continued the primary even though he knew it was getting him nothing and just helping Trump; he wanted to use his political capitol to hurt other progressives.
He voted to send toxic waste to minority communities, voted for the failure that was the $1.5 trillion dollar F-35 fighter jet program, voted for the same crime bill that he attacked Hillary Clinton for, voted against Amber Alert, voted against an anti-child pornography bill, he's had some strong anti-science positions (1, 2, 3, 4), he flirted with nativist crowds and helped kill immigration reform, and no one knows what his 2nd amendment policy is.

He spent $700k of campaign contributions to rent a private jet to fly 10 family members to the Vatican for no apparent reason, he wrote rape fantasy fan fiction and other creepy shit regarding naked children, he was kicked out of a hippie commune for not working (how?), he demanded $15/hr minimum wage while paying his interns $12/hr, he can't actually explain policy specifics like in that disastrous NYDN interview, he's voted for war more often than he hasn't, he was dead wrong about TARP, wrong on free trade, he doesn't understand how the Fed works, and he constantly rails against millionaires and billionaires despite being a wealthy U.S Senator who owns three lake houses.

Oh and his single payer pipe dream that he keeps proposing, and lying about, despite GOP efforts to repeal the ACA? That would have easily been used against him by Republicans as a socialist government run healthcare system that will raise everyone's taxes and use tax payer money to pay for abortions which would immediately kill support for it from over half the country and the pro-life crowd. The GOP would have cited the fact that Bernie's home state of Vermont tried single payer and it failed because it cost too much so how is it going to work for the entire country? Even liberal economists were hugely skeptical of whether we could afford his plan. 

Single payer might sound great in a stump speech or some meaningless poll with no details of the plan, but when it was actually on the ballot in Colorado in the last election it got rejected by almost 80% of voters.

Bernie would have lost the popular vote and every swing state in the country. It would have been a McGovern style landslide loss had he became the Democratic nominee. His wife, Jane, is now under FBI investigation."
"She didn't steal shit. The fact that you think she did shows you've bought Russian fake news hook line and sinker. This is depressing as hell. 

edit: this is coming from someone who voted for Bernie in the primary. "
"No he wouldn't have beaten trump he would have lost worse that's a lie. Hillary also didn't steal the election because your implying an illegal act. The DNC can choose whatever candidate they please it's a private company. They could have said fuck it and chosen bob who lives on the corner to be their candidate. Also, she didn't really steal it, she still would have won even without super delegates. Sorry folks Bernie is just to extremist for America "

"Being a base load power source is a limitation, not something to strive for. If too much power is generated, things explode, so all the power sources that cannot be shut off or throttled down quickly can't exceed the lowest amount of power that will be needed at a given time in case there is a random dip in demand that needs to be handled.

Base load is the minimum power that will be required, and can be met by anything that can handle peak load.

Wind turbines have brakes that can stop power generation, hydroelectric damns can shut off valves at a moments notice. If you have enough renewable sources to handle the peak, they can be shut off to handle the trough."

Why not nuclear?  It gets such a bad rap as being unsafe yet the public seems to be okay with the thousands of nuclear reactors the United States Navy has.  Good thing too because I can‚Äôt even imagine how much CO2 an aircraft carrier would emit if it ran in diesel fuel.
">I like the see you run a steel mill or a aluminum smelter from solar panels and batteries. 

Ok. I'm not sure why you're writing this as if you're incredulous that it can happen. All that needs to be done is to build more wind turbines and install more panels and connect them to a grid. They can be quickly brought online or offline as needed and excess can be stored. "
"Polarized debates where most people have no idea of the scale involved in electricity generation.  Renewable energy is moving forward, no stopping it.  But it is happening over a generation or two, not next year.  Just too big to see it happening in your own back yard."
"Base load power sources are literally the opposite of things that can be throttled as needed.

Wind turbines are also very good at throttling, they have brakes that can reduce the power coming in from the wind farm, so as long as you have enough wind turbines to meet peak demand, you can throttle down to base load as needed. Solar panels can also be disconnected from the grid and will stop producing electricity, so the same thing applies."
"Definitely. I learned the other day that cyclotron operators have to contact grid operators whenever the cyclotron is running tests / creating isotopes for hospitals. They pull a tremendous amount of current for their magnetic field and require massive capacitor banks to accommodate the large shift in reactive power. Grid operators also have to accommodate for this shift to maintain grid stability. 


I get somewhat irked whenever topics on renewable energy seem to imply that the solution  is simple. There are complex engineering hurdles that must be solved before the solution can be simplified to a grid that runs exclusively on solar, wind, hydro etc. Reliability and stability are the biggest ones for me. "

Since when is Bernie not in favor of capitalism for the means of production? I think he's just a socialist for matters of human health and regulation.
Hey that‚Äôs not necessary. What do you think about Verizon and Comcast trying to repeal net neutrality so they can put tolls on the internet? Is that also capitalism? You‚Äôre just parroting without knowing the definition.
"You hit the nail on the head. We all want to move to renewable and clean energy. Literally everyone wants that. It just isn't economically viable yet. When the technology catches up and becomes cheap enough, we will switch to it. But not before then.

It‚Äôs easy to spout off about anything. That‚Äôs how he ran his entire campaign. 
"The problem with nuclear is that it is monumentally more expensive at every step, and in the eyes of non proliferation, you cannot reuse the waste. It's tech that should be saved for when it's the only option, not just use it for everything. Solar, wind, tidal and other forms of generation are safer, cleaner and way cheaper."

It would take relatively little investment (compared to what we spend on fossil fuels) to get scale renewables to the point and far past the point where they would be cheaper than fossil fuels. Solar is already cheaper than coal on large scale. Look how many coal power plants India and China have canceled simply because solar is cheaper. 
This is silly rhetoric masquerading as real policy. In all advanced societies the government has long supported and regulated the energy markets.
"America doesn't need Communism or Socialism, nor do many of us want them."
Solar panels don‚Äôt require very much CO2 pollution to generate electricity. Coal and natural gas does. That‚Äôs green in my book. 
"I don't think it's even the brainwashing from fossil fuels though, it's brainwashing in general.  It's the fact that green energy is considered a liberal ideal, and if liberals support it conservatives must be against it.  Even though in actuality it would benefit the conservative cause to be energy independent.  It's similar to how Obamacare would actually help many rural areas, but they won't support it bc Obama is an evil commie."
It's also easier and cheaper for undeveloped countries to adopt green technologies since their infrastructure is lacking. 
But clean coal.. why not spend millions to develop technology with an inferior fuel source for literally no logical reason at all?
">We need the entire globe to participate


This is easier said than done. Actually, it's probably impossible. "
None of this technology depends upon government subsidy. America leads the world in development of these technologies because we have a market economy which supports the innovations required. Fewer regulations in the space will spur further acceleration in the development of renewables. 
"I really wish this wasn't true but everytime I even touch on dem leaning talking points my super conservative parents go straight to the ""why do I need to pay for someone else's shirt?!?!""

We're currently living in that weird middle transition part which is sometimes hard to see while it is still unfolding."
"> If renewables were truly a more affordable and realistic solution than what we currently have, we would be running entirely on renewables already.

If pricing for regular power generation would be true and include and account for the negative externalities that it causes, meaning climate change, more immediate destruction of natural resources, as well as health care costs due to particulate pollution, then fossil fuels would be largely out of business 50 years ago.  

The free market is great if it is set up correctly. That is exactly why most economists prefer the simplest solution to the climate change problem, and that's the carbon tax. As it stands, fossil fuels receive direct and indirect subsidies to the tune of trillions of dollars."
That's definitely why I added the note in paranthesis. You guys use a weirdly disproportional amount of fossil fuels.

"You gotta consider the reasons it's been stagnating (a lack of subsidies that are enjoyed by other low-carbon energy options, for one, and lack of a carbon tax), and also specify what you mean when you say it's ""not clean"".

It's not a very polluting industry. Warm water discharge can be mitigated with cooling ponds/towers. High-level radioactive waste is produced at extremely low rates. Fukushima-type disasters are exceedingly rare, don't come close to approaching the damage caused by fossil fuels, and are easily avoided by not being completely idiotic in the way you design, operate, and regulate power plants."

This nonsense that we need to invest in nuclear when renewables and battery tech are making huge strides, while solar and battery costs are plummeting just baffles me."

">Nuclear energy isn't really clean though. It is largely carbon-neutral, but it's not clean.

When people say clean they mean carbon neutral.

Nuclear power is safer than wind power ... just think about that

"With enough powerpacks and a smart energy grid, no one does."
">  That's 1 kW of solar cells, about $1,030 installed, including land cost, taxes, etc etc etc. A residential system will cost about 3x as much. Over most of the US, that panel will generate an average of 1 kWh per day (5.5 kWh insolation times 18.6% efficiency).

If I'm properly informed, the ""1 KW of solar cells"" already factors in efficiency. In other words, 1kw of solar cells will produce 5.5 kwh of energy a day on average.

What's not correct is the one meter. Incident radiation is about 1kw per one sqaure meter. So at 18% efficiency, you'd need about 5m^2 for that setup. It should still output what the panels are rated at during peak sun hours, though.

So, in other words, I think the payoff is even sooner than you've calculated.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but this is how I have understood solar systems."
"Actually, nuclear energy ranks last in death per energy unit. Wind and solar aren‚Äôt available everywhere while nuclear only needs a source of water. Wind is extremely inefficient (it also kills lots of birds). Also when discussing wind, many people fail to remember all the CO2 emissions that go into producing, transporting, and assembling wind turbines. Nuclear isn‚Äôt the absolute greatest energy source, but it is a great place holder until nuclear fusion becomes more realistic, and wind becomes cheaper, and more efficient."
"> There are better options than nuclear.

There are also worse options than nuclear, still finding large-scale use. That's the crux of the criticism of anti-nuclear movements."

His ideas are good and he is truly a uniter who would work for all of us  and for a better country. He‚Äôs also genuine and doesn‚Äôt fall for political gimmicks easily.

Next public education will never be ""free,"" so the goal of ""universal"" public education is a lie. The buildings, land, administration, books, faculty must all be paid. Or are you suggesting they work for nothing, or at a state-fixed rate, so you can have ""free"" education?  No. 

How long has Bernie Sanders been in the Senate. And of those 3 bills he sponsored, they were all for the naming of post offices.

"Power plants may want to run at 100%... But 100% of what? If they only want to run at 100% but only 30% of it is needed by the grid, that's actually a use case for battery storage.

Run the plant at 100% until batteries are 90% full, then shut power plant off. Let batteries drain to 20% then kick plant on. Repeat. 

The total time the power plant is burning fuel in any capacity could be reduced significantly."

"1300watts per meter squared.

Current mass produced Solar panels can do about 30 percent efficiency. Giving you 300 watts per square meter. 

All under optimal conditions. Weather, seasons, and solar activity change all thisnof course. Solar panels also gets less efficient the hotter they are. They also degrade and put out less energy over time. Becoming useless after 30 years."
Because just about every nuclear plant currently being built in the western world is a expensive boondoggle running years behind schedule and billions and billions over budget. There is little reason to lock a population into expensive nuclear for the next 60 years when wind solar and storage are seeing revolutionary cost progressive over last 5 years.
"I'm all for nuclear. 

I think we should replace all the coal power plants with nuclear. Then start shutting down, but keeping, natural gas plants as more nuclear is added. Keeping the natural gas plants for high demand or when the weather isn't cooperating. 

There is a lot of ignorance based fear about nuclear power, and a lot of coal based lobbying against nuclear. People are scared of radiation, but coal emits more radiation than nuclear. Coal kills, maims, and sickens more people in a year. Than nuclear ever has. Nuclear waste can be recycled into more fuel or other useful isotopes. Thorium and molten salt reactors are safer and produce less high grade waste that uranium light water reactors. 

Fusion is basically never going to happen at current funding levels. ITER is still decades away from completion and will probably never be a viable commercial power plant.While France and Germany work on tohkamaks and stellerators. the US' fusion research is still laser ignition. which is great for plasma research but useless as a power plant. fusion plasma science is a matured science. we don't really need to know anymore about fusion plasma. we need to figure out how to make a power plant. which means feeding more hydrogen in once the plant is up to temperature. extracting the helium and other fusion products. repairing and maintaining the hardware of the fusion plant."

Liberal propaganda to persuade people to support governmental intervention.

Irony. We wouldn't have become a communist or socialist country. Your reply just proved my point.
That post yesterday about Cobalt and child slaves or whatever or the lithium mine picture that is actually a tar sands mine OR the false fact about electric cars being more polluting than a Hummer H1 because batteries in the 90s were lead acid. And then you have the fear mongering about black outs because of everyone charging their electric cars. How deep does the rabbit hole go?
"I am a conservative. From just an engineering stand point solar, wind, and battery make too much since not to do. 2.86 lbs of CO2 is pumped into the air for every pound of coal burned.

"Another Dane. It is because of the high share of windmills. Our energy production fluctuates like crazy because the wind is very volatile compared to solar.

So we need to keep all our old shitty power plants online in case there is no wind. And you can‚Äôt really switch them on and off with short notice (gas turbines, yes. But not our old chimney plants).

We could probably balance it out with more EVs and more solar. But the windmill industry hates solar and almost everyone hates EVs.

"That wasn't nuclear's fault. It was the fault of dumbass site design. Backup generators below sea level? Really guys? can't just put that on a fucking platform? 

I'll gladly take 1 fukushima per year to eliminate all coal energy. the environment would thrive."
"If we were building newer, more modern designs, we could have decommissioned Fukushima a long time ago. And the newer designs would not have been vulnerable to that disaster. 

Fukushima was long outdated and had been scheduled to be decommissioned years before the disaster. However its lease was prolonged because there were no new plants to replace it. "
Earthquakes and tsunamis aren't a concern for all countries.
There was a lot of time between the 70s and Fukushima when we could (and should) have been building more nuclear plants. 
">High-level radioactive waste is produced at extremely low rates

I remember 10 years ago when McCain was calling for more nuclear power and people gave this same excuse.
What‚Äôs your point? There‚Äôs no humanity left in 40 years so we shouldn‚Äôt bother?
Including Fukushima?
"No, but they don't heat massive amounts of water, and leave behind radioactive material either. Nuclear is better than fossil fuels, but not as good as solar or wind, and has extra problems solar and wind don't."
"No, clean means it causes no pollution. Some people use it to mean carbon neutral, but that is not the standard definition by any means."

"I am very serious. Hillary has been world famous since Bill was president. She was a senator from New York during 9/11. No one who votes in US elections did not know who she was.

Sanders was on the news frequently from January 2016 onwards, but there is a *massive* difference between ""I've known about this politician for 20 years"" and ""This guy has been on the news a lot lately,"" especially for people who vote but don't pay much attention to politics. You'll also note that for the first several months of 2016 Sanders' numbers were steadily going up. So either people who knew about both of them all along changed their minds in significant numbers, or yes indeed, his name recognition increased.

Obviously he was all over reddit since 2015 because we skew young and he had something like 85% support from 18-30 year olds, but that's hardly representative of the entire US."

Lots of people are saying Biden should run. Sanders is only one year older than him, and he appears to be in great health. He can still run when he's in a hurry, which is way more than most his age can. If he feels he can run in 2020, he'll have a lot of support. Yeah, it would have been great if we could have had him as a candidate 10 or 15 years ago, but that wasn't possible in the political climate then. Now that it is, he's the best we've got, and he's excellent."

"Even if you store the power it's not cost effective the coal generators are all or nothing. They tend to design them with very limited expandable capacity. Normally this is done by having several small generators in series. Each generator can be switched on and off as needed but each generator is design to work at peak efficiency. Turning onto change batteries would only be cost effective if they know the batteries will be used in a short amount of time. This is why solar and wind using batteries is good cause there may be low or slow periods  but the more productive times can be minutes or hours away. It is much more cost effective to keep coal and oil in there solid form to be used on demand then in a battery form. It would be a waste of these resources to use them as battery chargers. Batteries help to mitigate the problems with solar and wind where as the problems with coal and oil (mostly pollution) are exacerbated by using them to charge batteries, when they are more cost effective and there problems are mitigated to be use on demand."

Side note. Lead acid batteries are nearly 100% recyclable. As long as they are recycled properly I believe the general consensus is that they are quite acceptable which is why no one is pushing to ban them.
"IANAE but we actually learn this is introductory macroeconomics. It's the concept of ""leader"" nations and ""follower"" nations. There's an interesting phenomenon where growing, developing nations can have periods of faster GDP growth (6-8%) than more developed ones (2-3%). The reason? Like you said, quite simply it's easier, faster, and cheaper to adopt established technologies like wireless than to perform the R&D and kink-ironing necessary to make fusion viable. Like I said, I'm definitely no economist, but fun fact nonetheless"
This. Exactly. Just had this conversation on the future of electric power in Africa. 
Didn't China also do this? Not as much as some African nations but there was a bit of a leapfrog moment there.

Are you implying that the US electrical infrastructure is lacking because the standard voltage is 110 (actually 120)?  Or are you saying something else?"
"The thing with the growing countries is that they will move with the latest tech when they develop.

The issue we have with our richer developed countries is the fact we already have an ingrained technology already doing the same job, so people struggle to justify why we need to move to renewables, also add on the the FUD articles about renewables being years behind and people don't trust it.

 It becomes a case of, we've got perfectly good energy generation now, why should we spend all this straight away to switch.

Whereas a developing country isn't going to 'switch' they will just go with the newer and cleaner tech. "
"Yes, but it's harder when you're pushing up against the limits of what is known to be possible. Developments happen, but take more time "
">  but a richer country has more resources and money, so they can develop and adapt new technologies more easily.

But developed countries also have incumbents who resist switching to the new technology, and the sunk costs of that old investment which people are reluctant to devalue.    The money to switch *is* present, but so is the disincentive to switch."

"Sanders understands the nitty gritty of politics. He‚Äôs worked as a politician for like 35 years, been in both houses of Congress, and has been an executive as a mayor. His ideas are very popular and the main thing stopping them from becoming reality is lobbying. He obviously would not achieve everything he wants to as president, no one does, but he‚Äôd get some of it done and we‚Äôd be better off. 

Clinton, by contrast, had no core values she was running on. She was vague on policy and obviously didn‚Äôt inspire her base. Her main message was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than Trump.‚Äù Which is true but didn‚Äôt excite people on the left. We knew she wouldn‚Äôt even try to accomplish the big goals that would fix this country.

Coal, the favorite of our piece of shit President, kills **10,000** per year. Nuclear power is 19% of the electricity the US uses per year, coal 32%. So far 13% more energy production you get 10,000 times the number of deaths. Explain to me how this should be a deterrent where we ignore the superiority of nuclear energy production again. 

Edit to add these numbers:

Coal kills an average of 100,000 people *per year*. Nuclear has killed 90 *including* the Chernobyl disaster and Fukushima. Of course you have to account for the fallout, literal and figurative of the meaning of that term, but combined there‚Äôs still less direct threats. And Chernobyl was a horrible design even the Soviets stopped using. Modern designs would never have that problem and if we‚Äôd all quit spreading bullshit and had meaningful, open conversation on how to properly harness that form of energy production instead of telling scary stories we might be much, much better off. Battery production is also extremely environmentally destructive, but we can improve that too.

>	SANDERS: What candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry, and **transform our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies**, you know what happens to that Republican who listens to the scientists? That Republican loses his campaign funding from the Koch brothers. I‚Äôm the only candidate who says no president can do it all. **We need a political revolution**. When millions of people tell the fossil fuel industry that their short-term profits are less significant than the long-term health of this planet, we will win.

>	SANDERS: Yes. Secretary Clinton has the support of all the Democratic governors. **I am not part of that establishment.** I am a member of the Environmental Committee. And I talk to scientists who tell me that fracking is doing terrible things to water systems. **We have gotta be bold now. We gotta transform our energy system to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We‚Äôve gotta do it yesterday.**

Sanders wants to immediately, overnight, transform the entire American energy sector, and he wants to accomplish this through applying federal political power. There's only one way that outcome is possible using that set of tools: seize and nationalize the energy companies. 

Sanders calls himself a Socialist for a reason: he is one. [And the Democratic Party knows it full well](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-2016-socialism-213667). 

>	Sanders‚Äô portrayal of democratic socialism as nothing but the New Deal is a disingenuous sleight of hand that plays on foggy historical memories. And his comparison to Nordic social democracy is equally misleading: Much of Sanders‚Äôs platform ignores the economic realities that European socialists long ago accepted.

>Many people may be inclined to interpret Sanders‚Äô calls for a revolution as just a rhetorical flourish. I think we should take it seriously.

">And I haven‚Äôt called anyone a troll or shill or bot. 

Ummmmmmmmmmm....

This was you 7 hours ago:

>>The Democratic establishment is going to fight him tooth and nail, which is why we already see so many bots and shills disparaging Bernie.

You're pretty directly implying here that anyone going against the idea of a Bernie candidacy, or disparaging him at all on Reddit in the last few months... Must be a shill or a bot.

I'm really curious why you denied that when you literally typed it out a few hours ago.

Perhaps you truly believe that wasn't insulting. Perhaps you truly believe that unless you say ""you are a shill"" to someone directly, you're not doing anything wrong. Perhaps you just forgot. I don't know... But the fact is yes, you blanket accused everyone who has gone against Bernie of being a bot or shill.

And for the record there are not and never were anti Bernie bots or shills. The Russians bots were anti Hillary, and they even sometimes pretended to be Bernie supporters to stoke hate against her. As for the shills... They simply never existed. Hillary's campaign did invest money in correcting misinformation about her online, but none of it involved secret paid shills who hid among the rest of us and pretended to be normal. 

I like your username, big Bojack fan here, but saying all of us who don't like Bernie or don't think he should run are bots or shills? That's too much man...

"I will admit I think Sanders is a good person. I think he generally cares about people's well being. The problem is his solutions are awful. And Actually Sanders is very very ignorant about policies considering how terrible they are. None of his suggestions would fix anything, in fact they would make it worse "
">He‚Äôs knowledgeable about policy. You can disagree with him, but you can‚Äôt say he hasn‚Äôt done his homework on the facts. 

What?? One of the main criticisms of Bernie was his lack of policy knowledge... And that lack of policy knowledge was clear in his interviews with the press and in the debates. He can name his own policy proposals ad nauseum, but when asked to explain how they actually work he'd either say ""were gonna tax the millionaires"" which isn't a real answer, or he'd just pivot to another thing on his wish list.

Sure compared to trump, he's a policy expert... But compared to Hillary he's just not on the same level.




>but I think the vast majority are just rational people who want to stand together and support a growing middle class. 


EVERYONE who is liberal wants this, not just Bernie supporters. Even many Republicans want that... I'm sorry but Bernie and his supporters don't have a monopoly on the idea that growing the middle class is good. In fact every politician for the last 50 years, left right and center, has pledged to stand together and support a growing middle class...

THIS is what bugs people about Bernie supporters, this entitled attitude like they're the first people to realize universal healthcare and free college are good ideas. "
"I think he will definitely run. Even if he doesn't think he can win, he will probably run for a bit to test the waters and to pull the conversation to the left. Remember all those times Hillary veered to the right during the primary and then had to backpedal because it turned out the progressive position had more public support? Come 2020, even if he doesn't think he can win he'll want to be able to hold the other candidates' feet to the fire.

And of course, it may turn out that he can actually pull it off. Which would be amazing."
Sanders is 76 years old. Joe Biden is 75.
Thing is most states voted well before the DNC. It is a pretty incredible thing for him to have come that close despite almost 0% name recognition at the start of the campaign.

"I mean, I don't want Biden. I'm saying a lot of the people who complain about Sanders' age think Biden is a reasonable candidate, so I'm not particularly worried about Bernie's age. It'll be a talking point he can easily dispel by challenging Trump to a jog."

"> Didn't work for Obama;

Obama never leaned on it. Instead, his focus was on leading from behind, operating under the assumption that elected representatives already *represent* the people, without someone lighting a fire under their ass. Not the case. That's why he always just nicely *asked* Congress to do their job, which is doomed to fail.   
Obama also had as one of his ideals and as part of the ""Change"" that he ran on to do away with partisan politics. And that's exactly why he rarely spoke up. Not a strong leader, not someone who openly fought tooth and nail for his convictions, if he ever had any that differ from sucking up to Wallstreet, to begin with.

> it would have definitely not worked for a self described socialist, that's an instant reason to oppose someone for far too much of the country because of McCarthy.

Sanders is the main reason why popular support for Medicare for all and other such policies is on the rise and why these issues are on the table. If you don't speak out, advocate for causes, fight, put pressure on political opponents who stand behind unpopular policies, then you lose by default as the Overton window slips away right under you.  
Sanders is doing that, and that's why he's the most popular politician in the country while the approval rating of Congress is in the teens to twenties."
"It was a huge advantage in this case.  If Hillary had a penis, she wouldn't have even been able to cheat.  On paper all her stances were utter garbage compared to sanders.

Socialism only loses if you cherry pick your examples. The things that are socialized in the US also work pretty well. There is a healthy market for package delivery even in competition with the USPS, our roads are very nice, and while our military is sent to places we shouldn't get involved, they do a very good job of fighting."
"At that point it would be cheaper to do it with solar and wind as already the price per kilowatt hour is cheaper than coal. The economies of scale currently work on the favor of solar and wind. Things like coal are good because the physical source can just be stored. They can be used if needed. Burning coal to power batteries adds a step where power can be lost and increases coal's problems, pollution. Solar and wind issue has always been fixing the power fluctuation which seems to be fixed by batteries."

"I can't really use my cell service at home. Technically I get service but it's 1 bar and mostly doesn't work well.

I also have a choice of the local DSL company, but it offers about 1/4 the speeds of coax cable connections. Having another coax cable provider or a direct fiber provider would be nice, but I don't have that option here. 

I don't have another coax cable company to choose from and almost nobody does. In reality most people interface with them more like a utility than a service that has free market competition.

There are a lot of services that I have a lot of choice from. There are four major cell networks that overlap in coverage and provide roughly the same services. There are many banks in my town that I can choose to do business with, and multiple grocery stores. Services that are provided remotely / over the internet have a great deal of competition and choice. Cable companies however almost never overlap in territory, almost everyone in the country has at most one DSL and one Cable provider to choose from, and DSL is generally limited to significantly lower speeds. That's not a freely competitive market."
Soooooo you're saying that you have no education or practical knowledge regarding economics. Check.
"If the established company is already charging extra frees for various services then what would stop the satellite company from using the same established business model?

Sure if I were running that satellite ISP I would lower prices below the competition and offer better services. However that is just me. This is not the Golden rule in capitalism and in many industries where there is competition many of the major players have very similar service and pay structures. I keep seeing this free market argument but it ignores the fact that the market is only restricting what these ISP's can do to screw the end user over. There is still a free market and more so with NN as long as the little new guy starting a business is not throttled back out of existence."
good thing they weren't making enough profit to be taxed higher anyways. 
"Do you know what ""market failure"" is? Let's start from a bit further out. 

Microecon theory says that perfectly competitive markets (one of the models of real markets) are the most efficient, in that they extract the most consumer and producer surplus (ie ""extra value"") from the market, out of all possible structures. Many markets are well-modeled by this; they're called ""competitive markets"". However, there are some assumptions (low barriers of entry, homogenous products, etc) that are commonly broken, which result in different market structures and, potentially, ""market failure"" situations.

Monopolies are a type of market failure, where a single company forms the price out of profit-maximization that does not lead to maximum total surplus, thus being inefficient. There are many causes of monopolies (natural, coordination, etc), but the ways to deal with them are literally regulation (anti-trust laws, taxating/subsidizing to achieve ""competitive"" price levels) which IMPROVE efficiency. 

Other types of market failure are: negative (eg pollution) and positive (eg research) externalities, which should also be regulated to increase efficiency (and equality, depending on your goals); public goods (roads, infrastructure, government) which literally nobody has a direct incentive to do -  also regulated to improve society as a whole.

Does that explain a bit about why regulation exists? :) "

"Cool I am too, but until fossil fuel subsidize go away let's not talk about renewable subsides going away that's just ridiculous, especially because renewables will actually make my kids future better. $1 in renewables goes a long way(case in point solar is now cheaper than coal on large scale) $1 to fossil fuel doesn't get you much. Trump doesn't want to drain the swamp, Scott Pruitt is head of EPA who was an oil lobbiest who sued the EPA a ridiculous number of times, Pai Ajit is head of FCC who wants to kill net neutrality, Trumps pick for USDAs top scientist isn't a scientist, and how may scientist have been dismissed from various organizations? The whole idea that Trump will do anything to ""drain the swamp"" is long gone, he is a part of the swamp now. "
I am not an expert
I think a bit of that is happening now since their pushing for solar energy recently. 
"Coal power (baseload) stations were shut down before any reliable renewable alternatives were there... this lead to a statewide blackout during a storm and hence this battery was built, though it can only supply the states needs for approx. 3 minutes."
"Yep plenty of problems which I *think* can be put down to 2 issues: (1) adoption of wind without storage that increased volatility of supply (2) failure in aging transmission infrastructure, required by coal generation, during storms.

Not really to do with being under-developed, but the addition of storage will improve the resilience of the network for a relatively nominal cost - certainly compared to the alternatives (ie building new power plants) and the cost of failure (ie disruption of business and households). "

"Oh I completely understand that, it's just countries and politics.

"From my understanding, one of the main factors is college price is demand, specifically demand for colleges capable of providing degrees in Stem fields, which often need expensive, constantly updated facilities.  Colleges make huge investments in their technological infrastructure, just to keep ahead of global competition.

While that is only one reason (administration bloat,professor shortages, general upkeep on aging infrastructure are others, decrease in state support) it's a pretty major reason, but it can be dealt with, by trying encourage people to go to two year colleges, or trade schools. This would decrease demand by a lot, and in the long run probably be more productive for a large portion students that end up leaving college 1-2 years in. 

Both Obama and Clinton had plans to accomplish shifting demand, and increase federal support of individuals, rather than a flat out tax, which would end up being regressive.

>...where they can pollute how they want...

The United States has cut its pollution in half over the last 10 years. Who made that happen? Industry made that happen. How? Technology. Turns out it's cheaper to burn less fuel. Win for capitalism. Who had nothing to do with it? The government. 

>...to lower prices and quality...

Okay. Some companies do that. They target a specific sector of the consumer base. Wal Mart may compete for those customers, but Brooks Bros. doesn't. Guess who wins: poor people who can't shop at Brooks. There's a place for them to buy clothes too. 

>... create monopolies (like what's happening with net neutrality)...

What's happening with net neutrality that creates a monopoly? There are no monopolies in the ISP space. If there were, deregulation would create more competition. Competition kills monopolies. Literally what are you saying.

Here's other other accomplishments, copied [from this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/42y3jp/all_i_hear_is_about_is_how_dishonest_and_bad/cze62ig/)

- expand health coverage for millions of kids

- After law school, Hillary could have gone to work for a prestigious law firm, but took a job at the Children‚Äôs Defense Fund. She worked with teenagers incarcerated in adult prisons in South Carolina and families with disabled children in Massachusetts.

- Helped get 9/11 first responders the health care they needed.

- In Beijing, told the world that ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs rights are human rights.‚Äù 

- As secretary of state, Hillary made LGBT rights a focus of U.S. foreign policy. She lobbied for the first-ever U.N. Human Rights Council resolution on human rights and declared that ‚Äúgay rights are human rights.‚Äù And here at home, she made the State Department a better, fairer place for LGBT employees to work.

- Hillary worked across the aisle to expand health care access for members of the National Guard and reservists‚Äîmaking sure those who served and their families had access to health care when they returned home. And she worked to expand the Family Medical Leave Act, allowing families of those wounded in service to their country to take leave in order to care for their loved ones.

- As our nation‚Äôs chief diplomat, Hillary didn‚Äôt back down when the stakes were high. As Hamas rockets rained down on Israel, Hillary went to the region immediately. Twenty-four hours after she landed, a ceasefire went into effect‚Äîand that year became Israel‚Äôs quietest in a decade.

- Her role in killing Osama bin Laden.

- Management of the State Department during which time we saw a 50 percent increase in exports to China

- aggressive work on climate (particularly at Copenhagen)

"Ending wars I could see. You'd have to show me the statistical data that shows the more than 50% support between Republicans and Democrats support a progressive tax, universal college, and universal healthcare. I'd highly disagree with those three, especially more progressive tax rate and healthcare. I could see universal college, but even I know that's highly unlikely. I'm open to changing my opinion if you can show me though. The reason I say this is I'm very politically involved (I've campaigned for both Republicans and Libertarians) and have never heard a single person on both of those sides in favor for three out of the four stated.

"Please provide sources debunking any critiques of mine. In the meantime, nuclear isn't happening so scurry along."
"I also agree that nuclear is neither clean nor sustainable. It's just that it's easier to mobilize people against that than against the other sources, even though it is not as costly for lives and the environment as those others.

So my point is twofold:
1. This is more of a high places/voltage problem than a wind problem.

2. If you factor in the rest of the infrastructure, nuclear power plants probably don‚Äôt have a meaningfully lower level of deaths.

With that being the case, I don‚Äôt think the extra cost is justified. And even if that‚Äôs not the case, the cost is so much higher that it‚Äôs basically irrelevant anyway. We could have less deaths by synthesizing gold in a lab, but you can bet your ass we‚Äôre still going to dig it out of the ground because the price is right."

I don't see any evidence of the shills or bots, nor anything that would even hint at or suggest there is a secret paid army of Sanders haters. Who is paying them? Why? I'm a Hillary person but if Bernie had won I'd have supported him and I don't know any Hillary people who felt otherwise. Contrary to the belief of some Bernie fans, there was no HillaryOrBust movement in 2016 and the PUMAs of 2008 were a fraction of a fraction of a minority of Hillary supporters, whose stories were mostly forgotten because they were so minor... But then they got amplified by Bernie fans in 2016 as away to deflect from how damaging the Bernie Or Bust movement was.

>Could I be totally wrong and the reality is that it‚Äôs all just genuine dislike of the man or his ideas? Perhaps but I find that unlikely. 

You know how Hillary beat Bernie by 4 million votes in the primary? Those and the other 15 million Dems who voted hillaey are people who genuinely just didnt want him to be the nominee. They weren't tricked, they weren't fooled, they just preferred Hillary to Bernie.

And it wasn't his ideas we didn't like, it was how unrealistic and not thought out his ideas were. His campaign to me consisted of a series of ""wouldn't it be great if"" statements that minimized just how vast and difficult those things are to do, and ignored that Dems have been fighting for these issues for decades. Sure it'd be great if healthcare was free but the fact is Dems have been working on that for decades. Am I really to believe Bernie can just come out of nowhere and accomplish in 4 years what hundreds of intelligent, hard working liberal democrats couldn't fully accomplish in 30 years? It's not only naive, but a bit insulting to those who came before him, those who forged the path. The only reason universal healthcare is even able to be part of the national conversation is because of Hillarycare in the 90s... And yet Bernie painted Hillary as soft on healthcare because she learned from her past and realized you can't get it all in one go, you have to take slow measured progress where.you can get it.



>You quoted me. I said ‚Äúso many,‚Äù not ‚Äúall.‚Äù  I did not mean to imply that every post that is negative toward Sanders is a bot or shill. But since you took it that way I‚Äôll make a note of that and try to come off less accusatory in the future.

">I‚Äôm not entitled and I would never say that Sanders has a monopoly on good ideas or that he‚Äôs the only one to express an interest in growing the middle class. I just happen to think that his proposals would do the most to actually make that a reality, when compared to the main opposition he faced in the 2016 Dem primary and those who he‚Äôs likely to face for 2020. 

How? How would those proposals actually do those things?

Don't just say we tax the rich, I wanna know how these things actually get implemented, how you think they'll pass an adversarial Congress and how they'll function better than proposals by his opponents.

""We're gonna do Single payer"" is also not an answer, nor is ""make Medicare for all"" these are stump speech lines, not actual policy proposals. And yes I've read Bernie's web site. None of it actually delves into implementation. For example none of his plans on healthcare explain how he's going to go about dismantling the private healthcare industry, which employs tens of millions of people and makes up 20% of the economy. You can't just switch it overnight, you need a vast, complex plan for how to actually make the changes... Bold big proposals don't mean anything if the details aren't worked out. 


>On the knowledge issue, I guess you can frame this any way you want. But he really has thought deeply about a wide array of issues that we face as a country. 

So have I... Doesn't mean I'm actually knowledgeable on policy.

>When he speaks in congress and now the senate you can tell he really comes prepared. This isn‚Äôt to say he‚Äôs the only person who knows their shit mind you. But to say that Hillary is a league ahead of him, I don‚Äôt buy that. Just my take. 

Even most Republicans appear to come prepared when they give speeches and stuff.

I don't think Bernie is a dummy, but in-depth policy knowledge was never his strong suit, and it has always been Hillary's strong suit.

"Name recognition was critical for sure. Trump won the primary because of that brand he had of getting things done. Republican voters like the rest of the country understand that there are large problems and society is not working for them. They wanted real change. 

Trump did not really win the general election as much as Hillary lost it. She moved to the right to try to court ""moderate"" Republicans rather than proposing left-wing policies that appeal to the Democratic base and independents. She attacked Trump endlessly instead of trying to make a case for her own campaign. It also didn't exactly help that she chose to spend the campaign with the same people that caused the financial crisis in '08. People were very uninspired by Hillary and chose to stay home. Trump managed to bring out enough of the Republican base and some working class voters to win the electoral votes. 

No one can say for sure but, it is likely that Bernie could have won if he had more recognition before the primary campaign started. He keeps going up in the polls as he becomes more and more recognized within the country. "

The cost of it everywhere else is half that per person as that of the USA. Copying any of the other effective national systems you could halve your cost, and have a buffer of twice the funding of every other nation that you're already used to paying to easily account for ageing demographics and the like.

I repeat, the only problem with medicare for all is conservative politicians consistently attempting to lower quality of service. The funding for it absolutely everywhere else in the world would have to be doubled to even begin to reach your current spend per person, doing so would far more than account for any other issues you could bring up.

The talk of it being costly elsewhere is simply because no other country is foolish enough to want to spend anywhere near as much as you already do, and like to complain about a cost half as much as that of yours raising by even 1%."

I, like Bernie, supported Hillary over Trump in the general and I don‚Äôt doubt that you would‚Äôve supported Sanders. It‚Äôs pretty clear that either of them would‚Äôve been a much better commander and chief than the Donald. 

On healthcare, Bernie was right there with Hillary in the 90s fighting for universal healthcare. He‚Äôs still doing it to this day. He was a huge supporter of Obamacare and did a lot to get it passed. I think that it makes sense to shoot for your end goal and then compromise from there. The goal is universal single payer healthcare. Why not say that? If you end up only getting incremental progress that is okay, but we need to change people‚Äôs minds as time moves forward. If Medicare for all, or whatever you want to call it, is ever going to actually happen we need influential people coming out strongly for it.

"The second half is just whether he‚Äôs knowledgeable or not, so we‚Äôll skip that. I understand your viewpoint now, it‚Äôs basically just that our semantics didn‚Äôt really line up originally. 

As far as policy and how it would get implemented, there‚Äôs a wide variety of issues and to tackle them all with adequate depth would take quite a long time. So here‚Äôs one example of why I think Sanders is one of the best options for president that we have in the political arena right now:

On military and wars, he is staunchly against anything that isn‚Äôt necessary. He‚Äôs also against constantly increasing military spending. Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, all of these cost billions to continue, and they aren‚Äôt stabilizing the region. We‚Äôve been funding both sides of some conflicts around the world. This is a terrible use of our resources and the president has a lot of power to curb these excesses without needing to pass legislation. I also think that Sanders treats people with respect and doesn‚Äôt view life as a big chess match. I think he would be able to improve America‚Äôs standing around the world by coming from a place of genuine diplomacy. 

And since we‚Äôre in the Tesla subreddit, I‚Äôll just point out that Sanders has been a huge proponent of helping renewable energy through policy. His approach is simple but effective: decrease or end the subsidies that go to oil and coal companies, and fill the EPA with scientific minds that will make sensible regulations. Clinton seemed vaguely pro-environment on the trail but I didn‚Äôt hear her talking every speech about the subsidies the way that Sanders did. 

And finally just on a general note, I feel that Clinton was very reactionary. Whenever a big issue popped up on the campaign trail, she was able to come out and give what sounded like a decent answer to it. But to me it felt like it was the result of a team of talking points pros who also run focus groups all the time calculating what sounds the best to diffuse or take advantage of that particular situation. I didn‚Äôt get the sense that she had some deep reason that she wanted to be president. I do feel that for her it was more about power and fame than actually doing the best for the country. I‚Äôm not accusing her of being deliberately bad, I just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any issue that she cared so deeply about that she‚Äôd be willing to go down supporting it. Her campaign reminded me of when a football team is up with 4 minutes to go and gets the ball. She‚Äôs the team that runs 3 times to kill the clock and punts, hoping to hang on. 

Sanders seems much more genuine to me in that sense. He truly believes in providing healthcare to all, tuition-free college, ending our wars. And I think he cares about us more than any other major politician out there. This is not something you can quantify, but I‚Äôm just giving you a sense of where my views are coming from. "
"Daughter came out? Don't know your angle there. Clinton supported gay marriage from 2013. Bernie started supporting it in 2009. Now, my question was, when did Clinton veer to the right during the election? "

>The article above shows otherwise, and even suppose it wasn't, Clinton won by a whopping 12%. That's a landslide.

She won by 12% among 14.4% of eligible voters. So she actually won by .017%. Given closed primaries, debates being minimized, endorsements coming in before the campaign even started, Clinton being told about debate questions in advance, and the DNC not even being able to make a press release without clearing it with the Clinton campaign first, there was a lot of bias. 

I don't know who would have won a fair primary. Maybe the most loyal partisan Democrats would still have made the mistake of voting for Clinton to be the nominee, maybe they wouldn't. But to hold up her primary victory as proof of her viability is absurd. Keep in mind she lost the general election against a poor excuse for a racist orangutan.

>Turns out there are more center left democrats than there are socialists, go figure.

Except among independents and Republicans, Sanders is more popular, hence the leading in national polls. The Democratic party is ruled by people who want to be Republican light, and it is a losing strategy. 

>
Why does that matter, Clinton was the post popular politician in 2010-2013. It's a mostly meaningless measurement. Populism is cancer.

Populism wins elections, as it should. She was beaten by a poor excuse for a racist orangutan with a populist message. If you think American voters are that racist, you might want to look at the previous president who is very much not white.

It turns out, in a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, running a campaign that appeals to what people want is the way to win. Even better if you actually stand behind it, better still if you can show people a better way by actually leading. On the other hand, having a separate private position you tell your banker buddies and public position you use to try and get votes is far more cancerous than democracy. "
"Yep, both authoritarian governments! Soviet Union ,another country Bernie praised!"
"Didn't mean to come off as an ass. Sorry.

That's not correct about taxes. The top 40% pay about 80-90% of all taxes collected. The bottom 40% actually get money back, so they don't pay for anyone. The middle 20% more or less breaks even. Unless you're in the top 40%, your taxes aren't paying for anything except for maybe the processing fees to get your tax ""refund"" to you."
"I'll admit it, I don't like the corruption which so typifies the Quebec government-private scene. The government has taken so much power away from private citizens (relatively) that pay for play is all that occurs there. It is the most corrupt province in Canada, much like France indeed.

Furthermore, if you look into the average rates of other hydro sources in other provinces, BC or Manitoba Hydro, the rates are only slightly more expensive.

"
"Except it is not a competitive market place. I‚Äôm not sure why anyone would think that this is a good idea?

There are a lot of libertarian minded people who think that free market will give them efficient outcomes in all scenarios. This is simply not true.

There are similar people who believe that all regulations are bad for the consumer. This is also not true. Some are bad, some are good. In this case, consumers are best served by a free and open Internet."
"Aww are your feelings hurt? Yes, any person that supports repealing net neutrality is either part of an ISP corporation or a complete idiot. The only possible outcome for the consumer is higher prices for more limited services. There is no alternative."
"There is no such thing as an anti-monopolistic regulation. All regulations are pro-monopoly. 

Every regulation either punishes one party, or offers undue assistance to another party, or both. In all cases, the party receiving special favors and privileges gains market share they did not earn through fair competition, and which cannot be won back through fair competition. There's a word for an entrenched interest who cannot be challenged through competition: a monopoly. "
"What's interesting to me is that you're here, on /r/TeslaMotors, arguing to me that the free market can't achieve things that government fails to achieve. Elon Musk has revolutionized clear energy technology, clean automotive technology, and space technology: all troubled segments of the economy the Left once claimed only government could solve, and he did it all through capitalism. 

When was the last time the government sent a shuttle to the Moon? The 1970s. Musk is preparing a private mission to Mars as we speak. 

Without free markets, there is no Tesla Motors. There is no SpaceX. There is no SolarCity. I'd say markets are kicking your ass. "
"So I'm not against net neutrality as policy per se. I think we're being fed coarse arguments deliberately. There's a more nuanced approach available that people are either not aware exists or the talking heads in the media are deliberately excluding, or both. 

If *Congress* were to pass a Net Nuetrality law, I wouldn't be opposed to that, even if the entire text of that bill were identical to the current FCC regulations in place. However, it's not fair to the businesses in this space for these policies to come down from an executive regulatory agency, and it's also not fair to the voter for the bureaucrats who set this policy to be both unelected and out of reach of accountability to the American people. So my problem with NN starts there: it's structurally flawed in that it depends upon regulatory authority that rightfully should be vested with the legislative branch. 

That alone is reason enough for me to approve of this action from the FCC. I think the executive branch should yield back this regulatory authority, and it's still entirely possible and even perhaps desirable for Congress to come in after the fact with regulations of their own. 

However. There are software companies who take advantage of NN at the expense of the telecom companies, and that isn't fair. Netflix sucks up a hugely disproportionate quantity of bandwidth. The telecom companies aren't wrong to feel that they deserve some commensurate compensation for that. Netflix is currently a beneficiary of corporate welfare. 

I think there's a reasonable fee that Netflix can and should pay. I don't think that means telecom companies should be able to slice and dice the Internet for their consumers, either. I think there's a compromise here that can be hashed out, but it can and should be done in the halls of Congress. 

I don't think there's any risk that ISPs are going to slice and dice the Internet, because they don't in fact have the monopoly that the alarmists claim they do. They are subject to market forces, and their industry is undergoing tremendous technological disruption. They need their customers. You have a lot more power right now than they do.

"Because it's not a straight tax at all? You aren't pulling form 242,000,000 tax payers.

And if we it was, why should the rich pay the same tax, and go to college for free, when they could already easily do so? Poor people should no subsidize the secondary education of the wealthy. 

[The whole concept is a regressive tax.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-10-30/free-college-would-help-the-rich-more-than-the-poor)

The people that need that education the most aren't failing in college, but in primary education. So there's a whole portion of the number above that will not support or ever make use of that tax, but little or to no fault of their own. They won't be so eager to pay that tax like you are.

Need-based aid is probably a much better solution, coupled with free 2 year college.

"Again, highly disagree. Australia does have a better healthcare for all system that all the other nations, but is let down by accessibility factors including cost and lack of timely access which has been heavily recorded. 

Also, maybe in Australia, but the conservatives over in America differ greatly. The left likes the idea for healthcare for all  but doesn't take into account the cost and economic impact it will have on the majority of the population. Not to mention, we have over 10x the population Australia does. You don't take that into consideration like a lot of other people. "
"Well, that‚Äôs another problem. Sanders is too obsessed with being like all the other nations when all the other nations Medicare for all plans are failing. Even states that have tried it have ultimately failed. California seems poised to give it a try, but they soon found out it would bankrupt the entire state. Taxing the rich isn‚Äôt the solution either, because heavily taxing them wouldn‚Äôt even pay for it because the numbers Sanders gave were off by a long shot and many economists stated that when he proposed it. 

Britain, Canada, Scandinavian countries, etc. All there health plans that Bernie praises so much are a complete mess and on the brink of a collapse in some form. 

Do we need to come together? Of course, but I believe we need to come together by letting the free markets do there thing and a little less regulation from the government that‚Äôs restricting great thing that can happen (debatable). 

Also, are people dying? Yes. But they aren‚Äôt going to magically come alive by being taxed like crazy for below mediocre healthcare. Taxing the rich wouldn‚Äôt even cover the costs. We have more than triple the population these other countries have. You can‚Äôt follow a socialist utopia when these countries are spending out the butt and economically hurting themselves. That‚Äôd setting up for failure. "

"Of course you also need to build something to house a reactor, but a single reactor building produces enough power for 100s of wind turbines. So how many people die is very relevant if you consider safty of all humans.

But since that argument of yours of course does not work you go to the next best 'nuclear waste' argument. An argument that is even worse, given that nuclear waste has never really killed anybody. That nuclear waste is increadibly small amount compared to the energy you produce. And most nuclear waste is not actually waste, most of it are resources that future reactors can consume and it contains important elements that can be used for space exploration and in the medical field.

The anti-nuclear activist have truly succeded on making this nuclear waste issue way larger then it is. Any actual rational thinking about nuclear waste will show that it is not the issue people make it out to be. For the last 40 years anti-nuclear activism and government regulation are responsable for the continued use of coal and gas.

Yes we can now in the next 30-50 years do it without nuclear, but we could have done it 30 years ago with nuclear. So we just wasted 70 years of carbon production because of these stupid argument that were never actually true."
"Are you angry cause I'm right? Have you realized that fear will always and forever rule human beings?

You can make all the logical arguments you want. You can downplay the death of human beings by applying numeric values to their lives. A dash of statistics here, a little Gaslighting there. Until you weild fear, humans will always choose the ""safer"" route. But safety is all about perspective. Wants some advice? Start using fear. Information is dead. The information age has overwhelmed common folk. It's power has been dispersed.

Fear is everywhere, I'm sure you can scare some people into believing nuclear is the safest route.

I kind of want nuclear to happen now. Maybe my points will just prove themselves or maybe I'll be proved wrong. Yet, until nuclear advocates begin to use carbon emissions and the end of our species to scare people into supporting nuclear, we'll just have to settle for renewables."
"> Correct The Record

Why don't you have a problem with Bernie's Revolution Messaging, which out spent CTR by $16 million? "
">The 2016 campaign and Correct The Record are the direct reason I think that some of this paid PR is still going on. It‚Äôs not like it never happened. 

No... It IS like it never happened. 

""The 2016 campaign"" means nothing. She had a campaign, therefore there must be a secret army of anti Bernie shills? Despite no evidence, no reporting from any reputable journalists and no real reason to believe it unless you struggle to accept that some people just don't like Bernie?

As for Correct the record... It wasn't a covert operation involving paid shills. It was basically a social media ad campaign. There were never secret paid people, and there was never even any indication there were... Bernie people just heard about the organization and determined all on their own, from thin air, that it must explain why there are anti Bernie people in the world.


>I‚Äôve said multiple times now that I don‚Äôt think everyone or most people are paid. I do think some are though. 

Despite a lack of evidence? I mean... Go ahead.

I have 16 us intelligence agencies, the new york times, Washington Post and basically every other reputable reporter out there saying that there were Russian anti Hillary bots.

None of those groups have suggested there was any kind of anti Bernie stuff going on... And frankly speaking, Hillary didn't need it, and she definitely doesn't need it now. She beat Bernie quite handily, 4 million out of ~30 million votes cast is a win of more than 10% which in modern elections is pretty much considered a landslide.

What in your mind is the motivation of this tiny secret paid army that has evaded detection by US intelligence and never been reported on by any reputable journalists? 


>I, like Bernie, supported Hillary over Trump in the general and I don‚Äôt doubt that you would‚Äôve supported Sanders. It‚Äôs pretty clear that either of them would‚Äôve been a much better commander and chief than the Donald. 

If you feel that way, maybe the next step is to wonder why you still believe some Hillary rumors that started on the right, such as the existence her secret trolling army? They're trying to divide us.  Don't let them get away with it.

>On healthcare, Bernie was right there with Hillary in the 90s fighting for universal healthcare. He‚Äôs still doing it to this day. He was a huge supporter of Obamacare and did a lot to get it passed. I think that it makes sense to shoot for your end goal and then compromise from there. The goal is universal single payer healthcare. Why not say that? If you end up only getting incremental progress that is okay, but we need to change people‚Äôs minds as time moves forward.

Your worldview ignores a lot of realities, like the fact that pushing directly for universal single payer ignores the entire half of the country who doesn't want it at all. Sure hillary people can understand what Bernie means, but we're not the people you need to convince. You can't just lead by leading the left, when you're the president you are the president of everyone. 

When you push hard to the left, the right responds by pushing hard to the right. When you meet someone in the middle, they're more likely to meet you there too.

When you come at it from the center, when you make an effort to understand both sides and say ""I'm not gonna force my idea down your throat"" you end up making more real progress than you do by simply shouting ""single payer"" a lot with no real plans to implement it, much less any way to get people who disagree to buy into your plan.

And furthermore, the whole idea of coming at it like a negotiator at a car dealer, come in with a super low offer you know they won't take then end up with a deal you like? That is the same thing trump said he would do and he's learning what many of us already know: governments don't work like sales. It's not one individual negotiating against one other... It's hundreds of individual stakeholders with hundreds of individual motivations and goals, including some you agree with and some you don't, which is why you try to make your proposals as inviting and open as possible, not just make them proposals of what a perfect liberal world would be like.

>If Medicare for all, or whatever you want to call it, is ever going to actually happen we need influential people coming out strongly for it. 

I genuinely don't think that at all. This stuff doesn't happen overnight, you don't need to come our super strong for something that we're realistically 10-20 years away from, you need to be for the kinds of incremental change that keep us on the path, and therefore don't scare away moderate and right wing voters. 


>That‚Äôs what Bernie did, and what Hillary declined to do, during the 2016 campaign. 

Because she knew, unlike Bernie, just how big of a challenge it was, and how divisive healthcare is... So she framed it as incremental progress, not as revolutionary change. And if you look back at the history of this country, the change that sticks is always measured evolution, not revolution.

We did have two revolution in this country, but they came with a body count. That's why measured evolution is the better way to make progress and make it stick.

The progressive tax one was mostly based on a recent poll that asked people if taxation for the lower class, middle class, small businesses, the rich, or large corporations was too high or too low. I can't for the life of it find it right now, which is why I've taken so long to reply.  
To no one's surprise, an overwhelming share of respondents believe that corporations and the rich aren't taxed enough, while the lower and middle class and small businesses are taxed too much.

"Cost per person? Half that of yours while covering absolutely everyone. 

Individual cost? None at all, you get sick, you get taken care of. No direct costs involved, no bills for hospital stays, no bills for surgeries or the like.

It's all covered by general taxation with a small percentage medicare levy taken from the richest of the population on top of the normal tax rate, works out very well indeed.

Timely access? Any necessary surgeries are generally done on the day itself as soon as the issue crops up. Elective surgeries can wait a relatively short period of time sure, though it's still possible to pay a private provider to skip the queue if wanted. Usually that isn't wanted as it isn't warranted. If you want to have a few moles removed which are doing you no harm you can wait a month or two before having it done, no big deal.

Population has certainly been taken into consideration - the higher population you have doesn't hurt you in this equation, it helps you.

Higher population gives greater benefit from economies of scale, having so much population backed by a single payer system gives whichever agency controls it immense bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies, which drops the price of medication heavily, lowering the ability to gouge out excessive profits.

This is the practical effect seen worldwide, the higher your population the better pricing you can get for all of these things. Your cost per person goes down.

Your cost should be less than half of what you currently pay, and could easily be so should you switch to universal single payer healthcare. Hell you could instead only cut funding by a third, still be paying more than everyone else in the world with which you increase your current quality of service and health outcomes, use that excess funding to have a more effective system than everywhere else in the world while also paying far less than you used to.

> Yet, until nuclear advocates begin to use carbon emissions and the end of our species to scare people into supporting nuclear, we'll just have to settle for renewables.

They do use that argument, there is whole movie 'Pandora's Promise' that uses exactly that argument. The problem is that in the last 20 year the left has convinced all the liberals that we can just do it with renewable no problem. That was simply a lie, germany is putting in massive effort and it will still take 20 more years until they are completly off coal and they still buy nuclear from france.

So if liberals would stop this stupid 'we can easly do it with renewable no problem at all' argument, then it would be way easier to confince people of nuclear. France used nuclear to easly solve the carbon problem years ago, while everybody that tries it with renewable is progressing slowly.

The economics of laying fiber optic cable result in natural monopolies, just like telephone and electricity wires laid in the 20th century. These natural monopolies must be regulated like utilities. Broadband is no different.

Cable companies are pissed that people aren‚Äôt paying for cable, and they want to turn your internet service into a cable package.

Care to explain how you got to your current opinion? I can readily explain my deductive process.

"Do consumers like zero-rating plans? Yes. Does that make them consumer friendly? In my opinion no. 

If the consumer has zero-rating for one company over the other (i.e. unlimited Netflix instead of Hulu), then it is harder for companies to compete based on quality of service. Competition is good for consumers.

Price discrimination makes sense for lots of products in competitive market places. But that is not what we are talking about. This is not economics 101. Broadband internet is often sold in non-competitive markets, much like utilities. Will my electric company give me one rate for running my microwave, and a higher rate for charging my Tesla?

Bandwidth must be a public utility, just like power. Sure, maybe you can charge higher prices during peak demand (like power). But a watt is a watt and a megabyte is a megabyte."

"Works out well? Come on, stop lying to yourself. You aren't fooling any logical person that understands taxes and economics. Have fun with your $32T added to spending over the next decade that has been evaluated and estimated by liberal think tanks. The same people that support single payer. Last American single-payer proposal was California which had to shoot it down because it would bankrupt the state.

Keep in mind, these other countries don't have to fund a national defense that protects the industrialized free world that allows a lot of these countries to invest so heavily into healthcare for all, yet still, fail at it. Not to mention, our GDP greatly outnumbers these other countries despite are screwed up healthcare system which I agree we spend way too much on. 

I'm going to use our neighbors to the North as an example since the left loves their healthcare so much. 

Let's get into some quantifiable statistics:
- Canada on average has 20% of it's people waiting in an emergency room for more than 5 hours at a time. Quebec, 35%. US, 5%.
-Quality of care. We have over 5x the medical equipment. Which is odd, because you'd think with healthcare for all, the government would properly equip it's hospitals or in the least, give enough so these hospitals would be able to afford this kind of equipment. The US has 9x as many MRI machines per capita basis, 4x lithotripsy machines per capita basis, and 3x CT scanners per capita basis. Not to mention, most medical research is coming out of the US. 
- The rate of dying from certain cancers (breast, prostate, etc.) is 2x as likely in countries with single payer. 

Compare all of that with those who use single payer compared to the citizens that use privatized care. There's this idea of ""well, at least everyone will have the same care"" which is utter BS and statistics prove that. No matter how messed up the system is here in the US, which I agree it is, it vastly outnumbers single-payer countries in many categories. And yes, the population does matter. you might want to look more into that because I wasn't expecting to type this long to begin with lol. "

"Oh yeah, I agree completely. It's horrible that we are so low on the life expectancy poll, but I personally blame it on the meat obsession America has. Like you said, healthcare would certainly bump that up, but I just don't believe relying on tax dollars to improve a system that could potentially hurt us economically is the way to go.

Is a regressive tax on the poor. Why should the rich/those who can easily afford college go for free? Individual based discounts (scholarships & grants) are far better, or even better decreasing demand by providing alternatives in secondary education like 2 year colleges and trade schools. That will decrease the cost of 4 year colleges, and be more productive in the long run. Clinton & Obama supported free two year college.  

>payer healthcare

Most if not all democrats will agree with you on some form of Universal Healthcare, single payer is just one option in how we could do that, but has many down sides. Sander's has promoted state-based single payer, which is almost completely unfeasible. California's attempt at a similar system cost 400 billion dollars, twice the size California's whole budget. That's an obvious problem. Medicare for all is a step in a better direction, [but it's not the only option.](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/9/8/16271888/health-care-single-payer-aca-democratic-agenda) 

>switch to sustainable energy as quickly as possible

Yea sure, even Clinton supports that, but also we have to do so without economically neutering ourselves in the process. Democrats also disagree on what measures in we achieve clean energy, or what is sustainable even is. For instance, Hydro electric is a renewable technically, but environmentally disastrous.  At the same time, nuclear is not technically sustainable, but it's environmental impact is far less than that of Hydro electric.  

>and removing the influence of money from policy.

Clinton helped write [Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001](https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/senate-bill/00027/cosponsors) and is very much against the supreme courts decision on [citizens united](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC), supporting a constitutional convention to overturn it, [and put limits back on campaign spending.](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/hillary-clinton-citizens-united-225658).

So if look at that we see we agree on 3 out of 5 (roughly).We're mostly on the same page here, except there's tons of nuance to these issues, as shown above. And that's why myself and a portion of democrats have issues with Sander's platform. There is no compromising, there is no plan b or c, only his way or no way.

>Are you going to look for another candidate like Clinton? 

I will 100% the candidate who supports evidence based, nuanced policy over a populist screaming empty promises.

The United States Supreme Court held (5‚Äì4) on January 21, 2010 that the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the government from restricting independent expenditures for communications by nonprofit corporations, for-profit corporations, labor unions, and other associations.

In the case, the conservative non-profit organization Citizens United sought to air a film critical of Hillary Clinton and to advertise the film during television broadcasts shortly before the 2008 Democratic primary election in which Clinton was running for U.S. President.

And one more thing, saying you mostly agree, but that your opponent is making empty promises is part of why people don't believe Hillary Clinton. When it comes to the nuance, Clinton and Sanders are pretty similar. Trouble is, Clinton spent half the campaign saying she agreed with him, and the other half saying what he wanted was impossible.

>screaming empty promises.

Bernie Sanders did not scream. And single payer is not some impossible dream, it is something that has been done by countries with less money than we have, same with free college.

None of that is a plan. It's a wish list

None of those are policies, they're statements.

I want all those things too, and a solid gold toilet seat, but unless you have a *viable* plan to get those things, just saying you want them accomplishes nothing.


>There‚Äôs others but those are what appeal to me the most. Again I don‚Äôt want to argue every point, this isn‚Äôt really the time or the place. I completely respect your opinion and if you don‚Äôt agree with some or all of these proposals, that‚Äôs fine. 

None of those were proposals... Again they are a wish list.  

For example... HOW do you actually get a 15 dollar minimum wage? 

Yes we know Bernie wants it, and I want it to... but what's his plan to pass it? What's his plan to get even a few members of the GOP on board? What's his plan to account for the fact that in the rural areas, raising the minimum wage that much, that quickly, will cause most businesses to have to dramatically cut their staff? 


These are questions no Bernie supporter has EVER answered for me... They just pivot to more talking points on the wish list... Which is frankly exactly what you did. The fact that this is a telsa sub doesn't mean you're forbidden from answering my questions, it's not a good excuse to avoid giving answers.

I wanna hear nuanced solutions to complex problems, not what would be great to have if we could get anything we wanted without consequences.

I believe that trying to appeal to Evangelicals dictates his position on that particular one, to be honest. Libertarians are forced to compete in the GOP in this two-party system after all. :("
"It seems to me that the only thing they disagree about is how to best address the problem of corruption.  

Libertarians trust in corporations under the free market. People on the economic left trust in government picking up that slack.  
At the end of the day both government and corporations are manned by [the] people, so what matters is that the system and the incentives are set up correctly.  

Aside from that, there's also the difference between hard focus on individual liberty versus looking at social liberty more broadly -- that is policy strictly from philosophical principles, versus policy from real-world interactions.  

Imo libertarianism sounds nice on paper, just like communism does, but both fail to account and correct for human stupidity, recklessness, and so forth. You need free market forces because humans can't possibly account for everything, but you also need regulations because humans refuse to account for things if they can (negative externalities) and can't blanket privatize sectors in which sole focus on profit can't guide in the direction of good service (infrastructure, policing, health care)."

">I mean, you get things done by proposing them and then whipping up your party, going to the press and social media to hopefully get support from the ground, and make deals if necessary to get a little support from a few legislators on the other side. 

No... That's not how you get things done.

You get things done by having viable plans that can actually pass and actually work.

All that stuff you described, it's how you campaign, not how you govern. Bernie had great proposals for a campaign, Hillary had realistic proposals to actually govern, and it was a breath of fresh air to see someone talking realistically, not just promising the moon.

I wanna know what deals he wants to make are, the real details not just the wish list, I wanna know how he gets support from legislators on the other side. I wanna see PLANS not statements of desire, not simplistic explanations of how passing a bill works.

>The blueprint isn‚Äôt any different for Sanders than it is for anyone else. It‚Äôs hard to get things passed, we all know this. It‚Äôs why every president only gets a small fraction of what they campaign on done. 

Actually, that's not true. If you're unrealistic you don't get much done... If you're realistic you can get a lot more done.

What was Hillary‚Äôs plan for passing it with a congress controlled by a party that consistently calls her a criminal and traitor? If I recall correctly, she changed her position a few times on this subject, eventually settling on a $12 minimum. 

It actually never changed it was always 12, and that was always meant to be a step on the path to higher than 12. 12 is simply more viable, more realistic for where we are now and more likely to get moderate support in Congress.

Hillary, unlike Bernie, has a lot of friends across the aisle from her days as a senator. Bernie made enemies of everyone, right left and center, because his views were so inflexible. 

The GOP will attack anyone who is against them, if you think for a second they wouldn't go after Bernie if he won you're dreaming. The reason they never went after Bernie is because he was never a threat. "
"Which question, specifically?"
"I didn‚Äôt hear any detailed plan out of Hillary on how she was going to pass her wish list. She said the usual stuff that all politicians, including Bernie, say.

Sanders does have friends on the other side of the aisle as well. Are you like a Washington insider? You talk like you need to see like all the congressional documents to understand every detail before you‚Äôll believe anything. You also talk like you know these people personally and know what everyone else feels about them. 

Besides any of this, we‚Äôre talking about the past. Hillary already won the nomination and then lost the election. She doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs going to run again, although I guess that could change. Trump is pretty inept so I imagine any Dem would have a good chance. "
">I didn‚Äôt hear any detailed plan out of Hillary on how she was going to pass her wish list. 

Hers wasn't a wish list it was a series of realistic proposals.

That said don't turn this on me you still haven't answered basically any of my questions.



>No detailed description of which members of congress she‚Äôs going to sway, what exactly she‚Äôs going to say to them, how she‚Äôs going to pressure them. 

Actually she did have all those plans. Of course she didn't say them in her speeches, and I wouldn't expect Bernie to detail plans in a speech either... but the mere fact that her proposals were less outlandish and more realistic was itself a huge difference.

Let's fix and expand obamacare as a step on the path to universal care,  is clearly more realistic and viable than let's jump straight to single payer.


>Sanders does have friends on the other side of the aisle as well. 

Who?

>Are you like a Washington insider? You talk like you need to see like all the congressional documents to understand every detail before you‚Äôll believe anything. You also talk like you know these people personally and know what everyone else feels about them. 

I know that Bernie has had a history of alienating both liberals and conservatives... This has been reported on countless times, one does not need to be an insider to know that. 




>Besides any of this, we‚Äôre talking about the past. Hillary already won the nomination and then lost the election. She doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs going to run again, although I guess that could change. Trump is pretty inept so I imagine any Dem would have a good chance. 

I don't think Hillary is going to run, but I sure as heck hope Bernie doesn't.

You have been remarkably good at avoiding actually answering any of my questions. Almost as good as Bernie was at avoiding releasing his tax returns, and avoiding giving actual explanations of how he planned to implement his proposals."
"We‚Äôll just have to see. Your wish list vs. proposal argument makes no sense to me. Every proposal is a wish until it‚Äôs an actual bill. You spent all that time saying that Sanders needs detailed explanations of exactly how he‚Äôs going to get each of his proposals passed, but now you say we should just basically trust that Clinton has such a plan. And further you‚Äôre now saying Sanders likely has those plans as well, but it‚Äôs just that his proposals are too ambitious to get done. 

Basically you‚Äôre saying something very simple: Sanders isn‚Äôt realistic and we can‚Äôt get the things done that he wants to get done. It‚Äôs fine to have that opinion, but there‚Äôs no need to go on about back room dealings and all that. I just happen to disagree. "
">We‚Äôll just have to see. Your wish list vs. proposal argument makes no sense to me. 

So you can't make sense of why realistic proposals are better than wish lists? Ok.

>Every proposal is a wish until it‚Äôs an actual bill. 

No.... Wish lists are wish lists. Proposals are proposals.

Here's a wish: universal healthcare by single payer right now.

Here's a proposal: expanding obamacare subsidies to make healthcare more affordable for more people through a system we already have in place and therefore doesn't require massive, immediate disruptive change, while simultaneously slowly expanding medicare as a stepping stone towards shifting away from a private dominant system to a public dominant one.



>You spent all that time saying that Sanders needs detailed explanations of exactly how he‚Äôs going to get each of his proposals passed, but now you say we should just basically trust that Clinton has such a plan.

No... She had the plans. They're just log and complex and so I don't have them memorized but they are all available online.

Bernie's talking points are easier to repeat, yes, but that doesn't make them better.




>Basically you‚Äôre saying something very simple: Sanders isn‚Äôt realistic and we can‚Äôt get the things done that he wants to get done. It‚Äôs fine to have that opinion, but there‚Äôs no need to go on about back room dealings and all that. I just happen to disagree. 

Well history has proven being realistic is how progress is made... People talk about moon landings and the new deal like they came out of nowhere, like they were totally impossible until they happened, which just isn't the case. Landing on the moon was in fact relatively easy, all it took was funding. The new deal? That was the result of an immense amount of back room meetings and dealings, FDR was a party insider to the core and got shit done not by being idealistic but by being ruthlessly pragmatic.

It really isn't much more detailed than that. I researched it during the campaign and really never found that there was anything ""there"" there. His plans laid out what a perfect healthcare system in a perfect world would look like, but they really never laid out how we get from here to there... And the plans never acknowledged just how far away we are. 

We're 70 yards from the end zone and Bernie was promising to get us their in a single Hail Mary pass, when everyone knows the most likely outcome of a hail Mary pass is an incomplete or interception. Hillary was promising to get us a solid 30 yards up the field through gritty but unglamorous run plays and short passes. And because she promised something more realistic, getting there was actually more possible.

>He has actually introduced a bill. I haven‚Äôt read it but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs longer than two words. 

I did actually look through the bill... And it really was mostly a wish list. This is because the bill was never intended to pass - Bernie himself admitted this on NPR - it was intended in a way not too dissimilar to when the GOP ""repealed"" the ACA over and over while Obama was president, knowing he'd veto it right away. They got to tell their base they put up the bill and they tried to repeal ACA, which made the base feel good, even though they never had to actually plan out how they'd really repeal the ACA or replace it.

And by the way that's not to say Bernie is like the Republicans. Other Dems do that tactic too, it's a typical opposition tactic to keep your base satisfied... its why we see Dems introducing articles of impeachment that we know the GOP controlled house will never go with... It just that those symbolic, base-placating bills dont really accomplish anything tangible.

I mean im not gonna go point for point, but effectively it's what I said... It's a lot of text but not a lot of substance. It explains why a universal healthcare system is good, and why our current system is bad... but it doesn't really explain how we get from here to there.

I feel like this sentence kind of sums up what I mean:

""Under Bernie‚Äôs plan, Americans will benefit from the freedom and security that comes with finally separating health insurance from employment.""

Yes, that is why a universal healthcare plan is good... No it doesn't do anything to help us get there or even explain how...


There is a lot of explaining what it is, and how it would work if we could basically just dictate exactly how it'd function in a perfect world, but little in the way of actual plans, and little in the way of compromises that might actually attract anyone who is moderate or conservative but is amenable to the idea of making health coverage better."

"So, does this mean that ALL employees have already received the configuration invite?
Any employee out there that did NOT receive the configuration invite?"
I got my email today as well. I ordered on 3/31 in store. I purchased a Model X this year so I jumped the line. Now I am thinking I don‚Äôt need a Model 3 at the moment and I‚Äôm really considering either delaying or cancelling all together. If I‚Äôm going to keep it I think I just might list it on Turo. Hmmm. 
Are all people invited current Tesla owners and California residents?
"GS just the other day said that the semi and roadster event was just a cover-up on model 3 woes. 

Now *this* is a smackdown. "

"What did you have checked for the vehicle you wanted? LR, SR, AWD?"
"As a 3/31 reservation holder in CA, this is starting to feel real and I'm freaking out right now cause I'm still torn between blue and midnight silver. 

 I don't know what to do.

"Is there any news about when reservation holders will have an opportunity to test drive a 3?  Back in the summer they said tes drives would be possible in ""late 2017""."
Great to see the configurator open up but I'm kind of sad to see no other interior options. Was hoping that when customer configurator opened up we would have an option of white interior.
"Do you know if we will be able to add on the enhanced auto pilot and/or full self driving in the future, or does it have to be added on and paid for at time of purchase?"
"Still nothing about the ""token of appreciation"" for first day line waiters it seems."
"Just configured mine!

Located in the LA area, waited in line day of, and currently own a Model S.

Edit: wanted to add that I got my email invite at about 1:30pm PST on 11/22.

WooWooWoo!!! It's starting! 
"I haven‚Äôt reserved an model 3 yet but own a Model S. when do you think I would receive it by. Also I am in Shanghai, China."
"Is there anything hinting if they are set up to take trade-ins on the model 3, or would that happen later in the process?"
Looks like no option and no info on getting the white interior. Hopefully they open that up before too long.
I own a model S and am in NYC. Yesterday my Dad told me he's interested in a Tesla when his lease is up in like 6 months! If I bought one on his behalf is it still going to take years to get? We have no reservation at this point. I guess he could also get a CPO Model S. 
"When did you reserve? I haven‚Äôt gotten anything yet. So Cal Tesla owner who reserved when online ordering opened up. 

Doesn‚Äôt matter since I am holding out for white interior. "
Was that the best interest rate you could find? Was it through Tesla or a partner?
"So, it looks like the configurator allows you to build the car and place the order. What if you want to lease? How does that work?"
"FWIW I'm a bay area line-standing non-current-owner and have not yet been invited. Not complaining (I'm excited!), just providing a data point. Sounds like we've at least reached the line-standers in CA that already own teslas. Progress!"
[deleted]
Does that mean the bottleneck in production has been resolved?
Too bad I‚Äôm still to poor to jump on the renewable energy cars bandwagon :/
Was your original delivery estimate November - January?  Mine is December to February.  
Yes yes yes this makes me happy

"MS owner in the east coast South Florida , no invite yet"
Is there no option for a service plan?
792 a month for the decked out one 0.o that is kinda doable.  
When will model 3 production exceed S and X production?
"I hate to be the perennial sceptic, but does anybody think they‚Äôre possibly doing this in order to meet qualifications for Motor Trend car of the year‚Äîin that the car is on sale?  I.e. bump up some people in the queue so some non employees get cars this year which is a requirement?  "
A surprising number of people with tiny dicks in here today. This must have hit /r/all.
"Did some browsing on u/youyouxue posting history.  He appears to be a 19/20 year old who took delivery of a P100DL late last year according to this thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6iw91f/here_is_my_fullres_unzoomed_photo_ft_charging/

The configurator pictures are probably accurate.  Given the poster's checkered history, however, there's a good chance they are from an employee/family member and not because the configurator has been opened to us regular customers."
Jesus why are they still offering FSD as an option?  It needs to be pulled until its ready.
"So, is it only this one person or have multiple people gotten their emails?"

So this should mean production has ramped up?  Only 2-3k cars for tesla/spacex employees!?
"So for us public folks, I take it there's no chance to get a test drive at a dealership before having to commit?"
I would rather trade the premium upgrades for Enhanced Autopilot.  Gets rather pricey once you add that.
"Descent income and savings. Certainly not the average American. I'm an Aussie and I can only go by what I read in newspapers and television. The average American like the average Australian lives from payday to payday he or she pays rent or a mortgage and a car loan any savings are for insurances.
A Tesla Model 3 is a luxury. I saw a documentary by Michael Moore awhile ago called the last electric car. It was a very nice family car. It was scrapped all of them junked and it wasn't just damaged ones. Every last one of them. They even had guards to make sure they were all accounted for. 
My point is that Americans scrapped the answer to their smog problems, if that car was left alone everyday Americans could afford an electric car. It wouldn't be a luxury it would be the norm. "
"Also CA prior owner, Waited in line overnight at Rocklin, still no email "
I love American humour shows just how little brains they really have. Tsk tsk I never knew my mother but you obviously knew yours.

Lots of great info and demonstration of features here. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcSXxkpk700gDenJHD3HvLw
"Wait this is open to the public? How are they gonna deliver all those in 4 weeks? I thought there was a bottleneck. 

Edit: Ah okay. OPs title is misleading as fuck. It's not open to the public. Just to select preorder reservation holders who aren't employees."
"Huh, I'm in CA and reserved early, no email invite yet."
"Ohhhh, not ""the public"" per se, just people who already have a reservation. That makes more sense."
"As someone who is a non reservation holder living in the southeast us, what is the soonest I could reasonably expect to be able to buy a model 3?"
"Sometimes, when I see all that trouble, I can kinda life with the fact I'm only 17, and too broke to ever be able to afford a Tesla. The again, sometimes, I can't :/"
"I remember in another thread someone stated categorically that no non-employee would get their Tesla before the FM radio is feature is working.     Hmmmm

"
How crowded will the Charging stations be?
All of these people jumping the line by putting in a fake silicon valley address to get priority is pretty pathetic. Hopefully Tesla cracks down on this.
Select driving and auto pilot not included? Ouch
"Dammit. Was hoping my employee reservation (3/17/16) would put me ahead of current owners. Guess not. Should be first in line for general public though, I hope..."
They weren't? 
Went to Tesla.com - 3 configurator is not online.
Aaaaaaaand they're sold out till 2036

Does this mean the production bottleneck has been smoothed out? 
Premium option required for first delivery? Damn. I just want the long range battery. 
I put my down payment like a few weeks before the they showed it. They say I‚Äôm getting mine around April. Is the auto driving worth it? 
is there a reason its been opened? I feel like the supply won't fulfill the demand for a while. Any chance they need deposit money?
is he raising more money?
"Even in the ad, the panels STILL do not line up!"

Just buy an Audi 
I assume the configutor (not a word I guess) is not open to just any public?  Just the ones that get their car first (front of the line).
How were orders working prior to this?
"I reserved mine the first day it was available last year and my delivery time is estimated  mid 2018 for standard battery. I see people here saying they ordered today and are quoted 4 weeks.

My question is:  What the fuck?"

You will never get your car. Tesla is a scam
Delivery promised by 2021!!
Are they still in production hell?
Pieces of junk. Sorry.

"12 - 18 months
As we ramp up production, deliveries for Model 3 reservations placed today are not expected to be delivered until mid 2018.


you guys have full blown downs..."

have to get through all of the current owners first... I'm right there waiting with you. REALLY want to get the car before end of year!
Hey me!
"California, non-owner, online reservation before unveil event; no email or config option."
"Michigan, as well! However, I reserved on 5/29/16 so yours will hit the road much earlier than mine. Hopefully mid-2018 for me!"
I envy you
My buddy is in Chicago and got an email saying between Feb and April ‚Äò18 for delivery. 
"Same boat as you, no invite yet, Colorado, I will certainly be keeping an eye open for it."
"Tesla owner (x2) in California, can't wait to have more people join the Tesla movement!"
"Congrats, make sure to click on that premium features drop down"
Northern or Southern CA?
So the Tesla you purchased later on in the year probably bumped you up in the queue. I was the 9th person in the line at the Stanford Shopping Center location (showed up at ~4am that day) and I still haven't received anything :(

"""**Delivery in 4 weeks**"" ? Wtf???"

Delivery in four weeks was what the configurator stated.
You‚Äôre making the right choice 
NEVER get first production of new tech.  Look at the S
"I just posted in first world problems, but I really want to have your problem...   

Anyways, great news for somebody in support of Teslas survival and the worlds transition to as clean solutions as possible. "
"oh man, i'm thinking of doing that too. i really really want a performance 3. but that could take YEARS, esp if you're waiting on a model from overseas like i am"
"I'm in a similar situation.  There's this p85d for sale that I really want to pull the trigger on but my goal is a performance 3.  

This news has me considering just getting a first production 3 to tide me over.  "
very wise decision 
"Why would you want the first production over the S, unless you can‚Äôt afford the S I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would get the 3. Seems like a rushed unfinished car, at least the S has been put through its paces, personally staying far away from the 3 until it turns into a fully fleshed our Car"
"Didn't stand in line, just ordered online"
"Yayyyy, Palo Alto by chance? Seems like they are sending batch configurations by delivery center (a few other Palo Alto confirmed)"
"It'll be a while from what I understand, California first."
"I stood in line in Colorado to reserve mine. But since I'm not in California and not a current Tesla owner, I don't expect to receive an email until sometime after I see a non-owner in California reserving one. I'd guess I'll see an email perhaps 2-3 weeks after I see the first non-owner order one."
"Ugh. My email has been going off this morning, and I quickly snap over to the app to see what showed up. Then, when disappointed I compulsively check spam too, haha!"

I apologize but what does 'care bear' mean in this context? I tried searching and got no results.
So now he has no reservation AND he probably is still waiting on his refund check.  Ouch.
oopie
"The only upside was that he was a standard config, and these invites wouldn't have changed his timeline much. That said, they would have given him some paws...

Sorry, couldn't resist. "
"Nice find, is it possible to take his place

"Nothing much new, check the photos I posted and let us know if you see anything."
[deleted]
"I hope they can at least tell us new guidance for things like the white interior that were originally forecast to launch this fall. Does it cost more, is it an early Q1 thing, or not scheduled at all, etc.

Tow hook, AWD, and other things I can go without knowing, but I prefer to put money where I spend the most time (inside the car). Hopefully we get our email soon, though it seems like a Jan/Feb delivery is most realistic."
"Westfield Tesla? Elon shook my hand as well! Maybe 200 in line. Non-owner, no email yet..."
Fist bumping Elon should give you priority. Check again
"Let us know when you do! I stood in line in the Bay Area too, albeit a little later in the day than you. I‚Äôm dying to know when this will go to non-owners!"
"Same. I live in AZ (owner, day 1 reservation) so I expect to receive a configure email within a few weeks. I have two reservations so I'm going to give my mom the first slot, but the $7,500 is going to be the decision maker for her on whether or not she gets a 3 or goes with a gently used BMW. I love my S so much I'm not sure I'm ready to part with her yet... so who knows if I'll even keep the other reservation."
Just black atm
"Really interesting that although everyone reports the Model 3 as extremely late, Tesla themselves only said that deliveries would begin at the end of this year. This looks very likely to happen, and if not, not that much after."

What trouble do the aero's spell?
I picked the same - except midnight silver.
"Lmao I can read Chinese so I can‚Äôt relate, but clear your cookies maybe?"
FAFSA happy to help you out w that
A personal thumbs up from Elon Musk -- boom!
"He mentioned on Twitter that he was still working on that, but to be honest I don‚Äôt expect anything huge. If I get my car before the tax credits run out I‚Äôll call it even!"
That's all I got.
I haven‚Äôt received anything
Model S X owners who waited in line would go before you. 
"If you're not an owner, you will receive lower priority in receiving your invite to configure."
"If you reserved online and not at a store, I expect you're a good ways back in the queue.

I have a hunch that the west coast vs east coast thing is overrated in terms of determining priority as well."
You'll be behind in person reservations as well.  They opened online reservations either EOD or the day after in person reservations..
I‚Äôll come find you so you can drive it!
Can I ask why you sold your S? 
"Congrats, MX is my next purchase"
You should update your flair...wear that bad boy loud and proud!
"Yes, I received an invite at 8:43AM today."
Someone else commented saying they received one too. I could really use a sub right now.
My dad got his today.
You‚Äôll get a great deal then!
Lol San Mateo Superchargers and Mountain View RIP
u/Vandelahey
Shrug. Figure out out a way to get there and do it. Go learn autocad and some basic pipe installation and we can hire you on at 80-90k a year starting as a piping modeler because nobody is fucking qualified. 
"Self driving is 3k, requires enhanced autopilot 5k = 8k not 9k. Do you mean the larger battery? That's 9k."
I think its a bigger target than you think. There are plenty of people who can't afford a 90-100k car that would love a 50k car. The market isn't necessarily to people that need to scrape all the way to 35k. 
"I don't think that a lot of people will get FSD, only EAP, which is 5000$. FSD is still a meme at this point and will stay at this state for some time, and when it actually differs from EAP by a significant amount, you can just upgrade for 4000$."
"A matter of time. Day one evening, day one morning, day one very early morning?"
"Thank you, and it was October updated to November"
"Sorry, can‚Äôt go back. I rushed through it and didn‚Äôt see it. No info on range difference on the page."
He is
"Why does Sweden have such poor EV sales?

http://ev-sales.blogspot.co.nz/search/label/Sweden"
"So what you're saying is, if someone were to bring their 3 over to Sweden in a shipping container, you'd want to see it and go for a ride. Not saying that it's a planned event, but it's been discussed (buddy of mine might be moving back to Europe, and if/when he does, he may take his 3)."
"Of course, a lot of employees may want AWD or SR, and are waiting for that."
Really good question. I would think that some not in California have not received it yet.
My brother put in the reservation as an employee 2 weeks ago and got the email a week later so probably.  
Cancel it and wait a few years for the model 3 refresh and AP 3.0.
Cancel.
"I would cancel, you‚Äôre taking a risk by listing it on Turo."
"So far, it appears so."
"The Semi reveal was pushed back so Se√±or Musk, and everyone else I'm sure, could concentrate on the M3 bottleneck. As the reveal started, I was thinking, ""ah, it won't be long now."" I feel like I'm at the top of a rollercoaster. For those of us in a more modest tax bracket, this isn't just being an evangelist, or an early adopter. This is a major life decision. I was torn between hoping it would be even later or on time. Turns out to be on standard Elon time. Edit: somewhere along the way I lost my M3 reservation badge. I'm not in California, but I reserved within the moments before the original Gen 3 presentation."
Not surprised coming from the guy who sent DMCA to people using his photos and drove a Tesla loaner across the country and back.
"There's only one option now, LR, premium upgrades, I chose the sport rims with pearl white."
I'm gonna argue for midnight silver. The blue looks fantastic in direct sun but pretty crummy in anything else.
I feel your pain but I'm going blue. Midnight silver looks nice but in reality its actually a pretty boring color.
Blue. Trust me.
"They'd let people pass you by that were ordering the available trim, but keep you close to the front of the queue for the $35k version...whenever it drops."
You should wait for the car you really want. 
"No news, but expect the demand for test drives to be ridiculously high, to where you couldn‚Äôt just walk into a store. You‚Äôll probably receive an invite to test drive. I am planning on driving across the county again to give test drives to those not in CA!"
Local Tesla store for me said q1 next year they would contact reservation holders in their area to schedule test drives. 
"Although I understand your sadness, Tesla needs to streamline the first production line as much as possible, and that means reducing options significantly. All the cars rolling off the line will be the same except colour and wheels. Software is easy. Also, white interior doesn‚Äôt hold up well in MS and MX."
"I share the sadness. Although, to streamline production, this might be the right move. I'd love to see my Model-3 with a white interior. Having said that, can't wait for even a day longer after I get the configurator email. 

I'm still hoping that the white interior option will open up by the time the non-tesla-owner crowds start placing their orders. "
"No can be added later, but 1000 extra per thing after delivery"
Lol I think it‚Äôs like waiting for an unreliable friend to pay back a small loan. You can‚Äôt expect too much.
The token was that photo of a model three printed on poster card stock in a cheap tesla folder people got in the mail 
"Congrats, @jake_roper!

I live in Anaheim and waited in line in the morning of 3/31 at the Santa Monica Store. I'm not a Tesla owner, so I'm assuming I will likely get my invite in the coming weeks."
Not a joke whatsoever.
wh... why would you be shaking?
It's not a joke.
Lonnnggggggggg time from now.
"Make that reservation now.   It may be a couple years, but it's only $1,000 to reserve and fully refundable at any time."

Yes I didn‚Äôt screenshot that page due to confidential information but trade in is available.
Don‚Äôt want the white myself
I think white interior is coming in the later models 
Probably should get a CPO MS IMO
"31 March, don‚Äôt hold your breath it may be a while."
"Through JPM, 1.99% 6 years"
No lease available afaik
No leasing options currently.
"If you were a current owner I think you would have received it already.

Edit: based on time of reservation in California"
"No cold weather package.  Base model has front heated seats, premium package adds rear heated seats."
"I mean, at least for the current speed at which the line is moving I guess? They'll want to keep accelerating the pace though, so we can't really tell."
Not necessarily. Just means that they anticipate it to no longer be an issue large enough to justify pushing back delivery dates.
I don't think we'll know for sure but its definitely a good sign
"Baby steps, my friend."

Used LEAF is a great alternative.

the 0.99% was because Tesla was subsidizing the rates. THere's no need for them to do that with the 3. 
California first
"No, not at the moment"
Not sure if serious or not
That calls for an advanced mathematical computation. Unclear.
GM did the same thing with the Bolt.  Sold ~500 cars in the second half of December 2016.  
Maybe - but it‚Äôs a valid move 
"No. If they were going to bump some non-employees up the schedule it'd probably be to quash the daily stories about how Model 3 production is ""bogged down"", ""mirred in"", and  ""plauged by"" bottlenecks.

Their current problem is reassuring reservation holders and investors, not generating more demand. In fact it would almost be better to win 2019 car of the year to generate demand once the bulk of reservations have been fulfilled."
the bolt won...
"Do you want an honorary degree for your ‚Äúresearch‚Äù? Maybe a medal? Considering Tesla has confirmed to press that the configuration has opened, was all this ‚Äúresearch‚Äù necessary to attempt to disprove the facts?"
Can‚Äôt we just be happy for him instead of trying to launch a personal attack on his credibility?
It's not just OP that's reporting an invite:  https://electrek.co/2017/11/21/tesla-model-3-order-regular-reservation-holders/
Multiple. I appear to be the first to post about it. Others are posting on other forums as well.
"I reserved VERY early on 31 March, and I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôm the first person (if not, first 100) to reserve in California due to the time at which I reserved."
"Yeah. I'm looking at 60k for a mine. I need autopilot though.. Only reason I'm getting the car.

Insane. 

Hope to God I at least break even on my i3"
"They were slowed down because suppliers didn't get parts to them on time (which isn't an excuse for Tesla, but that's the reason they gave). These orders still won't get delivered for quite awhile, but I guess Tesla is now a little more confident in their timelines (hopefully)."

I would if it was an option. r/churning
Would be awesome if you could
Probably not
Keep waiting
"I‚Äôm confident I can get this financed at 1.99, if not 1.49 over 6 years. Last time I got that rate was from JPM."
"I wonder how much that depends on location.  Most of the rates I see for a 5 year auto loan after a quick search are around 3%, with 2.74% pretty much being as low as I see."
"The screenshot with the link is on my iMac at home, I‚Äôm on a flight right now so can‚Äôt get it. Maybe entering the link will allow early access. Surely the email couldn‚Äôt be sent EXACTLY at the moment of configuration unlock."
Do you currently own a Tesla?  Current owners first
No word on the cost for the D at the moment
Elon tweeted a while back that the cost of dual motor would be less than the $5k cost on Model S.  So $4k perhaps?

I don‚Äôt know if multiple helps anymore than one
"2500, yes"
$2500. And yes you can.
"Not really. Lower margins means more exposure if they hand out these generous warranties. Doesn't mean they don't stand behind the quality, Toyota and Honda have similar warranties. "
If they get it before the end of the year...assuming GOP passes their tax plan.

"Just means that they‚Äôre ready for general production, doesn‚Äôt mean that all employees have received their cars. There are also plenty of employees waiting for the AWD or 35k car."
Only 2k-3k who weren't willing to wait on AWD or shorter range versions
"I'd start checking Turo in a few weeks. I got a test drive from an employee-owner in the Bay area who had 6 total on order to build out his Turo rental fleet as soon as the car was ""released"" to the public. Sounds like 4 weeks from now, there should be no restrictions on renting them out."
You got that right. Not in the near future. Maybe beg an existing employee for one?
"It is regrettably pricey, wish it was different as the premium upgrades are nice."
To the select few of the public who are in CA and who are already Tesla owners and who have an early spot on the pre-order list. Not public-public yet. Those are gonna take a good number of months. Gotta clear all the backlog first.
People being invited will supposedly get it in 4 weeks. Not everyone. 
"If you're not an owner, then there are likely a few thousand S/X owners (who have reserved a model 3) in California who are ahead of you in the priority."
Sorry if that wasn‚Äôt clear
"No one knows, but I would be surprised if you could get one by the end of 2018."
"I reserved mine incredibly late (back in May of this year), live in Texas, and am not a previous owner. My estimated delivery is May - July 2018. So, I think at the most optimistic, it would be late 2018 but more than likely early 2019."
"Depends if you have deep pockets and will buy third party, and just want to order one from Tesla.  Former means soon, and latter means probably 2019."
"You're 17 now, and broke.

But you'll get older, preferably learn more skills and acquire a higher paying job. And by then, EVs and Teslas will be more prevalent and more attainable.

"They have 4 weeks to enable the FM radio.  It would probably take a day to get that added if it was a priority, wouldn't you think?"
Crowded. Tragedy of the commons from an economics standpoint.
"No line at the outlet in your garage, however"
Doesn't work that way - is there some evidence of this?
Pathetic is a strong word. I think Tesla would obviously require that people with a CA address register it in CA and take delivery in CA.
That has always been known...
That's not news.
Employees were already invited to configure. Did you not put an order in?
Nope.
"Yeah, more accurately, select non-employees are getting emails."

"In fact they aren't.  In March of last year at the unveiling Tesla said deliveries would begin in late 2017 and the first delivery estimates to non-employees stated ""Oct-Dec"", which is seemingly being met with the 4 week delivery window for yesterday's orders. Right on the money for such a complex product launch."

"The battery range is a little low but checking out the [supercharger map](https://www.teslarati.com/map/), it actually seems pretty good. Still outside my price range but it's cool to see a realistic option in the next 5-10 years."

The back seats are heated?"
The way they itemise the price is super confusing. So is the final total including the -$1000 or is it including the $1000 you pay? Why did they include the negative sign if it's being added at the end? Fuck I'm confusing myself.

"I am a california owner, reserved in early April of this year and have not yet gotten the email"
Was there a Lease option as well? My local Tesla store told me that Tesla may not offer lease options for Model 3 and that the finance interest rates would be higher than the Model S (@2.74% or so rather than 1.49%)

Sorry bud but it ain't going to happen. His page says it won't deliver for four weeks. He as an owner is barely maybe going to get it before the end of the year.

"Yes, was right on time"
"That's a reservation, not an order."
"They are already making these cars. There are no options choices for the initial production other than color, wheels and software."
"That means they have fixed the bottleneck or partially

edit: not up to speed they wanted, but able to support CA delivery"
Most of the pre-orders were probably for the base model so since that line isn‚Äôt going yet it makes sense. 
"Converting from Elon time, that probably means 8-10 weeks."
"4 weeks isnt to bad for a custom ordered car, i waited 2 months for my f250"

"If I was going to option a TM3 up to $61K I'd go with the $70K TMS. Also interesting, once dual drive and ludicrous come out we're probably looking at TM3s that option above $75K."
"The option prices are proportional to the speed of the car. Tesla doesn't make slow cars, so all options add a lot of cost :P

If an option directly adds more speed, it will be even more expensive."
You must be new here.  Tesla can do no wrong and anyone who complains is automatically assumed to be a short seller.  /s.
"Fred probably put up that article after reading it here, meaning we have completed a perfectly circular loop of evidentiary support! ;-)"
That's great! What color/wheels you getting? Looking forward to pics.
Before the tax credit ends?
Ya cause he might actually get a car that exists 
"I can put up with some of the hassles that come with a first production car when it means getting a $7,500 tax credit that won't be there if I wait a year, though."
So true. Recent Model S and Model X units are supposedly very reliable and have helped Tesla improve their Consumer Reports ratings. 
You shouldn't even get the first model year of an established automaker like Toyota. The Model 3 is being built by a company with a history of problematic product releases who is using a technique *they've never used before* to build it.
"That advice is a good way to stop any product sales of anything, ever, were everyone to follow it."
"I love how further up, some guy is getting the third Tesla for his driveway, and you've all verbally fellated him.

I'm getting one and trading it in next year, and I'm an asshole."
"It's not as First World as you'd think.

I made the move to the S because my trade-in was only going to get worse. I figured if I was possibly (ok, almost entirely likely) sacrificing the tax credit, I should protect my investment on one end.

So a Model S with AP1 will hold its value better over the next year than my current car will.


But I AM trading the S in for a Performance 3. It's not like I'm going to have 2 Teslas in my driveway."
Ah. I have a pre-reveal in-store reservation. My current estimated delivery for Dual Motors is Aug-Oct 2018.
"I can afford CPO S. AP HW1. Once you start getting into HW2 cars, the chances of me affording one (without a car note) almost disappear. But by getting rid of my ICE whose value will only further depreciate, I'll be able to afford a maxed-out Model 3 Performance AWD this time next year."
"Owner, stood in line at 5am and I didn‚Äôt get anything yet. "
"I wonder if people stood in line get s slight priority over yourself, minus I doubt anyone would to get it a few day early when they already own a Tesla. "
East Bay actually. I was around 60th in line. My email to configure didn't show up until about 30 minutes ago. It wasn't one of the early morning emails.
"I was a Palo Alto day-of reservation, too! Hopefully I'll get mine today :)"

People from the Midwest already have a general disdain/misunderstanding of our fruity-ass state. Now we're really rubbing salt in the wound. "
"Based on all the available communication I agree. My delivery estimate is Nov-January (was Oct-Dec before the update, same as all the other day 1 owner reservations) which is driving my finger to the F5 key way too often :)

Super exciting news and thank you for posting!"
"Yikes, logged into my Tesla Account to see there was no location data for me - just name and email address (CA resident, Day 1 reservation online, not a previous Tesla Owner). 

Hope I don‚Äôt get skipped over because of that. "
"Probably more than 2-3 weeks, but that‚Äôs my opinion"
"The person has cancelled their order because they didn't think Tesla would deliver and posted about it to make sure everyone knew they were cancelling and it was all Teslas fault. They put their ""feelings"" on show to the internet in the hope of ""me too"" or some kind of sympathy. Hence care bear named after the 80's toys who had their heart on show and focused on being good and loving others. Even though they could basically shoot lasers out their chest."
Are you asking if you can skip the rest of the line and jump in to his spot? 
"no, reservations are non transferable"
You sure it wasn't PUP optional for Long Range battery? Standard battery is still 'coming soon'.
"I agree- I REALLY want the white interior. I have an ‚Äúearly 18‚Äù delivery window, so I‚Äôm hoping we know something before I get my configuration invite! I‚Äôm sure if I go ahead and order without it, they‚Äôll release it as soon as my car is delivered."

There are also plenty of people who can afford a $100k car but are smart enough not to spend that much money on a depreciating asset.
Day 1 early afternoon. Nothing
NOOOOOOoooOOooOooOo!!!! :( I MUST know what are all the premium upgrades!
"Ohh- bummer. I mean, good for him!! But, still haven't reached the plebes yet... lol."
"My personal opinion is that Sweden lacks EV cars that can do more than just take you to and from work. 

Either you're buying a Nissan Leaf with limited range, or you have to pay much more money for a Tesla. More than most people here feel comfortable paying for a car. 

So if you don't have the money for a Tesla, but still don't want to give up the range or space of a compact SUV or station wagon (remember, station wagons are really popular in Sweden thanks to Volvo). You're left with the option for Plug-In Hybrids. Which are cheaper up front and you still save money on gas. A lot of people can also drive to and from work on just the small range a hybrid gives them. They just don't want to give up the luxury of being able to go further. 

Another factor is that previously owned cars drop in value here rapidly. I'm always baffled when I watch TV shows from the US over the prices on second hand cars. If you can stand having a car from the 90's you can probably get a good working car for about 7-800$. 

This means that a lot of people isn't even buying new cars to begin with here. 

Of course this is my personal opinion. I'am currently waiting for a EV station wagon car with a range greater than 400 km. That's what I would want. No such car on the market right now though. "
Hell yes I would! I would go for a ride in a Model S or X too and I have driven the Model S. =P 
Perhaps they have and are just waiting for the 35k version
Does it have an actual delivery estimate window?
Was it an option to uncheck the premium upgrades?
This. A thousand times this. 
"Hey, so you are spending all that money on a car that you have not driven yet? What if you don't like it? 

Congrats btw :) "

Oh wonderful! This morning is feeling like freaking Christmas!
Sweet! Thanks for the reply. 
How does that work out. Did you go to JPM on your own or were there options given by Tesla?
"Thanks, in the screen shots it shows 2.74 and I thought that wasn't that great."
"JPM Chase is showing 3.04% how did you get 1.99
"
"You can lease the Model S & X so I assumed you'd have the same option with the 3. According to someone on the [official Tesla forums](https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/lease-model-3) from earlier this year: ""I spoke to a rep about this today and he laid out the pros & cons of both with purchasing being the better option. The purchasing/leasing details would be available on your online account page closer to the delivery date.""

I'm hoping that leasing will be available, as that may be a better solution for me and would allow easier upgrading in the future as Tesla continues to innovate."
"Interesting. I wonder if that will be changing and if so, when? My current estimate is mid-2018."
"Negative. One of my friends (here in bay area) was a line waiter, owner at the time (and now), has not received invite. "
Indeed they did. Though to be fair that was their stated plan all along. 
Agreed. Movie studios do this all the time where a movie will be shown in a handful of theaters at the end of a year to qualify for the oscars but then have its nationwide debut a few months later. 
"You're interesting, youyouxue."
Not in 2017. All I see on the internet now is attacks.
How did you do it? Did your location open before all the others or something?
"Shit, at that point might as well get an S lol"
"I do not understand the hostile and quite frankly incorrect ""no"". A quick google shows many articles stating production is upwards of 70% less then projected per month. I wasn't attacking Tesla, just questioning the past."
I wonder how many other people have r/teslamotors and /r/churning as two of their top subs...
"I'm sure some people have that kind of credit card limit... I know one person who does... (maybe not to that much but at least $40k)  
I wonder if this counts as ""online purchase"" LOL?  The Uber card has 2% back... 2% x $56,500 = $1,130 back.."
"I will. 
I want the performance package and AWD. So I‚Äôm waiting even longer. Maybe by then I‚Äôll just get an S..."
"Impressive. Let me know how that goes, if you would.   I've been assuming a 3.5-ish rate to be conservative. "
"That's the hope...at the very least, if it's tied in with your reservation number, then we can sub the RN# and then refresh like mad on a daily basis until it does become active. But that's a lot of assumptions, so it may not be so simple."
Oh nice. Thanks. 
It should (my opinion)
4 year 50k beats Honda and Toyota which I believe are 3 yr 36k
Damn. Need my invite!
"Ah, right. Yes, I am not a current owner."
"Wow, I reserved mine 4/4/16, not a previous owner, and I'm in Iowa. My estimate is Mar-May 2018.  Over a year before you and still only a few months apart.  That's fair ;)"
The only tax people volunteer to pay....
"That's what I would think but if it were that easy why didn't they do it already rather than releasing cars to employees with it missing?   

They had to know that these basic missing features would leak even with the soft NDAs."

really?? isn't that a couple thousand cars? did they resolve the bottleneck?
The bottom character line where the end of the front door and front of the rear door meet is off. This is a photoshopped image.
"Any Audi is nicer than a tesla. For cars that are so expensive, teslas look so cheap and ugly. "
I am a non-employee.  But a late reservation holder.  So I am guessing I won't see the configuration option for awhile.
"Ahhhh thanks. Truthfully, I was referring to posts from people in the comments but I didn‚Äôt realize that about op. Maybe I‚Äôll get an email"
Lmao this is honestly the hardest part about owning a Tesla
I think they like you :)
Yeah...I have no idea how I got to work this morning!
They can't make money on cars and can't keep up with production. It's failing.

"Yes, when I was TAD out in California, I had the opportunity to drive one.  It's fast and has some gadgets but it had no life, no soul.

"You'll probably get another configuration email when the Standard version releases, and then another when the Dual Motor version releases. You keep your place in line, so employees should get each new version first, then owners, etc."
"Curious too.  Even though my estimate is December I know I'm not getting it until next year, in which case I'd prefer to wait 3-6 months and save some more money.  "
"It‚Äôs $1,000 and it‚Äôs on the last page before you place the order which isn‚Äôt shown here. "
"Buying FSD is dumb.

Everyone should get EAP for $5k and if Tesla ever delivers on FSD, then $4k will seem like a steal. "
"Guess all those ""it's only 35k"" arguments go out the window. Looks more like a 50k car to reach parity with fully loaded 35k other cars."
Yes
"The final total has subtracted the $1000 you already paid.

They show the base price - then they subtract the $1000 you paid, then they add the options you request. Then they give you the total.

Early April is not late March! Hundreds of thousands people between You and the email.
"Didn‚Äôt see a lease option and wouldn‚Äôt think it is available until later, if at all"
Didn‚Äôt see anything like that. Anytime. However if you wait I would imagine that your priority and place in the queue remains the same but you may fall victim to a backlog of orders.
"Autopilot, no self-driving."
Totally understandable 
"Forgive my replying to this old post, but why do you not get the tax credit with awd?"
"Just because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt a nice option. AWD with winter tires is a superior experience. I‚Äôve had a multitude of drivetrains on a multitude of tires and nothing was more fun than my wrx STI with Blizzaks. If I‚Äôm already paying 40k+ for a model 3, I‚Äôm getting awd, especially with the instant torque of electric motors

Also, did you really not see where I suggested purchasing winter tires in the post right below his response?"
Your not wrong about the fact that you can get around alright in the winter. But there is absolutely not a single shadow of a doubt that you can get around significantly better with awd / 4wd. Up here in the northern half of the united states you might as well subtract 10-20% off the book value of your car if you dont get the AWD option if its available. Its hilarious how easily you can spot the 2wd trucks on craigslist because they have been posted up for months and are listed for far too cheap for how nice they are. They still struggle to sell. Same goes for crossovers and SUVs.
People are so obsessed with AWD and I just don't get it. Just like you said there is SO much evidence that you should just have winter tires and RWD on Tesla's is beyond capable of awful winters. I guess once people get an idea in their head they just can't get it out.
"
waiting meaning you might not get the $7500 credit"
"Haste makes waste, but to each their own. Make sure to buy some Blizzaks"
"Nope, just letting the guy I was replying too that I was a day ahead and in CA, and still didn't have it open.  Just my own little data point!"
"That would be Dec 19... IF the ramp shoots up in December, then thousands would deliver in those last two weeks. I'm not an owner, but one of the first in line, so at least I'd be in the first batch of non owners, non employees.

I'm not counting on it, but there's still a slight chance."
Yes. Current owners jumped to the front of the line only behind employees. California of course gets first deliveries in each group. 
I'm planning on it being 2018 (which unfortunately means I have to wait until April/May) but I'm HOPING they get moving quickly and it's this year.
"Very nice! Do you plan to have it delivered or pick it up? At this point, I plan on picking mine up at the showroom in Cleveland. That way, I can get the one-on-one time with an associate and get it all set up the way we want it."

"At the last quarterly report they were still expecting a rate of 1-2k per week at least for December.  Not exactly 5k per week, but still decent."
not necessarily. 
"Maybe. I know employees who have already configured and don‚Äôt expect delivery within 4 weeks. 

I‚Äôm an existing owner in CA who reserved in-store prior to the reveal and don‚Äôt have config access yet. 

I think they‚Äôre just testing the waters. "
"Even so, it doesn't make sense that a brand new customer can order the car and have it delivered in 4 weeks when there are 500,000 people in front of him/her. That's what doesn't make sense to me about the ""delivery in 4 weeks""."
"This is impossible, don't they still have like 400k orders on back order? How could they produce all those vehicles in a month? Last I checked only a few hundred Model 3s have rolled out.

Edit: Ahh apparently these are for people who made reservations and are in front of the line."
"Why would most pre-orders be for the base model? Strikes me as counter intuitive. If you can spend thousands on a car that doesn't exist, why opt for the cheapest one?"
"Yeah, but in which year?"
Oh no! Elon has been infected  by Valve time.
"Well, 4 weeks + however many years ago the initial preorder was placed...

If by late 2018 they can do 4 week turnaround on Model 3 that'll be fantastic."

"Could you click on the dropdown of ""view all premium upgrades""? This would give us ""peasants/standard edition"" folks an understanding of what's exactly included in the base model vs. premium. 

Thanks in advance for sharing!"
"Estimated monthly payment of $762....<sigh>

So much for a more middle class accessible vehicle. Guess I don't need any features other than the bare bones car..."
"Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the upgrades themselves are overly pricey, or not worth the money. 
Just insane how an ""affordable"" 35k car (plus tax) turns into 52k (plus tax) to include features you'd almost be insane not to get.. mostly referring to the extended range of the battery + auto pilot."
[deleted]
"That's not the case for all of us.

I don't like the lack of physical buttons and switches on their models to simple functions.

I don't like some features of the model 3 making it more complicated and pricier.

I don't like how irregular the communication from Tesla is. Today you can feel like part of the company, tomorrow you don't know what the fuck is going on. This week Elon does various updates, next month nothing.

I don't like the way they (Tesla and Elon) don't clarify their statements. I wouldn't mind Elon predictions if his Twitter wasn't so tied up with the company and so, I don't like his ""best case scenario"" predictions without a disclaimer.

I don't like how careless they were when revealing the Roadster. So now there is a shit show going on comparing a Roadster with a Bugatti...

Still, I really like Tesla as a company and the veichels they produce."

Even waiting six months could make a huge difference in the quality of vehicle Tesla puts out there.
"i said tech specifically.  For vehicles, there is a culture where the first production models, even if outdated or problematic, add to the overall value as a collector (depending on astringent circumstances). "
There are always early adopters.  But in general this is sound.
"Oh, you responded here too. All I wanted to say was I wanted to be in your position having to choose between model s and model 3 and to sneak in that I am most of all happy for Tesla and green tech.

"To be fair, even talking about the ability to afford a $17k Civic new is a first world problem. Anything related to owning a Tesla is, without question, a first world problem. "

Plenty of us urban Midwesterners certainly don‚Äôt have a disdain for California. I find the divide on things like green energy/transit have more to do with rural vs. urban than simple geographic location."
"Jeez, add address right away"
"Yeah, it all depends on how quickly they are producing Model 3s by the time the first invitation is sent to a non-Tesla owner. I'm guessing it'll be at least 2-3 weeks until then, so a total of 4-6+ weeks from now before I can hope to get an order invitation.

Of course, it could be significantly longer than that for all I know. IIRC, my order was roughly the 20,000th one (the woman next to me was in contact with her son, a Tesla employee, as we made our reservations--he was keeping her updated with the number of reservations coming in that morning). Within Colorado, it was probably about the 100th reservation so I'm hoping I'm fairly close to the front of the line for a non-Tesla owner."

On the other hand a $45K car (base, PUP, Red, sports wheels, tint etc.) that is as fun/cool as a model 3 - can‚Äôt wait."
Also true. Pretty much I imagine the 9k self driving will be the norm. And if you are that money conscious you are waiting on this car used anyway.

"Auto loan underwriter here. Your lender will give you a rate based on the loan structure and your credit. Tesla will then pay them the difference they would have earned in interest to get your rate down to a 1.99%. 

Normally dealerships make money when people finance a vehicle, but it looks like Tesla is actually losing money to have people finance their vehicles"
Definitely a bad rate but that‚Äôs what Tesla can offer if you go with them

You'll still get your sweet spaceship before me and that makes me envious as hell."
"Ahh. Makes it a bit tougher to own an EV at present, but Tesla is working on building out its city-based charging network to solve this issue, as are other companies."
"Eh, this can't last long. It'll screw with delivery location and they'll start noticing the credit card doesn't match. 

Guy was an idiot."
"Sounds like they did. Employee reservations were estimated to be around 2-3k, but some of those are waiting for the base model or AWD, so maybe 1,500 fulfilled so far. The California exisiting Tesla owners will get their cars in 4 weeks if they ordered today. Hopefully the batches of invites expand on a consistent basis going forward! "

"Funny, that was my exact reaction to your post."
"Sorry dude, but this comment demonstrates you aren't familiar with what is going on. The only non-employees who have ""ordered already"" got their invitations to order yesterday. Delivery is stated for 4 weeks from now. The production delay that Tesla announced amounted to a [one month delay](http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-delays-model-3-deliveries-by-at-least-one-month-2017-11) for most reservation holders. The 3 month delay cited in that article is for when they expect to reach a production level of 5,000 cars per month (previously Dec, now ""late Q1""). All of the reservation holders who had a initial delivery window *estimate* of ""Oct-Dec"" were pushed back to ""Nov-Jan"" and are now getting invitations to order for delivery in December. My own estimate went from Nov-Jan to Dec-Feb. Shareholder lawsuits are a dime a dozen, rarely succeed, and this one won't amount to anything.  

I have no idea what this even means: ""did they comprehend that their place in line, DOESN'T MATTER, since you know, they didn't get shit, why would anyone trust Tesla now?""  As stated above, the people who ""ordered already"" (i.e. yesterday) are expected to get their cars within the delivery estimate originally provided by Tesla (i.e. by Dec). The next batch of people to order will likely get them within the revised 1-month later window in January.  

No one else, other than people who ordered yesterday, have given Tesla anything other than a $1,000 *fully refundable* deposit to secure their place in line. If someone were to place a new reservation today (again, a $1k fully refundable reservation), then they are expected to get their car at the end of 2018 after the other 500k+ reservations are converted to orders and filled. I don't recall Saturn or Oldsmobile having lines of 500k people clamoring for their products. Perhaps you should read up on [why Saturn was killed off though](https://www.forbes.com/2010/03/08/saturn-gm-innovation-leadership-managing-failure.html#6b8483636ee3)."

Why should everyone get EAP for $5k? Is it a necessity? I already placed my order and wondering if I should add that in as well‚Ä¶
"What vehicle with which options is $35,000 and matches or reaches parity with the Model 3 at $50,000?"
"The base Model 3 is realistically a $20k car with a $15k battery. That‚Äôs the price you pay for emerging tech though. Still impressive how much ‚ÄúTesla‚Äù you get for half the price of a Model S. If you‚Äôre dead set on going electric, it‚Äôs still the best deal in town IMO. After driving a Model S a few years ago, it ruined gas powered cars for me and it‚Äôs not an option I would ever consider again. "
"So why do they say ""including your deposit"" at the bottom. That's what makes it suddenly confusing. Surely it should read $47,000 + $1000 reservation."

Lol... please provide this evidence, because it isn't true.  Yes you should have winter tires in winter areas.  Always.  But yes, AWD with winter tires is much better than RWD.  
  
Clearly you're a city kid."
You clearly haven't experienced a proper winter then. Snow tires and 2wd do alright but AWD is significantly better. Hence why it exists and why people want it. Noone likes it when you pull up to a stop sign and accidentally place both drive wheels on a patch of ice. If your on any kind of hill there is a real chance that you will not be able to move forward. You will have to back up off the ice and then go again. Happens every year in my truck. Thankfully I have 4wd so I just pull back on the lever to engage it. Finish taking off and then I usually pop it back into 2wd.

"What?

Orders are when you actually pay them the non-refundable and they begin production. Those are cited as 4 weeks.

Reservations are $1000 refundable that gives you a place in line. They estimate you'll be in that line 12 to 18 months. "
"With hundreds of thousands of pre orders that would make them 3-6 years behind, assuming no improvement "
"These are people who are at the front of the line, newly invited to configure.  Not people who are reserving today."
??  They're not a brand new customer.  They're from CA and among first pre-orders from what I understand.
"A lot of people are going to stretch to get to the base model already.

Something along the line of: middle class person, in the 30s, excited by tesla cars for a bit now, but model S completely unreasonnable even in the future. Need to think about next car, most likely option would be an A3 or a similar car (in term of price range and whatever). Now you see the model 3, and between the excitement of it, the savings on fuel, the impact on the environment: you decide you're going to do your best and reach for that car instead. Instead of 25k you are looking at 35 to 40k, but that will be reduced over time by savings. However, trying to go for a 50k car is just not realistic.

That may sound specific but this is going to encompass a lot of people that preordered. It is, truly, the first electric car available to the middle class that can be used as a main car. It's going to attract a LOT of people that will likely never buy a 50k car in their lifetime and would have doubtfully bought one at 35k in the first place, if it wasn't for the Tesla brand + electric savings."

I mean the base is still $35k. Idk what you expected 
"That isn't really a fair statement at all.

I mean, that is the payment per month including like $20,000 in upgrades (which add an additional 60% to the price). And not counting the tax rebate or the gas savings."
"Oh, I agree. Just making light of the maths.

I was seriously hoping the options for the 3 would be cheaper than the S, so was a little surprised at the reveal. The battery seems to be a pretty good deal though."
"Well they're definitely not upgrades that are even close to standard in the industry. Considering what you get, those prices are practically cheap. A car with a 350 mile range, and auto pilot that does 0 to 60 in under 5? Yeah I wouldn't have imagined paying under 6 figures for that. "

"Guys, I think you misconstrued what I said, but a few of you were douchey about it, so I ran with it.

I was actually just trying to point out that I can't afford 2 Teslas. Someone got their panties twisted, so I had some fun with it.

6 years ago, I didn't even have a car. I get it.

How does Tesla determine your location?
"Yeah, about 10-15 mins from the factory. "
I would want to see the time stamped email. The configuration screen shots have been known already. 
About 12 hours before the online orders were available. I want to know how they are picking who gets to configure. 
Same 4 week time frame
Even rural California is not like urban California
I'll take that. 
I did. And called. Was told they had my information on the system internally and she saw my updates on MyTesla. Should be good. Fingers crossed. 
"Do you remember what time of day that was? I was about 350th in line at the Scottsdale, AZ location, and placed my order around 12:30pm AZ time (11:30am PST)."
We missed you.
"Meh, I have hubcaps on my current car and have never had them stolen."
"Since about half the sub thinks they're hideous, im guessing stealing them would be unlikely. I would think people are more likely to get the wheels stolen in general (sport or aero)."
"Well the only market for them would be folks who own Model 3's...and those folks would already have the Aero caps so I doubt there'll be a big black market.  And they're hideous so nobody will steal them as a trophy.

I doubt these will be useful to steal."

"The only normal bias I encounter is that EV's have too short range. Like I said before, most people would easily be fine with a car like Nissan Leaf but they don't like to give up the freedom of being able to drive far if they want to. 

There are subsidies for green cars, it's called super environment premium. However it applies to hybrids as well. Which I guess make the hybrid a even better choice.  "
Aww okay thanks. Looks like I might have to wait longer then :')

"That would be stupid. Of course it's possible they go under. The question you should be asking is if I think it is likely that they go under. To which my answer would be no, I don't think it is likely. I said that to make the poster above be aware that if they do go under, he will not be able to recoup his $1,000 reservation fee. "

Actually now that I think of it - I think it's possible to call your CC company and ask them for a temporary increase  for big purchases (such as buying a car).  I think my friend did that once successfully... 5% off $56k is quite a bit of rebate.
I agree but it'd be stupidly dumb to charge all to credit card without the $$ to pay it back in full.
Interest could be promotional at 0% for 12 mos. Definitely worth it if you‚Äôre earning cc rewards.
will do! 
yea i started combing through the subreddit and saw that they have been registering a bunch of vins so seems like they are ramping up. Very cool 
Wow you Tesla FANS are truly a different breed of ignorant. That is a real car pictured and photoshopped over. Just because it's a Tesla and it's a new hyped up model doesn't mean it's fit and finish is going to be perfect. None of the previous ones were perfect. That being said BMW doesn't even make perfect fitting panels but they get down to the tenths of a mm so nobody notices. Tesla is fine with half cm gap differences all around the car.
"To each their own indeed. Tesla just doesn't do it for me, they look amateurish. I feel like the big German car companies are going to crush tesla, in Europe anyway. The Audi, BMW and Mercedes badges mean a lot. "

As far as studless goes I have yet to find ones I prefer to the WS series. I‚Äôve tried the x ices and the pirelli‚Äôs. Where I live you definitely need to run studless. What do you like better than Blizzaks?
"""awd only helps me go faster"" is so wrong though. I can go 100mph on icy roads in a 2wd just as easy as I could in an AWD. The actual difference is you can get moving and keep moving far better than any 2wd. Unfortunately that gives some people too much confidence. Try crossing a busy intersection and having your car lose traction in the middle of the intersection basically leaving you stranded with cars going 45mph directly at your driver's side door. Drivers who are also driving on ice and may not be able to stop. One time is all it takes and you'll want awd. Or try getting to work with 8"" of powder on the ground. No way your getting there in a 2wd car. You'll be stuck."
I like the dig at the end. It made you seem cool and intelligent.
"Of course there are circumstances and awful awful winters where AWD would make much more sense. My comment is more on how people that live in totally mild conditions often go for AWD because they think they need it when it is just silly. I know someone that just bought an AWD car in southern california (not a Tesla)... What the hell is the function of that feature here? She literally had it shipped from like Missouri because they don't sell AWD versions here.

Not everyone is silly for wanting AWD, it was a generalization, but MANY people don't live in conditions that even remotely require it but still think they ""need"" it."

"> assuming no improvement

Well they are guiding for 5k/week for end of 1st quarter 2018 and then 10k/week later in the year.  So nobody is expecting them to stay at that rate."
And probably 2-5 years if the current pace of improvement holds.
"Ohhhhhh. My mistake. I thought ""opened to the public"" meant these are new people configuring. I thought that people would configure their cars when they made their reservations. Now I get it. Thank you."
Yes! Now I understand. Sorry and thank you.
It‚Äôs a problem with people in tech. Not only developers though. Developers tend to think their solutions are the only thing that matters. Designers thing a good design and experience is the only thing that matters. Sales people think marketing is the only thing that matters. 
"Don't worry, imgur is going to shit now with auto redirects to ads and all kinds of bullshit and soon they will disable direct linking to files entirely."
Ford 350 and Chevy trucks get up to$50000 as well.
"I bet they'll get cheaper, or at least include more stuff at the same price point, once they work through the huge demand backlog. Tesla probably feels like they need to maximize margins as long as they have this long queue of people willing to pay."
"I mean, is there even a standard for autopilot and extended range on an all electric vehicle? I feel like Tesla IS the standard for a lot of the features they are offering here. 

Again I am not saying the price of the upgrades aren't worth it, but for a vehicle that is advertised and hyped up to be a lot more affordable for the average consumer, can quickly become beyond reach for many when adding in features that to me seem like a must."
It still costs 5k thought right? That‚Äôs really high and hard to justify for someone already stretching on a 35k car
Like features that don't even exist yet for a mere $5000 or whatever it is.  Or half the features of an economy car at 3 times the price with fit and finish problems thrown in as a bonus.

That puts you ahead of all the non-owners but behind all the owners I saw waiting in line with me.

"That's not an order, that's a reservation.

Those aren't the same thing.

I'm not upset, just attempting to clarify your admitted ignorance of the subject."
"Cool. No one is claiming Tesla is known for good fit and finish. I'm only going by what reviewers at [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/07/29/usa-today-first-drive-tesla-model-3/522198001/), Jalopnik, and early employee owners have reported about the Model 3s they've driven.
 > The fit and finish of this Model 3, which was among a few dozen handed over to employees at a ceremony Friday led by CEO Elon Musk, was tight. Panel gaps were perfect. Doors open and closed with a solid thunk. Now, Musk just needs to, as promised, make 499,999 more a year to the same standards.  

I will certainly be inspecting mine with a fine tooth comb when I take delivery. I fully expect there will be some panel gap issues within tolerances.  
"
"> Tesla just doesn't do it for me, they look amateurish.

That's because they are. :D They're newcomers and their interiors still lack a lot of functional features. That's utility, not look though, and they also beat oldies in utility in other departments -- going as much into the digital as they do. Navs in other cars are flat out horrible.

> I feel like the big German car companies are going to crush tesla

I'm German and I still want to give them so much shit for being late to the game. They're only slowly starting to wake up. Good on Daimler for investing in Tesla early on but my god they could've done so much more. Instead, they lobby our government and come out with Dieselgate. What the heck. Shame, shame, shame.  
As always, Germans are excruciatingly conservative when it comes to technology. "

When the vehicle was revealed on March 31, 2016, they stated deliveries would begin in [late 2017](https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/1/11343874/tesla-model-3-announced-video). So despite all the noise from the trolls (like yourself?) Tesla is doing exactly what they said.  

I'm not sure what you think they are faking. The company delivered a record number of their existing cars last quarter."
"I feel like I'm watching a commercial. Ultimate Driving Machine... can't roll my eyes hard enough.

I work in UX. Can confirm 
"As a designer/developer mobile is hard because you always work at a laptop or desktop, so any time you have an awesome spur-of-the-moment idea, you build it for desktop and then add a note on your task board to implement mobile later. 

If there was a good way to develop sites directly on a phone, I know my mobile experience would be 100x better. Emulators help, pushing changes to your phone is great but takes a long time, and it‚Äôs just too easy to fall in to the trap of viewing responsive sites mostly at max width. 

Good work is slow because every piece of the puzzle has to fit with every scenario for user experience across marketing materials, web presence at all resolutions, and application experience... most people want to just specialize and make their piece cool because it‚Äôs easier and more instantly gratifying. "
I was very unhappy when they were trying to force their app.
Absolutely. All I can do is sit here and be envious of everyone that can currently afford these price points!
"It does cost $5k.

I actually suspect many people will spring for it. For the level of convenience it offers - assuming you'll use it, such as a commuter, it comes off as a deal.

I agree it'll be a stretch for some, but I think the target market is mostly on board with the spend."
"Especially considering that in the past year, Honda and Toyota now include ACC and lane keeping at no cost in all their new cars. If there's any reason that might keep me from pulling the trigger on the TM3 it's that I have to pay $5K for ACC + lane keeping when a $25K accord has that feature included."

"It's good you know what I'm talking about. This is the only issue I see with Tesla cars. By the way since these cars need to be sold, maybe said company knew which cars to hand out for press cars and testing cars... it's a simple company procedure to hand over the best product examples for review, you wouldn't want people finding panel problems and have to release a ""trust me the other 500k cars will be built tighter and line up right, trust me"" speech. But who knows. I'm genuinely optimistic the interior build quality is at least Modern VW good."
"True, the big companies will dominate with brand recognition, design and ability to mass produce, once they take electric seriously that is. "
What functional features does the Model 3 lack? 
i understand. wit isnt exactly your forte. we can still be friends
"are you saying the model 3 doesn't exist?

I just don't see how someone could argue on the side of pre-orders, especially nowadays.

I'm not saying the car is trash, I'm just saying, people get mad about shitty video games, and at least they got them."
"That's because you dont like cars.  I never mentioned features so I'm not sure how any of the features could be degrading. 

"
You're correct.  The M2 is about as close as you're going to get to the old days. 
"True, but adding it to financing the vehicle now would end up making it roughly the same cost if you were to buy it outright later."
"Weren't there some price changes on Model S upgrades and autopilot since initial launch, and I think it's been a decrease, so there's also a slight chance the price goes down, therefore buying it early becomes even worse."
"It will drove across the country for you, in theory"

Currently wondering when I‚Äôll get my invite. Guessing second week of feb for late April delivery.  "
"I never said that, I just said that they plan on ramping up from that production rate.

Also, to be fair, initially the model 3 production rate of 500k per year was aimed for 2020.  Now they are aiming to get there in 2018-19.  So setbacks are expected, but they are still ahead of their initial guidance.

They also did hit their initial start of production deadline."
"Yeah, one of the biggest negatives I've heard and agree with is that they need to be way more realistic about production estimates. They claim huge numbers up front then just excuse excuse excuse as they don't meet the numbers month after month. I love the technology but they just can't produce on the scale they claim."
"Agreed. It should have been something like ""Day 1 Model 3 reservations - deliveries are 4 weeks out!"" As it is now, there's nothing in the title that says this is ONLY for people who reserved on day 1."
"Yes - and a less obvious plot point - Dang (the guy who designs the box) tries to get Richard, an engineer, to give input on the aesthetics of the system. Richard, annoyed, tells Dang to fuck off and just make a box. Later, we find out Richard and the other engineers do actually care about how it looks but doesn‚Äôt at the same time. "

"Personally I would 100% get the EAP, I commute way too far in bad traffic to not get that feature. I agree the FSD does seem almost pointless to get at the moment since it currently wouldn't have any use. Especially if this an upgrade you can add in at a later date for around the same cost."

"I'm not mistaken.

You said people ordered cars a year ago and they haven't gotten them. Orders weren't taken till July 2017. 

You think a reservation is the same - which it is not. The reservation purchased you a spot in line once orders were open for taking. 

If the cars were immediately for sale at reservation and then fell behind, you'd have a point, but they weren't. Everyone was told there would be a long wait before production began.

I hope you're more informed now. Your ignorance blinded you to the facts and rather than listening and learning, you chose to dig in further and look foolish. 

"
"Agree and really hope so. I'm not excited about the idea of buying a first generation vehicle from a new-ish car company, but I am excited about the car itself (having test driven one). The plan was for the tax credit to make any initial quality issues more palatable. Hopefully that doesn't go away with the tax bill."
"That's what everyone is hoping, including Musk, who recognized full well that there's no way in hell a single company ‚Äì and especially not a tiny new one ‚Äì can convert the car market to electric by itself.  
They are already 'beating' Tesla sales in low-cost models, but that's because they started at opposite ends. We'll see how it goes. Even if Tesla car sales can't penetrate further it'll still be mission accomplished."
I don't know. Haven't seen it since it's so new.
Pass - I generally stick to people who can legally grab a drink.
"I agree that pre-orders/reservations are unfortunate, but in the case of an expensive product with limited initial supply and large demand, I don't know how else a company establishes a queue? Boeing and Airbus effectively have to do the same thing for new planes that have 5-7 years of orders. For my wife's new iPhone, we paid for it a month ago and it will arrive sometime in December. At least with Tesla (as compared to video games), you aren't giving up anything to be in line other than $10 of interest on your refundable deposit. I think with other in-demand cars, the reservation system takes place at the local dealer level, but Tesla doesn't have dealerships. It's not a perfect system, but given the alternatives, I'm fine with it. "
"I don't like cars? That's a bizarre thing to say. 

There's some basics of ICE vehicles that I find pretty pathetic having made the switch. It's a lifestyle change, in effect. 

Plus the Jeeps are pretty trash in general. BMWs are ok, but that you're using their corporate tagline as justification is downright laughable and sad."
You would have to have a really bad auto loan rate to make it roughly the same cost.   
I believe that was only for the cost of software unlocking a Model S 60 to 75. IIRC it went from $5k to $2k.
"Hey it's me, your unborn child. Goo Goo GA GA!"

"Yeah, I was basically trying to say I got my order in before you so I'm curious as to how they are parsing these orders and deciding who gets the invites to configure."
"Fully agreed! Just trying to make people aware of it. I wasn't aware of it until recently. I'm not putting a deposit down or anything as I'm not in the market for a car, but it is good to know about."
It's not me handing out the downvotes.  I'm just disagreeing with them that the tone of their original response is likely to be interpreted as they think Tesla is likely to go under.  I certainly read it that way and that's why I suggested that if they believe that Tesla will go under than it would be wise to short the stock.   Later they clarified they don't believe it likely.  
"Have you still not reviewed my link? The CEO of Tesla used the term ""order"" for model 3s in 2016. Where people put down money on a *pre-order*. My terminology is correct and my facts are correct. Sure I look foolish, because I am arguing online, but I am not wrong. This is such a weird and petty thing for you to fight when its easily googled."
"Fair enough. From my understanding and brief test drive, they've addressed many of the small things missing in the original Model S that people generally want in their cars , like door pockets, coat hooks, more cup holders, etc. Added rear USB charging and rear climate. My only missing feature at present is sunglasses holder. "
damn they raise the age to 30? guess im screwed. pretty low effort man. 
"Jeep Wranglers are trash...lol.  I'm sure they will last a hell of a lot longer than any Tesla.  Just cruise any Tesla forum and people are always posting about what's wrong with their new Tesla.  

As far as BMW, I used the corporate tagline as a lead in to the reason why they're better than Tesla. 

The problem with Teslas and their owners is that they think they have a track car.  The Tesla is a one trick pony. 

Even a BMW M2 would smoke every Tesla except for the new roadster considering there is no track data you can compare it to.  You can't even take the new Roadster seriously since Tesla won't test the car at Nurburgring like all reputable companies do.     "
You're right. I like to think of it as a missed investment opportunity.

"You said, ""Not as much of a first world problem as you might think."" Worrying about WHICH Tesla to get is a fucking first world problem.

I would think parsing is just by time if you fit the criteria.
I definitely got my order in before you lol. I guarantee it!
"If you have to make your argument on the semantics of the word 'order' in a tweet while ignoring the complete reality of the difference between a pre-order and an actual order, especially in the context of your original statement, then you're really just being intellectually disingenuous for the sake of argument. You know very well your original post was implying people purchased and expected a car a year ago and still haven't received it.

Again - cars 'ordered' or 'pre-ordered' or 'reserved' a year ago were never available at the the time. Everyone was told they would have to wait till production began - and that the 'order' or 'pre-order' or 'reservation' bought them a spot in line, not a vehicle. You should ask your aunt about it.

Production began in July 2017. Tesla has had trouble since then...and apparently began to ramp up their production curve. There's a sizable difference between a year and 5 months.

I hope you have a better understanding now that your original post was inaccurate and ignorant (as you stated)."

">Just cruise any Tesla forum and people are always posting about what's wrong 

Dude, just cruise any car forum and people are always posting about what's wrong.  

>Even a BMW M2 would smoke every Tesla except for the new roadster

Tesla never intended for a 5000lb sedan or SUV to be tracked.  The #1 issue preventing track use is the stator isn't water cooled.   Pictures show the semi has water cooled motors, and since they're the same as the Model 3 (just different gearbox), I'd expect Model 3 will have motor cooling too.  If not, the AWD P version coming out in about a year will. (which is a lot more comparable to the M2 than a base 3)    
As for the roadster, give 'em a break, it hasn't even been a week.  Tesla clearly wanted to keep it under wraps, and everyone knows doing laps on the 'ring is **not** how you keep a car secret.  If they don't do a lap soonish, I'll join you in calling them insane."
"> The problem with Teslas and their owners is that they think they have a track car. The Tesla is a one trick pony.

No they don't. You just made up your own position right there. 

Honestly, you sound like the type of person that has a warped idea of what the rest of us think and why we buy what we buy. And you're incapable of seeing we have different reasons for it.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to contacting my Delivery Specialist and see if next Wednesday or Thursday works.

Happy Thanksgiving!!

(enjoy your gold star for ""winning"" this thread)"
Oh I thought you had mentioned you ordered online the day of the reveal...
"Now you're just putting words in my mouth. I don't know how you come to the conclusion that I thought people expected their car before it was released.. lol. I'll let you have the last word if you'd like, just know I have not been back peddling at all. I asked a simple question and you took it too far."
hey man im sorry i offended you and your golf carts but i guess driving actual fun cars kinda keeps me young :) https://imgur.com/a/kWLOS
"Obviously you're not the Tesla fanboy I was thought you were because if you cruise the forums you would see it as much as them discussing how good Japanese tentacle porn looks in their overpriced cars.

Sorry I was confused. I meant I ordered online while in the store. It‚Äôs been a long morning
"I know you haven't been back pedaling, you've been sticking to the same incorrect stance the entire time.

You also never qualified your position that this is due to money problems."
"Hmm, between all the blurry pixels I think I can make out something semi-respectable.

But then I remembered they'd all get crushed out of the gate by the golf carts and I got bored."
"The day my life revolves around the track is the day I'd even consider that meaningful. 

I spend my life driving around my town and state. Doing things with my family. Taking trips. Going to work. I spend almost 4 hours a day in my car. I'm happier in the Tesla than any of the past ones.

And when some pathetic asshat rolls up to me and gives me the nod at a light, I can still show him nothing but my taillights. 

Haven't spent a moment disappointed, or bothered to visit a Jeep or BMW subreddit to try and convince everyone else my choice in car was better. Because that's what losers do."
"Ya, sure is. Good luck."
Makes more sense...you were in Florida when you placed your order then changed delivery to CA. Which would put your order time as the first in CA now. If I have the info correct.
It was a question. I'm telling you that you're taking the too far. This was never an attack. I don't know how I can make it any more clear lol
yea your golf cart would totally destroy my jeep out in moab. not to mention the twin turbo 383 stroker in the vette and the pony with the roush super charger out here at talladega and barber.... careful buddy your lack of car knowledge is showing... but im sure your golfcart is also capable of 650 hp to the rear wheels on the dyno...

It's just sad you feel so insecure about it you're here trying to convince me otherwise."
"I flew from the west coast to Philadelphia to place my order, getting a 3 hour jump.  Then my plane was late, the rental car took an hour (F- HERTZ!), and my job relocated to the east coast.  So I ordered around 8am west coast time, which is great, but no longer special.  FML!"

I thought i was hallucinating after the roadster came out.. it's been a long week
The gauntlet has been laid down for the end of the ICE vehicle tonight.
"I'm thrilled. However, I'm sure many would agree that Tesla may be spreading themselves too thin... Model 3 production hell hopefully resolved early next year, 2018. 2019 is model Y and Semi. 2020 is new roadster. 3 vastly different models in 2 years while already trying to solve model 3 production problems. 1st roadster was 2008. S was 2012. X was 2015. I am confident in their ability to make good margin on model 3, and solve production hell next year, but releasing a game changing, revolutionary small SUV, semi truck, and sports car in the span of 2 years will be an incredible challenge. "
"I can now say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to let my self-driving electric car take me to a Mars spaceport‚Äù without sounding crazy.

I am truly excited for the future."
I hope it gets uploaded on youtube.
"Thankfully, they quickly put the specs and price for the roadster on the website! https://www.tesla.com/roadster/?redirect=no"
"That was one of the most incredible things I have ever watched.

Makes me wonder if the ""Delay of the unveiling due to model 3 bottlenecks"" was actually just cover for them to finish the Roadster 2 prototype?"
"Honestly, I think this is the first Tesla conference where I truly felt like ICE cars cannot compete anymore. 620 miles of range..... 1.9 seconds 0-60! That's literally incomprehendable, If I was another car company, I'd start dumping more cash into my EV sector and asking why we aren't getting results like that."
Yeah this and the first iphone event legit surprised me. Everything else you sorta know ahead of time and what to expect. But this? This could be the GOAT of cars if they pull it off.
"Not sure if anyone noticed or not, but Elon did quite well speaking last night.  Very little stuttering.  He seemed very comfortable."
Try record breaking in every way. 
"Can‚Äôt a diesel semi get almost 1,000 miles of range?


Edit - ask an honest question and get a downvote. I just <3 this sub. "
I‚Äôm still in shock
How are they able to keep there development so well under wraps?
I want Tesla to make a motorcycle 
WTF is all I can say right now
It was a semi good event.
Definitely. Was impressed by the trucks. Then I lost my mind when they revealed the Roadster 2.0. 
If only there was a decent stream to see it live :( 
"Yep I agree.  Hands down best event so far.  Elon‚Äôs speaking was good, bit nervous at first but really improved throughout.  Though it was great Jerome and Hans were there.  Product wise, still need some details on truck, how megachargers work.  What cab weight is.  Loved the design of both semi and roadster.  Shot right across the bow of Porsche.   They‚Äôre playing catch up to 2008 Tesla.  

Need to find some way to get my brain back from an alternate dimension.  "
Roadster 2.0 for $200k. Sold! 
"If the numbers they gave for the Tesla Semi are right then this eclipses the model 3 as a product. 
Massive potential market.
Beats everything else in land transport by a wide margin."
"Best news would have been:. We're making 10000 model 3s per month.  The truck and new car are cool for sure, but tesla is too much hype and not enough profit."
"It was an awesome surprise, but it would be pretty tough for anything to top the Model 3 reveal in March 2016 for me.  That featured a product I'll actually buy someday."
Anyone else feel like Elon was a bit drunk at the start of the event?
"Yeah, and it was the first one that I chose to sleep through...  
‚ÄúSemi truck?  Yeah, cool for the industry but for me no real direct impact ‚Äî I wish them luck‚Äù

Roadster with 1.9s of acceleration with PERFORMANCE VERSION TO COME?!  
OVER 600 miles of range?  
"
[The camera man was on point](https://streamable.com/wzyh4)
Roadster is unbelievable. Period.
"oh brave new world, that has such products in it!

i sing the vehicle electric!"
Just waiting for the pickup truck...
"Anyone else hear Elon mention the early reservation holders at the very beginning? Did I hear that right, that there are already trucking companies invested in the semi?"
"I'm most interested in the Megachargers. My wild guess math:
500 mile range, <2kWh/mi. Assume that means 1.75, which works out to an 875kWh battery pack.
400 miles charge (80%, 700kWh) in 30 minutes.
Assuming 10% conversion losses (someone correct me on this, just a guess), that works out to a roughly 1.5mWh supercharger. 
Holy balls. "
This event reminded me so much of when Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone. Jaws on the floor seeing a new product that absolutely demolishes any competition.
"Sure getting a tesla in 2018 would be nice, but almost feels worth it to wait until 2020 for much faster charging times (400 miles in 30 minutes is crazy) and huge bumps in performance."
I WILL have that silver Tesla Roadster. I WILL!!!!!!
"Man what an event. Well worth the wait and getting up in the middle of the night. I was almost waiting for something disappointing to be honest, but that was just great.

There's no debating this event was, once again, for building hype, as is so often the case, and possibly removing some of the focus that's been laid on the recent Model 3 production problems. But then again, these *are* exciting products and I don't doubt they'll reach the specs announces today. Just sad it'll take so long until we actually see these things in action.

And regarding the Roadster - weren't there very concrete announcements in recent years that Tesla will not go above 100kwh with their car batteries? But yeah, I guess the Roadster is just something else. If people are paying over $200k for a car, you might as well throw another battery in there. I just wonder if the prototype we saw today already has that capacity, I mean, they surely require some increases in battery density to stuff that much into a car, and I'd assume they're confident to achieve that in the following years. Or are they actually already at this point?"
Anyone know where I can rewatch unveil?  
"**Tesla 2019:** new full-sized pickup truck model that does quarter mile in 8 seconds, with 1230 miles of range for 12000$"
Next time ... Tesla Cargo Ships
"Agreed.  Best ending to one of their events, ever.

That said, I do wonder if they kind of undermined the Semi unveil.  It was a short presentation but fairly impressive.  However, the Roadster is what the majority of folks are talking about now.

I'm sure their employees check their ego at the door, but if I was working on the team who developed the semi, I'd be a little peeved that they didn't even get to enjoy the limelight for one evening...

Don't get me wrong though, the Roadster portion was indeed the proverbial mic drop!"
Coolest guy alive.  Coolest company running
so... 140 kwh battery for s/x likely
"Telsa Semi is how they pay for the dreams

Tesla Roadster will be the dreams."

"I always thought I wanted to do something cool, like Astronomy or something. Maybe I'm just gonna be happy as a truck driver. "
Finally waking up to some Amazing Positive News! 
"I wonder how much that Truck battery weighs. The battery of a Tesla S already weighs ~800kg, so the Truck batteries must weigh several  metric tons at least.

Does anyone know or can make an educated guess how much?"
"How in Fuck can Elon Musk overhype the shit out of this event in a previous tweet, then blast the brain out of our skulls while still downplaying the thing ?

I mean, they could have shown one truck, then the other (by the way, does anybody know the diff between the two ?), then reveal the hyper-mega-charging thingy.

The final blow with the roadster 2 was pretty spot on, gotta admit.

Damn, dude foung his portal gun, didn't he ?"
Is there an actual pricetag out for the tesla semi?
Yes that was incredible. 
"Well, the two ways a diesel truck beats Tesla Semi is current availability and upfront cost.  But those will be resolved in time.  And the payback period for the extra cost is short according to Tesla."
"If they can get the Model 3 production issues squared away in the next six months, they're going to have so much brand armor they'll be practically unstoppable."
Now let's see if they can make a profit and produce model 3s on time
"After the Model 3 reveal this year, I was expecting something equally cringe worthy. But not bad. "
"If you haven‚Äôt read his biography, do it. "
It's also a transformer tho
it beat the dodge demon. damn it the thing just came out.
"It's nice, but I still with they'd target a sporty looking car that could compete against the Miata."
Can't wait for that fat fuck Brit with a potty mouth to shit on the roadster. Anything he does would appear bias
Great but clearly a distraction on Model 3 production delays. 
"Bummer. I missed it - I overslept. Damn you, different time zones!"
Definitely the best!  He‚Äôs our Tony Stark!
"In all honesty, to really capture the heart of America, Tesla needs to make production trucks like a Tesla Tacoma or something. Now I know the target audience is not going to enjoy it but I think it will slowly spread when the torque of the electric engine is realized "
It‚Äôs not a roadster if it seats 4!
"Nah, I liked the first one where they first announced the name ""Tesla"", I was really happy that the crazy old pigeon fucker's legacy had officially been continued in ways that he probably never even imagined. "
"I'm highly skeptical about all the claims.  Downvote me to hell but this is a massive tesla circle jerk that doesn't factor in a lot of variables.  How will these trucks handle inclines?  Say imma go up the 5 to Oregon, the 80 to Reno or the 15 to Vegas?  Will I still get these fantastical quick charges and ranges as claimed?  All these routes cross substantial mountains and the current industry struggles enough as is with efficiency on these routes.  Does tesla really have it all magically figured out?  I'm playing devils advocate, I want genuine answers to these questions."
"I missed it, anybody know where I can rewatch it?"
What's the typical distance that a diesel truck can travel fully loaded on a full tank? Looking for an idea of how Tesla's Semi compares to what's currently prevalent.
L7 have a lot of concerns for the cost associated with what sounds like a super chargers overhaul. I deal with vehicle turning movement daily and it is a massive challenge to get a WB-67 design vehicle turning template to work on a site. I imagine they will take a two part approach of evaluating existing chargers for retrofit and developing new locations.
anyone have a link to the event itself?
"I am not a fan of reveals in general because I am always let down in some cruel way.  Half life reveal?  Nope, card game.  But this was really cool."
"Yeah, website glitches and other delays aside, it was pretty awesome."
"I don't know. Electric anything has been underwhelming since the reveal of the electric boogaloo, 1984. Step it up, Elon!"
"What about the Tesla event where Dan Nainan performed his shitty hack comedy and half the people left during his set? that's pretty great, in a ""holy shit this is cringy"" kind of way "
Next up... Please be hoverboard!
< 250 IPhoneX devices would pay for the roadster.
"""The Hell with Barriers, Jump Over!""   
Because these products just did."
"I mean with the launch of the three how do they have the tooling, capital, or capacity to begin producing semi trucks and a sports car?"
"Every measured way, id wager. "
"Telsa has always been ""that's cool and all but it's not realistic for me"" because of the mileage. The new roadster had me considering saving for one, though right now the highway I travel doesn't really have any chargers, so it'd be slow charging if by chance I need a charge."
"Best Elon performance, not that I don't love him but this was more confident less stammer and overall more awesome Elon then usual!!"
i'm glad tesla finally figured out how to do a good front fascia. that new roadster is beautiful from every angle.
I need a pickup truck dammit!!! LOL
what was the problem with the grey semi not being able to drive away? anyone see the driver mashing the stalk like mad?
"Where is my Model 3?

I am one of the absolutely first people on the list and have heard no word yet. This is a distraction. Dreams without execution are a nightmare.

When you learn the roadster has a 250+ mph top speed. I betting its as high as 260 mph. 
Agent of change. Can‚Äôt wait!

What was the smaller size metallic black semi about? 
"inded it was. Been following Tesla since 2011, this felt great!"
Really good financially too. I'm sure 1000 of the roadster's will be reserved at 250k each. Plus a significant amount of the semi's. They could get 2 quarters of cash to burn from reservations alone. 
"That thing is not just another roadster, it's a hypercar. Damn "
"I've never driven a truck before, but i still want to own this one
"
Where's the truck article all I see is talks about the roaster nothing about the truck? 
Anyone got a link? 
What will the top speed be? Cause I'd be surprised if it can beat the Bugatti Chiron. 
So realistically Tesla truck in 2021 and roadster in 2023? Lol

"True that! But there is always more than one truth. The world is not ready for the complete shift yet, furthermore the gasoline lobby is still way too strong. Why hasn‚Äôt any other company worked on it? Because it has no use in mass adoption. As far as i know, i might be wrong, tesla is not making any profit at this point... the competition is raking in billions meanwhile... so why should they build something that has no support out in the field... and people are still willing to buy diesel and gasoline engines. I don‚Äôt even  want to go into detail about the global footprint the batteries by them selbes are causing. Selling people a green and eco feeling is a good way to market your products these days... there is one good thing though, tesla did actually open. A discussion about how our future transportation might look like.. in the meantime VW sold more diesel cars than in any year before... strange isn‚Äôt it."
"Meanwhile.. i'm still waiting for my model 3... reserved on april 3rd 2016... too much hype, not enough results."
Elon really needs to hire a speaking coach. Or just hire someone else to make the announcements. Painful to listen to.

It's too bad the truck won't be available till 2020 and the car probably 2022
[deleted]
Damn 
When are they releasing the semi?
"Wait holdup, roadster is back?"
I wanna know their 0-400-0kph time
This is definitely just Elon wanting to have a future fleet of autonomous semis that can provide an on-demand logistics service to dominate the industry while probably displacing a lot of jobs. Still super sweet tho :D
"I'll be the dissenting voice.

Two thumbs down. I wanted a Tesla pickup. We already have a fast Tesla car, it's called the Model S. They just unveiled a Model S with a different body kit and longer range. Nobody is going to buy the Semi, it's too expensive.

OK now throw stuff at me.

Why did Elon sound fucked up?
Now to wait until Musk's claims are actually real.
"The model S P100D was already quickest the production car in history.... I don't really think 918 cars count as a ""production car"". "
PT Barnum was right. 
Considering they just ‚Äúlet go‚Äù a good amount of their work force... They should probably focus on getting their promised model 3‚Äôs out the door instead of trying to take more reservations based on more ‚Äúpromises‚Äù to fund their current disastrous production issues..  
But where's my model 3?
"Yeah the unveil was awesome, more stuff you can't bring to market in a timely fashion......now where is my Model 3 again?????? 2021 you say?????"
"The electric truck is neat, but not viable yet...at least not in most of the US market.

Some may use it for local runs...but having a 250-mi range (one-way) is gonna be a big setback. It won't be able to use the 500-mi range until truck stop chargers take hold, as it is they would always have to get the truck back to their yard. 

Edit: Should've guessed this sub would be the same...no circle jerk? downvote."
This is Elon's world. We just live in it. 
Are they making motorcycles? I would love an effective electric bike.

Tesla working hard to eliminate jobs again.
No! I think they just announced some new stuff in order to be able to finance the old stuff that they are not able to cope with. I am curious how long this company will be able to lie at their customers and still take their money.
But is this a case of vaporware or can they bring these to market?
"Yeah but, how long do they take to charge again? lol"
Introducing...Tesla Airplanes!!!
‚ÄúS-so... I‚Äôm pleased to announce uh uh that we‚Äôre working on Teslaportation.‚Äù -Elon 2020 
">Yeah, unfortunately, I expect they won't be able to spring a surprise like that on us at every event

They wanted to make sure the next capital raise went really well at this critical time. "
"I dunno, maybe next even they'll announce they've met their production targets."
#Tesla Stargate coming in 2050 ü§©
"With the model 3 supply chain issues Elon knew Tesla needed to come out swinging and go big tonight. They needed a home run and instead hit a grand slam!

Let's see where TSLA stock is at tomorrow. Sucks to be a short seller. "
You might be comparing them to Apple. For me they are capable of doing anything possible. 
"I'm sorry but as a truck driver I really don't see how the revealed truck in any way competes with a diesel semi.

A diesel truck costs about $100 to $120k, has a range of 1200+ miles on 200 gallons of fuel, can be refueled almost anywhere in under 15 minutes, have extremely long service lives with minimal maintenance and new engines have zero emissions.

Gasoline engines are easy to beat with electric, but diesels are the most efficient iem engines around. Maybe it's a mistake to try and take them on"
I was pretty surprised by the Model 3 event. Just not pleasantly...
Fucking hell dude take what you've got
"In addition, unfortunately I don't expect they'll ever be able to produce more than 500 units of each vehicles per quarter. "
"Dunno. They have done a good job so far.

I think that so long as there is so much room for batteries to improve this is likely to happen."

Am I the only one who thought Marvel's Nightcrawler?
Big ass mother fucker
Does anyone know what is stands for?
"""Best At Moving Freight"" "
What does that even mean?
BAMF struck me as dumb given all the recent press about unwelcome sexual advances. Elon started showing some class when he regretted the S3XY naming convention. This seems like a step backward to his knuckle dragging Neanderthal days. 
http://ksfm.radio.com/2012/04/23/how-much-are-your-body-parts-worth-on-the-black-market/
any ideas what even the base might cost??
"I've been pretty happy with my ability to afford an X and S, but when I saw the price of the new Roadster I was like, ""Ok, no, that's too far.""

I need to give my career a kick in the ass and make that thing affordable..."
They‚Äôre worth roughly the cost of a 2008 Ford Focus. 
Not a bad way to boost income when you need it. Now he just has to deliver. 
[deleted]
That‚Äôs not a bad price for a road legal super car at all. Can‚Äôt wait to see how many celebrities and doctors kill them selves 
Don't you mean 50 million?
It's fully refundable so it's still a zero interest loan not straight up revenue
"People were essentially buying high end cars to reserve the damn thing. 
50k for a reservation... Truly a car for the really rich. Makes me sad that I'll probably never own one.

What a sexy car it is, though. My God."
"I mean, you didn‚Äôt factor in costs but I catch your drift."
You're forgetting COGS and SG&A.
"Only 1000??? The fuck?? Why? Tesla could make it 50,000 and the Chinese market would eat that shit up. 

Edit: On the website it says 1000 reservations, does that mean only 1000 are made or is OP wrong? "
"It must have cost quite a bit in research and development, though. "
"I ain't complaining.
Keep the hustle up bank it all
Pull out the ground from beneath the elites feet
Have them fund the technorevolution"
Now that's a real sense of pride and accomplishment. 
Now would be the perfect time to win the lottery or have a rich but distant relative die.
"Can I afford it?  
No.  
Do I love the people who can and are forking over their money?  
Yes.  

If the Roadster 2.0 (?) has handling done right, this very well could have just completely killed all logical reasons for owning an ICE supercar.  
Sure it won‚Äôt have noise engine / exhaust noise or a manual transmission, but that is about the only remaining reason that someone would choose an ICE.  
I‚Äôm over all of that ever since first driving the S, but do know that there are still diehards out there that are yet convinced.  

So, now to figure out how to boost my career in the next 4 (yeah, it will be late like everything else) so that I can afford one of these bad boys!"
[deleted]
"Wel, if I had $250K I sure would. "
Yea but you have to take into account the R&D cost behind this car. That alone will be super expensive. The Bugatti Veyron cost around 2mil and they were still making losses on each car sold. 
Shit. That's how lamborghini and ferrari does it. Most of new lambos out there are sold out before they're even built.
"I thought it was a 50k deposit, no?"
"This isn't an ego car, this car is actually a world record car and has a rightful place in any rich persons collection."
No idea why they don't use YouTube. Works great for SpaceX. Meanwhile Ustream seems to never work for Tesla.
Where can I watch it now?
"Ugh. I wanted so bad to see this. But yeah, streaming problems."
Had to zoom in since the full screen button wouldn't work.
Hooli's compression sucks!
In the Rolling Stone interview it was revealed that Musk was massively depressed and feeling worthless that entire day (going through a breakup) and he had to psych himself up right before the Model 3 event to get thru it.... 
Such a Tony Stark difference between tonight and when they gave the model 3 cars out
"I thought that launch was awesome! He had his production hell joke... classic Tesla moment.

And even though yeah there was more stuff in this launch, and cooler stuff, the Model 3 is what Tesla was started for. That was their end goal, an affordable electric car that would wreck ICE. So that will always be the best event for me."
Model 3 handouts was really more of an internal event.  That's why it seemed akward to the rest of us.
"Well yeah. What he unveiled at Model 3 event was supposed to start shipping more or less immediately, and regardless of the optimistic face to the world, he's too smart to not have known the pile of shit he was wading into.

What he unveiled last night is multiple years away from that kind of pressure. Without a doubt this reveal was more fun for all concerned.
"
TONY Stark?!
You could just feel the stark difference of his presentation style with the roadster.
"As he gains confidence, wealth, and power, he does seem to be growing into more of a Tony Stark like persona."
"In what way? Tesla has always exceled at revealing non-shipping product. ;)
"
That would be a waste of his talents for sure
"Someone right after that shouted ""ELON FOR EMPEROR"""
You thought Obama had problems with the birth certificate ...
I got a semi.

If it lasts more than 4 hours I'd suggest you seek medical attention

"I was flaccid and not crying, but my scrotum was leather tight."
Just like my honeymoon.
"600 mile range, free electricity from superchargers and roof.

The big 5 automakers are watching their empire crumble before their eyes like horse drawn carriages to the internal combustion engine.  

Tesla is undervalued."
"> Model 3 production hell hopefully resolved early next year, 2018. 

I think this is the key, they are going to need the income streams to fund everything else.

Reservations for the Semi & Roadster may help a bit.......

If they need to raise more capital, it may be to build/buy new factories to make the Model Y, Roadster & possibly the Semi.

One thing I would like more info on is the pickup, detail on it is sketchy IMO..... I am not sure if they build one for fun or it is a product that is coming out soon."
"> 3 vastly different models in 2 years while already trying to solve model 3 production problems.

Semi (re)uses a lot of the Model 3 parts.  Motors, screens, likely AP, probably battery pack architecture.  Simple cab.  Once 3 production is ramped, I don't see an issue with Semi.   
   
Roadster, idfkwtf.  Made out of magical magic. You got me there."
"Roadster will be released in 3 years, not 2."
"Shorter learning curve as they move along, you‚Äôd think. Granted, the semi is in a different space, but the roadster shouldn‚Äôt be any more difficult than the S assuming the numbers are achievable. "
Yeah. It‚Äôs hard for me to get stoked about a new vehicle when the Model 3 is delayed.  I feel like we‚Äôre getting to the point where they‚Äôre announcing vehicles that will take as long or longer than the Model X (or more) to actually get on the road.
"I don't think they will be spread too thin because they have priorities. The Model 3 is the highest priority, then the Semi, then the roadster."
Each time they've decided to produce a new model things have gone smoother/faster though. Production is unlikely to get worse over time so I feel better about the next couple of years. 
"Ah, they have multiple employees. The ones sorting through production issues are not the ones doing vehicle design.

Also, the Tesla semi leverages a lot of the Model 3 tech."
"Pretty sure the design-teams run parallel, and don't really inflict on each other. There is a limit to how many people you can throw at the design without just making slowing down the process.  
  
Also - the cars they presented now are lower volume cars where production optimization is not as important as with Model 3."
"Well Tesla is a much bigger company. Designing cars seems like something that could be done relatively separately. I‚Äôm also sure you can add about 1 year to most of those models, if not 2. "
"Different departments. The Model 3 is in production, the semis and Roadster 2 are still in development. There's a healthy 24+ month gap they have to unkink Model 3 production."
I would not be surprised if the Falcon Heavy cargo is a few Tesla bodies with a live 4K cam feed. 
Seriously. It's kinda pathetic that I have to watch someone's crappy screen recording just to watch after the event. 
It was uploaded to YouTube and then got hit with copyright claims on the audio.  Managed to get 2 views before being pulled.  They delisted it 15 minutes later.
Any word on price for the semi? 
Might be the opposite- unveil the roadster early to help counter the negative press about the Model 3 delays.
"Model 3 was never the reason for delay

They claimed Puerto Rico

*Edit: I'm wrong. It was both"
Could I get a link to video?
"I expect there will be many mandatory meetings at Chevy, GM, Ford, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, BMW, etc. starting tomorrow morning, if not tonight."
There is no way they crammed that much battery into such a small vehicle with today's technology. That is probably an estimate based on what they hope from future batteries. I highly doubt the demo unit they showed off had even close to 620 miles of range.
seriously tho my ice car barley does 400 a tank.....
"I think it would have sealed the deal if it were capable of charging roughly as quickly as the truck.  If it were 100 miles in as much as 10 minutes for at least the first 200 miles I would say its a killer.  But the thing is people want to gas up in 5 minutes or less so anything that take twice as long and doesn't give them a significant amount of driving really hurts the adoption.  People don't mind waiting as much when its a road trip but if you've got a lot to do around town or nearby then 10 minutes for 100 miles is reasonable and necessary for our society.

That said its still *insanely* impressive.  Not everyone cares about much more than than practicality though and their mercedes is fast and cozy enough and safe enough as is."
"The laughing phase lasted till about 2016.
We are now coming out of the ignoring phase and the fighting phase have just started.  
In 2-5 years, all the manufacturers will have EV models or risk bankruptcy."
"""Why aren't I 50mpg ahead you might ask?""
Big 5 probably."
When he can supply that sort of range in a car that the majority of people can afford it will be something to talk about. Till then this is just a publicity stunt. ‚ÄúLook at what we made for millionaires!‚Äù
"I hope ICE car companies just keep doing the same ol same ol. Even in 20 years from now when everything is electric and autonomous and no one even buys cars anymore, they are still in denial, paying millions of dollars of their dwindling capital on Superbowl commercials for F150s. I know it'll never happen, but wouldn't that be funny?"
"> If I was another car company, I'd start dumping more cash into my EV sector and asking why we aren't getting results like that.

That new roadster will cost $250,000 (basic version, without taxes) and is a limited edition of 1000 cars. That just not the same league as your average joe car. It's more like another toy car for the super rich. So you're gonna have to look at manufacturers like Ferrari. And Ferrari already announced last year that they'll start selling hybrids in 2019. So they are already dumping more and more cash into their EV sector..."
"Yeah i was surprised how much of the information in this hadn't leaked. I saw rumors of 300 mile range, we got 500. I was really pleasantly surprised by how many surprises this event got out of me. And i follow this stuff daily like most of us here do."
GOAT?
"It's funny how to us this was impressive, but if you look at some youtube comments people still think it's really bad."
"Yes but unnecessary when they are [required by law](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+long+can+a+truck+driver+drive+without+a+break) to stop every 8 hours for at least a half an hour. 

8 hours * 60mph = 480 miles. 

30 minutes of charging = 400 miles in the Tesla Semi."
"Yes. However, you're required to take breaks.. So it shouldn't be that big of a deal.. Plus, this Tesla Semi doesn't look that comfy to take cross country trucking. Where's my fridge, bed etc space? But for most trucking routes this truck is more than perfect! Especially inner-city with the acceleration times. "
It's for transporting between a distribution center and delivery center. Those simi's that you see offloading at Walmart didn't drive cross country. 
You could say their reveals were electrifying.
Okay dude that's a bit ott 
Lots of money and a sharp axe.
That would be incredible
"Elon said they won‚Äôt do it due to safety issues, it‚Äôs a big deal to him and people die on motorcycles left and right"
Isle of Man TT winner rode an electric recently. 
"They won't. Not enough space to hide the battery, and if your bike ever goes down or you need to man handle it, pray for Jesus to help lift it.

"
"The worst selling motorcycle in history, it would be. "
"Have a burning desire to be able to drive a motorcycle that can only go around the block before it runs out of charge?  I'm sure it feel like taking off on a real rocket on a drag strip.  But, it couldn't possibly be good for anything much else."
It's on youtube now. There is a 20 minute version. How long did the stream go?
[This is the better stream that I've found](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqYU6VA1Rmw&feature=youtu.be). Click the description for links to part 2 and 3. It doesn't include the roadster though.
"I can't afford that, but I'm a tiny person. Can I ride in the back of yours?"
And what do you do for a living?
His comment about potentially being cheaper per mile of transportation than a train is way under appreciated so far. That could be absolutely huge. 
"> Beats everything else in land transport by a wide margin

How so? I didn't see the presentation, what makes this E-Truck better than normal Trucks or other E-Trucks?"
"Their next capital raise was tonight... a thousand $250k deposits ($250 million total). Interest free, no dilution."
"While you're not wrong that they need to up their production, this demonstration was more than just hype. 

I am very close to the stock and used to work on Wall Street as a research analyst that made buy/hold/sell recommendations on stocks. One of the key concerns around the stock is competition; investors fear that there are no major competitive advantages that Tesla holds over other competitors that are gradually making better and better electric cars. The demonstration today was a drastic reminder that Tesla holds huge advantages in technology (i.e. the mile ranges demonstrated today were vastly higher than investor expectations of around 200-300 mi for the Semi), design (first-principle thinking that can lead to significantly reduced drag, for example), and most importantly, brand equity. Did you see how people reacted to each unveiling? It is completely unparalleled. Tesla is in another league compared to the other competitors.

Remember that stock valuation is all about FUTURE projections of earnings, not current. And that means that investor perceptions of the company's growth trajectory, and how that might be impacted from competition and other factors, are entirely what is driving the stock right now. Now think about what today's demonstration does to investor perceptions of the company, their competitive edge, and how much more willing investors are now to hold onto the stock for the longer-term picture. This was a massive event that was more than just hype, and to narrow the stock to just its near-term production goals is too myopic"
"Best to have their world class design department just sit out, right?

Stay focused. News will come. Tonight was about upcoming programs."
"People said the same thing about amazon never turning a profit for what, ten years? I‚Äôve been a prime member since 2002 and have followed their stock for some time. Never underestimate the little guy trying to change the world."
"Tesla's profits are all re-invested. I wouldn't use profit as a barometer for a growth manufacturing start-up.
"
"You might get downvoted for this, but you are right"
Dumb question: Why isn't he raising funds like any normal company ? Surely some investors out there are willing to invest for some equity ? Isn't it a easier way to raise capital ?
"no, you're def right. i was hoping for an update on the T3."
"And it's the Model Tesla have been building up to for many years. If they can start pumping them out soon, they will be properly established as a car-company.  
  
If they get up to 500.000 Model 3/yr and 50.000 Model S and X /yr they will  already have passed Volvo and Land Rover, and be in the range of Lexus, GMC, Dodge and Ram.  "
I wouldn't be surprised if he took a couple shots before. He seemed much looser and confident.
That's my friend! I was right next to him for this. His hype was real.

I think the hardware required for 400 miles in 30 min might be limited to the semi no?
"I'm.not sure that consumer cars can use these ""Megachargers‚Äù. I thought it sounded like it was for semis only"
The roadster needs a bigger battery because the battery is the limiting factor in power
https://livestream.tesla.com/#
"Its playing on a loop, I just watched it again"
"If you want a 9 minute version, The Verge has one. Can't link cuz mobile. "
"I think there certainly is an overlap between the development team of the Roadster and Semi. The design studio is probably not as expansive and divided (in terms of different models) to have dedicated teams for each 'project'. I also suspect that the designers of the Semi knew about the Roadster unveil well beforehand.

I  agree though that it stole quite some of the attention from the Semi. ""Okay enough about this super practical talk about Truck economics: Here's a supercharged hypercar for y'all""."
"The semi was geared towards a pretty small number of fleet commanders that will buy a semi though, the roadster reveal makes every person who saw it want to start working overtime to go buy one"
Well of course consumers are excited about the only  consumer product announced. 
He's Donald Trump with better hair.  Absolutely phenomenal at distracting people from the elephant on the production line
what
They probably need to move away from 18650 in a future redesign of the car. Guess after Roadster is released? 
After they get the 3 s ramp we will probably see bigger packs. Though I doubt they'll add much more performance to the s/x. Gotta maintain thed performance gap to keep the roadster selling.  
it‚Äôs the other way around. Assuming a semi truck is your dream.
Till he saw 2020. Next 6 years of his life are gonna be so slow...
No way to extrapolate really. The S battery technology is essentially unchanged from its design 6-7 years ago. This is much newer tech.
"And it seats 4, not 1... "
who?
"Sssshhhhh, we're not suppose to point the elephant on the production line. "
https://livestream.tesla.com/#
"Instead of rolling coal, douchebags will put big tesla coils on the top of their trucks for no reason."
"That will be a lot easier once the semi is commonplace. Tesla will have a *""real truck""* on the roads which will make the pick-up much more acceptable in that market. "
"I was thinking this during the event as well. When it's got ""Roadster"" right in the name, why bother with the extra weight? Could take the opportunity to have more cargo capacity."
"Its was purely platonic, mister.

"
Isn't an e-motor more torquey than a diesel?
"> How will these trucks handle inclines?

You clearly didn't watch the presentation that stated how the trucks handle an incline.

> the current industry struggles enough as it is with efficiency on these routes.

Yes because the industry is not electric yet and have nowhere near 500 miles of range.

Did you watch the stream or are you just looking at numbers from the Verge or something?
"
"Enough of these 'you can't even accept criticism' posts that fail to acknowledge that MAYBE it's not their critical argument that gets down voted but the fact they introduce it with 'you're all stupid fanboys' 'this is a massive tesla circle jerk' snarky comments. Want to have interesting, critical discussions? Learn how to be respectful first, please.
Take my down vote and know what it is for.

Of course range will vary depending on driving conditions, and they made it clear. Yes you'll still get those fantastical quick charges and you can bet Tesla will deploy the 'megacharging' infrastructure intelligently especially when covering difficult routes. While it's relatively hard to predict where your cars go and place your charging network accordingly, for established truck routes it's a no-brainer"
There are a few shitty restreams on youtube. they all cut out and they all mis major parts of the streams.

"1000

The claim is 500 plus another 400 during a lunch break.

That‚Äôs about 14.5 hours of driving which is past the legal limit for drivers. So it competes if true."
"Legally, there won't be a difference between a Tesla and a diesel with the stated range and charge times. Unless the semi driver never eats or takes a break for 14 hours..."
Megachargers are not for cars.  They'll initially be only installed at customer's sites.
"Truck is 2019 car is 2020.  They expect the money to be rolling in from the 3 next year, which will pay for the Truck setup and maybe the car. I expect they don't expect to sell that many roadsters, but I am sure it will be a good profit item."
"Yup, cause the robots that are assembling the Model 3 are the same people building the semi..."
Yup
That's before you remember that Elon explicitly stated that these are the numbers for the base model and the full specs will come out next year at the earliest. Just imagine if they break the 300mph barrier!
"I'd say thats a good guess.

https://www.gtplanet.net/koenigsegg-smashes-production-car-speed-record-277mph-run/

Koenigsegg just set a 277 mph record and you can bet that tesla would have announced they had the fastest car if they did."

"I think this is probably the next new model. But they might need to get some buy in from the Republican population, using the Semi to get their foot in the door. Then once people see in real life how bad ass the semi is, they will be more accepting of the ""green energy, hippy, pick up truck"". All about perception to get people to part with their cash! ( On a side note, think about all the Powertools you could power with a pickup with 100-200kwh battery pack!)"
Don't think the truck is aimed at the general consumer tho

"**Lithium-ion battery**

A lithium-ion battery or Li-ion battery (abbreviated as LIB) is a type of rechargeable battery in which lithium ions move from the negative electrode to the positive electrode during discharge and back when charging. Li-ion batteries use an intercalated lithium compound as one electrode material, compared to the metallic lithium used in a non-rechargeable lithium battery. The electrolyte, which allows for ionic movement, and the two electrodes are the constituent components of a lithium-ion battery cell.

Lithium-ion batteries are common in home electronics.

How do you figure the semi is too expensive? According to the presentation at least it's significantly cheaper to operate than a diesel truck. 
I want the roadster!  Friggin Awesome!
"You're on point.  Forget the semi and another faster car, make a truck already Tesla!  But maybe Tesla thinks the semi will be profitable?"

"My guess is that it's only 1000 ""founder's edition"" cars. Just like all their previous cars have had the first runs be considered founders editions, so they are doing with the roadster. But I don't think that means they won't make more.

It was really a bit of an empty presentation by comparison. This one had tons of details, interior renderings, etc.

Is this actually satire? This has to be satire. 
Tesla is burning like 400M a quarter.  How are they making empires crumble?
"The big automakers are just waiting until the time is right. 

I‚Äôm sorry to offend anyone here - I really do think Tesla is awesome and they are revolutionizing the industry. 

But they are tiny.  Very tiny compared to the big automakers. 

You don‚Äôt think the people running these massive companies understand the business? They don‚Äôt notice Tesla ?

Some analysts out there have worked out the math and figured out how much money would be lost vs how much would be gained by ramping up electric vehicle production. 
Right now, they make more money by keeping their current model going. 

I hope I am wrong, as I would love to see Tesla become the largest auto producer, but I just don‚Äôt see GM, Toyota, VW, Honda and Co letting them get there. 

"
"Maybe, but I think that since autonomous cars are the future, and once that happens, people will use cars more like they use trains, ie rent them for short trips. And so car companies will supply fleets of standardized cars to the taxi companies like Uber etc. So yeah Tesla could supply some cars, but it could just as easily be another car company. The smarter car companies are realizing this and already striking deals."
Lol pickup semi was just for fun. I think. To see what they could do. But then it was too fun not to share.
Funding one project with another continually sounds like a pyramid scheme to me
"To be fair, the roadster is their engineering toy so-to-speak - it's high-priced, which means they can cram a lot of technology in it that would be cost-prohibitive even in the Model S/X. Also, this would be a great platform to play with the sans-12v architecture, rather than re-designing the platform for the Model Y."

"Batteries are pretty dense. Look at the amount of space the battery takes up in the Model S [for example](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tesla-batteryloc1.jpg). Plenty of space for more battery.

Also it doesn't have 620 miles for the sake of having long range. The battery size is the reason why they have those acceleration numbers. Bigger battery = more power available."
"The batteries are in the doors, boot, and tires.

It is not a car. It is actually a big battery with motors"
You‚Äôre probably right that those numbers are about 15% higher but it‚Äôs not unreasonable to assume battery density will comt8nue to increase in density as it has previously.

"That's supercharging and Tesla already had to throttle use of them on vehicles due to battery damage.

You can't act like that's the sole solution to refueling, because in reality it's only meant for fringe use."
"that has nothing to do with it. having all that range means the driver does not have to search for a truck stop or rest area to take his 30, he can pull over pretty much anywhere. Lesser range means he would have to route plan around truck stops, which is highly inconvenient.

it is a good thing to be able to go coast to coast with only one scheduled fuel stop."
"Also, in the US there's a maximum driving time of 11 hours. Cut that in half, you have ~5.5 hrs of driving at 65mph, you have 358 miles and a half hour/hour break to recharge the truck. It works out perfectly IMO, shouldn't even need to charge the truck to 90% for normal runs."
"Aren't most trucks doing 65 though? That makes it 520 miles, 120 more than a Tesla."
"> 30 minutes of charging = 400 miles in the Tesla Semi.

Where did you get these numbers from? Honest question, I'd like to read more about the batteries in truck."

I only saw a rendering towards the steering wheel area, nothing to the back.

"Yeah, but unfortunately for Tesla, they have to follow up with those promises :/ 

This coming from a huge Tesla fanboy haha. "
Agree 100%. My thoughts as well.
"Unfortunately not. They are burning ~$600 million every 3 months, so that would imply this keeps the lights on for another month. If Tesla was looking to make it a cash grab, the number would have been closer to 10,000 instead of 1,000 in my opinion"
"The deposit is 5k, I don't know that 50k of semis have been reserved today. Guess we'll know soon enough."
"Problem is, who really believes they can deliver in time? When Musk promises 3 years, people already joke this is going to take at least 6. The way other companies are investing right now, Tesla might not be ahead any more by then. VW alone has 70b$ investments in cars and batteries until 2025 and announced to have like 80 new EVs by then. 

And you don't sell those trucks if you can't guarantee they arrive on time or at least reasonably close. A trucking company can't just sit out and wait for an extra year or even 6 months because Tesla has production problems again. Being super vague and cutting that presentation short in favor of a sports car is not a good sign either. There is a reason Tesla's stock didn't really change that much. Investors and analysts realize that none of those reveals actually mean anything and are primarily distractions from the Model 3 problems. "

"i was scrolling and scrolling thinking "" Am i the only one who noticed this improvement??? Elon is usually really bad at speaking in public, you can feel the nervousness, he either was slightly inebriated or REALLY worked hard on his skills. 

Maybe there is a third reason, he was confident. Confident that Model 3 is underway, confident that the Semi will attract a lot of customers, confident the Roadster 2.0 will blow out of the water any competition...The Porsche Mission E was supposed to be this Tesla killer...it has a 3,5sec 0-60 time...now that think sounds slow AF..."

"Yeah, I'm not saying the semi should get the same attention.  Only noting that showing it the same night felt a little counterproductive, in terms of buzz for the semi.

It's clear that more people would feel more strongly about the roadster, which is exactly why it'd overshadow the truck.

Nonetheless, it was an amazing way to end an event."
"Many folks here who will never drive a semi were plenty interested in the semi event.  It's a little dismissive to suggest that the semi product doesn't deserve the same attention.

Nonetheless, I entirely understand why it's getting the attention.  I myself went from being subtly impressed with the semi unveil to picking my jaw up off the floor as they revealed the Roadster.  However, whether it deserves the attention was never my point.  It totally does.  In fact, knowing full well how much more attention this would get than the semi was precisely my point."
I think they're implying that whatever form-factor allows a 200 kWh battery pack to fit in the new roadster will allow an S or X to have a larger than 100 kWh battery.
Probably at the end of this generation.

See.. you call others out on apparently not having had time to watch a presentation. ***I*** will call you out on having no clue about what you're talking because you apparently didn't research the statement before posting it.

A single diesel tank filling can regularly and reliably last you 1.000 miles compared to those measly 500 miles. Sorry. That's just reality and the facts hitting back.

I really like Tesla but stating 500 miles was some great achievement when in truth it's a massive failing is simply coming across as a douche when calling out others on stuff. It's not even that you weren't technically correct.. just entirely in the opposite way you thought you'd be :P"
"Why do you insult me?  I ask questions because no, I have not had the time to watch the presentation.  Please explain to me then with source material, especially about the inclines.  Industry has all sorts of hybrids and is working on EV long haulers as well.  500 miles is also achievable.  Tell me what is truly revolutionary other than a bunch of rich people will buy new teslas.  Also WTF is the verge"
"The answer I wanted :)

And I called it a circle jerk at the time of my comment because it simply was.  There was limited discussion and only comments going ""wow amazing!  Tesla #1!""  So instantly I'm skeptical of bots.

Got me the answers I wanted without my comment getting buried in the ""wow amazing!""s.  Was it a good way to do it?  No, but it worked and saved me having to watch the entire presentation."

"Judging from Euro Truck Sim 2, you can get a used truck for 100K. So in the short term and medium term, I think it's still cheaper to go diesel. Most people I doubt can make the long term investment that an electric semi requires. I could be wrong though! Please prove me wrong. I want to be wrong..."
Elon claims the semi will last 1M miles but look at the reliability and service problems model s owners are facing.  
"The semi is very important for lowering carbon emissions/pollution/oil dependence. I'm just shouting things, don't mind me."
"Really? He really mumbles, trails off, pauses during mid sentence and forgets words? I expected it to be in the news he was acting so weird lol"
"So lead technicians and owner advisors are going to speed up production? They eliminated people throughout the company, not just in Fremont. They don‚Äôt need to speed up production, they need to focus on building them right the first time, and ship them off the line. There is a reason Toyota and gm walked away from that factory.. the location is over ruled by computer professionals, and there‚Äôs no skilled labor left there to supply the manpower to build cars. If they fired for incompetency they would have lost half of their production workers."
"I work in transportation, have for years. 

I can tell you EV trucks are being watched, but it's not going anywhere precisely for this reason.

Shipping routes don't end in a 500 mi radius. And after a year or two, that truck isn't gonna be able to make that 250 mi run either. It'll fall short.

If you fail to see the difference between a consumer vehicle and commercial one that is costing the company money for every hour it's not able to be utilized, then this conversation is lost on you."
I think he's talking about the 0-100mph time.     /s
We will see in the long run... but they are not really as innovative as they make it up... and things are not always as shiny as they look.
Except for when you are getting a paycheck from said company 
I am honestly optimistic about Tesla being able to pull it off. It will take time but I am sure it will happen. Thats going to be ~~revolutionary~~ even more revolutionary!

Yes a driver needs to take 30 minute breaks. So they will be required to take one at a charge station? Where they at? Trucks need to be about to go literally everywhere there are people. The charging station network to allow that would take unimaginable effort to establish."

"Because whoever owns Ustream (IBM) is paying alot of money to Tesla to host their unveil on their platform.

Was this a product feature I missed during a blip in the stream?
"> I think the big 5 will be more focused on Tesla's production woes

Exactly. If the Big 5 can get affordable EVs to market with reasonable ranges, service life and features they'll capture all of the business Tesla loses with being a horrendous producer.

We'll drop our Model 3 res in a heartbeat if something even remotely comparable comes along.  Availability and production capacity trump pipe dreams and promises every day of the week for most consumers."
That's the wholesale price for recharging the Semi. Presumably dropping $200k+ on the Roadster should get you free access to the Supercharger network?
"And gladly (for me, at least), these are a few years out, giving them time to really work in the model 3."
Rolls Royce already has an electric Phantom on the way.
Is there anything known about the Y yet? Will it be even more affordable or will it be something else entirely (pick up truck maybe)?
Now we wait for them to figure out how to manufacture in quantity.
Just like Amazon did. Reinvest everything in R&D and then destroy all other competitors. 
"This all hinges on model 3. 400m a quarter is a hell of a lot, but with 100,000 3s in that time, I suspect they can close that gap. If they don't solve production hell, they will be finished unless they can keep investors on their side. "
"By offering a car that is so superior to the competitors that people aren't going to purchase cars from the other 5 automakers for the same reason people didn't buy horse drawn carriages in 1920. 

The Tesla big rigs are going to be sold out on the first hour and be unavailable for years.  Tesla's big rig is a ""Buy this truck and your salary immediately doubles"" kind of deal for the trucker.  No more spending $1300 per day on diesel for a long haul.  They probably split the profit 50/50 between Tesla superchargers and the truck owner.

If you could double your salary by pressing a button, would you?  This is the kind of thing that crumbles empires."
"Yes, I think that may have been the case ......

I does look like they could make one if they wanted to..."
"There‚Äôs a pretty big ‚Äúhuge truck‚Äù market where people are willing to pay 100k just for a big ass F150

You need to look up the definition of a pyramid scheme then.
"In theory, but there are some tweaks. The issue is that they‚Äôre building out the robotic manufacturing now. Once that‚Äôs complete it should be quite a bit easier, but learning while launching new vehicles is extremely difficult. "
"aaahh no it's not for me :(
"
"I think you are both right. They probably need some cash to throw at the Model 3 production and get some breathing room.  
They have likely calculated that Model 3's would already bring in a lot more money, and I assume they are severely cash-strapped at the moment."
Considering the size of the reservation fees I think this is it
"*ding ding ding*

This was a Model 3 fundraiser."
"Thank you, I was wrong. I stand corrected"
Most  of them already have 100% EV lineup in their roadmaps. Sad that Tesla was the pioneer and had to prove the concept that people want EVs‚Ä¶ but their production chops won‚Äôt be able to compete with these established automakers and they can‚Äôt bleed money forever. 
By then it will be much too late...
That's the difference between tactics and strategy. I have to believe that the big automakers do strategic planning. Why else would they suddenly start announcing major EV lineups in the coming 5-10 years? Now they have to set their aim higher because 200 mile range will soon be considered short. Style matters. Performance matters. Tesla has generations of people dreaming of buying cars Tesla cannot (yet) produce in volume. The big automakers are producing high volumes of cars nobody is dreaming about buying.
This feels like the iPhone 4 announcement. That was when I realized Apple will take over the world.
"They do have a very profound effect on the industry. Several large automakers like Volvo and VAG have plans on rolling out a range of EV's, and Nissan have already been working on EVs for a while.  
Even Toyota who was adamant that hybrids and hydrogen were the future have announced that they will make a range of EVs."
"They showed that electric cars could be fast and sexy. Two things that before Tesla came out with the roadster were simply not associated with electric vehicles. Honestly the ev1 was pretty garbage, and the Prius was a green machine."
"Meaningful impact on sales volume? Not yet.

Meaningful impact on vision and strategy? Absolutely. No one took EVs seriously until the Model S. And now with the Model 3 we see automakers shoving each other aside to announce up-coming EV models and commitments to green tech. None of that happened when the Leaf went on sale. I doubt we'd even have a Chevy Bolt if it were not for Tesla."
What is your disorder called? Does it hurt?
So you think it's reasonable to assume that in Tesla's smallest car they were able to fit double the battery capacity of their much larger top of the line s and x? There is no way this thing has double the battery capacity of a p100d.
Sort of like how iPads are big batteries with touchscreens.
"I'm not saying the capacity and density won't get to that point some day, but to have 200kwh in a car that small with today's tech seems impossible."

"Agreed, it makes him a little adorable too. However for me there is no need to ""hype"" some of the things like he does (waiting for applause, raising his arms, etc), it's just not needed imho."
Because that's cost effective 99% of the time...
Assuming team driving a trip from San Francisco to New York City stopping 30 min every 400 Miles would only add 4 hours to your trip. You could still potentially make it in under 2 days. Google maps says it take 1 day 18 hrs not including stops.
"It's ok, for the cost savings per mile 30 minutes is a piss break/lunch"
Frankly they are just going to take the drivers out of the trucks in 20-30 years. Why pay a pension health insurance benefits personal insurance for bad drivers have someone fuck up your truck and take a week to go from cost to cost when you can pay no one anything and they make the same trip in two days. That dont get tired dont fuck up their trucks ect ect ect.

"I was watching a livestream where a guy got to go into the big Semi. I suppose you could maybe fit a bed in that area, but that's about all you're gonna fit in there. "

"Haha I own a zero dsr 2016 model, it's so boss!"
Wow.  I'm impressed.  I thought with the weight of the batteries it would be much lower.
Too bad those motorcycles are completely lifeless and performance is laughable at best.
Live human flesh must be expensive crumple zone. 
Unlockable 5 seater!
"Yeah, for sure, big if. But IF Elon isn't full of shit it will be a game changer.  

Also worth noting that the 2019 Semi is just version one, it'll continue to improve. By 2025 we should have a much better vehicle. "
"Supposedly, the Roadster shown tonight already matched the specs they provided. Now I'd imagine they just need to bring the cost in-line with the pricing they advertised."
"Roadster deposit for the Founders Edition is $250000, and capped at 1000."
"$250k deposit for one Founder's edition roadster. They have 1000 reservations available for founders edition. Thus, $250 million capital raise.

(And then add on the truck reservations @$5,000 and the ""regular"" roadster reservations @$50,000)

This was a massive capital raise event for them."
Roadster deposit is 50k. 
"1. Presentation was given at 11PM ET. US stocks don't trade then. If you look at the stock and how it's trading in the premarket right now (because the market isn't open yet), it's up by 5%. But, as you said, investors are mainly concerned with the Model 3 production as of right now. Those gains could be lost within the day. I think it's important though to remember that the majority of the investor base is still behind Tesla and is OK with a few delays. The stock is up by 72% year to date and everyone already knows that Musk sets difficult timelines. They've already adjusted their expectations for that. Most people didn't even believe that the Model 3 would be launched in 2017.

2. It's true that he gives really bad timelines that are difficult to achieve. But I think it's also important to remember that several targets he has also revised upwards. For example, he had set an initial target of producing 500,000 total Tesla units (model 3, S, X) by 2020, and moved that up by 2 years. Many are skeptical that that target will be hit by 2018. But he will probably beat his initial timeline.

3. Many people believe him still, which matters a lot. Net model 3 reservations are growing. Numerous trucking companies placed orders for the semi last night, including some of the largest supply chain companies (i.e. JB Hunt)"
"In a way you are correct, but 2018 is when Tesla is supposed to grow from a more niche thing to mass-market. I guess 2019 will also be important, when you can start to see sales numbers after the initial sales/preorders of Model 3.  
  
Also pretty sure they will start to move away from the pre order model some time in the next few years when they have several existing production lines."
"Are you saying Tesla doesn‚Äôt have revenue? They make billions of dollars, they then just spend more than that on growth.  And Amazon started as a guy selling books out of his garage, if that‚Äôs not little guy what is?"
Which is a baby in the auto industry.
And still growing through re-investment.
"You seriously think their design and R&D sit idle or assist on the factory floor during production?

These things take years to develop, and the Model 3 will be nearly as ubiquitous as the BMW 3-series by the time the truck and roadster make it to production."
"That's where you're wrong kiddo. Remember how much money Tesla made with their half a million model 3 reservations? A LOT.


Elons like, let's reveal two vehicles! That kind of reservation money will last until we've got the 3 production squared out."
And maybe he is getting his d sucked again. 
"400 miles in 30 minutes is right about 1.5 MW assuming 1.875 kWh/mile, Tesla claims <2 kWh/miles on the semi page."
Might also apply to the Roadster though - given its 600+ mile range.
"Myself included - it's yet another disruption coming down the pipeline and a positive step forward in the world, so everybody *should* be excited (and are). But the semi is exciting in concept and theory, but the Roadster is just plain exciting. "
It makes sense. I mean they are canceling the 75kWh S. 
Tesla.
Never heard of Elon standard time?
"Yeah, when Elon estimates 3 years, those are Martian years. Roughly 6 years for us earthlings.

Common mistake to make."
Is he still that relevant? 
Could you elaborate? Not sure I follow. 
"Drivers by law can't do 1000 miles straight through - they have to take a 30 minute break during the day, during which time the semi-specific ""Megacharger"" will recharge 80% of capacity, or 400 miles.  Did you watch the presentation?"
Watch the presentation
Just watch when u have time lol. Also you weren‚Äôt being insulted üôÑ
"You came into the thread with all these doomsday questions ‚Äúwhat about hills!‚Äù when everyone else in the thread already has the answer to that question because we all watched the presentation. Like‚Ä¶ what? What are you doing? Rather than act like the sky is falling when you genuinely, factually have no clue what you‚Äôre talking about (because you didn‚Äôt watch the presentation), you could‚Äôve just said ‚Äúhey guys, didn‚Äôt get a chance to watch, did they say anything about how this semi will handle steep hills and such?‚Äù"
I agree with you (have looked into this subject quite a bit) but honestly I would have called 620 miles of range and 1.9s 0-60 highly unlikely as well. These Tesla engineers are on another level. 
It also involves all those engineering tradeoffs that maybe wouldn't be so great for driving at slower speeds.  Do you really want to drive around what's essentially an *extremely* low altitude aircraft?
"> GMC Top Kick

[This?](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7dils3/picture_of_the_tesla_pickup_truck_from_the_event/)

It looks even bigger than the white semi.  
And if he's talking about the even smaller one in the back it's not a tesla because it has side view mirrors."

"Car and driver said 261 is the top speed for the Chiron and that it costs 3 million dollars. Even if the top speed is 285 like you said, the difference between $250,000 and $3,000,000 is also quite big. I'm just pointing out that for the cost, this thing does really friggen well."
Well I think the point is really cost of operation not purchase price. Your 100K truck will still cost $70K/year in fuel + regular maintenance and much shorter lifespan

"They don't claim to be innovative.  Elon himself has repeatedly asked why others aren't doing this stuff, specifically because it's so easy compared to ICE vehicles.  If college students can do EV conversions, why can't auto companies with billions of dollars and dedicated engineering teams?   
Meanwhile, the Model S *still* doesn't have competition, and it's 5 years old.  "
"Why build planes? 

Short range - Cars. Medium range - Hyperloop (as fast as normal sub-sonic planes). Long range - Earth to Earth Rockets (as advertised by Space X a couple weeks ago)."
"It'll mean using beamed power, most likely. 747 would need about 90 megawatts of power to be equivalent for takeoff, and ~30 megawatts for cruise. Just going off straight liquid hydrocarbon equivalents, you'd need 1,700,000 kWh of battery."
Lilium already do this. Interestingly they have heavy investment from Tencent who is also heavily invested in Tesla.
"If graphene storage gets pulled off, then it‚Äôll happen and likely relatively soon.  The problem I think is the weight of the packs.  A model 3 is like 1000 lbs more than a Honda Civic  (I think that‚Äôs a good size comparison?)

Translate that to a Cessna 172-sized plane, which has a maximum takeoff and landing weight of 2,550 lbs and weighs approximately 1,685 before putting fuel in the tank, luggage in the storage compartment, or the pilot and passengers.

Basically what I‚Äôm saying is that they would have to reduce the weight significantly, which might be achieved utilizing Graphene.  Li Ion is heavy."
BULLETBALL
"*rEVolutionary

-FTFY"
"Well,as much as I hope we can see it ""soon"", planes are probably the hardest thing to electrify.

Personally I don't think it's possible to do it yet, with the current technology (at least commercial planes, the small ones may be sooner) as planes need a huge amount of power, and that means that they would consume a lot energy from the battery, so we would need huge batteries (or many), which, with the current technology would mean a lot of extra weight, and this would make the plane need more power.

And so on. So I would love to see it, but that will probably be the last thing that gets done, and it will take some time."
"As much of a Tesla fanboy as I am, It's a nice thought but the physics behind electric airplanes stops that from being a reality. Electric airplanes are obviously possible, but they will never be more efficient than dinosaur powered aircraft "
"> I am honestly optimistic about Tesla being able to pull it off.

Let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet, they can barely manage to make cars without them falling to bits and being behind schedule."
Not until they achieve real breakthrough in battery tech though...
Aviation insider here. Not going to happen. Energy density is an order of magnitude behind what is required for anything useful.
"Insufficient, try ""even most revolutionarier""."
"Maybe Tesla will be able to pull it off but I don't think Musk will be in charge if it happens. Looking at the financials and their issues with the model 3.

If Tesla's next quarterly report is just as bad as this last and they announce they need to raise capital it will kill the stock which is heavily shorted which trigger a vicious cycle which bankrupts the company.

If they have another bad quarter I see them going to go look for a buyer to save itself. Apple makes perfect sense has cash to burn and failed in their attempt at autonomous driving.


"
"Every mode of transportation willl be electric as batteries improve.  Batteries are the only limiting factor right now.

Plus I would imagine jet fuel prices are going to go way up if we get regular cars off oil and now less consumers are funding oil exporation, drilling, and refining."
The energy density of a battery is waaaay behind that of current fuels.  That‚Äôll be the biggest challenge.
"I remember him saying, and I kid you not, Supersonic electric passenger jets capable of VTOL. No joke. And when he said it he added, ""I have a pretty good idea for how this could work, using engines on a gimble, but I'm busy with a lot of other things right now. Maybe after Model 3, and stuff on mars and Neural Net I'll have time."""
"If you check out the YouTube channels Wendover Productions and Cold Fusion they have some great videos on electric planes and the future of plane travel.   

Putting them together it seems logical to me that small-scale airplanes are definitely going to go electric first. After that the big questions becomes whether it's a question of scaling up or if it's going to change air travel as we know it and make the biggest passenger jets obsolete or at least less relevant."
It would make a lot of sense with electric prop planes for short distances of 1000 miles or less. Jets barely make it to cruising speed anyway in that distance.
Most jets these days have very high bypass anyway. Or you could use electricity to heat the air instead of burning fuel.
"That would make sense, the fuel economy on private jets is ridiculously poor compared to commercial - mostly due to having to shift very few people in a still very heavy plane.

Might make chartered flights more viable... :o"
That's some bad foreshadowing
"We call it ""Titanic With Wings!"""
"It's strange that they put that line in though, since Arc reactor in the movies can out put so much energy that it dwarfs a solar/battery based design.

Tony could have made a less powerful version of arc reactor and made it public, If the chest piece version was too dangerous/patented for public use."
"I've looked. They have neither the range nor the style. Soon, maybe."
"Well, we are making progress: you gave up the ‚Äòzero emissions‚Äô claim. 

Not sure how you define ‚Äòcleanest‚Äô but heavy duty trucks emit more particulates and CO per mile than passenger cars. And the exhaust emissions, even at idle, are higher than ambient pollution levels in any city in the developed world. 

All of that said, heavy duty trucks have come a long way in a short period of time. It is amazing how much cleaner the new trucks are compared to the ones made just 15 years ago. 

I think the Tesla is an 80-20 vehicle: designed for 80% of the needs. 

Like any other electric vehicle, charging infrastructure is going to be crucial. You can‚Äôt drive 60 miles out of your way just to charge. The current Supercharger model isn‚Äôt going to work for semis. "

The reservation cost for the founders series is also the full price of the car. They just want the full payment upfront.

I wouldn't say it's safe to assume that it is fully loaded. Also no real way to guess the cost of upgrades.

"As great as the products are, Tesla has shown over and over that they couldn't deliver a baby on time."
I doubt they will have an automated assembly line for the new Roadster so I wouldn't expect much for delays.
"Correct.  Under US accounting rules, you don‚Äôt consider it a ‚Äúsale‚Äù until you actually provide the product or service.  So reservations or prepaid stuff is cash in, but it just sits on the balance sheet as a prepaid revenue until the company provides the service/product and THEN it is moved to the income statement for that quarter.   So Tesla has a large line-item on its balance sheet for reservations, but very few Model 3 ‚Äúsales‚Äù have been recorded on their books.   Note that Tesla can definitely spend the cash.  Just can‚Äôt call it income or profit.

Regarding taxes, I am not as certain.  Taxes follow book-income to a degree, but they‚Äôre not the same.  So the IRS might well consider the $1,000 deposits taxable even if they are not ‚ÄúGAAP‚Äù accounting income.  (‚ÄúGAAP‚Äù is what US accountants and investors use.)"
"Nope, customer reservation deposits are put into a ‚Äòdeposit‚Äô account where they are held until the car is delivered at which time revenue is earned and taxes are assessed. "
That's not correct.
"They can only fulfill current orders (like the Model 3) if they continue to get new preorders (and other cash injections).  In a Ponzi scheme, you can only pay out current investors by getting new investors' cash.  "

"I mean, the carerra gt was an inherently hard to drive and unforgiving car. It doesn't have things like stability control because it makes it more ""fun to drive."" We can argue all day about whether that's truely more fun, but the reason paul walker crashed was that the Carerra GT is not a modern car with modern safety features. If he had been driving a modern super car with modern safety features I doubt he would be dead."
Paul walker's CGT had zero computers involved in power moderating safety.  Tesla has *tons*.  Drive to the middle of a huge parking lot and turn off the traction control in your Model S.  Then try to drive out of the parking lot.  Odds are you don't even make it to the road before you realize how bad an idea it would be to try this on a public street.  Traction is heavily involved in driving 600+ horsepower...  and Walker's friend had no experience without it.

"Amazon was profitable, they just kept spending to expand. Tesla has never been in Amazon's financial position. "
"I remember somebody pointing out that wasn't the issue, it's that the company was structurally unprofitable. I'm not sure how accurate that is though.

I made that comparison to Amazon myself"
Thank you. This is a great comparison.
Jeff Who?
"So many of these discussions about Tesla and their profitability are inaccurate. Tesla is unprofitable right now partly because they have all of the capital expenditures related to a car startup trying to create the infrastructure necessary to support a radically new vehicle - superchargers, support centers, and most importantly, the manufacturing capabilities - but they don't YET have the revenue that comes from producing hundreds of thousands of vehicles a year. 

So what happens from an accounting perspective is that Tesla is incurring up-front costs without any of the revenue yet. But once they start producing those hundreds of thousands of cars and selling them, they will very quickly turn profitable as the revenue begins to cover those fixed costs (which are largely fixed and not variable). 

This discussion of them not being efficient is just plain wrong. They are losing money right now in large part because ANY car startup would be losing money. A key question is whether they will be able to turn profitable before they lose investor support. And how their production ramp is going

My heart hurts when I see so many redditors throwing out opinions on stocks without having any background in equity analysis. It matters because there is SO much more to analyzing a company than just simply looking at current profitability."
The advantage they have is that their investors are extremely loyal. I can‚Äôt fathom a situation that would warrant a sale of my stock. 
"> The Tesla big rigs are going to be sold out on the first hour and be unavailable for years. 

Only because they can't manufacture enough of them. And no-one's going to take a million mile no breakdown guarantee seriously when they can't even make ordinary cars that don't break down all the time."
"And someone else brought up Amazon.

"What range advantage does Tesla have over other manufacturers? As far as I'm aware, they don't own the IP to any special battery, or any special motors. So why would other manufacturers not be able to make vehicles with similar range and performance?

>The big automakers are producing high volumes of cars nobody is dreaming about buying.

They're not dreaming about buying them, they *are* buying them."
"Apple already had a strong, decades-long track record of mass manufacturing and a viable business model. Tesla is so far a niche manufacturer struggling to become a major one. There's a difference between a tech startup and a big car company."
It‚Äôs all buzzwords and empty promises. 
Being the only sane person in a sea of delusion does hurt.
"Yes, the battery takes up a pretty small percentage of the cars volume. The constraint on the p100d is cost, not battery size."

"Wait, are you being sarcastic? Is team driving cost effective?

"I think you're being massively pessimistic saying it'll be 20-30 years. I'm certain it'll be less than 10, and *most* of that time will be waiting for 50 different state legislatures to allow it.

"I've seen comments that there were two versions of the truck there. One was a sleeper cab and the other wasn't.

Are those comments incorrect?

Either way I'd still expect they're not going to release a truck that's missing expected items that are in current trucks.

HUDs don't count! :("
"A couple models go 0-60 in less than 4 seconds. Which I think is good performance. But opinions are like assholes, everybody has one and they all stink. "
Ah ok thanks for the clarification. Are they allowed to spend it tho? Did they spend M3's reservation deposits? They are refundable.
Musk changed the definition of launch. Just because they made a few hundred prototypes does not mean the car was launched. Other major Automotive companies will make approximately thousand cars to  ensure that they are defect free. And if so they will begin mass production.
Worth more than Ford...
"Ok sure you're right.  Nothing wrong with the design group coming out with protos.  Nice that it raises some loot.  I mean everyone not in the LA design studio, which is the vast  majority, should be laser focused on model 3.  "
Who needs secondary offerings and lines of credit when you can just hoard more reservation deposits!
Tesla is currently burning through a billion dollars of cash per quarter. This must be setting some kind of world record. They need to ramp up the model3.
"If anything, that's just more reason to give the semi it's own night to shine instead of combining them.

I don't know if I agree about one being ""concept and theory"".  You'll see a semi at least a year before you ever see the Roadster.  And, in the end, the Roadster may very well end up being the more rare of the vehicles.

I'm not saying it was a mistake.  I'm just curious how much they considered the effect of one overshadowing the other.  Of course, there's always the angle that folks in the trucking industry would have been just as wowed with the Roadster as everyone else, and they anticipated that buzz might get some people to open the door to doing some introductory deals with Tesla to at least trial a few in their fleet."
Where have they stated this? I doubt they will leave the 100kw as the only option.
"I dont know. I hated him even before his controversies. He isn't funny but apparently a lot of people think he is. To each his own, but I sense that it got to his head. He got fired from BBC and is now making a car show for Amazon or something. "
"4 seaters are cheaper to insure than 2 seaters / coupes.  I'm being cheeky, Roadster buyers don't care about insurance prices I'm sure."
"None of this is relevant to what I stated. I am calling the dude out because he pretends 500 miles would be an achievement. It is not. It's far less than the industry standards. This is about (fuel) efficiency and being an equally pedantic person.
"
"I agree, I went about this poorly and I apologize and hope to learn from my mistake of being a bit of a dick"
"As I just said above, I think telsa would have boasted about unofficially holding the land speed record ([which was just recently set at 277 mph](https://www.gtplanet.net/koenigsegg-smashes-production-car-speed-record-277mph-run/)) if they were able to.

If they can't beat 277 mph its unlikely they're breaking 300mph soon."
"Just so we know what we're talking about here, top speed is related to the cube of horsepower.  So 300 mph requires 73% more horsepower than 250 mph."
"I think that a 1.8-1.9 0-60 is more easily possible than 300 MPH.  For those acceleration times, you start to worry about traction above all else.  Perfect power control and distribution to all four wheels is essential.  This is the concern to me.  Open differentials and brake torque vectoring isn't going to cut it here, so I am expecting to see per-wheel motors in this case.  Tires are also going to need some work, since contact patch starts to become an issue.

I seem to recall a video on the subject made by a well known youtube personality, and he explains most things better than I do.  I need to find where this is.

620 miles of range is easily possible if battery energy/weight ratio is good enough."
It's also an interesting perspective because these same tradeoffs apply to airplanes.
"wow you're a total asshat, where's your famed social acceptance and welcoming demeanor"
">The Chiron's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph) for safety reasons. The anticipated full top speed of the Bugatti Chiron is believed to be around 463 km/h (288 mph).

I get what you mean about the price, but to be honest, I don't think there are more than a handful of people that actually drive them to the max speed, most of them being test drivers. So really it's not about the customers and how much they have to pay but rather about the car itself and the engineering. So comparing the two, obviously the Chiron is something else that just defies physics, because once you get to 250 mph, every extra mph is an engineering feat, so just imagine getting to 288. But then again, the fact that a Tesla, which is fully electrical, can get past 250 is VERY impressive. I mean, you just have to look back to 10 years ago, when electric cars were a joke when it came to speed. Both are incredible, but only one is going to get the record, and I bet it's the Chiron. "
"Well, at least in Euro Truck Sim 2, fuel costs are paid for by the clients or the shipping company, not the driver. Maintenance, not sure about. But again, not everyone can make the long term investment, so paying less short term makes more sense, even if you end up paying more overall."
"30 minute recharge? Without exact battery specs even at a 400 kW charging station the truck would take a minimum of around 3 hours to fully charge probably more like 5. Again, we have no actual battery stats. This is all assuming their energy usage of <2 kWh/mi figure is accurate.

You are talking stopping for 30 minutes every 100 miles after the initial 500?

Drivers can drive 10 hours each day, refueling cannot be considered part of their break so it would take away from that 4 hour clock. 

A 1000 mile run is a two day trip for a solo driver. With the tesla truck you are looking at 2 1/2 - days. Miles are money, and this can't get as many miles in the same amount of time as a diesel.

Like I said, it'll be a good thing for local drivers, but not OTR. Not yet."
Earth to earth rockets really only make sense for travel between continents. Too much hassle for a 4 hour flight.
"Because it can run on clean renewable energy. Rockets still burn fuel and require lots of new infrastructure to operate at a large scale. Electric planes can potentially run with existing infrastructure! (I'm making guesses here, haven't researched this in detail)"
"Hyperloop is still a big if, though."
The logistics involved in installing hyperloops in the first place is what's going to drag implementation.    I think it makes sense to work on a bridging tech like electric planes.  
"You cannot make hyperloops all over the place, those will be reserved for intercity travel between lager cities.  
  
I think there will be battery-planes in the future, it all depends on the weight/power ratio etc.  
A small battery-powered plane would be able to serve rural areas with minimal costs comparing to traditional planes."
GA aircraft are pretty practical once you remove the high cost of fuel.
Because there is a lot of existing infrastructure for planes. And electric machines perform very nicely at altitude (perhaps minus the arcing potential)
Because airstrips and airports already exist and are cheap methods of travel. The hyperloop will be really costly to implement on that scale.
Short range - planes. Medium range - fast planes. Long range - rocket planes.
Difficult terrain.
"They may just build the engines/battery packs and license the tech out to the aerospace industry. 

I see a possibility for them to do planes, but the cost of entry is very high and I think they need to gain some capital through other ventures before jumping into that world. 

It‚Äôll be interesting to see if other outside industries start to view Tesla as a threat and start ramping up their own tech. "
Electric spaceships then!
"I‚Äôm sorry? Rockets are:

‚Ä¢ Practically impossible to land

‚Ä¢ Not very efficient (hundreds of tons of weight for seven *crew members* - not civilians; meanwhile a Dodge Grand Caravan weighs less than two tons and also carries seven people)

‚Ä¢ Need extensive crew preparation

‚Ä¢ Need extensive maintenance

‚Ä¢ Operate in quite dangerous environments

‚Ä¢ Expensive

Rockets are a scientific thing, and it‚Äôs going to be at least many decades until they become civilian transportation, although it will definitely happen, eventually.
"
"You also have places that are 400-2000 miles away that some people want to go but not nearly enough of them to develop a mass transit between them.  At a certain point flying ECE is more efficient in time,energy,money to driving even an auto pilot electric car.  An electric airplane would make that even more efficient.  

Electric airplane or even a hybrid would be useful.  Right now they have to make a trade off on jets.  Fuel efficient at altitude/power at takeoff.  Let's say you do a ECE Jet for max economy at altitude, and electric turbo fans for takeoff and climb.  10,000 HP for only 10min at a time, then recharge.  Put batteries in nacel with the motor, in case of fire you could even set up a eject option.  Thats impractical for Jet engines due to the tons of integration needed with fuel, Hydraulic, Bypass Air, and everything else.  All you would need with a battery/motor connection is a network cable.   "
"You can't build hyperloops everywhere. Even if it's cheaper than existing high speed rail technology, you are still constructing a line connecting two spots. That's expensive and fixed. For something like San Francisco to LA it makes sense. May not make as  much sense when you are let's saying going from Chicago to Nashville, TN. Or even smaller towns and remote areas.

Earth-to-Earth rockets likely have other constraints (built off the coasts, overhead with transportation connections to the rockets, limits in how often you can launch, etc), and are designed for super-long distances.

It's really the same reason why self-driving cars will likely work in conjunction with trains and rails. One is *auto*-motive, the other one works on fixed routes."
Planes because of oceans 
"Hyperloop is good for a few passengers at a time, to very fixed destinations.

Hyperloop is not good for cargo.

Most places more than 1 state away I'd rather fly than drive, even if I have full capability of driving the distance.

Earth to Earth rockets are not something you'll (be able to) take from Denver to Nashville, or Frankfurt to London.

Earth to Earth rockets will remain extremely expensive for the foreseeable future. They will come down in price, as all things do, but Earth to Earth rockets are a long shot idea for a rocket system whose *prototype* has yet to be built.

There are a lot of reasons to build planes."
"Electric will (probably) never replace long haul jumbos, but a lot of short haul stuff is ripe for EV aircraft. Esp after a few more years of battery tech improvements."
"Your math is somewhat off. 
90 megawatt for say 15 minutes is 22.5MWh. 
A 15 hour cruise at 30MW is 450MWh. Total 472.5MWh. Double for safety is still only 950MWh or almost half what you have quoted. 
Yes that‚Äôs heavy, but with batteries improving so fast it‚Äôs maybe only 15-30 years away. FYI the A380 took more than 20 years to develop so an electric airframe will be similar. 
"
"Yup. The energy density per kg of our best batteries is a fraction of that of even petrol or diesel. Sorry of turning the fuselage into a big battery (elons suggestion) it would be difficult.

But perfecting energy transfer by laser would be an overnight game changer. A 1x1m dome at the bottom of the craft that laser energy was fired into in a non-dangerous, high energy and efficient way would revolutionise the direction of the industry. That and beaming energy to earth from space"
"Elon has another idea, he has talked alot about them, lot's of unnessesary weight in airplanes"
"Put a nuclear reactor in there, should give plenty of juice."
"You shouldn't look towards massive usual airplanes, they will probably be tiltwing/vtol craft, using a cable for liftoff and solar/batteries for regular flight (heck maybe by that time even fission batteries) the long distance runs will probably be done with his new rockets, or with hyperloops. It's gonna change the entire transport sector, and I am very much looking forward to it"
"You're thinking as though there's some rule in physics which says that all planes must have proportions similar to a 747. We're not quite there yet, but the point where it'll be more economical to have an electric jet with 70% of it's weight in battery is not that far off. Jet fuel and engines are not cheap."
Great scottt
"The whole point to electric aircraft is that it's an improvement on the physics, not just a direct replacement. That would be pointless.

Electric plane can fly higher than 35,000 ft because it doesn't need oxygen for combustion. Air resistance would be less and power required for cruise is cubed to the air resistance. "
"You are not accounting for the vast efficiency improvements. Current designs use five 400kW machines per wing, each pushing 99.4% efficiency, these are currently being prototyped."
Very neat! Hopefully we can see them go into public use soon. Thanks for sharing

The bolt is nasty. 
"I was in the same boat you are not too long ago, but honestly the Bolt is a small car, and it's a Chevy. If you just want an affordable EV with 200+ miles of range, then get a Bolt. If you want a *Tesla*, then Bolt might not be that appealing."

"Battery tech. The Phantom 7 weighed nearly 6000lbs. If it had a Model S battery pack, it would be nearing on the limit of most residential bridges in neighborhoods that have a 7000lbs limit."
The difference is that Amazon chooses not to make a profit by spending buckets of money on crazy new business ventures. All they have to do is turn off the spigot to take in the cash. Tesla has no way to do that.

"> I remember somebody pointing out that wasn't the issue, it's that the company was structurally unprofitable.

Tesla is not just reinvesting though... They are issuing more stock and taking on debt.
"I like Tesla and wish them the best. 

But it‚Äôs an awful comparison. Tesla is in a far more precarious position than Amazon ever was. "
"You're really going to start with this:

>So many of these discussions about Tesla and their profitability are inaccurate. 

And follow it up with this?

>Tesla is unprofitable right now partly because they have all of the capital expenditures related to a car startup trying to create the infrastructure necessary to support a radically new vehicle - superchargers, support centers, and most importantly, the manufacturing capabilities - but they don't YET have the revenue that comes from producing hundreds of thousands of vehicles a year. So what happens from an accounting perspective is that Tesla is incurring up-front costs without any of the revenue yet.

That's fundamentally incorrect.  Capital expenditures are under cash flows, not operations.  They don't affect profitability like that.  That's accounting 101."
This is why they are over valued.
"You save capex moving to aws, not necessarily opex but your point is a good one."
It's a subtle difference. Wait until Model 3 hits volume and is visible all over the roads.
"Mabee, but I doubt it. The writing is on the wall.  
If they did not produce good EV's very soon, Tesla would swallow the car market.  
  
AFAIK - most manufacturers are waitting for battery packs at or below $100 per kWh. That price point is expected in 2020.  
According to what I have heard, the price of Model 3 packs are at about $135/kWh, and well below current industry average.  
  
The flaw most of the car industry is doing, is to wait until production costs for ICE and EV's are the same, and expect sub-contractors like Bosh to develop ready systems in stead of being more aggressive about developing it and reduce costs.  
Not to mention that they don't factor in that people are willing to pay a premium for an EV with decent range.  
  
Many EV's today may be considered test-cases or compliance vehicles to fulfill regulations - The Bolt is a decent car, but it's way to expensive to make, and is there to get CO2 credits.  
Leaf on the other hand, have struck a nice balance, and I think Nissan are making money from them.  
  
National policies are also a part, and might be why Toyota have been so keen on hydrogen. I suspect this is because Japan have huge untapped methane reserves trapped in ice at deep waters around it's continental shelf."
"Your metric for meaningful impact is only complete overnight market domination and consumer level interplantary space travel... I'm sure its some sort of cognitive bias that you are suffering from but its hard to say exactly what it is. Either way, there is no shame in getting help.

If it helps... 

Cars: Even reaching 10% market share in the next decade would be incredibly impressive and would constitute an extremely meaningful impact. 

Space: The technology is still being refined, we just started landing and reusing rockets. This will have a meaningful impact on cost. Until nuclear fusion is sorted out space travel will not become hugely profitable. There isn't enough wealth available and costs are still too high to fly to mars for the weekend right now. "
The model S battery is almost the whole bottom of the car. Fitting double the amount of battery in a car a fraction of the size is a bit far fetched if you ask me.
"I think it's feasible after a 5-10 more years of energy density improvements, but not with tech today."

"Yeah I was being sarcastic. Team driving isn't the standard I don't believe. 

I truly don't get the range argument. No one drives a diesel 1,000 miles without stopping. And a Tesla truck can go 900 miles with one 30 minute break. That seems to be a more than acceptable ""delay"" especially when coupled with 20% lower operating costs and no pollution. What am I missing? "

"No there are 2 versions, one with a cowl and one without. As of right now there is no sleeper cab, Tesla have said they can add one eventually, but there isn't one now."
"It's not an opinion, that's not particularly fast especially given that it's a metric that ought to be exceptional given the nature of electric motors, and it's also not the performance metric that matters. How well does it go around the twisties? I can answer that for you -- not well at all. Why would you want one? As a commuter, except that they're not particularly comfortable for that purpose either."
"They can spend it, they just have to report it as a liability on their balance sheet."
Name checks out...
"He clearly stated that the initial cars produced would be in the hundreds. Whether you call that a launch or not isn't really as important, in my mind, since they are still ahead of expectations. 

At what point does it constitute a launch? Does producing a thousand cars a week fit your definition of a launch? Cause that's what they're targeting by the end of 2017, which is still ahead of what investors initially expected"
"Stocks are priced for future earning potential. Hype, sure. But because people believe they can get there."
Doesn‚Äôt mean that they aren‚Äôt. Different people have different jobs. The ones on the Model 3 lines (which will be the majority once production is maxed) will be focusing on that. The ones that will be on the semi and roadster lines will be focused on that. 
You must be boring at parties
"What I meant was that most people won't ever be directly and perceptively affected by the semi. People will see them on the roads, but most will never sit in one, purchase one, or have one generally affect their daily life. However, what it means for the world and for progress is what makes the semi exciting.

I'm not sure the Roadster took the wind out of the semi's sails though, it's just that even folks that are not Tesla fanatics can get excited about it too. No one that was previously excited is any less excited for the semi, there is just more to be excited about than expected. "
maybe it was just the [cheepest 75kwh model s](http://www.thedrive.com/sheetmetal/14589/tesla-discontinues-cheapest-model-s-further-widening-price-gap-to-model-3) thing from September that I was remembering.

"500 Miles *for an EV* is a massive achievement. Sure Diesel engines *can* go farther, but they don‚Äôt, because they‚Äôre forced to stop. So it‚Äôs a moot point. And Tesla achieving more than the required range to meet the current legal stopping requirement, without introducing new or more frequent stopping, makes it so the logistics of modern trucking are only improved, not hindered. That **is** a huge achievement."
"Hey, happens to the best of us, my man. Good on you for recognizing it. "
"‚Äú620 miles of range is easily possible‚Äù dude if that was true, we‚Äôd have lots of EVs near that range. "
"100% agree. The fact that any car can break 200 is impressive. Fastest I've done is 140 and I won't lie, it was fairly scary. 
Technology in and of itself is advancing incredibly quickly. That 10 year thing couldn't be more true. And still today people say Tesla is doomed. Have they looked where they started and how far they've come? "
"Well think about what you jus said. If I have two potential drivers I can hire to move my goods. One will charge me $70k/year in fuel, the other will charge me $0 in fuel. Who do I choose? "
Perhaps you should watch the presentation. The 30 minute for 400 mile recharge is straight from Elon's mouth.
"Elon stated 30 minutes to charge 400 miles with new Megachargers.  And as 30 minute breaks are mandatory (after x number of hours) as long we their are chargers in the right locations, it should work out. I expect he will go for putting them in truck stops but who knows."
"How come you know that - considering nobody knows the battery specs, or new charges specs. talkin out a yer behind eh?

"Rockets can run on 100% renewable energy too. Not electric propulsion; that's only viable in space.

I mean generating oxygen and methane from renewable energy. 

CO2 + H2 (by way of H2O) + e -> O2 + CH4

O2 + CH4 -> CO2 + H2O + e

It would take a lot of energy, but then, it's actually completely doable. Big energy investment, but doable. A large wind and solar installation, being constantly fed into such a generator, would produce a considerable amount of propellant. I'm not sure what the total size of the installation would be without running the numbers, but you could extrapolate a solar-only figure from the SpaceX BFR Mars ISRU proposed installation (you'd need significantly less area, because Earth gets significantly more sunlight than Mars - but you'd want to scale it upa lot anyway, because flights every once a year is not useful. Hence, adding wind to the mix, which would REALLY help)."

"> People will see them on the roads, but most will never sit in one, purchase one, or have one generally affect their daily life.

I disagree, somewhat.  Most people will never ride in a Roadster.  Meanwhile, your life would be markedly different without what trucking provides to the consumer markets.  So, the semi certainly has the ability to impact your daily life, even if you never actively are aware of it.  In that regard, the consumer awareness of the two is probably about the same, with understandably more excitement for the Roadster.  There's really no getting around the fact that high performance coupes get people excited.  A long haul truck can never stack up and generate quite the same buzz in the same way, even if the average person will never see a Roadster in person, much less ride in or drive one.

Don't get me wrong, the Roadster is definitely the more impressive of the two, and it had the element of surprise, which is probably how they wanted it.  And I'm really not trying to argue this point, I was just musing about this, from a marketing perspective.  This level of buzz could have sustained them into the new year if they'd not revealed it all at once.  Nonetheless, it probably wouldn't have made as big of a splash had they not gone all in with the two-fer like they did."

Well yeah of course
"Business is about numbers, not promises for numbers. When actual numbers are released and are demonstrable that support that claim then we can talk.

At 2 kWh/mi a 500 mile range requires a 1000 kWh battery and I don't see any 800 kW charging stations. Again, this is all speculation...*because we have no numbers*

Can't build hyperloops everywhere. And airports are already everywhere. 
Hyperloop can't beat a plane in cost for long distance. Travel twice as long with a plane and you need some more fuel. Travel twice as long with the hyperloop and you need twice the infrastructure.
Hyperloop to Hawaii?
"But the middle of the country has great wind power potential, just use that to fuel up the electric cars and use the loops on the more populated coasts, what's the problem?"
"This is orders of magnitude away from being reasonable. Nobody in their right minds would ever do this on Earth for several reasons. First, you'd need to concentrate atmospheric CO2 (or find a way to collect it from waste). Electrolysis of water, while a fun science project, is a terrible means of generating H2 (H2 is actually produced industrially from methane). You might get back a fraction of a percent of the energy you put in. Even if you had unlimited free renewable energy, other energy storage technologies will blow this out of the water as far as efficiency goes. 



"
"> Not electric propulsion; that's only viable in space.

Even then, it uses propellant.  It's just that the propellant is accelerated to very high speed using high voltage electromagnetism, rather than using expansion through combustion to generate thrust."
I don't think we want to blast copious amounts of ch4 in to the atmosphere. I'm not a climate scientist so could be very wrong but I think methane is one of the worst greenhouse gases 
That's only greenhouse neutral if the source of CO2 is the atmosphere.

"It matters though based on what you're saying. What is the definition of a launch? Again, producing over a thousand a week, does that qualify? At what point will you consider it a launch? My point is that it seems a bit silly to get caught up with the definition - model 3 production is still ahead of investor expectations, no matter which way you slice it. Investors did not even expect them to BEGIN producing any at all by the end of the year.

Big automotive car companies gradually ramp production as well. They also don't ever produce hundreds of thousands of units for lots of cars, especially since many don't even sell that well. Let's think about the Nissan Maxima for example. If you're saying that producing a thousand a week is not enough to constitute a car launch, does this car EVER launch, according to your definition?"

Very unlikely unless you only want to go a couple of places that have direct service."

"What other ""energy storage technologies"" can be used to power a rocket using renewable energy?"
"What? I'm not talking about energy storage.

As to the original point - yes, I am fully aware that there are much more economical options available (but which are not renewable, not without investment in other areas, eg. planting trees). One of my previous jobs was as a rocket engine designer, so I'd hope I knew what I was talking about. Anyway - I was simply trying to demonstrate that fully renewable rockets are *possible*."
"Yes. Xenon hall effect thrusters (other substances can be used, but xenon is easily ionised). They do indeed use propellant, but have a very high ISP as a result of that high exit velocity, and so the propellant mass required for a given delta v is much lower.

N.B. We do not yet know if reaction-less thrust is even possible. Photons are not an exception to this rule since they have relativistic mass. I guess warping spacetime with negative energy is a semi-valid approach, except that we have no idea whether it can actually exist, much less how to make it."
"Um, you wouldn't be. That's the fuel. It's used in the rocket engine. The emission is CO2, not CH4.

You're right about methane being one of the worse greenhouse gases, however.

The point of the equations above is that to make the fuel (including the oxygen to burn it), you're putting energy in - that's the *e* - and when you burn it in the engine, you get that energy back - another *e*. That's why it's completely renewable.

Same as what goes in, you get out (minus the offering for the gods of entropy üòâ), both energy and chemicals"
"Or any source that would otherwise be vented to atmosphere, yeah. And there's a lot of that."
"I should have annotated the equations, clearly, as this is the second misapprehension.

First one is synthesis. Second one is use.

The exhaust products are the same as the synthesis inputs - CO2 and H2O. Net zero change.

"Um, because it has absolutely horrible volume efficiency, and it's really difficult to keep it from boiling off for more than a couple of days, even with excellent insulation (which lowers the volume and mass efficiency even more). Moreover, it makes it basically impossible to use composite tanks, because hydrogen will just diffuse through it, and it must be stored at much, much lower temperatures, greatly weakening it and causing ruptures. It even diffuses through metals (but much more slowly), so there's that.

As a result, you end up with very large, heavy (because of the size, and insulation), expensive (because of the size) rockets. Like the Space Shuttle main tank. About 90% of that volume was liquid hydrogen. It's awful.

 SpaceX (and Blue Origin...) agrees, too; that's why their new Raptor engine uses methalox instead of hydrolox

But hey, thanks for the personal attack."
Bfr has a max capacity of several hundred people for planned global point to point suborbital flights.
You can pretty much run an existing turbofan on electric with some basic blade modifications to account for getting power through the shaft instead of combustion. I think the engines are easier than you'd expect
*Turbofan. Turbojets are inefficient.
"Turbofans are very efficient within a relatively narrow band. Thankfully that band is just right for long distance cruising, so planes like the 787 and A350 can go intercontinental distances with ease. They aren't anywhere near as efficient outside of cruise, and a huge proportion of commercial aviation involves very little real cruising. For them, the efficiency improvements of electric propulsion during takeoff, climb, descent and landing will balance against any worse cruising behaviour.

The absolute worst efficiency for jet engines is on the ground. Right now, stupid amounts of fuel are used just to push planes around on the tarmac. Since this is a really significant amount of time and fuel (and political pressure due to local noise and emissions pollution) for short haul aviation, there's already [products in development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGTS) which allow planes to drive around using electric motors installed in the landing gear. When the plane has successfully slowed down after landing, the engines can be turned off completely and the motors (+ other systems) powered solely by the APU in the tail. It's a similar story when planes are taking off.

The first 'electric' planes we'll see in commercial service will be hybrids, taking this EGTS to the next level by using electric propulsion for takeoff and landing. Instead of having two big cruise engines, you have lots of little electric propellers which can be individually controlled and retracted for cruise. Because of aerodynamic effects, these can cause massively more lift to be available at low speeds. Electric power alone will be enough for landing, which can be much steeper and quieter, and the cruise engines would work alongside it for takeoff. Since the jet engines don't need to be powerful enough for takeoff any more, they can be much smaller and more efficient at cruise."
"I read ""passed out ascent"" as ""passed out ascident"""
You realise he employs a lot of engineers who did that right? He didn't just read some textbooks then design and build a rocket by himself.
"I mean fossil fuels will eventually run out. It might not be a battery, but something renewable will have to take their place. I'm not saying in the next 20 years, but maybe in our lifetime."
"That's impressive!! Yeah if you don't need a oxygen for combustion, you can fly much higher which is far more efficient. And technically there is no limit to how has the a get engine can go, the only thing holding it back is part limitations. Things tend to fly apart when spinning so fast, and the have to spin that fast several times to be used in a passenger jet. Perhaps new materials could help."
"And electric jets are? We're talking about the future, not today."
"They're largely the same efficiency as an electric fan from torque to thrust. They're a carnot cycle engine so no more than about 45% in translating fuel energy into torque, except that they're thrust engines not shaft engines so the math is different due to the fact that you have to take a bunch of factors into account. I honestly couldn't tell you, beyond cycle efficiencies in the 30% range implies 30-35% would be doing pretty well."
"**Fermat's Last Theorem**

In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n = 1 and n = 2 have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity.

This theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. The first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians.

No car manufacturer is buying at that price. And they don't even have impressive technology anyway. Tesla is only a brand.
"Ok, now what about the $650M from SG&A, or the $330M from R&D? What about the interest expense that they're paying on the debt that they needed to take out to finance a lot of these expenditures?

It's obvious that MUCH of their expenses is related to the rollout of the Model 3. In order to be hitting the production targets that they've laid out, you need massive infrastructure to support that. Think about the superchargers throughout the nation. Think about the service centers. Think about the factories (gigafactory included) and the manufacturing processes that they had to set up. This is ALL to support mass production of a Model 3 that has not yet been built at scale at all. You can't roll out a new car without all of this set up beforehand. And that's what they've had to do over the last several years

"Did you read that source?

They stated the same thing Tesla did, it'll hit 60mph with a full load. There is no mention of energy usage in relation to full load, only speed/acceleration. You can't make an assumption like that, there's a reason they pointed out at 80k lbs weight only in regards to acceleration and not elsewhere. 

Also the math by that company shows it's worse than what I estimated. It would require 1.5 mW of power to charge that in 30mins, I estimated 800 kW. That's a lot of power, and more than triple the power of current charging stations.

EGTS (Electric Green Taxiing System) is an electric taxiing system which allows aircraft to taxi and pushback without requiring the use of aircraft engines, and is designed to reduce fuel volumes used by aircraft and reduce greenhouse gas emissions during ground operations. EGTS technology enables aircraft to avoid using their main engines during taxiing and instead taxi autonomously under their own electrical power, using the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) generator. The system is designed for single-aisle aircraft, such as the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737.

"Never said he didn't. I'm fully aware he has other people doing a lot of great work, but he's the lead designer of the company. He was and is very hands on in the development of the vehicles and spacecraft without a formal education. That's all I'm saying."

We can make fuels without pumping them from the ground. It‚Äôs just cheaper to pump it right now.
"Yes they are much more practicle. 
BFR Intercontinental would be aimed at wealthy customers in a hurry.
Rockets need quite specific weather conditions to start. For a flight like this you would need those at to points on the globe. Meaning your abillity to guarantee travel is quite low. Furthermore a rocket will not land anywhere near the city center which means you have additional travel time at both destinations. Both making this means of transport less attractive to the target audience. Then there are addtional questions. Afaik Nasa currently wants rockets to be boarded before fuelling, presumably for good reasons, meaning even more delays. Those are just the ones of the top of my head, there are probably alot more concerns."

Anyway, what I'm really getting at is that Tesla is not going to destroy the global car industry.

A lot of people see these tech companies that can come in and disrupt industries, but it doesn't work like that when you're talking about big industry.  This isn't software or even consumer electronics - this is industry which requires tens of millions of tons of metal and plastics, huge production plants, and the supply chains and infrastructure to go with it.

Tesla is struggling to ramp up to a few thousand cars per week.  Toyota makes 175,000 cars per week, and could make more if there was enough demand.  Volkswagen produces as much, if not more.  

If Tesla is a threat to any part of the auto industry, it is the high end luxury market - maybe millionaires that would have otherwise purchased a new Ferrari will consider a Roadster.  That is a fine market to be in, but it doesn't justify Tesla's market cap. "
That's what Kodak said about film right up until the end.

"You're still waiting you're just filling your time.  But if you don't road trip every day, like 99.99% of the country it's a different story.  No Tesla fills up as quickly as an ICE vehicle, period."
"What you're saying is a simple concept, but you are failing to account for the amount of time that a second person is sitting in the truck doing nothing.

"Because the stock is up 45%+% YTD and it was investor expectations at the beginning of the year that they surpassed. By last month, expectations had shifted already to expect more Model 3 units by this year since they had actually begun production by that point.......

So my point is that they are well ahead of initial investor expectations, which was for no model 3 production at all this year. Whether they surpassed shifted investor expectations over the last month is a separate and less important question, as you are focusing on a smaller, zoomed in stock price movement (the stock being down about 15% over the last month or two), whereas I am focused on the bigger picture stock price movement (the stock being up 68% over the last year, 48% YTD)

People make Tesla out to be this huge failure but they don't seem to see what they are doing in the big picture sense. Their Model 3 production is delayed by 3 months vs. investor expectations and company expectations several months ago. But they are well ahead of investor expectations at the beginning of the year, and even further ahead than where most people thought several years ago. No one even thought they'd ever produce 100,000 cars. Don't get caught up in whether they are hitting or missing these small short-term goals."
"Are you employed? Seriously no offense but I don‚Äôt see how you can call what Tesla is doing ‚Äúeasy‚Äù as an engineer, and I bet the engineers at Tesla would be insulted.

Where do they say this?

>It would require 1.5 mW of power to charge that in 30mins, I estimated 800 kW. That's a lot of power, and more than triple the power of current charging stations.

Yep.  1.4-1.6MW is the rough number most people are coming to.  Semi wouldn't use existing chargers anyways, the new ""megachargers"" would be installed at customer's locations.  Chargers are also really easy to parallel. (current superchargers use 2 in parallel to achieve 120kW)   
Honestly chargers aren't the hard part, it's the demand charges for pulling 1.6MW from the grid, which is where Powerpacks come into play.

>Do you have any clue how many factories and distribution centers there are across the country?

Yep, big potential market."
Thats a very appropriate pathetic response for a dimwit like you are.
Would it not be possible to use two? So if you wanted to go 1200 miles then just have one for the first 600 then change and go the final 600 on the second. People change trains already seems no different.
"300 miles is about how far I could go on a full tank of gas. It would take around 4 hours and use about $30 in gas. If I could make the same trip in 30 minutes, I'd pay the same as a plane ticket for that distance."
Source? 
"Hmm - that passage you cite says ""faster & cheaper"", where does the safety issue come in?"
"This is really interesting. I hope you don't mind curious questions!

The paper seems to suggest that supersonic air travel makes things cheaper at around the 900 mile point (your ballpark is 600, totally fair). But are you also assuming supersonic passenger flight? And if so, why? Why make allowances for technology that doesn't and may never exist?

Also, what is the task your student team? That sounds awesome."
Surely you just change loops in a city to go further?
"600-900 miles based on physics limitations or cost limitations?  What is the rate limiter, and why would having a transfer station not be an option interconnecting a series of hyperloops, other than the number of acceleration/deceleration cycles"
"As a complete noob to these things, could you give me a very brief summary of why they have a range limit? 

Also bit tangential, but any reason they couldn't be used sort of back to back or is it just assumed that changing to a different loop each time wouldn't be worth the hassle? 

Thanks man"
"900 miles is already about halfway across the country. Let's say we start in New York, transfer in Illinois and end in California. Even if the limit is 600 miles, it's still a decent distance across the country."
But I can do 600 miles in the roadster... no point in a hyperloop.
He suspects 900 miles is the upper limit before supersonic air travel is faster and cheaper... which doesn't exist right now. He's talking about the cost/speed not efficiency/safety.
"Could you not just have one hyperloop that ends in 600 miles and then transfers you to another? I'm not at all science-literate, so be gentle if this is a dumb question. "

"Neither does a chair in the sky, but that seems to usually work out."
"Surprisingly, most of that sounds mitigatable. The greatest risk in automobile travel is traffic accidents and those are overwhelmingly caused by driver error. More you can automate the process and take the human input out, safer it may be *especially* in a highly controlled environment, such as a traffic managed the underground. An airtight cabin with supplemental oxygen would be a start, or a portable oxygen mask that you can check out at the beginning of travel would help."

"Heheh ""pussy"""
"Not sure what your point is? 

I'm making the case that a Hyperloop would be less efficient from a cost, flexibility and safety perspective than a transport system based on electric powered light commercial aircraft. 

Road and rail transport still makes sense for moving things that aren't people, and for low speed travel for intermediate distances, but road and rail infrastructure is expensive to maintain, and it doesn't have a lot of the problems that a Hyperloop will have. 

For example every summer the rail infrastructure gets busted due to thermal expansion of the rails, a Hyperloop will suffer from the same problem, except with the added risk of catastrophic decompression of the tube. It's also a little tricky to do track work and maintenance on a Hyperloop while it's running."
"Yes, but this was about rockets, not jets. I wasn't necessarily advocating for it, simply expanding on the idea.

I agree about the jets - and especially about reducing footprint. Unfortunately, I don't think the energy density is there - not for long distance flights anyway.

I actually wonder whether fuel cells might make sense here. I don't put much stock in them for consumer vehicles, but for mass transit they do have some attractive points.

Using methane might make for a nice fuel for a cell. Can be stored as liquid for the density, and would run very cleanly. You generally want as close to / rich in hydrogen as possible, with very few impurities, so the cell lasts a long time and can generate high current."
To be fair he watches Rick and Morty. 
">We can make fuels without pumping them from the ground

Right. That would be renewable. I was talking about fossil fuels."
"> BFR Intercontinental would be aimed at wealthy customers in a hurry.

There's direct quotes that the price of a ticket will be below the ticket price of a standard economy seat on an intercontinental airline flight. So no, not rich people. That's what killed concorde.

> Rockets need quite specific weather conditions to start.

Because they're trying to eke out every ounce of performance. If you build margin in (like you would in such a situation) then you can launch in more varying weather conditions. [Also the Russians launch in the middle of blizzards.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYCIeeqCTnM) If they can do it so can anyone else, especially on a new more advanced rocket.

> Afaik Nasa currently wants rockets to be boarded before fuelling, presumably for good reasons, meaning even more delays.

That's not relevant here as this doesn't involve NASA."
They're not giant bombs when they land as they're mostly empty space. If they're liable to blow up you wouldn't be flying 100 passengers on board anyway.

" Your first paragraph is wrong. It is very widely known that bigger batteries charge and discharge faster.  The current P100 cars are limited by battery output.

It also fails to account for the time saved with the greater 65mph max speed; which by my estimate is over a 6 hour savings over a 900 mile run (5.5 if you subtract the charging break)
"Of the challenges they are dealing with, that is the easiest.

I work in telecommunications, long distance RF systems, energy management, and still own an IT company I started 20 years ago in high school."

My point here was yes, its a big market but it also requires major infrastructure development for the tesla semi to be successful, not  that it could be done.

Dude supersonic passenger flight has been around since the 70s. 
"Give him a break, he‚Äôs just a student. 

I‚Äôm assuming the cost and safety issue comes from having a six hundred mile long contiguous vacuum tube. The real implementation will have stops much shorter except for possibly the most remote or express direct lines.

There‚Äôs a lot less stuff up there and radar helps avoid the things that are. 
"I've had had the same thoughts including the fuel cells but I am not a fan. But with electric vehicles becoming more and more proficient I'm sure the energy density is going to improve drasticly, investement and research is going to start paying of."
"Even if you assume a 6 million dollar launch price and 2000 passengers, which would mean just stuffing people into a fairing without seats floors or anything and setting a maximum weight of 75kg per person, you still end up with 3000$ tickets.

While NASA is not involved I still think they might have put some thoughts into their rules. You are correct about launching in bad weather; my bad. Although I'm not sure about landing in bad weather."
"Rockets are always liable to blow up, and it'll be a bomb when taking off."
"The battery size doesn't matter as much as the rate it can output. Tesla happens to allow a higher output in the higher capacity batteries, but that doesn't mean it has to be that way for every battery. 

Musk has lied before, remember the now infamous ""3 months maybe, 6 definitely"" comment? How many months past that deadline are we now? Where are the auto wipers he promised? Musk said what he knew people wanted to hear, if it's true or not is really unknown. Musk loves to set unrealistic deadlines and goals and he loves to word things in a way to give an incorrect impression. 

Supposedly all modern Teslas are capable of full self driving, oh wait, they may need an upgraded CPU. Oh wait, not a single Tesla is capable of fully self driving yet and it remains to be seen if they ever will be. Musk is a great sales person, but not very trustworthy.

One very recent example of him being misleading is using the ""80k pounds"" number for the semi ( the max legal weight of truck +trailer) instead of the actual usable tow capacity ( which is probably less than average). Also, trying to say ""solar roof is cheaper than than regular roofs"" without mentioning you need to compare it to expensive roofs, wait 50 years, live in a very sunny area, and include electricity savings for that to be remotely true."
"But 100% of people are imperfect and forgetful and a lot of people have range anxiety regardless.  I'm all for Tesla and EVs and the sooner they gain huge market share the better but they aren't perfect replacements yet, even at $80,000, that's the reality."
">The point is, I can do something else on the rare occasions that I need to stop and charge. 

And not everyone's schedule is like that.  Some people are usually going to be in a rush or on a time frame, they're conditioned that way after quick fill ups their entire life.

>With the ICE, I needed to stop every week and stand out in the hot or cold pumping gas.

I thought this was a joke at first.  You're making a huge deal out of this.  You need to stand outside for several minutes once a week?  That's a serious problem?  Go back into your car or go into the gas station and grab a snack, problem solved.  

>The Tesla is so much more convenient, and people who haven't driven both are stating it's not as convenient like they know something.

No I'm saying that range anxiety and the idea of not being able to fill up in under 10 minutes (including wait time) at often 2-10 close stations is a real problem for many people, probably due in part to the habit of the convenience always being there and not scheduling around it during a lifetime of driving, and it holds people back from buying.  It's a well documented ""issue"" and it doesn't matter if it affects you or not. "
"That makes zero sense. You are completely ignoring the cost of the second driver. I am not in the business, so maybe there's something I'm missing. 

If you have two drivers in one truck, does that not double the cost of the drivers?

Is the driver's pay so minimal that doubling it doesn't matter compared to minimizing the truck's downtime?"
"My understanding is it would be done on a customer by customer/site by site basis.  If Walmart uses them for distribution center to store trips, they only need a charger at home base and maybe one store, assuming one truck will have multiple drops before returning.  And even then, only if the round trip is >500 miles.  Since it's a day cab, I think they're expecting it to be used primarily from a central hub, and under 500 miles/day.
 (which is easily a 10 hour day, even assuming fast unloading and minimal urban driving)"
"Right, even a 600-mile limit wouldn't be a huge deal. If prices get cheap enough I can picture people commuting 300 miles to work (and back). Imagine living and working 4 hours apart but commuting in under an hour a day."
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe they don't use any supersonic passenger planes anymore.  
  

Quick edit after re-reading your statement, I guess you were replying to the person saying the technology doesn't exist, so nevermind."
"I didn't mean to be aggressive.  I'm not an engineer nor do I have any mechanical background.  He has WAY more knowledge on this subject than I do so I was asking what I thought were legitimate questions, hoping that he would have some insight due to the project he's working on."

"I was under the impression that even next-gen battery chemistries like Li-O2 (and this is proving to be very difficult to get to work practically because of dendritic growth ruining recharge lifespan) wasn't good enough for long distance flights, unfortunately. Li-O2 is more of a fuel cell actually, because it uses oxygen from outside the cell as a reactant. A more fair comparison would be Li-S, and that's even further behind in energy density (but is nonetheless significantly better than current chemistries). I'm not sure what the solution is :("

"I don't see any costs for the ground crew looking at the spacex streams leads me to believe solely the crew in the control center is quite large and not exactly cheap. I doubt 200k in maintenance covers the restacking of ship and booster. I imagine lifting a 1300 ton 48m ship up 60m does require quite a crane. You would also have to build a lot of other entirely new ground infrastructure, which presumably doesn't come for free. Can the booster on it's own fly around the world if not, how do you transport it to Shanghai. Then there is the question of insurance. Also how do you do post flight inspections? Do you have the rocket on a rotating base? Furthermore I don't understand what they mean by pilot. I don't think humans will be capable of flying or landing the BFR."

Faster than a fucking shifter kart. Let that sink in.
It‚Äôs always doing 60mph and you have to jump in on its way by.
"To experience a semblance of what this acceleration would feel like in comfort of your own car: at sixty MPH and with plenty of open roadway, take both feet and absolutely jam the brake pedal.  Full blast, don't let up.  The ABS will maximize the braking effect and tire slip coefficient and you will come to a violent stop in about 1.9 seconds. Maybe a bit less, depending on the weight and performance capacity of your vehicle.  After you've stopped shaking and caught your breath,  now imagine that feeling as if you had mashed the accelerator."
"I wouldn't be surprised if a handful of production cars beat the 0-60 before the 2.0 is even produced to set its 1.9 second record. I was hoping Elon would hold something up his sleeve to surprise the other car companies, and it sounds like he did. "

"The grip of the street legal tires is the limiting factor. If you use racing slicks even students can build an electric car that goes 0-60 in 1.5 seconds - [check here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-NCH8ct24U).

So the question is: What tires has the roadster 2?"
[deleted]
I want the upgrade package where it tears up the space time continuum and gets to its destination before it even starts.
"Jesus fucking Christ 


I am buying one as soon as it comes out"
"So definitely more expensive tires, probably even slicks, which will be necessary for the 250mph+ top speed anyway. Those tires are about $25-$40k for a set, so definitely going to be part of a ""special package"".

Seems like Elon's idea for performance is just doubling down on better and better straight line performance, I guess if that's what EVs are great for, no point not taking advantage of it. :)

Really kinda wish them actually have a racing development division (like the M and AMG) and take performance development beyond drag strip benchmarking. 

EDIT: I was wrong, seems like for top speed purposes a $400/piece Michelin Pilot Sport 2 can handle it up to 270mph+. I guess tire tech has come a long way since the early Veyron days."
"I‚Äôm going to assume that almost all of the higher end improvements are everything other than 0-60. It‚Äôs already been established, even when the P100D was coming out, that Tesla is running to tire friction limits. Most of the Roadster 2 test runs had audible tire slip during takeoff. That will be refined through software anti-slip, but it will only get as good as friction will allow. 60 mph in 1.9 is 31.6 mph/sec. You know what? Fuck imperial units. 26.8 m/s in 1.9 seconds is 14.1 m/s^2 . But on the 0-100 mph, 44.7 m/s in 4.2  seconds is only 10.65 m/s^2 . With aerodynamic downforce and enough power overkill on the low end to compensate for the torque curve drop off at high speeds, you could pull 14 m/s^2 through the whole 0-100 mph. That would bring the time down to 3.17 seconds (which is *nutty*) down from the stated 4.2. Fuck it. 14.1 all the way down the 1/4 mile. Sqrt(2 x 14.1 x402.34) means exiting the quarter mile at 106.5 m/s (238.23 mph), doing it in 7.55, down from the stated 8.8.

Is a 7.55 quarter mile realistic? [Well... no](https://youtu.be/-K7fCQlUhj0). But it shows that focusing on cramming effort into what is essentially a glorified meter stick (who needs to hit the *specific speed* of 60 mph in as little time as possible) when there are glorious performance gains to be had in the area that electric cars usually falter in: power at high speeds. Ferrari‚Äôs and Porsches always beat a P100D in a straight line if you give them enough time to catch up. The Roadster 2 could change that."
This should be on r/madlad  ...releases the worlds fastest electric car then retorts this is only the base model. Mad IÔ∏è tell you. 
"I really hope I fit in one.

Anything less than a Merlin engine is going to be a disappointment now.

" That's incredible! Now, if only I had the $200k to afford it..."
But does it have auto-wipers?
"That is by far the fastest 0-60 in a production car ever, right?"
"I‚Äôve always wondered how to improve on a statistic like this knowing what we know about the limitations of tires. Perhaps the following is possible if the chassis is sprung with air or pneumatics:

During a launch, the spring rate is decreased or instantaneously removed such that there is an additional downward force vector from the chassis ‚Äúdropping‚Äù. This should improve traction off the line a little for a fraction of a second. But this would severely impact the stroke of the dampers on compression. 

If when you prepare to launch the car, you see the chassis raise I bet they do this. "
Maximum speed (Cryosuit) 
That's going to take some getting used to. Is accelerator pedal variable physical resistance a thing?
Flying car confirmed.
There is.. flash speed.. superman speed. We can speculate these would be locked for flying cars or spaceships though..
I believe any faster and you are going to run into traction issues.
"That's clearly exceeding the Weissman theoretical limit.. How does he do it?
"
"Me guess would be some interior weight savings (more hardcore seats, etc.) and maybe some additional aero features? Special lighter wheels even?

"Something I'm surprised people were never outraged over was when it was revealed all Teslas have the large battery packs, but the ""standard pack"" cars were just limited by software. That's more deceitful than the Volkswagen emissions scandal."

"Yep. Really high end street tires are basically limited to ~2s (1.5g). The only way to go faster is to have stickier tires, and that also impacts range a whole lot (more grip also means more drag).

Tire grip is the coefficient of friction times weight. So the maximum force you can exert on the car is its weight (which is 1 g-force, regardless of the actual weight in kg or lbs) times the coefficient of friction. Normal street tires are about ~0.7, really grippy specialty tires go up to 1.3-1.4, formula one slicks are about 1.7-1.8 and the absolute stickiest compounds can theoretically do something like 3. 

So on normal road tires you can expect 0.7g acceleration, which is a 0-60 time of 3.9s. Specialty tires at 1.4 can do 1.95s. Super racing slicks can do 1.5ish and the absolute best times, e.g. with top fuel dragsters, are ~0.8s 0-60. 

Tesla's 1.9 is already literally incredible considering any commercially available street tire. It kinda breaks physics as it goes. Going even faster means they really have to have done some serious engineering on the tire compounds.

Couple caveats: a well-engineered body can generate more downforce aerodynamically and even using what's called suspension-induced drag, which can improve times by 0.1-0.2s over what you'd expect with just the tires. Also, a super-grippy surface helps a lot. You can get better performance on a stickier surface even if your tires aren't that great."
At what 0-60 time does it become unhealthy for humans?
Well they could always add rockets! Voltic Rocket.
The üí∞ intent üí∞ is üí∞ to üí∞ provide üí∞ drivers üí∞ with üí∞ a üí∞ sense üí∞ of üí∞ pride üí∞ and üí∞ accomplishment üí∞ for üí∞ unlocking üí∞ different üí∞ driving üí∞ modes.
Now that is a unlocking/progression system i could get behind. 
"For all the jokes, with a super car that doesn't sound that bad. You're only allowed to use the higher functions after five or so hours or so many miles driven that way people don't get surprised by the extreme acceleration. "

I have a feeling they're gonna run out of speed scale if they jumped straight to Maximum Plaid. Plaid 2-10 anyone? Maximum Plaid = 11?

"Petrol and diesel cars generate power. It takes time. Teslas store power to be used anytime needed.

"But then you get slammed into your seatbelt, not the seat back. Decidedly worse."
"Really what you need to do is get up to 60 mph in reverse (probably need to be towed), then slam on the brakes so you're accelerating forward."
"The Porsche 918 spyder, an insane million dollar hybrid super car, does it in 2.5. Under 2 seconds is a paradigm shift, literally something out of the future. In addition to grip, probably the instant torque from the electric motors is also key. "
"I wonder how they're going to keep the Roadster name but differentiate it from the earlier versions. 

In the original 2500 cars, they've already used Roadster, Sport, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 (am I missing any?)."
0-60 in 1 second. Car would need an electric turbine mounted to it for thrust. That would be somethimg up their sleeve. 
Good luck
If a car beats it it will only be something like 1.8.  physics won't allow cars to go faster because of tire grip.
"To be fair, this is all easily Google'able and clearly thousands of people have already made cars that run under 2s in 0 to 60mph. But none of those cars were warrantied to be run on the street.

It's not a new problem in any sense of the automotive racing / track world and Tesla didn't offer any new solutions. They clearly have thought about it as you can hear the tires squealing. If you don't understand tire squeal = loss of traction, then I'm not sure even Google can help you at this point, ;)"
"Hey this is Tesla, not EA!"
"You joke, but you can upgrade your car remotely via buying software packages."

The time for that concern passed like 5 years ago.  He's revolutionized three industries in that time.  This is his normal mode of operation.
Elon isn't personally putting together the cars. I'm sure he can manage multiple ventures without breaking down.
Yeah.. One guy... Alone... Doing all of that. Maybe he should think some people to give him a hand. 
Everybody said exact same thing along every stage about every launch and they continue to deliver.  At what point can you just start to get on board?  It's a delay of launch it's not like they are sitting on their asses doing nothing.  Also if they need X number of people to solve gigafactory then they just hire more to work on other parts.  It's not as if Elon himself is designing all this stuff.
"> Elon is biting off more than he can chew...

I mean, hes been biting off more than he can chew since the beginning.

He'll definitely ship a product, but the question is when and at what volume. With the roadster's base price he'll probably get closer to fulfilling preorders than hes doing with the model 3, though. "
"The companies are going to be fine because they have thousands of employees working hard and solving problems, not just Elon.

Elon himself on the other hand is a bit worrying.  He seems to be pushing himself with everything he's doing.  He might need to back down for a bit for his own sanity and go on a well deserved break.  I'd hate to see him break down because of the stress."
"That is before you get to the significant cash flow problems and that they completely skipped the vital prototype phase of production, resulting in Model 3s that look like they've already been in fender-benders right from the factory."

"lol agreed, reaching 2s with electric motors is not that hard.  

but tbf i think you make it sound a little bit too easy, that 1.5s time is world record, as they say in the film. :D"
"I have an old Roadster. Unless you turn off the traction control, there's very little slip.  If you watch the video that's been circulating of Franz Von Holzhauzen accelerating next to a group of people on a sort of curve, you hear all kinds of tire slippage -- more than you would hear in an old Roadster, S or X.

I don't think there should be any question that tires are going to be the main issue with the new Roadster.

I just hope they don't wind up putting tires on it that are as expensive to replace as on a Buggatti, because buying a $200k car is a bit of a stretch for me.  If the tires wind up costing $40k every 5k miles of driving, I'll be a very, very sad Panda."
"Downforce is part what lets that car do that FYI, not just the slicks. That spoiler isn't just for funzies."
students can build a one off car but not a production car.

Someone was good at physics...
"> It kinda breaks physics as it goes

I think we need to stop saying this. It doesn't ""break"" physics. It just breaks DOT / federal regulations on car safety in regards to tires in wet and cold conditions."
I read this in the guy from Engineering Everyday's voice from YouTube
"There was a concept reading car that got banned because it had too much down force. It has a huge fan that sucks. Theoretically, it could generate crazy down force to boost traction."
"> Yep. Really high end street tires are basically limited to ~2s (1.5g). The only way to go faster is to have stickier tires, and that also impacts range a whole lot (more grip also means more drag).

That's generally true of ICE cars, but with EV cars such as the Roadster 2 there's other tricks available, such as:

- two rear wheel engines, with a lower (fixed) gear ratio optimized for lower velocities.
- a single front engine, with a higher (fixed) gear ratio optimized for higher velocities

Real-drive cars have superior traction, because acceleration itself creates a significant down-force, increasing friction between the car and the road.

With such a distribution of 3 engines, the Roadster 2 can create a lot of downforce at lower velocities (up to ~60 mph) by using rear-drive, and use aerodynamic downforce at higher velocities.

A 'Performance Roadster 2' might also use four engines, two front and two rear engines, to reach an even higher end speed.

I.e. there's a lot more tricks available to Tesla to further increase performance, beyond the selection of tires:

- engine placement
- gear ratios
- power routing
- active air flow management
"
/r/theydidthemath
"The Tesla is able to achieve that crazy acceleration because of the electric drive motors. It can regulate torque precisely to launch, helping to keep the tires from slipping. Cars with combustion engines and transmissions simply can't achieve that. How exactly they worked it out, I have no idea, but it's insanely impressive. "
"Its not a 0-60 time as much as it is excessive g force. 

1.9 sounds fast but its really not even close to pushing the limit.

Top fuel dragsters do 0-100 in .8 seconds, 0-60 in .2, and people live just fine at 5.3ish(?) G's"
"[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force#Human_tolerance) says that ""*The record for peak experimental horizontal g-force tolerance is held by acceleration pioneer John Stapp, in a series of rocket sled deceleration experiments culminating in a late 1954 test in which he was clocked in a little over a second from a land speed of Mach 0.9. He survived a peak ""eyeballs-out"" acceleration of 46.2 times the acceleration of gravity, and more than 25 g for 1.1 seconds, proving that the human body is capable of this. Stapp lived another 45 years to age 89 without any ill effects.*"""
"Somewhere below 0.2. Eyeballs in is the best direction for G forces, and as long as you're strapped in well enough to keep your foot on the pedal an everyday person would probably be fine with above 6 gs for brief periods. "
Electric turbine propulsion
tEslA
"They could go to other pop culture references, maybe Improbability from HHGTTG or simply go by the G force later on as it gets relevant. Real Comparisons to Jets, Spacecraft and Probes are also on the table."
We're gonna need a sequel movie!!!
After plaid will come improbable. After that... bistromatics.
"F1 in race trim, sure. But when you have to gear the car for 230mph 0-60 is kind of just an after thought. "
2wd vs 4wd. Totally different ball games. This is not faster than an F1 car in any metric besides maybe 0-20mph.
"Don't be a thoughtless fanboy.

"it is key, thats the reason the 918 can reach 2.5, that thing is heavy. without its electric motors it wouldnt be able to do that."
"I can‚Äôt wait to see lap times with the Tesla. If it can keep up through the turns, it will really put the fire to Porsche and other high end manufacturers. "
"A friend has an awd GTR that he's monkied with to put out some idiotic amount of power.  Like 1500 whp.  He goes to drag events all over North America.  And I'm pretty sure he's only broken 9 once or twice.  On drag strips.

We are talking a purpose built all wheel drive 1/4 and 1/2 mile monster with a technician behind the wheel.  

And this roadster will beat it every time with a know nothing soccer mom driving.

This is just bananas."
"The TCS coupled with instant torque has gotta be some amazing wizardry, too."
"918 is about all around handling, though, not just straight line. Teslas are monsters at accelerating in a straight line, but there are many cars better at cornering. "
"Most car companies just don't bother versioning them. How many generations have there been of Camry, Accord, Impala etc? Nobody calls them Camry 7.0 or whatever. The companies usually have platform codes that they use internally that tend to get adopted by enthusiasts (e.g. NA/B/C/D Miata etc) but it's not generally Incorporated in the official name of the car."
"I can see them going the Model S route and upgrading the Roadster without giving it secondary names. 

I'll have to find sources but iirc Musk stated: 1) they're getting rid of the 60, P100D, etc placards. And 2) that if you want a refund on your car once an upgraded version is produced then don't buy a Tesla."
The New Roadster
They probably won't. That's really what model years are for.
"Roadster 9, Roadster heavy, Fast fucking car"
An extending anchor leg attached to a linear electrical actuator under the car that catapults the car forward for the first leap. Then the wheels make contact to the road and the friction coefficient would be doable for them to thrust the car up from there. 
"You can do that on gum-consistency sticky tires and about 1-1.5MW of power. Doable, certainly for single sprints. Not safe for the driver though, you'd be pulling ~3-4G's."
can't spell Tesla without EA
"Oh sweet child, Tesla's have a paywall to access more via software unlock. This was verified in the Florida evac where cars had their range unlocked to help owners evac."
We do have Loot Boxes in the Tesla app
In this case that would be gladly appreciated!
"Exactly. It‚Äôs not $50, it‚Äôs $10,000. 

That‚Äôs the upgrade cost for Ludicrous mode in the model S, right? Totally worth it. "
EA is out to make money. Tesla seems to be in the business of losing millions. Maybe they pay you?

"The production numbers are different, neither the trucks nor the roadster will be built in high volume. In the US alone, iirc the number of new class 8 trucks sold per year is less than half a million, combined across all brands while cars are in the tens of millions. They could literally hand build the Roadster, it doesn't even make economic sense to make an automated production line with lot of robots and stuff like that. Just think back how the first generation Roadster was being built and that had 2500 units made.

They are still students and electric sports car are still pretty new.
If you want 1.9 sec launches you will need very soft tires and they will wear down like crazy. You can't have durable hard rubber and still accelerate like a Formula 1 car.
"I think Bugatti said the tires are actually glued to the rim because otherwise the car has enough power to cause slipping between the rim and tire. This is also why it costs so much to replace.

If the roadster is capable of matching or exceeding bugatti specs, I would be surprised if it didn't have to do something crazy like gluing the rim to the tire."
"So you mean initial acceleration from 0-60 is affected by downforce? I am not sure but i dont think, downforce comes into play until 40"

"The spoiler makes sure the car doesn't go airborne at higher speeds - if you have none your car is basically an airfoil since it's not symmetrical like a droplet [the wind has a shorter way under the car than over the car creating lift](http://www.shonscience.com/uploads/2/2/1/3/22138584/8431392_orig.png). You can have all  the power you like, it all needs to get through the 4 small spots on the ground where the rubber hits the road. If the wheels have no grip, no spoiler and no horsepower will help you."

That‚Äôs not how slicks work. They don‚Äôt limit the top speed. 
"Well unless the 200kw battery manages to weight less than the weight of an internal combustion engine (possible battery tech breakthrough by 2020), and the car has aggressive active aero (which it doesn't), it will be pretty handicapped when competing against ICE supercars as far as track performance goes.

It could still do well, just not gonna be breaking any Nurburgring lap time records anytime soon."
I wonder if they can independently accelerate to help with cornering somewhat like a GT3 does with rear steering. 
No getting around weight and aero. The car doesnt appear to have any crazy aero and it will certainly weight a lot with 200 kw battery given current technology for the foreseeable future.
"Whoops, let me fix that"
"If they hit that number, all bets would be off since apparently electric cars run on magic and the upcoming electric Lambo will go so fast it‚Äôll head back in time.

They'll make a prototype of a new body style and chassis coming in 2-3 years exactly like this one shown by Tesla, it's standard industry practice, you just haven't been exposed to it.

They're also called ""crusher cars"" because they get experimental VINs and can not be sold, the manufacturers have to scrap them when they're done. That's where Roadkill got all the Dodge Hellcat bits to shove into their old 60's charger, they took a prototype Charger Hellcat and striped it before it went to the great drag strip in the sky. They sometimes get lent out to tech schools too, I got to work on and drive around campus in an GMC 3500 that was produced a year or two before they started full production of the new version.

"It's a silly movie reference, from the 1987 movie ""Spaceballs"", a Star Wars spoof comedy."
"As others have said, it's a reference to the movie Spaceballs, but that doesn't really explain it. Science fiction movies have always struggled with showing high speed in space. In reality, even moving a significant fraction of the speed of light would look pretty normal (except for Doppler color shifting), because space is really huge and mostly empty. Movies have therefore used visual cues like star trails, warp ""tunnels"", etc. If you want to show that you're moving even faster, you need to step up the visuals even more. Faster, brighter, more patterns. Eventually there's nowhere to go but plaid."

"If the R2 gets some crazy non pneumatic tires, I'm going to lose my shit."
"I was thinking the same thing.   Tires that go wide when you are accelerating or decelerating .    I have no idea if this is possible,   rubber is flexible so it would be a matter of having dynamic wheels ."
tbf this is just Engineering Explained in text form.
"No it doesn't break any regulations, it actually breaks a simplified model of vehicle physics. It goes faster than you'd expect it would be able to go given certain (idealized, again) characteristics of tires. Follow the math, you'll understand what I mean by 'breaking physics*'.

From the perspective of car tech enthusiasts, the specs of the roadster 2 break what anyone thought possible given the constraints of road-legal cars. This is a massive deal, and although I appreciate the attempt to dampen the enthusiasm, this isn't a fanboy comment (I personally quite dislike a lot of aspects of Tesla as a company and Tesla cars, would probably never elect to drive one unless it was given to me super cheap) - this time it actually is a legitimate comment. 

(*for 100% clarity, nothing about any car, including this one, can ever literally break physics. It is a metaphor, an exaggeration denoting the car certainly breaking assumptions, rules of thumb and 'common knowledge' in a certain field, in this case car enthusiasts)"
"I'm sorry. His shows are great, but his voice sounds like he's got nodules forming."
"Is was banned partly because it's super dangerous. If you are going round a fast corner and you lose suction, you're flying into the wall. Same with the ground effect cars. "
Aerodynamic control like that is pretty common in aircraft. E.g. they'll suck in air at the back of the wing to keep the flow attached at higher angles of attack

"This is true for ALL cars. Tire grip has nothing to do with the drivetrain. It is only and exclusively a property of the tire compounds.

Acceleration does not generate additional downforce, only jerk does."
Acceleration from the front wheels would put more weight on the rear wheels but acceleration from the rear wheels would decrease weight on the front wheels. No overall increase. 
At last a true reply. I was getting sick and tired of people saying physics wouldnt allow fasters cars. Physics isnt the problem its an engineering one. We might need different approaches or different materials but the laws of physics arent stopping us here
"It's been done before other electric cars. For example, the one Richard Hammond threw off that hill. Plus traction control has been a thing for ages in all cars. What's special about this is the cornering ability you achieve being able to control the torque to each wheel, which is normally only possible though brake steering in combustion engine cars. "
"Yeah excessive g-force due to super fast acceleration is what I meant, thanks for the insightful answer though!"
Seems like the human won't be the bottleneck in 0-60 times for a while then
"Yea if they set an F1 car to accelerate from 0 hard and for top speed it would embarrass anything but a top fuel dragster.

But those are effectively a few hundred million each if you take the costs of a season averaged over the # of cars each team makes.

Not $200,000 lol"
So you're saying the new Tesla Roadster is faster 0 to 60 than an F1 car in race trim and it has a higher top speed? Neat!
"Yeah. F1 Has enough hp to do 1s 0-100kmh, but they dont have enough grip due to 2wd. In corners they are obviously in another world, but on the high end, that downforce translates into a lot of drag, so the roadster, in a straight line, accelerates faster than F1 and has a higher VMax. "
Why... Afaik this is true... The Roadster will be faster in a straight line than F1. Acceleration wise and top speed... 
A 911 Turbo S can do 2.5s without electric motors. It's about tires and launch control system. 
"2018 Dodge Demon is 2.3 0-60, 9.65 quarter mile. Insane lol I can't imagine the facemelting awesomeness this or the tesla must feel like."
"Hopefully they've made some good advances but don't hold your breath on that. The current generation of Tesla vehicles have terrible track performance, the constant speed changes wreak havoc with the electric motor. "
"Porsche is currently working on an all electric performance car, they've been using electric motors for years now. I think it wouldn't be the ""end"" of them obviously, but it might light a fire under their ass to get something out. "
"It'll need adequate cooling for the battery, motor, and controller to achieve great lap times. I assume Tesla has thought about this, or I surely hope so"
Ome of the drivers of the Roadster reveal was saying how the pull from 0 to 70 was the same from 90 plus. He also mentioned they were doing launches all night without degraded performance. That would be huge for a track car. I assume the battery pack is liquid cooled to maintain that performance.
It will weigh too much to do anything that amazing. You're probably looking at like 4500 lbs for the Roadster.
1200whp gtr's are well into the 8s way faster than the Tesla roadster other than 0-60.  
"Lol, no way is a 1500whp only barely doing 9's. My actual friend only has a 750bhp set up. And he can crack 10.3. 1500whp is more like low 8 secs. "
"Most car companies use the model year, but Tesla does not. So we're in this weird situation described."
"I was more commenting on the text that OP used ""2.0"" to refer to the new Roadster, but 2.0 and a lot of other modifiers were already used with Gen 1. If nothing else, googling for fixes gets harder..."
What happens when they upgrade it again? The new-new Roadster?
Nice...Roadster FFC. I like it...
Wouldn't that make it Teasla?  
"Yup and it makes manufacturing more standardized. They're able to charge less than they would be if they didn't do it this way, counterintuitively "
It‚Äôs still advantageous for all. It would be much more expensive to tool the factory for several batteries instead of producing one and offering unlocks while delivering to those with smaller budgets. 
I know! Just wanted to make a cheap ea joke.
"See I don't think that's correct, users reported a screen giving them the choice to activate the feature or not, and if they did activate then it would increase wear on the battery. Lithium batteries such as that in the Tesla need to always have some charge to maintain the long term health of the battery, this update removed that feature that cut the battery off when it got to say 10% remaining, allowing for that 10% more use, but also increased wear"
A lot of people seem to think so. 
I think automating a battery pack assembly line is easier than retro-propulsion rocket landing.
"Absolutely correct. The effects are pretty negligible, but when .1 seconds is what you are trying to shave..."
What they need are four vertical thrusters firing straight up above each wheel throughout the 0-60 acceleration. Increase downforce to 2G right from 0mph and a whole new world of possibilities opens up. =P
"Fun fact, you have no idea what you're talking about! Race application spoilers like the one in the conversation have nothing to do with a traditional Automotive spoiler on a sedan."
"Just fyi, an formula car can drive upsidedown due to aerodynamics F=m x a is the law, but if you can bend the rules..."

"Lithium Sulfur has a theoretical gravimetric energy density apx. 4 times higher than lithium ion.  500 Wh/kg cells are in small scale production, volumetric density is not any better using lithium sulfur, unless using technologies demonstrated in labs."
Perhaps they want to maintain the clean lines. But the aggressive aero could be underneath. That rear diffuser seems pretty big 
Combustion vehicles need to dump a lot more heat which handicaps their aero performance.

In the history of movies, I wouldn't consider it a classic. It has its cult following though, I'm one of them. But it's no more a classic than the Austin Powers movies."

[For when the time comes](https://www.amazon.com/MedPro-Homecare-Commode-Adjustable-Height/dp/B001ULD1B8).
"""Vehicle physics"" is still physics. The standard model of physics still wholly applies here. Nothing has been broken or even restated. 

Just that automotive engineers derived an equation with a dozen static variables they wrote down and now their own little equation doesn't give the numbers they expected it would give. That's....all.

I have followed the math. It all depends on the ""currently available"" coefficient of friction in street legal tires. That number changes literally every year. It's their equation that's broken; physics has not. 

I'm not trying to dampen any enthusiasm; I'm psyched for this groundbreaking, ""massive deal"" of a car and I'm even more psyched about the tire/traction system Tesla will be using. However, it's just basic to call it ""breaking physics""; please visit us in /r/askscience for a longer explanation, ;)

You're argument is akin to, ""Wow, you made six batches of cookies in that oven? You've broken physics."" 

Your edit *100% clarity is what I'm trying to point out: it's a bad metaphor. Lots of other things in the news ""break"" physics and that's legitimate. Groundbreaking, breaks assumptions, next level, impossible on today's tires, state-of-the-art, etc. are all valid here. 

But when you say ""breaking physics"", you're diluting actual science that has caused the reorganization of the basic, fundamental laws of physics. That...didn't happen.

"**Brabham BT46**

The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One racing car designed by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, for the 1978 Formula One season. The car featured several radical design elements, one of which was the use of flat panel heat exchangers on the bodywork of the car to replace conventional water and oil radiators. This concept did not work in practice and was removed before the car‚Äôs race debut, never to be seen again. The cars, however, powered by a flat-12 Alfa Romeo engine, raced competitively with modified nose-mounted radiators for most of the year, driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson, winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship.

"Jerk is the derivative of of acceleration, and does not have direct impact on down force.

Down force is a function of velocity (and it is a quadratic relation), which is the integral of acceleration.

Edit: I was wrong. These guys are talking about mechanical downforce from the car‚Äôs own weight shifting during acceleration. That is directly impacted by jerk. I was thinking of aerodynamic downforce, which plays a minimal role at this low speed."
"> Tire grip has nothing to do with the drivetrain.

> Acceleration does not generate additional downforce, only jerk does.

These two statements are in obvious contradiction: 'jerk' (acceleration of acceleration) **does** increase downforce, as you yourself state correctly, and hence increases the total maximum friction force between road and tires.

The harmonics of the suspension and the timing of the acceleration curve determine how this extra downforce is distributed.

I'd agree with the statement that tire compounds and aerodynamics dominate during more static periods of the acceleration curve.
"
Not necessarily. There are some fancy pants electronic differentials that can apply more torque to outside wheels in ICE cars.
Yeah but what about dogs? This is important info for future roadster owners with dog copilots. 
Don‚Äôt forget the current Formula 1 engine is a 1.6L V6. Unbelievable technology. And yeah. $200k probably doesn‚Äôt even pay for the motor on an F1 car. 
"Yes. Race trim means the car is intentionally slowed down for straight line due to a bunch of regulations and rules.

But even in this slow version, a F1 can go from 60-120 faster than 0-60, it can brake with up to 6G of deceleration and corner with 5G of lateral acceleration.

The Roadster is a glorified go kart when compared to a F1 lol. Even a 10 years old F1, without traction control, RWD only, can accelerate 0-100 in 4 seconds flat, vs roadster‚Äôs 4.2s claimed."
"The fastest a F1 car has ever driven is 413 km/h or 257 mph, so I'd say VMax is more or less equal."
"No it won‚Äôt. Even a 10 years old F1 can do 0-100 in 4 seconds flat. F1 are traction limited thats why they do 60-120 faster than 0-60.

Top speed is limited by regulation and rules as well, they also have tremendous downforce so that doesn‚Äôt help.

But within this top speed envelop, F1 will accelerate much faster than the Roadster in anything but 0-60.

But if you just look at 0-60 and top speed, most modern hypercars beat F1 in those, so Roadster isn‚Äôt alone in that achievement. "
"I think you meant to say ""without"", not ""with""."
I thought the main factor was heat build up. Care to explain how speed changes affect the motors?
I think the mission e is target as more of a Panamera replacement than a $200k hypercar. :/
How did you come up with that weight? Is it because the battery is twice the size of the P100 model S and you know the weight of that pack? 4500 pounds is so heavy for a car that fast.

That's why an automotive airfoil turns into a spoiler if installed in the wrong angle. In the last sentence he even confirms that the spoiler prevents the car from a lift-up: ""The faster the car goes, the more the rear end will try to lift off the ground. A good spoiler (or wing) reduces that up-lift."" He continues with ""Both wings and spoilers reduce up-lift at the tail of the vehicle"". Spoilers and Wings both produce downforce. The second effect of a wing is drag and that's it and the spoiler also reshapes the airflow."

"The tires aren't that expensive, relative to the car.

$400 tires on a Model 3. 1.2% of the car-price.

$2000 on a Roadster. 1% of the car-price.

That sounds reasonable; they only wear down rapidly if you're running them on the track. But that's like saying, ""Man, I keep running out of chicken when I make chicken casserole. This chicken casserole pot is so expensive!""

You don't *need* to make chicken casserole in the pot. You could just drive around like a normal car; launches shouldn't rip up the tires that fast--it'll be more like a normal high-performance summer tire.

"No, neither acceleration nor jerk creates down force directly. Down force is a function of velocity, which is the double integral of jerk, and integral of acceleration.

Or look it at this way, two physically identical objects reaching 1g of acceleration in 1s (9.8m/s^2/s) would have the same jerk, but the object with the higher *initial velocity* (v0) would obviously have more down force.

If two objects have the same initial velocity, then what you would care about is the area under the acceleration graph, so an ""average"" acceleration over time would be a good indicator of velocity over the same time period. Simply measuring max acceleration does not give us that area.

Even more so for jerk, measuring the area under the jerk graph would give us the acceleration (change in velocity over time), but measuring max jerk literally tells us nothing with regard to dv/dt.

Edit: ahhhhh I see what‚Äôs happening now. In this particular case due to suspension and weight shifting of the car, downforce can be generated by the car‚Äôs own weight shifting (instead of just air, which was what I was relying on above), which is directly caused by the jerk of acceleration."
I'd be surprised if there's anything other than aero parts that are worth less.  
"Are you talking about the last couple seasons or are you looking at all of F1's history? For a time period they were making well over 1000HP, but they aren't nearly that powerful now. I don't think you could get a modern F1 car to 257 even if you had an endless straight to do it on."
I'm no expert so if anyone else has a better explanation please share. But my understanding is that electric motors can provide amazing acceleration but it uses a huge amount of energy and that energy generates a lot of heat. So accelerating once from zero to sixty generates a lot of heat but then once you're cruising much less power is used and t cools off. If you're constantly accelerating then slowing down then accelerating then there's not enough time to cool and the heat just keeps building. 
"It's not about weight. A Model S weighs way more than a McLaren 720S, yet it's still quicker to 60.

A Porsche 918 with a modest amount of batteries, an ICE, and a completely composite construction weights like 3400-3500 pounds. 200 kw battery packs will weigh a ton and I doubt the Roadster will be a CF car.

I think it's quite reasonable to assume a Roadster will weigh like 4500 pounds unless there is a breakthrough in batteries than drastically lowers the weight of the car."

"Like go full hotwheels on that thing. Drive it on the ceiling. Upsidedown. It gets more down force than the car weighs at 150 ish, and could suck itself up to the ceiling. Obviously a fraction of it's typical acceleration due to g, but the math says it would work. "
">Even with the limitations on aerodynamics, at 160 km/h (99 mph) aerodynamically generated downforce is equal to the weight of the car, and the oft-repeated claim that Formula One cars create enough downforce to ""drive on the ceiling"", while possible in principle, has never been put to the test. Downforce of 2.5 times the car's weight can be achieved at full speed. The downforce means that the cars can achieve a lateral force with a magnitude of up to 3.5 times that of the force of gravity (3.5g) in cornering.

I can not know of course, but I am guessing this car can be used reasonably as a daily driver. If a lower middle class middle class person is gifted a Ferriri or lambo or something of that kind, he still can't afford to run it. This will be different. It will depend on preference alone.  "

"Nit pick, jerk is the double time *derivative* of velocity, not integral."
"> No, neither acceleration nor jerk creates down force directly. Down force is a function of velocity, which is the double integral of jerk, and integral of acceleration.

That's not how physics works in this case though. Beside the fact that ['jerk' is the second *derivative* of velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_\(physics\)), not a 'double integral', another factor is that the force(s) accelerating the car does not go through the centre of gravity.

This means that with increasing acceleration there's a lever and a momentum that creates extra downforce. If a lot of power is applied through the rear wheels, this downforce can be pretty significant, even with constant acceleration.

This is why most racing cars are either rear driven, or all wheel driven. This is why a rear driven Porsche can out-accelerate many other cars with similar horsepower: more effective grip in the end.

And this is why I think the Roadster 2 might have a mixed, dynamic design of both rear driven and front driven drivetrains, where the distribution of battery output is routed dynamically with a rear bias to create maximum downforce when acceleration is approaching limits of grip plus aerodynamic downforce, which is at lower velocities.
"
"No, this was back in 2005. In 2016 Bottas managed to get to 372 kmh / 231 mph mid race though, so maybe with the right gear ratios and on a straight 250+ would be possible, but I don't think anyone has ever tested it."
"I have a little bit more of an explanation - you're right though.

Say the Roadster is 4400lbs (2000kg). Going 0-60mph (0-28 m/s) in 1.9 seconds means it has to accrue (1/2) * m * v^2 = 0.5 * 2000 * 28^2 ~ 784 kJ of momentum, divide by 1.9 seconds gives 412kW of power. Even if the motors and inverters are 95% efficient, which is incredibly good, that is 20kW of heat being generated in the motors. The motors are tiny, maybe a couple dozen lbs. Putting the power equivalent of 10 electric kettles into that, regardless of how well you cool them, is going to cook them.

Now, that is just the motors. The batteries also aren't 100% efficient. Much like the P100D, I'd expect total drivetrain efficiency at maximum power to be around 80%. So with 400kW going to the motors, there's 100kW of heat being generated. Hey, that's peanuts right, a typical ICE supercar generates >1MW of waste heat, a Chiron even more than 2MW, so what's the deal? Well, this is where the biggest issue comes in: rejection temperature.

A Chiron or Veyron or LaFerrari has cooling water at 95C, meaning it can take advantage of a large temperature differential between the outside air and cooling system. A Tesla has to maintain battery temperatures below 55C, ideally below 45, and pretty low motor temps as well. This means the difference between its cooling fluid and the outside air is 5-10x lower (especially on a hot day), which in turn means that the same radiator surface can reject 5-10x as little heat at the same airspeed. 

The Model S has very little radiator surface, and it already pulls over 300kW peak from the pack, so it can only maintain its high performance for a little while. The roadster would require either much larger radiators or lots and lots of efficiency improvements to minimize those losses. I mean, it's not outside of the realm of possibility that they're making much better motors and batteries to fix this, but I will bet money that their track performance, especially on long races, will be a LOT poorer than their 'burst' performance. Just like the Model S.

By the way, total side point: much of the bad performance of the Model S is its relatively low gearing. It runs out of steam REAL quick, having very poor acceleration at 60MPH, let alone 100. I think (no evidence, just educated guess) that impacts track performance more than the cooling by itself."
"OK, we're saying the same thing then.

It shouldn't be too problematic to engineer better cooling and it would make sense doing so, given it's a super car. 

They didn't do it on Model S because the point of the car wasn't to race around a track."
"Makes sense. I think I read somewhere else that the batteries weigh around 10 pounds per kw so that‚Äôs 2000 pounds for the batteries alone. At the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt really matter, although if you want to even consider driving the roadster on a track, the weight distribution needs to be somewhat balanced. If the roadster can take corners well, it could be an extremely fun track car assuming the battery can last long enough when being pushed hard for 30 mins or so. The $200k price range puts it in the price range of a Porsche GT3 RS, which is slower 0-60 but is excellent on the track. Porsche 918 is probably a better comparison because it is a hybrid, but it‚Äôs also not available and it costs 5 times the price of the Roadster on the used market so not many people are actually driving them hard on a track. 

I know no one was talking about road course driving but 0-60 ‚Äúracing‚Äù is only fun for so long. Fun to impress your friends I guess but the novelty wears off quick if you really want to drive your car. The roadster has potential on a track that the S just didn‚Äôt have as a sedan but the weight could be an issue. I guess we will see. Elon is smart to market 0-60 and 1/4 mile times because that‚Äôs what people like to see. "
"I'm not sure there's ""plenty"".  And those gtr's will still cost at least the same if not more, and are bloody temperaments.  "

"Yes, the spoilers generate lots of downforce at high speeds so they won't fly away. [When you lift their front them a little bit even at 60 mph they do exactly that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qq1JAFSIf9o)

"She better not have any mobil devices since most of the cobalt is used for batteries for mobile devices. Superalloys, such as stellite, are one of the largest consumer of cobalt metal, accounting for about 20% of demand. So better not use any tech related to [stellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellite) like exhaust valves of internal combustion engines and never ever use an airplane since those use these alloys for all their engines.  Hardmetals, in which cobalt is used as a binding material, consume roughly 12% of total cobalt. These include cemented carbides and diamond tools that are used in cutting applications and mining tools.
And cobalt is used in petrochemical catalysts (so no more ICE car driving for a second reason!), ceramic pigments (no more dishes with blue color) and glass decolorizers (no more clear bottles). If she is older she will also have a painful future since cobalt is in wear-resistant alloys (e.g. Vitallium), which can be found in orthopedic and dental implants, as well as prosthetic hips and knees. Magnets account for 7% of cobalt metal demand and are used in magnetic recording media, electric motors, as well as generators. So no more fridge or other electric motor for you.

"Regardless of the possible hypocrisy in the letter- Here's an interesting report about Cobalt mining.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/batteries/congo-cobalt-mining-for-lithium-ion-battery/"
"This idea came from a mining website article that got promoted on other political and news media sites. The big increase in demand for lithium ion battery for tech products and electric cars, made hedge funds buy tons of options for the raw materials in the batteries, one of which is cobalt. These prices are driving mining companies (there are 5 big firms that mine cobalt) to expand exploration as fast as they can, even thought there is NOT an actually shortage yet, just the anticipation of future shortages and the action of the hedge funds. One or two of the mining companies operate in the Congo, which does use child labor. So far, Apple and Tesla claim they will only source from mining companies with companies that do no violate human rights and run ethical operations. However, as with other products (like blood diamonds, illegal cutting of hardwood rainforest trees, insanely destructive gold and sapphire mining) and due to the corruption in the Congo, it can be hard to truly determine the original source of some of the materials.

"*stellite alloy

Also worth noting that the price of cobalt has tripled in the last few years in part because companies like Tesla and Apple are advancing the market for ethically sourced Cobalt, which is a good sign. Thanks Tesla. "
"Amnesty puts Tesla behind only Apple and Samsung SDI in terms of working to secure their supply chain, and the best score of any EV manufacturer.  I think Tesla probably didn't do as well as they could have simply because Tesla doesn't have the time/personnel to respond to the request (they scored worst in the ""does the company have robust policies in place..."" and ""has the company disclosed..."" sections, which both strike me as very Tesla - flying by the seat of your pants).  Basically, Tesla says they're taking steps, Amnesty says they're taking steps, but Amnesty wants them to take more and be a little more upfront about the steps they take.

"i think it would be good to find out where Tesla sources their cobalt from. Apple switched to other sources when it was revealed that child labor is an issue in the cobalt mines where Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt sources their cobalt from and where apple was purchasing cobalt from. There are other less controversial cobalt sources but the Congo mines are one of the largest reserves in the world, making up about 1/3rd of global production i believe. that being said yes this lady is going to have a hard time avoiding products that use cobalt. 
"
"I appreciate the information that went into your comment, but it is essentially a bunch of whataboutism. If cobalt mining practices are truly this heinous, we should address that. Not just point fingers.

Yes. None of it is sourced from the Congo. Been that way for a long time.
"So for instance, a typical phone has about a 5Wh battery, so it takes 20,000 phones before you've reached the same cobalt consumption as a P100D.

"That's a motherfin' smack down response, good on ya."
"All of Panasonic/Tesla's Cobalt comes from the Philippines, with the goal of all materials for the Gigafactory coming from North America."
"About 2% of cobalt production ends up in electric cars. I think more than that goes into conventional cars, simply as part of alloys.

And the cobalt in electric cars is easiest to recycle, if it ever actually hits end-of-life, because there's enough concentrated in each car that they won't simply discard it like they would in low-content alloys."

"I was about to fact check her claims to laugh at the letter writer.

My assumption was she had got it all wrong and conflated coltan with cobalt. But apparently that's not correct, cobalt is used in electric batteries used in cars as she claimed and is also mainly mined in DRC as she claims
Source: https://www.ft.com/content/427b8cb0-71d7-11e7-aca6-c6bd07df1a3c

However Tesla is a rare manufacturer that doesn't use a lot of cobalt and has also committed to exclusive use of North American cobalt 

This article gives further details:
https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/01/no-cobalt-no-tesla/

So yes while we Tesla supporters can breathe a sigh of relief that Tesla is not implicated in this unpleasant DRC conflict, not all the claims the letter writer makes are false. She is correct that Cobalt comes primarily from DRC; correct that it used often in electric car batteries and correct that such trade uses child labour and exacerbates conflict. 

And I'm glad I checked because I endorse Tesla as a company and I am a supporter of their products and if they were to use conflict cobalt then I would condemn them. "

I'd be more worried about gas station tanks leaking petrol and diesel than groundwater.
"There's been a huge interest in a town actually called Cobalt located in Ontario Canada where they think there are some substantial reserves. Numerous companies are involved and there was a great article on it by Bloomberg. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-10-31/the-canadian-ghost-town-that-tesla-is-bringing-back-to-life

I'll make an assumption here that Cobalt produced in Canadian mines won't have slave like conditions. The other side of the economics of course is much less clear than the note describes anyways. Without cheap labor most of those countries wouldn't have industry to begin with. It's the entire reason it moves overseas. "

"If those children weren‚Äôt working in the mine, they would be prostitutes. Capitalism is perfect! /s"
It's also worth noting that colbalt is used in hydraulic fracuring from time to time.
unlikely the increase in price is passed down to any miners or minors involved.
"The price has tripled because demand is through the roof. Child labor is still a thing and Tesla et al have done nothing  to curb it other than make hollow, feel good PR releases."
"Not sure if I understand you on that one. Apple does not produce, they buy someone else production? Also components come from suppliers. Than again if ""giants"" in cobalt consumption (aparently not) do source ethical cobalt (whatever that is) how come prices go up, shouldnt they go down, as no one is buying non-ethical cobalt anymore?"

(source I'm dutch and sick of those money hungry oil motherfuckers too, and disgusted that our royal family hasn't banned them from using the 'Royal' by now)"
"Let's say (hypothetically) that there's no way to ensure that cobalt is mined ethically.

That doesn't immediately invalidate it as a viable material.

Cobalt and other materials are necessary to push sustainable, clean energy forward.

The net benefit of sustainable, clean energy will greatly outweigh the current negative impacts resulting from widespread fossil fuel consumption.

With that said, it's absolutely on governments and corporations to vet their material sources, and demand ethical practices. Unfortunately, many companies in other countries don't care about child labor etc. so they will gladly buy up the supply that other companies will not, which further dives up the demand/cost for ethically-sourced materials."
"I would think that using child labor for cobalt mining would be terribly inefficient. That makes me assume that it is something to do with the government of the Congo being the reason American, European, or east Asian companies don't come in and build their own industrialized mining infrastructure that would have no use for child labor.  The only thing that makes cobalt mining evil is that the government won't let corporations make it benign.  

This is admittedly just an assumption based on the inefficiency of using child labor.  

I remember seeing a Vice documentary about mining of some other mineral in the Congo and it was literally just kids digging in the mud with hand tools.  I had the same thought that there is no way various corporations wouldn't come in and set up industrialized mining if it was actually possible for them to do that.  "

Use more from the non-evil sources. This requires capital investment. End use companies need to invest in upstream capital development. Not just in cobalt, but also in lithium and nickel. "

"I'm starting to hate the term whataboutism because it's used by people who seem to think that introducing new information shouldn't change the discussion.

If Trump is doing a bad thing, and someone points out that Obama and Bush and Clinton did the bad thing too, claiming whataboutism and ignoring the deeper underlying problem with our political system seems like a really disingenuous debate tactic. 

Getting mad at Tesla for using cobalt in their batteries and calling whataboutism when someone tries to introduce more data that paints a much broader and higher resolution picture of the problem is crazy.

What is the assumption here? We need to hold Tesla's feet to the fire for their 0.000002% consumption of a conflict resource even though they are far from the worst offender and you can make a strong argument that the potential good of getting us off fossil fuels is worth it in every meaningful way.

Sounds great. Any source for that claim?
"I wouldn't be mad if she didn't tell us that fossil energy is better. It's way worse. Also not every cobal production involves child labor. I think child labor is inefficient anyway, only idiots let kids dig with bare hands and not use mschines that dig 1000 times faster."
"Where is your concern for the children in Nigeria, dying from the toxic effects of the petroleum industry there?

The only thing that tells us is that children are doomed either way :/
Those season 7 carrier pigeons are faster than broadband
"Yes it would be whataboutism if Tesla would buy cobalt from companies that have child slaves. But they don't AFAIK. It's also strange or hypocritical to single out one product for using a material that is connected to exploiting children when the same material is used in many other products we use without any outrage. Who is getting angry at all the other battery using companies like Apple, Samsung, LG or Google? Why is it only a problem in a Tesla car? On top of that, this person defends Trump and his decisions to support coal and allow the coal industry to pollute the environment like rivers once again. That is way worse since it actually causes people to die. 

So yes, child slavery needs to end everywhere, no exceptions (I look at you Nike and other companies using children to make clothing and shoes) but I don't see how Tesla is the main target if their goal is the opposite of what the vast majority of the industry does and wants."

"Also, only about 2% of the world's cobalt production goes to electric cars. And only a small percentage of global cobalt production is from illegal sources - it's hard to estimate because those mining operations are secretive. But that also means they are very small-scale because you can't have a giant cobalt mine with tens of thousands of kids without someone noticing."

"There's a comment about it in one of the last 2 quarterly earnings conference calls. Going off memory here but it boils down to them actually visiting mining locations to make sure nothing illegal happens. Leaves the question how thorough they are, is it unanounced etc. Unless an independent party does a review we won't know 100% sure but I'm inclined to believe Tesla absolutely does not want to be associated with child labor."

"Tesla get their cells from Panasonic, and the company who make the cobalt containing element for Panasonic own a mine in the Philippines.

However, it won't be big enough for the Model 3 so Tesla is trying to make other arrangements, also without child labor, including in the Congo."
https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/01/no-cobalt-no-tesla/
"Well you can point out how shitty kids are at mining cobalt compared to massive industrial 50-ton trucks and diggers that *actually* do the cobalt mining. It should be easy to point out the idiocy of assuming that all cobalt mining is done by the most inefficient, unreliable, and slowest method possible. Really, which does he think is the cheaper and more consistent source: Pedro the mutated child who mines it by hand and purifies it by grinding rocks between his teeth, or DigCo the conglomerate with millions of dollars of machinery and a giant refinery that processes the rock in batches of 500 tons at a time?

Also, most mined cobalt is actually the result of copper and nickel mining, rather than dedicated cobalt mines.

The YouTube channel FullyCharged had a short segment on it at some point, and it showed the massive scope of the real mining operations, compared to the holes that people dug literally under their house to mine illegally. The scale factor difference is like 10000 to 1."
"Well there's a difference between not wanting to be associated with it and wanting not having anything to do with it.

One is image, PR etc. The other is not doing something out of moral reasons. Unfortunately most companies will only act when it's the first one. So they gladly hide behind layers of supplier tiers.

I don't believe Tesla is one of those."

I have to push back on the other side of the economics a bit. The reason to move overseas has much more to do with the location of cobalt deposits and the ease of extraction. Saying cheap labor is the entire reason is overly simplistic.

"> shouldnt they go down, as no one is buying non-ethical cobalt anymore?

No, because those unethical entities are still mining cobalt. So Apple, Tesla and others are restricting themselves to a more-limited supply of ethically-sourced material, which also costs more to mine since they are employing adult laborers at a fair wage."
Ethical cobalt is more expensive because they have to actually pay real workers instead of beating children to work in the Congo.
"I‚Äôm not sure on the other points, but prices would go up because the workers at paid better, presumably getting a living wage and maybe benefits, and also wouldn‚Äôt be children.  The reason they use child labor is cause it‚Äôs cheap "

You see why it's so effective right?

Or that children use to work the mines until ""burdensome regulations"" prohibited it. 

You could even see if Trump merchandise is made with child labor overseas if you want to counter argue that part of it. 

The point is to these supporters, they completely frame the argument and have us fighting like 3 false claims at once and I feel like we get lost in the weeds. There's plenty of material with Trump and coal to go after their faults all by themselves.

"Im pretty sure it's easy to tell if a mining operations is fairly legit. Go there; if there's a spiral pit 500 feet deep and a mile across with a bunch of 50-ton dumptrucks, it's a legit operation. On the other hand, if the operation is a family with a bunch of mutant kids and a shovel and they have a few hidey-holes they dug in their yard, then it's an illegal operation.

There aren't tons of environmental protections in that part of the world, but giant mining operations are impossible to hide, and they operate on a scale where child labor would be ridiculously wasteful and useless. They use machinery, not kids. When trucks carry dozens of tons of raw rock at a time, you simply don't build an operation that can accept input that is carried in by hand or basket. You'd need 2000 laborers to carry the load of one truck, and the truck can move much faster than them."

Here's the reason: **The people who make the ""Tesla=Cobalt=child labor"" argument are only aware of this relationship because the pro-fossil fuel propagandists have pushed that narrative because Tesla is a threat to their profit margins, and ultimately their existence.**"
most western people dont care about dead poors
"Turning fossil fuel use into a moral good without seeing the larger picture is negligent. We can take their concerns seriously while also seeing the propaganda that pushes their agenda.

Turning fossil fuel use into a moral issue is a way to try to slow its decline. "
Perhaps the USA could stop supporting our fossil fuel/opium/rare earth mineral wars for wealthy international corporations in the Middle East and work to eliminate warlords that conscript child soldiers and use child labor.
You can say that about virtually every raw material in the world.

All that says is 2015 production in NA is not enough for their estimate of cobalt needed by the packs for 500k cars per year. It's more than enough for current production, even when the Model 3 is ramped to 5k per week.

Also, I don't recall Tesla saying they would just use NA cobalt, just that they‚Äã refuse to use conflict cobalt. There is plenty of other global non-Congo cobalt to supply the Model 3, Semi, Y, S and X.

Finally, has anyone done a sanity check on the projected cobalt consumption calculation? Plenty of work being‚Äã done to reduce cobalt usage in NMC packs."

The problem I have with a claim such as his is it‚Äôs specifically designed to tug the heartstrings regardless of whether it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs also nigh unprovable. You‚Äôd have to provide cancer rates and mortality in every state, separated by age group, and then you‚Äôd have to provide (at least) likely causes for the different cancers along with facts to back up those claims.

"**Open-pit mining**

Open-pit, open-cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.

This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth, such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface; that is, where the overburden (surface material covering the valuable deposit) is relatively thin or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling (as would be the case for sand, cinder, and gravel). For minerals that occur deep below the surface‚Äîwhere the overburden is thick or the mineral occurs as veins in hard rock‚Äîunderground mining methods are used to extract the valued material.

Say what?  Who is ""shifting the blame"".  Tesla has responded that they take steps to ensure the cobalt they use is ethically sourced.

If you cry about the electric car industry causing cobalt problems in the Congo (which Tesla isn't doing), while at the same time participating in many other industries that _do_ cause more problems, and not complaining about those industries--- then yes, you are a goddamn hypocrite and you don't actually give a shit about cobalt, you just want to be against electric cars.

Companies should be praised in the media for buying these trucks! It says a lot about the company that they think about the environment and safety in traffic. It would result in more purchases from other companies too.
"That's a low blow, Loblaw. "
How much are these gonna be?
Bob Loblaw left law for Loblaw lorries?
I can't wait to see what they say about this on the bob Loblaw law blog

">Crazy how replacing 350 diesel trucks is the equivalent to removing 20,000 cars. Think of what replacing 20,000 semi trucks would do.

"I'm sure they are meant to be self driving. Luckily Loblaw is a Canadian company, so congress wouldn't apply here. I worked in a loblaw warehouse, and a lot of the deliveries from there would be inside the range."
Elon has said he will never make a motorcycle. He had a bad accident once.
"The economic imperatives of self driving are going to be so massive that no union will be able to stop it. The drivers' wages aren't even the main point here, the fact that got can run these rigs 24/7 is."

"Best part is the safety from the autopilot suite will more than justify the trucks cost even with the driver. I worked in insurance and big truck accidents are ridiculously expensive...

"After being T-Boned by a car on my first motorcycle, I intentionally sought out a loud-as-fuck Harley to ride on next so that people would know when i'm coming down the street. I don't think i'd want to ride on a super quiet motorcycle. But i'm sure it would be a cool bike."
I‚Äôm desperately waiting for a Tesla motorcycle. Zero isn‚Äôt quite there yet. I need 200+ miles at sustained 85mph. 
IIRC they said there were enough players in the EV motorcycle area already. 
Elon said in a shareholders meeting about 3 or 4 years ago that they would not do a motorcycle
There are already a few really good electric motorbikes.
"If the electric Tesla motorcycles are silently quiet I will donate money for all the extra sleep i will get. 

I leave near a larger street."
What's wrong with the Zero? they have been selling electric motorcycles for many years. 
Why wait other companies make them now
Zero Motorcycles in California has been making electric bikes for quite a while now. I'd take a look at them. 
Aren't there already electric motorcycles outthere?
"Have you heard about Harley-Davidson [Project Livewire](https://youtu.be/H7u9DTfE14M) I imagine whatever came of this is in production, but I'm not sure"
The Zero motorcycle fulfills this niche today.
Zero has this one on lock already.  
thanks!
Probably 2020?
That's a nice cult we have going on here...
How do you find that info? 
Sure.  Bulk discounts to volume buyers are possible.   But no one knows until it actually happens. 
"Yes, but in general it‚Äôs usually safe to assume margins are higher in b2b anyway. Especially when it comes to tech."
I sure hope they deliver more reliably and consistently on the b2b side. 
"That's a low blow, Loblaw..

"They may be pretty hard to avoid anyway, depending on where you live. Places I used to consider their competition are actually Loblaws.

Here's a list of some of their brands:

That said, I'm glad they're splashing some of our money on a good thing."

I used to work for them and generally they treat their employees better than competitors for sure. I'm a big fan of them. 
Aren't they closing like 22 stores this year? Whst does this mean for them?
The Canadian grocery store chain.
"Look, not that I want to get in the way of your clear agenda, but I think you may have some facts young. According to [this quarterly earnings report](http://s1.q4cdn.com/326961052/files/doc_financials/2017/q3/Q3_RTS_SEDAR_14-Nov-17.pdf) (PDF) for the period ending Oct 7, 2017, Loblaw Companies Limited, in the MOST generous definition, had $894 Million in net earnings on $14 Billion dollars revenue. So no, they haven't had an $11 Billion Quarterly profit. The same report shows that they YTD net earnings is $1.471 Billion on ~$35 Billion in revenue. I know it doesn't aide your rhetoric, but being factual should be the priority."
"This is a Tesla sub, not a political sub. Please go away."

Thank republican tax plans for this bullshit anti worker pro-consumerism

Edit

My bad didn't realize this was canadian company. But of I remember stephen Harper set up some amazing taxes for helping transnational corporations and screwing employees."
"B2B prices are slippery.  I work for a company that does B2B and B2G sales exclusively and damn few people in the company even know how much each sale is worth.  I'm sure customers are not all paying the same price for the same services and it wouldn't go well if they knew how much.

We'll get averages as they actually start being delivered."
Upper limit is $250k for the base model (smaller battery).  Hopefully under $200k.
Same exact thing happens at every new reveal... lots of misguided people out there who love see their own words on the internet.
"Nobody knows, I would speculate between 300k and 400k each."
What is this vin bot? I imagine it logs the vin number to the registration?

"Yeah, all jokes aside the orders we know of are nothing. But then again, without full autonomous driving, nobody was going to preorder hundreds or thousands.

These orders are all to determine how feasible it would be and when they will reach a break even price, for EV trucks.

Jake Paul lmao. I wanted one but can't even justify four wheels of model 3 for my knees.
"It's a weird ratio too, how about 1 semi : 57 cars. 

Also 20k semis would be 1.14M cars. "
"Oh, if it were only as easy as cross-multiplying 350/20,000 with 20,000/x... Which would *magically* give us our answer of 1,142,857 cars."
"Math, what is it? "

"""You sir, are a mouthful!"""
"I came here looking for this. Reddit literally never lets me down.

They could easily service the GTA area (10 million people+) and stay within range.
Wouldn‚Äôt unions be stronger in Canada? Wouldn‚Äôt they be just as opposed to self-driving trucks? 
There are 2 type of motorcycle owners. Those who have crashed and those who haven't crashed YET.
I have no strong feelings about this one way or the other. 
"I did too. As much fun as it is, I won't ride one again. Besides, Zero already makes electric motorcycles."
Source on that? I believe you I just wanna see it myself. 
Didnt the simpsons have an episode on this 15 years ago
"Oh, but they will try!"
Still have to book the freight m8
"I don't think Zero's products represent innovative electrification of motorcycles.

Adaptive lighting, self-balancing, crash prevention, autopilot features, et al. are not only possible, but highly desirable and highly beneficial (at the least in terms of safety) on electric motorcycles.

- [BMW‚Äôs Shapeshifting, Crash-Proof Motorcycle Is the Future Of Two-Wheeled Mobility](http://www.thedrive.com/news/5522/bmws-shapeshifting-crash-proof-motorcycle-is-the-future-of-two-wheeled-mobility)

Many of these features are still prototypical, but they do exist."
"Yeah..I'm just a fanboy. I'll look at Zero Motorcycles, thanks."
"Pack it up folks, electrical bikes won‚Äôt get any better than they already are. "
Tesla could reduce motorcycle fatalities by a huge factor if they just put in some cameras for speed limit recognition and a speed limiter :D
"Yeah, no. These trucks don't have a listed price but typically you are dishing out low 6 figures, and they don't really decline in value as they can go 1m miles without major service.

Nobody is going to drop 300k or whatever it is per Tesla semi just for autopilot, as it isn't even autonomous and truck crashes are insanely rare for the mileage they are driven"
"The lobbying of a tiny firm keeps the penny alive.

It really does not take much scratch to keep progress from being made."
"Such a struggle that we can't get electrically powered stuff and are depending on one smallish company to do it all.

Come on, you stupid free market! Millennials are/are soon going to be knocking on the door, better have your product ready."

Guess I wait another year to think about them"
Nobody hears a Harley until after it passes you. That annoying as fuck exhaust isn't pointed in the right direction.
[deleted]
Just add a cool sound system and drive with awesome music.
"Yikes. Wow. Hope you are OK/don‚Äôt have any serious long lasting injuries.

The idea of sound is indeed pretty serious. IÔ∏è know as a former hybrid owner that way too many people depend on solely their ears rather than their eyes to know if traffic is coming."
"In Brazil, we are full of shitty super noisy motorcycles. If I were the president, first thing I would be banning those loud fuckers. so many, so loud. I dream of silent motorcycles. "
">After being T-Boned by a car on my first motorcycle, I intentionally sought out a loud-as-fuck Harley to ride on next so that people would know when i'm coming down the street.

I have doubts that it works.

The noise isn't heard from far away, and really is just sudden. It's possible that this most likely is due to motorcycles driving faster then the traffic? 

As a car driver, the sudden loud noise Harley produces actually scares and instinctively makes me want to perform a sudden move until I realize it is just a motorcycle, and all of that happens in a split second. So in my eyes it actually decreases safety of the biker.
"
"Doesn't work at all. People don't hear you until your right there with your loud bike.
It is up to you to keep yourself safe on a bike. Not because it should not be other peoples jobs to drive well, but because its your  life that is lost if you get into an accident."
"Agreed.  I have way more close calls on mt quiet sportbike than I do on my stupid loud Harley. People swerving into my lane,  cutting me off etc. The zero is an incredible bike, very comfortable and lots of fun but the quiet thing is a no go for me. "
"I mean nothing personally, I'm sure riding a motorbike is pretty scary.

However, every time a loud af bike passes by me, I internally wish a 25 ton ACME weight falls on it.

*insert ""old man yells at cloud"" meme*"
"The Harley Livewire experimental bikes sounded great, but they weren't very loud"
Well once cars are autonomous you won‚Äôt have to worry as much about one swerving into you!
"I'm kind of surprised they don't make a fully faired motorcycle...  Improved aerodynamics should help the range, especially on a highway.  Someone had a modified Zero with a fairing built around it that had a pretty big range, I can't remember the exact numbers..

Found it, this was an older one that he brought from a 63 mile range to 200. https://insideevs.com/consider-it-done-modified-zero-s-completes-first-ever-cross-country-trip-on-electric-motorcycle/

so surely one of the newer larger battery ones has the potential to do more."
Where are you going so often that you can't stop and charge? 
lolz. You sneaky police car you. Are you Electric yet?
At the best. No earlier than 2022 in my mind. That's if they get through the model three ramp without going bankrupt. 
"You new round these parts, son?"
"A cult all collectively working to help save the world from CO2.

Oh wait.... ^^that's ^^actually ^^true."
Until it happens? As in they would have to disclose the price if a deal is signed? 
I presume you only shop at Costco then?
"I used to work there, they treated me a lot better than I‚Äôve heard Sobeys treats employees (basically the only other supermarket in NS)."
A nearly 7% margin for a grocery chain is massive. They must sell a lot of Joe stuff and their kitchen things. 
"My mistake. I said profit, when it's $11 billion in revenue."
Just like how Elon wasn't apart of Trump's board right? Had nothing to do with politics right?

"Well yeah, but pretty much all sales will be B2B sales, it's not like people are buying semis for personal use."
Source?
You mean same price as a Roadster?
"some of them misguided, most of them are hopeful. i really hope that tesla succeeds. not because i think they'll change the world or save the environment, but because i think it's REALLY cool. sue me."
thank you!
The vin bot keeps tracks of model 3 vins. This allows people to roughly guess how model 3 production is going.
"If you're looking for registrations, that's a *different* [Model 3 VIN bot](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/79p2wl/twitter_feed_for_model_3_vin_registrations_nhtsa/). "
The announcement was literally two days ago. People need to calm down on adoption rate expectations 
"Well, keep in mind the infrastructure needed for those trucks. How many secondary trucks are needed to just haul diesel fuel to the stations to fill up the fleet of 350? 20000? Get enough of them in an area and next thing you know the local fuel depot doesn't need to be as large. Trickle down effects across the whole chain.
Its not simple.
"
"Too bad its not.


I guess we'll keep having to use diesel, with homes powered by *clean coal*."
Math is a language 
"And also, the number doesn't really matter, what matters is the *immeasurable* effect on our ecosystem. Only time can really tell us how far these green efforts will get us."

"Lobbying isn't prevalent in Canada.

"When you are trying to change the world, be careful,  the people on top like it the way it is. "
"Idk about other bikes, but the sound from mine is absolutely not mono-directional. I‚Äôve had friends on one or two occasions ride my bike and you can really hear it coming from a block away. I‚Äôve seen it myself, drivers who begin pulling out into my lane from a driveway or cross street then suddenly stopping before they even look in my direction (this is actually exactly how I was in the accident with the quiet bike). People also definitely hear me if I happen to be in their blind spot. "
I hate my neighbor and his loud ass bike. Jerk leaves at 5am
"Yeah I‚Äôve heard that. 

But after spending a great deal of time riding both quiet and loud bikes, I strongly believe there is something too it. Especially in denser urban areas. People truly do notice me a lot more than before. "
With Tesla's designs nothing would be more appropriate than TRON's Soundtrack.
"I've got an electric scooter with an (admittedly not very cool) sound system, so I ended up finding an app which uses the GPS on your phone to alter the pitch of the Jetson's car noise according to your speed."
I like your style.
"lol, thats the one thing i dread about visiting the in-laws in indonesia. the millions of crappy 55cc scooters rolling around with little to no muffler. makes it really nice trying to sleep in a house near a busy road..."
"In India they modify the mufflers to make it sound obnoxiously loud. I visited Switzerland recently and my airbnb owner had been to India. First thing he recalled about the place was riding that bike that makes a loud noise like ""dug dug dug.""

P.s. I'm talking about Royal Enfield. They've started selling them in Europe too I think."
I hear you. I hate them too believe it or not. I started off bike-curious but now I‚Äôm a total fag. 
"Bikes are much much smaller than a car and easier to miss.

Sounds like it's doing it's job. You heard it before you saw it. 

"
I don‚Äôt disagree with you
"I actually don't think stock Harleys are very loud. I sought out a used bike that had aftermarket pipes that are pretty deafening. The bike will even trigger car alarms if I drive close to parked vehicles. I try to always wear earplugs and I feel really bad when I'm riding near pedestrians, particularly children which happens all the time because I live in an urban city. But unlike my last bike, a very quiet Honda Rebel, other drivers definitely hear me when I'm rolling down the street and I feel a lot safer."

How are you going to accomplish that? Are you going to volunteer to stop breathing?
"Publically traded companies don't have to disclose the value of every sale, but they do have to disclose aggregates.  That will give us some idea of the average.  They also have to disclose large business risks, which can include large cancelable sales agreements."

Trickle-down truckonomics 
"This is actually the thing I‚Äôm most excited about for electrics in general‚Äî removing or at least severely reducing the need for filling stations. No more paving over prime real estate in every corner of every city, no more semis making daily stops at these locations, polluting city centers as they do so, all so a bunch of cars can stop and siphon off their product 10 gal at a time. When most cars are electric, we eliminate all this pollution, traffic, and poor use of prime real estate. Turn it into condos or something. "
"It's all facts, no feels. I'd rather go with what's in my heart"

GTA = Greatest Toronto Area
"Ya don‚Äôt geddit, eh?"
"I don't think semis are allowed in the downtown core anyway, are they? "
"Because they factually are. No data of truckers specifically, and I had to look up the actually numbers, but I always thought It was common knowledge that Canada was more unionized. It's 38% of workers for Canada, and 11% for the US"
"Regardless of lobbying Parliament, unions would probably be able to prevent companies from implementing driverless vehicles in Canada better than American unions could due to the simple fact that unions are stronger and more prevalent there than in the US.  Why would you possibly think it was the other way around? "

"Fuck, man. Find a safer quieter way to get around. Noise pollution has become such a pervasive and insidious part of living in the modern world. It degrades our quality of life. And the most insidious part is that most of it is intentional, for the purpose of drawing attention to oneself at the expense of all others. Become a better version of yourself and start thinking of how many people you disturb, babies awoken from naps, and conversations you've interrupted.

"Honestly you just need to be more defensive, and not as offensive. If you're setting off car alarms I'm sure someone's eventually going to run you over on purpose, not to mention that pipes that loud are obnoxious as hell."

Having screaming supermarket kids and being safer is a myth. 
"I don't think it's spineless to care about the people around you and your impact on them. The dude can accomplish both by just driving a normal car. What's going on here is, he cares more about fuel efficiency or fun than he does about the feelings of those around him. Fair enough ... not saying it makes hm a bad person or anything, but this notion that it's spineless to care about your community just seems nuts to me. "
Thanks. 
You know what would also be safer for motorcyclists? Not riding motorcycles lol.

That's probably the best answer.  Your arse probably knows more about this than I do.
unless VIN number generated at random!?
Why there is no german wiki article about that topic... 
"Vin will tell you what the car model make and some other things depending on manufacturer like car colors and sometimes options 

But it doesn't give you any identifiable information about the owner or location "
As a passenger? 
"You misunderstand me. If the motorcycle is doing everything for you, you have a less safe and less comfortable car without any of the extra fun."
"Yeah I‚Äôve heard that. 

But after spending a great deal of time with both quiet and loud kids, I strongly believe there is something too it. Especially in denser urban areas. People truly do notice me a lot more than before. 

"
"Yeah, I still only notice the kids once they've whizzed by me."
"Yeah, the whole ""I want to be safe"" while choosing a motorcycle as their mode of transportation doesn't make much sense."
"It seems nuts to me how dramatic you're making motorcycle noises sound. He doesn't sound like he's the overblown biker stereotypes from South Park where he's running around in a motorcycle gang causing as much sound mayhem as possible. A little vroom vroom is a small price to pay in exchange for reducing your risk of serious injury or death. People keep saying that trade off is a myth, but he believes in it from his experience and personally it just sounds intuitive that the quieter you are on the road the less likely careless drivers are to notice you. But maybe there are studies on the subject suggesting otherwise."
"I, uh, did: 

>(see the Hurt report)

They're not.
"Sure, but I can walk up to a tesla, scan the vin, check the DB, and see that, oh, /u/QuantumField posted this vin, this is probably his tesla."

"Did you mean to respond to me, or to someone further up the thread? "
"fuck, if only i had the 'first language' excuse"
Why not
"I've seen it. But there are cars available there too. Might be more if a hassle, but safer."
"All good, it's Saturday! Or sunday! "
"There‚Äôs a standard associated with VINs. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number

EDIT: Changed it from the mobile site to desktop.
"
Why would they be?  They're not a secret number and random just adds complexity
"Hmm, well, I work in publishing and while ISBNs are standardized, you can register a whole chunk of them in advance at once (even before your books exist as concepts) and nothing is stopping you from then assigning them at random from within the set you own.

So, for instance, I could buy 10,000 ISBNs and then randomly assign numbers to the only hundred titles I publish and never publish again, but someone guessing may think I have 10,000ish titles if they applied an approximation method like the one mentioned here.

Is it possible VINs are registered in a similar manner? A manufacturer could randomly assign from their unnecessarily large pool of pre-registered VINs."
"**Vehicle identification number**

A vehicle identification number (VIN) is a unique code, including a serial number, used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, as defined in ISO 3779:2009.

VINs were first used in 1954 in the United States. From 1954 to 1981, there was no accepted standard for these numbers, so different manufacturers used different formats.

In 1981, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the United States standardized the format.

Because of competitive intelligence? Why freely give your competitors that kind of insight on their sales projections against yours? They surely don't offer it. Business is cut throat.
"No you can't ""buy"" VINs since they're required by law for the vehicle to be road legal. My understanding is that you can publish a book without having an ISBN but then get one assigned later.

With a VIN, as each car rolls off the assembly line, it will already have a VIN associated with it and the last 6 (If it's a company that makes 2,001+ vehicles per year) or the last 3 (If they make 2,000 or fewer) will be sequential."
"I'm not sure but I would assume other manufactures also do sequential VINs but might be obscured since they have multiple lines and multiple plants. 

This source makes it sound like other manufactures also do in order numbers.

TSLA is a publicly traded company. I highly doubt they don't tell investors how many cars they have made/sold. This information will become public at some point soon anyway.

I think a tent would have been cheaper and would have more room.
"What did you do about the 2 inch/4 cm ""bump"" where the folded down seat doesn't level out with the rest of the trunk?"

Some stuff goes in the frunk and other things get moved to the front seat. Have also brought large sealed storage containers that we would leave outside the car at night.

"You pack a tent and set it up, then you have a safe place to put all your stuff when you go to bed"
"Having done the same thing in a Subaru outback, and now doing it in a Tesla Model S, the Model S is amazing for space. With the Subaru, everything has to go on the front seats. In the Tesla, you have the front seats, the back seat footwells, sub-trunk (area under the trunk), trunk side pockets, and the frunk. It's really a decent amount of space. "

We didn't really feel it much since that's we're our butts sat. I used a 2.5 inch firm foam mattress topper (twin) from Ikea so it had a little support. I plan to make a spacer for under that section and cut the mattress into sections kinda like a DIY dreamcase

The filter must satisfy certain standards of efficiency such as those set by the United States Department of Energy (DOE).

To qualify as HEPA by US government standards, an air filter must remove (from the air that passes through) 99.97% of particles that have a size of 0.3 ¬µm.

Cute story but six foot tall people can also fit laying down in the Model S.
"A man who's a ""boss"" doesn't need approval, but he'd care about his girlfriends opinion."
"There's a difference between ""needing"" and ""bragging about obtaining the elusive approval of a woman to sleep in the car"""
"Yup. Ceteris paribus, any guy who can buy a Tesla can do better, girlfriend-wise."
You're missing the point of camper mode in the Tesla: you can keep the AC or heat on during the night without running the engine. Because there is no engine.
You can‚Äôt do 0-60 in under 5 seconds in a hotel though. 
That's an S
"Until recently you could not do this in the X due to the lack of fold flat rear seats.

Can you really see the stars through it at night?  Looks so dark though.
"Thanks for the clear answer; but aren't this just normal tesla features? It's kinda like saying cooking with a gas stove needs a different sub from cooking with electric. Product features are what set products apart, but if you're camping in a car, shouldn't that be its own activity with different cars to camp in?"
New glass roof is really dark. Can you still see stars? I haven't tried yet.
"This one makes a lot more sense, but there are cars with that amount of space, no? And *technically* Tesla's AC inductions are still car motors right?"
"There's subreddits for the hats that guy wore on 30 rock. It's not a big deal there is a tesla subreddit. Your critique is of a different thing, and you are being intentionally counter culture but incorrectly. You are acting like many people drool unwanted over tesla, and every thing about them, so the existence of a subreddits camping in one is egregiously extending a pretention you see. You Cray son. Maybe they do... but the subreddit is not that. "
Thanks!
"I tend to toss and turn and a sleeping bag just wasn't working for me.  I heard some good things about EE and ended up placing an order.  It works great for me and how I sleep, 20 degrees warmer than what I was currently packing, and a few ounces lighter.  I will even sometimes use it as a blanket while watching tv at home because it's so comfortable."
"I recently picked up an Enlightened Equipment Convert, because I was interested in trying a quilt, but a bit skeptical. After I've night with it set up as a quilt, I was convinced. I'm a side/stomach sleeper (I roll around between the two in my sleep) and it's so much better than traditional sleeping bags in that regard. I haven't tested it in super cold weather yet (I got a 0 Fahrenheit bag, my coldest night so fast were back-to-back 39 degree nights) but it's been great so far"
"I agree with what the others have said. It gives you so much more flexibility, especially in a hammock where it's nice because you're not cocooned in. You can zip it up and it pretty much turns into a conventional sleeping bag. The idea is you don't need insulation on your back because 1) you have a high r value sleeping pad or 2) you have an underquilt (in a hammock). When you have a traditional sleeping bag the back insulation compresses and doesn't do anything anyways. I've taken my 10F EE to Sub-Zero temps in CO and have been nice and toasty. "
"D models have smaller frunks, not due to AP2.

EDIT: It does appear all facelift even non-D models have the same, smaller, frunk.  This I assume that even though there is space there in a non-D model, less parts, cheaper/quicker manufacturing."
Horribly wrong.
You should have the option to turn on Climate permanently (Camper mode) until turned off or battery reaches 20%. No reason older cars didn‚Äôt get it. See the Climate section of online manual. 
Six foot four guy did it 
0-60 time is fairly pedestrian.
"A tent! A tent! A great, big, beautiful tent! Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape."
I think it was a joke.
"sure, but then they are RVs. Not a normal family car"
I'm pretty sure OP didn't buy a Tesla purely for camping. 
"There's been a  big demand for a Tesla / electric RV for some time now.  Camper Mode came from people finding ways to do this already, and the mini Semi will probably get some aftermarket RV conversion companies springing up around it.

The big negative with operating an RV is fuel use, and RV parks already have Tesla compatible charging outlets used to power normal RV electric stuff.  It's a natural convergence of interests."
The opposite would be the bigger problem for me. Camping at night in 80F+ was a miserable experience.
Also helps with the Tesla part.

"I wasn't really talking about a motor or not but in the interior of a Tesla Model S is the only car I have had that could sleep 2 quite comfortably as you can see in OP's post.

I live in Florida. Camping here sucks. 
"Canada, I generally camp in Northern Quebec or Ontario.

I also own a business and spend 3-4 months a year travelling by RV and working from that. A Tesla at the moment isn't feasible for my tow vehicle. However I'm confident it wont be long until it is. 

So of my two needs in vehicles, the tow vehicle is most likely to be replaced by a Tesla first as it's only waiting on the introduction of some superchargers to make it feasible. "
"Don't put gunk in your tire valve, it ruins the sensor! Leave the penetrating object in place, use a portable compressor to fill the tire, put a little watered down liquid soap on the puncture site and mentally gauge the severity of the puncture. If you think it is too severe to drive to a repair shop, use a tire repair plug kit, remove the shrapnel and plug the hole and try again. Then, if you still feel unsafe, as a last resort, put the gunk in the tire."
Trust your SO's view of you. You're good buddy. 
"I'm not arguing with you, I'm pretty much just saying I think it's pointless to have a Tesla version of such a simple activity, when being in a Tesla barely changes the activity; that's all."
Same thought here.
Personally I think the interior is the worst part of our model s. To each their own though.
"Pretty sure it‚Äôs small in all the facelift models. Mine is AP1 facelift with just the rear motor and I only have the little frunk

"There aren't a lot of people too tall to sleep in a Model S, there is a lot of room back there.  Put the seats down and see how much room you have - a standard mattress is too short to touch the rear of the car and the front seats at the same time.  "
"Ah yeah the presents an challenge. I'd like to get to north east Canada at some point. Theres some many amazing places that I want to backpack out there.

"I don't really know that much about tire repair, I was just pointing out the link, but that's certainly interesting to hear."

Probably should mention:

1. Do not use this on, or within an inch of, the sidewall.

2. This is a temporary repair, get it into a tire shop for a proper repair ASAP (Discount Tire does them for free)."
Give him a belly rub.
Well there's not a sub reddit specific to Tesla camping and if there ever is one don't join it and you'll be good I guess. 
Obviously ots a huge differnece if you can keep climate control on all night...
"And I don't mean to sound like a dick man. I'm just not sure why you care. For example, say there's a hundred forums dedicated to modifying old Hondas. I'm not gonna tell someone in one of those forums that they don't need their own forum because their Honda modifications are no different than my Toyota modifications. Because like, who has time or energy to care what other people are so enthusiastic about that they have their own community?

The things I listed that make it great are indeed just normal Tesla features. But are NOT normal car features. So, some folks think it's extra cool to camp In a Tesla. I'm happy for them. "
"I agree mate, its a bit weird sleeping in the boot/trunk of your car to say the least. Camping to me is when you have a tent or caravan or motorhome. Sleeping in the boot of your car is what you do when you're homeless. I wouldn't call it camping, and it's even more incredibly strange that there are subreddits and forum posts dedicated to doing it specifically in a Tesla lol. Each to their own though."
"That's what I was thinking, but I think I read somewhere that when HEPA became an option on the S it got smaller, still."
Frunk frunkity frunk frunk frunk.
"Thank you, I see the option to keep climate on!"
Oh I don‚Äôt have one. I came here from r/All. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5‚Äù though so I‚Äôve given up hope of fitting in any car like that
Yeah! and as long as it can tow a small RV I'm good. What I love about the Tesla's is their ridiculously high towing capacity for what they are. Should be no problem for my little trailer.
Many manufacturers are shipping that spray stuff without enough warning about ruining the tire  pressure sensor.
WHO'S A GOOD HUBBY??! WHOOOS A GOOD HUBBY???? YOU ARE!
"Doesn't change the fact that you're camping in a car. Car camping != truck camping, tesla camping = car camping."
"I care mostly because the Tesla circlejerk (example: vote ratio on my comments) is what makes people hate on such an amazing company. It's like rick and morty; cool show, but the community can be terrible at times, and that makes people hate the entirety of the community, and the show."
But alas you can't have a contradicting opinion on reddit without getting caught in the downvote storm.
I was told by my OA that it was due to extra reinforcement so they could get the top crash rating back again.
You're good in the back of a Model S.  They're huge cars - it's the only sedan with 7 seats. 
"And many newer sealants are TPMS safe.  Even the old stuff didn't usually hurt sensors, and the new stuff almost never does.  That being said, it's not a nice thing to do to the people at the tire shop, since the fumes from most of those products will practically knock you down when you unmount the tire.  This, and the cleaning issues, is why you should always warn them at the store when you take in your car after having used such a product."
[deleted]
"lol I don't downvote because I LOVE TESLA SO MUCH, I downvote because you're spending way too much time on something insignificant. If I see a comment chain that argues that [*obscure website/subreddit*] should not exist, I don't downvote because I love that thing, it's because it *doesn't contribute to discussion*, which you don't seem to understand "
"Unfortunately, quite a number of Tesla owners are akin to the crazy fanboy and elitism of a small minority (~49%) of Apple customers, with regards to viciously defending their irrational behaviour when it comes to their oh-so precious Electric Vehicle manufacturer, and of course their glorious leader Elon the Great.

But camping in the boot of your car is undeniably fucking strange behaviour indeed, which is crystal clear to any even moderately sane person. Even a decidedly *in*sane individual would wonder wtf is wrong with these clowns.

If this isn't unimaginably clear evidence that some Tesla owners are one sandwich short of the full picnic, then I seriously don't know what the fuck would be.."
It has 7 seats??
Thanks for updating my old knowledge base. Time to Google.
"because a tent serves an entirely different purpose than a car, and therefore is a different object"
"Not all of them, the third row is $4000 extra.  It folds down into the under-trunk area for camping though."
[deleted]
No idea how that passes safety regulations. Your kids would be liquidised in a heavy rear impact. Crazy idea having seats so far back they're in the boot.
"being in a motor vehicle vs being in a tent. A tent is far more exposed to the climate, and is essentially the most simple form of shelter. You can‚Äôt move a tent around at all easily compared to a car. It‚Äôs a mixture of mobility and the fact that you‚Äôre in a car. Tesla camping does not change the description of car camping almost at all, making it car camping. Period. "
"The third row seats in the model S are literally the safest seats in the car - and that car was already the safest vehicle ever made.  Tesla doesn't just pass safety regulations, it's the first manufacturer to break the machines designed to test them which is why it sets safety records. 

Other manufacturers might not be able to manage safety and instead cause passengers to be liquified, but Tesla knocks safety regulations out of the park."
">The rear crash testing was particularly important, given the optional third row children's seat. For this, Tesla factory installs a double bumper if the third row seat is ordered. This was needed in order to protect against a highway speed impact in the rear with no permanently disabling injury to the third row occupants. The third row is already the safest location in the car for frontal or side injuries.

I just completed my pre employment process to work at Tesla. Hopefully I'll get to help build your Model 3!
"Got my email to configure at around 1:30pm PST today 11/22.

3 years ago I was happy to get $2 to go buy a cheap beer. I counted change for a pack of cigarettes. I was a user. Addicted to everything, headed towards death.

I‚Äôm sober now, I don‚Äôt drink, don‚Äôt smoke, I don‚Äôt use any drugs, and am happy to say that I earn enough that my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt have to work if she doesn‚Äôt want to. I never thought I would get this far. When my parents passed away when I was younger, I was sure I would spend the rest of my life taking care of my sister. Never getting to grow up my self.

Then again single families own multiple Teslas so hopefully the number is lower."

Good for you! I love hearing stories like yours. 
"TIL design lab controllers are a thing. pretty awesome.
"
"> Xbox One Design Lab controller

Awesome. Link us to your design if you can. Had no idea this was a thing. Wish all systems offered this.. it's pretty damn cool.

And for what it's worth.. Most every person on this sub has been in a similar position in life as you are currently, at some point in time in their lives. And through working hard and making the best possible life choices we're able to with what we know, we've eventually ended up at a point in life where we're able to afford the things we've dreamed of. Like a Tesla. Or the ribeye steaks from the actual butcher, or whatever it is that you fancy.

I'm 10 years older than you and I'm going to have a Tesla as soon as I get the option to configure it. Ten years ago I was making 75% less than I am now, getting arrested for doing some stupid shit. But I grew up, worked hard, treated people right, and always tried to do better than I did the previous day. And so far, it's working. I'm not filthy rich or anything, but I can take care of my family and I can afford some kind-a nice things. 

Anyway, point of this.. is that you're doing a great job. You are headed in the right direction. You might not have it all right now despite wanting it now, but as long as you keep heading in the right direction.. you'll get there eventually. And you'll look back and wonder how the fuck it all happened. Because at the end of the day, you're still the same you. Keep making good choices. Never become stagnant. You'll get there.

Good job homie."
"Yup! That is currently the only choice. You can only choose (currently) body color, wheels, enhanced autopilot and/or full driving. "

"Don‚Äôt been an idiot , I was like you , I ignored facts about tesla because I thought other American cars will beat it but I asked my self ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the problem?‚Äù Sure I love the challenger demon and if i had the money to choose between the challenger and the roadster  I would go with the demon but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that every car has it own features that some people need for example the Honda Accord cost 25k and the Subaru BRZ is 25k , the Honda has better fuel economy , has 4 doors , bigger trunk, more comfortable, etc , the BRZ is faster , looks cooler , comes with a manual, great car to mod , etc 
In the end of the day what‚Äôs the problem with tesla having a big brand and what‚Äôs the problem with other car companiesaking electric cars it just means that they will compete to make great cars for cheaper prices and am pretty sure that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening with tesla and other companies like Nissan and Chevy , you being ignorant makes people think that you are the kind of guy that buys a 2006 v6 mustang and say hacks when a civic with a Manuel beats it "

In addition, the aero wheel is a wheel cover - the actual wheel is behind it.  That said, removing the aero wheel cover will purportedly drop range by up to 10%."
Supercharging should generally be cheaper than gas. Roughly 15 miles per dollar instead of 5-10 MP$ in CA. The efficiency of your gas car is important in the calculation. $3/gal @ 30 MPG is 10 MP$.

"Thank you! All very encouraging words. Yeah I‚Äôve been locked up a few times also. Almost spent a good amount of time once. But it‚Äôs all entirely turned around now! For a long time, I used my parents death as a way to say ‚ÄúThe world owes me‚Äù but I stopped that, slapped myself out of it. Bad things happen. There is no equalizing factor where you experience X amount of bad so you will have X amount of good.

You only experience the good you create. I was so focused on the past that I was missing everything in front me. I know a lot of people my age (specially in the area I‚Äôm in) think they are just owed things. No working for anything.

Then that means 6% of 400k which is 24k :(
Do you think west coast non-owners get priority over east coast owners?
Mmmm yes 4 wheels just the same as mine
"Ever heard of Reddit, duh?"
I'll bring the cookie!
"That won't be available until fall, next year.

My day one, in-person, non-owner reservation timeline for AWD is Aug-Oct 2018."
"I understand hat these things take time but they could expedite this process and completely take over the industry if they‚Äôd focus a little more on the affordability of their products. There is Honda and then Acura the parent company is the same but keeping in mind that not everyone can buy a new Acura but many could finance a Honda even at a sticker price of 30,000 most people would jump at the chance to do their part and move into the electronic future of transportation,"

Hard to tell from flair 
You can't talk negatively about Tesla here okay
Implying the same handle isn‚Äôt on the other side and the person taking the picture isn‚Äôt just an idiot 
Jag tackar. Ditt √§r inte d√•ligt heller.
Savage hahaha 
"If you're 12. Which makes sense, because you'd have to be to like those wheels. "
hey at least you can afford one.
"i wonder how the cutoff works. If you are an owner and just put a reservation recently, where would you stand in line?"
No. It's west owners then west then they move towards east owners
"RIP the whole of the UK, we have to wait the longest of all"
"The original time table was to have full scale Model 3 ramp up in 2020 if I remember right. Some time last year Elon announced they were moving that up to 2018, which is insane really. I expect there will be some delays, but considering the original road map its a massive jump forward."
"They pre ordered on day 1 and are current Tesla owners. What this thread is, that they confirmed their order and placed it with all the options they want and will get the car in a few weeks. They are at the front of the line."
When interest rates are so low it makes sense to finance it even if you could pay in cash. You make more on returns on investments than the interest costs you on the loan. 
Yes.
I'd rather maintain cash flow and pay some small amount of interest than pay all in cash 
Do you have just a spare $40-80k to buy a new car just laying around? 
If I can finance the car for 2% interest I'd rather take a loan and invest the money for larger returns via just about any mutual fund.
"Anything that decreases resistance and aerodynamic drag is going to increase efficiency.

This is true of any automobile."
"And what percentage of that are holding out for something not offered in early production? 

That number is certainly significant, so certainly they won't need to produce that many before public non-owners.  No way to know what it'll actually be, other than to look at the informal polling that's taken place.   "
"Do not fret. Delivery priority is still relative to your geographical location. As a Canadian employee, a non-Tesla owner living in California will still receive their Model 3 first, before me. "
"But there were only about 100,000 US owners when the 3 was unveiled so there could be 6k here in the states and some of those people will choose to wait for a AWD or Performance version."
"If I had to guess, I'd say yes.  Regardless of owner status, those west coast vehicles will be easier for Tesla to diagnose and troubleshoot should there be any early issues."
"The initial roll out seems to be more focused on efficiency, so owners will probably get priority for each new region served."
Now I have a target.
Isn‚Äôt Honda the parent company?
"Yeah, this is a *SAFE Space*..."
"In that case you couldn't even open the door, as the handle wouldn't allow it to open far enough for you to jam your fingers into the opening to move the handle. So it would have had to been fixed quite quickly."
"Or if you‚Äôre an economically minded adult, who recognizes utility is far more
important than the immature preference of falsely valuing looks. 

Also, those Aeros look sick as fuck"
"> If you're 12

Talk about being out of touch. "
"That's what the ""poor"" in poor tampa boye means"
"I have a co-worker that has a Roadster, who reserved online on day 1 or 2. I am a non-owner that waited in line at the Tesla store on day 1. My delivery estimate window is ahead of his by 1 month."
"Not being a Tesla owner and California, I hope so!"
"Nah, not as long as Australia"
"And Ireland. We usually get the UK‚Äôs dregs of everything :-(

On the plus side, I reckon I have one of the very first Irish reservations..."
"If I want to buy a 40-80k car, yeah. Otherwise, I buy a cheaper one! "
"Is it 6% of owners preordered, or 6% of preorders are owners?"
Yeah maybe spring 2019
"It is, the point is there‚Äôs a high and low end to almost every car company."
"True, i suppose the door wouldn‚Äôt have even closed in the first place then too"
What do those wheels save you? 10 extra miles? 
"the wheels are aerodynamic ?
"
"Being a cyclist, believe me when I say I'm more than aware of the importance of weight/aerodynamics. 

I still know when something is ugly, however. "
Oh it looked like you were on the list just upset you weren't first in line.
"this should be correct.  i tried to place a reservation on the night of 3/31 during the reveal, but it didn't go through...so i didn't get my official reservation in til the morning of 4/1.  i contacted them about it (trying to make sure i had the right place in line, i.e. 3/31 not 4/1 and however many people ahead of me in that 8 or so hours) and they basically said ""don't worry about it, since you're in california you're going to be pretty much ahead of everyone else anyway.""  not exact words, but that was the gist of it.

we'll see if that holds true, who knows..."
"When rates are so cheap it makes sense 

Edit:wasn't saying an 80k vehicle makes sense, rather an auto loan "
This was my thought exactly. A car isn't in my budget if it would take me the equivalent of 5 years to save up for it and get it in cash.
I'd rather have the cash in my bank and pay a little extra over time. 
"Unless the opposite handle moved together, the door can still open and close when you hold the handle down and keep holding it down to open."
10 percent.
"Well, the model S aero wheels saved 3-5%, so around the number, yes. But every mile counts in EVs."
Nahhh lol
They add 10% to the range.
"When an employee tells me not to worry about something, I always assume there's a like a 30% chance I don't need to worry, and a 70% chance it was just easier for them to tell me not to worry."
"So cheap being? Most auto rates aren‚Äôt that cheap. I prefer cash, but that limits how much car I can buy."
It makes sense to drop 80k on a vehicle? You and I have very different priorities. 
"Tesla is a passion for some people, not just a car. It's okay that people have differences."
That's what my mum always said üòâ
50 miles over 500 miles. I'll take the wheel upgrade. 
"Eh, pass. I'd rather give up the 10 miles and have nice looking wheels. "
"18 inch wheels also have a more comfortable ride, so it's not just the extra range."
"Title is a little misleading.  These are brands, not companies.  There is a distinction."
The hell is FedEx up to??
Starbucks? They make sugary and burnt coffee. What are they doing there?
fedex? I been waiting like 10 days now for my package
Da fuq starbucks invent? New ways to blend coffee? -_-
"Google should be on this list.  As in, Google should try harder to innovate."
Disney gets high marks for innovating new ways to gouge consumers through their partnership with Electronic Arts?
"Its great and all but the other companies reduce the meaning of this ""award"" 

Like facebook? honesty?"
"What has FedEx done to be innovative? Not sarcastic, genuinely curious."
Only Amazon and Tesla are innovative here haha
Disney? Why are they on this at all?
"The most amusing part of this thread is the sheer number of people who are completely ignorant of Disney's role as an innovator.

What Disney does is called experience design, and it's a form of interactive entertainment that they pioneered as a company."
Starbucks? 
"Google doesn't even make the list, and Apple is third place? Freaking Starbucks too? This list is so flawed."
"How is Starbucks and Microsoft neck and neck. Starbucks invents a unicorn Frappuccino, while Microsoft supports billions of computers. Not even close. "
what the fuck is innovative about starbucks?
Can someone explain why FedEx and Starbucks are up there for innovation?
Apple should not be on that list
HTF is apple on there they haven't had any innovation since jobs died
"Link to the study: https://www.us.kantar.com/business/brands/2017/most-valuable-us-brands-2018/
"
"Starbucks, what?"
Innovating new ways to burn cash!
FedEx?? They literally move boxes...
"Starbucks? 
FedEx? 
Huh????? "
**APPLE**
Disney and Apple more innovative than Amazon? I disagree
I'm surprised Starbucks and FedEx are on this list but not Google.
No google?
[deleted]
So is lower better or higher better? I hate charts like this.
how does one calculate innovation?
"These are all publicly listed ‚Äúbrands‚Äù - companies like SpaceX, Uber, etc. are likely missing because they aren‚Äôt listed on exchanges. Not sure what the source of this list is but it‚Äôs *probably* aimed towards retail investors."
"‚ÄúInnovation Score‚Äù
‚ÄúCompanies‚Äù

I love Tesla but this graph is just... odd"
Boy how is Starbucks there
How the fuck is starbucks up there? Lol
"    Starbucks?!
"
Are you sure this isn't just a list of the 10 most popular brands?
Didn't expect to see FedEx on that list. 
"""143? Charlie, that's terrible!""

""Wait, wait, wait. 143? 143 what?""

""Uhh... units!""

""Units of what?""

""Units of innovation!"""
Starbucks... And Netflix... It hurts 
"How are Disney, Universal, and Starbucks innovative?"
"The question is, How did Apple manage to appear on that list. Last time I checked they bought half their technology off Samsung then put it in the same style packaging as 2005.
"
"Disney? 

Starbucks?


Have we set the bar THAT low?"
">apple, a company who removed the 3.5 mm headphone jack for extra money, is more innovative than Amazon, who can send a blender to your house within 12 hours"
Gimme some of those Mocha Chai Latte 2.0!  
Now to work on their ability to meet their own productivity goals 
[deleted]
FedEx???
"Starbucks, innovative! Lol I missed out on their new seasonal toffee nut latte"
Since when are apple and Starbucks innovative?
I'm guessing EA was at the bottom of this list
"""apple"" ""innovative"" *gets triggered*"
Wow! No McDonald‚Äôs ?
"Meanwhile the Innovation Sand-Pit Garden at Starbucks HQ;

""We've done it."" 

""No... This moment feels like it would never come...""

""My career goals have finally been fulfilled...""

""Joel, I must thank you. For helping mine, and our colleagues dreams become reality.""

""The people of the world will surely know that something special is amongst them. Now, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues - watch.""

*Adds squirt of pumpkin syrup to whipped latt√© frappucina-lino* 

*Crowd gasps* 

""This, is true innovation."" 
"
What is FedEx doing that UPS isn‚Äôt?
They're #2 on the [Forbes list of most innovative **Companies** ](https://www.forbes.com/innovative-companies/#5c5ee5541d65)
I guess I'll take 9th....
I think there is a fine line between making something NEW and making something better. 
So hot hot hot Tesla 
"I wouldn't trust this list, apple is rated number 3..."
FedEx is innovative?
I'm not inclined to believe this considering the other companies that are high up on the list
How is Disney 'innovative'?
What does disney do?
How is Disney innovative?!

Surprising that Alphabet isn't on the list. 
"Apple. Lel

I have an iPhone but they certainly have not innovated anything, "
"Why is an entertainment company like Disney there?  To me, innovation also means something that improves our everyday lives. I don't see how Disney does that.   Disney bought a lot of other successful companies and makes tons of money.  I guess that is considered innovative somehow.  "
"Thats cool and all, but how the fuck is a technology brand that removes features every year, a coffee shop, a delivery service, and a video streaming service innovative??? 

‚ÄúUh yes, mark, we have REVOLUTIONIZED the coffee drinking and movie streaming and delivery aspects of everyone‚Äôs life. Think about it this way Mark; we are literally changing lives in a big way here. Just 5 years ago, no one was drinking coffee. We did it. We made coffee great again! Also, our delivery service is so innovative; more trucks, more warehouses, faster service, abso-fucking-lutely out of this world. I don‚Äôt think anyone but us could have thought it up, Mark‚Äù

Like, how is just making something bigger and expanding your business ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù? Every company aims to do that. At this point mega-companies have no competition. They never will. The rise of the Internet age is gone. There‚Äôs no more competing, everything is settled. Facebook is Facebook. Starbucks is Starbucks. It would take literally a miracle for these companies to go anywhere. There‚Äôs no innovation here. Just plain luck and standard business practice."
I wonder why EA isn't there
Disney>>Apple? FedEx = Amazon... sigh 
"Oh, didn't know Dongles were considered innovative. Good for them."
"Genuine question, what the hell has Apple done to get number 3?"
"This list reads like a popularity list. Since when is Disney innovative? Profitable, yes, creative, yes, innovative..."
"Yeah, abandoning a universal standard is so innovative. "
"What are most of the rest of those companies doing up there!? Amazon sure, I'd probably put them well above Tesla. Netflix is changing how TV is funded and distributed, that's fair. Microsoft is well past their prime. Disney, Universal, Fedex? And a fucking coffee shop?"
Apple shouldn't be there.
"all these brands are utter shit except for tesla and amazon. and even then, amazon isn't really ""innovative"" they're just the best at delivering shit fast.

but microsoft, facebook and apple ? i genuinely believe that these brands are hindering humanity's progress with their greed, shitty products and utter disrespect for privacy."
Disney? Lol
That is great and all that but just wait until they innovate thousands of people right out of their jobs. Won't that be wonderful.
"Lol, this list is a fucking joke. Tesla isn't even in the vicinity of these other mediocre brands."
Disney is innovative in the way they consume other brands growing their monopoly one day at a time.
" Wouldn't call taking out aux jacks from phones so you can carry around an extra adapter ""innovative"" ,but whatever floats people's boats. (Just wondering why people think apple is innovative lol)"
"By no means is apple innovative, unless innovative means the opposite if the dictionary definition "
"Apple, really? What did they innovate? Showing off ""new features"" that are years old?"
[deleted]
Tesla is the only one that is actually innovative there.
i don‚Äôt know how much i would brag... with some of the names on the list as competitors 
Testa hasn't done anything but use other patented technologies though.
Not difficult to be better at innovating than that bunch. Kind of insulting to be on that list.
"its easier to be innovative when the government subsidizes all the products you make.  subsidize the risk, privatize the profit.
"
Not sure what Disney and Apple are doing in there
APPLE?! STARBUCKS! Did a group of white girls make this list? 
Apple ?  innovative ? 
"Apple, really?!"
Why is Apple on the list?
"Yeah the math for all these brand values, innovation from brands, etc. are all based on faulty math from economists sitting at home thinking about the value of intangible assets. Because they try to be so precise, they end up looking precisely like idiots."
Yea. Like how in the actual fuck is Universal innovating anything right now? gtfo.
"Yeah, alphabet would have topped it I bet."
They are not mutually exclusive though
They've got some secret teleportation research going on.
How is it on the same level as amazon????
[deleted]
"The innovation is in how they convinced so many people they need the product. Really, it's **coffee**, but somehow Starbucks has made themselves an institution."
Its all on the operational side of things and in their marketing tech. Starbucks' ability to manage supply chains and handle individual location resource planning is actually super interesting and impressive and super data driven. 
I mean they *are*  one of the first places I could pay with my phone for half a decade before I could afford NFC payment tech. 
[deleted]
Guessing the innovation part comes with the fact that they still make billions off of sugary and burnt coffee.
They bought Teavana and then closed it down.
"Yeah, fuck everyone who can't go climb a mountain in Columbia with burro looking for beans.   "
"But that's innovation for you right there.  

Edit: actually this could be a fun feature.  

>[  ] **Not my package.** Select this option and we will make sure you receive something else than what you ordered."
That unicorn drink must be worth 50 innovation points haha
"Google innovates every week. That's why there's about 8 different messaging platforms on Android. Google, IMO, needs to get more focus and innovate in particular directions instead of just throwing it all against the wall."
"really? their machine learning stuff is insane, they're at the forefront of what may soon be the most important new technology in a long long time

they made a computer defeat the best human in Go, that alone should put them on this list, it's an absolutely insane accomplishment that we've been trying/wishing to do for decades"
It's a terrible study. Apple hardly does anything first anymore and they're on the list?
"No it's probably from the research lab where they have made a [room scale wireless charging](https://youtu.be/gn7T599QaN8) technology, as well as they're doing [advance tracking in virtual reality](https://youtu.be/Qxu_y8ABajQ) so that you can catch a real-world object while in a virtual space"
"Oh shut up.

Disney is one of the few on that list that actually deserve to be there. 

They are one of the leaders in innovation of computer animation, CGI and many other techologies, just check out the [Disney research hub on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/DisneyResearchHub/videos)"
Wait... EA is owned by Disney?
no it‚Äôs the antisemitism 
If anything facebook has gone way backwards in terms of innovation recently. What have they done to really improve the usability of their website?
Facebook is doing a shit tonne of innovative stuff in developing countries like giving them internet access and then only allowing them to access stuff through Facebook. A truely innovative company.
They are very innovative in finding ways to annoy consumers
"Facebook have been hugely influential in web dev the past few years, particularly with their library React."
Was just going to ask this. Curious to hear what the reasoning is. 
"I'd give Netflix a nod, too.  Their scalability and original content are truly innovative."
"Remember that Disney has all the crazy park technology they‚Äôre contantly researching. They have Disney Research as someone pointed out. They own Pixar. They own Lucasfilm. Probably most importantly, they own Industrial Light and Magic. Put those together and you have a ton of innovation, while it may not be customer facing quite yet. "
"Apple (less so now) and Microsoft are ehh. They're aren't of Tesla magnitude, but they do have SOMETHING to be on this list for"
Disney Research has produced some really interesting papers and stuff
"I think people are forgetting the magnitude of cult power Starbucks has produced through customer loyalty programs and mobile application usage. They do an unparalleled number of digital transactions every day and take care of their employees very well considering they are basically a glorified coffee shop. Lots of people love to hate Starbucks, but it brought coffee to a new level in America."
"You should really check out the [Disney research youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxu_y8ABajQ), disney isn't just movies and disney land []-)"
Probably because of Pixar: I‚Äôm pretty sure they still do all their software dev in house.
"I don‚Äôt know why people are so surprised of Disney being here, they are a huge company, they make their own rides, research into weird stuff and branch out into many other companies. "
There's that VR thing and if you haven't looked at everything else they've also made a real [room scale wireless](https://youtu.be/gn7T599QaN8) charging technology. It might be a little flawed right now but it's much more advanced than the wireless charging pads out there
"They have a solid long-term technical roadmap and invest quite a bit of money in artificial intelligence and streaming services. They are probably leading the speech animation race, and they have some insane story predictability algorithm that can determine what storylines would appeal to the audience the most, based on neural networks."
/s obviously but innovating gambling for children and perfecting microtransactions are stuff people will associate with EA and Disney for a while
ILMxLabs
"They literally made the American coffee industry into what it is. 

Tazo tea is a billion dollar company. 

Their extensive line of energy drinks are insanely profitable. 

I'm not up to date on their latest ""innovations"", which is I guess what this table is all about, but those points stick out to me. "
"I mean Apple pretty much reinvented the phone industry, so, you know..."
"Well they did reinvent the music business and essentially killed the CD. 

They also made the pocket supercomputer ubiquitous and an integral part of everyone's lives. "
"They innovated a mouse that you charge from the charge port on the bottom of the mouse 

**FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUSE.**"
I get a warning on Chrome when clicking this
Apple might be.  Disney definitely isn't.
"Google does not do shit, google copies shit."
"Not polish at all anymore, at least software-wise: iOS 11 is a total garbage."
Netflix actually *is* quite innovative.
"> Amazon, who can send a blender to your house within 12 hours

have you seen their 1 hour and 2 hour deliveries? once I ordered a wireless gaming headset late on a Friday night and it got to me in less than 2 hours, it was fucking insane"
There are only like 3 or 4 brands on this list that really do anything to attempt to innovate. Its a freakin joke to see facebook and starbucks on this list compared to Tesla and Disney. 
Their films and theme parks dramatically inspire and improve people's lives. To say anything different is total ignorance. 
Disney does a lot of other research projects as someone else said in this thread
"https://www.disneyresearch.com/

They are advancing AR/MR/VR tech, working on whole-room wireless charging, and all the Pixar-related tech that they have innovated."
"It depends if you consider what Disney has done with Star Wars and Marvel and creating interlocking film series. I think they pretty much invented that formula. Love it or hate it, it's making them rich."
"Netflix does a lot of AI stuff behind the scenes.

They have also done some pretty amazing things behind the scenes to keep all their back end computers up and running.

They have done some really smart things in their fight against ISPs who wanted to give people a lower bandwidth than they paid for and who even sometimes actively sabotaged Netflix traffic because they ""took too much bandwidth"" and because the ISPs had their own video streaming that they wanted people to use instead.

(Some ISPs sniffed the traffic and throttled the bandwidth or the response time (= increased the latency) or dropped packets on purpose when they detected Netflix traffic!)

Their tactics for getting all the video deals early on and for making their own (great) shows later on have also been rather innovative.

Pretty well done, I think, for a company that started out doing DVD rentals by mail."
Well Disney has a research lab and two of the big things that I can think of that has come out of there is the ability to [track Real World objects while in virtual reality](https://youtu.be/Qxu_y8ABajQ). Another thing there have worked on is [roomscale wireless charging](https://youtu.be/gn7T599QaN8) 
"Yep, a lot of people think of Disney only for movies, but the theme park division and research lab do bring a lot of innovation that is then used in others industries. Now, should they be n.2 I dont know. I'm surprise Google isn't on the list with their Artificial Intelligence research"
Settle down there Unibomber.  
That's actually a great argument against low-skill immigration.
"Their CPUs and GPUs are pretty damn good.  They have the best mobile CPUs in the world.  Their iDevices are relatively easy to program.  Siri is getting pretty good.  The face scanner thing in their new phones is pretty innovative.  And there is of course the general fit and finish of Apple products.  A lot of that requires not just blood, sweat, and tears to make but actual innovation behind the scenes (extra TCP/IP and Bluetooth protocols, for example).

Going to 64-bit CPUs in the mobile space long before the competition could also be called innovative.

(Apple bought a [brilliant CPU design team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.A._Semi) about a decade ago and they have been given all the necessary resources to iterate on better and better ARM CPUs until they now have the best.)
"
"I don‚Äôt know why people refuse to give Apple credit for improving facial recognition. No matter what OS you prefer, you have to admit facial recognition on Android isn‚Äôt secure and isn‚Äôt always reliable. "
You should look up what disney actually does. You watching a few disney movies means shit. They're the second most innovative company on this list easily.
Oh ok bc that would explain why there are no aerospace or engineering companies (other than Tesla and I guess we'll call Apple and Microsoft engineering companies) on the list. SpaceX would be at the top of the list with all the aerospace and architecture firms behind it
That would explain Facebook.
That's why Google isn't there

"it's really not even good coffee, just convenient"
"Realistically, the only coffee you should be drinking is black.

They've innovated the shit out of public perception which makes you think half a gallon of sugar, some milk froth, and maybe some caramel syrup ontop of satisfactory coffee beans is what you need to start your day.

I love latte's, Macciato's, etc. They taste so good. But that shit's bad for you. I guess I'll learn to like black coffee like I did whiskey.

By the way, have you ever tried dipping chocolate cookies into black coffee? I tried it this morning, holy fuck."
"Agreed. I went to a seminar with their CTO and some other head engineers, explaining the IT, big data, and security side of their company. It‚Äôs massive; the data mining tools they have are incredible. "
" there was a pikachu flavor?! ""Made with freshly squeezed pikachus?"""
"Lol, wut?

The key word here is ""innovative"". We've had coffee houses for a very long time. 

Maybe Starbucks is very innovative in ways I've no idea. AFAIK, they sell sugary and burnt coffee."
I'd order 99 cent shit all day on Amazon and hope they give me a TV instead
Well i guess no one loves unicorn in my country lol
Well they have the money to just say ‚Äúthis sounds good let‚Äôs launch it‚Äù even though most are saying ‚Äúwhat in the fuck were you thinking you just lost 50m‚Äù and they are all ‚Äúha ha 50m is a drop in the bucket we have more money than god!‚Äù 
I feel like Google today is what Microsoft was a few years ago before getting their shit together.
Least we can now send money in Android Messages via Google Wallet?
They actually don‚Äôt create an environment for real innovation either. They directly stymie innovation by buying companies. 
[deleted]
Googles strategy as a company is to purposely create their own competing products. 
OMG are you me?  That's basically my own brain's thoughts typed out by you. <internet handshake!>
"Not to mention all the shit that X does.

High altitude balloons for global internet (project Loon)? Flying wind turbines (project Makani)? Google glass (for industrial use)?

And Waymo is clearly the frontrunner in self driving cars. 

Seriously X kills off projects that are a hundred times more innovative than other companies even attempt (vertical farming, cargo airships, making CO2 negative fuel from seawater, etc)

So maybe Google itself shouldn't be on the list, but Alphabet should be at least in the top 5."
"You're right.  Their machine learning is pretty impressive.  I guess I was thinking about their search and mobile (Android) areas, where there hasn't been too much innovation."
Seems they should innovate in PR then.
"A notch in an otherwise great Samsung AMOLED is innovative, I guess. "
"They also have a robotics lab, and the newest animatronics are incredible. "

Now I firmly believe in long range electric highways wirelessly charging electric cars. Imagine being able to get freight across country for super cheap. 
Disney is also a major player in environmental conservation. Probably the biggest private  company.
"Calm down. Star Wars Battlefront II joke, if you've been following reddit at all this month."
Yeah I was terribly unclear there... I meant through the EA-Disney exclusivity agreement for Star Wars games. Both are separate companies.
Usability doesn't matter if it keeps people on your website longer.
Seriously whatever they‚Äôve done to the newsfeed since like 2012 is a mess imo.
I have an educational site and a Facebook page for it and constantly get questions from the Philippines asking basic info. I said just go to the site. Learned they can only use Facebook.
Wait seriously? That‚Äôs like 1 step forward and 15 steps back.

Well Disney is developing their own Netflix so...
Apple released the AirPods either this year or last year(I forget) but I would say those are pretty innovative. They‚Äôre also the first to put in facial recognition at the caliber it‚Äôs at in the iPhone X. They also did away with the function bar on their laptops. Well see if that takes off but I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty innovative.

"Starbucks is innovative based on their location strategies for their restaurants, not necessarily their products. Their growth has been pretty remarkable "
"If you go to Disney in Orlando FL and go through the Science and Technology parks, you will be blown away by the tech in their exhibits.  "
And https://www.disneyresearch.com/
"Ok how, it seems like they sell essentially the same product over and over "
"I don't know about innovation. 

They are just now catching up to technologies Android phones have had for years, and they overprice their underpowered phones. 

I think the only reason they're popular is because people think it's the cool thing to do when you buy their phones, but it's not the smart thing to do.

Just trying to get my opinion out, but it'll still probably get downvoted to shreds by you know who."
"Apple consistently uses existing technologies and markets them as their own brand new inventions once they've been established: 

- FaceID = windows hello (3 years older)
- borderless screens = Android phones from like 2014
- apple tablets = older windows tablet devices
- apple pen = windows stylus on every surface product and on many Samsung products

The list goes on and on, apple isn't innovative, they're extremely good at marketing and have a dedicated fanbase of people that will purchase anything with their logo."
No they did not. 
You're thinking of Apple
"Can't agree more.  I've had tons of little issues with it.  It's complete fucking garbage.  It's also inexcusable for this to happen, as it's only on a handful of devices, so there shouldn't be ANY issues.  Remember when it was supposed to ""just work"" with Apple gear?"
Damn that's awesome. I must live at the end of my town's delivery routes.
"Pretty sad if you think theme parks and carnival rides are inspirational.

A lot of child psychologists seem to think that pretend realities you put money into in order to derive pleasure are quite harmful.  Entire theme parks or even just one of those plastic horses you put a quarter into."
"Many people think that they pretty much ruined the Star Wars and Marvel franchises in order to maximize profits.  So yea, quite inventive either way...I guess."
"Well, yeah I mean at the time of conception, some of these companies were innovative. But that‚Äôs like saying fine-tuning your football routes or your video game characters dps is innovative. After the initial idea and implementation of that idea into a workable process, then it‚Äôs not innovating anymore, you know? Like cars were innovative a hundred years ago, now it‚Äôs just fine tuning. So I guess what I‚Äôm saying is I don‚Äôt see he innovation behind fine tuning something. To me an innovation is a big game changing idea. "
What? Capitalists obtain the least expensive labor they can and will pay handsomely to do so.  I see no connection to a historic felon and people being discarded by technology. Perhaps you are personifying your position on my random comment.
They definitely improved it. But the fact they didn't add a finger print scanner on the back is retarded. I've gone over to the Pixel 2 and will never look back.

"It's really a farce. Tesla shows up because their market capitalization is so much higher than their productive assets. And so it looks like they are primarily a ""brand company"" similar to the others on this list. When you think about it from that context, yes that's precisely why your heavy industrial firms - many who innovate a lot more than Microsoft - are not listed.
"
"No, but I don't get emotional about the math behind finance. So that's something at least.

Edit: and just to be clear, smart/productive people use reddit too."
I bet this time of year is fun for you guys.
Good on ya. This is not the norm across the country for FedEx as a whole. 
"Any idea why they pay that much? Feels like the type of thing they'd try to just pay minimum wage for. Are there just not enough people willing/able to do it? Competition?

Not saying you *should* be paid less, just that I'm surprised they don't try."
Check out how they did it. IÔ∏è work for the company that coded their customer feedback management Saas platform and its pretty cool stuff.
"Super hot take, man"
"I don‚Äôt know man. I mean hey, I‚Äôm not one of those people that goes out and gets Starbucks all the time but if I ever am going out to get coffee at any sort of chain, Starbucks is actually one of the strongest brands of coffee and in my opinion way better than anything you could get at McDonald‚Äôs, Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, etc. Obviously I‚Äôm not trying to compare to just making some great coffee yourself. "
"It's not even convenient, there's always a line"
My kwik trip is damn convenient and shit cheap
I'm gonna make a wild guess and assume you own multiple beanies and have beard that's too long for no reason. 
"I don't really drink coffee, but when I do, it's usually at a work function. When a client says, ""Hey, before we sit down, do you want some coffee?"" I say, ""Sure"" because they told me in sales school that's the right move. If they're really into coffee, it's something to talk about and if they aren't, you get a cup of coffee. When they ask me how I take it, I say, ""In a cup."" It usually gets a chuckle. "
There's a lot of middle ground between black coffee and frappucinos. A latte is just some espresso and steamed milk. How's that bad for you? 
"> Realistically, the only coffee you should be drinking is black.

/r/gatekeeping

There are lots of different ways to enjoy coffee. Don't be a dick."
"If you are going to go by that, then coffee should only really be drunk before the bean is even roasted, while it is still green, like the Bedouins in Arabia do."

Ever notice that netflix works better than amazon prime video?
"And then it's all released at once for binge-watching, something Netflix kind of started.  It's brilliant and novel. "
Isn‚Äôt that the opposite of innovating?
"Everyone is developing their own Netflix, like everyone developed their own Spotify"
I‚Äôd bet a curb stomping straight to my teeth that ‚Äútheir own Netflix‚Äù will be a colossal failure. 
"What was innovative about the airpods? There are some cool features, but nothing that huge imo

Also, I hate that my laptop doesn't have physical buttons at the top anymore. "
Apple doesn't innovate anymore so their irrelevant . But big player sure
"I don‚Äôt think the company has to produce remarkable products to be innovative which seems lost on a lot of people. This is just a coffee shop chain, but it‚Äôs turned itself into a culture powerhouse. Smart locations have given it remarkable real estate power, mobile applications that are on millions of phones, improved employee benefits to retain employees, all of these things make a company innovative."
Epcot is and always will be my favorite park because of this. They actually have some really cool shit on display there. And their latest attractions are freaking awesome.
"Plus, you have to be pretty innovative to be able to have a store as busy as the Disney store so busy.."
"Take a look at phones before 2007, then take a look at them after the iPhone had been announced. There‚Äôs your answer."
"People always bring up this point but Apple has never really been the first at things. Instead they wait for all of the kinks to be ironed out and then implement it properly, when it‚Äôs as good as can be. And iPhones are hardly underpowered. The X has the highest geekbench score ever for a smartphone, and the highest DXOMark photo score. So that point is a bit invalid."
"But they kinda did. They weren‚Äôt the only players, but they were the first to make those changes happen in a widespread way.

That said I don‚Äôt think they deserve to be on the list for those things that happened so many years ago. They haven‚Äôt done that much in the past few years."
"No, I‚Äôm not."
"Where are you getting this information? Last time I checked, having fun is a good thing. "
How have they ruined them? I dont see any decline in quality in either franchise besides the new Battlefront game.
You must come from a line of old whip and buggy money.
" Disney is a super-organisation that works in collaboration with its subsidiaries. For example, Disney works with LucasFilms Studios to produce Star Wars content (which then sell the rights to a shitty gaming company). When you see Disney movies they have projects with other big league players as well.

Having said that. Disney owns a shit ton of subsidiaries, call it downside of being a monopoly. They produce content apart from movies to everyday kids Mickey Mouse cartoons. They have to churn out a lot of content to fill the demand. That content requires its own production, with merchandise, marketing, the whole *shibang*.

Now consider that Disney has subsidiaries in different countries that produce content in those regions and sometimes share that content around. They pretty much have to innovate to survive."
"I'm out right now, just reply to this so I have a notification. Otherwise I'll forget. 

I'd just save it, but I'd forget. Lol "
"That's why I've always been against this misnomer term ""tech"" or ""high tech"" ever since it started to include companies like Facebook or Workday or Salesforce.

I bet 1 square footage of Lockheed Skunk Works has more innovation in it than the entirety of Facebook's existence. I would say Tesla compares similarly in this regard to Facebook.

Tesla or Lockheed, SpaceX, or GE are tech companies. Facebook, Snapchat,etc. should be referred to the ""toy companies"" category accordingly.

Also, no Google? Those guys are actually doing cutting edge software and hardware stuff, not making toys."
:(
"Retention, probably. "

It's shit compared to local coffee shops outside of America
Starbucks drip sucks imo but their espresso drinks are decent.
Einstein's Bros. man. Best fast coffee.
[deleted]
"> way better than anything you could get at McDonald‚Äôs, Dunkin‚Äô Donuts, etc.

That's like being valedictorian of summer school."
"It's good for fast food coffee, I agree with that, but in most places you could go to a local coffee shop and get much better coffee."
"By convenient I more mean there's one everywhere and all the coffee tastes basically the same no matter where you are, so you know what you're getting."
Do they spell Quick with a K where you live?
"I'm a woman first of all lol but no, and I really don't drink coffee that often, but when I do get it, the coffee at local coffee shops is almost always way better than Starbucks. It's not bad for fast food coffee, but in every moderately sized city there are usually better options."
"Ouch, nice try defending your lack of taste. No reason to bring us down to your level."
">When they ask me how I take it, I say, ""In a cup."" 

Not ‚ÄúLike my men.‚Äù?"
I don't know much about coffee beyond what Starbucks gives and what I make in my french press (just black) so I assumed anything at Starbucks is sugary so people buy more.
Didn't mean that in a condescending tone at all. I was under the impression that all coffee at Starbucks was sugar except for the black coffee. Which is just not good for your health.
"Yet again, shipping kills the deal."
Agreed.
it doesn't. Amazon prime has better compression and delivery than netflix. On a low bandwidth internet it makes a huge difference to make watching experience smooth.

"I'm going to be the most innovative of all, I'm going to have netflix and bad coffee and electric cars brand.  Innovate!"
you're on
"The ease and speed in which AirPods connect to your devices is unlike any other Bluetooth headphones. Also the battery life is pretty unbelievable for something that small. All down to the W1 chip they created. Pretty innovative if you ask me!

Also, why did you buy that laptop then? There‚Äôs many other laptops Apple sell with the physical buttons...

"
Let‚Äôs just ignore FaceID. And the health monitoring in the Apple Watches. And the power in the Biotic chip. 
"Ok so they innovated in 2007, this is a yearly list, what have they done recently "
"Yeah, I see a lot of people with that mindset. Usually because of [this image.](https://cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/beforeandafteriphone-640x259.jpg)

When, in reality, that picture is total bullshit and [this is what the industry actually looked like.](https://cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/beforeandafteriphone-640x259.jpg)"
"That doesn't reflect the actual quality and performance of the phone. In fact, a lot of iPhones have exploded, and Apple has done shit to help. The only reason the Note 7 explosions were a big deal is because Samsung themselves made a big deal out of it. Out of the millions sold, less than 50 actually exploded. And the Android phones I've used are pretty decent. Heck, I've used the Galaxy On5 and I prefer it over the iPhone, as a long time iPhone user.

And as for the part about Apple improving on things, that's not really true. They just wait for the technology to improve, copy that technology slightly different than other companies, and call it innovative when they implement it into their phones.

So yeah, Apple isn't really innovative."
"I would note that FB has a *lot* of R&D regarding Big Data and information processing.  Not that that's reflected in the chart, but there's something to be said for most companies like this.

I mean, that's kinda like looking at the Halloween Documents and going ""Oh... Microsoft actually *does* have a pretty good grasp on this whole OSS thing!"": they're kinda shitty for what they do."
">I bet 1 square footage of Lockheed Skunk Works has more innovation in it than the entirety of Facebook's existence.

We do some awesome stuff at LMC, but we've also got a lot of empty space, so the 1 sq. ft. thing might be a stretch. That said, yeah, Facebook is pretty fucking lame.

A friend said that Tesla doesn't innovate at all. The electric motor is not a new idea. I didn't know how to respond to him. What would be the counterpoint to his notion that Tesla doesn't really innovate?
Disagree about Facebook. They're innovators in software development and data processing. What other companies manage the sheer size and complexity of Facebook's networks? It's groundbreaking and no one comes close.
"Yeah you're absolutely correct. And unfortunately the media + general public are more concerned with consumer-facing toys. I will admit I get a lot of value from Reddit and Facebook (more than most for Facebook), but the real things driving society forward are inherently less visible.

But this just shows you how bad a lot of the measuring tools we have for businesses. Finance was my life for the past decade (no relationships, actually my life) and studies like the one posted just make me cringe."
"Salesforce and Facebook are acquisition machines that are snatching up a lot of innovative high tech companies. They're far beyond toy companies in the tech world because of their bank roll. Whether that's a good or bad thing has yet to be seen.

It's probably bad..."
But overtime is good for $$$
No it's shit compared to local shops inside America too. 
Why though? Is it not more cost effective to make better coffee?
Yeah but they contain barely any caffeine. Never wakes me up.
"I only go to Weinstein's, but thanks man."
"$1 large coffees right now too.  doesn't help the shit show, ofc.  but I like the price."
"Yeah I agree, usually the only times I‚Äôm in this type of situation is when I‚Äôm driving between cities and pull over off the highway to get some coffee so that‚Äôs where Starbucks is great for me. "
Why don't they make better coffee?
"I know but I have to argue that gas stations are more abundant and usually easier to get access to. Relating to coffee taste... people always fuck my shit up at Starbucks. If I make a bum cup at the gas station, I'm out $1.60 for 24oz vs $6 for 16oz"
"Yessir. Southern wisco. I'm pretty sure 90% of them up here are the k's tho

Edit: ya kwik trip is a la crosse Wisconsin company and they operate a few stations in Iowa too that are called kwik star in order to help not confuse people with the Oklahoma version of quik trip(which is the real OG I think. I didn't look at start up dates tho)"

"I work in aviation, one of the last bastions of the misogynistic homophobe. I can't be saying stuff like that if I want to keep the business relationship. "
"Not so much. Starbucks makes decent ""standard"" drinks like lattes, americanos and macchiatos. I see most people getting the milkshakes though, which are absolutely awful for you."
Not at my house. Amazon is far more likely to have streaming and buffering problems. Netflix is far more reliable.
Sometimes the best innovations are subtle.

"Is this a yearly list though? AR is a pretty big innovation. Not saying that Apple came up with it, because they didn‚Äôt, but they‚Äôre kind of the only major player pushing it right now. When we‚Äôre in the future, and AR is dominating, you‚Äôll look back and see how innovative they were in that respect."
"FaceID is an excellent argument to your last point. Apple themselves improved that tech, they didn‚Äôt wait for someone else to do it and copy it. They greatly improved upon it. "
And they have a lot of open source code available. A lot of it is widely used. https://code.facebook.com/projects/
"In my opinion, innovation is also combining already existing products/ideas into a single product. The iPhone didn't have any new ideas either. But the way Apple combined all those existing ideas made it (imo) one of the most innovative products we've had over the last 10 years. Just look at the amount of time people spend bumping up their online social status."
"Ask him what his definition or understanding of ""innovative"" is, and ask him to name 2-3 companies that he deems innovative.

When people disagree heavily, it's often the case that they have a different understanding of language.

Then you can either argue why his definition is flawed (""Shoulders of Giants""), why Tesla is innovative even under his definition or simply explain why you value other things. 

Do keep in mind that he might have a point - even if his conclusions are wrong. How can you expect him to change his mind when you are not open to change yours?"
"I'd say that the electric motor is one of the least innovative out of all the important parts of electric cars or Tesla. The software side of things (auto pilot, OTA updates), battery tech and production is where Tesla's 'innovation' is. Running a car company like a tech startup is innovative, or at least different.

People have been making electric motors for 100 years and the biggest changes as of late have been on the motor controller side (which is partly software and partly advances in semiconductor tech)"
"There are many counterpoints. 

It's true that the electric car is not an innovative idea. The engineering and the science behind the mechanical design of a Tesla is not very innovative. The ergonomics, layout and design of the cars are innovative. They change the way we think about infotainment. They change the way we think about interiors, the way we think of gearing and the way I Car feels. They change our notion that a heavy car will be lethargic and not dynamic (due to insta torque and low CG). 

You can also counter with what they do in terms of their business model too. Selling direct to customers? Innovative. Their service business model is innovative in their industry. The way they raise funds, the supercharger network, power wall , etc. The way they present themselves is itself innovative.

What goes overlooked and anti Tesla engineers and car guys like to attack is technical innovation. They're not inventing anything new and crazy, and people criticize this. I've worked with Tesla as a contractor directly and with machine shops doing contract work for Tesla. I can assure you that from bottom to top they are rethinking the way technology gets incorporated into the manufacturing process. They used my companies technology to innovate the way body panels are inspected by using a combination of laser and optical (white light systems) to measure the pieces. All with automated feedback and sorting.  Even on small pieces, like metal parts of the seats they designed test fixtures and provided methodology to their contractors for inspection. They saw a better way to do things and so they did it. This is just one example of the hidden types of innovation that go on in a company like this. It's a new attitude, people embrace proactivity and the idea of doing things better. This is the type of process innovation that is much harder for more established companies to do effectively. 

"
"Google, for one... "
"Amazon.
Shall we make a list?"
"How can you say consumer-facing toys are given too much value by the general public and immediately follow that with saying you get a lot of value from them? 

Your endorsement (I assume as an investor based on the finance background) validates their value as a business."
Yeah 16 hours a day 6 days a week 
"This could be BS, but I heard they over-roast their beans because it gives a more consistent flavor when brewed, and they want all Starbucks to be the same."
Still pretty far off.
"Yea, I remember getting the white mocha chocolate, I think it has like 70 grams of sugar in it. Crazy stuff."
"The tech used for FaceID existed in the Kinect (2010), yes. Is not new at all, I agree.

However, Apple is the first company to ever put this tech on a phone. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is innovative by definition. "
I‚Äôm far from an Apple ‚Äúfanboy‚Äù I just give credit where it‚Äôs due. 
"Dude the iPhone X is the NEXT BIG THING!!! The OLED screen is the cutting ed-- oh wait... what's that?? The screen is made by Samsung?

But Face ID is the FUTUR-- oh wait... Samsung had facial recognition like 4 years ago???

But the cameras!! Oh wait, Motorola had dual cameras like 5 years ago? Ok then yea, Apple kinda sucks"
"Mod note: removed for name calling and rudeness, further violations will lead to a ban."
"Yes it is the company who makes this this makes one each year. But pushing a product isn't innovation, if anything I've seen sony, htc, facebook and samsung create technology and peripherals and seeing as how apple literally has admitted they're keeping their vr technology on the down low I dont see where you got you info "
And that's about the most they did. Meanwhile there's Iris scanners.
Thank you. That's a good response I can try on him.
"Also, design can be innovative."
This is very wise advice which the vast majority of people fail to internalize. It's a part of what creates the violent divides in the world we live in. The world would be a far better place if people had that thought.
"He said that one company, Mazda or whomever, that came out with that advancement in a gas engine a few months back. The HCCI I think. He found that more innovative than anything Tesla is doing. I don't know how to respond to that."
"Thank you for this. Definitely saved. I wish I could just print it and give it to him. The sad/funny thing is that I got my P85 about a month ago and he has ridden in it twice. But since then, he's gotten increasingly distant and aloof from me... Some people..."
"Don't think so. They manage a lot of data, but not networks."
They manage networks but it doesn't come close to the size and complexity of Facebook's network management. Do you know what networks are?
"What I meant by my previous comment was that everyone's attention is on the consumer-facing toys. These toys still create value, even if it is disproportionately less than the amount of attention they get.

As someone who has studied nearly every US public company (how's that for a stupid intro, I'm a hoot at parties), it's really annoying to watch most people (and even most of my peers) focus on the same discussion topics. When asked about a stock, more than half the time it is about Apple. Another third come from Tesla. There are about 15 that get brought up occasionally. And the other 9,980 companies get no airtime at all. Studying companies is really fun, but also quite isolating, even within the finance industry.

Edit: And yes depending on how you look at it, they can be great businesses."
"Face iD is cool. They waited until all the sensors were shrunk and put it on a huge markup, and threw some nice already proven face recognition tech.

Not that innovative, but a high end application of everything already readily available. "
"Hasn‚Äôt it always been rare for Apple to be first to market with a technology but generally the company that makes that technology usable for everyone?

I mean their laptops use technology everyone else has but their fit and finish are another level. Their quality and integration is what has made them stand out not that they are the first company to do x or y. Many companies made tablets but Apple has made the tablet everyone‚Äôs parents and grandparents use. Lots of companies tried facial recognition in phones but Apple has been the first to do it in a reliable way that my mom can work with.

First to market is someone else. Delivering high quality and usable products to the greater masses is apple‚Äôs business model. And it looks like it has been working out when you look at revenues of hardware manufacturers."
"Tim Cook has always said that AR is the direction that Apple wants to take, not VR. So I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting your info. Also, I don‚Äôt deny that Sony, HTC, Facebook and Samsung create technology, but they‚Äôre not as innovative as Apple. Apple revolutionised the phone industry with the iPhone, the music industry with the iPod, and the tablet industry with the iPad. Not to mention the way they revolutionised how your devices all connect together with services like iCloud. "
"That aren‚Äôt nearly as secure, or as good. "
"No problem! As an engineer and car enthusiast I run into a lot of people who want to downplay Tesla. They're innovative without even talking about the engineering but I definitely became a believer in them after working with them. Although I still think the Falcon wing doors were a waste of $$$. 

Sounds like your buddy is just jealous he doesn't have insta torque! "
"You just wrong on every level. Google manages everything Facebook manages but x100 and with competency, Facebook doesn't even know how to do shit well at all that's already established for decades let alone innovate. I don't know if you're being paid by Facebook or just that dumb, jfc"
">These toys still create value, even if it is disproportionately less than the amount of attention they get.

This makes a lot of sense. Thank you for the clarification friend!
"
"I mean true, but a lot of people believe that they are the first. Also Samsung is starting to get there with the fit and finish on their phones. Samsung used to be the cheaper build, now i might prefer Samsung over Apple BUT... too much bloatware. Apple has bloatware too, but it's really bad with Samsung. I guess I should get ""The Essential Phone"""
Saying something and doing something are two very different things. Ipod I agree with they innovated the shit out of that. I would argue both apple and android pushed the phone industry they've been constantly out doing each other back and forth. I've owned both androids and iphone. Personally I like androids because it suits my needs but I understand why people like the iphone because it suits their needs. You just sound like you're an apple fanboy tbh
"According to who? No 2 irises are the same, but faces can."
"Haha yes I think so. He got a piddly gas ""turbo"" car and was so excited about the acceleration in it. I think when he saw what my car could do, he got completely deflated."
They don't manage networks at the level of Facebook. You're an idiot.
"True Samsung‚Äôs phones have improved a lot hardware wise. The software they use isn‚Äôt very intuitive and most of the older people I know who used android switched away to iOS. 

Also the halo effect is meaningful. If they have an iMac at home they are more likely to go Apple.  

Apple has tons of problems too but usability isn‚Äôt really one of them. For the most part it is intuitive. My 65 year old mother uses an iPhone and iPad. Samsung would have to make a very compelling duo for her to switch.

And that‚Äôs where Apple make their money. Few people will own a phone and a tablet and not want them to seamlessly sync.  

I want more companies to do better to challenge Apple but the tightness of software and hardware is difficult to beat."
"Is that really your argument? That I sound like an Apple fanboy? Ok then. I don‚Äôt disagree that android has helped to push the phone industry forward, but it hasn‚Äôt been as innovative as Apple was with the iPhone."
"FaceID uses 30,000 IR dots to create a 3D map of the face meaning it‚Äôs virtually impossible to fool it. It‚Äôs easier to bypass the iris scanner, as proved by some German hackers "
Do you even understand what networks are? What networks are you referring to?
"Its not my argument its yours, its trying to debate someone who is un-wavering in their opinion. There's no point in debating with someone like that. Its not a negative thing people can like whatever they want "
Hold on there right this second. Are you comparing an OPERATING SYSTEM to a PHONE?
Really? Then explain [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=94&v=i4YQRLQVixM)
"The networks of users they manage. They have 1.5 billion users, each with their own networks. And that's just Facebook, not including Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. There isn't a comparable system in place."
He's just gonna downvote us and say some stuff we don't care about at this point.
I meant android as in android phones.
"A number of reasons really. He could have just recorded a video then played it on the phone with excellent timing. Or, he could have added the mask as a face that FaceID could recognise. A 1 minute video isn‚Äôt enough to prove your point."
"That's not what network management is and Google has way more users than that. I'm not even going to bother with the rest of your comment because this is the most retarded discussion anyone has ever had or will ever have on the topic. Please take a long look at yourself and never, ever touch a computer again."
"yeah i'm correct.

god damn isheep."
Well Android phones have clearly moved the market forward a lot more than iPhones. The reason iPhone is popular is because hippies think it's cool.

Your argument makes no sense 
"You do realise that from the OG iPhone to the iPhone 5 Apple was pretty much superior to Android phones, not to mention that early Android versions were pretty garbage. The original iPhone was literally *the* catalyst for the smartphone industry.

But it‚Äôs not proof 
"**Network theory**

Network theory is the study of graphs as a representation of either symmetric relations or asymmetric relations between discrete objects. In computer science and network science, network theory is a part of graph theory: a network can be defined as a graph in which nodes and/or edges have attributes (e.g. names).

Network theory has applications in many disciplines including statistical physics, particle physics, computer science, electrical engineering, biology, economics, finance, operations research, climatology and sociology.

"I presume he was indeed talking about *computer* networks because 1) I've never heard anyone talk about ""network management"" in relation to network theory and 2) anyone knowledgeable enough to know about network theory cannot possibly be saying facebook is a world-class innovator that can throw pebbles at R&D goliaths like Google or Disney or Lockheed or even just Apple's silicon design team alone or Tesla's battery enigneering team alone or even just random university medical research labs probably... we're talking about a company that for 10 years had a messaging system more inconsistent, inefficient, and generally shitty than if they had just hosted an IRC server with software and hardware made hundreds of thousands of years before Mark Zuckerborg was even a concept. They buy innovative companies and often find ways to halt their impact on progressing the market, and buy horribly not-innovative companies like themselves that succeeded on implementing shitty concepts while attracting dominant user bases. That's the only way they've avoided being eons behind modern web design, product design, and everything design standards and shaved that gap down to just a few millennia. How tf could anyone educated call this company innovative unless something is seriously wrong with their mind?"
Neither does yours.

SO SICK. Glad I sat through the truck. BTW did he say he is releasing a Tesla pickup truck? Or just made it for fun?
I still can't believe that for some fucking reason I decided to watch a live unveiling of a semi truck. Then because of that I witnessed history with the announcement of the new roadster holy shit
"4.2s 0-100mph, sub 9s 1/4 miles, and 250mph top speed?

Straight line wise it's faster than the current holy trinity, is comparable to Koenigseggs in 1/4 mile performance, and approaches Bugatti territory in terms of top speed.

Now Tesla, show a sub-7m Nurburgring laptime (going to be hard considering the weight of the 200kw battery) and watch the whole sports car world bows in respect.

And that, my friend, is what halo cars should look like. Let's pray they can deliver it before 2022 :)

EDIT: I hope those specs are actually achievable and not just ""projected"" numbers to do a $250M Kickstarter project with the 1000 Founders series reservation lol. But I guess that beats borrowing more money :)"
FYI 0-60 in 1.9 seconds is 1.44Gs of acceleration!
I just about fell off my chair when it rolled out. The music was perfect! 
">>Tesla was also giving rides to anyone at the event who put down a $50,000 deposit on a purchase for when it‚Äôs available ‚Äì without knowing the full price. And more than a few avid Tesla fans were taking them up on that offer, too.

"How in the world did they keep this thing under wraps.  We all knew the roadster 2.0 would eventually show up.  Man, what a car!"
My body is ready. 
"God, this thing's gorgeous. It has a lot of subtle nods to the Chiron, I think (like the swoopy air vents under the front headlights), but I honestly think it's more attractive. And hell, if it's as impressive as Elon says it is, it's probably quicker, too."
It's like a McLaren but sexier!
This is a really bad article. They're linking pictures of the old roadster.
Isn't 0 - 60 in 1.9 seconds as fast as an F1 car?

Anyone have video from the live Instagram feed showing the acceleration? It was a static camera angle which showed the true speed of the car.

Shut up and put me on the waitlist
I can't even take the acceleration of the Model S P90D. A racing start in the Roadster 2.0 must feel absolutely terrible :D
"If they can cram a 200 kwh battery in this thing , what stops them puting it in a Model S ?"
Whats the dufference between the founders-roadster and the normal one?
"I would really like them to run this car around N√ºrburgring and see what time it can put out (when there are more of them obviously). Straight line performance is obviously phenomenal, but it doesn't mean much if a $200k (super) car can't put the g's down on a skid pad. I have complete confidence it will.  "
"0-60 - 1.9 sec

Car has similar torque of a modern day top fuel dragster.  That is ungodly.

"Go ahead and downvote me..... but I‚Äôm having a hard time believing that battery size. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I WANT to believe, it‚Äôs just a tall order.

"250 mph top speed, unbelievable "
He said 3 motors.  2 in back or 2 in front?  
Looks a lot like an R8 from the front.

"I really hope that tech will get passed down to existing models sooner than later. Like maybe the AWD Model 3 will come in a three motor config and an option to upgrade to 500+ miles of range (at least for a Model S, Model 3 might be too small?) But honestly, I've wanted torque vectoring for so damn long..."
"I wonder what the prices of the other Teslas are /were when they were released just to get an estimate what the new roadster will cost in Euro(pe). 

The Tesla Model S e.g. the S100D costs ‚Ç¨111k right now. 

What are the chances that $ 200k will translate to less than ‚Ç¨ 275k?"
This is the most beautiful and amazing car I've ever seen and with this performance too this is an amazing time to be alive 
Ludicrous.
ITT: People calculating how much they'd have to earn to afford this
"10000 nM of torque? Is it real or a typo?
Most diesel semi have 2000 to 3000 nM of torque.
Is that number real or just a mistake or they wanter to say that tesla semi has 10000 nM of torque but by mistake said this for tesla roadster."
Amazing
"I love the Tesla employees yelling WHAT?!?! Every time Elon says something. Reminds me of the really early apple product releases. 

"
"Ha, and the Dodge Demon just came out claiming the ""fastest mass produced car ever"". Well played Elon!"
"The 200kWh battery pack seem too good to be true, so I'm trying to figure out how it could work.

They manage to get 100kWh into the ~500kg battery pack of the Model S.
The Model 3 has a new cell and battery pack design, which I think is lighter, so let's say they are able, right now, to make a battery pack about 120kWh that weighs 500kg.

It seems like Musk's style to give the best possible figures, and it wouldn't surprise me a bit if the 200kWh figure is what they expect to be able to do in 2020, not what they can do now. If energy density continues to improve about 5% per year, they could get another 15% or so, making that a nearly 140kWh battery in the weight of the current 100kWh battery.

Scale that up to 200kWh and you have something like a 750kg battery pack. For comparison (someone correct me if I'm wrong here) I think the veyron engine weighs about 400kg, not including gearbox etc. which must be at least another 100kg.

Add another 1000kg for the rest of the car, and you have a not unreasonable total weight under 1800kg (for comparison, Ferrari 488 is 1500kg, Bugatti Veyron close to 2000kg). It probably won't have the handling of a Ferrari, or even a Bugatti, but it won't be a total juggernaut.
"
So what happens in a high speed chase scenario? Say someone robbed a bank and has this as their getaway car... you wont catch up to them.. 
That was one of the greatest unveiling's I have ever seen. 
Somebody grew up watching [Knight Rider](https://geardiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/knight-rider-kitt-1.jpg) and wants to make it a reality!
"hate him or love him, Elon Musk knows how to get people excited about cars. hopefully this forced other companies to step there game up."
finally i have something to motivate me again
"Used this link: https://rechneronline.de/g-acceleration/

To calculate the G forces on a 0-6mph in 1.9sec.

Wow, 1.44g's"
Does anyone know how they will manage to put 200 kw in the car? The model S 100d fits 100 kw and they said that that is the maximum to fit in the pack. Will this have a higher battery pack/ floor? Or have they made so much progress in dwnsity?
"Note to investors and customers who put down a deposit. These will not ship until 2022. Yes, I know they are saying 2020. Once it becomes obvious that it won't be 2020, don't pull your deposit and don't drive down the stock price by selling. Expect that it will be 2022 before they are delivered. "

"For a car literally called the 'Roadster', it's pretty fucking far from a roadster.

Very cool but can we talk about the near 5 billion in government handouts this company receives so they can turn around a produce a car that most Americans will never be able to afford to own? Wtf.
What semi?
Once it seemed like the semi bit was done I turned off. It now appears that was a mistake.
Went from a semi to a full chub
"In all fairness, the two products have different target markets."
"Wait, what? 7000 lbs-ft of torque? "
"Not enough people freaking out over *600 miles on a single charge*!

A big complaint I hear from people when I try to sell them on the idea of Teslas is ""I wouldn't want to roadtrip with it, not enough range."" which I think is a valid point (in the US) even at the 200-300 range on current Teslas. 600 miles changes the game though!"
"Unbelievable specs. For any vehicle. That torque, 0-60, and quarter mile are nuts. Then you add the range and it just doesn‚Äôt compute for me. It‚Äôs ridiculous. "
">2020
So 2023 then? "
Production starts 2020 is most unbelievable stat.  Did they produce these numbers on a drag strip or are they just estimates based on the motors and battery pack?  I‚Äôd assume a huge factor in producing that kind of 0-60 time is the tires.  Being soft enough to hookup with that kind of torque will mean they‚Äôll be toast in a few thousand miles and performance tires aren‚Äôt cheap.
"Was I threw only one annoyed with how the presentation said ""nm"" instead of ""Nm""? Second time I've seen that. I spent so long trying to figure out what 10000 nanometers was about."
That 200 kWh is wrong or the 620 miles includes towing a model X.  The existing Roadster does 340 miles with 80 kWh.

Looks like a bad copy of the Porsche Mission E.
Yep but it will be banned at drag strips.
"I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we get new legislation limiting vehicle accelerations and top speed.  Or at least making them selectable so that everything starts in ‚Äúchill‚Äù mode unless you specifically turn it on.  These cars are fun and exciting, but they can also be very dangerous and we tend to forget about that.  Pressing the wrong pedal on a Buick and you have a few seconds to realize your mistake.  Hit the wrong pedal on a roadster and you are doing 100mph before you blink.  The acceleration on the semi will be interesting.  With a loaded trailer, shit is going to bounce around at those fast accelerations. Also, trailers may not be used to those high loads caused by sudden accelerations.  I think we will see damaged trailers and cargo as the semi starts rolling out. "
I think that was just the Semi cab attached to a flat bed.
I believe they are making a Tesla pickup but what they showed was just for fun. No information on it yet.
On twitter a while ago (at the same time he first mentioned the new roadster) he said they would be making a pickup truck at some point. Idk if the one he showed at the presentation was it or if they‚Äôre going to make a more standard sized pickup later on.
The semi isn't history if it comes to fruition?
"Well, I watched the semi reveal and tuned off when it ended. Past 5 minutes have been me wondering why they just announce Roadster 2 without an event. ""Oh, wait...""

Anyone have an recording of the roadster release?"
"Got a link for a video of the whole event?  I missed it and I enjoy all the nitty gritty details, not so much the recaps."
"Around 10:45 Eastern time, I thought to myself ‚Äúam I really staying up until midnight to watch a semi truck unveiling?!‚Äù  What a time to be alive....  "
You're lucky. I sat down to watch the event but the stream kept freezing on me so I gave up.
Lol I was watching specifically because there had been constant suggestion of a new Roadster for a while and i figured it'd be unveiled at an event like this.
I feel like a complete moron for shutting the stream and going to bed the moment the semis drove off. Woke up to this. 
Aero is the main issue for a sub-7m BTG lap
"If anyone shows a ""sub-7s"" Nurburgring time, they would have accomplished a miracle, lol."
"Tesla gets its gaudy numbers from fantastic aero efficiency, but that also means they aren't ""spending"" some drag on downforce which is necessary for good laptimes, even apart from the weight issue. I am curious what kind of times a heavily modified version could do, but I don't think the stock roadster would be anything special on a track compared to other cars in the same price-range. "
He said that this is the base version in the reveal. They could easily sell a track version with a 100kw or less pack and other changes to improve lap times.
Yeah this thing has to weigh a shitton. 
"The Koenigsegg just beat the Bugatti for top speed. They did a 2 run average of 277, with a top speed of 284. Regardless it's insane."
250+ mph
"Problem with tracking a Tesla is they overheat in under 1 minute.

The larger battery pack may allow it to go long enough to finish a 7 minute course though, which would be awesome."
"Umm, there was already an electric supercar that did a sub-7m Nurburgring lap time this year.

"> and watch the whole sports car world bows in respect.

I think we will watch the sports car world self-destruct. Half the fans will be saying they were cheating because x y or z reason, the others will be like ""oh come on, learn how to lose""."
LOL thanks for the fact but I'm pretty sure most people have no fucking clue what 1.44G feels like. It's almost as useless as the 10k nm torque stat. 
"Yeah, the medium acceleration. The peak value during 0-10mph is probably over 2Gs."
I don't think you can accelerate faster without aerodynamic downforce. The friction coeficcient of you tires won't allow you to.
You can get an idea on [this video](https://youtu.be/izhYXO9wKz0?t=493). (the rest of the vid is cool as well)
Don't tell me you're going to get one when Tesla brings it out?
Still something to be said about the jaw dropping sexiness of a Lamborghini or Ferrari. This is sexy but not Ultracar sexy
The Model 3 was a smokescreen for the Roadster. Elon is an evil genius. 
"no its not, trust me.."
I think it looks more like an Acura NSX than anything else.

Doesn‚Äôt the car have to be produced before being the fastest production car in the world?
"Koenigsegg set an average speed of 277.9mph earlier this month, though it saw 284mph on one pass."
"Quickest, not the fastest. But yeah, absolute monster."
With audio cutouts and not in HD?
"Are the specs any different?   Perhaps it'll have a ""founders series"" badge/label somewhere?"
coincidence?
The whole front end looks rather like the Mission E.
"Hmm fitting chains on the wheels during snowy weather looks mighty difficult with those covers there. No way to check the slack adjusters if they sit that low but they probably use a different braking mechanism than air. 

Those semis will look ridiculous all sleek in the front but the trailer just being a normal shipping container or 53' dry van."
"It's 10,000 Nm of ""wheel torque"". Is that different from the typical definition of torque in car specs?"
I suddenly want to buy an OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA.
Cost?
"Existing space. It's possible the new Roadster pack is double height using the new size cells which are already bigger than the 18650s. There wouldn't be enough clearance under the current Model S to fit one of those, the whole chassis would need redesigned around it.

I'm guessing it's either a flat double height pack, or the pack is taller under the front and rear seats."
Concept cars are notorious for having unorthodox steering wheels. The production version will have to pass federal regulations. The show car just has to look cool for investors.

"They did demo rides, and the acceleration looks plausibly like 2.1 seconds. They wouldn't be able to achieve that without already having the appropriately-sized battery pack in the test mule."
Looks like the prototype doesn't have a trunk or frunk. If those areas are stuffed with batteries 20 kWh is totally do able.

Yeah holy fucking shit. Not like you'd ever drive that fast though. The more important stat is the 1.9 0-60. The acceleration will feel insane

"It's 10,000 Nm, but they say ""wheel torque"" on the website. Guessing that's different from the combined torque of the 3 motors?"
100 kwh at 500 kg is not the theoretical maximum of batteries. That's just what they managed to do with a standard model S budget. 
"It's a prototype. Maybe they can't yet fit them in, so some of the cells are in the frunk or trunk. Maybe they expect their cells to be good enough in a few years so they will be able to fit them. "
"Batteries degrade from charge cycles, yes. If we assume the average American drives 15000 miles per year, in this car that's only 25 cycles. Lithium ion batteries used in these cars can withstand a minimum of 500 charge cycles before degrading. That's 300000 miles driven before any noticeable range or performance degradation"
"The motors may need new bearings after 1m miles+. The packs will probably be warranted for 8yrs+, and unlimited mileage."

First gen was called the Roadster as well. It was an Elise. It just works like that. 
"> can we talk about the near 5 billion in government handouts this company receives so they can turn around a produce a car that most Americans will never be able to afford to own?

Do you know how many GWh of batteries and GW of solar panels they will have to produce to actually receive those 5 billion? Or do you think Tesla has already pocketed that amount and there was no strings attached?"
"Encouraging American businesses and jobs isn't important to you? How about the fact that the Model 3 has more US-sourced parts than ANY other vehicle, including ones from the big three?"
My memory isn't so short that I've forgotten about all those government auto-industry bailouts.  
Sure we can talk about that after we talk about how every gallon of gas burned forces our kids to pay 3.80 in environmental and climate change damage.  Wtf.  
The one they used to bring the roadster -nevermind
"I was actually reaching to do the same when I heard the sound system say ""...plaid"" and knew exactly what was coming next after that."
"seriously wide tires front and rear (possibly wider in the rear but still abnormally wide tires all the way around)

and they are probably skirting the edge of traction limits with the launch controls even then.

edit:
>tires on the Roadster are Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2s sizes are 265/35R20 front (diameter 27.3 in), 325/35R21 rear (diameter 28.7 in)."
"Ease down Ripley, you've blown the transaxle. You're just grinding metal."
" according to  /u/mrstrangedude :

> Keep in mind that Tesla is quoting 10000N/m of WHEEL torque, for comparison, a 911 Turbo S has 750*3.909 (1st gear) *3.44(Final Drive)~=10100N/m of max wheel torque in 1st gear.

> Actually, it also seems to be lower than the Model S P100D's wheel torque: 1250*9.73 ~=12100N/m, Tesla wants them big numbers for PR it seems.

Edit: it acutally makes sense that the roadster has less maximum wheel torque, simply because its geared to reach higher top speeds. 
"
Most likely at the wheel after gearing. The number directly at the motor will probably be more realistic. 
"Its a 100% meaningless stat that people will be wanking about forever, if the last 1h is any indication.

You can calculate torque simply by taking the HP*5252/ engine rpm.

This means if the car has 1000hp on the wheels, it will have that toque at 750 rpm. So basically, like the first 0.2s after getting into motion.

At those low speeds, any >$100k sports car has enough torque to make their wheels spin.

"
"Yup, thats crazy. Never really thought about that though, given the US and other countries are so huge, having to charge your car vs fill up kinda sucks. In the UK, 600 miles pretty much takes you anywhere. Even 300 miles would be fine, I‚Äôve never driven more in one go. 

I guess what I‚Äôm saying...batteries are borderline never a problem in many countries already, but in places like the US where everything is spread out and longer drives are more common, it‚Äôs a much more significant challenge. "
That'a a greater range than gasoline vehicles
Try 300miles when you drive it in the streets...
*2020 production. Other manufacturers have said similar numbers but then as well. All talk until we see it
"How does it change the game? It's a $250,000 car. As far as I know, the average person won't own that except maybe people who manage to make over half a million a year. "
"Let's be honest here, you won't get  600+ miles if you are pushing the car hard or accelerating a lot.  That 600+ miles was highway speeds, which is the most efficient way to travel.  It makes sense for the larger battery though, I bet if you were to track race the new roadster you'd eat up that battery in just an hour or two of racing.  Not a bad thing, but something to think about..the reality of the mileage limit.  "
"I think someone put the kibosh on Elon's enthusiastic fire-lighting under Tesla's staff.  He went quiet on Twitter for a bit and hasn't been making his grand claims, so my guess is these estimates are accurate to the degree that Tesla is *always* slow to launch a new vehicle.   But if the Model 3 is any indicator, ramp-ups are improving steadily despite the inevitable ""hell"" issues."
Tesla is pretty good at making low volume cars. Producing these will be nothing compared to the Model 3. 
Well yeah but you normally wouldn't floor it all the way through your daily commute.
"I already go through tires in 5000 miles on my model S, and that's par for the course with my ICE 2-seaters as well.  We don't buy Performance cars because we're hoping to save money on tires... and the new Roadster is a lot more of a Performance car than my seven seater that was a bargain at half the price and a third the performance.

Tires are everything.  They're literally the only part of the car that does real work.  Every other aspect of performance cars is just trying to make those tires more effective, but the tire is the only part that touches the road and that contact is how all the work happens.  Cheap tires means bad performance, old tires means bad performance.   Great performance means a big tire budget... and even still, did you hear those tires complaining as people took their test drive launches?  Traction wasn't keeping up, that was the loudest Tesla I've ever heard, and the cool night air is probably not even close to all of the reason.  My guess is customer cars have a lot more rubber on them that we saw last night.


My biggest anticipation now is track times.  Is battery cooling under extended full throttle solved?  Will the 200kwh pack allow for more than one hot lap?  My guess is yes, you don't make a car that has these numbers go into limp mode from a heatsoaked battery after the first minute.  "

"It wouldn‚Äôt, because of they can‚Äôt spend it.

"That depends. I am curious to see how fast it actually is around a track. I have no doubt it'll be a straight line bullet, but we'll see if it is able to hang with other super cars in that price range. That is edging on 720S or Huracan Performante territory in terms of price.

If Tesla actually manages to make a car that can hang with those, I will be blown away. But, I have a few doubts."
<sheepishly raises hand>
Those are available now. This is vaporware.
Hopefully it can drive on the track more than 45 seconds before overheating though.
"Personally, I'll buy 20"
Around that price. Same with GTA and Hurcan both under 200k. 
"No, probably the Nissan GTR. "
"A 911 Turbo S does a 2.4-2.5 0-60 for the same price as a Roadster. You could buy two GTRs that do a 2.8 for that price. An NSX does a 2.9 for a few thousand cheaper. The Corvette Z06 does a 3.0 for less than half the price, and the ZR1 hasn't been tested yet but will be faster. This is not to mention the Dodge Demon with a 2.3. Really not sure why you chose the R8. 

Also we will probably see a next gen Turbo S, Huracan/R8, GTR, and hopefully Viper by the time this thing comes out. "

No wonder they didn't include those in the renders on the website.
"With that much torque and power, would you really even need a wiper? 

One squirt of the accelerator and any water or debris on the windshield would be gone, and the axis of rotation of the earth might be off a little too. "
"Insane theory but the wiper detaches.. wipers are a pain for aerodynamics and designs, so Tesla could try to cheat the system and make it removable. I don't know if it's even legal to drive a car without one, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's what they are hinting at.

Otherwise it's really really ugly "
The uni-wipe
Wow didn‚Äôt notice it until you mentioned it. And now it‚Äôs all I see. That thing seems massive 
I'm amazed there is no better technology to replace the wiper yet...why not have a stream of air or something less obstusive
"I looked a little closer and it seems there is no obvious frunk opening. Without an ice in the front they might just screw it shut and removed the gap between the windshield and the front part where the wippers normally ""hide"". So there is no real space to put it other than where it is. I guess we will see a normal wipper-hidding-gap in the end, but we will see... "
It's from aerodynamics I guarantee it.

LOL good catch.
That would then reduce the max power output when you hit the pedal. 
"Right, and that car is not a production car and costs well over 1M. It also has a smaller battery to save weight, which is crucial for the track.

The Roadster is optimized for straight line performance with the biggest and heaviest battery pack they can find, it will be a hard challenge to make that setup work on the track."
Aero downforce at 0-60 speeds is negligible even for F1 cars. It only really helps when you get to higher speeds.
I wonder how many just put down 5k to get an test ride with the intention to get a refund the next week. 
Maybe you can talk me out of it.  I really hate buying new cars because of the depreciation.  
1.5 fucking g.
"Yep, but F1 isn‚Äôt exactly known for 0-60 anyway, in fact modern F1s are faster at 60-120 than 0-60.

They also corner at 4G lateral acceleration and can brake at up to 6G in deceleration, they are in a completely different world than any street legal cars."

My point is we give 5 billion to advance their technology to ""better"" the environment. 

They produce a 200k sports car in return, when the speed limit is 65mph. (In most states.)

How is this helping the environment for 5 billion dollars of tax dollars?"
"Not arguing for big oil here but, lets be honest here shouldn't they be developing cars that everyday americans can afford? If its about the enviroment then dont you think that makes more sense?

Only semi I saw was the one in my pants
Probably not unleashing at 7000 at a standstill. Similar system to boost by gear.
"They are, someone did the math a while back. "
I'd bet the tires are totally unique to the roadster. Or borrowed from Bugatti's Michelins. It takes a lot of engineering to make a tire that can handle 250 mph speeds and really rapid acceleration.
"That torque isn't what's delivered to the road. It's the additive theoretical torque the three motors can produce when mounted directly to a torque gauge.

They can probably put down 500-600 ft-lbs without drag racing spec tires. It's not physically possible to put any more on launch.

However, the torque is very useful on the mid to top end to achieve such insane quarter mile times."
some years ago the motorcyles were accelerating so fast they had to find a way to make sure the tires weren't slipping around the wheel 
"Wide tyres does not give more traction, it just allows for the stability to use stickier rubber, in which there are road laws dictating how sticky tyres can be."
"I think you're a bit confused here... Torque has a real-life relevance, while HP is the meaningless stat. In a dyno, torque is measured and HP is calculated. Torque is a real, measurable quantity in any rotating shaft, which corresponds to how much force the shaft can apply at a distance from its centre point.

So 10,000 Nm means that 10k Newtons of force will be applied 1m from the centre point of the shaft. So if your motor were hooked to a single 0.25m wheel (assuming no losses), you‚Äôre applying 40,000 N to the ground. 

Also, no gasoline car will have 1000hp at 750rpm, that's just ludicrous. "
"I regularly did 560mi straight, driving to and from college. Charging would have been annoying, but doable. This would eliminate it altogether... along with eliminating all my money both current and future."

Really weird hearing someone say that they have never driven more than 300. I did 400 last week just to drink with a buddy last weekend.
Like that's bad?  My big ass brick of a Jeep with a 22 gal tank maybe gets 325ish on a long trip. 300 mile range is still nothing to sneeze at.
"Even then, $250k is still reaching, at least for reasonable people."
"This is going to work just like the rest of the automotive industry, with new tech. Mercedes and BMW will bring out new tech and advances in their high end cars, and then 5-8 years later we'll start to see that tech trickle down to affordable cars.

The next iteration on the Model 3 will be carrying these 200kWh batteries and these new motors."

"As if most drivers take their precious car to the track.

EDIT: They could probably build a track version with a much smaller battery and reduced weight."
Tesla has a long way to go to match a car like a 720S around a track. The obvious potential problem is the weight -- the Tesla will be heavier so will have to somehow make up for that disadvantage. Another problem is going to be heat dissipation -- the Model S cannot take more than a few minutes of track driving without overheating and going into lower power mode. It seems to me that this would be a bigger issue than cornering.
"Was looking at the 720S and those are $330,000 but sold out, so you have to wait for next year or longer or buy on the used market for around $360,000.  The 720S is fast and that would be something like 9.8 sec 1/4 mile.  The 720S is temperamental, and you have to take care not to overheat the car.  

There is no way this Roadster can hang with the 720S on the track, but I am not a track junkie, so that is not important to me.  I don't see many people track their supercars either for that matter.  Usually I see people bring in their track cars which would be GT-R, Vipers, Mustangs, Porsches, Miata, NSX, Lotus, Ferrari, Corvettes.

At $200k, I would easily pick the roadster just because I don't want to buy a car that just sits in the garage."
"Would be cool if it was good for tracks, but not necessary.  Also this could be one of the first supercars that people daily drive and has relatively low maintenance.  Not like a car you garage and take to the track once a year."

Rainx helps too. Had the wiper motor in my truck die 700 miles from home once. Really didn't feel like changing it in the pouring rain. Decided to try rainx and managed to drive through 300 more miles of pouring rain with no issues. Changed the wiper motor the next day at home in the sun.

"Not op, but that's the level where you will have requirements for a roll cage and a parachute at a drag strip. Remember that this thing is accellerating constantly for 8.9 seconds and it already hit 100 mph 4.2 seconds in.

"No. Just like the Dodge Demon, because it is so fast you will not be able to drag race it without special safety equipment such as a roll cage installed."
NHRA safety rules. Anything that fast would require a roll cage and/or a parachute (don‚Äôt remember the exact speeds/restrictions offhand) so in stock form you‚Äôd get one pass maximum before not being allowed to run again.

It won't be banned everywhere but you'll have to go to tracks that are used to dealing with such beasts. Or maybe the tracks will be modified to grow to the new need.

edit: on strips long enough it would require an NHRA Competition License and you'll have to have a roll cage, wear a helmet and fire suit.

The jump from 250+ to 284+ mph is not a simple task. 
"This is going to be challenging. 

Motor power isn't the issue. With 3 modern electric motors, you could push a car to 300mph.

But doing so requires continuous peak power. The larget battery _really_ helps with this, but also means you have a lot more car weight to get up to speed.

If we take a weight of 2.5 tons (Not that unlikely, looking at the battery weight alone), at 250 mph the car has about 15 MJ of kinetic energy.

So at 1MW, it would need 15 second peak power output to go to that speeds. But thats ignoring air resistance & the like, which will eat up a lot of that power duing the last 50 mph or so. 

And most likely, they want to actually keep driving at 250mph for more than a few seconds.

To get peak power output for something like 2-3 minutes sustained, they really have their work cut out for them in terms of thermal solutions & the like. I certainly expect the production car to have more air vents than the prototype here."
[deleted]
"The Chiron, Venom F5, and... *possibly* the One:1  or Regera are eyeing 300 mph. The Agera RS hit 285 one way, but it just claimed the speed record by averaging out at 277 mph on a two way run.

Maybe Tesla will hit those numbers, but I don't know man. That is one hell of a hurdle."

Obviously the Tesla development team has managed to make battery cells far denser than what you have in your car today. It's just a matter of getting a fast and cheap way to mass produce them. With a roadster you get a bigger budget per battery pack.

If you didn't sell it's not a profit
"Curious, but when you're driving, isn't it a convertible for all intents and purposes? You'd have to look somewhat behind you to even notice. I think looking to the side, it will be barely if at all noticeable?"
"This [electrek article](https://electrek.co/2015/06/02/complete-breakdown-of-the-4-9-billion-in-government-support-the-la-times-claims-elon-musks-companies-are-receiving/) has the basic break down of the 5bi subsidies you are talking about. 

$1.5 billion was for past solar panel installations. The other two largest ones: future discounts in the gigafactory sales tax and Buffalo lease, are meaningless without production and also have employment and capital expenditure requirements."
So did you listen to asssuber? Did you then look into almost any other new large factory in the US?
Are you speaking to the $7500 per car tax credit when you keep referring to a $5B tax giveaway?
"If you don't make electric cars desirable no one will buy them.  There's a reason teslas depreciate slower than cheaper uglier electric cars.  Teslas are the only electric cars that might help get you laid.  The econo boxes might make it more difficult.   
And what the rich can buy today the middle class can buy or rent tomorrow and the poor can buy or rent the day after that.  "
But once the roadster came out it was no longer a semi.
That semi in your pants will cost 250k.
I doubt it has a gear box
"Yeah, his math concluded that the fastest time that can be is 2.0 seconds, but he deduces this from the braking times (with ABS). However, ABS is not as good as an anti-spin system controlling an electric motor, because ABS has moving parts while with a motor you just need to adjust the current (no physical moving parts)."
Wider tires mean more contact area which means more grip. For a while I thought it was retarded to have wide tires because my physics teacher told me that friction does not depend on the contact area. But it turns out that this is only true for rigid surfaces.
"I've always been under the impression that straight line traction is better with more front-to-back contact patch, which you usually get from taller tires.  Left-to-right traction is improved with wider tires."
">  there are road laws dictating how sticky tyres can be.

Not here there aren't.  Where are you from that has a legal metric of tire ""stickiness""?  I'd like to see how that's measured and governed, it seems bizarre to me.

In the US where the Roadster is from, race rubber that wears out in less than 50 miles of street driving is perfectly legal, the only legality concern is tread and DOT certification, not grip capacity."
"Love the down votes on this one. It's counter intuitive but correct, the only thing that matters is the coefficient of friction on the rubber."
Horsepower can't be meaningless though right since it equates directly to energy. A car that needs to get to 60mph has to be imparted a certain amount of energy and that's Horsepower * time (or the area under the curve thereof).
The next iteration of the Model 3 will probably have these new motors and the 200kWh battery in it. I'm pretty sure all they did was take the R&D from the Semi and put a car frame around it.
But for trips as long as this it would be responsible to take a break sometime. And in this time you can easily charge your car sufficiently.
No pee or poo break? Food break?
"In the Netherlands 150mi would be a very long drive. I live around 220km (around 138 miles) from my parents and every time they visit us and we go out for diner, the waiters comment about how long the drive must be. It's the other end of our country. 

Probably why there are so many Tesla's in The Netherlands."
"Lol yeah, furthest I‚Äôve gone is probably 250 or so...and that was mind numbingly boring. Can‚Äôt imagine going double or more of that, especially in places where the scenery doesn‚Äôt change a lot. 

Stack up some good podcasts and just deal with it I suppose lol. "

"There's no way some dash display won't be there.  Looking at the center screen is fine on a commuter aimed at potentially self driving, but people don't buy a car that does 250+ so they can look down to find out how fast they were going when they swerved off the road."
"At 240 mph, that‚Äôs just 2.5 hours :-P"
I assume he meant registration
"Yes, yes it does. 4.2% of the value of the car every year. A nearby city is 6% a year, but they're trying to pass legislation to end it."
It has an active spoiler. It‚Äôs show in the press image. 
"*this is going to be heavy and that should help keep it on the track.*

*""Weight Is The Enemy""*

- Colin Chapman, founder of Lotus Motorcars. "
"I mean, weight is useful in the sense of downforce from the air pushing the car down to the track... but heavy cars are generally not extremely rapid around a circuit. The GTR is an exception to that rule. I don't know if EV's will somehow be an exception to that because of the way that weight is distributed, but we'll see. Generally speaking, you want substantial power in a car that is light. Power to weight is pretty darn important, and even with some really tricky engineering you can only fight that weight but so much. Especially when it comes to cornering and braking.

 But you are right that I don't see a lot of focus on aero here. Even if they have gone with a lot of underbody aerodynamics... i'm not seeing a ton of focus on aerodynamics in the bodywork or any active aero as you pointed out. It's a stretch, but maybe they have adopted a similar approach to McLaren or Lamborghini in using aerodynamics that are not immediately obvious. Like the Performante's invisible airflow through the wing, or the 720 S having aerodynamics that are pretty much under the body work.

I'm also really curious to see how they will handle the sensory aspect. In terms of steering feedback, and feedback through the chassis. Did you see that super electric hatchback concept from Renault? I wonder if the roadster is going to produce some kind of noise, similar to that. You could hear a lot of the mechanical components working in the car."
You've got it backwards. Weight is bad. The less weight the better. 
"I am a bit curious about the 1.9s 0-60 time with the amount of Aero shown, too.

There is a reason that F1 cars are faster 60-120 than 0-60, they need the downforce to get those >>1g accelerations to stick to the road."
"Seems like (Y) rated tires are a minimum assuming you have enough road to get to 200mph, much less 250. 

I don't miss the tire game -- replacing 345mm tires on my Z06 wasn't fun on the wallet, still a necessary part of the game.  I suppose if you knew you weren't going to go past 170 you would get away with W rated.  Then again at 200-250k, tires are probably the least of your concerns.  

With insurance companies flipping out recently over the ""P"" designation of Model S's, wonder what they are going to try and stick people for on premiums for this bad boy. "
How can a 200 kWh pack fit in this? Is there a some kind of breakthrough going on in energy density....
"I mean that's cool, but I'm really talking about braking and how it handles in corners. Acceleration is only part of the picture, that's what I was getting at."
"With 200kw could this mean there is 2 x 100kw battery, so the car could use one while the other one is actively cooling. It would prevent overheating the 2 at the same time and use this car to race a long time."
"Prediction: It destroys everything for the first ~~2 laps~~ 100ft before it overheats and goes into reduced power mode.

FIXT"
"Think about it this way, if the average highway speed in America is about 70 mph you can only use about 28% of this car's potential performance on a public road. In places where that speed is raised to 80, that's 32%.

You can barely tap into what this car can do on a public road, by default its performance can only be explored on the track. Even if owners don't ever do it, it'll still be put through track tests and head-to-head comparisons by automotive journalists. It'll have to be capable on a track, even if that's for no other reason then PR.

But believe it or not, there are a lot of people that take their high-performance sports cars and GT's to track days. I'm guessing most people don't, but there are certainly owners who push their cars.

"
"That is something I'm thinking about myself, but I think there is a hint of how that might play out when you look at the model S. Now, the model S is not as sharp as cars like the Panamera or the M5. But that being said, its weight doesn't hurt it *that* much in the corners as far as I can recall. That is the car that was never really designed to be a performance vehicle. There is a possibility that because EV's have all of their weight in the floor, it won't be as hindered as we might normally think. 

Heat dissipation and endurance will definitely be challenges though. Unless Tesla has made some substantial breakthrough in battery cooling that we don't know about or possibly something with battery chemistry‚Ä¶ I don't really see how they're going to get around that basic problem."
"The 720S starts out at around $290,000 at base. If the founding series roadster is about 250K, that's basically in the same ballpark. Outside of some early flippers, ordering from McLaren itself that's roughly where it starts out. I'm trying to understand your last comment, that's entirely up to you. There are a decent handful of supercars you can daily drive if you want, in the case of the 911 Turbo/GT3 or R8 for example they were specifically designed to be used that way. 

 But if we are trying to figure out what this competes with, there is a lot of interpretation there. Are we looking at price or intent? Elon seemed to be calling out of the performance cars himself, saying that it was designed to be a ""hard-core smack down to gasoline cars"". There are a lot of ways you could take that, but he seems to be going after performance cars directly. If that is the challenge that he is issuing, then yeah‚Ä¶"
"There are a few supercars that are already definitely able to be daily drivers. The R8, AMG GT, & 911 are all designed for that, and if you count them as supercars the GTR and GTC4 Lusso would fall under that category too.

But I mean... I look at it this way, like 70% of this car's potential can't be used on public roads. No it isn't strictly necessary for it to be super-fast on a track, but it *should* be given the power it has and Elon calling out gasoline performance cars.

I'm hype for it!"
"Quite a few people. ÔøºIf you're curious, go check out a track day on the weekend near you. Or if you ever get a chance, make it to one of the big-name tracks. You would be surprised, but there are  a lot of people that actually use their sports cars/performance sedans on the track.

Considering that this car's potential performance is going to be highly illegal on just about any road barring the Autobahn, it's really going to have to show its stuff on the track. That's where supercars prove themselves. If this was a hyper GT, that would be a bit of a different story. 

This is absolutely going to be run by websites like motor trend, top gear, and others on the track and have its performance compared to other supercars. Even if a single customer never took it to a track, its track performance will still be important."
"Track performance is crucial if you want to be called a supercar. The balance of the car is part of the experience. Otherwise it would be cheaper to take a used C7 Corvette to lingenfelter, supercharge it, throw drag radials on and clear the ¬º in the same time."
"I can't even make ""I'll sell my house"" jokes because that doesn't even get me 2 reservations"
Unfortunately the 0-60 time is now 2.3 seconds.  Might as well have got a P100D.
Except that would actually be pretty cool.

"I don‚Äôt know about that, all the signature editions never held their value because Tesla kept upgrading newer built cars."
"The concept of saving money is how I lived my life.  When I got my M4 and P85 I didn‚Äôt want to wait.  I usually buy used cars all of my life except for trucks.  I remembered I wanted to buy the MP4 but had enough discipline to hold out.  My friend spent $290,000 on the spyder and I wanted to wait and now it dropped to $135k and I don‚Äôt even want the car anymore.  Wanted something that was easy to drive and looked more modern and the Huracan fit the bill.  Now the roadster is revealed, it is fast beyond this world.  At the same price point of the Huracan, it is a logical step to move on to Tesla.  But looking at Teslas they drop in price.  Currently shopping for an used P90D X and there are 2 on ebay in the $90k which is an insane deal, couple that with the section 179, $67,000.  My brother bought the 90D X new and it was $140,000 out the door.  Unless you are on the list for a hypercar at list price or can get Ferraris at list price, the cars will depreciate.  "
My bad I ment the kesionegg 
I imagine they gave the ballpark of 250+ because they haven't got a working production model yet. It's mostly number crunching right now but will be interesting to see how it performs on release.
"Yeah, I mixed up the Koenigsegg's speed record with km/h but yeah, there's no car rn that will top the acceleration on the roadster 2."
"I agree. I am hopeful though. Tesla has always been a bit conservative with their numbers when it comes to performance. And these numbers are based off of a prototype of a base model. We will see what all of these supercars can do a couple of years from now. 

I‚Äôm also really curious how these cars will compare going around a track"
Nice! Thanks...
Get out of town. 
There is a pretty big difference between a real convertible and a Targa top car. Convertibles are much more open. 
[deleted]
200 for the ‚Äúbase‚Äù
The only way it could achieve 250+mph is if it had a 2 speed transmission like the Rimac Concept One
It's actually surprisingly accurate even for tires. Thin sticky tires would work almost as well but would wear way too quickly... A Bugatti essentially wears through a pair just hitting top speed once.
By sticky I meant bald tyres 
"You're right, meaningless was a poor choice of word. I was just trying to say it's not directly measurable and correct his ""you can calculate torque"" comment. "
That would be nice. Maybe in a few years I can buy the next gen model 3 and not ever have to worry about less range than a gas car - especially with the megachargers the semi is bringing to the table!
"Not a lot of people will drive more than 10 hours at a stretch, but that range also assures we can drive for 3 hours at... less EPA or traffic cop friendly speeds as well.  One thing the published range numbers don't make obvious that owners figure out right away is that cruising at 80 miles per hour with traffic eats up a lot more power than driving as slowly as the EPA's tests.  600 miles EPA means you have I-don't-even-have-to-care many miles of range for your daily commute no matter how heavy your foot."
"No, you don't understand, he's an *American*."
"With the new roadster yes, but not with the S or 3 or X.  I've driven from Seattle to LA and also Seattle to Palm Springs and back several times.  

The problem with the mileage limit is that I have to take a break when the tesla would need a charge and it'll take way longer at each power stop compared to a gas fill up.  Several of these long trips I've made with another driver, so we drive non-stop to save time, only stopping for gas and bathroom, which are 10 minute stops at most.  

That kind of traveling isn't possible with today's tesla.  

The other hand, my commute to work is 22 miles one-way averaging 20mph (shitty traffic both ways).  That would make more sense for a tesla for me, but then we also travel across state to see relatives all the time which is about 140'ish miles one-way.  We could get there, but where do we plug in? At their house with an extension cord?  I suppose that could work, but they might bitch about their electricity cost going up a bit. :)  "
"I live in Croatia in the capital, Zagreb, have a house in the old town on the island Rab, 150 miles away, and i only go there once a year. Ok, there is a ferry that takes 20ish minutes.For us that's a long drive, curvy roads at one stage, almost 3.5 hours. Plus the ferry is around $50 in both directions, plus the toll road plus the almost $6 gasoline, and the average Croatian salary is $1000 after taxes and pension/medical insurance. "
"Crazy how the mindset can change like that. For me anything over 500 gets really awful. Have done 2,200 in a weekend before."
"In my younger days I commuted 140 miles every day.  It was more affordable for me to work in the city and burn hours getting to and from rather than money on closer housing, so I lived far off in an affordable home.  A lot of the US is set up like this - my Tesla was built in some of the most expensive real estate in the USA for example so the people that actually built it probably commute a long distance as well."
"Where I come from in the USA its very flat and empty with little to no traffic. We tend to quote distances in hours. I grew up around it so it seems super normal to say ""Oh that is only an hour away"" or ""They are 5 hours away"" but people look at us weird if they are not local and have to repeat how many MILES away it is."

"25% off on your fourth set of tyres of the day.

- Exclusively at Tesla Megachargers."
"Well, except for the tire changes.  The Bugatti Veyron can go 15 minutes at top speed before the tires fail."
Indeed! :)
Do registration fees scale with the car value?
Active spoiler doesn't generate the 1000lbs of downforce on comparable cars like the Huracan performante or the 720S. My guess is it'll be a straight line car.
"I don't think anyone should expect the roadster to be an endurance racer.  Just the mechanics of current limitations of physics will tell us that a high discharge rate can't be sustained for a long period of time.  Unless there are changes to the construction and chemical makeup of the batteries itself, it will over heat after 1-2 laps.  Once the wires are hot, it will require a while for it to cool down.  What if you don't cool it down?  Maybe the insulators would melt and cause a short?  Or solder failing and coming loose?  

I rarely see anyone in Lambos and Ferraris driving to its potential on the streets, and when you do, it usually end up in a crash and someone dying because it is just too fast.  "
"From an aero point of view, weight is a minus, since it dilutes downforce.
But supercars are typically heavy, so it should not be a huge difference. 
Center of gravity should be very good. Center of inertia probably not so much.
So it should still be quick around the corner given the center of gravity and torque vectoring. Accelerating out the corner should be insane. Breaking, probably average given the weight. 
So I would say it will be in the range of a Bugatti Veyron on a tight track, a bit slower on a fast track."
[deleted]
"True.. but essentially the downforce is pretty much all for sticking in the road during those curves, if you actually don't go fast enough you will slide off the road during the turn because of not enough downforce. It's like a wing of an airplane needing enough airspeed to fly. "
I don‚Äôt think those who can afford it care that much. Insurers know that as well. 
"I don't think there are breakthroughs in battery. I assume they are willing to make the geometry more complex on such an expensive car, so they can stack two high, or go where the frunk\trunk is, up over the axles, and so on."
[removed]
I‚Äôm stumped as too why they are saying 200 kWh.  That would be 800 miles with the larger cross section model 3.  Is it the range at 100 mph?
"Battery heat is not the primary factor holding the model S back, it is the rotor due to the massive induced currents generating a lot of heat in a very difficult to cool area.  I can approach the 186¬∞C thermal limit of the rotor in a few back-to-back launches while everything else is well within thermal limits.

  All the new Tesla products are using Permanent Magnet AC motors which do not have a heating issue on the rotor.  Hence the Semi able to maintain highway speeds up a 5% grade with 80,000 pounds.  I think we will see some reasonable track performance and it is certainly a huge step in the right direction."
There would be less heat overall by just using the entire capacity at a lower relative discharge rate.
[deleted]
"At the Auto Gallery, they priced it at $330,000.  They still have 650S now discounted to $299k.  The 720 I priced out came out to $360k.  Still not too bad compared to the price of the Aventador.  I know that a lot of exotics cars can be driven daily, but not hypercars.  

If I had money beyond my means, I would still not drive a hypercar daily.  It is just too much hassle and quirks to deal with.  I remember years ago playing street ball with a guy with a veyron, he had a flat on one tire and he had to get all 4 tires replaced for safety reasons, his cost? $60,000.  But that did include the dealer bring him a loaner veyron in the same semitruck trailer that picked up his car.

"I don't know the full rules for motorcycles. It does appear some stock motorcycles can do sub 10 second quarter miles.

"> Kesionegg

I can't even"
It's all about that base
"It's got 3 motors, meaning that it could have the equivalent of three speeds."
No it is not accurate. High school physics make lots of assumptions. A car's tyre that is not spinning is interlocked with the road's texture and so forces in addition to just friction are at play.
"Bald tires aren't sticky at all, they're terribly unsafe and not sticky whatsoever.

Did you actually mean racing slicks?  Because totally treadless tires might be illegal if they aren't DOT certified but any tire that isn't is illegal.  DOT racing slicks like [these](https://www.tirerack.com/images/tires/hoosier/ho_dotdr2_pdpfullexpand.jpg) are fine."
"This is common elsewhere in the US too.   Downtown in the city, you still quote going someplace as ""half an hour away"" even though the actual distance is 3 miles."
"Makes sense I suppose, if the traffic is sparse enough that travel times are consistent, thats a more informative measure in a lot of ways! "
And the increased energy consumption.
"And every third time you change the tires, you have to change the entire wheel. Because at that level of 0-60, it starts to peel the tire off the wheel"
They do in Washington state. I just paid 600 for registration.
"Depends on state, my 2013 RAV4 cost ~200 w/ fees here in MN"

"Correct.

On a light sportscar, 1000 lbs of downforce from a spoiler is very significant and gives a lot of grip.

On a super heavy electric sportscar, the same spoiler at the same speeds would still generate 1000 lbs of downforce, but thats tiny in comparison to the mass of the car."
"Downforce is not needed unless you intend on going over 120 mph.  I feel the public is too focused on downforce whereas it is not really needed.  Race cars are light and with a slight positive pressure at over 120 mph, the car can flip.  Top speed and acceleration is sacrificed in the name of downforce.  Unless the car is unstable at high speeds, downforce is not needed.  Since there is no spec on the weight, it is too early to tell.  "
Thanks for posting this. The endurance limitations are what I‚Äôm most curious about too.
"Supercars aren't usually all that heavy. Generally speaking, they tend to be somewhere between 2000 to 3000 pounds. I will grant you that is somewhat heavy if you are comparing them to much older cars that didn't have a lot of the same convenience features or safety equipment‚Ä¶ But, they are still usually a lot lighter than commuter cars tend to be, since they are usually between 3000 to 5000 lbs.

The Veyron isn't a track car, and it's not even particularly fast around a circuit. But, track performance wasn't what it was built for. It is designed to be extremely fast in a straight line while being supremely comfortable. And it's a very heavy car, it's about 4000 pounds which is far heavier than most performance cars. The only modern ones I can think of with that kind of weight would be the Aventador the GTR, or its successor... and maybe some other grand tourers. 

"
"Hm. That helps, but not quite as much as one might expect, because at such insane acceleration basically all weight is on the rear axle. 

At the very least you would need very soft tyre compounts to make them sticky enough."
"Yeah, exactly. At the end of the day this is a machine that can only really have its limits explored on a track, so I want to see how well it stacks up. Especially given Elon explicitly saying the reason this car exists is to give a ""hard-core smack down to gasoline cars.""

I think Tesla might be able to do it, but making something absurdly fast on a circuit is no small thing. A lot of experienced automakers who have been pumping out performance cars for decades still struggle with that.

We'll see! I have some high hopes for them."
"More batteries = more weight, more weight = less range per kWh. Or it has stickier tires. Or it has more downforce. Or probably a combination of several things such as those I mentioned."
"I didn't suggest they wouldn't. People buy supercars all the time, and you obviously can't use their full performance on the road either. 

All I was saying was that track performance is going to be measured and relevant, that's it.

"
"I wonder how much of that is coming from padding added on. Because I'm fairly certain it doesn't start out at that price.

I would imagine there is an entire world of difference between cars at the price point the roadster is occupying, and million dollar vehicle in terms of maintenance. Speaking of the Veyron, they introduced some new maintenance program with the Chiron... but for the life of me I can't recall what it is off the top of my head. But I do remember it is supposed to address the costs of its predecessor. I'm not sure how much cheaper it is, but I do remember it sounding like a good deal.

"
60k? Are the tires made of gold?
"I am not *yet* convinced the Roadster is going to be a track monster. I'm betting on it being more like a baby Chiron, comfortable and unbelievably fast in a straight line but not geared towards a blitzing lap times.

 We shall see though, Tesla has some amazingly talented people working there.

In the case of the GTC4, it is a super car but it's also a family car."
"To be honest dude, it really doesn't matter. It will still have to prove itself on the track. Especially since Elon literally said that the point of the car was to give a hard-core smack down to gasoline cars. And like I said before... even if you were right, magazines/websites will put it to the test.

The man himself is calling out other performance cars. And as much as I love Tesla, they are going to have to prove it if they are really directly going after performance now."

"Yet supercar tech like traction control, DCT, ABS, and modern day aerodynamics all come from supercars.  Here's a better way of putting it. Would you buy a $200k car if you knowingly knew the car would overheat when it's a bit too warm, understeer like mad at Autocross, and get demolished by a ND MX5 with Hoosiers at the track day bro?"
It would be a lot more focused and directed
"Yeah no stock bile will beat that I think, not enough traction."
"Doesn't matter. Someone will say ""they were cheating"" no matter what."
"To me, every dollar counts.  That is because I need to use it as seed money to make more.  I do have enough seed money to reward myself with a car without affecting my life plans, but I have been holding out for years.  I didn't want to buy another car that just sits in the garage where I end up driving it once a week or month.  I remembered before I bought my first Tesla I had 13 cars.  It was a waste as it was too much excess and caused me more stress and problems.  I'm glad to be down to 6 cars and hopefully 4."
What is better with the founders ?

That rule is dumb. Numerous other cars have don't 240+ now with normal aluminum rims.
"I don't see any rear diffuser action in the back like a TVR Griffith or Ford GT where you can literally see the front of the car. I get it, the car will demolish the drag strip, but I will literally PayPal you $100 if this is faster than a Porsche 911 991.2 GT2 RS around the nurburgring without overheating in base for."
No it does not. http://www.koenigsegg.com/apples-oranges-weights-and-measures/
"I don't know if you've had any experience with high performance driving, but you can definitely notice the change in handling with just a GT wing on something like a BMW M4. Driver confidence is what allows for a fun and rewarding experience. If the Roadster can't deliver that, then it's only a one trick pony."
"The thing is that the track cars you mention don't even come close to the roaster acceleration, which is why I was comparing it to the Veyron, which ok s indeed a heavy car. So the reference cars are either lighter but slower or fast but heavy. I'm sure when the roaster climes out it will be more frequently compared to the Bugattis than to the other lighter but slower cars."
"I would guess it has a worse drag coefficient, due to a) having more downforce (i.e. any) and b) being a convertible."
"No, the Veyrons tires are special because they are the highest rated speed available, also the cost must have included the service call and loaner car.  Never seen anything like this, very similar to the McLaren F1 service back then."
"You should probably think about that a little longer. For instance, how you plan to not have this focused stream not be disrupted by the wind from driving. Also consider the energy required to generate that stream vs the energy for a single wipe of a wiper blade. "
"Traction usually isn't the issue. It's wheelying. Most drag bikes have very long swingarms for the rear wheel for this reason - to get the center of gravity as far forward as possible to help prevent wheelies.

Regardless, I don't think there's a *stock* bike that's faster."
You ‚Äúremembered‚Äù you had 13 cars? I mean come on man. You sound ridiculous. 
You feel a sense of accomplishment? /shrug

"Wheel considering the gt2rs just demolished the perfomante sound the track. Which was already so crazy that no one believes Lamborghini, I'd say that's a good guess. 

It seems that none of the smaller companies can do well around a track. I'd expect Tesla to be the same"
Better have that money ready because it has a huge diffuser. You can see it [here](https://youtu.be/lAQGBxtLSWU?t=176).
What‚Äôs the range of those?
[deleted]
Explanation?
"Everyone has different preferences, I am not a fan of Porsche rear engine dynamics because I would prefer the car to give me warning before losing control as I approach the limit.  I prefer oversteering rather than neutral because it is more fun and easier for me to save and predict.  

I think for the money, the best upgrade for the track are tires and suspension.  The difference from a $16,000 JRZ / Moton to a $4,000 kW/Ohlins are night and day.  But I'm old now and don't care much for those things anymore.  Don't want a loud car and don't want to draw too much attention. 

Just got rid of M4 earlier this year and never missed it. It outhandled my Tesla night and day, but I don't drive like that on the streets.  "
"See, it depends on what we mean by fast. If you are specifically referring to acceleration, then there may or may not be anything on the market that is as fast as it assuming it comes out in three years and it isn't delayed. McLaren is working on an all electric supercar, and there is reason to believe that Porsche is as well. Either one of those has a very good chance of matching whatever the roadster's final specs are. Especially if they have three or four years to work on it. Other competitors may pop up as well, in the car world that is a very long time. My guess would be that Rimac & Koenigsegg are strong possibilities. 

 That said, as things stand the Roadster would be nearly unmatched in terms of production performance cars acceleration. I do think it's worth noting that the Valkyrie and Mercedes Project One might be *very* close given that they are very nearly actual F1 cars. Either one of the two hyper cars McLaren has coming in the short-term have a shot as well.

But if we're talking about around a circuit or down a mountain road, that is a whole different measure of speed. Generally speaking, high-performance cars are measured by their times on a track. With the N√ºrnberg ring being the industry standard for decades now. If the Roadster is explicitly closer to being a high-performance GT there is a lot of wiggle room there and it won't matter quite as much. If Elon was really implying that he intends to go after performance biased cars like the R8 V10, Huracan Performante, 911 GT 3, or 720 S... that changes the equation.

It's not entirely clear what their intent with this car is. If it is just meant to be a numbers car much like the Chiron, then you would be right. We shall see!"
"You mean longer than two seconds?  Dude it was an off the cuff remark off the top of my head, not a Doctoral Thesis"
"I have a hording problem which I am taking care of right now.  When I see good deals, I just have an impulse to buy it.  The Model S helped me a lot, I loved the car so much, I was able to get rid of a few cars as it replaced their utility aspect.  No more MB and BMWs for me, I am done with them."
Don't forget the pride
Enough to do a lap of the nurburgring without overheating
"Low weight lol. The Roadster will weigh over 3500lbs. Even a McLaren 720S with all it's carbon is just sub 3000lbs. The NIO EP9 with all it's aero, non overheating batteries, and 4wd can't even break the sub 6 barrier."
Also he said base model. I enjoy the skepticism but you should apply it both ways. 
"2000kg is still 2500kg. Your brakes, tires, and suspension are all affected negatively. You can't defy the laws of physics"
Have you driven the new 911s?  They handle exactly like a midengine car.
"If you only give less than two seconds of thought to anything other than your doctoral thesis, I feel badly for the people who have to interact with you regularly. "
BWHAHAHAHAHA
"Snarky, but accurate.   I'll allow it."
"If we are comparing it to really light sports cars, they range from about 2000 to 2500 pounds. The roadster isn't going to get anywhere near that, you are right.

With that being said, I'm not entirely sure to what degree weight will affect the roadster given all of that is going to be so close to the ground. Of course braking and cornering are the primary concerns here, and I just don't know. I'm also curious to see how they will address generating down force,"
More weight means less down force required. 
"The last 911 I drove was a 997 GT3.  The car felt great, but I wasn't able to do any gauging because it wasn't my car.  I really liked how the Cayman felt, but lacked power.  I'm sure the 991s are near perfect now, but all my priorities in life have changed.  It is more dangerous to take fast corners on the streets so it was not suitable for me, plus my organs would feel some sharp pain when I take a corner, maybe I'm getting too fat.  Which was why I put off buying a Huracan.  It was a well priced exotic car that could break into the 10's and more comfortable than the McLaren 650S and cheaper.  I swear this Roadster hit all the buttons for me.  I can't imagine driving a car that can pull a 8.9 sec on the 1/4 mile.  Never driven a car that fast, only 10.5 secs and I was shitting my pants.  So that settles it.  I don't need a car that can handle, if it can get at least 0.90g on the skidpad it is more than enough for me."
Boo hoo
Weight affects everything. http://www.koenigsegg.com/apples-oranges-weights-and-measures/
"More weight also means diminishing returns and a bad power to weight ratio. You're now putting increased stress on your tires with none of the aero advantages you would get. A high weight also means decreased agility, which is crucial for a supercar. It's easier to corner a 1000kg aero based car(AMG Project One) than it is to corner a 2000kg car(Bugatti Chiron).  Here's something to read about. http://www.koenigsegg.com/apples-oranges-weights-and-measures/
Something else I should mention. The Rimac Concept One S weighs 1900kgs. This roadster will weigh more than that considering it doesn't seem to have a carbon fiber chassis and 200kwh of batteries"
Dodge Demon pulls more than .9g on skidpad. Doesn't mean it handles well at all.
"I am aware that weight everything. What I'm saying is, given how it is distributed I'm not sure to what degree it will. "
"Lots of positive comparisons to the BMW 3 and Mercedes C, which is exactly what Tesla's going for. It doesn't blow either competitor out of the water, but it's competitive in its price class and has the Tesla cool factor and tech. 

After all, the BMW 3 series doesn't have much available driver assistance tech at all, so even if you want it, it's not available. I'm not sure about the Mercedes C, but I also don't know how good Mercedes' ADAS system is right now. I've seen so many mixed reviews, you gotta be sure you're reading a review of the 2017 iteration.

I'm really hoping the S and X get a 3-style interface fairly soon. That looks very polished."
"I am amazed /u/doug-demuro managed to get his hand on a Model 3 this early, but I am happy he did! It is good to see an unbiased review! "
20 minutes of features and quirks before even driving!  I loved it.  
"Never thought about it this way but I love that, if you have a Model 3, you can call your car keys if you lose them."
"OK, I had my doubts about the center screen functionality before I saw this video, and I have to say this completely erased whatever concerns I had. That is just fucking cool. I already knew the trackball things were contextually aware, but they work a lot better than I feared they would. And that aside, is it my imagination or is the screen working far better than we've seen in some other videos on this sub? I swear there was one that just showed it to be a glitchy crashing mess.

I think Tesla still has some room for improvement in some areas, and I personally believe going with a sporty suspension over something a bit softer is kinda questionable... but I'm really damn impressed!

That aside, as always thanks u/Doug-DeMuro for doing such a great job explaining everything!"

He's my most favorite car reviewer! Was waiting for this so badly!
but does it have BUMPER TO BUMPER ~~insurance~~ warranty?
"I love watching Doug's videos!  I was secretly hoping Tesla met their delivery est for me (OCT-DEC 2017) so I can have him do a review of mine, but it looks like someone beat me to it! "
"Loved the video, as a major fanboy even I learned something - didn't know about the weird shaped widows peak windshield.   I will refrain from posting the couple of tiny inaccuracies I heard ;) Great job."
The comments on YouTube are the most petrolheaded I ever read...
"Well, this review answered the driving dynamics question a lot of us had. Seems to be a great car in that respect but not as sporty as a 340 or other real sports sedans.

Sounds great for daily commute, actually sounds like it‚Äôs tuned inline with a Model S."
"This video is so difficult for me. I've got a day one reservation but I'm also in the UK so that means 2019, so I've recently been looking at other other EV options... 

But now that I've seen this then I just CAN'T. Nothing else is remotely this good, it just sucks that I don't get it for another year and a half or more."
"If you want some entertainment, over in r/cars they're having conniptions that he didn't hate it."
Man no wonder Jalopnik doesn't like having Demuro write for them anymore. Ryan Felton might as well be a Koch-shill with the amount of anti-Tesla stuff he writes.
I don‚Äôt like that anyone can see the dead bodies in the trunk now. 
"I love that this guy can get through more than one sentence without cutting. So many YouTube personalities can barely get through one without cutting, if that. "
"At 11:18 we learn that if you use the emergency handle too often it can damage the window trim. Do you guys have info on that ? How could it damage the window trim ? Is that an issue we should be consered about ? And, am I the only one who thinks that it's quite frightening to not have any mechanical emergency door handles in the back ? What if you had an accident and had to get out ? You have to crawl through the front, even if the car is damaged or rolled over ?"
Excellent review! Thanks for posting. He did a great job promoting all the advantages of the Model 3!
"According to my delivery estimate, mine will be the coolest car of 2018."
Just look at how responsive the map is with pinch and zoom.  Jealous S owner here
"""This is the Tesla... ""

""Model 3, and it is the coolest car...""

"Damn, I like Doug and all, but ....... TAKE A BREATH DUDE! I feel like you're trying to sell me MicroMachines.

Otherwise, really enjoyed the video. There are some tidbits I hadn't seen anywhere else before. For example:

* When using emergency front door release, a message displays on the screen

* When trunk is open, charge port will not open

* Backup camera shows exact distance until you hit the object behind you

Thanks Doug."
Ok now I regret canceling my reservation I made day 1. :(
"Any more details on the audio itself. Does it sound good compared to rivals? Does Spotify work? Does Bluetooth primary pair to profiles...

Inquiring minds. However at 6'5"" this just answered my biggest question about whether to keep our cancel the rez.  Guess I'm going 3 instead of S"

"I love your shirt, /u/Doug-DeMuro. My uncle actually built that dealership, along with Porsche, Audi, Mercedes, and the Subaru North America HQ. He passed away earlier this year, and it was a great loss to me and, I'm sure, that dealership group as well. It made me smile to see a little reminder of him. "
"I started very VERY critical of the screen but I'm starting to come around little by little. 

The audio and climate controls while driving are absolute garbage town, but still when you think about it they shouldn't really be controlled very much while you are driving anyway. So I'm starting to think the super ergo focused design of some cars for these as more functions are added isn't necessarily that good. 

"
Love Doug's videos. Watch every week. The only concern I got from this was about that phone dock lid magnet being a future issue down the line possibly. Everything else looks great.
Not a bad review. I always appreciate Doug's videos. They are pretty thorough and (generally) informative. This subreddit & some of those Tesla forums really do have die-hard fanboys that make it annoying when browsing content. Hard to get good opinions sometimes.
Can‚Äôt wait to get mine in December 
Something about this video makes me super excited.
I have a new reason to go to work in the morning.
Can you really call the Model 3 a car of 2017?
"Uhh, guys. This was posted four hours ago and has 155+ comments, and I'm the first to notice [""AUTO LANE CHANGE""](https://i.imgur.com/MiK3L0b.png) on the Autopilot screen???! 

I am disappoint.

edit: nvm. Nothing to see here. "
Coolest car of 2019
"u/Doug-DeMuro thanks for this, very well done and it helped clear some things up for me. Now I'm even more excited for mine to roll off the assembly line."
Everytime I see demuros videos I think everyone In the US is driving those fancy cars
best car reviewer reviewing the best car currently.
"This is so awesome, wife and I are very interested to get one when they're available here. "
As a driver from Maryland.... Everyone here needs a Tesla. 
I hope Jeremy Clarkson gets his hands on a Model 3 for review. He isn't mainstream and he's very unbiased and fair. I'm sure he'd love this car. üòâ
"I might have just missed it in other videos, but this is actually the first time I've actually seen the air vent system properly explained, really cool! :) "
What in the world were they thinking with no manual door releases in the rear? If I was a parent that would be a major turn off safety wise in the event of a crash. 
"So the door buttons inside are electronic, but are the handles outside electronic too when you pull them?

So if the battery died I could use the manual release on the front doors to get out then open the back doors from the outside?"
"Wait, WTF the back windows only go like halfway down?

Some things on the Model 3 are like Tesla only got half the parts they needed, like the back window halfway down, the back doors not having manual releases, etc..."
"IMO it's a great car, i wonder when Benz or Lexus launches their pure electric car will they be better than model 3 at this price range or not?
As it might be 1-2 more years for a person to buy model 3 without reservation do you think the Benz or lexus will launch cars as good as this? if not better
The main problem now is battery availability and this is going to solve a little as benz, lg, samsung, toshiba etc are building large battery plants in 1-2 years. So i think a huge competition is going to come. i wonder how tesla will be better than all of them."
"I live the model S and the model X. The model 3 is a no-go for me because of the scant interior, but I get why it‚Äôs loved, and deservingly so."
"I just wish it had an hud or something tied into the system. That way you don't have to take your eyes off the road whenever you want to check your speed or turn signals, or even just to adjust climate settings or something."
"Does anyone know of a mirror? In China at the moment and YouTube, along with other google sites, are blocked."
"That was a fine review. Doug made an effort to be objective and did highlight the things that he found disappointing but the look of delight and excitement in his face said volumes about how much he liked it. That and the score ;)

For those of us who reserved lots more than a year ago, and live in the southern hemisphere & drive on the left, we know it will be a test of patience, but it's heartening to see that it will be worth it. I guess our's will come with FM Radio firmware included :D"
"Great review. Watched it on my lunch hour. 

The only thing I‚Äôm waiting for in a Model 3 review at this point is a trip to Costco with kids. Show me how to put a few hundred dollars of food and stuff into that car with kids in the back seat. "
Does he mention his Nissan Skyline GTR? 
/r/cars on suicide watch
"ok, i was holding out for the S, but this looks pretty great too.."
Very interesting. Although he lost me after he called a Miata a sports car.
Awesome video. I cracked up at the Maryland driver reference lol
Anyone else feel like this guy is the nephew of Jay Leno? Face and voice (but not chin). 
Definitely the best car money can't buy in 2017 ;)

"/u/Doug-DeMuro you might want to give a photosensitive epilepsy warning for the video around 26:00, there is some significant flickering being caused by the sunlight that could really affect some people badly. 

Great video though, most comprehensive one i've seen to date on the model 3 and answered a ton of the questions I had, thanks!!"

"Not even the Ford Fiesta I picked up for $7k has door panel gap/misalignment that bad.

"I was surprised to see a 5 on the acceleration score.  Come on Doug, this thing will stomp on a BMW or Audi all day long."
But maybe it‚Äòs the most overrated car of 2017.
"U/Doug-DeMuro 
Just wanted to take a quick second to say I love your videos, the presentation, content, your humour and... Of course... The Doug score haha. You should do a budget film though, take a few cars under ¬£1000 or over 100,000 miles. Why? Because they'll be full of QUIRKS!! 

Sleep on it, call me in the morning, my people will be ready. "
"So, uh, do the wipers really just have two settings, slow and fast??"
"I've got an old E90 with RWD, heavy hydraulic steering, and sport suspension. I will be so sad if this is a downgrade in terms of handling and steering feel. Perhaps the immediate torque availability will make up for it. How was the driving position and seat hugging ability? What about body roll?"
"One thing I can't stand about the Model 3 are the handles. Why are they not electronic? They put electronic gears on the flipping steering wheel adjustment but not the handles. I set the steering wheel once and never touch it again, yet the handles I obviously use daily. It seems ridiculous."
This car is incredibly underpriced

Yeah! Spent six hours going over *everything* -- I'm sure I've missed some details and made a few mistakes but hopefully people appreciate the Model 3 from the perspective of a ""regular"" car enthusiast. "
Model 3‚Äôs central controller is much smoother than the ones in Model S and Model X. 
"I have to say I'm still quite skeptical about Tesla's choice to move almost all functionality to the center screen. I'm concerned that replacing all the traditional physical knobs, dials and buttons that normal cars have with virtual controls on the center screen makes things less user friendly.

In a normal car, operating things like stereo volume, headlights, radio channels, A/C have dedicated controls in a fixed location. To change something, all it takes is one press of a button. In the Tesla, however, most of these things require at least two, sometimes more, presses on the screen. Moreover, since the screen is digital there is no tactile feedback and you can't really operate the screen without looking.

I'm concerned that using the screen to control *everything* can be a bit too finnicky at times. The virtualization of all these buttons adds an extra abstraction layer that people have to work with. I'm concerned people are going to be staring at their center screen for too long instead of paying attention to the road."
Now if only they could align the chrome trim......
"I was in a test drive in a Model S two years ago.  Right when the salesman was demonstrating how the AC works, the entire screen froze.  It was funny, but I'm assuming they fixed the glitch.  "

"Yeah, and while we're all waiting I've been eyeing some possible competitors:

* Jaguar I-Pace (late 2018, bragging about 0.29 drag, wtf?, ~4 sec 0-60, 95 kWh, ~220 miles? really?)
* Audi E-Tron Quattro (2018?, 0.25 drag, solar roof, torque vectoring, 4.6 sec 0-60, 95 kWh, ~310 miles)
* Audi E-Tron Sportback (2019?, looks like a smaller/faster/sporty Quattro)

PS: I'm also in the 2019 boat, but mostly because I want the AWD Performance Model 3 (or as some call it, the Model P3D)"
Same here - have come really close to getting an ioniq a few times.
Bolt?
">But now that I've seen this then I just CAN'T. Nothing else is remotely this good, it just sucks that I don't get it for another year and a half or more.

Couldn't help but notice the LTE data connection. Is that on the X and S in the US already? 
Glad I wasn't the only one who saw that right away! I like that Doug addressed it in the video. 
"> Damn, I like Doug and all, but ....... TAKE A BREATH DUDE! I feel like you're trying to sell me MicroMachines.

I know, I know, but actually I wish I had talked faster. 32 minutes! I was about to go on a cutting mission to get it under 30 and I decided, ah hell, screw it. "
"I interpreted the bit about the charge port as you can‚Äôt open it from the center console when trunk as open, but can via other means.

We‚Äôll see which is actually the case... "
Hehe there's a part when he's in the car a bunch of spit comes out of his mouth. 
Haven‚Äôt watched this video yet but in another model 3 hands on video they were able to open the charge port with trunk open. 
"Hah, that's awesome! It must've been ages ago -- LR Cherry Hill has been there *forever*, since the original days of ""Range Rover North America."" "

"The car feels like it was build for full autopilot, in a way. 

That touchscreen would be perfect if you had nothing else to do on the road when looking at it and operating it.

As we are not there yet, its suboptimal, imho. "
I predict that will never be closed when I'm in the car. 
üò¨
Yes
What's so exciting about it?
"Oh, and the rear windows roll down only enough so you can't escape through it. Honestly, that's the most dissatisfied design this car has.. Y????"
My Audi is the same
That's pretty normal. The wheel arch probably blocks the window from going all the way down. 
"FYI, most cars back windows don‚Äôt go all the way down. Try it in your own car"
[deleted]
"It's a safety compliance thing. There needs to be a minimum height from the floor/seat to the top of an open back seat window to prevent children from climbing out. Due to the battery in the floor of a Tesla, the floor is higher than other cars that size and hence the minimum height on the window. The S has this too for the same reason. "
I know. That was a huge downside. Luckily I won't be back there but still is dumb.
I just want an EV I can get sub-20k :(
"I think a lot of it genuinely hinges on where they start. It seems like the larger makers want to slap a battery in a pre-existing vehicle and make some modifications. 

It's my opinion that the car needs to be designed from the ground up to be an EV. Any maker *could* make a fantastic EV, it really just depends if they want to bother. "
"It could be but it's important to look at the history.

Merc could pull something amazing, along with Audi (VW) or Bimmer as they all seem quite interested. My money's on Audi with VW's drastic change in philosophy.

Honda could try something but their supply lines are unknown.

Toyota and Ford seem quite unlikely. The former mostly since their electronics main partner is already at full capacity with Tesla and they seem to be developing Solid State batteries which need more time."
It would be perfect with a HUD
Get a VPN
Lol you know the highest score Doug has ever given out is like a 73 right?
In the trunk?
"Sell the kids, plenty of room after that. "
"Yes, he definitely looks like Jay Leno"
"> And I think the RFID card solution is equally bad...having to carry that thing around as a backup all the time is just not convenient at all.

Do you also think car keys are a bad idea?  It's the same thing, just a slightly different form factor.

> The vent in the trunk is horrid. Ride noise and noise from stuff in the trunk rattling will make it's way into the cabin and bounce off the rear glass right at the passengers.

This is what we call *an assumption*.  It's a very small vent at the top of the trunk, a very long way away from the driver of the car.  I really doubt anyone hears anything from it.

> The climate control vents. Ugh. So bad.

Maybe wait to actually use them first?  I think I would like them as the manual adjusters always seem very sensitive to me.

> The lack of a gauge cluster...nothing new here but nothing in this video has convinced me that it would be any better than what I am already expecting

Once again, maybe wait to use the vehicle first?  There are several cars running around with center speedometers and owners report it becomes second nature after just a couple days of driving with them."
"Having to carry an RFID card around is not convenient but a set of keys are?

I see you have concerns. I would suggest reserving final judgement for when you actually can go see a car in the store. I think a lot of the stuff regarding air vents and center screen will not be nearly as bad as you think. "
[deleted]
"I had the opposite reaction, the car is what I wanted, every video I see confirms that...

But different people want/like different things, when I buy a new car I keep it for 10 years .... if you are similar you need to make the right decision.... and that isn't a Model 3."
what you mean... RFID card is harder to carry around than a key??? really??

Nope lol. He says he wears 2 t-shirts because he is really sweaty and doesn't want the stains to show. 
The white T-shirt under his green T-shirt?
[This is me](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/kerning.png) basically ever since I learned about panel gaps being a thing on this subreddit.  I notice it on vehicles everywhere now.
this takes some serious skill and it is something other manufacturers have developed over many many many years
"His acceleration scores are based on an predefined scale he set, so the numbers may seem arbitrary, but they're all fair when compared to the other cars he's scored. Since he does mostly sports cars, anything in the 5 second range is pretty middle-of-the-road performance, so it makes sense that it falls right around the middle of his scale.

> this thing will stomp on a BMW or Audi all day long.

Not really, if you look at the official manufacturer's numbers:

___ 

Model 3 Standard: 5.5 sec

BMW 330i: 5.5 sec

Audi A4: 5.7 sec

___

Model 3 LR - 5.1 sec

BMW 340i - 4.8 sec

Audi S4 - 4.4 sec

And I'm not sure about Audi, but BMW pretty much always underrates their cars with their official numbers, so they're no doubt faster than what's listed above. 

I'm a first day res holder, and really excited to get my Model 3, but it's not an especially quick car, like the Model S/X are. I'm sure the Performance version will be much more impressive, but for now, I'm actually sacrificing a decent amount of acceleration going from my current ICE car to the Model 3. And I'm okay with that."
Not really. It's right in line with a 340i. 
There are actually four settings. Slow/fast with intermittent turned on or off for each. 
"As for body roll, I expect that this will match the Model S and X.  Teslas have an extremely low center of gravity, as the battery pack is super low, lining the bottom of the vehicle.  "
bmws have all been downgradings in terms of handling since the E30. You are trading safety for a more direct road feel...
I don‚Äôt agree at all. I think it‚Äôs about right or possibly a bit over priced. The materials and interior are all quite a bit lower than similar cost cars.

">The Mercedes system is still pretty level 1-2ish, I have a feeling they are skipping level 3 and aiming for level 4 next.

What remains to be seen is if  they will offer it in the lower level cars. Right now, the heavy ADAS systems are in the Cadillac CTS, but only the max-spec $80k version, and the Audi A8. I haven't checked Volvo, yet, but right now the Model 3 might be the cheapest way to get an ADAS system in 2018.

I just hope the new 3 gets sportier. They've been neutering it the last couple of generations and making you buy way up into the M3 to get back to it. I think some of it is the 4-series cannibalizing sales. I absolutely love the 4-series proportions and would pay the extra to make that leap."
"Let me rephrase it slightly - I am amazed that Doug has a viewer who has a Model 3 already, and was willing/allowed to give him their car! "
He did say he uses cars provided by fans but I noticed that the display at 16 minutes says ‚ÄúDoug‚Äôs model 3.‚Äù Either that fan‚Äôs name is Doug or he actually got himself a model 3..
"We haven‚Äôt preordered any yet (it makes no sense for the company to have cash tied up when we are least 18 months from seeing them in the UK!) 

We are thinking between 3 and 10 is a good number though (probably 10.)

Edit: Also it‚Äôs 7, not 9 (although technically we have a P100DL X and a P100DL S as well in the fleet, they just aren‚Äôt owned by us directly.)"
That's his style with all reviews. Well worth subscribing.
[deleted]
"Dude. Thank you.

I literally couldn't care less about cars before I found your ""Here's why the Model X is an awful car"" video. Now I've watched all your videos (one of a million!) and I freaked out when I saw a Bentayga leaving the gas station.

Your videos are the best. Never stop doing what you do. The quirks are what give a car personality, and I'm thrilled you focus on them so much.

Doug's the kind of guy to get me interested in cars."
"Big fan, you helped me choose my new car."
"Being on the side that has obsessed over most details, your video was a perfect overview, and I really have nothing but compliments of this and your other videos.  Similar to some others in the thread, I've watched many of your other fun reviews and value what you say, especially with the Model X initial review.

Being 6'4"" myself, this sold me on the Model 3, as if it wasn't already ;).  I have a tall son and knowing definitively that we will both be able to fit in the front and back seats is something that I tested and couldn't do in any of the Model S configurations (back seat in particular).  The size, configuration, and price all make this a perfect option for our family.

Thanks for getting this out so quickly, albeit very unexpected from my perspective.  I'd love to see a follow-up with one of the later VINs to see how it has changed/improved and whether there is a notable difference in ride, etc. with the 18"" wheels."
"Thanks for doing this Doug.  Huge service to those of us considering the car, and just to car enthusiasts in general."
"Hey. I've been watching your videos for a while, it's cool to see you on Reddit. Never thought you'd be here. 

I absolutely love the quirks and features segments  For driving and handling, especially of high end cars, you get loads of reviews everywhere, and they mean nothing to me. 

But the weirdness and features that are available is really interesting and let's you see what you get in these cars, and an insight into car designers' heads that tell you something about the car as a whole. 

Thanks so much!"
"Hey Doug,

Big fan of yours (I‚Äôve probably watched half of your videos which I consider pretty solid considering you have 200+ now?). I‚Äôm really curious about the cars handling.   

How heavy does it feel compared to a BMW 3 series, especially on on-ramps and around corners? I‚Äôm assuming the large battery pack keeps the car planted but also makes the tires loose some grip? You made it sound in the review as if this was actually a non issue except under acceleration?   
Assuming you didn‚Äôt care about the drive trains uniqueness would you feel the car as reviewed holds its own against a BMW / c class at $44k (kind of the minimum as reviewed)?"
"I knew a lot already about Model 3, and this was still great to watch. In my book, you are the Tesla Model 3 of car reviewers. "
"This is what makes your videos great! You spend time actually going over features and you compile it into a funny yet informative video, which makes it so great."
"Question maybe you could answer:  The screen in the model 3 is primarily white.  At night, or when you put the lights on, does it flip into a 'night mode', where it's mostly black/dark grey?

I'm not sure I'd want a giant white ipad screen blaring in my interior at night."
"Hey Doug, can you clarify: the video clearly says you can‚Äôt open both trunk and charge port from the screen, but does this mean that you can‚Äôt access the trunk when you‚Äôre charging at all??"
"Doug, I have watched a ton of your videos.  What I really like about your reviews are the quirks of the cars that most of us will never drive.  My dream car when I was a kid was a Lambo Countach, you shattered my dreams when you went over how clunky and goofy that car is! LOL."
"Thanks for the great review Doug, I love your style! It reminds me of every time I go on a trip and have to drive some shitty rental car with crappy features, bad handling and poor acceleration which always makes me miss my model S.

One thing you didn't really touch on is charging and the fact that Tesla has a nationwide network of 120kW Superchargers which helps to reduce the worries about range and road trip worthiness. If you navigate a long trip the car will tell you where to stop and charge and for how long and provide you with an accurate estimate of your remaining range at the destination.

[In fact someone recently drove a Model 3 from CA to NY in 51 hours, 17 minutes.](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-cross-country-cannonball-run-ca-ny/) 

Other EVs are limited to haphazardly located Chademo or CCS chargers which can only provide 50kW."
Was looking forward to seeing it very much and didn't expect it to come so soon! Thanks!
theres tesla logos on the wheels as well on the outside. 
"Whatever you missed for not being a fan-boy... you still found things I didn't know..    like that crazy asymetrical windsheild.  

Thanks for your fun videos.. my favorite kind of Car review and i love the doug-score for its categorization and broad inclusiveness."
"Yours was the review I was waiting for.  I almost don't want to watch it because then there will be no milestones left before I can actually buy it! Just a long, long wait..."
Only thing I (also not an uber-follower of Tesla) noticed was that I believe you can turn the dome/reading lights on or off by pushing them.  You don't have to use the center screen.
Nicely done Doug!
"Sorry if you said it somewhere else but now that you have had your hands on a model 3 how does it compare to the bolt?

I have been really excited for a 3 and I actually started considering a bolt but I have really mixed feelings about it. "
Genuinely glad you were able to be the first with a proper video on this car. Congrats on 1m subs and keep it up! 
"How about for the Model S's old interface, not the new 'Apple' one?"
"Oh I agree that I prefer having certain things be physical nobs, I just mean that screen works a lot better than I feared. It'd be something I could live with. But yes, I agree that it'll make it more difficult for a person unfamiliar with Tesla's to switch over. "
"One thing that seems like a total no-brainer is allocating those knobs on the wheels to volume control when driving.  Totally baffling to have them only perform essentially pre-driving functions.  

Additionally the skin-tight integration with the driver's phone for certain functionality just begs the question why we can't have Android Auto/Apple Carplay for media, but I think we all know why that won't happen."
The user experience suffers but it's cheaper and should be more reliable.
"Fully agree. 
Using less parts is helps with reducing the costs on mass production.
I don't know how I can do without light switches. Will keep my reservation though, since no competitor is in sight."
[deleted]
"That's one of those things Tesla needs to improve. Fit & finish. As well as, IMHO, interior aesthetics & to a certain extent materials."
LET ME TELL YOU HOW SEQUENTIAL TURBOS WORK
"sorry I made you dig for that, I actually know what the warranty is, my comment was irrelevant 

thanks anyway though!"
I've not gotten much sleep today
"I feel like all those competitors are going to be much more expensive than the Model 3, probably closer to Model S range when they've got a few options (and at that point just get the Model S today and don't wait around?) - Jaguar and Audi really overcharge for the brand name.

(They also don't have superchargers, if that's a thing that matters to you.)

Things I'm personally considering/waiting for are things like:

- Renault Zoe refresh - it already has good range (200ish) but is just too uncomfortable to sit in and has NO tech features at all.. it barely even has bluetooth.. but a model with more tech and better seats is apparently on the way.

- Hyundai Ioniq with a larger battery. That car is so efficient that it can already pull 170 miles from only a 24kwh battery. Sources say the next version of the car is going to get a 40kwh battery so uh.. DAM YEZ.

- Longer range Leaf... whenever that actually appears.

- Longer range E-Golf or Focus Electric (neither confirmed but both are likely)

All of those are much more likely to be closer to the ¬£30k range - some of them will probably work out cheaper!"
"The Ioniq is an almost great car. It'll be a great car when it gets a larger battery.

It already has a LOT of tech for the price, and is very innovative in several areas. The 'gear selector' is very cool, feels like a spaceship instead of a car."
"Nope, Not in the UK. GM has only delivered [a few Opel Bolts to Norway and has stopped taking orders.](https://electrek.co/2017/10/20/chevy-bolt-ev-opel-norwegian-dealers-stop-taking-orders/) "
Expected to launch in the UK in 2019. Same deal with the new long range Leaf I think. Right hand drive sucks haha. Small distances and a mature rapid charge network mean the UK is pretty good for EVs otherwise though!
"I mean sure, time will tell, and I'll definitely be considering my options when Tesla decide they want to sell this car in the UK.

What I mean is that none of the other EV options RIGHT NOW seem remotely worth it compared to waiting for the 3 (or other 2019 car) - which is a shame because I'd like to get out of my ICE as soon as I possibly can."
None of those cars exist yet 
Tesla hate comments there usually spring from anti-campaigns where traditional articles on /r/news or /r/tech (or here) or something refuse to accept any dissenting opinions against the Musk machine. It's like how Reddit inherently stimulates radical thought on T_D but on a much much much lower scale. It can't really be helped until the hype dies down.

Definitely. It seems mostly led by Ryan Felton. It‚Äôs to the point where I think he might have a short position. 
oh wow... that is a terrible design then. A safe mechanical door opening is a 101. They couldn't design it in a way that doesn't damage the actual window ??
Yes has been for a while
"Maybe the video was a bit long, but since it was well paced and to-the-point as usual it easily retained my attention. But I admit, 32 minutes isn't really the kind of 'bite size' thing you watch on your smoke break or whatever. Personally though, I don't mind the long videos."
"It's better to say a bit less and talk a bit slower in my opinion, but if there's a lot to say you just have to make a long video. If it's pleasant to listen to and informative, it won't *feel* long."
"I opened the video and saw it was 32 minutes long and thought, dang that's a long video. I'll watch the first couple minutes and see what he has to say. 32 minutes later and the video ended. Fantastic review! Thanks Doug!"
"One idea is to make two versions - the standard 32 min one, and a short 10 minute one for more 'casual' viewers.

I have one request - any chance we can see the full uncut footage? Even if it's an hour, I'd love to see it!"
"Ah, could be. But what would the benefit be for not being able to open the charge port from the screen, but being able to open it otherwise?"
The problem being the TM3 has no dedicated audio/climate wheel control. You have to initiate it on screen. Which is stupid.
I don't plan to use it so mine will probably never be open. 
I know wish I can‚Äôt get to build it already and get a delivery day 
Nevermind. I was thinking it was the automated lane changing long promised by Enhanced Autopilot. It‚Äôs probably just the turn-signal activated lane change that AP1 has always had. 
Mine definitely goes further down. Probably a good 4-6 inches more. 
"The back windows not going down more than halfway is normal?

Many back windows don't go **all** the way down, but most go down much more than the Model 3 shows."
"Agreed, not all the way, but most seemingly go down a lot more than the Model 3"
"> If a company can come up with a way to eliminate that terrible buffeting sound when you have the windows down, that'd be amazing.


This is going to be an issue when manufacturers can do away with side view mirrors as it's the sculpting of those mirrors that prevent buffeting from happening with the front windows."
"> I don't ride back there, kinda don't give a shit.
> 

Precisely my feeling on anything in the rear seats. I don't care if they're uncomfortable, I don't care if they're heated, I don't care if the seatbelt is weird, etc. I'm never, ever riding back there in all likelihood, so why would I give a damn about any of that? 

(obviously some people are just nicer / more caring, but I don't have kids and I'm not a taxi so on the rare occasions I carry rear passengers if they find the experience lacking, they can drive their own car)"
"Yeah it isn't really a big deal, but it's such a simple thing that it doesn't really make sense to not do it.

There aren't many scenarios where I would need it to roll all the way down, but IDK it's possible.

Though with the room, it might just make more sense to fold down the seats."
"""Huge?"" Really? Come on now."
"I believe the next two ""tesla competitors"" due out are the Jaguar i-pace and the Audi e-tron.  Both clean sheet designs.  But since they're both crossovers I wouldn't say direct competitors to Model 3 and they'll likely both be quite a bit more expensive.  "
"I think most classic car manufacturers will wait for the next model generations, which then will be designed with both EV and petrol variants in mind. Right now, yes, they all try to fit batteries inside petrol only cars, or into cars which were designed for short range EV variants. But for the next model generations, they will design the chassis with more space for battery packs, which will allow longer range EV models. A 300 mile e-Golf (current model has ca. 190 miles range) would convert a lot of ""normal"" people. "
The point was to say is the trunk and front trunk big enough to haul a normal Costco run home. 
[deleted]
So you can jump up the queue
Yeshh
"Tesla may be low-balling their acceleration numbers, just like they have done with the Model S.  We'll just have to wait to find out."
"Thank you for putting the 330i in for the comparison instead of the 320i!  Everyone that  tries to do  comparisons always tries to put the Model 3 against the 320i but the 330i is more of the competitor to the Tesla SR 3 in price and performance and the LR seems to be more in line with the S4/340i. The Model 3 looks amazing, but it doesn't blow away it's competition in straight  performance.  I am very excited to get the LR 3 soon in the family, but I love BMWs and my 435i is still going to be my primary car. "
"That's kind of lame. I don't think I've ever had a car without a bunch of intermittent settings (like, the first level allows for up to 6 levels of intermittent, then two additional faster levels). "
"I have lots of seat time in an old S85 and was generally happy with the balance of the car. I hate those old seats though. Tried a newer 90D and the seats were great. Steering feel is a bit too artificial but what do you expect.....I was pretty pissed off that the traction control couldn't be turned off fully. What the hell?

I forgot to ask, how was the premium audio system? That's a dealbreaker feature if they didn't get it right. The the older Model S upgraded audio system was decent but nothing special, especially for the high cost."
"Are you sure about that? Because I am 100.0% sure that PM_ME_POTATO_PICS is not a bot.

And the tires wearing down.
"But afaik the competition only gets up to 30 seconds of handsfree driving, while Tesla allows longer intervals.

Not only that, but I hear that Mercedes seems to have the second best system, and it isn't as accurate as Tesla's.

But things are moving, and I feel they are not moving as fast at Tesla at the moment. Only advantage Tesla has is that they can outfit their fleet of AP2 cars with newer software OTA, while you get what you buy on the moment you bought the car at the competition."

"> I just hope the new 3 gets sportier. They've been neutering it the last couple of generations and making you buy way up into the M3 to get back to it.

You tell me lol. The F30 was a huge disappointment as far as driving dynamics goes, especially compared to my old E92. It was still better than competitors but I had to get a M3 to get back into a bit of that old BMW magic.

I think it's just unfortunately the state of the auto market. People love these boring driving soft and light luxury cars and many people buy BMWs just for a badge, and they actually complain about firm suspension and heavier steering.

I blame everything on Toyota/Lexus lol."

I'm not surprised. Many Tesla aficionados are techy people. Techy people frequent Youtube.
He had people give him cars and order of magnitude more expensive...

"To be fair this is what people hated about the OCD videos. (Or I should say if they disliked them, that's why.)

I think a six-foot-four person behind a second six-foot-four person would be tight, but it's doable -- more than in other cars that are 185 inches long. The packaging is pretty impressive. One trade off is you lose rear trunk space, but the front trunk obviously makes up for it.

Thanks for the kind words! I can't believe I got it out so quickly myself..."
Thank *you*! I appreciate that. I have so much fun finding (and filming) all the weird quirks. 
"I was surprised how well it handled, but I have to admit that I didn't drive it on any crazy curves or back roads -- I had to film this, then edit, then get it up all in one 24 hour span, and getting all the quirks/features was a bit more important.

The handling is good but the car has some heft, however body roll is pretty controlled. The steering is oddly responsive. I wasn't able to get the tires loose in any situation, even going fairly fast around corners. 

I do think the car holds its own against MB and BMW, *except* I think it's short on handling and short on that substantial feel those cars have; the Model 3 has a bit more road noise and you feel the road a bit more. With that said, I haven't driven a new C-Class or 3 Series in *ages*, and tire sizes have increased a lot since then; I find the ride quality in my own personal Mercedes to be more punishing than the Tesla. 

That was sort of stream of consciousness, but I hope it helps!"
"> Question maybe you could answer: The screen in the model 3 is primarily white. At night, or when you put the lights on, does it flip into a 'night mode', where it's mostly black/dark grey?

Yup! It's automatic, or you can do it manually."
"That's a good question, and I should've tried it. I honestly don't know, and I should've checked. Someone who gets a really early one will have to chime in."
Me too.lol.
Oh yeah the screen seems to be working nicely. I guess time will tell if the virtual controls are adequate in the real world.
"This is a valid concern when driving. However, I got pretty good at changing the settings on the Model S without looking."
Interior aesthetics for the S/X is passable but 3 is straight embarassing.
"> (and at that point just get the Model S today and don't wait around?) 

Damn it, you read my mind. I was kind of hoping for a slightly smaller car though. But I guess waiting an extra year and a half isn't worth it.

Edit: too expensive! Decided to play it safe and get the First Production Model 3 with the generous federal and state tax credits."
"Yep, that's what I thought too. I tried to make the numbers work for a short term lease till the 3 - but it was too much."
"> Expected to launch in the UK in 2019

Nope. No it's not :("
"Actually, its more like a knee-jerk countereaction to Musk fans behaving _EXACTLY_ like trump fans."
This is the case with all vehicles that have frameless windows - the windows roll down slightly when first opened and remain down until the door is closed.  Those vehicles will damage their seals as well if the windows stop moving down (which I've personally seen).
"I don't understand. It's an emergency backup. Most people will never need to use it. Those who do, only once or twice. The risk of damage is really only there if you use it every single time you open the door."

"For this car, it'll still get the views it deserves."
"Haha, no way! There's like three hours of footage and of me saying the lines like 27 times until I I got them ""perfect."" I'm not uploading that crap!"
Because you can't see if it's going to hit the trunk lid from inside the car.
My vote is it was an oversight in the UI development.

"Unless you use voice control to say ""climate"" and then the scroll wheels switch to that context for a few seconds. "
with auto pilot I don't think it'll be that bad to deal with.
"Yeah I'm not expecting all the way down, it just looks like it goes much less further down than most cars I've seen.

Again, not a bad thing, just...weird. Like the backdoors not having a manual door."
I‚Äôve had multiple cars like that
Agreed 
Good point.
Okay. Not huge but it's not appealing at all.

Well it's still just one motor too. Not the highest performance possible.
"Yeah, that's totally fair. :)

Either way, though, whether the actual numbers for any of the mentioned cars are shifted a few tenths in either direction, the point is that the Model 3 doesn't in any way ""stomp"" on comparable BMWs or Audis when it comes to acceleration."
"Yeah, the 330i is definitely the more valid comparison. I unfortunately won't be able to keep the M235i that my Model 3 LR will be replacing as my primary car, but that's okay, I'm still really excited for it. :)"
"Last car I had was four settings so I'm not missing anything

edit: really this won't matter when we have automatic wipers (at this point it's basically a meme though)"

Another factor is the mining and ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù of the ore then disposition of battery packs. I am getting a 3 for a lot of reasons though not sure am reducing my toll on the Earth.
">Volvo's XC90 and S90 both have level 2 ADAS systems.

So only their top-of-the-line models. No S60, for example. I think that's going to be a mistake. When (if) the Model 3 starts selling in numbers, it'll be the lowest-priced way to get ADAS, and it's a software-upgradable system at that."
"The problem is people want a sports sedan, they dont want to look boring, but they are boring and they dont want it to drive like a sports sedan.

Same with the entire concept of SUV, they want a car that look like an offroader, but doesnt want it to drive like one.

Id blame the entire thing on people being too concerned with their image of looking like a boring person. News flash, no one gives a shit if you choose a BMW over a Lexus or something. Only if you drive a Tesla or a Corvette, then maybe, just maybe, people would give a shit."
BMW had to build more reliable cars Lexus.
"True, but amusingly enough this might be the most rare care he's ever reviewed at the time of filming.  Definitely top three."
Correct.
"I couldn't help noticing that the VIN has a bit of tape covering it up, just in case..."
I bet Tesla could search for cars will a certain profile name if they really wanted to find out who the owner is.
"Same here, I don‚Äôt even own a car."

Did you search yourself XD ?
"I always liked cars, but your videos are the most approachable. Kind of like a knowledgeable everyday guy approaching (usually) insane cars in a way that an average guy like me would never get the chance to."
"When I bought it, my 75D did 0-60 in 5.2 seconds. Last week, when I was at the service center to get my arachnid wheels, they ""uncorked"" the power so it now does 0-60 in 4.2 seconds."

Always been about the F40. No bells and whistles just a top flight driving experience (on a track). 
"Doug, since you recently did a Bolt EV video review, which do you think has the roomier driver space and which has the roomier backseat space?  "
"How comfortable was the back seat?  
  
One of the things I'm most worried about is the height of the seat and the angle it creates for the knees of the passenger.  
  
Would it be comfortable enough to bring adults along in the backseats for a 600 mile road trip for example?!?  
  
Loved the video. Many thanks for making and sharing!  :)

"
"Yeah, he'll be behind the passenger and the other kids with take second fiddle behind me when driving. As a second car that will take on the daily driving, trunk space isn't that much of a concern. Jan-Mar 2018 can't come soon enough."
"6'5"" here, thank you for your service sir!

No worries anymore about my M3 reservation!"
"These are honestly what sets you apart.   Anyone can do a review of the latest McLaren's handling and horsepower, few (just you?) actually take the time to point out the weird and interesting storage, the taillight logos (I'd never made that connection, and agree it's so cool!), and so on.  Quirks are what set your reviews apart.  That and the humor.  I watch because I like knowing the insane minutiae of cars I will probably never drive but may discuss over cocktails like a pro."
"Interesting. Motor trend said this about the Model 3:

""By happenstance, associate road test editor Erick Ayapana had penciled me into a 2.0-liter Alfa Romeo Giulia to get here, and it feels like a wet sponge by comparison.""

Which I took to mean the Model 3 had excellent handling. Will have to keep an eye on the reviews as more people get to drive them. "
Aww...bad luck! I hope it's just a software issue otherwise it will be embarrassing.
"Doug, the cnet guy was my favorite car reviewer, now you are my favorite. You have been for a good 6 months now."
Well that‚Äôs a good sign at least. Maybe it isn‚Äôt as bad as I thought.
I took that thought from [here](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/vauxhall/ampera-2012-2015/first-drives/opel-ampera-e-2017-review). Is it definitely not coming? 
They are both analogous. Shutting down minority arguments or being in echo chambers is never good
"I'm trying to picture Trump designing an orbital class rocket and then landing it.

"It wasn't in my 1980 celica. I mean it had manual windows, but it's not in all vehicles."
"I would assume if the car is working normally it'll still try to roll down the window when you manually open the door. If it's off/broken/you open it super fast the window could catch, hence the warning."
Lol fair enough!
Great point. Thanks.
Good point - I watched that section again and clearance appears to be slim to none between charge port door and trunk.
But audio channel or climate modes?
Voice control in any car is awkward and a pain
but it ain't here yet
"Me neither. I agree this kinda sucks compared to most cars, but luckily I will be in the driver's seat haha"

Me too. My doctor says I need antibiotics.
Which video was Doug talking about STIs?
"Both have about the same front seat room for legs and hips and knees, but the Bolt has more headroom on account of its tall hatchback design. However, I wasn't exactly hurting for headroom in the Model 3 -- I had 3-4 inches to spare between my head and the glass roof. 

I honestly don't remember the Bolt's rear seat space -- I'm sorry!"
"Everything I've read everywhere suggests that it's not...

We have the best rockets. Really really great. Everyone says so. Jeff who?
"It hurts to say this but I find this one example among others in this video of poor design on Tesla's part.

Not a fan of the interior door handles and the exterior door handles are yet another design. For each of the models to have different door opening methods it really does get tiring to explain to people.

There are consistent design traits across the models and the there are ridiculous differences that throw away any sense of continuity without actual improvement. Just kind of irks me.

But don't get me wrong, I am excited for this car."

"Yeah, but if you only have 4-5 keywords (Cruise, climate, wiper, light, music) and the rest is with the two wheel knobs, it would probably be pretty intuitive..."

"If they'd kept them in production I would have had one.   Doug is the reason I briefly had an AMG wagon in the first place - fantastic daily driver, and his joking about stopping for fuel on the way somewhere in town and again on the way back home is almost not a joke.  Still worth it, especially if you're a wagon nut."
"Yeah I threw ""maybe"" in there for that reason, but from what I've heard it really depends how many Model 3s Tesla made before Doug made this video.  There were 80ish built in the US according to my Mercedes NA guy (great source, I know) and [Jalopnik says ~330](https://jalopnik.com/the-ten-rarest-normal-cars-barely-ever-made-1666703964) worldwide.  So if Tesla delivered less than 108 in October, it very well could be rarer than the R63!"

"Awesome, thank you!  Great job by the way, the video of you driving is the first actual video that shows just how open the cabin feels due to the glass roof.  Outstanding timing as I've almost been tempted to just lease a Bolt and forget about the Model 3.  I think I might just hold out a bit longer based on your review and the fact you think the legroom and headroom isn't that much different either way for the driver.
"
"At the same time, one of the beauties of Tesla‚Äôs model is that it can push an update to have less revolutions on the motor that opens the charge port, giving more clearance to prevent interference.

Then again, we all may be reading into this WAY too much...  definitely wouldn‚Äôt be the first time."
We'll talk once it is. I hope they can do it right in which case my complaints basically disappear function wise (not aesthetically tho).
I forgot is there a voice button?

"Fair, but I rarely adjust those anyway. I still hate the design tbh."

On 2/3rds of that I agree. However wagons generally get no love these days.

"They are coming back.  I agree, not enough of them, but a few years back I was buying wagons (or trying to) and both Audi and Volvo - my go-to wagon purchases - told me to go away... or more appropriately, ""oh you mean you want an SUV when you say wagon?"" which is the same thing to me.  Both companies offer wagons again now.   Ferrari has offered several wagons in the last few years.   Mercedes has offered multiple 400+ hp wagons also.  The AMG CLS wagon is a beauty to behold.  

They still aren't popular, but they're not completely gone.  At some point a wagon will be electric.  It will be sold.  And then we'll just be tortured by the fact that we can't get it in the US.
