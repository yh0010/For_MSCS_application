"Tesla Semi Reservations Tracker

We should have this pinned to the sidebar."
How long until Fedex panics and orders for fear of getting left in the dust?
[deleted]
"Like I said, the Semi is a bigger deal than most people think. It's really going to put Tesla in a good situation."
"I'm hoping FedEx goes straight to 1000.

All of these fleet operators are doing a trial run with small buys. If the truck turns out to be as big of a success as we hope then they won't even be able to buy them beyond their initial reservation for years. It would be smart to put down a huge preorder to keep your spot in line and then cancel if it turns out to be a dud (unlikely). "
"I'm really excited about the climate change impact of the Tesla semi.  Heavy duty trucking (diesel) accounts for ~20% of transportation oil usage, and EV trucks could take a big chunk out of the market.

Gasoline (used mostly in passenger cars) accounts for just over 50% of transportation oil usage.  That segment is well on its way to being electrified.  So together we can eliminate 70% of oil used for transportation.

20% is used for jet fuel.  That's much harder to green up."
"Most UPS semi trucks drive 4 hours one-way, swap trailers with another truck, then drive back to where they started. Assuming the trucks are driving 65mph they should just barely be able to do that with a single charge. And every minute counts with these big couriers. If a trailer can arrive at it's destination just 10 minutes earlier due to the extra power uphills, the benefits can trickle all the way down the entire supply chain allowing them to offer more competitive services than other couriers, saving entire days on international shipments, allowing stricter commit times to rural destinations, or avoiding mid-day meetups for the bottom-rung drivers. It's actually pretty impressive how their packages are almost always in motion, rarely do packages sit in a warehouse any significant amount of time. It's really the perfect fit for a company like UPS."
"Now when will UPS have 100% electric delivery vans?  That's the use case they really need to be exploring.  USPS too.  It would require a lot of charging infrastructure at distribution centers, but plug in at night, drive a bunch of city driving during the day, and plug back in.  Perfect, clean, easy.  

Maybe Tesla is going to do delivery vans after the semi is developed?  Maybe based off the rumored Tesla pickup chassis?
"
"Somehow, I doubt that the ""fuel surcharge"" will magically disappear from my bill."
"Electric trucks make a lot of sense for ups.  The way ups distribution network is set up, a driver generally gets to work, drives a load to the nearest hub, usually 3 to 4 hours away drops it off, picks up another one, then brings it home.  Day done."
Wondered this on reveal night and even more so now: would the quick acceleration warrant a new way to hold cargo in place?
"Quick, someone please make an order for 150."

"This is starting to snowball, what trucking firm hasn't jumped on board? "
"Tesla needs to do batteries in trailers. The trailers can charge while they sit and have larger capacity. I run through scale houses daily and have never been close to 80k. They could replace the the area under the trailer where the skirts are and benefit from less drag.

I wish Tesla or other companies would ask drivers for input.  Some of us have degrees and would enjoy working with these tech companies (not for).

This step next as it would require less worries of running out of power due to delays.

UPS has CNG, liquid Propane, diesel in there fleet right now that I see regularly.  LP and CNG do not have the power or efficiency of diesel but fuel cost are offset from incentives. If I run low on CNG there is limited filling stations."
Stop preordering games.  Oh wrong sub.
"I work int he heavy equipment industry, and you'd be surprised at how fleet owners will dump relatively new equipment, just to get new stuff that uses a little less fuel.

Fuel is a huge expense and if they think they can save a decent amount of money switching to electric, it doesn't surprise me that they are ordering 100's of them right off the get go, even seeing some diesel/electric hybrids in construction equipment that is going over very well, not that its new tech, but its getting more common place to replace the mechanical drivetrain with electric motors and a smaller diesel generator, I'm assuming some fully electric equipment isn't very far off "
It's gonna put Tesla in good shape.
This is so freakin cool. Imagine how much less pollution 
"Waymo announced their hardware/software driver was able to adapt to driving their Semis much faster than they thought they would and they will be announcing logistics partnerships soon.

Driverless and electric will launch separately and both are game changers. When they combine, it will be a great time to be a consumer of food or goods."
UPS Pre-Orders 125 Tesla Electric Trucks. FedEx delivers 125 Tesla Electric Trucks to UPS.
And just like that Elon Musk goes down in history as revolutionizing transportation forever
"* Walmart: 15
* Loblaw: 25
* Anheuser Busch: 40
* Sysco: 50
* PepsiCo: 100
* UPS: 125

Total: 355"
Well here is the thing about the Tesla trucks that’s missed out in the presentation which is the weight of the actual truck INCLUDING the batteries! This is important to know as it will determine the weight of the haul it can carry according to the highway codes. You’d imagine the weight of shipment a truck can carry is of absolute importance to a shipping company like UPS so either they know something that’s left out for the public or they don’t care and just did this for carbon emission balancing etc.
Fed ex should worry about delivery vehicles first our route has had a guy in a uhaul for the last 3 packages I recieved.
Guess they didn’t get the memo about pre orders
Dey took er Jobs! 
How will I know my mail is here if I can't hear the truck from 3 blocks away anymore?
Who will deliver the trucks tho🤔🤔
Y’all can thank me for this! Been delivering pizza in Tesla for the past two weeks to ups! Round 6 tonight! I’ll post proof
:burns_excellent:
"100, 100, 125, can we a 125, 125, 125! to the guy in the brown shorts."
Suck on that Pepsi 
They've got a decent number of them from what I understand. They're astounding. Except for that beeping they're 100% silent and it blows my mind something that big can be so quiet.
"Cheapest virtue signaling campaign ever. If they don't come up with the truck - oh well, guess we get our money back. "
Remember no preorders
"Meanwhile USPS is in talks of replacing all their 20+ year old LLVs with newer ICE's, FML."
"I find people doubting the specifications and price all over the place. I can't wait for the trucks to start delivering so I can enjoy how they squirm as they pivot to complain about other things. Who knows, maybe panel gaps."
its not like Tesla can build them any time soon. but for now all the companies preordering are #metoo 
"You guys realize that this is a PR move, not some kind of change right?  

Theres no way Tesla can produce these trucks, with any kind of efficiency or urgency.

But, If you ""pre-order"" trucks, your brand is seen as progressive for the low low price of a deposit on a micro fleet.
"
Where's that list of all the semi pre-orders to date?
"Cut employee healthcare to afford this, nice guy UPS!"
Now they can silently lose my stuff
"#  Companies going to keep fucking us if we don't end this pre-order culture!

Oh, I... Uh.   Wrong sub, sorry"
"Good, maybe I’ll get the package that has been out for delivery for and shows back up at the carrier facility at the end of the day for over a week now when they get the Teslas. "
[deleted]
in yo' face pepsi !
"Moar, MOAR!

Okay, so who's going to be first to 200? Make your bets here."
Will they have white tops?
I wonder if they just put a note on the front door instead of actually trying to deliver the trucks. 
Fascinating news!
The game of 1 upping # of trucks
How many is that total so far?
Anyone know how many preorders TSLA has received in total for their trucks?
They've already begun to transition the package cars to electric/hybrid (the brown trucks). I could totally see them transitioning the semi's that stay local.
I feel like the Semi from Tesla is going to be a bigger deal than their sedans. Because more trucking companies/owners can already afford the $200k price for a truck versus not as many car owners can afford a $35k sedan even if it means saving $ on gas. Is anyone tracking how many publicly announced preorders have been made from the Semis?
Ive been thinking tesla should replace those awful truck ups uses
"I want one, I will never have one. Is there anyone in the DFW area willing to pick me up and take a drive? I'll buy tacos."
"great, now they have another excuse in their pockets to say why they can't deliver to my door.  ""we didn't charge our vehicles"""
They should preorder some better logistics software so they can stop losing my LTL orders.
"Just so they know, they're gonna be late on deliveries, 'cause everyone will want to look at 'em.

I know I will."
They ordered the trucks before they ordered the trucks?!! 
"If Tesla can pull off this distribution of electric trucks and saturate the market, as well MINE ASTEROIDS IN COUPLING WITH SPACEX, you might see a bump in their stock price. "
So who gets to drive the new trucks? 
"I wouldn't doubt Fedex will be quick behind them. Might even see Amazon spend some cash on these. These package shipping companies benefit the most from the trucks, because they usually travel from airport to distribution center, or distribution center to distribution center. They rarely travel across country. So the range isn't really a problem. Also, since they just ship mostly boxes the weight of the truck can be manipulated easily and can be calculated for efficiency.  "
"And so, the one-upsmanship begins. "
"Yeah, yeah neat and stuff... what do they LOOK LIKE."
ANOTHERONE
Don't they want real world wear and tear reports on these things before they order a fleet?
cool lemme get one
I feel like truck drivers are sweatin'
"I'm wonder if this is PR damage control for these 2 stories this week alone:

What happened to Reddit hating pre-orders?
I wish there was a way to upvote a few times.
man im about to buy the shit out of the 3 tesla shares i can afford.
"Is a reservation really a pre-order though? 

If I pre-order something, I usually pay in full.
If I reserve something, there may not even be a cancellation fee."
Didn’t we just have a talk about pre-ordering?!
How many pre orders is this so far?
"Checking in from my non-electric UPS truck. Get 'em, Brown! "
Fedex should deliver the trucks to UPS.
It begins. The  unemployment line will be huge in 10 years 
Can’t wait to see these out on the highways 20 years from now. 
"Hopefully they adding ac to the boys in brown too. AZ is too dam hot for your workers to be ac less, UPS!! "
Read this two or three times trying to figure out why a battery company needed to preorder UPS. 
Where they hell are they getting the money for that?
[deleted]
Then why is their stock down 3% in the past week??
maybe my orders will actually come on time now.
Even Jake Paul claimes to have ordered one...
This is interesting considering that I work next to railroad tracks and see train after train go by with UPS trailers on the train cars.  
"Honestly, while I assume teh semi will be an over-the-road normal semi for major route transport, converting their fleet of brown delivery trucks would probably be a huge savings for them.  The Semi is estimated to have a 2000 mile range without the 80,000 pound trailer attached, and even a full loaded UPS delivery truck can't approach that anyway, so they'd essentially have an entire day's charge on zero fuel, with no idle losses and improved acceleration helping delivery times.   

Do it, UPS.  Start the conversion conversation... we want RVs!  Make Tesla notice conversions are a thing!"
will these be self driving capable?
This is good for Tesla.
I hope that if they deliver the trucks to Canada that they have to impose some bullshit fee on the shipping that would be the equal value or more of the trucks.
I am probably lacking common knowledge here but how much can this thing carry when it has a fully charged battery? The battery has to make up a significant portion of the 80'000 pounds correct?
Is there any list of companies having ordered trucks? 
But will UPS deliver them?
I would expect this to make Tesla stick worth more but nope still in a nose dive
I fucking WANT a Tesla minivan.
[deleted]
Two days after that bunk video came out saying these trucks are worthless.
"Remember guys,
#Don't preorder!"
"I do not understand the Tesla 18 wheeler. The use case is very limited at this point in time. 

Now a 25ft non cdl truck that is used in short haul city business? I can see the market there. 

I work for a food manufacturer and am heavily involved in freight logistics, reefers make this a non starter for the foreseeable future. "
"So this is kinda like Kickstarter for companies: cool new potential product, not ready to release yet, might impress or disappoint."
Fuck preorders 
AAHHHHHHHH OMG LETS GO
"I’m curious about this phenomenon of Tesla’s truck preorders making it to the front page.

Can anyone give me insight as to why we care so much?"
what an idiots.
Too bad electric vehicles are worse for the environment than diesel or even gas engines 
Great if you like short-range and no hills.
"Tesla can’t fulfill orders of their new vehicle, how can they fill these orders?! "
"No, the vets my friend.  Worked a hub in northeast Ohio with maybe 130 routes out of it"
Won’t even be ready by 2020. Plenty of time to cancel
Don't they know? NEVER PREORDER!
Shhh...Don’t let trump hear about this. 
"LOL, UPS ordered 125 trucks during the holidays?!!?  I hope Tesla promises 7-10 business days, they show up in 15 business days, and 4 of them are fucking broken, because FUCK UPS!"
[removed]
"Beginning of the end for the Feeder employees.

YA HEAR THAT? FREELOADING UNION WORKERS YOU'RE ALLLLLL FIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRREED!!!

Seriously though, the human workforce will drop by nearly half when UPS gets the tech they want in most of their hubs.  So much is already automated."
Stick the processing robot with drone pad inside a trailer and get mad residential doors-step delivery rates with driver wearing freaking VR delivery helmet! 
Cool but will it fix their MOST shitty customer service? 
Holy shit the backorder... Ain't gonna be good for $TSLA that's for sure...
"Oh, I bet they get them right after all those people who pre-ordered their Elios get theirs, too!"
"Legal question, what happens if the truck runs over someone? Who goes to jail?"
"These will be useful for about 7 years, then driverless delivery trucks will be produced and send all these to the scrapyard."
They won't get them by Christmas
"How can Tesla keep up with these orders, when their model 3 production is slow. Wouldn't these large companies get much more impatient compared to model 3 consumers. 🤔"
"500+ mile road trips will be a thing of the past when countries outlaw petrol and diesel vehicles. They should focus on perpetual motion machines before pure electric. 

Those long trips are what keep truckers on the road and able to pay their bills. Unless these companies plan on paying way more per mile for electric truck drivers, it won't be a decent paying job at all. "
Lol! I never understood how writing the note and potentially coming back the next 2 days is any easier than just deliver the damn thing! Assuming it is intentional thou
"0-60 in 5 seconds or whatever, but for UPS the 60-30-60 as they briefly slow down in front of your door before driving by is the real key performance figure. "
Touché
My dad is a driver. He says he gets complaints that people say he doesn’t knock. So he knocks as loud as possible. 
There simi trucks not delivery vans
http://i.imgur.com/O3opjt1.jpg
I thought this was a problem just with my local delivery guy lmao 
Ooohhhh burn!
It will be done by drones. So you will easily hear the drone as it drops off the package on your roof. 
"Unless the package requires a signature (which is probably <1% for myself), they just leave my packages at my door which I definitely prefer."
"Funny story, we bought a ring doorbell and the only carrier that actually rings our doorbell is the UPS guy. Pretty frustrating "
"People should just make mailboxes for deliveries. Even just have an open box with an open combo-lock on it. The delivery-man puts the item in the box, and closes the lock. The owner then retrieves it later. "
Take those upvotes you mad bastard you.
They can't sneak up on your door if you were not home when the package was delivered.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Get a doggo
OMFG DED
They generally don't use the semis to deliver door to door. 
But its tires on the road that make the most noise
"Enroll into ‘no sig required’ if possible. They come to the door, knock, leave the package on the door and leave "
Your deliveries comes on a semi?
Pffft that's nice of them. At least they showed up.
These trucks will be used for line drivkng not residential deliveries.
"They do this at my warehouse, they’re supposed to call as there’s usually someone in there. But usually keep the doors closed, not in the nicest neighborhood. "
At my house they prefer to leave the package on the step without knocking or ringing the doorbell. 
Or steal back iPhones 
"For real though. If Tesla makes a box truck version of this...just end the combustion box truck life, fam. It's over. Put a fork in it. Those trucks can run a shift, charge over night, do it again, rarely go down for maintenance. How many delivery trucks does UPS have?

Damn, Tesla."

/r/unexpected 
"> It makes sense

... to order with a company that currently has been proven to suck horribly. Yeah... great fucking idea. Call me when they are actually able to make their Model 3car without any problems in decent volumes."
FedEx: “We’ll take 126”
"I guess it kinda makes sense.  The bigger the order, the longer you may want to take to research and make sure it's viable.  And maybe preparing finances."
They must think every Semi comes with a Raodster like at the reveal
"It’s just PR, the order size is a tiny fraction of their entire fleets. If they buy Tesla trucks they’re ‘new’, ‘forward-thinking’ and ‘environmentally conscious’ companies.

It’s beneficial in the long-run because Tesla gets orders to test and refine the design and companies are compelled to buy them now without any real-world testing guaranteed ROI. Tesla has to nail these first versions, if they want people to buy them because they’re actually better than gas trucks and not just good PR."
"""Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup"""
Honestly in these small quantities it’s mostly a PR stunt. It helps their green image and taps in to that rabid Tesla fan base.
It's like repost karma. 
"Or they are after free publicity. Going green, look how good we are about the environment, give your business to a green outlooking company etc. etc. etc."
It's basically a marketing stunt for them. Looks good to investors and their public image. 125 trucks is really nothing compared to the size of their fleet. 
I think they probably all ordered at the same time and Tesla is working with them on press release dates with the bigger ones later
Lovely one-upsmanship no?
Makes me wonder how many Amazon might pre-order.
"125 is very few in the grand scheme of things. It feels like the one-upping is just for PR, while the actual purchase is for testing purposes."
"Wow - it’s almost like competition is a **good** thing!!! 

Ooops! I seem to have forgotten I’m on reddit. 

#communism socialism communism Marx competition is bad"

"Yea, they have a lot of distribution centers but they probably want to keep all near a mega charger.  This leads me to think they’re gonna try and flip an ICE serviced distribution center into a EV serviced distribution center for a test.  I bet that area will breath easier with less air pollution.

The reduction of air pollution can not be overstated; the LA and Long Beach ports combined create the most air pollution in all Southern California with their moving freight containers a couple times until the Recipient claims it.

"
125! = 1.88e209 that would be enough for an eternity. 125 is still quite a few though.

"hmm,  not sure if sarcastic or not , both or just a reply fail."
"If tesla had a good alternative for those mini-ups trucks, they could order thousands of them."
"Based on the number, I'd guess they're going to go to one or two distribution centers, probably Chicago and Louisville, as they are two of the largest hubs in the US. "
"It has the *potential* to put Tesla in a good situation. 

Tesla still need to deliver on their promises but until then, this is still in the *potential* category of game-changers. 

I don’t wanna sound like a nay-sayer because I’m far from that, but i also don’t want to fall in the trap of being a blind fan. 

Edit: 

There's been a few replies to this comment and another comment about my ""cautiously optimistic"" statement. I'll try to reply to those comments as well but I wanted to add an edit here to get ahead of the ""you're wrong"" replies. 

My comment here is not meant to say that Tesla will not fulfill their promise, nor am I trying to argue that Tesla is not currently in a good situation. I'm just addressing the comment that the Semi will put Tesla in a good situation. I believe the Semi **can** put Tesla in a good situation but as of right now, it can't do much other than fuel the hype. There are no Tesla's on the road transporting goods, or even Tesla semis in production, it's simply a POC right now and trying to shake up the industry. 

So again, I'll reiterate what my comment was originally trying to say. The Semi *can* be a big deal, the Semi *can* become a game-changer, the Semi *can* put Tesla in a good situation, but as of December 19 2017, the Tesla Semi is simply just another proof of concept similar to the [Nikola Corp](https://nikolamotor.com/one) electric semi."
"This is why I think Tesla needs to develop a pick-up like vehicle as they are the 1, 2 and 3 top selling vehicles in the USA (Ford F-Series, Chevy Silverado, and Dodge Ram respectively) due to their commercial and private popularity. The 6 models of full-sized pickups topped 2.2 million sales in 2016 of 17.4 million total vehicles sold that year. If Tesla is going to do commercial vehicles like Semis, then they meed to do a full size pickup too. It just makes sense for them to do one too. Their electric semi competition Nikola is already prototyping a fully electric UTV, so it seems feasible."
"I'm really curious about the profit margin for Tesla on this truck. It doesn't do them much good if they are selling them at cost or only a few % over.

The good news is that as big as these trucks are, they are relatively simple from an engineering and manufacturing standpoint. Much easier to build than a unibody car."
"Sales arent an issue for Tesla. 

Making vehicles are.

To go from a 100k/year car company to 7000k a year is going to be a jump.

As someone in auto, I cannot explain how difficult this is. Everything from Mold Design to square footage needed on the line is affected."
How so?
"It's a much *smaller* deal than most people think.  The entire heavy duty market is only about 250,000 vehicles per year.  If they captured half the market, it would only be $15 billion per year.

Meanwhile GM is selling >$150 billion per year worth of cars."
yeah a lot of people don't realize that drivers are probably the most-employed job in this country. 
I saw a lot of criticism about cargo load. Any updates about that?
"Didn’t we say that about the model 3?

I’m still waiting for my configuration email. "
I read a news article recently that had a sentence about how the Roadster reveal took everyone's focus away from the semis.... lol nope. Roadster was an awesome added surprise but anyone with half a brain knows how huge a deal these trucks are. 
Cancellation charges end up being hefty. 
Yeah but wouldn’t it make more sense to buy fewer first generation models and then order more once a newer version of the vehicle have come out so all of the kinks and problems the first one had is worked out? 
"I work on a lot of these FedEx trucks every single day, none of them take care of the current little box trucks that they have already, I don't see any of them in my area purchasing anything new like this. We had one operator come in last night needing a full brake overhaul, all four tires in the rear, and a battery. She opted for brake pads, and that's it. We had to jump start the van to get it into the shop, then again to get it out. "
"It’ll be a tough sell for UPS to get the drivers union on board with the new equipment so they need to wade into the roll out. Not to mention we have extensive repair and maintenance capabilities for current equipment and moving to something new always involves a learning curve for technicians, new tooling, etc. It sounds great to have these corporations buy in immediately but that is not the reality of daily operations. Same way when the air group buys a new model freight liner. They buy small until they can determine how it works, how to train people to work in, around, on the equipment, etc."
FedEx won't buy any. They don't own their own trucks. They effectively franchise their delivery routes like McDonald's franchises their restaurants.
"UPS is the largest trucking company in the world. 
Half to 2/3 of the work done by tractors could be done with an EV with a 500 mile range. If the dollars/mile works out and they aren’t junk, UPS could write a check today for 10,000 tractors. 
I’m pretty sure no manufacturer is going to ignore that buying power.

Looking forward to driving one. Can’t say that I much like the LNG tractors. I won’t miss shifting a 10 speed either. "

"The exciting thing is that products like the Tesla Semi will take a segment of the market which fits (shorter journeys between established depots), which will drive investment, which will improve the product (say, to extend range), and take more of the market, which will drive more investment to improve the product, and so on. Once that process starts it seems likely it will end up with a large market share, it's just a question of how quickly the transition occurs.

> 20% is used for jet fuel. That's much harder to green up.

I think we'll need chemical storage of electricity for the grid, the last 20-40% of the grid will need to run from chemical fuel to maintain backup. Synthesizing that by putting in zero-carbon energy is a similar challenge to synthesizing jet fuel."
"Yeah but even if you hypothetically eliminated that 70% of the US transportation oil usage what is the actual impact it has on the total global emissions...id say very little.

Even the US impact as a whole is marginal compared to the likes of China and India. 

It's a start but in terms of global impact, even if all trucks and cars were converted to fully electric today, it would *still* not cause seriously sizable reduction especially when china's emissions are only going up each year. "
"If this eventually dropped gas prices, that would be nice. "
Not to mention the local air quality. Suddenly you remove the only real pollutant left in cities.

Don't forget they can charge a reasonable amount of range in the 10min they are loading / unloading.

Doesn't UPS use propane trucks?
"I do see why Tesla went Semi first, when everybody else wen't smaller.  The load/battery percentage for a 8 hour drive is better on semis.  A semi vs delivery van both burn roughly the same fuel, so would need roughly the same battery pack.  X tons of battery out of 40 is better than X tons of battery out of 13. "

"It shouldn't if they're being secured correctly now.

Up to now it wouldn't be acceleration that would determine how it's secured, but braking.

[Trucks can brake astonishingly fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0myPp2NmOqo) given the mass involved, and faster than the Semi will accelerate. Faster than a small child can run. Not as good if braking hard causes everything to go through the front bulkhead (if that's the right word) of the trailer.

"Was thinking this too. I'm imagining there will be a ""slow and steady"" mode that provides much slower/smoother acceleration. I think the ""get up and go"" will be there if you need it.. but I can't imagine it being the norm. Kind of like an eco mode in some cars. It remaps the pedal."
The quick acceleration isn't any more than the deceleration you get with the brakes on an ICE truck. Just the direction is different.

">125 trucks

>starting to snowball

The biggest issue I see from Tesla fanboys is not understanding scale. 125 vehicles can be made in a large garage. When you get into the Tens and Hundreds of thousands, the challenges become more expensive, varied, and time consuming."
Eddie Stobart.
This is a great point - about putting a battery in the trailer. But I'm guessing someone at Tesla has already thought of this. They need a working semi with a decent range first. A Tesla Trailer with additional battery power can be phase 2: an add-on product once they get Tesla Semi production streamlined. 
"In the Semi unveil, Elon states that they have already consulted with many truck drivers during development."
You don't think they consulted truckers before make this? 
Not even close actually. 125 trucks is what most truck manufacturers make per-day. Tesla still has a long way to go to come close to making a profit.
"Unfortunately most likely won't be realized until 2020 before the sales start to make an impact in the Stock price. If only investors started to see the Model 3's progress, realize the Semi uses a lot of the 3's architecture and start valuing the coming disruption Tesla's Semi will create sooner than later because of Tesla's proven ability to deliver, albeit not as fast as some expect."
It's a good thing I consume food!
But it will also be a huge negative impact to the families who have a driver providing most of their household income with few transferable skills. 
"I wonder if part of the decision making process for these companies included the possibility of self driving, or if the long term reduced transport costs alone we're enough to convince them this is a smart choice. If it's the latter, I can only imagine how quickly transport companies would replace their drivers (when the tech is viable and legal)."
"> Well here is the thing about the Tesla trucks that’s missed out in the presentation which is the weight of the actual truck INCLUDING the batteries!

The chassis weight of the Tesla Semi is similar to its competitors.

You can actually calculate the weight of the Tesla Semi from the numbers Tesla disclosed, [I did the calculations here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7j5syd/volvo_and_scania_skeptic_to_tesla_semi_from/dr4jgtv/), and **the Tesla Semi, including batteries, weighs about 9.1 tons or 18,200 lbs**, which is about 2,100 lbs less weight than the comparable Scania model (""Scania R 620 6X4 PRIME MOVER"" series) with a diesel engine.

So if a trucker switches from Scania to Tesla, the maximum payload weight increases by about 2,100 lbs.
"
"The whole weight argument is BS.

Actual semi payloads are almost never over 40000 lbs according to the EPA.

Even if the battery pack is 10k lbs(worst case scenario), there is plenty of weight savings to keep the Tesla tractor under the 16k-20k weigh of a traditional tractor.

"
They are independent contractors 
UPS and FedEx both run rentals to assist in capacity during the holiday. No point owning more trucks than you need year round. 
"Lmao. Did you receive what you ordered? Yes? Good. 
What difference does it make what type of truck delivers the packages to the comfort of your home? 

"
Remember how there was a Roadster in the container of the Tesla Semi at the event? That's how. Except the roadster will probably be something less... expensive.

"Realistically that's been the story with Tesla from the beginning.  ""Yeah but they won't be able to..."""
"It's something I too see everywhere, and I just can't figure it out. Tesla has delivered late, but rarely not delivered. Yet, somehow they still get no faith from many. I think it's a combination of people that don't want to admit Tesla is going to wreck their businesses, and also people who are depressed about the state of the world, and can't reconcile their worldview with what Tesla promises."
"Well, one and a fraction years. The important parts (motors, packs, screens, inverters, etc) are already being produced."

"[UPS are Teamsters.](https://teamster.org/divisions/package) The UPS contract is the largest collective bargaining agreement in North America and the union pays 100% of their medical and dental.

It's a weird situation to look at from the outside.

This is why you join and support unions kids. UPS people also get pensions and Teamsters gets like 5k of invoice of cars like Fords and shit."
">The tally of confirmed reservations is now just over 400 trucks, but that’s just from companies having publicly announced their Tesla Semi pre-orders. We think that smaller fleet operators and other companies have also quietly placed orders.

"I honestly don't see this catching on with the OTR and owner operator crowd unless Tesla makes a sleeper cab version. These daycab trucks are only good for in town pickup and delivery.

Not to mention the huge infrastructure overhaul needed to charge these things."
Are you serious? They literally held an event showing off both models. Elon Musk showed up to the event and got out of one. 
Nope
"There is no cancellation fee when reserving a Tesla car, probably no fee either for the Semi."
"[In 2016](http://nasdaqomx.mobular.net/nasdaqomx/7/3521/5025/document_0/UPS_2016_Annual_Report-processed.pdf), UPS had $3.4 billion of income on $60.9 billion of revenue.

At $20,000 per reservation, it costs UPS $2.5 million to make 125 reservations.  It's basically a rounding error for them."

I guess that's way everyone is ordering it 
Electric reefers? That would be sweet in a city and delivery situation. No noisy and service hungry diesel engine. 
It suggests the semi is genuinely desirably.
Lol!
How so? 
"EVs are relatively more efficient in hills, thanks to regen."
They are ahead of their original schedule.
The model 3 is ahead of the original estimates. The semi is made of Model 3 parts.
"Maybe an autonomous UPS truck is a step in the right direction.

Edit- would require an integrated air cannon to deliver packages to the door step"
How will the packages get from the driverless delivery trucks to the customer's front porch or office lobby?
"I'm going to assume you're not a troll.

You can feasibly charge an electric car in 15-30 minutes. As the technology advances miles per charge and charge time will improve.

As for electric semis, a common thought for a solution to the range issue is a battery swap. When the truck needs a charge, they just stop off and their battery would be swapped with a fully charged one. The old battery gets charged and ready to get put into another vehicle.

Charge times on semis would still be relatively short however."
I doubt waiting 30 minutes over lunch to full-charge an additional 500 miles worth of range on the batteries are going to be a problem for anyone.
"Drivers have a pretty tough delivery schedule for the day. If they don't act fast, their working day becomes that much longer."
"Normally drivers leave notes because:

* Package requires a signature and nobody answers to sign

* UPS has had stolen package complaints from the address and will no longer leave packages at the location. 

* There is something which concerns the driver in terms of package security (kids in the area taking packages, shady characters in general,  bad neighborhood,  etc.)

* An intercept placed on the package by the shipper. 

* Any other barrier to entry (Aggressive dogs, barred gates, security codes for apartment buildings that haven't been provided,  even adamant hired security teams keep drivers out sometimes)

Drivers want to deliver their load because it means that much less work for them the next day. They don't want to drive to an address (especially in rural areas) to just write a note.  But they also don't mess around waiting.  As soon as they ring your bell/buzzer/knock they are filling out an infonotice. If nobody shows up by the time they finish filing it out, and they don't feel that they are clear to leave the package, then they are onto their next delivery.  There is no time to waste, especially around this time of year.  Drivers in my area easily hit 10 or 11 hour days. 

Source: am UPSer"
"Source: Ex-FedEx driver

Some days are predictably heavier (in terms of package load) than others. For example, our Mondays ( loosely followed by Thursdays) were conventionally lighter than most other days. So if you have a package that requires a signature on a heavy day, you might prefer to deliver a signature package on an upcoming lighter day. 

Sometimes the mentality is that because you are delivering a signature package during work hours, on a Friday, you'd rather attempt the delivery on Saturday because the customer is much more likely to be there to accept the package. Playing the odds on this one usually saves time.

The reverse is also true for businesses. If you are delivering on a Saturday, you might just drive by the business, and say you attempted to deliver because the likelihood of it being closed (usually smaller businesses) is so high. Delivering on a Monday, in this case, would likely result in your having to attempt the package just one time. "
The UPS drivers where im at will do anywhere from 150 to 400 stops a day. Every minute counts to finish in a safe and timely manner
You mean they have to wait on those of us who don't open the fucking door? No. Lot's of work specially in the holiday season.
It is at least very often intentional.
"Much easier to leave it on the doorstep of my shady apartment complex. At least once they get self-driving UPS trucks, the truck can’t actually pretend to deliver your package and then steal it "
"They come back?  Unless it is signature required they just leave it on the porch.  If signature required, they usually require me to pick up at the local office rather than attempt redelivery."
There are only two reasons they don’t leave a package: there is a risk of someone potentially stealing it from your porch or it requires a signature.
"Go watch the episode of sunny where Charlie works in a mail room. That's pretty much their routine. If it looks important they'll deliver it, if it doesn't they'll mail it back to themselves to deliver another day (leave the note), and if it looks like trash they'll burn (lose) it because if it's important it'll just get reordered anyway, right?"
"1.  some boxes need signatures and it is not up to the driver to decide that.

2. Drivers are on a scheduel to with time commits and pickups that have to be done within  time windows.  unfortunatly that means waiting 5 min at someones door waiting for them to answer it can quite literally throw the whole day off.  I drove for two years and as a driver you try to fit as much as you can inbetween your time windows.  which means 5 min at one house means that might have to break out of a residential neighboorhood to go do a pickup.  Then because i didn't get what i needed to get done before my pickups, I would have to drive back to where I left off putting back another 15 min because I planned on finishing your neighborhood before the pickups or whatever my commit time was.  do this a few times during the day and all the sudden your 10 hour day becomes a 14 hour day real fast.   

"
"Trust me, we want to get rid of that package more than you want to receive it. 

But like others have said, we have a very busy schedule. If we waited just 1 minute longer at half our stops, depending on the route, that could add an hour or more to our day. 

It's crazy how much time and training is spent on the efficiency side of things. But in the end, it works."
"I just skip a step and leave a note that says UPS/FedEx/USPS in huge letters outside and then on the inside, ""If a signature is required please leave the package on the doorstep and take this signed note in place of a signature."""
"Well you got to realize also that you can't just leave a package if it's a signature required package, can't wait there for 10 minutes without anyone answering takes way too much time from the day. "
"I worked for UPS last year as a helper during the holidays. Very rarely did any packages require a signature. We definitely did not want to leave a note and come back the next day. 90% of packages were a ring a drop. The signatures take way too long whether anyone is home or not. But we waited an ample amount of time and rang several times before giving up and leaving a note. If all packages required a signature, they would never get delivered. "
"Could be a pre-order of new flagship ohone and he's a troll that likes the opposite OS??

You right. There is still so many questions about weight and maintenance. Thats THE big fkn issue.
"Tesla has yet to release the weight of the semi, this is very important. So I'm holding my breath. "

IMO a truck is the perfect market for an electric vehicle. 
I'm holding out for the eventual Tesla pickup truck.
 They are working on a pickup. There was an early render released when they unveiled the semi. 
"Yeah, I wonder about this too, and it's also why I think they're using some ""secret sauce"" to get the price to where it needs to be - a battery breakthrough or at least a larger jump that the normal 2-3% annual progress.

**Warning** - Some simplifications below to make a point. 

For arguments' sake, let's call it an 800kWh pack.  That's 8 P100Ds they could be making with those cells.

8*135k = $1,080,000 in potential P100D sales, or $900k in 100D.
Figure a 30% margin on that is $324/300k.

Compare to Model 3: 10 LR 80kWh packs @ 25% margin of $44k = $110k profit.

I just don't see how it behooves Tesla to make a semi and make $70k in margin (~30% on $200k) because it means they're giving up revenue.  I guess, at the very least, it means they're *very* confident of the Gigafactory being able to produce as many cells/packs as they'll need to do everything they want to do."
You can take a profit negative for awhile to setup a market position. See: Amazon.
Probably a lot. Lots of shared parts. Even the model 3 has a decent margin from the estimates. I’d bet the truck is much more than that.
worked for amazon
"> It doesn't do them much good if they are selling them at cost or only a few % over.

Sure it does! They need to convince companies that this is the truck of the future. An early adopter discount (even if they sell these at a small loss) is a great way to do that. They aren't just trying to own the market, they are trying to create it."
"I don't think it really is. They are a growing company and once they are large and have the cash flow of the larger companies it won't be such an issue. And something you forget is that Tesla is always updating their cars unlike other manufactures that have model years and start and stop a model year at a specific time. I'm not denying it's a huge task, but I think they can pull it off."
By making them a lot of money.
"That's because those are just standard replacements. If all truckers move to electric, that number would be much higher."
No we actually didn’t. People knew the model 3 is a big deal. People think the truck isn’t.
There are no cancellation charges on Tesla reservations. Only when the vehicle starts production are you locked in with a deposit that is non refundable.
Depends on the income curve generated by the first generation model. Don’t want to fall too far behind since you were a late adopter. 
That’s what they are *doing*. Wait till you see the second round of orders (after the first round of trucks performs in the field).
"I'm not in any of these companies boardrooms. But at my company we are more than willing to support a new potential supplier if we have a vested interest. In this case, if Tesla is successful bringing this as a mass-produced product to the market. These companies stand to save a lot of money. Again all companies think differently but with several hundred on order Tesla has extra motivation and security in getting this product to market."
The companies currently reserving these trucks have fleets of thousands or even tens of thousands of trucks currently. These reservations of 100 trucks are very small.
">I think we'll need chemical storage of electricity for the grid, the last 20-40% of the grid will need to run from chemical fuel to maintain backup. Synthesizing that by putting in zero-carbon energy is a similar challenge to synthesizing jet fuel.

The round trip efficiency of such a system would be terrible, you'd be lucky to get 25% with hydrocarbons, though methane might get you a bit more because it's a lot easier to synthesize.

Batteries and various forms of pumped storage can get upwards of 90% round trip efficiency. They seem like far better candidates to me.

At best you might achieve 50% for pure hydrogen(though 40-45% is more realistic), but even then you're not synthesizing hydrocarbons, so it's a completely different process than synthesizing jet fuel.

Unless you plan to use hydrogen for jet fuel in which case that problem is already mostly solved."
"EVs are being adopted all over the world.  It's not just a US thing.  They may be a few years behind, but we'll see 70% everywhere."
They usually grab another trailer and go on without stopping
Or possibly swap charged batteries at each stop?
Got em' coach.
"Well they haven't propagated out here into the wilds of low-tech northern Ohio.  I work adjacent to a UPS distribution facility and it's hundreds of gas powered brown trucks as far as the eye can see.

I'd imagine that using Electric trucks for short haul like this would cause electric infrastructure build-out to the distro centers, making electric delivery trucks more common."
"Ups doesn't care about the environment one bit....what they do care a lot about are fuel cost and maintenance cost.  The cost of maintaining their fleet is astronomical.  Much of that could be alleviated by electric vehicles, and solar power....which I'm sure will be their next step."
They totally do! I love that about them. Propane costs less than half of gasoline and runs about 10-20% less efficiently. And with more modern systems you can keep the gasoline injectors for when you run out and keep going.
"It was so beautiful, our local school levy failed.  Taxes went down, they tried to re up again, but huge scandal of millions missing has soured that pot for a long time.

"The door is at the back of the trailer and cargo is loaded from front to back. When the load shifts forward all items are compressed. Often times in UPS vehicles the loose parcels are used as dunnage to stabilize any palletized goods. If the load shifts upon acceleration the cargo travels toward the door of the trailer.

I hope you can appreciate the difference."

"You’ve calculated the chassis’s weight based on the acceleration numbers provided by Tesla and that’s certainly a neat way of doing it however the amount of batteries packed might have only been for the purpose of an acceleration test and not a 500miles drive which certainly affects the size of batteries you must load. Just did a bit of googling trying to get more info on the subject and it kooks like there really is a big confusion across the board as to the size of payload vs truck weight for the Tesla Semi and i guess that debate will only be put to bed by Tesla once they spell out clearly the truck’s weight, battery’s weight and the payload limits."
"I have hauled many loads that were over 40,000 lbs as an OTR driver. The EPA is full of shit. It is not uncommon at all."
"Regularly have 47000 in my air can. Truck is 21500 at full tanks. 2007 W900L 265"" WB C15 Twin Turbo CAT 18 speed on AG380 suspension. Trailers is 11000 pounds 2014 MAC Pneumatic 1650 cu ft 4 pot trailer. Typical tare is 32000 at 2/3 tank. 

Same truck sans PTO and blower with a 43'x102""x78"" Timpte Super Hopper had a tare of 29000. Average payload of 50500 pounds. 

Looking at going back to hoppers with a lightweight spec 389 with a coffin sleeper and slightly shorter wheelbase but big Cummins power (X15 565/2050 backed with an 18 speed) and was quoted a tag weight on the truck from engineering at Peterbilt of 16800 +/- 1%. Same hopper trailer at 9000 pounds would be able to net 54000 on average on a standard 5 axle setup.

"They have delivered some and they do have the range and performance they promised. Never get it, stay naive."
"So far those people were right.

Only for the first year with Model S did Tesla suprise people. Now that they are trying to mass produce, the company is failing to deliver."
"> I think it's a combination of people that don't want to admit Tesla is going to wreck their businesses,

Tesla has sold 100k vehicles all time. Worth 50B

GM sells 7,000k Vehicles a year. Worth 60B.

The difference in planning, investment, marketing, etc.. to increase 7,000% is the hard part. Anyone can make a car, only a few companies can make and sell 7M vehicles a year."

Asking for a lot more energy density and batteries than already present. Cost etc etc keeps stacking up. Maybe someday. 
The electricity has to be generated somewhere and most comes from coal. The batteries have to be recycled and as of yet no real solution has been made for that. The problem is everyone is outta sight outta mind.

They built 84 last quarter and you’re calling that ahead of schedule? Lmao. You either are sipping the kool aid real hard or you don’t know what you’re talking about. 
"Hehe, couldn’t do any worse.

In the last 7 packages I’ve had delivered, or attempted to be delivered, 2 were delivered intact, 2 were damaged, 2 the drivers claimed they couldn’t find the place and 1 they didn’t leave a delivery notice.

Damaged goods I don’t necessarily blame the drivers for though.

The last 3 mentioned were especially annoying. There is a gigantic sign in front of the building with the street number on it. You’d have to be blind to miss it. 

And the lack of delivery notice one was really annoying... we were asked to call UPS but without a notice number they couldn’t help us. I did have the shipping invoice from the country it was sent from and by going through UPS’ website I was able to track down a UPS tracking number... but they couldn’t do that over the phone.

And their excuse for not leaving a delivery notice was because there was duty owed.

Really? You leave a message to call but you don’t leave us any information you need to actually help? 

UPS will always be my last choice for shipping anything... I know there’s good people there but my experience has been less than stellar. 

Downvote all you wish but... truth hurts sometimes.

Small robots with wheels
"Swaping is the only option, No way you can charge a truck in 15-30 minutes, that would require at least 0,5MW charger and that is impossible even in the near future."
"My BMW i3 takes 3 hours to charge for a total distance of around 75 to 80 miles according on traffic and that's charging at work on a level 2 charger.

At home, the charge takes 12 hours for a full charge. Distance is still around 75 miles average. "
Thank you for saying this. I worked for Amazon and spoke with drivers from ups often. If they took more than 2 minuets per delivery they would end up with having a 10 or more hour day. So they end up being pretty strict on time management because they are people too and have lives besides their jobs. 
But then wouldn't having to come back and re-deliver the package just end up adding to their backlog? Therefore their delivery schedule gets even worse.
"I recently received a parcel from a delivery service I hadn't heard of before (DPD in the UK) and they had a website where you can track the parcel with the driver's current location updated in real-time. Other delivery services here give really vague tracking info.

It also had an estimated time until your delivery which was pretty much spot on, so it definitely is a tight schedule and it makes sense because there are delivery options which allow you to state which time you specifically want your parcel delivered at."
Sounds like UPS and other delivery companies need to stop being cheap and hire lots more drivers/delivery people. 
"""act fast"".  im sitting on the couch in the living room.  knock and do your fucking job.  i stayed home all day.  you can give up 30 seconds *to do the job you are getting paid to do*."
"The ups and usps drivers in my area don't knock, they just put the sticker on the door. In fact I just caught them doing this yesterday because I was home and was looking out for them, the driver didn't even have my package in his hands just the sticker, he had to walk all the way back to his truck to get it"
Have had drivers completely ignore my deliveries and not even put a note on my door because I lived in a 2nd or 3rd floor apartment. This is also in Texas where apartment and stair access is all outside. They just saw the floor number and said nope.
"Thanks, useful answer. Could you explain when they say they tried deliver not home and I was home? And yes, i'm in small apartment with door right there, so no way missed knock. ( also might have been USPS ) And best wishes to you this time of year, see you guys out late!"

"Reading all these stories, made me think on my own experience and I can't relate at all.  

Pretty much every delivery service aside from the national post service always call before they deliver and ask if I will be home and what to do if I'm not.  

Some will call twice, first to arrange a time and second 5-15 minutes before they arrive so I can wait for them.  
I assume they call the next customer as soon as they are done with the last one."
"I mean in my area they definitely don't want to deliver the package. They put the sticker on the door quietly and *sprint* away from the door.

They do this even with that stupid ups account thing where you can configure your package options and ask for it to be left at the door and a note on the door asking for the package to be left.

I've chased them down a couple times but I have to wait by the window and intercept them if I really want the package.


Well, although I say ""they"" I'm fairly sure it's just one asshole who works this area."
">10 or 11 hour days.

i remember my first part time job"
"The other day, I was supposed to get a big TV thru UPS. Waited next to my phone the entire four hour window and it didn't show up. A few minutes later the online status said no one was home.

I suspect that the driver didn't even carry the TV from the truck, just the note (which is fine because TV is large, but why skip the knocking part?).

If you don't want to do ""lot's of work"", then don't work at UPS. I'm sure plenty people would love to earn $30 per hour.

Edit: by you I mean in general, not you because you don't work for UPS in the first place."
Yep it is usually 3 attempts even for ground service with signature requirement.
Um no. Ups is a union shop and they aren't gonna fire you for it. You will get a warning and eventually be fired if you keep it up. Even then you have a good shot at getting your job back. UPS is not fire happy. We actually try to keep everyone we hire. 
"Touché

"
Yes u/Kenriko is the CFO at UPS
touché can be called by an observer or judge.
Where do I send my expense report?
"Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other five?"
Because ups drivers have hundreds of packages each day and already have enough work without letting people know their package is coming in advance. I worked as a jumper part-time last year and we literally deliver 1 stop every 30 seconds to 1 minute or so in residential areas. 
"Because it isn't fuckin uber my dude. There's hundreds of packages on a truck and you're already pulling more than a full days work just dropping shit off. It's enough of a pain to sit there and write a slip, much less sick around on your phone and still have to write a slip. "
Well someone has to spoil all the fun ..
No you fucking idiot.
"It's fairly uncommon outside of the States from my understanding. The folks from Europe I've had this discussion with seem to indicate that package theft is a far bigger problem over there, so they typically will not just leave packages at the door."

Does it count if they leave a note on the door saying they tried and will come back later?
Not necessarily. FedEx orders 150 trucks from us (Volvo) every month.
I don’t see anything in the released documents.

hrmph, he fixed it Today 3 days after it was all over the internet.

Still, good that it got fixed.

"I'm not saying they won't deliver, I would bet on them delivering what they promise. 

I'm just saying to be cautiously optimistic and to *wait* before we start saying this is putting Tesla in a good situation. 

"
"If you give it an infinite end date, then there only way to ""not deliver"" is to die before doing it. Musk has a lot of things he still needs to deliver on, many of those are already late.

The stats if the semi almost seem unbelievable, so we will see if they are real or not. The one presentation that wasn't done by musk used a lot of "" we plan to"" like phases with the semi, indicating that the released statistics are more goals than current specs."
It's one thing to delay delivery on thousands of individual car orders.  It's an entirely different thing to delay deliveries on orders for $10M's in trucks.  I really hope Tesla figures out how to start building in mass quantities and deliver on time with the 3.
"I wholly agree with you in the grand scheme, but there have been some failures:

* Solar panels on all Superchargers 
* Battery swap in less time to fill a gas tank
* The Model S ownership cost at the price of a Ford Taurus 
* Model Y with next-gen wiring systems
* Model S with less maintenance than ICE (early Model S had very common 12V/DU issues)
* Third-party apps being approved for the car
* 700+HP claims on early P85 models (lawsuit forced them to change it)

Etc. most of these are on Google—if you can’t find them, let me know. I’m on mobile atm. "

They have never delivered as planned.  So that is just a stupid thing to say.

>only delivered 220 of its new, lower-priced Model 3 in the third quarter of 2017, a far cry from the 1,500 Model 3 deliveries the company projected for Q3 in August

>May financial call, Musk said he hoped for ""5,000 vehicles per week at some point in 2017""

"The Model 3. Supposed to have like 100k delivered by the end of the year and he's only delivered, what, like 10k.

How is he gonna build all these semis on top of all the Model 3s and Roadsters he's supposed to deliver?"

"Sounds like a marketing problem.

Could be pretty easily worked around by advertising how the electric engine has more torque/power from standing still and better acceleration.

'ICE are for pussies, real men drive the brawny tesla truck that could tear those weakass pieces of shit in half.'

Then design it to look badass and there you go job done."
"I would love a hybrid electric truck. I like the fact my Ecoboost gets more torque at a lower RPM than the 5.0 counterpart, makes towing easier. An electric motor would be even better. "
"which is I think what the new roadster is for.

changing that mindset.

"
You're forgetting all of the commerical sales. They almost never drive more than 200 miles/day as well so range doesn't need to be insane.
I was in the marked for an F-150 Raptor up until 6 months ago. The announcement of the Tesla pickup changed that. I need to haul and tow shit to construction sites which an all electric will do better than an ICE all day long. I could not care less how it sounds. 
"It’s changing fast though. I’m in Arkansas and a lot of “good ole boy” conservatives I know started talking about Tesla very positively after the semi unveiling. If they deliver it is gonna blow a hole through a lot of the arguments they have against electrics...ie “well that little electric go cart can’t haul anything or get any work done.”

A successful semi gives Tesla “street cred” for any future small truck because the only vehicles most southerners respect more than Ford, Chevy, and Dodge are Kenworth, Mack, and Peterbilt. And honestly I think they already would be working on one except as mentioned before they are the most sold vehicle and Tesla has production constraints just on their cars at this point. Once they can produce in volume they will surely build a pickup."
F150 driver here in Alabama. Sign me up for a stealth pickup
Why not? Electric cars are better on every way.
For tradesman a vehicle that can hold your tools and provide 110v without a generator is a win in the construction business.  
"I mean, many of my truck friend complain about the gas prices, but some just like the convenience of the truck bed/safety of the car. "
"Maybe not the kids buying F150s and 1500s but I miss being able to afford my diesel and would jump on a electric or hybrid diesel. 

Using my truck as a portable generator in the field or emergencies would be amazing."
"Look up Nikola NZT...it is a fully electric UTV and initial tests of it look awesome. It has instant torque, a motor for each wheel, can take ridiculous slopes. 

Yes, people who like big powerful pickups would like an electric pickup that is equal or better to the Ram, F-150, or Silverado. Imagine being able to go completely off grid with solar, wind, and battery systems at a house and a truck that you can charge from said house or from a portable solar array or wind generator."
"are those the guys who roll coal, wear the tighest pants they can, but call everyone else a queer?"
I don't think so unless they sell a 1/2 ton 4x4 pick up for around 40k. It'll probably be a lot more than that. If I was gonna spend 60k on a pick up it's gonna be 3/4 ton diesel fully loaded truck. I don't think Tesla can compete like that yet.
"I would love to see a Ford, Chevy, Dodge, Toyota and Nissan electric pickup as well. I hope they are all working on their own version"
"It isn't about the semi.

It's about the fuel for the semi."
It could be that the battery being used in the semi is only compatible with the semi design.
"Because he's going to be making a shit ton of money off commercial charging.

"
"But typically those companies that do could go profit positive or break even with some minimal adjustment. Amazon could raise prices, and begin to charge even more for prime, and unbundle some products. On the other hand, a company producing a product does not have that same luxury. "
Or see: tons of companies who went bankrupt
">They are a growing company and once they are large and have the cash flow of the larger companies it won't be such an issue.

Why? You still need to buy more land, set up more lines, hire more employees, etc... These are non-trival issues. 

>And something you forget is that Tesla is always updating their cars unlike other manufactures that have model years and start and stop a model year at a specific time. 

**Holy shit** the koolaid on this one."
Well what makes you say that? 125 preorders from 1 company isn't going to get them a lot of money.
They only get to make a lot of money if they make an actually cost effective vehicle and can actually deliver on time. 
"Even if electric trucks are so great that fleets start abandoning diesel trucks with significant useful life remaining (unlikely), it's only a one-time spike.  Ongoing sales are only a hundred thousand trucks per year at the absolute most.

There is a reason most auto manufacturers are not in the heavy duty truck business.  The market just isn't that big."
"Yeah, but the deposit is like 20,000 that you don't get back.

EDIT: Thanks, apparently I'm wrong."
"Current batteries are hundreds of times too expensive to sit fully charged for months, so that the energy can be used at the end. And there is not enough pumped storage potential to do that. And that period of storage is necessary for 100% coverage using renewables away from the equator. It will require chemical storage, either hydrocarbon storage, or some sort of flow battery. 
"
This is interesting I wonder how Tesla will address.  Maybe they buy time by speeding up pre/post driving checks and speed up hills?
Don’t they have to have a rest stop by law?
my guess would be a Tesla trailer with regen.
'em*
8-10 years ago ups tried in Ohio to have electric delivery vans. They hired a startup company that was supposed to retro fit their current vans so they could do small delivers runs. Unfortunately that company was run by a couple morons that employed only one electrical engineer and staffed the rest of their development department with university of Cincinnati students on co-op. Needless to say the company didn't get very far as they were just pulling parts from the shelf and modifying the truck around them. I think the trucks got something like 85 mile range if it didn't make stops. 
"Let’s be honest. A lot of people buying electric vehicles, most definitely Tesla buyers, aren’t doing it because they care for the environment. Electric vehicles are selling because they are finally getting better than gasoline vehicles. 

Positive environmental impact is a side effect of creating sustainable products that are desirable and save money. I’m typing this post underneath a solar panel covered roof in Arizona that my uncle installed merely because it would lower his electric bill. "
"[It found that propane use reduced GHG emissions by nearly 10%, and when derived as a by-product of natural gas production, propane reduced petroleum use by 98% to 99%.](https://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/propane_emissions.html)

So it seems it's also better for the environment."

"Actually this is probably the only way. I didnt consider it until you mentioned it. 

Tesla stock holders should be demanding this. I'm worried of my friends who believed Elon's company is worth $50,000,000,000 and dumped thousands into him. 

"
Why
"Less batteries gives lower, not higher acceleration. The decreased weight is more than offset by the reduced available power draw.

Think of it this way, you have a 2250kg car, of which 500kg is battery. That can output 500kw and gives you a 2.5 second 0-60/0-97 time. This is roughly the stats of a P100D.

If you halve the battery weight your car now weighs 2000kg, but has half the available power and slightly over half the range. 0-60/0-97 time is now more like 4.5 seconds.

Obviously it's not that simple since motors and structure weight will also decrease, but the point remains. 

I would expect the 500 mile range semi to have better acceleration, especially hauling full load, than the 300 mile range one."
"> You’ve calculated the chassis’s weight based on the acceleration numbers provided by Tesla 

That the Tesla Semi's weight is similar to trucks in its class [has also been confirmed by Tesla](https://electrek.co/2017/12/18/tesla-semi-test-program-partner-performance-specs-real/):

**""[...] and payload (similar to a typical diesel truck, as confirmed by Tesla)""**
"
"So a 45k load? ... Lol

15k-25k lbs tractor + 10k lbs trailer + 40-50k lbs load

"
"Of course there are outliers.  While I suspect the Tesla semi isn't targeted towards 47k long haul loads (but what do I know), I'm confident it could handle it.  My post was pointing out that most trucks on US highways are pulling loads that are less than 40k lbs."
also thanks for taking the time to break it down into detail ... definitely interesting
And? Its not like we have not seen a mountin of reports that it can do what they say. Of course it will be late (elon time) but that is expected.
"I don't get why people don't get this. I'd love for Tesla to succeed, but as of now most claims critics have made has pretty much turned out to be correct. "
Its different if you produce the future or the history. GM would have to  increase from aprox. 60.000 EVs. He will also decrease from 7.000k to 0 which costs.

Batteries are of course recycled. Nissan pay $1000 for old packs as they are valuable. They have high Nickel and Cobalt content you know.

In Europe, 30%? of your batteries must be recycled.

>The batteries have to be recycled and as of yet no real solution has been made for that.

Chemistry isn't magic, so I don't know the source of this misinformation. Do you frequent nutter sites?

"In the argument of time, I have seen some math trying to talk down the Tesla semi,  what people are missing is that with the incredible power these things have and no need for a traditional transmission,  they will save a shit load of time through out the course of a day in stop and go traffic.   When I am navigating traffic on rt 1 in New Jersey,  I always pick a lane with out semi trucks.  If I hit a light behind a semi truck my acceleration time is cut in half due to a.

"I feel so bad for UPS drivers sometimes. The other day, a guy dropped off a package at my house at 9:30pm and looked exhausted. Must have had such a long day full of deliveries. Always be friendly to your delivery guy!"
I'm so glad this would be illegal in my country
You might want to clarify that doesn't mean they can spend 2 minutes hanging out on the doorstep waiting.  
"I worked as a supervisor as I was going through school, talked to some of the people in charge of timing the routes, the time allotted per stop(from when the engine stops, to when it starts again), is 2 minutes, no matter the package or location. This assumes that they walk to/from the truck, because jogging or running is unsafe. 

I timed the walk from the end of my driveway, to the door, and by the time I hit the bell, 30 seconds had gone by. This means if they had the package in hand when they stopped, they could wait exactly 60 seconds before walking off. 

Ever since, I've walked out to meet the driver halfway, as he taps his horn as he's pulling up. "
I gotta wonder if UPS determines that this repetitive skipping of packages is somehow still worth it versus lowering the quota and penalizing non-delivered packages more.
1min 59 seconds getting the package and bringing it to my door. 1 sec waiting for a door to be answered.
"Ok, but how does it take more than 2 mins to carry my package to the door? Seems like filling out the note would take longer anyway"
They're terrible people that don't knock on my door when they try to deliver.
"yes and no.  Not saying this is always the case.  Imagine I have an hour untill my pickups that take me 10 min to drive to the first place from you neighborhood.  So I have 50 min of delivery time.  And my next resi area is on the opposite side of my pickups. Say your neighborhood has 25 stops.  That is 2 min a stop before I have to break and do my pickups.  I figured I have enough time to finish those up.  Now say a few of those houses cost me 5 min instead.  Now I have to break with say 5 houses left instead of finishing your neighborhood  So instead of heading to my other resi after my pickups I have to drive all the way back to your neighborhood to finish those last 5 stops now in rush hour.  Then break back to the neighboorhood on the other side of my picks that I was going to start right after my pickups.  So that is minimum 20min of extra drive time because I wasted time waiting for people.  This could cost me 30-45 min of my day because I fell behind.  Now Im 45 min behind and I wont make it to the building in time for air to be dropped off yo get on the planes.  So I have to scheduel a driver meet to give him my air which will cost me another 15-20 min.  So now im an hour behind.  guess what its now dark outside and I cant read peoples addresses so before when I could to 25-30 an hour it slows down to 15-20 an hour.  Now all the sudden my 10 hour day just turned into a 12-13 hour day because I let myself get behind. So because I waited at a few houses a few extra minutes I lost 2 hours of my day.  so technically yes I have to come back tomorrow, but that will only cost me 2 extra min, which is better then 2 hours.    


tldr: think butterfly effect one small thing can cause much bigger things later down the road.  "
"It gets calculated into that day's schedule. The driver's aim is to meet his schedule, not to makes things more efficient overall. It's not his (or her) choice."
"Idk how UPS works in the States but in Canada undelivered packages for residential addresses are (sometimes) re-attempted same day (Near the end of your working day, barring time constraints) or 99% of the time are dropped off at the nearest UPS store and the costumer can come pick it up. The odd time we get a call for a re-delivery for something dropped at a UPS store, usually due to an elderly and/or handicapped customer being unable to get to the store. Non-deliveries for commercial addresses are just re-attempted the next day until delivered, or sometimes neighboring business are nice enough to accept a package for them and they pick it up whenever they can."
"It's a safety concern for the drivers. They get robbed too much already in bad areas. 

They also don't like mgmt tracking their every move and coming down on them when they make a wrong turn or take a longer route. "
It’s a German company. DPD stood for Deutscher Paketdienst (German Parcel Delievery). About 10 years ago they changed it to Dynamic Parcel Distribution.
"UPS does that here in the US, too. It's really nice, the driver doesn't even have to get out of the truck and has a few extra seconds to chat. All around improvement since it started. The estimated window is around 45 minutes for me, though, because on his normal route he gets around my block pretty close to the time he has to immediately drop everything and head to a scheduled pickup that's daily and that he needs to be precisely on time for"
"Great idea but most of the time its bullshit and you wait because you trust the estimated time but the given accuracy fools you. The settings on the website are good though; naming a neighbour to deliver to or leaving note of where to leave the package (garage, door etc). "
"Worst I've had was through USPS. It was raining, so they didn't even bother to get out of the truck, just marked it as undeliverable due to ""no access to delivery location"" and moved on. I only knew because it was Amazon, and Amazon gave me a shipping update. They didn't leave me a slip or anything. 

I lived in a house. With a covered porch. And a driveway. And no fence/gate. It was *not* blocked, because I was at home and know it wasn't (the only thing that could even have arguably blocked access would have been a very large delivery truck, which definitely wasn't there). "
"And you can't even complain, because then your next package might get damaged ""in transit""."
"I can't say every driver is going to follow the rules 100% of the time.  We try to hold people accountable when we can,  but they will use a lot of time saving tricks if they can. 

If they have heavy packages, they don't want to lug them to the door and back of nobody will answer, so they'll buzz with nothing in their hands, but if you answer,  they'll hold the door and quickly run back to get their cart. 

Good drivers will sometimes buzz apts until they can get inside since that's usually the only barrier. But again this takes some extra time and they are being closely monitored by their op specialists electronically so they don't want to lose time.  

If they truly aren't buzzing and you have seen them not making attempts,  then they aren't working properly and you should get in contact with your  UPS center about it. 

Cheers!"
"Many times they do that so they are not lugging a package that weighs as much as they do back and forth. 

If it was small that makes no sense since he would need to scan or at least make sure it was in his truck. The part that sucks is locating it on the truck.  He would need to write on the package DIRT and an info notice taking more time."
I don't get even knocks or stickers sometimes. Just a notification through the app that they allegedly tried to deliver but couldn't (even though I was home and had already gave consent for them to leave the package through the app).
"I drive peak for UPS, and this makes no sense. I'd at least ATTEMPT to get the thing off my truck so I don't head out with it the next day. 

One address on my route, I go 4 blocks off route to get her to sign at her office nearly every day, because she's constantly ordering furniture and I don't want to mess with dragging it around 2 days in a row.

For heavy packages I'll go knock and ring before bringing the package, though. I had a 4 wheeler on my truck yesterday. No way I'm getting that off just to put it back on. My system is ring bell, knock, look around side / back, ring /knock again, start filling out notice, knock a final time as I leave. Total time is about 2 minutes, but I did 398 packages today. I don't have 10 mins at each stop."
"USPS delivers to the mailbox. They have 600 other addresses to hit in your neighborhood. If your apt has a mailbox at the door then they should leave the package at your door which is not recommended for an apt complex. If it's a signature required delivery then there should be a notice in your box.if you use the large arrow boxes with a bunch of slots you should have a key to the package container at the bottom. If the package doesn't fit then there should be a notice asking you to come to the post office to pick it up.

Also for USPS Google USPS informed delivery. You can see what mail is coming to your house everyday before it gets there."
"Like I said above,  usually they fill out the infonotice and they are gone. They buzz quick and a lot of the time buzzers are shorter on the receiving end than the button press. Apartments are the worst place to deliver because most of the time drivers don't want packages to get stolen  because then they have to do twice as much extra work trying to find the package the same day or the next day. 

If you aren't getting your packages delivered at your location, go into your UPS Center and ask them if there is a high security rating on your location.  We won't ever leave packages at high risk locations because nobody likes stolen packages and it's  more of a problem than you think. 

If that's not the issue and your driver is being a little *too quick* try leaving signed notes.  Drivers will *usually* take the note and leave the package if the package itself isn't an in-person-required-signature. 

Other times you might be the only person in the Apt that they are delivering to for the day.  If they buzz quick and can't get in to a secured building within filling the infonotice out,  then they leave, unless they want to roll the dice by leaving the packages by the mailboxes if they are there.  (They aren't the PO, so they don't have keys to leave them in your box).

Lastly,  use UPS MyChoice to let your local dispatch know where,  and how, you want your pkgs left at your location.  This helps immensely.  

Happy Holidays!"
"I hope you have a better future than it seems you've had a past. 

Happy holidays"
Wrote a response to a similar comment. Usually they don't want to lug around large boxes if they don't know if they'll get an answer.
What about the other times you received orders from UPS? Were those delivered on time?
"Hub I worked at had guys that had been fired 4 or 5 times.  Management regularly fired drivers who in their opinion didn't really do anything wrong, or the circumstances were beyond their control...but had to fire them anyways because the order came from higher up to fire someone to keep everyone on their toes."
en garde
[Relevant old commercial.](https://youtu.be/8EpFI9d8p-c)
It still doesn't fit here. Where was the opposing side?
An app could notify automatically using GPS.
True. I've been doing temp work for them and they just said to try and make the package not visible from the road. I'm sure it stop happens but it's not very frequent over here.

Lol no. He’s just saying the increments in this pissing contest of preorders have been in 25. But some have been in 10 and 5 as well. So I guess the number has to be divisible by 5. 
"Oh no, I meant in the ""bidwar"". :)

I sure Tesla would be willing to sell just one Truck, if you really have the heart to ask that of them."

I think tesla is missing out some by not doing a yard tractor. He'll it doesn't even need to have that long of range. 100 miles and it would probably never run out under normal usage. 
Can't disagree.
"Cautious optimism didn't get Elon Musk anywhere. He took big risks and that's why he's succeeding everywhere.

Cautious optimism is a phrase a lot of people use on Reddit because it sounds like the always even headed way of thinking, but it doesn't make it the right way of thinking for making decisions."
"While your statement has merit, I'm confident they'll be on their feet for 2019 (when the truck was announced to start being produced) because *hopefully* the Gigafactory 1 will be up and running."
"One of the most important stats you can have for a semi-truck is its empty weight, this basically defines how much cargo you can pack in to it and thus how much money it can make you per trip.

Musk skirted around this stat intentionally, it might have been because they're still trying to improve their battery energy density or if the empty weight of the truck is genuinely bad. Either way, it's suspicious as fuck that he skirted around this point when it's one of the most important things you can know about a truck. "
"Your comment doesn't really address anything I said. All it says is a long version of what I said. They might deliver late, but they haven't not delivered on pretty much everything they have promised to. What about the stats are not believable?"
"thousands? Try hundreds of thousands. [Only 500/500,000 reservations have been delivered as of November](https://electrek.co/2017/11/09/tesla-model-3-production-numbers/). That's barely 0.1%."
">Deliver on time with the 3

Pretty sure the on-time thing has already passed."
"It's one thing to be late to deliver cars to consumers for them to drive to the grocery store and to work. 

It's another thing to be late to deliver to businesses who's cashflows take the operational costs of the Tesla semi into account.

UPS and Tesla most likely signed operational cost guarantees along with delivery date guarantees with associated financial penalities associated with the missing of each.

"
"Yes, and as I mentioned before, lots of the parts are shared, so they already exist in bulk since they are building the 3. So they will be aware of any issues well before they start making the Semi."
"I dunno, the city delayed the permitting for our amazon fulfillment center for 11 months and its waaaaaassy more money than a batch of model 3s."
I've been wondering if the model 3 deliveries was due to getting ready to deliver the trucks.
"> ~~It's an entirely different thing to delay deliveries on orders for $10M's in trucks.~~

Edit: 
>I really hope Tesla figures out how to start building in mass quantities and deliver on time with the 3.

Why do you say this? I wouldn't have thought a truck is much different to manufacture than a car. It's a decade or so since I've been really close to a truck but then they were simpler than cars in a lot of ways.

Edit: ffs people, I'm just asking a question."
"> Model S selling at the price of a Ford Taurus

That's not what they said. This is what they said:

>If you account for the much lower cost of electricity vs. gasoline at a likely future cost of more than $5 per gallon, the Model S is equivalent to a gasoline car with a sticker price of about $30,000, such as a Ford Taurus, Honda Accord or even a Toyota Avalon or BMW 3-Series."
There's also the gigafactory being behind schedule
There are solar panels at the Kettleman supercharger station.
Model Y isn't even in production yet?
"A bunch of these are silly. Solar Panels on all superchargers? I live in the PNW,  solar panels are largely a waste of time in some areas, a windmill maybe.  Model S ownership cost, not MSRP. $2 in electric per month vs $200, $2500 per year. 8 years of car ownership adds $20,000 to the cost of the cheaper car, in fuel. Let alone other maintenance costs. I'd say it isn't far off the cost of a Taurus at $28,000. "
"Comment taken back - fair points were made in responses and the formatting was fixed.

~~Battery swap wasn't a failure... it was a business decision not to proceed, based on the fact no one actually gave much of a shit about it.~~

~~I gave up reading your comment after that because holy formatting batman.~~"
"accidental S2000 reference received, thank you."
When did they give a definitive date? Because I don't remembering them doing that.
"I would short the Tesla stock(because it seems like a no-brainer), but crypto is doing too good.

Tesla is valued at 50B, but makes 100k vehicles/year.

Major investors will withdraw, fanboys will be left with a dead company."
"It is delivering. First of all, they said it would be impossible, to start sales when they did, and they did. Second of all they make good margin on their cars, they are reinvesting it. Wait until they've caught up to their spending. It's not delivering if they say we're going to make a car and they don't. They are behind schedule, so what. When is the last time you caught a bus or anything on time? I am a Tesla fan boy, but I know how to look at things objectively, and they are ramping up, behind schedule, but people are getting their cars. Next time you want to complain about everything being on time, I'd suggest you ask yourself if you've ever been late on anything."
"What? They've delivered roadsters, S, X, and now 3. What are you talking about?"
Autonomous coast to coast by the end of 2017. 
"Yeah... that falls under the ""late"" not ""never"" category."
They never gave a date that has passed. So they haven't failed. Your expectations are not anything Tesla promised.
"Why do you think they are ordering only a few and not an entire fleet, but this goes back to my other point of having many shared parts, and production should go much smoother."
"Umm, there's many signed of ramping up, You clearly haven't been on this sub in the last few weeks."
Behind schedule sure we’ve established that. I said it in my own comment. But they are delivering. So not sure what you’re trying to point out.
"> The Model 3. Supposed to have like 100k delivered by the end of the year and he's only delivered, what, like 10k.

Actually [it's much less than that](https://electrek.co/2017/11/09/tesla-model-3-production-numbers/). Tesla has only delivered 500 Model 3s as of November.

"
The semi is in 2019. What does deliveries of the 3 right now have to do with what I said? The same parts from the Model 3 will have been in the wild for years on many cars before the Semi is even built. The parts sharing will make the Semi much easier to build.
"Supposed to have 100k Model 3s delivered by the end of the year? What?

You do know the original plan started production in 2018, right? They’re ahead of schedule. "
"How are you stating they've failed? It was called a ramp up. They are ramping up. Failed would have them announcing, no Model 3s. Please explain how they've failed. They've even said it was impossible to start producing them when they did actually start."
Q3 2016 disagrees with you and another quarter before that too.
It is.
"https://xkcd.com/774/

No tag backs."
"Yea, I drive a full size truck because nothing beats the convenience of a truck bed for surfing/off road toys and when I used to haul around my drums (while still fitting 5 adults in the cab) .  If I could do that without the gas costs that would be fantastic!"
"Yes but it's a bit harder than that.  Masculinity is generally associated with being sweaty, dirty and working with your hands which Tesla is most definitely not. 

Tesla's perception is all about brains vs. brawn (Silicon Valley vs. Detroit) which can't be changed just by showing how Tesla can outperform ICE cars. 

Even within pickup trucks, you won't see many Japanese trucks at construction sites for the same reason.

Maybe Tesla needs to promote how it's the only pickup truck that can be powered by pure, black American coal.

One thing that Tesla has going for it in pickup trucks is the ability to deliver high amperage electricity to drive things like saws and other electrical tools. "
But how can I inhale them fumes then!
">Then design it to look badass and there you go job done.

I'll get right on it"
Chevy had a hybrid Silverado out for about 5 minutes.  I think I've only ever seen one on the road.  If the demand exists it wouldn't be hard for automakers to produce them.  Wouldn't be hard for Toyota to put Highlander Hybrid drivetrain into a Tacoma.
"I'm in your camp.  Was thinking the other day that fleet sales, especially gov't fleets, were a no-brainer.  (Presumably the folks at Tesla have brains, so there's something I'm missing.)  But here in Chicago I look at all of these Department of Business Affairs sedans, Department of Water pickups, etc. and wondering ""why aren't those 100% electric?""  "
This is why I don't get Toyota's hydrogen strategy. Why compete head to head with small electric cars when you could own the hydrogen truck market and make it foolish for electrics to follow you for that exact reason?
"A 60k Tesla truck will be more equivalent to a 40k ICE truck when factoring total cost of ownership though.

The price gap can be much larger than with cars because trucks have higher operating costs, specifically fuel."
"It also might be about boosting the relative margins for the batteries.  If the semi is just using a larger batch of the standard battery that everything else is using.  Then they've found a way to drive larger unit sales creating a better volume discount.

So it might be about growth in profit due to higher volumes.  I'm assuming the battery packs are one place where they can drive down costs more easily by selling more products with batteries in it.  Much easier than creating totally new revenue streams."
"Oh, I see how it meets the mission, agreed.  I just think that the mission can't take precedence over solvency, so either they're all in on the mission even at the cost of solvency, or they a)have some battery breakthroughs they're confident will be ready in ~2yrs or b) they're really confident in the output of the Gigafactory not being a constraint at all.

*Edit: unless you meant profits from fueling, which can work eventually. I concede the point."
"It shouldn't matter. It's still a bunch of lithium ion batteries (same batteries as in your smartphone) glued together, just a lot more of them."
Ehhh..to be seen. There's a lot of infrastructure capital expenditure to get to a profit on 7c/kWh.
"Sony and other electronic companies did this in the 90's as well, IIRC.


So its not without precedent. You just have to have the capital to survive long enough that the market position is firm enough that you can raise prices again without people switching back.

I imagine the price on these vehicles is a lot more than a stereo or tv, however. So i dont expect Tesla to take losses on the sale. But i wouldnt be surprised if the margins were razor thin.

Setting a precedent is huge for new technology. You show people how efficient and safe the transition is and they will flock in droves to it."
"Sure, twist my words. I said It's a huge task. And I said AFTER they wouldn't be issues and I like koolaid."
Did you not see the amount of other preorders they have? And these are all trials. Imagine when UPS and others validate their testing and order their entire fleet from Tesla.
That's a given. Shouldn't have to be stated.
Nope. It doesn't happen over night. That's not how fleets work.
"Tesla usually does multiple phases

* Reservation
* Configuration
* Confirmation
* Build
* Delivery

The reservation fee is fully refundable. The deposit required at confirmation/build is not refundable.

Now the founders edition reservations of $200,000 each are non refundable. But I have no reason to believe that the $20,000 is since production hasn't started."
Reservations are 100% refundable.
"They could swap cabs at each load/unload station, and alternate which truck is charging for every trip. "
It's not just on Tesla. Sometimes you have to come up with a new plan for your project when you get a cool new tool.
"Probably just swap the entire truck to a new one with charge, or swap batteries. Like a relay race.
"
They'll add up smaller backup batteries to the front end of the trailers that the semi can hook up for that extra range. I'm saying this out of my ass but it ain't such a bad idea. 
After 11-13 hours of driving.
"Admittedly, I don't know much about the technology but I would imagine fleets could swap batteries out rather easily at pickup/drop off stations."
10 year old Battery / electric car tech and college interns?  I can't imagine why it failed.  
I love your pragmatism.
"Loblaw was not at 285, according to your link. Tesla was:

> Canadian firms, including retailer Loblaw Cos Ltd, have been among the first to pre-order Semi trucks from **Tesla**, which **has at least 285 reservations in hand, according to a Reuters tally as of Dec. 12**."

"Available cash is already a problem with tesla, adding a mega line to manufacturing will need a boat load of cash. Maybe have a separate stock deal.  "
"> ing about the Tesla trucks that’s missed out in the presentation which is the weight of the actual truck INCLUDING the batteries! This is important to know as it will determine the weight of the haul it can carry according to the highway codes. You’d imagine the weight of shipment a truck can carry is of absolute importance to a shipping company like UPS so either they know something that’s left out for the public or they don’t care and just did this for carbon emission balancing etc.

Anything over 40k of cargo would place the vehicle overweight and would require special permitting, but yeah your math is about right.

Source : Work in logistics. "
"Are you confused or something? Max legal weight is 80000 lbs. Even with tractor, trailer, and fuel you can easily haul a 40-45000 lb load. And I have many times."
Freight has many complex mechanisms but the profitability is a common goal. None can afford it if the truck eats into profits. 
"No sources, just your made up opinions. But sure keep believing the hype that electric cars are gonna save the world and stop pollution. Just a longer tail pipe. Now back to your basement you troll!"

Very true tell him he does a great service for everyone during the holidays and any other day he goes to work. He is Santa to a lot of kids around this time of year. 
"Drivers make a great salary though. Starting around here is about $65k, median income is 50k, the average is 38k. It just takes a while to become a driver."
"Work for UPS. I do preload then take a delivery truck and bang out local residential, some business, and about 7 pick ups a day.

Just clocked 12:00 and was told we can't go over that. Been that way since the beginning of peak."
"I noticed that most delivery drivers seem to be roided up bros, whereas the fat ones, 5 foot tall females, etc. work at the substations.  Where you have to go to get your UPS packages if you have a 9 to 5 job and away from home during those hours..."
"My work uses a courier company where they fired all their delivery people and rehired them as third party contractors. They get paid a fixed rate per package, another per delivery location, and a third fixed rate per kilometer driven. ""It's up to you how long your days are!"", they're told, but in reality they are often working from 5am to 4pm, every day. Sucks for them."
"2 minutes per delivery, but im pretty sure that includes driving time. "
"The trucks delivering your packages door to door are not semi's that UPS put on pre order. The semi's won't change anything with faster acceleration. If anything, if they laid into on every takeoff, it would take much longer to unload since everything in the trailer would like it's been through an earthquake that got hit by a tornado. "
"Acceleration time doesn't matter in traffic.  In fact, it likely makes it worse for the people behind you.

It's much better to leave some distance so you can go a constant 10 or 20 mph than it is to do 35 for five seconds and then break again.

https://youtu.be/L45HwjzMu0g?t=35"
That’s very true and that’s why I’m glad to see companies start reservations on these trucks.
This is a great point. I commute on a 4 lane highway that has lights and turn offs. All the cars immediately switch to the fast lane when a light approaches if there are trucks because through the town areas with more lights the trucks have to use the left lane. 
What's ups dogs?
Given as a reference typically it takes up to 5 or more per package given that they have to unload the package and walk to the door. The whole thing about my post is that they are strict on time management and if someone doesn’t answer the door in about 30 seconds they leave a note. It also depends on the package and it’s size because most of the time they will leave it if it small enough to hide behind a pillar/plant. 
I always meet the driver when I’m expecting a package never knew it was an enforced time wow.
"Its 2 minutes for the entire process, beginning from when they stop the engine, seatbelt, bulkhead door, ~~select~~ find the package, walk to the door while scanning the package, knock, wait for the person to answer, get the signature, ask them to spell the last name, walk back to the truck while looking at the address for the next stop, seatbelt, start the engine, and off to the next.

This doesn't include time taken to drive to the beginning of the route or back at the end of the day. 250 stops at 2 minutes per stop is already over 8 hours. During the holidays it's 10x worse because you can have 350+ stops.

  I say 10x worse because 350 stops is way too many packages to fit in a truck so it often becomes similar to looking for a single ball in a ball pit, where your truck is literally filled bottom to top, side to side with packages. There is a lot of emphasis on truck organization and package selection in training which can cut down the most time overall for many drivers. Some of it is legit silly like only stepping into the back of the truck with one foot instead of both, and some advice is actually practical, like coming in 20 minutes early to organize your truck and familiarize yourself with which stops you'll have that day.

I'm sure there are some drivers who can chime in with their stories about only having 100 delivery stops a day but needing to use elevators or stairs, bulk stops where you spend way too much time looking for the 17th of 17 packages when the first 16 were all clumped together, having a split route where the second half of the day is pick ups and the old lady forgot to print the shipping label but she'll be right back for the fourth time this week, the apartment complex with 200 units that only counts as one stop on your route, the guy who runs a home business who ships 13 60 lb boxes from his mansion at the top of his winding driveway that is far too narrow to drive a truck up so you have to use a hand cart 4 times to get all of the boxes, etc. but you get the general idea."
"If we're close, sure. I'd rather get it off an empty truck then drag it back out the next day.

My normal route is split. I have a 15 minute drive in between the two routes, so I never end back up in the area unless I missed something."
"I'm a seasonal driver, and my route is entirely apartments developments in the suburbs. The normal drivers for that route give me a knowing laugh every time they see me, because they know it sucks.

It was a vita game so the package weighed less than 5 lbs. Dude was walking away before he even finished knocking. 
"I had this so many times that I just have everything delivered to work. It is signed for and in a secure location where I can go pick it up at the end of the day on my way home or it is delivered to my desk. If it is bulky or going to be a pain in the ass, I always email the guy that usually brings it to not bother and that I will pick it up to not put him out either."
"Most things I just authorize the release online so they leave it at the door and there's no issue. But for packages that are more valuable or identify the product, I don't authority release and delivery has been hit or miss unfortunately"

I think the cummins electric drive train is going to take the yard dog market. It'll have 100 miles of range and be able to be dropped into existing chassis/cab combinations.
But can you agree?
"You can take big risks while being cautiously optimistic. Further, a fan can be cautiously optimistic while the company is taking big risks.  "
"I completely agree. The closest answer we have about the weight is from another presentation about the semi from a Tesla employee. I think the presentation was in Europe. All he really said though was that they plan to make it weigh the same as a diesel semi, which doesn't say a lot."
"How can he not deliver using your logic though? With your logic, either he has already delivered or he will deliver within the next 40 or so years. The only way he can fail to deliver is to die or for Tesla to go bankrupt. My point is, it's pointless to say he ""always delivers even if it's years late"".

The amount of battery needed to get the stats he claims seems like it would be much heavier and much more expensive than the current specs."
As of October. The number in the article is from October.
The model 3 isn't supposed to be manufactured in large quantities until next year. One parts supplier slowed down the ramp up but they should still hit their targets for next year.
But will they fixed those issues? Right now the new tesla cars have the same issues the old tesla cars had.
"No. Trucks aren't even close to being delivered. 

Model 3 delays are due to mass production issues like body panel stamping, etc. "
Officially it was because of the giga factory being built.
"Customers are different. Even if they delay, the number of cancellations they're going to experience on the cars isn't all that bad.

Compare that to someone like Fedex, who is entirely capable of ordering millions of dollars worth of trucks in a go and just as capable of leaving or pitching a fit if you try to tell them they're going to have to wait six months to a year for new trucks. A lot of customers will deal with it, companies placing multimillion dollar orders have a reasonable expectation of not having to put up with that shit."
"That's also a lie. Electric cars have notoriously poor salvage value, so whatever you save in gasoline you lose in resale value."
Assuming the price of gas is going to more than double in the near future and stay there is a pretty huge logic jump and creates a bit of a misconception for anyone just taking statements like that at face value.

"It's way behind dude, they are nowhere near producing the numbers they claimed they would be at this time. That is a failure, and people are doubting if they can even meet their shifted 2018 goals. Creating a few cars is different than producing hundreds of thousands."

"> Supposed to have 100k Model 3s delivered by the end of the year? What?

Per Musk at the Q1 2016 financial call:

>“So as a rough guess, I would say we would aim to produce 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s in the second half of next year. That’s my expectation right now.”

...

>They’re ahead of schedule.

Which schedule?  My original delivery estimate was Nov-Jan.  I don't see that happening at all."
">Ahead of schedule

Since when has Tesla ever been ahead of schedule?"
"„The original plan“

So if Tesla just threw out 100 different timelines would you just accept the one it fits best?

They updated their timeline as they sold their cars, thats the plan. No one cares what „the original plan“ was."
"> They’re ahead of schedule.

LOL
"
But the plan changed a new schedule was given and now they're behind.
"Please read next time- ""They haven't failed""

I couldn't have been more clear in my post.  Move along."
Good catch. Although the broader point still stands...just have to use 6 or 12 month increments instead of quarters. 
"Cant really count a quarter were they only made profit because they sold all their collected ZEV credits.

It was not an operating profit."

"I use a large truck for work, and a few problems I could see with EV trucks:

1. Weight.. trucks need weight to resist wobbling when hauling, and adding unnecessary weight just to accomplish this would hurt the range... IC engines are heavy as fuck and do a great job by themselves...

2. Durability, we have developed truck transmissions to handle substantial abuse (See: youtube stump removal w/ truck), and separated the abuse from the expensive parts... I know that EV's don't have typical transmissions so this could be a big problem alone... 

3. Range, we are decades off from an EV truck being able to match a normal truck w/ a auxiliary gas tank... Like all the alberta oil drilling trucks.. (which to be fair, are disappearing as the market dies)"

"Yes, because they require much more power and torque. This will this require a much stronger electric motor, and a much larger battery pack, further increasing cost. "
"My thoughts:

If Tesla has a real proof of concept, money will not matter (Alphabet/Apple).

America alone: estimated 15.5 million ""trucks"" on road. Estimated 3.6 million class 8. (Trucking.org)

Tesla claims 80% of truck routes are viable.

Let's say they're wrong and it's only 50%

That's 1.8 million trucks.

SpaceX has taken plurality of global orbital launches in 10 years, Tesla has taken #1 EV sales in 10 years. I think it's safe to assume Tesla can earn 10% market share.

10% of 1.8 million trucks = 180,000 trucks.

Seems reasonable, right?

Let's say every other day each of those 180,000 trucks fills up 40% at a megacharger for .07 per KWh. That's $35 per every other day per truck.

180,000 trucks x $35 x 365 / 2 = 1.15 billion dollars per year.

To do this, need solar panels (Tesla makes those), batteries (Tesla makes those, and chargers (Tesla makes those).

Over 1 billion per year autonomous, minimal overhead, material free (sun does not have accounts receivable) if just 10% of half of the trucks in America that fit target market alone use mega chargers to fill less than half every other day.

Now image if I wasn't conservative in every measurement and used the globe's trucking fleet.


"
"His point is that tesla plans to make money on the commercial charging facilities for the semi more so than the semi sales itself. If a company orders say 100 vehicles, chances are good they will want one or more megacharger facilities installed which tesla then builds and maintains earning on every charge their semis use while expanding the charger infrastructure for their other vehicles at the same time (highly unlikely any megachargers except those right at factory loading areas won't also have superchargers)"
"Yeah, people forget that Tesla isn't just about their cars, they're in the energy market."
"You're not thinking long term like Elon does.

"
Nope
Then why do you do vehemently ignore their track record of not being able to do so in this thread? 
"I really have NO idea what you are trying to say.  There are only ~250,000 trucks produced per year.  Period.  This is the size of the market.  Even if they put everyone else out of business and become the heavy duty truck monopoly, it's absolutely impossible to sell more than about $30 billion worth of trucks per year in North America."
"Looks better when you can say ""we have x thousand orders on the books"" "
I won't argue because I know absolutely nothing about Tesla or it's policies but the original comment about pre ordering 1000 and then cancelling if it's a dud to hold their place in line if it works goes against  common business practise. If you're actually holding a spot then there are costs for cancelling in most situations.  Once again I know nothing about Tesla but it seems odd that you could cancel a 1000 unit order without penalty. 
"I know a few people who do these runs.  A lot of the ""trailer switching "" runs are done in a parking lot next to the highway."

"Yes, my first thought about this was that this would be ups trucks for ground transport between states/city’s no local delivery.  And if you assume that drivers will lay into every acceleration I could take a guess that you would be wrong and they would be unemployed for delivering damaged products.   Have you ever been behind a semi on a long steep grade?  The time and speed lost in each shift is substantial.   But with a single non changing gear, they could greatly eliminate those moment of deceleration."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/83xdmg/tesla_semi_acceleration_video/?st=JEQ5O8O5&sh=d4ef04cd



This is how acceleration will count,  other semis would literally stop traffic here."
"The video states that the traffic jam doesn’t alleviate until enough cars have cleared from the front of the jam.   If you have a vehicle like a semi that doesn’t accelerate at the same rate as the vehicles in the other lanes,  that lane will stay jammed longer.   Not to mention that video doesn’t take into consideration vehicles changing lanes because of trucks being in their lane and wanting to be in a quicker moving lane.   I understand the fluid physics here,  but they are considering every vehicle with the same acceleration rate.  Make one one with all vehicles having variable accelerations,  you might see an increase in clearing or a decrease depending on the difference in the average acceleration rates of the vehicles as a group.  
"

Oh nothing much.
"I can tell you that waiting 30 seconds *only* happens if the driver is >98% sure someone will be coming to the door, otherwise it's knock and run.  They can't just chill out given the workload.

As for leaving larger items, it's done millions of times a day.  As long as the space is safe enough and no history of packages swiped, they'll often leave it.

I make sure our couriers know the safe and concealed spots to drop stuff, give them the occasional soda or brownie and it's all good.

"It's an ""average"", because they assume some people will be waiting for their package, some apartment complexes will let you deliver 4-5 packages in one stop, etc, but some will take you 5 minutes or so, because it's some exercise equipment, or a desk, etc. 

I worked mostly in the building as a loader, in that position, you have somewhere around 7-9 seconds to pickup, scan, and place the package, in order to hit your numbers, and here they scrutinize these numbers, so if you're taking longer than 10-11 seconds on average, they will likely fire you. This is why most packages get damaged, that and belt jams. The rule of thumb that I've given is pack your stuff to the point that you could drop it onto concrete from about chest height without worry, and it'll probably be safe.

Our route isn't split however, except for about a 10 minute drive to the UPS Store at the end of the day."

"Great points but I actually think that EVs are well suited to meet the first two. 

First, EVs that have comparable range to ICEs are heavier than their ICE counterparts due to the weight of their batteries - which is more than an ICE engine block.  However, the nice thing is that the weight can be distributed better than ICE vehicles (at axle level) to better reduce tipping and wobbling. 

Next, sealed brushless motors really have no wear components so under extreme conditions, they aren't subject to dust and metal particulates that wind up in engine oil and transmission fluid.  Now, generally reliability of electric motors probably isn't as advanced as ICE just due to history/experience but that is rapidly improving.  Also replacement of failed components on an EV is much, much simpler than with an ICE. 

Yes, range is a problem especially given weather conditions so you'll probably never see an battery electric vehicle deployed in a use case where it needs to travel 1,000 miles between points in sub zero weather.  However, there may be an electric future with hydrogen fuel cells. Who knows. "
"I still think there's a place for hydrogen, but it's construction equipment, planes, and trains. Big things that would need gigantic batteries if they were full electric. But it's silly to think anyone would want a hydrogen compact."
"Well the cars are already at 920 ft-lbs of torque so it’s not going to be much of a problem.

Seems reasonable. Thanks for the write-up.
"A few details with your argument I feel I need to criticize.

> SpaceX has taken plurality of global orbital launches in 10 years, Tesla has taken #1 EV sales in 10 years. I think it's safe to assume Tesla can earn 10% market share.

The issue I have here is in relating Space X's plurality of global launches with Tesla's plurality of EV sales to conclude that Tesla can earn 10% market share of all Semi trucks both EV and non EV. Since we're talking about Tesla electric Semi trucks replacing non-electric semi trucks just as SpaceX reusable rockets are replacing non-reusable rockets, it is more correct to compare Tesla EVs replacing non-EVs. Unfortunately when you look at it that way, Tesla has <1% market share considering that EVs make up only ~1% of all autos (US).

I think other arguments could be made but these alone don't logically nor conservatively lead to a safe assumption of 10% market share.

That aside from likening it to the assumption that 60% of an apple + 1% of an orange = 10% of a mango with an orange sticker on it.

Now talking about charging power, I'd think that assuming only a 40% charge every other day (or 100 miles a day) doesn't sound very conservative. 

Let's continue with that assumption though. I'd like you to consider the cost in the amount of solar needed to power 180,000 trucks at 250 kWh per day. You'd need  16.425 Terawatt hours / year which is like increasing the entire US utility solar production by 33%. If we were being conservative by assuming that companies would want to use Tesla trucks as much as possible to maximize savings, then it would be better to assume they're charging 80% each day. Now you'd need 65.7 Terrawatt hours a year or increasing the US utility solar production by 134%

I don't know how expensive that would be, but it seems like it would be a non-trivial figure.


Don't get me wrong. I'm excited and optimistic about what Tesla is doing but I'd be fooling myself to consider a 10% market share and a billion in profit (from Megacharger electricity sales) any time soon as a conservative estimate."
Yep. I missed that. Agreed.

"I've seen those lots in the Western Burbs of Chicago. I would imagine the Tesla engineers could come up with something rather easily to make it efficient. Kind of like swapping out batteries in other devices but on a grander scale.

The issue I see is the long haul back from the Western Burbs in Chicago to say Davenport, IA. Head West to East you typically have some wind at your back. Heading the opposite direction it's a head wind. The batteries would probably drain faster."
Or just swap trucks and let it recharge for 30 min until someone else swaps it again.

"I made the point that they aren't going to lay into it. As far as driving up a steep grade, yes I've done it, many times. The difference of going up those grades with 80k lbs vs something significantly less (UPS truck) is also substantial.

"The statements were tied.  I think the Model 3 is going to be Tesla's last ""chance"" to learn mass production.  If GM had said they were going to release the Bolt and produce 500,000 in the first year, no one would have batted an eye.  When Tesla says they will build that many Model 3's in 2019, everyone is very skeptical.  Tesla needs to learn to build large volumes and deliver on time or big customers buying semis are going to balk and pull their orders."
"Those were all quite obviously temporary bumps compared to long term prices, and besides Cali has crazy gas prices compared to the rest of America bar I guess Alaska and Hawaii. If Tesla is just talking about California they should of specified that. 
Either way the claim has proven to be untrue because the gas prices never did what Tesla thought they would, other than a few use cases with insanely high mileage cars."
"Friend had a battery car. 12 months out of warranty, the battery shat itself. The quote from he dealer was $15k to replace it.

Proce depreciation is also ownership cost. If the average Model S costs 100k that makes $30k depreciation in the first year alone. Thats more than the other car costs.
"> That isn't a failure

Sure is:

>http://ir.tesla.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=709155

I'm laughing at that headline, *written by Tesla*, **five years ago**:

#Drive the Model S Electric Car Anywhere in the Country on Pure Sunlight for Free

Less than 0.01% of Superchargers are powered by sunlight five years later. Yeah, I'm chalking this up as fail. You couldn't cross-country the Model S on sunlight in 2012 and still can't in 2017.

>Shoddy math? $200 in fuel per month, isn't ridiculous. Taurus starts at $28k... Please enlighten me

As written below, depreciation kills the Model S value compared to a Taurus. Fuel alone: 

13,476 miles ([national average mileage](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm)) x $0.10/mile ([national average gas price](http://gasprices.aaa.com/) and [quick mile/cost for ~22MPG](https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/fsev/costs.pdf)) = $1,347.60

13,476 miles ([national average mileage](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm)) x $0.03/mile ([national average electricity price](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a) and [quick mile/cost for ~3.5mi/kWH](https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/fsev/costs.pdf)) = $404.30

A savings of $943 a year--a savings of $78 per month, not $200. For any reasonable amount of time people keep cars, the Taurus wins on fuel, wins on depreciation, and [even maintenance *included*](https://www.edmunds.com/ford/taurus/2018/st-401725139/cost-to-own/).

A silly comparison by Tesla that led to a ""fail""."

"The question is how those margins hold up as they enter the more competitive world of middle class cars rather than high end cars. If they get there, then they will become a dominant force. But it remains to be seen and it's totally possible that a big company with a lot of mega production infrastructure or a Chinese electric scooter/bus company sees where they are going and beats them to it by >2 years with better prices. I want Tesla to win profitability as a dominant player rather than in their niche status, but I have no way of knowing if they'll really pull it off. "

Cars are lighter and don't have to haul or carry trailers.
"Of course, everything you've said is 100% true, and my concept was simplified and based on some hypothetical instantaneous deployment of a massive amount of infrastructure.

In reality, Tesla is not guaranteed any market share of the class 8 industry. I do believe, based on the reception of the vehicle, that 10% is a fair medium term target. I believe that their track record contributes to this possibility.

As for an actual deployment scenario - there are certainly high profile regions based on its highest volume early adopters. Electricity is wonderfully scalable, so you wouldn't need the infrastructure in year one's high volume areas that you may need in later years - and as time passes future deployments become easy to plan based on usage and sales volume.

But the thing is, unlike the supercharger network which has been essentially free for 4 years and subject to substantial fluctuation during high travel times, the Megacharger network would be on day one and much more reliable in terms of needs per location.


Lastly, some areas, given their infrastructure, may find it beneficial to partner with Tesla's solar/battery deployments intended for Semi, and use that electricity on demand (when batteries full) to reduce local energy prices.

This is still massively simplified and speculative, but if Tesla can charge .07/KWh for the sun, that is a ridiculous position to be in.

The beauty is that it all scales with time and demand. They might get to 10% but in how many years? I bet Tesla would love to get 1% of the market within 10 years even...

And you still have left $5000, at $500 average maintenance cost every two years thats enough to keep your car running for 20 years.

Note that Teslas Model S has a recommended maintenance shedule of over $500 a year, this means its not cheaper even without oil changes."
"Let's break this down quickly.

1. [Supercharging is never supposed to be used for daily routes](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1099608_tesla-letter-to-rein-in-local-supercharger-use-goes-wrong), at least not yet.

2. Public chargers are often expensive ([often double home rates](http://www.plugincars.com/guide-to-public-charging-costs.html)), ill-located, and rarely can be depended on. Home-charging, which Tesla has always recommended, is where people charge.

3. Your link: eghad. It's wrong on a thousand levels. They clearly write how it's *only* fuel costs--not the price of the car nor the depreciation nor the maintenance. Even if it was thorough, Elon compared the Model S to a **Ford Taurus** and similar cars, not a BMW 7-series. Come on now. The Ford Taurus has better mileage, better depreciation, lower MSRP, and cheaper fuel. You don't get to change Elon's ""promises"" with your own because they satisfy the argument. Elon was 100% incorrect on similar TCO to the Ford Taurus. 

It's OK to believe *in* Elon, but not *believe Elon*."

"The government subsidizes anyone opening a new green plant with huge showers of cash and to date have not produced enough to pay for the massive breaks it gets. The idea of a subsidy is giving a sector some help in hopes that it can flip that money. That money doesn’t get flipped it gets buried. 

According to Forbes, on a total dollar basis, wind and solar together get more from the federal government than all other energy sources combined, despite the fact that neither is anywhere close to self-supporting. Wind has received the greatest amount of federal subsidies. Solar is second.

Based on production (subsidies per kWh of electricity produced), however, solar energy “has gotten over ten times the subsidies of all other forms of energy sources combined, including wind,” writes energy expert and planetary geologist Dr. James Conca.

During the Obama years from 2010 through 2013, federal renewable energy subsidies increased by 54 percent—from $8.6 billion to $13.2 billion—despite the fact that total federal energy subsidies declined by 23 percent during the same period, from $38 billion to $29 billion.

In absolute terms, between 2010 and 2013 solar energy alone saw a 500 percent increase in federal subsidies from $1.1 billion to $5.3 billion.

If you know anything about the business world you’ll know companies like to make announcements and surprise for investors. You clearly don’t have business acumen.
Summon works on my car. What are you referring to?
"The difference between oil subsidies and renewables is that oil actually produces cheap energy. Not so with renewables. 

I am against subsidies across the board probably except for farm. (Idk every single subsidy in the fucking world)

Why do we need a carbon tax if the ozone is the best shape it’s been for nearly 30 years?

It’s not being anti science to question. It’s being anti science to not question. And please don’t come back with the whole 97% bullshit. I’m waiting for that"
"Ok, so he still has time to deliver as promised then? Didn't he promise it would be faster and cheaper than filling up with gas? Did that ever actually happen? From what I am hearing it was expensive and took a while, the demo wasn't realistic."
"""One or two"" Teslas catching fire doesn't force a company to make a saftey recall. 

Im not even sure why you put this part in your argument but, there's been around 125,000 teslas sold vs 1.1 billion other vehicles that are in the world. Don't see how tesla owners are more online active than 99.9% of the population.


>That's why they outsell all the competition combined in the states. I guess people like shit.

You must have been high as fuck when you choose to write this down. Like, really damn high."
But nowhere did they specify they were referencing California in that quote.
Have fun privately selling a car like this.
Whatever man. Keep fanboying.
Summon function is very far from what was promised initially.
">The difference between oil subsidies and renewables is that oil actually produces cheap energy. Not so with renewables. 

That's quite wrong. Coal is one of the more expensive power producers now.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#United_States

It says for the Projected LCOE in the U.S. by 2022 (as of 2016), Geothermal and on-shore wind are cheapest. Solar is ~60% the cost of coal.

>Why do we need a carbon tax if the ozone is the best shape it’s been for nearly 30 years?

These are unrelated things. 

>It’s not being anti science to question. 

You aren't making any interesting questions, you are arrogantly claiming very weird nonsense."
"They didn't make the promise. Period. They showed off a concept. When they say it's not a beta, then that's making the promise. You're just trying to find any little thing so you can say they don't deliver."
"What are you talking about? Those 1.1 billion are not in the states as I stated, and the completion to the model s is the S class, 7 series, a/s8, Jaguar xj8. People that are buying civics are not cross shopping a model s. Look at the stats and then tell me who’s high."
But why would they reference Texas gas price if 50% of their vehicles are in Cali???? Cost of ownership has always included the gas price in it... Logic! Or would you rather they use Chinese gas price for their American customers while referencing an American car?
"Have fun losing money on trade ins.
"
Fuck the projected cost. Coal is cheaper than renewables. Period. End of story. 
"Here is the thing though, it doesn't really matter if me made a promise or not, because using your logic he still has lots of time to deliver. He can't fail to deliver using your logic.

You said that something ""completely different than what was promised"" would be him not delivering right? How about the base price of the model 3? The model 3 base price was promised at $35k, and he delivered one with a base price of about $50k. I would call that completely different than what was promised."
"I looked at the cars you claim are it's competition. Yet I don't see the logic of comparing a Mid-size Luxury car to a bunch of Full Size Luxury cars.

How about we compare to an actual Mid-size Luxury car. Mercedes E-class.... sold more than the model S by 15,000"
"Logic? What is logical about anything you're saying? Did you even read the quote above? 
When they say 5 dollars per gallon, what about that is supposed to indicate California specifically? Did the previous comment leave out the last part of the quote that said ""*claim only valid in California""? There is absolutely no reason to assume they're restricting that to California based on the information I'm seeing, in fact it would be the opposite of logical to make that kind of assumption.

Besides all that, this claim was made back in 2010 when the only Teslas on the road were a small handful of Roadsters, 50% of their market would be measured in the hundreds at that point."
I am in a very unique position i dont need trade ins but thanks.
"Sure, that's why they need the $70 billion subsidy.

Trying to ignore reality isn't going to help you."
Here you go: https://electrek.co/2017/05/26/tesls-model-s-leading-us-large-luxury-segment/
"Doesn’t matter what you see or not, those are the cars people cross shop."
So let's use SA gas price then!
"Side note: Tesla has now made 3000 model 3s in a quarter. Sure, they projected 5000 a week but that’s pretty much the same thing"
"Never disputed that a $35,000 tesla sells more than $70-90K full sized luxury cars. However its stupid to compare the mid size Model S to Full Size Luxury cars, but no one wants to say it because the statistics you're showing make it look better.

https://www.autotrader.com/car-news/the-tesla-model-s-is-absolutely-not-the-best-selling-luxury-sedan-in-america-258097"
Keep pumping idiot
"The Model 3 first delivery schedule, when deposits were first taken, was this month. The first deliveries were in July, and so they are 6 months ahead of that plan.

Because of the huge demand, they decided to try and rush things, skipping a six month testing regime. Riskier, and there was a hiccup."
"What? I never mentions the model 3. Not sure why you’re saying a 35k Tesla sells more. Also you didn’t read the link as it clearly states the model S is full size based on its length. But keep not only shifting goal posts, but making new ones as I never mentioned 35k."
Google it. Calling me an idiot won’t make you right.
No but time will make me right lol moron
Time isn’t going to change that.  You’re wrong.
"I wonder if there will be a snowball effect. Since these businesses compete against each other, they will have to reserve semis at least as insurance against Tesla making good on cost per mile numbers."
"* /u/seilogistics : 1

Shoulda bought stock in Elon years ago. 
"Pepsi has a big fleet. A potentially huge customer. 

>The semi-trucks will complement PepsiCo’s U.S. fleet of nearly 10,000 big rigs and are a key part of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by a total of at least 20 percent by 2030, said Mike O‘Connell, the senior director of North American supply chain for PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay."

Man I know so many haters of Tesla in the car industry. For ages they've been shitting on Tesla. They kept saying it's going to go bust. They keep thinking short term. Musk is thinking long term. They just don't see it. Others do though.
"These will eventually be self piloting, correct?"
$500 stock confirmed
"Can someone tell me how taxes will ever work if everything goes electric to maintain our roads? (not that we have a great gas tax as is) but with them not having a gas tax, will the government eventually do a miles based tax for everyone instead of gas?"
We're drinking sodie pop tonight boys.
"Wtf, Musk is a marketing genius. He doesnt even sell the damn thing yet and companies are giving more and more momey like its some kind of competitio... Oh yeeah? You got 75 Tesla Semis, well I got 100 reservations, beat that.

The truck oem like Peterbilt, Volvo, Scania probably dont understand how this is happening. ""How does Musk sell his products without it being in production."" Remember that the Semi is kinda close to production ~~and that reservation probably mean that they wont be buying new trucks until then.~~

Edit:fixed"

Can anyone explain how servicing the tesla semi will work?  Like are they going to build service centers in every state or do we think they will contract the service out to existing truck dealers who have dealers and mechanics already in place?
"Ha, I actually said a few days ago here that it almost looks like these companies are trying to ""one-up"" each other in who's buying the most Tesla Semis. And I was wondering who would be the first to pre-order 100.

Elon has succeeded in gamifying Tesla purchases :)"
"Kinda puts it in perspective, this is only 50m in potential truck sales.  The one powerwall project in australia was more than that."
"I will say this over and over again. The Semis are the game changer for electric vehicles. Up till this point Teslas have been a rich mans vehicle. The Semi is the backbone of American commerce. It moves everything. And from what it looks like, the competition is caught with no pants on at all. If he can deliver on his promises with these its going to be the biggest win for purely electric vehicles to date.  "
Tomorrow the headlines will read Coke preorders 101 tesla trucks. 
These 50+ reservations are pretty serious commitments from businesses. The Tesla Sem is no joke. 
Trying to make up for the Kardashian commercial fiasco?
"As an urban bicyclist, who has had to choke on diesel exhaust all my life, I welcome the new electric semi overlord."
"Assuming PepsiCo replaces 10% of its fleet every year, Tesla Semi is running at 10% market share of PepsiCo’s US fleet despite being unproven, requiring a significant upfront payment and being 2 years from production. 
When Tesla are actually producing and companies don’t have to gamble a deposit so far in advance, the share is likely to increase significantly. 
Once EV trucks start demonstrating their superior economics, the diesel fleets will depreciate rapidly and annual turnover will increase significantly, increasing the annual Semi market size until the EV transition is compete "
Can Regular Owner operator order one?  I have been trucking for 5 years now and have thought about buying a truck but if Tesla lets me I could buy one of theirs and save a bunch on maintaining it.  Plus this truck ks cool is hell
Perfect. It's the huge companies that can make a difference. If they like the trucks a lot they will order more than tesla can produce
Brb buying Tesla shares 
Buy land near highways now. It's going up in value soon as loud ass trucks which spew toxic gasses into the air are phased out.
So it begins.  Truck drivers are gonna be relegated to supervising a machine real soon.
Why are companies pre-ordering the trucks? I always assumed truck drivers owned or leased their trucks. 
"That's nice for ~~them~~ Pepsi. Meanwhile, they're [royally fucking over their 2000 employees in Romania](https://www.subiectiv.ro/pepsico-romania-bruturile-angajatilor.html) by refusing to raise wages by 20% beginning Jan 2018 (as a result of taxes becoming the burden of the employee, not employer, beginning Jan 1st). Edit: they would not be paying anything extra if they raised brutto wages by 20% beginning January 1st compared to what they're paying now.

Good to know they have money to spare for Teslas, though."
I saw a statistic that says that these semi trucks take up 5% of the road but produce 20% of the pollution. Makes these Tesla semis even better because they can be rolled out by companies really quickly.
"At the rate this is catching, I’m gonna end up with one too."
"PR but could it also have anything to do with the previous business committee the Pepsi CEO and Elon were on. Good way to make connections then put it to use.  

Now we'll see how business savvy Tesla is and see if they reach out to Coca-Cola and say ""Pepsi just pre-ordered 100 Semis, shall we put you down for 200?"""
"Hell yeah, i hope Coca Cola and Pepsi co buy more and reduce pollution, and other companies do the same "
"This company makes the most sense of all that I've seen so far.

Lot of inner-city routes. "
If I had to guess PR move
This is a classic example of a legacy brand (Pespsi) attaching itself to the allure of an innovative brand with a strong following (Tesla).
"I think it will be great once all commercial vehicles are electric, and the only gas cars are collectors cars. That way you help the environment and only use gas for the cool cars!"
How else will the deliver the maximum taste and zero calories of PepsiMax?
Why would a big rig electic truck need to travel XXX+ amount of miles on a single charge? I bet you could pay stations to store batteries that truckers can swap out easily instead of waiting on a charge or depending on a single charge to go so long.
This is a game changer for the industry
And just like that I'm a Pepsi man now
The choice of a new generation...
Can confirm: Dad works for PepsiCo.. although he doesn’t really deal with the delivery side but everyone was talking about it 
"Serious question for Tesla enthusiasts.  The more recent spike and popularity in Bitcoin, with no apparent end in sight, requires a massive energy drain needed to power the ""miners"" who process the algorithms necessary to encrypt and secure a transaction.  As transportation shifts from fossil fuels to electric, can the current grid handle the loads required for both cyrpto-currency and charging stations?   Seems to me in the short term at least, cheaper fossil fuels may be the fall back to power this electric future which will only further provoke an already warming planet.   I don't think we can have the cake and eat it too, until a sustainable electrical grid is built to power the vast amounts of energy required to power the financial and transportation sectors if indeed the shift is towards electric cars, trucks, and currency.  "
"Amazing. 

What is the estimated total reservations at now then?"
Noice
I wonder if Tesla will give DLC to preorders.
"This seems to make particular sense for companies like Pepsi who haul big loads, but don't do much long-haul trucking. "
And they’ll need them all to deliver endless cases of [THIS](https://i.imgur.com/ODWLnm0.jpg) new product!
Nice.
"Is there other auto companies with electric and self-driving trucks?
"
Still won’t have better soft drinks than Coca Cola 
"Pepsi, great for the environment, death for you body."
PepsiCo might then be able to keep up with the president's beverage of choice.
How much diesel cost a year tho
"In the end it is good business for Pepsi, good business for Tesla, and good business for the environment. The only negative impact will be on truck drivers. Like coal miners it's time for blue collar workers to pursue training that would allow them to transition in their field. "
"That's actually awesome. Nice high profile company investing in this tech. Can't wait to see these semis on the road, I think they looks awesome. "
"This is so crazy. I love it, Elon Mask is surely changing the game day by day. The craziest idea that I loved was that he wants to make roads 3D, he said he wonders why the road are 2D.

Can you surely imagine a 3D road? No more traffic? Automated cars...Hmm"
*throws all money into TSLA stock*
I'm gonna abandon Coca Cola for a while. 
I'm wondering if these trucks will cause another coal industry situation. With self driving trucks there will be no need for truckers and most truckers I know (not all truckers) would be too stubborn or unable to retrain for a different career.
Aren't other companies making electric trucks? Like how far does the Tesla semi improve on the existing electric semi in the market?
LOL Peterbilt.  Nice knowing ya.
It begins
This reminds me of when Pepsi had the sixth largest military in the world
Has anyone made a bot like vinbot to track semi preorders
The revolution is starting.
"it's for PR plan and simple. They're planning to reduce their carbon footprint that this looks great to the public. Reality is that these Tesla semis are not proven, cost efficiency or even easier to operate than their current fleet."
When is the delivery projected on these trucks?
That's so awesome. Now I don't have to be guilty about drinking pepsi.
Didn't they learn their lesson with SMITH?
Not a fan of softdrinks but cool. Maybe ill buy a pepsi once a month. :) 
Goodbye coke-cola.  It’s all about Pepsi now.
This could also be seen as a recruiting move. Trucking companies are always vying for experienced/reliable drivers. Offering a Tesla Semi will help you get the best talent without even having to pay more...and whoa...you're also saving money. 
[removed]
It’s begun.
Cummins will make a profit on electric semis before TESLA. 
"I’d like to know, how heavy are these trucks compared to a traditional semi?   Will these destroy roads even further due to the increased weight?!   

More tires added to hold the weight of the batteries?   Instead of 10 tires, will there be an extra row up on the cab to disperse the load evenly to compensate?"
"This is great, but we need to look at the bigger picture. There's more to climate change than switching to eco-friendly vehicles. 

Animal agriculture is responsible for approximately 51% of greenhouse gases. MORE than half. We could turn every car into an eco-friendly one, and still not have lowered our greenhouse gas emissions by enough to be effective. Before you downvote or get angry, at least do some research and see for yourself. We NEED to change our diets in order to save the planet.

Only a 100? thats barely any compared to how many Pepsi uses.
Any indication yet how much a Tesla Semi costs?
But how many trucks does PepsiCo currently use?
"This is called a PR move. 

The chances those trucks ever get delivered is slim to none. No one expects Tesla to produce 10, let alone 100. Companies just know the  ""hurr durr i support companies that support Tesla"" soyboys like everyone in this sub jerk off to shit like this.

Mark my words - Tesla will never fulfill this order. "
They could even put a generator on board to charge the batteries while driving 
"100 trucks, which won’t be completed for 5-10 years "
"bahaha good bye trucker jobs!  and good bye all of the roadside economies that they also sustained, which will particularly hit the flyover states.  I'd call that karma for giving us trump.  "
"Well this is a neat pr stunt. For just 2 million, Pepsi just bought the most affective billboards to date.  I would put money on Pepsi having 0 intention on using any of these trucks, minus a couple just to say they are, on serious routes. They will most likely just be used at high exposure events and taken on tour around the country as a ""look how green we are"" flag to be waved around till it is no longer relevant. I wouldn't even be surprised if there are cases where Pepsi would load the trucks off of regular diesel trucks a few blocks from a venue just for the press."
Hopefully they last well! Lol
"So 0.1% of their US fleet. Decent marketing ploy to pander a bit.

Edit: some sources say PepsiCo has 100k semis in the US, others say 10K. Not sure which is the right one"
100 trucks is really not that many. Pretty obvious PR thing but still neat.
Too bad pepsi tastes like literal dog vomit.
I love how people keep giving Tesla their money for things that will take 4-5 years minimum to release lmao. Just like then enhanced autopilot lol....by the time it's released your shit is obsolete 
"Fuck yeah this is definitely gonna increase the number of charging stations, making electric cars for more viable for the average person."
Isn't the end game about self driving not battery powered?
I still don’t see how these things are useable yet.

"100 preordered trucks to be an addition to their fleet of over 10,000. Grain of sand."
Coal powered trucks. Nice. Plus 100 truckers looking for work. Cool. 
Good. Maybe tesla can quit getting taxdollars to prop it up then
"Niiiice tesla trucks... those will come in handy when they will be delivered in 2035.

I mean IF they ever get delivered.... hahahhaah.

I guess im not so into the bitcoin/tesla bubble thats going on today 😁"
100 trucks seems fucking minuscule 
These people aren't redditors otherwise they would better understand the risks of pre-ordering....
"There is an element of PR that everyone is exploiting here too. Placing an order generates news headlines that are good for Tesla, but also good for the companies placing the orders (and helps enforce / grow their green credentials).

It's obviously not the reason you go and place a $2m deposit, that is due to the core product proposition, however it is a nice cherry on top."
Reminds me of a conversation I had a few years ago with a guy who did logistics for a large oil company in the oil sands in Canada. He mentioned at one point buying up the world's supply of those massive dump truck tires from the couple companies that make them just so their competitors would have maintenance issues when they ran out of tires and their was a back order on new ones. 
I'm curious to hear Tesla's production estimates and how fast they'll try to ramp up.  I'm guessing only a few in 2019.  Will they target 1000s in 2020.  More than 10K?  
[deleted]
"Lower cost of moving goods from A to B will definitely put pressure on competitors, but it will take a while to reach ROI (return on investment). So my guess is this will really start being evident from 2021 onwards."
"Well, this semi s a great deal. According to my calculations the Tesla Semi will pay for itself after just 77,000 miles when compared to a $150,000 diesel truck that does 5.8 mpg. This does not take oil change costs into account or insurance rates, only fuel and cost of the truck."
We should all play to that and tweet/contact companies asking why they aren't buying the Tesla semi.
Absolutely 
"Oh absolutely. Especially something so easy. Infrastructure wise, this wont be huge setup or long change, making it easy to emulate

"
So Tesla's are the new futures?
I doubt it. Nothing makes investors clutch their purses like uncertainty. 
"I wonder if there was a point where the Tesla Semi could have been a commercial failure, but one or a few large orders inspired confidence and gave it that snowball effect. "
Wait. Pepsi and Tesla are competing against each other? How does a soda company compete against a tech company?
Coca Cola
Amazon
"Make no mistake, these are $20k reservations each.  100 means a $2mill down.... That's nice!"
Walmarts gonna up their bet 
I'm excited to see these in the wild
"Wait, there is a Cisco and a Sysco? 

"
Anyone care to estimate how much impact these 231 trucks will make in terms of emissions reduction? How much money do the companies expect to save?
Don't forget 10 for DHL 
Give meee 4454545454550505050505555555606060 aaand sold to the man in the ugly sweater.  
Are PepsiCo routes shorter than Wal-Mart's?
"In Feb 2016 when it dipped into the $150s/share I mentioned to my finance guy that I was interested in buying $10,000 of Tesla. He said the stock rating on Tesla was more like $80 and he couldn't recommend it. I brushed it off and stuck with something else. Two months later it was $250/share, which is probably when I would have sold.

Oh well!"
Buy now! Price is as low as it's going to get on this run! You wont see another $300/share for a long while after this downturn is over.
I got in at 36 but sold at 230 :(
Bought 10k at 185 :))))))))))))))))))
I'm more excited about the semi than anything else... It will be amazing to have roads free of those diesel beasts. And the turnover could happen quickly.
Pepsi's tractor trailer fleet is the largest in the world. Bigger than either Sysco or Walmart.
"A big fleet and a very, very old fleet. I spent last summer working for gatorade and I swear every truck that docked at our plant was near salvage time. "
I wonder what the attrition rate is for a truck.
"> 20% less greenhouse emissions in 13 years

Pitiful effort by one of the largest companies in the country. "
Coke: “Oh yeah well we will place an order for 101 Tesla Semis so suck it Pepsi.”
"That would be a perfect use for convoy auto-pilot. 100 trucks, and just one driver."
Imagine the savings from that convoy using Tesla semis!
 VESS could play this song all the time 😎
"Yeah, the thing the haters don't get is businesses don't base their purchases on what is said on Facebook. "
"I work in the auto industry as a rep for a luxury brand. The amount of shit thrown at Tesla when I bring them up is astounding. It wasn’t long ago the top German CEOs were throwing shade saying Musk would never get a car on the road. Now Tesla has a single model car with as many preorders as they sell yearly in the US. 

Sure preorders /= true sales, but Musk has developed great products that turned out to have very high demand and changed the face of the industry whether folks want to admit it not. And he’s only had a few years to figure out the auto industry where the ones talking the most shit have had over 100 to do so. 

Every single manufacturer has had production woes at one point or another. The 3s slow launch /= failure. Competition breeds innovation and that is being shown here. I, for one, really like how he has pushed the major players out of their comfort zone. 
"
"They are still correct until Musk produces an affordable, more efficient semi.  Hype does not = success.  He still has to prove them wrong and show that it can be done.  Companies that are ordering these trucks are ordering them just to test out a few, not because they are sure they will be better.  Once these companies start overhauling their fleet with these, then we will know it is real and viable."
"It won't go bust. The valuation, however, seems to be based on optimistic far-future sales volumes rather than sales today. They need to increase production by about 23x to hit todays valuation and by quite a bit more than that to make a return on that stock purchase.

Great company but certainly not a stock I would buy to hold. They've also got so much hype it's a risky short too."
"I really think the amount of huge corporations ordering these many trucks will finally get the point across. Expect a crap load of ""Tesla Killing"" announcements in the next few weeks/months."
"Those who are amazed by these decisions aren't thinking about the brand of sedan/SUV most of these decision-makers drive.

No advertising required."
I'm shocked by the people I know who just say they'll never deliver. 
for me its always been the 55+ generation thats hating on it. They have been proven wrong at every avenue but refused to believe itll last.
"Well to be fair how many companies have come and gone in that industry? It's not about a good product. It's can they *produce* those cars consistently, reliably, for a profit? Shipping 75k cars/year is a nice start. But GM ships about 10M/year.

And let's be honest, what does Tesla do that other companies can't simply steal when it hits critical mass and usurp using their much more robust means of production, marketing, and distribution?  

So, even if you *believe* in them, the market will dictate if they remain on top. Plenty of great thinkers have come and gone in that industry. So of course they're a little reluctant to believe the hype."
"Edgy teens who cannot afford a Tesla nor TSLA stock.

Elderly who do not understand the technology and the “cool factor” behind electric. "
"See: Blockbuster, Blackberry, Kodak"
Are you saying 4-D chess?
"I'm with you there. I've been a fan since I was a youngin, and I'm a shareholders now, but how in the world will they be able to get all these trucks out in a reasonable amount of time.

This expansion is crazy! I know I'm probably a bit I'll informed right now due to personal troubles but can somebody quickly fill me in?"

Maybe it’s the pompous attitude of Elon and his fanboys that people dislike? And the fact that any criticism of him is always wrong apparently.
Almost like there are a bunch of shorts being gambled or something...

"Really what ppl in the car industry hate is that Elon as far as US goes is not following the “dealers occasion/administration” and that is why. It’s not at least for the ppl I know; it not the car they hate, but how he isn’t following the same rules they have to follow . Which I honestly don’t know enough of what he is not following exactly to be a good resource. "
"The issue is that Elon's company is CURRENTLY valued on Par with GM(the second largest manufacturer), but Tesla has made 100,000 vehicles All Time.

GM sells 7,000,000 vehicles a year.

But the companies are valued the same.

I like Elon, but thats bad investment. If I wasnt investing in Crypto, I'd short Tesla. The current valuation isnt justified, its all hype."

"Not if a truckers' union has anything to say about it. That's why we don't have automated freight trains yet.

Or at the very least drone style/remote controlled trains or semis. Think about a world where semi truckers get to work an 8-hour shift in a single building and they get to go home to their wives every night because all they have to do is remotely control a truck in California while they sit somewhere in South Carolina. We could absolutely already do this with trains, but we don't."

"100 reservations are 1% of Pepsis US fleet. This is a little field test for them. Nothing more.

&nbsp;

No fleet operator would risk his business with a massive introduction of an untested truck.

&nbsp;

It's a good sign that many companies want to test the truck. But in the end it's for sure below 1% of total trucks in the US at the beginning.

&nbsp;

The most important question is, how committed is Tesla with ramping up the production of this bad boy?"
"Every single passenger aircraft is sold this way.  If you order a Boeing 787 today, it [won’t start production for ten years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Boeing_787_orders_and_deliveries#Orders_and_deliveries_by_type_and_year).   Companies put deposits in early so they aren’t left behind. "
"All of these ""large"" orders are actually quite small in the companies view. Most of these companies have a giant giant fleet of trucks and an order of 100 might not even be their biggest order that day. "
"""won't be buying new trucks until then"" that part is not true and would be extraordinarily stupid of that company to do. "
"ALL the major fleets reserve future tractor production, they project out three years, at least, of what their future needs will be.

"There's a warranty for 1m miles, plus they have  VERY few parts, so not nearly as much maintenance"
"motor/gearbox replacement:  looks like they could be disconnected by hand and lifted out of the back with a small crane.  

battery on the base in front of the motors might be dropped down like tesla planned on for hot swapping batteries in the model S years ago.  

Tesla's garages at current service centers might not fit the height of the semi inside, but those aren't too expensive/difficult to put in if they have space in the parking lots.  

wheels/tires, other stuff doesn't really need to be serviced by tesla.  
cabin stuff they could probably handle with rangers like they are moving to do in cars"
That’s what I am wondering and haven’t seen anywhere.  I work with about ten local local trucking companies.  They all average between 10 and 80 trucks and they all do most of their own maintenance.  I’m curious how this will work with Tesla and their precious stances about doing it yourself.  I could see this being a major sticking point for a lot of trucking companies.
Most of these companies are just testing the waters with these small orders. If tesla delivers what they promised then that’s when then big orders will come through
"I am a huge Tesla supporter.  
I have to say though that these orders/reservations  are not commitments.  
They are very promising indications that the financial prospects of using the Tesla semi for short and long haul trucking looks to be on paper a good investment.  
Let’s hope that this is the case and companies see the actualization of their NPV / IRR figures.  "
"It’s not a serious commitment, it’s a refundable deposit. "
"The people who think these are serious commitments are the people who don't know anything about the fleet business.  Every big fleet buys 10+ of virtually every single product on the market that is purported to save them money. 90% of the time the product is not adopted widely throughout the fleet.

That's not to say Tesla won't be successful, but they have deposits for <500 trucks.  There are over 3.5 million class 8 trucks on the road."

Property values in my neighborhood are pretty low given the location/crime rate/proximity to downtown in my city and I imagine the highway noise is a big part of it."
"Next step after that is one guy in an office remotely ""supervising"" 10 trucks, which will mainly consist of ""investigating"" why a truck paused on its route. Which will mainly consist of reading the accurate self-diagnosis reported by the truck telling you exactly why it paused and when it'll be safe to resume. 

Maybe we just give this guy in the office a large green button that he can press to authorize computer-generated suggestions. Doesn't really matter whether this green button is hooked up to anything. "
Where do i sign up?
Trucks can be either company owned or driver owned. Both situations are common.
"I think the ""pre-order"" is a down payment toward either a lease or a purchase, but too soon to tell."
Most truck drivers work for companies instead of being owner-operators.
"Owner-Operators are actually on their way out, especially after California implemented a series of restrictions on how companies can interact with them.  Essentially, many carriers were using Owner-Operators as way to avoid paying salaries/benefits."
"That sounds like a problem caused by the Romanian government, not a problem caused by employers within its borders"
"That sucks for the drivers, but it sounds like a very bad decision from the Romanian government, companies sometime suffer from governmental decisions and sometimes profit, you can't suffer one and not enjoy the other. (unless they lobbied for it). "
"> Good to know they have money to spare for Teslas, though.

That's not how it works.  These aren't toys they're buying.  They aren't spending more money to push EVs. They're doing this because think this is a net positive for them when it comes to $$$$."
"Are they legally required to raise the wages? Are all the other businesses raising pay by 20%? If not, perhaps this legislative change will create economy-wide deflation.

"Depends... can a building sized power plant be more efficient than 100,000 little engines (less grid and battery power losses)?  There's also probably some pollution reduction benefits to consolidation... some scrubbing equipment might be too heavy or expensive for every automobile."
"I only got numbers for Germany, but they should be similar for the US.

Replacing all ICE cars with EVs would require +20% more power. This is easily doable with todays production capacity (70GW max peak vs 100GW production).
Due to autonomous vehicles (robo taxis), we don't have to replace all ICE cars, and if car sharing (or better picking up multiple passengers per robo taxis) is successful, we're talking about less mileage -> less energy. It'll be interesting to see how public transport will survive this, maybe resulting in more mileage. But +20% more electric power should be reasonable.

&nbsp;

No idea what the Bitcoin guys are doing. This is crazy stuff.

&nbsp;

But it does not make any sense to wait with the EV transition to until we got a clean gird. EVs does cause less emissions (well to wheel) in even the dirtiest electrical grid: https://qz.com/1118616/electric-cars-even-powered-by-the-dirtiest-electricity-are-still-cleaner/

&nbsp;

More money is invested in building green energy production than in new fossil fuels, so it's getting better, the more additional energy is required. Furthermore can EV help to integrate volatile wind and solar production into the grid, by storing energy or not loading when stress on the grid is high.

&nbsp;

It's simply game over for fossils, no need to wait any longer. "
"Thank you to those who have replied.  My original comment was down voted so this will be buried probably.   I only brought up Bitcoin because according to an article in [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-mining-track-consume-worlds-energy-2020-744036), all ""mining"" transactions are set to consume the equivalent of the World's energy output by 2020, given the current pace.   Whether or not this is factual, I don't know, I thought it was worth consideration for discussion along with electric vehicles as the current power grid we have in place might not be able to handle it, particularly with warmer seasons and the need for HVAC.  I think a viable form of fusion energy is about 30 - 40 years away, once this is mastered, it's a true game changer, a revolution in clean energy the World has never seen.  If electric vehicles are the future, fusion energy will finally end the stranglehold of fossil fuels.  Anyway, I do appreciate the thoughtful replies to my inquiry. "
"From what I understand, most crypto mining happens in countries rich with cheap, plentiful energy. 

EV adoption on the other hand tends to happen in areas where electricity costs are higher (first world countries).

In any case, EV adoption won't actually require that much change to the grid. It has the advantage of being able to charge flexibly and there are already a number of programs that take advantage of this (utilities that offer lower costs for charging in exchange for being able to shift around when your EV charges overnight). In a lot of cases there's a lot of power that is simply wasted or generated inefficiently because of changing demand or because a base load of power has to be supplied to the grid at all times. In addition, refining oil/gas itself is actually pretty energy-intensive and will be removed from the grid."

This is probably a test order to test the costs involved with running 100 electric trucks vs 100 diesel trucks. If the costs are lower over a long term projection we can expect fully electric trucks to be a hot purchase in the future for trucking companies and people that own their own trucks.
"Pepsi has multiple things 

Probably 5-9k combination trucks and probably a similar number of strait trucks.  

But in their truck fleet they include service trucks that include their pickup trucks and vans."

Road trucks won’t use car charging stations and cars should even have the same plug as trucks so that cars don’t try to take over truck parking.  We already have enough problems finding space 
"They're not buying them for the automation, they're buying them for the long term savings that it will create for them. Diesel is expensive.

"2 million is a pretty cheap PR move, hell, some ad campaigns cost in the tens of millions or more. Buying these trucks might be the cheapest positive PR they've gotten all year."
Agreed. It's the old Prius effect. It was good for your image to be associated with it. And it still doesn't hurt. Tesla is the next step on that continuum.
"also, you do get the deposit back. less if you wait longer (inflation), but still not cash that is gone for good"
"Exactly.

Companies want their brand seen alongside Tesla's, seeing as Tesla was just ranked as the most innovative company (as perceived by consumers)."
"Wow PepsiCo yum! Brands are really progressive! 
Hey kids guess where we’re going for dinner! "
"These trucks driving around are also good PR. You know how nice it'd be living in a town that has a lot of truck activity, and not having loud trucks in stop and go traffic. Not belching smoke everywhere and wailing through stop-and-go traffic. These 100 trucks can be strategically used in cities, plastered with pepsi advertisements or whatever. It also makes for a good trial to see if they are able to replace other parts of the fleet. Little downside so long as tesla can deliver."
"You really think the reason companies are buying these trucks is for good PR?

They're buying them to save money long term 

Pepsi doesn't need feel good pr, they're large enough "
"No amount of Tesla purchases will ever make me consume the abomination that is Pepsi.

I will concede that I enjoy most of their other sodas though."
"It should be mentioned that the biggest budgets for most large companies are for their marketing department. They spend a ton to run ads all over the world, so even if they back out of the sale and lose that $2 it would be considered a pittance compared to how much free advertising it just gave them.  "
"Once the companies are on your side, there's no losing.  "
"While PR is part of it, I think reserving trucks for a serious trial is the primary driver....

I don't see a company with fleet of 10,000 trailers reserving 100 semis as bad news .... they are going to use that 100 to do a serious trial then work out when and where they can use the Tesla semis... 

The reason for wanting to trial ASAP is not being left behind, if the Semi really stacks up as a great option... 

Others may be skeptical and not place early orders and let others do the trials....

What they are missing is a chance to evaluate the Semi on their routes, to establish contact with Tesla and ensure Megachargers are built where they want them and to have a schedule for Megacharger  construction and Semi adoption...

So those ""late to the party"" may actually find it is hard to get Semis and Megachargers when they want them, of course Tesla isn't the only option .. but they may be ceding some competitive advantage...

did you know current fleet average is 7mpg and new trucks are above 9 mpg, making your example equally useful for buying a new diesel truck?"
"The obvious answer is ""because the product doesn't exist"" - plenty of honest reasons to wait on Tesla and make sure that they can deliver before committing resources. "
"Because most companies are not going to to risk investing in a product which does not exist outside prototype.

Instead, they just talk about the cars they're going to release, but without planned production numbers, and apparently expect battery manufacturers will simply expand capacity 10 to 100 fold on their whim, once they decide to ask for it.

 Investors on the other hand see a company with clear potential but with worse returns than a hundred other stocks; sure any serious investor has put their money into TSLA years ago but it doesn't make any sense to go all-in on TSLA because your money is just going to be sitting there when you could be using it for something else."

>People that think 100,000 cars sold is pretty close to 7,000,000 cars sold by major manufacturers

I worry for my friends drinking the Elon Koolaid. The reason current automotive laughs off Tesla is because they are a machine shop, not a mass manufacturer... but they are valued as much as a company that sells 7,000,000 cars per year."
"TSLA shorts just sound like 1980s typewriter investors... when the market just preordered 3 full years of global IBM PC production capacity. 

The ICE is dead, it just doesn't know it. "
"Well, the haters do say a lot of random retarded things."
"Teslas do have downsides.  But they are so much better than any other car ever made, I would not take a free ICE if you gave it to me. 

 You are also exaggerating Tesla's problems. Something like 95 percent of all Tesla owners would only ever consider purchasing another Tesla. 

"
"Tesla will only use their own dealerships. No commission.   And you buy a tesla through Tesla.com, you don't go to a dealership and haggle on the price or shop against other cars. 

 Electric cars will eventually reach the point of no maintenance. They only require one moving part to drive.  Dealerships are going to hate hate hate hate hate this. "

Also Pepsi can reserve 100 trucks with a fully refundable deposit and only pull the trigger on one or two initially until they want to expand their test. 
"100 trucks is 1% of it's fleet, but it's 10-20% of the trucks Pepsi buys in a year."
[removed]
"100 is kind of a lot when a normal test truck order is 1 or 2.

This shows a lot more commitment than what fleets have been willing to go for with past alt fuel trucks. "
"Not that it would have to, because of the redundancies built in"
"> It’s not a serious commitment, it’s a refundable deposit. 

The logistics arms of large corporations like PepsiCo just don't casually give 2+ years duration, $2m, no-interest loans with no collateral to other corporations on a whim...

Furthermore, they are definitely not in the habit of providing other corporations with free publicity with large, 100 units pre-orders, valued at $15m-18m.

For business accounting purposes these costs are likely booked as a $2m expense, because Tesla does not place these funds into an escrow account - which (and the permission to publicly disclose this pre-order) likely required high level approval in the PepsiCo corporate hierarchy.

It is pretty clear that PepsiCo is interested.

You missed the point entirely 
"Pepsi has way more than 10,000 trucks. I don't know there getting that stat from. I know for a fact frito lay has 60,000 sales routes in the US each with their own truck, and that's not even counting their OTR semis. Plus they have 5 other divisions and operate in 200+ countries. "

Thats a lot of job loss.
I mean I always assumed the actual drivers purchased the trucks not the companies 
"It is - partially. They wouldn't pay *more* than they do right now if they increased brutto wages by 20% beginning January 1st. They're doing this to reduce costs, at the expense of literally all of their employees in Romania, and are one of the few (possibly the only) large companies that said they'd do this. Virtually everyone else hasn't made an announcement yet or has officially pledged to raise all brutto salaries so that net income isn't affected."
"It's not just the drivers, it's all 2000 employees they have in Romania. Yes, it's an awful decision on the part of the government, but Pepsi are choosing to profit here, and at the expense of employees :("
"In the long term, yes. But it shows they have money to burn (else they'd wait to see how the Tesla Truck actually behaves IRL, what the amortization period for the investment is, etc.), whereas their behavior in Romania points to them being strapped for cash.

Bear in mind, if they increased all non-IT workers' gross salaries so that their net income would be unaffected, they'd be paying at most 1% more for payroll than they currently are. If *this* is where they see opportunities for cost savings, in taking advantage of our government's ineptitude and thereby reducing good employees' wages by 20%, they're doing this whole ""business"" thing wrong imo."
"> Are they legally required to raise the wages?

No, that would be unconstitutional - which is pretty much everyone's gripe with the change; our incompetent government pushed it through, relying on the honor system (of *corporations*?!) to make up for the fact that they can't legally force any company to raise gross wages. Clearly, as Pepsi shows, they were misguided in thinking corporations wouldn't fuck their employees over.

> Are all the other businesses raising pay by 20%?

Pretty much every large company/corporation with a presence in Romania is

> why were employers ever expected to pay someone's personal income tax anyways?

This happens the world over. You have your net income, but your salary lists your gross income. You pay income tax, which the company has to cover by paying you a gross salary that is higher than the money you expect to go home with every month. I don't know about other countries, but in Romania (and Germany) you always negotiate your net income with a potential employer, while documents reflect gross income. E.g., if all taxes payable by an employee amount to 20%, and you expect to be paid $4000 a month for a job, you say you want a net income of $4000 during the interview, and they present you a draft of a contract listing a gross income of $5000 (of which 20% will be deducted every month, leaving you with $4000).

To simplify:

Let's say they currently pay you a net income of $1000 a month. In order for you to get that (due to income tax + a few social taxes), they pay you a gross of ~$1428 (net income divided by 0.7, as your net income is 70% of your gross income after taxes). You're left with $1000, you pay $428 in taxes owed for your gross salary, and they pay taxes relative to your gross salary of, let's say, 25% of your gross wages ($250 a month in this case) on top of that. So they're paying $1428 + $250 = $1678

After January 1st, they will no longer be paying the $250 - **you** will instead. So with no change to your contract, they'd continue paying you $1428 gross, of which you'd take home $1428 - $342 (old taxes at a modified rate, let's round it to 24% instead of 30%) - $250 (the ""new"" taxes, which the employer used to pay) = **$836**

Meanwhile, they're still paying you $1428, but no longer paying the $250 to the government

What most are doing is increasing gross income by ~20%, which leads to a new gross of $1713, of which you pay 24% taxes (instead of 30%), leaving you with $1301 before the ""new"" taxes, which bring you down to $1301 * 0.75 = $976 - minimal loss, and now they pay $1713 (as opposed to $1678 earlier), while you earn $976 (instead of $1000 earlier)

I don't know the exact values for the various taxes off hand, but with a raise that just about covers the gap between what your new net income would be after the new taxes and what it was before, they'd end up paying less than +/- 1% compared to right now, and you'd end up getting +/- 1% compared to right now. 

Which is what most are choosing to do, to not virtually shit all over their employees. But not Pepsi. They need new Tesla trucks.

"Because they are a multi-billion dollar company. The amount of ""savings"" they will get off 100 trucks pales in comparison to the marketing value this headline has and will produce.  Pepsi employs over 10,000 trucks. Do you really expect them to pay to build the infrastructure to run those trucks? Haha no. These trucks are nothing but rolling billboards that attract the large young demographic they are after.  Why would they off load a diesl truck into a tesla truck for a short 3 block trip? Easy so they dont risk damaging the investment. Until these trucks are common place and the hype dies down they will milk this for all the publicity they can.  Front page of reddit, countless news station will mention this in some form or another. Pepsi just launched a world wide commercial that has the people they want talking about them. And it only cost them 2 million.


You may think its stupid but that's how the world works. Don't believe me, just look back at all the times large companies jump on board some hype train and milk it for what its worth than drop it like a bad habit.


Edit: also let me ask you this. When was the last time you saw a Pepsi truck on the road?  But I can tell I am pissing off this echo chamber of tesla fanatics even though I have never said the trucks won't work and have even stated that they will be common place soon eventually. But nevertheless they are so short sighted and ready to be angry at someone for not blindly praising everything that has a tesla logo or even the sent of elon to it.   So go on, quote ""stats"" even though they serve no purpose in this discussion, claim how everything not tesla is killing the planet and talk about how stupid I am for thinking it won't work. Even though I never said it wouldn't. And ignore the fact that I am simply saying Pepsi did this for the sole purpose to get all the tesla fanboys a bit of a chub going and could not careless about how the truck actually performs since they will be nothing more than a ""look at me"" flag that they can take on tour."
"I am a logistics coordinator for an ethanol plant and on a daily bases deal with the loading and unloading of about 200 trucks.  The majority of those trucks are owned 4 companies and we have about 20 or so independents.  Of the ones who have brought up the tesla truck (3 of the company owners and a handful of the independents) none of them want this truck.  If you are in Cali. where you cant throw a rock with out hitting some type of charging station or one being built than yay for you, this truck will be perfect.  But in the rest of the country where charging stations are not so readily available this is a problem.  Let's take where I live right now.  I would have to drive 45 miles to get to a charging station, get a room at the hotel it is located at and charge my car.  If I needed to get service done on my tesla.  To put it frankly, I could not reach a tesla service station on full charge.  ""Oh but in 5 years they will have the infrastructure built..."" No they won't. Because there has been 0 interest in this area for developing this.  

Having charging stations set up is just not a problem for my area.  It is like this for a huge part of the USA.  And the charging stations available are not suited for these trucks to actually charge at.  So no, not every company will want one, that is a very naive way of looking at the world."
"I mean to be fair, later automation (and the reduced costs that accompany it) is probably on the mind of most of these companies. "
"$2 million is maybe 10 seconds of airtime during the Super Bowl, so it's a rounding error in terms of ad budget for Pepsi.  However, the PR effect is really just an added bonus.  The monetary savings here are pretty massive from fuel savings and delivery time reduction (assuming used for final distribution)"
"You might be confusing PR and Marketing. In marketing $2 mio is nothing, however it is a chunk in any PR budget. 

Source: Am a PR exec working side by side with a marketing exec. I have a decent budget, but her's is (rightfully) 12 times mine. "
"> some ad campaigns cost in the tens of millions or more.

Pepsi spends about $2 billion on marketing in a year, for context. "
"Even if they back out of the deal, citing some issue or other for the reason, they've still got more the $2m of marketing out of this, even if they lose their deposit!"
"A PR move that they can actually use. Pretty good return, considering the product is a real material thing, with a warranty."
When South Park makes an episode about it we will know Elon has finally made it haha
"I remember when the p100 or whatever the base is for the sedan came out I read a great editorial in motor trend talking about how brilliantly simple it was what Elon was doing. The “Prius effect” as you stated is a very powerful thing. If you see a middle age women in one you imagine she’s a 5th grade science teacher with two grandkids and a big heart ect. We feel like we know these people just because of the car they own, which can be said for other cars but not to this degree imo, Tesla took that model of social perception and used it to their advantage to such a high degree. It’s such an obvious thing to do but is yet so brilliant. I also don’t think it’s quite as simple as making a fast electric car, that would get you half way there but Tesla has done many other things to fully exploit this. You can’t force the consumers to do buy something they don’t want but you can try to change how they feel about it to ones advantage. "
">And it still doesn't hurt

That's debatable. Owning a prius nowadays is pretty much a statement that says ""I don't care about cars or driving"". That works fine if your only ambition is to come off as eco-friendly but personality-wise that car is vanilla ice cream: Unremarkable, uninspired and boring. "

"Electric busses are built in my California town by a Chinese company called BYD. Stands for build your dreams. I ride them from time to time. They can be induction charged at the main bus terminal. You know, by a coil of wire under the slab where they park."
"Tesla is smart to get into the bigger vehicles and logistics. The other car companies getting into EV is bad for Tesla, as almost all the other automakers will be able to do what Tesla did on a much larger scale.

Tesla has owned the EV market and has probably around a 50 billion market cap? Ford, GM, Chrysler, VW, BMW, Toyota, etc is going to take that 50 billion cap and raise it to a trillion? Suddenly Tesla isn't so dominate. And most of them plan to do it within the next 3 years.

With a million mile warranty you amortize the equipment the same as other trucks.
"Here is what I factored in:

Truck: Peterbilt Model 579

Cost of diesel truck: $150,000

Diesel Cost: $4 / gallon

Diesel Truck MPG: 5.8 MPG

Cost of Tesla truck: $180,000

Electricity cost: $0.15 / kWh

Efficiency: 0.5 miles / kWh

I figured that after 76,991.15 miles:

Diesel Truck would have cost: $150,000 + $53,097.35 = $203,097.35

Tesla Semi (500 miles range) would have cost: $180,000 + $23,097.35 = $203,097.35

Anything past 77k miles will make the Tesla Semi cost less than the diesel truck (in terms of fuel at least). 

This does not include: oil costs, insurance differences, the time lost in stops (55 gas station stops for diesel, 154 electricity stops for Tesla Semi), any autopilot benefits, and anything else I might not have thought of. 

If you have different numbers you would like me to try, let me know. "
"> a product which does not exist outside prototype

That's a bit unfair to Tesla. The semi truck is not just a prototype. 

* Tesla is already accepting reservations.
* They have the specs and the price up on the website [here](https://www.tesla.com/semi/).
* They have already driven a few of these trucks between Nevada and California.
* They are not just offering a semi truck but a whole package including 1 million miles warranty and $0.07/kWh fixed price Megachargers. 

I think you have confused Tesla with other brands that show off concepts they never intend to build."
"> Business succeeds on conservative decisions and incremental progress.

Oh no.  What's going to happen to Tesla then?  Maybe they should make more conservative decisions.  Like Sears.

"100 regular Tesla Semis

"Honestly I might buy a coke if they troll for 101. It's just such a blunt and casual response. A lazy, seemingly off-hand power move that makes for a potentially great PR interaction."
"That would largely be dependent upon where you're at. I worked for Pepsi for a year, knew most of the Coke drivers. None were contractors. I actually haven't heard of that being a thing, on the Coke side or Pepsi. So I'm assuming it's very location-dependent on if that's the case.

To note though, would be less surprised to hear this apply to the deliveries from the production locations to the distribution warehouses. But I do know those drivers I met with Pepsi were employees, not contractors."
Isn't Pepsi's as well? PBG is a different entity iirc
Wouldn't that be something
Or starts their own electric truck company.

We need more of the latter from more people to drive humanity forward. The former just drives Bezos's bank balance forward. There's nothing wrong with the former in itself, but there's already plenty of that around."

Hello. I want to buy Tesla stock but don't know anything about stocks. My friend got mad at me when I told him that.
Well that's two more than me.
~$6k
Rough math but looks like 7500$ ish
"Excluding commissions from the buy and sell he bought he would have made ~$6667 from his original $10,000 investment."
"Math!
$10,000/$150 per share=66.6 shares.

66.6 shares x a sell price of $250=$16,666.  

Total profit $6,666"
Exactly what people say about Amazon. Seems to be working okay for them. 
wary :)
"I'd disagree with this. Tesla has a following and if they got into serious financial trouble, they could raise money really quickly.

That is if something doesn't change. There could be a change (like a surprise competitor, Elon dies, etc.) that could screw up the entire equation."
Seems like Elon is more interested in a company's power and reach than purely profit.
"I mean the idea of giant silent moving projectiles scare me, especially when I'm pulled over. I hope they have a way around this. "
Not to mention ones that have enough torque to break 50mph on an uphill slope. Getting stuck behind a semi on a no-pass mountain road sucks.
"I feel equal parts excitement and frustration at all this. Excitement for obvious reasons, but frustration because realistically the existing big truck manufacturers could have done this sooner and much more quickly than Tesla, but they chose not to."
"20 years for partial acceptance?  Nonsense.  Unless something goes terribly wrong, it will take all of about five years for the majority of OTR trucking to be at least looking at the move to electric.  The relative cost of diesel truck usage will make continuing to buy them very hard to justify for most bean counters unless they have some very unique requirements.

Truck drivers are going to universally want electric for any deliveries where lots of stop and go or heavy traffic exists - the acceleration difference is *massive*, which saves a lot of time and money.

All OEMs are working on electric, whether they've publicly shown it it not.  Many big cities worldwide are banning fossil fuel vehicles in the 2030-2040 range.  I expect that some smaller European countries will do national bans in that timeframe as well.  It's going to take some serious lobbying for trucks to get exemptions when viable electric alternatives exist.

Diesel trucks won't go away overnight, but their remaining years of dominance are numbered."
What does partial acceptance mean in that regard?  And which industry experts are we talking about?
"maybe for independent or small fleet operations.

but if they see pepsi test for a year and then buy 1000, that change could be much faster.

if they really do pay for themselves in 6 years of operations in just fuel savings.

it's a no-brainer."
Keep in mind these pre-orders can increase
It is 1% of the size of their fleet. It is a test and a cheap marketing win I would expect.
"PepsiCo would make sense with their hundreds of brands, probably not Pepsi alone surely. "
"I don't have a source for worldwide, but here's one for the U.S.

"I used to work for PepsiCo. I don't know if this statistic is accurate, but it wouldn't surprise me. PepsiCo owners Pepsi beverages, Frito-Lay, Gatorade, quaker foods, and other divisions. Uncle Ben's rice is owned by PepsiCo. Aunt Jemima is owned by PepsiCo.

I worked at one Frito-Lay factory, that had over 100 tractors assigned to it. Within 250 miles there were 5 major warehouses and dozens of distribution centers with their own trucks. There were 35 similar factories around the country. Just for Frito-Lay.

Additionally, PepsiCo runs their own fleet for the most part. Many other ""big"" logistics operations subcontract out part or all of their trucking. Do even if they're shipping more products, they don't really have a fleet that big. "
"> I would think Swift or Taylor might have them all beat.

Taylor Swift?"
I'd like to see both Swift and Taylor beaten by Taylor Swift. 
"You should look into how many companies Pepsico owns. Coke sells more soda a year than Pepsi does. Pepsico did $63 billion in revenue last year, $20 billion more than Coke. Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Quaker, Lipton, etc. are all giants of their own, but owned by Pepsi. "
"They aren't. 

They are the largest in the privately held fleet, not-for-hire category.

"NO MORE SECRETS.

"No, I mean more preorders than the German brands sell stateside. "
"How is this misinformation real?

Until you realize that there are 5 million semi trucks driving in the U.S.
"The article states that Pepsi owns 10,000 trucks, so it’s only 1% of their fleet.  

Also, it states they are looking at testing the trucks for light duty trips (things like chips from their Frito-Lay subsidiary) or short runs under the truck’s 500 mile range. 

This is very much a “test the waters” move from Pepsi. "
"Really depends how you look at it.  I mean to put it in perspective, Nikola Motors got [7,000 pre-orders](https://insideevs.com/nikola-motor-logs-7000-pre-orders-for-nikola-one-electric-semi-truck) in the first month.  There are millions of semis on the road in the US alone."
"When they start making 100 per month, we will all believe. 

"
For Pepsi it is.
"I too would like this to be a huge thing, but a company like Pepsi is *massive*.   

For them the cost of 100 trucks really is some ""pee in the pool"".    The fluctuations in their *fuel costs alone* could likely easily pay for these trucks. 

100 trucks is just enough to start getting some solid numbers to justify a bigger purchase. "
"It represents 1% of Pepsi's US trucking fleet (10,000 trucks according to reuters)."
100 trucks is insignificant.
"It's made of T3 parts, not TS parts. It's the T3 of semis."
"""According to Elon...""

His words aren't exactly trustworthy.  He frequently says things from a very idealistic, big idea standpoint that often don't come to fruition.  Just because he says something in a presentation doesn't make it true.  Testing it by real companies in real conditions will determine if his claims are true."
"No need to attack him. He's just saying that the trucks don't exist yet, so there's good reason for a trucking company to hold off on overhauling there fleet. Trusting the promises of any single company is a bad way to run a company and won't fly in the eyes of investors."
"Watch him do what? The semi isn't proven yet from a range or cost/mile standpoint.  When it is, then it will become a game changer.  Until then, it is only hype and hope."

The 2017 Bolt is the closest thing to a competitor at 60kwh,  which means they have caught up with the 2008 Roadster battery.

That means you'll get your plane about five years from now. 

I was mistaken, when I was working at Boeing lead time was about ten years, but they've ramped up production and it's only five now.   Keep in mind there are airlines that ordered 787s in 2006 that still haven't received their planes (795 orders from 2004-2006).

But how far does your truck go on a full tank?
"I think the point of the charging is that it's relatively close to the time to fill diesel into a semi-truck. Plus, with diesel, you need to be present while it's filling, but with electricity, you can walk away and get more out of an already required stop. "
"You can actually (safely) walk away, take a shower, eat some food, etc. while charging. People don't seem to realize this.

"Thanks for your personal experience.

You only mention your concerns about chargers. From what we have seen, fast charging will be done with a new special Megacharger. There is zero such infrastructure installed so far,  so no one can use a Tesla semi as of now.

Tesla plan to install them at trucking depots, and on highways to enable long range trucking. The early infrastructure would be where the early customers require. The first will be for Tesla's use for transport between their factories.

Their long term plan is for infrastructure to support trucking everywhere.

Tesla is not going to compensate me for that loss in business. We all have delivery scorecards. a few broken trucks could sink a small shipping company.

Tesla is going to build the Semi. They're going to do the best job they can, but the economics of how it shakes out in the real world are unproven. You can over promise and under deliver in a luxury road car, but in the trucking market it won't fly. Your stats/supply chain managment guys will tell you exactly what's what."
But the Tesla Semi is still a prototype even if it works. They won't even make the trucks for another year anyway.
"Everything you said confirms the fact that these trucks are just prototypes....

* You can post specs and pricing on even the most vaporware of products, much less a prototype

* Prototypes generally function close to or as intended

* You can offer any features on even the most vaporware of products, much less a prototype

People should probably seriously start thinking about that if we're seriously thinking about automated trucking."
"> Why would the Romanian government ever do this? 

Because they're cretins

> They are shifting the burden to their workers without any compensating control (that you have mentioned).

Yep

> Were they crossing their fingers and hoping for companies to increase worker wages? 

Yes

> Why are you? 

We're not *hoping* - many companies have already publicly announced that they'll be raising gross wages, many more have done it non-publicly

> This seems like a dumb decision by the government and shifting blame.

It is

> Sure, it would be great if the companies stepped up

A great many are

> but why did the govt do this in the first place and without a requirement that the companies take that step? Sounds awful for those workers.

They can't add any requirement of the sort, it would be unconstitutional. It is awful for those employees (note: not just workers, but also techs, specialist, managers - EVERYONE)

It's even worse for those paid minimum wage, as the minimum wage itself will also increase, BUT with the new taxes burdening the employee, the net income for those on minimum wage before/after the change will actually be lower - and there will be 0 incentive amongst most employers to increase the wages of those earning minimum wage, because doh, that's why they hire people for minimum wage"
"How have I not addressed the point of other companies acting differently or similarly

"> Yeah we don't negotiate net income state side.

That's not quite true. In the US, for every dollar you earn, you pay a percentage as income tax and the company pays a percentage as payroll tax. What Romania is doing is essentially rolling the payroll tax into the personal income tax.

Another US analogy would be Social Security and Medicare taxes. If you work for a company, you pay 7.65% of your income in FICA taxes, and your company also pays 7.65% of your income in FICA taxes. If you are self employed, you have to pay the full 15.6% yourself, so what Romania is doing is essentially not making the companies pay the tax and making employees pay the full amount as if they were self-employed."
"I don't want to get into your tax system - I, personally, think it's bordering on clinically insane.
But US companies *in Romania* absolutely handle things ""the Romanian way"". I worked for Microsoft until not long ago, and whenever we were discussing wages with management, HR, etc, we either talked about net income or net *and* gross, like ""hey, so one hour of overtime pays $40 net/$57 gross, right?"""

I only checked tesla's website (which doesn't even mention the semi on the homepage) but I see it elsewhere now.  
"Look at all of the publicity around them right now for just making the purchase.  Anything Tesla has people drooling at the mouth and they know it.  At the most Pepsi will have a few of these trucks on simple high visibility routes just to show that they are ""using"" them, while the rest go on tour being parked in front of huge venues like sporting events, concerts, ect. Until these trucks have been thoroughly tested and a solid frame work for charging these rigs is established, these trucks will not see much action.  Do you expect pepsi to fork over the money to have enough charging stations installed at warehouses to keep this fleet running?  I am not saying these trucks wont eventually start becoming more common place, I am saying pepsi is doing this just to get some brownie points from the environmentalist and get their name in the news and in the spot light.  I would put a lot of money on pepsi already having a few guys working on unique designs to put on this truck and every time any advancement is made they will make a huge noise about it just because its good PR.  Pepsi is not a transport company, its a manufacturer and selling more products is the name of the game.  To put this into perspective, the time it took me to type this, Pepsi has already made enough money in pure profit to buy 200 more trucks.  They dont need more trucks, they need more people talking about pepsi and pepsi products.  That is marketing and that is the sole reason for their purchase. The money these trucks will save, probably wont even cover the cost of the bonus the CEO will give himself.    


But again this is an echo chamber and anything that is said that is not in total support of tesla products is dismissed, miss understood and never given the actual thought it needs to comprehend how things outside the tesla bubble works. If i had a tesla dealership closer to me than 600 miles, i would buy one because i my driving routine lends perfectly to EV's and i dont need a charging station. So go ahead click the downvote button and tell me how im so stupid to think that a billion dollar cooperation did not buy 100 trucks from the most talked about company on the planet to not take advantage of the massive publicity it would bring them. "
"The cost saving for 100 trucks of is negligible.  They make more money in marketing and advertising in which this truck would excel in as it is put on display at high traffic venues.  A lot of work has already gone into optimizing truck routes and the ""savings"" this truck would have will be eaten up by needing to install charging stations at ware houses or truck storage yards.  Most diesel day cabs pay themselves off in less than a year if run effectively.  Also not having a solid network of Megacharging stations means you would have to rework your routes to ensure you wont run into low power needs.  ""But the average route is 250 miles and these trucks can go 500 easy"" Yeah with a simple box trailer.  Most Pepsi trailers have electronic lifts on the back and those can eat up a lot of power and are used at just about every stop on their route, sometimes several times in 1 stop.  So you would be looking at further testing and proofing to make confident decisions on how to utilize the trucks.    


Most trucks start their shifts early in the morning around 4am and are off the road around 1-3pm baring trucks that are making longer hauls.  How do I know this?  Back in my younger years I worked as an over night stocker for a grocery store and the truck would arrived around 5am since we where the 1st stop on the route.  So the trucks would rarely get seen in normal service.  

There you go. Anything else you need covered?"
"It would be nice if we had something in this area.  If i didnt have to drive 600 miles just to get to a Tesla dealership i would already own one.  I could go a week without needing to charge.  I am tired of my current car and would kill for the simplicity of an EV especially a Tesla.  Eventually it would be nice to see these in more places but with the way its looking around here, we have at least 15 years before we can support anything close to this.  "
"I will be one for a long time because i understand what it means to be a logistics coordinator.  I dont work for the trucking companies, they work for us...And no, they wont because the typical day cab pays itself off in about a year and a half.  Not to mention the companies dont own the land their routes follow.  I imagine you think that when a truck driver takes his ""break"" he is going to a truck stop, parking his truck, gets off and walks inside to get something to eat.  When in reality truck drivers log their breaks when they are waiting to be loaded or unloaded.  Which in most cases means their truck is tied up to a dock, on a scale/pump or waiting in line for a dock or scale/pump to open up.  Also, who said they where ignoring it?  Why are they going to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars into a currently unproven still unknowen machine and than have to hope that service and charging solutions are available in an area that is logical to their operation?  Also a lot of truck drivers dont park their truck in a big lot over night, most of them drive the trucks home especially around this area. "

"> due to their mastery of production, they'll probably be able to undercut TSLA too when they enter the market.

There is nothing that the traditional manufacturers have that Tesla can't copy (over time). Besides, Tesla is in the premium market, so they don't have to be as good at manufacturing for a long time. 

Really good manufacturing is good for buyers who are obsessed with cheap, reliable transportation. In other words, stereotypical Toyota buyers. Toyota doesn't have 100% of the market.

What I mean by a surprise competitor is if VW released a ~250 mile EV that is $5000 cheaper than a Model 3, includes a charging network, with autopilot, and is faster than a Model 3 tomorrow in millions of numbers. There is nothing like that from any of the traditional manufacturers until at least 2020, probably later."

"As a former logistician who worked a TON with Walmart, they do. Store deliveries are typically WM Fleet trucks, so your local WM will usually get their product in store by WM trucks, though sometimes they will use CR for that. Getting the product to the distribution centers is another story. They will usually outsource those vendor pickups, and those can be a complete pain in the dick. Also, their online bidding portal (Optibid) is the jankiest system I've ever worked with. "

Even if you want to talk JUST Pepsico, it is but a drop in a very large bucket. It's definitely a step forward but not super significant."
The big issue I see is that true trucking companies are only buying a handful and using a wait and see attitude and to figure out how it will fit into the industry with its limits.  The large adopters it looks like are all production companies that have do some of their own logistics. That does make sense though since they will only be servicing their own facilities to building out the infrastructure is all on them and they are all servicing limited areas.

If you're up for a bit of risk then sell when you feel the hype is wearing off; hype can be very profitable so long as you don't get caught holding the ball when the music stops (maybe maintain a stop-loss around 15% below peak or periodically purchase puts to cover your shares).

No, that's how much they plan to spend to *buy battery cells*.  http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/12/technology/volkswagen-batteries-electric-cars/index.html   
""The German firm estimates it will need more than 150 gigawatt hours of battery capacity annually by 2025.""   
That's the planned output of GF1 + a couple of Panasonic's plants in Japan, *3-5 years later* than Tesla/Panasonic expect to reach that capacity.  Looks like they're shooting for Tesla's ~2020 goal... 5 years later.

> they've also teamed up with Google on their battery production.

https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/07/vw-google-quantum-computers-develop-ev-batteries/   
This is R&D.  Not production.  Until something comes of it, this is PR material.

>To discount the big car makers because they're not named Tesla is foolish.

I did not do this.

> VW alone has promised 50 different EV models will be available by 2025. Tesla right now has what, 6? 7?

Quantity of models is not what matters in replacing the global ICE fleet with EV - quantity of vehicles built and sold does.  That's what I'm getting at here - all these press releases are empty promises without a production quantity goal.

>I think people are not understanding what the last year of promised investments by the big automakers is going to do to the EV market.

I'll believe it when I see it translate to actual competitive cars on the road.  At the moment, GM's Bolt is about the only thing that comes close, but they need to be building and selling it at 10x the volume they are currently."
">  I think people are not understanding what the last year of promised investments by the big automakers is going to do to the EV market.

I think people are not understanding that VW's promises and *their* understanding of their supply chain needs are very different things.

VW attempted to secure supply by getting the miners together and instructing them to supply VW with a standard production rate and set a price. The miners got up and walked out of the room laughing.

Since making those promises you cite, VW got a bloody nose and are now looking at a blank drawing board and scratching their heads."
That...is phenomenal. Why my phone not like this. 
"No idea, I know the lithium is recyclable though so I imagine that replacing them is much cheaper than buying brand new."
"The only problem is that it's not instantaenous.  It takes time to have the loaner delivered, and the trailer switched over.

And then there's the paperwork behind it all, if the loaner also fails to perform in the same way."

If there was an unlimited supply of Tesla tractors *this minute*, it would still take years to replace what is currently on the road.

This is a very risk-averse industry when it comes to change.

Thanks for posting on my behalf.  
"Personally, I think the more relevant number would be how many new trucks Pepsi adds to their fleet annually. Some trucks are in service for [up to 15 years](https://www.statista.com/statistics/185216/age-of-us-light-trucks/)."
The journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step
Well they have to start somewhere...
When wrong argue about the other arguing about semantics.
"Tesla trucks, much like Tesla cars, will not require regular brake maintenance because of regenerative braking. Letting off the accelerator causes the motors on each wheel to provide resistance and act as generators for the battery. No braking required except in hard braking situations. 

Also, the motors do not need to be rebuilt like engines do from time to time because there are fewer opportunities for wear and tear. They're also modular - if one motor wears out you only need to replace one motor, not the entire powerplant. Electric vehicles require far less maintenance than internal combustion vehicles, hands down."
Regenerative braking. The motors on each wheel turn into generators when you let off the accelerator. The resistance provided by the motors is enough to decelerate the truck under most circumstances. Brakes only need to be applied under heavy braking. 
By direct return on investment you mean dividends or something else?
What's pto? 
"But at 3% interest rate that is a. $60,000 spend (loss of interest on the two mil)

Which makes it right up Pepsi's alley.
Ah you're right.
"I don't see how this is an account receivable on any end. 

For Pepsi it's a debit to PPE and a credit to accounts payable if they're using accural accounting and actually plan on buying the damn thing. Tesla uses voodoo accounting but it's probably debit to some deposit account and credit undelivered goods and services.

EDIT: Oh shit Tesla probably has the remainder of the trucks costs in accounts receivable? "
Oh right I thought you were actually one of these tools... Cheers I had a good laugh
"Yeah, nobody was saying you should go through my post history, but rather.. maybe.. just *maybe*.. read the rest of the comment **thread**?"
"No, they cover their payroll tax, which is actually roughly proportional to our income (+ social security + pension fund + misc) taxes. Now we're going to be paying double the amount of taxes we were paying before. Don't even get me started on the IT sector - workers in IT (at eligible companies) with a college degree where the curricula included computer science are eligible to have the income tax (16% of income, out of a total of about 30% in taxes that we pay) waived completely - meaning the pay only 14% tax on their gross salary. However, the new law (technically emergency ordinance, I suppose) changes the income tax from 16 to 10% (to ""lessen"" the blow of having the other 20-odd % transferred from the employer to the employee). Meaning their current benefit is slashed by 6%, and companies would need to increase IT workers' gross wages by 27%, as opposed to 20% for non-IT workers, for net income to remain constant. The other 7% would have to come out of the pocket of the employer this time around, on top of what they're currently paying.

The thing is, that tax break was instituted because people in the IT sector were flocking to first world countries a few years back, and there was a huge problem with retention (and the IT sector is responsible for 6% of Romania's GDP). Guess what IT folks will start doing when their wages drop by 6% overnight **for no fucking reason**? No, I mean that bolded part, because there isn't a single person/entity that benefits from this change. Social security contributions will go down, leaving less money for our social security program, new contracts need to be drafted for each employed person whose wage changes, book-keeping software needs to be updated, etc. The companies can't gain anything, except at the expense of employees, the employees get jack shit (and those on minimum wage will receive less net income overnight, with virtually no chance of that changing), IT workers suddenly see a 6% decrease in their wages for no goddamned reason.

What a time to be alive :/"

"No one knows the cost of the mega charging stations because none are built. But if you want to go this route than I will throw some figures out based on some recent construction we had done to the plant.  We installed a 50k volt breaker system to run a new set of conveyor belt at about 60 amps with a max load of 100.  The now to compare this to a charging station, those push well over 100 amps and you have multiple charging docks that need to be set up. We had to run new line in since our current power solution was not enough to cover that. To do this it cost us roughly $400,000 in materials and labor as well as another 100k to the power company to extend a line out.  For something that will have the capacity to draw as much power as those units put out you are not looking at running a new line. You are looking into tying into a new sub station or more likely having one built. Something that other people talked about being needed to run these stations. To build something like that is around 700k. I know this because this was brought up in the negotiations to help ease further power expansion we might need.


That watts of a motor plays less into the power drain of a system than you think. Amps is what will drain your battery. Those lifts operate at about 10 amps and run longer than 30 seconds. Most ramps take about a minute to lower or raise and this is done multiple times a day and can probably consume close to 100amp/hrs of juice in a given work day.


If you look into the cost of adding the charging stations and mind you that is just 1, not even considering installing these in multiple locations, you are looking at a massive starting cost on top of the cost of the trucks that will need to be covered before the trucks start to make real profit. Also take in mind I didn't include material costs for the station itself which I would estimate to be around 100k.


As for your last statement, I find it hilarious that you say ""you are just stuck in the past"" when no where have I mentioned that these trucks will not work. I just mentioned that Pepsi did not buy these trucks to save money in transport, but to hop on the band wagon and get good pr for the company.  The only thing wrong with tesla is people like you. Who are so ready to call people names and talk down to them like smug like pricks that you make basic discussion about a product unbearable.  You have your head so far up your ass that you physically can not see basic economics of things and only focus on buzz words, phrase and stats you read in the echo champers you swim in.  You are shooting off all of these questions which I have answered as truthfully and unbiased as I can and listed my credentials for knowing what I do know. Yet you on the other hand are just getting pissy because someone doesn't blindly believe in something like you do and understands how large companies view products like this and will use them to best suit their needs. Which in this case is making sure they have a pretty vinyl on them and making sure they are parked where everyone can see them in all of their Pepsi color glory."

"If you're not being facetious, it's Office Space."
"> As an accountant, 2 million is **never** a rounding error. 

I'm not conflating anything.  There are instances in which 2 mil is definitely a rounding error, **especially** at Pepsi.  

Secondly, if Pepsi's Ad expense were off by $2million KPMG (Pepsi's auditors) wouldn't even blink an eye (especially since their Ad expense was ~4 bil in 2015).   



"
"If a staff auditor went to their senior on PepsiCo and said, ""I can get within $2mil of tying the Ad expense to the trial balance, but it's not exact"" The senior is going to say tic that immaterial and keep moving.  The booking/adjusting error is likely around $20mil for PepsiCo.  "
Their budget is in the 100s of billions and a million is a rounding error.
"0-60 time for a fully loaded Tesla Semi is 20 seconds.  For a diesel truck, it's more like 3-5 minutes.  Acceleration and top speed are different things.  They're going to travel at the same top speed, but they will get up to that sure speed much more quickly."
"Yeah, I'm thinking I'm missing something. Diesel trucks are slow because they've been governed to prevent quick acceleration. They can be sped up, but the cost in fuel, safety and damage to the product has been decided to not be worth the time savings."
"I was more thinking about 10-15 years ago, when the negative ecological impacts of the manufacturing of hybrids was less publicized."
"It's not a contradiction.  While the two are tied together, one could easily no give a shit about the environment and only care about their wallet."

"I'm not sure you would spend billions on tires and there are plenty of reasons to need the tires beyond ""cornering the market"". They will need the tires eventually and that is all they need to say. That is what makes it hard to prove. The law only works in cases were there is no reason why you would need that much of that product. Think water and food and then charging excessive amounts on it. In this case, there really is no law that will hold up unless the company is stupid enough to say in an email which they don't completely erase (and a court actually goes after them enough to even try and find in the first place) that they ONLY bought the tires to stick it to their competition. Otherwise, you can make an argument that they needed them.

My point stands, it is hard to prove. "
"Different batteries, different charging system."
"Thermal management is a huge part of this.  Batteries degrade if they get too hot or too cold while charging or discharging.  Your phone deals with whatever temperature it's subjected to, which is why people come back to dead phones after leaving them on the dashboard in the summer or overnight in the winter."
"> Why my phone not like this

Phone batteries are prismatic cells built to fit inside a thin phone. They're also usually a single cell, whereas the Tesla batteries are made of hundreds of the more robust cylindrical cells, which allows some individual cells to fail while still delivering power. "
"Phone companies want you to abuse your battery so it dies - then they can sell you the latest model phone, and consumers are happy with that.

Consumers are not happy to let their car battery die, so they take care of their battery and tend to use it as instructed."
"No thermal control, no state if charge control."

"UI sucks for sure. But it’s a lot better than any other competitors website. Try shopping on Walmart.com it’s hard to tell if your buying from Walmart or from a 3rd party. It loads like shit. Recently it’s gotten better. Home Depot has a decent website and a great app but it’s cheaper and far easier to just go into the store. Lowe’s deliberately made their website suck to trick people into buying shit. Target isn’t bad but the UI is also bad. Sears well there is a reason they are going out of business. Amazon is atleast the cleaner option. 


Honestly my reason for Amazon is simple. If I go to Walmart and I need to compare product reviews I have three options. I could read someone’s blog or an article about the product and wonder if it’s a paid advertisement. I could watch videos on YouTube (similar concern but also not someone I want to do in Walmart without headphones). Or I can go on amazon and see people’s reviews. The added benefit of going on amazon is price checking. There has been multiple times I can order something on prime and have it same day/next day for $10-20 cheaper. It’s hard to say not to that. If I have an issue with a product amazons customer service is a lot better than any other store. I used to be a manager at Walmart and let me tell you their return policy is complicated and ridiculous. Amazon has a pretty much no questions asked return policy. I ordered a hitch receiver a couple weeks ago and it was just a poor fit (should have went Reese but I went Curt) and instead of making me lug a 100lb piece of metal to fedex and pay a ridiculous amount of shipping they told me just to throw it out and refunded my money.

">Today, Swift generates over $4 billion in revenue and operates nearly 20,000 trucks.

Swift’s terminal network has grown to over forty full service facilities in both the continental United States and Mexico. Swift owns 100% of Trans-Mex, a Nuevo Laredo, Mexico based carrier. Swift offers border crossing services at all major Mexican border crossings. Swift maintains a presence in every Canadian province each day. Swift is unquestionably the largest full-truckload motor carrier in North America.

"0-60 of a truck with a gross weight of 80,000lbs is measured in minutes.  Obviously most cargo isn't going to be at the legal limit like that, but the exact numbers aren't the point.

Semi trucks hauling more than a few tons cause slowdowns entering highways, at red lights, and when passing.

 I can recall that when hybrids first became big people viewed them as an ecological savior, though it seemed to me like that the feeing wore off after a while.

"Right, which is why I said after five years...  Solar is continuing to get cheaper, so I suspect the cost of recharging will make electric trucks even more favorable by that time."
I'd consider the point in time where they start to be phased in to be partial acceptance.
"From the Rolling Stone interview. 

""In order to understand the essential truth of things,"" he theorizes, ""I think you can find it in The Onion and occasionally on Reddit."""
This comment chain is something else
I thought straight trucks were the number to compare to
"There is computerized traction control in commercial vehicles now, and has been for years, nothing new.

I've seen lots of manufacturers claims over the years that only existed on test tracks and skid pads but are not supported in real world application.

I haven't seen any data for their tractors being more difficult to jack-knife, if you have any data source I'd love to see it.


If Tesla can prove in real operation what they claim, they will sell their vehicles, but...


 Tesla has yet to state what the weight of their OTR configuration will be, current speculation is that they are too heavy for Class 8.

Pepsi will be using daycabs, not sleeper units, so they will be ok weight-wise, but for  OTR long-haul they need to cut weight on the tractor.

Trucking companies won't buy anything that means they need to carry less freight.

The only maintenance difference will be of the electric motors over diesel, all else will remain the same cost.





























"
"Companies with valuations so high that their revenue stream could not possibly provide a reasonable dividend (even if they wanted to) are purely speculative investments.

I'm not into market speculation.

Of course, I'm also effectively FIRE'd and have to live on my current assets for the next ~55 years; so risk is at the forefront of my investment decisions."
"You too, i'm just saying your expectations aren't realistic and not how reddit works, if you want someone converse with someone, take into account they saw your comment and replied, then went on to another part of reddit. also comment aren't expended indefinitely by default, you see the top ones in each thread and you don't expend every branch to see if that person said something to someone else before commenting to someone, that's why people sometimes put EDIT's on a comment that draws attention, to avoid having to repeat themselves. 


 "
It's pretty close to a documentary.
Reminder that this Friday on Reddit it’s Hawaiian shirt day.
"That's also tenuous at best. According to Gondor's Generally Accepted Auditing Principles (GGAAP):

1. One does not simply look at total revenue and apply an error rate to expenses.
2. One does not simply ignore materiality.
3. One does not simply apply a 0.5 to 1.0% threshold in all cases. (See #2)

I'm not sure it matters, but no I'm not currently an auditor. I did work for Internal Audit previously and spent a large part of last year with external auditors."
"Ah, I just remember the slew of kids who had them for the mileage that their parents helped them buy.  Especially since for like 40% of the school home was 400+ miles away.  Meanwhile half of my friends and I were in cars that could drink before us."
">  don’t really have any hard evidence that this was because of a study showed they were horrible for the environment 

No problems... there was just such a report in something that called itself a 'newspaper'. They referenced environmental damage the Prius production had done in Sudbury, Canada.

Thing is, the damage they were refering to, and showed photographs of, was from the decades old nickel mining at Sudbury.... and which had been cleaned up and environmentally rehabilitated years before the Prius went into production.

It was a lie. That paper was then court-ordered to print a retraction and apology.

But - once something exists on the internet, it never goes away and the same bollox keeps getting regurgitated whenever a bored journalist or blogger wants some clicks.

Here is a piece on how green the lifespan of a Tesla currently is, and is expected to be, with plenty of references

https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-greener-think-getting-greener-look-manufacturing/"
"I argue that the concept that cars are works of art is legitimate, but the concept of choosing a vehicle for any reason other than it's practical applications is as ridiculous as smoking cigarettes because you think it makes you look cool. It's a brash display of wealth that is at best gaudy and at worst despicable"
EVERYTHING WE DO IS DRIVEN BY DRIVERS WANTED FORD TOUGH ALWAYS NEVER BEFORE BETTER IDEA THE FUTURE OF AUTOMAASDFJLSAKDFJA;SDFJKSDL;FJ
You've obviously never worked in a corporate job. Email is king. And I'm insulting you because you are being intentionally obtuse.
No I think I heard it was someplace else somewhere else
"Are you missing the part where there's an independent motor powering each wheel? That's not traction control. It's quite a lot different. 

I have seen no evidence that the Tesla truck cant haul 80,000 pounds. 

I'm not a trucker but I think you're vastly underestimating this machine. 

Please provide evidence that electric vehicles have the same operating costs as traditional. It's common knowledge that that's not the case. Curious where you're getting your information"
"All investment is speculation as it all realised on a prediction of an unknown future.

But I asked a direct question and you weren’t able to give a direct answer"
"I agree with you but there is another group of people who buy a particular car not because of how they think others will preceptive them, which is kinda sad, but because they themselves love the way it looks, the way it sounds, they way it handles, the quality of  materials chosen for the interior (not cheap plastic), the sense of history and pedigree, and simply for the joy that comes from driving it.  People make the same choice when buying designer jeans. More expensive, but usually better materials, better design, better fit and feel and so on.  Yes you are the same amount of ""not naked"" when wearing pants from walmart, but the designers are in another class."
*zoom zoom*
"I handle international contracts for a fortune 500 company. I do both the financials and work with the legal side for legalities on international contracts. Guess I don't know what the fuck I am talking about though. 

You clearly have no idea how real world business works. Why admit to anything in email? You either work for fucking morons or you are just simply talking out your ass. You keep shit like this verbal for a reason... 

Edit: Just so we are very fucking clear on shit. https://imgur.com/a/DPjUp"
"80K is the max gross, tractor, trailer and the load it carries. 

The tractor/trailer I'm sitting in this moment weighs 36180K with half empty fuel tanks. I can legally scale 43820K in freight.

If the tractor/trailer combination is a heavier configuration, you would need to cut weight on the freight you haul.

It isn't a matter of what the tractor is able to do, almost any tractor on the road can pull loads exceeding max gross.

I used to be permitted for 127400K and pulled it with an International with a 350HP Cummins motor.  

As far as I know there are no numbers available yet to compare cost of operation to, but that will be the biggest selling point.

"
"> But I asked a direct question and you weren’t able to give a direct answer

I did try to give a direct answer but I'll reword it and add the missing detail. The question asked doesn't lend itself to a Yes/No answer because both answers are wrong.

The dividend paid doesn't matter one lick. What I look for is whether they *could* pay a reasonably sized dividend if corporate priorities were changed. A company investing in expansion may not pay a dividend but imagine for a moment that they halted expansion, acquisitions, moved to minimal R&D, etc. Can they pay one now? How big would it be? How reliable would it be?  In effect, what's my share of the profit on sustained operations over the next decade. Worded another way, how much cash can investors suck out without changing the valuation (either positively or negatively).

As a bonus, ""reasonably sized"" isn't straight forward either. It varies with the risk of the companies execution capabilities but also my exposure to a given industry and market."
"I'm not arguing that those people don't exist. I'm arguing that they are objectively wrong and that their materialistic obsessions are as wrong as hurting others or not sharing. These people are being robbed of a true experience of life by vainly surrounding them with the ""art"" that you described. Real art touches humanity and explores the concept of what it means to be human. You're describing people falling for marketing schemes designed to create dopamine releases that influence them into buying a product so that they can get more hits from the dopamine machine. If that were art then so is jerking off."
I have a business degree too. Here's proof: https://imgur.com/a/DPjUp
"But you still seem to be deflecting. It appears your core premise for investing is an ability for a company to issue dividends.

So which companies don’t issue dividends, hmmm:

Berkshire Hathaway
Amazon
Google
Merck
Pfizer

All huge and successful companies and all who don’t prioritise dividends. Why? Because all are reinvesting their excess back into their companies. Google and Amazon are good examples of tech companies that are still in huge growth phases and are sitting back and letting the cash roll in.

So if you say Tesla is a poor investment you are also saying the above companies would also have been."
"It is objectively wrong to get enjoyment from a physical thing and doing so is equal to assaulting people? edit: Also, real art is what you say it is. Got it."
"I'm not a car guy. I will get a Tesla/electric car and preferably a self-driving car as they become accessible. However, I can certainly respect the engineering that goes into one. If you look at them in a certain sense, they are works of art. The design of the exterior can be really cool, the interior can make you feel awesome.

Would I ever get one? No. I'll never own anything more powerful than a civic or Camry. I don't like what performance cars stand for, but I can still appreciate the design of such a machine. "
Except mine has my name on it and yours has my name on it too.
"I need to start reading comment threads more closely

[Heh](https://i.imgur.com/5X1SOo3.gif)"
"You've not read what I wrote or I did a very poor job of conveying my thoughts.

Either way, since information is not actually being exchanged in this conversation, I'll wish you and your portfolio my best."
"Definition of art for English Language Learners. : something that is created with imagination and skill and that is beautiful or that expresses important ideas or feelings  
  
If cars cost 5 bucks I wouldn't care. The problem is that there are people spending 100k on a ""cool"" car while people who weren't so lucky starve and die and can't find work. It's rude, ugly, and disgusting"
I have an unpopular opinion and I'll continue to despise expensive car owning people for who and what they are as I've described. Your opinion seems reasonable to me. I draw the line at actually spending money on one of these things. It makes you as much of an ass as buying a golden toilet seat. (see: drumpf)
[deleted]
Except one of the guys above accused the other of never working in a corporate job. The degree kind of demonstrates how unlikely that would be. The one also called the other dumb even though the other dude seems to be right. The potato guy is all over the place and seems to have no clue what he is talking about on many topics to be honest. 
Yep time to back away from Tesla is a poor investment because it doesn’t issue dividends 
"1. I argued that a car fits perfectly the definition you just gave. Hence my argument
2. wealth redistribution, global economics had nothing to do with my original statement that some people enjoy cars rather than just seeing them as a means of transport like a bus or a donkey can be. Maybe having personal possessions is a crime against humanity but that is a discussion for another time.
3. there is no reason to be a condescending ass."
"Cars are designed from someone's imagination using a skill and can absolutely be beautiful and very, very often express an idea or feeling: most often that idea or feeling is power.

By your very definition, cars can be art."
there's lots of reasons to flame people who are wrong
"Also, everything is connected. If you think global economics has nothing to do with people enjoying cars you're also extra wrong and thus get even more flaming"
"I wonder if someone would be up for giving this the 'pimp my ride' type treatment.  I'm thinkin..

* Upgraded motor
* Extended range

Great color BTW :)"

"one of the very first things I bid on at ebay in 99 was a battery powered mini ferarri from the 60s, some guy in california had it listed for a friend and didnt know much about it, and I blew up his email every day of the auction for more pictures and size questions. 

really what it came down to was, I wanted to drive it. I didnt fit, but that was ok because I didnt win (went over 4k if I remember) but seeing verne tool around in the tesla brought it all back. why oh why am I 6 foot high? even that tesla looks like my 5 1 wife would fit. 

years later I spotted another of the mini ferarris, it was in the godfather II outside when michael is visiting his lake tahoe home in winter. it might have even been the very same one, it sure looked exactly the same. "
Lost opportunity to label speed setting to sport and insane. Elon: please fix this!

Thank you for sharing Verne! Really enjoyed watching you unbox it and use it. 
This guy sure knows the way of drifto

Aw dayum! When he put it in twodicrous mode without even trying the peronemance mode at all to get a feel for it first! Them balls on this guy!
"Rip, you brought  a smile to so many people"
Rest in peace brother. 
Got this as a referral reward for my kid on Christmas. It chewed up a section of my hardwood flooring.
Verne is so great.  Remember when he got drunk and pissed in the corner on that one reality show?
Best thing I've seen today.

Was he in Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park - USA?
Enjoyed the video Verne! Happy Holidays!

hey @mistersavage where you at?
There are upgraded batteries for it from Radio Flyer. I think the biggest benefit would be rubber tires.
Yeah upgraded motor and and batteries plus the rubber tires. /u/mistersavage can save the day!
"Your edit made me smile, but sad at the same time.

Smile because you went back to edit it, sad because he’s gone."
And in true pimp my ride style give it an ICE. 
Dude... that edit hit me hard... so sad.

Don't forget speed control. Looks like it's just off or full speed.
Whaat!! It's only been 3 months!!
"To get comments and reactions like this, is one of the reasons why I love doing what I do. Thanks for the nice words and I'm glad I could put a smile on your face"
"You should be happy to know that you added some cheer to Verne.  Sad to report that he passed away today, but you helped make his life a little better."
[Belgium you say?](https://youtu.be/EzkzCSwhsx8?t=1m14s)
"Never forget that you put a smile on Verne's face, and thanks for taking the time to share it. I struggled with depression for much of my teen and young adult years, and it sucks when someone you admire loses their battle (Robin Williams was really difficult for me). Obviously we're internet strangers, but I'm thinking of you; stay strong!"
"Hey, I just saw your edit today as I skimmed Verne's posts.  Fellow depression sufferer, though mine is more related to incessant self criticism... but regardless.

I've only survived my bouts of it through my connections with other people.  It sounds like you made a real connection with a wonderful man, and maybe feel his loss in a way no one else does.

So, bawl your eyes out - but connections like yours are what makes life worth living for all of us, if nothing else hearing your story makes me smile because the positive effect on the world one person can have is absolutely tremendous.

I'm not too great a conversationalist, but I can listen - so shoot me a message if you wanna talk."
"Keep on keepin on man we're all here with you. Im a pm away, anytime"
"You should watch the Austin Powers movies too, they're pretty funny "
"Hang in there. As a fellow (former) depressed person, i can tell you that chances are things will change sooner or later. Don't know when, or *if*, but chances are good.

Hang in there. Much love. "
And you were one of the last Reddit comments he replied to. 
Google “Austin Powers”
"I hope you're supported where you are, I think Verne appreciated your presence as much as you did his judging by his response to you. Hang in there, when everything looks like shit and you think you can't go on just sleep on it, things always look better in the morning. "
"Hi friend, I hope you're doing well. I didn't have a connection to Verne like you do and I don't suffer from depression, and I'm not a Belgian, but I am human. As a fellow human we share much more than medical history, nationality, or even life experiences. We share emotions such as love, compassion, empathy and a desire to learn more about complete strangers. I know it's cliche and I've never said this to anyone, but I want to be a better person. Your words in your edit about losing someone you never even met or truly knew that helped you cope with your situation moved and inspired me in a way that I can't explain. They were raw and pure and if you ever want to talk, as cliche as that sounds, I'd love to learn more about you and chat. Hope you are well and please take care of yourself because you inspire people that you have never met and that you might not ever know, just as Verne touched your life."
"Hey man, very sorry to hear about your depression. But reading the message you initially wrote to Verne, I can tell you you're absolutely not worthless like you might think on some days. You brought him joy and comfort in tough times, just like he did for you. People really miss out on all the interactions they could have with you. I can be very depressed sometimes, it's getting better but I can still feel like complete shit for about a week before it gets better. And what ALWAYS put me out of it is by talking to people. Not especially about my depression, but just forcing myself to interact with them even if I want to avoid it in the first place. It can be family, colleagues, friends, someone you already have trust in. It's not easy, it's sometimes awkward, but I end up feeling better than I was. I'm sorry you met people who abused you. That's horrible and despicable. But don't give up on people. Be selective maybe, don't trust people from the get go but learn to know them and trust them over time. The vast majority of people have all the best intentions towards you.
If you feel like talking, feel free to hit me up, I'll be glad to help you out the best I can :)"
You never saw Austin Powers movies?

Ditto. This at least would be a Tesla I could afford.

That's awesome. Congrats and can't wait to follow your experiences over the next couple years! 
How long did it take? Can you give us approximate reservation number?  Gives us an idea of how many orders. 
"What's the total price on these? Also, what are you going to be using yours for? Are you currently a truck driver that owns their own semi?"

Congratulations.  I think it's going to be an incredible vehicle.
Has anyone heard about the price on this?

Any idea what the range on this thing will be when you aren’t towing anything?
Just wow! Congrats with your Tesla
I am glad to see a lease road hauler ordering one of these. I have been super sceptical about the viability of these on lease roads and I hope you can provide some insight once you get it out here. As soon as they make a pick up that can survive the patch I will be switching over from my diesel MTC to electric MTCs. Cheers northern brother.
I'll be putting down a deposit the first day for the Pickup.
"Please do a video review when you get it! 

I live close to a highway, and I hear trucks all night. They're louder than I thought. But this would be awesome. "
"Look at the axles. It was no doubt for the sake of aerodynamics, but a production version would have to have it raised or else the semi simply cannot operate as is. Particularly in [1]hilly terrain, even trucks today can get stuck on the crest of a very steep hill (it does happen in the industry). Very simply put, the production version cannot be as aerodynamic.

[2]Snow will also be an issue with low clearance. This might be a big problem in Canada, the northern US, Alaska, and northern Europe. Russia too, if Tesla ever intends to sell to the Russians. Also, notice that the rear wheels are concealed. This could be an issue [3]if the vehicle is stuck in the snow (ever see a car get stuck in the snow)? Trucks have more ground pressure and as a result, are at a larger risk for “getting stuck"".

There must also be the ability to attach [4]moose bumpers. That is necessary in Canada and northern US. I did not see anything that would imply that a bumper provision was available."
"Just interested in what, if anything, Tesla told you about getting the Megacharger infrastructure in place before you take delivery.

Did they stipulate there will be a rollout of Megachargers on your trucking route before your estimated delivery date?

If they don't have the Megacharger infrastructure in place in time, what will you do with your order? I mean, that vehicle won't be practical for you unless you can get it juiced at speed (and I don't know if it's even compatible with Supercharger plugs - or parking spaces!)

Very interested to hear what you've been told and your thoughts"
Where are you going to park it? Have you a big driveway or are you hiring parking somewhere?!
what options do you get to spec into it?
"so its Loblaws and you in Canada as far as I can see, they're eastern.

so guess that means you're the guy in western Canada they'll be watching to figure out where megachargers need to go.

I'm guessing Revelstoke, Golden on hwy1. Trail on hwy3 (they need super chargers on 3 anyway)"
"I love everything except the wheels, they look uncool and  out of place imo"

"With your post history and your location are you at all worried about the battery life in the cold weather?

That truck looks sexy AF. And I never thought I'd ever say anything like that about *a truck*.
"Waiting for someone to buy one and try to street park it in the Bronx, because it’s “baller” "
The front (cab) looks like a aerodynamic storm trooper helmet. 
"Truck tires separate often, so if a 150 dollar tire tears up a thousand dollars worth of body work every once in a while the body work is useless. But that streamlined bodywork makes things a lot more efficient. Imagine a world where all cars had covered tires like the 50's sci fi comics had. We'd have great gas mileage, but the practicality isn't there. Hence why the first car to give it a go since the fifties was the first Prius. But even that didnt stick. "
"Tesla should team up w/ Uber, and give owner-ops a lease-to-own option  as they move freight through Uber."
This seems cool and I'm sure the range will be published eventually per load. My question is why even do a digital rendering with covered rear tires? We all know that'll never happen. I'm not a trucker though so I may be wrong. But I've seen truck tires explode... seems like a covered rear tire is a safety hazard at best.
"Are they all sold out? Just checked reservation page and there was no link for the semi.
"
It doesn’t look like it could drive over stuff on the road which is inevitable.
why do you need a truck when the roadster is available?
Am I the only one surprised someone bought the Tesla Semi that isn't a corporation?
"Wow.  I didn't know that.  W/ the entire Tesla movement as a manufacturer, it makes perfect sense.  Not to mention the fuel economy working in their favor.  They will definitely become Uber's worst nightmare.  "

OP IS a trucker.
How?
Umm...  there's a couple working trucking driving around now.  Haven't you seen the unveiling?
Go back to sleep grandpa.
"Look at his post history.  He is very active on the trucking subreddit but also talks a lot about video games etc...

It's not some corporate social media account, this guy is a true Redditor "
"Honestly if the math made sense it could be made in someone's garage.

"This is funny.

Are you a Grease monkey for Volvo?"
I can't wait to see yours set up as the Mad Max offroad machine it will be.
"I know you own a trucking company and since you put money down, you must have all the information, so if you can please respond to my comment. Unless I looked up the wrong company... SEI Logistics specializes in ice road hauling and dedicated mine transport In the Canadian Northwest.

I am not trying to be a dick but to me this does not seem like a good fit other than living up to your mantra (which is great btw).

Can you please answer the following?

-  Are there different configurations? Being in the Canadian Northwest, with the roads (and not so much roads) you will be driving over, does the lack of significant ground clearance (as shown by the pictures of the truck and in the one you posted) give you any pause?  I see this potentially getting stuck or damaged quite quickly. Especially if you are doing mine transport and ice road trucking, both of which have at least some parts of their journey on unpaved ""roads"" that aren't exactly always level. 

- The batteries in this truck are at the very least between 800kWh and 1000kWh. How do you plan on providing that much energy (for charging) in a short amount of time, assuming this is going to be a daily driver?

- Doesn't it get really cold where you are? Is that any kind of problem?

Are you truly going to be using this for daily hauling or is this for marketing?

Again, not trying to be a dick or doubt you, I am genuinely curious.



"
Will this be your primary truck then? Is there any info on Sleeper cab for them? How many truck drivers do you talk to who are interested in driving the tesla truck?
Are you sure that the Tesla can do what your current truck does? Under those circumstances? 
"Is it driverless at all? Or will future updates make it driverless, could you just nap or play Pokemon during most of your jobs?"

A quick question. How the hell do you put snow chains on this rig?
Whereabouts in Canada will your route be? Would be cool to see your fleet go by and know it's yours
My dad's been driving truck since he was 17(now 53) I wish he was excited about these as you and everyone else is. 
They will drive themselves in a few years...
And what is the price? 
Do truckers usually buy their own truck or do most use a company truck? Also how long does it usually take to pay off a average priced truck? 
"Our Elon, who is atop the Gigafactory, hallowed be thy Instagram celebrity.

So the price is already confirmed? I thought it was only a estimate.
Took me a sec. *had faith  
Does it really matter? That's only the deposit right… everyone will be paying the same. 
Sometimes.  Is that bad?  
"Yes, why couldn't you?"

"If you can, wire it with ethernet and set up a wireless access point close to where you are going to park the Tesla Semi. That helps a lot with uploading autopilot data and downloading the latest software updates.

Oh, and if the radar is below the windshield you have to be careful where to place that bumper. It could mess with the radar."
"if I understood it correctly they're planning to sell chargers for logistics yards.

kinda like home chargers and Mchargers would go where you'd need them on highways.

might be a good question to ask them. do you get one included and can you buy more?"
"You probably already know, but it really helps to pre-heat while still on the charger. That way you lose no energy to get the battery to the optimal temperature. Luckily this can be done by the Tesla app."
Yup. Great design.
"Exactly.  But without the (broker) middleman.  I'm one of those owner-ops who decided to become a certified master broker, just so I could save/ make some extra money.  After going to school, I realized that they're really in the way.  These customers actually prefer to work with a carrier over a broker.  Unless the carrier has an in-house brokerage firm."
Well I assumed you were just a regular guy who bought a semi truck just to drive. I thought the Semis were targeted for large companies and businesses.
Can you spec 425 cat squsher fronts with dual steering boxes? To get more than 5500 kg on the steering axle.

"Not OP but IIRC the last time he posted he said he doesn’t need the full range, so any reduced range due to conditions and/or weather likely won’t be a dealbreaker."

Does the million mile warranty have a lot to do with company decision to buy it? "
"Plus it can haul 80,000 pounds worth of extra batteries in the trailer."
I wasn’t really talking about range more like the trucks in his posts look well equipped whereas the Tesla looks like it can’t do anything other than pull a trailer

Truck rhymes with fuck. 
Go work for a different company then?
That's because of the E.U length regulations. If you want to haul a bigger load your truck has to be smaller.
Eu has a regulation for how long the vehicle can be (tractor + trailer). The US rules only regulates how long the trailer can be. 
You can't compare new and used trucks in this way. Those 30-50k truck were new and expensive at one point. These Tesla semis will depreciate too (although maybe not as much/ or as quickly). New technologies often have early adopters who pay a premium at the beginning when the tech is new and harder to produce etc

"An interesting point in the article is that Anheuser-Busch does not actually own their fleet of 750 trucks, they are owned by 3rd party carriers and contracted by AB. 

>“We put the reservations down so we can prioritize our place in line,” Mr. Sembrot said. “We don’t know who the carrier is going to be in two to three years when these things are actually produced.”

This seems unusual to me. I would think that in general, AB would decide on carriers based on whatever terms the carrier is offering. It seems unlikely that AB would specify to any carriers what trucks they should operate, rather they would leave that decision up to the carrier for the carrier to optimize their own profitability. For AB to reserve the Tesla Semis indicates that they would have concerns that their carriers may not be forward-thinking enough to place their own reservations, and AB doesn't want to risk losing out on the opportunity because of that. They understand that the Semi is likely to be heavily production constrained, so there will be a significant benefit to reserving early. WSJ said they reserved before the unveiling, yet would not disclose the reservation prices. It wouldn't surprise me if at least a few of their reservations were founder's editions. "
This Tesla's for You!
"2020 they are aiming at roughly 150GWh that’s 1.5million model 3s. However they may only have capacity for 1million without another car factory so they have capacity for 50,000 trucks in 2020, it will increase with additional factories but that is the top end for 2020 for now. Bottom end is as few as they like. Looks like 1000 a year is easily supportable, I hope they aim for 50,000"
"I might, and I mean might, even drink a bud for that. Maybe. "
Is this the largest single reservation yet?
"Man, it's really awesome how all these companies are reserving Tesla Semi's. I can only hope that Tesla doesn't screw this up via delays or QC issues. It's one thing for a customer having to deal with that. It's another when big businesses get involved."
"Makes sense, these trucks are perfect for local delivery routes.  And I would bet good money that the driver will be able to make one extra stop a day, due to the Tesla trucks quick and nimbleness in the city.

That one extra stop a day is HUGE, bigger savings than even the electricity vs gas."
"I would expect nothing less from a European company.

Were it still American owned I would half expect them to be advocating for coal powered semis if only to pander to their demographic."
Fuck I hope some of those come to their Fort Collins brewery. I would love to see these zipping around my town. 
"I've got real estate next to roads frequented by long haul diesel truckers, I can join together segments to make great plots for truck stop V3 charging stations, even making room for solar grid and battery stacks, it's next to the international power grid lines too, does anyone have a link or a lead to who I can talk to so I can talk with the Tesla people who scope these locations?

"With what we have seen from Tesla's Model 3 manufacturing, I wonder how long it will take them to build just 1 semi, let alone fill all the order they will get"
AB's carriers may not have the capital to tie up reservations of the trucks that may or may not hit their expectations or ship date.  AB can foot the bill for the reservations and then sell the new trucks to their carriers with the promise that AB facilities will be equipped with charging stations. 
"When you're working for a big customer like that as an ""independent contractor"" you're not really all that independent. They're gonna have their fingers in all sorts of details, sometimes up to the point that you're just legal camouflage for operations they could run themselves but would like to have separated for liability, tax, or legal reasons. Breweries in particular have a lot of practice in controlling ""independent"" distributors."
With the business that AB brings they decide the terms. They have huge leverage. If the carrier doesn't want to take on those terms there will be other carriers jumping on the opportunity.
"It's just holding a place in line. There absolutely will be a shipping company that snaps up those trucks and with it, AB business."
"AB's local distributors are Mom&Pop businesses (of varying complexities) that simply own trucks, warehouses and make deliveries. AB may require them to get the trucks all decaled up with Bud branding designs but that is just a requirement AB has for distributors to win their contract. These are very long-term contracts - 5-10 years and probably, even longer. Unless it was already in the Contract, you can't just go in and now require that distributors use electric vehicles 

It would take a lot of personal investment for these distributors to figure out how they would would sell off their old trucks (tax consequences --> especially with the tax reform going on), and then renovate/upgrade their facilities for Tesla charging. 

Also - Distributors may be waiting on Gov't to figure out what kind of tax incentives they can get. "
"I wonder if they are reserving to hedge against California's pollution/MPG rules.  

They are fairly strict now (Cali always one of the EV compliance car states), and might get tighter in later years . . . ."
"What's 40 x $200,000?  :)"
"I used to work for AB's logistics department.  It's not surprising - they've got a long list of carriers, some of which have dedicated fleets under contract with AB.  They're the 'preferred carriers' that get the bulk of the movement from brewery to wholesaler.

It's cheaper for them to pay by load (and they don't pay a lot) than it is to own a truck and pay for its maintenance along with the cost and space of maintenance/support staff.  Big trucking firms are going to have all that set already.
"
I was about to say our town has 2 huge district companies that literally do nothing but deliver beer and other soft drinks to stores around town. Why would AB buy these?! 
So this hurts the small business man. Seems like a pattern is forming. 
"I would assume that they are anticipating the trucks to become driverless, which would reduce the need to outsource to carriers."
"I work in the receiving area of the specific brewery that Tesla reps are visiting next week to decide where the best place to place the charging stations are.

Long story short, we use Warner trucks, and honestly they're one of the shittiest companies that can deliver. We lost most of our fleet drivers during the hurricane which put us in an overload shutdown for almost a couple weeks, causing thousands of dollars in wasted product we couldn't ship in time. One guy got ran over and died just before Christmas because carelessness, and the driver's like to take it upon themselves to expedite their time by bypassing our security check ins and sometimes even forcing our unloading can conveyor bays in manual mode which puts our actual workers in a huge jeoprady."

"> Makes sense, these trucks are perfect for local delivery routes. 

Nope. The local AB truck has one drive axle and is not a 80,000 lb GVWR vehicle.

AB would be looking at the current Tesla Semi to not run local routes. They would use it to make deliveries to distribution centers that unload with fork lifts."

Good point as well and would still be an indicator of AB feeling this is potentially too big of an opportunity to miss out on due to carrier limitations.
"To an extent. The terms still need to show a path to profitability for at least one carrier. But your point is why it is interesting that AB is doing this, because standard operating procedure would seem to me to be to just go to the market and use their leverage to obtain the best deal. Obviously carriers with the Tesla Semi will offer the best deal because it is the cheapest option. But AB isn't just waiting to select from those carriers, they are making sure they have the Tesla Semi to at least learn about instead of expecting a carrier to give them that option."
I believe Daimler is the market leader and sells about 80k per year. I'm not sure if that is just US or internationally.
I believe the entire market is 160k trucks a year.

"If nothing else, it’s a solid PR opportunity. With AB already using their trucks (or the old wagons) in commercials from time to time, they might also see this as a way to ride the PR wave of the Tesla Semi and generate a goodwill halo effect."
"I see AB doing some ""in-house"" testing, determining the true costs, etc. and then telling their carriers to meet a certain price based on that.  They either submit competitive bids and lose money, upgrade and compete, or go under from a lack of customers."
If the trucks are eventually autonomous and driverless and can be centrally managed then it eventually gets to the point where a separate business is not providing much value.
"With the model behind the Tesla Semi. If I was AB I would really consider taking on the entire expensive of the semi with maintenance and energy consumption, and getting some kind of rate from individual carriers (Pay them an hourly, put them on staff, etc.). Sort of like an airline model and pilots.

Carriers won't need to take on any kind of investment, and they're only paid for their time. It could be a win win scenario."

"If your question is about SpaceX and Telsla being their own customers, then yes.  

Tesla can get great savings with the T Semi when taking ‘power-trains’ from NV to CA.  Also, the ride back to NV is super cheap because the trailers are empty.  The mountainous terrain between NV and CA is perfect for heavy loads because NV starts high and ends in CA at sea-level.  Lots of regenerative braking saves big money.

SpaceX does not transport as much cargo as a growing car company.  :)

Btw ‘power-trains’ are the batteries and electric motors installed on a skid that gets shipped whole from NV to CA.  10’s on a truck to be delivered and quickly put into the Model 3 assembly line."

Surely that's true of any manufacturing company.

"Plenty of distribution point to retail trucks are full size. They just don't have sleepers. Tesla didn't build a sleeper yet. It seems geared to local deliveries first. (ie under 150 miles).

For example, the acceleration rates they were touting - that saves signifigant time only where there are frequent stops (ie city driving) as opposed to long distance where they might come to a complete stop only 1-3 times per shift.

It definitely sounded like they were aiming for local in the first round, even if it is a capable truck for long hauls, in general"
"They keep wanting to apply the fact that electric trucks will do better in stop and go traffic, and at slower speeds, however you're right. The semi is designed for full trailers which usually do regional or longer routes. Eventually they'll get it."
"I suppose they're grasping the key concept that if Tesla can build 6x4 class 8 tractor, then there isn't a lot of truck markets they couldn't enter.  Intracity delivery would be easy."
"Primarily due to how much fuel is wasted idling in traffic.

This is the use case that Gas/Electric hybrids excelled at and EVs do even better with.

While yes, Tesla did build a solid long haul truck. However there is excellent opportunity if they build a local-route configuration as well. Charging at the depot so ""fuel"" costs are centralized/controlled (no borrowing gas card for personal truck) and better use of energy with around town work."

"No sane company would keep the trucks empty on the return trips. In trucking, there is the concept of ""backhaul"" where you get a completely different load headed back to cover the costs. In Tesla's case they might contract out loads from CA -> NV or they might use them themselves to move raw materials to the GF. 

If a truck is rolling without a load someone is doing something wrong.

Then you guys should keep your mouths shut about things you don't know anything about unless you have questions and want to learn more. 
"This is the key point that people keep overlooking. The 300 mile truck is still built like a long haul semi in terms of specs, but compare it to local delivery trucks in terms of size, maneuverability, speed and ease of use and it blows them out of the water in most cases. 
We will see smaller variants down the road for sure, either from Tesla or someone else, but until then the 300 mile truck still makes a lot of sense for local work."

"No, I mean take the risk that they're not financially viable. Like COO is too much or the insurance is too high or something.

Yes but what I do is different than 90% of the trucking world

Maybe I'm missing something."
All i hear is we have a specialty and that sounds positive
"I wasn't trying to be rude, i simply asked a question after the 2nd time he posted the link trying to defend his 160k position after someone who mentioned the 250-300k that is in OPs article. 

the 250k was from two years ago. And the economy has been growing since then, you don't know if it's an exaggeration until we get 2016 data or have some preliminary 2017 data.

That was a good joke.

"Tesla, if you’re listening, please please please make a smaller version in the 33,000 gvw range for local delivery box trucks. 250 mile range is more than I need. Anything to get away from these damn dirty and unreliable diesels that cost insane amounts of money to maintain and repair. "
"To quote the article:

> ""It’s interesting that companies are still confirming large orders weeks after the unveiling event. It almost seems like there’s some sort of snowball effect going on and no one wants to be the one without any Tesla Semi truck on the books.""

It's sound business decision to pre-order the trucks, because the Tesla Semi has a high chance of becoming a game changer in the trucking industry:

- **Much lower fuel consumption costs**: a fully utilized Tesla Semi can pay for its own purchase price in just about ~2 years (!), through fuel savings alone.
- **Possibly much lower maintenance costs**: Teslas have about 30% of the component count that of an equivalent capability ICE car. If that reduction in complexity is similar for trucks, then the maintenance savings and reliability improvements could be significant.
- **Shorter delivery times in-city**, due to the higher acceleration. If a Tesla Semi can do 5 short delivery trips a day while an equivalent price ICE truck can only do 4 deliveries, then the Tesla Semi will earn 25% more income! This is a huge deal, considering the intense competition and low profit margins in the trucking industry.

So if Tesla delivers the Semi with the qualities they promised, owners of a Tesla Semi fleet will have a **very** significant competitive advantage over their rivals.

But here's the problem to potential customers: Tesla's waiting lists for new products are notoriously long: the Model 3 waiting list is a year long currently. So if you place your order for a Tesla Semi too late you might have to wait a year longer than your competitors to get it - while your competitors are using it and are gaining a significant competitive advantage.

So if you believe Tesla's numbers and if you are in the trucking industry, then it's the smart business decision to get into the waiting list early on, rather than late - especially if competitors have already announced their pre-orders.

This I think explains the 'snowball effect'.
"
That’s exactly what is needed for the Tesla RV in 7-10 years. I’m going to start saving now. 
"I like how they seem to one-up each other.

""Oh yeah? You ordered 15? We ordered 25!""

""25? That's nothing! We ordered 40!""

""We've just ordered 50! Take that!""

Now I'm waiting for the first company to order 100. It should be quite the news."
"The largest fleet in the world is the US Post Office.  Tesla could build a van for them only and it would be a huge home run.  Interestingly, they were going to electrify their fleet in the 2000s I believe, right around the same time Republicans then decided they must fund 75 years of future benefits thus killing their ability to do it..."
I can’t wait to see these on the road. Seen a few used non autonomous capable Model S hitting the low $20 K mark. I’ll be getting mine next year ... To all the all the early adopters we are truly grateful to you all.
So is there a tally count for the total order number? 
Anyone keeping a count on estimated total reservations? 
"I wrote an engineering design paper my senior year working for my bachelors on EV's and semi-trucks. Of course, the natural improvement of design and decreasing cost of EV's would tend toward spreading that very technology to other-than-passenger vehicles, but I still get a slight sense of pride knowing that I was thinking about this 4 years ago. Good on Tesla."

Keep the orders coming!
"LOL, now that there's probably a year-long waiting list for the Semis, are we going to be watching these orders and deliveries with vinbot next year?"
Tesla’s pre order idea is still going according to planned. That’s cool I suppose. I really hope they can get production numbers up. They’ll change the game. 
Good to see orders like this becoming normal. 
"How many preorders are required to make the semi a success? If the 5x more than Model 3 and are 1/5 as many made, then is 1000, 10k, 100k reservations enough?"
This is an awesome one for them.  The only Sysco trucks I see are smaller daytime use ones that run around to schools and daycares doing food deliveries.
"It's not large though is it? The US truck market is like 300,000 trucks a year, so 50 is like 0.02% of that. 1000 is a large order. 50 is 'we can mention it in the ESG section of our annual report'. 🙄"
"With this and Busch's purchase, assuming the higher end of the price range of 180k Tesla just made a cool 18mil."
So with each of these large orders is Tesla making bank?  Like do they plop down an order or do they plop down $10m to reserve them?
"Im happy about all these orders, but it seems like a competition lol. Every day or so its a bigger and bigger order number. It's not bad, not even slightly, it's just slightly humorous. "

"is anyone buying founders series?  i can see those for the roadster, but it's a much tougher sell for the semi, basically a $20k donation to tesla to get it a bit quicker."

We keep seeing order or reservation in the title when it comes to Tesla's truck. Is it really an order when the truck is not released or a reservation since they're paying a refundable fraction of the cost of the truck?
Wooooo hooo 20% corporate tax cap... lets order our Tesla's now !!! 
Dey took er jerbs
What people don't get is you have for electricity to charge these. So all this talk of the fuel saving there is still a cost associated with it. I don't buy gas anymore but my electric bill at home went up $80 a month charging my car. 
"Quick question, and I'm not trolling. Does this semi actually work?"
"They're almost certainly working on a service vehicle. Doubt they'll hit every sweet spot like your box truck, but a service vehicle platform (think Sprinter competition) that can be ordered either bare or with soccer-mom amenities sounds like a no-brainer."
"Be sure to email them, pop into a store and talk etc. The more they hear the better."
"Its gonna be the same as the beginning of Tesla, expensive vehicles to pay for the economy one's...."

"I was talking to several friends (who own Teslas) and they all seemed to think this would be a good idea too. 

Another thought: Tesla RV. All that nice assisted driving and someday, fully autonomous driving, combined with an RV. IDK, maybe just buy the Semi and get an RV trailer. Do they make those? Probably not. "
And at the presentation Elon pops open the back and they roll out the Tesla motorcycle
"afaik, the Deutsche Post had the same problem and no one could sell them one so they decided to create their own.  
Now its a best-seller you might want to look into."
Smaller local delivery trucks are easier for any company to cobble together and lots will. Tesla is trying to target harder sectors where the energy requirements and charging capacity will be difficult for most companies to meet and the payback of using less fuel is more immediate.
"They’re working on it. The problem is the ROI on the additional expense of the technology when you don’t run the same miles in class 5-6. Class 8 is where all the miles are, once battery costs come down we will see it cascade into lighter duty trucks. "

"It looks like they're going back to their roots making a higher-cost low-volume vehicle to start with a lower cost of entry, then build higher volume vehicles.  Right now they're cash constrained, so it makes sense.

Get Model 3 incoming coming in as well as low-volume large truck experience at the same time then you're set to do a high-volume small and mid size trucks.  Possibly starting on the larger side as you're looking since FedEx, UPS, and others have a high demand for them.

"the fuel savings are based on undisclosed assumptions 


if they were disclosed they would probably be a very optimistic high mile long haul.

"But the good part is the physical technology already exists.  Its really the logistics stuff that doesn't exist yet.  That can always be supplemented with 3rd party devices until tesla software catches up.

What really matters is how many batteries are in all the reserved 3s and semis and is it possible for the current battery factory to even make that much by 2019 or 2020?"
""" Much lower fuel consumption costs""

Remove the road tax from diesel and the costs difference is small

"I don't think it's a significant advantage if it's only 50 trucks out of a fleet of a couple hundred thousand.

"They did not pursue the ongoing competition to replace the entire USPS fleet. There is a hybrid electric van in the remaining pool of options, though."
"Except the down select for that contract was two years ago, they are testing prototypes now, and about to make an award.

"[231 that we know of](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g8545si6JX6PWpffxI4ovzAHa64y0IRhmaJHH9_ma9A/htmlview).  I am guessing that as it starts rolling out and demonstrating reliability, adoption will be much faster.  Many companies can't justify the deposit being on the books so long with the uncertainty in the vehicle.  Also, companies will slowly adopt the tech as old vehicles wear out and need to be replaced and they gain a better understanding of the electrical infrastructure needs at the companies.  "

However these are preorders and will be used to test the platform. Only once the trucks are in the hands of customers and they have had a chance to thoroughly test them will larger orders be placed if the test results are good.

The other part of the equation is charging at depots, warehouses and  hubs .. in this space Telsa can tailor a solution for each individual location sing a mixture, of batteries, Solar and off-peak power...

So while electricity does cost something it is cheaper than Diesel, and there are more ways of designing a solution to minimize costs.

That is the other up side of the Semi roll-out, many customers will want an on-site charging solution with a mixture of Solar and batteries .... as long as it saves them money in the long run .. they will go to Tesla and get it done right first time..."
"I think almost everybody understands this. The point is that the electricity is much cheaper, and produces less greenhouse gas emissions.

I have never encountered a person who seemed to think that charging electric cars didn't cost money. Though, for Tesla owners with supercharging it may not..."
"You mean ""is it more than just a nice concept"", or ""are the long-term fundamentals proven""? The latter is impossible to know until these trucks start seeing active service in fleets, but to answer the former: yes, Tesla has actually made at least 2 rolling prototypes of the Semi, complete with a fully working powertrain and at least a WIP driver interaction system."
"If they can hit the medium duty truck market with a truck that can be up-fit into multiple uses they will absolutely clean house.  The new diesels with their necessary emissions systems are a complete nightmare requiring enough repair and maintenance to bring their actual cost close to the price of the 300 mile Tesla Semi.  Switching from them to a reliable electric is a no brainier even at a higher cost.  Garbage trucks, delivery trucks, tow trucks, school buses, really any truck that operates a local route and comes back to base at night would be a perfect fit to move to electric.  For them to ignore this segment would be insane given it's potential.  I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen in the next 10 years as long as they can continue to scale battery production and stay on track with everything else that is on their plate.         "

Just a thought.  
"
"> Smaller local delivery trucks are easier for any company to cobble together and lots will. 

Yes, that is right there are already some trucks like this available, or at least announced. 

IMO Tesla will eventually cover all segments, but they are probably waiting for battery prices to hit the right point so that they can put out an affordable truck with the right quality and performance, they need to value the Tesla brand.

The other consideration is having somewhere to make the smaller truck in what will be higher volumes and a lower margin on each truck....

My assumption at this point in time is that they are initially making the Semi at the Nevada Gigafactory.

The smaller truck ties in with the pickup, we could see both at the same time, my guess is a reveal in the next 2-3 years and production stating 2 years later. So say around 2022."
"They’re already there if the 300 mile Semi is $150k. These trucks are costing me upwards of $80k and then I get to maintain and repair them constantly. That 1,000,000 mile guarantee alone is worth probably $30-40k to me the reduction in fuel costs is just the cherry on top. Hell I’d pay $120k for a Tesla truck and still pay the same dollar per mile in fuel costs as I do diesel and I’d still be happy to pay more for the truck.  The semi is easier for them because they just have to make the truck one way and it’ll hook up to any trailer where as medium duty trucks need to be available in all types of different configurations for all different types of uses. It’ll be more complicated which is something they don’t need right now but eventually I’m sure they’ll get around to it. Once they do they’re not going to be able to keep up with demand because it’s out there. "
"Thought those trucks were in the 120 mile range, range.  Not sure on price either but t seems like Tesla would put something out with more range and at a better price. 120miles of range would work for some of my routes but not all and really I want any truck I own to be able to go on any route I need.  

Edit:  Actually looks like they’re even less range. Can’t find a GVW rating on them but they appear to be smaller than what I’m looking for.  "

"The apparent size was due to the wind breakers, not the actual semi. The cab height was the same in both otherwise."
Oh I don’t know exactly I just know that’s what my trucks are so I would need a truck that can move that much weight 200-250 miles. My size and type of trucks require a class B license vs a class A for the semi but other than that I’m not sure what other regulatory differences there would be.  If anything there’s less regs on a smaller truck I think. 
Kinda need the rear wheels moved to the back of the truck. Typically don’t need dual axels in the back for my trucks either but could use them if that’s the only way they can make it all work. If they could make a cab and a rear module that could be mounted on rails behind the cab it would be perfect. Then the rear axel or axles with motors could be mounted wherever the different bodies require they be mounted which is how it’s done now basically by using different length driveshafts.  It’s certainly doable the only real question is how long until they get to that segment of truck.

Let's hope the rugs tie the room together. 
"> but in town trucks run 50 miles a day instead of 500 so the total fuel used is much less, maybe $50 bucks a day. Maybe $20

Two observations:

- The average daily route for a FedEx driver is around 160 miles, with about 80 stops - and that's one of the smaller delivery trucks.
- For in town deliveries the much higher acceleration of the Tesla Semi earns money in that it can shorten delivery times significantly. [Here's a video of how the Tesla Semi accelerates](https://youtu.be/tBiUkiic_cI?t=70) - it's unreal.

So on longer trips it's the fuel savings that are probably the more significant ones, on shorter trips it's the delivery time shortening that is probably the most significant factor.
"
"In town trucks lose a bunch of fuel to idling and braking.

You need at least a hybrid with engine stop/start to get close, otherwise fuel is just as big an advantage in-town as out."
">Remove the road tax from diesel and the costs difference is small

That's unlikely to happen. If anything, I would expect diesel to become *less* desirable to use if current momentum (eg. various cities banning diesel vehicles in the 20s, 30s, and 40s) holds up. Prospective customers have to look at the realities of the landscape today and take into account predictions of the future, and the latter does not bode well for practical transportation using diesel.

>You can't be serious

That was indeed a very questionable argument to make by /u/__Tesla__ , but fortunately, I think the Semi's fundamentals make it a compelling economic choice for routes that are within its range, fast acceleration or not."
The higher acceleration is a bit of a gimmick.  Delivery drivers can't just smash the accelerator and expect all of the cargo to stay where is is.  Most of the best practices in rigging and shipping assume slow accelerations and occasional slamming on the brakes (which is also 'slow' in such heavy vehicles).  Safety (stopping) and cargo integrity are going to limit some of the acceleration benefits of this vehicle.

if you make the in town truck 5 mpg it is still only 10 gal a day
double the miles driven and you still have only 20 gallons a day of potential total energy savings if the tesla used no energy.  that’s $50 a day or max of like $12k a year potential savings

long haul potential savings are closer to $50k

brakes would be an additional in town truck savings 
"
"> That was indeed a very questionable argument to make

It's not questionable I believe for a number of reasons - basically ICE engine based trucking is under a number of constraints (fuel efficiency, pollution, noise, maintenance costs, etc.) that make it harder to utilize a stronger engine to deliver more efficiently.

Most of those constraints either do not apply to the Tesla Semi, or are a lot less severe - [see my longer reply here which goes into the details of this argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7iejs1/tesla_semi_receives_large_order_of_50_electric/dqzpnpr/), showing how a stronger truck engine is helpful in urban environments, or when delivering high mass payloads, or when delivering in mountainous terrain.

For passenger cars, engine power is basically a ""nice to have"" luxury quality. For trucking, engine power affects the bottom line very directly in many cases.

Is a (much) stronger engine a primary factor in buying a Tesla Semi? Probably not, but it sure is a measurable competitive advantage that freight companies will not be blind to.

Honestly not sure off the top of my head but fluid changes alone are a lot. It’s more the repairs that typically end up around $10k when there is a problem with the exhaust systems.

"> are you subtracting out the fewer deliveries from the extra battery weight? 

The batteries are high density, they take about as much space as a regular ICE engine + fuel tanks. Weight of the truck does not matter (and ICE truck engine is heavy as well), what matters is:

- how much load can the truck can carry: up to 80,000 lb full load
- how fast can it deliver the load: 0-60 mph in 20 seconds (with full 80,000 lb load!)
- how much it costs to run: it's consuming less than 2 kWh per mile, and Tesla plans MegaChargers with a guaranteed 7 cents per kWh pricing. So 500 miles would cost $70.

How would regen braking give it stability? You can't get something from nothing. The induction motors are alternator more or less. You turn kinetic energy back into battery power. You can't charge the battery and drive.
That might work better than my idea. 
Personal view is Semi and Roadster are both ATM machines to buy them enough time to get the Model 3 to the 5000 per week mark. Everything is gravy if they can get to the finish line and stay there with no major QA setbacks

Acceleration (and engine power in general) has a *significant* impact on freight delivery duration, *especially* in ""final 10 miles"" urban environments of freight transport, because:

- There's a lot of turning, resulting in repeated cycles of deceleration and acceleration
- Traffic lights (and right of way stops) result in repeated cycles of acceleration and deceleration
- It is true that acceleration has less effect during rush hours, but in most urban environments rush hour only affects about 10-20% of the typical day time of freight transport. Also, even during rush hours, traffic is often lighter and less constrained in suburban areas and outer city industrial zones, where a large chunk of freight traffic occurs.
- Not all aspects of higher engine power are visible via higher acceleration: there's a lot of urban environments in mountainous areas as well, where moving around higher weight cargo is currently a lot slower with ICE trucks, if there's a lot of uphill and downhill movement on the route of the delivery

The fact that ICE truck based freight transport cannot significantly increase acceleration is due to the following constraints of ICE technologies:

- Diesel fuel consumption increases disproportionately with higher acceleration/deceleration cycles, especially with higher payload weight, because there's no regenerative braking and the higher mass means (much) more kinetic energy needs to be built up and then wasted while braking
- ICE engine efficiency decreases disproportionately at higher RPMs, further decreasing fuel efficiency
- Diesel engine pollution increase disproportionately at higher RPMs
- Diesel engine noise increases disproportionately at higher RPMs
- Higher deceleration will also wear down brake pads and discs faster, especially at higher payload masses.

Many urban delivery freight companies are already operating under strict permitted delivery hours, engine noise and air pollution constraints.

With the Tesla Semi few of these problems exist:

- Tesla Semi fuel costs are at least a factor of two lower - possibly more if the freight company purchases electricity in bulk and employs night time charging at base load electricity rates (which are a fraction of the peak load rates that most residential charging stations pay).
- Regenerative braking can capture a significant chunk of energy otherwise lost during deceleration.
- There's no increase in pollution higher EV engine acceleration
- There's no significant increase in noise due to higher EV engine acceleration, as evidenced by the video.
- Tesla Semi Brake pads and disks do not get worn down during regenerative braking.

> Ultimately, companies aren't picking the Semi for its 0-60 time, but for everything else.

See the long list of reasons above that shows why higher engine power matters: it's possible to gain a significant competitive advantage by making use of the (insanely) high torque and engine power of the Tesla Semi. Engine power doesn't have to be the *primary* factor to pre-order a Tesla Semi - but it's a significant factor.

This I believe also explains why Tesla themselves are displaying the engine power characteristics of the Tesla Semi prominently [in their description of the product](https://www.tesla.com/semi/): 0-60 acceleration with 80,000lb load, characteristic speed when going uphill on a 5% grade, etc.

And this mentality is exactly why governments create and enforce environmental regulations. Also, the fact that you are saying this when [your company claims to be](http://www.seilogistics.com/) ""sustainable at our core"" would be laughable if it wasn't so sad."
"Now let's think about what happens when EVERYONE has the same attitude as you do about the emissions parts on your trucks. 

Do you see where the problem comes into play? People like you are the reason that this beautiful planet will one day be uninhabitable and the human race will cease to exist. 

Absolutely unbelievable. "
Now I understand how the tax plan is getting through...
You're not wrong dylan.
Is there an authority this guy could be reported to in Canada? 
"Ehhhhhh, removing every deduction, keeping it progressive, and reducing corporate tax is what any economist would do. Keep the estate tax and change payroll to higher income rates and it would be perfect progressive system. "

Right in the feels to see him smile like that
"What a champ! Enjoy every breath,  that’s the take away for all of us form this story"
"I'm NOT OK with someone cutting me in line for my Model 3 but in this case, I'll make an exception –everyone on the list "
We’re not fan boys just bc the cars are cool
"Way to go Tesla! Good business isn’t just about getting it done, it’s about doing it the right way!"
He has such passion for technology. I hope he enjoys every mile!
"Looks like this is the first confirmed non-employee delivery, right?"
Who’s cutting the damn onions again!!!
"Man, people are literally dying to get the 3."
"A company that truly cares
"
"May he enjoy every ride he takes in his Model 3.

"> As the first relatively affordable and mass-produced electric vehicle...

When you start a sentence like that, the next words have to be the Nissan Leaf.  Same price, bigger production.

I drive a Nissan Leaf, but I don't even like it.  Range is too short, style looks terrible, aerodynamics aren't very good.  But I recognize it was the first.

And the 2018 sucks less."

"""Early"". I think it'd be enough to just deliver it!"
That's so great!!
He still had to pay ? Or did they let him lease?
Moral of the story: People are dying to see their model 3.
"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://electrek.co/2017/12/13/tesla-model-3-bucket-list-dying-man/) reduced by 68%. (I'm a bot)

> As we reported earlier today, Tesla is definitely ramping up Model 3 deliveries this week, but most of those vehicles are still in the hands of Tesla and SpaceX employees and their relatives.

> Only a few regular reservation holders are now taking delivery and it&#039;s a big deal for most of those early adopters, but even more so for a man with stage 4 terminal cancer whose dying wish was apparently to get his own Model 3.

> &quot;Well, I&#039;d love to see November deliveries! i have a terminal stage 4 cancer and have been told I may only 3-4 months to live. The last thing on my bucket list is our Model 3 and I&#039;d like to have a few days to experience and enjoy it. I wonder if there is any flexibility in the que?&quot;.

"Maybe it's just me, but I found the title of this article to be a bit insensitive. I think the same effect could have been had if it was worded: Tesla fulfils bucket list of man fighting stage IV terminal cancer by delivering his Model 3 early

"It was a nice gesture, but perhaps someone or Tesla could have just loaned or rented the guy a model S for the last 3-4 months of his life. :-("
Agreed. This kind of good will from Tesla buys lots of patience & forgiveness from me.
No company cares. They do it for PR. 
Don't they treat their employees horrible? Lmao
I wish Nissan would have gone with an active thermal management system in the refresh. At a second hand car they're not bad save for the rampant battery degradation. 
I laughed. Then I realized I actually do want to know the VIN.
I spoke with my Dr. He told me I'm definately going to die.
Not funny
https://www.reddit.com/r/jesuschristreddit/
I chuckled but then felt bad.
But... he didn't want a Model S.
"roadster prototype, i'm sure they have a few lying around"
Costumer retention.
"Feature not enabled until 6 months from now, after he's passed."
... and Australia :(
"We already have everyone in the US cutting the line so what difference does it make for us. If you stood in line or ordered the next week, it's all late 2018 for everyone in Canada. "
"Pro tip: wait for an old guy to die, ring their widow and ask them about the car they have for sale. 

She won't need it anymore, she'll likely not know it's worth, and funerals are expensive!

(It's -11 Celsius here. At least I would be warm in hell)"
"You're assuming that people buying a Model 3 would actually prefer a Model S. That's not always the case.

I could buy a Model S now instead of waiting two years from reservation to actually getting the car, but for me it's important to make a point that great electric cars can be cheaper. I'm happy to make the Model 3 a success. I come from a country ruined by petro-dictators, and while I no longer live there, buying a Model 3 means a big ""fuck you"" to everyone who ruined my home country. I'll wait as long as I have to."
Right... nobody who works at any company could possibly have any human emotion other than greed.
"If this was PR, Elon or Tesla would have tweeted about it."
People can do good things for multiple reasons. 
Tesla is not a company.
"You will get downvoted, but I agree. Tesla is as much of a faceless corporate behemoth as any other comparable company. They're only in this for PR."
I wouldn't call it rampant.  Mine is nearly 4 years old and still has about 90% capacity.  But yes.  The Leaf and the Bolt are going to look outmoded as soon as the Model 3 ramps up.
"I was mostly just beating on a dead horse, but for real I do want to do my best to keep track of delivery VINs for my own personal investing and delivery estimate. "
"If I also rehash the joke, but this time ironically, will I get upvotes?"
"I mean, it kinda is if you're desensitized enough but I agree it's pretty fucked up."
Maybe he did want a model S but couldn't afford it!
What kind of costumes?
r/unethicallifeprotips
"I still would prefer the Model S... But mostly because iI have a dog and go outdoor bouldering and both of those are 1000x better with a lift/hatch back. I still might cancel my model 3 res poorly because of this, but very conflicted..."
I am curious as to the country that was ruined by Petro-dictators.
Lol because THATS the problem 
"You are also assuming he didn't want a Model S! perhaps he could not afford it?  Either way it would have gotten the dying man into an EV sooner! However you group thinkers have already spoken, so the point is moot."
All companies are run by unthinking robots who are incapable of showing empathy - /u/Patiiii probably
Thank god finally a logical person replied. 
"Tesla themed ones.

"
"I'm not sure it's quite unethical, it's more in poor taste. "
Close your eyes and point to a map. 
"Taking advantage of a grieving widow? Yes, that’s unethical. "
Found the lawyer.
"I see where you're coming from, but I may be thinking too much into it. If you trick her into thinking it's a worthless car or try to bully her into selling it, etc. I would consider that unethical. Taking the opportunity to ask a widow about a car that she may not need anymore, and offer money that could help her financially is not inherently unethical in my opinion. "
Remember when the subreddit went crazy with a single model 3 sighting. This makes me giddy. 
"That lone Model X: ""Day 17. The 3's have accepted me as one of their own. They are completely oblivious to my true identity"""
That such a beautiful sight. I've been dreaming about the day when you see dozens of Model 3's on any given drive around town. Tesla's making it happen.
What is the wait? Do they need more semi trucks to deliver to each region?
can you share details where and when you did the pic?
Q4 is gonna be juicy
"It used to be one Model 3 in a crowd of Model X. This is gonna get really good, really quick."
"I pass by their new LA - Marina del Rey location everyday on my way to work and always try to get a glimpse of something, anything. Today I saw what looked like a handful of model 3s being unwrapped!

Edit: Yep, model 3s for sure. Saw more unwrapping this morning too!"
Whats the leading theory on why these are piling up and not being delivered?
We're gonna need a drone to efficiently get all of the VINs now
Looks like an 11X11 array.  Are these different from the ones that we saw VINs for earlier today?
Can you please go back here tomorrow and see if they're still there or if they've been shipped out or replaced?
They're all gingers!

LET MY MODEL 3 GO
"Why it is that none of the Model 3's that appear to be awaiting shipping have any coverings to protect paint which is common in the auto industry? I sure wouldn't be accepting the vehicle if it has small scratches in the paint when it arrives.

One day they will drive themselves to your house? Wake up on Christmas with a model 3 in your driveway. It be cool
I’ve put in some culverts at this very yard.... it’s crazy how fast it fills up with spankin new cars and even more so how it’s empty in a matter of a few hours every day I was there
Looks great! Can't see any panel gaps anywhere. >_O
Why is there one random model X in there. Seems strange.

I'd gladly take that lone wolf Model X. Someday....someday.
"What are they waiting for, hand mine over already!"
"Don't hand them out all at once, leave them wanting for more. "
Why not deliver them?
since there isn't much configuration with model 3-most of the cars might have built-all about shipping with color & tire size options.
Looks like seeing a tesla on the road will not be anything special soon!
"My goodness, EV is going to take over the world!!!"
Lol damn
When I saw that Model X I was hoping it was mine - wrong color though :(
AHHHHHH
How long until they get shipped by Tesla Semi?

It's a staging area. Every other manufacturer uses this method to prepare shipments. There's nothing out of the ordinary here. 
Waiting on somebody to install parts or somebody with a ball peen hammer to fix the gaps. According to tsla shorts.
No one wants them. Destine for shelters. /s
You don't ship cars one at a time.
"Same leading theory explaining this VW parking lot.

They're waiting for those sweet V8 engines they ordered from GM to show up.
Because the car shipping business sucks.
My people! Or time is now for the gingers shall inherit the EV.
It's water on the glass roof refracting light.
This is very normal.

"They did that to keep the delivery fee lower.  If, for some reason, there are scratches on your car I am sure they will fix them.  That's why they let you inspect the car at the delivery center before accepting it."
"Remembers me when I got a train under the Christmas tree :)

"Look closer, there's model x sprinkled in all over."
That's probably the current product mix for a delivery to LA or something.
There are others. Only about one per row in the first couple rows. 
Why do you think they aren’t delivering them?
Probably 10 years or so at this rate 
No

[Some folks say they're up to 5000/week](https://electrek.co/2017/12/14/tesla-model-3-production-increasing-to-5000-units-per-week-suppliers/). I think they are ramping up and not necessarily catching back up to original estimates but simply ramping up with a delayed start.
We have to put a stop to this.
"""They may take our HUDs... but they will never take our frunks!"""
They're making somewhere around 100-300 3's per day if you listen to some rumors. Other rumors say they'll be making 5k per week now or in the very near future (<4 weeks from now)
"> driven off the road.

Smart. Total your leaf and then use the insurance payout to buy a model 3:)"
That's gonna be sweet as fuck. Just your brand new Tesla pulling onto your driveway honking and flashing it's indicators.
Something something wipers?
My alternative theory is these are waiting for a software update before going to non-employees.
I can imagine them having the cars drive themselves into the truck. It'll be a fun project to program them as a swarm in the parking lot.

"Looks correct, comparing street view there and the pic..."
"Tesla is a little tricky because of Musk.

Q4 numbers don't matter much per-se, but the earnings call is in February. When Musk says ""we're running at XXX rate"" in February, it won't even matter how much they actually produced in Q4.

The only thing that matters is sustained, increase demand in Model S/X."
"3,800 VINs registered I think that may be the target for 2017 production...

So around 2,000-2,500 delivered Q4 is possible.

I'm also thinking around 2,000."
Anybody interested in holding a candle light vigil?
"EV 1 2.0

This is staging? I thought we were in production already. /s
Nothing to see folks! Move along!
Except that’s like four months worth of Model 3 production in that photo. 
I'm sure none of the half million people waiting in line could tolerate panel gaps so wide. Off to the crushers they go.

In the arms of an angel....
On the same note you don't deliver cars hundreds at a time
No one buys minivans anymore?
I've found that Model X roofs often look reddish due to the way light strikes them.  Guess we're seeing something similar with the 3.
There you go. I always suspected Google  just makes shit up... confirmed. 
Haha agreed.   “Dude we’re building like three vehicles simultaneously now!  It’s crazy!”
I'm curious. Mind explaining a bit more?

"That article doesn't in any way say that they are currently producing 5,000/week."
We stop to put a hat on this.
^(super) CHARGE!!
"""Well, they might.  Roadster 2020 is still a question mark."""
Suppliers in Taiwan say they're making enough parts for 5k/week as of this week. Seems like 5k/week is imminent.
A little early for that.  I demand AWD.

"Sweet, people on the east coast can get new cars with 3000 miles. :^)"

only if we use led candles. cant be using polluting burning ones
The world is a stage...
Staging is for weak people. We do everything in production.

Yup I think that is ok as long as they fix before delivery and reduce as time goes by. Not efficient but more efficient than stopping All manufacturing while you wait for a part or updated parts.
WHERE'S THE REMOTE??!? YOU HAD IT LAST!
unless you're shipping internationally. cheaper to bulk them

"To be fair, it takes an enormous amount of energy to move a cargo ship and in this case, it's just moving coal up a river.

I think we'll see electric planes before we see battery powered ships meant to cross oceans. "
"Not really. Like Musk said the cut offs for quarters are arbitrarily in the middle of the production ramp.

If they only delivered 2000 Model 3s in Q4, but are at a run rate of 5000/week in February, the stock price won't care at all what happened in Q4. "
I just want my hat. It takes as long to receive a hat as it does a Model S...
/r/simulationtheory is leaking. Again.

Thats..... a bit too personal for the internet
I've heard bad things on Reddit about the lady at that number...
Get a picture of the battery sticker while you're down there.
"And get a picture of the battery sticker while you are at it. 


The car’s hood probably doesn’t close/work by now so it should be easy."
"The title says Model 3 production is **increasing** to 5k/week (i.e. in the future), not that ""they're up to 5,000/week"" already.

Also, the *content* of the article makes that fairly clear. Titles are often misleading to get more attention."
Especially with the Liberty Mutual Tesla insurance that will replace the car's value entirely the first year!
"Oh, that would happen.  I suck with RWD.  Way too many accidents happened because my reflexes were tuned for FWD."
"This suggestion sort of goes against the whole 'better for the environment' argument since sourcing the materials and the initial build is the most intensive impact. It would be environmentally inconsiderate to simply upgrade to the latest model because you think it's nicer or it has one or two features you like a bit more. It would be even worse if you crashed it for an excuse to upgrade because then the car can't even be used by another person who buys it second hand, thus making any potential benefit to the environment from driving an electric car null and void.

I know you are just joking but hopefully anyone considering upgrading their Tesla just for the sake of having a new model seriously considers the point of buying and supporting electric cars in the first place."
"And if the Model 3 came in a front wheel drive, I'd settle for that.  But my reflexes are tuned for the front wheels to be driving, and I tend to fail spectacularly if they're not."
Ah shit. 
"We always get some color on how production is going, and numbers will give a pretty big hint of where the rate is going. Perhaps not specific enough to pinpoint exactly where they are, but enough that the stock price will almost certainly swing in a big way. "
Are you saying that because you're saying we won't know q4 results until earnings call? 
"but how will they ship the semi?
"
I think it does.  
"That's not even full production. They've only recently exceeded the 100 units/year rate (with thousands ordered, about 2400 from the US alone). They're still in the middle of LRIP 11, and full production isn't expected to start for a few more years (after LRIP 14, last I heard), which should be more than 200 aircraft a year.

That said, their initial unit costs have fallen dramatically, so there's less risk of any more cancelled orders."
Well that isn't obvious at all. Rawr. 
Oh I'm so sorry. I wasn't aware of that. 
That sucks. Keep in mind that Tesla’s have way better traction control than what you’ve probably driven before. I tried a friend’s S85 a few winters back and the traction control was amazingly fast. Just a slight wiggle after it reached the limits of grip. 
"Well, if they sell their Tesla, then someone else gets to use an electric car for less money"
"No, I'm saying it's a good indicator of progress but ultimately irrelevant (in terms of Model 3 production).

Still important for S and X tho"
Tesla won't know Q4 results until earnings call and the quarter ends... 
"[pileup](https://youtu.be/oUa1VwXt33U)  is usually not a good thing. 

I don’t want to see bunch of model 3 piled up. "
"Lockheeder? In a past life, I worked for NGC."
In the long run it's irrelevant but when they announce it in the first week of January it'll still be nice to know where they're at from the week before.
Thats incorrect. They know and announce production numbers way before earnings call. Earnings call happens over a month after the quarter ends. Production numbers are announced right after quarter end.
"At this point, I'd be ecstatic to see some piled up 3s.  I haven't seen one in person yet."
"Yup. Got bored and disillusioned and decided that big companies aren't for me, so I left."
Definitely true
"Cool, so same as the S\X. I thought you meant 1 at a time when you said individually.  "
"I was asking my friend yesterday a question - neither of us own a Tesla so can someone answer me here perhaps.  So, when it snows I typically turn on my car and let the heat run and melt some snow off the windows and the engine melts the heat off the hood. How does it work with a Tesla?  There is no gas combustion putting off tons of heat etc.  Thanks for helping my curiosity. "
I was just thinking about this last night as I was driving my Jeep Grand Cherokee in a snow storm and it warned me as it does occasionally that the collision avoidance and adaptive cruise control systems had become disabled until the front sensor was cleaned off. How will Tesla handle full time autonomous driving in snow regarding this issue? A defroster is probably not enough to keep up in a storm. I feel like additional hardware will be needed that cleans the sensors...
The question is do they have a defroster or better design on the radar. I lost all autopilot capabilities last night (including just regular cruise control) for a while due to the snow.
"I've still never even had a rear-view camera. Fuck I'm poor.
"
"Thats great for cameras, but what about for all the other sensors/sonar etc.

"
"But yet if snow builds up on the front, blocking the radar, AP disables itself.  "
How 'bout in -30 degree of Celcius? 🤔 
So this means that eventually Tesla cars won’t even need windows! It can be made like or unlike anything we have seen. All they need are some camera holes.

"So..... do these have sprayers?   Because as a midwest resident, these would quickly be sprayed with salt.  Even black cars turn solid white up here.  I'm guessing none of the cameras would work unless you washed your car every single day, and even then it would only work for a little while."
Are there actual defrosting units there or are they IR cameras and the IR radiation is defrosting the area?
"To me it makes sense for sensors that aren't on windows, like the upward facing ones on the X and the ones in front of the doors that face sideways, but do people not clear the windows of ice and snow anyway before driving? 

If so, what's the purpose of the heating for those?

(Also should clear roof so snow from roof doesn't slide forward onto windscreen under braking but it's surprising how few people do that)"
I'd it capable of auto pilot in a blizzard tho?
"Yeah, that's probably nice if you're getting an inch or too of powder, but that won't do much in a Montreal winter. Those resistors are just gonna melt themselves a little air bubble under the remaining feet of snow lol. Still a neat feature."
They should bring this feature to the headlights of the  Model S too. Even with light snow the lights get covered up very quickly and you have to get out and brush the snow off if you want to see anything in the dark. (I don't know why they haven't thought of this yet.)
Is it just me or does the model 3 seems like it has more value then the low end model Ses?
So does it keep them defrosted all the time? Is the car literally watching all the time?
My Model S AP2 is currently parked outside and it's snowing a lot. I went to see it and all of the cameras are covered with snow. When does it start defrosting them? When I get in the car or start preheating it? Or is it not defrosting them because I only have EAP?
This is surely a case for cross post in /r/mildlyinteresting
Not good enough.
"Does the S/X have camera defrosters only if you get the winter package, or do all have it?"
"Nah man it sucks. First the front defrosts then the back and finally it starts on the sides. I don't know why they don't all defrost at the same time. It'd be a bigger draw on the batteries sure, but it'd save so much time."
"Teslas are ""always on"", kind of like your phone. They monitor the cabin and battery temperature, and they can heat either one if it gets too cold when the car is unattended. This probably helps with snow on the windows, not sure about the hood."
"You can’t really melt the snow on the hood because, as you pointed out, no combustion engine. However, the climate control can be turned on using the app and given enough time, it will defrost the windows.

If the question is regarding the mechanism, the car uses electric resistance heaters to heat the cabin."
"The car has a radiator and a heating element for both cooling and heating respectively, to keep the battery at an optimum temperature and for the cabin. It would use those components to prep the cabin from your mobile phone, and is probably one of the best features of the car. "
"Just like with most other EV's, you can tell it to heat up from an app.  
This means that you can tell the car to heat up the cabin while you eat breakfast, an it will be nice and warm when you are ready to go.  
  
Also - The flip side of not having an engine that puts out lot's of heat when it's warm, is that the electric heating is always ready. This means that the most EV's heats up much faster than an ICE car."
Interesting. I’m in Finland and here you would always brush the snow off first so it doesn’t melt on your window. Much quicker and you don’t need to idle your car for a long time which is actually illegal here and not very good for your car. If you start driving immediately the car will heat up faster. A lot of people have electric block heaters or fuel powered heaters as well. But our engines tend to not be V8s so they don’t heat up as quick either :)
I can set a timer clock on our nissan leaf so it will turn on the cabin heat and start warming the car while it is still plugged in before I even get out of bed. So nice
"To the end user, it’s the same: heat comes out of the blowers and melt the windshield and heats the cabin.

The technical side is different. There’s a ~~radiator~~ dual heat pump that uses the power from the battery to “generate” that heat, instead of the engine’s heat.

Edit: I learned something new."

"This might be a problem even if it's just slushy. My Model S was FILTHY the other day after driving on I-70 in Colorado. My Tesla badges on the side (where an AP2 camera is located) were coated in nastiness, and I couldn't see out of my rear camera. I had to make a stop to clear it off by hand so I could drive the rest of the way with a clear feed.

I wish the cameras had eyelids or a water jet of some sort to clean them. I think some other manufacturers do this, maybe."
İ don't think it would be wise to use autopilot on snow.
Cruise control in the snow is a terrible idea. 
[deleted]
"Heavy snow can interfere with the radar, not just a buildup on the car."
Me too! Wondering if there's going to somehow be a solution for this at some point... 
"I was also going to ask about that, and the head and tail lights..."
"No, there is not. And the refresh facelift is worse than original design as it relates to snow caking on."
"Eh, it's nice to have but is just a luxury. I got one on my car and I like it but I don't feel it is essential.

Where it is really at is the 360° view parking cameras, you effectively get an overhead view on all sides. You can see if you are in the lines; which makes seeing a newer Audi, BMW, or MB with fucked up parking more infuriating because you know they can see if they are properly in a spot.

The first time I got in a car with 360° view, I was pulling it into a garage and I seriously wondered what the cameras would show once I pulled in because I thought the camera's view would be blocked. I realized how much of an idiot I was right after the thought, but that goes to show how good a view it provides. The newer versions of the one I first drove are even better."
Be patient :) As of this coming May it's mandatory for all new cars. So eventually we'll all have them.
I don't think you would want to use the autopilot in snow anyways.
"It depends if it's a defroster/heater or if it's the camera that's always on wasting battery. After seeing Björn's video, I think it's the latter unfortunately. This would mean it's just inefficient and on 24/7 for no reason.

Another reason for *thinking* it's just the camera being on is the tiny quantity of snow melted. That's tiny. Any electronic that's on can do that. If they have defroster for -30C that would melt a lot more snow and waste a lot more energy.

The absolute best would be to have heaters and only being on when you drive instead of having that vampire battery drain. Even better, the camera can check itself if it's seeing snow, or not, to engage the heater when driving."
"Cars without windows aren't a good idea, some people get motion sick when they can't see the outside world move as they move in a vehicle."
"Yes, this is what I’ve been saying for a long time.  
No one has sounded interested when I’ve brought it up.  
If an autonomous vehicle were to get into an accident, a solid metal door / frontal area should greatly reduce the risk for death and serious injury.  
With the advancements in high refresh speed bendable OLED screens, you could even mimic what the car’s cameras see outside the vehicle.  
I’m not sure in Tesla’s case that this would work with the current cameras though, as I understand them to be computer vision cameras and not human vision cameras.  "
"IR cameras can see IR light, they don't create it."
"Why would an IR sensor be emitting IR radiation...?

They are CMOS sensors, the heat to defrost comes from heating elements in the glass.

https://insideevs.com/infrared-video-shows-tesla-autopilot-2-0-cameras-heated/"
"In addition to what others have said, if an IR sensor emitted IR light, you’d never see anything.  It’d be like a camera with a laser that just shined on the sensor when you took a picture. "
"When driving through a storm, the surfaces may ice up. Front windows which are being heated by the defroster will typically prevent this, but the defroster heat isn't going to be very effective inside the are covered by the camera housing, so the cameras need their own heating elements. Also, this ensures they can be kept free of snow/ice regardless of whether the human is smart enough to turn on the defroster ... "
The salt is the real problem.  Those will be solid white in less than a day here in the midwest.
"If you have feet of snow on your car, then you shouldn't be in motion anyways.

This should prevent any problems while operating, and allowing resumption of operation quickly after removing your car from the snow bank that it found itself under."
All. Winter pack just adds heated steering wheel and heated rear seats basically. 
It wouldn't be a big draw on the battery at all. I feel like the front and rear can defrost easier than the sides.
What exactly is the heating mechanism?
How does this affect mileage in the winter? Is it significant?
"Any idea how much battery it drains when it's freezing cold outside?

Like let's say the average temperature is -10°C for a few days before you drive again, how much battery power will you have lost?"
"> given enough time, it will defrost the windows.

Only takes about 5-10 minutes in subzero temperatures."
"> If the question is regarding the mechanism, the car uses electric resistance heaters to heat the cabin

Any idea why not a heat pump like the Leaf?"
"Correct.  A common misconception is that idling a car to ""warm it up"" is good for the engine.  This just prolongs the high-wear warm-up period.  Better to start it and drive it gently until the engine is warm."
"It's a dual loop heatpump system. It can shuttle heat in/out of the battery, cabin, And outside. There is also electric resistive heat to supplement the cabin. "
"My point though was that my Jeep threw that warning when it was snowy out but very much within the realm of weather that people can and were driving in. It wasn't even a blizzard (we got < 6 inches).

If full autonomous driving is the future, it needs to be better than that sooner than later."
"There are lots of times I drive my car when my window is hard to see through, either from ice or snow... I always think to myself “I really shouldn’t be doing this”,  but I do it anyway.

I imagine the car won’t be willing to take those risks. It’ll just stop at the first sign of uncertainty, and hand full control to the driver. "
"Yes they do.
Headlight cleaners/ washers are commonly used in bmw, Mercedes and other high- end cars. "
or ultrasonics
"So, you're saying Elon's ambition to make cars fully self driving, and cutting down on accidents caused by human error should exempt the conditions humans are most likely to mis-judge the vehicle's and their own capabilities and cause said accident? 

I disagree with that sentiment wholeheartedly.
"
"I agree, when there's limited traction you should be in full control of the vehicle. The biggest thing with cruise control for me is that is stops me from speeding too fast when I'm paying attention to the road.

The issue with the radar cruise control in the snow for me is when it's behind someone going slow who moves out of the way, the car is going to put power down and it might put too much down and you'll lose grip quickly without being in control."
"Yeah--if only Tesla had designed these cars to be capable of self-driving, *then* we'd need to worry about the radar and snow.

/s"
"The same system in my jeep handles forward collision avoidance (ie auto-braking), and that turns off when the sensor gets covered w/ snow. Losing that is the terrible idea I'm talking about, especially if your stopping distance is limited. If the vehicle was smart enough to know that and do a better job than a human slowing down to avoid something, we most definitely want that sensor functioning in bad weather...."
"Thanks for the response. I'd like to pick your brain a bit since you work on this if you don't mind. Can snow accumulation on the front of the radar (on the front fascia not the radar unit itself) cause it to shut off or can it ""see through"" the snow? I assume it cannot see through the snow once it accumulates enough but I'd like to confirm. How much accumulation can it handle before it shuts off or can no longer sense reliably? 

What about water contamination on the radar unit itself? I've had AP available to use in massive rain storms so I assume either radar is not getting contaminated with a lot of water or it can work fine through it all. But I'd still love to know the answers instead of assuming."
"I would be okay with the radar not working if it was heavy snow. We got maybe 3 inches all day yesterday. When we went out last night, the snow definitely wasn't anything we would call heavy. "
"That sounds awesome. Didn't know about the overhead-type view.

I guess we'll all have stuff like that sooner or later, given how fast tech moves and how much cheaper it gets. 
"
Ok granted.  Then why have the cameras defrost?  Why not also have a heater on the radar?  Why half a solution that doesn't end up solving anything?   I live in the south do I don't really mind.  
LCD screens inside to simulate the outside world! or virtual reality to take you on a drive along a lake xD
"And even if they emitted IR, like night vision cameras do, it’s not long wave infrared, so not good for heating."
"> IR cameras can see IR light, they don't create it.

Actually, IR cameras [very commonly emit IR light](http://www.cctvforum.com/images/imported/2011/01/56IRinfraredcamera-1.jpg) to improve image quality - this is an important aspect in the case of security cameras so that faces can be recorded and movement can be detected, etc.

But car IR cameras indeed tend not to include IR LEDs for size and power envelope reasons, they are relying on the headlights and on environmental light instead.
"
"Ah, I didn't consider this was mainly to keep snowflakes off the sensor during use, but that makes a lot more sense than what I had in mind. Thanks for helping me see that."
"After getting used to her 2014 x5, my mom finds the heated steering wheel the thing she misses most while driving the crap loaners everytime her car is in the shop. "
"We need cooled seats for us living in hot climates. Nothing worse than burning your rear on a hot seat. And if Hyundai can do it, then c'mon Tesla. Please"
"Heated window washer nozzles too, not sure if all vehicles have heated wing mirrors or just cold package vehicles. 

Don’t forget the heated steering wheel as well. "
"Good to know, thanks. Heading into first winter with an electric car. ;)"
"^ This.  They likely start all at once, but the larger cameras heat more quickly."
Wooooosh
"Think of it like a toaster. 
There's an electric heating element inside the car, and when it's on, A/C is blown through it. 

Idk about the batteries heating though. "
"Electric heating elements. Probably just a mostly-conductive material with a current running through it; energy doesn't cease to exist, so when you waste some it has to go somewhere. Most physics interactions release the vast majority of any energy they don't use as heat. That list of interactions includes electricity, the movement of electrons. So, if you ask one end of a wire for electrons and give it a supply of electrons at the other end, whatever ones... don't get... to the other side... disappear... and.. become heat? OK, we reached the part where my knowledge runs out. I don't know what happens to the electrons. I guess eventually it was bound to happen if I kept getting more specific, I mean we don't even really know why the universe exists to begin with, so... But yeah, you connect a wire to some electrodes, move all its electrons a bit, a little bit of the energy used to do that never comes back out the other end of the wire, and almost if not all of that remaining amount gets turned into heat. The less conductive the wire, the less energy can make it through, and the more heat will be made, but they're not trying to melt the heating element and they have huge batteries available so they probably use metals that are almost completely conductive and send tons of energy through again and again to let a little bit at a time get wasted. I say all this extra stuff because, since the wires are still mostly conductive and so much current can be sent through them, a significant chunk of electricity that reaches the motors will have been ""through"" the heating element first, sorta - in that way, it's actually kinda similar to your old ICE, in that it uses the heat of your power source's inefficiency. The ICE lets the gasoline running through it be wasted a bit, and lets you choose to capture that heat into the cabin if you want. The electric car lets the electricity running through it be wasted a bit, but keeps that waste to a minimum until you ask it to waste more just for the cabin. "
"As others have said, hair dryer.  Very convenient to power up via phone while plugged in (or not, heating air doesn't cost much v's moving the car)."
"Either heating elements like in a regular space heater at home.  
  
Many EV's (but not Tesla AFAIK) also use a heat pump that doubles as a heater and cooler for AC. Just like the fridge or AC at home.  
Since a heat pump is much more efficient than a heating element, it increases effective range in the cold.  
  
~~Edit: Tesla apparently use heat pumps.~~  
Edit2: My edit was wrong."
"Well, in summer you run the AC which also uses energy.

But overall mileage is worse in the winter. I don't know if this is due to the relative efficiency of electric heaters vs AC, or due to the fact that batteries are intrinsically less efficient at lower temperatures."
People commonly report losing ~5 miles of range every day the car isn't used. No idea how much this varies with temperature.
Thanks. I always wondered. I have it in a garage so never had to deal with it. 
"To clarify do you mean subzero in F or C?

EDIT: I'm not trying to be a smartass, I'm legitimately curious. I guess I should just assume F?"
Pretty sure the newer winter package cars uses a heat pump 
I can only assume it’s because heat pumps don’t work too well in subzero temperature. I know there have been many discussions about it but I don’t know the exact answer. 
"Heat pumps become fairly inefficient when you're trying to take heat out of sub-zero air.  its possible, but if the efficiency is low then supplemental electric resistance heating would likely be needed, and if you have to resistance heat anyway, is it worth the complexity to be able to run the heat pump in both directions?"
"> heatpump 

Teslas use a resistance heaters instead of heatpumps."
REALLY?! That means it’s actually more efficient than a radiator! I was always wondering why Tesla didn’t use this method. Apparently they did!
"Well then what you’re describing is level 5 autonomy, which is still very far away. Level 4 is much easier.

Also you gotta be aware that Tesla have a windshield wiper in the front for the front sensors. The side and back sensors doesn’t get as much snow so the heater elements are probably going to be enough. Your Jeep probably relies purely on sensors that are not cleaned off by wipers, on the front side of the car, where heating elements alone isn’t enough.

The only questionable element in a Tesla would be the radar at the bottom without access to the wipers. But if the autonomy program can drive on visuals alone, it might be enough.

That’s Tesla’s ultimate goal actually: to drive on visuals alone. "
Well it needs lots of work then because sensors covered with snow is your smallest concern if you want self driving cars on snow. Maybe in the far future.
"> Can snow accumulation on the front of the radar (on the front fascia not the radar unit itself) cause it to shut off or can it ""see through"" the snow?

My mercedes sometimes presents me with ""Radar sensor dirty, nonfunctional"" when driving while snowing.

"
"Snow is very reflective, whether it's 3 inches or 30."
"Backup cams have been around for like 10+ years on luxury cars. All new vehicles under 10klbs are required to have them starting in 2018 iirc. The Mazda 6 is adding 360° view for the next model year(not a high end luxury car), so I don't expect it to be long before it becomes a lot more common, especially with the proliferation of infotainment systems."
Or just use windows.
Or virtual reality and just never go anywhere!
You mean like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9Jrpcucu7k)?
The newest Emirates 777 interior suites have LCD screen windows with live feeds from outside the plane and it seems very convincing. 
"It's perfectly good for heating, you just need enough power. Long wave IR is no good for heating if you don't have enough power. "
"The IR LEDs on those cameras tend to be at most 150mW, and probably 100mW of that is generated as heat in the diode and conducted back into the car via the power wires. The remaining 50mW is almost negligible."
Might want to consider spending the money on a good ceramic tint to help block the heat. That plus pre-cooling the cabin before getting in would help a lot.
I’ve only tried cooled seats once but I wasn’t a fan. It felt like I peed my pants. 
"I had vented leather on a Lexus once.  It was really nice, but I still maintain that leather is a stupid material for car seats and cloth is the solution (despite having leather in the MX)..."
"I didn't forget it, it was the first thing I said :D

But yeah... I have always wondered if all the cars had the heated wing mirrors or not. It's hard to tell if they are not there, or just terrible. My Audi previously had very good ones. "
Heated mirrors on all.
">Heated window washer nozzles too, not sure if all vehicles have heated wing mirrors or just cold package vehicles.
>Don’t forget the heated steering wheel as well.

How about the door handles?

https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7izdhf/model_3_door_handles_when_they_ice_over/"
Corolla Verso driver here. Jealous
Same! I have a real wheel drive Model S... It's been fun so far ha. Naa it has not been too bad. Had the backend out a few times 
The batteries are liquid cooled so they probably use the same system with a heater to heat the batteries.
The model 3 does not have a heating element like older teslas.  It uses a heat pump.  For backup it can heat the motor which pumps warm water through the battery and cabin heat exchanger.  While driving it uses waste heat of the motor.
"> mostly conductive and so much current can be sent through them, a significant chunk of electricity that reaches the motors will have been ""through"" the heating element first, sorta - in that way, it's actually kinda similar to your old ICE, in that it uses the heat of your power source's inefficiency. The ICE lets the gasoline running through it be wasted a bit, and lets you choose to capture that heat into the cabin if you want. The electric car lets the electricity running through it be wasted a bit, but keeps that waste to a minimum until you ask it to waste more just for the cabin.

Uh, that's not true at all. If the car is drawing power from the battery for cabin heating that is directly reducing your range since it's using energy that could have been used to move the car. There's no free lunch. I believe it can use heat from the motors to heat the cabin as well but that obviously only works when moving and generating heat in the motor (and I believe it's not a lot of energy so typically you'd need to supplement cabin heating with energy from the battery).

Also, for the record the heating elements are separate circuits from the motor electrical system (but still powered off the high voltage battery). Current going through the motor doesn't go through the heater (how would that even make sense, you wouldn't be able to independently control the motor and heating)"
wow thats awesome thanks for the explanation
"> So, if you ask one end of a wire for electrons and give it a supply of electrons at the other end, whatever ones... don't get... to the other side... disappear... and.. become heat?

Not exactly. All the electrons at one end of a wire will make it to the other end of the wire (otherwise charge would build up and the wire would eventually stop conducting).

However, when electrons move along a wire they usually encounter friction, just like a car moving along a road (exception: electrons in a superconducting wire do not encounter friction, like rockets in the vacuum of space). And friction produces heat.

In a wire, this friction is roughly analogous to *resistance*, aka R. The amount of heat produced is R* I^2 , where I is current (roughly analogous to velocity)."
Tesla does not use heat pumps.
Are you referring to a compressor?  
It runs the AC constantly in the summer? I didn't think it would do that
Kelvin
In general non-subzero-centigrade temperatures preclude the formation of ice.
Really? That's cool. Got a source?
They've got both. 
"I agree it's definitely far off, but Elon maintains the hardware in place now is sufficient. That's the only point I'm getting at - is it really sufficient? I'm not so sure. I'm no expert but wanted to throw out my internal dialog for discussion."
"No, I want cooled seats. They're, well, cool! My sister has them. Feels great having the feeling of ice cubes on my balls. Ahhh. Also good for sperm production :D"
Did you? :D
Tesla is all pleather now. Or fleather. Or vegan leather. Next year they're going gluten free leather to complement the dairy free leather they currently provide.
"You’re absolutely correct, I didn’t see that!"
"Is that a thing? if so, could prove to be pretty useful. 

I have noticed on our ‘14 Model S there’s quite a bit of airflow that comes out from underneath the door handles when you reach to open the door. 

I can only imagine that it’s to aid in defrosting a frozen door handle from freezing rain and sleet. "
Have you purchased a set of good winter tires?
"Definitely worth getting winter rubber. Note that the tires your car comes with are summers, not all-season. They become rock hard and slippery as glass when they’re cold."
"There's a separate coolant heater for the batteries, but I seem to recall it's quite low power, around 800 watts.  The cabin air can be heated by an electric heater,  or the heat of the motors and batteries,  depending on the requested temperature and the coolant temperature.  "
I've seen zero mention of this. Source? Because there is nothing on Google either.
"> Uh, that's not true at all. If the car is drawing power from the battery for cabin heating that is directly reducing your range since it's using energy that could have been used to move the car. There's no free lunch. 

Yeah, that's what I'm referring to when I say it normally keeps its waste down to a minimum, until you ask it to increase the amount of waste just to make some heat for the cabin. The part about the electricity in the motors having been through the heating element already was referring to the current itself, not its total energy level. It probably breaks down if you really look at the physics, but just looking at it in an abstract/logistical way, it's all one circuit. Due to statistics whenever you're talking about massive amounts of things there are billions of (electrons in this case), some of the current running through your motors has already been through your heating element, if the heating element has been on at all since you charged up.

> Also, for the record the heating elements are separate circuits from the motor electrical system

Damn, see, I knew it broke down once you looked at the actual physics, and the ""one circuit"" model of thinking wouldn't be literally true. Still, it's easy to keep the irrational part of the brain in a non-literal mode of thinking, and the irrational part of the brain is what makes me want my heat to be coming from engine waste, so it works out. "
"No prob! I always liked how the ICE uses its waste heat, and I always saw it as kind of... something missing from electric cars, until I understood the above. I knew it wasn't rational, but my human brain just irrationally disliked the idea of having a separate power-draw just for heating instead of having a clever way to get heat at no cost. I even saw it as an inherent advantage Mercedes had over Tesla in the luxury market, because knowing you have a big ridiculous beast under the hood that wastes so much energy you can just borrow its heat, *feels* much more luxurious than knowing the warmer you want to be, the less far you can drive. Once I put it into terms of Teslas having adjustable waste heat from the drivetrain's power source while ICEs are stuck at a fixed level, that irrational preference flipped. Now I share it whenever possible, especially if I see someone else having similar thoughts. "
"Woah, the electrons actually get slowed down? But in electrical current, the electrons don't actually flow through the wire, right? They each move, pulling the ones behind them, but it's like the whole thing shifts one electron at a time, not like one set of electrons moves through and waves at the other electrons while it passes by. So the whole movement can get slowed down? Is this what reduces the voltage in a battery while it drains, the electrons losing velocity? This is all trippy as fuck and I'm so glad I found it out because I hadn't gotten to wonder about/learn about this stuff in a long time."
"Damnd.  
I did a (too) quick search, and it seemed like they used it in their winterizing package. Turns out that was a thing some people wanted to be a part of the package.  
  
Anyways - Thank you, edited my edit."
"Were you asking about battery drain when the car is being used or when it's on standby?

The former is significantly worse in the winter, but of course the AC is being used in the summer.

The latter, ""vampire drain"" is very small year round. It's probably higher in the winter but I haven't actually noticed the difference. 

Finally, the car does run the AC when unattended when the interior gets too hot. This can be disabled."
"That is true, and I suppose it's reason enough to assume they meant F, since all freezing temps are subzero for Celsius. That's an impressive defrosting time!"
guy is trying to find out if the previous commenter is saying the defrost works in 5-10mins or if it work in 5-10mins even when it is *really* fucking freezing. the latter is a bigger claim. you're not helping him find the answer
"At least here in Norway, found this Norwegian article, but that will probably not help you that much in its raw form:

""Hva så med norske forhold? Vel, det gjenstår å se, men jeg er ikke redd for kulda og regnet når det gjelder Tesla S. Nå har vi sett at Tesla Roadster fungerer, også i Norge – og på vinteren.

Tesla S har helt andre forutsetninger til å lykkes. Dette er en videreutvikling, og selv om varmeapparat eller klimaanlegg stjeler strøm, så er dette utviklet så bra at det ikke skal være et problem i forhold til rekkevidde/kjøredistanse.

Det er varmepumpe som visstnok tar ut 3–4 kW fra hver kilowatt, og selv om det er varme og kulderegulert batteripakke som også krever sitt, skal det maksimalt ta 20 % av kapasiteten.""

English TL;DR/Translation:

"" What about on Norwegian climate? The Roadster have shown to work fine, but what about the Model S?

The Model S has better chances of success. Even though air conditioning steals power, it is developed to not be a problem in regard to range.

It has a heat pump supposedly capable of producing 3-4 kW of heat per kW electricity it consumes. Even though the batterie pack is actively heated and cooled, it should only steal maximum 20% of the battery capacity"""
"No, they do not. Here's a great thread on why:  
https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/why-does-tesla-use-a-resistance-heater-instead-of-heat-pump.85424/  

Here's shot of the thermal management screen, showing PTC heaters:

"I mean... let’s break it down logically and go from there.

Their ultimate goal is to drive on visuals alone. During a snowstorm (which is probably the worst case scenario to throw at it), here’s what will operate through:

-Front cameras (because of wipers)
-B piller cameras (because it’s on the side, add heating elements it’ll probably do just fine)
-the rear side facing cameras on the blinkers (same reason as B pillar cameras)

Here’s what won’t operate through:
-ultrasonics (because there’s no heating elements OR wipers)

Here’s what MIGHT operate through:
-radar (because even with snow build up, they might be able to make the software compensate for the snow buildup)
-rear camera (depending if heating elements can keep up with the snow kick-up by rear tires).

SO... knowing all that, is that enough for full autonomy?

Well... assuming the computer is powerful enough, and assuming the software is advanced enough, let’s see what you can all “see” with the above sensor caveats:

-you can see in front of you (visual)
-you can see to the front side of you (visual)
-you can see to the rear side of you (visual)
-you MAY be able to detect metals in front of you (radar)
-you MAY be able to see behind you (visual)

For a human driver, is that enough to drive? I would say yes. Many times people still drive even if their rear windshield is frosted over. Because you don’t need to see behind you to change lanes, you only need to see behind on the lane you change into (side mirrors and blind spot checking), which the camera covers.

So ASSUMING they are able to do level 5 autonomy on visuals alone and no other types of sensors, their current hardware should be enough (leaving the physical computer out of the equation, because if that’s not powerful enough, it’s an easy swap)."
"Haha never used them personally, but I’m sure once I do life will never be the same again. I better wait to try them until Tesla makes them (successfully) again."
"Naa, it's been fine. Not enough for me to spend lots of money on it. "
"I've read otherwise. Heard there was a 6 KW cabin heater and 6 KW battery coolant heater. Waste heat from the motors can heat the battery, but not the cabin."
"I believe it was covered by the model 3 owners.  A PDF Spec sheet for the HVAC unit was made public by someone.

"
"> it normally keeps its waste down to a minimum, until you ask it to increase the amount of waste just to make some heat for the cabin.

I still don't think that's completely right. When you ask the car to increase the cabin temp the car just uses the dedicated HVAC heating coils, it's doesn't run current through the motor just to heat it up (the Model 3 might do that for battery heating IIRC - I vaguely recall reading this...).

I'm not really sure what you overall point is though. Yes, the car can use waste heat from the motor and has a pretty impressive and flexible thermal management system. No, that doesn't satisfy all the cars heating needs (like an ICE vehicle). Ultimately from an end user perspective cold and/or snowy driving does have a notable decrease in range of an EV (from a combination of factors: cabin heating, increased rolling resistance with snow and winter tires, battery performs worse in cold conditions). Probably worth noting an ICE vehicle is also affected by the increased drag."
"""but my human brain just irrationally disliked the idea of having a separate power-draw just for heating instead of having a clever way to get heat at no cost.""
 Same way I was thinking about it"
"Like I said, it's a rough analogy.

Current is actually the net movement of *charge* through a wire. High current can physically mean that few electrons are moving quickly, or many electrons are moving slowly. It doesn't matter because either way, the same amount of heat is produced. 

If an atom is missing an electron, it has a positive charge. So current can also mean the movement of an *empty* spot. Think about a row of seats that is full, except for the one on the end. Now everybody moves one seat over. The empty seat quickly ""moves"" to the other end.

A battery uses chemical reactions to produce high energy electrons. As the reactants are depleted, fewer and fewer electrons are produced. The current drops, but the individual electrons are not slower."
"The electrons have an energy, which we usually refer to as potential difference (or voltage).  They drop this voltage across the wire in a heater.  I can't explain the physics behind this though..."
"I actually speak Norwegian, so that's fine :) Thanks!

Anyone know if the heat pump system is the same on S, X and 3?"
"OK, I still can not believe that this is still not more widely known.

Yes, Tesla have a resistance heater to heat the cabin air coming out of the vents.

However, it will also use use excess heat from the drive train to heat the cabin air when conditions permit. Whether you call it a heat pump or not, resistive heating is not the only, and not the primary method of heating the cabin once at operating tempurature.

In the diagram you showed, it is currently running in parallel mode. Meaning the battery cooling/heating circuit is separate from the drive trains. You will also notice that the on the left side in the area that says parallel, there are further pictures showing series running, with battery and drive train coolant working as one system. "
"If Tesla didn't have resistance heating it wouldn't be able to heat when not driving, would it? "
"Depending on where you are and the amount of snow you get, it could be a wise investment. I got new Michelin Ice-X tires with beautiful black rims that I like better than the Tesla ones for $2k.  Considering I’ll probably use it for 3-4 years, and it’ll help my summer tires last longer too, I think it’s worth the investment!"
"The battery heater definitely isn't 6kW. As far as I'm aware the motor/battery can heat the cabin, but it is only going to be useful when the battery is warm."
"> When you ask the car to increase the cabin temp the car just uses the dedicated HVAC heating coils

Yes, thus increasing waste. These heating coils don't create free heat, they drain the battery. Did you not know you get reduced range when you have the heat on in really cold weather?

**EDIT** - You just talked about the reduced range immediately after that. Did you not know what waste is...? I'm really confused. Maybe it's this - ICE vehicles don't use heating elements like electric cars, because their engines are so wasteful they put out tons of heat for ""free."" Electric cars use electric heating elements because they don't produce much heat from their motors most of the time. That's how the connection to heat being waste comes in, even though you're not used to thinking of heat as being waste energy because you use an electric heating element for it and its job is to produce heat rather than putting out that heat as a wasted portion of what it uses to do its job."
"Interesting. Makes perfect sense to my understanding of current and voltage too - voltage is how many electrons, amperage is how fast they're moving(?), wattage/current is those factors combined. Am I getting it now? 

So the friction isn't the same as the friction brakes make. It's not the electrons sliding against something while they pass by. It's just that as you move from one end of the wire to the next, each interaction costs some energy and takes some speed away.

Does that mean the longer you run a heating element, the more electrons it has in it from the ones coming out moving slower than the ones going in? If so, do they all drain out once you turn it off, or do you actually change the atomic structure of a heating element every time you use it? Will the material eventually change too much to carry a current? I'm guessing not unless it deteriorates completely, like disintegrates, since you're just adding more electrons otherwise and electrons don't stop electrons from moving. 

This might be one valid question and then some pointless questions because I didn't wait for the answer to the first one. 

You don't have to answer everything by the way, if it turns into a chore - I'm happy to have new things to be curious about, it's kinda satisfying but really gets old feeling like you have answers to all your basic engineering questions."
"Ahh, a lot of Norwegians are EV people yeah.

I see no reason why the heat pump systems should be wildly different, but it might be a little bit more powerful and a little bit less powerful in the Model 3. But the first models of the Model 3 might not have heat pump capabilities, just like with the Model S. On the other hand, it would make more sense to design the car to be complete from the beginning, rather than needing to retrofit it later "
We all snakker norsk.
It's a heatpump because there is a compressor that is capable of heating or cooling the load (the battery and inverter). They can also direct waste heat/cold into the cabin to some level if the conditions and demand work out.
The excess drive train heat from the battery and other places is often from resistance of some description.
"Yes but it wouldn't be as efficient. The compressor (heatpump!) can heat or cool the battery by shuffling heat in/out of the passenger cabin or the radiators (to atmosphere). If the car is really really cold it has to heat the battery before rapid charging, which is one way it preserves the life of the cells."
"Current and ""amperage"" are the same thing. I was taught that ""current"" is actually the correct term, but both are obviously in use. Voltage is the amount of energy carried by each charge. Power (aka wattage) is the product of current and voltage. 

The current is always the same at all points in a wire, and charge comes out at the same rate it goes in. So I don't think it's helpful to conceptualize electrons as slowing down. Perhaps you could think of a wire as a very congested road. Current is the number of cars that pass per second. 

High current means more lanes and/or faster cars, but they are always bumper to bumper and thus cannot slow down or speed up."
"Funnily enough I'm not Norwegian actually, and I live in Denver."
"I don't believe that the Compressor is used to cool the drive train and batteries. Considering the optimum tempurature is around 80F to 100F (don't quote me) for battery efficiency and the fact that an ICE can maintain 160F  just using a radiator to cool a much higher heat load even with high ambient. 

Do you have a source for that.

Secondly, AC has a much bigger hit to range vs heating while being a much more efficient process. "
"Well, yeah. Of course... Technically that is correct. "
"My bad, I was thinking of current as a synonym for power for some reason instead of as current. 

So if they don't actually slow down, what happens to them to release heat? "
Intriguing. Why would someone in Denver know Norwegian? Family? Been living abroad? Or just very interested in Norway for no apparent reason? 
"You can see in the diagram above ( https://c1cleantechnicacom-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2016/02/20160126_162710.jpg )

""Active cooling target"" and look at the valve directly below the item labeled ""Chiller"". You can see that valve can divert battery flow via the chiller. Under very high load and supercharging ambient cooling is nowhere near enough to keep the battery cool enough. Also in very very hot climates the car will turn on the cooling and fans automatically (even with the vehicle off) to prevent long term battery damage as long as the SOC of the main pack is high enough."
"I think you are assuming that the energy of an electron is determined by its speed. But that's not the case, electrons can inhabit different energy states that don't depend on their speed.

So, imagine you have ten iron atoms in a row, and each has room for two electrons: one at 0V, and one at 10V. Electrons can release energy to move from 10V to 0V, or absorb energy to move from 0V to 10V. They can also move to an adjacent atom, if there is an opening at the same energy level.

All the iron atoms are full of electrons. You have a machine that removes the low voltage electron from the rightmost atom. After this happens, the electrons will start to rearrange. Some will move up, some down, and some sideways. 

Eventually there will be a vacancy for the high energy electron on left side. At this moment, there has been a net movement of one electron to the left, and a net release of energy. Now your machine adds one 10V electron to the vacant spot. This restores the original state. And everything repeats. 

Your machine is a 10V battery. And it is moving electrons, one at a time. The constant loss of energy must eventually manifest as heat."
"Yep, lived abroad for a while."
That's so obvious now that I look at it. 
"I wasn't assuming the energy of an electron was determined by its speed so much as just some sort of physical interaction or behavior or something like that. Frequencies of vibration, linear velocity, mass, etc; I guess my brain was used to thinking of things in terms of how energy is calculated on a macro scale, and trying to apply it to what I know about atomic-level physics like how heat is basically sort of like a measure of how chaotic the vibration of particles is. But I guess I was looking at electrons as the fundamental building block of the world and not even considering that an electron's energy level could be like the temperature of a macro-scale object, determined by something going on at a whole different scale like how an object's temperature is determined by that intensity of atomic activity within it. This just opened up so many doors of physics curiosity for me and so many things I can read about now while having enough context to learn. Thank you so much!"

"They're overrated and overpriced for sure, but if you can get one cheap it's worth it. Just about any place that services bikes can work on one. I have an Italian bike so finding service, if it's needed, is a pain in the ass."
Love that idea (in MN).  Thanks!
That was exactly my plan. You just end up with an extra set of tires is only downside I can see. Want 19” for performance tires.
How do you end up with an extra set of tires? The OEM tires are used in spring/summer/fall. The winter tires you buy are used in winter.
Factory wheels are 18” with non winter tires. So you need 18” winter tires. Then 19” performance wheels and tires. Then you’re left with the tires coming with the car. Unless I’m missing something on that assessment somewhere. Would be great if I am.
"OK gotcha. I was never including 19"" wheels. Just 18s"
Maybe I’m being over ambitious but I was planning on getting 19s for summer tires. But you’re right 18s would probably be just fine.

"For comparative purposes, here is a picture of the heated seats on a F-150. Looks like the Model 3 has much better coverage and uses heating coils rather than a blower-style heater with perforated seats.

"Pure conjecture:

Either residual from OP's hand, or there's waste heat coming off of the seatbelt sensor. My bet is on the former."
"> Wonder why seat belt buckle is lit up as well....

FLIR doesn't really measure the temperature, what you see is the IR reflection which messes with the camera."
"It's not generosity. ICE cars have plenty of excess heat, so cabin heating is very cheap. EVs don't produce much waste heat at all, so cabin heating costs money and range. Heating the seats or other things that humans touch means need a lot less energy to provide the same level of 'warmth' in the cabin."
"I own a leaf. With the non heat pump running the heat on recirculate makes a big difference getting the car up to temp in 15F weather. It gets toasty in as little as 2 minutes. Barely enough time to get out of the neighborhood. Heated seats are the best, I really don’t need to run the heat above 45F during the day with heated seats. "
I thought heated seats come as part of PUP and Its not standard. 
"No, they have two different styles, neither quite matching this design.  I have both thermal images of them on my Cat S60 but I don't have an imgur to share them.  The first gen looks like winding coils, and the second get is rather different with square patches.  The MX seats I believe have the square system as well but that may vary on vin #."
"> I've always wondered how these worked, can someone explain it to me whether these are resistive heated or just conductive coils circulating coolant?

It's resistive heating: here's a [typical universal seat heating set](https://www.ebay.com/itm/2-seats-install-Universal-round-switch-seat-heater-heated-seat-kit-4-pads-/) - it's made of pads through which 12V DC is driven, and the resistance of the pads emits the heat.

Heating in a resistive fashion has several advantages over sending pressurized coolant pipes into passenger space:

- it's cheaper
- it's more robust against damage or in accidents (there's no pipes leaking glycerol)
- it's easy to distribute the heat over the surface (With pipes it's harder to distribute the heat on the seat surface due to their diameter and material requirements. The batteries are cooled/heated with coolant pipes, but there good heat transfer is achieved by using copper. The materials of a seat are a lot more insulating.)
- resistive heating pads have no moving parts - while coolant pipes require valves and a pump

Using resistive heating elements on a car with ~70 kWh of battery capacity is a pretty natural choice.

I also meant to note in the post how fast the seats heat up. Should only take a couple minutes based on what I saw. "
Heated seats use way less energy than heating all the air in the car. 
"> I guess I never really understood the need for heated seats it's not like I'm naked on the seat however steering wheel might be nice, as my bare hands are touching the wheel.

Heated seats come pretty handy if the car was parked out in the cold winter weather for a couple of hours, especially if you are wearing business trousers. 

Even in jeans a cold seat is a noticeable discomfort and a distraction - so it's a safety hazard as well! 😉

Seat heating is also much faster: it's noticeable literally within 10-20 seconds - while it can take a couple of minutes for cabin air to warm up. Seat heating also uses less energy than preheating the car.

It's a good strategy to keep affording a Tesla in the future. Also less individuals with a carbon footprint. Tesla really thinks about the long term game here.

"Plus the resistive heating pulls little power - around 45 watts per seat when on full power. This is roughly the same as the MCU/touchscreen.

Some of the more complex automotive seat heating systems use a complex network of air passages as well. This allows you to also bring cooling air to the under-bottoms. It’s basically climate control for your ass.

If you only heat your seat your interior will be covered in cold water since the warm air you breath will condense on the cold car interior. It's not very pleasant. For a very short trip it should be enough to have a heated steering wheel. For comfort you need to heat the whole cabin.

"I work in the auto industry. Tesla is getting out of body/frame work because they realize they can't do it right. They are shipping out stamping and welding jobs as ""emergency takeover"" right now from stamping operations they own in Michigan. Emergency takeover jobs are usually reserved for insolvent suppliers making parts of current production vehicles. In this case Tesla bought/owns a stamping factory(ies) and their own quality is so bad they're paying outside suppliers to take the work over. Tesla may be looking for a cheap sustainable source of steel, but I doubt they're looking for an ownership stake in a steel mill or forming company. 

More likely they're interested in the power supply. Arc Furnaces use a phenomenal amount of electricity over a short time. It might be an interesting application for batteries to help smooth demand peaks.

"They will not be building so many factories that purchasing and building a $7 BILLION investment in a steel factory makes sense from a ROI perspective. Additionally, why would they build more factories for batteries rather than just completing the gigafactory 1 as was planned? That was supposed to be the largest battery facility on the planet. Building additional factories would not make sense, unless it was in China, which there are plans for. But purchasing/investing in a steel factory will not make the Chinese GF that much cheaper. Very suspect reasoning from Tesla here."
That seems to me to be saying that Tesla would be a much smaller investor. That makes sense. They may be getting a small piece of the pie here and guaranteeing that they will purchase X tons per year similar to the Panasonic deal in GF1. That is way more reasonable and likely the case.
"So is this a fair TL;DR? 

A steel company is applying to the Energy Department for a loan from a fund originally intended for automakers. In order to qualify for the loan, the steel company has claimed it has ""investor interest"" from GM and Tesla but not publicly stated the nature of that interest. 

So this isn't a Tesla project and it's not clear that Tesla even intends on investing a penny. Their interest in the project is as a potential customer for high grade automotive steel. 

OP's title is kind of clickbaity IMO. "
"Here's why this makes no sense: Tesla is hurting for cash. They're burning through billions each year and just announced a semi truck project that is going to strain their resources even further. 

They're not sitting on billions in the bank like Apple. They're having to either get loans or sell equity to subsidize their cash burn.

Investing in a manufacturing plant for a commodity they can simply buy on the open market makes no sense. I'm confident that future reporting will show Tesla's only interest in this factory is as a potential customer, not as an owner. "
Why would they need to control the quality and manufacturing to a degree at which they need to own their very own steel factory when every other automaker doesn't? Clearly there is a missing piece to the story here otherwise other car manufacturers would've already done this years ago. There doesn't seem to be a scenario where this makes sense on any time scale for Tesla.
"That doesn't make any sense. They aren't building 50 gigafactories. There are plans for at absolute most 4 right now, and they haven't even completed the first one yet. Also, no other auto maker needs to purchase their own steel factory to make cars profitably, why would Tesla? It would seem that the cost benefit analysis would suggest to reduce the price to build their cars as much as possible rather than investing a huge amount of money in a steel factory which is almost completely unrelated to their core business."
"But what do they need a steel factory for? Purchasing a steel factory to get steel cheaper to make more factories doesn't make sense from a ROI perspective unless they plan on building 50+ gigafactories (when they haven't even finished GF1 yet). Purchasing a steel factory to get steel cheaper to make cars cheaper also doesn't make sense because the volume they will be operating at isn't cost effective and they wouldn't be purchasing all of the steel that factory makes anyways. No other automaker has determined that getting their steel cheaper would make enough of a difference in their bottom line to pursue it and those companies (Honda, Ford, VW, etc.) make orders of magnitude more cars per year than Tesla has or will for many years. Also, if they are doing it to reduce the cost of manufacture of their cars, it would seem that reducing costs in house and reducing waste would be way way way better than making a huge investment that will take years to return a profit."
I work for a company currently getting some of that business. The Michigan factory used to be Riviera Tool. 
Are we talking about a stamping press as well to reduce transport of scrap? If Tesla's next factory is a couple hundred miles from Durand might be a good idea to just stamp on site and ship just in time.

"This is exactly how SpaceX has been attempting to operate for years—they have far fewer suppliers for parts and subsystems than is typical in the aerospace industry; most everything is done in-house.

Given how much it’s saved SpaceX, it shouldn’t be surprising at all that Elon is trying to vertically integrate Tesla, too. It’s help make SpaceX the cheapest and highest demanded product in town. Sure it’s a different product your making, but manufacturing is still manufacturing, so why shouldn’t it work at Tesla, too?

(Yes I realize rockets and cars are very different beasts to manufacture)"
There were also the issues where other car companies were trying to fuck with Tesla's supply chain. It certainly reduces risk there to vertically intrgrate when there are hostile actors around.
Steel is used to make the Model 3
I think you've hit the nail on the head. The tunnel liners and other components of the system will take a very large amount of steel. All those concrete panels need a significant amount of rebar and plates to connect them. Way more than the amount his auto factory could ever come close to even if it was at 100k cars a year. 
"> new type of orbital launch platform.

No. Next generation orbital launch platform for Musk is the BFR, which is a really big aluminum/COPV methalox rocket. Trying to get things to orbital speed on the ground is an awful idea."
Hyper-loop is my guess
"Hyperloop wouldn’t be it, there’s tons of plants around the US which already build seamless steel pipe."
"Is steel a better choice for this than aluminium?

I'd have thought the corrosion resistance properties of aluminium would be useful for this application."
"That wouldn't need a brand new plant and can be purchases from anywhere.

The only reason it would make sense to build a new steel plant is that the new plant is going to produce a type of steel that existing US plants cannot do or do well.
"
"Hmmmm this is actually one area I have some knowledge. I'm a steel hauler. I'm the go between from the mills to their customers. Steel is made on an as needed and projection basis. The first means a coil from smelt to ship can take as little as two weeks, whereas the second typically means the mills use slower production periods to build reserves of commonly used alloys in guage spec for specific customers specific products, the later is then warehoused and shipped as needed. Incidentally at the time of writing this, we're in the slow season now. Most coils being shipped are buy backs and trades between mills. 

Though this is the best year I've had as an owner operator since 2014. 

TL:dr- Mills can always spare production timeline for flagship customers like ford and their orders are generally made well in advance of needing them."
Meanwhile Ford and GM are using 1000x the amount of steel that Tesla uses. Tesla could never make a move large enough to ruffle the steel industry feathers.
Well Musk did say Gigafactory is going electric even for heating processes. They capped off the gas lines and everything. 
"Electrical furnaces do exist, normally for smaller scale foundries but the technology is possible."
Try to see it from their perspective before you judge them. Their whole family have probably been coal miners. They don’t see a future in anything else. 
"> “these assholes can rot in poverty”

Wow, where have I heard this before... it might’ve been the right when asked about public welfare programs for the inner city. 

By letting these people “rot in poverty” we make them into that much more of a martyr for the right. Of how the countryside gets left behind urban advancement, and it does us no good to play right into that hand.

"Good thing they’re not purchasing and building it then. No figure has even been given yet, they’re just one of the named investors. "
"> why would they build more factories for batteries rather than just completing the gigafactory 1 as was planned?

One won't be enough, they'll keep expanding the one they have and at the same time make one in Europe and one in China.

A steel factory has value even if not selling directly to Tesla, as long as there is enough demand for steel and the factory can remain competitive. I don't know anything about the steel market but I imagine Elon does if he's investing in it."
So all in on $TSLA? Should I wait for the dip or jump in right now?
"Look at the loan, it is for vehicle manufacturing.  Whoever is building the steel plant needed car companies to back them in order to get the loans.

Tesla also doesn't make steel, they buy it.  Any additional suppliers of the high quality steel they need is a good thing for them."
That’s what everyone in this thread has been saying lol
">Here's why this makes no sense: Tesla is hurting for cash. 

It's kind of surreal that people say this over and over every single year with a straight face.

">Tesla is hurting for cash.

No they are not. They are purposely throwing money into R&D to speed up product development and crush everyone to market.

R&D spending is not a loss.  It is a choice.  Tesla could cancel R&D funding tomorrow and they would be profitable.  They are choosing to throw all their money into R&D."

Thats more what i was thinking about. Tesla is still in growing phase so they can't have such surplus of parts, and they can't have long waiting lines for thier parts because they are developing new technologies in faster pace than other manufacturers. Also they can't sink as much capital into warehouses of extra parts because they need money to grow production. This move will make Tesla less violatile and less dependant on its supliers, which is important in this political enviroment."
"It definitely does make sense. Their products use a lot of steel. They don't only make cars, they make Powerpacks and Powerwalls. I don't know if those are steel, but it still makes sense. You are forgetting they are not a typical Automaker, and make more than just cars. Also in a few years I'd wager their core business won't be cars. That's why they changed their name from Tesla Motors, to Tesla Inc. Same like Apple changed from Apple Computer, to Apple Inc. The iPhone makes Apple the biggest piece of their revenue pie."
"Well they accidentally bought sub-par steel from Japan recently, and having a stake in the facility would prevent that in the future.  Could also allow them to work on different alloys to reduce costs.  And just because other automakers haven't done it, doens't mean it's a bad idea."
"This is the first time I had even heard of anything about Tesla involved with this project as far as I know...I would have to say I highly doubt they are a major player in this project I believe whatever company owns the steel mill is the main part funding this project it's not far from flint and I have heard rumors of general motors getting back into the heavy truck world (again rumors) so maybe they will begin to produce vehicles in Flint in large quantities 

Edit: large quantities of heavy duty trucks but like I said the rail road runs right through town "

Seamless steel pipe large enough for the Hyperloop? Isn't it supposed to be 12' wide?
Aluminum is pretty brittle and can't handle vibration well
"Which, as I stated above, would make sense in terms of the hyperloop. Specific alloys with exact specs for magnetic rails. 

Its short sighted to think this is a major expense (thought it appears that way on the surface). Again, my theory is that this is in order to create a long term plan of a launch system which incorporates elements of the tech mastered in the hyperloop projects. The multi trillion dollar space industry would be through Elon in that case, and a couple billion is pocket change."
Appreciate the insight! In what region do you haul? 
Never is a bold word in a world that had to bailout GM.
Dont forget that Ford is also now a major Al consumer.  I read an in-depth article about their new F-150s which now feature a lot of Al as a weight saving measure. The F150 is the best overall selling vehicle in the US.  They had to go out well in advance once they had the new design and make sure their was enough Al supply.   It was some ridiculous amount.

In complete agreement.... I actually liked the Hank Rearden character better than John Galt.
Maybe its not even their factory. Could they just be providing powerpacks?
"Okay so that's at most 3 maybe 4 GF in the world. A $7 billion investment in a steel industry would not make a profit on their investment for years. And let's assume they do, once the GF are built, then what? Now they have this huge factory that produces more steel than they can consume. Will they get into the steel commodity business? How does that fit into their core business mission of accelerating the transition to sustainable transportation?"
"Why are you asking me? I don't have money in TSLA, short long or otherwise. "
"What is most likely to cause a dip now is any further delay with Model 3. If there are no more delays and Model 3 is a roaring success from now on, the price should rise.

tldr; Go all in now, mortgage the house and the barn and everything in them."
"Of course. But that doesn't mean that they have an infinite supply of patient investors. They're willing to subsidize losses now for big gains later, but implicit in that relationship is that Tesla won't piss away their money on pointless investments, which this would be. And the more equity they sell, the more they dilute early investors.

I can't think of a dumber investment when you're cash-strapped than investing in a factory that will make a commodity easily available on the market from a large number of suppliers. This is completely different than investing in the Gigafactory."
"Regardless of how valid the reasons are, Tesla has a burn rate of over a billion a quarter which means just to sustain current operations they need to either borrow or sell additional equity, diluting current investors. That's why I said they're hurting for cash. I didn't say they're unable to raise additional capital, just that they don't have a big warchest like many other companies do. And of course R&D is a perfectly appropriate place to spend money, to build competitive advantage. 

You know what isn't appropriate? Investing in a steel mill. The dumbest possible thing would be for them to piss away capital on a widely available undifferentiated commodity. Any steel this new plant can make Tesla could simply buy on the open market without a massive capital investment. "
"Whether they are a typical automaker or not doesn't matter. Producing cars is their number one business for now and will be for some time. They do not use more steel than any other automaker does, even including the Powerpacks and Powerwalls. "
Flint already has heavy trucking with GM. Infact they had a new addition and investment a few years ago. If you look at this Ohio company hq on google maps they have like 20 cars in the parking lot. Interesting how they will get 7$B. Also 7$B might just make this the largest steel production company in the USA. I did some math. But it's only if they use the micro mill electric arc hot continuous roll method.
Just serrated
"It lowers the risk for your capital, but it can lead to higher operational costs, especially regarding quality control. One of SpaceX’s failures (CRS-7) was purportedly was traced to one of the relatively few parts provided by an outside supplier. To mitigate the risk of another similar failure, they had to choose between either developing tighter QC of parts from vendors or move production in house (I forget which it was). And within the auto industry, the issues with externally supplied airbags has been apparent.

TL;DR, it’s a trade off. You invest more capital to vertical integrate, but it mitigates other risks."
"Well it's GM in particular is suspected of this, see: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/71ifsp/gms_mary_barra_instructed_her_supply_chain_use/ 

They're also known for pushing for state-level legislation to ban manufacturer showrooms (targeting Tesla's business model, not GM's). Although it's not proven about the supply chain, they have acted in bad faith before."
">  Where's this conspiracy theory coming from?

It's a common business practice, it would be more surprising if they didn't, so the motivation stands. Even if it hasn't happened only an idiot would ignore that it could.

"Agreed, not a conspiracy, but ""business as usual"" competition. "
"> Vast decrease in the **rocketful** necessary

What does rocketful mean, or what word were you trying to write?

>easier to attain delta V

Easier by what measure, and at what point in the mission profile? I haven't done any math, but my instinct is that this becomes less effective the higher total mission dv, especially on any body with an atmosphere, because of the forces the payload would be subjected to.

Now they have deeply entrenched steel based infrastructure and mutliple generations of metallurgical experience.  

The steel shore, Chicago to Cleveland; produces the vast majority of domestic steel."
Not to mention that isn’t coal usually used as a source of carbon for making steel?

"Tesla aren't investing $7B in this steel plant, they're likely just one of several investors who are involved in it.

I don't know why they're doing this but maybe it's simply to get a more predictable and dependable supply of the types of steel they need. Maybe existing suppliers weren't able/willing to deliver the products Tesla wanted on the schedule and prices Tesla wanted.

> Will they get into the steel commodity business?

Yes I imagine they will.

> How does that fit into their core business

It doesn't, but Elon is big on vertical integration. He envisions the perfect factory as one where raw materials enter on one side and finished products exit on the other. In the real world there are long supply chains and lots of different factories for different types of goods. Elon is probably trying to bring the real world closer to his vision, one step at a time. The Gigafactory was the first step, this may be the next."
Elon stated that we would need 100 GF's in the world to meet future demand.
"It is not a burn rate.  It is investment in r&d.

Stop pretending that R&D is the same as operating losses.

>That's why I said they're hurting for cash.

They are not, they haven't come close to tapping out all funding sources yet."
"It does matter. They make more than just cars, and quickly are starting to build other types of batteries for home and commercial. The one in Australia is a Prime Example. There is a definite reason for this if it's them and true. They don't just do things willy nilly. Time will tell. We can speculate all we want."

Thats some serious tin-foil hat stretching"
Fun fact: Toyota owned 3% of tesla until the end of 2016 when it sold it shares for around $400 million profit. 
first was a type. The second portion would still require a rocket and additional thrust but it could still be mitigated
We'll see I guess!
"You don’t really need carbon to make steel. Iron smelted from its ore has too much carbon, so they remove it by using oxygen in a furnace until it has the right amount of carbon. The excess goes out as CO2"
*have to be broken
I guess we should still honor the integrity of the buggy whip and horse and carriage makers huh
Do you realistically believe that? Elon has been known to exaggerate...
Yes I get that they are increasing the Tesla Energy sector of their business but Powerpacks and Powerwalls don't use nearly as much steel as you think. If they use any steel (which may not be true it could be aluminum) it will be for the cases and sheetmetal but other than that it isn't like they are putting literal tons of steel into each Powerpack/wall that would justify building their own steel facility.
"Not really - I'd heard of this practice as far back as the '90's. Ironically, from Panasonic, of all companies. The quote went something like ""if you find a producer of an outstanding component, place an order for their entire production capability for one year. In this way, you prevent competitors from using it, and gain an advantage""."
It would have made much more if it waited to sell. 
"They would use electromagnets, not permanent magnets

It's not really a ""we'll see"" sort of thing, rather that permanent magnets wouldn't make any sense"

"Auto analyst here, outside auto dimming on almost 10% of new vehicles globally.

Many think outside mirrors will go away with self driving cars, to be replaced by cameras. Check out this company’s CMS product for outside mirror alternative, very cool stuff "
I'd be very surprised if this feature made it into the non-premium package.
"Shame it doesn't go to the edges of the mirror...

I can just imagine the sun near the horizon suddenly dazzling you one eye at a time as the road slightly curves and it's reflection goes over the edges of the mirror."
"As a repair shop runner I love cars that have these, the LCD freezes in winter and breaks and when the people come in for annual inspection and have to replace them every couple years it really helps my paycheck at between 300 and 1500 for the part alone depending on the vehicle manufacturer"
Hey my Ford Explorer had this in 2001.
"Not to pile on but in a previous life I owned a 1988 Cadillac that had auto dimming mirrors. It had light sensors and would physically flip the mirror up and down (as you might do today on cars without the fancy electrogel whatever). And actually it worked almost instantaneously, unlike the several seconds delay experienced in the more modern version of this."
Does model x have this?  Mine comes next week
"It appears that the Model 3 carries over an issue that I have with my Model X, which is that the chromed side mirror stalk is still there. This can give you terrible glare when the sun is at a certain angle in front of you. These should be black or at least body paint colored. I got blasted by this for many miles on the way home from the Fremont factory after taking delivery of my car."
I can't tell why everyone seems so excited about this feature that's been around in far cheaper cars for many years
"lol, it's the opposite for me. My wife's car has all the features and mine only has a handful (I do have dimming mirrors though!). I feel like the pleb I am in my current car and love driving my wife's car. My Model 3 can't come soon enough!"
"Can they be kept dimmed at all times through a setting, and would that be useful?"
"Have this on my 2015 Ford. It's a nice feature, but sometimes it feels pointless because it doesn't go all the way to the edge."
Does the non-premium come with dimming mirrors as well?

The auto dimming on the X is not sensitive enough.  It takes about 3 minutes of me getting blinded before it dims.
My 2003 Infiniti G35 has dimming side mirrors and rear view mirror
Why don't the dim all the way to edge?
"My relatively old Audi has this too, central and side mirror. It's mainly gadget but you get used to it. Thus when Tesla will be autopilot you will not need mirror at all."

"Please. You aim the mirror slightly out so you need to move your head ever so slightly.

It's a non issue."
As someone that has lived that life before knowing better...agreed.
I disagree. I've driven cars that have dimming mirrors and they either dim too early or too late for my liking. Then I have no way to adjust them the way I want.
"If you get window tints, auto dimming might make them too dark. I know with my tints I no longer use the rear view dimmer because it gets too dark ( the tints work great as a dimmer though.

I've never had a car with dimming mirrors, but my tints have drastically improved binding lights in the side mirrors."
What happens at 8:32 will shock you!
A side mirror on an electric car is just more drag which is why concepts omit it 
"It's listed under ""premium upgrades"" on https://www.tesla.com/model3 so I'd say that's a safe assumption.

I want to know if a heated steering wheel is standard, because it's not mentioned at all."
My 10 year old pickup had this. It’s a nice feature. Everyone should have it.
Depends if you consider it safety or convenience. I'd argue that it's safety. 
None of the many vehicles I've ever driven have a completely full auto-dimming mirror. The edges are always non-dimming. Must be a reason.
Jumping in a little late. My company makes these. They have a chrome ring boarder to cover the epoxy that holds the two pieces of glass together. The people saying theirs goes to the edge have a bezel covering the epoxy. The chrome ring is the nicer more expensive option.
Sounds like a reservation just opened up
The reflective rim coating or plastic bezel are there to cover the epoxy seal and plug between the 2 pieces of glass. I made these for the better part of a decade. 
"It doesn't really bother me on our Model X.  I notice it if I'm looking for it... but as much as it might annoy me... it also has, at times, let me be aware of someone with dim headlights where I see them only in the edge."
"It's called the ""chrome ring"" I work as an engineer at Gentex where these are made.  It covers up the epoxy seal. Also it looks pretty."
You could tape it. 
"I don't think auto dimming is active when the lights aren't on.  I think this is the case with every car that has them as my Model S, BMW, Honda and Jeep never activated during the daytime.  "
My 1992 lexus sc300 had this too
"My 2003 Cadillac CTS has this, and my 2014 Ford Fusion."
Yes the S/X have had this for a while
"Check out the rich guy over here.  Buys a model X and doesn't even bother to check its features and stuff. 

I for instance, would have drooled over every website and every piece of literature relating to the car had I ordered it.
"
"Tape over the sensor on the back of the center mirror so it always thinks it's night/dark outside, and it will remain auto-dimmed all day and only un-dim when there is no light/glare behind you at night.  

They work with 2 sensors, one facing forward to see ambient light levels, and one on the part of the mirror you see that measures difference between ambient and behind you.  when it's dark out but bright behind you, it assumes headlight glare and darkens to compensate.  Covering the ambient sensor makes it think daylight behind you is glare so it goes always-dark, and only lightens when it's dark behind you, and darkens again with glare.  

I see no use for that, but this is how you can do it yourself."
My Model S doesn't have that and none of my cars dating back 20 years that have had auto dimming mirrors have had that.  
"We, uh... don't know.... but it's unlikely.

no
What's with the snark? Not like Tesla is marketing this as some space-age tech. It's just a little detail people don't often see pictures of because it's so common.
"Most of these don't. Some old BMWs had the edge of the glass covered in a back plastic so you couldn't see that border, but nearly all auto dimming mirrors have that border because they don't fill the gel to the edges. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbpb9AsGmo4"
"It's a nice feature, isn't it?"
What? My 09 Audi A4 has this. Been around forever. 
They’re on basically every car over $40k
This has been around for over a decade on multiple (cheaper) cars. Tesla is far from the first.
The Model S already does have auto-dimming mirrors though.
Is that a common side effect of lasik?
I have gotten a bit of glare and haloes too since Lasik in September.
The only issue I've had with Lasik (got it 2 months ago) is I see starbursts if I stare at headlights or street lights
"Auto-dimming mirrors have been around for many years, even on ""regular"" cars.  I had them on an 06 mazda."
It's very cool. Not new though.. Our 2002 vw Passat has this. 
My 2002 buick lesabre custom came with this. 
You're not a car guy are you? 
"You need to get out more. My 2010 BMW Z4 had them, as does my 2015 Ford Fusion. It's a pretty mundane feature."
"I think I get it now. Most Tesla enthusiasts must be car illiterate people. That's how Musk achieves to sell his customers the idea that only he can offer all these futuristic features. You know, the ones that have been standard for a decade in cars from the ICE dinosaurs."
Have them on my Volvo but I don't really find them all that helpful. They also don't seem to activate in sunlight. Maybe that's Volvo's fault...
"well trust me tesla didnt do it first, my audis have had it for over 5 years now. Works great, even with a tinted back window it still works. Fuck hibeams "
My 2013 f150 has them
"My 2000 Towncar had auto dimming rear view mirrors.

It was a pain in the ass when whatever wizardry that actually made the side mirrors stopped working. Half the mirror was unusable and because the mirror was heated, powered, auto-dimming, the part started at $170 each side for knock offs and something like $670 for the OE.

Auto dimming mirrors are great if you like spending a fuck ton of money when something breaks."
My Outback has them
"This is the first time I've seen them on the side mirrors. I've seen several, including my car, have it for the rear view."
LOL
You still driving a pinto or what?
"Depends on where you live though. I’d say life without heated steering wheels are less good, still worth living though. "
"Model S is ventilated, not A/C though. My F150 has A/C seats and it’s amazing. "
[deleted]
"Well, Model S has it but they’re absolutely atrocious. "
Ventilated and AC is very different. Few cars have AC seats while ventilated is very common
$45k for a car isn't really that much. It's also one more expensive thing to break and shorten the lifespan of the vehicle.
"Generally, life without leather seats is nicer."
"Having to adjust your mirrors every night and morning? Yeah, why did they ever think to improve such a thing "
[deleted]
It's also more drag on an ICE car. 
[deleted]
Really?  Mine have all been without a border.
'16 Subaru checking in. Can confirm my dimming mirrors have a bezel.
I remember many older cars from the 90's have full coverage auto dimming center mirror. Not sure what changed but it seems like more and more modern cars are half-assing it for some reason.
Perhaps it's to show off the feature?  Without those edges it would probably be hard to notice the dimming.
Do you work at state street?
They activate when the light behind the car is much brighter than the light in front of the car. There is a sensor on each side.
Awesome!  Thanks. 
Since the beginning I think?   Was part of tech package.
"Honestly I compared it to bmw and audi and it just is so much more advanced that no matter what features it compares to, it wins. 

I’m not rich, I currently drive a 13 year old Honda Civic and I’m upgrading cause I’m using a section 179 tax benefit so it’s not costing me as much as you think. 

I’m excited but little details weren’t a dealbreaker. 

I still think a bmw is more comfortable but just behind in every other way. "
"I'd love to know if non premium has non folding, non dimming but heated side mirrors.  They are so helpful in snow.  Doubt it..."
"Malcolm, is that you?"
"still pissed off how ""heated seating throughout"" somehow doesn't include the backseats"
Its just tesla fanboy-ism getting worked up over a menial thing....
"I had a early 90's Infiniti with it, too. Its not even remotely new. "
"06 audi checking in, also has this. "
'12 A4 (B8) also has em. Premium Plus trim.
Actually my 2014 mazda 6 T has it too. New I think would be around 25k.
Never owned a car over $40k before
It does as standard. 
nightblindness is or was at least in some cases. Its one of the reasons i kept my glasses.
More common if you have large pupils
I had that but it went away over time
"Hmm, that's basically been part of my vision my entire life. Very used to it by now. "
2000 Mercedes have them
[deleted]
I had a '98 Explorer with auto dimming mirrors. Coolest feature I've ever had in a hoopty.
"Yeah, nothing special here. They’ve been around for for some time now. "
94 Lincoln Mark viii had them in rear view as well as side.
My Ford Fusion has them
Yeahaw *spits tobaco* my ford trucks got them dimmin’ mirror thingies 
"I drive a 2005 Mazda...

(no dimming)"
My 96 Ram 1500 had auto dimming mirrors.
"06 mazda what? Mazda 3? If so, what trim level do you have? "
My 2000 Buick had them.
2015 Ford Edge here. 
"Not side mirrors tho, never seen those before."
My ‘15 F-150 has them. 
"With a 1999 Corolla for 13 years, I tend to not see them often. "
"Tesla has attracted people from parts of the market that wouldn't normally spend the money on premium cars or higher trim levels with these features. Musk isn't selling auto-dimming mirrors as a futuristic feature, Tesla has attracted people for many different reasons depending on who you ask. 

Depending on who you ask, it's the ridiculous straight-line acceleration in a family sedan; the new way of packaging a car's interior along with over-the-air software updates to fix or improve things; as an electric vehicle, it's one of the few that can actually manage a road trip because Tesla had the foresight to build the Supercharger and Destination Charging network. And of course, some are attracted to Tesla simply because it's a story of success against the odds - Tesla played a big role in changing the perceptions of people, and the industry at large, towards EV's even if their individual products won't satisfy everyone (which is a tall ask if we're being reasonable, here).

Sorry, but claiming that you ""get it"" and then only seeing it as ""futuristic features that have been standard for decades"" is simply unfair.

edit: typos and stuff"
True for me at least. I wouldn't even be thinking about replacing my 11 year old car if it wasn't for Tesla.
">I think I get it now. Most Tesla enthusiasts must be car illiterate people.

That's been mostly my experience in this sub. 

People also don't realize ""autopilot"" has been around in various forms since before Tesla existed."
Coming soon: Lighted Vanity Mirrors!!!
"You're right. Tesla is making cars for over a century, so of course they had the time and money to put everything from day 1. The question is why don't the car manufacturers gurus made some cool electrical cars if they are so smart. I mean, it must be easy, it's just a motor and some batteries."
Do they work well at night?  My least favourite part of driving his high-beams behind me burning my eyes through the mirrors.  
"They're to protect you from car headlights during night time, not sunlight during the day."
"That's how they're supposed to work. Usually a front-facing sensor is used to gauge ambient lighting conditions. Once ambient light is low (like at night or in a tunnel), and the rear facing sensor detects really bright light (i.e. glare from bright lights), it dims the mirror.

I think the reason it's dimmed in OP's picture may be due to the sun setting behind the car and light levels are low in front of it."
"They're actually typically designed not to activate in sunlight. Usually there are two photo sensors, one on front and one on back. The mirror dims only when the front one is dark and the back one is lit up. This is kind of required, because any old daytime sunlight is like 1000x brighter than headlights at night, so if it didn't deactivate during daytime it would just always be fully dark. "
So like every luxury feature..? 
?
First world problems. 
"Yeah, my Sierra does too. I’m not sure I can give them up. Just might not. "
"My former 2011 F-150 not only had dimming mirrors, but they folded electrically. Oh, and the heated and a/c seats were the shit; nothing like a cool crotch in the dead of summer. "
Like engines.
Not anymore
"Yeah, you’re right. Mine is air conditioned. Awesome!"
You’re crazy. $45K for a compact sedan is insane. The *only* reason I’d spend that much for a non-luxury vehicle is for a car with the technology and intelligence of a Tesla. 
Not to me. Not to me...
"You need to go try it before continuing to criticize me. It's a one time adjustment. The head movement required is almost imperceptible, it's a 1/2 inch at most."
"I drove a work car today.  I turned on the wipers every time I started/stopped it.  Left it running, unlocked, keys in car for 3 hours, and generally failed at ICE car use.  

I still have several ICE cars, no excuses, this was just me being a dunce Tesla owner."
Range and efficiency are more critical in an electric car
"That's disappointing. I guess that's ok when all the cars are going to California, but I hope they add it when they move north."
Perhaps the border is just hidden by casing?
BMW?
"The border on my BMW really annoyed me at first, not sure why it's there, it's possible it's to help you be able to gauge things better.  "
"Older cars used a 2-way triangle mirror prism thing, newer cars use am electronic dooamahicky in the glass"
"It’s a special gel that is sandwiched between the mirror and the cover glass. When a voltage is applied to it, the gel darkens. The edge is probably there because they can’t fill the full area of the glass without risking the gel leaking. There might be glue or some sealant in the edge. Possibly some wiring even. 

edit: To be clear, this is just my best guess. "
Doubtful lol. Dimming mirrors are nothing special.
I started at state st. Now I am at centennial east.
"Hey I was just pulling your leg man. And congrats for the upcoming car.

You are rich by my standards anyway. The thing is, we don't have teslas over in this part of the world. Probably never will. 

The western world takes for granted many things which seem so normal in everyday life, but for an Easterner such as myself, it may be a luxurious item. Appreciate the things you have and love you life. Have a good day!
"
"Yup - It's interesting that Model 3 doesn't appear to have a cold weather option, which I was expecting.

I'm getting PUP so it's not a concern to me... but it definitely should have heated mirrors."
"I'm both am not a Malcolm, nor someone that understood your reference. Apologies."
Isn't the rumour that they are there but not in the current software?
It does. Front heated seats are standard. The PUP adds heated rear seats.
"05 Audi, don’t have it (only on the center mirror)"
"06 Tacoma base-ass model.  No dimming, and no power.  Roll down the window (manually) and stick your arm out there and move it yourself.  If you get blinded from behind, just lean a different way to avoid the glare.

Just wanted to help everybody feel better about what they have."
My pupils get bigger when I’m emotionally aroused.
"Same.  Now I feel like my night vision is pretty good, but I do still note some photosensitivity when I transition to night."
How does it work?
"2013 Hyundai doesn't have it, or at least it didn't come standard. Then again it's the cheapest car in their lineup. "

"My '09 A5, '14 Allroad and '16 F-150 King Ranch have both automatically dimming rearview and side mirrors."
Oh well if you’ve never seen them they must definitely not exist. 
"My daily has them. 2002 S8. All 3 mirrors auto dim.  External ones are heated.  Also, not to blow your mind or anything but when I put it in reverse the passenger side tilts towards the curb. 

Oh, my old 2003 S6 wagon had the above as well. 

I’d go so far as to say mine are better.  They dim completely - no stupid border like these have. "
"I've noticed in Model S ownership that Tesla is a lot of peoples' first 6-figure car, and is often by far their most expensive vehicle purchase.  These owners often skipped the step-up in assorted vehicles that you might expect over the years, like S class or 7 series that fall into similar price and performance categories.  

I wouldn't be surprised if teh Model 3 is doing the same, attracting people to a car that otherwise just wouldn't car to splurge on transportation.

This is the nature of a *revolution* - sort of like how iPhones pushed people to buy expensive phones for the first time... I remember when the iPhone 1 was brand new at something like $400 a waitress asking me ""aren't you afraid to have such an expensive phone?"" and I bet she has had several that cost more by now.  That was a similar revolution in how people look at a type of product; not new for early adopters coming from Treos or Mercedes, but those that leapfrogged over the expensive but not-as-interesting products are wowed at the difference between their last of the old and the first of their new product.  

It's great, it means this isn't a niche, it's a widely adopted vehicle by non-car people."
"I admit I may have been a bit facetious there. 

You make some good points (Supercharger network, acceleration). However, the updates feature has proven to be a double edged sword. People paid good money for the promise of autonomous driving but Musk keeps moving the goal post. I'd be incredibly annoyed by his recent ""FSD is 2 years away"" tweet. And to be honest, I dislike Musk for his constant grandiose claims followed by under/non-delivering."
"I'm not complaining about Tesla cars lack of features - Model 3 does have dimmable mirrors after all. I'm just trying to understand why Tesla fans are consistently surprised by and celebrate Tesla for what are basically industry standards.

"
"They work great at night!
I had never seen them before, either- I was confused at first and thought something was wrong with them..."
"> My least favourite part of driving his high-beams behind me burning my eyes through the mirrors. 

Pull over, get behind them, turn on your hi-beams. I do that, at least when people have hi-beams on when they shouldn't. Like in town, where we have street lights. "
"Must say that I don’t really know, this was my first car and I don’t have anything to compare with. Seemed like a good idea when specifying the car. "
You've aimed your mirrors improperly. Adjust them out slightly so you just barely need to move your head to see them.
Joking aside they are pretty subpar from a fit and finish and feature comparison to basically any luxury vehicle from Germany and even some of the American brands. 
As of when? I took delivery March ‘17. 
Which car?
"You have to figure that a big portion of the car is expensive batteries (edit: what I mean is that the batteries and electric drivetrain alone are an expensive premium over an ICE drivetrain, see next comment further down).  Subtract that from the $45k and you're around $35k, which is nothing for a small luxury vehicle, most of which wouldn't have ventilated seats. I think the car is a great value at $45k loaded, esp. with the $7.5k rebate (for now), plus potential state rebates. I do have an early reservation, the only thing holding me back is the QC and parts availability. That and I want a GTI ..."
Not necessarily true
My 2010 BMW Z4 (e89) has non-dimming edges.
Fancy terminology there.
That is correct. The chrome ring covers the epoxy that holds the two pieces of glass together and the gel in.
The reflective rim coating or bezel are there to cover the epoxy seal and plug between the 2 pieces of glass. 
"That wouldn't be the reason. LCDs work that way, too, and that problem was solved decades ago. "
Tesla got rid of cold weather packages months ago in favor of bundles like pup. Unfortunately.

Thanks. People in this thread forget that Tesla has pulled up interest from places in the market where people would never consider buying premium cars or premium trim levels of regular cars.
"Typically the material inside of the mirror is some sort of electrochromic material meaning that when a voltage is applied to it it changes in color. Basically there is a light sensor behind the glass and in front of the mirror. When the lights sensor detects that there is light coming from behind the vehicle and not directly in front it signals for an electric current to be applied to the fluid. This, in turn, changes the color of the fluid, absrbing more light than if the mirror we're to just be a regular one so you can easily see where the car is while not being blinded. 

Source: Materials Science Student at University

Edit: If anyone has any more questions on it feel free comment or PM me and ill try to answer them! Electrochromic materials are super cool and versatile things!"
"Electrochromic coating on the inner surface of the glass (not the one facing out). When DC voltage is applied - the coating reacts. Depending on the flow of the current, it will either tint or clear. 

Fun fact - if you were to charge the glass to tint and then connect an LED bulb to it, it will act as a battery and the bulb will light up (albeit very dimly).

You may dislike this aspect of his personality, but no one's perfect. I personally think they should be offering an option for refunding FSD now that he's announced a new timeline for its delivery. "
"> And to be honest, I dislike Musk for his constant grandiose claims followed by under/non-delivering.

This is entirely dependent on how narrow a window you elect to frame this in / look at it. Musk may be underdelivering *compared to his grandiose claims*, but he's not underdelivering relative to the competition, which moves comparatively slowly. Which is how his ventures like Tesla and SpaceX manage to cut out their part of the market, draw attention, and push the industries to move along at all."
"I've owned a lot of cars, all 2002-2014 and never had dimmable side mirrors. I would not say they are standard by any stretch. The fact that they are on a 30k car is pretty damn surprising."

"Without the batteries, the Model 3 is a travel trailer. You can’t separate the batteries from the car and call it a $35K car. On top of that, the Model 3 is not a luxury car, even with all its power train intact. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still quite excited about it, but it can’t in any way be called “luxury.” For $45K, I expect ventilated seats, especially in a car the size of a Kia Forte. "
"That’s like saying a big portion of an ICE car is the fuel system and combustion engine... the car isn’t a car without it. Model 3 is a small, expensive car with more tech than most. "
The power density of batteries is lower than petrol. Electric cars for the consumer market typically focus more on aerodynamics to increase range than typical petrol cars. As economy and emissions rules tighten there is an across the board push to improve aerodynamics though.

"My last Mercedes was a direct analog for my Tesla, and was also an E class.  7 seats, 600 horsepower, and well into 6 figure cost.  Even comparing to the inexpensive E class, you're either looking at similar price or giving up a lot for the savings.  We're not every Tesla owner though.  I find that even among Performance car Tesla owners, it's still not stereotypical for everyone to park their Tesla next to an Italian exotic.  

How is the Mercedes autopilot, by the way?  I haven't had a chance to try it out on a recent car, but it sounds great and since it's based on the same AP1 tech Tesla uses, it's probably familiar in function, too, right?

Regardless, it's always a good thing when a product can break down barriers and attract new customers.  We ar ethe *expected* Tesla customers, making the logical progression in our minds from one higher end car to another.  The fact that so many people leapfrog from what they saw as basic transportation to something else they see as a revolution in transportation is how big successes change an industry, and why I compare to iPhones.  We owned Treos and Blackberries, making iPhone and Android an obvious move... they came from flip phones and saw smartphones as a revolutionary product.  They are the ones that made the industry grow so much, not us."
"My brand new Nissan Leaf has a dimmable rear view mirror, but I've never even heard of dimmable side mirrors before.

My brother also bought a brand new ~~Cadillac~~ Buick Enclave over the summer, and it's got the same dimmable rear view mirror, but not side mirrors. Instead, they just tilt down a bit when the rear view mirror dims."
"I'm just saying that the batteries (& motors) alone are a premium over an ICE drivetrain. So deduct that premium (I made up the $10k figure but it's probably the right ballpark) and you should be comparing it to other $35k cars. And it is definitely much more lux than a Kia Forte.

Edit: A Forte has a dashboard, I'll miss that.

Edit2: I agree, it's not a luxury car the likes of, say, German cars in the same price range. But it has a few luxury features - premium wheels, high end details on the body (chrome accents and good paint, nice bumpers), nice UI, driving assistance, OTA updates, leather, it's quite fast, probably a good sound system, etc. What's missing - LED fog lamps, power seats (strange), folding mirrors. The interior won't be 5 Series quality. But it ain't no slouch if you agree with my $35k reasoning, and after rebates it's arguably a great value."

"Some of the issues with using electrochromic on very large things involve discrepancies involving the amount of voltage applied and the resistance the gel has to the current. If the desired area is very big, a larger current must be applied. With that, the risk of burning the film present in the solution is great. Typically, if you have a large window, for example, that you wanted to apply an electrochromic material too you need a great amount of power to do so, otherwise you would see a gradient in the effective area of the electrochromic material. 

Variable tint is possible with electrochromic materials intrinsically. If you apply less voltage, depending on the type of material you use, you get a more transparent look than if you apply a larger current. 

That being said, the technology of electrochromic materials is expanding extremely quick. Who knows, maybe a solution for covering large windows is right around the corner."

"Awesome, really cool. My '97 328iS has speed-sensitive wipers, but not rain sensing. It does have a heated wiper nozzles and heater side view mirrors, but neither are auto dimming. Are you in the US?"
"No clue on the current Mercedes AP, I last owned a 2004 Mercedes so it had none of those features. I came from a Touareg TDI to the Tesla. All of these were bought a few years old. The X is literally the first new car I've ever bought. All my new vehicles before this have been motorcycles.

(and funny you should mention Treo - I actually went through the Kyocera 6035 and 7135, then Treos, then Android)"

"It’s certainly nicer than a Forte, but then again I can buy two of them for less than one Model 3. Also, you can’t factor the rebate into the cost. Not everyone who buys this car will benefit from the rebate, assuming it even exists much longer. And yes, I’m using myself as the example.

Look, I’m not arguing that the Model 3 is a pile of junk, by any means. All I’m saying is that the car is not as well appointed as a $45K car should be. And stop taking the power train costs out of the value equation. They are a necessary part of the car, so they must be factored in. Actually, they’re the best part of the car, so to take them out is to reduce the quality of the car to the point that even $25K is too much. I’m excited about Tesla and the Model 3 because of the control tech and autopilot. If they had the same software and EAP systems on an ICE for $35K, I’d be down with that. At least I’d probably get real leather and AC seats, just like I have in my top trim level, full-size V8 pickup for less than the cost of a Model 3. "
"For the most part, electrochromic materials are quite inexpensive. The issue mainly lies in the application for larger surfaces."
"I mean, there are a lot of expensive vehicles and they don't have it either. 

You have an example that's not a one-off custom job?"
How about the rolls Royce sunroof?
"I am in New Zealand, When the rain sensor is not working (like half the time) the seed sensitive wipers drive me up the wall. I also put rainx on my screen and that also was a big regret.

Heated nozzles yep! The only place that the windscreen doesnt haze over when cold/wet in mornings."
"Shit, buick enclave. They're both gm, I got them mixed up."
"Good points all around. I'm not factoring the rebate into the cost, just saying it drastically improves value if you can get it. And I'm not wrong to deduct the power train premium in order to make an apples to apples comparison. A $35-45k BMW will offer similar performance so clearly you are paying to support EV tech and adoption. Plus decreased operating and maintenance costs but these are all rough figures.

However, one thing you are forgetting that really helps your argument is that the Model 3 options to well over $50k IIRC.

Off topic, but here is an interesting take on why the 3 is better than the current S in many ways: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6swl45/tesla_called_me_regarding_my_model_3_reservation/dlg3uul/"
Makes sense
Some Ferrari 612's had an electrochromic roof.  http://cdn1.automobilesreview.com/img/ferrari-612-scaglietti/thumbs/thumbs_ferrari-612-scaglietti-03.jpg
"No examples, not sure why it's not a factory option on fancy cars. I'm sure there's some reason"
"I've been eyeballing the 2019 Subaru Forester and auto dimming side mirrors are optional.  I think they've been optional for a couple years now, but I may be wrong.

Once we created auto dimming rearview mirrors it just makes sense.  Hell we ought to look at it as a safety feature, not a luxury."
"> Heated nozzles yep! The only place that the windscreen doesnt haze over when cold/wet in mornings.

You mean the hood?  Are they heated even when the car is off?  If so, I never noticed that.  I rarely drive her in the winter - salt."
"He’s asking about windows, not mirrors. "
"I believe they are electronically heated. How you mean by the hood? I just get warm spots on the screen from warm water.

We don't get snow or ice, or salt on roads. I can drive all year around :)."
Oh!  Whoosh right over my head.
It's amazing to think that Model 3 is going to blow this VIN number out of the water in a few months... Congratulations on your new X! It looks beautiful.

"I’m getting the same color X (but with black interior) next week and was having second thoughts of on the color but it looks beautiful, no regrets now. "
"Also, if anyone has any questions about the car, pickup process, anything at all, just ask away! I'll be happy to answer. "
"""Huh, I hope they have good ventilation in there or else the exhaust will be a problem."" -my brain before coffee this morning."
"Damn. We got a white X to play it kinda safe and I regret not going with that color. I don't know you, but I'm excited as hell for you. You have a lot of fun journeys ahead of you. The X is the best Tesla made IMO."
"She’s an absolute stunner! Congratulations to you and your family, may you see countless miles of happiness :)  Welcome to the fam!"
"My father have had his X for exactly a week now, best car he ever had, he has owned more than 70 different cars. That says something :)

Enjoy it my friend."
Congrats on your new beautiful vehicle!

"I have a dream , 

One day Model 3 has 6 digit's in VIN numbers"
"I love that color! My Model X 100D is blue and I love that color, too. This car is really fun and I know you're in for a lot of exiting drives ahead! "
We own one of the first 1000 Model X and I just got my Model S P100D! They’re amazing cars glad to see more people buying them :)
I need Tesla to make a pick up truck please and thank you 
Love that dark metallic grey color.  It was in the top color for me until I admitted to myself that  I rarely wash my cars.....  Enjoy it!  
Omg that's gorgeous
And I meant every word of it :) 
I’ve had mine (pearl white) for 3 weeks and I’m in love!  Best decision!!
Did you have any problems with build quality? I was supposed to take delivery of my X last Wednesday but ended up not taking delivery after seeing too many issues with the car 
Love that color!
"Just for fun:

!vinbot Model X #73215"
And...??? Any other thoughts? Congrats!
Very nice. Hoping to have a delivery of a Model 3 in a few months or so.
Did you get the new mobile charger or the old one?
Congrats!!!
Congrats!
I love you
I loved that day!  It's all ready for me to pickup in the show room.
"Would be perfect if it was bigger, still nice though."
003365 myself. Enjoy it.  Great car. 
Serious question. How much do you need to make to drop 100k on a car?  
Congrats!

Congrats 🎉🙌
That color is insane! Looks fantastic. Congrats! 
"I took delivery of a growler of “death by coconut” today.  So, I’ll enjoy a pint while reading this post."

Yuck. 
"I really hope it does, electric truly is the future. Thanks, I couldn't be more happy with it!"
What color is this?
"We’ll see, Tesla likes to overpromise"
"Congrats to you as well! The anticipation of picking it up is killer, but well worth it I promise. "
"May I ask, did you go for inventory or a custom order or something else? It's my dream car which I never thought I'd achieve but it's actually potentially achievable for me now. It's still a lot of money and pretty much double the price of a very nice car where I live so struggling with these thoughts and decisions. "
Congrats to both of you!  I picked up my very 1st Tesla (X 100D) on Thursday!  Still giddy with excitement.  The Tesla family continues to grow! :)
"I was skeptical of the colour at first too, but it's incredible. There's a distinct sparkle to this paint that you don't see in the other colours. Not sure what rims you plan on getting, but I put black rim winters on and the entire look of the car was changed. "
Which seat configuration?
Do they fit a charger at home as part of the deal?
"The white was a close contender when picking the colours for my car, I was in love with the white and black rims look. Ultimately the deciding factor was all my previous vehicles had been white so I wanted to switch it up. Also, let me take your comment a step further, The X is quite possibly the best vehicle ever made. period.  "
This may be the kindest comment I’ve ever received on reddit :) Thank you so much!
"I am in complete agreement with your father, I  sold a 2016 Land Rover for the model x and it has already blown it out of the water. 

Thanks! "
What does your father do. I'm so jealous 
Thank you!! I have never liked a vehicle as much as this. 
Your vehicle...give it to me. I need it. 
My one regret is that I didn't get one sooner. Incredible machines. Congrats on your Model S!
"Unless I'm mistaken, there were rumours a while back that a pickup truck was apart of Elon's master plan for Tesla! With the semi right around the corner it doesn't seem far off!"
Thanks :) Gotta give it to Tesla for making a damn nice car
"How is it that I've had buyers remorse after buying $50 shoes but never once after buying a $130K car?? :-) I'm in love, too! "
"I have a 53xxx VIN.  I have quite a few issues, some nitpicky some not.

The biggest issue with the X that Tesla doesn't have a permanent fix for is the front-end shudder when accelerating.  My X is currently at the SC for the 2nd time in 3 months of onwership to fix the following issues.

1. Seat crease and creaking that won't go away (They're replacing it)
2. Moisture in tail light (replacing)
3. Moisture in B-pillar camera (replacing)
4. Stress crack in front windshield (replacing)
5. Both falcon wing doors would creak (fixed)
6. Rattle in A-pillar speaker (fixed)
7. Sun visor rattle (being fixed)
8. Rear bumper paint was very thin, could see the plastic through it (fixed, repainted)
9. Charger door wouldn't close all of the way (fixed)
10. Rattle coming from passenger seat bel theight adjuster (being fixed)

And the biggie...

11. Front end shudder when accelerating or cruising above 70 MPH. (Not fixed, refused to fix).

I've been on 2 test drives with them and of course it doesn't happen anywhere as bad as it does when normally driving.  Their ""fix' has been ""drive in low suspension mode"".  However, that's not a fix, that's a workaround.  I should be able to drive in Standard and not have to deal with it.  It's so severe 2 of the rattles were caused by this shudder.  As I understand it they have a temporary fix which is to replace the front axles but it'll come back in 10k miles.  Apparently they are working on a permanent fix but I'm getting frustrated with this right now.

I still love the car, though.  Most of the other issues are flaws, not dealbreakers and the SC has been very accommodating with fixing issues and listening to complaints.  So far I've gotten a X P100D and a S P100D loaner so hard to complain too much."
"The pickup date was delayed about a week due to the charging door not opening and a scratched tail light. So that was a bit off putting. The only thing I've noticed so far post pickup, is the little shelve under the screen is misaligned. (There's a gap between the screen and that shelve). I think /u/ChadMoran had a much better summary, though I am yet to experience any of the mentioned issues, and hopefully never will. 
"
What issues?
"I think in about a week I'll post a comprehensive write up on my thoughts. However, I will say that I am absolutely blown away with the quality of the car, the handling in inclement weather (I live in Canada and there's been a snow storm over the last few days), the autopilot is phenomenal. There is something addicting about the steady acceleration, and how smooth it is. I can definitively say that electric is the future of the automotive industry. 

Edit: Spelling, thanks u/dalmatica"

"That question can vary from person to person, in Ontario there is a $14,000 government incentive, and I traded-in a Land Rover. You could also look at financing options, which depending on your model could be about $3,000 a month."
Maybe the better question is how much do you need saved. We paid cash for our Model X 100D because we got lucky here and there and had a lot of money invested. 
Yes it was a custom order 
Wow I see someones in a bad mood... Who hurt you?
"Constructive commenting, it's rare to see such a thing on reddit! Have a fantastic day :)"
It’s beautiful! 
">electric truly is the future

This may not be the best place to ask this question and I'll probably get down voted a lot, but aren't there limitations to the materials needed to create batteries, like cobalt? I've always wondered if it was sustainable.

Regardless, I can't wait to buy my first Model 3 when I graduate from college. And I'm happy you took delivery for your Model X.

"
"Midnight Silver Metallic, I think. Next to it, is silver, for comparison."
They over promise on timelines. But they always deliver eventually. People have waited 2 years. They just have to make the damn things. For every person canceling a reservation several more are making them. 
Same whining happened with Model X. I got vin 0045xx end of May 2016 and now we see higher than 75xxxx. Patience is a virtue. 
"Almost every car programme I worked on has been “late”.

It’s generally a good sign. It means getting the car right is more important than the sales dept and bean counters whining to the board."

"We have the pearl white and it has a beautiful glisten in the sunlight, it’s amazing "
What did you named your X?
"Gotta say, the pic of your car looks beautiful. Usually this is my favourite car colour...but Tesla's version puts too much blue in it imo. I think they should've gone more grey than ""grey with a hint of blue."" Your car though has the least amount of blue I've seen. Maybe they've tweaked the colour?

edit: What does it look like out in the sun?"
Which color is it?
"I got the standard rims, I like the look of the carbon rims "
"Got the 6 seat config, the captains seats for the rear passengers are a must in my opinion. Really makes the car feel like a space ship. "

"Unfortunately no, the car does however come with a charger, but it’s far to slow to justify using only that. I purchased the in-home charger, which had to be installed by a professional electrician. Well worth it, the car charges at a rate of 55 km/h. "
Think I might agree with that. I love white cars but this looks phenomenal in this color. Is it the white interior? 
"What are the big differences (aside from the electric drive train)? I like the idea of a Tesla SUV, but the X is so....bulbous. "
No way! It's my birthday present for the rest of my life :-D
That would be great. I’m planning on getting a 3 but a truck would be awesome for the camping and fishing trips. Gorgeous looking car BTW 
"No need for rumors, it's in the [master plan](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux)"
"My issues seem minor compared to yours, but we should not have to deal with this regardless.

I'm meeting with my sales guy on Monday to see what my options are. 

My vin is 75XXX. 


1. Silver plate in the truck had a dent in it where the trunk would attach, this was something that was obvious if they had bothered to open the trunk before attempting delivering the car me.

2. Black running board on the left side of the car was extruded, could see the holes where it would attach.

3. Front bumper was misaligned, this was super noticeable like it was really off.

4. Dust and oil smudges all over the interior, was told car had been detailed the day before.

5. Front drivers seat had dirty streaks on the top part of the seat.

6. Rubber water seals were not attached properly, the seal on the front passenger side was not even attached was dangling from the door. The rubber seals were messed up all over the car.

7. The seat backs had scuff marks on them.

My issues were mostly cosmetic, and it would've be fine if they said there issues with the car and that they needed to fix them before delivery. But what really pissed me off was that it seemed like they didn't even look at the car before attempting to deliver it to me. 

The store has a X75D in the showroom, and I asked my delivery guy why the 75D was in much better condition. He said 'because its on the showroom floor'. I couldn't stand his shit anymore and left. 


My past cars include:

1998 Camry
2006 Lexus RX
2009 BMW 550i
2017 Accord 

All of them were in great condition when I bought them.
"
The common shuddering issue occurs on heavy acceleration from about 20-40 mph.  If your car is 'shuddering' while cruising at 70mph you have a different problem that needs to be addressed.  
"Yeah as much as I've had issues I still love the car.  But as someone who works in software I can understand that if you don't feel the pain you won't ever prioritize issues.  So, if I discover issues I wil be sure to report them to Tesla.  I also plan on extending our warranty out to 8 years, we'll have this car until the wheels fall off."
"I just replied to Chad.
 
You should definitely go through your car in detail. My issues were mostly cosmetic, and so I'm not really worried about them not being fixed. I'm just disappointed they tried to delivery the car like that. "
Look at my reply to Chad
Take some pics of your 7 seat config all laid down. I have a 6 seater but wish they'd had the middle folding row when I'd ordered. I would've gotten it.

It truly is a sight to behold.  
"I think there is a limit to every resource on the planet in some way, but what we use to make batteries is fairly recycleable. When you upgrade your 3 in 10 years, the battery isn’t just going to landfill, it will be recycled to produce new batteries. "
"Short answer, no. 

Long answer, Cobalt is interesting because it is actually a second product of mining other metals(nickel mostly, I believe) and it hasn't been economically viable to mine just cobalt so far. The issue with nickel and cobalt is it comes from DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo), which is an area in perpetual conflict, partially because of these mines. Tesla, i believe, only gets about 20% of its materials from DRC and is trying to move away even more. These are extremely abundant metals, however too widespread. Lithium, for example is in regular dirt that's probably below your yard. So no, it's not running out, but be careful how much you support the mining of these metals.

Also, as /u/outdoorsaddix  said most of these materials can/will be recycled in the future."

" Everything we do has an impact on the planet. All we can do is measure the potential impacts and make our choices. 

Mining cobalt from the Congo is not great. Burning oil is intractably much much worse. "
"There are a LOT of new technologies being explored as far as batteries are concerned, so hopefully it will be a lot more sustainable in the future. Currently, I do have my doubts. One particularly interesting tech is looking to replace lithium with sodium. That should solve a lot of issues, including sustainability and price. "
I never said they wouldn’t deliver. The comment says they are going to blow this vin out of the water in months. Considering the issues they’ve had producing the 3 I find that very unlikely. 
"> For every person canceling a reservation several more are making them.

Source?"
"Thanks for answering. How long did you look at inventory for? I've seen one so far but missed it. I'm in the UK btw so a bit different here.

Is the tax rebate as self employed? I am registering my own llc and have been trying to figure out if it's worth buying as a business to save on vat. From what I can tell it's not on a new startup. "
I live in Arizona as well. Want to give me a ride ;)
"Haven't landed on one yet, but I'm leaning towards 'The Batmobile' or something along those lines. I feel like the dark grey is fitting for that name. "
"Even better, the sparkle from the paint really shows through. That is, as long as you keep it washed, which is going to be miserable in the Canadian winter."
I almost went with the 6 but I liked the extra storage of the 5 seater. 
"kw/h?

"
"The regular charger that comes with the car will charge with 55 km/h out of the box. You don’t need a special charger to achieve that speed.

If someone told you that you need the home charger to get that speed? They are full of crap.

The home charger can in theory support up to 84 km/h ‘if’ your Tesla got the dual charger option. But it usually also requires upgrades to the power line going into your house.

In Europe a 3-phase supply is the norm. Meaning that you won’t be able to enjoy 84 km/h since it is maxed out at 11 kW.

So if you are running 55 km/h on a home charger? You either lack dual chargers in your Tesla? Or you lack more than 11 kW running into your home? or both.

55 km/h can be delivered by the mobile charger delivered together with the car."

"The land rover is significantly taller, which I don't miss all that much. The tech in the tesla is far better than the Rover, for example: The media screen on the rover was unresponsive and overall quite limited in terms of what I could do. The rover also had adaptive cruise control, similar to the tesla, however, if the vehicle in front were to slow down past 20 kmh, the cruise control would just turn off. The other big difference is handling, especially in bad weather (snow/ice). The Tesla is magnificent, possibly due to its weight and improved TC, it feels planted at all times. The rover wasn't terrible in snow, but nothing like the Tesla. Hope I answered your question!"
As a $TSLA investor I’m worried this problem is going to be exaggerated when people are taking delivery of their 3s. 
They're both occurring.  I get it under moderate acceleration as well.  My car in low shudders worse than our X75D loaner in high.
"Sorry, I got the 6 seater too :( No regrets on my end, I love the space age feel it gives the already futuristic car. "
"Oh sorry, it would have to be gen 1, the charging rate with my wall connector is 46A if I'm not mistaken. It was purchased about a month ago, so if gen 2 was recent I may have missed out :("

"Also you can’t forget the guy that called me a ‘fucking douche’ because he thought I just went to a showroom to take a pic for karma... which might I add is completely false. But yah, this is a great community of great people for the most part! "
"Which color is this, silver or grey?"
"Plus, battery technology and required chemistries are subject to change. Not to mention improvements in efficiencies."
"Also to add to your response, batteries can be repurposed for storage applications long after they become to depleted for automotive. A battery pack that's cared for and maintained with a charge can be used for power storage for at least 15-20 years before is considered scrap."
"Sudbury, Ontario and Cobalt, Ontario are also sources of nickel and cobalt."
"http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-cancellations-how-many-2017-8
63,000 cancellations. 1800 reservations a day once they started shipping to employees. I haven’t seen more recent numbers, but if you do the math and figure the reservations have gone up recently since ramp up. It’s pretty clear they’re not at a net loss. "

I named my white S as moonpie 🌒. It has slipstream grey wheels on it. 
"Share a pic or two of it outside in direct sun, if you don't mind. Enjoy that Canadian winter! *(What is this thing called winter?)*"
Nope! The estimated range of the vehicle will increase by 55 km each hour.
"The in home charger that I purchased is capable of 240v at 48A, which results in 55km/h avg. But your right, depending on the tesla you could have up to 17.1 kW for up to 80km/h charging. There's certainly no issues with the power running to my home I can assure you. Simply a matter of the capacity in which the car can charge.

"I bought a smart electric in 2013, and it was by far the most surprising car I’ve ever owned.

Wait what!?! Impossible....

"That 1,800 per day was over about four days, and that was over four months ago. If it'd carried on like that then it would have been another quarter of a million reservations, Musk would be screaming it from the rooftops, but he doesn't."
"Oh you're much faster than me, I did the same but don't have my full deposit yet. Ah we don't have any tax rebates unless you buy as a business car and get vat back. 

Congratulations on picking up your S today, very happy for you enjoy every minute! Would love to see a picture. "
"I'll have to get back to you on that, first because its dark outside right now, and two, it's an absolute mess from all the snow..."
"Hmm... interesting. I never would have thought to measure it like that, but it's probably way more practical. "
"[thats fair, I suppose you have every right to be skeptical...](https://i.imgur.com/v3EyHa7.jpg) "
He would? You must have missed the part where they were anti-selling Model 3’s until they could at least ramp up. Even if if it’s dropped to 1000 a day. Or 100 a day. That many people aren’t cancelling reservations. 
Yeah that’s an interesting method but clearer for the average consumer. 
"> increase by 55 km ea

The car reports all of the details related to charging - and nicely converts it to km/h and, for those of us on miles, mph.  As an example to his 55km/h in-home speeds, the Supercharger network can push that rate up to 250 mph. I'm sure they can go higher, and depending on the state of charge of your battery, it can be slower.  "
I'm a big fan of how this played out.
"I love that song! Also, I'm guessing you're not in the US. That or your going really fast! "
