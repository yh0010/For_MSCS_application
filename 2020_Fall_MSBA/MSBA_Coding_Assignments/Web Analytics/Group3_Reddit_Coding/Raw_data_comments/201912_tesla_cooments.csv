"Cybertruck is going to be a disruptor within the disruption tesla is. A smaller cybertruck for 35k is approaching the mass adoption threshold. Come think about it if you factor the longer life (quality of materials, no obsolescence approach, OTA updates) and how cheap it is to maintain (electricity cheaper and more available than gas, no oil changes, longer brakes life, etc) probably it would be as cheap to own during 10 years than a  25k ICE car.

Edit: grammar"
CyberTUK
Oh id buy one looks like in my price range.
Living the attention to detail to include the broken glass.
Nice touch with the windows...
I'd get one.
I know this is probably a joke but I would honestly get somthing like that. I really think single passenger electric cars that cost like 10k just to get people to work and back is the future. I can't believe more people don't have something like that.
"Joke all you want, but I would totally buy this."
Actually the crowded world in SE Asia needs these as well as motorbikes and small delivery vans.

There is actually an electric Tuk Tuk manufacturer in Denver. It's called eTuk.
"Love it, though it doesn't need the ground clearance. Any terrain rough enough to require that clearance would probably also tip the tuktuk on its side.

"Competition and volume. There's millions of EVs sold every year in china from scooters up to buses.

"Because a lot of Chinese companies already cornered the market.

Gogoro also exists and has a great product and SEAT, Spanish car company, just jumped into the European market with their thing.

Plus it's mainly a low margin high volume market.

Tesla can't produce high volume just yet."

Tesla has plenty of positive and negative brand and is well out of the space of “bad publicity is better than none”.
R/theydidthemath
Grammatically works either way.
I keep a $25 air compressor in the frunk. I use it fairly regularly. It's super handy.
Tesla should also open super chargers at freeway exits with nothing else there and buy up the cheap land. Put in high tech Japanese vending machines for quick snacks and then eventually those exits will be the most popular and businesses will be begging to rent land near the charging infrastructure.
The problem is the long term maintenance of having such amenities.  I can see how it can cause more problems than solving for Tesla.
I would start with the windshield squeegees before air compressors.  They are what I miss most about gas stations.
FYI some superchargers are getting these already. Kettleman City has squeegee stations and air pumps.
[deleted]
In a not so distant future. Just politely ask the cybertruck charging next to you. :)
"- Active ONLY when a car is charging otherwise expect more ICING
- Air compressors tend to fall out of repair OFTEN from what I have observed.. This would ad a lot of maintenance to the charging stations"
Air isn't free due to inflation.
"Do the newer Tesla's/model 3 not come with one anymore? My 2015 Tesla has a whole Tesla branded air pump + tire patch kit powered by the 12V. Was in the side well in my truck.

EDIT: apparently this is a Maryland thing (and probably some other states). Guess that's the yang to the yin of the front license plate."
"No, don't spend $ and resources on this.  Plenty of gas stations.  Spend resources for more chargers or better service.  OP has good thoughts but Tesla has bigger fish to fry."
"Why add the 'free' part? Tesla is still a business. Also how would you stop non owners from abusing this service. 

Just buy an air pump yourself on amazon, so much more convenient."
"> an operating air compressor 

Sites with staff on location have a hard time keeping these things up and running. I'd prefer to not have them at Supercharge sites at all vs having broken compressors at them. There are plenty of other places to do this, redundancy sounds expensive and actually kinda useless.

If we're making recommendations on how to spend Tesla's money for free things at sites, how about super fast WiFi, free hot dogs, and bathrooms?"
"I’ve heard good things about the Xiamomi digital tire inflator. $40 or so online and easy to take with you.

Seems like a better option than Tesla setting up and maintaining physical units at supercharging stations IMO. Tires in good condition shouldn’t be losing air."
I’d be stoked for a trash can.
"Bicycle tire pump is my pick. 

You get to do it at the comfort of your garage/home/front yard and you get a nice work out.

"In my frunk, I keep a small 12v air compressor and a squeegee & rag with Windex. Besides rotating tires, that's about all the car maintenance you need."
Just ask a cybertruck to use their compressor.
Kettleman city has air and squeegees.

They should also have hotdogs. And popcorn while we watch Netflix.

"If they do, usage is going to rise at least slightly.

The ones at Wawa's and Quick Checks have them
I would be happy just to have a garbage can at superchargers.
"Good idea! I would also like to say trash cans! Most superchargers have trash can's, but not all."
Soon will just have to ask the cybertruck charging next to you.
Free? FRRRREE?!?! FREEEEEEEE!??! Pfffft. Pay for your air like the rest of us you freeloader.
"Yes! I'm so excited! As a redneck, spontaneous acts of roadside assistance are in my blood.  The Cybertruck (which I, and most of my buds have preordered) comes with an air compressor.  Elon Musk gave us a pick-up and gave yall free roadside assist!  Remember, when traveling the South, if you breakdown *don't panic*!  Three men in a pickup will be along shortly to fix your car.  

On a related note, y'all seen any toolboxes for the Cybertruck, yet?"
How has no one invented a rim with a centripetal air channel pumped up to 100PSI+ and a valve that keeps your tires perfectly inflated for the life of the tire?
I understand Elon Musk is quite active on Twitter...but just buying a 12v air pump and maybe a can of tire slime  (Available from Tesla online-you have other shopping options!) would give more peace of mind...
I think that's great idea in theory but this will also invite non-tesla cars to visit superchargers and then block the charging stations.
"For such a high tech truck, why not have airless tires?"
bike pump
"Just wait till the CyberTrucks start showing up, they have one onboard"
Yeah.. they aren't going to do that.
"All the sheetz I’ve seen that have Tesla charging stations also have a sheetz air compressor. So, close?"
Just put one in your trunk with integrated slime can in the event you get a flat in the middle of nowhere!!!!
"Could be a good advertising opportunity for a third party or if not, good PR to lure other drivers to get a closer look at a Tesla. Somebody charging is likely to chit chat and hand out a referral code.

Edit: For some reason I am feeling a bit more positive about the state of humanity today, not sure why."
Just get a little compressor on Amazon that's saved my ass so many times
I like the idea of doing this at the stations in remote areas or along routes with long periods of isolation.
I just top up my tires with my bicycle pump. Takes one minute per PSI per tire on average.
"Why should they be free though?

It costs money to put those up. They should cost a small amount.

And only way to connect to use them should be you have to hook in your charge cable."
"Not that i own a Tesla but I do imagine having one, I feel like non Tesla drivers may use them too. But these spots should only be for Tesla consumers. What if you wanna charge and your waiting for a station when the person is taking a long time to pump tires? L"
"I feel like this will be solved over time as electric chargers begin to show up in ""gas stations"" over the next few years. Too many new EVs coming out for this to not become a norm."
Gas stations NEED to start having one set of EV fast chargers.
"A bit off topic, but I would be happy to see them offer trash cans at supercharger stops :-).  My passenger foot well thanks you in advance ;-)."
Seriously. For all Tesla brags about low drag coefficients having tires that are just a few PSI lower than optimal lowers your energy efficiency a great deal.
"In California gas stations have to provide them for free if you buy something:  
[http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-laz-tire-air-20140924-story.html](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-laz-tire-air-20140924-story.html)"
"They could enable the compressor with the key cards, like they do with the locks at the kettleman supercharger lounge..."
"Protip:  Just press the reset TPMS sensors to make the warning go away....

(Assuming your tires aren't actually low or something.)"
That would be nice.
"Will the Cybertruck have it’s own built in compressor that could be used for flats? If so, how about using it for pneumatic tools?"
"Slightly off-topic, but do you know why gas stations started charging money for air? ....Inflation."
"Elon seems to enjoy hearing about things like this. 

Make this a tweet and mention him and tesla in it?"
Get one off Amazon and keep it in the trunk. I use it a lot to keep the tires perfect.
ill just use an air hose from the built in air compressor.
"Don't some tire shops offer free air check and top-up fill?

Though I bought tire repair kit + compressor combo for an emergency, I never used them."
"I've seen it at one supercharger, I forget which though. One of the California ones along I5. It was nice - definitely a big convenience.

I keep a bike pump in my car because I can't be bothered to get a proper compressor, but I'd imagine they aren't expensive or big."
doesn't every service station have free air compressors? how often are you people pumping up your tyres anyway?
Self inflating tires would be great.
Just trade in for a CB you will have one on you at all times
I've had a portable compressor that runs off a DC outlet in the trunk of my cars (including my Tesla) for the past decade. It couldn't have been more than $20 and has been a life saver to get me to a shop when I've had slow leaks.
And WiFi
And squeegees to clean our windows (and roofs)
I just put my mouth on the valve and blow
"I don’t believe anyone who’s saying air is free, I’ve never been to a gas station that had an operable air compressor much less one for free. Them shits takes all your quarters and still give no air"
That’s what I use sheets and wawa for :)
Tire pressure check is once a month. Car windshield cleaning requirement is probably once a week.  I think we need cleaning fluid and wipers at superchargers.
Because the assholes at Wawa will take up the charger spaces to avoid sitting in a line for the air
"Railroad Pass (east of Las Vegas) Super Charger is next to a gas station.  Has free air for cars and big trucks.. it's an industrial size compressor. Don't think it breaks down, and puts out plenty of air.  I just put pictures on Google Maps last weekend."
"I'm not at all into Teslas, but I'm surprised this isn't already a thing. Even regular gas stations have air compressors, even though they aren't free in my experience."
"Although this sounds like a good idea, I think its bad idea because it will create lots of unwanted traffic from non Tesla vehicles."
I thought the tires were electric
https://www.bridgestonetire.com/tread-and-trend/tire-talk/airless-concept-tires maybe this is going to come sooner than later?
Just get a Cybertruck
Tesla will be installing cybertrucks at all superchargers.  Mission accomplished.
And windshield squeegees and fluid.
Or any cybertrucks that are charging can fill up the tires of other Teslas.
If you have a cybertruck can you use the onboard air compressor to fill your own tires?
"on the list of things tesla needs to do this is number 9724 on a list that goes to 100.

Your tires should be rotated every 5-10k miles, discount and costco do this for free and will check the pressure for you when they do it.  

gas stations and convience marts will already have more air compressors already setup and the only time you might need one is in an emergency and tesla superchargers are rarely in short range emergency locations.   That is a huge infrastructure cost and burden that is largely not needed for new well maintained cars like yours should be."
"This is Tesla, screw that idea. Give us wheels that self inflate our tires!

:D"
"Why not add a compressor to their vehicles??  Runs on electricity, has a manual switch, adds 2 pounds to the vehicle and adds reliability.  ???"
Good idea but I could see it being taken advantage of by ICE cars and taking up valuable real estate.
Around here the card lock fuel station used to provide free air. After their third hose end walked off they gave up.
I mean if GetGo can do it...
It’s be nice if they did but the shouldn’t have to it’s your obligation to keep your tires inflated
Where i live theres air compressors at every gas station... so why does Tesla has do waste their money on something redundant?
"Should? And free? Maybe a little entitled?

Seriously, air compressor is not free, and cost money to maintain. I don't see many gas station offer air compressor for free. It can easily added up to tens to millions if every supercharger station has one. I'd rather has Tesla to use that money for more chargers."
A lot of states require gas stations by law to provide free air to everyone. (Though cheap ass stations pretend you need to put quarters in). Makes sense that charging stations will need this as well.  I stop by the gas station to fill up my tires so I think it is only fair any car can get it at a charging station.
In 2021 you will be able to ask charging cybertrucks to help you out😂
Yeah obviously they would set that up so you don’t block the charger while you’re filling with air - and hopefully they can do free air like many gas stations
Didn’t your model 3 come with one?  I have one in my trunk.
I’d pay for it honestly
just go to a gas station. They are everywhere
Brain: Why wouldn’t you just go to the gas station and fill your tires...oh riiiiiight. 😂
I would actually be happy with just a trash can.  The amount of trash that people leave around (shame on you!) the SCs is astonishing.
"Keep in mind that means other cars will be parking at superchargers checking their tires as well... consuming charging spots.  

This is what my local gas station is for..."
I'm not an owner but I'd rather have Tesla spend more money on staws than air compressors to compensate with lines and ICEing that happens in some areas.
"This little guy is convenient... Very small and you dial in your pressure.

People [already think EV chargers are air compressors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ULSerMOgv4). But now you want to actually put air compressors at EV chargers. What sort of mayhem are you trying to inflict on society?
And squeegees for our windshields!!
They have air and windshield washing supplies at the Kettleman City SC
They sell a tire care kit that fits easily in the frunk. I keep it there for road trips.
I would think that would be a no- brainer
"I'm gonna use this opportunity to rep this thing called Xact Air, it's the best air compressor I've ever seen. You literally just put in your PSI and it puts the air to that exact PSI (removing or placing air) and then beeps. It's super fast, super efficient, and takes absolutely zero guesswork or trial-and-error. I can't really say enough about the thing, I wish it was at every gas station ever.

Check around you to see if one is nearby, it's kinda hard to find but really worth it. I've seen them at 2 76s."
Well I'm sure there will soon be plenty of cybertruck drivers around happy to help.
Just tweet him. He responds to requests that are viable.
"As many have said packing one with you is no too difficult scabs useful at locations other than super chargers. 

Some one else mentioned trash bin and window wash stations.  I can vouch that Rochester MN add Lacrosse WI have them. Starting a trend?"
"The Kettleman City station is the a dream. 40 stalls at 250 kW max, tire air station, lounge, 24-hr vending machines with coffee and sandwiches, juice/coffee bar during the day, and walking distance to a nice attraction (Bravo Farms). Just need a gym and car wash to be perfect. maybe I should start a chain of micro gyms with concierge service and place them at next to superchargers and people can use health benefits to pay for the membership and services!"
Hmm. I carry one in the car that has a digital gauge and it’s quite handy. Maybe I should ask fellow owners if they need to use it while they wait to charge.
This sounds a lot like one of the change.org emails I get. One of those ones I immediately delete after rolling my eyes. If it's good for business they will do it.
"Shouldn't they install compressors they paid for, and thus are quality, instead of just getting random trash they find?"
"Windshield cleaners would be my #1 pick; a road tripping necessity. I’ve had to stop at countless gas stations solely to clean my windshield. 

Sure, waterless wash & cleaning cloths are an option but when road tripping every bit of space matters & hauling around dirty towels used to clean my car isn’t super practical."
Tesla tire’s need air?
"Kettleman City (off the 5) has this. I used it a few weeks ago. It is hard to find, but if you go out the back parking lot, it is there."
"> Not sure how to officially ask Tesla for this type of thing. 

Literally just tweet Elon"
"I'd be happy to pay to use one, it would be a great amenity. For some reason two of my tires always seem to be either over or under inflated. 

Maybe Tesla could install some newfangled thing that uses mobile pay rather than quarters and runs for a long enough time to actually inflate all four of your tires!"
"My town has a gas station with an air compressor for $1 - 3 mins of use. I’m good with that. 

I cannot wait tho for the CT bc that bad boy is gonna be used to fill up all the damn pool floats without having to ask my husband to do it with our huge compressor in the basement 👏🏻"
Really they should do trash pick-up and bathrooms.  Or be close to a business that offers this.
I spent 20 minutes last week filling my tires with a bike pump
Yeah and please say on screen what the tires should be filled to!!! They just show red 🙄
But...but...that would mean I would never stop at a gas station?  I have met other EV owners just stopping there for air for tires
cYB3rAiR only. it's 30x stronger!
Dude if you can afford a Tesla you can afford a $25 portable tire air compressor
Why not just have an air compressor built in to the car?
"In CA, gas stations are required to give you free air/water if you get gas. Most new stations have free air stations to begin with. I know which stations are like that, so I just drive to those. Some of the older stations have been retrotfitted with a push button on the air pump stations to activate, while others you can just walk in and ask the cashier to start the air remotely.

Fun story, I did find a place where you had to ask the cashier to turn on the pump. It's never been an issue in my ICE, except this time in my Model 3 the cashier told me I should pay. I said, isn't it free? He asked if I got gas, and I said ""yep"" and the cashier asked which stall. I didn't want to say anything about my Tesla so I dug a deeper hole and named a random pump.  He then pulled it up on his screen and asked me how much it was. I shrugged and said it was a tank of gas, and threw out an approximate number that my GTI would typically fill up with. He didn't really believe me, and said fine, and turned on the air. As I walked out, he followed me out, not to walk with me to my car but to do pump maintenance duties or whatever, but I figured he wanted to see me walk to my car. I faked a phone call and stood there for 3 minutes while he went to maintain the pumps. Paying $1.50 or whatever it was wasn't a big deal, but man I just wanted to disappear at that moment.

It felt like forever, but he was out there still, so I circled around the parking lot while ""on the phone."" I felt he was kinda watching me the whole time, and when he finally turned around, I jumped into my car, drove the hell out of there and to another gas station."
I think the problem with doing this is then the ICE vehicles will be taking spots of Tesla owners to be charging in unless they somehow had it tied into your Tesla key or phone app.
A little portable air compressor that plugs into the 12V socket is cheap. I have one in the frunk.
or just go to a gas station and use their air pump
Mhhh thought of it to but you get a lot of unwanted visitors also.
Yeah maybe they should add dick sucking machines while they’re at it.
To ask Tesla apparently you just tweet it @ Elon.
Just use the Cybertruck that's gonna be there.  It has an air compressor :)
Oh a compessor broke? Ok let me get to that bext tuesday. Of the next decade.
" 

# Request: Tesla should install free air compressors at Supercharger sites for filling/checking tires

Done: free air compressors will be installed next to the superchargers in late 2022. they will be called Cybertrucks. 

Ps: I am getting a CyberTruck so you can use my free air compressor to fill/check your tires. If you ask nicely :)"
Cybertruck will at least have a compressor pre-installed
As an investor......... no.
"so i looked into getting a station at my local garage and was surprised that there is really no incentive for businesses to install them. you dont earn any kickbacks and still have to pay for the electricity, so you really lose money on the deal. the only perk i guess is a captive customer while they charge so places likes outlet malls makes some sense but just a local mechanic who wants to evolve their business gains nothing"
"You don't need a air compressor to check your tires, just like you don't need a standby liver to check your liver enzymes."
They've solved it. Every supercharger place will have a visiting/charging Cybertruck with aircompressor in a couple of years.
Then non Tesla owners will be hogging the air and taking up lanes so NO!
"People wouldn't take care of them, roll over them, keep them all knotted up, people would cut steal the fitting. It's a great idea but people would appreciate it."
Why would they do that when the gas station charges 1$ for air? Seeing how Tesla's are higher end cars they will probably charge more. And with all that fuel savings I'm sure you guys can all afford it!
I carry this Ryobi battery powered one - does both tires and camp mattresses.  Most useful tool I own.   [https://www.ryobitools.com/products/details/18v-one-plus-dual-function-inflator-deflator](https://www.ryobitools.com/products/details/18v-one-plus-dual-function-inflator-deflator)
I don’t have a Tesla but I suspect people without Tesla’s would try and get free air too so I would think a good way to prevent that is to make it so that when the charger is connected it turns the air pump on so you are able to fill your tires where as someone without a Tesla cannot inflate their tires if they aren’t plugged in.
I'd love to fill my tires for free in my gas car at a Tesla charging station
"FYI (I'm in SoCal) - a lot of Chevron gas stations have free air, no gas purchase necessary. Look for one around and top off when needed! I've done this twice now in random Chevrons while traveling."
They also need better spacing out o accommodate trailers if they want the Cybertruck to succeed.
"Or buy a $40 cigarette lighter pump and have one for emergencies.

The Cyber truck has one built in."
"Honestly you'll just have a bunch of people with ICE vehicles clogging up the space to fill their tires.

If you didn't know, discount tire will set your air pressures to whatever you want for free.  It's a drive through service, you don't even need to get out of your car."
"Tweet this at Elon, he'll say they've been working on it and they will all be installed soon no matter if it's true or not. Just like when anyone tweets any kind of idea at him."
If you can afford a Tesla then go to amazon and buy a small portable compressor that can fill your tires.  Tesla doesn’t owe you an air compressor.
No.  Stop all the “Tesla Shoulds”.
Yea they’d be stolen pretty quick. Ppl are shitty
"On a related note, why can't an automaker come up with self filling tires/wheels? Or a built in compressor?"
Just have a cybertruck there all the time haha
How many free things do people want? Tesla is a for profit company and we should pay for the convenience.
Or just ask a Cybertruck for a quick fill.
I go to truck cardlock diesel stations. They have free air that comes out at 150psi. Fills up your puny tires in seconds.
If they have a problem with people loitering at those locations now I could only imagine if they put air compressors there. Maybe it only allows operation while actively charging?
also free money plz
Hey that's what wawa is for
"I'd say it was a good idea, but it would get abused by non-Tesla owners and then the maintenance of always having broken compressors.

I keep a 120v/12v air compressor in the trunk of all of the vehicles I have had and never have to deal with a public air compressor again.  If anything, I could just check and use that at a supercharger."
Honestly they could install air compressors along side superchargers fairly easily. And then they could identify the vehicle and fill to the proper PSI automatically.
"It’s my understanding the tesla charging stations are largely unmanned. At the rate those air compressor hoses fail, tesla would need to add a good bit of manpower to oversee them all. Tesla should sell a compressor that fits in the car."
In California it's the law that service stations need to provide free air and water to customers who buy fuel. Consider lobbying your local representative to have the laws expanded to EV charging stations!
I’d take more stations where they are needed over air pumps.
They should stick to building out more supercharger locations and worry about this low hanging fruit later.
I carry one in my car. Since most places in Seattle charge you. I’ve offered free fill up for people I’ve seen with flats on the highway or at the super charger I regularly go. As long as I’m not in a rush that is.
"Also, bathrooms, or don't put the sign on the SC status screen if there isn't a 24/7 bathroom."
Luckily when the cybertrucks are charging you'll be able to bum some psi
Much rather have a trash can to be honest.
"What is wrong with the idea of a charging station taking ideas from gas stations? I guess maybe it’s not as high-end, but even if Tesla doesn’t do it, I could see the EV station of the future having tire pumps, car washes, a convenience store, etc."
No need.  We'll just park our Cybertrucks at superchargers and pump you up as you wait.  For tips
When taking ours on road trips we always carry a cheap air compressor and squeegie + window cleaner.
Good idea
Just park a Cybertruck at every station so we can have another way to charge and now also fill up tires..
"It’d be nice but you can just go to Costco and they’ll do it for you for free, no membership required"
This would get exploited by ICE cars worsening the ICEing of Tesla superchargers problems
"Already exists at Kettleman City, CA. Also has window cleaners. But it's the exemplar SC with a private room, vending machines, and, during the day, baristas."
"I’m too lazy to see if this was mentioned:

That’s a good way to have non-Tesla cars in your way.

Maybe if it was somehow attached to actually charging your car?"
"You're already asking for too much, gas stations charge money for air"
I would rather see Tesla put money into building additional charging stations than enhancing the ones they've already got with items readily available elsewhere.
[deleted]
Nah. Buy yourself a compact air pump to always keep in the trunk.
I think it is a great idea. I haven’t heard this suggestion before. Good thought!
Agreed
They do at kettleman.
In a couple of years you can just ask the guy in the Cybertruck if you can borrow his compressor 😁
"Suggestion: we should get free stuff.

Tesla should hire you!"
Can they also sell over priced sandwichs and old chocolate bars and energy drinks? That's the future of tesla
"Why build the infrastructure when it already exists? Every petrol station has that facility, and theyre on every corner."
Does not even need to be free. I'm ready to pay $1.00 like at the gas station.
Tweet Elon!
Why? Tesla sells a tire repair kit which can also fill tires using its own power.
"""A company that is losing money should spend money on something that does not bring in any money."""
It's gonna be cool when the CT arrives. Not only could you fill your own tires but those of your friends too!
"Yep, I got a cheap-ass one at Target ten years ago and it’s still going strong. Tire air is by far the most common maintenance item, at least on my vehicles. I don’t understand why everybody doesn’t have one."
"Same. Although I still use the gas station compressors if I find a good one, because I don't want my little blue thing to die early."
" [https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-s\_x\_3-tire-repair-kit](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-s_x_3-tire-repair-kit) 

$80 because tesla, and also can of fix a flat built in"
"Right this to me is a better option, you can use it anywhere and you can help out others too."
"I just got one, too, now that spare tires are ""obsolete"".

That said, in the US you can get ""free air"" in a lot of places: [https://www.freeairpump.com/map/](https://www.freeairpump.com/map/)"
"Same, I got one from Costco and it has dual DC/AC plugs. Works great! 

This one: https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F163953383367"
Craftsman sells a good portable one.
I got an Air Hawk Pro. It’s legit. I have like 3 of them and they’re great.
"i recommend everyone buy one of these, has come in handy for me so many times. not a bad idea to grab someone you know one for this xmas either, i got mine as a gift and i’m so glad i have it"
"> $25 air compressor

Mine just arrived yesterday!"
what do you use? wanna check it out
Depending on how regularly you're using it you might want to check for a bent rim causing your tire to lose pressure faster than it should
How do you power it with the Tesla?
A bike pump can easily be used to top off pressure on the tires. Maybe a minute of pumping per psi?
Or hit up the nice cyber truck driver.
I keep a $10 bike pump in my frunk. 15 pumps seems to bring the pressure from 39 to 41 psi
"I have air suspension on my Subaru and have an air chuck connected to the tank. If the cyber truck will have the on board air compressor and tank with the air suspension accessible for use, I don't see why they couldn't do the same for the S and X with air ride."
Mind linking which one you have?
Links?
"Best purchase I've made for just in case tools, saved me a few times already."
That's a great idea! This is also a way of not shifting more overhead to the Tesla corporation for them to later pass on to consumers.
"Is frunk a word for the front trunk? 
If it's not, it should be."
">frunk

Trunk in the front like Dumbo?"
"The good old ""if you build it, they will come"" philosophy... I like it!"
Partner with rest stops. I've always wondered why gas stations never did that.
Is there a fancy Japanese vending machine that I can use as a bathroom?
Fucking right. They sell hot coffee in a can at those machines! What a world!
">at freeway exits

...

>cheap land

Pretty sure these things are mutually exclusive unless you're way out in the middle of nowhere."
"> Put in high tech Japanese vending machines for quick snacks

Agreed!  And since we've already got Netflix and Hulu, we can just camp out while recharging.  I'm down!"
Omg those vending machines are great except I never knew if the coffee I picked was going to be hot or cold.
"I just got back from a vacation in Japan. Those machines are brilliant, and I do not understand why they have not yet taken over the developed world."
Necessary power may not be easy to find at remote locations.  At least not for cheap.
"Say, what do the costs look like if I wanna set up a vending machine as you say?"
I demand one of those full on pizza vending machines that do toppings and everything all in like 5 minutes.
I assume you mean businesses like hotels or fast food. Because with V3 super charging taking so little time I can't imagine much else. But maybe there are business I'm not thinking of
"They're installing a [self service grocery kiosk](https://imgur.com/a/6yRWd2o) of sorts at our newest Supercharger in Switzerland. I've never seen anything like it here, so I'm excited to find out what it actually does. But man is that convenient if I can do some grocery shopping while charging!

Edit: Also, there's a little self service café, which you can only access using a code in the Tesla navigation system. It's got vending machines, couches, tables with power and usb for work and a TV with a NES Mini. I'm getting really good at Dr Mario"
"I like the way you think, but I fear that land at freeway exits with nothing else there won't have the electrical infrastructure necessary to support charging EVs......

But there would definitely be small businesses who would love to rent near such locations."
Is there an official tesla site where you can suggest Supercharging locations? There's a place that just went out of business and the land is available at a major interchange near where I live. The other closest Superchargers are more than an hour in each direction.
[deleted]
Also it will draw ICE cars to the SCs for free air.
Squeegees require a human to go an refill the liquid tho.
Obviously you haven’t had the “cold weather drops tire pressure by 1 PSI and your Model 3 goes freaking nuts and puts FOUR warning symbols on your screen until you drive it two more times after airing up the tires” thing happen to you.
You can still go to a gas station
I'd just be stoked for trash cans.
"Or,

1.  Move to Baltimore County. 
2.  Drive down I-83 South to the City.
3.  Stop at the light. 
4.  Profit."
I still pull into gas stations with my SR+ just to clean my windshield.
I just stop at a gas station. :)
"Have you guys been at ones with squeegees yet? The one in Wheatland, Wyoming has one if I remember correctly."
I keep micro fiber cloths and Spray Away glass cleaner in the trunk.  Works very well!
"You've never smelled one of those containers 
 during love bug season in Florida, have you?"
I miss the beaver nuts
"Along with a cheap air compressor, my trunk contains a spray bottle of premixed ONR and some microfiber towels. The only time I’ve missed a gas station is for snacks."
There's a SC in Florida that has squeegees out by the chargers and I LOVE them for it. The gas station is called bee's or something like that.
Kettleman City is a special case though.
Which model did you buy?
Just 2 long years from now
Just 2 short years from now
Yep. Maintenance was also my first thought.
"Or there’s one compressor away from the chargers, like at gas stations."
Just make it a pin that is shown on the in car nav.
"I'd be fine with ICE vehicles using them if they want, no harm. Air compressors don't normally take up a parking space, it's normally on its own so a charging space won't get ICEd. So it's no harm to charging if any car uses it for a few mins. 

Topping up your tires isn't something people will rush to because it's free, they'd only use it when they need to so you're not going to have a line of ICE vehicles waiting to use it. It'll be rare to see especially since most people use the public one at the gas station anyway because they only cost like 25 cents. 

Superchargers had to be made exclusive for now because there wasn't good alternatives yet, but let's not make something as simple as air compressors that have been around forever and are found everywhere exclusive to Teslas. That's far even for Apple, might aswell ban Teslas from using non tesla air compressors at at that point."
"Can we also make it coin operated, but free if you go inside and ask someone to turn them on, but have them only on long enough to fill 3 tires?"
"> Active ONLY when a car is charging otherwise expect more ICING

yeah plugging in the car completes the circuit to the compressor."
Lol
Some states require that by law if there’s no spare tire. Any chance you’re in Maryland? Not all Tesla’s come with that kit.
"I wish mine came with that stuff, just to offset the spare-tire-lacking-anxiety."
"Yeah, I'm in Maryland, and mine came with one. I was wondering why everyone wasn't just saying to use that."
You guys pay to fill the tires on the US?
[deleted]
"Because gas stations are typically required to provide them free of charge to everyone.  If you want electric to take over, they should assume the same responsibility."
"Yeah Baltimore city actually just made it illegal (last year iirc) for any city gas station to charge for air, while here in Maryland at large most gas stations do not charge for air, you’ll still find plenty of stations that will charge you."
"In California, gas stations are required by law to offer free air for tires."
This is why I love Sheetz. You can get all of those things and supercharge.
"YES to wifi! And Tesla is planning on implementing it. 

Imagine how much better life would be. Instead of people worried that they can't get their wifi to reach their car, they can just go supercharge occasionally to get updates. Or stream videos."
Seriously! This what I've always done. Sure it's not quite as quick and effortless but the convenience factor is huge. Good protip too - I figured ~10 pumps/psi for my pump and tire combo is a good rule of thumb.
Kettleman City is a special case.
Doesn’t kettleman also have staff?
I used to do this in my more frugal days. it was a grand workout to pump up all four. Can't remember exactly but I think it was on the order of twenty or so strokes per PSI for a normal passenger tire with my road bike pump.
"Get a floor-stand pump, that fills a tire up pretty quick. The portable mini bike pumps take forever."
Really wish they had had the foresight to make that promotion “Free unlimited supercharging when you’re 100+ miles from your home address”.  Basically free road trip supercharging.
Imagine being against something so useful
Slime should be banned.  Spare tires should be mandatory.
"That’s already happening! Lots of Sheetz gas stations have superchargers now. Best of both worlds. Superchargers, food, bathrooms, squeegees, air pumps"
Free at enroutes in Ontario
"I literally just filled up my air for free in California bay area at a Chevron gas station.  I had to go to a Supercharger, and while on my way the tire indicator light came on.  So after charging, I had to go track down a gas station that had working air.  That is why I created the post in the first place."
"Everyone's playing with that, Michelin, Continental, Bridgestone, Pirelli, etc.  It's been years and still no talk beyond ""we have this really great technology, it's the tire of the future"" for more than 15 years.  Nobody's said a thing about actually using them in a production situation."
I vaguely recall hearing something that at least strongly implied that during the announcement telecast.
You’ll need to carry a hose though.
Build the compressor into the wheel!
Only certain states come with the air compressor. The rest of us have to purchase them.
must it be said....CYBERTRUCK :) does
Mom is looking for a job.
Would need your key card or fob to work machine.
"They can. Central Tire Inflation Systems (CTIS) have been around since the 1980s. They aren’t very practical from a cost/reliability/necessity standpoint. A cheap air compressor that runs off the cigarette lighter works fine for most people, and would be preferable to adding a complex air system that requires special wheels."
"Wawa has free stations and I've rarely ever seen one down. 

Theirs are actually really nice, you put in your desired psi and it measures and auto stops for you too."
Really?  I see coin operated air stations around CA quite a bit.
This. Eventually adding those would be great but for now I just want them to focus on expanding and installing more v3 charging stations. I don't mind having to drive over to a gas station for little things like that because how often are you actually refilling your tires?
"why is this the case, aside from not optimally adjusting from cold tire pressure?"
"isnt kettleman almost a ""historic"" supercharger site? Only a matter of time until theres service centre there too."
Once word gets out that could become problematic.  Every stop at a SuperCharger is going to take just a little longer.
Those of us with work trucks have enjoyed this for decades. My trucks always have on-board air!
They should do the tire filler from the dash like those Hummers
Because WaWa air is free baby!
"I’m in Florida, maybe the temp doesn’t fluctuate as much? I have never needed to air up the tires on the go. I have one in the garage."
"I don't understand why it isn't built into the car if it's only $25, and automatically reinflates the tyres like James Bond's car."
"Don't Teslas come with this? Mine did at least... maybe they stopped that?

Edit: Just saw another comment - I'm in Maryland. Apparently it is required to be included due to no spare."
">Same, I got one from Costco and it has dual DC/AC plugs. Works great!

I have the same one and that thing is a beast. 120v or 12v power. Punch in the psi you want, no need to do the usual guessing game with your psi. Really fast. Has little storage area so where you can store little accessories like the ball adapter thing."
It's just some Slime brand air compressor that I picked up at AutoZone several years ago.  No big deal.
Just plug in to the cigarette socket.
That's why I bought the air compressor. Bike pumps are designed for high pressure and low volume. It takes forever to add a few pounds to a car tire.

"Yes, the Tesla community has been calling it a frunk since the beginning.

Several years ago, I pulled up next to a wonderfully restored 70's Porsche 911. Being a big Porsche fan (my t-shirt vernacular is basically Tesla and air-cooled Porsche/VW), I rolled down my window and called out, ""hey, that car looks great. Good job!"". He replied back, ""thanks, and I really like those Teslas""... Awkward silence.. ""hey, you know, my car has a frunk too!"""

"There are a bunch of superchargers here in the northeast on I-95 and NJ turnpike rest stops. No need to take the exit! Very convenient, no need to go through toll booths, plus free publicity at high traffic areas."

"Pretty much anything is better than a Walmart parking lot.

Since when do they not?
"I've seen gas stations in rest stops, along with restaurants, Star-Bucks, and even a gift shop with merch themed to match the state and local sports teems. West Virginia has 3 or 4 such rest areas."
Not specifically a rest stop but it's cool that [this wawa](https://i.imgur.com/hVWRLvI.jpg) has partnered with Tesla.
"I've stopped at two rest stops with Superchargers. Both were pretty convenient with the typical rest-stop sort of stuff. It's extremely nice to just be able to pull right off the highway and get right back on. 

The worst Superchargers have nothing around them. In those cases it would be a good idea for Tesla (or someone else) to install some limited vending machines. I bet they'd do pretty well."
Every vending machine is a bathroom if you try hard enough
"There are portable restrooms...but my critique of Tesla as a road trip machine is the fact that there were lines, and all charging saddled me with shitty food options. I’d rather have many more charging options along a route that could bridge me to a better rest stop. The worst was having to back track because the stop I made the entire exit was out of electricity"

Not if they just put a water tap there you do it yourself.
It’s be pretty easy to automate that.
"Lol it's happened, I just made the car relearn the new pressures because I'm lazy."
Not only that but the warning stayed on for one more day for me after I filled up the tires. Lol.
"Costco in Vegas has Nitrogen, for a few, I think it's $10/tire. And free if you need to come back to add a little more.

Not sure where else to get nitrogen. Depending on location might need to call various tire shops.

Tesla show rooms or service centers should have N2

Also the FBO at an airport might have some, but might be over priced.  Signature and Atlantic are the major ones at the airports."
This happened to me a month ago. I was so annoyed with having to search reddit or Tesla blogs about quirky shit my car was doing that I just filed it under it’s freaking out bc it’s cold and there I put air in and I know it’s fine and if it doesn’t stop in a few weeks I’ll have service look at it. It stopped a few days after putting more air in lol fun times - this car keeps me on my toes haha
You can override that in park...
Which also applies to air in the tires.
Or a tree I can shit and piss next to.
Preach!
Newspapers clean pretty well
"A 1/3 of SC i visit in my yearly road trips are in a gas station parking lot, so it's very convenient. I Just pull up to station when I am done charging and clean windshield."
"I keep a running count of the number of times I've tried to charge, but the spot was ICEd. I try to reciprocate by blocking a gas pump while I clean my windshield, hit the john, and buy some snacks. This is necessary to maintain the global balance of karma."

I assumed this is something you would want in reach / part of the charger so you could top up the tires while charging.
"Ah, didn't know that, it's really nice, Tesla did not skimp on it, all Tesla's should have it imo."
I'd be ok with no spare with a little air pump and tire plugs stock. 99% of the time its a little nail or screw. I think the average person would find tire plugs are easier than changing a tire these days.
Some states have a law that all gas stations have to have air. some states have a law that all gas stations have to have free air.
You guys pay to use the restroom in Europe?
">pay to fill the tires

If you use a service station and buy gas, using the air is free. Otherwise, you have to pay to use it. As a kid, I had to bring quarters to run the air to pump up my bike tires."
"I'm actually from Canada, here in my city every gas station air pump costs money"
"no.  Most gas stations around here have the tire air compressors available for free, but I don't feel good about pulling up and using them. I did it once and got the stink eye from the manager, which I guess makes sense...I'm not buying gas."
"> You guys pay to fill the tires on the US?

Some states (California at least) require gas stations to offer free air.  Others locations may charge $1-1.50 to get air.  Pays for maintenance of compressor and electricity (+ some profit)"
$1.75 in my area
I don't even know how someone **could** abuse the service.
In California if you buy gas or something inside it’s free(by law).  I’ve been able to get it for free just walking inside and asking them to turn it on. Most service station attendants don’t care. If they’re dicks about it I pay $1 to fill up air. 90% of the time it’s free though.
"NYC here and I’ve never seen free air at any gas station. Would usually be 50¢ for like 3 minutes of air, so I would remove all the valve caps first, insert one quarter, do some stretches for the upcoming mini marathon, insert the last quarter, then dash through them with the hose in hand. In my futile attempts to save another 50¢, I would often end up losing a valve cap or two."
I had to drive to a gas station and pay to fill my model 3's tires. As an added bonus I got my credit card cloned.
You can go to any mechanic and get free air so it's not like it's impossible.
">You guys pay to fill the tires on the US?

It's called the stupid tax. Some people pay it."
common in the UK too at some stations
"Around this time of year, every gas station gets a huge line of cars to use the air pump, sometimes you will be sitting for 15 minutes just waiting to fill your tires. I think that would end up being a major issue as it would clog up the superchargers with ICE vehicles"
"The free part depends on jurisdiction, where I'm from you have to pay. But if thats the local law then yes I see the point."
"With a fuel purchase. While most will still provide free air for anyone that asks, they are not required to unless you purchase gas."
Except you have to pay for the hot dogs
Now that’s a helpful idea.
"More stuff that will break, makes Tesla look like they don’t care.

With approaching 2,000 unstaffed locations, maintenance would be a problem.

I’m all for this at staffed locations."
I don’t disagree.  I really wish Tesla had supplied a spare.  Your only other options are to keep a spare and jack in the trunk area and take up a good amount of storage or switch to run flat tires (like BMW).  Having a pump with Slime is better than being stranded.  Now if you have a sidewall puncture you’re SOL either way!
"Slime sucks, but I don't know that spares should be required.

Tires are way better than they were decades ago, and are better monitored. Flats are far fewer today.

It used to be a given that people would have multiple flats in the life of a car, now it's not uncommon for a car to never need its spare in 15+ years of use.

If we got rid of spares the US passenger fleet would weigh 6.8 billion lbs less, that adds up to a lot less energy use."
"They aren’t free in Texas, New Mexico, Nor Arizona to my knowledge. Nor in Utah. 
Those are all states I’ve been in that I needed
To find change for air only for every compressor to be broken...."
"I believe the biggest supperchsrger sites have them. If you travel to the supercharger in kettleman city, it has an air compressor and the window cleaning brush."
I agree lol the only thing you can get them on atm is your zero turn riding mower
"Yes, they are great when they’re working. The hoses almost always have tears in them. At any rate, they fail more often than super chargers and would require extra overhead. I may make sense to have air pumps where there are tesla employees nearby but most super carvers don’t have employees close by to monitor the pumps."
Really. If you buy fuel and ask for free air they'll either put the coins in for you or override it. If you're ignorant enough to pay they won't stop you. But it's the law since 1999.
It's not a good idea because you'll likely not put the correct pressure in them. The heat/pressure build up that happens from driving can vary considerably and there's no effective way for a consumer to really know how to account for that.
Oh free air? Let me just ICE this for a minute while I do my tires
It should get powered on just while the car is charging. Solved
That'll be a hard no from me.
Charging that huge 250kWh battery will take forever even on 150kW Supercharger (which normally max out closer to 140kW). That's almost two hours at full speed with no taper.
Hopefully people fill up their air while charging.
"free with the tesla app. $2 for anyone else.

there is an online map of places with free air. somebody could make an app showing the nearest one to each charge spot, or integrate it with the trip planning app.

tesla could provide free nitrogen instead of air. it's supposed to be better for the tires somehow, and should be easy enough to do via science.

And it’s an excuse to get a WaWa sub!
"Yeah as a former Floridian now in the northeast, temp changes mean you have to check and correct it a few times a year. Was never a thing in always hot as fuck palm beach."
I think built in systems are quite a bit more expensive. Making permanent connections to rotating wheels is harder than just having a valve stem connector.
"Wait, what? I’m in Maryland and got my car in June. No compressor/flat kit; I had to buy it separately."
I'm also in Maryland and my car came with one
"A min $40,000 car doesn’t come with a spare?"
"I got the same one too, except that it is branded as Lowe's Kobalt. It works so much better than the cheapo Craftsman's inflators.

Lowe's discontinued the one I currently have, but it sure is designed similar: https://www.lowes.com/pd/Kobalt-12-Volt-Car-Air-Inflator/3522750"
It builds character.
"Thanks. But god damn look at that URL slug, jesus..."
"Wat? Is that a California thing?

Lots of rest areas in the rest of America have commercial gas stations, food courts, vending machines, Superchargers, etc.."
But what about coke/vending machines?
Florida has rest stops with retail and Super Chargers on the turnpike.
"Weird, all ours here in New York have gas stations and a host of other overpriced businesses.  What rule do you think would prohibit chargers?"
Correct! I've seen a few rest stops on the Turnpike in North Jersey with superchargers. Also there's another Wawa getting superchargers in Marlton!
Seriously; Walmart is actively making their parking lots dystopian with flashing lights and cameras everywhere. I feel the opposite of safe when I'm in one.
On the turnpike? I feel like that might be different

Did someone say beer?
The liquid in those isn't water.
Now that they've already run the conduit and wires and patched the parking lot...

"Still on my stock tires, but definitely getting the replacements at Costco because waiting at Costco for a rotation is way better than waiting at a tire store."
"NO2? Do you mean N2, I assume Nitrogen mean just nitrogen gas and not nitrous oxide (especially since NO2 is an oxidizer)"
"Unless you are taking it on the track, you do not need nitrogen filled tires."
Please explain.
"There's a few in NorCal, but there's cameras."
"Kettleman is staffed, right?"
Cool; thank you!
Late 2021 for single-motor and dual-motor. Late 2022 for tri-motor.
"Some states have a law that all gas stations have to have free air *available*, but they can still charge unless you come in to ask for it to be turned on."
"No, I just relieve myself behind the transformer stalls."
[deleted]
"I wonder if this is a regional thing. I've stopped at a few gas stations and service centers in Massachusetts, and the air pumps have always been free. 50/50 chance of them being broken, but still, free. 

Unless it's just an unwritten expectation that you pay for gas before using them, in which case, oops."
The gas station nearest to where I live here in Vermont has free air off to the side.
"I always just go to the store and ask them to turn it on, no matter if I am there with an ICE car or EV. They never said no yet."
"Hahaha
Sorry, paying for air sounds absurd to me kkkkk (FYI its a joke, I know its because of the machine) 

In Brasil is 100% free and you don't even have to buy gasoline"
"Depends on where you are. In California by law gas stations have to provide free air and water to anyone. Most of the ones I've seen have a machine that takes quarters and a code to the side. You just have to go inside and ask for the code and they will give you the code.

That's pretty much the only time I go to a gas station, I don't even buy anything, I just pop my head in and ask for the code and then put air in my tires."
"> If you use a service station and buy gas, using the air is free. Otherwise, you have to pay to use it.

Don't be so quick to generalize your experiences into absolute statements. It depends on the gas station."
"Technically, California requires gas stations to offer free air to customers purchasing fuel. Some stations just make them free for everyone, while others still have a bill acceptor. I usually buy a soda, and ask the cashier to turn the air on. Never had anyone deny my request."
"Uh, what? I've never in my life seen a line for the air pump, despite growing up in a place that actually gets cold. 

Plus even if that were the case, more air pumps being available would decrease lines, not increase them."

"Damn it.  My ignorance has cost me several dollars over the last couple of years.

Of course, I'm hardly going to be buying fuel now that I have a Tesla :/. Guess I missed my window."
"In the Midwest, most gas stations have places to inflate tires for free. I’d propose to make it free for everyone and address any problems it causes later. Because, if someone stops and really needs to air up a tire, being locked out because they don’t have a Tesla wouldn’t be cool."
I mean they could easily create some type of authentication system so only owners can use it.
Only works when charging... would be a good solution.
It would make no sense to do in an existing stall as only 1 person could use it...would need to be next to existing stalls so not really an ICE issue...
[Like this?](https://drivetribe.com/p/vw-driver-tries-to-inflate-tyres-eNjgyiIMRluHWMu_ZqnByA)
Authenticate with your key  or pin code via the touch screen like the gated super chargers.
"There are plenty of gas stations with free air, and plenty who charge too. Tesla could do either option, although I doubt it's worth charging for it."
"almost entirely a cali problem. Also since unlike cali MI doesn't have a mandatory free air law most the compressors around here seem to take credit card now. The speed which 3 dollars goes to air is way faster then 3 dollars of electric for me, and infinitely faster then 3 dollars worth of free supercharging for S and X.  As long as the ICE car promptly fucks off after filling he will be less of a time impact than anyone doing say bumping from 80 to 90/100 SoC cause they want to finish shopping"
Require a swipe of your Tesla key card or activation via the mobile app.
Easy. Set up the controls to only work if the station is actively charging.
Uhhh where do you live that doesn't have air pumps at the gas stations already?
🙄 like you couldn't use a gas station for your electric car.  Relax.
"Not solved.  If 1,500 cars are visiting a Super Charing location today and you add another reason for people to visit, 1,600 people may visit tomorrow.   While they don’t really need much of a charge, their low air pressure warning just came on so why not stop in for air and a charge.

When the temperature drops, our local tire shops have lines of cars waiting to get air.  I’d certainly visit the SuperCharger if I knew I could get free or even reasonably priced air."
"Hopefully Tesla is smart enough to put the air compressor away from the chargers, much like every gas station has them away from the pumps."
"I don’t think it’ll matter.  I think people stop and fill up gas cars with 3/4 tanks because it gives them a reason to get a big gulp and a scratch off.

Tesla doesn’t need to give people more reasons to stop and charge."
"Unless you make it $10 for anyone (Tesla owner or not) it won’t solve the maintenance problem or the increased usage of SuperChargers issue.

Best to keep SuperChargers charge and get out of there.  I think people are forgetting that some locations are crowded today and Tesla is going to add another 400k+ cars to the planet next year, and more after that."
As if I need an excuse!
"Palm Beach reporting here, had to air up my tires about 3 weeks ago due to the dropping temps. It's actually a bit chilly here now (11pm), 51F."
"It's probably an innovation that is more likely to be seen one day on a Ford vehicle first, now that I think about it. Ford spend a lot on R&D."

Correct
You’re thinking of gas stations / truck stops / oasis’s not actual rest stops.
"North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio checking in. I’ve never seen that before. All rest areas are gas pump and food court free. Vending machines, sure. They all have bathrooms, vending machines, and flyers with activities in the region... but no gas or restaurants."
They are allowed but the money has to go to supporting the rest area.
You’ll note that the Florida Turnpike is not numbered as an Interstate Highway.
"At least one of them is on interstate 64. I don't remember for sure where the others are.

Edit: just looked at a map. Interstate 64 is also West Virginia Turnpike, so you're right."
The liquid in those isn't **just** water.
"Still, I don't think that it would be too unreasonable to provide a tap and a dispenser and expect a user to help out every so often in exchange for being able to wash their windows for free."
**Patched** is accurate. Would prefer a repair though.
Yup was tired
"Doesn't expand contract in heat/cold. In certain places temperature swing from night to day can be more. One less time you have to stop and fill/release air.

Slightly better (barely noticeable) life from oxidizing.

Doesn't do any harm."
"There's a button in the service(?) menu that resets the TPMS sensors to read the current pressure as normal... makes the message go away.

Only do that if your tires aren't actually low (like below 35 or something)"
There's maybe 3 employees on busy holiday weekends to manage the line order but other than the barista there have not been visible staff on most other occasions. But yes I do expect one of them has the awful job of emptying the bug juice reservoir and filling it up with fresh liquid.... Blech
Barista sometimes
"AFAIK, the law is that gas stations have to provide free air to paying customers, but they can charge non-customers. So most gas stations have a coin-operated air pump, but if you ask them to turn it on (and they assume you are a customer), then you get free air. Of course, there's also some gas stations that just give free air regardless (no coin operated)."
"Yes you do, I lived in Germany for 2 years and traveled around Europe the whole time."
there are ones where its always on and its free. there are ones where its coin operated.
I grew up in Texas and it was free. First time filling up in Philly I asked them to turn the air on and they were like it's a dollar. I was like I paid for gas and she just looked at me.
"Here in Florida it depends. 10 feet can separate a gas station that charges $1.00 and a Wawa where not only is it free, but it's a fancy one where you set the PSI on the machine so it doesn't overfill."
And I'm sure we can rely on companies giving free services to non-customers indefinitely.
"Australia here, free for us too. 

I'm actually landing in Brazil tomorrow, do you have any recommendations for me. We will be in Foz do Iguacu first, then Rio. After that we haven't made plans but are thinking about Paraty. Any suggestions where we should go after Rio?"
"In several US states it's the law that it has to be free.

In every other one basically every major gas station chain provides free air if they have a working system.

It's pretty hard to find one that actually charges anymore, I've never actually known anyone here that paid for air."
"It's pretty common to see free air compressors at most gas stations, you can just drive up and use them.

At the few I've seen that make you pay, it's only a bit of pocket change."
"California law requires gas stations to provide free air and water to customers that purchase fuel, not free to anyone. That’s why many air pumps at California gas stations accept payment. 

That being said, I’ve never once paid for air. Just ask inside and they’ll usually turn on the machine for you."
"> Don't be so quick to generalize your experiences into absolute statements. It depends on the gas station.

Yes, the station might be nice but this is the ACTUAL LAW.

Section 13651 of the California Business and Professions Code further indicates “Every service station in this state shall display, at a conspicuous place on, at, or near the dispensing apparatus, at least one clearly  visible sign which shall read as follows:  CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES THIS  STATION TO PROVIDE FREE AIR AND WATER FOR AUTOMOTIVE PURPOSES TO ITS CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE MOTOR VEHICLE FUEL."
">  California requires gas stations to offer free air to customers purchasing fuel.  Some stations just make them free for everyone, while others still have a bill acceptor. I usually buy a soda, and ask the cashier to turn the air on. Never had anyone deny my request.

I've never seen one require cash (or that they turn it on for you,) I have seen it where you have to ask for a token though now that I think about it."
Sorry sir....
"Right, it should be in a place that doesn't affect the charging cars"
"in ohio i feel like the majority you have to pay with quarters, but there are some free ones. the options are there though. wouldn’t even care if they cost money, and if they cost money no problem letting anyone use them."
In California air and water are required and must be free at any gas station. Law should definitely be updated to include supercharger stations.
"In Oregon, it's the law that fuel stations open to the public have free to use air compressor. Many of them are coin operated, and people don't realize you can just stick your head in the shop or store area and ask them to hit the remote ""on"" switch."
Being locked out of a charger wouldn't be cool either though.
[deleted]
You will have to take your own air hose.
"Or people paying to use it.  If an ICE is paying for the charger, why should you care?"
This is how you make non-Tesla owners hate Tesla owners. Lol
Why not make it that it will only operate when the charger is connected to a car.

Such systems have been around for a long time. They just aren’t very common. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tire_inflation_system
That seems crazy to me. Such a cheap and simple thing can save so much hassle.
"There are definitely government owned and operated rest stops that feature private restaurants and gas stations. Notably state owned facilities on toll roads/turnpikes(federally run highways don't allow it).

The biggest hurdle Tesla would run into is their proprietary system that only works with their car.

A BP Station works with nearly every make of car. A Sbarro's has food applicable to most the public. A Supercharger however only works with one make of car, so it makes it a hard sell to the government who is charged to make sure the services provided at the stop are useful to the wide public."
"There's definitely all that stuff at government-owned rest areas in other parts of the country in places. There are Superchargers 100 feet from I-95 at multiple service/rest areas in Connecticut and more being built. The Hookset Supercharger on I-93 in New Hampshire and one on the Florida Turnpike are like that as well.

The CT ones might be available because the road pre-dated the interstate system."
"The Ohio Turnpike has service plazas with gas stations. I've also seen them on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Kansas Turnpike. The former Connecticut Turnpike (I-95 & I-395) has Superchargers at some rest stops, the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut also has a supercharger at a rest stop, New Hampshire has one on I-93, Maine Turnpike has Superchargers at Kennebunk rest stop, Florida Turnpike has supercharger at Fort Drum rest area, Indiana has fast food and gas stations on their turnpike, and the New Jersey Turnpike has restaurants and gas stations. I don't recall ever seen anything out west now that I think about it though. looking at that list it seems that they're all on toll roads (or in the case of Connecticut pre-war highways or highways that used to be toll roads)."
The original comment just says ‘rest stops’
"The problem is, it's not unreasonable to expect someone to ruin it for everyone as well."
"> Doesn't expand /contract AS MUCH in heat/cold

 FTFY"
Ooooh. So it resets the PSI to be wrong tho?
"Every state is different.  In Connecticut, they must provide it free upon request.  Pretty much every station charges, hoping you don’t know any better, but if you tell them to give it to you free they will."

"First of all, that's the law in California, but the question was about the U.S. generally, and it's not the law in every state. Also, although it's true that not every gas station in the U.S. provides free air at all, what I was thinking about was the opposite: not every gas station makes you pay for air if you haven't made a purchase. I remember occasionally filling up my bike tires at a gas station without having to bring quarters.

Either way, my point stands that your original statement was too absolute. Had you added the words ""**In California**"" to your first sentence and ""**might** [have to pay]"" to your second sentence, it would have been fine."
like a gas station
The one by me in PA at the Shell station is $1.50 for 3 minutes of air. Barely enough time to properly check and top off your air if needed. Sign says the money goes to charity - I don’t believe that one bit.
Bob Sumeral Really Cares!
"Ohio resident here.  I can think of 1 free one in my area, and it’s outside of an AAA repair shop (and always has a car there)"
You could have said the exact same thing when Tesla originally rolled out their supercharger network.
"Pull an Apple move and make it so that Tesla's use a proprietary valve and connector. Then charge $249.99 to refill your tires. But the benefit is that the pump looks pretty slick and the air is imported from California, as well as the proprietary valve increasing tire refill time by 7%."
Cuz I still need to charge my damn car lol
Why would an ICE pay to use a charger? That makes no sense.
[deleted]
"Takes up trunk space which is at a premium.  1/3rd of car models sold today don’t include a spare tire.

Also, tire plug kits you can buy off Amazon weren’t as widespread as they are today."
The other exception is for rest areas created before 1960.  The intent was to prevent state sponsored gas monopolies on federal highways.  Creating a state sponsored monopoly that doesn’t even serve the vast majority of the traveling public would be an extra layer of malfeasance.
I predict a lot of friction in the future if the supercharger network doesn’t open up.  NY is already pressuring tesla by threatening to stop giving them breaks on peak electrical rates.
"I don't think that filling bucket of water and add a squirt of Windshield Washer Fluid is too much to ask. I don't mean to sound classist, but if you are doing well enough in life to be able to drive a Tesla you can probably be trusted with squirting some fluid into a bucket out of a dispenser. 

No different to Gas Stations having a bucket out in the open."
"No.  If your PSI is 39, it just tells the tesla computer ""39 is normal"" vs whatever the default is, 44?"
"Sucks when that happens doesn’t it? Now you know how Americans feel.

Also, every single country I went to I had to pay...  I’ve been to 15 countries in Europe by the way."
"Thank you! 

We are going to be in Sao Paulo for a couple of days later this month, are there some things we should see there?"
"Yep, but the thing is that usually tesla chargers don't have much space as gas stations. At least the ones I know. They always try to use the max space possible for chargers."
At a gas station the air compressors are not at the pumps.   OPs idea  would be fine so long as the compressor was only accessible from a non charging stall.   Otherwise we'd be waiting for some yokel to 60lbs on his Dualy.
What a novel concept
I see what you did there... ;-)
3 minutes is within the time I can refill and check all my tires. Unscrew all your caps and check pressure... then insert coins and start the clock
"WTF, the Mobil and BP right by my house both have free air compressors. Is charging for air pretty common?"
https://www.freeairpump.com/map/
"Yeah, if you can get near a major interstate your best bet is a truck stop."
In the U.K. you can usually check the tires pressure without having to pay. To fill it up you need to pay. So I first check. And then use the 3 minutes to race around.
Conrad's and Giant Eagle are free.  Also Sheetz it seems.

"Elon announced version 2 which will fill your tires twice as fast, being deployed at new locations now."

Hope it’s not too much like apple or after 10 uses the end will fall off and won’t be covered by warranty and you won’t be able to get it working until the next update and then find out your old devices have been made obsolete even though they are working just fine.
Inflate with nitrogen and inflate once
">and the air is imported from California

Say no more, please be quiet and take my money!"
Air in California is not really great...
"If they are paying for the slot and time using the position, the gives an economic incentive to get more slots.

Finding gasoline stations with air pumps for tires is often hard to find even if they charge for air.  If I knew that a Tesla charging station had air pumps for $2-$3, I might just consider paying that for 5-15 minutes with my ICE vehicle.  I doubt charging earns Tesla more per minute."
They wouldn't. They're saying they'd take up a charging spot to fill up their tired.
"I just look at it like you could still do all that and have a spare for those times your outside cell coverage, in a bad neighborhood or assistance is hours away."
"Eh, I’ve plugged tires before. It can be a bigger pain than changing it and they don’t work for every leak. Plus you have to carry a compressor that can take up almost as much space as a spare. Seems like just car companies saving a few bucks by passing the issue off to the owner."
All too true. But then you have those that can't resist free stuff. They'd be filling containers with the washer solvent concentrate to take home for no other reason than it was free. Sounds great on paper. I think I just get to see the worst in people too often.
Ooooh I see. Thanks!

Well after all these fires I would say Cali air is overrated.
"Maybe from NorCal, but when most people think of California they think Hollywood, you don't want our air trust me."
"That's very poorly thought out. Why would Tesla allow them to block the exclusive bays for Tesla's? It's like saying they should make the charger work for all electric vehicles, it's just very shortsighted. Who cares if you make a few extra dollars from air? You lose the exclusivity you give to the people who buy Tesla's. It just doesn't make sense from a business point."
"Wut, a portable compressor these days can be had for the space of a wallet:

"At Gas Stations they often leave the bucket out in the open and it's very rare for the bucket to get stolen. If someone is really cheap enough to take some Washer Fluid, maybe just let them have some, but if they were really cheap then they would just take their car to the Supercharger/Gas Station and use THEIR water and Washer Fluid to wash on the spot. 

Maybe some ICE drivers will come to clean their windows - doesn't really matter - free marketing for Tesla to have them spend time around their cars. Just as Tesla owners make use of Gas Stations to wipe their windows right now, it should go both ways.

If it was really a problem, you could get the dispenser to pre-mix before it comes out and rate limit how often buckets can be filled."

Yup. I don't want the riffraff coming near my car to fill their tires up or clean their windows. Those free air stations at gas stations can have very long lines at times. I wouldn't appreciate the attention.

Your tires would be full of hot air!
"I want to share in the socal dream, even if it's just of whif of BO and exhaust"
"> Who cares if you make a few extra dollars from air?

Those who are running the charging stations.  Specifically the shareholders of Tesla or the partners of Tesla who may be running these charging stations.  If it keeps the charging profitable or makes them profitable in a marginal situation, it would make sense to expand services.

> You lose the exclusivity you give to the people who buy Tesla's. 

And so what?  Exclusivity means a small market.  Opening it up to more people means a much larger market.

I get that you are trying to go off of some mystique of exclusivity as some sort of selling point for these charging stations so people would be more inclined to buy a Tesla automobile.  I would say it doesn't make sense to go down that path though and think of it more like how gas stations are now more convenience stores than what it used to be as garages and repair stations that also happened to sell gasoline.  You also don't need to even own a car to visit a convenience store and buy things there.

Looking at it from the perspective of those running such stalls, the more services you can offer to differentiate yourself from competitors is what gets you customers.  The problem is how to deal with customers who stick around not paying anything for that spot... and that doesn't matter if they are driving an ICE or EV as the issue is still the same.

Tesla can still offer topping off the tires as a sort of courtesy service as an incentive for purchasing their automobiles.  Those vehicles which are not Tesla vehicles (Rivian, Fisker, Baker Electric, etc.) would have to pay for that service too.  It also fits Elon Musk's ethos of trying to encourage an EV future where somebody who drives an ICE but getting to know where the charging stations are at and meeting EV drivers with their vehicles would also get massive exposure to information about EVs and Tesla vehicles in particular.  Think of it sort of as advertising in a low key manner too."
That’s fine until you get a flat that can’t be patched. I’ve had a number of those but I’ve never had my car so full I needed the spare tire space for a little more stuff.
"Shame!
How could I forget? 

Just had some a couple of hours ago 🙈"

"A few do, but they're typically provided as a nicety by local Tesla owners or local business owners. There's really no good maintenance plan for that stuff at most chargers, so most don't have anything but the chargers (no air, no windshield washer tools, no trash cans)"
"Usually there's no staff just a bunch of chargers in a parking lot, so there is nobody to maintain them if there were garbage cans or windshield washing tubs. Sometimes the property owners are cool and supply them as a courtesy. There's one in South Dakota I think (might've been Wyoming) where it's very appreciated because there's a bug problem on that stretch of road. Mac's in .. Missouri (?) Is a great one. Multiple trash cans, windshield washing stuff, and free coffee and stuff for Teslas. There's a bakery chain in Texas incant recall the name that has chargers in a few locations and treats us well also."
"No.  No trash bins either (and usually plenty of trash on the ground, tesla has attracted a lot of litterbugs).  We all still use gas stations for these things.  Pick up a coffee to support the station owner."
"The best charger locations imo are next to gas stations. I use their stuff (bathroom mostly) and I never buy gas while I’m  charging obviously but I always buy gum, waters, Diet Coke , etc.  I don’t think the station minds at all so long as I spend some money. I see everyone else at the charger doing the same."
"I understand the sentiment, but understand gas stations make very little margin off of gas itself and depend much more on the drinks and snacks and all the other stuff they sell to make a profit. So, if you buy some of that stuff you should feel better using their amenities."
"Most of the time gas stations make no money off the gas. The gas brings people into the store. The same could be said of me stopping by to use their amenities. Actually, I probably spend more then anybody pumping gas at the time so they can fuck right off if they said that to me."
"Depends on the place. In my country all those air stations are paid. You spit out 50 cents for the air machine to work for a few minutes. So I'd definitely not feel guilty.

If it's a ""Free"" station then it's different. Back in the days when those were popular the stations were always trashed... hoses broken, etc. Now that it's paid they take better care of them."
"I make a purchase each time, so thats not where I'm a dick. I'm a dick because I'll park next to the gas pump if theres no spots available. #worksbothways"
Run inside and grab some snacks and drinks I guess
"They have that stuff there for free because if you stop by to use them, you’re more likely to go inside to get a snack or soda or something, which is where they make their real money. 

Same with the gas, actually. From what I understand, gas stations are like movie theaters in that they make *very* little money from the gas/movie tickets, and depend almost entirely on the sale of much higher margin concession stand/convenience store items you might buy while you’re there.

Be self aware and considerate, of course. Like, don’t block a pump to use the squeegee when cars are waiting to fill up, and don’t use it to clean heavy mud off your car. Don’t trash the bathroom or break the air pump nozzle... But otherwise, I say you should feel free to use them if they’re offered."
So buy a drink inside.  Their margins are on the food they sell more than gas prices (it’s not the gas stations themselves making a lot of money on the high gas prices).
"Yeah always awkward to use their amenities and not buy anything. I was once in the middle of nowehere using a windshield cleaner. Usually, id just head out after. But since i got the tesla. I ALWAYS try to go in and buy something. Till i saw the crazy marked up prices. $10 for a bag of chips. No thanks."
Superchargers tend to be out of the way and not nearly as visible as gas stations. I highly doubt the general public is going to be lining up around the block to squeegee their windows at Superchargers.
"I corrected your spelling, not your grammar."
*valve (Markdown's a bitch.)
"This is such a naive point of view. Allowing random people to take up Tesla spots will alienate Tesla owners who have paid to use those spots for supercharging, and will also make the exclusive charging pro of buying a Tesla seem much less worth it, after all their charging spot could easily be taken be some random Nissan driver. All so you can make a tiny (and it will be tiny) bit of money selling compressed air which is already available all over the place.

Tesla had to start enforcing the Tesla only rules more strictly because ICE drivers were taking the spot, and that was causing outrage by owners and prospective buyers.

I would personally be very pissed off if I had bought a Tesla, and if the supercharging spot (that has Tesla branding all over it) was taken by some random other car. There would be outrage on these forums. It would be very bad PR for Tesla of people were saying random ICE cars of other brands in the exclusive Tesla spots.

Brand exclusivity is a *very* powerful tool, it's probably the reason for half of Apple's success. Given that Tesla has been trying (and has been successful) at creating an exclusive brand image like Apple, allowing this would be akin to Apple switching to USB-C and then advertising that ""it works with Android phones as well"". That would be such an absurd and damaging thing for Apple to do, and would also for Tesla.

It's so easy to see how much of a bad business idea this is, you really don't understand the first thing about marketing and running a business if you think it's anything but a very bad idea."
"What's fine is that 95% of flat tires, like a nail in the tread, can be repaired long enough to get to a tire shop.  Cargo space in sedans and SUVs is at a premium.  Doesn't matter if it's not your use case.

I guess you've stopped pretending that a tire is as small as a portable compressor since that's ludicrous.

If you hit a deep pothole then you likely need alignment work done so a spare is just a stopgap anyway."
Plus a random smattering of restaurants etc.
"Yes, buying other stuff is fine. Gas stations make more profit from convenience store items than from gas."
"Best SCs are near truck stop gas stations. 24/7 clean bathrooms, food (real food too), coffee, emergency items... almost anything you would need. I think Love's should contract with Tesla because they always have tons of space at those for the truckers and shit. Might as well start the conversion now, because when the Tesla Semi is unveiled, a lot of those truckers are still gonna want to stop at their standard truck stops."
"Yes, obviously. Any customer should be entitled to use their free services."
I know they will where I am. Free air.
"> It's so easy to see how much of a bad business idea this is, you really don't understand the first thing about marketing and running a business if you think it's anything but a very bad idea.

I would suggest you check your ego at the door a bit and calm down with the ad hominem attacks.  Your arguments are about my supposed stupidity rather than what is wrong with the idea.

It also seems that somehow you are personally offended that somehow you are not entitled to some special privilege and that you and only you alone are supposed to get some special service here.  Tesla is running a business here and it is up to them to decide how they might best turn a profit.  I am simply suggesting that **as long as the customer is paying for the service** it doesn't matter if it is an ICE, some other non-Tesla vehicle, or whatever is at the charging stall.  It really doesn't matter and frankly it **helps** Tesla owners because it makes the charging network a profit center for Tesla.  In the long run it means **more** charging points will be available **because** it is profitable.

You simply think it is a bad business idea because you personally don't like it and don't want to wait for somebody else when they are using a parking stall with a charger.  I hate to break it to you, but if it wasn't profitable and if it was an extra cost to Tesla, you would have a very hard time even finding chargers.  Your contrary argument would actually cause **fewer** chargers to exist and possibly force charging stations in marginal areas to shut down.  How does that help exactly?"
[deleted]
I can see it's beyond your capability..
Yea Kettleman has a lounge with barista. I think we agree on content but your wording wasn't quite how I'd word it. Saying most superchargers have zero amenities *provided by Tesla* I think we can both agree on. However Tesla definitely tries to put their superchargers near existing amenities with varying degrees of success.
Indeed it is beyond my capability to teach you simple economics through short pithy comments on Reddit.  'tis a pitty too since opening your world view might help you see something beyond the end of your nose.
"Yes of course opening my world view must be going back to the most basic economic model. You have no understanding of modern economics or how restricting your clients can actually increase your profits.

Imagine thinking you know more than a large company with actual accountants and economists.

Please do try and post this question on ask economics if you want to have other people try and enlighten your small arrogant view of economics."
man that 3rd row is going to be interesting.
Was wrapping up a long charge for a long leg of our trip back home when this model  Y drove up and started a line waiting for a stall.  A lot of folks noticed and took pictures.  Taken at Tejon Pass super charger December 1st.
The partial chrome delete is really throwing me off lol
Looks like it's weighed down in the back.
"This car really messes with my brain, I really can't see how this would be a 7 pax."
"Omg that is the most unflattering angle I’ve ever seen for the Model Y...

Looks like a Prius from this angle. 😫"
"Oh I was there a few hours ago. Long line. Slow charge. At least 3 stalls didn’t charge for me. Holidays in a Tesla is really terrible because of the long line wait. 

When I5 was shutdown due to snow, I traveled the coast to get down to LA, the super chargers along the way was terrible. :/

It is so clear to me that Tesla is not keeping Supercharger production up with Model 3 production. I shouldn’t go anywhere popular on thanksgiving."
"This has to be the worst angle for this car lol. Also, is it just me or is there a surprisingly high glass to body ratio? It seems to have much bigger windows than anything else I’ve seen on the road in a very long time and I think that’s a good thing."
I wonder if these are going to be the new default aero wheels. I think I like them better than the Model 3's.
I want the Y so much.
"I wanted to like this car, but it is the most uninspiring thing Tesla has produced. I love the 3 and have two of them, but they really phoned this fucker in."
GDit I can’t wait for this car to hit the market!  I’ve been saving up to buy one and am ready to pull the trigger already!

"Between this and that recent video of the 3rd row, I see there are still two different hatch variations floating around out there. In one, the line curves down to the the side and edges up to the light. In the other, the line goes straight back and there’s space between it and the light. Which will it be? https://imgur.com/gallery/AXgsXuk"
"It looks fine lol. 

Surprised to see so much hate here tbh. 

If this is ugly, so is your Tesla. They all share a similar aesthetic. 

It will still be the most popular model."
Why does Model Y look different in every single picture/video posted here?
"Am I the only one who thinks the Y isn't different enough from either the 3 or the X to warrant purchase?

I mean, I can see someone wanting the 3 or the X, but what does the Y do? What segment is it for?"
Damn I actually want this thing
"The more I see it, the happier I am with my decision not to wait for it and get the model 3."
Very little clearance. Have they said how much higher it will sit and whether it will have more clearance than the M3?
"Nope, still don't like it."
Very disappointed that the ground clearance really looks like it's 0 to 1 inches more than 3
Amazing that’s a 7 seater
I wish it wasn't so sloping at the back. Feel like it'll cut down the useable space by a lot for cargo.
how on earth do you get 7 seats in that?  Or is that why it's not available until 2021?  They're hoping to figure out how to locally bend spacetime?
"dammit, the cyberturduken is in my head again. This looks like a Prius now. Wish Musk would stop his innovating"
Looks so boring now that we will in a post Cybertruck world.
"I’ll say it, it looks a bit dodgy. I say this as a cyber truck reserver."
"So, the base Cybertruck will be priced less than the base Model Y? It looks the Model 3 is a $3.5K premium over comparable Model 3.
The main reason I’d get a Model Y over the Cybertruck is because the Cybertruck is too bulky and either won’t fit in my garage at all or would be such a tight fit in the garage that getting it to fit with room to close the garage door would be a constant nightmare. 

Elon said there would be a smaller version of the Cybertruck in the future. I assume it would be priced less than the F-150-sized Cybertruck which would make Model Y pricing look that much worse in comparison."
"Man, that thing is ugly. Is the ratio off in the pic or something?"
"Glad I reserved the cybertruck. Was planning on getting the Model Y, but the more I see it in public the more I realize it’s not a big enough vehicle. Wish the Model X wasn’t so expensive 😭"
Damn it doesn’t look bad at all
"Tesla really is decades ahead of the game, the Y is already ""done"" (testing, etc, they just need to build and ship them) while Lexus introduce a new SUV with a 53,4kwh air cooled battery with chademo."

God that’s ugly.
"Compared to Tesla’s other models, that one looks disappointingly un-special. Could easily be mistaken for any one of the SUV / people movers that 80% of my suburb drive."
Y Tho?
It's so ugly
Can see the panel gaps from here /s
It looks so weird from this angle.. I swear it was prettier than this.
"It’s not much of a looker, is it?"
Chrome allover for that flight of the navigator look. I still like it.
Why is Tesla not putting priority on eliminating supercharger waiting lines? That’s a real Achilles’ heel ...
There have been a few such pics here this week - are these in production or are they just employees we see in these pics?
I still think the matte black was a mistake. It just looks... boring
Got some junk in that trunk 😳😛
I knew I wasn't crazy! I saw him going the opposite way on the 5 for just a second right near there. Thanks for the pic!
"Not impressed with the Y 
Willing to have my mind changed though"
"I hope production starts soon. Have my order in for a Y, but my wife is itching to get into another EV. I don’t want to get a 3 and then a Y in a few months.
Hopefully they are ahead of schedule and start deliveries in the next few months and then ramp up"
And....?
This is the second model y today. Are they starting to be shipped?
"Thanks.  Wow this is good to know... will probably try to plan trips outside of holidays and drive late nights. 

Hopefully Tesla can have a digital queue for charging spaces in the future 🤔"
I wish they would have changed the front/rear lights up a bit. I want to buy one but it’s too similar to my 3.
I actually....really like this angle?
ta feo
Love the no chrome!
"I feel stupid, what is a model Y, and why does it look so similar to the 3?  
  
Why is it being made?"
What is the etiquette when waiting for a Super Charger spot? Seriously asking.
"I think it may be more similar to the Subaru Impreza Hatchback,"
OH MAN I WANTTTTT MINE NOWWWWW
Reminds me of a Yaris... except... cool! :P
"I wanted to like Model Y, but it looks like Model 3 that was hit by puberty."
How
Small again...
Mmm the rear end looks squashed.
"Omg, those are some ugly ass wheels... Just came here to comment that"
"Tesla is good in making powertrains, batterys software etc. But design is not their strength
Model S was good
Model X was OK
Model 3 something in between
Model Y way below OK"
That is just a fat model 3. Woof
"The proportions of the Y just feel sorta off to me. It looks more like a Ford Fiesta instead of a crossover, or something."
Why is the CyberTruck design so innovative and the rest of the models so standard?
Looks like a prius/ioniq.
Tesla loves making nice cars look ugly as fuck with their wheels
"You might say... Out in the Y'ld...

Sorry."
that shit is fugly
Eh...
Stupid question. What’s the easiest way to identify model y? TIA!
This makes me even more excited for the Cybertruck!
"For a 3 member family like mine, with a dog...this is a gr8 car....my parents in front...dog in middle row nd me @ back seat ....man what a life"
Came here to say this. How on earth are people going to fit back there
It's just to tick a box on a spec sheet... There is no way that 3rd row will be practical.
Just picture the second row of any convertible. They will technically be “seats”.
Did people forget about the rear facing seats in the Model S?
It will be like the other crossover 3rd rows. Useless.
An extra 3k for seats I don't need? I'll take the storage space pls&thankyou
"yea it really does not look big enough...  I want to buy it, but I need something more like model x size... but not model x money."
"How were your wait times for a SC at Tejon? Super long lines? 

I’ve been trying to plan a trip between San Francisco and Los Angeles one of these holiday weekends but have been afraid of the long waits.  (Mostly afraid of the Gustine one by Pea Soup actually)"
Very cool. We were just there this morning too - would have loved to see it.
"I asked him if I could look at the boot. I wanted to know how my dogs would fit. He said, ""no"". Lol."
They really should black out the part of the camera.
What is partial chrome delete?
In before chrome undeletes.
I'm thrown off by the mismatched tinting of the windows.
Ask your mom where she was on the night of December 1st.
Those third row seats will probably fit marginally larger people than the model S rear facing seats did.

"Was just going to say this... I guess people have acclimated to the Prius shape by now, but meh

At least it’ll have space. Prius always surprises me with what it can fit."
"Maybe Franz is running out of design ideas, in 6 vehicles they went from sexy to frumpy to just whack some straight lines together."
"well, good thing cybertruck is only 3 years away"
From this photo it makes me want to refund my deposit.
"Some angles it looks ok, other angles I can't help but see a Pontiac Aztek."
"I'm struggling with this. I've been driving a Model S for 3 years. I adore it. I love its silky smooth ride. I love the utility of its cavernous space. I love traveling long distances with the dogs in the back. It's the most beautiful car on the road. But the paltry range, efficiency, and supercharger rate is getting a little irritating in the face of these cheaper upstarts.

I think the Y would fit my needs nicely. It seems like a very practical car. It could do the weekend duties with ease. But it's so ugly, lol. I already think the 3 looks ""meh""; inflating it vertically isn't helping the situation.

I could just be happy with the beautiful AP1 S that I love. Or I could spend more money, get the tech improvements, but no longer be sexually attracted to my car."
I kind of agree
Looks a lot like BMW's 2 series lineup of Active Tourer. The BMW 3 series Gran Turismo looks bigger.
Agreed. It looks like some Nissan. Just so… nondescript
A sexy Prius at the very least
Thank you.  Fighting with myself about my Mach E deposit.
OMG a compact SUV looks like... a compact SUV! There's a reason car guys hate that body type.
Was going to post this as well.
"Elon mentioned this at the Model Y unveiling. They deliberately paused Supercharger deployment while they perfected V3 Supercharging, so that new stations could be V3. I agree that it sucks for now, but I think we'll be better off in the long run."

"On the way back from LA we skip the I5 because of this but at the San Luis Obispo sc.  line was long but they deployed mobile sc so that was cool.  

However I don’t enjoy or recommend the 101 drive at all.  So much curve and uphill drive.   Even with AP the drive is sketchy."
"Agreed, it looks like the type of car Tesla was specifically trying to avoid: the dinner roll."
Ugh.  I’m tired of cars with high belt lines and slits for windows.
idk I think it looks cute
They had to make it higher in the rear to allow headroom for the 3rd row. Also allows for more trunk space - great for taxis... possibly self-driving ones.
I kinda prefer the OG aeros. These are too soccer mom for me. Not sure why I get that vibe. Also I really dislike the color of that Y. Is it like a light blue/green?
"They are the same 19"" aero wheels used in China on the Performance models. It would make sense for the Y to move up to 19"" base wheels, just like the X uses larger wheel sizes than the S."
"I’m feeling that way too, but on paper at least it’s got what the 3 lacks, a hatchback, higher ride height, more cargo space.  Just not as attractive imo."
Lol you’ve just been ruined by the Cybertruck
"I could not disagree more... I think it's a great addition. Simple, capable, and carrying over successful design language from the Model 3."
"I do really wish they could have differentiated their models better.  If you put a Model 3, Y, and X all in a row, it looks like small, medium, and large."
It's funny how opinions have changed on the Y vs the CT.
"I joined the Tesla community in earnest after the S and X were already out, but I wonder what then-current thoughts were on the production version of the Model X. Aside from the Falcon Wing Doors and the unique second/third row seating styles, there is nothing else differentiating it from a Model S feature-wise. If it had regular rear doors and a bench it would just be a big S.

I think that may be why some feel the way you do; Model Y doesn't have those unique differentiating features, so at the end of the day it really is just a big Model 3, but with a hatchback (and power liftgate isn't really a signature feature).

What I think the hype is about is the fact that the Model 3 has been selling like hotcakes in a segment/class that's seen declining sales in the US, while crossovers and SUVs are on the rise. One can only dream of what Model Y sales will look like with that in mind, so the more vanilla the better honestly. It's a proven design and package, and some people really do just want a bigger 3."
"Same. I really want this to be my next car, on paper. It seriously looks like a mom mobile, which isn’t appealing at all to me personally."
The things no one notices but mean something
"the second one looks kinda weird. Maybe it’s just the angle the picture was taken at, though."
"The second one (straight down) is on the original prototype from the Model Y event. 

The clay model at that event and all other more recent Model Y’s spotted on the road have the style on the left where the hatch seam lines up with the bumper seam below it."
I think it looks great!
*laughs in Cybertruck*
Need more room than the 3 but don't have $100k+ to spend on a car? Model Y.
"3 price with more cargo room, higher ride. Someone in the market/price range for a 3 won’t buy an X just for more cargo room. The price jump is too high. 

My past two cars have had hatches and not being constricted to a trunk has been invaluable."
It's way more affordable than the X. That's why I'll be buying one.
"To me Y makes 3 irrelevant. Hatchback is the best form factor for a car, imo."
That’s my question too. I’m curious how it compares with something like an Audi Q3 or Q5.
"You just said it. It's a 3 but with more room and a higher seating height, basically."
You don’t see the appeal of a taller car with more space and a hatchback?
Isn’t that the target audience?  I think this will be the car that swings the soccer moms and suburban dads over to electric vehicles. It’s gonna sell like hot cakes because it’s NOT ostentatious.
[deleted]
Could be with trucks most people buy them to do work( most not the I have small dick complex guys so I will buy the biggest truck there is). So they were able to make something more innovative. It has better  areodynamics for something as heavy as a truck is nice. The design is more structurally sound. Straight edges make for stronger overall capabilities. Short answer if you get a truck you want it to be strong and do the job its given.
"I don't know if I'd go that far, but I don't love it. I wish the back came up higher. Just my opinion. If people like it, that's cool too. It's a good car either way."
[deleted]
"Easiest in my opinion is that it's the only model that comes de-chromed (black side camera mounts, door handles, etc.).

I think it's easy to tell apart from the S, but harder from the 3 and X.

It's smaller than an X, and the passanger door handles are in a different spot.

It looks a LOT like the 3, except de-chromed and obviously a hatchback."
"Kids are small...

And when they grow up to the age where they don't want to be seen with you or getting driven by you... you reluctantly allow them to use the self driving Telsa Taxi's that came out in 2021 to get around even though it's safer than getting driven by you.

You then change out your car for a 5 seater, as you don't need that 7 seater anymore, and it's perfect for you. Eventually the kids grow past the age where they don't like you, and you start to hang out again, but they know better now from learning about statistics and safety at school than to let you drive them around so they rely on the Taxi service fully. They also will never bother to learn to drive as it's useless to them. 

Eventually they move out and live their own life. They come visit once in a while, and always tell you to sell that old 5 seater Tesla you got around 10 years ago, as it's an antique and that you should start using the self driving Tesla Taxi's as it's much safer. Eventually you comply and that's when you realize the last car you would ever drive and own was a Tesla.

... or if you are a weirdo who drives around with 6 adults at the same time, then yeah good luck to the people who made the lifechoices that led them into the back seats of a 7 seat Tesla Model Y."
Is this a third row built for Ants?
Looks like a 95 Honda crx
Something like the Mazda5?
https://i.imgur.com/6f80nPu.jpg
Maybe rear-facing like the Model S.
Chop their legs off
There’s not even adult headroom for 2nd row.
Has to be 2 small rear facing sets.
"They’re for legless people, hobbits, and pets."
"My guess is that the floor in the back sits pretty low, and provides enough room for semi-reclined bucket seats.  It's hard to say though, because we can't even really see the layout of the second row in this pic."
"There's a Japanese variant of the Prius V with a 3rd row, so it could be practical for some situations and a gimmick for most."
"Might be handy in a pinch, though. Literally."
"Same with cybertrucks front bench seat. You cant really fit anyone in a normal truck bench seat, so I doubt the cybertruck will fit anyone"
Plenty room for Baby Yoda I betcha
"But those were for kids. They said the ones for the Y would fit adults. I don’t see any way for that to be possible, but that’s what they said."
How is that even legal
We waited 15 mins.  Some times while we were charging there was no line.  Today was obviously a high traffic day and often the SC is mostly empty
Just went from Sedona to Sacramento on Friday afternoon / Saturday morning.  We drove through the night and didn't have any issues with lines or traffic.  Kind of a pain but definitely glad we avoided the Grapevine closure and all the crazy lines.
Drove back Saturday and there was a crazy line at kettleman. Moved pretty fast though
"I drive up from LA to the Bay Area very very frequently in my Model 3 and ALWAYS stop at the Kettleman City charging station. There's an In-N-Out right there and the charger has an awesome little lounge with bathrooms, coffee bar, and free wi-fi. It's even secured with a code you only get by tapping the station icon on you MCU."
"I just did my first two trips to visit my parents up in the Bay Area, and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was.  I was very worried about this weekend, but I stopped in Dublin and Kettleman City (I have a LR Model 3) and didn't have to wait at all.  Stopped at Split Pea Anderson's on the way up, also no wait."
I typically stop at Gustine and have only seen a line once and it was only 1 car. I went this thanksgiving weekend too and it was the same
It is in all the Tesla publications. I wonder if they just put in a model 3 camera because it's what they had or for a test
Agreed.  The less chrome the better
So usually the trim and the door handles have chrome on it. On this model you can see it’s blacked out.  But the chrome around the side camera is not blacked out. So it just looks a little out of place only having that one piece of chrome
I would legitimately do this just to annoy the NeverChromers on this sub.
"That’s a California regulation thing, the max tint allowed is a lot darker for the back doors than the front."
Since it's classified as a suv the rear glass can be dark as hell from the factory
"classified as a SUV, the bad windows are allowed to be tinted but not the front in a lot of states.  You can tint the front yourself. Some states are less strict. Some places are fucking anal, some cops will use it for a reason just pull you over. Some states have crazy fines like $250 per window.

&#x200B;

it's a fucking joke."
What
Lol
"My mom's old 2003 Acura MDX had a third row, but even as a kid I always felt super cramped. People think third rows only exist or are useful if you have a minivan or shuttle bus or something, but that's not always the case. Better to have the option available to add than not."
They got me by the balls because I’ll only get hatchback :(
"Agreed. I’ve always thought the X looks more like a minivan than an suv, and this looks like a microvan. 

But, if their design team just focuses on taking the sedan and stretching it up, that’s what you’re gunna get. 

They did well with the (refreshed) S, did well with the 3...but everything else is not that attractive. Technology amazing, but not attractive."
True. The Prius has way more legroom and storage than a similarly sized sedan like a Camry.
"I look at it as a competitor for the forester or crosstrek so it was never going to be all that sleek but it’s got 8” more in the wheelbase than those two. So its probably got better room for five people and gear as well as better performance. I still want it, my only means for hesitation is the cybertruck will be the same price with the 6’ bed, 120 & 220 outlets, compressor, room for 6, option for solar, just gotta wait..."
"I agree, this is a really bad angle for the Model Y... 

Makes me sad, because this is supposed to finally be my entry into the Tesla ownership world."
Lol
I wish they would make a cybertruck hatchback the length of the model S
It kind of looks hunchbacked... or like a cat preparing to puke

I zoomed in and feel much better about the y
"I’ve been wondering why none of the planned chargers near me had started development yet. While this decision seems sound, it’s also a little disappointing for places that greatly need more SCs around."
I feel like this is an excuse. More than half of Tesla owners currently cannot take advantage of V3 (I’m one of them) so we really need the SC stations to grow with the supply surge of model 3s.
They also mentioned not wanting to overbuild superchargers. Better for people to wait to charge than to build superchargers and nobody is using them when the company was very tight financially.
Yeah I was at the Anaheim SC today. Almost a third of the stations were out of service.
"I take the 101 all the time, it’s not that bad. I make sure to add a couple hours because I enjoy the scenery and particularly the sunsets. If I have to go somewhere fast I’ll take the 5, but it just gets boring after a few drives. I never get bored on 101."

"Is it really only 1” higher though?  That’s nothing. I’ve always loved subcompact SUVs, but I like to feel like I’m sitting tall. I don’t think 1” will do that."
"I felt this way the second they revealed the Model Y.  More like ""Model Why?""."
"same. wife wanted the Y sooo bad. now she's like ""what happened to the Y, it's so ugly??"" she doesn't believe me that they haven't changed the look of the Y"
Well I agree with simple and capable. My third word is ugly.
I think that was the intention... I like it

"When our S was in service and they gave us a loaner X, I loooooved the extra visibility.  Especially forward where the hood doesn't feel like it blocks your vision at all, but also 360° where you can just see more everywhere you look.  And of course upward into that stupidly beautiful wrap over windshield.

Also liked the self-opening and closing doors.

And the far easier ingress/egress.

And the sensors in all doors preventing them from bumping things when opening....

...We kind of hoped they'd forget about us and accidentally keep on letting us use the X."
"The Model X came out before the S refresh meaning it was the first vehicle with the new Tesla design language, it also had cool falcon doors and the largest windshield of any production vehicle in history. Auto-opening driver door, biodefense mode, neat sun visors. It had tons of cool shit that differentiated itself from the S. 

The Y is a 3 with chrome delete and a hatchback. The only big feature is a third row of seats which nobody has even seen yet."
Yeah but like... It's not that much bigger. It really doesn't seem like there's that much more room.
"I would be driving a 3 if it wasn't for the trunk. I hate sedans, so much less practical than a hatch. I think when the Y comes out, 3 sales will go down a LOT unless the price drops significantly. Why buy a 3 when you can get a Y?"
"This is where I am.  I literally just can’t buy a car with a trunk.  Anything else is fair game.  I carry TVs every now and then, and they don’t fit in a trunk.  So that’s that."
I guess the thing for me is that the Y doesn't look all that much bigger than the 3. Is the difference substantial?
"How much more is the cargo room? I know it's not an suv but if I want to replace my Acura mdx then is it in the ballpark?

The mdx can fit like 4 large suitcases in the back easily. Can this do that? Or maybe 2 or 3?

Acura is a gas guzzler and I don't think I ever want to buy another ICEV ever nor do I want to put $100k for an suv.

I was hoping this Y would be a suitable replacement. Maybe a Honda crv type which is fine. But looks like it might not be?"
"I don't. it doesn't really have more space. Why would i want my car to be taller?? I wish the 3 lowered tbh.  Hatchback=mom-mobile to me but that's a matter of taste. The 3 looks like a sports car. It has almost an exotic look to me, even though they are increasingly common."
"Uh, yeah. Just because the Yaris is hideous doesnt mean the Y isnt sexy. I see a slight resemblance, that's all."
Most people who buy trucks rarely use them for work purposes actually.
What about people who buy a P3D. Do they have small dicks too?
"Ya, seeing the diff between the Model 3 is my biggest struggle, especially when just speeding down freeways and not getting a good look at it."
This is amazing
True... it's gotta be fine for kids. I have a 3rd row on order with this mindset. May wait to actually see one though.
"Something, something, George Michael votes you out of his dorm room."
">... or if you are a weirdo who drives around with 6 adults at the same time, then yeah good luck to the people who made the lifechoices that led them into the back seats of a 7 seat Tesla Model Y.

this 100% - if im not driving, ill order an uber. Never catch me in a 3rd row"
Driving is fun though
is it like the model a 3rd row or standard style?
"Oddly specific, time traveler perhaps?"
2021? Hahahahaha. No.
This is a good copy pasta material.
*92 Honda stopped making them in 92
"Mazda 5 was the best van, it even had a 6 speed manual!"
Oh perfect! I have a legless hobbit for a pet.
So a grantee on being able to fit lalafell?
That doesn't solve the lack of leg room though.
That really depends on the side of the humans. Our current work truck fleet are F350s with the 6 seat option and 6 adults can and do ride that way
"I'd say the opposite here. With no center console to straddle, this is nothing like any of the trucks or vans I've had in the past. Obviously, not ideal, but a ton better than alternatives.

With how spacious the cab area looks, I would maybe compare them to one of the Oldsmobiles I used to have, which was fine for most people under ~170 lbs or so. It just made looking through the rear view mirror a no-go - something that'll be a nonissue in the cybertruck."
Adults come in all shapes and sizes? 🙃/s
Why wouldn't it?
"We waited about twenty minutes to put a little charge on at Buttonwillow on Saturday night. Someone had donated a legal pad, and we were standing out in the rain managing the queue. 

We thought we'd get the charge we needed to go up and hit the V3 chargers at Kettleman. Boy, was that ever the wrong choice.

We waited almost 40 to get to a charger there, and the charge rates were abysmally slow."
"Really? Kettleman is huge. 

The Tesla population has grown so much."
Also has a Dennis in short walking distance
I wish the code was in the app - I always forget to remember it before I get out of the car!
"Thanks!  That’s good to know actually... According to A Better Route Planner, Gustine is a “must stop” for my SR+, and wouldn’t have enough juice to turn back if anything."
Yeah it has it in the configurator: [https://www.tesla.com/modely/design#battery](https://www.tesla.com/modely/design#battery)

That's on you.
"I don’t know, it looks a lot smaller to me than the crosstrek and forester. I think I really have to see this in person and compare it to the 3."
Looks like a basic cross-over rental car.
It's hard to set yourself apart from all the other fanbois.
Autopilot thru the 5 is the safest and best.  Autopilot thru 101 with all the curve and construction and cross traffic is way too risky.  I think someone died on autopilot on 101 with cross traffic anyways .  I’ve done 101 with an ice before and it’s hard and tiresome curving for 4-5hrs of curve and hill climb.   The climb is really rough on wh/mi average and the down part is not steep enough for regen.
I’m hoping I can get 18s. I don’t want the range or performance penalties of larger wheels for fashion.
"The configurator is 18, 19, and 20 though."
6 inches.
"Because they wanted to spell out SEXY. In reality, this is a model 3 hatchback."
[deleted]
"I agree, and I think that’s a problem.  Not a huge problem, but mildly annoying."
"Ah true, those are all handy smaller features I forgot about.

I suppose that further proves my point about how the Y lacks all of these distinguishing features which makes it less appealing to existing Model 3 owners. But anyone who's joining the Tesla family for the first time or has an S/X will be pleased to see that they're offering a larger version of a proven new model."
"Slight correction, we have seen the third row, just not super up close and personal yet."
It’s a hatchback.
Americans don't care that they can get sedans/wagons with more space. They just like ugly unnecessary crossovers for some unexplainable reason.
"It’s got wayyyy more room than I need.  Also one advantage the 3 has is the efficiency is slightly better since it’s smaller and better drag.  Also slightly better maneuverability, handling, acceleration etc.."
"The 3 has really made my work commute so much nicer, and my wife and I take it around town to do shopping that we used to do with our SUV (which has been spending a lot more time in our driveway now that we have the 3).

It's really surprising how much room is in the Model 3 trunk. However!...the opening can be annoying at times. It's a tad smaller than it should be to easily reach/fit certain things in the trunk. 

Also, if there's water on the window/trunk, when you open the trunk, the water *may* hop over the ledge and go into the trunk instead of into the channel that leads around the trunk.

Probably my biggest complaint."
"It does have more space by virtue of it being a hatchback. For example: a bike goes straight in instead of having to remove the front wheel. I can camp without crawling through the space where the seats drop. Anyways, more utility is the gist of it. It doesn’t have to appeal to you to be appealing, ya know? Like a large SUV for me."
"Not where I live. I guess it's more of a location thing on that then. Most people who live here work construction, electrical, mines, haul stuff for their homes/ farms."
Thank you very much for the gold and happy Reddit cake day to you!!!
"As a Kid, I always hated sitting in the 3rd row of my mom's minivan, and so did my friends. I can't imagine any kid would find it enjoyable back there."
"I swear I read someplace that Elon stated the 3rd row will seat adults.  But yea maybe not comfortably and really meant for kids? We’ll see, I’m in the market for a 3 row Model Y"
"Yeah, but you’re gonna need a giant Q-tip to cram ‘em back there."
Probably why it's dangerous lol
"I'm sure there will still be places to drive recreationally like race tracks and stuff. It'll just be like any other fun thing. You're free to do it just don't do it somewhere where you're endangering people on their way to work or school, etc."
That's what makes this so incredibly rare.
"Yes, you are correct.  👍"
"Haha so I've heard, I'm actually looking into getting a used one eventually :)"
*gagged hobbit noises intensify*
Legolass is an elf.
He never said you wouldn't have your knees into your eyes...
Because you're sticking your kids basically in the trunk.
"Yeah, I was jealous of those that got on the v3..."
"Believe me, I was shocked"
Yeah Dennis is a nice guy
"Thanks, I couldn't hear you the first time, my ears are going out"
Cremated in 2011. Not her. Only 120 lbs.
"Will it be as good as the Model X third row? Probably not. If you absolutely, positively must transport more than 5 people in one vehicle, for whatever reason, will it come in handy? You bet."
"It’s a couple inches shorterthan the crosstrek but that could just be ground clearance, overall they seem a pretty close comparison in exterior-dimensions"
"isn't the range already lower for Y over the 3 though? unless you need 3rd row, that seems like a fashion choice too."
"The configurator also doesn't show either of the wheels we've actually seen on Model Y's, the 19"" Gemini or the black-painted Sport wheels from the unveil. 

&#x200B;

I think the wheels in the configurator are probably just stand-ins with final details to be updated later."
Oh way better. Thanks!

Link?
"I'm aware, but even so, that roof drops off so aggressively, it doesn't seem like it adds much utility.

I think calling it a CUV and comparing it in any way to the X or other SUVs is pretty silly.

I mean to be clear, I'd pick it over a sedan any day. But it's not the inexpensive model X that everyone wants it to be."
Yeah personally I just want a wagon with cybertruck stylings.
"Agreed that the trunk is actually surprisingly big. I happen to play the tuba as a hobby, and unfortunately can't fit it in the trunk like I could on my Camry due to the smaller size of the opening, but I can get used to using the back seat for those occasions. What it lacks in opening size, it makes up for in depth. It really goes back far, it has equal, if not more room than my Camry did in the trunk, with the added bonus of being able to keep all of the ""emergency"" type stuff in the ""spare"" compartment.   


PS. I do kind of wish the car had a spare."
"i hadn't thought of the camping aspect , so you sleep in the car? that's interesting. i used to have a Nissan Leaf - it was smaller than this i think, hatchback in that size meant basically a tiny useless trunk. The Leaf for me had zero utility over a sedan so I'm probably biased by that experience."
"Seems like you're part of the exception. 

>[75 percent of truck owners use their truck for towing one time a year or less \(meaning, never\). Nearly 70 percent of truck owners go off-road one time a year or less.

I did... ._.
my kids fight to sit in the 3rd row of our SUV (non Tesla). don't know why. they're 9 and 11.
And? How is that different than if a car hit you from the side?
I went to Kettleman at about midnight the Monday before TG and there wasn’t a soul there lol. To be exact there was 1 other guy. The v3 chargers are nice but to get to 100% it takes almost as long as a v2 that isn’t sharing power. Then again they’re almost always sharing power which is why I usually prefer a v1. Will be nice seeing v3s widely deployed a few years from now
"I was lucky enough to hit the new Ehrenberg v3 chargers during my Thanksgiving trip, but was limited to 100kw with my SR+. Looking forward to getting 2019.40 so I can actually take advantage of v3!"
But a bit of a menace.
Hatchback will be worth it.
"So does that mean the Y will come with a chrome painted side camera? /s

Remember when the 3 was unveiled it had wheels that never showed up on the configurator.

Likely parts just being used for tests because it's all that's available for testing but I wouldn't be surprised if the wheels will be sold on Tesla's website."
Looks like you were right! I'm bummed that there are no 18s though. 315 mile range is nice though. Hopefully that is a conservative estimate.  [https://www.tesla.com/modely](https://www.tesla.com/modely)

Oof yeah, I have a Volt and the trunk is fantastic.   Brought back two IKEA hardwood table tops plus extras. I also ride my bike from my parking lot to work every week and I can just toss the bike in the back without any hassle and without having to remove the wheel. It’s a gravel bike so there is no quick release, I’d have to use an Allen key every single time."

"That’s how I camped in Yosemite!

It has a lot more to do with the first number you cited than the second one. The teenage brain is remarkable (I'm not going to share the specific remarks in a family forum).

"I've got my Model 3 on 09/30/2018 and since then I've had a software update every 13 days on average - the longest period of no updates was 51 days and the shortest was 2 days. It's awesome to continue seeing updates over time, my car is absolutely better than it was when I bought it!"

"As a software engineer that has lost holidays to deliver arbitrary deadlines, 💯 this... thank you Tesla engineers! You are absolutly appreciated!"
"I took delivery toward the end of August - Been absolutely blown away by how much autopilot has improved since then. It’s only been a few months but it’s significantly better than when I first took delivery. Tesla engineers are awesome, and their work is truly amazing. Happy holidays to all."
Yup give these guys a holiday break! It's well deserved.
Merry Christmas Tesla employees thank you so much for everything that you do!
"Every time I see that download icon, it’s like Christmas and I get all giddy.  And I’m 41."
2019 has been insane. So many features that I take for granted (and love!) weren't in the car on 1 January 2019.
Seconded! You guys are building amazing stuff!
"My buddy has been picking me up every day for work since he got his Model 3 a year ago. The dedication Tesla shows to their product and improvements in the car over the year, are just one more reason why I reserved a cybertruck."
"I’ve only been here since August, and even since that time, noticeable improvements have been made. The software updates are number one on my list of Tesla benefits that I didn’t fully appreciate until after purchasing the vehicle."
Tweet it so Elon can share it with all the employees
"Yes! Agreed. The continued updates and improvements have been amazing. I took delivery last December 4 and this past year has been incredibly enjoyable with my LR, AWD. It still feels like a brand new car every time I drive it."
"That’s what I love about Tesla, you can have an improvement made to your car, for free. And the gimmicks cost £0 so they’re actually worth it"
"Absolutely brilliant. I know all of the folks at Tesla work their butts off for us. 

You all are killing it!"
"Hear hear! We tend to focus on the negative and not enough of the positive. The amount of updates and quality of them this year has been super impressive, and I’ve only been an owner since June. Good stuff, 2020 will only get better."
"The car you bought was excellent on Day 1, and a year later, it is even better car than the Day 1 car. That's unprecedented."
Hardware engineer: AM I A JO.. (Dragged away)
"It still boggles my mind that you can buy a car, maybe expect a paid Navigation update here and there, but basically, the is what it is when you buy it....

....and then here's Tesla adding features like Smart Summon, 5% power boost, and one pedal driving.  I couldn't care less about the added entertainment stuff, but the new car features coming *after* the sale is amazing.

A Software Update almost feels like Christmas."
As an employee of Tesla (not an engineer) I agree whole heatedly. My girlfriend owns a model 3 for almost 2 months and even in this short period it's been incredible. They work super hard on an amazing product.
"My car gets updates more often then my phone now. And they aren’t gimmick updates with half baked features and bugs, it’s software optimization and improvements while also adding fun games/apps. 

Imo Tesla is the best software maker rn"
I've yet to get into the EV game but I have to say that Tesla's software is a major draw compared to the other options in the market!
I love it - hope you tweet it to Elon

"My car is better and faster than when I bought it, and all I had to do was connect it to WiFi twice. 

Cheers, Elon."
"As a software engineer myself, I find myself wondering how many times A DAY the software engineers say ""fuckin Elon"".  They have some of the best engineers in the world, but I would never want to work for Tesla.  I enjoy sleep and time away from work."

No love for the QA team?
For the most part. Us Model X owners not so much.
I smile every time I see an orange cone 🙂
Please consider lending your talents to Boeing.
They are greatly under appreciated!
:D
Take a look [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vdCt-toHxtSxGqNgOu9Fngl1-01DfnZn-RklDj_IdHc)  at all the impressive features they’ve added.
"Also to Elon Musk, who worked for a small paycheck, his bonus doesn't kick in until the stock is $600+, so he has been working hard with very little pay"
"Investors know Tesla isn’t a car company, they’re a software company. 

Their self driving tech offers consumers some of the most advanced computer technology available, and it’s actually very useful/practical."
"To the engineers at Tesla, Thank you for breaking my browser, reducing my range, disabling regen at 60*F, and cutting supercharging rates in half.


Signed,

Every <2017 owner"
"I’ll probably get downvoted to oblivion for this, but feel the need to share. I’ve been stuck on 9.0 since roughly a year ago and finally found a stable connection to upgrade on (my apartment parking spot does not have cell service / WiFi and the upgrade seemed to need WiFi).

I recently upgraded to 10.1 and while there are numerous “cool” upgrades (Netflix, better traffic visualization, Spotify), I’ve found that the same core AP issues exist.

Primarily, I still have phantom braking issues every ~500 miles. NOA still doesn’t work well enough for me to feel safe using it. ~10% of lane changes are aborted. The car still seeks the middle of a wide lane after on-ramps rather than keeping to the lane divider like a normal driver.

I get that all of these features are cool, and I love impressing friends and family with gimmicks like the “fireplace mode”.  I’m also a software developer and fully realize you can’t just re-task the fireplace mode devs to make AP fixes. 

I love this car, but can’t imagine I’m the only one disappointed with this year’s progress on self-driving."
Now please Tesla let me downgrade from .40 because it sucks :(
FSD when
I wonder how thankful all the Tesla customers who got into accidents on autopilot are...
Can you imagine what it's like that the car companies trying to become software companies? Most of them can't even keep the radio from freezing up when you change inputs. Now they're trying to program an entire integrated car system.
"I got mine the same day! It's been an awesome ride, hard to explain to folks who don't have a Tesla."
Great idea 👍

"I was in your position at one point. Quit your job and find work for non-sociopaths, unless you enjoy the masochism."
"Are you saying you're old? :)

You're not. I turned 40 this year. I have 3 yound kids under the age of 8, I live my life through them. They love our Model X. They'll love our Model 3 when it arrives in March 2020. It's all good :)"
Mind sharing what was added that you like the most?

"I appreciate every Tesla employee. They are pretty much on the ground floor of something special, and they work tirelessly to deliver on the company's vision. Thank you all. As Elon says, there are much easier places to work, but thank you all for choosing the mission as the reason you are motivated to be awesome."

The owners are the QA Team lol
They have QA team? I thought that Musk relegated QA team responsibilities to Tesla customers.
Digital Media QA team deserve some love too for tesla.com
"lol as someone who also works for another big 3 defense contractor...just no. i hope all the talent stays at elon's companies to push our companies to become better if they want to compete

i also plan to work at tesla one day once i gain a little more experience in the role i want to pursue haha"
I don’t follow. My 2015 S is the best car I’ve ever driven. References for these issues?
Sounds like the fate of a two year old cell phone.
"Looool I'm surprised I had to scroll so far to find this. 

With every update my car makes becomes worse and worse. Thank you for taking 30 miles of range overnight."
"You missed nerfing autopilot several times. 

I currently have another patch it wants to install that'll even make it dangerous, thank EU for that one though. The previous nerfs were all due to Tesla"
"I’m surprised you have had issues updating. I have received SW updates over LTE. Anyway, latest SW will tell you to connect to wifi if there is an update queued. Lane switch aborting and ghost braking issue seem resolved, have not seen either of these bugs in 1000+ miles. Make sure you are on 2019.40.2.1+. The service center can help u get up-to-date."
You're a software dev without wifi and you didn't figure out how to let your car update???
"I'm disappointed that you couldn't find a Starbucks or any other random WiFi to connect it to. Oh, and let's not forget about connecting to your phone's hotspot to download the update....

That being said, if you couldn't figure any of that out, I personally wouldn't trust your assessment of AP improvements, negative or otherwise."
"All two of them?

There are thousands of accidents daily. Most of them don't make the news. Only Tesla accidents are widely reported. Autopilot is safer than human driving and statistics back this up."
Who shit in your Cheerios?
"Probably like the issues Tesla is experiencing becoming an auto manufacturer?

Quality Control, Supply Chain Management etc is all very hard."
Like VW right now. There’s reports of like 100.000 finished cars in lots without the software stack and without OTA. They will need to be patched 1by1 via a laptop to get OTA running
True. Remote management app does not work even on *new* Nissan Leafs.
"My first software engineering job working at Delphi’s Student Lab and many of the projects I had to do involved just making tools to upload and download to radios. This was 2008-2010, so maybe it’s different (let’s be real, though).  Even though everything was CAN, nothing worked the same. Hell, half the time they couldn’t even give me documentation on how to interact with the things. 


(Delphi makes many of the radios, ecus, and other controllers for other car makers) (they also hire students from Purdue University to make a lot of their tools without much supervision.  I wouldn’t touch the code I wrote back then with a 10-foot pole, but it was a great experience)"
Other manufactures take months to release a gimmick update and for every feature they add 2 of them break.
Same here. Same day :) Absolutely adore my car and I have never been a car guy before. This car brings me joy every day!
"I'm ping-ponging on HW3, FWIW. It's not isolated."
Ping-ponging = the car swerving a little side-to-side in the lane?
It's on 2.0 as well.
"That would be nice. It isn't too bad but I've noticed.  My other gripe is that while I appreciate the faster acceleration out of a stop, the adaptive cruise still is way too responsive to the car in front. I feel like I'm feeling every little bump the car in front of my encounters. On hills it is like being in the last car on a roller coaster, braking before the bottom and accelerating at the crests."
"Yeah, life's too short for that crap"
"Sentry mode, Streaming video, better internet browser, AP improvements, hold mode, beach buggy/all games, smart summon, efficiency boost, power boost.

Tons of stuff!"
Are you asking me a question? I'll see if I can answer.
"Go to the Tesla motors club forums. There's a 300+ reply thread about Tesla confirming they cut super charging rates in half once your DC charging counter reaches 200. Also, the browser stopped working in v10 for MCU 1, and one user was told by a tech that Tesla is no longer supporting it. Check out the AP1 life after 2018 update post.

https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/ap1-only-please-life-after-2018-50-6.148169/"
"That’s super interesting. 

I haven’t had the abrupt phantom braking issue but I keep having the issue where the car potentially sees a large vehicle (semi, etc) in an adjacent lane and while it doesn’t slam on the brakes, it does reduce speed aggressively to avoid a non-eminent collision."
"I was out of the country and didn’t prioritize an upgrade - see my other reply, I realize that’s a non-conventional approach and probably should have made that clearer.

I was explaining why I’m in the rare situation where I see a YoY software update and get to assess it against the year’s prior version. I’m not knocking the engineers or otherwise, I’d just like to have a candid discussion on the improvements made and maybe realize the improvements I have been missing."
"Fair points - I didn’t prioritize the upgrade as I was out of the country for most of the year, and you can’t (at least on 9.0) use WiFi with a landing page like Starbucks has. I did eventually upgrade using the mobile hotspot.  My anecdote wasn’t meant to be about the upgrade process, but rather about AP improvements.

I’d be interested in your view of AP over the last year, and why I’m wrong in my assessment that it hasn’t markedly improved."
">That being said, if you couldn't figure any of that out, I personally wouldn't trust your assessment of AP improvements, negative or otherwise.

Someone's opinion is void if they do not prioritize finding a way to update up to your standards? I am going to bet that if his opinion was that it improved a ton and is amazing now you would not be saying this."
You mean when the Tesla is compared to all cars on all roads? And when a Tesla crashes it's conveniently not on autopilot and it's the drivers fault.
"For all the criticism people give Tesla for their growing pains, it’s actually quite amazing what they were able to do as a company with incredibly rapid growth in such a short amount of time. Not only did they ramp up Model 3, but they got working prototypes for the Semi, Y, roadster 2 and now cyber truck. They’ve continued working on improvements to solar panels, battery technology and production, sentry, AI, other software, free power boosts, mobile service, super charger expansion and more. I feel like we don’t give Tesla enough credit for all the things they do that make a Tesla special. Elon has extremely high demands and extremely fast deadlines that he sometimes doesn’t meet. Unfortunately this becomes what some remember the most, as opposed to what’s actually happening. For example, we may not get the robo taxis in a year like Elon said might be possible, but guys... it’s freaking robo taxis! If he had just said 3-5 years it still would be incredible."
"I agree, but TBH I feel like auto maker going tech is harder than tech going auto maker. Auto is very established, there's a blueprint and you can go from there . Tech in constantly evolving, requires a mindset to even compete in. Tech mindset towards autos will build great autos. Auto mindset towards tech will build shit tech."
"Actually not like that at all, that stuff is hard but no where near hard as making good software."
"Apparently they’re not hard for Tesla, as they are the #1 selling EV company, and #1 in customer satisfaction among all auto companies."
"I think you got an extra zero - wasn’t the announcement 10,000 cars will be manufactured before the software is ready"
">They will need to be patched 1by1 via a laptop to get OTA running

They never said that was the case. They said they intend to manually update the first batch of vehicles, the reasons for which we will probably never know. But there are a lot of reasons why a company would do that."
I’m not. Maybe it’s cause my car needed a recalibration after install.
Yeah
Ok. Still the best car I’ve ever had... guess those issues just aren’t impacting me.
"I'm on HW 2.5, Model X 2018 Model. EAP software (80% FSD) paid for option. I'm still seeing phantom braking. However I don't blame the car per se, it's during really shitty weather where visibility blows.  


On normal highway it's been really food since the 2019.36.x tree of updates. 2019.40.x appear to be iteratively better too. Though it's not fool proof. You should never 'feel safe' enough to get distracted from monitoring the car.

Happy motoring :)"
"Pretty much no matter how you compare it, autopilot is many times safer. For example, to counter your insinuation, even if you compare it the opposite way, namely all Tesla accidents on all roads (autopilot or not) vs. only highway accidents (the least likely type of road to crash on) for non-Teslas, **Tesla still wins**. That's right, even if you reverse your comment and rig the comparison **against** Tesla, it's not enough to make Tesla worse.

Sources:

* https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/operating/osss/highway-repository/Average%20Accidents%20Rates%20Table_2016.pdf page 3, average accident rate for divided controlled access highways not including access ramps 1.08 accidents per million miles.
* https://qz.com/1414132/teslas-first-accident-report-claims-its-four-times-safer-than-the-us-average/ Average rate of Tesla accidents, all road types, regardless of autopilot usage, 1 accident per 1.92 million miles.

And actually the above data *still overstates* Tesla's accident rate because it also includes near-accidents for Tesla whereas it doesn't include near-accidents for non-Teslas.

It's almost unbelievable how much safer Tesla vehicles are. Even if you handicap the comparison several ways against Tesla, the Tesla vehicles are still safer. Let that sink in."
"This right here. I'm sort of neither here nor there on Tesla cars personally (I don't own one and I'm very happy with my F-type), but no one can deny that what Tesla has done as a car startup over the past decade isn't incredible impressive.  
 
They set lofty goals and have had lofty successes. They're the market mover that's forced every other car manufacturer into the 21st century.  No shit they're not going to be as polished of a manufacturer as MB or BMW, to expect that there would be no hiccups is insane, but their hiccups are justified and a small price to pay for what they're doing as a major disrupter in the car industry."
"It's kind of like a ""young kid"" trying to break into the good ol' boy's auto industry club. Politics, sabotage, connections, relationships... A big reason Tesla does so much in house.

Compared to the ""elderly"" auto industry trying to figure out how to work the remote. They are gatekeepers that want everything to stay the same - with a simple goal of making innovation hard for everyone, and keeping barrier to entry as high as possible."
"Thanks. I didn’t realize it was a widely seen issue, haven’t noticed any posts. I’ve had it since a couple of releases back but thought it was related to my winter tire change."
Yet. Once newer hardware is out there you too will start getting the obsoleteness bugged loss of support patches.
"Your data is actually supporting that people who drive Teslas are safer drivers in general, which is to be expected seeing it is an expensive luxury car. You article actually already makes this point,

>Both those statements are misleading, argues Steven Shladover, a research engineer at the University of California, Berkeley. Tesla’s claims were “pretty outrageous” since they do not appear to be based on a statistically valid analysis

This data actually does the opposite of what you want to prove, as it makes their autopilot statistics less meaningful then they already were.

It also ignores that road conditions significantly increase the likelihood of an accident (1.08 overall vs 0.16 wet). Road conditions where you do not enable autopilot, and Tesla specifically tells you not to enable it."
I was getting it just yesterday but actually hadn’t noticed it much before.
"No, I’ll have a new one by then."
"OK, sure, but in any case, whether by virtue of driver or car, Teslas are safer, so for OP to be complaining about Tesla's lack of safety is still just wrong, and is wrong no matter what.

And, by the way, it's not just the driver. Turns out having insane acceleration available instantly on demand is quite helpful for preventing accidents in any situation where you need to move forward fast to avoid a collision. Teslas have this. Other cars don't.

Also, if you want to talk autopilot statistics, Teslas with autopilot are about five times less likely to get into an accident than Teslas without autopilot. The comparison with non-Teslas here is just laughable."
">OK, sure, but in any case, whether by virtue of driver or car, Teslas are safer, so for OP to be complaining about Tesla's lack of safety is still just wrong, and is wrong no matter what.

What? By virtue of the driver of the car means nothing, because that driver would be safer regardless of what he drives. This is why we can not just draw conclusions from any statistics we want.

&#x200B;

> Turns out having insane acceleration available instantly on demand is quite helpful for preventing accidents in any situation where you need to move forward fast to avoid a collision. 

I would love to see statistics on this, because to insurance companies quicker acceleration is a negative thing.

&#x200B;

> Also, if you want to talk autopilot statistics, Teslas with autopilot are about five times less likely to get into an accident than Teslas without autopilot. The comparison with non-Teslas here is just laughable. 

Source? A source with actually statistical meaningful data that proves what you are saying."
"Pay attention. The OP's implied claim was that Teslas are **more dangerous**. Specifically, the OP's implied claim was that there were **lots of autopilot accidents**. Cause was irrelevant to the claim. Your harping on the cause is irrelevant to the OP's point. Reading comprehension goes a long way here.

Source for autopilot numbers: https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport"
"I could not care less about what the OP is saying. I am saying the conclusions you are drawing are incorrect. I do not think there is enough data available to make claims of autopilot being more/less dangerous in a meaningful way.

&#x200B;

>Source for autopilot numbers: [https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport](https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport)

That data does nothing to account for the type of road or conditions. It is about as worthless a data gets for drawing a conclusion."
"OK, then I simply claim that regardless of road or conditions, Tesla's accident rates are lower than average. This alone invalidates OP's point, which may not be what YOU care about, but is what **I** care about."
"That does not disprove his point, his point is that autopilot is not safe.

Using that logic every car on this list is infinitely safer than a Tesla, and anyone who cares about their safety in a vehicle would be stupid not to own one of these.  [https://www.autoblog.com/photos/cars-with-zero-reported-deaths-in-america/](https://www.autoblog.com/photos/cars-with-zero-reported-deaths-in-america/)"
"Oh but it does, because unlike your attempted riposte, there are enough autopilot miles to make a judgment. If autopilot were actually not safe, then regardless of your particular hair-splitting on which accidents can be attributed to autopilot and which ones not, the overall accident rate of Teslas would be increased (because so many miles have been driven on autopilot, that a large number of autopilot accidents would affect the overall accident rate). But the overall accident rate is low, much lower than average.

I admit you need to think in order to reach this conclusion. It can be hard."
">If autopilot were actually not safe, then regardless of your particular hair-splitting on which accidents can be attributed to autopilot and which ones not, the overall accident rate of Teslas would be increased (because so many miles have been driven on autopilot, that a large number of autopilot accidents would affect the overall accident rate).

I find it hard to understand how someone could come to this conclusion using any form of logic. There is no statistical data to prove this point.

&#x200B;

>If autopilot were actually not safe, then regardless of your particular hair-splitting on which accidents can be attributed to autopilot and which ones not, the overall accident rate of Teslas would be increased

So if autopilot were not safe, then the overall accident rate of Tesla would be increased. I assume you are actually referring to the data of autopilot on vs autopilot off? Seeing that Tesla says to use autopilot on divided highways in good conditions that can account for the vast majority of that discrepancy.

Comparing the collision rate of good condition highway driving and all condition driving on all types of roads is pointless to drawing any conclusions along the lines you are. Everyone knows poor conditions, and non-highways vastly increase the collision rate.

&#x200B;

>But the overall accident rate is low, much lower than average.

Your own source disproves much of this, all tesla collision rate is lower than average talk.

That is really funny you say that. Because every point you have made has zero logical statistical bases to conclude."
"We're going in circles. I am actually comparing **Teslas in all road conditions** against **non-Teslas in good road conditions** -- the **EXACT OPPOSITE** of your supposedly ""unfair"" comparison. Even under this comparison -- **unfair to Tesla** -- Tesla's accident rates are much lower.

I personally think Autopilot does reduce fatalities, but for the purposes of this discussion it is not necessary to show that Autopilot reduces fatalities, so I don't know why you keep bringing up this irrelevant straw man. It is simply necessary to show that Autopilot does not increase fatalities.

Let me make it real simple for you. An autopilot accident counts as a Tesla accident. So the number of Tesla accidents, total, is a clear upper bound on the number of autopilot accidents. You don't need statistics for this argument. You need arithmetic. And the number of Tesla accidents, total, is very low, much lower than average."
">I am actually comparing **Teslas in all road conditions** against **non-Teslas in good road conditions** \-- the **EXACT OPPOSITE** of your supposedly ""unfair"" comparison. Even under this comparison -- **unfair to Tesla** \-- Tesla's accident rates are much lower.

Show me this data that shows Teslas in all conditions against non-Teslas in only good road conditions, I have not seen you post that yet. But as previously stated Tesla's overall is going to be much safer than the average car seeing the demographic which buys them. This says nothing about autopilot.

&#x200B;

>It is simply necessary to show that Autopilot does not increase fatalities.

You have yet to post any data to statistically prove that autopilot does not increase fatalities. All the data you have posted is so fundamentally statistically flawed for comparison it is unusable.

&#x200B;

>You don't need statistics for this argument. You need arithmetic. And the number of Tesla accidents, total, is very low, much lower than average.

You absolutely need statistics, you can not point to autopilot having fewer accidents when the conditions in which accidents occur most autopilot is not supposed to be used.

&#x200B;

I find it hard to take your points in good faith because using any form of logic would dictate controlled statistics being required to prove anything you are saying. Pointing to arithmetic being the actual answer shows such a limited understanding of the world ""I can't even"", I feel like you have to not be serious.

&#x200B;

My whole point is there is not enough data to conclude autopilot is safer or more dangerous than just driving yourself. Any points anyone makes pro or against autopilot is driven solely off of bias and not statistics."
"Aha! So even you state that ""there is not enough data to conclude autopilot is safer or more dangerous than just driving yourself"" (your exact words). This invalidates OP's claim that autopilot is more dangerous."
">So even you state that ""there is not enough data to conclude autopilot is safer or more dangerous than just driving yourself"" (your exact words). This invalidates OP's claim that autopilot is more dangerous.

So because we do not have good enough data to prove something it invalidates all possible outcomes? So by that logic, it also invalidates your belief that autopilot is not more dangerous. Very thought out comment...

How about you tackle my actual comment instead of trying to save face."
"I will let others judge the soundness of our claims (contrary to your insistence, I have addressed your comments, even if you won't accept it). But yes, we both agree that OP's claims of autopilot being more dangerous are, at the very least, unsubstantiated."
"The only proper rebuttal to someone saying autopilot is less safe is that we do not have enough data to conclude anything. It may or may not be less safe. Although looking at the data the difference between autopilot off and autopilot on is surprisingly similar, I would expect the numbers to be further apart.

&#x200B;

> (contrary to your insistence, I have addressed your comments, even if you won't accept it) 

No, you have not, but I doubt you will at this point.

&#x200B;

You need to understand the application of statistics to your argument. Every point you made has been incorrectly applied and incredibly easy to disprove at the core data/source level."
"OK, since you dislike my points, I'm going to start using your own points.

""the difference between autopilot off and autopilot on is surprisingly similar"" <-- your exact words

We also know that Tesla's total accident rate in all road and driving conditions is 1 accident per 1.92 million miles, about half the rate of non-Tesla cars in highway conditions (1.08 accidents per million miles), and about an eighth of the rate of non-Tesla cars in all conditions (3.98 accidents per million miles).

Since autopilot off and autopilot on are ""surprisingly similar"" (your exact words), we know that the accident rate for autopilot is close to the overall Tesla accident rate, which would be 1 accident per 1.92 million miles, about half the rate of non-Tesla cars in highway conditions, and about an eighth of the rate of non-Tesla cars in all conditions.

This is not unsafe! It's much safer than the average car. Now, maybe Tesla cars have better drivers. We can't really control for this variable. But we can certainly conclude that, when used properly by competent drivers, autopilot is safer than the average car."
"For the millionth time, autopilot is used the vast majority of the time on divided highways in good conditions, the least likely situation to be in an accident.

Lets conceptualize for a moment.

I am an owner of a Tesla with autopilot, I read the manual and use it like it is supposed to be used.

1. I am on a divided highway and the road conditions are good. I use autopilot. (lowest accident rate conditions due to divided highway and good conditions)
2. I am not on a divided highway so I drive manually. (Much worse rate for collisions due to not being a divided highway)
3. The road conditions are bad, so I drive manually. (High rate for collisions due to poor road conditions)
4. I am not on a divided highway and the road conditions are bad (Worst rate possible for collisions)

I would expect the difference between good condition divided highway driving and all driving to be more than 1.6x accident rate. Especially seeing that in the best of conditions autopilot is used, so the autopilot off is going to be skewed to not include the best of conditions and always including poor conditions.

&#x200B;

The issue is not how much safer is it than the average vehicle, that is a diversion. To prove autopilot is actually safer you need to determine how much safer it is when on. To do that you need to compare against it's own vehicles in the same conditions. And even then it only proves it in those conditions. To compare to other vehicles takes a lot of statistics being controlled for various elements and is very difficult, like I said before that data does not exist."
"I literally included divided highways as a comparison point in the comment to which you are replying, and you completely ignored it. Good day."
"You seem to be unable to grasp the basic fundamentals of statistics. Simply including data from divided highways does nothing it needs to be controlled for many aspects.

Autopilot is only supposed to be used in good conditions on divided highways. Simply looking at divided highways for all vehicles in all conditions is not even close to the same thing.

It has two elements that invalidate it. Firstly all vehicles which as we have seen higher-income older people get into significantly fewer accidents, so including all vehicles will skew that number. Secondly, all road conditions, which as your data showed is significantly more dangerous than good conditions."
"Yes, you can quibble (and you have mightily quibbled) about confounding factors, but at worst those confounding factors simply indicate an inability to draw a firm conclusion. They do not in any way support a firm conclusion that autopilot is unsafe.

We're still going in circles."
">but at worst those confounding factors simply indicate an inability to draw a firm conclusion.

No, it indicates an inability to draw any conclusion at all. Those factors are massive in the accident rate, as your own data showed wet roads were over 7x the accident rate and the difference between all vehicles and Tesla's with all safety features and autopilot off is about 3.8x.

And that is just the obvious low hanging fruit. To say this is ""quibbling"" is to ignore all science and statistics in favor of feelings and bias."
"To be clear, my data has two comparison points: divided highways, and all roads. Road conditions were not part of the comparison.

Your quibbling ignores the big picture. Tesla's accident rates are very low. All we're arguing about is why."
">To be clear, my data has two comparison points: divided highways, and all roads. Road conditions were not part of the comparison.

And this is exactly why the data is not useable. People use autopilot in a **subset** of conditions.

&#x200B;

>Tesla's accident rates are very low. All we're arguing about is why.

The entire topic of the discussion was if autopilot is safer then driving manually. The entire topic is why!

&#x200B;

The reason we are going in circles is that you want to use data incorrectly to draw a conclusion, and you refused to recognize that. I think we are done here.

Tesla very well knows when autopilot is being used in rain/snow/poor conditions and non-divided roads, there is a good reason why they do not release that data. It is because it will show that the vast vast majority of the time autopilot is used in good conditions on divided highways just like the manual says to."
You already admitted that autopilot and non-autopilot accident rates were similar. All your other quibbling is irrelevant to the topic at hand.
"Yes, and I would expect them to be further apart seeing the conditions autopilot is used. You seem to lack the basic understanding of my points, or are deliberately misrepresenting them. Nice."
"Ok, but expectations are not data. The data is at worst inconclusive. Circles."
"Now I know you are not talking in good faith. Your own data disproves your point. Poor conditions have over a 7x incident rate, using autopilot only provides 1.6x more miles driven before an accident.

&#x200B;

I lean back on, by that logic these vehicles are safer then a Tesla and you would be an idiot not to buy one.  [https://www.autoblog.com/photos/cars-with-zero-reported-deaths-in-america/](https://www.autoblog.com/photos/cars-with-zero-reported-deaths-in-america/) 

That logic does not work, just like yours does not."
"You said my data was not usable because it doesn't differentiate for road conditions, and yet you now use my data to differentiate based on road conditions? Who's in bad faith here?

I already addressed your other riposte: small sample size. Learn it."
">You said my data was not usable because it doesn't differentiate for road conditions, and yet you now use my data to differentiate based on road conditions? Who's in bad faith here?

You posted highway incident numbers for all vehicles based on road conditions (all or wet).

The tesla sources never include anything about road conditions, this is the problem.

&#x200B;

Jesus."
"Correct, so where are your numbers pertaining to road conditions coming from?"
You do not remember your own sources?
It's time to give up. That guy is retarded. No wonder he likes autopilot since he seems too stupid to drive by himself anyway.
You just said my sources are invalid!
"I honestly find it mind boggling that someone could know so little about statistics. 

But I remembered the college kids are out of school now. And there is nothing worse then a know it all college student on brake."

"Because people are betting against you and want you to fail (and in Musk case people want him to fail at life), he thinks that they are shorting his stock with no real reason behind it besides that they just don’t like him"
I don’t think it is about the shorting as much as then the public campaigning against the company as a result.

"I see the problem more that , because of this beating on failure , there is now a systematic anti Tesla campaign that jumps on everything and spreads misinformation with intention of making it fail , instead of simply betting on it to fail. 

There’s the difference. Musk feels they never get a fair shot at anything."
"the first part of ur comment I’m not answering cause I think u got confused, I’m not saying the market should only be long, additionally some investors do see some signs and reasons to bet against but there’s a lot if not just as many who flat out don’t like Musk, it’s known, every now and then you hear it, One dude just went bankrupt because he shorted Tesla with clear bias of not liking Musk/Tesla and he hasn’t been the only one.

"The good news is their balance sheet is improving, Q4 will be a knockout, their guiding to be in the black from this point out save for isolated situations (I know take that with a grain of salt) but they've been getting better, margins have been improving, they're sold out of the EU to February (2/3 months of Q1), I'm fairly content with the direction the financials are headed. 

What would make me happy is that Solar Roof V3 actually starts making headway, and Tesla energy starts to grow massively because Tesla has stated that they expect that business to become as big, or bigger than the car business. Lots of opportunities for them to grow, and it'll take them being the captain of their own destiny to do it. Exciting times ahead."

If that didnt work...idk what will.
"Citations please? The general consensus is that short selling helps liquidity, balances the market, and undercovering fraud.

Elon should focus on running the company and less about short sellers, like other ceos."
"If I understand you correctly, you are saying that people value their hate for Musk more than they value their own money. There are also institutional investors who are so rekless with client's money just because they hate the man so much. I highly doubt that."
"There is an overlap between a stock and celebrities interacting with social media. A lot of the short sellers were, I assume, heavily involved in negative press about Tesla. Essentially, they thought they could manipulate the market for profit. I actually know zip about macroeconomics, so if I'm wrong explain why..."
Has some pretty good business ideas on there at times...
He's a legit wacko though. He's drugged up enough to think Bitcoin is a good idea so I'll stick with the winning strategy of doing the opposite of what he says. Almost makes Elon look same in comparison.
"Tesla is unlikely to suffer from liquidity issues without short selling. That’s more of a thing for smaller less well known companies held by only a few people , that probably don’t attract any Shorts anyway because you may not be able to borrow shares. So nope they don’t provide necessary liquidity.

It does not balance the market, many markets operate without a short process, for example cars, houses, land. It would be illegal to sell a car if you had just hired It.

It clearly isn’t  necessary for uncovering fraud. I think your confusing things like regulation, investigative journalism and company analysis with short selling. Clearly if you publish Analysis that states fraud has taken place some people will sell shares and a stock price will fall Without short selling. It does however create a valuable market for a false narrative. It gives value to the spreading of false information, uncertainty fear and doubt. None of this is particularly positive and is economically destructive and does harm to investors."

I thought we were stamping panels not avoiding anti aircraft radar
"Starting at $39,900?!!! 😁"
I love that every single render has the broken windows. As it turns out it was an amazing stroke of luck they broke from a marketing perspective.
The brutalist triangle design of cybertruck would translated pretty nicely to two door vehicles.
It looks like a Lamborghini.
Yes except for the wheels.
Remove the side air inlet since we're not cooling an engine here.
Lamborghini did that already
"Honestly, the Roadster 2.0 is already the single quickest, most responsive, and powerful street legal sports car.  I believe the Bugatti Chiron is still the 'fastest' for top speed though?"
The stainless steel cant be shaped like what the render looks like. It would have to be a stamping process with normal metal
"I'm not sure why people spend so much effort to make a render but don't consider important details that are essential to the design style.  the shapes shown here cannot be folded from sheets of stainless. all shapes on the cybertruck are simple, highly obtuse, and convex because of this basic design constraint. it's not just angular.

as unexciting as it may be, a cyber-roadster would probably just look like a smaller version of the cybertruck. probably halfway between the cybertruck and this:[link](https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lamborghini_countach_lp500_prototype_6-610x458.jpg)

maybe you could shorten the front and rear with a bit of tricky aero managment."
this is just a sports car with a CT headlight and roof.
Elon is not going to live down those window cracks lol
LOL at the windows!
"“mom can we get a Lamborghini“

”we have a Lamborghini at home”

Brought to you by the same team who rendered Lara Croft's original chest.
Cyberpunk as fuck. The presentation-day cracks in the windshield only help the dystopian aesthetic.
The best thing about this is that it can now have the Cybertruck's sliding bed cover as a removable roof
Now I hope we get a cyber s3xy line of cars like this
I want this pretty hard.
"Not a big fan. I prefer Cybertruck to stay Cybertruck, and Roadster to stay Roadster. They both have excellent design aspects but they wouldn't work when crossed with each other."
"Man, I posted like 8 photoshopped Cybertrucks yesterday and it was removed within a few minutes, but this? This is ok?🤔"
"Man, how quickly do you guys forget things? Tesla Roadster 2 is the best damn looking sport car I’ve ever seen in my life and I’ve seen a lot of exotic sport cars. The cybertruck came out and you guys are like: “ooohhhh new toy! It’s the best thing I’ve ever seen”"
No.
Site’s dead.
Kinda looks like a Lamborghini or a 458
I like it except for the front wheel arches
I love the front light(s)....
Needs Gullwing doors!
Looks like a Cadillac Cien... Which was gorgeous
Reminds me of a Ford GT [http://www.mustangandfords.com/news/1501-ford-gt-in-detroit-is-very-real-with-600-plus-hp/photo-21.html](http://www.mustangandfords.com/news/1501-ford-gt-in-detroit-is-very-real-with-600-plus-hp/photo-21.html)
cool NSX
Those headlights make any car look good.
"I don’t really like the Cybertruck design, but I feel this sports car is actually pretty cool. I really just think the Cybertruck needs more curves from an aesthetic point of view."
Yeah that does it for me
Moo.
"I was hoping for a Cybercar Model S render, this is close enough."
"Eh not planar enough, its gotta scream Delorean."
looks like a c8 vette
I want it
"I want them to do a cheap cyber roadster. If they can make the truck for $50k, I think they can do a badass roadster that is half the size for $30k."
"Awesome, looks like a lambo"
Someone please do up a Model S and Model 3 render in Cybertruck style.
"late to the party, but i too am loving the smashed windows meme i’m seeing coming from this.

i wonder, if ofc legally allowed, that Elon can keep this along with that special color model S he has."
That's not Cyber. There are curves. Cyber is all straight.
Are those... rounded wheel arches? Heresy! Kill it with Not A Flamethower!
And to think I thought the best bit about the Cybertruck reveal was that all the fan-renders would stop....
I need broken glass stickers stat
That's awesome
How would the exoskeleton be folded? I can not see how it's possible. Maybe there is an origami master who can explain. I assume tesla already hired the best.
"Too many curves, they're stamping stainless steel they can't do curves, otherwise I would buy if I could."
Damn!
Holy shit O.O
I really like this design.
"Looks awesome, really wouldn't want to be in a collision as a pedestrian though, that thing would chop your legs off!"
10/10 would buy
Anyone see the Charlie Sheen movie The Wraith?  I think he drove this thing!
I don’t think making sports cars heavy is the point. But it’s a cool render.
"While I love this, I feel like we've forgotten what the word ""roadster"" means..."
Would def. buy that for $40k.
"The roadster design already looks amazing. 

 [https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/images/roadster/roadster-social.jpg](https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/images/roadster/roadster-social.jpg) 

People are losing their minds."
If they change those wheels I’m in.
Cyber should be Tesla’s spin-off brand. That would attract so many more customers.
Not boxxy enough.
Name it the Nikola
"Looks cool, but you should be able to make some slight changes and make it build able.  The steel can't be bent into a curve or arc... It's a straight bend in each location.  And the edges won't meet up as smoothly."
Too lambo.
Those windows are 🔥
Why do I love this but think the Cybertruck is trash?
"Looks amazing.  I think ""cyber"" should be an upgrade variant look for all Tesla cars for those who prefer that aesthetic over the  traditional Tesla look"
lamborghini circa 1980...
Looks like a Cadillac XLR.
Maybe Gen 3 Roadster ? Hopefully all next gen models lean towards this
Meh
I’d buy that.
TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!
I like it a lot.
"Ha, even has the broken windows."
That roofline is what ruined the design. If they got rid of it on the cybertruck and made it flat on top it would actually be good
We are NOT stamping panels.
">I thought we were stamping panels not avoiding ~~anti aircraft radar~~ radar guns

Porque no los dos?"
Folding.
"So on the subject of aircraft

Tesla is already strapping rockets to their cars

Flying cars? How practical is an electric jet turbine?

😂 both!
"Unfortunately there are a ton of internal 90 degree angles and that, so it would glow like a torch."
For the version that is going 0-60 in 6s ☺️
"I don't beleive the theories that they broke on purpose, but I do wonder if he was okay with them breaking if they did, knowing it would cause more talk about it either way.

Let's do the demo, whatever happens happens kinda attitude"
"How long until someone sells a shattered window decal for our Models S, 3, and X?  That's an easier mod than the low-poly body..."
"I think more than a stroke of luck it turned out positive because it was Tesla. Ford, BMW, Mercedes and the lot would probably not receive the same marketing boost from the general public if something like this happens. But then again they would never take risks like that either. The good luck probably has a lot to do with it being Elon, because if you attributed the broken glass to Tesla’s lack of quality rather than Elon’s risk taking it would just be shameful and wouldn’t make as big a wave."
This Heckler & Koch levels of marketing here. 👏
I tuned into the live stream after the windows had already broke and thought they were like that just to make the truck look badass.
"Yeah, if the Windows didn’t brake no one would have remembered that part."
I **guarantee you** that clear *broken window* decals will be all the rage for the first month or two after release.
Can't wait to see all the sticker companies that start selling 'broken glass' decals for the CyberTruck
"It has been such a marketing boom that I'm beginning to doubt it was an ""accident""."
"I don’t agree. Elon talking about windows being literally bulletproof then immediately smashing them isn’t a good look, no matter how you spin it."
A more affordable mini hatchback with that design would be righteous.
"Tesla Bronco?

Sorry... Tesla Resistor"
Cyberghini
Looks like a Ferrari Testarossa to me...Teslarossa!
It’s a Huracan without antialiasing.
"An electric car that looks like a Lamborghini is my dream.

Finally a front bumper that doesn't look awful."
"Yeah, this is pretty much a copy of the lamborghini reventón."
I could see a tri wheel design in future.
">wheels

Halo Warthog wheels!"
Could be utilized to cool brakes.
You could use it to run air through 2 large radiators to cool the battery and motors
Those inlets let air into the wheel hub and improve the drag efficiency
Model S Plaid has a wider opening in the front. The side inlet may have some use.
or the batteries
Side inlets can be used for much more than just engine cooling. They can be used for rear brake cooling or for active aero.
Also since you can't origami-fold them into existence
When?
The roadster 2 doesn't exist yet. IF it can do all of the things it claims then it can be those things. Also we haven't gotten power figures yet. The Chiron is the fastest(fast meaning top speed) because it has run that in an instrumented test. Also a supercar needs to do more than just straight line speed to be considered a world beater.
Top speed is quite pointless on sports cars as you can only achieve it on a straight long road made for placing speed records.
"Pretty sure the McLaren Senna beats it for responsiveness, mainly due to it weighing less than a fridge, with a rear wing the size of Texas. Either way, well have to wait.

As for the Chiron being the fastest: as of August this year, it beat the former record holder Koenigsegg Agera RS' 284 moh, with a whopping new figure of 304 mph. Which is insane."
... Whoosh?
Already? The car doesn’t even exist and who knows if it ever will
"You can stamp stainless steel, just not hardened (cold rolled) stainless steel."
"Why do you need a bulletproof roadster? It's about continuing the design language, not necessarily the manufacturing process. More importantly it's for fun!"
"> the shapes shown here cannot be folded from sheets of stainless.

A sports car probably wouldn’t be made of steel."
Doesn't look like anything to me.
I want a whole range of cybercars
Yeah this is more of a what if render. They never would. Doesn’t make sense.
"I'm not money, so CyberRoadster minus paint process, smaller battery and only two motors, agile and 0-60 in 2.5. Here's my $50K."
"I asked the mods the same thing and their response was they’re considering Cybertruck “fan art” reposts and are removing them all... spent days working on a 3-D model of a heavy duty version only to have it only allowed on r/TeslaLounge... a real shame if you ask me, especially when I see posts stay up for days that blatantly break one of the actual rules which is don’t add nonsense to your post to extend the length..."
Well that settles it. Pretty definitive opinion.
Flappy gullwing doors from the Model X.
Does vehicle cost scale with volume?
Um...Tesla is already a luxury brand. 😂
"Was actually thinking it looks more like [the Cadillac Cien concept car](https://pictures.topspeed.com/IMG/jpg/200511/2002-cadillac-cien.jpg) much more so than the XLR, which is the closest thing they ever made to the Cien."
True! That is actually [exactly](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198700591465156608) why the panels look like they do on Cyber Truck
"None of these Cyber vehicles are even remotely close to stealth, there isn't a single radar receiver that wouldn't be able to find this."
Supposedly Roadster 2.0 with the SpaceX package will be able to hop because of the thrusters
">	 How practical is an electric jet turbine?

Biggest issue is the mass of battery means you need lots of lift to carry it. It’s certainly do-able, but it’s gonna be heavy. And that means either big wings, or exotic wing profiles. Again, do-able, but expensive. 

Or you go solar and slow."
"Apparently electric planes are already a thing, just barely. I have a relative who worked for a major airplane company who got to test one. It was a very small plane and could only fly for about 45 mins but hey, it’s something...."
Electric propeller works better. But your energy density is to bad to get very far or make anything big.
I would really be okay with that.
Still faster than my current ICE car
I want it
My Kia Sportage is nearly that fast.
Only in retrospect I think. They looked pretty awkward at the time
"I showed a highlight video to a co worker who hasn't heard of the truck (she found it ugly fyi) and it was on mute. Got to the part where he threw the ball and she goes ""wow that glass is super strong that's awesome"". Without context that was a very successful demo vs people's expectations of traditional glass."
The microfracture theory is likely though. I bet they tested it several times beforehand before it finally gave out on stage.
They did deflect the steel balls though
Agreed.
"If the windows actually shattered and flew all over the place like a normal car window can, that would have been really funny."
"No Elon doesn't enjoy his products misrepresented. There was an audible Oh Shit. They were also confident the second attempt would work. 

But in the video released the next day it is clearly a Shop Vac right next to it. I don't believe it was shot before the reveal. 

As for the f150 tug... Come on. It was a rwd with no payload and the Cyber was going uphill. 

Car companies alter marketing campagins as much as they can. Tesla is no different. 

With that said...I will probably lease the Cyber single motor and keep my modded vw. I love Tesla. Never wanted to pull the trigger on The S or 3. The X is a special car that I do want to have in the future. 

I have worked for McLaren and Tesla. And ad agencies that do all online marketing for dealers. Tesla tried here, just not how they wanted."
"> but I do wonder if he was okay with them breaking if they did,

I imagine they knew it was a risk, but accepted it. I haven't heard a single fan *or critic* say they wouldn't buy it because the windows are merely significantly stronger under a worst case scenario."
They did a pretest of him throwing the metal ball at the windows and they didn't break. Coincidence I think not! #TeslaConspiracy
Was it actually positive though..?
[deleted]
S┴Ǝ˥˥∩q Spɹ∀MʞƆ∀q
I thought their social media page was fake at first because they're so ridiculous. I love it.
I just watched the last few seconds of the live stream and the broken windows had me totally bewildered. Had someone attacked Elon on stage? Had there been an act of vandalism?
Also know as the “Microsoft Marketing and Sales Strategy”
He didn't say the windows were bulletproof. Just the 30x stainless steel doors.
Tubular dude!
Less processing power required.
Pininfarina and lotus and Rimac all have Exotic electrics.
It will be a good long while before Tesla comes out with a CyberRobin... that is pretty much only useful for making your car look like a motorcycle on paper and serves no other purpose. It’s very unstable and makes any bump in the road an absolute nightmare!
Oooo like 3 wheel or 3 spoke?
Or as an internal downforce if vented properly
The rear ones won’t get that hot. Easily done with a little under aero enginerding.
"That is exactly why the Corvette has them, they even went as far to design special wheels which have the inlet feed going into them to feed directly to the calipers."
People tend not to like passive air-cooled designs on EVs. Doesn't do anything during charging.
I think that's the opposite of how that works. You don't roll down your windows to improve the drag efficiency.
74-90 with the countach.
"A near-production variant of the Chiron Super Sport broke the 300 mph barrier a couple of months ago, and was pretty much at the limit of materials. Technically doesn’t count as the world record because they didn’t go back up the same measure mile, because the track they were using has been driven so much in on way that the bias was so strong that it could have ripped the tires off the car, and they weren’t willing to risk a serious crash at 300 mph."
"We don't have production power figures, but Elon did say 10,000 Newtons, which is a shitload."
"Plus we only know the top speed is 250+. Elon wanted to lay the smack down on all gasoline cars. Couple that with Tesla's history of underpromising on specs, and I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla tries to go for the fastest top speed when it's all said and done."
"That 304mph doesn't count.  

1. Wasn't a production car and the interior was stripped.   

2. Non legal tyres.   

3. Was only in 1 direction, this is the main point. If it was on the slightest incline with the slightest tailwind it could give a 40mph advantage."
You can still shape it. Cold rolled steel isn't some super material. You can cut it on a lathe
If you spend enough money you can stamp anything.

"most cars are made of steel. you could easily make a sports car out of steel.  the idea is that the folded stainless would be cheaper to produce. I would definitely prefer a slightly heavier steel 3-motor roadster at $70k than a marginally lighter one at $200k. steel, in terms of strength/weight ratio isn't THAT much better than steel."
I wanted to see it but I don’t see it in your submission history?
All mods are pricks.  Let the votes decide!
"It does with weight, to a degree, which also goes down with a smaller vehicle. Less material to buy in the first place, less material to form into the correct shape. Less batteries for the same range, a smaller motor and inverter for the same performance.

Some costs don't go down, the electronics, self-driving, and some others will be about the same. With battery prices continuing to drop, and if the steel exoskeleton is cheaper to manufacture than stamped aluminum, a cyber roadster designed starting now and announced in 2023 could be surprisingly affordable."
That is closer. The XLR is really the only modern car that comes to mind when I think sharp edges.

https://bimmertips.com/fender-vents-what-is-the-purpose/

>Typically, there are air intake openings in the front of the bumper directing air over the brakes to cool them. This air gets trapped in the wheel arches and creates high pressure resulting in lift over the front wheels reducing traction. Relieving this built up high-pressure system in the wheel arches reduces front axle lift thus increasing safety.

>Trapped air in the wheel arches also creates aerodynamic drag.

Not at the wheels. If that number is at the wheels then it depends on the gear ratios
"The tires needed to allow the Chiron go the speeds it is capable of are $30,000 (the tires for the Veyron were $42k) and the tires specially made for the 305mph test aren't even available yet and no one knows what they'll cost if Bugatti/Michelin decides to make them available. The 30k set of tires are only good for about 2,500 miles before they have to be replaced. And that's just the tires. 

The suspension and handling at those speeds has to be *perfect.* There's a lot more to going 305+mph than just raw engine power, that's actually one of the easiest parts of the equation. Creating 1,000 or more horsepower isn't that difficult anymore but building a car that can *use* all that power is *very* difficult. The slightest vibration or the most minute misalignment means disaster.

There's no way Tesla will reach the top speed record at the current price point. A Koenigsegg or Bugatti's costs are much more than just the powertrain."

"Seriously, I rarely use the brakes in my 3"
That could work. I would have to see the impact on aerodynamics and the effectiveness during charging vs. hard driving. I think with smaller ports it might be worth it overall.
Are we sure that's due to aero and not due to the massive amount of rocks/snow/debris coming off of those tires? I genuinely don't know.
Will be interesting when someone will be able to make tires last. Horsepower has gotten comparatively cheap these days.

Yes but race car.
That is literally how the Model S and X and 3 are built. They all have liquid cooling for battery and motor.
pretty sure it's aero
I mean plenty of people make tires capable of the speeds
">then never buy a Tesla, because they're really heavy and therefore cannot be a sports car.

I'm not saying sports cars can't be heavy. But less weight is always better. Most racing series have minimum weight requirements, not maximum weight. 

>I think you're vastly overestimating the weight difference between a high strength steel car and an aluminum one.

It's still a considerable difference. There is a reason that the industry as a whole has ditched steel in favor of aluminum for many applications. 

>the battery is going to be so heavy 

That's exactly why the body construction matters so much. You already have to deal with a heavy battery so saving weight elsewhere is important.


If cost is a concern, an aluminum unibody with fiberglass panels can be done very cheaply. e.g. Corvettes."
"I’m working on a new heavy duty render based on the real one and that’ll be on r/TeslaLounge whenever I finish it, which may not be for a little while as holidays are pretty busy for me, hopefully sometime in between the 20th and Christmas, though I won’t promise anything...
I really hope they come out with a heavy duty version because I really do need it!"
Probably not but it’s popped up enough times that there are likely people who do.

"VW is smartly targeting the one category Tesla hasn't announced anything for: Small, Mini-esque EVs. It's also the biggest vehicle category in Europe. I wanted a Mini Tesla tbh, but the profit margins on them are slim for Tesla and it makes sense to target SUVs and Trucks first, especially in North America. I reckon the Mini-Tesla will be announced next over the next 4-5 years; and I hope it won't be too late."
Coming from a Region near the Alps with significant snowfall I am 99% certain that ID3 won't be that popular in Switzerland since it currently is RWD only. That sucks in snowy/ icy conditions. I mostly see swiss m3 with AWD.
"Honestly, it seems like VW has done a 180 since the diesel scandal, and is now investing more than any other traditional automakers in EV tech, and even [Elon has voiced support](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1176552859229310976?lang=en).

EDIT: I'm not saying VW is now suddenly a saint of a company, since they literally just got [accused of violating emission standards](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/volkswagen-charges-faking-canadian-emissions-tests-1.5389568) again. But I'm a pragmatist, so even if a fraction of [their promises](https://www.dw.com/en/volkswagen-to-spend-60-billion-on-switch-to-electric-cars/a-51270701) comes true it would mean billions of investments into the EV sector in the form of R&D budget, infrastructure building, talent training, marketing push and consumer education, not to mention millions more EVs on the road.

Additionally even if you swear to be a Tesla customer for life, more competition is good for everyone involved. If Porsche can push Tesla to fast track the release of a higher performance Model S with upgraded design and higher quality interior, it's a win for Tesla fans. If the VW ID.3 can pressure Tesla to make a cool EV hatchback for the European market, it's a win for Tesla fans. If Mercedes jumping into EV makes Elon wanna one up them in [cool cabin tech](https://youtu.be/44myNm8T1Vw?t=51), it's a win for Tesla fans. If Kia [catching up to Auto Pilot](https://youtu.be/v8bqw7qjwus?t=307) can pressure Tesla to be even more innovative in their assist driving tech, then again, it's a win for Tesla fans."
Time for Tesla to have some real competition from the VAG!
Good sport. I like it.

"But one simple thing VW isn’t considering is that the Id.3 looks ‘subprime’, to avoid curse words.
Model 3 is imho a better car.
And I am German."
I agree. Now where can I swap my VW R for a Y?
"Is it just me or did VW just announce an EU-only Chevy Bolt?  I really want to be excited about the ID.x cars, but so far I see ""concepts"" and a compliance car. At least they tried with the Taycan, even if it is wildly overpriced.  I do not see Tesla competition here yet."
This is what capitalism is all about! The consumers will reap the benefits of the competition.
Poppa Elon has lit a fire under the car manufacturers asses lol
VW will probably hide an ICE in their EV to achieve miraculous 500 mile range!
For most people you don't need AWD.  Proper tires or chains will get you through slippery stuff and snow.  AWD is better for performance in the wet and snow in addition to proper tires.  An AWD car is gonna get through the road quicker and easier to anticipate than RWD with the same winter tires.
"I don’t know about the ID3... it seems very pricey at 30,000 euros. Now I was in France... Tesla doesn’t seem to be that known or trusted So maybe it will sell there.

That was the main argument from my dad against Tesla “but the service center is 100 miles away!”... I guess it’s a valid argument."
"A proper electric GTI would have me consider going VW again. God I loved my GTI. 

I was disappointed there’s no hot-hatch Tesla. Maybe one day there will be."
"Clever, in a few months all you'll remember of this ad is a picture of an ID.3 and the ""car of the year"" text. :)"
Can we just take a moment and realize that Volkswagen has done more paid advertising now for Tesla than Tesla has for Tesla?(more than 0) What a timeline.

They only segment that don't seem to have plans for is pickups, but I suspect that will be announced in the next few years as well."
"Elon is all in with the SEXY CARS shindig, so the tiny Tesla would have to fit into the naming convention. Maybe they could name it a Bang."
Have you seen the M3 coupe concept? People are hoping this vehicle could start at $25k but who knows if that could happen
"Would Europeans still like such small cars if not for high fuel prices?

I know parking anything bigger than a tiny car can have its challenges too, just wondering how much electric cars might make Europeans consider bigger cars."
"I assume with ""Mini"" you mean like the smallish hatchback size. The ID3 isn't that small I believe. I mean the rest of what you say is spot on I agree. Maybe the better category name would be ""Golf"" size since that is more what it is."
"It will come with improved battery technology and increased production.

Large cars = large batteries = more range = less battery degredation. 

As per-kWh decrease in price, weight and volume they'll be able comfortable stick them in smaller, economy vehicles."
"Hopefully its a 2 door hatchback with a low roofline. Id be all over a tesla equivilent of a 2 door golf gti. If they follow the design language of s,3,x,y then it would be super clean and sell well among 20 somethings if its around 30k."
"I don't see why people likes those cars, they are quite impractical."
RWD electric is surprisingly good in snow. My RWD Model S P85+ handles better than some 4WD vehicles. It doesn't have the ability to plow through as much snow though.
"AWD is of course better but RWD with great tyres > AWD with shitty tyres. I race in skiing and travel through the alps. I've done 2 seasons with RWD.

Most people in Switzerland don't care too much about AWD. They're more into having a large SUV. The ID3 will do fine anyway."
The top selling cars in Switzerland are the VW Golf and the Skoda Octavia. And they have been the best selling cars for literally decades. Both of them don't have AWD and people managed to drive with them in the snow just fine.
I live in Quebec and my cars were only FWD. Only just recently people are going crazy for AWD because it cost much less than before
"It’s Switzerland, the price difference between rwd and awd is equal to eating out couple of days."
[deleted]
"The ID.4 will be out around the end of next year as well though, and that will have AWD."
"To be fair, a lot of switzerland is not mountainous enough to need a AWD or has that much snow. Even if. usually it gets cleared. And the populace that would look into buying one mainly lives in the flatter part"
"Regardless of whether it’s better or worse more EVs in the market can only be a good thing. 

This subs inability to consider or accept that someone might eventually produce an EV that’s better than a Tesla is exhausting.  All EVs are good EVs."
Canadian cops have bern using RWD Crown Vics for decades. They handle well and work great in the snow with proper rear weight!
"You mostly see TM3s with AWD because for the better part of the year they were the only model (LR or P) delivered in Switzerland. 

And also because in most people's minds, Tesla's still are 80k+ cars. I do a lot of ride sharing in France and most people are surprised that my car ""only"" costs 53k.

VW clearly has an advantage here, as people are used to the brand, and will be more expecting an affordable car from them rather than from Tesla.

Competition is good, but I wonder at what point Tesla will be able to stay out of the marketing fray and keep going on word-of-mouth only."
"That's because Tesla don't sell a model 3 with good range without AWD. BMW have been doing just fine for decades with high power RWD cars and Bavaria has real winters as well. Winter tyres + ABS, TC, ESP = safe and competent car all year round."
"ID3 is coming with AWD later, they're focusing on hitting the price point first."
"I just drove my RWD Tesla over ice and snow on my way to work no problem. A RWD EV =/= RWD ICE at all. Yes, AWD is always better than RWD but only if you assume the same drivetrain. My RWD Model 3 performs just as well as the AWD Subarus I used to swear by for Minnesota winters."
AWD is terrible in snow. All 4 of your wheels now lack traction and will be spinning
"Elon and Herbert Diess seem to be kind of ""friends"", they regularly chat about stuff privately, they mentioned that recently during that German car award show where the model 3 won."
Well if you consider being forced to do something a 180. VW has a culture of cheaters built on lies. They were forced into spending 2 billion in green tech as part of their settlerment and are making the most of it because they don't have a choice.
"Yet released many new diesel models this year, recently got their offices raided, switched high end petrol sport audis to diesel etc etc. Still make 10 million climate killing machines a year.
But yeah let's trust the company that cheated emmisions then cheated on the fix and likely still cheating."
Also they stopped with fossile fuel racing! and only support electric racing from now on. however they will still supply their customer teams with engines for now
"It's like the [We cheer for cloths](https://youtu.be/we-L7w1K5Zo) rant from Seinfeld. VW didn't do the diesel scandal. The people that worked there did. Now they are gone and fresh blood is running the company.  

Edit: So if Elon would somehow become CEO of VW, he would be caught up in a diesel emissions scandal?"
"> I'm not saying VW is now suddenly a saint of a company

I get ya. People trying to argue whether VW has noble, planet-saving intentions are missing the point. VW cares about *survival* and diselgate forced their hand. Those trying to say ""I don't believe VW is suddenly moral"" are trying to say they doubt VW's committment to EVs. I don't doubt VW's committment to surviving and it's obvious they've crunched the numbers and seen that going all-in on EVs is how they survive.

People get too hung up on trying to win the moral argumet at the expense of effecting change. The reason I'm a Tesla fan is because I want to effect positive change and do my part to reduce carbon emissions. That's because they make cars that are just flat-out *desirable*. I've heard from people on this very sub who paid top dollar for a P100D only because of it's balls-to-the-wall power. One guy said he didn't care if it was powered by the tears of clubbed baby seals as long as it went fast and that's why he traded his Mopar power for Tesla. Whatever gets people into EV I'll take it."
"VW is an absolute stain on the auto industry. Aside from all the emissions issues, they’re the lowest quality vehicles you can buy in North America. Can’t speak for their European division, but NA, they’re a shit stain.  It’s been that way for decades, they aren’t going to change any time soon"
Maybe it will be a SEXY VAG Coalition leading the new front of Electrification. ;)
wow... awkward
"Model 3 interior looks unfinished to me. And I bet many people still like their buttons along side the touchscreen.

They'll both do fine."
"imo a sedan almost always is the best looking form factor for a car. but there are reasons why people dont buy them as much here.  
i think the all black ID3 looks ok, the rest is just too goofy."
"Most of VW's cars aren't really great looking, that isn't their selling point.  If you want a fancy car they'll have the Audi e-Tron GT and ID.Vizzion out soon enough though."
"Yeah, they're different vehicles. Only at the bottom will they compete on price. Wide availability of the SR Model 3, which is likely tied to German Gigafactory production, should maintain Tesla's lead for people that are only looking for the best EV at the lowest price."
"Why? I like it. It doesn’t look luxurious, but no Golf ever looked luxurious."
"It eats a huge chunk of the lower model 3 price class. But doesn't directly compete.

It will however eat a big part of the market.

This is when Teslas poor service support, few locations, and American design will make it lose sales."
"First of all, I don’t think Taycan is overpriced. If you are comparing to the Model S, they are in different classes.  

If the ID3 becomes another Bolt is all up to their marketing and how much they are going to push it to the public. If VW really wants it to succeed, it will. At least in Europe.

I am still not sure if VW is doing all of this for show. They just released the next Golf but they were pretty quiet about it so maybe they are really serious about EVs this time. 

We’ll see."
What about the E-Tron massively outselling the Model X in Europe now?
"Sounds weird, an EU Chevy would normally be an Opel, although I think that might not be the case anymore. VW have a lot of EV models coming out from next year and onwards, sounds like a weird time to licence the Bolt."
"I've been to the IAA in Frankfurt where they presented a prototype of ID.3 and others. 

If you value UX of Tesla's interface and also like the specs for the price, the VW will disappoint you.

The infotainment looks like a couple of Amazon Fire tablets strapped to a cheap dashboard. UI is slow, the physical buttons are really bad.

The screens are overheating, hot to touch.

The it's very tiny. No space inside at all in comparison to model 3.

And for the price it does/offers less.

Chinese manufacturers were way ahead. Like it's vice versa now. A cheap VW knock off a quality Chinese brand, which is trying to compete with Tesla.

I really hope it will get better in production model."
Nobody said anything about the id.3 having 500 miles of range. The top range model 3 has as much range as the ID.3 top range.
"> Tesla doesn’t seem to be that known or trusted 

It is well known now, their cars are just massively too expensive."
"never had a car with a mobile service attendant, eh? Could be in  for a treat.

""Some twat knocked my mirror off!""

""Don't worry sir, we have time in our schedule to see you tomorrow.  will you be at work?"""
OTOH I've had two VW Touareg before my Model X and they've been remarkably reliable
Why would anybody do that. It's one of the worst deals they could do.
The Supercharger network is already inferior the CSS. Thats why Tesla is also using CSS in europe. Why should anyone invest in a dead network?
"They can't afford to... It's a moat that is too valuable to be given up cheaply by Tesla. VW would have to mark up their vehicles even further beyond Teslas price point in order to pay the license. Given how quickly charge rates are improving, it makes sense for Tesla to keep a proprietary connector for now... When Tesla decides the advantages(thermal, power density, etc) outweigh the costs of adapter plugs, they can start selling cars with new charge ports, change their superchargers, and give legacy vehicle owners an adapter... I shudder to think of how long it will take EVgo and Electrify America to adopt new, higher powered standards beyond CCS..."
"1. VW is big enough that they create millions of jobs in the U.S., from manufacturing plants to dealerships to supply chain. It would be political suicide, if not downright stupid to ban VW in the U.S, provided they pay the large fine and stop the offending actions. 

2. If you do that, it's likely EU would be banning *all American* companies from selling cars in EU, from Ford to Tesla, or find some obscure reasons to fine them billions."
which SUV or truck from the american big 3 pollutes actually less than the cheating VWs? (none)
No really competition then.
“I bought one car and can now unequivocally confirm that all of the manufacturer’s cars are the worst”
"Tesla, just another get rich quick scheme for Ol' too-much-time-on-his-hands Musky"
No? It's an electric Golf...one of the most popular car on the planet...
Probably couldn’t afford them
What wasn't?
Would love to know why I was downvoted for stating the obvious...
"> 4) Skoda will also have a hatchback coming soon

And here I thought “ID.Vizzion” was a crap name"
i doubt any of those will be on dealer lots like a passat are jetta are. even in 24-36 months.
Add some more ZZs to those names to make them extra edgy! -\_-
"I swear, this is why Tesla has a solid mind-share. The names that these companies are coming up with are so ridiculous. VW's 'ID' thing sounds decent, but they just *HAD* to fuck it up with ZZs - you know, to please *the millennials* or something stupid they believe will help."
"VW and Ford announced a partnership earlier this year that will focus on pickup trucks and self-driving / electric vehicles. 

[Ford and Volkswagen's Truck and EV Tie-Up Is Part of a Major Collaboration](https://www-caranddriver-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.caranddriver.com/news/amp25887079/ford-volkswagen-partnership-trucks-vans/?usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D&amp_js_v=0.1#aoh=15759999214486&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s)"
Don’t forget the Porsche Taycan
"VW doesn't have an IC engine pickup, so I doubt they would spend any resources on an EV pickup. VW is best to stay in the small-to-midsize sedan categories as this is where they really shine and have shined for decades."
So like cybertruck? :D
"They come out with that, I can finally get a 2 door m3 again now that BMW killed their m3 coupe. (comes in 4 door only now)

not the same thing, but I can have fun with people and say I got a brand new m3 coupe ;)"
"Parking is a big deal in Europe. Everything is tight. The streets are tight. Parking is scarce. Public transportation is king. So yes, small Teslas would sell like hotcakes."
probably considering most euros live in cities built when horses and carts were the biggest thing going down the streets.
"its not just fuel price. Its just price. Tesla announced an ""affordable EV"" which cost 50k when it came out. even the 35k version isnt affordable. 

In europe most families only need one big car. pretty much everyone else drives small cars liki polo, coras, gold,etc. Those cars can start NEW at less than half the price of one entry model 3. 

Opel Corsa starts ar 13.2k. 

Now golf is quite more expensive than a corsa or polo, but its also well designed car.

I would argue that the golf is the best designed line ever. Its small, but still more practical than most sedans. has great leg and head room. its affordable. I know easily 20 people who has owend a golf at one point or another. I have probably driven more than 10 golfs of friends and family by myself."
"they are the most practical. A Golf has a big trunk, lots of leg and head room, and is small enough to drive through a city and on a parking slot. For just driving, I prefer a tiny car over something big."
"That has very very little to do with ICE vs. Electric, but rather your tires. Yes, the TC of Tesla is very precise, but it can't overcome physical limits set by the tires."
I disagree... My model 3 RWD with snow tires is a bit disappointing.  It struggles going up hills with even the little bit of snow/sleet.     Wish I could have gotten the AWD but wasn't available at the time.
[deleted]
"That is because you don't have all the weight in the front like in a ICE car. 

So RWD in EV's don't really apply to the same rules."
Yeah but for many people... RWD is a stigma/fear. Doesn’t really matter if it performs well or not. They see “RWD” they pass
[deleted]
"TL:DR tires and stuff due play in part but reaction of well designed eletronic ""motors"" and their motor control is a wast difference tires and such being equalized. Hopefully everyone gets good on using this advantage atleast for safety.

I'd just like to chime in here people don't seem to get that Tesla's electric rotors and their control in particular is very different due to reaction times on engine control. For IT people the analogy is spinning disk like HDD and CD'er vs a modern solid-state disk chip. It makes a huge difference - the cybertruck with actice height adjustment, weight as any electric and motor control should make miracles compared to any truck with same rims and tires and good suspension. If not I hope this fix it in post with updates as I sincerely for you truck guys out there hope they know how to do good suspension. Rest is software."
Umm there are AWD Variants of both cars. The Golfs you see around Switzerland are often AWD. Plus FWD in a front Engine car is not that bad in Winter. And also Subarus are very popular in Switzerland because they are known for their great AWD System
Golf R has AWD. And the Octavia is also available as AWD if you choose the combi with the 2.0 TDI or 2.0 TFSI engine.
"AWD is a huge benefit over any 2WD *in an ICE vehicle*. Here in MN I've seen people say ""I need an AWD Tesla because I once had a RWD Crown Vic and it was terrible in snow."" It's a completely false comparison."
"I am not sure the people who say RWD is better ever drove RWD in the snow, because anybody who has beg to differ."
"I've had both a RWD and an AWD Tesla.  The AWD is amazingly more surefooted in all conditions.  Not that the RWD isn't pretty good. 
 The AWD is just crazy good."
That unfortunately is very very true...
Except there will be an AWD variant
An AWD Space Vizzion with a little more ground clearance would be awesome.
"It's also one other thing. The only RWD model 3 sold in Switzerland is the standard range.

So lots of people are buying the ER version which also happens to come with AWD."
Is that why BMW has developed X-Drive?
Not sure if trolling.
My 99 Subaru Forester with AWD laughs in your face as it handles snow in all seasons with ease
Be honest. Have you ever driven an AWD Vehicle in snow?
"That is a total misconception. Two CEO's being kind to each other on stage means nothing.

If you want to read something in to it, i would say it's ""keep the door open"" kind of relationship.Who knows, may VW need some help with batteries, electric motors or something soon?

Maybe Tesla needs some traditional Car parts for it's factory in Germany?

That is all there is, just business as usual."
Really? Because to me it seemed like they were both reluctant to admit they were friends when asked by the presenter on stage.
Anyone else sniff a pending merger?
"> They were forced into spending 2 billion in green tech as part of their settlerment and are making the most of it because they don't have a choice.

Volkswagen promised [$60 billion](https://www.dw.com/en/volkswagen-to-spend-60-billion-on-switch-to-electric-cars/a-51270701) in EV investment, 30 times more than what they were *required* to."
"While they were forced into it, they did have a large shakeup of the leadership of the company since so many people were arrested over the diesel scandal. So at this point I think the folks running the company are legitimately into EVs and know not to screw up again on that scale."
The whole company is based on lies and screwing over customers. I recommend watching the documentary “history of a scandal” (Geschichte eines Skandals).
Oh my God! The company built by Hitler has poor morales? Color me surprised!
"> Still make 10 million climate killing machines a year. 

Since it's literally impossible to transition the entire global auto industry to 100% EV overnight or even over 10 years, I'm not sure what's the point of this holier-than-thou attitude, other than to making Tesla and EV fans look more obnoxious to the average consumers."
"To be clear they were not cheating on CO2 emissions numbers, only NOx emissions. Diesel vehicles still emit a lot less CO2 than gasoline vehicles and that matters far more overall to the climate."
And yes we can all voice support for their change but it's not happened yet so no gold star.
Climate killing machines? Lmao you have no idea what you are talking about. Modern Diesels emit way less CO2 than modern gasoline cars.
VW and it's subsidiaries did not stop fossil fuel racing.
Serious lol. Their current ceo just got raided by the police.
"We  don't know if they're ""gone"". We don't even know who exactly ""they"" were and who exactly was involved. Heads didn't just roll at VW , but Audi and  Porsche as well just to name two prestigious car manufacturers out of Germany. Job positions and people were renamed and shuffled. 

They managed this really really well. Certain cities do not allow diesels any longer except of course you sold your old one for a fraction of its actual worth 2 months before the rule set and bought the perfectly released new Diesel standards from any manufacturer who all of a sudden had no problem with meeting regulations.

You need to realize, the Car Lobby is one of the most powerful in Germany and while they do compete among each other, when it comes to politics and selling their technology without needing to vastly change their production, they team up. Regularly. 

Sorry for the tinfoil hat, but coming out of Stuttgart where Porsche and Mercs are produced, you can't help but know a few employees from both companies and they all tell you the same."
Their office was raided less than a week ago
"For all those saying Volkswagen was raided a week ago, yes, and it was an internal complaint that made that happen. While it may be uncovered that some people made decisions similar to the last time this happened, the report came from inside this time. Culture is hopefully changing."
"They are still actively fighting the dieselgate allegations in many markets. It isn't history about other execs, it is still happening to a degree"
Europe is also more aggressive environmentally speaking. VW embracing EV tech is smart on multiple levels. It's the future of transportation and IMO they're smart enough to see that and get ahead of the game. As consumers we all benefit. More choices and it'll drive costs down.
One can only hope the Germans use this in their marketing.
Spend some time in it and every other car you step into will feel way too busy. I find it therapeutic to just sit in my Model 3...
"Hm, I think the Golf was always rather charming. All in all, I guess I am just pissed. VW screwed over their customers and the German people and especially the brand of German Engineering. I don’t really see them having remorse (only if they are forced to)."
"The ""American design"" isn't a huge problem for Europe, since it isn't really that ""American"", it is recognisable, but not that different.

However, don't think that the ID3 won't eat a lot of low end M3 sales, I know several people who were looking at an M3, and will now be getting an ID3, including friends who went to the Frankfurt motor show \_just\_ to sit in it to see if it was what they wanted or not."
"Not ""overpriced"", but ""priced over"" 99.5% of car buyers. ie, not a game changer like a good ID.3 might be."
Correct. There is zero connection between VW and GM.
Yeah there is/was a Opel/Vauxhall version of the Bolt.
"> The it's very tiny. No space inside at all in comparison to model 3.

https://insideevs.com/news/375715/volkswagen-id-3-banana-box/"
"$40,000 for a model 3 is not massively expensive."
"Get rich quick... 15 years of no profit because of heavy investment into energy technology and manufacturing infrastructure, that's sounds more like a get rich 20 years down the line company."
the ID3 is not the eGolf. And I do think the eGolf looks much better than the ID3. Not that the ID3 is ugly. Its just not as good looking than other VW cars.
I thought they had an e golf costs about the same as a model 3 and goes 100 miles
"it would only take VW the net earnings of around 1.5 years to buy more than 50% of Tesla, VW is much bigger and more profitable than people here like to admit."
they definitely have the money. Diess was talking about that recently. They just think Tesla currently is too expensive.
It wasn’t easy.
"I really hope VW sorts out their naming.  The Skoda hatch is rumored to be called the ""Felicia E"", but I haven't seen anything official on that."
"""Cybertruck"""
All the double-z names are the concept car names. The production models will have other names.
"As bad as ""Skoda"" is, it's still better than all those double Z names."
Oil prices will eventually crush on the next decade. Electrification of vehicles seems to be inevitable.
"Yeah, I bet VW is investing billions and billions in developing these vehicles just for shits and giggles.  I mean, its not like they are [already producing the ID.3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEgPh2Dc1ag) or anything."
They're concept car names. Concept cars frequently have very different names than the actual production models.
Chill. They are just names for the concept cars. The production version will have different names
"Keep in mind, the only vehicle actually released under the ID brand so far is the ID.3, which was originally rumored to be called the ID. Neo.  VW might move to a less ""retarded"" naming convention than the ZZ thing."
"They do have the Amarok as an ICE-Pickup, which ranked #16 on worldwide Pickup-sales in 2018"
Really? Amarok rings any bells?
"They needed a ""C"" from somewhere"
"Tesla model 3 is top selling car in the Netherlands and it's pretty big in comparison to a lot of the cars here

only concern with small cars is safety"
"Can confirm - recently traveled to the UK for the first time and was absolutely floored by the narrowness of streets & lack of parking. The roundabouts and wrong side of road were manageable, but the 2 way streets that remain 2 way in a one lane width for a stretch were downright scary tight. 

We had a Nissan Juke, which feels tiny in the US. It felt like a boat, I would have gotten something smaller (or just used public transit entirely) if not for the fact that we were carting around an elderly mother in law & a bunch of luggage."
"We have the renault ZOE, the VW eUP!, the Astra e, Peugeot 206e and many more coming. Which is enough."
"I moved from driving a small car to a much larger car. Biggest regret ever. Much harder to park, especially if the car doesn't have a camera in the back and much harder to navigate through tight roads."
I live in a city and my mondeo looks more practical than a tiny car like a smart or a mini.
"> That has very very little to do with ICE vs. Electric

could the weight distribution be a factor? I assume ICE weight is mostly in front, so less weight on RWD. Whereas EV more evenly distributed (or maybe more weight in back since the motor is in the back for RWD)."
"Precisely.

One of the best snow vehicles I ever had was a NA Miata on narrow blizzak tires.

Near 50/50 weight distribution, and if you wanted to get dirty sideways at ever turn it was a throttle flick away ( a big flick they make no power)."
I never said that is has anything to do with ICE vs. Electric. It is just a fact that Swiss People prefer AWD cars. When I drive through the winter in Switzerland I was always glad to have AWD. Haven't tried with my P3D yet but that will come this winter.
"Sure, but by that argument RWD vs AWD doesn't make a big difference either."
"TC is more critical than you portray.  And the 50-50 weight distribution helps as well.  On identical tires, a Tesla will far outperform a gas car."
"Well true, but the grip a BMW i3 gets e.g. in the wet with those super skinny tires is shocking. In a good way.  
Precise TC is worth a lot."
"That is not completely true, an EV has a much lower second moment of inertia for its rotating components (its tires), meaning that input from the elektromotor gets near immediate response on the wheels, thus making the traction control much much more efficient.

Weight helps as well, the dont underestimate the better TC!"
"No, traction controll is king. I use 33 inch (84cm) mud tires on my jeep but i know that those tires are only good when they apply work. If they spin out im fucked in mud/snow because i lose power. I would need deffirential lockers or some expensive traction controll to actually push my tires too their limits. But the tesla has near instant response to slip so work is always being applied which means you are always using your tires too their slip limit. If i mount those 33in mud tires on a model 3 its going to kick my jeeps ass in everything."

What tires are you using?
"Have you tried using slipstart? I haven’t faced any hills yet since putting winter tires on my RWD. Even in my AWD Subaru, I needed to disable traction control so I can traverse various hills in my old neighborhood."
Traction is only one part of the equation. Consider stopping. Your traction limited RWD might very well save you from something expensive / dangerous that an AWD car might get you into.
I'll take a good set of snow tires over 4WD any day.
I was one of those. I wasn't ever going to drive my car in winter. It handles better than what I would've been driving.
"I've driven some awful American pickup awds with worse handling in snow than either rwd or fwd European cars. So not literally zero i can assure you.

Traction control, ABS and we'll managed weight distribution can easily do more for handling than just an old fwd system.

If both cars have all the features then of course fwd will be better than just 2wd."
[deleted]
"As someone who lives in the Mittelland, I only get snow a few times a year and it doesn't stick around so having FWD or RWD isn't a problem. I believe that the majority of the Swiss population is in the same club so I wouldn't be surprised if a FWD Golf was the most popular car here. For those who aren't aware, Swiss major cities(sorry Lugano) are built with farmland north of the Alps and the climate is just like non-mountainous Germany/France.

Edit: Golf is apparently FWD, not RWD. I guess it shows that I haven't owned a car here in years."
"I have. Drive at a reasonable speed and it doesn't matter.

Because the AWD vehicle doesn't have a better grip around corners nor does it stop faster. So that speed should be the same for both cars."
"All premium German makers have had AWD systems on offer across the range since Audi pushed the concept into the market in the late 80es. Of course there's demand for it, but the vast majority of cars sold in Switzerland, Austria and Germany are not AWD. 

Also think it's not an issue for the long term sales success for the VAG offerings. If really required it's pretty easy to add a couple of extra motors to an EV. 

Looking at Tesla sales mostly being AWD in EU and concluding that is an essential feature is IMO wrong.  It's the range that matters, not the number of driven wheels."
"Yeah, anybody at that level of business is regularly reaching out and chatting with dozens of industry leaders on a regular basis. Doesn't mean that they're actually real friends, it's just important for them to keep a large network.

That said, of course sometimes you can become friends with these people over time, but odds are they just chat for business reasons."
Lots of the switches and buttons on the Tesla are straight off a Mercedes or Infiniti.
"Im pretty sure one of them even said something like ""its not like we meet frequently"""
No
A pending merger? U Sure About Dat?
"Probably no need. There is plenty of market share if all the world's vehicles are to be converted to electric. VW is needed as much as Tesla in this stage of the game. Predatory capitalism wont help, more effective for human survival is symbiotic cooperation. I'm hoping VW and Tesla can show the way in that regard."
"They don't have much choice, as others have stated too... Change, or perish. It is all driven by this business motive, no noble mission here. Only Tesla wanted to bring a positive change - they did it against all odds and at a time when not many had the risk appetite"
OK. Maybe they can do finances and figured that would be the amount needed to fully make a change to full EV production. They are doing that because they were forced to spend 2 billion and realize this a a change that will happen anyways so why not get some PR points.

[""Dirty Money"" on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80149533) has a great episode on the VW diesel scandal.  It's really quite horrifying how blatant and systemic it was *and* that VW was not alone at defeating emissions checks, they were just alone in selling these cars in the US. They get away with a lot more in the EU apparently, since EU countries are all supposed to ""trust"" each other.

There are plenty of good engineers at VW, they are just getting screwed by the company culture (which will take a lot to change).

I think this is an advantage to the normal FWD gas car in the winter.
"I think it would be impossible for weight not to be a factor. I often drive a Dodge ram, and in the snow we usually put 200 pounds of sand or salt in the back bed, and just that makes a huge difference in terms of how much the back wheels spin before I can accelerate"

"Id still say traction controll is more important, i have 33in mud tires that can crawl over snow drifts and plow through snow but its lack of traction control fucked me when i road next to a lake and sunk 1 inch ito some weird slimy mud (hardened like concrete when it dried, a real bitch too remove). I kept loosing power too spinning tires and was not able to generate enough pull on all tires at the same time so i spent two hours crawling through mud too get myself unstuck. I dont tempt the mountains in winter tho, washington has the snowiest places on earth, the base of Mt.Rainier can get up too 400 meters of snow anually but 200 meters on avreage."
"It's not that RWD EV is just as good as or ""the same as"" 4WD ICE. It's that I see too often people automatically assuming RWD = ""bad in snow"" and then they go on to cite examples of terrible experiences in *RWD ICE vehicles*. The instant response from EV traction control makes a huge difference. Yes, an AWD EV is better in the snow than a RWD EV because all wheels with power is better than 1/2 the wheels with power. But a RWD EV is not the same as a RWD ICE on many measures."

Also the most popular car definitely is a FWD golf. Because the only golf that isn't FWD is the R model. Everything else (including the GTI and GTD) is FWD.
"I definitely think that Elon sees Herbert Diess as a very strong ally in ""accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy"". Here in Germany, VW gets quite a bit of hate from some politicians for focusing so much on electric vehicles and not instead focusing on fuel cell and bio fuels. A lot of very popular politicians with no knowledge on the matter believe that it's very stupid to focus on electric vehicles. Other companies like Daimler and BMW also do not want to put their whole focus on electric vehicles - but VW, under Herbert Diess, has embraced an ""all electric"" future, exactly as Elon for something like 15 years now."
I think two buisness professionals from competing companies can be real friends. Elon went through hell more than once getting Tesla where it is today. Not many people can relate to the challenges he faced.
Correct.
"No, just a hunch."
"I’m not sure that’s the case... the biggest ICE manufacturers are at no material risks from EVs unless they make the transition themselves. No single EV company, not even Tesla, has enough production capacity or battery supplies or portfolio diversity to satisfy a market that’s 50x the current size of the entire EV market.  

Even if Tesla 5x their sales to 2M cars per year in the next few years it would still not meaningfully threaten a company like Toyota, but it would be a completely different story if VW manages to convert even just 50% of their total sales to EVs. That alone would be 5M EVs per year, from a wide variety of models at more diverse price points. That would be much more disruptive to the whole market than one single premium automaker like Tesla."
"The first words out of my mouth when I heard they were doubling down on EVs was ""Well, they have to if they're going to survive the press over the past couple years."" The only way VW can rebuild their reputation is to distance themselves as far away as possible from who they were. And the only way to eliminate consumer doubt surrounding the emissions of their ICE cars is to do everything they can to stop selling ICE cars."

"They aren't selling the ID.3 in North America at all - they don't need to and it is a lower margin vehicle than their other products.  They will sell a ton of them in Europe where they need to reduce their fleet emissions to comply with new standards.  You'll see them at dealerships all over Europe since they'll be producing at very high volume (the plant they are initially being produced at will have capacity to produce 330k vehicles annually).  However, since the vehicle is on the MEB platform, VW will be able to switch production to other models on the platform quickly in the event demand for other models is higher."

"well, theoretically, the larger the crumple zone, the softer you can make the impact.

I think it’s more to do with the sheer weight of the vehicle. More weight = better traction
"It's definitely a combination of everything.. a rwd open diff low to the ground car with snow tires is still gonna be worse then a 4wd truck with ok all seasons.  

If you have at least some sort of an LSD in the rear then that helps a ton with getting stuck. Narrow tires help a lot too since they effect the weight per sq inch."

"They *have* to make the transition to EVs and so they are definitely at risk. VW is transitioning because it has realised it has to, not because it wants to. Most of the other car-makers are still in various levels of denial. The later they leave it, the more the existential risk (i.e. going bankrupt) grows."
They are eating the high margin products. Auto manufacturers are not huge margin companies. Taking away the high margin vehicles can have a very detrimental effect on the company as a whole. BMW is already feeling the effects.
you're assuming all of those cars are the major profit center.   tesla is eating away at the most profitable segments for vw.
"That is what Walmart used to think of Amazon. While I agree on the battery supply issues, Tesla poses a big threat to performance brands' reputation, their brand lineup (check out how many fewer cars Infiniti makes now), and their future! How many people are buying brand new luxury performance cars from other brands vs. Tesla in the US and Europe? EVs are obviously going to remain more expensive to buy than gas cars for a while, but it is in those segments that Tesla is making a big dent. Even Prince Charles bought a new Model S :)"

"Absolutely. There’s a lot of holier-than-thou attitudes with the release of the Model 3. It’s a damn cool car. But all of a sudden people turn into car “enthusiasts” and hate everything not Tesla.  Also, they turn into “environmentalists” and shit on everyone not driving an EV. 


Then you get people offended when they wave at a fellow Tesla owner and don’t get a wave back. Maybe, just maybe, Tesla has actually made a car worth owning that you do not need to be a pseudo-enthusiast to own and love it."
"Dilute CO2 is tasteless and odorless. Above about 10% concentration (which no vehicle exhaust will ever even approch) it becomes pretty pungent. Try inhaling the gas inside a pop bottle to see what I mean.

The smells produced by large diesel engines are indeed these toxic particulate and NOx emissions. NOx is largely composed of two different gases, one of which is harmless to humans and smells sickly sweet (it gives the sweet flavor to canned whipped cream), and the other is toxic and has a strong unpleasant smell. The rest of the smell from diesel exhausts is from Sulfur compounds and incomplete combustion products. Sulfur can be reduced with higher quality fuel and incomplete combustion can be reduced with more efficient engines and turbochargers."

Škoda made and sold race/track models even behind the Iron Courtain, with the designation RS (and they still do).

"The larger car could have a larger crumple zone, but who would do that? Manufacturers will put as small a zone as they can to get high scores on crash tests. The rest of the vehicle will be used for other functions, eg cabin room.  

Second, what about pedestrians and cyclists? Surely a smaller car with better visibility will avoid them better and, if it hits them, they have smaller chance of ending up under it.

">  theoretically, the larger the crumple zone, the softer you can make the impact

The larger the crumple zone, the more energy you can dissipate

But less weight means less energy to dissipate too so you technically don't need as big of a crumple zone on a smaller car"
"the larger the car, the heavier it is. the more crumble zone you need. the VW Up is small and doesnt weight that much so it also needs less crumble zone to be as safty as a big car."
"Yes it is? It’s a B Segment car, same class as Polo."
"More weight means more inertia, making it harder to turn. By your reasoning, semis would be the best winter vehicle."
"Nah. The guy is talking crap. RWD open diff and FWD open diff on a low car works just fine.

That's what a traction control that uses the breaks is for."
"I disagree. I had a RWD Lexus LS400 with a weight bias heavily skewed towards the front end, and a set of good winter tires meant I drove past several stuck trucks and SUVs, particularly up steep inclines (where meaningful traction isn’t likely to be found at any wheel with all-seasons).

To each their own, but I would much rather have sticky shoes than 4 legs when the ground is slick."
"All BMW cars are pretty much 50/50. Long hoods and front wheels close to the bumper, the majority of the engine is behind the axle."
"I loved watching all the guys who leased their F150s as cheap as possible, so RWD, fishtail all over the road and into the ditch. I'd slowly pass them in my versa with good snow tires on. 

Now I've got a big meaty SUV for winter I actually find it more dangerous as you get a certain level of false safety. AWD doesn't stop any faster."
A FWD EV sucks in snow. (Or at least the Kia SoulEV does) There is so much torque and weight on the front wheels they just sit and spin in the slightest of inclines.
"FWD in snow is garbage; when it goes wrong you understeer, which can only be recovered by slowing or stopping. When RWD goes wrong it oversteers, which you can still actually use to maneuver the vehicle. AWD with snow tires is obviously the best option, but RWD with snow tires is still way ahead of FWD."
i know grip is important but im saying that traction control is what determines if that grip will be used at the right time. if a tesla gets into some snow its not going to waste time slipping its tires. too me its more like traditional trucks having too use bigger stickier tires to compensate for the imperfect traction control. obviously the better tire is the better tire but im also looking at what controls the tire.

Even Tesla said most is their customers came from non-luxury brands.

Let’s look at BMW 3 series, many say it’s suffering due to Model 3, yet it just saw an 90% year over year sale growth this past month in the US, and has been selling extremely well so far this year, despite Model 3’s success."

"> They haven't spent a dime.

Right, because the Audi E-tron, VW ID.3, Porsche Taycan were all funded by hopes and dreams and their engineers/factory workers worked for free on those cars...

The rest of your rambling is just missing the point completely. Tesla didn't get to where they are today overnight. I've been following Tesla since 2008 and even by 2015ish their charging infrastructure wasn't that great, but they kept investing and got to where they are today. 

You can keep being a Tesla fan and that's fine, but if your cynicism pans out, then the world will remain largely ICE cars with Tesla cornering a niche market by itself."

"yea but if they would consider taking over tesla it would not be for the brand or the CEO, it would be for the technology and battery production.

especially the battery production is something VW does not have right now."
Don't think it works that way. You need to dissipate energy over distance to reduce acceleration. And the only energy that counts is the deceleration of your body. Why does hitting a brick wall hurt but hitting foam doesn't even though exactly the same energy is dissipated? It's because the foam does the job slower. That's what a bigger crumple zone gets you.
"ah yes, hadn't thought about that.
car-to-car collisions with heavier vehicles will increase the force on the passengers though.."

You can overcome inertia by slowing down to turn.

"FWD is easier in snow in my experience (and I lived in places where there was a lot of snow during the winter and the roads were not cleaned up promptly). If you lose traction, you actually need to add power to straighten it out and only then carefully slow down. You also want to power through the turns for more stability. 

But there is no substitute for proper winter tires."
"I just wonder. How do you do with snow tires. In most places it snows a few days a year. Temperatures vary widely.

You just swap them every time?"

"I don't have the BMW sales numbers, so will take your word for it. If you just compare the cost of ownership and the performance figures, and add the fast depreciation BMWs have to the mix, I don't know why someone would buy a 3 series over a Model 3. I understand some people don't have places to charge, drive very long distances, etc. Plus, as weird as it may sound, a lot of people in the rural areas and those who are older, don't know much about Teslas, and they see BMW and Audi ads all day...some sales will come from such people. There are people who still believe that any BMW is an Ultimate Driving Machine  ;)

The other statistic you are quoting could be because the pie itself is growing...BMW sales grew by 90% because the car sales maybe grew much more this year vs. last, and maybe they  had poor sales last year.

If BMW thinks that they can go with just gas cars and not worry about Tesla, my best wishes are with them. The reality is that gas cars, regardless of who makes them, cannot compete with EVs in the near future in terms of reliability, running costs, and everyday performance. Even exotic super and hyper cars are going hybrid or electric now.

This is the same argument that people have had before...we need naturally aspirated engines for reliability and linear performance...we need keyboards on our phones...who will buy everything online..."

THAT WOULD HAVE A MORE OF AN IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE AS OPPOSED TO DECADES BEFORE THE EFFECT OF THEIR POLLUTING DIESEL VEHICLES WOULD PRECIPITATE."
"Well yeah I haven't said otherwise

But *how much* energy you need to dissipate depends on the weight of the car: if a car weighs twice as much as another one, if they both impact the same wall at the same speed, one will need to dissipate twice as much energy as the other one (because E = 1/2\*m\*v²)"
"It’s just 1 class difference...

Alright then the VW Up (A Segment, same as Twingo) got 5 stars.

"You know review magazines weigh cars right? Its not a debate if they're 50/50, [the scales don't lie (PDF)](https://hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/bmw330i2019-1567098880.pdf)"
"You have that completely backward. 

With FWD in low or no traction conditions, when the front starts to push mid-turn (understeer), increasing throttle will just spin the front wheels and you will continue straight ahead into the ditch. To regain drive and steering, you need the front wheels to regain traction, which requires reduced throttle. Alternatively, you may occasionally have the front end lose traction in a straight line and start wobbling to one side or the other when you mean to be going straight ahead, which in the case of FWD is best handled by reducing throttle to allow the front tires to regain traction.

Powering through turns with FWD in low or no traction conditions is exactly how you end up understeering into a ditch. 

FWD only seems ""easier"" if the only thing you know to do in the event of a loss of traction is to try to stop entirely. If you actually want to be in control of your vehicle, RWD is far more useful.

"Snow/winter tires are generally good for conditions below 45 deg F, whether there is snow on the ground or not. I usually switch over to my snow tires in November and leave them on until early April."
But im comparing a tesla too a traditional truck. I know that teslas traction capability are not unique too them but its faster at adjusting than a ICE drivetrain.
"Right, so they are selling more *after* the Model 3 came out, but a lot less than before the SUV craze took over the world.

The whole sedan market is falling off a cliff (and has been since 2015 or so), with buyers transition to SUVs. So having a rebound of a sedan model in this climate is nothing short of a miracle."
">I don't have the BMW sales numbers, so will take your word for it.

Sorry, here it is: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191203005999/en/BMW-North-America-Reports-November-2019-U.S.

As you can see, overall 4.5% up compared to last year.

>If you just compare the cost of ownership and the performance figures, and add the fast depreciation BMWs have to the mix, I don't know why someone would buy a 3 series over a Model 3.

1. Cost of ownership for BMW is surprisingly low since maintenance is free and lease deals are much more favorable than Tesla. You can lease a $60k M340i for $550/month, an equivalent Model 3 would cost you $900+.

2. Depreciation on my Model 3 is far worse than any BMWs I've ever owned. My 11 months old, 8k miles AWD Model 3 that I purchased for $60k is now worth $36k according to Tesla. I will never *buy* a new Tesla ever again. 40% depreciation in one year is worse than my iPhone.

3. Plenty of reasons to get a 3-series. Far better cabin tech, creature comfort and interior luxury. Other than Auto Pilot, technology in the new 3-series is far better than what's available in my Model 3 (amazing HUD, optics fiber interior lightning, heated steering wheel, laser headlights, 3D surround view parking, CarPlay, wireless charging, etc), and BMW's AP-like system is actually better than AP at lower than 40mph speed. The Model 3 has a superior powertrain, but the rest of the car it's still a tier below a fully loaded 3-series.

>BMW sales grew by 90% because the car sales maybe grew much more this year vs. last

https://www.marklines.com/en/statistics/flash_sales/salesfig_usa_2019

U.S Auto Sale grew 1.9% year over year, and BMW has outpaced that growth. 

>The reality is that gas cars, regardless of who makes them, cannot compete with EVs in the near future in terms of reliability, running costs, and everyday performance. Even exotic super and hyper cars are going hybrid or electric now.

I don't disagree, EV is the future, but the transition won't get there overnight. But it's all about economics. Can you lease a $60k EV for $600/month like ICE luxury cars? Is there an EV that has similar luxury interior quality as an equivalently priced ICE car yet (the Taycan gets close, but not quiet). 

BMW is investing in EVs, the i4 is coming out next, but their sales numbers have shown that a slow transition seems to be where we are headed."
"Definitely, much cheaper. Filling up that same 100kWh battery here would cost me ~$14."
I bet you that Germany has different prices for private and companies.
"You need to look into what companies in your country are paying for electricity. It's very far from what you're paying at home. In fact prices have gone down due to the Energiewende, as they should have for home owners too but alas."
judging by how many of them are down i dont think maintenance is a line item
">lolwhat? Those are cars, not charging networks necessary to have car sales.

Dude you need help, first you say they are not spending money building EVs, then you say they are not spending money building charging networks, then you say the money they spent doesn't count because they were obliged to. Keep moving that goalpost lol.

>The e-tron is a horrible car that failed miserably.

By failed miserably you mean outselling the Model X and Model X in Europe and big markets like Norway, then sure...

>The only way any of these companies sell any meaningful amount of EVs in the US is if they build a network that is as good or better than tesla's within the next 2 years. If it takes longer, no one is going to buy their cars until that time is closer and if they have no intentions of building a network like that, no one is buying their cars.

So they will just keep buying ICE cars if that's true. Most people don't care about having a Tesla or having EVs in general, they just want a good car they like that fits their need. Tesla with their limited selections and production will not satisfy the whole market demand. 

If you think Tesla is somehow gonna have a monopoly in the auto market because of Superchargers...then I have quite a few vaporware EV startups to sell you..."
7% is the max they will do over their cost.   shareholder calls are filled with people begging them to increase prices or cut wages.  they refuse.
"The point is that you need the same size crumple zone regardless of energy dissipated. You need a different material to crumple at the correct rate to produce the desired deceleration. This different material will absorb more energy, naturally. I mean, all the energy gets dissipated in any collision anyway, it's just a matter of how fast that happens."
"damn what?

what's all the fuss about crumple zones about then? the Up barely has one?"
"Checking the numbers, it looks like the car just barely made 5 stars. 4 starts is not good."

"Well, I have 10 years of Russian winter driving under my belt and 4 years of Southwest Michigan driving FWD without ABS and TCS almost exclusively ;) And reducing throttle in turns and braking was absolutely the worst thing you could do. 

Having said that, I religiously put winter tires every winter. When I lived in Michigan I was shocked to see most drivers using all-season tires. After heavy lake effect snow storms I was pretty much the only one in my neighborhood who could make it to the main road. And I was driving FWD Mazda 3."
"Ehh.

Not really."
"Hmm, thanks for the reply and numbers.

On the cost of ownership of a BMW, not everyone wants to lease a car, and for those who buy, a complementary 3-4 yr service doesn't cut it much (IMO). But leasing is really attractive for these cars that have a low resale value...that is a valid point.

You can't compare the resale value of your Model 3 here - you got $7.5K tax refund + some state incentives (possibly), and Tesla lowered their price...which obviously they cannot keep on doing endlessly. Plus, their appraisal of cars is really crappy and dumb.

You can buy used 5 and 7 series for real cheap too. And an i3 for much much cheaper than any Tesla. Because EVs are considered tech products, their resale is lower than what would have been if that 'tech' perception was taken out of the equation. Also, as with any luxury car, people dont' want to save some thousand bucks and buy used.

The interiors are definitely a matter of taste, but even MBWs and Mercs have leatherette and not real later, and to many/some, these cars' interior design looks really dated. I agree on the missing HUD, Apple Carplay, etc., and even the blinker lights...to me even those are still important.

I think your argument makes BMWs sound really compelling, and maybe that is why many buy/lease them. And many, like me, straight up went for a Tesla without even seeing it and never even had a BMW in their consideration set."
[deleted]
And none of that contradicts what i said.
"Good engineering? Maybe better, dare I say, than Tesla?"
"The Up still has a crumple zone, just that the distance to absorb the energy is very short. But they still managed to get good scores. That just means the car was brilliantly engineered for safety, and it can only get better for the next model generations since the scores are getting stricter by the years.

With EVs, it should be easier for the engineers to build better energy absorbing structures since there’s no engine to “disturb” the structures."
Ain't inertia a b****
The rest of the car. An engine is only 600 or so pounds of a 3500 lb car.
"Like the poster above said, it is pretty well empirically documented that several BMWs have a 50/50 weight distribution.

But to actually answer your question about ‘how’ they do it: BMW’s have very short overhangs, with front and rear axles spread as far apart as possible. Additionally, clever packaging helps centralize the weight. Two of my car’s six cylinders are located under the windshield, very close to the firewall. Heavier auxiliary components such as the water pump are closer to being *under* the block as opposed to hanging off the front somewhere. And finally, BMW often puts the battery and some electrical relays/modules in the trunk (this is significant since a 800 CCA AGM battery can be 80-100lbs).

Anyways, I hope that helps.

EDIT: Out of curiosity I looked it up, and all of Tesla’s current cars actually have less ideal weight distributions in comparison to my E90. The Model X is the best, and comes damn close with 49/51. Totally negligible. The worst is the top-selling Model 3, with 47/53. Still not bad, but not significantly better than most modern cars. The Honda CRV for example has a 43/57 distribution according to Honda.

I think the main conclusion here is that weight distribution probably isn’t that important for inclement weather. I’m sure it helps, but unless you’re driving a long bed with nothing in the bed, I think tires and drive layout are much, much more significant."
"Well, we can definitely agree that braking mid-turn is a no-go; if conditions are such that a full loss of traction is possible, then braking mid-turn has a good chance of locking up the front wheels entirely, so you have ZERO steering control, and if you have FWD you then also have zero drive traction, at which point the car is entirely out of your control.

I was talking about using the throttle to manage steering and drive traction mid-turn in low- or no-traction conditions (i.e. ice). For that, FWD is definitely the worse option because its default failure mode (understeer) combined with the fact that you are using the front wheels for both drive AND steering results in substantially reduced control authority.

With RWD, you can steer the vehicle with the throttle, because the default low- or no-traction failure mode is oversteer. With oversteer, as the back end comes around you can increase throttle input to cancel out some of the vehicle's momentum toward the outside of the turn. This, combined with counter-steer to prevent over-correction toward the inside of the turn, allows you to control the slide while still guiding the car along your chosen path instead of into the ditch.

And yeah, snow tires are a must no matter what."
?
">The interiors are definitely a matter of taste, but even MBWs and Mercs have leatherette and not real later, and to many/some, these cars' interior design looks really dated.

Real leather is an option on both the C-class and 3-series. Also yes, it's a matter of taste, I personally prefer [this](https://images.caricos.com/b/bmw/2020_bmw_3-series_touring/images/2560x1440/2020_bmw_3-series_touring_107_2560x1440.jpg) over my Model 3's interior. The iDrive has a much higher learning curve than Tesla's infotainment, but after you learn it it's easier and faster to operate.

>And many, like me, straight up went for a Tesla without even seeing it and never even had a BMW in their consideration set.

That's totally fine, but that's why I'm saying most of Tesla buyers weren't shopping around anyway, thus them buying Tesla doesn't really hurt BMW's sale that much. Most of my friends who own Model 3 came from non-luxury brands like Nissan or Toyota, and they were never interested in those German luxury brands in the first place.

I've driven both the new 3-series and obviously my own Tesla, and honestly they are both very good cars in different ways. In the end I went with the Model 3 because of HOV lane access and that's worth more than most other things lol."
"> I get you hate tesla with a passion

I hate Tesla with a passion? Do you really just throw out random statements without even thinking? I've been a long investor of TSLA before most people around here have even heard of the company, and I've been driving their cars long before the Model 3 was even a thing, and I now own a Model 3 and my first review of the car was so glowing it got picked up by Insideev lol. If there is anything I hate it's the community sometimes, precisely because of people like you, who give Tesla fans such a bad reputation.

> but no one is buying your crap.

Huh... the number of upvotes of my comments in this thread proves the opposite...

>Targeting only 30% of the world market isn't going to be good for them, they will have to downsize massively.

I don't think you understand how economics work. The reason they aren't investing more in U.S. market is because **EVs aren't as desirable in the U.S. as it's in Europe**, when that changes they will naturally invest more, and before that they will continue to make money selling their ICE cars. You somehow have this weird dellusion that the whole U.S. consumer base will suddenly all want EVs and then all flock to Tesla, when in reality they will go ""Can I buy an EV from VW/Toyota/Honda/whatever with easy charging? No? Here I come ICE car again"". 

Even if what you are saying is true, that Superchargers is all that's stopping a company from taking over the U.S. market, then VW would have no problem spend that money since they would stand to make much more, as long as demand for EVs are there."
it does but you're blind to it.   its ok.   i understand.
"Agreed, although the average driver would be probably safer in FWD than RWD as any attempt to steer with throttle for inexperienced driver would probably end up in a ditch."
"Aside from throttle input which can be preemptively control via drive modes TC is done via brakes to control each wheel independently.

Tesla really doesn't have an advantage here, if they used a wheel hub motor and brake system like a Protean, then you could argue for it. However that's at the expense unsprung weight.

Tesla is still using a 2box booster/abs system."
"Cool! That interior is not bad! BTW, you can get the HOV lane sticker with the 530e too ;)"
Fair enough!
I understand their is lag to slowing down the spinning tire but what about in the case of applying power too the wheel? Is their little diffrence in time when comparing both drive trains?
"Yeah I know, I'm actually recommending that to one of my friends, BMW has it for $460/month lease deal for that car, which is insanely good value.

Personally that car is too large for me and not sporty enough (also the reason I went for a Model 3 over a Model S), but it's a great mid-size luxury car (interior is quiet as hell), especially if you score a good lease deal like that."
So in terms of how fast brakes can react to slow down a tire it's very quick. In a similar fashion both styles of vehicles can apply power almost equally as fast the key difference is an electric motor can produce  nearly all potential torque almost instantaneously.
If i remember correctly dosent the speed of the EM have too be sapped when starting in order not to pulverize the transmission?
"Most BEVs don't have multi speeds transmissions per se, they have a series of gears to get power to the differential.

 However yes power is modulated more often than not to ensure traction."
I just like saying transmission as single speed transmission for teslas but ya i can see why that term is not entirely appropriate but thanks for the info anyways.
"I only called out the multi speed aspect becuase typically BEV transmissions are single speeds and inherently robust. No solenoids, clutch baskets ect."
Didn’t realize the X was so much more popular than the S
"Why not 100%???

Demand problem???

/s"
I’m surprised it’s not like 90% of EVs. I guess the number will only shrink as more and more enter the market.
why are people still buying i3?
"So I live in the Boston area and have been thinking of getting a Tesla in 2020, but I have a couple of questions for existing Tesla Model 3 owners who use it during the winter.

How is the AWD version in the snow and hilly areas?

Also, comments on the claims by some that the interior looks and feels cheap for its price point?

I really want to go full electric, but if I'm spending this kind of money on a car, it should look and feel premium, and I have to have solid AWD capability for the hills in my area during the winter."
"The electric vehicle market is growing at approximately Phi so far.

It's currently 1.8% of the vehicle market share.

If the Phi trend continues, it could be 18% of the vehicle market in 6 years.

I'm honestly less concerned for Tesla's share, but this makes me happy."
"TeSLa iS GoiNG BAnkRuPt...

"This is nice, but stats vs ICE cars are far more interesting to me."

"Interesting, I would guess about 98-99% of electric cars I see are Tesla's, there is one i3 that lives near me that I see occasionally but otherwise I almost never see them, maybe a Volt once in a while. Meanwhile there is a Tesla at every intersection and in every parking lot, I suppose thats because other electric car makers are just recently strengthening but I still find 77% surprising low. A Tesla seems to be the logical purchase for the vast majority of buyers right now"
I am sort of surprised that Tesla didn't have more.
">18,000 model 3s sold in November last year so a pretty big decline year over year. Anyone have a good explanation?"
The most frustrating thing is all these analysts get away with spewing bullshit and getting away with it.  I am never letting that go.
"The sales looked diminishing to me. The production goal of 20000 cars a month is surpassed but the demand is way lower than that, as far as I can see."
They need to make more superchargers
"My next car is going to be electric. I've been following the industry for years and I'm familiar with all of the options on the market today and coming in the next 2 years. I can't figure out why would I buy anything but a Model 3?

People who have bought a non Tesla EV since the Model 3 has been available, what was your reason?"
why is model S so low?
There is no good reason to buy an i3 over a model 3. Zero.
"People still buy the i3? Haha, look at how few e-trons were sold."
Remember when Apple during their keynotes in the early days of the iPhone Steve Jobs would brag about iPhone marketshare? And then a few short years later they weren't talking about marketshare anymore in their keynotes because Android took over? I feel like with all the other automakers taking note of this and rolling out their EVs that it's only a matter of time until the others catch up.
"I don’t know who is buying Leafs. They’re really the ugliest cars. Also, they always hog the chargers at work despite them only having a cell phone battery."

Congrats. You won gold at the Special Olympics!
The S is directly competing against the 3.  The X doesn't have a competitor at the moment.  It will once the Y hits production.
"I see more Model X here than I see Model S.  I like the look of the Model S, but it seems like the price is pretty high compared to the Model 3 and without a lot that you get for that price.  It is a bigger car, is less efficient, but has a nicer interior and two screens. It seems like most people like the value proposition of the Model 3 better.  

However, the Model X has a third row, which a lot of people with kids need.  I wonder if we will see a decrease in the Model X when the Model Y becomes available."
People really like SUVs.

Can’t believe they’re failing so badly :’(
"If they can't make it 110%, the stock is an absolute short."
"Probably because of their horrible customer service and service centers. My wife and I contacted 4 different people with Tesla, a total of 10 times, over a period of 6 weeks. We never got a single response. Only to have the tow truck take the vehicle to the service center, drop off the key with a rep there, but then the vehicle doesn't get logged, the employees don't know they had our vehicle for 3 days, while it was unlocked in Denver, and no one was still able to answer their phone or return voice mails or respond to emails. I had to cancel work to just drive 3hr (one way) to go and physically talk to someone. When I got their, the guy who spoke to me blamed everyone and everything else, including the tow company. (Sorry, it's not the tow company's fault you didn't respond to my calls, voicemails, and emails for 6 weeks.) And then they didn't order the part my vehicle needed for about 10 days. While my Tesla just sat in the lot...locked for part of it.

Come on, Tesla. Surely carrier pigeons and smoke signals can't be more technologically advanced than you.

Look guys, I freaking love Tesla. But their service centers and customer service is simply deplorable. I anticipate their sales to get worse unless they can solve a few basic issues, such as communications, security of customer's vehicles, ordering parts sooner, and taking personal responsibility when they fail.  


Edit: Yes, of course I scheduled the service with the app. I had additional questions I couldn't find online."
"Seriously though, theyre the only relevant EV company. Why isn't it higher?"
Percentage my shrink but market will grow.
I think the market will stay stagnant whereas Tesla will significantly increase sales once the Y comes out. Then Tesla might go to 90% without affecting the sales of others in the market.
"I’ve been leasing an i3 for several years, it’s a very fun car especially for $200 a month with 0 down. That being said, my model 3 is on order ;)

Edit: though as of 2019, I don’t know why anyone would opt into a car with this amount of range."
Cuz I saw one deal last week for $105/mo zero down for the small battery BEV. Insane markdowns trying to sell these turds.
Cost. Used go a lot less
Because some people buy/lease cars based on the badge secured to the front and rear of the car.
"I honestly considered that or the 530e, problem is a 530e is expensive and to get the same trim level as a model 3 would be over $50K, the i3 is butt-ugly and overpriced; even with the $10k discount they are always offering the i3 REx is outdated and needs a tech overhaul.  I ended up with the Model 3 SR+, looks great inside and out, great Ux, fun to drive, and the price is right."
Because it's a good car from a respected manufacturer?
No idea. I’d drive an ICE before you catch me in an i3. They’re hideous.

"New Yorker here and have had my LR AWD Model 3 since early summer so this is my first winter. I drive quite a bit, including a trip to Maine and back recently through a bad snowstorm. No complaints about the AWD, didn’t notice any slipping, and had solid control even when it was a white out on us. I also have to drive up and down a steep driveway in snow and it’s performed very well. 

About the interior. I love it and haven’t noticed it feeling or looking cheap at all. On the contrary everyone who rides in it says it’s the most beautiful car they’ve seen. That said, I’m not that fancy and never had a car this expensive before. I think the solution there is to just go test drive. 

Also, go test drive one! They are stupid fun to drive."
"1. I have the AWD, but I live in AZ and haven't driven it in the snow yet.  That being said, this car feels literally glued to the ground.  I've heard others with RWD in the snow say that it does very well too.
2. Personally I think it's great, but I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  I would take one out for a test drive, but be warned, the cars sell themselves."
I live in Michigan and my AWD 3 does amazing in the snow. It honestly does a lot better than a good portion of trucks or SUVs because of the weight distribution between both wheels instead of only the front.
"I'm near Montreal and with a RWD Sr+, I'm really impressed by the car in the snow/icy road. The AWD must be surreal! The interior is more tech than pure premium but I think it's really comfy and spacious."

Or not everyone can afford a Tesla? Even the model 3 is very expensive to most people. Regardless of it being a breakthrough. We need a 15k electric car
"Nah, the lower that number is the better it is for consumers and the environment. It means that other automakers are competing in the EV space and Tesla's monopoly on EVs is slipping. Long term I hope that number goes down to 10% and we have a healthy, competitive EV market."
"Hey shut up. Don't need your freakonomics here. Going to use a scatterplot next time.

But actually. I don't think the original intention of the chart was to show market percentage but compare volume."
kona comes in gas and EV form so even if the break even on the EV side they can still make a profit potentially
"It's low because the model 3 delievery numbers are low. More than half of the cars are allocated to Europe, especially the Netherlands. Now that end of the year US push as started, don't be surprised if model 3 delieveries will be over 20k this month which will put Tesla at 90% plus for Dec."
"Elon's goal is measured against the entire car market.   I firmly believe he'd like to see his share of the electric car market go down as electric cars become available from other manufacturers, attractive and practical.

Some manufacturers still don't have a BEV.  
Some manufacturers limit where they sell electric.  (California)  
Some manufacturers haven't broken 200 mile range.  
Some manufacturers seek to make their EVs ""weird"" to appeal to a niche audience.  (Nissan, BMW)  
All manufacturers limit the appeal of electric by letting dealers sell them.  (Except Tesla.)
Dealers also make the EVs seem less practical as they don't want to sell them. 

So that's a serious problem for availability, practicality and attractiveness"
Tesla was 99% focused on the US market this time last year because the rebate was expiring.  Right now a lot are being sent over seas.
No backlog this year.
"If I remember right; Elon provided guidance for 300-500K per year worldwide. Assuming November is an average month; that is 158,000 cars per year for just the US; That doesn't include Europe; Canada; China or Australia. My bet is sales are lower in November but I have no idea; seems about on track since europe and china sales seem to be high and growing. I believe Europe had 17,500 model 3s sold alone in September.

"As another currently non-EV but future EV owner, here are some good reasons to not get a Tesla:

* Price/incentives - deals on ""traditional"" manufacturer EVs can be had. Teslas are expensive and it's not easy to get a deal (best hope is an inventory car.)
* Service network - closest service center for me is ~4 hours away unfortunately. Also, there are tons of posts of people being increasingly unsatisfied with service/getting parts and it's seemingly only getting worse as more cars hit the road.
* Supercharger network - this is also a major positive but in some areas they're really busy (CA) or non-existent (ND.)
* Somewhat basic interiors for the price - if I'm dropping $50k for a car I'd like a heated steering wheel and ventilated seats (their seat material really doesn't breathe for some people and makes you sweaty fast.)

Having said all that, Teslas are massively leading other manufacturers in self-driving, battery, and other tech. I believe in the company and hope for my next car to be a Tesla in the next few years."
Looks like a grandpa car tbh
Probably because it’s 2x the cost of a model 3.
tesla does not have the dealer network of the big brands
the longer range leaf goes 226 miles
Why is Model 3 shitty?
"Eh, I dive on highway to work, and I couldn’t give up autopilot. Enjoy sitting on my phone in traffic over paying attention."
"I doubt you would qualify for, let alone place, at any event at the Paralympics"
"Now that the amazing specs of the cybertruck have been revelaed, I'm kind of disappointed in the Y.  Seems we're paying a fair bit more than the 3 for more interior room and nothing else. I want dat range!"
This and also X is a way better car (more options and features) than S.
I really wanted the S over the 3 but up here in Canada it was literally double the price over my LR AWD.
"We definitely have more 3's here. Model S is the second most common by far. Rarely see other Model X's in my area. But I ma in a very rural outskirts of a big city.

&#x200B;

I would have moved a Model S. But I had to be an adult and realize the Model X has the room we need in our family.  it is unusual for us to not have 7 people in it."
"I want the S.  It's better looking than the 3, has better ride (new smart suspension), quieter, goes further on a charge, has a hatch back and more storage, more screen display.  I want to take some long road trips, and the S is better suited.  Basic LR version will do just fine for me.

I wish the windshield from the X could make it onto the S.  That's the one thing about the X that I do love."
I have the X and two kids. It’s basically a really awesome minivan that drives like a sports car. The kids can get in by themselves after the doors open from the key fob. They love it. Their friends are jealous. It’s the ultimate family car.
😝
Elon Musk have what it takes to be 100%!
"US Model 3 sales are down about 7,000 in October and November from July and August per these numbers.  Is a 25% drop in sales QoQ really ""failing""?"
Why did you have to contact someone instead of scheduling an appointment with the app?
Sigh...
They are on the high end market and some people  are buying cheap ev .
77% is pretty damn high given their starting price.
"LOL

Even the best selling products in the country and world don’t command this much market share. This is plenty and they are in a great spot. Competition is a good thing and so is choice. Plus Tesla’s come at a premium."
There are Hyundai Ioniq leases for $99/mo
"> theyre the only relevant EV company

You're spot-on here. I've been saying this a lot lately and it's 100% true. There are currently 4 main types of vehicles on the market:

* ICE
* Hybrid
* EV
* Tesla

An EV is a niche vehicle for die-hard environmentalists who don't mind trading up performance, practicality and style just so they can drive a vehicle that broadcasts to the world how much they care about the environment.

Teslas are the way of the future for all cars, trucks and SUVs. The rest of the industry is trying to catch up and they'll get there but they're all going to be held to the Tesla standard. If it's not a viable alternative to a Tesla it's just another disappinting, niche market EV."
"I bought a Kona electric because it was a better fit for my needs compared to Tesla and it was a bit cheaper.  I want a Tesla next for sure, but I wanted to start electric driving now and Hyundai had the better long term deal."
They don't make electric busses or utility vehicles.
"ah, didn't think about leases. I would be tempted too.

We don't get that kind of deal up in Canada.."
Yeah the leasing deals I've heard people getting are insane. For that price it's an easy daily commute choice.
Where and when did you find this?! I can only find $300/month with $3000 down. I would definitely lease one if these for a company car if I could have one at that price point.
"Can someone point me to one of these mythical lease deals?  I have looked several times over the last six months, and all I see are $300-$400 a month lease deals with $4K down."
"I leased my i3 for $102/mo, and I loved it. Turned it in ahead of my Model 3.

My gf is on her 2nd i3 and she still loves it. She does have a long trip coming up (~500 miles) but BMW offers ICE loaners up to 2 weeks per year as part of the lease."
">  though as of 2019, I don’t know why anyone would opt into a car with this amount of range.

Like you said, for $100-$200/month it's an amazing daily commuter for places like Silicon Valley, with all the HOV lane access and free charging at work and all. You won't be taking road trips for it but with the money you save you can literally rent whatever luxury cars you want, including Tesla, when you need to."
"Oh, because they are practically giving them away."
"Okay, I am in for that deal. Anywhere near Austin?"
That's INSANE. I'll look into it.
Yup.  A used i3 is on my radar for those reasons. 25 K CAD here for a 2016 rex. Can get a better deal if you don’t mind driving out to Quebec.
[deleted]
[removed]
we can agree to disagree but I'd put i3 below Bolt or leaf. It's a worse EV with a price of luxury car but afaik the materials used in the car are not high quality because they are recycled material or something. That's nice but shouldn't command the price that it does MSRP wise. Hoping BMW can step up their EV game.
"They're pretty cool little cars, one of the best evs to drive according to Robert Llewellyn or however his name is spelled.

The exterior design is just polarizing though, but I mean cyber truck..."
the design is out of the world. it's outrageous. it's eye catching. people love that it's outrageous. it's like the cybertruck for sedans.

"Awesome, thanks for the response, brother!"
Interior is far from cheap. The seats are very comfortable and theres essentially an iPad in the middle for u to watch Netflix and yt on. Thats not a cheap interior I'd say
"Good stuff, thank you"
Very nice. Thank you for the info!
"Very good to hear! I'm a little bothered by the prospect of settling for RWD in these Boston winters, especially with the power and relative lightness of the vehicle. My first car was a 99 TransAm w/ an LS1 corvette engine and that thing was a goddamned SLED in the winter, and even shallow hilliness stuck it in place.

You're in Montreal, though, and it's really been fine? All that power in the rear wheels?"
"Companies sometimes increase account maintenance charges by Phi just for shits and giggles.  This practice is also known as making the ""Fee Phi fo' Fun."""
"That's weird, because it's a very common number to see for growth."
"I just quickly did some light reading since I'm confusing everyone.  Apparently I inappropriately applied it.

We saw a growth rate of ~1.6 over last year in electrical vehicle space, and I applied a linearization of that.

I'm definitely wrong, but the growth rate is substantially more than most people expected in the industry.

If the rate persists linearly though, we'll see 18% in 6 years, which is maybe shocking to most people, which is what I wanted to convey.

In fact though, introduced technologies with cost<>production feedback loops like the one Tesla fought itself into with the batteries, these tend to grow in a non-linear curve with the early-adopters and hump https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle

So in fact we may actually be seeing it starting to arc up into the ""Early Adopters"" stage on their chart on wikipedia for Roger's Bell Curve."
"It's 1.8% now, so if it only triples in 10 years, sure.  I guess rather than just picking this year's growth rate and extrapolating, or going with a linear model like most manufacturers assume, I should look at the curve.

But this year's growth was 60%"
It's going to be a lot faster. It's like when the iPhone hit. It will grow fast.
Californians: “Buy Local”
Honestly to a lot of the people who want to buy “American” cars even though many non American brands still make their cars in America would probably see California as worse than North Korea.
"yeah a lot of people still don’t even know it’s an American company, my older coworkers included."
">And of course, **some folks are unable** or unwilling **to spend what it takes to get into a Tesla.**

&#x200B;

:)

&#x200B;

Not sure we will actually need the $15k EV though. If FSD is solved, and owners can robo-taxi their Tesla, they will become affordable to MOST people as cost of ownership can be supplimented by robo taxi income."
Every car company should have switched their entire car lineup to electric already
Lol Elon’s “monopoly” you mean how nobody (car companies) gave a shit about pollution or the planet until Elon woke you idiot sheep’s up to the fact we’re basically 10 years away from recreating the movie “elysium” if it wasn’t for him flipping the entire auto industry on its giant fat ugly head

"My wife would die if I got the Cybertruck, so for us it's the Model Y."
"Completely agree. Cybertruck is $40k and 250 mi range, y is 39k with 230. The Y seems much less desirable now that the truck is announced. I really wish the Y had more range for the price, especially considering batteries are supposed to be improving. 
 
Unfortunately, like so many others, my wife would hate it if I bought the CT so I'm kinda stuck with the Y bc of the kids :("
"Agreed. I was 100% set on a Model Y, but it just doesn’t make sense with the Cybertruck. We have a truck now so might as well get a cool as fuck truck instead, for less."
"But it's your truck, give the wife her 3 and move on :D"
"It looks better, it's a bit more powerful, has a little more space, more range, and I prefer the flush screen...but yeah, it's just too hard to justify at 80k+"
"I also wanted the S as well, however I really like my 3.  I've talked to a few people who have owned both and they mostly seem to prefer the 3. However, that might change with the S refresh."
"I would have bought a Model X if we could afford it.  It's about twice as much as my Model 3.  We're still able to fit all three kids in the back with the car seats, but it is a tight fit.  That's what out Highlander Hybrid is for."

"Maybe trading bots can't understand what's going on. Human traders should know better. This quarter OUS demand has been way too strong, so the production lines have been busy producing for other countries. Now they finally switched to US production. The demand in US is also too strong, that's why the wait time is now 5\~8 weeks. 

2019 360k vehicles

2020 600k vehicles

2021 1 million vehicles

2025 4 million vehicles

All the talks about sales going down is just not well informed.

The stock will run wild next few years."
"Edit: I'll rephrase:

I did make an appointment on the app. I had a few questions for them. I couldn't find my answers online."
"I came very close to buying a Volt because I can't afford a Tesla.

But I'm just old enough to remember the bullshit with the EV-1 so fuck GM."
Tesla can't hold that monopoly forever. I work for Audi and Tesla has definitely forced a change in our lineup. We're releasing 2 more EV models next year in the US and promising even more in the next decade. We're all playing catch up but making big strides.  Audi pulled out of LeMans racing to focus R&D on electric racing.
"Superiority complex much?

Hyundai kona is an EV on the same chassis and exterior as their ice kona.... 

In fact, the kona has outsold tesla model 3 in some cities of metro Vancouver."
"All the companies catching up have the advantage of not having to create the market and not having to reinvent the wheel on everything. These companies also have massive budgets and long term investors. Tesla has been great in forcing this shift in the market,  but I don’t expect them to maintain their dominance for ever. But you don’t have to be dominant to remain influential."
"Jesus, the world could do with less of this fanboying of a company."
"We really get shafted up here ... Tried buying a bolt few months back. The guy was the worst salesman ever lmao. Didn’t know anything about electric cars other then “iNsTaNt TorQuE bro “.

I’m in a province with no provincial incentives , so a Tesla is still very pricey."
"I can't seem to find a price calculator on bmw.ca. $200 USD is $263 CAD. I currently spend way more than that on gas for my truck, so if I could get a base i3 lease for under $300 I would save money.

Note to BMW salespeople in the GTA: I will lease an i3 today if you can get it for that price."
"Look harder...check leasing forums like leasehackr if you suck at negotiating yourself.

Deals can be very regional though. At least in the northeast it looks like you can bargain about 12% off MSRP and then if you make sure they give you the best interest rate the lease comes out to about $150 a month for a stripped 2019 i3 rex and about $200 with some options ticked off. But most of these are already sold out since it's December now."
"Agreed. I am in Socal and check forums all the time. I did get my wife a great deal buying a Clarity, but I want to lease something myself to hold over for a few years. I never ever can find anything better than like $350/mo and $1500 down with 10k miles per year."
Texas isn't a CARB state. So little chance. BMW has to meet their annual quota or get a fine. Price dumping to get the people to bite at the end of the year is how its been done for a decade or longer with compliance vehicles.
Really? That is why you bought a Tesla? Not because it is just a better car?
"Uh, no, and by a wide margin. The i3 starts at $44K. The Model 3 (with much higher range) starts at $35K.
Who is the snob, the p one that buysv the cheaper, more capable car or the one that pays an extra $10K for a vastly nferior car?"
Because the used ones tank in value because BMW discounts new ones so heavily that it's usually worthwhile to perpetually lease. They spit shine a turd and it eventually looks good so some people.
How much?
"The starting MSRP on the i3 is $44,450.

The starting MSRP for the base/RWD Model 3 (with no incentives) is $39,990.

Am I missing something? I know the i3 can be had cheaper as a used car because it doesn't hold its value very well. I found a base model near me asking $18k and it has 9,000 miles on it. That seems like a pretty good deal to me. Is this what you are referring to?"
Having sat inside an i3 it's definitely above a Leaf.  It has a liquid cooled battery unlike the Leaf. Its battery is relatively small (42kWh from memory) so it's no Tesla competitor but it's definitely a decent city/short range car.  Not had a chance to compare it with a Bolt not having seen one (don't think it's ever coming to Europe)
">the materials used in the car are not high quality because they are recycled material or something.

Haha nice. Recycled means lower quality? You know that there are lots of customer good that use recycled material for literally everything? 

You've never been in an i3 before, right? It may not be a the best EV performance wise but the quality is definitely better than most of the competitors."
"Don’t know how that is, but I’ll take his word for it. Regarding the cyber truck, yea it ain’t pretty, but it’s grown on me."
"Lol, do you work in marketing? That was kind of convincing."
I think the problem is that many people have associated luxury cars with busy interiors.
"I put the car in chill mode(it changes the response of the accelerator) and the steering in comfort(lighter steering wheel feedback). I find it easier to ""feel"" the car when it's slippery. Also I'm equipped with really good winter tires (contiviking 7) that handle very well on ice and snow. I got the car in June so I haven't been through the 12inch snow storm type of day but in 5-6 inch of snow on city street and 2-3 inch on the highway it was fine. So basically the performance so far resemble alot to a FWD car with slight hint of tail happiness from time to time! The 50-50 weight distribution helps alot for sure."
TIL.  Or are you just pulling pun on me?
Haha - amazing !!
"Well, I suppose if something happens to be growing at that rate, then yes."
"I think I kinda understand what you mean, if you Φ(n) into Wolfram alpha it gives me cumulative distribution function which is integral of the bell curve, also shows up in the related to Rogers' bell curve [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion\_of\_innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations)

I think the most confusing part is that

small phi, ϕ(x) = probability density function

capital phi, Φ(x) = Cumulative distribution function (integral of PDF)

Although CDF and F\_X(x) seems like a way more popular notation for it. But it's still pretty troubling to me treating the standard deviation as a time variable, like in 1 time step the late majority becomes early majority, laggards becomes late majority... I guess it works, but it's just weird.

I think this is the same thing as an S-curve,

"> But this year's growth was 60%

Source?  Are you talking about the US?"
"Presuming battery prices continue their trend and there is enough capacity, yes."
Not if they don’t increase the charging locations. There are only 2 charge locations near me both over 15 miles away
As much as my political beliefs don’t align with California I still wouldn’t consider them worse than North Korea.
"I honestly doubt it tbh, a lot of people, even if you think they’re stubborn, will need to own a car over renting one."
Pre-owned  Fiat 500e has entered the chat.
they were too fat and happy until Tesla came by and made a compelling EV
No market will be 100% electric.
Yikes
"They mean it is best if Tesla keeps growing at current rate but EV market explodes and fills with lots of vehicles from lots of OEMs.

I don't know if I agree that Tesla has a monopoly but even if they do, it isn't as if every monopoly is gained by nefarious means."
Uh no.
"I don’t think it’s necessary to deem a car “shitty” just because a difference in preference. I think a lot of people are getting on board with a more minimalist design language. Besides, the part about cars most people enjoy is the drive, not the inside of the car. I don’t like the way the majority of American auto manufactures design their interiors, but I recognize the cars aren’t shitty; Just not my style"
Anything else?
"So, I can either try to find a wife or save for a Cybertruck?  Hmm...decisions."
Model Y for the wife. Cybertruck for you. That’s what I’m doing 😅

"exactly, the cybertruck doesn't fit all situations even though the cost is great, it's not meant to streamline with all of the others"
she’ll get over it
She doesn't want a Cybertruck? It's like an SUV with more trunk space!
"The base model Cybertruck is probably 3 years away.  My guess is over-the-air improvements to range are factored in and the difference of 20 extra miles of range will probably be gone by the time the Cybertruck is released, because the Model Y will have received those updates and its base range would be equivalent."
"The CT is cool and all, but I don't want a big truck to drive around... hard to park, can't fit in my garage."
Also the model 3 is in the same price range. They need to drop its price or something. Why would I get a model 3 at the same price as a model Y or Cybertruck?
You’re comparing the 2021 Cybertruck to the 2019 Model Y. You should instead compare it to the 2021 Model Y.
All that. I think the 'only' thing I wish I knew about was the Stealth option. I would of paid for that for sure

Two days ago the wait time was 2-3 weeks.  They will still guarantee delivery to the west coast by the end of the year if you order today.  The issue in the US isn't production constraints, it is delivery logistics over the holidays."
"Thanks, that clears things up."
"Volt was the best car I ever owned.  And I'm no fan of Chevy.  Great car, def not an EV-1.  Worth buying, although I don't understand why they discontinued them.  

I also don't understand why the Bolt is so expensive.  I get that batteries are still expensive, but damn, these pure electric bugs shouldn't cost $40K."
Dude... Dealeeers... Yuck...
"I still don't get why anyone thinks the EV-1 program was bullshit. It was an experimental car. They cost nearly a quarter million dollars each to make. They were leased as if they cost $30K to learn what they needed to learn about making and supporting electric cars, because they knew the CARB mandates were coming in the future. The tech did not exist to make the cars last more than a few years: the lead acid then NiMH batteries had very low cycle lifes, and cost $40K to replace. As they wore out, the risk of fire -- several people lost their garages -- increased. The tech was not there for a long-lasting electric car yet. At the end of the leases, the cars were scrapped, because they could not be left in the hands of the customers and there was no stock of spare parts to service them for 15 years as required by state law anyway. Thanks in part to the EV-1, GM was the first company to bring a 200+ mile range EV at under $30,000 to the world. There's literally nothing in that history to be upset about if you're being rational."
Hyundai ionic has some really good lease terms right now.
Oooooooh.   Almost forgot the shit-show that was the EV-1 debacle..... hard to believe they're the same company
"I am over the bullshit with virtually all other manufacturers, including colluding to lie about emissions standards and trying to claim there is ""no demand for electric vehicles"" so they could keep their brothers in the oil industry in business while selling us inferior vehicles which pollute the hell out of the environment.

I still bought tesla even though build quality wise it is ""inferior"". After years of busting my ass I am finally in a position where I can support the company that shares my vision (efficiency, speed, environment)."
"It’s really great that other manufacturers are offering better and better competition now. When I got my Model S five years ago there were no other electric cars with enough range, but now there are more and more.

My wife has her eye on e-tron which looks like a really nice car. I have yet to tell her that I have a reservation in for the Cybertruck though..."
"That's definitely a positive thing.  The unfortunate part is it still has to be better for a similar price point, and nothing released at a comparable price to Tesla's various models has been close to as good."
"They won't hold a monopoly by any means,  but their self-driving tech is almost a decade ahead of their closest competition.  While everyone is playing catchup with ev cars, they've already shifted focus on the next thing.  What Tesla has in their sights for their endgame is absolutely amazing."
">promising even more in the next decade.

LOL. Where do you think Tesla will be in a decade? Your company better moves a speed of Tesla, which has 0 chance of it happening. So good luck!"
"Tesla will not hold that monopoly forever...

If audi pushes out a non half-assed attempt."
"Isn't Audi the VW division where the diesel emissions cheats originated?  You might say that's all in the past, and I'd like to think so to, but…  Then here recently Audi were caught fibbing about the e-tron's charging speed — claiming it charges twice as fast as a Model 3, when a little basic research proved the opposite was true.

I mean, at what point can we start believing anything that we hear out of Audi?"
A car that's only available in 10/50 states is not comparable to a Tesla.
"+1

Also while the Chevy Bolt may not trigger everyone's style boner, some people do like the look (myself included), its compactness, and it is insanely comparable to a mid range model 3 in price, range, charging speed (at-home charging), and is fun to drive."
Just wait till the Model Y becomes widely available. Hyundai Kona sales will be 0
This is exactly what I did. Lease was cheaper than gas in my wrangler. BMW won’t walk that math to your door. Look up incentives and optimum deal structure on forums like Edmunds. The numbers change month to month.
They do different jobs. You could get a hybrid and save all that gas for about the same lease
"I've been looking since July, and I've never seen a e-lease with 0 down.  $300 / month has been the *minimum* with $4k down."

"The i3s have dirt cheap leases. So cheap that when they go off lease, you can find an i3 for around 15,000$ and it's only a couple years old."
"I3 still gets a 7500 tax credit, so there's part of the equation."
The model 3 is 40k isn’t it? Even with rebates it’s way over 35k.
It’s the same as Opel Ampera.

"Listening to an economist the other day talking about the economic problems the Alberta oil sands is experiencing and going to continue to experience up here in Canada.  He was saying, with the rapidly decreasing price of batteries (as more and more large factories come online), as well as more large manufactures begin to produce ev's at a larger scale (Volkswagen, Volvo, Ford F150, etc)... they expect price parity between EV's and ICE vehicles in approx 5 years (without incentives).

This is important to oil project investment because as that happens density (and range) will also be increasing while charging infrastructure development continues it's rapid pace and he said that once you get close to parity (along with everything else)... it will mean there is very little barrier to entry or sacrifices to made for most people.  So sales will go through the roof.  Correspondingly, demand for oil and gas products will drop.  He was speaking more in terms of why long term oil project investment has virtually stopped in Alberta... and it's because these giant multi-national oil companies employ some of the best and brightest economic forecasters in the world and they all see what's coming.  Alberta is the ""canary in the coal mine"" for oil project development because it's such expensive oil to eventually turn into gas that the price for a barrel needs to be approx $50 to $60 to break even.  And as demand drops, the barrel price will stagnate or drop or maybe even increase a small amount as OPEC reacts and cuts production etc... but it probably won't get back to above $80 consistently which is when Alberta oil projects make sense.  These again are large multi-national companies that will just move resources and exploration to more profitable areas of the world.

The next decade is going to be very interesting."

Are you the kind of person who will only buy a car not just made in America but by an American company?
"I was referring to \*owning\* a Tesla you previously could not afford, by using that Tesla in the robo taxi fleet to make you money and thus be able to cover some/all of its cost. This is mentioned in Master Plan, Part Deux, quoted at end of post.

e.g. If you can only afford a $15k car, instead, you could buy or lease a $40k Tesla and it earns you $10k or $20k/year, now you can afford a $40k Tesla.

&#x200B;

>You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost. This dramatically lowers the true cost of ownership to the point where almost anyone could own a Tesla. Since most cars are only in use by their owner for 5% to 10% of the day, the fundamental economic utility of a true self-driving car is likely to be several times that of a car which is not."

Tesla barely sells half a million cars a year. It is not like they will outsell or even come close to the big manufacturers in numbers withing the next 5-10 years. Especially not since VW and others are releasing cars now and there will be actual competition on the market. So far they managed 500k sales in a year with basically no competition.

This is a fine idea but I'm sure if Tesla allowed negotiation I could get a better price than what they currently offer. It's not like they set the price at the lowest they're ever willing to accept.

>There will be actual competition? Really? With Tesla future models or with Tesla 2012 version?

Not sure why you make such statements. Cars like the ID3 are real competiton and they are good cars. And more importantly they target the market where you sell most cars."
Building factories takes a long time and Tesla does not have the same manufacturing know how the legacy companies do and it shows. The old companies have a much more streamlined process and that is why they produce cars faster. It is not like the established manufacturers are in stand still. They are building countless factories right now too. VW alone has several additional ones being build and is converting others. Tesla is building one right now. That is not gonna make them catch up.
You can win the EV market right now as much as you want. Evs are only 2% or something of the market. They are car manufacturers first and Ev makers second. You compete on cars sold not one single small subgroup of cars. The big ones will slowly transition sales of ice to Evs. Their overall sales numbers will stay the same. You measure them on the total sales not just Evs just because Tesla does not sell them.

Wow. I must be imagining [this coast-to-coast route](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=d89520ac-e5fa-43ed-810b-56df4bb9bb0b) that A Better Routeplanner just came up this then.

Your markdown is coming out of the markup they tacked on to give you the feeling that you got a deal.  That margin is built in to the dealer model.
But to make the economics work out for Tesla they'd have to be charging some customers more than they do now.

"I have no idea how you came up with that last comment about half of Teslas on the road today are less viable for road trips.  Most Teslas today have more range than the e-tron even after accounting for degradation. 

Can you show me the number of actual fast non Tesla chargers on the road today? Audi had about 200 range but in reality it will be much less driving at about 80mph avg.  range anxiety will be a big factor. 

Even 310 range on the 3 comes to around 230-250 miles true range when doing 80mph avg.  So if you adjust by 75% the e-tron will really have about 150 range."
"And they're too small. Or, more likely, the drivetrain is too inefficient, because the e-Tron's range kindof sucks."
Audi has the upper hand on interior quality and finishing too. I love my Tesla but i wouldn’t call it a luxury car. At least not compared to the bmws and Audi’s I’ve had.
yeah but range is still a big deal and tesla has got them beat on that front
"👍

Allow me to give some perspective, I worked in the industry (not directly in batteries but adjacent). There is still so much room for improvement. We don’t need a big breakthrough to continue incremental improvements for the near future. Breakthroughs are a bonus. The future is bright :-)

"They're definitely still able to offer a lower price thanks to direct selling but I know it could be even lower. Maybe not even through negotiating but for sales.

It could be lower for their used cars too. Sometimes a car will just sit for months at a poor price which actually causes it to lose value. Especially in Canada where they offer used cars for the same price as new (after you factor the government rebate). No reason for anyone to buy used in that case."
"The cheapest model 3 starts at 44300 in Germany. That is significantly more expensive. So yes a 45 kwh battery for that price is not bad. It definitely can compete and Tesla does have nothing in that price range. The VW will most likely also have better build quality and when you call VW someone actually picks up and they do have spare parts if you ever need some. It is very clear how blinded you are. There are pros and cons to both manufacturers/cars but you only see anything Tesla as good and anything else is bad.

edit:

That model 3 you get for 44300€ has a wltp range of 409km. The 30000€ id3 with a 45kwh battery has 330km.

So for 47% more money you get 23% more range.

edit2:

if you spent 45000€ for the more expensive id3 you get 550km range. That's 1.5% more money for 34% more range. Does Tesla even compete? (I know this is a silly question. I'm just stating it so you see how ridiculous your comment is). To get the same range you have to buy the long range model 3 which starts at 54k"
VW already sold 200000 EVs this year. That is half what Tesla sold. And VW was not even all in into the EV market like they are now with the ID3. The ID3 is the replacement for the golf. Their cash cow. And i brought up VW because it is the parent company of audi and because it is competition to tesla. I talked about competition entering the market and that includes VW that is spending ridicolous amounts of money in EVs right now. Also they are one of the biggest manufacturers world wide. If someone can sell a lot of cars in the EV market to give Tesla tough competition it is them. Not sure why I would not bring them up when we are talking about the EV market and how it is going to change in the future.
"None of that is even comparable to cars. No idea why you bring up those. Cameras, phones and stuff you buy at a store are usually low in price and will be replaced rather quickly. The same is not true for cars. People don't replace their cars every 2-3 years like they do with phones. The time it takes to move from mostly ice to mostly evs takes a long time. No manufacturer is suddenly going to be caught in not being able to sell any cars. In fact even if every manufacturer would suddenly stop making ice cars and only sold evs it would not work simply because the surrounding infrastructure needs time to adapt to the change too and that wont happen in a short time either. People here constantly complain about people saying tesla is doomed, or will go bankrupt or what ever and youre the same but in the opposite direction."
"The gap between real world range and the official EPA range is also the largest for Tesla.

Nextmove tested some cars at the time they were fans. At 150km/h speeds the diff between the real range and official range was up to 26% for the model S and X while the diff for the e-tron was < 16%.

Now explain this to me if the model S/X is supposed to be more efficient, is more aerodynamic and weigh less than the e-tron.

People seem to come close to the EPA-range with the e-tron, even in freezing temperatures and winter conditions. This can hardly be said for any of the Tesla models."
"> I know it could be even lower.

But they're trying to expand the company, build factories, build more superchargers, expand the service network, etc.   That takes money.  They *could* probably chop several thousand off of each car, and then go belly-up in a couple of years, or fail to expand any more.   

Edit:  Or I guess they could just raise prices by a couple of thousand, and then let people haggle back down to the current price."
">No manufacturer is suddenly going to be caught in not being able to sell any cars

Source?

If you build a product that no-one wants, you're going to have a hard time selling it.  Just because consumers own cars for more than a couple years, doesn't mean they'll put up with substandard vehicles.

That's before we even talk about self-driving.

>because the surrounding infrastructure needs time to adapt to the change too and that wont happen in a short time either.

Well, one company has already built an enormous infrastructure to support EV's - most importantly it's built the infrastructure to *build* the infrastructure.  If your car manufacturer hasn't got that sorted, the market isn't going to wait around.

It's funny that you claim that the big manufacturers have more infrastructure to build cars... then claim that nobody has the infrastructure to build EV's.  Fact is the legacy companies lack infrastructure, not TESLA.

>youre the same but in the opposite direction.

Major companies fail all the time if they get stuck in thier legacy approach.  ICE vehicles days are numbered, heck if self driving works then the number of vehicles produced will plummet - just because you make ICE cars today does not prepare you for this future."
yeah isnt the profit on a 3 like 8k? thats less then what my pre tax is. idk how much their engineers make but gotta coover costs and we know the x and s are not selling that much
Source is common sense. The car market is very sluggish. The life cycle of a car is very long. And Tesla is in a situation where everyone else is using an open standard and they have their proprietary plug. That could backfire on them and their infrastructure is not nearly enough to satisfy a demand where suddenly everyone has an ev. Evs are only 2% of the market right now and there's already very long queues in regions where lots of Evs are. You can't change that in a short time.
"Yeah, I don't know all the financial voodoo terminology, but if x isn't bigger than y then things go boom, or something like that.    We all want cheap stuff, but we also want the company to expand and increase production numbers and open more superchargers and all the rest.   No free lunch."
">The life cycle of a car is very long.

I'm not sure how that helps?  It doesn't matter if I last bought a car 5 years ago or 15 years ago, I'm still going to but the best car I can when I'm in the market.  

>And Tesla is in a situation where everyone else is using an open standard and they have their proprietary plug.

Except that current the open standard kinda sucks.  Apple also has often used it's propietary standards - didn't really hurt thier sales much.

Keep in mind, it's not like Tesla can't use the open standard... but other manufacturers cannot take advantage of superchargers.  

>and there's already very long queues in regions where lots of Evs are.

I assume you have a source for that, and not just a picture of a single station during Thanksgiving...

>You can't change that in a short time.

So you're saying that legacy providers are behind and it will take them a long time to change?"
"I thought for a second that it was turquoise colored, like the ID3."
"I want a performance version but not with 20” rims, hope they make stealth versions of the Y!"
My wife and I were there when it was charging.  They had the car completely covered and the guy driving it stayed in the car.  I would have never noticed it was a model Y if they hadn't started putting the cover on.
In the yld.
We only talk about Cybertrucks here
"still has protective tape on the black trim, odd it hasn't been taken off until this was just made/delivered to wherever it's being tested."
Looks like a mini model X.
Interesting that the trim/handles are mismatched between matte black and chrome.
"I was seriously thinking that Tesla's design department were pushing and pulling a 3D model of a previous generation to come up with the next car design. Model Y seems like a non-uniformly scaled version of M3. Just like the design language relationship between S and X.
And of course, then comes the Cybrtrck..on which they probably disabled the ""smoothing/subdivision"" on the source 3D model! :D"
"I definitely saw one on the 5 north today, headed over Tejon pass out of LA. It was just for a second but after spotting M3s all day it definitely stood out. Especially the pointy spoiler on the rear end. Haven't been that excited to see a car in the wild in a long time."
"I hope the Model Y does well, but honestly, it's hard for me to get excited about, as it's just a riff on the Model 3.  I'm enthused for the new group of owners who are waiting for it, but *I am* excited about the Cybertruck (pity it's a way's off), as it represents may new things/directions."
That my friend is profit on wheels. Now we know what Elon meant when we going forward we will be GAAP profitable.
it really does look like a Model X
"Cant wait for this. 

This will be my next car. Goodbye gasoline."
I think model y production started with employee beta program first
"Pfft, Too round."
Turn your phone
"Wonder why these aren’t in any showrooms yet, the design must be locked in at this point."
I hope my white Y has chrome trim.
you spooked it.
"what is the model y supposed to be again? is it just like a hatchback/mini model x, but bigger than the 3 and s? or is it the size of the 3?"

Why does it have the Model 3-esque chrome around the windows? That chrome delete was the best thing about it.
So chrome delete is not confirmed.
That looks great.
The driver might be in trouble maybe hehehe
Where was this?
Oooooooh...
That looks exactly like an x
"Ok, what about it?"
What is the difference between the Y & X?
I wish the trim was black chrome instead of the satin black. It looks like plastic.
This sub would splooge its pants if it came to Vancouver. I saw literally 6 of these on my commute the other day
"Half 3, half x!"
"What's it have that's better than a Model 3, I wonder."
It's like a model 3 with a fat ass
"I keep forgetting about the Y, especially now that the cybertruck has been revealed. The truck feels like a better buy as well."
When are we gonna start saying yld?
It looks so good. I don't know how they'll keep selling Model Xs after this comes out
"Not impressed with the trunk area. It is much too small. I doubt I can fit 2-3 suitcases in there. 

The back should've been higher to allow for that cargo. 

It looks like a bloated 3 imo without the full range and good comfort of cargo. 

Hmm...Was looking to replace my Acura MDX with something like the Y but now not so sure."
"I think I saw one at the Kingman, AZ Supercharger over the weekend.

I thought it was a model X, It was covered, and I was thinking why would someone cover their car for a ~30min supercharge.

I'll have to check my dash cam (ap1 no sentry mode so it's a regular dash cam) on the weekend."
"Good thing you shot vertical video, otherwise we could’ve seen the whole thing clearly in one shot."
Nice.
What's the majors differences between the Model 3 and Model Y? Bigger trunk? More rear headroom? They look extremely similar in size.
Does not look good.
Am I alone in thinking the Y is not necessarily going to be as big of a smash hit as people are predicting.  Like it selling multiples of Model 3 volumes.  Anyone else feel that?
"Serious question: Can someone explain to me why releasing the Model Y is taking so long? I'm sure there's more too it than my uneducated self knows, but it seems like they just need to change the body work and interior slightly versus the the Model 3. It's been how long now since they announced the Model Y?"
[deleted]
"Neat, a car"
Is it like a rare thing?
I'm not going to lie guys but in my opinion the model Y is a pretty ugly car. They basically took the model 3 and made it into a hatchback. That's a pretty weak attempt at a mini SUV. I'd rather get a cyber truck which is growing on me.
There should be a feature to virtually high five each other when having an encounter in the wild.
Sweet! Are those lights on the window rims? Or just metal reflecting?
I honestly could watch this without a title and never know it wasnt a X.
Seems like this one doesn't have the Chrome Delete!
"Wow, it's just as ugly as the Model X."
The doors are horribly misaligned wow
What's a Model Y?
[deleted]
Panel gap
"Are these rare? I see one everyday, but now that I think about it I haven’t see another one."
"No, that would be too interesting for Tesla. I love them, but man do they ever have boring color options. :/"
"I'm sure they will, too bad potentially not immediately though. I think they have to make the stealth ones in order to advertise the range of 18"" wheels on the cars with 20"" wheels. They have to be EPA tested and sold with 18"" for them to be able to advertise that number."
"Stealth really needs to be an option. I wish it was something you could order online. Love the performance, hate the larger wheels. No use for them in the Midwest."
"I'd much rather 18 or 19's with the performance pack. As Tyga says, "" Too much rim make the ride too hard""

&#x200B;

Plus rim damage/etc. My A4 has 18"" wheels and is a good compromise."
What does stealth meannnn?
"Originally, I think you could choose the 18s on the performance order page"
"When I pulled up I thought ""Wow, they're serious about blacking it out to take a nap"". Then when he pulled off the cover and I saw the black model 3 style door handles, ""That's no regular Tesla SUV!!"""
"Lol, cover the car that is designed to be almost exactly like half of the other cars at the chargers"
The model Y has a ghost costume mode?!
Is it just a prototype or something?
Why the secrecy? Everybody has at least seen a pick of one. Weird.
Took me a yle to get this joke lmao
[deleted]
True. I had to double check what subreddit I was in.
There seems to be a shortage of center caps for the rims they're putting on these things as well.
"Yeah but way better. This one lets you put on a roof rack! And it’s $35,000 less."
It actually looked like the chrome trim had tape wrapped all around it. A little part on the front door looked lifted up.
I like it.
OR they sculpted it then hit the decimate button a few too many times.
"I was on that pass yesterday and kept my eyes peeled for one! Good thing you left today, it was basically shutdown yesterday."
The X was just a big S with the doors.
"I wonder how many will trade in their 3 for a Y, I feel that the early adopters of the 3 will be due for a ""fresh car"" by then. Used prices will drop a bit for others to join in on the 3 inventory."
"The thing about the Y, is that many people want a crossover or SUV, but can't afford a Model X. (Crossovers are the fastest growing segment in cars right now) When the Model Y launches, Tesla will finally have an affordable car that isn't a sedan."
"It’s funny, I’m not planning to buy the Y, but I do think a “riff on the model 3” is a pretty important milestone. It’s kind of not a big deal because every other car company does it, but it’s also kind of a big deal because it means Tesla is maturing into a real car company with a real market presence, not just a niche luxury player. The Model Y is arguably the first car from Tesla that will compete in a market segment that the public really cares about. Crossovers outsell luxury sedans by a pretty wide margin, at least here in the states, and are probably the most popular category today."
The Y has me very tempted to be a Tesla owner since we got a new addition to the family and that means lots of things to haul around.
"Big difference for me is the Model Y having a glass roof, while the Model 3 has glass panels separated by a chunky roll bar.

Also more headroom, and a hatch (for bikes, furniture) instead of a boot."
Yeah to me (just an opinion) it is ugly too.
"> I hope the Model Y does well, but honestly, it's hard for me to get excited about 

This is pretty much the norm for the the class.

Did anybody get excited about the new rav4 or highlander coming out? They are just corolla's / Camry's with fatter bodies, and power take offs to give them AWD...

Same deal with the model Y, it's pretty much a model 3 with a fat body. Styling is not as nice as a sports-wagon could have been. Off road ability won't be worthy of note.

But all auto makers pritty much have to build vehicle in this class, because they sell like hot cakes, for various reasons."
Well they didn't make a Model 3 hatchback so I just want a Model Y /w coil overs.
Pregnant guppy?
"As a general rule, Tesla avoids increasing demand on a model they cannot sell or are selling every one they make. Model 3 show room models weren't available until after many early adopter deliveries. They knew people were willing to buy them unseen and without test drive.

Obviously day one reservations are different."

"Compact SUV, also known as a crossover"
Looks like they are using model 3 doors which are chromed but the handles and back are blacked out.
"basically its a hatchback, or crossover if you’d like the general populace term"
Why do you think that?  That segment is the most popular vehicle segment in the market. I would have one of these if they were already sold. Model 3 is too small with storage space.
"I think it's just a lack of hype. These will sell when regular non-Tesla hardcores see them in showrooms, and then on the roads."
"I \*didn't\* feel that until after the Cybertruck unveil -- but now I wonder how much of the Model Y's thunder will be stolen by the truck. I, like many people, don't really love the aesthetics of the truck, but the value and function proposition it offers is pretty compelling versus the Y -- especially the $50K AWD version. The base Model Y with the 7 seat option is right around the same price -- and aside from one more seat, smaller size, maybe 10 miles longer range, and arguably better aesthetics, the Y doesn't have many advantages. The mid-level truck will have similar 300 mile range -- but will have AWD, a truck bed, a tough stainless steel exterior, higher ground clearance when needed, etc.  The Y should be a bit cheaper to operate because it will go further per kWh (smaller, lighter, more streamlined) and because the truck will require much larger (and more expensive) tires. So basically, I think that many folks (myself included) who might have gone for a Y, will instead hold out for the truck. The ones who don't will be those who really have to have 7 seats, can't stand the looks of the truck, don't want the utility of a truck bed, and/or have to have the vehicle sooner. Not sure how many people fall into those categories, but my guess is that the promise of the truck may put a substantial dent in demand for the Y."
It will do exceptionally well in Europe and will surpass Model 3 sales in North America.  Sedans are just not very popular any more.
"I feel the same, but my dislike for compact SUVs probably biases me. It's the least exciting class of car built to ferry kids and pick up groceries. I'm not sure any manufacturer can make that sexy."
Alone .
*if* it was this easy ( which it is not ) - perhaps they are not ready to re-tool due to model 3 demand and trying to crunch them out for the tax credit .
"Style is really individual preference. And the most useless topic to argue about. You like them, others don't. That's the end of the conversation."
Most young people I meet love the Tesla designs.
"Prepare for downvotes for daring to say anything negative.

I think you’re correct about the Tesla crossovers though. They look like inflated sedans whereas the category best sellers look more utilitarian than a standard sedan. The whole SUV craze is more about image than anything else, or else wagons and minivans would reign supreme."
Function is beautiful for engineers.
"I like boring - I don't want a flashy car. But, I do want to push the technology forward and push the country towards EV's over ICE's.

""Hiding in Plain Sight"" would be my slogan... haha!"
So many downvotes for speaking the truth.
Of course it is. The car isn’t being manufactured for consumers yet. There are very few out there.
I respect your opinion.  I think it's great for my needs.  I would like something bigger than the 3 but not quite so ... unusual as a CT.
You’re not wrong. Looks like the Pontiac Aztec
Give them a break. The car isn't out yet. This is a test car. You can also see the chrome delete wrap sticking only outside of the door panels. clearly the doors have been replaced before.
s3xy
"Model Y is not released to the public yet so any on the road are most likely test vehicles from Tesla directly. 

The one you spot might be a Model X which is the SUV version, that one has been out for a few years."
[deleted]
"""Recession proof"" colors I think is the term."
Just get the free option and spend 2500 on a wrap
"100% with you. Pretty much every paint color Audi/Porsche has is stunning from white to vegas yellow and everything in the middle. Tesla's current red isn't even ""Pull me over"" red."
I'd rather 18's.  They have more pothole resistance.  Considering there's no spare tire in the back... The 18's also have better economy as you pointed out.
"You can, I just had one delivered. Tesla is finally realizing the benefits of selling the stealth Performance Model 3."
"Basically the LR AWD Model 3 18 or 19in wheels but with the Performance acceleration. AKA sleeper, P3D-"
I bet those black handles get hot as hell in the summer
Yes.
Because this design may not be what's put into production.
"Exactly - I assume they've probably made a dozen (a few dozen?) from prototypes of the planned parts for assembly, just to check things out and verify there aren't any really major ""oops"" moments in the design.  Real world evaluations...

Plus, wouldn't they have to have a few demonstrators for crash tests ( :(  ) before they start selling to the public?"
"No it didn't,

You just yanted to be part of the joke.

Edit: And I clearly didn't get the trend of words."
I'll show myself out.
"Yeah, the -$35,000 is a massive selling point, dare i say the biggest."
It looks worse but the price looks better.
"Ah good to know although that doesn't make much sense either haha

Edit: saw a reply below, is the black protective tape!"
I was actually headed south bound and it was pretty much a breeze. Northbound looked pretty nasty. So thankful traffic was good today.
But at least it looks significantly different.
"Yes but the x is different enough on release and the front is also bigger which matches the size of the back making it more aesthetically pleasing. The x looks like a SUV, the Y looks like a 3 with a bigger ass. It looks less like a mini suv and more like a hatchback, which is a sedan with more truck space."
"I don't think that's accurate technically; the Y shares the same platform and many parts/body panels with the Model 3.  The S and the X are not built on the same platform, and share very little, except some design language."
Me for one.  Early Model 3 and love it except its a sedan.  Looking to upgrade to the Y.
I’m probably in that category
But the model y doesn't look like a cross over. It looks like a hatchback sedan. It's a model 3 with a bigger trunk.
Sedans are an even smaller market in Europe as we prefer wagons as family vehicles with hatchbacks also being acceptable. And crossovers now. So big thing indeed.
I'd like to see Tesla create a Model 3 fastback coupe that's a two-door performance variant; for me that would be something I'd be more enthused about.
I totally get that as a use case - been there years back myself.
Go for something much larger. You’ll thank me come potty training time.
Hence why they didn't offer Model Y test rides at the Cybertruck event.
"It isn't ""chrome delete"" because there isn't chrome to begin with....."
"Agreed, chrome on white just blends in; I deleted mine for the contrast."
What's the point of those?
I feel like it’s not quite enough crossover-like. It’s like they squeezed a crossover into a model 3 and had to make a lot of compromises to do it.  I feel like the choice between X/S is much more stark than between 3/Y
Small crossover vs full size pickup are two different segments brah. Soccer moms don’t want cybertruck.
Physical size is another reason. The truck has me interested but I want something I can fit in my garage.
"This is my issue. I want something a bit more capable than the Y, but don’t necessarily need the size of the CT. That being said, I’d rather wait for CT than Y to convert from my ICE sedan cause what’s the point of the Y if it’s not all that I want?"
[deleted]
How do someone own that?
There's no accounting for early 00s GM taste :)
Can you tell if they're frameless doors like on the 3? There's quite a bit of commentary about alignment issues after rear passengers mistakenly pull the emergency egress and other stories about how snow/ice prevents the windows from coming down so they can open.  It seems to be one less headache to think about?
"I bet your totally right. I know it has suicide doors, which is cool but I bet that’s what it is since it has rims with the black paint coming off."
Laughed
"How to survive a recession:

Step 1) Don't purchase a Tesla if you couldn't afford it during a recession."
And then have it look worn out and faded in 3-5 years and have to get it removed because it doesn't peel off as easily as they said it would. (personal experience) I'm sticking with the paint.
$2500. Where are you getting yours wrapped for that price!?  Sounds like a fucking steal.
"Plus, given that most wraps also give keying protection to the car, that seems like a fair price over the hassle of having to get the whole car repainted.."
How much would cost a real repaint?
*Engineering Explained entered the chat*
"Potholes haven't been a big deal for me so far but the loss of range sucks on longer trips.  I just barely made it home over Thanksgiving with 305 mi. starting full and going about 180 miles.  Between the tires, a wet road, and 40 degrees, it's all it could do."
My point is it's still not an option on their website.
The chrome ones do too. The black paint/coating might not transfer the heat to your hand as quickly making them more comfortable to use when hot.
Cars door handles get hot in the summer.
Thanks.
"Yeah, but it’s not like it’s going to be radically different from the reveal... 🤷‍♂️"
You’re too ylee
"Nah, the roof rack, who cares about 35,000? /s"
"Great minds can disagree. It’s got sensible doors, eliminating the one problem I have with the X."
The white trim is actually the protective film. The car has black trim on it standard.
It didn't really until release.  At this point the x prototypes still had nosecones.
"I would never buy a sedan and was so incredibly disappointed when I learned the 3 was a conventional sedan and not a hatchback like the S. The Y is actually somehow not all that much bigger than the S, but it’s a proper hatchback/wagon/crossover/I don’t care what you call it the important part is there’s a hatch that opens wide and lets you put stuff inside, and at an affordable price. It will probably be the best-selling Tesla ever."
"A crossover by definition is a SUV based on a car chassis (a normal SUV is usually based on a truck chassis, although not always).       
The Model Y is a bit taller, and seems to be a little longer than the 3. When I think Hatchback, I think VW Golf, or Subaru Impreza, both of those seem to be much smaller than the Y appears to be.       

Here are two side by side of the 3 and Y that I found:     
[Exhibit 1](https://www.xautoworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Model3-ModelY-Compare-1024x715.jpg)      
[Exhibit 2](https://i.redd.it/wwzs7v674xm21.jpg)"
"I have a Honda Crosstour which is basically built on the Accord platform, and the extra space provided by the hatchback instead of a trunk is pretty significant."
"I’m looking at the Mach E, Kia Niro, and Model Y atm. I’m not sure of any bigger EVs out there."
[deleted]
"Same dimensions as a compact sedan but a higher ride height gives better visibility, plus the hatchback rear opening allows for more cargo space"
To satisfy the market that does not want a sedan.
"It’s a car the size and weight of a sedan, with the utility of everything that isn’t a sedan. Basically kind of like a sedan for the reason people buy sedans (because they’re cheap and efficient) without the despair of actually having to own a sedan."
Exactly 👀
"Every company has a crossover option outside of their usual SUV.  Porsche has a Macan under their Cayenne, Audi has a Q3 under their Q5, BMW has their X3 under their X5 etc..."
Ill agree that the S/X seems like a bigger difference. The presumed extra storage on the Y is what has me interested. The 3 just has a lack of usable trunk space and i use it heavily for work/2 kids. Im hoping for more space in the Y
"Id hoped for a reliable air suspension system where max height would make it more capable than a 3 (or any other city car) Iv given up on that idea. Id also given up that if i own only one car, it wont be one that can get me further down outback trails. The reality is most people don't off-road their CUV's. The Y has more interior room and a lift gate. I still feel that means it will make up far more than just 50% of ""3 and Y"" sales. My gut from pouring over reddit, yt, etc, is that the majority of 3 owners would have liked a hatch / lift gate over the boot. Y fixes that. I almost had to talk myself into going back to ""low, stiffly sprung sedan life"" Then the Y rumors. Then the CT rumors. In my experience, the only people still buying small sporty sedans are under 30's and/or, those that don't need to routinely move things around hobbies or family.  The 3 was the first real EV people could live with and i get that people are making do with the small sedan shape but the Y solves that with a bit more cash, bit less speed and range.

Course, paintless, bulletproof, 6 person CT and (maybe) mini CT messed the above up a bit :S"
Agreed -- mostly. Many soccer moms won't. But some might.
"Yeah -- I did list the smaller size of the Y as an advantage. That means higher efficiency, cheaper tires, fits better in garages and parking spaces, etc.  That will be enough to cause some to choose the Y over the truck."
My situation exactly. I would love something a little smaller --  more like a Tacoma double cab instead of an F-150.
Cybertruck..
Tesla owns it. It’s a pre-production test car.
You ain’t even lying!!
Depression: When it's not a recession and you still can't afford a Tesla.
"My car (not a Tesla) is 7 years old and the paint looks like garbage on parts of it. Shit happens to cars when they're parked outside, especially if you live in an area with winter (which I realize a lot of Tesla owners don't). If you care about your car's appearance enough to spend big bucks on expensive paint and wraps, then you might as well keep spending every 3 years and have a fresh looking car all the time. Plus, your tastes will change during that time. You can wrap it with whatever strikes your fancy at that moment!"
"Don’t get black then, mines all scratched up and i’ve babied it. The paint job is garbage, or at least it was on the first model 3 deliveries."
3-5 years isn’t long enough lifespan for a wrap for you? There not meant to be permanent...
Heat is your best friend when removing any type of adhesive.
Then you sell it
Saran Wrap
Here in Denmark (where wages are high) a Vinyl Wrap will set you back $2-3000 while a paint protection wrap will easily be $4000+. So 2500 in the states seems reasonable ?
"Over 7,000, don’t paint though as wrapping serves as a protective layer"
"Lol I just snorted. 

I’ve been on the receiving end of the pothole damage and cracked a rim and those were with 45 profile tires on my 2009 Subaru Legacy. Since then I have noticed the profile of the sidewall and generally try to get as high of a sidewall as possible. I’ve downsized the rims to steelies in the past to get larger sidewalled tires also."
"So with the cold weather your range went from 305 miles and you were super low after driving 180 miles? Yeah that seems about right if you had the cabin heat going. 

Did you have to slow down at all or did you drive faster? I’ve heard the computer will tell you to drop to, say, 55 mph if needed to get there. But curious if your Watts per mile was high and also had the drag from driving 85 mph etc."
"Agreed, I predict by end of the year it will become standard on their website though."
Model S chrome gets hot too
I should calm down with a glass of yne.
The falcon doors have their pros and cons. They should give people options on those. It makes getting in easy but I also know they come with problems too. But other then the door it just looks better then a Y. Y looks like a hatchback instead of a cross over. But agree to disagree.
"But they refreshed the S to not have a nosecone either. The X is more dissimilar to the S than the Y is to the 3, but tech wise it really is just an S with falcon wing doors. Same powertrian, computers, etc."
"But the Y and 3 share many more components, and we're a lot closer to the Y's production now. If there were any issues or major changes, they would have happened earlier this year or during the 3's development.

Tesla was still figuring out how to make cars when they unveiled the X."
The s is a hatchback? Doesn't look like one.
"Right, but if you have to put up side-by-side photos to figure out which one is which, it doesn't really look the part. Nobody is confusing an X3 for a 3 Series."
But the cross overs are usually noticably bigger. The model y hardly looks any different. I just can't call this a cross over.
Ya but it's not a cross over. A cross over would be like Toyota RAV4.
"I wish there was a Tesla minivan. I’m forced into a Honda Odyssey until there is. Model 3 as a second commuter car.

Also to be a realist, I wouldn’t want to road trip in an EV with young kids just yet."
"Of the 3, only the Kia Niro EV is available.  My wife loves hers.  If you get it, try to get CostCo pricing.  In California, demand is so high, everyone is asking $5000 over MSRP."
"> Chrome deletes are very common on the Model 3 so people know what you’re talking about when you use that term.

It's less ambiguous to say ""there's no chrome"". Saying it has ""chrome delete from the factory"" suggests there is chrome that is covered with vinyl stickers."
"Does it have a higher ride height? That’s the real reason I didn’t want one, cause of the M3 height."
🙋🏼‍♂️
What type of car do you see most of? It’s somewhat regional but there are a fuck ton of crossovers and small suvs around my neck of the woods ; 2nd to giant trucks with lift kits
Astute observation sir.

"My last two cars, I've clay bar and wax multiple times per year and its really shows when I have sold the car off after 5-8 years of ownership. Of course, random dings an scratches can't be covered with wax. Wraps aren't as much of a priority in my mind."
My BMW is 15 years old and the Titanium Silver still looks good. They really know how to make a good car. After a car wash it shines really nicely.
Who keeps the same car for more than 3 years?
Black paint is borderline impossible to keep perfect on any car.
"For real, 3-5 years can do a number on a paint job. Especially in my area - little rocks flying up at the car all the time and whatnot. Having a wrap get crappy after 3-5 years but keep the paint more/less flawless for that time seems like a decent tradeoff."
*they‘re
"I was living in Duluth, Minnesota with no access to a heat gun and the warmest day of the year is around 84 degrees."
Lol yeah wraps like 10k.. yall.kray
Hmm... $2-3000 is quite the range. Not sure I’d want a $2 wrap...
"Ya, speed and wind play a big factor too. I went 70 (with a speed limit of 70) for about 40% of the trip. Then 55 another 40%, rest of way city travel.  I don't know what the winds were but they didn't seem noticable."
"They’re all hatchbacks. What is it that truly defines a crossover? I can’t quite figure it out. As far as I can tell they’re just taller hatchbacks mostly with an all wheel drive option. 

I would love a model x with normal doors and a roof rack. The Model Y is still way too small to replace my XC90. It’s really looking like my first Tesla will be a Cybertruck."
"Yup. World’s prettiest hatchback in my opinion. Almost as much cargo space as a Golf Sportwagen, but the seats aren’t really very flat at all. People still do a great job of sleeping in them though, check out #teslacamping on Instagram."
"In the case of the Model S (or Audi A7, or other similar cars) it's more typically called a liftback as a sub category of hatchback."
"I get what you're saying, they do look semi similar, but I don't think its a problem.
Looking at [This picture](https://imgur.com/7JNK1sz) thats currently on the front of the sub, I personally wouldn't confuse that with a Model 3. Maybe some would, but others probably said similar things about the S and X."
"I guess to be technical it would be a compact crossover. Looking at the Honda HRV (which I think we'd both agree, is a crossover, yes?) the Y is almost 10"" longer, and a few inches wider. Although seems to be about 2"" shorter. This is all based on estimated dimensions obviously, as nothing is officially available."
It's definitely a crossover - hence the name *Cross*tour. It's bigger than a RAV4.
There is a Tesla minivan. It's called the Model X. It's a bit pricey though.
Tesla deleted the chrome delete option
I hope you're right. I hope that the truck doesn't hurt demand for the Y too badly because the Y is an excellent vehicle too. We'll all be better off the more Tesla (and other EV makers) succeed in replacing as many ICE crossovers and trucks (and all other vehicles) as possible -- as quickly as possible.
Some soccer moms might be persuaded to settle for a truck if their family can save money by not ALSO buying a pickup...
"I was responding to your *aesthetics*.  It's not, at all.  Pure function dictating form."
"Have you looked up the price of an equivilant truck in the same class with the same features as the cybertruck...

The price amount is staggering... and that's what will drive ALOT of sales if anything.

The motorized cover could dump whatever gets in the slot underneath into the bed (the bed extends underneath it a little bit). And the motor could not give a fuck about how much dirt you get in there as it's power would just push it out/grind it to powder. I am sure Tesla knows of this and has a solution.

The car can lower itself quite alot so I think it will be easier to get into the sides than what it seems. As long as it's not too far towards the cabin. Also you have a good size frunk on the car that will store most tools, aswell as a side storage (the part that you complain is in the way).

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e06x83/images\_of\_cybertruck\_frunk\_and\_side\_storage\_bins/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e06x83/images_of_cybertruck_frunk_and_side_storage_bins/) 

Once workers that needs a truck in this class get this car, they will be spouting how great to everyone. And the people thinking about spending an extra 10-20k on a normal truck with the same features/class will think twice."
"People who aren't 1 percenters, I guess? The mean average car is 11 years old in the US. So... most people."
what the fuck are you on?
Isn't paint protective film still the recommendation due to Tesla's poor paint durability?
"Whatever you paid to have the wrap removed would have most likely paid for a very fancy heat gun, but even a hairdryer would probably have worked."
Depends where you are. 10k is ridiculously high in my area and also doesn't seem financially sensible imo given the cost of the car.
"That’s insane. I have a fairly large station wagon (volvo V70R), and I was quoted $1800 to wrap my car with 3m/Avery, or $1400 for the shop to use their in house vinyl."
"Mine cost me under $4k with a chrome delete and ceramic coating, and that was a shop with all 5-star ratings online. Someone tried to rip you off lol"
"A $2 (w)rap is actually just a dude who comes up to your car, spits some rhymes, then leaves."
What was the difference in Watts per mile between when you were going 70 vs 55? Curious
"It used to be that a crossover is an SUV built on a car chassis, while an SUV is built on a truck chassis.

Either way, I think the Y could be a perfect replacement for my Leaf."
Now I want a proper tesla wagon
That makes more sense
The Tesla model y is bigger? I need to see it in person if thats the case cause that shit does not look bigger.
The X is down right cramped compared to a minivan. Not enough cargo room. It’s like 60% smaller on the inside.
"I wonder if ""chrome un-deletes"" will become a thing on the Y now"
Are you 12 btw?
"Not so much - it's a recommended option if you are spending huge amounts on a car compared to what you would normally spend.  My Model 3 cost about 50% more than the BMW's and one Audi we've bought over the years, and *way* more than what I spent for Honda Civics way back when - and I intend to keep it for quite a while. So a extra few thou for wrap paint protection is worth it. A year in it still looks perfect.  (But then, we baby it, park inside at night)

Early into this winter, there is a small tear in the rocker panel film so likely it's already saved me from paint damage in a vulnerable place."
I havnt read that anywhere.... If you dont like rock chips PPF is great on any car though.
"I saw a guy advertising $1500 full wraps on Facebook. No idea how they actually turn out, but the cars here showcased look good in there pictures."
"Huh? We paid a little less than $5000CAD (so, about $3750US) for pretty much entire wrap of all the important areas. The guy had a wide-bed plotter with cutting head and patterns for all sorts of cars; a Model 3 (and not the first one) was probably the cheapest car he was wrapping at the time, and then ceramic-coat the wheels and unwrapped parts, after doing full clay-bar on the entire car in an incredibly clean workshop.  

And it took about 5 days including cleaning, and heat-treating the ceramic coating. this was a thicker plastic, for better protection, not thin heat-shrink to cover all sorts of compound curves. 

So unless you are wrapping for a colour change, I don't see it being that expensive."
Yeh but thats not vinyl. If you want it on a vinyl record thats $5 more.
"I was talking about the Honda Crosstour being bigger than a RAV4. Not sure about the Model Y, but the RAV4 is actually pretty dang small for a crossover. I've struggled to fit two suitcases and a stroller in one of those."
"PPF is great for any vehicle really, for so many reason. I'd say front only is a good option on most vehicles. For higher priced vehicles, including Tesla, I'd say full wrap. It is a bit expensive, but to have a fully protected paint job with fully self-healing wraps (like with SunTek), is worth it IMO."
Entirely possible. It all depends on demand. Places are charging 5k+ because people are paying it. It's not really 5k worth of work imo. A guy on Facebook might do good work but can't demand more because he doesn't have the credibility yet. You're basically getting a discount so this guy can build up his portfolio and experience. I might give him a try with some more research.
Hipsters...
I haven't but maybe you have much bigger stroller. Ether way the argument was the model y not Honda.
The argument I was trying to make is that there are already crossovers that are built on the same chassis as sedans and with similar looks. Guess we'll just have to see.
Don't Netherlands have tax initiative until end of year?
Pretty incredible that approximately 30% of Tesla's production is being sold to a small country that only makes up 0.2% of the world population.  Just shows the potential for sales around the globe.
And in Germany 🇩🇪 we have low sales and everybody says no demand blaaaa. Every fu;÷$¢ car in Europe is delivered to 🇳🇱 😁✌️
How many people live in the Netherlands?! LoL all y’all gonna have one by 2021n
[deleted]
Netherlands the new Norway?
"""There's no demand""

Sure buddy. Sure."
How does this compare to previous sales months?
And here in Ireland an order placed in September won't arrive until February
Demand problem!
"I'm actually in Amsterdam currently and I've never seen so many Teslas. They're everywhere. 

Every taxi I've seen here is either Sprinter van, or a Tesla."
"I spoke with my lease company Alphabet today. They were noticing a lot of problems with the way delivery is being done by Tesla. For the model 3 you are asked to go to the harbor where the boats with Tesla’s arrived. At the large parking lot you are handed you key and told to start looking for your car yourself and they wish you good luck. The lease company noticed above average incidents and accidents with these cars. Drivers are not instructed to the new way of driving. Alphabet offered to assist Tesla during the delivery events but were turned down by Tesla. 

I picked up my Model S at the assembly plant in Tilburg late November and there it was much better."
"Well, I'm glad they're getting their cars.  

I live a few hours away from the tesla factory in californa and have been waiting 8 weeks for mine..."
Meanwhile they delayed my scheduled delivery... hhughbbbb :(
how much do they cost in the Netherlands?
What else are they going to get their kids for Christmas
*disposable income intensifies*
"Got mine over a month ago. Deliveries are in the harbor. You get the keys and find the car yourself, check it and drive of. Model 3s are everywhere you look.

  


It took just 4 weeks to get the car. My home charger was installed this week. That took over 10 weeks.

  


I think charging will be a bit of a problem, as only 30% of homes have their own driveway."
🚂
"How times are changing; in the 20th century us Germans were complaining about the Dutch blocking our Autobahn with their caravans; soon we'll be complaining about them blocking our superchargers with their Teslas.

Just kidding...Germans like the Dutch, and they like Germans, they'd just never tell them. :-)"
My dad got one recently so that’s about right
How is the charge network holding up? Or is everyone just charging at home?
I think demand will ease of next year due to expiring tax benefits and see a shift from LR-AWD to SR+. If Tesla is really smart they would bring back the LR-RWD with a non-Premium interior option.

You go Fremont! Got a chance to tour the factory and one of us had shorts on. Denied. Damned Millenials...
But will there be any demand left after this quarter?!?!
And yet I still won’t get mine until March even when ordering in September
"It will be way more, because a ship full of Teslas arrived in Amsterdam yesterday, probably all for the Netherlands (normally they do European deliveries from Zeebrugge, Belgium, so I expect this to be NL deliveries only)"
I live in NL and waiting for import duties to be gone once the GF4 is open
....but at the cost of quality. Talked to a guy from the netherlands. Situation there is kind of bad.
"is the title accurate? Is it supposed to say  2500 Model 3s Per Month?

The chart show Model 3s about 600 per Week in Dec."
At that rate the government will loose 24 billion dollars in fuel tax over a 10 year period and that’s just from the Tesla’s. I guess they could tax each car $1500 bucks a year to cover the loss. Would a tax like that hurts sales?
I think so
They’re changing the additional tax liability for EV’s from 4% to 8% in 2020. That’s why we’re currently seeing a huge increase in demand.
"It's more about how Tesla makes and ships the cars for Europe and other continents early in every quarter, so they arrive before the end of the quarter. They then shift to make and deliver more for North America mid and late quarter.

It was mostly about how critics picked on their quarterly deliveries I think."
"Yes, and one thing to understand is they aren't doing it for the love of Tesla. Dutch people will jump on whatever has the biggest tax incentive, and for a while that was the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and no one is buying that for its driving characteristics. 

Entire fleets of severely underpowered diesel station wagons have been beaten to death over the years. They were the cheapest thing to lease."
Lots of potential but they still need offerings at a lower price point. The Model 3 is still way out of reach for most people.
"Rich country, big government intervention to push EVs in and ICE out. There is \_a lot\_ of potential out there, but as long as EVs are a luxury good growth will likely come from say the top 20 countries in this list:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_average\_wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage)"
[deleted]
Same in Norway!
Here in Germany Tesla is seen as the devil. The most hated car. Unfortunately.
"Well, there is demand for Teslas in Germany. Used ones from the Netherlands..."
"18 years at this rate for everyone in Netherlands to have one!

But only ~9 years for every household to have one!"
"Proud to be one of the first 20 on the EU to take ownership of a model 3 this Febuary.
At first it was quite a big deal, but then during the summer everyone started to want one...

We know good shit when we see it I guess!"
...or two or three!
"The tax cut will not stop, it’s lowered. The tax goes from 4 to 8%. Which is still a LOT lower than the 22% in non EV’s. I expect the tesla sales to drop somewhat, but still be huge."
"In 2020 all other ~20 states Europe will get cars again, even more, because no more Model 3 for China market need to be shipped. They can just build more Europe versions in Fremont so neerly every ship can go to Europe. Maybe they also send more ships to Australia and Korea, who knows. Will be interesting how net orders will change. Maybe they were up again even with 100.000 cars delivered.
Time will tell."
">is perfect for a lease car

>90% sold are lease cars.

You mean **company** car ;-)

Not all company cars are leased, and the tax benefits have nothing to do with lease."
The Netherlands delivered more Tesla's this year than Norway.
Netherland have almost 300% larger population then Norway and its 12.5% of the size. Netherlands is a perfect country for EVs in most cases. Lets hope they get more green energy to fuel all the EVs.
"You can see that here: https://www.kentekenradar.nl/auto/tesla/model-3/

This is the highest month of all so far and there's still quite a few days to go."
"I’m sorry to hear that. But don’t worry, you’ll forget the wait once it arrives. Ireland is the perfect size for EVs."
TOO MUCH DEMAND!!!!!
"> Well, I'm glad they're getting their cars. 

I taste some bitterness.

In The Netherlands deliveries started in march 2019, over 1.5 years after the US. And that was only the Performance and AWD variants.

Lead time for us is also 8-10 weeks. But believe me, it's worth the wait :)"
"So it looks like the Model 3 is so popular they're having a hard time keeping up with demand. That's good.

Stay strong, its an amazing car and worth the wait."
If you’re not too far back you should be getting it right before the end of quarter. Paint might still be wet though ;)
Oh no! I had been waiting for almost 3 years before I could pick up my AWD in the Netherlands. I suppose you could have reserved / ordered yours sooner?
"I have a couple friends that ordered at the beginning of the month, and neither of them have had their cars delivered yet either. They know they need to rush it and get it done by the end of the year though and I’m sure they will."
"Long range 60k
performance 70k"
"Standard Range+ = €48.980
Long Range = €58.989
Performance = €64.580
This is with the 21% sales tax included mind you"
Nederlands has one of the most extensive charging networks in europe.
Those are single days I assume
is about 600 a day so 2500 a week seems legit
[deleted]
The 8% will still be a lot lower than the 22% on non EV cars. Still a no-brainer to order a Tesla in 2020 if your lease contract is up for renewal.
Wait so if everyone knows they're gonna change it why are they all buying Tesla's now instead of waiting a few weeks?
The rancid American share price crap drives a lot of the worst aspects of capitalism. Along with the greed of share dealers.
Nederlandse gierigheid 🌝
A nice start would be simply adding the SR they already currently sell to the webpage.
"What is the attitude of people there with regards to buying used?   Here in Japan, used cars are not popular so us gaijin can snap up some good deals.  

And are used vehicles bought and sold across the EU or do they stay within each separate nation?"
"Right, but for now they're selling every car the make so this price is fine."
"It's much more, I don't think we will reach 10k, but easily 8 or something. https://www.kentekenradar.nl/auto/tesla/model-3/ is a ditch tracking site you can utilize"
400 per day average first weeks. And 600 average   per day last weeks of december. That's average 500 cars per day right?
Look again. It's almost 500 per day.
Oh you're right.. title is wrong
"Norway deliveries YTD: https://i.imgur.com/KfMC4Io.jpg

Why do German people hate Tesla? Is it simply brand loyalty to German brands?
"Pretty simplistic view IMO. There are a couple of challenges, one being many people can't charge at home. Then there's the high electricity cost and relatively limited state incentives. And the range of all EVs, including the best model 3's, is still lacking at higher (Autobahn) speeds."
"When I was driving through Germany from the Netherlands to Prague last March, all I got was a porsche that was surprised i could keep up, a motorbike taking pictures @ 120kmph,and a big thumbs up from a random Audi driver.

It's not so bad."
"Not how i see it. They dont like EVs in general, because they get brainwashed all day by german media. Tesla isnt the root of the hate. I have conversations about Tesla very often with various people here in ger."
It’ll be interesting to see if that position changes once [there’s a factory there](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Gigafactory_Europe)
"I think Model S is a serious competitor to Audis and BMWs. Model 3, I'm not so sure.

I've heard repeated rumors that Tesla is retiring the Model X at some point. I wonder if that's true."
Wonder if they will change their minds when the Teslas start to be literally built there...
"Wtf are you talking about? People love Tesla's they are only really expensive and that is why we have no demand. 50.000-65.000€.

It just not a wise economic decision to buy a Model 3 at that price even if it is a great car."
"Great job Germans. 

Love from Murrika :)"
"Maybe will change when made by Germans? Germans are really strange. Pro environment but anti nuclear to an extreme. Germans seem to have difficulty making logical decisions and tend to go with feelings which are easily manipulated. This was true in WW-II as well, their feelings were easily manipulated."
"Holy shit 41% of new cars for December are BEV, insane. Crazy that this BiK incentive is about to start in the UK (nearly 4x population) in just a few months too

"You sound like my ex, when we first started dating..."
"No bitterness at all...just a little jealousy :) I'm really excited for it to arrive

Another dutch redditor commented that he/she had been waiting for 3 years!  I cant imagine what that must have been like."
"I'm really hoping that's true, I keep checking my phone and email like a mad woman.  I'm just really excited and the wait is killing me :) fingers crossed you're right!"
Dang! Have you really been waiting 3 years?! Ok. I take my comments back...
Euros or US dollars?
"ah thanks, I misread the chart."
That killed EV sales in Denmark!
Yeah easy choice. I wonder what will happen if they’re both at 22% in a coulple years though.
It's a tax that's going up.
"90% are lease vehicles, probably company owned so guess it matches the refresh cycle"
The lease is normally 4 or 5 years for the current tax tariff. That is why you need to get it now.
"When you make a company publically traded and sell shares you actually open the company up to accountability and positive influence. Buying shares allows you to submit motions for the board to vote on.

Norway uses capitalism properly with this. They buy shares in companies in order to pressure those companies toward positive environmental policies and other progressive policies. There are people and groups who do this as well.

People only notice the negative aspects of capitalism though."
"In the US, virtually the entire population has a car and is required to basically drive it everywhere. So there is a huge market for every type of vehicle. That definitely includes used cars. Those are basically driven by most poor and middle income families. Also young people. We start driving at 16. Few parents would get a teenager that young a new car. So we don't see anything wrong with used cars. Majority of the population drives used cars for the first part of their adult life"
">The Model 3 is still way out of reach for most people.

&#x200B;

>Right, but for now they're selling every car the make so this price is fine.

Those are two separate issues... If they can continue ""sell every car they make"" at $39,000+, then that's all they're going to do for now, and that's good for them. But that means it's going to be a while before we see any sort of mainstream EV for $20k, and that's not necessarily good for the consumer.

At this point, I think reality is starting to sink in - if you want to change the world, you need to target the cheap economy cars, which are $20k, not $39k. And the gas savings doesn't really make up for the difference. Maybe in Europe but not everywhere.

I think they should do a 4th gen where they cut the price in half again, under another brand. But instead, Elon said we don't need that, he will release a $25k EV in 3 years with no steering wheel, and everyone else can just use robo-taxis. Which IMO is a massive sellout move."
"Yeah, but I think they could have delivered at least double that if cars where availible!"
[deleted]
"It's some of that, yes. People here feel attacked that other companies besides Mercedes, Audi or VW or BMW can make a good car."
"There are several reasons. The German auto industry is the obvious answer, but not the most interesting one. I often think that Germans are just rather conservative. They like to build up things slowly and securely. They hate revolutions, paradigm changes, leaps into uncertainty, risky endeavours, etc. In particular they dislike somebody like Elon Musk. Elon Musk makes them feel very insecure, because he does things in ways no German would do, and still he is successful. Germans have a deep distrust for that. They conclude that somehow he must be a fraud."
Also most cars sold in that price range are company cars and Tesla does not really offer anything in that regard.
"The car industry has been promoting diesels for decades as the most economical and ecological choice. Due to both physics (diesels are more efficient than petrol engines) and the German tax system (which makes diesels attractive for businesses), the diesel engine was seen as a “boring but reasonable” choice, something Germans just eat up.

I am German but live in the Netherlands, and the contrast is stark."
"Germans love some good engineering, they will come around eventually (and already are) especially with new factory. Tesla on some next level shit with their automation."
"So many Germans drive BMW, Audi, Mercedes etc. and all of those are 50k+"
"There’s a very strong car industry in Germany, BMW, VW/Audi/Porsche, Mercedes are a big deal, so there’s some understandable protectionist attitude just like in the US for GM/Ford etc"
"Why is anti nuclear irrational? The tech isn't needed any more, better invest in a renewable future. That they are messing up their head start in that area as well is a different matter (shakes fist @ Berlin)."
"My comment was a bit snarky, sorry for that. I did put down the deposit on april 1st 2016, the day of the unveil (Well the morning after; Dutch time zones).
I picked up my car as one of the first 20 Model 3 owners in Europe on february 7th, 2019. I did everything i could to get the car as soon as possible and still had to wait 2 years and 10 months. Just wanted to clarify :)"
He asked how much it costs in the Nederlands. We use euros here.
[deleted]
"Hopefully by that time EVs will be more competitive in price. There's no Ford Fiesta, or Toyota Aygo yet when it comes to EVs. Besides the initial purchasing price you'd still save a lot of money on fuel which is very heavily taxed. At the moment it's €1,78 per liter, which would be  almost $7,50 per gallon to put it in perspective for the Americans."
"The fact that you say that companies need to be pressured into doing what’s right and good, is an admission of failure. Tragically, exceedingly few companies are good corporate citizens."
"Thanks for the detailed post.  Sorry I wasn’t more clear in my post, but I was trying to figure out if, in general, the EU population had any issues with used cars."
"There's another larger issue that most people don't have a garage, and the use case for owning an EV without a reliable charging place is very limited at best."
"Elon had originally discussed making a car cheaper than Model 3, but there hasn't been any news about that for a very long time. Hard to say if they will do that. It is interesting though that there are three different Models at virtually the same price points. Model 3, Model Y, and Cybertruck.

When I say virtually, I mean after factoring in AWD instead of just RWD."
Maybe. I ordered mine in June and took delivery in late September. Haven’t really followed the waiting lists since.
"The outer bar is total sales. There’s three bars inside the outer bar, from left to right: S, X and 3"
"Blue is Model 3, Silver is Model X, Grey is Model S.   
   

[teslastats.no](https://teslastats.no)"
Sounds like Americans back in the 1970s when european and japanese cars entered the US market. We got over it. Now Americans just buy whatever car makes sense.
Fascinating. It'll be interesting to see if younger Germans exposed to the wider world through the internet will be as conservative. Tesla is bigger than Elon Musk (though he's still important).
"Yup, agreed. The leasing rates from Tesla Germany are very poor and as a compact exec the model 3 isn't practical enough over here."
"Because a 50k+ equipped Audi A5 Sportback is... a better and way more luxurious car with ""unlimited"" range.

It is not priced competitively in this segment.

 You also have to keep in mind that in Germany a kWh costs between 0.30-0.50€ you are not even saving money driving an EV."
"It's ok :) it was well deserved.  Cant imagine what waiting for 3 years must have felt like.  Do you love your car?  

I feel like a little kid waiting to open presents...the wait is painful, very day I check my email to see if there's any update, nothing yet."
What about taxes?
"I still wonder who will produce batteries for them, does northvolt have the capacity?"
"Dont hold your breath, i find it hard to believe that VW will mass produce an ev in a short amount of time. It isn´t a ICE, you need new manufacturing methods, sure it they will do it faster than tesla did it, but now tesla is better than anyone, and they are not slowing down."
My apologies. For some reason i thought you were asking about both the US and EU.
"In Europe at least, they're putting 240v plugs in lamp posts and parking meters.

The real issue is that battery factories are just being built way too slowly. Unless you want to wait until 2045, we need to start building 100 gigafactories right now."
"If by ""very long time"" you mean about 1.5 years, then you're right.

I definitely think the right move for Tesla is to do a Cyber-Y, just a cheap, smaller cybertruck/SUV."
"Hah, ordered mine in on July 1. and got it in September! But I do keep up with both the FB groups and elbilforum.no and it seems like there are many people getting pushed back to January now."

Well Germany does have a past of intense nationalism so I'm not sure if they will
You buy a shit ton of cars that doesn't make sense too.
"No, younger German people give a shit about being conservative. They are practically the same as us teenagers (social networks, new technologies, ...)
It’s the older generation that is afraid of everything (google German Angst)."

"Yeah it's been a pretty wild ride from the end of December last year until i was able to pick up my car. Very intense, not like any other car buying experience! 

I fucking love this thing! 
Just bought the acceleration boost for my AWD as well yesterday. 

It has changed my ideas on personal mobility. To be able to drive ""for free"" (in terms of CO2 emissions, of course it still costs money) for extended road trips is a total game changer. I literally drove 600 kilometers to western Germany and back last Sunday just because i could, and I wanted to test out my new winter tires. And that's 10 months after i got my car. The fun doesn't really wear off.

I didn't care about cars much, before I got my Tesla. Mostly because it felt bad driving an ICE vehicle, polluting the environment. 
Of course the car is also super fun to drive, but that's just icing on the cake for me.

Regarding your wait: It's just build-up for the big day. Believe me, you won't forget the day you got your first Tesla ;-)

However; Tesla can be a little shitty in the communications department (I think they are vastly understaffed for demand), so don't shy away from bugging them (phone or email) about your car if you have to!"

No problem.  Totally my fault and thanks again for your answer.  It’s good knowledge and I’ll bet it helps others reading the thread that were curious about the topic.
Was it really that recent? I’ve forgotten already
"Might just be deferred due to Christmas. Q1, Q2 and Q3 deliveries all peaked in the last week of the quarter, but that’s difficult now due to Christmas."
No worries. Couldn’t expect anyone to guess it without the legend.

you mean Americans buying impractical cars that dont make sense? or Americans buying cars based solely on brand loyalty?

"June 2018, at the annual shareholder meeting, Elon Musk answered to someone about a cheaper Tesla compact car starting at $25.000, saying that Tesla could release this car in five years when mass production of a new generation of batteries should be available, so 2023, ...Elon time, but even on this he is getting better and better, so wait and see..maybe a reveal event in spring 2022?"
"To be fair if the German manufacturers took EV's seriously 6-8 years ago instead of 6 months ago, they'd be able to be competitive, but instead they let themselves fall nearly a decade behind, and to be fair that is not just German, most American legacy manufacturers are the same, it's only the Japanese who really considered EV's with any sense of respect early on."
"Which is exactly what said, also us nationalism peaked longer ago than German nationalism."
Why not both? (But i was mostly thinking about the first one)
"That would probably shatter the market. 25,000... good god"

"Except for the truck market (Ford, GM, Dodge), most Americans aren't tied to US brands anymore. ""Buy American"" is long gone. We are open to any vehicle manufacturer from whatever country if the price and quality is right."
"I guess, but judging by your truck marked really says it all."
"But even in the truck market, lots of Americans drive Japanese trucks. (I drive a Toyota Tacoma)

Im not sure what we're arguing here. Do you think Americans are as brand loyal as Germans? I dont know Germans, but I will say that overall Americans are not really brand loyal. American car market is vast and varied."
From the geniuses that brought us Cybertruck Nuts. Respect.
"Tug of war is always pointless... But if we want to do the equivalent of the uphill complaint...

The Ford had an unfair advantage by the tow rope being higher at its end. The Tesla was pulling down on the Ford, giving it extra grip, while the Ford was pulling up on the Tesla, reducing grip for the EV.

Am I doing this right?"
"Something wasn’t fair here. Idk what, but the shorts will figure it out!!!"
Another user pointed this out but if you look closely the ford tether is attached higher so when both cars go the ford is pulled down giving it more traction.
you can tell this is fake because white is not a real color
Unfair test. The Model X won because it's designed better. Doesn't prove anything.
Who cares if one car's weight multiplied by the friction of its tires is higher than that of another?
[Elon Retweeted their tweet.](https://twitter.com/CybertruckN/status/1204844658297319425?s=20)
"I'm kind of surprised Elon didn't go ahead with Ford's proposed ""new"" tug of war anyway, just to make all the doubters shut up.

EDIT: Yes, I know Ford backed out. I'm surprised Elon didn't go ahead anyway"
Lesson: Tesla can win but people will still find ways to bring it down.
Someone please send this to Matt farah. All of his “facts” on joe rogans podcast we’re stupid. He clearly doesn’t like Tesla.
Is that the same guy who has a YouTube Channel about men’s style?
.... and comments how that’s not a fair fight incoming in 3-2-1-now!
Not fair.  Model X wasn't even pulling uphill.
Ford macho truck pwned by a “mommy car”. Love it!
"Raptor is probably \~200lbs heavier.

&#x200B;

Model X  P100D:  5,483 lbs

Ford Raptor:  5,525 to 5,697 lbs"
Should we try this with a Model 3 next? lol
Anyone know the curb weights?
Is that Jose Zuniga from TMF?
"And i got downvoted to hell, asking for a cybertruck v diesel contest"
That's a raptor right?
"The truck should have 400 pounds of sandbags in the bed and the hitches of each vehicle level with each other. This would give adequate traction to the truck without lifting the Tesla’s rear tires and handicapping it. 

DO OVER!"
"Pulling a heavy trailer a certain speed or up a hill in a contest would be more impressive and make more sense.  
Tug of wars are very flawed.  It's about traction.  If both cars have the power and torque to break tires loose, it'll be whoever has more weight over their tires or more grip on their tires.  You could give one of the vehicles a million horsepower and a million pound feet of torque and still have it lose if it had less traction than the other vehicle."
"Instead of pulling tail to tail, they should use a force gauge, or a tractor-pull sled.


That would be a fair comparison."
why is Tug of war a thing? Wouldn't a better test be to do a towing drag race?
"To be fair doesn’t any EV have an advantage.  Full torque at 0 rpm, no transmission to shift, much finer traction control, more even weight distribution, etc.  It can put more power to more pavement faster and control it better."
"I'm going to point out, the model x was at a huge disadvantage too since the hitches weren't level (i.e. the truck got leverage against part of the model x to get more traction while reducing the model X's traction.)"
If it can out tug their best diesel then its game over.
Bu- but that's just a test of grip! /sarcasm
"This test is still inconclusive. The actual tire friction force is going to matter more than anything else. P100Ds can use pretty sticky tires. The Ford could have been on some cheap all season for all we know. If you put drag radials on a WRX STI and 800AA treadwear tires on a P3D, a P3D has a chance to lose despite having 200ft lb of more torque while being heavier."

"I have no idea what constitutes a fair game of car tug of war but...

Wouldn't all of this be much more impressive if the Tesla clearly gave the advantage to the Ford to start pulling first and then the Tesla came back to win instead of the other way around? What argument could be made then that it was unfair?"
Can someone who knows cars explain why the Ford kind of farted when it gave up at the end. What was that?
Is that the guy from TeachingMensFashion on Youtube?
"From he guy who teaches men fashion?

These guys just got rich and famous off of cyber truck nuts and a video of an F-150 in a tow competition with a Tesla Model X. I need to reevaluate my life.
That's our boy Jose Zuniga!

"Devil’s advocate: Which one can tow 10,000 lbs further before refueling? I get that electric wins the torque competition, but doesn’t range also factor into the equation?

All these tug of war competitions feel like pitting a body builder against a distance runner in a leg wrestling competition and then declaring the bodybuilder to be the better athlete.

Just tell us the estimated range while towing a reasonably heavy load, Elon."
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzKCJsou10w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzKCJsou10w)
Traction control is just way better on the Tesla. Notice how the rear X tires move in short bursts.
[deleted]
What the fuck is the point of this?
This just tells us the Michelin A/S 3 is a better street tire than the (I assume Nitto) mud grappler. Should really be a surprise to no one. I will say this is at least redneck level which is more than you can say for the one shown in the debut. The vehicles arent on the same price point and are aimed at different tasks so even with the OEM tire on the Ford it would likely lose. They do offer the HO 3.5 EB in a Lariat with a more street oriented tire but still an all purpose truck tire which I assume the Cybertruck will follow. If you did them both on performance summer tire where traction isnt as much of an issue then I'd say it could go either way. Specially since the truck has a 4x4 low.
Yeah but it wasn't the raptor the best f150
It’s all good fun and this is ofc far from scientific but they tyre difference makes me scream inside. Use same tyres and I am interested.
"They should try that with a diesel pickup vs the cyber truck. Put something made for towing and hauling against the Tesla and see how it holds up.  That raptor is absolutely useless for hauling anything, and it’s a v6. I’d still assume the Tesla would win but it would actually be a REAL test."
"I’m not going to hate on the torque because I do believe the Tesla would hold its own, but this test only proves that the Tesla has better traction control. The first vehicle to have its tires spin will lose. Every time."
Gee so the tesla still weighs more.
"I can assure you this display will not be a consideration when I buy my next vehicle, be it Tesla or otherwise."
Jesus. If Tesla really wants to do ACTUAL marketing campaign against Ford they can run the Ike gauntlet against an F-150. These “tug of war” videos are just plain stupid.
Only problem is the Tesla just lost 15% battery
"when I get a cybertruck, I'm getting disco balls"

Ford being higher would put more weight on back axle increasing normal force and friction. Tesla would have some of it's weight and therefore normal force transferred to Ford
"Can someone who understands physics better than me confirm if this actually had an effect?

Edit: Thanks to everyone for responding, it's pretty obvious now that I think about it.. I have an exam in the morning that's taking up all my mental resources ☺️"
Wouldn't this effect adds weight to the truck's rear tire helping him win? If the tesla is pulling down on the ford then obviously its pushing downwards on the tires of the truck helping him in some way.
Giving Ford rear tires more traction but front wheels less.  Since 4WD probably negligible overall effect.
"here's beto talking about the cybertruck vs ford thing: 

https://youtu.be/jzKCJsou10w

he has some reallly good points and overall, i think that the stunt was a 1/10. Just like the stunt with the [ford pulling a train](https://youtu.be/Au3U72CX74I) is stupid. they're all marketing gimmicks."
It wouldn't be any more of an advantage of the electric motors having 100% of their torque of the get go where as the gas powered ford would have to get its rpms up before it got all of its torque
"Pointless because Tesla always wins,,?"
What about gravity?
"Truck weighs less, also higher center of gravity causes a disadvantage of the truck.

Physics. Lower center of gravity with weight being more... gives you more control and grip"
It also seemed like in the video that the tesla started pulling the ford before the ford started driving if you watch closely which is unfair. They both should have started driving at the same time.
"The Tesla also had an unfair advantage with street tires vs the all-terrains on the Ford. 

Until one of those vehicles makes the other vehicles tires turn backwards, the test is traction limited.

Edit: I love being downvoted by people who can’t disprove my statement."
"All this really helps prove is that one is more massive (re: mass) than the other. All other variants like an incline just change normal force a tad. Not enough to the extent you’re describing. 

Mass goes to normal force which goes to friction and traction. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jzKCJsou10w"
"Staged.  CGI.  Probably shot in Australia, so physics are reversed because it's upside downs.  And it was outside, so you can't tell but there was wind.  And the Tesla guy's beard was more aerodynamic.

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind internet person!  My life suddenly has meaning"
"To be fair, tires make a massive difference. The Ford was on all terrains."
"lol typical low-info Tesla circlejerk.

Tug-of-war is literally entirely determined by who weighs more. That's it.

All this proves is that the Model X weighs more than an F-150, which is public knowledge."
Are there any large shorts left still?
"Normal force is only half the equation with traction. What about the friction coefficient? What kind of tires were used? You could probably put racing slicks on a hatchback and a truck couldn't pull it.

The Model X probably does have better control over it's torque and more of it, but the test wasn't really 'scientific'."
"It's sort of true. Considering the angle of the rope, the up/down forces are negligable, in my estimation."
You shut your whore mouth!
Performance summer rubber vs mud grapplers doesnt hurt either. I used the Pilot A/S 3 that come of the Model X on my Mustang and could easily do hard launches on it. Havent put mud grapplers on it but I've driven them in trucks and its absolutely a category below in street performance. They do much better in mushy offroad terrain.
"The Model X P100D after the recent $30k price cut starts at $105,000, while the F-150 starts at $28,500. I like Tesla and all, but comparing the torque of a car with electric motors and an $80k higher sticker to a pickup truck is just stupid."
"Right? But don't forget to use the same drivetrain in both, would unfair otherwise!

And same chassis!

And same cars!"
The Tesla only won because it was better at the task!! /s
This proves which vehicle is better to pull a car out of a ditch in a real world situation (the pickup bed is empty)
I'm confused. Which is heavier?
And who cares how big the vehicle is? Obviously some people do
"The Raptor is 200lbs heavier, so there is more to it than weight."
[deleted]
People that drive in the snow maybe?
"Except it's not just down to that surely?

Tesla's electric motors adjust by the millisecond for any loss of traction. Every millisecond of slip is waste that could have been used to drive the vehicle forward."
"The Ford could have more power but not be able to utilize it. Think of putting it on ice. Same deal, friction = ability to push off ground."
I think it was Ford that backed out
Ford backed out.
Elon said bring it on. Ford backed out.
"Most likely because if Tesla end up with another tug of war, people will claimed it's because of Tesla's home court advantage(as in they rigged the system, the rope, the ground, the F150..whatever excuse they can come up with).

&#x200B;

Having a third party doing it gives the competition more credibility because it's not from a company's own PR department. You know Tesla or Ford for that matter will only post a video on their website if they WON. So unless there's some world tug of war car championships Elon can go to with third party validation of the competition, the other side will always cry foul."
there was never a proposed tug of war by Ford.  It was just some Ford VP talking trash and no ability to act on it.  Then  Ford PR had to get involved and explain that this Ford guy was talking out of his butt.
Yeah I mean if you want to tow a load and drive more than 100 miles that’s so stupid.
It also seems like Porsche is paying for him to advertise the Taycan :shrug
"I didn't get that impression.

I think he likes Tesla and doesn't like headless Tesla lovers.

And he likes an electric Porsche even more.

I don't see anything to take issue with. His points about cooling and track experience are valid, as far as I'm concerned. Doesn't mean he hates Tesla."
"Ok, but lets face it.  These cars are _not_ built by people who love to drive.  I mean, if you make self driving cars, you obviously hate driving right? Clearly Tesla has zero happy car buyers. 
  
Also, the Cybertruck you saw as a prototype was just a simple Tesla ""skateboard"" with a body thrown on top.  Anyone can make a demo like that.  
  
Also, they'll never be able to manufacture it, I don't believe it.  
  
Also, all of those deposits were just a scam."
"Most automotive journalists are dumber than the average automotive engineer.

"Yeah, Jose Zuniga. I used to watch some of his style videos way back in the day. They did this on him and his brothers vlog channel (The Zunigas)."
The Model X wasn't driving uphill! How is this fair comparison?!
"Its not fair because....

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

because....

&#x200B;

because...

&#x200B;

Oh F-it.   Can't think of one now"
TiReS WeRe CoLd...
Not fair because Tesla is better!
Its really not tho. There are tons of variables here. Also the tug of war test is pointless
"All that you are ever going to find out doing this on asphalt is which one is heavier. On dirt you'll find out which one came with better tires. 

If you want to measure torque you need to load them down. Weight in the bed or speed greater than 2mph."
Not fair. The Tesla has four wheels.
"I don't think a Model 3 would win, simply due to the weight (or lack of). Power can only do so much without enough traction, and the weight for sure helps with it. It would still be fun to see though!"
"I think the raptor is a little bit heavier, most f150 configurations are lighter than an X"
Similar to the model X. Still unequal because of the differences in tires (street tires vs all-terrains)
"The engine doesn't matter if the wheels are spinning, at that point you're beyond your traction limit and what is used to spin the wheels doesn't matter."
"Someone else said it's not, just modified to look like one, pretty sure if it was they would've said"
I think the whole point of this was to tug a stock Ford.
"Did you notice how the Tesla pulls down on the f150? And the f150 pulls the Tesla up? Should be an advantage for the f150, but still doesn’t win."
I think that's the point
Should also point out that it was at a huge advantage having street tires instead of all-terrains like the raptor.
what does that even mean? F750? ford semi truck?
"And torque available at 2mph. A 2wd John deere D could out pull either of those with all of about 50hp, because it's like 8000lbs and geared to go about 1mph in 1st. But would you want to pull a trailer down the freeway with that?"
Looks like the raptor is on some chunky all terrains.  Pretty solid disadvantage.
"either too things will happen, the momentum of the ford will cause all tires on the tesla too drag making the amount of traction the model x has reduce majorly giving the ford the upper hand by allowing it to have all of its tires pull without slipping. but if the model x dead stops the ford it might cause the tires on the ford to start slipping giving a chance for the individual tires on the model x to ""crawl"" forward without slipping eliminating the possibility of being dragged back. as soon as the model x gains momentum the fords inferior traction control is going to cause it too waste power spinning out.

&#x200B;

personally i think the ford had the advantage, it had bigger tires for better traction and its hitch was higher causing it to lift up the tail end of the model x reducing its RW traction."
"Dude, it's a soccer mom SUV outpulling a Ford pickup truck.. isn't that embarrasing enough?"
Sounded like a turbo bypass off to my ears.
"Look up some model x towing videos. No issue towing the rated weight limit up long hills, but it chews up the battery fast."
"As someone from North Carolina, we have truck pulls every weekend.  It’s kind of a big deal."
When you don't understand safety factors and the loads involved
">  If anything snapped or was ripped off with the amount of force on that, then the girl could have been in serious harms way.

Lol, no. They used a proper strap and mount points, this is no more dangerous than towing a trailer."
"I think it's pretty obvious to everyone that you're not supposed to do this, that's why we're watching it on the internet"
"I don't think anyone is saying the cybertruck (or model x in this case) is automatically better at all things because it can pull with more force. just like good 0-60 time does not make a car better in any other way.

tug-o-wars (tugs-o-war?), are a macho truck thing, like a drag race for cars, that then got hyped beyond belief by all of the talk about how a ""fair"" tug would go."
"> Which one can tow 10,000 lbs further before refueling?

The Ford can.

Another question: Which one can tow 10,000 lbs 200 miles for less then $10 in fuel costs?"
"More importantly, which could tow 10,000 lbs cheaper? That's all that matters in business."
I'm pretty sure the curb weights for these two are pretty close.
Yeah I wish it wasn't all blacked out so we could see it better.
Could just be operator error.
"Yeah, I was waiting for something to catastrophically fail too. Either the tow cable to snap and ricochet through the back of the vehicle, or the tow bar/ back axle to break off."
"F150's ~~are on~~have an aluminum ~~frame~~body (i.e. bed), not steel."
To get internet people to talk about it
"Both tires end up slipping, the Tesla's traction control responded a lot more often to it and gaining traction inch by inch after the momentum was gone."
That is a Raptor tho.
"The Raptor isn't the 'best' F-150, at least not in the context of this test."
"diesel has nothing to do with it. it's not like the F150 didn't have enough torque to turn its wheels against the Tesla's force. it's a competition of weight, tires, and traction control. everyone knows it's a useless contest of who weighs more, but truck people still do it because it's fun and macho"
It's a stupid contest to begin with.  It's a traction contest.  You could have a million horsepower and a million ft pounds of torque and still lose against the other vehicle if you had less traction.
"Yep. Pointless test all the way around. Even ICE truck vs ICE truck. Tires make as much of a difference as the power output, if not even more. If the F-150 had racing slicks on instead of AT/MT's, it would have been a much more difficult task for the Tesla to win. It still probably would have won, but it would have been much harder."
EVs have the best traction control!
But isn't what this test is about? They are showing that Teslas are the better vehicle choice when you need to pull something heavy.
And that it’s heavier.
you sure? because that lift on the truck is causing it to lift up the tail of the model x causing it to reduce traction/weight.
BETA MALE!!!
It’s not Tesla’s ad.
Bet it didn’t even lose 1%
"Umm, no. 

15 kWh is enough for me to go 75 miles in my Model 3."
"15% of a 100kWh battery is 15kWh. 

Let me put 15kWh in perspective. 

The test lasted 8 seconds. If we consumed that amount of energy in that time, that works out to 6750 kW. Tesla’s drivetrain is about 90% efficient, so that would be 6075 kW at the wheels. In imperial units, that is 8147 horsepower. 

So, if your assertion is correct, That would make the Model X nearly as powerful as three diesel-electric locomotives in tandem. (about 9000 hp)  No wonder the Ford lost."

Truck nuts go along great with the dick driving.
They are in some states
Agreed. It's totally obscene.
"I'm glad that the high class folks here at /r/teslamotors are downvoting you into negative. 

The contrast makes me happy. Also Trucknuts are amazing."
"This is correct. However, these tests are done by truck owners all the time and it's an absolutely silly display that does not show off any kind of capability by the winner/loser. This has to do with weight, contact patch of tire (footprint) + tire compound and differentials (locked, LS, open, etc) and in that order. People who know little about trucks for some reason think this is a display of engine power and drivetrain."
This is a real thing in tugging.
"This is correct.

But it still didn't mean a whole lot. Basically Tesla was able to get more grip out of its tires, likely because it has tires suitable for road use, not those ridiculous knobfest tires like the Ford has."
Yes. There is a vertical component to the tension force.
(Tesla+gravity) > Ford
Hopefully an exam on rope pulling and trucknuts!
"Think about moving an object. It's easier to pull an object at an angle >0, than it is to push down on that object at the same angle. So because the ford's hitch is ""higher"" than the CT, when it pulls, it is pulling ""up"" on the CT; and the CT is pulling ""down"" on the ford which is basically the same as trying to push down and move an object.

edit: meant X not CT."
Good luck on your test
"Yes. I did a quick calculation based on a 3 degree angle, and I think that gives about a 10% advantage to the truck."
"So not exactly true. So the normal force would be impacted on both cars. Meaning the ""grip"" would be proportiately worse for both cars meaning traction would be 100% fair.

BUT

Since the normal force is not vertical, the component parallel to the ground would be pushing both cars ""downhill"" helping the lower car. It should be slight but certainly not negligible, especially since the effect impacts both vehicles and only helps the lower one."
"Yes, the vehicle with the higher hitch point has an advantage."
That was my thought.
"You do have to consider that the Ford has a Torque Converter and a transfer case meaning it’s capable of building massive torque when the wheels aren’t moving and the converter stalls. 

If the transfer case in engaged into low range, the torque is multiplied by ~2.6x, though at the cost of speed (which is good for off-roading)"
They've been pointless fun for longer than Tesla cars have existed.
Yes it’s lighter on the moon.
"Someone needs to tighten the rope. If they both went with a slack rope it'd snap.

Also the Ford has a huge advantage because the type is attached much higher than on the car"

"The kerb weights are similar: 5,525–5,697 lb (2,506–2,584 kg) for the f150 raptor (I assume the upper end of the weight range is for the larger cab vairent used on the test), and 5,531 lb (2,509 kg) for the model x P100D.

Tires are also quite important. I would guess the p100d had super high proformance tires on it that were a lot stickier than the off road focused tires on the raptor."
So... Tesla wins a tug of war? Gotcha
"I think it boils down to traction. Witch is a value achieved via fancy math where yes weight, but also tire size/contact patch, and I'm assuming rubber compound are all figured into the equation."
So Tesla CARS can pull more than any Ford truck?
Ah so nobody should complain about sharing NHTSA's prob of injury for the Model 3 because that doesn't take into account its weight difference between trucks. Oh wait...
"Yeah, people are missing a big part of this, which is the ability to apply torque in a controlled manner.  If you cannot do that, then you risk spinning the wheels, which means you will lose all of your grip instantly.  The way Tesla's prevent wheel spin and precisely modulate engine output gives them a huge advantage here.  The Ford's ""naive"" 4x4 system basically has no chance but to just revert to sled mode and hope that the Tesla can't actually skid all 4 tires at once.  Because as soon as he mashes the gas, he is going to break the wheels loose and lose the game."
"Watch the video again, as soon as they go you see the truck bed get pulled down. The X doesn't seem to be affected."
"Looks to be about 5 degrees max, which means the vertical component is going to be the tension on the rope times the sine of 5 degrees, or 87lbs for every 1000 lbs of tension. In other words, about 435 lbs. So if the tesla weighs over 870 lbs more it's still going to have an advantage. How about putting 2000lbs in the bed of each and seeing which one wins?"
"I don’t think that’s the point. The Cybertruck is built on a Tesla platform, but more powerful and heavier. 
Basically, that means that if even a P100D is able to pull the Ford, then that will be peanuts for the Cybertruck."
"Yeah, Tesla should make a gas powered car to make things even.  It's not fair they get to use an electric motor."
The point isnt that the Tesla is unfairly better at the task. Its that the task is a completely meaningless metric of no practical value.
If that's so important a good kinetic snatch rope is going to make a bigger difference than any curb weight total.
A heavier vehicle will always win though.
Or a tree stump!
"The Model X weighs 800 lbs more than a short-bed supercrew F-150 4x4 like the one in the video. Assuming similar dry friction the Model X is absolutely going to win, because tug of war is purely about who has more friction to the ground.

This entire thing is a ridiculous dick-measuring contest to win the hearts and minds of the douchey BIGTRUX crowd over to Tesla. It seems to be working, so I guess that means we can all look forward to Cybertruck owners being unutterable cunts on the road."
"Until either vehicles tires start turning backwards, all you are really comparing is weight and tires."
"I see this repeated often but after watching the Model X off road, as well as the Model X vs H2 tug of war, this supposed ""sub femtosecond torque delivery"" isn't really a thing. It scrabbles, spins the wheels, then stops, then spins, on a pretty relaxed timeline. It's not even in the same universe as, for example, a full time mechanical AWD system, nevermind locked differentials for off road use. Yes, in theory it could probably do that to avoid any wheelspin ever and always have maximum traction. In practice it doesn't do it. Until the theory lines up with the practice it isn't a real benefit."
"Friction is the sole determinant of who wins a tug-of-war. Given that the Model X weighs about 800lbs more than that F-150, the outcome was obvious."
"As some other kind people explained to me in this thread, the X's hitch is lower and it's pulling down on the Ford, helping the Ford gain more traction than it otherwise would have."
"The Telsa electric motors have massively more torque at very low speeds. At very low speeds they can push almost 7,400 lb-ft. That's ""wheel"" torque not engine torque. One of the reasons Tesla's are so fast off the line."
"Giving OP the benefit of the doubt, probably meant that Elon should have run the test without Ford’s consent since there is 1 Cybertruck and tons of F150’s."
"Well yeah, simple physics show an EV should be the winner basically every time until you get a semi truck in as the dino burner!"
"It wasn't Ford proper that initiated the challenge, it was a VP of a company that Ford recently bought."
Who reps ford then if their own VP's have no valid say?
"The car has a range of around 250 miles. The car isn't made to tow this, so the range with load will be a lot lower.

Calculation time! Let's calculate the range fully loaded. Because I am not from the USA, I will use kg, but I will convert it to pounds on the end.

Weight of the car: 2500kg
Max weight: 2250kg(pulled from the back)
Range: 400km

400km=2500kg  
?km=2500+2250kg  
let's round it up to 5000kg, which is double the weight of the car. This (theoretically) halves the range of the car to 200km.  
so fully loaded, with 5500 pounds of weight, the car still has a range of 125 miles.

And I know you would never pull this much with the car."
"Farrah showed respect out of fear of backlash while simultaneously trying to damage Tesla’s brand image. The big one for me is the “you can promise cars all you want without having to deliver “ while the fact of the matter is,  Tesla has fucked up their time lines, but has NEVER undelivered. They haven’t  ever promised a vehicle that was never delivered . Most of the time the vehicle was better than promised. 

This dumbass will wait for a new corvette he’s never seen for 2 years, then cum all over it when it comes, but if Tesla announces something two years out, “it’s never going to happen” 

There is an idiots bias to account for in this situation."
"Come on. He had like every little detail about why the  truck pull wasn’t fair. But he couldnt bring himself to admit the most basic fact: even if all those factors were fixed (whether they are really unfair or not), the cybertruck would’ve still won. It’s very hard for an ICE vehicle to win a head to head battle with an electric motor vehicle as this video just displayed perfectly."
"Yeh no don’t agree with that. Watch his one take video and note how many times he takes snipes at a ‘company that doesn’t want you to drive’ vs a company ‘that wants you to drive’ 

Something along those lines. Clearly he’s been personally insulted by Tesla’s efforts in automation compared to Porsche’s lack of. He feels like something is being taken away from him"
"Dude did we all watch the same video? He called Elon an idiot. 

As far as the track goes, I get it that he enjoyed the Porsche but to act like they did something revolutionary is bullshit. They built the car specifically for the track. What happens when Plaid comes out and blows the Porsche away for less money? Will this tool have anything good to say?"
"Are you just regurgitating Matt Farah points? Because that’s basically exactly why he said. Is there a Fox News for anti-Tesla people now? 

You sound so jealous of Tesla drivers. *clearly there are no happy Tesla drivers* Did you miss the /s or something? I love driving my Tesla. In fact, I would say test driving a Tesla is the number one cause of most people buying them. I don’t have to enjoy sitting behind the whee for 4 hours, making love to my stick shift. The fact is that I need a car and I need to drive long distance sometimes. Yes- autopilot is badass for those long, exhausting drives.  I shouldn’t even respond to this garbage.

How are the deposits a scam? It’s $100 and totally refundable at any time. If you’re not happy with it, just get it back. It’s just holding your place in line. 

People said Tesla would never build the model 3 too. How’d that work out?"
I thought I recognised him but couldn’t quite put my finger on it! Thanks
My point exactly! ;)
I hear you... best one I heard was “it’s unfair since the Tesla is clearly better- you should only compare vehicles that are similar!”
"Its unfair because the tesla went first, the ford does not have it’s diffs locked, it also has chunky off-road tires and the tesla probably has high performance street tires. Also the tug of war proves literally nothing. Maybe who has the best tires"
I think that having Full Torque at 0 rpm is enough of an advantage to slaughter most any 4 wheeled ICE vehicle in a tug of war. All that wheel spin does not help with grip.
You forgot “/s”... ;)
Might have to run heated drag tires
[deleted]
"It actually makes a huge difference what engine is used because of the availability of torque

Tesla has all available torque immediately and others take awhile to catch up, tesla should win everytime"
Diesel engines typically weigh more than a petrol engine of similar power. More weight is an advantage.
"Yeah, what's the point if you have to modify the vehicle for it to win."
Good point.  Traction control of Tesla using millisecond-level electric motor torque modulation may be a major factor here.  Glad we are drilling down to this.
"I mean sure, it's still a truck with an empty bed.  I don't know the weight each vehicle had over each tire, or the specifics of the tires themselves on each vehicle...but it's not like the truck didn't have power to turn its wheels.  Think about it for a minute.  Are you trying to say the truck had more traction than the tesla?  If it did, then why did the trucks wheels spin and not the teslas?"
Semi vs semi! Here we go!
"It looks like a modified F150,  not a raptor. So it likely weighted 500-1000lbs less too."
This.
"Yeah I guess, just as a Tesla fan we all know it's a beast not a mini van. Just saying to shut everyone up, clearly show the advantages of the ford and then still beat it."
And I’d guess the truck would regain a good amount of range going back down too.
That's what EE explained. He didn't say that it couldn't. Just that EV don't have the energy density to be efficient at doing so
"Your point is well taken.  It just feels like that’s the implication a lot of times. If people are just enjoying it for what it is, I’m a happy camper."
">  just like good 0-60 time does not make a car better in any other way.

Good 0-60 times can make a car much safer to drive.  Acceleration is not pointless in real life driving."
"It’s a valid question and strongly highlights that ICE and EV both have benefits in the truck world, especially if you place a lot of value on your time."
I was gunna make a joke about the Ford breaking down and needing to be towed so it uses less than $10 in fuel costs but nothing clever came to mind.
Don’t forget that time is money.
No it's an aluminum body on a steel frame
Hmm. Ok.
"That's not entirely coincidental. The Raptor is geared for offroad use where wheel slip is beneficial in loose gravel/mud/snow conditions. So its definitely beneficial for it to favor keeping wheel speed up. Think of rally cars and baja trucks. They never throttle back speed. The Tesla on the other hand is designed with street use in mind. The tire thing definitely helps overcome this. My Mustang is just over 500hp and without the right tire I have to constantly baby it. With the right tire (MPSS PS4 is my new go to) I can stand on it during dry conditions and it just sticks, the TC doesn't even need to kick in. Suspendion geometry and stiffness also plays a factor. If the Tesla has the magnetic style shocks it definitely has an edge there. The Tesla will always have better T/C as it has the ability to modulate power much quicker but with better traction you don't always need to rely on T/C. With gearing the Raptor can easily output more torque. If it can put down more initial grip it can definitely go the other way."
But it wasn't a *real* Raptor
Yeah that's a f150 raptor but I meant a raptor on the f150....Elon said 1000 dinosaurs or something??
"Tires, traction and weight all play part in the tug of war but the Tesla makes all its power instantly since it’s electric. The v6 raptor makes 500+ lbs @ 3000 rpms which it will never reach while being instantly pulled by the Tesla. A 6.7 power stroke make  860ft lbs @1600rpm. It would make a difference although the Tesla would still get the jump on it."
"The test here is: if you just takes both cars as they are on the road, and have them do a tug of war, which one wins. Now we know. 

Show me any other soccer mom suv that can do this."
At 2mph. Show them trying to pass a semi with a gooseneck.
"I did the math, it's about 430 lbs added to the truck and 430 lbs taken off the tesla, assuming about 5000 lbs of tension in the hypotenuse and an angle of 5 degrees. 

But you'll also notice the ford spins it's wheels rather haphazardly. There is a difference between static and dynamic friction; this is why you can use the front brakes to do a burn out, even in a car with a 50/50 weight distribution.

All that this will ever prove is 

1. Which one is heavier

And to a smaller extent,

2. Which one has better tires
3. Which one has a better driver.

If you want a test, have a timed 100+ mile circle track race with a 10,000 lb trailer. Or a straight 1/4 mile drag race with a trailer."
Lol. K.

In all seriousness doesn’t the Tesla have twice as much torque than the ford here?
"this is the first EDM song I ever heard, back in the days when that kind of music was just called techno, and I fell in love with the genre

however, on limewire it was labeled under Daft Punk as the artist, and I'm not sure if this is correct or not, do you know who the original artist is?"
I'm sure they do too.
These guys just had the balls to start the business.
that’s interesting to me. like a law specifically for truck nuts? i’m not a fan of truck nuts but i don’t like the idea of a law being enacted to say you can’t have them
"Whatttt some people don't have any sense of humor truck nuts are hilarious!

Edit: Since I'm getting downvoted so much now, I'm definitely buying a set of cyber truck nuts for when my cybertruck order comes in!  I bet y'all are fun at a party."
"Oof, you underestimated how much Reddit loves reverse psychology."
"> it's an absolutely silly display that does not show off any kind of capability by the winner/loser

This has to be a *little bit* of an overstatement. Are you saying my little economy sedan that can barely make it up a steep hill might have a chance to win a tug of war against the cyber truck or a 4x4?"
Tugging up or down both work for me
TIL “Knobfest” can describe either tires or certain music festivals!
Tesla TC is something else.
Wrong
By CT do you mean the X?
Hey thanks!
"No, this is gibberish. Draw a free body diagram and you'll see that the tension in the rope can be resolved into two forces - parallel to the road and normal to the road. The parallel forces are equal and opposite, just like the normal forces. Now apply these forces to each vehicle. Each is being pulled backwards while the Ford is also being pulled downward and the Tesla is being pulled upward. Upward/downward forces do two things - change the angle of attack of the vehicle due to suspension and change the traction available (because force equals coefficient of friction times load). The Ford, being higher, will have a net increase in downward force and traction, but applied primarily to the rear wheels. The Tesla will have the opposite. Both vehicles are 4wd/AWD so the suspension effect should be negligible as both vehicles are traction constrained, not power constrained for this type of stunt."
"I'm pretty confused by what you said..

Wouldn't the normal force pull down on the higher car and up on the lower one, slightly improving the Ford's traction and slightly reducing the X's traction?"
There's less...
Pretty sure it was ripped straight from Twitter
Superior traction control.  Thats one of the reasons Tesla's launch so well.
That video isn't of the raptor. The F-150 supercrew 5.5ft bed 4x4 weighs about 4700lbs curb.
"Considering the Model X tow rating is 4980lbs, no. Not even close."
"Yes

https://youtu.be/LQBRyR1JGBo

And 

https://youtu.be/Fr4-JZxFJ2s"
"The Model 3 doesn't weigh anywhere near as much as the Model X, do you have a point or are you just bitching at someone for spitting facts?"
"the equal and opposite force would apply, so an upward pull on the X"
"You would see that sort of tilt happening even if the rope was horizontal. Imagine a soft-suspension car accelerating: it tilts backwards despite uniformly horizontal forces applying.

In my comment I was just thinking as an engineer, where I'm used to sin(small angle) = practically zero.

But however much my error is, it all goes in favor of the Tesla, which is who I'm rooting for. Not sure about all the downvotes :/"
Yeah. Let's keep modifying the test until the gashole wins!
"Torque for the top model Cybertruck is estimated at around 1,000 lb/ft, so not far off the ~920 of the P100D. It’s a ridiculously high figure, no doubt, like crack the earth’s crust in two when ripping up a tree stump levels of ridiculous, but it’s not exactly a surprise.

Electric motors in performance vehicles make huge instant torque figures, it’s not exactly news. Anyone who knows anything about cars could have predicted this video’s outcome."
We should probably start cloning the same driver.
"There are going to be lots of these kinds of “tests”. The practical value is the changing the mindsets of people who do not like having their expression of masculinity destroyed. 

I think it is ridiculous too. But completely necessary. After all, we would all like the lifted rolling coal set to be driving around in EVs in the future.  This kind of thing is the ONLY way to achieve that."
0-60 would like a word...
"All metrics, tasks and indeed life itself is meaningless."
"Unlike parts of a second differences in 0-60 or max speeds above what's legal on roads, how well a car can pull heavy shit seems like a fairly useful metric. In a sea of useless tests, this honestly doesn't seem that bad."
It's very practical and the reason most truck owners carry tow straps in their trucks. Just remember to keep a tow strap in your Tesla as it could come in handy. There's a zillion uses for tow straps and this shows the Tesla is probably capable of pulling strained vehicles out of ditches and fallen trees off roads.
"I’m an engineer, and this ‘task’ pisses me off.

All it shows is that a Tesla drags can drag a heavy object with locked wheels better than a F150. This isn’t something anyone should care about.

This just in: a rear wheel truck with sandbags in the back can pull more stuff..."
And electrics are heavier by default. So electrics win by default. Just like a Model T beats a horse carriage by default. A win is a win right? Unless you want to add sand bags to your ICE truck bed to level the playing field?
They said it was the raptor? Published weight is a lot more than you have quoted.
At least they cant take the muffler off of their Tesla...
Raptor weighs 200lbs more than the Model X in fact.
"I think the problem is slip is still controlled through the same exact system in place in many regular cars, an open differential with the brakes simulating a limited slip differential. An electric motor can apply torque to the differential faster, but controlling where that torque goes is no better than an average ICE.

If you get rid of the differential and have the motor directly connected to the wheel, which we may see in Rivian's 4 motor vehicles and on one axle of Tesla's 3 motor vehicles, then maybe we will see some noticeable improvement."
"Saying it many times doesn't make it true - others have already pointed out to you that the tailpipes indicatw it is a raptor (ok, they could be fak I guess).

The primary difference is tyres, the ford isn't well equipped for on-road grip. Worse traction control doesn't help either."
And yet that still isn't enough downforce because you can see the ford's wheels slipping meaning it isn't getting full traction.
"4x4s have a low range gear box that makes this fact irrelevant. Tug of war is about friction. If you weigh more, you win. That's all there is to it."
They need to show it can pull every truck in the Ford line-up.  Lift up the Cybertruck rearend and lower the front end and see how an F-350 fares.
He did and Tesla absolutely owned it’s - pulled the f150 uphill.
"There is no such thing as ""the"" VP for gigantic companies. It's A VP."
welcome to bureaucracy. The cornerstone of capitalism.
"I don't' think bureaucracies like Ford operate that way as everything is carefully calculated and vetted for their image (or any of the legacy automakers for that matter).

It's the reason they still make internal combustion engines.  Too much bureaucratic momentum to make any sort of big decisions.

Plus this guy wasn't even a VP in charge of F150s.  I believe he was in their mobility division."
"I agree that Tesla's delivery timeline generally gets a bit too much criticism and too little credit.

But I would also say that if, say, Audi has delivered 50 promises in 50 years, and they make a new promise for something to be manufactured they next year, it's fair to be sceptical and to hold them to it. And if Audi was notorious for being late but delivering, it's fair to mock them for it with timely due credit.

By Elon Musk's own account, they were close to going bankrupt when they manufactured the model 3, and were saved by the genius tent idea. This makes it seem believable that Tesla is indeed in need of at least some sort of hype to convince investors to push through inevitable hardships. 

Without knowing, whether that's the case: if that's the case, I don't take issue with that. If Tesla needs this to not go bankrupt and build amazing cars, I hope they keep doing it, because I want a model 3 myself in the next few years. And if Tesla delivers again in however much time, then there's nothing to be worried about. Right?

Edit: *then"
"In fact I think there are two fsctors.

1) people need a full year to accept a new design.

2) can only keep a secret with 100-200 people. Once you get into asking thousands of people to keep their mouth shut.. someone spills the beans."
"I think the point is more that if the Cybertruck would have still easily won in a fair fight, why not stage a fair fight? Why twist the odds in your favour and risk tarnishing the credibility of the test?"
"He had the right to criticise facts that tipped the favor to the Cybertruck. While I think the cybertruck would win a fair fight, organized by viewers, too, I was a little bit disappointed myself that Tesla didn't at least employ a 4WD Ford in their video, and that they twisted the camera in that weird way. I would have preferred some less cinematic looking approach, like the succesful steel ball throwing tweet that Elon shared not long after the event.

Again, I think Matt is more concerned with the loudest kind of Tesla fanboys, who are not willing to question the slightest thing that Tesla does."
"I mean... Teslas are fun to drive for anybody. And an electric Porsche is on top of the list for candidates that are even more fun to drive.

Making the ""technically true joke"" of Teslas and their autopilot (which is an amazing an unmatched value proposition by far) shouldn't count as hate towards the brand imo.

Consider this: how many times have car enthusiasts been sad for Lambo or Ferrari to have switched from manual to an automatic transmission? They do it all the time. It's quite often the difference between ""a modern _brandname_"" and ""the last true _brandname_"".

Is the modern version not a true _brandname_ car?

I think you're taking this specific comment of his too seriously."
"Tesla's goal was always to show the world that electric is better than ice.

I feel like Porsche having abandoned ice to stay ""in race"" with Tesla is more than enough achievement and proof that Tesla is revolutionary.

I don't need Tesla to stay ahead of all electric cars too. Model 3 is still an unmatched value proposition. The luxury sector in contrast isn't that interesting to me. I mean if we're building racecars, and Tesla brings a 5 seater plaid sedan family car, then why is it so unexpected, that some oldschool racecar manufacturer might beat them by a thin margin? To me this takes nothing away from the value of Tesla as a company."
"My dude, clearly my comment was sarcasm.  Calm your tits."
It's pretty rude to attach nearly any vehicle to a Ford.
"Ice vehicles are fitted with a clutch or torque converter, allowing the to generate torque at zero wheel rpm. Clearly the torque generated was enough, otherwise the wheels wouldn't have spun."
Something something telsa best car elon is my dad
How do you tell? it has the raptor tailgate and dual tailpipes
Not really in a tug of war. Which is why tug of wars are pointless.
"This is wrong.

Basically every 4x4 with low range makes enough torque to spin the tires. No advantage in having any more.

Response time is also unimportant. Engine can be revved up prior to releasing the breaks."
"The raptor outweighs the Tesla by about 200lbs... the weight is pulled down on the rear axl, all this should be in favor of the f150... maybe other tires for the ford? Maybe traction control isn’t that good?

But let’s just be fair and say that this looks dumb for the pickup... anyway we try to spin this, it’s a soccer mom suv pulling one of the toughest and most popular pickups."
Model Y vs Semi - let's see it
I think you might be right. The fender flares aren’t body color on a raptor.
"I don't disagree with you, but I place a lot of value in having money. 8-)

Honestly people all arguing like there's one vehicle that solves everyones problems.  We all know that isn't the case.  If one did we'd all be driving it.  The reason there is so much variability in the auto market is that the market serves near infinite use cases.  

What works for you might not for me, and vice versa, and that's fine.  Don't fall for marketing, and buy what does work for your needs and you won't be let down.  That could be gas or electric.  To each their own."
"Funny story.   I used to own a '93 Ford Econoline E350 van.  It was super shitty but was great for van-camping.  The last summer I owned it, I blew the radiator on the way home from a camping trip, thankfully just inside my 150 mile AAA+ towing limit.  I had to get it on a flatbed trucked from where I broke down to my home.  The whole experience was crappy, but hey, at least I saved myself about $50 in gas not driving that 150 miles."
"Don’t forget that fuel  and maintenance is money

You've probably seen long queues for cheap gas."
This is what I meant. I was trying to refer to the comment above's discussion on the bed and only mentioning steel.
The Veloci?
"Put 5,000 lbs of gravel in the F150, it will pull an X or a CT no problem. This is purely a test of available friction, of which the Teslas have more because they weigh more. An F250 might win against a CT just because it's heavier, not because of it's engine."
"it's not about torque. if you put more weight in the F150 and good tires tires, it could easily pull the cybertruck. clutches and torque converters are designed to allow you to pull things from a stopped position. the only advantage the cybertruck has in that real is finer control for better traction control and a quicker start"
"Any mom car with a similar weight to the truck and sticker tires. 

When you run off road tires on a pickup there are a lot."
"You're missing the point entirely though. As I said above, the Tesla would win anyways, due to it's ability to provide traction better than the Ford. But tug of wars are completely useless tests of ability."
I know what static and dynamic friction is. I also know why the tesla won. I dont want a test where i know the results. The issue with towing is the drag will absolutly eat up battery life. But why are the test focused on towing range and not capability? Because you just want to point out where the teslas are weak.
[deleted]
You made the claim it lost 15% so actually you’d need the citation lol
"Not sure about that. My poorly researched numbers  show the model X rated at 600Nm, which is around 490 ft-lbs. the 3.5 eco boost F150 is around 470 ft-lbs. 

Of course, engine rpm, gearing, and tire diameter all affect torque at the wheels. Then we move on to weight distribution and tires, and other fun stuff.  

I was just trying to clarify how much energy 15% of the battery was."
It’s called “Shiny Disco Balls”
"Sure, but seeing them hit against the truck is just *painful*. I cringe every time I see them."
"You and I have wildly different ideas about what constitutes ""hilarious.""

I don't care if people have them, but I wouldn't call them funny (or even vaguely amusing.)"
I'm so confused. what happened?
Tug of war isn’t won by whoever can pull the hardest. It is won by whoever can push off the ground the hardest.
"Absolutely, if you weigh it down enough. There are clapped out Supras pushing 2000HP. 

To your point, sure, it doesn't prove *nothing*, but what it does prove is very little. Which of the two vehicles in the video can tow more? The Raptor, and it's not really ""meant"" for towing and so is at the lower end of the scale compared to other available F150s. The way the reactions to Tesla's original tow video are going you'd think the CT can tow 50k lbs. I mean it's so far and away superior, not even close, right? But not really. It can tow only a little bit more than an F150, and only the $70k version at that.

So in ""tug of wars are fun"" terms the CT seems like a beast. But it doesn't really translate to anything meaningful in real life. A Hummer H2 destroyed a Model X but that doesn't mean you want to drive one. A 100HP steam tractor can destroy the CT, but likewise doesn't mean it's a ""better"" vehicle for day-to-day use. Unless your day-to-day is tug of wars I suppose."
Depends on situation. A regular pickup in 2 wheel drive has wayyy less traction than people think. I’ve seen lawnmowers beat them in tug of wars. Cyber Truck is a different story because the electric motors give it more torque and thus a big advantage
Oh my god! The hammer pulled you off?
I think there’s a separate forum for that.
Something I say every night in bed.
Or house parties I tried to organize in college.
"Yes, sorry!"
"Literally, exactly what I was saying, but perhaps I'm less good with words."
"So the normal force would actually push ""up"" perpendicular to the ground. How much it ""leans"" downhill is how much it helps push said car down hill. In this case it appears they are both slightly pointing down and this would help the Tesla. But maybe the camera is being held crooked."
"Here we go, this shows it better. :)

https://images.app.goo.gl/ftUmwBV6DjEafZPK7"
it has dual tailpipes and a raptor tailgate tho
It is a Raptor
They say it is a raptor in the video.
You tried
Tow rating is more related to braking ability tho.
"So the model x can tow as much as a human

"In the case of the NHTSA results, the short argument was ""absolute risk is what matters"".

In this case, absolute towing capacity should also matter."
Which would benefit the Ford.
Yeah let's test an empty truck against an empty truck.
Just use identical twins.
The Stig = Jango Fett! Confirmed!
"You're absolutely correct. I drive a diesel f350 that's tuned, different turbo and makes about 1200 ft/lbs. 

I enjoy the idea of an electric truck that has 1000ft lbs, I spend 300 a week on diesel for the work I do. If I could cut that out it would be pure profit.

I'd like to see an HD cybertruck with the option of a service body in the back, I expect it will come before long."
"That's probably correct.  All car marketing is aspirational, and every automaker likes to talk up useless aspects of their car to buyers who will never use the capability.  And I would love to see a world where people who buy impractical, low-efficiency trucks switch over to impractical, high-efficiency trucks.  (I'd rather see more housing near public transit but the good ol boys in the central valley arent giving up their culture any time soon (n.b. I assume everyone in this forum lives in CA).

What I cant figure out, though, is why Tesla made the Cybertruck look like that.  If they genuinely wanted to convert over roughnecks in North Dakota, they could have used their existing design language.  This thing is going to alienate large swaths of the truck buying community."
The flip side is that it will be very difficult to pull the Tesla out of these same situations because the same thing that allows it get such good traction against lighter vehicles makes it harder to get unstuck (weight).
"Given equal tires, if a slightly heavier vehicle has 50 horsepower and the slightly lighter one has 500 horsepower, will the latter win?"
"This just in: a rear wheel truck with sandbags in the back can pull more stuff... 

Except with an electric drive train you don't need the sandbags in the back to pull more stuff..."
"It's kind of a win...but not really in the grand scheme. More weight is a bad thing. It's not supposed to be an aspiration. If Tesla could cut 2k lbs out of their vehicles they'd do it in a heartbeat. Then in that alternate universe we'd be hearing about how of course the Tesla lost because it's lighter, and also it doesn't matter, and also what idiot wants a heavy car just to win tug of wars?"
It doesn’t appear to be a raptor. Raptors have black plastic fender flares not the painted ones like the truck shown.
or roll coal
">Saying it many times doesn't make it true - others have already pointed out to you that the tailpipes indicatw it is a raptor (ok, they could be fak I guess).

The fender flares indicate that it isn’t (Raptors come with black plastic fender flares).

> The primary difference is tyres, the ford isn't well equipped for on-road grip. Worse traction control doesn't help either.

You are right about the tires. But no traction control system can allow you to beat a vehicle with more mechanical grip, because even with your breaks locked you would get dragged."
"Theres a ton of other factors. Even with low gears most trucks can't apply the power evenly though the power band on each tire, so they start chirping and loosing Traction. Massively grippy street tires can change everything. A dragster can pull 5G's and some good steel tires and pull over 2.2G's while a Truck might be spinning its wheels at 1 G and with most trucks the traction is different in each wheel and the balance can't be computer controlled near as precisely an electric car with multiple motor and traction control that reacts in milliseconds. If the Telsa has a torque advantage, grippy tires and the ability to put a proper distribution of power at each wheel. It can out-pull a much heavier truck. Besides the P100D weights less than that Truck, My F350 Diesel is over 8,000 pounds on the scale. I think that F150 weighs in at 5,697 lbs dry."
"also redo the Tesla ModelX vs Alfa Romeo drag race with a cyber truck drag racing the fords while also towing them. 

https://vimeo.com/253258542"
Because it weighs more.
"So you somehow missed every popular discussion about how that tug-of-war was basically set to win in Tesla's favor, and wasnt actually a scientifically balanced t-o-w? 

I'm a tesla fan and I'd still like to see a proper balanced tug fest."
"Ya, thats why i said ""VP's"""
"> By Elon Musk's own account, they were close to going bankrupt when they manufactured the model 3, and were saved by the genius tent idea.

Citation please..."
"I agree with your premise about the pulling video. But let’s be honest - no one really cares about it. It’s just a marketing gimmick. 

But I don’t think Tesla fanboys aren’t willing to question things. Look on this subreddit. People complain openly about the service issues and many other things. 

The difference is that Tesla fanboys understand that this is part of the process to creating something new and better in the automotive market. If it was easy, the oems would’ve done this by now. It’s very hard to execute the plan that Elon and the Tesla team have done...double hard because they didn’t have a footing in the market to begin with. So maybe the fanboys are willing to deal with some startup issues to end up with a better product, at a better cost, that’s significantly better for the environment? That what I think anyways."
"I can offer an anecdote. I was an early employee. He said “even if Tesla produces one million cars per year, that still is only one percent of global annual car production. We won’t solve global warming on our own unless we get everyone else on board”.

I shit you not, the internal rally cry was not only does Tesla have to be really good to survive, but we have to drag everyone else with us."
"Learn to use /s, noob."
"Thanks, TIL!"
Definitely not full torque tho
"No, there is a significant power loss and if the clutch or torque convert is not locked. Also peak torque is generally in the ~6k rpm range, holding that while slipping the clutch can seriously fuck it up. The diff on the ford arent locked, so it was just enough power to break one wheel loose. All the tug of war test is is a pissing contest to see who has better tires"
"

Go look up the definition of torque. Just because you spun tires doesn’t mean there is power there

A fuckin 79 Chevette can spin its tire"
Amen
"the frame is the structural part, though. so that's the part taking the forces"
"Yes, that's the one.  It's the only Raptor that the Cybertruck can't defeat."
"The heaviest 2018 f150 come in at 5,697 lbs while the Heaviest Tesla is 5,531 lbs according to google. While it ranges they are about the same weight, the truck is 4x4 and the Tesla is awd, and both are on the same surface."
"...it's a truck. Tesla touted towing capacity and 'crazy torque', whatever that means, but completely ignored gear ratios. If the ford has 300lb-ft of torque, the tesla has the same, but the tesla is single speed at 9.75:1 and the ford has a 4:10 transfer case and a 2.88 first, that's not the same torque. Being single speed, I wouldn't be surprised if the tesla could barely spin the wheels, but that really doesn't matter since it has that same torque until 40 or 50mph, when the battery or motor inverter becomes the limitation.

>But why are the test focused on towing range and not capability?

Because that's how trucks are used. If you're towing something 100 yards at 5mph, you get a $15k tractor, not a $40k truck.

If you want to test two empty vehicles designed for completely different tasks, put the tesla against a top fuel dragster or the tesla against a moped. Doesn't tell you much. Even two trucks loaded with the same amount of weight would be a better test."
"Marketing does not equal ads. AFAIK, Tesla has a marketing budget."
Lol. EdUcAtE YouRsElF.
I’m just jacking you off man
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8yME7uHU_s
It's even more painful if you're the truck
You've never seen a baby blue Toyota yaris with the tiny ones made for motorcycles.  They're blue to match the car.
Sure.  But that _also_ determines who can do the most real world towing...

I had a very special and intimate relationship with this hammer
Take my upvote for the unappreciated Thor: Ragnarock comment
Captain Hammer pulled someone off?
r/Tugboats ?
Also British motoring shows
They're both on flat ground. I still don't understand. Is it the tires that are 'pulling' the car up and creating this weird physics dynamic that I'm not familiar with?
Something something cgi
"So? Braking is a pretty important part of towing, and driving in general."
It looked like they did?
"Eeeh don't count on it. The CT seems to use structural body panels unlike a conventional truck, so you can't just make a service body."
It would sell like gangbusters if the battery didn’t deplete in cold weather and there was stations to fully recharge in 20 minutes every 150 miles. Electric torque has been considerably proved since trains have existed.
"The short answer to your question is “because they are a tech company”.  Disruption is the best (and sometimes only) way to break into a market.

Imagine for a minute that Tesla put out something that was more like the original Hummer. To my eye, the most badass truck, with the possible exception of a Unimog. 

How many people bought Hummers?  How many would by an EV Hummer?  Lots maybe, but nowhere near what Ford sells in F150s. Otherwise history would be different and everybody would be buying Hummer-like vehicles.  They are interesting, but not THAT interesting. 

Now imagine they bring out a regular looking truck?  They know that by the time it’s for sale they’ll be competing with Ford, GM, Rivian, and others. What would differentiate them?  They don’t have the marketing dollars or market share of Ford!

The Cybertruck is disruptive. It re-thinks just about everything to do with a pickup.  If it works, Tesla has created an entirely new type of vehicle and everyone will be playing catch-up. If it doesn’t work then they will have invested some R&D dollars on something and can write it down. 

Tech companies have an appetite for risk. Automotive companies generally do not."
"Truth. If they wanted to actually sell this to “roughnecks” they would create a version with a tray bed and 500 mile - any temperature range with rapid and regular recharging. 

If Tesla wants to take over the “urban contractor” truck department they should manufacture a 500 mile 3.5 door tray bed with  a free charging system to any commercial company that buys 5 or more."
[deleted]
"Generally for this test, no. The heavier vehicle wins as at low speed adhesion is the limit, not horsepower.

The higher horsepower can’t be used. If you try, the wheels slip.


Edit for more details:
Good graph here: https://x-engineer.org/projects/vehicle-acceleration-maximum-speed-modeling-simulation/

Search the page for “Image: Wheel forces”
That green line is the limit the car can’t physically exceed. The heavier the car, the higher the lone."
The drive train doesn’t matter. How much you can pull depends on the weight of the vehicle and the types of tires.
"Oh for sure, if Telsa could get a 20% lighter battery for the same capacity at a reasonable cost they would do it in a heartbeat. But we're comparing 2019 tech, not 2025."
"Think about it like fuel economy. Your argument could also be applied to the Model T and horse carriage comparison if argued ""more gasoline is a bad thing. If Ford could make the Model T use 20% less gas they would."" Okay, but the current Model T is still better at pulling things..."
It has dual tailpipes and a raptor tailgate
You somehow missed my comment above saying ford backed out of the “new” and more fair competition.
You just did.
A random VP has no power unless he's part of the right business unit
"https://youtu.be/wSRuF0U-2Ao

It's the first 23 seconds, that I intend to use as source. I know Elon has joked a few times that they've gone bankwupt, but in this short clip I believe he means it.

Building the tent and employing a big number of people to mitigate overautomation allowed them to keep manufacturing the cars without a lengthy restructuring, as far as I know. Here's a video about that:

https://youtu.be/p1w2m1c7kvE"
"Lol. I'm a mechanical engineer, as you would expect I am quite familiar with Torque calculations.

With regards to power, it is irrelivant here. The goal is simply to move forward, not do it quickly.

I don't know old American cars, but most cars are these days can spin there tires when stationary. More power or torque will not allow such vehicles to pull harder when stationary. Only more weight,   of traction with the ground will allow this (stickey tires and awd)"
(I do hope we soon get to the point where electric can do everything gas can today though)
I think there's probably a Jurassic Park documentary in the future that will prove you wrong.
The tyres don't match. I would guess the p100d has Stickey performance tires.
"you got me wrong. the Cyber trucks towing is not something unheard of or that impressive in retrospect. i dont care about torque in a tow battle, its irreverent (tire traction, weight, and traction control are bigger factors).

trucks are not exclusively for towing ,we use a bunch of utility trucks at my job but we are rarely towing anything and when we are its around 7,000lbs under 100 miles. if we had too tow a excavator thats too heavy or far for a cybertruck we use one of our dedicated TOW trucks since our standard f-150 would be under powered also. not all trucks are the same nor do they all serve the same purpose. you have too look at what the CT is trying too do as an electric pickup truck. towing for distances would be a huge plus but personally i think i would make better use of the CT's payload of 3,500lbs because we often transfer pallets of concrete blocks on our truck beds. the biggest thing about a truck is that it has a proper bed for storage and the CT definitely hits the marks for a basic truck design. plus the battery allows you to have proper 110v and 220v connections which is great because we always have too use a diesel generator at job sites do to remoteness. 

&#x200B;

their is not a single car we can actually fairly compare too the CT because of how unique the vehicle operates. like how an EV having a bigger battery pack allows it too output more energy making it faster while increasing its range and getting heavier at the same time, a gas tank does very little for performance based on its size. or EV's in generally having better city millage than highway. also i dont know what price/value you can put on rust proof since the CT is the only one doing it."
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"I refer you to my previous comment.

It's possible that actually seeing it might amuse me somewhat, but I just don't find the concept remotely amusing."
"Engine torque is normally quoted at the flywheel before any gearing.

Typically the bore and Stoke ratio of the engine pistons determine if it's high torque or high horsepower."
That sub was neither of the two things I thought it might be...
That’s racist!
"Not out of this one, no. But I don't think this will be the last truck they build"
Maybe not fully charge but you can get a good few 100 miles of range on the v3 superchargers in half an hour
"And of course they say the CT is easier to make, all flat panels, everything pared down to the basics. They can get them out first, which is  a huge advantage."
"Yeah they definitely act like a tech company in terms of marketing.  I think that mentality is the polarizing force - old line automotive execs resent the arrogance and attendant valuation multiple, while others like to see disruption.  The perception of risk taking is also required to justify their valuation and keep money flowing in. I took a job at a SV startup a couple years ago, after a decade and a half consulting for old line manufacturers, and I recognize the playbook Tesla is running every day.  If they DON'T take huge risks, the entire business model falls apart. 

Anyway, despite that, I still can't tell what the theory of the case is here for the Cybertruck.  Potential scenarios:

- It is intended to disrupt the existing pickup truck market and woo buyers away from established players.  This follows the theory of all the breathless articles like ""Tesla takes aim at Ford profit sanctuary"" and such.  With previous products, they competed by meeting customers where they are.  The Cybertruck doesn't really meet customers where they are, so in this scenario, the styling play looks a lot more like The Edsel than anything else.  Trying to gain significant share with an EV truck will be hard enough, so putting this styling on top of it doesnt make much sense. 

- Same as above, except Tesla concluded that they have little chance of breaking into the market at all without a flashy and kind of ridiculous opening move.  In other words, the Cybertruck isn't really intended to be the end game in pickups for Tesla, but instead a niche/marketing vehicle to get people talking.  Put some weird features like bulletproof glass on it and give it respectable truck specs in the torque and towing areas to allow fanboys to defend it, and stage some marketing stunts to get the incumbents defensive.  Play into the disruption narrative, take reservations for only a few bucks to show interest, and investors will be lining up to finance it.

- It is intended to convert non-truck buyers, thereby accessing a new market segment.  We all know the stereotype Tesla buyer as trading up from a 2002 Camry; do more of that but with a truck.  Give it enough truck specs to allow some defense, and add cool but useless features (like bulletproof glass) and features non-truck buyers care about (like 0-60) to get people excited. 

- Just up and design something you think is cool without thinking too much about it.  This would be Softbank-level reckless and I kind of doubt this one.

I'd guess some combination of 2 and 3, with 1 as a future aspiration.  Mostly I'm not sure how cynical to be :)"
"> The Tesla's are lighter than most trucks.  

No shit. I would expand sedans to be lighter than trucks. The Model X actually weights more than most trucks. I bet my next paycheck that the CyberTruck will weigh significantly more than the heaviest ICE half-ton (aka F150, Silverado 1500, Ram 1500, etc for those of you who don't know). 

&#x200B;

> The 2020 Ford F150 weighs 5,859 to 7,725 lbs 

Where in the mother-fuck did you get this number?

[The heaviest F150 (a fully spec'd raptor) weights over 100 pounds less](https://www.google.com/search?q=2020+F150+curb+weight) than the ***lowest weight you listed.***

The F350 isn't in the same class at the Cybertruck as it can tow 50% more weight than a trimotor CT can, so I'm not really sure what your point is."
"And torque. You can have a 14,000 lb curb weight truck with mud tires, and it won’t pull anything if the engine doesn’t have enough torque to move both its own mass plus the mass of the payload."
"Electric drive trains weigh more, both vehicles can use the same tires so they are a mute point. Electric drive train wins by default unless competing against a much larger ICE truck to match the weight difference. Or you sandbag the F150."
"Yes but...the CT in this example is not better at pulling things. It's slightly better, at the top trim level. If it was 20% better sure, but it isn't. If it was, the tow rating would be higher. I don't personally care as I never tow anything that heavy, but there is no way to spin a tug of war as proof of anything beyond winning a tug of war. Weight is still a bad thing, it's not a positive overall just because it helps in one artificial scenario."
"It also doesn’t have a raptor body (at least a stock one). So either way it’s been modified. It’s possible to swap a tailgate and add an exhaust but it’s also possible that they just changed the fender flares (though I don’t know why they would, I think these look bad)."
"It wasn't Ford proper that initiated the challenge, it was a VP of a company that Ford recently bought."
You know how they were weighted?
no power? whats the point of a VP then.
The velociraptors are in the Ford’s gas tank.

"Nah, it was the beard that did it"
"Agreed, but any vehicle that can spin its wheels (with traction control off) meets this criteria"
"Car metrics such as 0-60, tow capacity, engine displacement don't really many anything to most people. The average F150 is a commuter vehicle... These types of slight advantages that 80% of people don't use are how cars are marketed and sold. This gimmick is no different. The Tesla has more traction and is better at pulling things. If you wanted to pull a school bus in a race. Which would you chose the X or the F150? Meaningless to most people? Yeah, most metrics cars are sold on are meaningless to 80% of customers. I'm sure you have plenty of examples of metrics that matter to you and why you bought your last vehicle. The fact is the buyers attention is valuable for sales. These videos have created a lot of buyer attention for practically no cost to Tesla. If Ford could post a youtube video of an F150 pulling a CT uphill you can bet your ass they would."
https://youtu.be/VPNoXa-Lb_k 2:50
"Are you implying that they added weight to the model x?

I mean come on. Model x is rated for 3500, that ford for at least 10000. It’s not even something designed for towing."
To run his or her business unit
"I completely agree. I don't see this mindset on the sub often enough. Usually it's ""Tesla is better at everything and you're an idiot if you don't have one."" The mindset that everyone makes personal decisions based on personal needs and preferences is a much healthier one. Sometimes that includes Tesla, sometimes it doesn't."
"A Ford rated to tow 10,000 pounds still weights hundreds of pounds less than a model x. Add offroad tires to the ford (which reduce on road grip) and it would still lose even if it had 10 million horse power and 1000 foot-tons of torque."
"I'm suggesting that the vehicles are not equally weighted. Not whether or not their weights were modified. I would like them to be modified such that they are equal.

Then it will be a balanced tow test. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzKCJsou10w

Enjoy"
"It's easy to get caught up in the hype or hate and that's intended. All manufacturers are looking for advantages, regardless of how slight or trivial that will separate their vehicles from the competition in the minds of buyers.  This is physical domination. Arm wrestling for vehicles if you will. Useful? Not to most, but its hard to argue that a stock F150 pulls better than a stock Model X. Fanboys will make this go viral, haters will help by engaging with the content. GM dreams about generating this much virality over a product launch."
"Some people just cant math. Or just dont want to. 

I would sincerely love to see an evenly balanced tow test. I assume it probably wont happen until the Cybertruck actually launches and someone does it themself."
"Let’s say you add weight to the f150, and the f150 wins or model x, what does that prove?"
"For any of these tests to be fair, they would need to start by first trying to tow the vehicle with its brakes fully applied. If the vehicle skids (like I am certain both of the F150's in F150 vs tesla videos would) that means the amount of power/torque it has doesn't matter, because it doesn't have enough traction to keep from being dragged to begin with. If the vehicles are evenly matched, it comes down to the amount of power and how its distributed to determine a winner.

At the end of the day ""tug of war"" between trucks are kind of dumb because the electric has huge torque to begin with and the ICE has a torque convertor that turns moderate torque into a massive amount during stall (aka when you are at very low speeds under load) that can even be further multiplied by a transfer case (though the ICE loses its torque converter advantage as speed increase and the converter locks). This results in both vehicles likely having more power than they can actually transmit to the ground

A better test (that the Tesla would actually fairly win) would be accelerating while towing a trailer."
I’m not sure what conclusions you would want to draw with such a test...
"It only proves that one is heavier and/or has better tires. Both vehicles have more torque than they can actually apply to the ground. 

I think you would have to exceed both vehicle’s (and their tires) GVWR to actually provide them with enough traction for them not to spin their tires.

It’s a poor test of capacity. A better test would be accelerating while towing a load, which I am sure the Tesla would win. A static pull, I actually think the Raptor would likely win due to it having a torque converter and a 2 speed transfer case to multiply its torque."
"I cant tell if you're doubting me, or sincerely not sure."
"Exactly, everyone’s trying to find ways to show this test isn’t fair, when it fact is it is meaningless.

Like most pull tests you would do."
Read below. The tug of war test is pointless is where I am getting at.
"I started buying last year at $253, then it went up to $373, was tempted to sell, but did not. Then it went downhill, then more, then even more. Because I have such faith in Elon Musk, I kept buying more,  more, and more, even when it bottomed at $178. Now my average is $219, and I am sitting on 75% profit margin on TSLA alone, enough to buy myself a Model 3. So TSLA will be paying for me next Tesla :D."
Kicking myself now for not jumping on during the dip.

"I went in on TSLA last year when it was at about $266.  Sold right after the whole Elon smoking weed with Joe Rogan fiasco at around $322 not because I lost faith in Elon (quite the opposite, actually), but because I had a feeling it was going to drop for a while after that.  Waited patiently for the drama to subside, then went back in again almost 2 months ago near the beginning of October this year at $245.  Worth it!"

can someone explain to a dumdum like me why this is so interesting to the market? Far as i can tell Tesla doesn't have a demand problem. Aren't they sales constrained on battery production essentially?
It’s going to be the short squeeze of the millennium.
"Bought in at 212, still buying.  My position averages out to be at 244 a share.  It’ll go up slowly but surely, every paycheck I get, I buy more shares."
"There is 0% chance of this EV subsidy bill passing, why investors got excited on this news is beyond me."
"Wishing all the TSLA SHORTS a very Happy Holiday!   Tis the season for giving, and TSLA STOCK OWNERS thank you for your generosity."
"got in mid-80s, feeling pretty good"
I’m sad I sold with cybertruck unveil. Especially because it’s since grown on me. But god damn did that initially look like a train wreck.
I think 70B is a pretty high market cap for tesla to justify at the moment. I’m a long investor and won’t be selling but I def think there will be some stock price slide back from where we are at.
"Current price includes expectation of Shanghai ramp up and Model Y ramp up. So substantial price increase requires the GF4 ramp up, GF3 phase II, and solar ramp up. It is successful solar ramp up and battery ramp up which will drive the stock. True FSD will also drive the price, but I’m skeptical that the current cars have sufficient number of cameras for redundancy. Just water and mud splatters will make FSD challenging. 
The stock can easily go into the 400’s next year, but to exceed 800 requires substantial expansion plans. Tesla can reach 1000 with execution on massive expansion."
"The new EV tax credit talk is probably fueling a lot of this movement today, combined with gun-shy shorts, a perfect storm for a good day for TSLA."
"I jumped the dip, but sold to quickly, would have made 1000 in 3700..."
So when is next end of quarter announcement?
I was going to buy Tesla before the earnings call with shorts driving the prices down...why didn’t I follow through
Average 199$ here.
If I had the cash I would have gotten in before the Q4 earning report end of January. But it seems everyone is expecting the good news and the price is jumping up again as more people buy.
Does anybody think TSLA will split? Stocks don't seem to split as much as they used to.
I wonder how many of us have $TSLA so that we can afford to buy a tesla car?
"I have about 35 tsla in my retirement fund and 35 in my 2 year short term down payment to buy a house fund.

I think it will be a hard choice when it comes time to put money down on a house."
"almost convinced my dad to trust me with $10,000 back in May... interesting :("
I made about a couple grand today but I'm kicking myself for not buying even more. I haven't had a single doubt Tesla will leave the future of transportation.... In the most S3XY way possible too.
"Dumped a lot of money into the stock in April, posted about it here back then and do not regret any of it.

I screwed up so badly on TSLA. I bought a model S in 2017 and the stock was in the low 100s (can’t remember and don’t want to look it up). Sold my old car for around $9k and said I was going to put it all into TSLA. Well I didn’t and that miss would have paid for the Tesla I’m driving today. Oh well. Love the car though.
No idea what that means. But sounds great!!
"Can someone explain what ""race to cover"" means?"
"Tesla stock, fun to watch. Not fun to buy."
Up 99%? It is not.

"You sir, have balls of steel. I too bought at 250/260. Like you, o believed in Elon when it went down. Figured I’d dollar cost average. But then it went down again. And again. At that point I couldn’t stomach it. But I did not sell. Now I’m kicking myself, should have bought more."
I did a similar thing and now can easily afford a model Y...but I'm really aiming for the Roadster.
"See I bought at the $250’s and sold at $3-something. Then bought back in while it was going down to the $200’s before it went into $100 territory. Overall, I took a loss on TSLA, probably not the best stock for a new trader to get into 😓. Decided to take a break after I got too emotional in stocks, going to get back in once I feel more confident in trading."
Same here! I’m halfway towards paying off my car.
Bought at 330. I think they will be the most valuable company in the world within 5-10 years. I cant really afford to buy more but I am happy to sit on it.
Don’t forget about capital gains tax! I got raped one year on it.
[Here's my summary. If I had it over a year already I'd probably sell. I'm just typically more risk averse and well I like Index funds better.](https://i.imgur.com/h0hj5Pf.png)
"> enough to buy myself a Model 3. So TSLA will be paying for me next Tesla

Isn't that only if you sell? Do you get profits when Tesla makes profits?

What app did you use to buy shares?"
Me too! 600 shares at a $260 average. Elon bought my CyberTruck!
I was about to bite at that price but couldn’t force myself to bite...now I’m kicking myself instead.
does that mean you are gonna sell? if i were you I would be selling covered calls. We are getting close to ath meaning we might actually slow down. Just sell them far out enough that you don't actually get exercised.
You should buy the options instead of the stock.
Investing is just a game of regret management
Holy shit! It's up $24 today.
Awww man...I know right? I jumped in at $280 so still good
"I stuck a toe in at $244, then lost my nerve when it dipped to $200. Also kicking myself."
Same here.
I’m with you.  About to FOMO this week.
"You are not alone here. I bought some shares at $283 and the SP dropped to $180, I had the cash in hand but decided at the end not averaging down. FML.

Luckily I have recently bought one JAN 2020 $400 calls and almost up 50%."
I got in at just under 220 back in June. The way this stock's been going if I wait a year to sell so I don't pay hefty capital gains taxes I could be up a whole $10 by next June!
There are some in /r/wallstreetbets kicking themselves for not shorting even more.
">the dip

>TSLA

Lol which one..."
Your user name makes me think you may need help getting a long position.
"If I were to get into investing, I'd have bought before the cybertruck reveal. And that didn't go so well."
"Remember that for actual investors, time in the market is always better than timing the market. 

If you keep waiting for another dip you might lose out on some more gains than if you just buy in now and hold it."
The stock market is currently at an all time high -- it will dip again
The stock is basically still dirt cheap.  It's headed toward 4-6k in 510 years.  Buy now and keep buying.
Plenty more dips to come.
In just glad I didn't drop the handful of shares I had.
"Same. I remember when I could've purchased it at $183, not it's twice that..."
"Yeah.  I def bought high ($360ish) and brought my average down to $298.  I bought because of the funding debacle, but screw it.  I didn’t care that it didn’t go through."
"2 profitable quarters had me in at 350. 

Rode the wave back up!"
"This has been the craziest few years for me. Bought near ATH's before and finally seeing those unrealized losses finally turn into unrealized gains is a huge weight lifted from my shoulders. I too bought 2x more stock this year due to the huge dips and am finally in the black on all common stock purchases. 

Feels great, and sticking with it as frankly it's time we break out of this trading range."
"Ugh same here on being a ""funding secured"" bag holder. It's fine though, in the long run i feel Tesla will get up there after their future successes. So i'm not worried about it, i just know i have to wait longer for my ""i bought during X struggle period and now look where we are"" comment lol."

"What does it means when the anime community starts cropping into another hobby or popular activity?

I have heard it already multiple times that if ""anime avatars"" start showing in your communities it means that it reached a critical point or something like that.

I wonder why the anime community in specific is some kind of omen around the internet tho."
Joke's on you. It was my anime avatar fueled purchase that marked the rise of Tesla.
Short interest is down from 31m shares in Sept to 26m shares now. Huge fall this must be hurting some people a lot
Sunk cost. There's nothing really to short. Maybe that FSD won't materialize but even without it they don't show signs of slowing in the car department. As well as solar.
"The bear case is all about profitability or lack there of. The next bear case is over infrastructure for service. Let’s be honest, Tesla’s service is terrible, especially when compared to the lux brands their are stealing sales market share from. Tesla hasn’t ramped up service anywhere near the way they’ve ramped up sales. With Model Y coming out this is about to get much worse. Also keep in mind many of the current buyers are NOT Tesla super fans. Their growth is from converting traditional car buys. They will not be extending Tesla the same leeway"
I keep telling all the naysayers on Facebook they'd better start shorting NOW before Tesla goes bankrupt. Just trying to help.
Whats wrong with shorting? Right now the stock is at an all time high I might even consider shorting. Its so volatile..
"I'm up almost 70%. 
Just holding. 75% in Tesla but this should be lowered to around 40% this year as I buy other stocks.

Goal is to be 33% in TSLA."

"Learning experience there is not to sell everything.

When your position goes up take a little off the table. 

When it goes up a lot, sell your principal and play with the house’s money.  

When you lose faith in the company sell it all without looking at how much you won or lost. 

If you want short term gambles you can just trade options."
It’s just getting started.
"Nearly all of  us believe it will, otherwise we'd sell and brag how much we made."
"Long or short term? Long term, definitely. We’re talking no-brainer kind of definitely.

Short term? Who knows. No one can predict short term markets."
spoken like a real wall street whiz
Of course. Especially when Gigafactory 3 begins producing Model 3. Q1 2020 looks good if it's all well might go up to $500 by Q4 2020 as Model Y should be here. If I had like $30k-$40k I'd chuck like 80% of that into TSLA.
"Tesla beat last quarters earnings call by a huge amount, actually turning a profit for that quarter, and are on track for their highest stock price close for this year in two years. They are also ramping up their facilities in China and are looking to deliver their target of 360k vehicles this year.

I think the stock is going to rise some more, but you should search the stock up on Yahoo Finance and other investment websites to determine that for yourself."
I am long TSLA because of their gigafactory plans and the execution in China along with the energy storage business. No one seems to be racing to fill the gaps in the future renewables grid faster than them. The car business is icing on the cake for me.
"When you short a stock, you sell it without actually owning it. In order to do so, you have to ""borrow"" the stock, which means that you must return it later at some point. We call the action of buying the stock to return it ""covering""."
The hate comes from the perception that shorts spread misinformation as a form of self fulfilling prophecy.
"I’ve got no problem with shorting (everyone has a right to call bullshit). But, shorting a company and then trying to destroy the company by spreading lies should be prosecuted as market manipulation."
"I’m long TSLA 290 shares, which puts it at a total equity value of a touch over $110k. I bought them at an average cost of $260 and it is now $380ish. Robinhood tells me I’ve “made” $33,539.81 on it but I plan on staying long.

I’ve been under the impression for at least the past two years that the stationary energy business has a much larger addressable market than Tesla Motors ever could. Provided they continue to execute, I expect the stock to continue to go up. I might consider selling it in 10 years, but probably will hold it for some time. But I’ve also been a fan of Elon for some time. I also bought 25,000 worth of solar city bonds when they came out. When Tesla bought solar city they called the bonds in early yet still paid the total interest, which was amazing. I took that money plus some I was already planning on spending to buy TSLA."

Yeah thinking of adding another 50k of shares but don't want to destroy my avg share price lol. If it corrects to anything near 350 I think I'm going in.

"Mid 80s, as in, $85ish? Or $185ish?"
"Cybertruck is a few years away... I don’t get the logic behind selling because of the unveil, even if it was that bad (which it’s not)."

That's why panic/knee jerk impulses don't go well with investing.
"I almost did, 30 seconds after it rolled out and I realized they were serious, I turned to my wife and asked is it time to sell?  She said don't be stupid.  

Next day I preordered the truck.  It took time for it to grow on me, and frankly its still ugly from the back end, but I am super excited now to get one.  I plan on holding this stock until my 7 year old twins get their first car."
"yeah, I also fought this fight. The reason I did not sell was that I  trust Elon. He motivates me like no one else..."
"Yeah, for the first few minutes I had doubts, but once I started watching the test drives, it started to make sense."
Just gotta slow that ol' sell finger.
"Yeah, for the first few minutes I had doubts, but once I started watching the test drives, it started to make sense."
"Yea that made no sense. And you screwed up my calls jerk. 

But things are better now so I forgive you."
"thats the perfect time to buy, because people were selling since they though it was ugly. Meanwhile, its not shipping for years and they have a prototype only, so its appearance means nothing...but the performance matters"
"Stocks price is a function of expected earnings and free cash flow, not on revenue, as well as being a function of imperfect market forces (shares sold short mean artificial demand is on the horizon).

Shanghai margins/production are unknown, Y margins/production are unknown, fsd revenue is all straight profit, addons like rear heated seats and premium connectivity are pure profit, FCA fleet pooling deal is worth hundreds of millions, energy margins have thus far been basically non-existent but now he mentions doing 1,000 roofs/week and ramping solar being the 2nd priority for this quarter, and if we get to SP500 inclusion next year we’ll see a huge amount of inelastic demand.

If they double expected earnings by building cars more profitably, then share price should double even if revenue doesn’t grow at all, there is room for $800 per share if they execute well."
"New EV tax credit talk, you say?"
Why would it matter whether you have 50 shares at $400 or 100 shares at $200?
"Not a chance, currently."
"What was your average price and how many shares are you long? Also, good for you!"
Shorts borrowed shares and sold them hoping the stock will go down in price so they can return the borrowed shares and still make money. When the stock price rises they get scared because they know others are going to buy shares which will drive the price upward. Whoever waits the longest to cover during a short squeeze end up paying a higher price for the chairs but they have to return.
Since June where it was around $180 i think.
Why?
Honest question: why and how are sales and shares' prices related? I just bought my Model 3 and will take delivery of it in 2 days. Never looked even once at the price of Tesla's shares.
Lol I sure will!
"You really don't get how investing works, do you?"
Yepp. I was only trying to demonstrate the amount of money TSLA has made me. I womt be selling anything anytime soon.
"I bought at $306 before the big dip and held. I was really disappointed that when it hit its low, I didn't have the cash on hand to buy more.  I think I'll regret missing that for a long time."
Bought a tesla at 0.99 interest rate...
">owns the huge charging network nationwide

Electrify America's charging network has opened more rapid charging locations in the past year than Tesla has ever opened in any year. It's now easier to make a Seattle-to-Boston cross-country trip in a $75k e-tron than it is in a $75k Model X.

What's actually going to happen is that the CCS-based charging standard will continue to gain traction across the automotive industry until Tesla is forced to modify their vehicles to be compatible."
Yeah that much in TSLA.
I did the same but with $200k. Deeply believed in Elon and Tesla's mission statement.
Id say past $1000.
Yepp. Cud have gone either way for me too. Stock investing is more or less a calculated gambling.
"you have done well. Even Elon panicked in Q1 (closing the stores, cheap FSD, massive discounts, raising funds), so Tesla couldn’t be far from bankruptcy. It all turned out well, so this time, “gamblers” were lucky ones, but going big into such a big risk has only one name: gambling. You did well you haven’t bought more. Will appreciate that in the next recession. Though I am glad Tesla made it through and is on an excellent path going forward."

"My advice is to find some solid companies based on their numbers and go long term on them. It is very tempting to frequently buy-sell to make a small gain, which is exactly what I did when I started trading to learn. Those days are past, long term on solid performing companies will always make you money. 

Id also advice to invest a portion of your money in index funds."

Love your spirit!
"Me too. I have about 2 years left to pay off my model 3. When thats done, I might take that payment Im used to making and just turn it all into stock."
Yepp. Less txes if you hold long term tho.
Yeah I’d have to sell. That was just a rhetorical remark. I use Robinhood these days.
Dang 600. Way to go!
Yepp. I regret not buying a lot of stocks during Dec 2018 dip. I bought enough to have a 40% increase in my portfolio tho. Cant be too greedy.
I think I will keep holding. Time in the market always trumps timing the market. That is my #1 lesson in trading. #2 is “do not sell your winners”.
This isn’t WSB buddy
"Being a recent father, I dont have risk tolerance for options. I would rather have steady increase in wealth."
This is such a good description.
"The comment section of reddit is the worst place to get investment insight. Tesla is still a risky investment in terms of volatility. Risk is not a bad thing though regardless of the words connotation. Most of r/tesla will bypass financial health or indicators and judge the company based on their love for the product. Which is also (in my opinion) a good reason to invest in a company. And most of the haters will look to find issues with teslas financial health to short the company. 

In my opinion, if we do go into a recession, tesla will likely be hit harder than other car companies because they don't have cheap options. The model 3 is still an expensive car upfront even if it does save you money in the long run. If the economy does well, especially in Europe I wouldn't be surprised if tesla hits doubles its market cap in the next 4 years. Especially with the countries being smaller distance wise than the US. You can see evidence of this in Germany."
This has nothing to do with ‘investing’ - it’s just speculating.
"Yeah, you just manage the regret you don’t have by playing long and investing in the whole market and never ever pick stocks because it’s a fool’s errand.  Even fool’s sometimes strike gold, but it doesn’t mean anyone can reliably figure out how to do the same thing or predict outcomes."
"Regret minimization is a good way to live life.  Spend time with people you love.  Take modest risks to follow opportunities that you'd hate yourself for not trying.  Work hard and prune the fat you don't personally care about, to make room for the risks you do care about."
Totally. Sold a few shares at $370 and still kicking myself for not waiting another hour.
$420 here we come!
$298 here.  Woot
"Do not, ever, sell stock based on their stock price. That’s the fastest way to lose your money. Sell if you no longer believe in the company. Not when it hit new lows."
"When it dipped under 200, I was going to buy a few options contacts. Those would have been worth quite a bit now. I could have paid off a majority of my loan or put down on a Model Y."
"I dropped 15 shares right before the Q3 earnings :'(. Yee who had little faith.

It was hard hurting to buy more when Tesla was droping below $200, and I had already bought to my limit when it was going below $240.

Overall I'm up right now but could've been more than 50% up."
"almost the same here as well, finally have a profit again on it lol."
I can't believe I'm up on the stock while buying too high. I should have bought more during the dip as well :D
"Yeah we review things now and then. I don't have a huge position in TSLA or anything but he always told us to avoid it. We told him, ""don't care what you think, we believe in Tesla's long term mission"" and happily bought some shares anyways."
"I mean he is a financial dude, so he might pay for drinks if you put on a short dress, and show some skin. ;)"

Never side against progress
Do any other stocks have a similar short ratio? Just curious at what point TSLA has a “normal” amount of shorts.
"All true, but this is something that *will* improve. You can give Tesla a hard time about this, but step back a moment. They *have* been working hard on sales, and service has not kept up. Done the other way, they'd be even deeper in debt, and they nearly didn't make it as is. Given how hard the shorts have been attacking, they literally *could not* have done it another way.

Another aspect is that growing staff levels that fast in any business is incredibly difficult, good people don't grow on trees, and even attempting to do so means you're going to unintentionally going to hire some shit people, or even good people who can't stand the pace."
">The next bear case is over infrastructure for service.

Wouldn't the **next** case be the current state of ending subsidies in 2020?"
"Has anyone done the math on how the early Teslas finally starting to age out of extended warranty will affect service?  A 2012 is probably like 10x the warranty overhead of a 2019.

There are probably about 50,000 ""early"" cars (pre-AP?) which is going to be like removing 500,000 2019 cars from the service requirement."
I don't really have a problem is shorting in general. the problem comes in when organizations/fund managers intentionally try to sew doubt in order to manipulate the stock so their shorts are profitable.
Uh... I hope your strike price wasn’t $420
This guy invests
"And understand the impact of transaction costs! You’re not a goddamn Wall Street day trader. If you’re buying and selling with the same money several times a year as an casual investor, your transaction costs will eat away your return. Invest in companies for a good reason and leave your money in them until, as you say, the reason you invested in the company is no longer valid and you lose faith."
So at a certain date you have to pay the difference between the actual price and what you bet it would be?  That sounds like it would be devastatingly expensive.
That's a good amount to hold too if Tesla ends up paying out dividends in the future.
"Cost basis on each is ~$980, and theta isn't too much a factor until at least April, so I'm holding for now. May sell some higher expiry 90 day OTMs against them to grab some anti-theta."

"Yeah, I’ve seen that advice a few times before. I’ll probably put a majority into index funds and keep a very small portion dedicated to finding companies and just watching the performance over 6-12 months. Then figure out if it was a good/bad pick and write down why I picked that stock at the time. I’m talking like 1-5 shares max."

Does this tie in with your reddit name? :p
"Reddit is a bad place for investment advice, so.. here’s my advice"
"Investing in a company because you like their product is a terrible idea. For example, I love Uber as a consumer. I use it all the time. But that doesn't mean they're a profitable or well-run company worth investing in. Similarly, just because Tesla makes cool cars does not necessarily mean they are a good investment."
"In a recession, growth of Tesla may slow down, but I expect Tesla to do better than other car manufacturers, who are stuck between selling electric vehicles still with a loss despite heavy investments and dwindling sales of their cash cows.  
When more people have to do the math, they may recognize, that a Tesla is a good choice regarding TCO, especially with the Semi or the Cybertruck."

The cost savings Tesla has made in the last 18 months more than cover the loss of the subsidies and they are no longer an issue.
"Good news is there is a very real possibility that a new EV credit will be extended to 600,000 units when the new budget passes in a few days.  Its one of those things thats not worth fighting about since everyone pretty much wants it.

I think r/wallstreetbets is leaking.

You can also bet against a company through options trading such as buying Put options. 

In this case there will be an expiration date."
"Not gonna like, I’d love for them to, but I’d rather them utterly crush every segment they compete in first!"
Nice. That's one of my strategies---calendar call spreads.

This. Fear and panic ruled the day.
"If you don't mind me asking, what's your cost basis on those shares?"
"That sucks. I'm currently borrowing a Model 3 from a close friend, and it's changing my outlook on transportation. I see myself owning one of these cars in the near future despite a long history of driving vehicles into the ground. A tax credit would be nice, but not essential. 

Now I know why people say ""don't drive one unless you plan to buy one""."
"I guess that's something if you can only afford one share. Though I can't see that being important for the company to facilitate. 

How would a split make options trading easier?  Isn't option pricing more tied to volatility than the dollar price of the underlying stock?"
"When you bet on the price of Tesla going down, and it goes up, you continue to lose money the longer you wait to buy stocks at the current market rate if it continues going up.  


A short is betting that the stock price goes down. The stock going up makes the shorts lose money. Since most of us on this sub want Tesla to succeed, we tend to revel in shorts getting burned, like they did today."
"It has been very volatile. So yeah you could make money with puts. However, i feel like this is the most stable Tesla has ever been. They have sorted their manufacturing/supply chain woes and have a mass seller in the market, with an even bigger mass seller due in 2020 Q1. So I feel like it will do well for a while."
I know some of these words!
I think there is potential to make profit on short term puts if you catch a pull back. Long term though I would not bet against Tesla.
Quite frankly the volatility is a sign speculative froth in the stock. It isn't a good thing.
"From what I'm told by a Tesla enthusiast at work, something about the charging hardware in the car needs to support CCS, even with an adapter. Teslas in Europe have said hardware while Teslas in the U.S. don't. I'm actually curious about a more official statement from Tesla on that."
WSB doesn't fuck with shares. They want to play at the casino

Agreed! But you apply same rule to any stocks. Some stocks are better off short term.

"I guess it depends on your understand of a good product. I invest in mutual funds, and make 10-15%, same or more as my buddies who spend hours reading about individual stocks and companies they know nothing about.

The key is understanding if its a good company with a good product.  

Uber is a terrible company to invest in because even though a user may like it, the people driving for them hate it, and they have predatory practices etc etc. This was years ago. The drivers all told me Ubers game; drop prices and raise driver rates to drive out cabbies and get drivers; then raise prices and drop driver rates till no one could make a living. Sounded ripe for failure and a terrible business practice/ethic"

Nice! I got in at 190 as well then again at 220. Average is 207. I didnt want to risk too much at the much higher price of 220 -_-

"Always depends on the individual and where they’re at in life. If you’re about to retire, you don’t want to hold Tesla stock in your retirement account. 

But for anyone with a time horizon over 20 years, the long term growth potential can definitely be worth the short term roller coaster ride. You just have to be comfortable with wild fluctuations in the stock price. A lot of people just can’t handle the thought of losing thousands dollars of stock value overnight."

"Also on the very near horizon is a lot of leases being returned and pre-owned Tesla's being resold.

"How do you ""prove"" that you have the assets to pay?  Is there some way to put money is escrow?"
Majority of stock traders are herd mentality. You should only invest in companies that you think will perform in long term (based on both numbers are the company's core competency) and hold.
$33.15
"Volatility is a percentage of underlying.  A 1/21/2022 call option is trading at $97.70 for a $380 (at the money) strike implying a 26% increase in the underlying is needed to break even on the trade.  If there was a 1:2 stock split and stock was $190, a 1/21/22 at the money call would be $48.85 - same percentage volatility priced in, just cheaper to buy.  Since those prices are all x100, I can only buy a few $10k options, and not be well balanced. I can buy a lot more $5k options which allows for many more trading strategies - averaging down in dips, taking gains on pops but keeping exposure, Vega hedges, etc."
"No I get that part- but what does ""race to cover"" mean. So does that mean they are paying their losses now before it gets worse for them?"
"Yeah, short-term trading is less about the company and more about the noise around it. No matter what your opinion is on Tesla, one thing is certain: there's an absolute ton of noise around it, perfect to wobble the Wall Street casinos in all sorts of wild and different ways. If you're ready to ride the wave, and stress yourself by staying up to date with literally everything, there is money to be made there.

What I don't get are the long-term shorts. There are only two things certain about Tesla stock: it's not gonna go to $0, and long-term it's gonna go up. Living in denial, or maybe lying is one thing, but putting money into your own lies is simply moronic, regardless if you lie to yourself too or just others."
"I can agree with that, but you got to understand investors sometimes think differently and even if Tesla has solid numbers it could go anywhere during an earnings report"
"You sure about that, dont you think its odd there hasn't even been a whisper of the number of pre orders for the Y?"
"Sorted manufacturing/supply chain? They have a brand new factory and just starting planning their next one while they have a new product almost every year. Oh, nothing is sorted just yet."
Not available in Canada :/
You missed the part where uber goes bankrupt if they don't have self driving to bail them out. The product is only good because it is subsidized assuming self driving is coming. They have less data than tesla on self driving. They are probably screwed.
"They key is understanding if it's a good company that can make money going forward. Whether or not it has a good product in your opinion is irrelevant.

To counter your anecdote with my own, my best investment was buying AMD and selling at over 10x value, despite the fact that I'm not a gamer and havent built a computer in 10 years. I saw a good opportunity for a beaten down company to gain market share; it had nothing to do with my own (lack of) opinion about their processors."

"Congrats man, enjoy the profit from your 3 tesla shares"
See [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-the-most-heavily-shorted-stocks-on-wall-street-2019-11-26](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/here-are-the-most-heavily-shorted-stocks-on-wall-street-2019-11-26)
"without getting into a long post, there are really two scenarios here.

1. the value of your bet against the stock, tesla, is losing money (because the price is going up), and so if you wish to maintain your position (borrowed negative shares, selling short) you need to put more money in your account to show you can buy the shares at the difference in price.

2. you have sold an option, and are either at the expiration date or approaching, and wish to close your position.

either way, covering means you either acquire the shares at the current price OR you are putting additional cash in your account to cover the margin.

here is a scenario:

you believe tesla is going down, you sell 100 shares of tesla at the current price (say, 360). so, you are -100 @ 360 (36,000 net value that you receive TODAY), but you dont actually own the shares. 

your broker says... ok, ill let you do this because you have enough assets in  your account (over, let's say.... 20k). now, a week goes by and the price of tesla is now 380/share. so, you have effectively lost $2,000. they give you the option to throw in $2,000 to continue your gamble OR cover now, which means you have to buy all 100 shares at $380 ($2,000 more than the 36k you made).

this type of scenario leads to what is called a short squeeze wherein the value of the stock increases  because there is synthetic purchasing of tesla simply to cover their bet against tesla, and thus drives up the market price.

http://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=tsla&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2

this is a simplification. there are a multitude of factors... one major one is: if you have taken a VERY LARGE negative position... there are only so many shares of tesla out there, and sometimes you have to ""borrow"" someone else's shares... there is a time window on that usually as well (this/options contracts denotes the average days to cover).

right now the average short position percent (of all shares traded) is ~20%... those 20% have averaged 3.4 days to cover their position... if tesla doens't go down... we'll see a short squeeze on friday."
This is no place for logic and sound advice /s
"Exactly, time in the market beats timing the market. If you want to throw money around with short term gains/losses play options, but buy the stock to invest for the long term."
"God damn. Keep holding, retire off those shares."
"I follow your point. I suppose with a limited budget (pretty much everyone's is to some extent) lower stock prices = lower option prices better allowing for all the spread/straddle/strangle/collar strategies that I'm too lazy, or maybe not smart enough, to wrap my head around - not to mention condors and butterflies. I'm pretty content sticking with the equities themselves. 

All that said, Tesla may be quite happy to keep with higher prices if it discourages some of the options traders from playing with their stock."
"Sorted out as in they do not have problem producing 100,000 cars per quarter if they have to meet demands. They could not do that with supply chain issue at the Fremont factory."
Oh bummer.
"Knowing about processors could still have helped that decision. You could at least admit that it would help *some* people *some* of the time.  


It's useful to know if a company knows how to make good products. Even better if your taste lines up with the mainstream taste for the market."
Thanks! That’s exactly what I was looking for
"Man, look at those Carvana shorts, taking it in the... shorts."
Thanks for the explanation.  No wonder short sellers just seem like maniacs.  I think you have to be to gamble your money like this. What an insane way to bet.  Your timing has to be damn near perfect.
Wish I had bought more back then. I actually sold my BMW M3 to a Tesla engineer. I asked him if Tesla was going to last and he said probably not. I dumped the cash from the car on Tesla anyway :P He probably doesn't work there anymore.
"100,000 cars per quarter, but that doesn't include the Chinese factory, the Model Y, the solar glass, the German factory, the Semi truck, the Cybertruck, etc"
Mark Spiegel is short both Tesla and Carvana. That dude picks real winners.
"When you buy a stock, it can only go to zero worst case scenario. 

When you short a stock, your losses are potentially unlimited"
"I bought earlier this year when the shares tanked.  Wish I bought more then too!  It was a great opportunity and I'm glad I was able to get in while they were ""cheap"" again.  Guess he should have had more faith in his company, I bet working for Tesla that early on would have given him a good position with a good paycheck."
hahahah Mark Spiegel's own kids hate him
"From the article:

Homer Electric Association (HEA), a member-owned electric utility cooperative based in Alaska, announced that it’s working with Tesla to deploy a big battery:

The BESS will be capable of storing 93 MWh (Megawatt hours) of electrical power that can be delivered to the grid at a rate of 46.5 MWs per hour. The BESS will allow HEA to meet its reliability requirements without having to burn additional fuel. This will result in greater system efficiencies, lower greenhouse gas production, and reduced power outages.

The BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) is going to be installed at the Soldotna Generation Plant.

HEA says that the battery is going to enable them to use more renewable energy and less power from plants burning fossil fuels:

The BESS also provides a great side benefit of opening the door to renewable intermittent energy projects that would have otherwise stretched current thermal generation assets.

The new project is expected to be in service in fall 2021."
this is great news. if itll work in alaska itll work anywhere.
Can you deploy a fucking supercharger up here. There’s more and more model 3s and 0 support
Can someone smart put this in perspective? What’s a typical US power plant capable of?
ELI5 how does deploying a big battery replace a power plant?
"I wonder if they are doing modular plug-and-play trailer based batteries for this now. Seems like the most obvious way to do things and best way to up-scale large battery systems. 

Basically just build a large parking structure with power lines overhead or in the walls, drive a semi in and drop the battery trailer. Plug it into input and output power connections, and cooling, and you have about  ~2800 cubic feet of batteries up and running (allowing ~25% of space for cooling, wiring, and monitoring and control systems).

As they age you can just add a few more to make up the difference, and once any one gets below an acceptable efficiency threshold you replace it entirely."
"Slowly but surely the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is happening, especially with the recent Goldman Sach’s announcement. The profitability is starting to become undeniable."
"""The BESS (Battery Energy Storage System)"", as opposed to those other batteries that, uh, uh..."
Never been Alaska. Does that mean Alaska would get more supercharger stations ?
Can’t print those batteries fast enough.
Is this bigger or smaller than the Australia battery?
"Omg that would be amazing! Honestly I haven't ready the article yet, just commenting.

I have solar and get SHIT in the winter but if there's something else going on then I'm down!"
"Pretty resilient plan for Tesla to be able to sell mega batteries like these. Think about it. If the car market is slow, they can keep their gigafactory running and sell more batteries to keep generating revenue. No other automaker will be able to do that until they go full in on EVs."

Energy and power units are hard, lets go fishing instead :)"
"This is an improvement to the efficiency of the existing carbon producing power plant. It would appear that this will allow the plant to streamline its power generation so that less fuel is used, which is excellent. this also means that they can better support the intermittent needs of renewable power generation, especially the usages in a place like Alaska, which has long periods of daylight/nighttime. 

This is all good news, but i'm not seeing anything here about ""replacing a fossil-fuel plant"". This headline appears misleading"

> 
> 

Solar is not really possible in Alaska, so I'm assuming this is offshore wind or something similar? Hydrothermal is also certainly possible considering that the southern part is on the ring of fire, but that's not intermittent."
“This is going to be the BESS Battery Energy Storage System we have ever made.”
MW per hour isn’t a thing.  Watts are already a rate.   It would be joules per hour.
2026 then in Tesla-time?
"They will have built 2 huge batteries. 1 in super hot Australia and 1 in super cold Alaska. I would say it is coincidence, but maybe not. They can not rule temp out of the equation. 

I still feel they need to prove high rain fall locations, but no matter what if there is an issue hey can solve."
"Natural gas plants are generally much smaller than coal plants. With a heat recovery steam generator for the exhaust large natural gas units put out something in the range of 300-400 mw. My plant has a one smaller older unit that will do about 112mw, this battery is likely built to keep units like that offline. It takes about 3 hours to startup my unit, but it has an 8 hour minimum run time. So if you only need it for 2 hours during the afternoon peak, the battery will actually save a lot of money.

On the flip side, grid stability and nerc requirements make sure that the grid has spinning and no spinning reserves available. Basically spinning reserves are capacity on already running units. They assume load within minutes in the event of a unit loss somewhere else or large load change. The battery would likely count here.

As for non spinning reserves that's for extended increased load which the battery will not help with and will not prevent the starting of another unit. The battery would actually be a bit of a hinderence here as it will need to charged and puts a large load on the system. This isn't so bad in places with large cyclical loads, charge at low cost, discharge at high cost."
"It’s not an apple to apple comparison, the objective of a battery is to supplement/help only, so its objective is to manage spikes, not provide equivalent power to a plant."
"It’s about how fast this battery can deal with some cloud cover, a change if wind or a coal / gas generator overheating. The Hornsdale wind farm Tesla big battery in south Australia takes 140 milliseconds to be able to deliver power that helps stabilise the grid."
I just did a quick google search and [this](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/how-electricity-measured) says the average coal plant is around 600 MW. So roughly about 1/6 the size of a normal coal plant?
"1 MW powers about 1000 homes so 93 MWh is 93,000 homes powered for 1 hour. Basically Tesla uses these batteries for peak shaving (among other things), which means when power prices are high and grid operators need to turn on more sources of energy, they normally opt for really old, dirty power plants like coal/nat gas that are super inefficient to run, but the electricity is being demanded so they turn on. Instead, now we can use clean batteries that store either renewables or cleaner legacy power."
"Firstly,

* It didn't actually, in this case.
* It does, sometimes.

As far as how, it's about two things: peak usage, and how quickly usage changes.  If you have no storage, then you have to build enough powerplants to supply the peak need, even though some of them turn off other times during the day.  If you have a battery, you can charge it when you have extra power, and discharge it at peak.

Additionally, how quickly you can respond to changes in demand is a real factor.  There's a tradeoff between how fast a powerplant can turn on (responsiveness), and how efficient it runs -- more responsive == less efficient.  This isn't a setting you can change, it's about what type of generator you install.  Fast powerplants are called peaker plants.  There's a whole continuum between efficient and responsive, but the most efficient is baseload.

Batteries can respond to changes in milliseconds, which is much faster that peaker plants can respond.  They're also much more efficient.  So you can install batteries and baseload, *instead of installing peakers*.  Also, frequently you already have enough baseload to cover it, so installing the battery makes it so you don't need to build a new plant at all."
The same way it helps a Prius to be more efficient event though it still burn gas.
"It smooths energy production by acting as a buffer against hourly changes in demand. During peak demand hours it dumps energy. Off peak it charges. Store solar during day, dump from battery at night."
https://www.tesla.com/megapack yep.
i hadn't thought of charging efficiency getting worse as they age. People usually discuss loss of storage capacity wrt driving range or computing hours. But I still think the reduced conversion efficiency of older powerwall batteries is still better than the efficiency of any remaining peaker plants. And offgridders could buy the very old batteries to boost their off-grid systems in order to save the cost of running long wires to remote locations.
Perhaps as opposed to pump hydroelectric storage PHES or kinetic energy storage such as [FESS which uses flywheels to store energy for later use](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwirx5_ztL3mAhXBQc0KHQnYCkMQFjAAegQIAhAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fenergystorage.org%2Fwhy-energy-storage%2Ftechnologies%2Fmechanical-energy-storage%2F&usg=AOvVaw1fboiiaZNzey4hAhwpOBBM)
"Though less popular, kinetic energy (aka flywheel) storage is also a thing.  People are also working on compressed air, flow batteries, and a host of of other technologies."
Molten salt heat energy storage system?
More? We don’t have ANY!
"Not directly. Tesla cars have diminished range with cold batteries, so they are not a great fit for Alaska."
"They don't, but what does that have to do with batteries?"
Alaska probable has a decent amount of hydro or will given time.
They can put the batteries... indoors...
"I think there's *just a chance* they've thought of that, and if we're lucky, they might even build a building around the battery.

And, uh, electrical engineer or not, I think *just possibly* the guys building the 90MWh battery storage plant know more about inverters than you do."
Soldotna isn't cold like Fairbanks gets cold. Additionally I imagine they'll be in a climate controlled facility. The Soldotna generation plant uses natural gas
"Even capturing excess as demand goes down for later use when it ramps back up instead of just being wasted, theres a certain lag in adjusting supply. Wind, hydro, ocean current are all possible extensions though. Solar is too winter limited in most likely hoods."
They would hear the system which would cause a parasitic load. They would also cool the system as heat up on when charging. They intend to charge the batteries by variable output resources such as wind and hyrdo while supplementing that energy with natural gas generation.
The Colbolt used to refine fuel? Because Tesla/ Panasonic does not use Colbolt from the Congo. Most of it comes from Australia or the Philippines .

"Solar is might still be off the table but this should give a reason to add wind or maybe an ocean interface, it is right there."
"Despite the misleading title, it means they can turn off generation assets, rather than leave them in ""idle"" and ready to quickly ramp up.

Those two hours (93 / 46) give them plenty of time (I believe, as a novice) to cold-start some other fossil fuel power station which was completely shut down. And it enables them to ""replace fossil-fuel plant"" over time with intermittent generating renewables."
"> This is all good news, but i'm not seeing anything here about ""replacing a fossil-fuel plant"". This headline appears misleading

The article didn't say this, but the way this battery is described to use this would replace a [Peaker plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaking_power_plant) which is usually a Natural Gas plant that can spin up quickly to make up for short term electricity demand.

Without the battery, they'd likely need a peaker plant to run more efficiently."

It keeps HEA from having to fire up a gas peaker power plant located right next door while allowing for renewable energy to be more easily absorbed by the grid when production outpaces demand, including new renewable power plants.  Of course it would be better if they were doing this instead of of building a new peaker plant (instead of just not using the one they already have, although maybe it needed a bunch of work or something.)"

"Solar _does_ have a fossil fuel cost of the manufacture. If you have too low solar irradiation then your net CO2 is going to end up positive. Wind is a much better choice. Alaska doesn't get a lot of sun. Lots of cloudy skies and also extremely far north. Solar doesn't really work in the UK for similar reasons, but UK has great wind power."
"> Solar is not really possible in Alaska

There are several solar PV installations in Alaska. Even in remote northern villages they've put in multipanel installations for the township.

>Solar power in Alaska has been primarily used in remote locations, such as the Nenana Teen Center near Fairbanks, where long summer days provide most of the electricity generated. In 2015, Alaska ranked 45th in installed solar among U.S. states. Rooftop solar panels could provide 23% of all electricity used in Alaska.

>In 2011, Alaska's largest solar array was the 17.28 kW array installed on a building in Anchorage. A 12 kW solar array installed in Lime Village in July 2001 helped reduce electricity costs"

Why? The battery tech isn't set up to be exposed to water directly - it's in weatherproof housings where needed - similar to all the rest of the electrical grid components in rainy countries - it's not like places with high rainfall don't already have plenty of electrical grid infrastructure out in the open (but weatherproofed where needed), like transmission lines, substations, transformers etc. etc. The batteries will be installed in the appropriate level of weatherproof housing, not just plonked on the ground and have a tarpaulin slung over them! :D"

Managing spikes can let them shut down backup plants instead of idling them to be at the ready for a demand spike.
This is correct. Batteries should not be compared to power plants. They make power generators better. You can't replace a generator with a battery.  You CAN replace a generator with a battery AND a different generator.
"600 Mw is a good average size of a coal power plant, however HEA, the co-op in the article does not have any coal facilities. They are burning natural gas and a small deisel for power."
Considering the population density of Alaska I doubt they have the demand to support a plant anywhere near an average size.
"It also opens up the possibility of adding more renewables into the mix, since excess solar generation during the day can be saved instead of being wasted, which can then be used during the night (and, viceversa, excess wind during the night can be saved to be used during the day).  Gives much more design flexibility."
I was thinking shipping containers and I see that's what they are using. Wonder why they wouldn't also stack them vertically to use space more efficiently.
"Your missing the point.

Made up numbers here:

Let's say you do the math and you need 8000 units of power storage from this facility, you have 10 acres of land, you can fit 100 trailers per acre, and each trailer provides 10 units of storage. So you need 800 trailers, covering 8 acres to start with. 

After four years the trailers have decreased in efficiency to 9 units in average, including one trailer catastrophically failed. So you only have 7200 units of power available. Therefore you order 80 additional trailers to bring you up to your total need, and you have 8.8 acres used. In addition you pull out the failed trailer and have those batteries recycled. 

Eventually when you go to add more trailers to make up for lost capacity you will realize you are going to run out of space for them. At this point you have to pull out the least efficient trailers and replace them. These are still useful though, so they go to a secondary facility, or are reused for other purposes."
"Only practical with CSP.  Which doesn't really make sense in the far north of Alaska.

Not completely. It actually will enable them to shut down more generators at backup power plants and occasionally the entire plant when usually they would leave them idling for quick ability to ramp up power.

Sure. But I mean like rain forest with that wicked rain. Corrosive and tons of it. May need a whole structure and drains.
"Well even an iPhone is ""weather proof"" I don't recommend putting into an acidic water puddle or salt water body. Shit eats away at the protective coatings."
That's for a small gas unit. Most coal units have 24+ hour start ups. 2 of my gas units have 7 hour start times and 36 hour min run. They're base units though and might get cycled 5 times a year so it's not as much of an issue.
"It's better to think of the Alaska population centers, namely Anchorage (291k), Juneau (32k), and Fairbanks (31k), rather than Alaska as a whole. (Everything else has less than 10,000 people.) The majority of Alaska doesn't even have accessible roads, let alone anything resembling a power ""grid"". Anchorage is 20 hours away from Juneau. Anchorage is 6 hours away from Fairbanks. Fairbanks is 17 hours from Juneau."
"The gas plants they currently have are more like 42 to 76 Mw.  So they have no use for a coal plant of that size, hence the smaller gas units."
"Yeah that all makes sense. But I was thinking batteries could be stacked vertically like shipping containers (as long as the infrastructure required to stack them is cheaper than the value of the aged batteries) so land cost and use could be minimized. Also the time scales of decay are probably much longer than your example. Regardless, I was just pointing out that capacity is a different factor than efficiency.
Here is an example about that. Lets say each time you use those 8000 new units of storage you lose 10 units to charging losses. 4 years later you are losing 20 units each charge/discharge cycle. So before replacing them you have to compare the cost of that extra 10 units of lost electricity vs buying 800 new trailers to eliminate those losses again. Most likely the losses will need to be much more than 20/8000 units per cycle before it is economical to replace them but it really depends on how frequently they are used and the money saved by not using an inefficient peaker plant.
So you see, the efficiency of charge cycles is also a factor. The way I see it, a power plant won’t use all of its storage capacity every day. So it's not so important to have peak efficiency on all your storage, just the amount that is regularly used."
And cycle losses are not such a big deal for offgridders who would normally have extra land to spare or have the ability to make use of the top of the battery box.
"Totally. Just naming crazy energy storage systems. Never seen a molten salt storage system.

But to your other point, nuclear is not a physics issue, it’s a construction issue. Looking at the last 30 nuclear reactors built in the US, they are 3-5x over budget, and take on average 20 years to complete. So nuclear is a great solution if you can afford to wait 🤷‍♂️

I often wonder if it would be possible to have a production line at Honeywell or GE and use smaller reactors we build for carriers and submarines, then just sink those into a hole in the ground. Might get around the construction issue. Plus, stimulating defense contractors might get congressional votes who don’t normally vote for green energy."
"In short...yes. This is like a big backup battery. Other fuel sources charge it at low utilization times, and it discharges when load exceeds capacity."
"Most likely in the short term, yes. But it prevents peaker plants from firing up as often which will be a win environmentally.

I want to assume Alaska is in a good position for wind energy, so these batteries may spur some development."

There's plenty of waste heat at a power plant. Also the batteries themselves will get hot as they charge.

"Absolutely not but its a part of it. Getting efficiency up and fossil fuel use down is a first step to showing the economics which in turn can churn future investment once locals see $ savings in real time rather than calculated.

Alaska is at least for this post an island. Islands typically are a bit away from things centrally, somewhat complicated travel, and expensive. Alaska's latitude makes it more extreme

Block Island for example between long island and rhode island ran off of diesel generators for decades. 2 years ago they put up one of the first wind farms. Electricity is still expensive something like 24 cents KWH but the new rate is saving residents 30$ a month off their bill. While saving something like 1 million gallons of diesel being ferried to burn over per year.

Or Teslas NSW, opposite end of the spectrum from Alaska, battery that is getting expanded. Getting people off of paying peak rates is in itself saving money and opens the door to expanding renewables"
"> Sooo...maybe a really small gas peaker plant?

I don't think so, but I could certainly be wrong.  Its a new tool in the toolbox that has different abilities, but it performs the same function.  I'm not an expert on this by any means.  From what I understand the base load powerplant is a ""slow to ramp up slow to ramp down"" beast that can put out a huge amount of electricity.  However that slow is likely 20-30 minutes of ramp up or down.  Hence the need for natural gas peaker plants.  However, the NG peaker has its own ramp up of 2 to 4 minutes for the fastest units. The battery's ramp up time is miliseconds potentially meaning lower baseload capacity needed for the majority of the time.

[Here's a site listing utility grade peaker generator products at 10MW to 50MW](https://www.clarke-energy.com/natural-gas/peaking-station-peak-lopping-plants/) which falls right in line with the high side of this battery."

Are you serious? 'Acidic water puddle'? What are you talking about? Rainwater is not notably acidic - certainly not to the point that any existing electrical grid infrastructure is 'acid-proofed'!

Salt-water is corrosive, but since we already have offshore wind farms, and high voltage undersea transmission lines, I think they've got that problem solved too - especially for installations on... **dry land....**"
"Yeah, you are going way deeper here than I am. The core point is that you just drive up a semi, drop the trailer, plug it in, monitor it, and when you don't need it anymore you drive up a semi, pick up the trailer, and drive it away. Then replace it with another one the same way. They logistics of how long the batteries last and when it's best to replace them is easy more than we need to speculate upon. It is about the ease, not the details.


Also, stacking batteries on top of each other would defeat the concept. It needs to be logistically trivial to add and remove batteries to the system after you built the initial facility. Also, with the weight of batteries, stacking them may not be the best idea. The best way to solve these problems is to just build an oversized parking structure. Takes less ground space, provides a roof, allows easy drop off and pick up, and the stress of holding up the batteries can be put on a properly engineered structure, rather than on other batteries."

This is a uniquely American problem.  Other nuclear powered countries - France and South Korea are the best examples, have nuclear power industries that have largely avoided the bureaucratic and management obstacles that manifest as expensive delays and ballooning costs.  I remember reading somewhere that aspects of the federal nuclear apparatus in the US has readily acknowledged the regulatory environment is too stiff and could be streamlined without compromising safety or integrity.

We have faced an uphill battle in the decades since TMI as anti-nuclear activism has turned the tide of public sentiment and taken all the momentum out of domestic nuclear energy.  But small, nimble, and mass-producable is indeed where the new generation of small modular reactors are heading.  With the benefit of decades of new technological and industrial insights since the last generation of reactors were built, these are going to be the safest, cheapest, and most efficient nuclear power plants yet.  Presently Oregon's NuScale is leading the pack, being the farthest along the regulatory approval process in the US.  But al significant number of the major nuclear industry players around the world have a SMR program in some stage of development."

"No, it shows kWh/100km when moving as an efficiency figure. This is the ""avg. economy"" display that shows you how efficiently you are using the electric/petrol."
That's because it's not giving you the amount of energy you're currently using its averaging it out over an hour and taking into account potential peaks in the amount of energy being used.
"Dont get me wrong, i'm all for this. This is a positive development, and my gripe is with the coverage clearly ignoring an opportunity to show how the transition to cleaner alternatives happens, in favor of promoting a ""torches and pitchforks for the industry"" attitude which is disingenuous and harmful, as a LOT more carbon emitting powerplants will adopt tools like this to make themselves more efficient, *long* before the energy grid en masse begins moving to a renewable framework.

I'm sure there is a solution. did not say there isn't. I just said they have to prove it. I never claimed the large storage batteries could not withstand it. I claimed they have not been proven to work there. BIG difference.
"Oh. I see I really was on a tangent.
It looks like megapacks (like xu00 commented) are basically just shipping containers. Still need a special trailer though to lift those up onto a trailer but such trailers do exist.

I'm not a big fan of the parking deck structure as that is a lot of added expense and use of cement (co2) (more than normal decks since it has to be high enough between levels for a semi to load inside of). And seaboxes can hold a lot of weight so I'd expect they could be stacked at least 3 or 4 high (like a fourth of the height they reach on ships). Just depends on if assembling a crane or easily transportable high lift heavy weight forklift is cheaper than building a permanent deck. Still could drive them in and out and wouldn't need special lifting trailers if a crane could load them.

It doesn't need to be trivial to replace bad boxes since Tesla's design disables any bad cells so the longevity is much longer than you seem to be thinking.
Also they could build a roof out of solar panels. I wish they would."
That sounds like good news.
It is still a big win because fossil fuel plants are pretty inefficient for gap filling during peak times.  The batteries are much better.
"It's still a big win for the environment. Also, in time, it will provide lots of old batteries that offgridders can buy to stay off grid while getting more reliable power. And for such cold places as Alaska, cogeneration plants would be a good solution for heat and power."
Top-notch fishing in Glenn Beck.
"I get that but people have been pushing to transition to renewable for a while and were plain denied and laughed at in the US. European offshore wind is down to something like .13 c  per MWH, while higher than .9 for new european coal plants its comparable to what i pay in New England .13c per MWH,before taxes and fees bring it up to .20 cents per MWH, off of a slightly mixed but fossil fuel dominated grid.

People are fed up and led to a big angry push. Unfortunately i think its deserved. Fossil fuel companies could have diversified and started to help a buildout 19+ years ago. 

Now people are sick and fed up and they are acting whether in their reporting or personal purchases while others are being dragged kicking and screaming like toddlers trying to protect their old investments.

There is a line and while rational people exist on both sides. The fossil die hards might just need some people on the left to go for green just as hard as they are clasping to their dividends.

If you're going to add extra stuff to the scenario like hurricanes etc., then you need a different kind of structural protection, but it's not because the structure is not fundamentally water-resistant.

To which, everyone has pointed out that 'high rain fall' isn't something that causes an issue for electrical installations - you yourself have linked to a picture of a substation in a shed - similar to how they are installed in my country. Weatherproofing electrical installations against rain is not 'unproven' - it's century old technology. Your later addition of 'rain forest', to try and back up your faulty point is just pointless distraction - rain forests just have higher average rain, and a few more heavy rainstorms - nothing that isn't covered by existing rain-proofing standards.

The FACT is that standards already exist for rain-proofing of outdoor electrical installations, and 'high-volume rain' is not a specific thing. If it is waterproof for one rainstorm, it is waterproof for a rainstorm every day, all year round.

If your OPINION is that Tesla haven't already tested these to the international standard for water ingress protection (IEC 60529), then your OPINION is wrong.

You are hopping into a car that hurts the planet less and lets you be on the leading edge of a new paradigm in automobiles.

Many Model 3's are purchased after months/years of saving and feel like an achievement to buy.

Or maybe someone did something cool/unique to make their Model 3's appearance their own.

In short, perhaps the thrill of delivery day is a faded memory for some, but for people just joining the family, let them have their fun.  You always have the freedom to skip past those posts."
Amen!
I’m happy with it. You can post any content you like. If you want to talk about Tesla there is another sub. If you want to talk about model 3 this is it!!! Including posting ya sexy stock m3 ;)
"I was just thinking that yesterday.

Everyone's model 3 looks the fucking same but everyone keeps posting it.

It's irritating and annoying.

I might have to unsub"
"I feel like some of the pictures are okay, when they are in an interesting place / pose, but almost all of them are super lazy photos."
What other posts do you want to see here?  What content are you contributing?
Q4 Stonks
I actually like seeing people showing off there cars :)
"What‘s your problem with that? People who are posting those photos here are genuinely excited about their decision and investment to go electric. Let them have their moment. It always reminds me of „my moment“ earlier this year.

I browse this sub maybe once a day, and I don’t have the feeling that I cannot keep up with „real Model 3 news“, because they‘re buried in hundred of photo posts. And yes, I still enjoy looking at nice pictures of Model 3s. Some people put in a real effort into making those pictures."
"Is it possible to make it one of the ""report"" options?  Never really looked at those before, so not sure how it works"
Disagree. I like seeing people excited about their M3.
"Its so damn cringey

 Who still names their cars? 

“saY heLlO to TabAtha guys”"
I like these posts - the posters are so happy and I like welcoming them to the club.
Ba humbug. It’s nice that people can spread their joy about their experience with getting a Tesla.
"LOL... i feel like my post was the one that broke the camels back.  Lots of excited new owners, but agree they belong in a superthread for that kind of thing."
"I love them, then again, I am not the kind of person who hates other people being happy in public."
Meat*
I don't mind seeing all the introductory posts. I love seeing how proud we all are of our Model 3's! I say post away and let's see them all!
Thank you
I don't mind this if they are telling me about the features
That is such a pet peeve for me. It's literally just bragging that they got it first.
I personally want more content about the stock hitting 420.69
"The most interesting thing about that kind of post are the new features they're seeing, ie carpool lane indicators from yesterday. More of that please, less of ""oh look I'm downloading!"""
Very few ppl would actively view that channel. Youth will more likely tag / graffiti in places that *are seen*
"""Check out my chrome delete"""
"I only downvote those that name their car. Hello reddit, meet trixie. It bugs me."
"The problem is that most people UPvote. ""ohh congrats, ill get mine soon, yay, yahoo, yippee."" So until those people stop, we're screwed. I usually Report for rule 2."
"2018 owner here. Should of eased up a year ago. I cringe at ""new"" YouTube videos uploaded for people trying to get views on the ""2020"" version. They are a little late."
Yes! I love the joy with which our new friends join the family :-)
I’ve contributed some content here :)
My thoughts exactly.
Me too and I’m happy for them but it’s just a little old that’s all.
"The software literally asks you to give your car a nickname, because it is used in the app, in your account and on your car‘s display!

Edit: Sorry, I should have used „our“. Have fun with your (nameless) Prius."
You want a nice thick steak?
"Wow, r u serious?"
i agree! but most of the image posts i’ve seen are just pics of the updating status from their car/app which should really belong in the pinned megathread.
at least you have a tesla
There's already sub for it
Fine by me.
"That's still better than a completely stock photo of someone's model 3 without an interesting background.

But I may be biased because I want to do a chrome delete, but won't be doing it since I'm leasing and don't really think it's worth it"
"As someone who likes chrome, I get sad every time I see one of those posts. 

To each their own though, as long as they like their car, that's what matters."
My Tesla's name is literally Model 3.
I thought I was the only one who thought it’s retarded.
“Meet my new model 3 Sapphire” so lame
Seems like no matter what there are so many repetitive posts and videos with every new software update too...
"You pretentious goofball “2018 owner here”. 
You are no better than the people this thread is complaining about."
"Lmfao and of course, struck a nerve with one of the losers that did exactly that. Have fun with your lame ass car naming

You’re so pathetic you had to go searching through my post history. Sad"
Tube steak
That certainly is a prerequisite to getting software updates from Tesla.

Especially unusual colors and tints. Those posts helped me decide which I should go with.
[deleted]
That sucks too but in the other direction
Same
just reply with links to actual horrible people with the same name.
Don't be rediculous. There are thousands before me.  I'm only a 40k vin number.
I really like the pics of people's wraps because it's something you can't get stock and so far the ones I've seen have been amazing.
"This I’m okay with because it’s unique.  It’s the “look at my car on delivery day” posts that are not really beneficial to this community is all.  

Don’t get me wrong I enjoy a well taken photo of a stock model 3 in a beautiful area like the Rockys but a shot of your car in the delivery center parking lot isnt anything special."
"That's not bad, but I am less than confident in my ability and patience to put it on properly haha"
Pro tip: don’t drink and reddit. Merry Christmas.
Agreed.  Those are chill to look at.

"I might give it a shot. I really think the blue with a chrome delete would look amazing.

I was mostly seeing the prices for having it done professionally and couldn't justify the cost for a 3 year lease"
Look at the happiness on his face 😊😊❤️❤️❤️
Have him go 88mph
Your dads smile makes me smile 😊
I love this picture. Welcome to the family! Tell him to press the fun pedal all the way down every now and then :D
[deleted]
Best picture ever!  Congratulations to your dad!
He built that? Nice work!
"It's like a dream come true, I'm happy for you guys!"
"He knew. Your dad has known all along what electrical has  going for it, not the least of which is maximum torque at zero RPMs, and no need for a transmission."
That's adorable. I hope he gets a lot of joy from driving his new model 3.
give your dad a hug from me please. He’s awesome.
What a great story. Would like to see pictures of his build vehicles.
Many congrats on his new purchase!  I'm sure he'll be able to appreciate an EV like no other ...
Thats awesome.
Congratulations to your Dad!  Team Pearl White!
"Priceless :)

Congrats!"
Love this!!!

"Yes! — and watch the film Framing John DeLorean. Putting aside all the legal trouble he got into, DeLorean’s launching of the DMC-12 in Ireland is reminiscent of the “production hell” we all saw with the Model 3 last year. It’s a fascinating story."
"My dad was a double E and taught me all about the properties of electrical motors, so I knew in theory that electrical cars could be awesome. (He never built me a go-cart though!!) 

When I actually told my dad I bought one of these - well, let's just say the gas company's had gotten to him, and he was sure it was a bad idea."
I'm going to dig out some old pics to do a little then & now comparison 😊
"They use less power for the AC in summer, and they give you plenty of opportunities to wash the car for people with too much time on their hands."
"I live in Washington State, US, where it gets very dark very early in winters. It helps that other cars and pedestrians can better make the outline of my car because it’s white. Also, these Teslas are “pearl white,” and the color is gorgeous. Plus, i didn’t have to pay extra for another color."
I was just joking mate. I don't have a Tesla so I shouldn't even talk haha. It's an absolutely gorgeous car and I wish you a lot of happiness with yours.
" Nevertheless, you’re right! I paid good money to not have white."
That colors sick.  Probably looks even better in the sun!
I'm really liking the upper blackout look

What color was the car originally? WoW
Satin blue? Very nice! What's the car's original color and how does it look when you for example open a door?
I had plans to buy a red P3D but this post just made me confused. Holy shit that looks good.
What’s the official color for this? Love it.
Alles in OBI
That looks SO stinking gorgeous! Wrap like that here in AZ would run me about $2400. Love the look -- enjoy your Model 3! :)
S3XY. Well done.
I really like that! Mine will be here in a week.
Love it 👍
How much did the wrap cost?
How much do wraps normally cost?
Looks nice.
🤤
"Color, wheels, chrome delete, all dope. Love it bra!"
How much does something like this cost?
Bruhhh lawd have mercy that's tight! 🔥🔥🔥
"Sick, I had my car dipped that color but the dip was trash. I want to attempt my own wrap one day lol"
Love the color!
Nice. Now you just need some tint and you’re good to go. Btw which rims are those? Are those just the Aero rims without the wheel covers?
Love the color choice. Are gonna patch the PDCs? and I would recommend going with the Oracal recommend lifetime and not exceeding it. I have seen plenty of times how an overused wrap can destroy a paint job.
That’s such a beautiful colour omg
Does the wrap change anything in terms of how the car works?  Is it removable for resale?  How long does it last?
This is fucking sickkk I love it
Id still key it if i saw it in the streets
There is not much sun where he is...
I was also confused if I should wrap the A/C pillar but then due to laziness ending up with half blackout
Its black.
The colors is Ultra Marine Violet. Its shifting color wrap by Oracal. Original is Black and black.
Original: Black. Wrap: Ultra Marine Violet by Oracal.
Ja richtig
Around 500 EUR in total and 20 hours of effort.
2000-3000
2000-3000
Yes they r the aero rims without the cover. I am not sure about the legal norms in Germany for tinting.
"Probably a noob question, what is PDC?
As per Oracal recommendation in my region the vinyl would last atleast 3 years without damaging the paint job and removal will leave less than 20% adhesive. So my target is 2 years."
"No, yes, atleast 3 years"
Smile for the cameras ;)
Did you wrap it yourself?
">How much wrap do you need to get? 20 hours because first time or because it is needed.   
You used a heat gun?"
And they typically last 3-5 years right
Gotcha. Those rims with that color look superb. Definitely look into tint laws for your area and see if they even enforce them. Tint is one of the best mods I ever did to my car. Cops where I live don’t care at all. Though I am in USA.
"Park. Distance. controller. The proximity sensors on the bumpers. The black circles. Since this is a color shift you would want to cut out the circlers the same way the color is going. 

Good plan. The Color shifts don't tend to last as long as the solid colors but damn it look cool!"
Yes. My first try with wrapping.
I got 16 m x 1.52 m of wrap and everything was finished at the end. Its my first time so I do not have a benchmark of what actually was needed. Yes I did use the heat gun to trigger the memory effect of the vinyl when it messed up and on the front and rear bumper. Everywhere else was without heating.
"Oh ya. Got it. Just for testing purpose i did not cut the vinyl when they overlap the sensors (just 2), that did not affect the functionality. Later on I decided to uncover all of them."
Impressive. Would you do it yourself again?
Got you. Sometimes I cut out the circles separately and put it on or I just wrap over it and it still is fine.
"Yes for sure, when I do it myself I know exactly what is underlying the wrap. No surprises when it is removed ;)"
Is that via the YouTube hack?
You can also surf other types of site with the YouTube app hack...
Would someone be willing to help the less informed folks how this YouTube hack works?
It is the way.
This is the way.
Did it not at one point?  I never had any issues with it.
Would Kodi work with this?
This is the way. Of the future.
"I need Plex, anyone know if its in the works?"
It always has. Been using D+ in my car since day 1 of launch with 0 issue.
D+ still does not work over LTE in the US.
Yes. Full screen through the YouTube App workaround
What's the YouTube hack?
Like reddit.com right?
Plex for the win
https://youtu.be/ARQ6ll8yzBo
I have spoken
"Disney+ didn't work in the Tesla browser or any Linux browser for that matter, and it got fixed on Disney's end."
Plex works already. Tested it on my car.
I was getting that error 83 thing.  Gonna try this later today.
Did this not work at some point that working is new?
oh bummer... I thought they fixed it not working on Linux...
Go into youtube then search for “google.com”. The results should have a link in the description which allows you to go to google (and thus anywhere on the web) while in full screen mode.
*66
Correct. It threw an error code related to playback on Linux.
"They did fix out. It now works on Linux, and that's why it works on Tesla now."
Does this work for Plex as well?
Thank you for this.
"I thought Tesla already gave you a web browser? Why use this ""hack""?"
You da MVP
Interesting. Did you get an update to the car or did Disney just change something?
Oh gotcha! YouTube is only required to get full screen. I misunderstood. Cool glad they fixed it. Was beginning to feel like 2005
Yes. I've used it
Yes
The web browser won’t do full screen video.
"The web browser can only take up about 2/3 of the screen. Basically the area the gps usually is. You cant make it cover the area where the spedometer and car visualization is. Netflix, youtube etc go full screen since they can only be used in park. As soon as you hit drive they close. They should really just add a full screen browser that behaves the same way for use in park."
It was a problem with their DRM not liking linux apparently. It also didnt work on some smart tvs like Vizios for that reason.
"Someone ask Elon on Twitter for a “refrigerated frunk” option, ASAP!"
That is a great TreeHouse haul. Enjoy the Julius!

Tree House!!!!!!"
And treehouse has 50a destination chargers that mean you can always park in the upper lot!
I see space for peanuts
"Hmm, I see room for 4 cases. 😆"
"Oh and that’s craft, too. 16ozers! Looks like I know where I’m storing them my next Veil run!"
The tears of joy are blinding me right now... I'm imagining how many cases of beer i will be able to put into my cybertruck trunk....
"whoa, baby! Good to know!"
oh man thought I was on r/drunk
You know the frunk is where I carry all my booze at in my 3
I WAS wondering!
"Finally!!

A practical use for the Frunk."
Yea well I fit 4 Bourbon County stouts in that little hole on the left in the trunk. I do hear them rattle when I drive. Probably a low iq move by me.
Where I'm from those are two flats of beer!
You don’t need frunk hooks to store beer. Want to sell them to me?
I hate this! I just bought a 6 pack of raging bitch... Drove home... Drank 4..  paid 2k for the acceleration boost and can't even test it out
Not an accident
AND MY AXE
It’s the cooler car.
Nice. It is where I keep my Red Bull.
This is information that I didn't know I needed until now. Thanks!
What about weed
came here to say treehouse.
"Destination charger too, no?"

"Cans and bottles in the Model 3, keg in the Cyber Truck"
Hoodgate or Headgate?
Nice! I’d hate to see what your fridge looks like haha
[deleted]
Magical place. The last couple times I’ve gone there were a couple ICE vehicles occupying chargers
Yea the Ryot Pro duffle fits in the frunk with lots of extra space.
"That's also legal in the state of Massachusetts!  Tree House brewery, and then the dispensary!"
"Frailgate?

Sounds like a octogenarian dance party."
The basement beer fridge looks fine!  There was no room to keep them neat! We had Trillium in the trunk!  HAHA
This is actually helpful just so I never get in it
"Guilty, your honor."
Not with the Cybertruck out.
Congrats! Best wishes to you for 2020!
"Sounds like the start to a string of luck!

Congrats on the acquisition!"
End of quarter push. Good for you. Sorry for the loss of your dad. I’ve had that myself. Enjoy your car and welcome to the family.
Nothing fixes you like taking a quick drive down the highway just for the heck of it. I have done it and looked down at the trip meter and found that I just drove an hour.
Congratulations! Here’s to silently zipping along in 2020.
Congrats. You won't regret it!
"Sorry to hear about your dad. What’s the catch with the car, though?!"
"Lost my dad as well this year, and I also picked up a Model 3. I bet both of our dad's would've been in awe over the cars! Congrats and best of luck to you!"
"Gotta say... I am moved by all of the supportive comments here... thanks, Reddit! Faith in digital humanity officially restored 😀"
The do that?  Thought the pricing  was fixed
You are gonna love it. Congrats bud
Great end to the year. I hope you love her
"Makes up for all the bad, doesn't it?! Enjoy!!"
Sounds like your year is about to improve. Enjoy!
"You won the T3sla lottery!  Congratulations.  Maybe plan on some all weather/snow tires with the savings, but maybe OR doesn't get much snow..."
"Wow!!
Looks like you are already bouncing back, stay strong!!"
Good on ya mate! I don’t know why I’m talking like I’m from Australia but it seems like the right thing to say
Welcome to the P3D  club! Looking good👍🏁
Beautiful car!  Glad you caught a break my man.  Happy holidays to you
Sending nothing but positive vibes your way! Welcome to the M3P Fam 🤗💙

congrats!
$52k out the door before government rebates.
"Thank you, kind Tesla friend! And to you :)"
Thank you kindly! Things are definitely looking up and feeling grateful I can even do this at all
That’s the strangest part! Zips along so fast too!
I love it!!!!
"Thank you. I live in Oregon, so no sales tax and the state does a rebate of $2500. Plus federal rebate of $1875 (fat fingered the $5800 figure above - should have said $4300 but actually $4375). This is a 2019 they said they had on the lot too long, so they discounted it $6280. I didn’t ask questions! Thought it would take weeks to get but I picked it up two days after ordering. Have heard others have had similar success when buying toward the end of the year after new models arrive."
"Bows to you, friend. And yes... I bet they would be."
I thought so too but that was the offer
Thank you!
I do!!
It goes a long way!
Thank you kindly!
"Good idea! Not in Portland proper but an hour east, most definitely needed. Hmmm..."
So far yes! Thank you!
"Agreed, thank you!"
"Thank you, good citizen of the digital domain!"
"Very kind words, thank you!"
Thank you! It’s a game changer... just love it!
Oregon
All the best to you! May you enjoy the quiet ride.
"I'm doing the same thing on a 2019 Performance!  I'm having a harder time with the process, though.  I'm an Oregon resident, but on military orders in Texas.  The idea of me registering in Oregon with a Texas address is breaking their system and putting my federal tax credit in jeopardy.  I even showed them the registration on my current car from Oregon with my Texas address.  Been working with the SA for a few days with little luck.  VERY frustrating.  i wish they would just let me handle the registration on my own."
Hey how do you get to a sales rep..? / how did you contact them or get them to contact you?
What was the final price?
Good for you bud
Indeed!!
"We once had a Mazda 3 that came with pretty slippery tires so we got a spare set of rims and tires for living in rural Connecticut.  It was a night and day difference in the winter, but a little loud on bare pavement. I haven’t bothered with snow tires since living in Illinois and only driving around town."
"Yeah I have Oregon disabled vet plates myself. They pushed back and said I just needed to register it old school and pay the fee, but I said no and got them to transfer the plate and reimburse the extra $300. Stay on them, they’ll do it. Am former Air Force, so if they won’t do it then off you go, into the wild blue yonder, friend!"
Did you try and ask them to register on your own? Is this something Tesla would allow?
You have to place an order online and they will call you. Or just walk into a Tesla store and go from there.
"They said they don’t allow self registration in Oregon.  However, things took a positive turn today and this thing looks like it’s going to come together.  If all goes well I’ll be in my MSM P3D in the 26th!"
"Very close to max!
I could not test it because I installer my winter tires a few minutes after taking delivery and i would not reach that speed on winter rubber...

0-200 is quick tho!!!"
Approx. 156 mph for those who don’t know the conversion (me!).
Was power limited as can be seen on the accelerator power usage bar.
"What do you mean by ""too busy""? Too many cars on the road?"
Busy? Too much traffic? At 157mph?
"Anyone impressed how quiet it is, even over 200kph? I bet any ICE car would be roaring to try and keep up."
"It goes all the way up to 262, I tested a couple times :) Only on summer tires though, those PS4S give enough confidence to try it. Winter tires, even good ones, I'll probably leave it be."
"I felt a little uncomfortable in my M3 LR AWD at 230 for more than a minute compared to my BMW 118, but it could be the steering I still had set to the comfy setting or whatever it’s called (not standard or sports).

And yeah, there’s so much roadwork in Germany, but the speed limit in the Netherlands makes it difficult to drive fast over there. And their speeding tickets are expensive as hell 😃. Worse in Switzerland though LOL"
Looks like my Shinkansen (bullet train in Japan) videos.  How I wish I could drive my Model 3 in California.
"Although I’m cursing here as I’m driving a new BMW 330i, I do appreciate these movies a lot!"
"Every country should have an Autobahn. German Engineering at its finest. Nothing compares to it... so much fun to drive on them, with excellent signage."
"The max I've gone is 104mph ever. In my BMW 3 series.

Tesla I've hit 95mph and stopped.

Just don't feel comfortable exceeding speed limits.

Watching this video gave me anxiety as well... I mean it's life over if something happens at those speeds."
What’s that in American?
So close to max!
Nice! Now if only there were cones along the road - the driving visualization would have been like Asteroids!
Post your energy consumption haha I’m curious what that was like
I have winter on it too right now... Pirelli Winter SottoZero 3 235/35 R20 92W
"I was gonna say I had never seen a car that could go that fast, mine maxes out at 140, only hit it once screaming across the desert in Arizona. 250 would be mind blowing in MPH though"
TY
"Mph to kmh 

60 ≈ 100 (96.6 actual)

100 ≈ 160 (160.9 actual. More accurate thumbrule and easier to scale)"
Where do you see the power limiting?
Not for long with the heat that would be generating I'm sure...
Yes very crowded highways.
Too busy to cruise at 260+ km/h. Again as I’ve said to others here if you’re not used to the autobahn you will never understand this.
"It’s not very quiet actually... no motor noise but wind noise is terrible on the model 3. In general the Model 3 Performance is not very sound proof compared to similarly priced cars.

At any speeds above 120km/h it’s actually noisy and annoying. I wish I could give someone 2000€ to make it sound proofed better.

I’ve heard some added door rubbers improve this, will install these sometime coming month.

I have the feeling my BMW was more quiet at 200 km/h... there was engine sound, yes, but that’s just a low hum. Versus the windy sounds the Tesla makes and tire sounds."
Sottozero 3 are rated up to 270 km/h
"You might want to check wheel alignment and balancing... 

Also the 18” wheels on the M3 AWD are a lot more wobbly than the 20” I’ve had a 118i with 18” and it was less “straight” and felt more jumpy than the Model 3 Performance. Using Sport steering always."
There’s no cameras in the Netherlands on the highway... also I don’t receive the tickets since I have a Swiss plate ;) heheeheh I change the plate now and then and never receive any EU tickets 😏 but tbh I abide all speed restrictions... I sometimes speed a little on the highway. But only by 15-20 km/h.
"The Netherlands has better highway roads in general, made of porous material that lets through rain, so never have a wet road. The problem in the Netherlands is its a lot more crowded meaning high speed driving is only possible at night. And even then I never exceed 150 km/h."
Let’s teach people how to drive first.
"My record from the Netherlands to Switzerland over the Autobahn was 5 hours and 14 minutes. With an average speed of 136.4 km/h. Maximum speeds of above 260 km/h. With quiet parts cruising at 250km/h for over 30 minutes. No speed limits were broken. Except some part where I drove 100 where it was 80 due to constructions... my fault. The grey signage you see on my display means no speed restriction in Germany. 

This was with a BMW however, with a Tesla this is never achievable due to charging times.

If you haven’t driven the autobahn you don’t know what it’s like. 

People behave and stay away from the left lane mostly unless needed to overtake. Someone behind you? You move away, over to the right. Because even at 250 km/h there’s always someone faster than you ;)"
"It's the Autobahn, they drive proper it's safe.  The roads are better than some NASCAR tracks.

I did 200 kph in a Volkswagen Jetta diesel (average more around 150 kph)."
That looks like the autobarn. A road designed for high speed.
156 miles par heure
Through the roof... 😂
Oh nice! I have to do some research on speed ratings. Im on Nokian Hakka 9
"Blizzaks on mine, can't get over how loud they are"
Tesla Roadster 2020
"The long black line just below the battery bar. If it reaches all the way to the right side (starting from the center), you’re at full power. You get a similar green light that moves to the left from the center to show you regen."
"Cruising at 230 km/h was quite sustainable for longer periods, but your battery is empty in no time. The biggest problem is getting to the speed, maintaining it is fine and doesn’t generate as much heat. Especially now in winter it’s about freezing point. So the car cools better maybe."
There was a youtuber that did a 24 hour marathon without any stops except to supercharge. I believe he set a world record for distance travelled in an EV in one day
Do slower drivers have to stay on one side of the Autobahn?
[deleted]
"Doubling up the door seals is supposed to help a lot, if done properly. I plan to do it on mine next year some time. Got used to the noise level by now and I'm not annoyed by it, but quieter is always better, and it'll help keep the door sill areas clean as well."
Sounds quiet in the video. I wonder if other cars have the extra sound insulation because of the engine as well.
"Just reading this now, quick question. Where did you get the door rubbers? Kind of annoyed by the noise on the highway as well. Not as quite as we had hoped at least."
"So are my Contis TS860S. But the driving feel is very different, the car feels much more planted on the Michelins. Contis are actually a bit quieter and ride smoother, but they don't quite have the same grip on dry asphalt."
"My ticket from the A2 from 2 years ago begs to differ 😂

I also have to pay up since I’m German, but mostly I drive at or only slightly above the speed limit in the Netherlands. Germany not as strict, but still not dangerous."
"Also the Autobahn, blinker means they’re moving into your lane even when you’re overtaking them by 50+ km/h anyway."
"Yeah, I've gathered that already and that they don't have speed limits there on at least parts of the Autobahn

Not saying he's doing anything illegal. I'm just saying I'm not comfortable at those speeds. 

Given the chance in a safe area - like middle of Nevada desert with like 30 mile radius of open dry lake bed, I don't mind wearing safety gear and hitting the 250mph in a BMW/Tesla or even 400mph in those rocket powered cars. 

But not on regular roads. Just don't trust that something won't fly at the windshield and cause an accident or some idiot will cut in front and cause an accident. Accidents from which you don't recover."
Mine are 270kmh rated. They are Tesla delivered. I have a silver set of 20” rims for winter and the grey 20” for summer.
I meant because the pack is cold that's why you're power limited. Driving at max speed generates a lot of heat and would warm the pack giving you max power quicker than driving at normal pace.
What IS your range like when you cruise at Autobahn speeds?  I’m already distressed how much my battery life suffers if I try to cruise at 80mph here!
"That is, the one and only Björn Nyland. https://youtu.be/R-2Yj-uVeB0"
"There is a law to stick to the right side when possible and overtaking is only allowed in the left side but that doesn’t prevent people to A) drive on the left for no reason and B) overtaking with 120km/h while you are like 100m behind them, approaching with 230km/h"
"It seems fairly obvious (not from Germany). The roads are crowded enough that you need to concentrate at high speed (to avoid ramming into the back of someone who moves into the overtaking lane to overtake but much slower than you're approaching at), therefore limiting the time you can spend driving at high speed."
Mostly because other car manufacturers in the same price range spent more money on sound dampening than Tesla. Also a BMW is made for high speeds... Tesla is made for American 60mph. (My guess)
"Go try some Sottozero 3 they are really amazing for winter tires... braking distance is only a tad bit longer. Grip is great, and on the clean roads here it’s fine actually. They are just a bit louder."
Do you know the app Flitsmeister? Everyone in the Netherlands uses that. Lists all speed cameras and speed sections. Even the mobile ones.
"It happens, but most people judge correctly if it’s safe to move into your lane or not. I’ve had to make a tire screeching stop once when a girl came onto the left lane, while doing her hair in the rear view mirror... had no clue what dangerous situation she had just created in her Volkswagen UP."
"People in Germany know how to drive the autobahn... also they are clean... this is not Northern America. People actually learn how to drive safely and use mirrors in over 25 to 40 hours of driving lessons by a licensed instructor. 

Judge by the street fatalities Europe VS Northern America. Europe has half the fatalities. Now check it again just comparing Germany and the Netherlands etc to Northern America. It’s probably 1/4th or 1/3rd. And most of it doesn’t happen on the highway anyway. 

Again you should drive here once to know how well people drive in general.

(My message sounds negative, I don’t mean it that way, just trying to show driving style is greatly different here vs in the USA for example.)"
"Driving a car over 160kph is taking a risk. Good cars with good tires on good roads can go a great deal faster and still remain stable and in control, but all high speed driving is risky. 

All of life is risky. Crossing a busy street is risky. We all evaluate risk differently, too. I saw this video and immediately decided I want to drive the autobahn. You saw something else. Vive la difference."
"Baller!! I wouldn’t dare driving in the winter on 20” wheels on our terrible roads (Montreal, Canada). I installed Nokians on 18” wheels for better comfort and less chance to break a wheel.

Streets here are like Bagdad...

Im not even sure I will keep the oem 20” for summer :("
50% efficiency
Ahh so same as the highways here in the states lol. Grandma cruising under the speed limit in the left lane
"No that’s great, thank you! We’re going to NL at least once a year so that will be really helpful."
"Same thing happened to me once with an Audi, and I almost lost control of the car. I think it was at 'just' 220km/h. I learned my lesson, it was the last time I drove that fast."
"I only drive German, Swiss, and Dutch highways... those are so good you can eat from them. :) tbh no real need for winter tires... but it’s nice for those few times I drive in the snow in the mountains in Switzerland. 

Netherlands: http://jip.li/nk/rn80q"
"I noticed one of these... :( 



 So here take this... :D"
50% vs the advertised range?  I just did a 140 mile highway trip with autopilot at 70-75mph at all times and my P3D burned 70% battery so that already puts my “regular” range at about 65% of what Tesla claims.
"Is this all of the US? Because I see some videos where people overtake on the right like it’s normal. Also Autopilot is overtaking on the Right too, that shouldn’t be a thing IMO."
"If you're driving slow in the left, then ya you'll probably be passed on the right. The correct way is to pass in left and then move back over to the right. In my state there's a law that you can't sit in the left lane but people still do it."
"Also works for Germany, Belgium, France etc. Use it everyday. It’s awesome!"
"Lost control of the car? Because you started steering... probably. Also did it occur somewhere where it was even legal to drive that speed? 

You should brake fully but never try steer away at those speeds. Period. Same with animals on the road."
agreed the roads in Netherlands are immaculate. too much roadwork in Germany though 😉
That is AMAZING man!! You are very lucky!!
Good speed.  How fast you eat up range?  Video seems shaky. Is ride shaky or phone with bad video stabilization.
Da mag nie!
"Tire pressure, tyre type, outdoor temperature etc all affects it."
People overtake on the right as a result of people cruising in the left lane at slow speeds. Not ideal for sure but is either that or block traffic if they don't wanna move.
Overtaking on the right is illegal in Europe.
"It's a long time ago (> 20 years) , so I don't remember all the details. I don't think I was steering, but maybe I did very slightly. There would have been no point in steering, the rail was just left of me. It may be that the brakes braked unevenly (it was a company car, not mine). Anyway, I now think it was idiotic to drive at that speed. I think 180 km/h is a good cruising speed though if there is light traffic.

I don't want to be that guy, but I think it's irresponsible to drive at more than 200 km/h, even on the German Autobahn. Things change very fast at that speed. Of course doing their hair on the freeway is irresponsible, but a car speeding at 250 seems to appear out of nowhere quickly if they just want to pass a truck. If there had been an accident it would have been your responsibility as well."
It’s a friend using snapchat...
"Yeah of course, was just curious what baseline 100% you’re using for that comparison.  I’m in Southern California so while it was under 40F for half my drive yesterday I should still be close to “standard” with a dead-standard 3 month old P3D.  

So all I was getting at is if you can get 50% of Tesla’s advertised range driving ~150mph then I don’t need to be so conscientious about trying to keep it close to 70mph!"
It's not legal here under normal circumstances either but we still do it.  You're saying no one in EU ever does it?
"I slow down at any truck for that reason, she changed lane for no apparent reason it’s dangerous yes. I do think cars got better in the part 20 years. But you are right driving fast has risks, but so does driving in general."
"65% is at 135 km/h 50% is at 150 km/h

I think at max speed it’s about 20%"
"It's enforced much more strictly, at least in the UK. In the US the cops couldn't give a flying fig newton."
"EU is huge and behavior very broad.  Southern Italy the driving is shit, Northern Italy more civilized.  That said, in general and in particularly places like Netherlands Germany Austria and so on on road behavior is far better than in the US"
It happens but RARELY.
Yeah. It was an example. People change lanes for any reason or none at all. Or maybe they have a reason but you don't see it. Point is that they may not have seen you and boom there you are.
"Thanks I’m kind of a newb at this part, we’ve only got 2000 miles on the car and have only used more than 50% of the battery like 3 times."
Thank you so much for not padding the video with 7 minutes of filler for the sake of YouTube monetization.
Nice video. Performance is still king.
Thanks for doing this! It concisely shows what we've all been looking for without all of the bloat from the 50+ Tesla channels out there trying to make a profit from ads.
"I have an AWD and bought the boost. I can definitely feel the difference and am happy with the increase of acceleration however, if I would have saw this video first I wouldn't have ordered.

That being said I regret nothing."
[deleted]
as a p3d owner who paid over 80k for my car .... meh.
Interesting... I thought the 40-80 would be closer
I’d like to see this same sequence but with a RWD vs AWD or even AWD pre and post boost upgrade
"I will save $2k for booster and $7k for fsd, and will buy a proper performance model some day."
"My husband just bought me the boost tonight for Christmas -- HUGE noticeable difference. It was already plenty smooth and fast w/LR AWD but that boost just takes it over the top for having fun. SO happy with it. 

Course now it's about to rain for 4 days and it's going to remain in the garage while I'm on vacation ;)"
"Man, completely my fault but this is the worst buyers remorse feeling I've ever had in my life.  Got my LR AWD less than a month ago.  Would have happily paid the $2k for a stealth to get such an extreme performance boost if I would have known about it.

edit:  Realized I wasn't clear.  I was not aware the stealth existed when I bought my LR AWD."
Thank you!
Excellent video! Very informative and straight to the point
"Quality post, thank you."
That’s pretty fair if they made it as fast as the performance it won’t be fair to the people who paid extra to get a performance
Great video! Thanks for sharing!
Same here. Performance would’ve been a waste of money.
Are there internal hardware changes between the LR AWD and the Stealth to give it that quicker speed? Or is it purely further restrictions in just the software?
"I know it’s not the point of this video, but I’m so happy to have had made the decision to go for Performance. Totally worth the extra price."
"Yep useless upgrade, I would consider for $500 maybe"
Just want to get the point across lol making it worth your time!
It’s soo fast!
You’re welcome glad it helped!!
"I can feel the difference as well! It’s worth the 2k in my opinion. I was on fence about trading in mine for a performance to get that extra speed, but at end of the day trade in fees, taxes and price of new/used performance car wouldn’t be worth it. The 2k update will do!"
"I feel like the visual representation doesn't do the ""Boost"" justice.


To me it feels like my AWD went from a controlled (albeit very powerful) launch to a definitely aggressive, almost angry launch, if you know what I mean. First time I've ever felt sorry for my tires, actually!
You notice the front motor doing a LOT more, most of all. 

I suppose it now feels like it felt when I first got the car, again. Very impressed with it."
Thanks!!
"I agree , DirtyTesla take notes!"
I agree. It is tough to see p3d is $55k now. I paid $55k for my awd. So painful.
I bet they will always have the performance faster than the LR AWD. It will get closer but never the same. When did you purchase yours?
Have some sympathy silver
Would be interesting!
Yes! glad you love it!
My buddy in the video said his stealth was 4K less than the performance sticker price when he bought from factory.
"Huh? What does this have to do with the upgrade? 
You just weren't able to get a Stealth, assuming that's the one you really wanted?"
"Stealth doesn't cost $2k more, more like $6k more. That boost costs $2k and you can get it!"
You’re welcome!!
"I disagree.
The stealth only cost $2k more than the AWD.

Why shouldn’t the *same* $2k unlock the *same* performance capability?

Hell, charge $3k. There would already be a crater in my wallet. But $2k to get halfway there stings a little too much in the price/performance metric knowing that same $2k could have gotten me a stealth if I had only purchased a month or so later.

There would be *nothing* “unfair” about charging the same amount for the same product."
"Doesn’t seem like they care about who paid what lol. 

It’s only a matter of time before the full unlock gets released tbh."
Makes sense!
"I’m thinking it’s just restrictions on software, don’t know for sure"
Until you see a video of a Boost Dual Motor smoking a Dual Motor.
And you did it perfectly!
The hero we need.
This is the real truth of it all.
Was in the same position. Was thinking of dropping 12$k on the difference. This 2k hits the spot and gave me exactly what I needed.
"Exactly. I told my friend that it was fast but now it's violently fast.

Definitely going to trade up for a performance once a significant upgrade is introduced for the Model 3."
"I feel ya.  I bought my LR AWD less than a month ago.  Was oblivious that there was a ""stealth"" model.  Horrible feeling."
I paid $56k for my LR RWD... -_-
Didn’t you get a larger tax credit? There is that.
"bought in june 2018, delivered in sept."
"It would, I’m on the fence about purchasing it. Might be easier to pull the trigger if I see the boosted car win instead lose against a rival Tesla!"
"Ah crap, I wasn't clear.  I was oblivious that the stealth existed when I bought my LR AWD."
Well it’s not even halfway lol
[deleted]
"Go ahead upgrade then. I would prefer paying for stealth performance back when I bought mine, but didn’t know it was a thing. It doesn’t matter if it smokes regular awd lr. It’s still plenty to beat any regular ice car on the red light ;)"
Yes. I was going to swap for a Performance but the cost would've been 15k-ish. This definitely scratched the itch.
Same boat. I try to take solace I’ll be spending less in tires over the years.
You're doing yourself a great disservice. You got an awesome new car and you feel horrible because you didn't get a Stealth which is the same exact car just a bit quicker.
This is the first one heard of stealth. What is that exactly?
No. Stealth was offered one month after I got my car. $3700k tax credit is not much larger than $1800k anyway.
"Ohhh yeah that must suck to find out later. Maybe it makes you feel better if I said that I did know about the Stealths in the US, but they were 100% not available in the Netherlands, so I had to go with the AWD? :) (Performance was 10K Euros more) 
That's why I love the opportunity to upgrade the speed afterwards.

Still very very very happy with this awesome car!"
"This was my reaction to this video, too - it's not even half of the difference! Disappointing"
"Where did you get these numbers from? AWD is 48,990 and P3D is 56,990. You can get a stealth for 50,990."
"No, stealth only costs $2k more.

You have to call to order one though. It’s not on the website."
"No it doesn’t. The P3D+ Starts at 48, the P3D- has the same performance without all the bells and whistles like performance brakes or tires for only 42."
"But they're still making stealths right now, which are what a 2K increase? If they stopped making those at any point in time then sure, but they didn't."
"If a Dual Motor owner wants more acceleration, they have two choices: Take a 15k-20k depreciation bath, or spend 2k. At some point, I'll spend the 2k. Not yet though. Tesla should offer a trial period for the boost. Give you a taste and take it back. Good way to upsell."
"LR AWD with performance software installed/unlocked. People call them P3D-.  Performance with the PUP people call P3D+ (20” rims, big breaks, spoiler, suspension). 

There’s some light discussion on whether or not Tesla bins their motors, but real world testing shows both P3D+ and - have the same speeds.

Typically the Stealth is $2K more than the AWD model. They also usually come in default configuration for colors inside/outside (currently black/white), and you can’t order them directly, you just ask your Tesla SC to put you on a list then if they get a shipment it’s first come/first serve.

Why this $2K software OTA upgrade doesn’t make the LR AWD into a Performance is curious if they use the same motors."
I'd like to know as well.
"Ah, was hoping you ordered earlier and got the $7500."
[deleted]
[deleted]
"While the motors maybe the same, the performance packs a higher power inverter that can deliver more power to the motors. I believe this is what stops an AWD to fully reach performance level."
Oh awesome. Thanks for the insight.
I don’t understand why Tesla does this at all. You should be able to order and fully customize it
Is there any sources on if there are any differences in the power delivery systems? If you can get a P3D- for 2k extra I thought this 2k unlock did the same thing but apparently not?? Hrm... Buying in a month or two so trying to figure this all out lol.
"Exactly what I'm driving, so happy with it!"
Yup my numbers are correct. No upgrade base price. This is for the US. I don't know about other countries though.
So what does the Regular P3D+ cost where you’re from?
"Yeah I agree I don't understand the rationale.  It must have something to do with the way their supply train works, or perhaps trying to ""reward"" folks who are extra curious?  I don't get it."
"You'd have to dig around.  To my knowledge, there used to be a difference but now there is no longer...which has everyone suggesting they must be binning parts.

I've got a P3D+ and if I were to do it again I would unless the money was an issue then I'd get the P3D-.  

The D- is more efficient due to the wheels/rims so you get better Wh/m on trips, but I've never had an issue getting where I'm going and I really like the way the spoiler/rims look as well as the suspension.

If that's all totally out of the cards I'd get an SR+ or try to find an old LR RWD.

I would under no circumstances buy a new LR AWD without getting the D-."
"Yup. I didn’t know they had the gas savings on.

My bad you were right"
[deleted]
"Thanks and BEEEELieve me I am - just finished saving the down payment I wanted to hit and was waffling between the AWD and Performance but there is no way I can get away with those 20"" wheels around here.  Our roads suck, that and the lowered suspension would be nice but uncomfortable most of the time so dont want that either.

The boost they just released on the AWD for $2k is basically perfect for what I wanted, but if the P3D- is the same price I will start chasing one of those down.

I assume they just do some sort of inventory clear on the binned motor units towards the end of the quarter or something, and Qend is coming up!!  Is there any data on when batches of these things come out?  

I will be calling a store tomorrow but not sure how seriously they will even take me over the phone...  Would be better if I can waive money in their face at getting them to find me one but my nearest store is hours away in another state..."
"I’m confused by everything you’re saying, how can the top of the line model 3 be 31K?"
[deleted]
"You don’t know what you’re talking about and you’re embarrassing yourself, but I guess you don’t care."
What? Yeah ofc we don’t what what we are talking about that’s why we own all 3 of them
"You can have a lot of money and still be dumb.
In America ignoring incentives,
The Model 3D costs 49K
The Model P3D- costs 51K
The Model P3D+ costs 57K

The P3D+ and the P3D- have the same 0-60 acceleration.
There’s no dispute here, you just don’t know what you’re talking about."
"Ok bro! We get it you know everything we get it. 

Not trying to show off anything our Tesla’s but pricing is really different compared to what’s posted and what actually is. We realized that when we got them. You will know when you will order yours. 

Sometimes you have to understand that you are not always right."
"One more thing you were right about the price it really is 56,000. Tesla has the gas potential gas saving subtracted from it.  

My bad I was wrong"
"Omg you are the worst of people on the internet. It doesn’t matter how right you think you are, even a simple search of this sub will prove that the stealth performance model 3 is 2K more than the AWD. You can buy all the Tesla’s in the world and it doesn’t make you right. And me knowing that has nothing to do with the fact that I have owned Teslas, these aren’t even the prices I paid. I paid 62K for my 3D back when they came out, but I’m still aware of what the prices of current models are because I pay attention to what’s happening around me.
Find me a single person on this sub that paid 7K more for a P3D- than a regular 3 AWD and I’ll eat my own hat. Until then you’re just a stubborn troll."
"Had a similar thing happen. Ordered on nov 1, got the text in 2 days it’s ready, but I wasn’t ready so said will come back in 3 days only to find out that they gave to someone else. 

Finally picking it up tomorrow. Model 3 stealth with 19”."
"Must be great ordering and getting it the next day. Here I am 6 weeks later 🙄

P.s. congrats."
"Team Stealth! Welcome!

MSM is bestest/fastest color. 😎"
[deleted]
[deleted]
How do you order a stealth?
Nice. That is my favorite color too! What is the range on a stealth? Same as a normal performance?
What makes a stealth a stealth?
"Out of curiosity, what firmware version did it get delivered with?"
"I see more stealths than any other posted so I just assume it's stealth, making it not stealth anymore. Congrats!"
How much does the stealth version cost?
My config exactly! Congrats!!
Is it full self driving
Hope pick up tomorrow goes well for you!
"Yeah man I lucked out. I was half expecting to pull up to the delivery hub to some clueless dudes who had no idea I'd be coming. So I am pretty excited for my experience, but I can be empathetic to those who are still waiting."
"Nope, red is. In fact, red AWD is faster than msm performance."
Man...I've been looking at that color for a month. You're not helping!
"Blue is obviously the fastest, other than white. Blue will reflect only the higher energy photons so that the car will get more of a speed increase via the momentum of the reflected photons due to conservation of momentum than red, gray, or black, since the absorbed photons tend to be converted to heat energy. White has us all beat though as it’s reflecting all visible photons. Of course this assumes that the light source is behind you, otherwise it will slow you down."
I was an original Model 3 pre-order but couldn't justify it financially. November 11th I was able to place my order. It took about 3 years but with hard work and dedication you can do it!
Stealth is a LR with the software configured to deliver power the same as the Performance 3.
"Talk to your sales adviser, and they should be able to help. My first SA didn't know what it was, but the next SA I asked knew."
"Yup talk to a sales advisor make them aware that you are ready and willing to buy and if one becomes available they will contact you. They send you a link to make deposit and it’s first come first serve. 
It took me about a month to score one. But they seem to be more readily available recently."
If the SA doesn’t know what the stealth is ask him for a sleeper. That’s what they call them sometimes.
"I believe so. I haven't taken a big look at it as I'm feeling quite sick today, but I was determined to pick up the car."
"It's a performance ""under the hood"" without the brakes, suspension, spoiler, and pedals. Also has the track mode, I'm unsure if it comes with the top speed increase."
"Not sure off the top of my head, I'm fairly certain it's the most up to date firmware. I'll let you know specifics tomorrow if you need?"
My Red Stealth 3 was \~$55k. MSM should be $1k cheaper.
"No, I didn't opt for that."
"Red and white are double coating, so technically they are heavier and slower."
"Do it. Especially in the AZ sun, it's gorgeous. Like a sea of stormclouds in the sun."
"Wait so you get the performance specs (range, acceleration) minus the wheels, brakes and spoiler?"
I am guessing you can trade in your LR RWD to purchase the stealth.
It should be a bit higher because the 18” Aeros are more efficient than the 20’s
"Based on other threads, I read it does come with the top speed but you need to have the spoiler installed. Then your service center will unlock the top speed."
"Everything I have read says a stealth does not have the increased top speed. Although I now have one myself, I don't have the area/means/balls/whatever to find out for sure."
Another thread indicated that it does not have track mode.
Picked up mine yesterday and it has version 9
"Sure if you get around to it.  I took delivery of a stealth performance on the 22nd and it’s stuck on V9 release 2019.31.103.1.

Keep hearing this is normal and it should start grabbing current builds within a week or so, which should be any day now.  There are a couple features in V10 I’m really looking forward to."
Mine was 52 and change.
Ahhhhh!! Damn man! I'm going to do it. I just need one more thing to line up to make it a lock. February 1 will let me know.
And minus the suspension.
Yes. In my situation I traded in a AWD.   I got my trade-in value upfront.
"Not sure why you’re being downvoted this is what I’ve read as well. The spoiler is important at high speeds as it generates a downforce. That is, it makes the car heavier in the back, starts becoming significant at about 60mph"
"give me a couple days. I was cruising on my way home and I just forget to check my speed since it's not a traditional instrument cluster, and no engine noise to gauge speed of off, and I was doing about 90 on an nearly empty freeway. I won't need much convincing to see what the Michelin PSS's can do."
[deleted]
Same boat as you. I got mine on Nov 26th and am on the same release. Waiting on v10
"One of us, one of us, one of us."
Can confirm.
Yep. You owe me a beer after I buy it and drive to AZ.
I'll buy you a case of the wackiest craft beer you can think of.
March it is!
Don't disappoint me! I'll be waiting.
"Thanks for sharing but next time please include a better view of the nice new gray wheels and less of the owner! Hahaha jk!

Enjoy the new whip!"
Your feelings comparing the 3 and the S ?
"Not many Tesla’s around me in Cincinnati yet, have yet to see a red one on the road. Great color! 

Also thought of the day is it really a “vroom” with electric 🤪🤔"
"Just got mine here in sunny smokey Sydney Australia - midnight grey, really smooth, and I am over 70 yo. Us oldies are just hippies with tread-wear."
"On my 9 hour drive to visit my mother, at every supercharger stop, I was impressed/surprised how many old people drove Tesla’s (not to call OP old :p).  

I figured the “technology” would be a barrier for people 60+, but that doesn’t seem to be the case."
Why not keep both?
Very well done
"beautiful. love the red. Good choice going with performance too. Wish I'd held out for it, but after waiting two years, I couldn't stand to wait any more. Next one will be dual motor performance fo sho."
"I'd be smiling like that if I were picking up my new Tesla too!

I have an LR AWD on order. Longest wait ever! I hope it'll be end of January when I get it. Will definitely post on here. So excited!"
Don't miss the bigger size?
"The MS is too big for me. The width and length make it a bit of a pain for driving down narrow city streets and finding parking spots. The M3P is more nimble so no, I don’t miss the size at all. I DO miss the binnacle."
"So far I love the 3 and am glad I switched. Faster charging, I love the horizontal display, better ergonomics, better storage options, cleaner interior design, more nimble, and freakishly quick. The only thing I miss is the binnacle."
Thank you!
You’re going to love it. My first Tesla changed my life.
"Seriously, I feel 20 years younger when I drive this car. And maybe it’s because I’ve been in tech all my life, but the tech in this car is never intimidating. I’ll never go back to a conventional car."
"I spent a lot of time thinking about this before I bought. The 3 makes the S feel really dated, similar to how the S made my last ICE feel dated. The 3 is clean and new and the tech is so much better. The electronic vents are great. More storage, lighted vanity mirrors — you 3 drivers don’t know how good you have it!  

I love the smaller size for zipping around the city. The glass roof is awesome. And the acceleration is mind-blowing. 

I miss the binnacle, the auto-opening trunk, the auto-presenting door handles. At some point I’ll probably miss the huge trunk — when you fold the back seats down the S is a great cargo hauler. 

I’m glad I switched."
I don’t need two cars. We live in the city and one car is all we need.
"Ha ha. Thanks for the Urban Dictionary reference for this old fart!

Yes I’ll add pix of the wheels in a bit."
[deleted]
Please explain to him what a “whip” is in this context.....
Yes
"More of a “whoosh”. 

And sorry to hear that aren’t many Tesla’s near you. It’ll come. In Seattle they’re everywhere."
"What part of town are you in? I see Model
3s daily downtown. Oakley Kroger is also a popular sighting ground."
I stop at the West side supercharger about once a month from Indy to Huntington WV.  Seem to usually see New York license plates there if anything.
I see them all over town.
There’s plenty of older folks in pre-facelift Model S. The demographic had money to throw into a little-known electric vehicle company back in the day. :)
"I can't speak for OP, but I did a similar thing - I went from my 2015 70 S to a new P3D-. In am not keeping the S because I just can't afford both. Owning S does not always equal rolling in dough."
The ones that have delivered in the past month at least since they switched from building European to North America. Are VIN-ed as 2020.
"The car..

From urban dictionary:

Whip
When the steering wheel was first put into use in automobiles, it was called the ""whip"". The whip is what you used to control the horses on a stagecoach, hence the analogy. Many years later, various hip hop artists noticed that the Mercedes-Benz logo resembled a steering wheel. They then proceeded to use the old term ""whip"" to describe any Mercedes-Benz vehicle. The term has now been generalized to classify any expensive automobile."
Whip = Indiana Jones + 50 shades of grey.
Work hella in progress
Congratulations! Do you really like M3 over MS?
Ahh I never really make it that way. I’m west side like Bridgetown/Delhi area. There’s a few of us that I see but not many haha.  I can go weeks at a time without seeing another one :(
"Assuming the S is paid for, isn’t the maintenance next to nothing? The only real cost being insurance?"
"Not OP but I just had a Model S 75D loaner for several days while the computer in my 3 was replaced.

So glad to have my 3 back. The S feels like a boat that accelerates like a motorcycle and handles like a go kart. The only thing I'd like is the seats from the S in the 3."
And the cost of a new car decreases when the value of the older car is subtracted from the newer car as a trade in.....
Mine wasn't paid for.
She is a beauty. Congratulations.
Congrats! That's what I named mine initially!
Yes. I removed the Aero caps before I even left the dealership. Just pull firmly and they pop right off.
she’s gorgeous! Congrats!
Chrome delete.  Tint all windows and headlights.  make it all black
Ahh yahh! Welcome to the family 🏁 nice shot too
"Stunning! Congratulations, it’s a beautiful car. Enjoy"
Welcome to the family.  I have the exact vehicle.  Enjoy it and help spread the urge to buy Tesla
I see her silently prowling her prey.
Enjoy the beast! I have the exact same car with the exact same name 😀
How much was it after the tax credit?
"Like the name, but probably would've gone with T'Challa myself..."
"As Forest Whittaker would say ""ahh...the BLEEK Panther"".  Very nice.  Welcome to the family."
Welcome to the family
Woo hoo! Mine arrives in 2 weeks!
Congratz!  I have the white version of the same car and named it Ororo (Storm real name from Marvel).  I do still use the Aero caps when going on trips though and that 5-11% depending who you ask comes in handy.

Beautiful car. Enjoy and welcome
"Slick. She’s got quite the shine. Looks good with the aero wheels sans covers, just need the aero wheel cap kit."
"Waconda forever
Congratulations!"
Is that what is under the aero covers?
Will do!
"I have the 19 inch wheels. I'm looking to blackout my Tesla, any recommendations to replace the chrome wheels?"
Awesome!! Have fun with the new spaceship!
It's a shame some states force you to have a front license plate. Looks so much better without! Very nice car!
Thanks!
Thanks!
what name you ended up with??
"good choice, sir. but you definitely need the wheel cap kit."
I’m new here. Is this to prevent theft?
Thx!
Exact plan + satin black wrap. Doing it myself!
Thanks!
Thanks!
I’ve already convinced about 4 people to make the switch and I’ve had it for 1 day 😂
“Watch as the Tesla sits in her natural habitat”
Cloning is real!
$51k USD out the door w/ regards to $1875 federal tax credit and $2000 California tax rebate.
Haha!
Thanks!
Don’t lose sleep like I did! Haha
5-11% you say? *Grabs Aero caps out of trunk*
Thanks!
Thanks!
I agree! Should be going on tonite!
✊🏾✊🏾
Yes.  Looks like OP needs to buy the cap kit yet though.
Indeed
"I really like the turbine wheels in satin black. Can get 3rd party ones from EVT and other retailers in 18” or 19”.

"Thanks! I’m in one of those states, California, and I don’t care lol. I haven’t been bothered yet, and typically police will only ding you for it if you’re already being pulled over for something else. There’s ALOT of Teslas here and most don’t have a front license plate."
Velvet Thunder. It's a Brooklyn Nine-Nine reference.
It’s ordered. Should arrive today 👍🏽
Purely aesthetic.
Enjoy your new car! Although im still waiting for my delivery it's awesome to see all the posts of people getting their vehicles. You should post an update when your mods are complete :)
I have the same spec but on an SR+. I considered the chrome delete but after I tinted the windows I decided the chrome bits added a nice contrast to the car since everything else was pretty much black. Just an idea you can consider haha. Enjoy the car
Not bad.
Arrives today in the mail 🙏🏽
Thanks I’ll check those out
"perfect 👌
https://i.imgur.com/qKFYwMF.jpg"
Will do!
Thanks for the suggestion. I’m actually wrapping it satin black so the delete will be necessary.
"Congrats. 

I just checked what I paid for my Dec 2018.  It was $55k after rebates which includes $10.2k in rebates back then.  So even with lower rebates, prices have gone down quite a bit for the new ones.

Best car I have ever owned.  By far."
[deleted]
Ohh you’re wrapping the whole car gotcha.  That’s gonna look sick!
you have to remove the center cap.
Just need a small suction cup to pop them off. Easy peasy.
[deleted]
"I think it may depend on the center caps mount type.  Mine has tabs that catches on the inside.  So there's no way to remove mine without un-hooking them from the inside.  I too, would like to have the option of removing or re-attaching the aero caps depending on how long a trip I have."
You got a Stealth with the upgraded wheels - that's a real unicorn! I'm picking up my Stealth from Marina Del Rey soon. See you on the road!
"My two favorite things, this car and GA flying!

THERE’S DOZENS OF US"
Go team Electric Blue!
Fellow WHP pilot!
Definitely read this as Lana Del Rey...I was confused for a sec lol. Welcome!
Not surprisingly because most of the posts I see on here are of the stealths.
Wow you just walked in and took it! You lucked out. And some great driving roads around that area.
Why does this get downvoted?
What is the benefit of a stealth?
Welcome to the Stealth family.
My SA up in SF told me about this exact car but it would have been $4000 to ship north. Opted for a black one instead. Enjoy it!
What was the total cost of getting it ready to go like that?
This is my absolute favorite color combo for the 3
does it have the red line under the dual motor badge?
Is that KWHP?
Sorry how is this stealth? I thought aero wheels is stealth?
"Not exactly stealth given the wheels, but still v.nice!"
What’s your monthly payment and down payment?
#teamblue
"It's the stealth with 18s you really want. If it's white, that is the most value you can get"
Yep!
"It’s only ~$2000 more than the LR AWD, but has the performance of the Performance (2.9 0-60).   It does not  have the performance wheels, spoiler, or brake upgrades of the performance which is why you save so much money."
This again.... Try a quick search on here please.
"Bay Area, I got mine on 12/10. Red with 19"" sports rim. I randomly called on 12/10 and they told me this one was in their inventory with <5 miles. So i put my down and picked it up the day after. I was planning on ordering a LR AWD in Red with 18"" rims... so In a way, i went $3500 over my budget because of stealth and because of the rims... but what an upgrade..."
Yes
Yes it is!
Any option that the dual motor version has can be a stealth. I have the 19”  which is a option on the regular dual motor version
It’s the 19” wheels that is an option for the LR
A lot and probably a little
I got the stealth white with white seats and 18s. I don't see many stealths with white interior
I have on a couple occasions but still don’t get it. Is it cheaper and you get the faster zero for 60?
Thanks for the downvotes...but this question is asked multiple times a day and a 2 second search would find the answer. You know...you try and be polite and still people downvote. I then follow up with specific responses.
What number do you call to see if they have one in stock? It’s always an email but they haven’t even responded
You can almost see the line of Tesla’s lined up for the free charger outside of Vista Aviation lol!
"Oh right! Not an option here in the UK, only the 18 or performance wheels."
Now *that's* a unicorn
Oh man- true unicorn.  Can I ask where you picked that up?
"It has pretty much the same performance as the Performance model, but is $5K less and doesn't come with upgraded wheels, calipers, and spoiler. Many people don't really want those, so it's a 'bargain'."
Performance acceleration with Aero ride comfort
"I called my local Tesla Showroom. ""I want to know if you had deals on showroom or demo models that you want to sell"" Then they transfered me to a higher up sales. 

Pretty much asked me what car/color. LR AWD white or red my answer. They said ""we have a Stealth model 3 in red and black leather. with 19"" rims."" 

My answer ""What's a stealth model 3?""

and the rest is history. They said they had one in stock just recently and I can be assigned the vin if i paid the $100. I did it without hesitation. Picked it up the next day. 


My original plan was order LR AWD on website, and picking it up knowing i wont make 2019 cut off. But I made it and didn't have to wait AT ALL. I only decided to buy on 12/10, and bought it on the spot with a phone call."
"Called the local showroom, picked “sales” and told them I wanted to upgrade my LR AWD order to a sleeper. They knew exactly what that meant and looked through inventory. Was super easy."
"Yup. OP is very fortunate. I'd love to have that car. I still love my Dual Motor MSM with black interior... But that white on white with the red line at that price though... Fuck.

Edit: grammar"
"Baltimore MD. Funny enough, I had two choices for white interior, red and white or white and white. I didn't realize how rare it was at the time"
Would love to turn my awd to stealth. Would instantly pay 2k 😢
20” with low pro summer tires sucks ass in the snow belt.
Thank you!
And LR AWD efficiency. Those performance tires are super sticky.
"Called up my local showroom in Torrance, and lady just said anyone who had ordered in Oct/Nov should be seeing it in the last couple of weeks in december just before the deadline. I also asked if there is any available inventory so that I can switch and get that assigned and she said there's nada! I guess we will just need to wait and see."
There's a chance of a software unlock at some point.
I just want the option to turn off traction control in my LR RWD. Or full track mode if they want. Trading in to get performance would be stupid expensive for me.
Call other showrooms and don't be set on color. I just ask what's available and picked the one that I liked. Just so happens they had close to what I wanted.

Would be a nice Christmas special software update 🤓
So much misinformation. The stealths have a different motor. It’s confirmed on the vin decoder. Not sure how you could get a software unlock of a different motor. https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/mid/home/displayfile/c646fbf1-8ba5-4575-af1e-f415a1131337
"Love it and getting one, but do wish it was a bit bigger, especially in the back."
"I'm excited about it, but can someone explain how/why they can charge so much $ for different paint colors."
"Looks so great! Kindof don't understand why there is a Y sub? People post stuff about the Y to the Tesla motors sub all the time, and when stuff is posted to here far fewer see it. I guess the Tesla motors is super generic since people post stuff about Tesla solar all the time. I'm somewhat new to Reddit so maybe I don't get it."
"It looks just like a big car, or pumped up Prius.  Wish it looked like real SUV.

Hard to believe it can hold three rows.  Wonder how much headroom the third row has."
"I thought it was a 3. Without a 3 sitting next to it, it's real confusing LOL"
Anyone willing to give their input on why ModelY vs M3?
I've seen it twice in person.  Not a fan.  Looks frumpy from most angles.  But it will still be a great car!
"It's the rims.  The ones we are mostly seeing driving around have these terrible rims that make the car look cheap. It makes a massive difference.  Like others, I wish it was more compact SUV size.  How this is an SUV is a mystery.  It does sit higher up than the model 3 though, and I really like that."
That’s pretty typical with premium cars.
"It will be more helpful once we have some Model Y owners. When the model 3 first was announced /r/TeslaMotors was flooded with pictures and questions specifically about the Model 3, which became annoying overwhelming... the result was /r/TeslaModel3 and all were happy."
Did you just compare this to a Prius?
I like model Y more because chrome delete
There should be a /r/CyberTruck....
Thank you. I love that look as well
....try clicking that link...
😂😂😂
"I love it. I think it’s the best looking tesla excluding the roadster and cyber truck. Glad they switched to darker wheels for the performance, they look much better on the Y."
It is my next car. 11/21. Can't wait!
take my money!!
"I love it. I like the look of the Model 3, so with the Y I get that and more room. I can’t wait for the standard range to come so I can order that."
Interior pics please!!!
Can’t wait for mine!
Wish I’ll be able to order a PYD- with black 19” rims and white interior
"For me, the Model Y's biggest competition is the Cybertruck. I really like the idea of stainless steal over painted aluminum, and I could find a lot of uses for that truck bed. I wouldn't need my trailer for lumber trips. The model y sure does look awesome in this pic though."
I’m a skeptic re the longevity of the black body trim around the wheels and along the bottom. Seems likely to fade due to UV.
Chrome delete and black Rims stock are amazing
Yes those wheels match the non chrome trim really nicely.
I completely agree with you on every single word you said
"Do we know that they switched the wheels on the performance for sure? I really hope they did, but when I go through the order process on the website it still shows the silver wheels."
Is 11/21 the date?
I’m pretty sure they will since they changed them on the Model 3.
Yep. That is when my Honda lease is up and hopefully will have my Y by then.
Awesome. That's good to hear!
"FYI, if you plan to lease it probably won’t be an option for 1-2 years with the Y. They just added model 3 leasing in the summer.  They only added it because they plan to make it their fleet cars."
"Dont get me wrong, i’m completely assuming this. I don’t have any knowledge that they will."
"True. I'm going to buy a Y. I want an SR+ and I'm hoping they are making those by then. Since the production timeline has been moved up, I'm a bit confident that the timing will work out"
I get it. I really hope you are right!
"Likewise. I’ve always leased, and it’s the first time I’m considering buying. It’s between the Y and Cybertruck. Just hoping the size of the Cybertruck shrinks a little between now and the final form."
Me too!
So glad I didn’t order the third row
"looks like the back seat of a 911, perfect for a bag of groceries"
Were'd this picture come from? Someone let you in a test model?
doesn't seem like it was meant to be used all the time. 90% folded. 10% during family gathering. yep not worth 3k asking price.
